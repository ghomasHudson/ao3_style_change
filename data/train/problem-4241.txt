No matter. Dean’s going to get back to Sam, no matter what it takes.
Before the brothers end up wrestling on the floor (which happens more than Bobby, who claims responsibility for raising them, would like to admit) Bobby orders them to sit down.
,” Sam shoots back. “Look, Dean! We can do it! We can win!”
“You are going to be unforgettable,” Charlie says dreamily. “Dean Winchester, the boy who would burn you if touched. You’ll look like an angel.”
The shed, which had appeared to be smaller than a regular motel room from the outside, turns out to have a humongous inside. There had been a trapdoor that led to a chute or something once they all stepped inside and Dean and Sam had gone down different sides.
“Charlie!” the rest of the prep team starts to yell, darting out of the room, and Dean shifts nervously on the table he’s sitting on. He doesn’t like being naked, especially when someone that’s a complete stranger is about to come examine him like he’s meat getting ready to be served.
“Can you hand me his water bottle?” you ask, your voice definitely a little sharper than it had been just seconds earlier. Sam scrambles for the weird upside-down dispenser thing he’d never really understood and places it in your hand. You tip a few drops of water into the rabbit’s mouth and rubs his throat. He stops choking, leaving the apartment so quiet Sam’s ears ring.
“He loves you though, right?” Allison asks. “I could see it in the way he looked at you.”
You nod and take your bags back from him. “Yeah, hopefully. I want to be closer to my work so I won’t have to drive as much every day. Plus, Crookshanks would probably like a larger house and what with his recent escape, Mr. Azazel’s patience with us is pretty thin. I’m getting the paperwork finalized next week, and the actual move is in two weeks.”
The telephone rings and Dean jumps. He can feel his pulse in his temple, his heart frantically beating in a last-ditch attempt to prolong his miserable life, but this is it. His arm hurts. He looks down and sees that he’s finally drawn blood on his left forearm after days of scratching. He presses down on the tracker lump in his arm and a dull ache greets him.
“Hey!” Sam says, scandalized, lunging for the remote, but Dean doesn’t register it.
Dean turns away from the milling people quickly. Jo doesn’t, though, and just waves at them with a ginormous but fake smile on her face. Thankfully none of the insects can tell that the districts aren’t as fond of the Games as them, that it’s not so much an honor to participate as it is a punishment. “Why are you waving at them?”
Okay, y'all. Please don't kill me.
With a jerk, he pulls his sleeve down and wrenches his hands out of Jo’s. “Our plan will work,” he says after a moment, pulling her into a hug that feels like his last. Jo wraps her arms around his waist and sighs.
I hope everyone enjoyed their Thanksgiving breaks, if they had one. Remember, students, winter break is only a few weeks away. (Phew!)

“Bitch. Do you need an ice pack?”
Gabe just laughs and pulls a lollipop out of his pocket. “Y/N, I am
Cas is sitting at the kitchen table when Sam gets back. “Hello, Sam,” he says without turning around. Neither of the brothers know how he does it.
“Just to pick strawberries?” Sam uses his best puppy eyes, and damn it if Dean isn’t a sucker. His brother just looks so sad and helpless.
Anyways, here's the chapter.
Cas scribbles another number on the paper and hands it back to Sam. “That’s Luci’s number. And that is a good idea, Sam. I’ll have to ask Amara if that would be allowed.”
Dean’s favorite Peacekeeper, though that’s not saying much; he still hates the man. Just a little less than some of the others.
“Of course. Should I call you or…” Dammit, now Dean can picture him cocking his head as he asks the question.
“Goodbye, Sam.”
“Hold on a sec,” Sam mutters. He fishes his phone out of his pocket. “Should probably give Jack a heads-up.” He scowls. “No service.”
“—but I bet there will be at least a minor one today, considering all the bonfires and grilling,” Sam’s saying to Bobby, who’s nodding. Jo shakes her head and crosses her arms.
He doesn’t want to suspect Crowley of doing something like that. The man might be prickly and tease them and have a superiority complex, but he doesn’t seem like the type of person to hurt a woman and her two sons both under five years old. And then give the sons nicknames and pay them for breaking the rules.
“What if something happens?” Diego and Dean retort back in unison. They exchange startled looks.
On the bright side, at least Dean’s not District 12. Not even he and Jo could pull off those miner’s outfits.
“Shut up,” Sam hisses, glancing around with paranoia as if people will be able to figure out what he’s talking about immediately. More importantly, he’s making sure you’re not around.
This bunny costs Cas more than any other pet Sam has ever known just by having health problems and going to the vet because of ‘emergencies’ where most of the time he’s faking symptoms, and is a master escape artist. He bites everyone except Cas.
“Uh-huh,” Klaus nods, sidestepping him. “How could you have grown up without other people?”
“It’s just a game of luck.”
“Consider it done.” The escort sounds much too pleased with himself. It brings a smile to Dean’s face.
“Hey, loser,” Jo says, breaking away from Ellen and punching Dean playfully in the arm.
“How—how do you know about that?” Sam asks, already blushing as he glances at the door. You’d closed it behind you. Hopefully you can’t hear what they’re saying, though the only way that would happen is if you were eavesdropping directly the behind the door.
Dean looks up, ready to snap at Cas for being useless when it comes to finding his brother or catching the figure in red, but he sees the figure in red peering back around the corner.
“Of course,” the witch laughs. “But don’t worry. They’re all alive, correct? I left them at the hospital after retrieving what I wanted from them.” She winks over her shoulder at Sam. “You boys must be rubbing off on me.”
“Why’d Fluffy need a new vet?” Sam asks, amused. Cas’ bunny, it seems, needs to go to a different vet every other month. Cas hasn’t been able to find one he likes.
(And yes, the only reason Cas stayed with Dean is because he was holding onto Dean’s jacket. Shut up.)
“It’s my day off,” Crowley shrugs.
“Fine, go enjoy your romantic picnic at the station,” Sam finally agrees, even though there was no question that he would. “I still think putting up a picnic blanket in the vending machine room isn’t very romantic, but whatever.”
Sam can’t keep the snicker out of his voice, even though he knows this is a serious situation. “Yep.”
The glances Dean and Jo exchange are more panicked than excited, but either their prep teams don’t notice or they notice but don’t care.
“But you have a cat.”
Dean touches his tender nose gingerly. “There, now you look like a human being!” the one with purple lipstick says brightly. He slaps Dean’s hand away. “Let’s call Charlie!”
“It was all my idea,” Dean says hastily the moment Crowley sucks in his breath to say something. “I swear.”
Dean hadn’t liked them all marveling over the angel’s surprisingly toned chest.
“No—”
“She still wants me to be a lawyer. I’m happy with my job. For now, at least. How you doing, Cas?” She switches her attention to her favorite out of all of them, though she’ll never admit it, and Sam and Dean shrug at each other.
“Please, Cas is so much politer!” you call back.
hours.”
girlfriend.”
The thought crosses Dean’s mind that Charlie’s relatively normal air masks a complete madwoman. It’s certainly an unorthodox approach in the Capitol. She could win the Games with that attitude.
Cas coughs. It sounds suspiciously like a laugh. “Water?”
“If you think… I’m not going to let Sam be alone with John,” Jo finally blurts out. “I know you protect him. I can’t… I can’t break up a family.”
“Well, I wouldn’t lie about that,” Cas replies. “She says she wants to be closer to her work. You should get a dog.”
Sam wakes up fifteen minutes before his alarm is supposed to go off. Two people are running around inside his apartment.
“I’ll rip yours off if you do mine,” Dean replies. “If it doesn’t go as planned.”
“It’s fine, Sam,” Dean says automatically. He doesn’t even remember Sam killing him during that one time Gabriel decided to be an even bigger dick than normal. “Don’t even remember it.”
“Sammy!” Dean bellows, cursing internally again before starting to jog again. He’s not entirely sure he wants to reach where the figure in red is leading him, but there’s also the chance that his brother is in trouble.
“‘M fine, Cas.”
Dean shrugs. “Rowena more or less made it so we had no choice.” He glances into the foyer, where the white light of the portal doesn’t waver.
“Scary,” Luther mutters at Dean’s side. “Never seen Five laugh before.”
“Nothing more important than you,” Cas responds earnestly.
“I’m fine, Dean,” Sam replies. “You’re fine, right? And you, Cas?”
“And Jensen Ackles,” Dean acknowledges, nodding. “Sorry, Cas, but looks like you’re outta grace for the moment.”
“One time he told me he was fine after getting stabbed because he’s gotten stabbed before!”
It sounds to be coming from behind the red figure.
Dean sighs and looks up at the ceiling. “Yeah, I, uh…”
Some of the people on top of the buildings fall off, whether pushed by wind or shot, but many more disappear back into the buildings. The crowd is trampling Peacekeepers, fire is roaring, and the screaming sounds more like laughter. For a moment Dean believes that District 11 will be the answer. Maybe Naomi isn’t invincible after all.
“Then why did you lure us down this labyrinth?” Cas asks.
Actually, I have a lot, but none of them are appropriate. At all. So I'm just going to go along with, that was a fucking shit awful cat vomit ending of a show and I'm manifesting it away. For now, this is my rewrite of it. The characters might not be in the same universe, but they're the same people and I'm giving the people what they want, dammit (which is a satisfying ending where everything isn't thrown away for shock factor and homophobia).
“In love?” Jody yells.
“Ah…” Allison starts, looking pained. “I suppose it’s no use to remind you that we don’t point guns at our siblings.”
Sam reaches out and pats Jack’s knee. “We’re all very proud of you, Jack.”
Something’s grabbing him! Something’s holding him down! Something’s—oh God he’s
That’s not the interesting part of the costume, though. The headpiece Charlie had put on Dean’s head she assures him is completely safe, but he’s not so sure. Just before they enter the streets, Charlie intends to turn on the headpiece, which is actually a conductor for electricity. Sparks will fall from Dean’s head no matter what movement he makes. The same goes for the boots he’s wearing; with every movement a spark will erupt from the heels.
“You call me,” Dean says quickly. “You’ve probably got meetings and stuff. Important stuff that I shouldn’t interrupt.”
“I can get him,” Sam offers and throws the sheets off. “Um, if you don’t mind me asking, how did you guys get in
Dean sighs and sits on the couch, rubbing his face wearily. He needs to shave. “All right, stop with the chick flick moments. How long was I sleeping?”
He’s going to be a walking ball of danger. All he hopes is that he and Jo don’t burn each other.
The preteen snorts. “I’m not about to compromise to some robbers breaking into our house.”
“Technically,
Yep, going along with the Capitol’s charade is going to be a lot harder than he’d anticipated.
Dean jerks up, his heart racing momentarily. “Yep! Yep, I’m here, bud. What’s up?”
“My partner, Kara, is the stylist for your friend Joanna. At the moment we’re deciding what complementary costumes we wish to create.”
“You two have proven you can’t handle working together, so I’m separating you for the next two weeks.”
Okay, so this chapter includes a LOT of references to literature. They are: the Greek legend about Pasiphae and the Minotaur, Romeo and Juliet, the Greek legend about Icarus and the sun, The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde, Macbeth, and Harry Potter. You'll probably be fine without knowing about them, but if you want to read them, then go crazy.
Rowena left the boys to deal with the five adults and one bloodthirsty preteen, citing the need to find whatever ingredient that exists in this universe and not in their own.
“NO!”
Thank you to everyone that reviewed! You all made me very excited to continue this story. I'm a little frazzled right now as I just started my new job and on my second day they had me work an 11 hour shift... rip. I'm working over 30 hours a week AND tomorrow is the first day of school so you could say I'm a little busy. Anyways, I will continue to chug away at writing this story and I'm excited for everyone's reactions to this chapter.
is how Dean finds himself in the courtyard of the Umbrella Academy mansion, torn between cheering for Cas and Luther as they compete to see who can lift the largest weight.
And into an empty room.
“We have to listen for the buzzing,” Sam murmurs back. “To make sure it’s not on.”
“What are they talking about, Five?” a deep, grating voice asks.
“Where are we?” Cas asks, frowning. “I can’t sense any of my brothers and sisters.”
“He’s also your sibling?” Cas checks.
Dean turns off the television.
He’d bet that these rooms go unused except for just before the Games, but that doesn’t matter. What does matter is how Dean needs to control his expressions. If the Capitol finds out about his revulsion for them, there’s no way he’ll get sponsors.
Also, give it up for Lansfics7 who got accepted into her dream college yesterday!!!! I'm so proud of her, she's all grown up. Like a full grown adult now.
“You know what you’re old enough to do, then?” Dean teases. “Bring some girls beyond the fence. I did that all the time before—” He clears his throat. “Well.”
“Public appearances?” Dean asks with a sigh, then he freezes. She might tolerate his unwillingness on good days, but today is not exactly a good day.
Cas clears his throat. He knows that Dean still isn’t comfortable with people knowing about their… relationship.
The electricity turned off about a month in, making it extremely boring to continue throwing, but on the other hand it definitely improved Dean’s hand-eye coordination. Plus, it was the same spot somebody tried to use giant scissors to cut through the metal, so it was already wasting away, and the spot is hidden from nearby Peacekeeper patrols by a large tree. Dean finally broke through on a cold winter morning. He used an axe in the days to come to make the hole larger until it was big enough for him to step through without brushing the metal in the off-chance the electricity will get fixed. He’d also had the presence of mind to fit the metal in the hole as best he could so as to attract the least amount of attention.
!” Five sputters. With a flash of blue light, he disappears and reappears in front of Klaus, hands on his hips.
kill you!” Sam bellows, gaining steadily on his brother and his brother’s boyfriend with his longer legs.
Sam frowns and shuffles his feet. “R-really?” He huffs.
“Come on, Crowley,” Sam gripes. “We’re only going out for a little while.”
“Yes!” Sam cheers. “I’ll get my stuff.”
When it’s discovered that Sam and Dean really are as good as Diego from years of practice, they call Jack over to move the targets midair. This is where Diego smirks, as Sam and Dean do miss a few and he misses none, even when his knives flip over themselves, zip back and forth, and defy the laws of gravity as they fly through the air.
Dean’s chest goes warm with pleasure. Sitting here with Sam he feels safe. Sam pulls a blanket over both of them, making sure to kick Dean as he does it, and Dean slouches even lower. Before he knows it, he’s practically lying down on the couch, facing the ceiling so he doesn’t have to look at the TV screen. His eyelids are so heavy.
Dean scoffs. “What the hell else are we supposed to drink? Apple juice?”
Then, because they’re all dumbasses, Sam, Dean, and Cas stepped into the shed, and Dean hasn’t seen his brother since.
Last point: we have been led several times in the show to believe that Sam and Dean are fighting when they actually aren’t (the first example that comes to mind is their staged fight when trying to kill Gabriel/The Trickster in Tall Tales). What if they aren’t angry with each other at all but merely putting on a show for Billie’s benefit? Unlikely, in my opinion, but possible.
“I’ve definitely been sleeping.”
“We’re not going to focus on the work,” Charlie continues. “We’re going to focus on the water. And what it does.”
Another pair of Peacekeepers pass them. Dean nods to them and they nod back. It must be nearing three in the afternoon, when the enforcers rotate for the third time in a day.
“What are they talking about?” Dean whispers to Cas.
“Yes,” Rowena answers briskly. “I need to pop into another dimension quickly and get another ingredient for a spell I’m working on that will help you with whatever apocalypse the three of you have started.”
“I’m your favorite customer, sweetheart!” Gabe calls to your hastily retreating back.
As always, I'd appreciate if you left kudos or a comment. I spend hours writing each of these chapters and I'd love some feedback!
“I don’t want to worry you.” Sam shakes his head, ready to say something about how he can help, but Dean knows firsthand how much pressure it is to take care of your brother. “You don’t need to worry about me, Sammy. You hear? Everything I have ever done I’ve done for you and I have not regretted a single moment. I just want you to be okay, Sammy.”
“I wouldn’t dare,” the escort replies dryly. “I just asked when you’re coming back.”
Something flashes behind him and the clicking of a safety near his ear makes Dean’s blood run cold.
“Dean?” Cas’s tinny voice asks through the phone.
“Oh, yeah!” Sam steps back and rubs the back of his neck. “So I guess you are his vet after all.”
His stomach drops.
On the other hand, we're getting closer and closer to the end! Thank you all for your support!
“It’s not fair,” Dean whines. “Sam’ll still get to see
“And if you die what do you think will happen to Ellen?” Dean whispers. He wants to sound like he’s arguing, but the truth is that he’s going to get back to Sam.
Sam hands it back. “Couldn’t you just bring him to the station? There’s always officers there and everyone loves rabbits, right?”
“I’m polite, Sam,” you reply without looking back at him. “I don’t do it in front of the owners, but I bet you won’t tell on me. And I don’t really curse at people I barely know.”
and he’s only fifteen. Sweat trickles down his back and from his hairline.
“That’s bull.” Sam rolls his eyes and puts his hands on his hips. “I do need to worry about you, Dean. That’s my job.”
“We must have landed in a universe without heaven,” Sam exhales. “Remember Jared Padalecki? And Supernatural?”
“I’m fine,” Jack insists. “See?” Five pokes his skin with the tip of the knife, marveling when the skin opens but no blood runs out and it knits itself back together in mere seconds.
his little crush he blushes like a schoolgirl. She’s not much better, either. If it wasn’t for me, they wouldn’t even talk to each other. They’re too
“With our hot neighbor—” is how far Dean gets before a burst of speed helps Sam take a flying leap at his brother. They fall into a bush and Cas takes the badge out of his pocket.
“Yeah, parents and kids.”
“Your aunt sounds like Canada,” says Jeremy with a small smile.
Alex reaches in a bag and holds up a black sweater. The text reads, “Merry Whatever” and in the center is a grumpy cat with a Santa hat on.
When they get back to the house, everyone goes separate ways for private conversations. Dean, Sam and Cas go to talk about something financial — apparently with it being important to finish before the Sisters arrive. Jack goes to the rec room with his laptop to to chat with Canada and write some emails, because he’s hoping to go through add/drops. Jeremy goes to the bedroom to FaceTime his mom and dad, and winds up calling one of his aunts, too. Gadreel disappears somewhere. Miracle gets bored and whines a bit upstairs, but eventually goes downstairs to sit with Jack. Communication must go well for everyone, since no one looks troubled when they all meet in the kitchen later looking for snacks. Dean and Cas take Miracle for a walk. Sam checks in with Eileen, who doesn’t give much in the way of details about her day but promises to take care of dinner and bring Charlie; although, not Gertie. Rowena texts a few times to Sam. Not long after that they get word that the sisters are about to arrive, so they head outside.
“Yeah, sure.
“Can I see the camera roll Dean?” asks Cas.
Justice on Earth," and she has a long, thin, multi-colored scarf, that looks like something Charlie would wear. Right now she seems happy and even a bit playful, waving at the car with a smile. She seems to frown from the noise from the Impala entering the lot behind them, and Dean thinks maybe he should have had Sam bring his Subaru. She’s probably judging Baby for being a gas guzzler, but what’s done is done, so they’ll have to suck it up on first impression points.
Sam answers. “They’re around somewhere. They had an impromptu girls’ night, and stayed up late — or early. They may still be in Rowena’s room.”
“I think it was meant to hold sheet music, or paper. Mom, helped me find it,” says Charlie. “But that’s not the gift.”
“You’ve taken Chuck’s place. I can feel it. ”
Dean says, “Son of a bitch,” realizing that Miracle might eat too much buttered popcorn off the floor, and manages get him interested in a chew he’s been keeping in his pocket instead.
“Sure, the cold air and this walk have me pretty alert.”
“Cas, please, please hear me. I love you. Come back to me. There’s so much more I want to say, that I need to say, but just get yourself here and let me tell you.”
“Dean, it doesn’t matter. You’re here and I can feel your love.” He put his hand on Dean’s heart.
The smile on Jeremy face falters, and so does Donna’s. He attempts recovery and smiles more energetically, saying how glad he is to meet her. Donna gives another smile and heads upstairs. Jeremey feels himself sag after.
“You’re on,” says Jack with a smile. Jack unconsciously mimics Dean, sitting on the arm of the newer, less comfy sectional next to Jody and Donna’s love seat. Sam grabs one of the club chairs.
Eileen pokes Sam in the side and says, ”This is your chance to shine, babe.”
They watch the group walk off to Baby. Mel can’t help a smile and a head shake as Baby makes a ton of noise backing out. They wave as the car straightens out and passes, noting the group waving back.
The whole room says no, and that Donna is always nice even when being a badass, and she blushes.
Jeremy has a displeased look, a bit like the time when Jack started grilling everyone on the order of operations. He vaguely points at the direction of the stairwell, and says, “But if there was an emergency that woke you up after you’d gone to bed, you’d have to put on your shoes anyway.”
Dean slides out a drawer and he and Cas find it filled with plastic cookie cutters.
“We’ve got a long list of rare items to get a hold of, and his contact is always a pain in the ass to talk to. He said to go on in to the diner for a reason, Dean.” Dean huffs and fiddles with the menus in the stand.
Jack has a lightbulb moment. “Oh, so this is why Canada, wrapped her ladder rungs in pool noodles,” he says. “I thought she just liked the colors.”
“Yep. We’re a legit non-profit, but we’re trying to get people who are both talented and who aren’t 100% civilian, if you know what I mean.” says Charlie looking over her shoulder as Jeremy comes back with her plate.
He looks uncomfortable as he says, “I just called my mom and dad, and we’re talking about my leaving Saturday or Sunday. I’d pick them up in Denver.”
“Yeah, tell me about your trip while I try the hash browns.”
“I’m hurt.”
“You’re misunderstanding me Dean. I think it’s great!”
“How come he gets to have Skittles as his color, but I can’t have a fish,” says Jeremy with a smile.
“Oh, that makes sense,” says Jack sounding older already. “He’s supposed to text when they get to the hotel. That should be pretty soon.” Jack stretches his back and arms, and Kelly stretches her wings up, and flicks them back down.
“What would you say if I ride with you when you go pick up your parents. You know how Dean and Cas are, they’d be happy to follow in Baby, and Mom, too. We could say hi to them and then come back.”
Sam starts. “Listen up everyone, Rowena will update us on Hell and Heaven — with some help from Gadreel and Kelly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas says, “Charlie will be sorry she missed it.”
Cas looks like he’s ready to go, but then he turns around and with a soft smile says, “I love you, Dean.”
When Dean and Cas get down to the dining room, they find Jack and Jeremy eating oatmeal, fruit and yogurt. Sam is running his juicer. Gadreel sits with a newspaper and a cup of black coffee that’s probably for show.
“Sure. Cas, come sit in Baby a minute.”
“I guess I should have been worried,” says Jeremy. “What if they weren’t ok?”
Sam goes to bitch face, and Cas and Eileen give matching exasperated looks and crossed arms. Snickers and clicks of disapproval are heard.
Jack plops on his bed with his shoes on and with Miracle following jumping up.
“Sure.”
“My mom sounds like Dan Levy’s character,” says Jeremy. “She’s always saying ‘screw the patriarchy’ — but she mainly does it while driving a V90 station wagon, so…”
Ok, probably some of you might be wondering things like "is this going to be a romantic thing with the OC and Jack?" and "what is everyone's gender identity." I'm really not intending to fill in a lot of blanks, and I'm thinking that Jack is really just wanting to build friendships. This friendship could be a foundation for something else later, but that shouldn't come up in this particular story.
After a long, late breakfast on Wednesday, where everyone is sluggish. Sam announces, “Ok, do what you need to wake up. Family meeting in the rec room in 20 minutes.”
“Not sure. Thankfully the boys never came down to tell us what they picked. Otherwise they would have heard the conversation.”
Mel smiles, “I’m not going to turn that down.”
“You know very well nothing the past few days — free weights before we left.”
“Ok, last round on the good byes,” says Dean.
“Jack!” Castiel hugs him tightly. “I was so worried about you, but I had faith.”
“Jack, she knew that you loved her. She loved you. She said that you were one of her boys.“
“I think I could get around that,” says Jack in a knowing tone.
“We’ve had this conversation before.”
“No!” Both Dean and Cas yell.
Now that the banter has died down, Gadreel looks up and says, “Good morning Dean, Cas.”
Jack, looking a bit like Cas, says, “I hope you’re not expecting him to be polite all the time. You do know he’s in parent mode?”
Middle-aged ex-hunter and ex-angel snuggling. More slice of life. The sisters arrive. First impressions are awkward sometimes. Jack and Claire play pool.
“When he stopped Nick from calling Lucifer, he didn’t just immobilize him or kill him quickly. He put Nick through pain, torture. I saw him do it. If it had been me, I admit I’d have been glad I killed him. But the pain wasn’t right — I knew who Jack was. I was with him in the Apocalypse world. I’d seen him kill to protect whole settlements and you hadn’t. I saw him when he was grim and determined. He was sometimes stubborn and too quick to make decisions, but killing Nick was different. Jack never desired to cause pain. I knew it was wrong for him.” Mary pauses and sets her mug on the coffee table. “I called Jack out on it, and he wanted me to say that it was ok. Frankly, I could have just lied. I’m a hunter. I know strategy. I could have told Jack that it was ok. We’d have all gone back to the bunker, and then I could have told you, Sam and Cas together in secret. Waiting for Castiel to get back would have made the most sense. We would have faced his soullessness together.”
“They never even agree to not bring weapons into the kitchen,” Cas continues.
“Idjits,” Bobby mutters.
The opening music of the ceremonies begins and Jo jumps. The massive sliding doors Dean had been trying to ignore slide open, revealing crowd-lined streets of glittering insects.
Five scowls. “That is so not true, asshole—”
Bobby’s eyes widen as Sam blushes and kicks his brother.
Cas’s warning about how helping everyone in a community actually helps nobody comes back to Dean. He brushes it off. Cas might be smart but he doesn’t know everything. Besides, there’s no other way for Dean to help.
“Two hours?” Sam guesses. “Nothing interesting happened. It was just tributes hunting and stuff.”
Dean’s head snaps up. Why would someone bother to create bruises with makeup? That’s ridiculous! Bruises aren’t attractive; all they do is attract weird stares and sympathetic glances. It makes his skin crawl. It’s why he wears long sleeves whenever he’s fought with John.
“We have an apocalypse to prevent,” Sam explains, gesturing for Jack to follow him. Jack misunderstands the signal and takes Sam’s outstretched hand, startling him—but in a good way.
“I know, right?” Allison exclaims. “Like, we’re all eating breakfast! Don’t clean your knives,
Five nods. “58.”
. I’ll text it all to Cas, but I would take away his food for the time being and put the water back in. From now on I’d recommend smaller bits of food, because Fluffy can’t seem to handle anything big.”
You nod and poke your fingers through the mesh of the demon bunny’s cage to scratch at his fur. “Well, knock on my door if you need anything else, all right?”
Both men nod their heads.
The other man winks. “You’re gonna be late for work, Sammy.”
To Sam’s awe, you reach inside Fluffy’s cage and pick him up without him even trying to get away, which might have something to do with how he’s choking, but it’s still impressive.
“Little jumpy there, aren’t you, Squirrel,” the man observes. “Now, you boys wouldn’t happen to be sneaking out of the district, would you?”
You brighten visibly. “Your brother Dean is Dean Winchester? What a small world!”
“Yeah?”
Okay, so for the past few episodes we’ve been seeing Dean lie a lot, whether he’s lying to Amara about hurting her or Sam and his friends about seeing dead bodies. My guess is he’s also lying to Billie about being on board with the plan of blowing Jack up to kill Chuck. I mean, we are led to assume that Cas told Dean about Jack’s deal with Billie NOT Cas’s deal with the Empty or Dean wouldn’t have let Cas leave. Why would Cas be texting Dean if he was on board with Billie? I think Dean lied to Billie (obviously) to make her think that he is on board with her. However, he’s lying to Sam about being on board with it so it seems like the Winchesters are fighting about whether or not to go through with the plan. I’m sure Billie knows or is watching and will be so distracted by the Winchesters feuding that she won’t notice what Cas is doing until (hopefully) it’s too late.
“Sam, is there a preteen holding a gun to my head right now?” Dean asks, rolling his eyes.
delicate.”
“Uh… yes,” another person points out.
“Hey, Cas. What’re you doing here?” Sam replies, smothering a yawn with his hand.
compliment the kid more. God knows Dean would’ve liked a little more appreciation for taking care of Sammy when he was younger from John. “I killed Lucifer for hurting Sam,” he adds angelically. “He wasn’t very nice.”
Thank you all for sticking with me so far. This is the last non-Games chapter, so buckle in for some violence!
“Wow, you really do know everyone, don’t you?”
“‘Don’t get caught’,” Dean repeats her mantra, rolling his eyes. “Where’re the kids, Jody?”
“Fine, fine,” Cas grumbles. Dean whirls just in time to see Sam knock the gun out of the stunned preteen boy’s hands.
At the end of it, everyone but Jack, who opts for a glass of chocolate milk, is drinking alcohol. Apparently his powers are still intact in this universe, maybe because he’s as powerful or more so than an archangel. That’s useful to know.
“What the hell, dude?” Sam makes out through gritted teeth.
Sam rolls his eyes. “I’m not a little kid, Dean.”
“Hey!” Dean barks, making all the spectators jump. “What did I say? Did I say no cutting Jack open or did I say yes cutting Jack open?”
He looks like he’s got two black eyes. Dean touches the shadowed skin under his right eye with tentative fingers, but it’s not a bruise so it doesn’t hurt. He can feel the bone underneath the soft skin. When he lets the fingers rest there, his whole hand starts to shake. Dean clenches his fist.
You turn around at the sound of your name and smile when you see Cas. “Cas! I should have known the shouting was Dean. What are you doing here?”
“Ah, yes,” Allison sighs. “This is Klaus.”
“Wow, Deano really wasn’t lying,” Gabe says, tossing the lollipop stick into the trash can. “You’ve got it really bad.”
Dean sneaks back up the stairs, hoping they don’t hear his footsteps. When he reaches the foyer, Rowena steps into the building, looking entirely too pleased with herself.
“It’s my three least favorite idjits,” Bobby grumbles when they’re in earshot, but he’s the first to hug Dean, Sam, and Cas, in that order.
“Turn on the TV,” Dean orders, surveying the deserted street one more time before slamming the door shut and locking it. After a brief moment of contemplation, he drags a chair over and jams it under the door handle. He can hear a commotion on the TV. Maybe the Games are over. “Sam? What is it?”
“Heya, Sammy!” Gabriel practically shouts upon seeing that he’s awake.
“Oh, yeah,” Dean adds. “You guys don’t have God in this universe.”
“Well, Y/N says that her clinic is opening a training center for dogs and that she’ll be working in both the clinic and center. Since you want to see her so badly, you could get a dog and have her be the vet and trainer.”
“Hello?”
“You didn’t miss much,” Sam informs him. “We just watched the last girl pick berries and stuff.”
A red light is blinking at Dean. Right at Dean. It’s attached to a camera pointed right. At. Dean.
“Winchesters?” Bobby, their grumpy old supervisor, calls, sticking his head out of his office. He doesn’t sound like he’s in a good mood, but then again, he never sounds like he’s in a good mood. And he usually has a soft spot for him and Dean, seeing as how their dad had worked at the station too and Bobby’d practically adopted them after John started taking crazy long trips.
“I’m fine,” Cas groans, on the ground and not sounding very fine. “I suppose our questions were answered. I am still unable to be killed except by my—”
“I apologize,” Cas immediately says, standing up. “You are exhausted as well. I will try to contact Dean and help him find his phone. He still doesn’t know about Fluffy’s new veterinarian. Hopefully today will be a slow day of work. Goodbye, Sam.”
“Tributes!” a man with long fake eyelashes with stones glued onto the end beams at them. “Dean Winchester, it’s an honor. And Joanna Harvelle, your father is a legend. His Games were, in fact, my favorite, even if they were a little before my time.” He smiles, revealing white teeth. One of them has a smudge of his purple lipstick on them.
Jo spends the rest of the next day gloating about how she only owes Dean fifteen dollars now, and that the number’s sure to drop until Dean starts owing her too.
“Yeah.” Sam smiles (you’d remembered what he sounded like!) but the renewed sounds of choking behind him wipe it off his face. “Sorry, Cas Novak gave me your number because he said you were his bunny’s vet but—”
Dean’s more likely to punch someone, and Jo knows it, so she just sighs with resignation and turns away from the window. Her small hand lands on Dean’s bicep and he flinches.
Dean stares into his friend’s eyes. She’s a good actress. She might be acting.
“So this was all for a spell?” Dean asks, moving to step forward but stopping as if he’s been tethered to a brick wall. He looks back and sees that Cas has a hold of the back of his jacket. He shrugs. It’s a valid point; Rowena is a wild card if they’ve ever met one. It’s better to be cautious and not get within reach of her to hex them or spew bodily fluids.
“Does it look like
“Well, he’s an angel. And this is our son, Jack, who is half-archangel,” Sam finishes.
Klaus claps. “We should do science experiments!” as if he hadn’t heard Dean at all.
“Adopted,” Dean adds. “Technically, he’s Lucifer’s son. But Lucifer’s a major dick that tortured my brother for about a thousand years, and the kid isn’t stupid, so he stays with us.”
Dean moves in to hug Ellen and then Jody as Sam and Bobby talk quietly. “My two favorite ladies!”
Even if he does find them despicable.
Dean seriously needs to sleep.
“Why don’t you put on your robe and we can have a chat?” she invites, not noticing the abrupt change in Dean’s posture. He accepts the opportunity to be covered gratefully and pulls it on before following Charlie through a door she pulls open. It looks to be a sitting room they find themselves in.
Dean drifts away from the two moms, who don’t even seem to notice him leaving, and back to Cas, who takes his hand immediately.
“Five?” a new voice asks. “What the hell is going on?”
Instead, Sam’s stuck eating grainy food in a house that reeks of their mother’s ghost, and Dean’s alone in a world of insects he can’t step on.
“Who was that?” Sam asks.
A pair of patrolling Peacekeepers pass and Dean nods at them. The next house closest to the street the Winchesters walk on receives a soft package thrown at the front step. Finally Dean casually reaches up and inserts a package in the joint between two branches on a tree trunk. He knows that Road kids like to climb that tree.
“Jack,” Cas replied with a smile, allowing a few inches so their eyes could meet.
Dean nodded without hesitation and when he reached for his wallet, Pamela had suddenly appeared before them.
They left the Impala and made their way inside the bunker, holding hands as they strode quietly down the hall. The sound of laughter echoed from Sam’s room but neither cared to stop by for conversation. When they reached the door to Dean’s bedroom, they stopped at the open entrance and peered in. The bed sat at the center of the room, large and comfy, an open invitation.
“Say yes, you idjit,” Bobby said with a grunt. “I’ve already had the talk with HQ and Chief Sinclair was more than happy with the choice.”
When Cas lowered his phone, Dean was halfway out the door. Startled by the departure, Cas was up on his feet, chasing him outside within seconds.
For so long, Dean had wondered if the Angel felt emotions like the rest of them, if he understood concepts of family, friendship, and love? He had always known that Cas cared but did he feel it the way that Dean did, or Sam? Over the years, with every new choice that Cas had made, it opened Dean’s eyes and allowed him to see how much the Angel had changed, from blind warrior to the one who risked it all, Heaven and Hell, to stand beside them. Hearing his tearful confession, hearing him tell Dean how much he meant, how he saw him as loving and caring, how Dean had changed him, made him feel and made him
Dean nodded and looked up. “You know, I was rough on the kid in the beginning. You were gone and he was there and I just took all of my anger, all of my resentment and distrust and aimed it at the kid. I regret it now but back then, I could hardly see straight. It was a bad time for me, those weeks that you were gone.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas began but Dean shook his head, eyes pleading with the Angel to understand.
Bobby chuckled fondly. “Before you head out, there’s something I wanted to talk to you about.”
When nothing but silence answered, Dean lifted his head and thumped it backwards again. He repeated the move over and over until he felt pain at the back of his skull. The thought of losing Cas again, losing him a final time, of understanding his own thoughts after his friend’s death was too much. He wanted to forget and didn’t want to forget at all.
“I get that,”says Jeremy.
“I’ll miss your ok-ness.”
Jack rushes out with Cas following a little slower saying, “Grab your coat!”
As many times as he’s crossed the midwest on I-70 Dean knows about the wheat Jesus billboard, and the enormous ball of twine that they — thankfully — won’t be passing, but it still takes him by surprise. Considering Jack was temporarily God, having an interest in wheat Jesus seems odd, but apparently Jack is now into kitschy tourist things.
Kelly stirs her hot chocolate and looks at Jeremy thoughtfully, “Ok, thanks.”
Dean exhales. “Let’s get a little rest. So how close is the boys’ room to us?” Asks Dean.
“Jack, I always thought you looked like Cas, but seeing you two in a picture like this… Dean, they’re so much alike.”
“Not just a yummy treat, huh?” asks an amused Charlie.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack simply smiles for a moment. “I’m here because I’m everywhere now. Can’t you feel it?”
“Wow, that’s excellent news,” says Sam as Jeremy and Jack nod.
“You’re like the little brother that I definitely didn’t want,” says Alex with a smile. “You’re on group chat with Patience and me now, so don’t ghost.”
“You look nice,” says Cas with a smile. Dean’s in a simple solid green henley with a denim shirt on top and jeans that are darker and less worn than he normally wears.
The little girls squints. “You’re blue but it’s shiny on top.”
Jack disappears back up, but a minute later Jeremy hears him say, “I admit to seeing some down sides to the top bunk.”
“Just some wondering about who will or won’t be at the reception. Do you think you’d be back from spring break in time to go that Saturday?”
Cas turns from his conversation. Cas says, “I heard that, and it’s not true. There’s a lot of you in Jack — especially bravery and faith in people. No one has faith like you.”
At the park, Sam and Eileen make reservations to join a sleigh ride and dinner group on their own. The group takes the moving walkway to the top of the hill. Jeremy regrets not being able to have a DSLR while tubing but takes pictures on the hill with his phone. Jack convinces him to take a selfie with him. Jack debates the possibility of getting him to post it, since Jeremy’s IG never has any people in it — Canada calls it landscape aesthetic. Once the group gets to the tubing lanes, they learn that they’ll go faster if they connect tubes. They divide and have the helpers clip Kelly’s tube to the boys, and the two couples are clipped together in another lane and off they go.
Cas’s eyes widened, his mouth falling open in disbelief. Not wanting the moment to break, Dean reach forward, hands gripping the warm neck before him. He yanked his friend close and let their lips find each other. Their first kiss was gentle and as perfect as Dean had dreamed. Cas made a noise of surprise but seconds later, his arms snaked around Dean’s waist, drawing him in. His mouth opened and Dean could barely hold in his whine when he felt the press of tongue against his own. Slipping one hand through Cas’s hair, Dean deepened the kiss, his heart pounding even faster at the feel of Castiel’s body. After so many years of confused feelings, the dam was finally breaking. A decade of longing, frustration, anger, heartache, and love poured out. One kiss after another, they crashed through all those walls, releasing the fears and baggage that had weighed them down. They let themselves feel, let themselves believe, accepting each other with the promise of a new beginning.
With a final pat, Bobby turned and made his way back towards the firehouse. Climbing behind the wheel of his Baby, Dean took a moment to sit where he was, letting the conversation wash over him. When the news finally hit, he made two fists and bumped the steering wheel in excitement. The promotion was something he had secretly wanted for the past couple years but he had always been too nervous to voice it out loud. Being a firefighter was everything he knew and loved. He wanted to share the news with Sam and Jess but something else at the corner of his mind took focus. Smiling broadly, he made a choice he’d been too afraid to make before that moment. He finally decided to take a chance.
The kiss was soft, nothing more than a gentle press of lips. When Dean made a noise of contentment, released from a place of need deep inside, the dam finally broke between them. Cas tugged him closer by the hands they still held, their bodies molding together. His free hand traveled to the small of Dean’s back and up his spine, ending in his hair, buried in the strands as if they were meant to be there always. At the first hint of tongue, Dean made another noise and couldn’t help but lean even closer as his mouth fell open. It was clumsy and messy but perfect. All Dean could feel and touch and taste was Cas, inside and all around.
“Are you okay?” she asked, her brows furrowed similar to Sam’s.
“Let me guess, you’re a health freak?” Dean asked with a roll of his eyes. “You and Sam will get along great.”
The noise grew louder and Dean tilted his body towards the hallway, still lost in his thoughts. The days after Chuck’s defeat and Jack’s farewell, Dean had spent every waking moment in quiet reflection. He’d gone over every moment he had shared with Cas, every word of significance they had ever spoken, every comment made about them from Heaven and Hell.
Cas tilted his head to the side and finally smiled, his gaze a mixture of love, adoration, and fond annoyance. “I choose
With a heavy sigh, he spun around and reached for his clothing, strewn across the floor beside him. Boxers, jeans, shirt and flannel. When the final button was done, he ran a hand from front to back, hoping to tame the edges of his short hair, and looked up just in time to catch his mirrored reflection. His eyes were hangover red but there was a tiredness in them that went deeper than his drunken escapade. When the heaviness in his heart grew too tense for that time of day, he tore his gaze away. His companion tilted her body, sensing the surrounding emptiness, and blindly reached her hand out towards him. Dean stood frozen at the foot of the bed, hoping his stillness would deter her from further movement. She made a noise and buried her face in the pillow again, all sense leaving her as sleep dragged her back in.
In the restaurant, sitting at opposite ends of the table, and having different conversations, Mel and Nat didn’t seem very much like a couple. In a living room of new people, Mel takes Nat’s arm and also takes the lead for interaction. She skillfully runs interference for Nat, taking the spotlight when needed, so he can be comfortably quiet, yet keeping him part of the conversation. He can focus on her, but still be present. It’s a skillful dance that they have down to an art, and Cas and Sam glance at each other, perhaps thinking the same thing — they seem so attuned to each other, it’s hard to understand the divorce.
So it had escalated a little bit. And he and Dean had started it, so they’re the ones in trouble, even though they’d had nothing to do with covering the dogs with shaving cream and letting them loose in the police station or buying all those loaves of bread and clogging the ladies’ toilets and sinks with them.
“He was refusing food,” Cas replies. “Goodbye.”
You pull out before Sam gets to Cas. “Hey, was that Y/N?”
Make sure to leave a comment below to let me know what you think. That always makes my day.
The door creaks open and a redheaded girl with bangs peeks her head inside. “Knock knock.”
“Walk straight, go up the stairs, take your first left,” Luther directs. He claps Dean on the shoulder and sends him stumbling away, hissing as he rubs his shoulder. “Uh, sorry.”
“Dean, you’re in here!” a woman with golden tattoos all over her face squeaks, opening up the door to what looks like a torture room. “Not that you’ll have much to improve upon.” The appraising look she gives Dean has him both uncomfortable and proud. Obviously he’s still attractive, even here in the Capitol, but does he really want someone probably twice his age thinking he’s attractive?
Sam winces at that comment.
Sam frowns. He and Dean work in the same department and live together. Pretty much the only time they’re not together is when Dean’s on a date with Cas.
Just under five hours later, Dean is dressed in either the most sensational or deadliest outfit the opening ceremonies has ever seen. Or maybe they have. Dean’s just sure that he’s never seen an outfit like this in all the Games he’s ever seen.
Sam flips over the back of the couch, his feet landing on Dean’s stomach. “Yeah, but it’s cool to watch.”
“I’m not…” Jo pushes up Dean’s left sleeve just enough to see the sausage-shaped bruises on his wrist. His hand twitches in hers but he doesn’t pull away, which is a big improvement since the first time Jo had found out about John’s training.
The thing that annoys Sam, though, is that Dean was right—without him pushing the two of you to talk to each other and him, the most you ever do is smile at Sam and mumble a quick hello if you ever catch each other in the halls. Sam isn’t sure if you’re just that shy or avoiding him. Knowing his track record with girls, probably both.
Happy holiday season!
Thank you all!
“I shall see,” Cas says cryptically.
“Sam, you get regular shift, Dean, you get night shift.
“Yeah?”
But God, Dean wishes that he could step into those woods and never come back. He could take Sam and they could live off the land, far away from Naomi and the Capitol.
Ellen rolls her eyes. “Your sweet-talk won’t work on me, boy. Bobby was telling me all about your mischief at work. What do I always say?”
your fault,” Dean says hotly.
“Kara said she’s tried it before,” Jo says, but her tone is obviously uncertain. “What do you think Bobby will think?”
Thank you all for reading. Reviews are greatly appreciated. As always, please check the tags of this story thoroughly for any potential triggers.
Cas squints.
He hopes Sam didn’t hear him calling Cas huggy bear—and what the fuck of a nickname is that, anyway?
There is also a specific TW for this chapter: homophobic language, references to abuse, and internalized homophobia.
The day is clear, though a few clouds are far away in the sky, and Dean can hear children laughing a street away. They’re probably at the park. Maybe Jack Kline is there too.
“You guys are leaving?” Vanya asks, visibly disappointed.
“And stop calling me ‘Sammy’!”
Sam turns to look at the deceptively cute-looking bunny Cas had left him with. Dean had gotten Cas Fluffy for, like, their third date or something and Cas had loved him ever since. He had brown eyes, grey fur, and one white ear.
“Ah, civilization,” Rowena says, pleased. She straightens her already-straight dress and pats her hair. “Perfect.”
Shiny black boots come up to Dean’s knees and a headpiece complete the outfit. He looks like a shadow, or a black deer with odd antlers, and
“That’s not any spell we’ve seen before,” Sam points out.
“Come on, Bobby, you know this isn’t our fault!” Dean says the moment the door shuts behind him.
“Great,” Dean gripes. Poor kid’s gonna be confused and worried for hours on end before they get back. “Let’s make this trip as quick as possible, then.”
At least Rufus isn’t supervising today. They would have their asses handed to them on silver platters.
!” She gives her brother the stink eye.
The camera zooms in on a group of people on top of the Justice building. Something blasts off a section of the building near them and the people stagger. One falls off. In the corner of the screen Dean sees that some Peacekeepers now have guns and are shooting at the people on top of the building while their colleagues break bones with their discipline sticks if they’re not holding up a shield.
For the first time Dean doesn’t understand John’s decision not to mentor any tributes. Sam and Dean would have been able to visit the Capitol. They would have been able to eat this fancy food together, laugh at these weird people together, and marvel at the view together.
“Yeah, but you’re not obsessed with it like Sam is. He’d probably want Y/N to wear that shirt while they’re having sex, he’s that into Harry Potter.”
“Who?”
Dean looks at him out of the corner of his eye. “You ever been able to not pick something up?”
The figure in red lowers its hood and Dean recognizes who it is.
“We’ll be back later,” Sam promises Crowley, who inclines his head and sits against the tree trunk, looking for all intents and purposes like he’s about to take a nap.
He’s sure the Peacekeepers knew exactly what he was doing, but he was eight years old and a Victor’s kid, so they couldn’t really say much and there wasn’t much danger in letting him and Jo wander a little ways away to pick strawberries and play in a stream. Though Dean always insisted the strawberries the Peacekeepers sometimes buy from him come from a garden behind his house, he’s sure the Peacekeepers know that’s bull considering his backyard is very visible to the public and there is no garden in there whatsoever. There was one time—Dean’s not sure if it was a dream—that he thinks he remembers falling asleep and Peacekeepers coming to get him, but of course that could all be the product of an active imagination.
Diego nods.
“See what?”
“You barely even look at people you don’t know,” Sam mutters to himself but he thinks you hear him; you stiffen a little bit.
Oh my god, I have so many feels and thoughts about the new episodes. And are you guys terrified for this week's ep? Shit's going down. Didn't they say 15.19 is the 'season finale' and 15.20 will be the 'series finale'? My bets are on Chuck dying this episode so we can have our happy ending next Thursday, but feel free to disagree with me in the comments.
“It’s quite hard to protect someone with the survival instincts of a squirrel on crack cocaine,” Cas remarks. Dean’s face colors when he realizes that he’s walked in on a gossip session consisting of his boyfriend and the two exasperated siblings of some weird-ass people.
Here's another chapter. Please review and let me know what you think. That always makes my day!
“That sounds…” Sam can’t help his grimace.
A giggle floats down the corridor and the figure in red whips away.
Sam pauses and cocks his head. “Um, Y/N?”
More snapping has the camera moving around in a frenzy. The people walking on top of the Justice building hadn’t been stupid to stand up straight; they’d been a distraction. There are people on top of every building in the Justice Square, all unfolding their own anti-Capitol banners. One reads DOWN WITH THE CAPITOL. Another says NO MORE DEAD CHILDREN. Dean’s stomach drops more and more as he reads VICTORS ARE MURDERERS and DISTRICT 13 WILL RISE.
“We must have gotten off on the wrong foot,” Rowena calls, her voice lilting in the dusty air. “We didn’t mean to end up in your house.”
“Are you okay?” Dean demands, racing into the living room. His brother is fine, but his eyes are wide as he looks at the TV. Slowly, Dean walks around the couch so he can see the screen as well.
Sam spins on his heel, taking in the area, and Dean looks up. A massive steel chandelier hangs from the ceiling of what must be a mansion, judging by the size of the foyer and the many rooms that look to branch off of it.
“Are bunnies invited?”
“I’m not going to ask you again,” Dean growls. The people on the top of the building prepare to unravel the banner. He prays that they’ll all be shot down before they manage it.
“Or what?” the person hisses through gritted teeth. “You’ll shoot me?”
he begs internally,
“Well, you lost at least two years of your childhood when you became a Victor.” Sam attempts a smile. “So you’re an honorary kid. Can’t we just be
His breath catches in his throat. Naomi saw him leaving the District. She saw his business deal with Crowley.
Please review—it always makes my day. Also, happy holidays!
non-alcoholic.
“He’s got powers too!” a man holding a throwing knife marvels. Undoubtedly he’s the one that threw it at Cas’s chest. “But he’s not our age.”
“JO!”
Sam laughs. “I never imagined you cursing so much.”
Please review.
!” he finally yells, hitting the wall with the side of his fist with frustration. “Sammy!”
“You could do your schoolwork,” Klaus informs him. Both brothers make faces immediately. “That was Ben,” he says hastily. “Not me. Don’t do your schoolwork.”
Dean blushes and ignores his little brother. He hadn’t even known Cas could be that devious. It had been a good move, though.
“Just don’t give any to Azazel,” Crowley adds hastily. Like Dean was going to. “He never shares.”
“Dinner?” He sounds delighted. Way too delighted when it’s simply the offer of dinner.
“It’s Y/N,” Dean says, grinning wickedly at Bobby’s shocked expression and Sam’s red face. “She’s our cute neighbor in apartment 67. Man, I wish she could have been on the other side of 68.”
Rowena waves her hand airily. “I made a new one that’s much more convenient. No more pesky one-in-a-million ingredients. Just a few human body parts and some common herbs. Simple, if you’ve got enough talent. It’ll last for eight hours.” She winks at Sam. “Are you boys ready?”
Thank you again for all your support and I can't wait to see you all in May! :)
,” Sam hisses.
Sam pushes his brother out of the chair.
All of Dean’s walls come flying up. Charlie wanted to be a Gamekeeper, which means she wanted to brainstorm different ways to brutally murder children. She’s the same as the rest of the insects. Her outsides just don’t match her insides yet.
Also, if anyone has any theories for the season, I'd love to hear them! Won't go into mine in full here, but if anyone would like to talk about it, I'd be happy to discuss in the comments.
Allison rolls her eyes. “Castiel, come over here real quick.”
And they all claim to be siblings.
“Was Crowley one of the Peacekeepers that hurt Mom?”
I would love to hear everyone’s opinions on these theories. Please let me know in the comments!
“Hey!”
Now he’s in a forest. Just like the arena’s forest.
“What do you want, you bitch?” he wheezes, standing up and groaning. He’s getting too old for this.
The first time he entered the forest after the Games he could have sworn that Jo was running through the trees beside him. After that he could have sworn Krissy was screaming for him.
“Hey, why are you babysitting Cas’s bunny? I thought his brother Luci normally did that.”
. “They came through a light in the middle of our foyer. Do
The houses start shrinking. The kids playing outside get dirtier and skinnier. Dean pretends to tie his shoe and leaves a package underneath a mailbox. Hopefully the residents will find it.
Something cracks behind him and Dean whirls, heart racing, but it’s just Sam stepping on a stick. “You can go in front,” Dean invites. Sam nods and takes the lead.
Though the fence is electric, there are spaces where it’s broken or turned off. Some kids like to throw rocks at the fence to make it spark, and enough hits have been known to make holes in the chain link. Dean should know. He spent months chucking rocks as hard as he could into the fence.
“That’s pretty much all that’s left. Apart from some birds.” Sam shoots Dean a look. “I bet you could catch all the rats. You’re, like, so good at setting traps.”
can control them, lady.”
Call him paranoid.
“Dean, your brother is in love!” Cas yells, then starts sprinting for his boyfriend. Dean stops pretending to drop Jo and sets her on her feet, sees Sam chasing Cas, and starts to sprint too.
“So you’re all the same age,” Sam says for the third time. “Except for the kid, who is not actually a kid.”
Sam makes a face.
Cas just smiles at him. “Bobby already said he doesn’t mind. There haven’t been many fires for a few weeks, so there’s no need to worry. Please, Sam? I have the address for Fluffy’s vet, the office number, and the vet’s personal number just in case.” He hands Sam a piece of paper with that information on it, as well as Dean and Cas’ numbers (as if Sam needed any reminders) and some other random numbers Cas apparently thought Sam might need for his four-hour babysitting gig. Most of them are different pizza places’ numbers.
“Bye, Crowley!” Sam waves goodbye to the older man and hurries after Dean. “Hey, Dean?”
Dean considers the route to the fence he usually takes. After a moment, he jogs to his bedroom and pulls a suitcase out from underneath his bed. He takes three wrapped packages out of it and stuffs them in his pocket.
“Hi,” he responds and stares at you.
“That’s so cool,” Dean admits, shaking his head.
Hey everyone. We are getting closer and closer to the end of this story (only three chapters left after this!!!) I am really nervous and I really need to keep writing the sequel lol. Anyways, enjoy!
The figure in red flicks its head and for the first time Dean hears his brother’s voice.
All too soon, the next three chariots roll out of the glorified stable. Exchanging glances filled with trepidation, Dean and Jo reach up simultaneously and flip the switch on their headpieces. Immediately the sound of crackling electricity fills Dean’s ears. He doesn’t know what he looks like, but he can see Jo, and the effect is stunning. The two-pronged headpiece spits sparks (Charlie had sworn they were synthetic and wouldn’t burn if they landed on Dean).
“I was thinking the exact same thing,” Dean murmurs back. He grips Sam’s shoulder and starts to run for the house. He’s not in the mood to be cornered by any anti-Capitolists, betters, or thugs today. Sam keeps up well, presumably from all the track. Scratch that. By the end of it Dean’s panting but Sam seems hardly out of breath.
Pulling back, Dean saw the flicker of doubt cross Cas’s features from his silence. Instead of letting it grow, Dean reached up to take Cas’s face in his hands, the kiss the gentlest he had ever given. When they tilted away again, the shine was back in Cas’s eyes. Dean couldn’t help but smile as he wiped the stain of tears away from his own face. Cas reached up to take his hand, twining their fingers together. A few years ago, it would have felt odd holding hands but now, all it did was make Dean’s heart beat more loudly.  They exchanged smiles and stole glances as they walked to the Impala outside. When they reached the passenger door, Dean pushed Cas against the cool metal, searching his eyes.
“You turn thirty-five only once, little bro,” Gabriel said with a toothy grin. “Mrs. Banks from next door has already agreed to watch Olivia for the night. She’s coming by in a few minutes actually.”
