“Mmm. I can see it,” Sherlock says, reaching down to cup the growing erection in John’s jeans. They haven’t even changed for bed yet, though Sherlock’s taken off his suit jacket.
John feels relieved that he doesn’t have to argue for it, that Sherlock doesn’t think he’s a monster for even suggesting it. “I think we find a nice couple who live somewhere very far away from us, and Rosie gets a new name and a fresh start,” he says, the words tearing at his heart.
He’s on his back now, eyes questioning, and John can hardly speak. He’s kneeling between Sherlock’s thighs, goggling at the body on shameless display before him. He feels as though he’d died and gone to heaven, only heaven’s got nothing on this, he thinks. “Just like that,” he says, breathing heavily. “I want to see your face when I’m inside you.”
Sherlock feels his face prickle with heat. “I don’t know about that,” he says, attempting to brush it off, but John isn’t having this.
Four hours later, John goes back downstairs in his dressing gown to shower. Sherlock now has three laptops open at once. His hair is a mess, but he’s still typing away. John passes through the kitchen and notes that the coffee pot is empty. He puts another pot on, then ducks into the loo to shower quickly. He shaves and brushes his teeth, which he forgot when they got home, then goes back into the kitchen to pour himself a cup of coffee. He goes to retrieve Sherlock’s cup to refill it, then brings both cups to the desk and sits down across from Sherlock. “Any progress?” he asks.
The bathroom door opens and Sherlock comes out, his eyes going immediately to John. His expression gives nothing away, at least nothing that John can detect from his nanosecond glance up from his book. He comes over and gets into bed, his movements and mannerisms seeming rather studiedly neutral to John. He turns to face the loo, his back to John. “Good night.”
Lestrade nods. “Yeah. Fine. I completely understand. Go home, both of you. You’re exhausted and you’ll want to take Rosie home, I know. How’s Mrs Hudson?”
“Perfect,” John says. “In that case, I’m going to put on the kettle and you’re going to get off your feet. That’s enough activity for you for now.”
Sherlock just hums in acknowledgement but only pulls back partway, his fist going harder, lips tightening, and that does it. John does shout as he comes, his cock spasming in the heat of Sherlock’s mouth and then he’s spilling himself there as the pleasure pulses through him like electricity, his entire body going stiff for it. His head is thrown back, his mouth open as he pants through it, coming to himself a moment later. Sherlock gives him a last lick, then sits back on his heels, lips pressing together a little. “Was that – all right, then?” he asks, looking oddly shy considering his seeming confidence throughout the whole thing.
I smile into his eyes and feel that same lump come into my throat. I’m one thousand percent sure about this. There’s nothing in the world I want more. That I’ve ever wanted more. “I want you forever,” I tell him softly. “I want a future with you. I want the danger and the quiet moments both. I want the brunches and the dinners and the weekends with Rosie. I want weekends and holidays away with you. I want to spend weekends out at your parents’, go to Rosie’s matches and concerts and graduations with you, want to retire out in the country one day with you. I want to marry you, lay proper public claim you for all the world to see. I want to do this forever. There. That’s what I’ve been trying to make myself hold back, Sherlock. I just thought maybe it was too soon to say it, but I can’t not say it right now. I love you and I want you forever. There’s nothing in this life that I’ve ever wanted more.”
Sherlock searches his face. “I don’t want there to be any doubt on that score,” he says, frowning a little. “I’m – I’m too far in for that now, John.”
“Nope. I actually thought about trying to just agree to get myself out of the room, but I couldn’t make myself say it.” The room is emptying and their conversation is becoming a bit too easy to overhear. He nods toward the door. “Come on. It’s almost time for dinner.” Once they’re out in the corridor, he turns to her. “I’m sorry if my questions were offensive. I was just curious, because you seem like such a nice person. Now I know that you are, and I think you’re probably a very good mother, like I said.”
Sherlock had shaken his head. “It’s not fair to hold her responsible for her actions, no matter how calm she seemed to be, doing all of that to us. I don’t know. I’m still angry, regardless. She needs something, though. She’s been deemed beyond medical attention, but I can’t just leave her there, alone.”
“When, then,” I agree. I move minutely and look up into his eyes. “I love you,” I say, meaning it with every fibre of my being.
“I love you, too,” he responds, then gasps in his next breath – John’s erection is there, rubbing at the cleft of his arse, and just the feeling of it there is more intimate than he was prepared for, somehow. It’s more intimate than fingers.
John seems to be concentrating particularly on extracting the claw meat with a long, narrow fork. “I – well, yeah,” he says. “In the interests of full disclosure, yes. Of course. For me, that’s just how it works. The – emotional simply comes with a physical manifestation, or a desire for one, at least. You know how I feel about you. I was an idiot and blurted it out the other night. And the corresponding component is equally strong. But I want this to be whatever you need it to be.”
and all that the concept entails. After they’ve eaten, they move to the sofa and watch the news, the television relocated to the coffee table so that they can sit together. They watch their case get discussed, locals being interviewed, Lestrade taking a question or two and showing the handwritten plan of Smirnov’s bomb attack, found with the explosives themselves. The attack was to take place in Edinburgh in four months’ time at an international political event.
“Er, yeah, that would be good,” John says, aiming for tact. Basically Sherlock just sat there with his eyes closed and allowed Janine to kiss him, as he recalls. “Um. You know, kiss back. Lean into it a bit – though not too much, either.”
Molly tries to imagine herself doing precisely that and can’t quite see it working. “Well, I guess I don’t need Sherlock to be jealous. I’m marrying Todd, after all. I’m done with all that.”
still echoing in his head. “What are you doing here?” It comes out scratchy and not particularly gracious, but she’s just turned up uninvited in his bedroom. John looks over at the time and sees that it’s only half-past seven. He was planning to call her once he was awake, but she’s beaten him to it.
. They were just friends! But their closeness made her squirm all the same, and she wasn’t surprised to find Mary bothered by it, too.
They find a place among the other couples, the music slow and romantic and perfect, and fit themselves together like pieces of a puzzle. It feels, Sherlock thinks, John’s cheek leaning against his own, rather incongruously almost like their wedding. It’s one more memory to seal in everything that’s happened since they arrived. It has indeed been a week of firsts, a week he’ll never forget.
He walks on and on, and eventually his thoughts stop whirling quite as much. He finds himself on the footpath beside the river. The entire town, at least what he’s seen of it, is intensely charming. There are a few boats out, in spite of the cold weather. People are genuinely punting. It’s the perfect upper class stereotype. It’s also very pretty, even in winter. There are willows drooping gracefully into the river and to his right, the immensity of some church or other is approaching. He checks the map on his phone and discovers that it’s King’s College. “I’ll be damned,” John says aloud, to himself. He didn’t mean to come here, to this place that Sherlock is fond of. Suddenly, and despite everything else, he wishes that Sherlock were here right now. He’d say something like
Sherlock puts his lips into John’s hair and kisses his head. “So do I,” he says. “I know I don’t deserve your trust. Trust isn’t something rational, and when it’s been broken, earning it back is not easy. But I mean to make myself trustworthy, John. To you, if no one else. There is no one in the world who matters to me the way you matter. I would do anything to make myself someone you can trust again. I understand that it’s not something that can happen overnight. But as long as you love me, I can live with that.”
Sherlock smiles at her. “In that case,” he says. He gets off his stool and goes around to hug her, and she hugs back. “See you Friday. We can meet in the lobby.”
To be fair, he doesn’t want to in the slightest. That kiss is still burning on his lips and at the moment, the only thing he wants is to kiss Sherlock again. Right here, if need be. He doesn’t even care. Sherlock’s hand is warm and dry and even this small thing is making him feel like he’s fourteen again, his heart thumping, the colour still high in his face.
It’s Mike Stamford’s birthday, so he types a happy birthday message on his facebook wall. Mike sees it at once and likes it, then comments a moment later:
Sherlock shrugs. “It’s the closest place likely to have a hotel,” he says, very slightly diffident, and John imagines it because the entire question of a hotel and the two of them staying in one together raises all sorts of other questions.
When it’s finished, another hour has past and the sitting room has plunged back into shadow. John folds the letter, puts it into an envelope and seals it shut, then writes Sherlock’s name on the back side. He picks up his phone, notes that it’s at four percent, and uses its remaining battery life to call for some food. He plugs it in at his desk, then stands there for a moment, thinking, then types out a text to Mycroft.
John pauses. “Hang on a tic,” he says into his phone, then moves it away from his mouth. “Are you sure? We’ve still got Rosie… I was thinking you might end up wanting to sleep a little. And Rosie will need to go for her own nap in about half an hour…”
“Since the days when we lived together. Before you went away. I – couldn’t always quite bring myself to acknowledge it directly, but I knew. Under there somewhere, I always knew.” John puts his lips to Sherlock’s again. “And somehow, in spite of all the shit we’ve been through, here we are again. Rebuilding a home together. A life together, if you’ll have me in it.”
?) John pats around until his hand finds the lube, up near the pillows where Sherlock tossed it last night, and gets some onto his fingers as Sherlock bites at his neck and thrusts gently against him. John starts there, smearing lube between them onto their cocks, which makes it feels instantly even better, then gets a liberal amount onto his first and second fingers, not sure how much Sherlock will want. He can feel his pulse thundering, completely turned on by the thought of touching Sherlock like this again. And if it leads to –
The words want to come out in a rush, but Sherlock makes himself proceed with caution. “I just wanted to say – you know that I hadn’t forgotten you, don’t you? That I wasn’t preoccupied with Eurus, or the girl on the plane. I was focused on solving the riddle because I was trying to find a way to save you. That was my priority.”
“Quite. I was impressed by your verbal agility,” Sherlock says. He gets to his feet and comes around to the end of the bed and John hastens over to meet him. Sherlock takes him by the shoulders and plants his mouth on John’s for a long moment, his hand drifting down to take John in hand again, and John’s cock leaps to immediate action at the touch.
He seems equally unsure of what to do with himself. Sherlock clears his throat surreptitiously and busies his hands with the simple task of making a pot of tea. Perhaps he should give John something to do. “I think there’s milk,” he says, in lieu of giving a directive. In fact, he knows there is; he bought it only last night.
He sighs. Harry smirks at him. “Two-year-olds,” she says, shrugging. “So how’s work? Do you guys have a case on right now?”
“Like hell I’m not.” Mary raises the needle again. “Of course, it’s more effective when you hit a vein directly, but it absorbs through vascular injection just fine.” She looks at Sherlock. “Of course, it should have killed you, given what you were on, but I should have known it would only make you more manic.” She looks at Rosie. “But we’re about to forget all of that, aren’t we?” she coos, and Rosie makes an uneasy sound.
He says my name then and I cross the space in a heartbeat, bending over him, my hands on his cheeks, my mouth on his at last. He’s so tall that he doesn’t even need to stand for this, his head tipped up, his hands coming up to hold onto my elbows as we kiss. It’s long and intensely sweet, our lips closed, but it’s nonetheless one of the most passionate kisses I’ve ever had. I pull away after a little but stay there, bent over him, my thumbs rubbing over his cheekbones. Sherlock touches his tongue to his lower lip and blinks up at me, his eyes starry in the firelight, his face looking unusually young and trusting in my hands. “I love you,” he says, and my throat closes.
Beside him, John shifts, too. “D’you think they’re just – hanging about, listening to see if we –  ?” He stops again.
“Definitely. And we still have that whiskey,” Sherlock reminds him. “You could take a shot of that, too.”
“Not to my knowledge,” Sherlock says. They haven’t moved. “I suppose we should attempt to pull ourselves together and get that.”
He watches the wrong time blink on Mary’s clock for another hour before sleep finally retakes him, eventually succumbing like a prisoner of war too tired to keep evading recapture.
John nods. “I’m sorry,” he says, his voice and arms both tight. “I didn’t mean to make you worry so much. Or make you think that I don’t want this. I do, Sherlock. And I do love you. I mean that.”
“Actually, it’s a shorter drive to Baker Street than out to Mary’s place,” Liz says. “But we don’t mind that, John. And we’re not trying to accuse you of being a bad parent. Not at all. What we’re trying to say is that we understand the inherent difficulties of doing what you do and having Rosie around at the same time, and we have a solution we’d like to suggest.”
When Sherlock comes up later, she nearly gapes at him. It’s like night and day from the last time she saw him, sobbing, high, and soaked to the skin. He’s firmly in control, exquisitely dressed in a suit, deep purple shirt, his shoes polished to perfection. He’s shaved and coiffed and looks like he just walked out of a magazine advert. He’s also bearing a sheaf of tropical flowers, which he proffers to her upon their greeting.
“No – just your hand – ” Sherlock gets out, then pants hard into John’s skull as John starts stroking him in earnest, his grip wonderfully hard, knowing instinctively how much he needs it. “More – please – ” Sherlock babbles, though it’s already almost overwhelming.
John swallows, his throat growing tight. “I love her,” he says starkly. “I never wanted her until recently, when everything else started settling down a bit. But it occurred to me last night that keeping her with us might be the selfish thing to do. And this is the bit where I say ‘and she’s not even mine’. She’s mine in the sense that I’ve taken care of her and loved her, but that doesn’t mean, maybe, that I’m duty-bound to be her father. There might be someone better out there to be that for her. Hell, most people alive would be better parents to her than I could ever be.”
At the crime scene, they interview the witnesses jointly, though no one saw anything. “Any vehicles driving by slowly, or the same one coming round again and again?” John asks a woman who is clutching her daughter by the shoulders.
It gets interrupted when John’s stomach growls loudly enough to be heard in the next building and the kiss dissolves into juvenile laughter. “Oh, Jesus, I’m sorry,” John says, feeling a bit embarrassed.
But even within a week, things improve. John is there more often than not, sometimes with Rosie, but mostly without her. When Sherlock asks distantly about her, John tells him about alternating Rosie between his neighbour, Mrs Hudson, and Molly. Sherlock carefully does not ask anything too complex, cherishing this new truce between them.
John’s face is so beautiful that it hurts. He stops when they get to the table and pulls Sherlock gently back into his arms. “Yes,” he says simply, before their mouths come together again. “It really will.”
He strides down the corridor until he finds what he’s looking for: a private, one-person bathroom. He pushes his way inside and waits for Sherlock to follow him. When he has, John moves toward Sherlock, trapping him against the wall, and simultaneously bolts the door shut.
We play our game over glasses of brandy, then Mr Holmes drives us back to the station (“save you the taxi fare”, he says). When we arrive, he switches off the engine and gets out to say goodbye properly, as he puts it. He hugs us both and says, “One of these times, maybe you could just stay over. Sherlock’s old room is still free, and there’s a big bed, do for the two of you. Save you the long journey back when it’s got late. Just if you like.”
John finishes his cake and dabs at his mouth with a serviette. “It’s an incredibly generous offer,” he says at last, his brow a little furrowed. “In the spirit of being entirely forthcoming, I’ll tell you, as I’ve told Sherlock, that becoming a father wasn’t really my first choice. But the fact is that I am one, and I just need to think about what’s really best for Rosie and not what I want. You’ve made some extremely good points, though. I agree: Baker Street and the life we lead is decidedly
Sherlock ignores this and glances around the dimly lit office, his eyes immediately tracking over the various cameras. His eyes return to Mycroft’s. “He’s alive, you know,” he says, rather sharply. “No thanks to you.”
It is, without a doubt, the most intimate, romantic, and overall best night of Sherlock’s life. He and John lie together under the blankets John rescued, kissing and touching gently until they both grow hard again. John has Sherlock turn onto his side facing away from him, and gently massages at his hole until he can fit two fingers inside with ease. Sherlock confessed how much he liked it when John did it before, so John offered to do it again. His fingers within Sherlock feel nearly as good as his mouth did on Sherlock’s erection, and he says so, feeling audaciously vulnerable as he puts the intensely private thought into words.
Lucas steps out again. “On a final note, you’ve all just handed in your guest agreements. I just want to say that we take these very seriously. The rules are here for your protection – for instance, no hiking past nine in the evening. The rocky terrain can be treacherous and so we keep the area beyond the hills off limits after nine. We’re also very much in earnest about the rules pertaining to fidelity. You’re here to work on your relationships and we take that very seriously. Trust me, the staff here are, with the exception of Margaret, gay men. We know how it is. Rule number eight, which you’ve all put your signatures to, specifies no visiting other guest rooms, and no sexual relations with anyone other than your partner. If you’re swingers and want to get together with another couple – or several others – make arrangements to meet up back in London, or wherever you’ve come from today. But not here. I trust that’s understood.” He surveys them sternly for a moment, then relaxes into a smile. “We want you to enjoy yourselves and most importantly, we want you to leave this place happier and healthier than you are today. That’s our mission, and we’re committed to it. Have a great week, gentlemen.”
John feigns an intellectual frown. “Yes, of course,” he agrees. He studies his coffee, maintaining the frown. “It’s bad business all around. What people can make themselves believe.” The words feel foreign coming out his mouth. He’s never thought that, not once. He’s grown up with it, with Harry. He saw her struggle against it, then struggle with it, too. There was no choice there, no deliberate self-delusion. He thinks of himself, then firmly squashes down the thought. Pay attention, he reminds himself. “Which part did you find the most interesting?” he asks Sharon, and she’s off and running.
He’s not sure how to finish the question, but it’s okay. Sherlock swallows, then says, very directly, “I want to touch you.”
“Oh – I found it in your pocket when I gave the lady your clothes and plugged it in to charge,” Sherlock says. He nods with his chin to the desk in the corner. “It’s over there.”
I huff out a laugh as he nuzzles in behind my ear (God, he’s such a cuddler! I frankly love it!). “Good morning,” I say. “Can’t wait for me to finish my piss?”
“No, not yet, but we will soon. We’re nearly there.” Sherlock looks out his window, drumming his fingers on his knee, clearly impatient to begin.
“I heard that,” Sherlock says, swinging his long legs down to the floor, then standing up. “What should we have for dinner?”
It works. “Yes, for what we did this morning,” Sherlock says a bit archly, glancing around them as he does. “But I was thinking that for more… in depth activities, it might prove rather necessary to have something more specifically suited to the task. If I may.”
“Don’t worry about it,” John says, still uncomfortable. They’re seated in a corner, but even out of the direct light it strikes John afresh just how bloody attractive Corey actually is. For a split second, jealousy surges through his veins all over again, thinking of Corey touching Sherlock, putting his mouth on Sherlock’s cock – but he pushes this down hard. Nothing the two of them have done together has any bearing on what he and Sherlock have. They love each other, and that trumps absolutely anything that’s come before, for either of them. Corey has never seen Sherlock giggling helplessly in discovery of how ticklish his ribcage is, every line of his face crunched into laughter, tears leaking from his eyes as he begs for mercy, nor the predatory light in his eyes before he turns the tables and tackles his offender. John almost smiles at the memory in spite of himself, remembering Sherlock’s arms like pillars around his shoulders, his own verbal challenge in asking what Sherlock planned to do next. And then how Sherlock answered, entirely non-verbally. No: it doesn’t matter anymore. The competition is over, if it was ever even on. John exhales and makes his shoulders settle. “What can I do for you?” he asks, satisfied to hear his voice come out evenly.
until John finally inhaled to say something, then cut him off. “She’s right, you know,” he said quietly, with as little inflection as possible. “You do spend all of your time here.”
“It’s not all about what I want,” Sherlock counters. “Is there anything you’d particularly like to try, that we haven’t yet? Or that we have? I’m… open.”
He swoops in to kiss Sherlock, rolling onto him, arms digging under his back to hold him as tightly as possible, and Sherlock kisses back with surprising abandon. “Me too – I’m in love with you, too,” John gets in, between kisses. “You’re everything to me, you know!”
Sherlock takes a deep, not quite steady breath, his pulse thudding through his skin. “Okay,” he says, very uncertainly.
Sherlock smiles. “We could have taken public transit,” he says, shifting the subject. “But then I wouldn’t have had a chance to show off my German in front of you.”
John gives him a look that’s full of something dark and unspoken, but their current triumph is what prevails. “Do you want to do the honours?” he asks.
It was a moot point in the end: the very next week, he and John were sent to Dartmoor and from then on in it was nonstop until Moriarty’s trial, and everything that transpired from that until Sherlock’s ultimate fall from grace. He knew it on the phone, heard it in his own, broken laugh as John’s anger fell away, replaced by an unwavering confidence in him. (If only he had known how much John believed in him before that point.) He’d known then that Chris had been right: he was in love with John. But by that point, it hadn’t mattered. It was too late.
Sherlock’s eyes sweep down to his midsection and stop there, his pulse actually visible in his chest now, his lips falling open a little. He swallows again, then bends to step awkwardly out of his black briefs, his cock flushed and hard, bobbing upward, and John’s mouth fills with saliva at the very sight of it. (Jesus. How could he have ever believed for even three seconds that he didn’t want this, wasn’t attracted to it? It was a lie from the very start.) Sherlock says his name, rather uncertainly, and that’s got to stop: the uncertainty. He needs Sherlock to know that he can be certain about this. Needs it for his own sake, too, maybe. And if he can’t quite say it, then at least he can show it, damn it. John reaches for him, pulling Sherlock flush to him, and it works. Their mouths come together hungrily, chests and stomachs and cocks all touching, their hands stroking unabashedly down each other’s back to grip lower, exploring and squeezing and John thinks that he’s never in all his life been as turned on as he is at this very second.
“No!” The word leaves Sherlock’s mouth with force, before he can filter it. “That’s the last thing I want,” he adds, less forcefully. “Just – stay.” A moment goes by. “Please.” This last deepens his humiliation, but it was impossible to not say it.
“Indeed.” Sherlock looks out his window again. “What do you suppose all those people are queuing for?”
“John,” Mary says, in that tone of voice that suggests that she thinks he’s a complete dimwit, “you didn’t answer the question, or let me finish. Who do you think inspired the lunatic from East Finchley? Rupert Hidgens? There are dozens more out there, only the difference is that if they know I’m dead, they won’t just take Rosie – they’ll kill her.”
John can’t speak for a moment, his eyes stuck to Sherlock’s, feeling so much that he thinks he could implode. Then he surges forward and kisses Sherlock. They kiss for a long moment, mouths unyielding and demanding, and Sherlock’s hands find their way to his shoulders and squeeze. John gets his arms around Sherlock properly, and after a bit, Sherlock puts his around John all the way, too. John feels the stiffness seep out of Sherlock’s frame as they re-establish this very new thing between them. It feels good in a bone-deep, soul-satisfying way, their lips and tongues moving jointly, the kiss wonderfully deep. When they break apart, John is breathing heavily. “I know that,” he says, not caring to check himself. “I know how much you’d do for me – what you already have done for me. You’ve nearly died for me at least four times now, and everything Mary did – ”
Sherlock hears this and smiles against John’s lips. “What do you want us to do?” he asks over his shoulder. “We can make ourselves useful.”
Sherlock makes a sound that could be charitably described as keening, and doesn’t protest as John hauls him up to kiss him feverishly, his hand finding the unbearable hardness between Sherlock’s legs and already jerking him hard. Sherlock pants and moans and squeezes his eyes shut as the pleasure builds to intolerable new levels, unable to even try to pace it or hold back in any way as it overtakes him entirely, howling out his body and mouth both, his body discharging in a wet rush all over John, who doesn’t seem to care at all, teeth and tongue and lips on Sherlock’s neck. When it’s finally over, Sherlock feels dazed, coming to himself with John’s fingers in his hair, stroking through his curls almost obsessively, and Sherlock sees another large piece of it clearly at last: that John truly feels as much for him as Sherlock does for him.
, Sherlock. Never then. I agree – those were always the times I felt the most sure about this, including this morning. It’s just the other times when the doubt would come back.”
Vee shakes her head. “The experience changed him, not the drug. The grief changed him. Perhaps you don’t know this, but he lost Victor Trevor before he was hospitalised. He came in for lunch one day and told us that he couldn’t find Victor, couldn’t see him anymore. He’d already been crying himself to sleep over Redbeard every night. Perhaps he had begun to suspect that his beloved dog was dead. Perhaps he had begun to suspect who was behind it. That kind of grief is too much for a seven-year-old, and Sherlock was – different. Special. So transparent, so sensitive.”
Sherlock smiles, almost more to himself than to John. “Yes. I think we should.” He pulls out into their narrow road and drives until John directs him onto the A19 to Sunderland.
“I know. Don’t be stuffy,” Sherlock says, which is his usual, brisk line. “Come on. I’ll show you the other colleges before we head back. We should still be in plenty of time for the orientation at half-past four.”
“Would it be all right if I waited downstairs, in the sanctuary?” John asks. “It’s just easier if we can come together.”
“Not that I know of. I’m sure he has other things to do. People to see. Someone like him must,” Sherlock says, not sounding as though he’s particularly bothered by this. “If he wants to respond, then I suppose he will.” He changes the subject. “Are you hungry?”
The door opens and he appears, naked and looking like a god. His eyes focus on me and his face brightens immediately. He comes back over to the bed and gets back under the blankets, sliding over to me. “You’re awake,” he says.
Sherlock turns his smile on me, and it’s warm. “I remembered,” he repeats. He shrugs again. “So I thought we should make it.”
They finish undressing hastily, not taking their eyes from each other, then pull each other back into one another’s arms, touching everywhere now, and Sherlock can hardly breathe. The sheer intimacy of it is almost too much stimulation to handle, every nerve ending firing simultaneously, his mouth and hands as occupied as his brain. They stumble over to the bed somehow and fall into it, shoving the blankets aside, John on top of him, and Sherlock finds himself harder than he even knew he could be, his penis harder than steel and flushed darkly, rubbing directly against John’s, pleasure shivering through every part of his body but specifically concentrated there. John is thrusting against him, moaning softly, the muscles of his arse flexing and releasing under Sherlock’s hands. “… more, please…” he breathes, like a prayer, and John makes a sound of pained acquiescence and moves faster, harder.
Sherlock nods. “Yeah.” His face drops then, kissing John again, and John can’t stop touching the bare skin of his back, finally allowing his hands to rove lower onto the firm, warm curve of Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock moans into his mouth, his chest and stomach contracting as he breathes hard, and John’s cock gives a sharp twitch, hardening still more against the length of Sherlock’s. John hesitates, then slips his hands down inside Sherlock’s pyjamas and squeezes his arse. Sherlock breaks away from the kiss, panting. “John – I don’t – ”
He looks over at Sherlock to see if this will make him smile, but he doesn’t react apart from the crease that appears at the bridge of his nose. He looks as though he wants to say something, but avoids making eye contact and just makes a non-committal sound. He accepts his mug of tea from John, then says, “Shall we watch the news?”
Breathing isn’t supposed to be this hard. “I’ve – never known if it was – time,” I say jerkily. “The right time. If it was ever going to be the right time.”
John gets up and comes over, sitting gingerly down on the small loveseat, as far from Sherlock as he can manage. “No, we haven’t seen it. Not in person, at least. Why?”
He goes back to the room to hang up their jackets, but it’s thinly-disguised hope of finding Sherlock there, having a brief exchange of explanations of who was where and when, then ideally having some sort of slightly-awkward, but overall good conversation confirming that what happened last night was good, that they’d both be up for continuing this sort of thing for the indefinite future, and then at some point they’d kiss again, and maybe even solve the case together.
That does it: the mood immediately lightens and John snickers. “That’s true enough,” he admits. “Have I mentioned lately how hot you look in that apron?”
“Has it really always been me?” John asks, a bit wistfully. “Even after everything I put you through?”
Sherlock’s smile widens. “I was hoping you would say that,” he says breezily, and moves closer to kiss John. It goes on, growing and deepening. At some point Sherlock takes the brandy glass from him and sets it down, and John finds himself in Sherlock’s lap, looming over him, Sherlock looking up at him, his cheeks flushed with arousal. “Take me to bed,” he says breathlessly, and John nods, kissing him again.
“Yes!” It’s very enthusiastic and John guides him a little further back so that they can both do it, reaching into each other’s pyjamas to get their hands around one another’s erections. The sensation of both touching John this way and having John touch him like this is very nearly overwhelming, balanced only by his own desperate need to show that he is capable of this, to make it worth his while, make it feel as good as John’s touch is making him feel. The pleasure is coalescing like a planet forming, his entire body jangling with it, reverberating with it, yet Sherlock finds himself utterly fascinated by the progress of John’s arousal cycle, by the fluid leaking hotly into his palm. This is proof, laboratory proof of John’s desire for him. The entire bedroom is filled with the sounds of their kissing, punctuated by moans and breathy affirmations, and then John’s voice suddenly crescendos. “Sh – I’m going to –
She hasn’t seen him this snappish or brittle in ages. “No need to take my head off,” she says mildly. “I’m just asking, as your friend. You seem a bit… tense. And I sort of wondered why John’s not helping you on this one, if it’s so important.”
John looks at him for a long moment. “I didn’t help, by blaming you for it,” he says, feeling his gut twist. “I drove you to it as much as she did, by shutting you out. I’m sorry, Sherlock. I know I said it before, but since the past has been dragged up again, it needs saying again. I’m so sorry.”
They eat the rest of their delicious meal and when it’s over, John gets up to put on the kettle. They perform a cursory clean-up, then drink their tea with the news on, both of them sitting on the sofa, since the television is still on the coffee table from earlier. Throughout it all, Sherlock thinks that he can’t be imagining that he feels undeniably closer to John, that somehow this day has been drawing them inevitably nearer to one another. He couldn’t possibly say it, or the indefinable magic of it would evaporate, but it’s nonetheless there in the way John stands closer to him as they rinse off their plates and put the leftover food away, as he passes him a cup of tea, their fingers touching again, eyes meeting. He sits down first on the sofa and when Sherlock sits next to him, only a few inches away, John doesn’t shift over. Sherlock is heart-thuddingly aware of every single particle of it, of whatever it is that seems to be building between them.
They steer each other to the bed, falling onto it, crawling over each other, mouths never separating for longer than a few seconds at a time, both of them breathing hard as their arms and legs tangle together, heat gathering in every negative space between them. John feels somehow three times more naked than he’s ever felt before. Every single emotion is right there at the surface, his skin throbbing with it, inseparable from his intense desire for Sherlock, desire that’s spiking out of him from every pore. Every place that they’re touching is part of it this time, his entire being part of it. Before, it was always mostly about his cock. This is a full-body experience like he’s never known before, his heart pounding against the flat planes of Sherlock’s perfect torso.
“I was called to testify, naturally enough. Jeremy is, too, and he invited us to come to this. When I called Justin and Thom to make sure it was all right, they invited us to stay with them until the trial is finished.”
“So you want us to investigate,” Sherlock states, levelling his brother with his gaze. “What aren’t you saying? What are you so hesitant about asking us for?”
John agrees and fits his fingers back into Sherlock’s. “Lead the way,” he says, and they go. This is perfect, he thinks, feeling immensely satisfied with how life has very suddenly turned itself around. They’ll give themselves this little holiday. Later on, he’ll call Kate Whitney and give her a head’s up. They’ll sort out how to make it all work, at Baker Street. When this is done, they’ll go back to London, get Rosie, and then they’ll go home. Together, at last.
Sherlock shrugs, looking a bit self-conscious. “This. Not having anything on. Having time to cook like this. Nothing on the schedule for tomorrow. The… free time. It’s odd.”
Horton is still glaring at us. Sherlock takes a step toward me, then puts his hands on my face and kisses me fiercely, right in front of everyone.
The door opens and Sherlock walks in. He looks well, Mycroft notes immediately: his eyes are clear and he looks ten years younger. He looks less worn, the lines around his eyes eased in a way Mycroft hasn’t seen before. Sherlock is drawn up to his full height, his lips pressed together, his bearing almost forbidding in his coat. For a moment, he just stands there, looking down at Mycroft and Mycroft waits. Sherlock has to be the first one to speak. He’s the one who’s come here after having disowned him nearly three weeks ago: clearly he’s got something to say.
Sherlock’s lips compress again, but he nods, actually looking a bit relieved. “All right,” he says. He glances into John’s eyes. “So: eye contact first,” he says.
Sherlock makes absolutely no response to this, however, not even acknowledging that John’s said anything.
Sherlock absorbs this but doesn’t respond. “Let’s talk about your staff,” he says. “Any problems there? Any conflicts or major personal life disruptions?”
“And yet it’s still completely with you,” John returns, his voice firm. “I’ve seen your scars. The evidence of what was done to you is there under my fingertips every day of our lives.”
“He must really want something,” Sherlock says, waving this off. “Coming all the way out here. You know he thinks that anything past the A501 as being more or less jungle.”
“Oh, it did,” John assures him. He stops as their appetizers are served. They cut into the steaming hot prawn rolls and pork dumplings and begin to eat. “The thing is,” John says, holding up a piece of dumpling on his fork as though inspecting it, “I never was sure how serious any of it was to you. For all I knew, it could have just been the way we joke around. Let Lestrade and them think whatever they want. Or sometimes I even thought, maybe that’s just how our friendship is now: safely platonic, so that it doesn’t even matter if our feet touch or we’re in each other’s space. I didn’t know what you thought about any of it.”
John shrugs. “It was… brief. I think Sherlock said he was going to bed, then asked what I was going to do. I think I sort of asked what he wanted, because I couldn’t get a read of any of it, and he said that I knew what he wanted. And reiterated that he wanted me to stay, but only if I wanted to. So I just sort of followed him to his bedroom, more or less.”
He stops, and John nods at the pavement again, still unable to look at him, but beyond ready to own all of it at last. “Yes! It was all that stuff I should have said from the very start,” he says fiercely. “I
“Did you get him?” John asks, stitching up the wound in the loo, grateful that Mrs Hudson was able to come up to feed Rosie and get her dressed while he looks after Sherlock, at least. At the same time, he’s furious with himself for not having been there.
He hears John’s short laugh. “All right.” He appears a few moments later with a tea tray, not just the pot and two mugs in his other hand the way he normally would. He sets it down on the coffee table and pulls it closer. The table is still covered with dust but it doesn’t matter. “There we are,” John says, settling back onto the sofa, a little closer this time. “The point I was trying to get to was making a real, proper apology for what I did that day. And I’m including the leaving part.”
“Probably around ten or eleven,” John says. “Doesn’t matter if you’re up yet. You don’t mind if I bring her?” he asks, hefting the baby carrier.
Mary shakes her curls out of her face. “Oh goodness, yes. Dozens of times. I’ve never liked labels, you know? Besides, it comes in handy to have a nice, wide skill set.”
As for their relationship existing merely as a harmless fiction that all parties involved were eager to believe, it stopped being that the day Mary shot Sherlock. After that, Sherlock had thought – foolishly, he realises now – that it could very well be the end of John’s ill-conceived marriage. He welcomed it, yet he had to keep John safe until he recovered sufficiently from Mary’s wrath, should she become violent. He thought that John would stay with him, both in the hospital, then at Baker Street for the duration of his recovery, and he had. He’d let himself hope that it would last.
Mrs Hudson turns back to Sherlock and rolls her eyes at him. “How gracious of you,” she says, though there’s real amusement behind it.
Sherlock looks down at it, then comprehends. “John – ” He looks up into John’s face, astonished. It’s one thing to say that they’re basically – but to actually have John ask –
He throws himself into the client chair with a graceful flop of limbs. “Where shall we start today?” he demands without preamble. “The death of my family dog? My older brother’s overbearing, manipulative ways – though, of course, you would know plenty about that by now, wouldn’t you – or should we talk about you? What was your childhood like, Ms – what’s your last name? I’ve forgotten. Actually, forgot your first name, too.”
“I don’t think so. Just hot,” Sherlock says. He bends forward to pull the plug, then stands up, holding the towel in front of him, but there’s still a
John looks over, too. Sherlock is feigning reading a magazine now, but John sees straight through it. “Oh?” he says lightly. “All right, then. Thank you.”
“I’m not ruling it out.” Sherlock watches the numbers descend, then walks into the lift when the doors open. “I’m not ruling anything out. We have so little else to go on.”
His own eyes are closed, rocking hard against Sherlock’s spurting cock and then it’s upon him, bursting out of him, his heartbeat in his ears like a rushing wind as he comes and comes and can’t stop coming.
“It’s – good,” Sherlock says, panting, then realises he needs to say more. “It’s – everything I’ve ever wanted, John – ”
“John – ” Sherlock sounds agonised. “I want to – be able to handle this, next time. If there is a next time. I want to know what to do. I know it’s asking a lot, but you did say that you would teach me… would that extend to this?”
“I get that,” John says, meaning it. He picks up his own mug and takes a sip of tea. It’s a genmaicha, a green tea roasted with brown rice, and doesn’t need milk. It’s one of Sherlock’s favourites and he can understand Sherlock having this rather novel experience of having had some form of sex with what John supposes is his new boyfriend (does three dates make it a relationship?), then coming home to make one of his go-to favourite teas. It’s comfort. And maybe that’s what John is for him right now, too: comfort. The best friend and coach, there to help him process the entire experience. John feels another strong surge of warmth toward Sherlock. “I’m glad you liked it,” he says gently. “That’s great, Sherlock. Really great.”
His plan makes sense. “Right, yeah,” John says, nodding. “And then I presume we make ourselves seen in workshops or something again, like you said.”
Sherlock shakes his head again. “He wanted to. I just – wanted to come home, though. I mean, I usually eat with you.”
The picnic is a success all around. In the end, Mrs Hudson wasn’t even put out by John getting Rosie up himself, and is delighted at the notion of a picnic. She volunteers to make her egg salad without even being prompted, causing Sherlock to look over at John behind her back, the crinkles around his eyes deepening, his mouth smirking in a way that makes John want to kiss it all the more. Mrs Hudson sends him off to the bake shop around the corner to get a fresh baguette for the sandwiches and says that she’ll pop down and make a batch of brownies to bring along, and instructs them to make a salad of some sort. Sherlock does this on his own while John is out, concocting a tomato cucumber salad that’s easy to eat on a picnic, and puts together a bag of Rosie’s things as well as a blanket he’s found somewhere. They find a quiet spot near the boating lake and John spreads the blanket out under a leafy tree that provides plenty of shade. Mrs Hudson feeds Rosie egg salad and lets her tackle the tomatoes and cucumbers on her own. Later, after she and John have jointly cleaned the remainder of her brownie from her sticky fingers, Mrs Hudson takes her off to visit the ducks she loves so much. Sherlock stretches out on his back on the blanket, his eyes closed, arms folded behind his head.
. Time has helped already, at least when it comes to the two of them. They’re light years from where they were a year ago: John miserable and drinking heavily, avoiding everyone including his daughter, singling Sherlock out for his blame. Sherlock high and obsessed with Culverton Smith, with provoking a serial killer into adding him to his list by way of finding some way to save John from the hell he’d seemingly helped create for him, or at least he’d believed that then. Now John’s hand is gentle on his arm, saying something about the carrots that they’ve forgotten to chop, and Sherlock looks at him and thinks again that it’s a bit of a miracle that they’ve got to this place from that other one. It’s been slow. It’s taken time. But they’re getting there. Somewhere.
He cups Sherlock’s face with his hands again, making Sherlock feel so cared for, so much like he’s the only thing in the world that matters for John at all right now, that he can barely speak. He puts his hands on top of John’s and tries not to combust with emotion on the spot.
It’s so unfiltered that John’s heart throbs in his chest. “I know,” he says, trying to pulls all of his own walls down in turn. “I feel the same way. I just want this.”
John shakes his head. “I don’t know how long. Over an hour. When I came to myself again, I was sitting on the floor, and all I could think about was Sherlock, how much more I must be hurting him. I’ve… rarely loathed myself more. So I made myself get up, pull myself together, and go back into the room.” He pauses and swallows. “I asked if he was still awake, and if I could try again, and he said I could, to my relief, and he let me put my arm around him. And that made things feel… better, at least.”
He’s aware that it must just be a temporary fix. Sherlock’s trauma flare-up will settle down again, and at some point he’ll say so, so that he’ll be fine sleeping on his own again,
He means his clothes, which he didn’t say, but thankfully John still has more than a handful of brain cells functioning. He nods hurriedly and hastily gets Sherlock’s jacket and shirt unbuttoned, pausing only long enough to haul his own jumper over his head. He resumes kissing Sherlock even as his fingers begin to work at getting Sherlock’s trousers open while Sherlock fumbles at his jeans. There’s a moment of kicking and then they’re both in their underwear, bodies pressed together, both of their erections unmistakable and hard. John’s entire body is giving off heat, nowhere more than there, and Sherlock is swooning with it.
Sherlock smiles up the length of John’s torso, his eyes turning to impish crescents. “Obviously. Everything else, I could see or deduce. More or less.”
“She’s coming now,” Mycroft says, surveying the sky, and Sherlock sees it: the hazy black dot of the approaching helicopter.
John blinks, studying him for a moment, then seems to grasp his difficulty. “I’m not fussy,” he says, rubbing his hand over Sherlock’s bare back. “I want to touch you, or have you touch me, or both. Yeah. Both. But no pressure. It doesn’t have to be – I don’t want you to feel like you’re under a microscope or on an examining table or something. It can just be like this. And we can make it darker, if you want.”
Sherlock frowns at him. “Did you read that?” he asks, nodding at the pamphlet in John’s hand. “It stipulates that there are workshops about conversion therapy, finding ‘appropriate marriage partners for your children’, ‘resisting societal acceptance of perversion’, and other such rot.”
“Sorry! It’s just me!” he says from the lookout. There’s a camera dangling from an apparatus of some sort, hanging out over the ravine. Sherlock could almost reach out and touch it, but it’s about four metres from the railing of the bridge. Kyle retracts the camera and explains. “I thought I heard shouting from up there – voices really carry in here, you know – so I was going to come down and just check that everything was okay, but then it got quiet and I thought maybe everything was fine, so I went back to get this stuff and just test it out before tomorrow. Is everything all right?”
“Let’s explore and see what we find,” John proposes. Sherlock agrees, and suddenly it begins to feel like a bit of a vacation as well as a case. They head back down the way they came and ignore the crowds milling about the foyer, queuing to register for the conference, and weave their way down the front steps and back onto the streets of Cambridge’s charming old city. The air is crisp and cool, but not unpleasantly cold and John’s first thought is that this is much better without dragging a suitcase behind him.
He’s there waiting for her at the station when she gets off the train. Mycroft must have phoned him, then, Vee deduces. She gives him a tired smile, the best she can muster, and lets him pull her into his arms for a brief hug and a kiss on the cheek. He says something about a cup of tea when they get home, and she demurs, saying that she’s worn out and needs a nap, that she’s already swimming in tea, and he doesn’t argue. His gentle blue eyes, eyes that Sherlock alone inherited, are full of worry and compassion and tenderness in one and she tells herself again how lucky she is to have him. He’s no fool: Sherlock gets his emotional intelligence from him. They’ve always made the mistake in valuing her intellect over Desmond’s emotional perception, his acuity tempered by gentleness. Perhaps Eurus didn’t. Perhaps that was precisely where she gained the power to play such vividly cruel games with her brothers, particularly Sherlock, punishing him for the childhood slight of preferring his own imagination to his pestering younger sister.
Perhaps she’s already decided that Sherlock’s out of her league and that she’d have a better chance with him, John reflects dryly. “This is great, thanks,” he says, briskly enough to put her off the idea of trying to flirt with him. The last thing he needs is for Sherlock to get all prickly and closed on him again.
Sherlock raises his face to look him in the eye, his lips set, his gaze intense. “I want,” he says. “And in the interest of full disclosure, I’m fairly certain that also signifies – or confirms, perhaps – my interest in… having more than just your fingers there. If I may.”
“No, you asked if I would be all right,” Sherlock corrects him. About an hour has passed. “I’m fine.”
Rosie is in her carrier on the kitchen floor, asleep. John’s put the kettle on, Sherlock notes with pleasure. “I went to the lab,” he says, sidestepping the awkward subject of having John in his bedroom. “I thought I should see Molly.”
John’s hesitation gives him away. “You have to admit that you let all of that go very quickly,” he says, his shoulders taking on a mutinous set in anticipation of Sherlock’s response. “Maybe too quickly. All that shit I put you through – I still feel like I don’t deserve this, or that there’s something missing in terms of me making that up to you somehow. I guess that’s a big part of what this is about.”
public display following the bomb explosion, photos of which appeared in multiple papers for several days afterward, John’s hands very much on his backside, his tongue in Sherlock’s mouth, John only laughed and said it was time the world knew and that it would spare them having to tell people one-by-one. Sherlock managed to keep his inward marvel off his face when he said this and merely put his arms around John again.
Naked, they sway together in the sitting room, filling it with the sounds of their kissing. Later, there will be time for profound conversations and a serious reflection on what very nearly could have happened today. Right now, all they need is this: each other, in a deeper and even more binding way than they’ve yet had. Once this has happened, Sherlock knows he will never be afraid to ask John for any of this again. This is the last barrier, the last small piece of denied territory. He can feel John’s erection hard against his own, everything about its very existence making that of his own arousal safe, welcome, wanted. Needed, even. Permission: this is still a novelty, being allowed to touch John this way, allowed to kiss him as though it’s the very oxygen he needs to live. He thinks of John looking up at him from the foot of the steps, holding the backpack and its bomb in his bare hands, of sharing the knowledge that they will always be ready to do this work together, to die doing it if they have to. Of John choosing that moment to tell him that he loves him without caring that at least nine other people could hear him. His heart seems to swell within his thoracic cavity almost to the point of splitting his ribs open. “I need you,” he says against John’s mouth. “I need – every part of you. More than anything.”
“Good,” John says. They fall silent then, making their way through increasingly dense forest, instinctively making as little sound as possible. When they’ve reached the access road which Lestrade thinks Rutherford could use for his getaway, they stop. There is a ridge slightly above the road that will afford them some cover, so John spreads out the blanket and settles himself on his front to wait.
Sherlock blinks and searches for a response to this but cannot come up with one. He doesn’t know whether or not he’s managed to reassure John in any way. Eventually, enough time goes by that it seems evident that he is not going to respond, and John doesn’t say anything else, either.
John opens his mouth as though he’s going to protest this, but then shuts it firmly and nods again, and sets off down the corridor without further speech.
, damn it! Is Sherlock sitting there, wondering what the hell that was? Did he like it at the time, but now he’s thinking of how much complication and difficulty it would be for them to have something like that between them? That sort of relationship? Did he kiss back on instinct and has come to his logical senses now, reminding himself that sentiment is a chemical defect found on the losing side, like he used to say all the time? Does he not know what he thinks or wants or feels? John feels helpless to grasp even the first notion of what might be going through his head right now.
Sherlock comes to his rescue a few minutes later, somehow escaping from his own conversation and appearing at his side. “Have you got your schedule?” he asks John, with an apologetic so-sorry-to-have-interrupted look to Sharon.
“He drove me,” Sherlock says. “He’s rented a car. He sent his security people home for the night and said he would drive me. The restaurant has a cloak room, though, and when I told him there weren’t any cameras in it – there was one over the entrance, but not inside – he kissed me in there. It’s actually sort of fun, avoiding the cameras. You and I are particularly adept at it, but he’s also pretty good at keeping himself from being spotted.”
John knows exactly what he’s talking about already. “Yeah?” he asks, his own voice punctured with breath and audible arousal.
Phil nods. “The sooner it’s served, the better, but otherwise, yes. Are you sure it’s safe? When I got your call, I didn’t know what to think.”
Maybe it’s partly because he’s still half-asleep himself and not thinking clearly, but all John can feel is dismay at the loss of Sherlock’s touch, of Sherlock’s arms and legs and very-hard cock. He follows instinctively, mirroring Sherlock’s move as though drawn to him magnetically, protesting aloud without even realising it. “No – it’s okay – ” His arm goes around Sherlock automatically, feeling rigid tension throughout his frame. He’s probably embarrassed, John knows, but it’s fine – it’s more than fine. “Let me,” he murmurs, already rubbing at Sherlock’s chest in a way he’s never allowed himself to before. He waits to see whether Sherlock will reject this, push him away or leave the bed or something, but he doesn’t, so John lets his hand travel down Sherlock’s torso to cup between his legs.
Scott appears then and drops down onto the sofa on Jeremy’s other side. “Did I hear my name?” he asks lightly, leaning over to kiss Jeremy on the cheek, simultaneously putting an arm around his shoulders.
His palm is pressing into Sherlock’s erection, fingers skating tantalisingly over the straining tightness of his testicles while his left hand fumbles at the button of Sherlock’s trousers. Sherlock’s heart is thundering now, and when John slips his hand down the front of his underwear to touch him, he nearly passes out, breaking away from the kiss with a shuddering inhalation, his mouth staying open after. Undeterred, John attacks his neck and throat with his mouth as Sherlock stands there, gasping and moaning helplessly as John’s fingers curl around him and stroke over and over again.
?” Sherlock repeats. “What about yourself are you doubting? What is it, John? What could it possibly be, after everything we’ve worked through already? What haven’t we talked about?”
,” Sherlock snarls, lifting his head. There is mucus leaking from his nose and possibly saliva from his mouth. Between that and the tears, his face is a reddened swamp. “I need
“You genius,” John says admiringly. He comes around the table and puts his hands on Sherlock’s hips. “Come to bed with me. Leave the rest of this; I’ll clean up in the morning, or whenever we get up. Or Mrs Hudson will. I need to feel you in my arms again, touch you everywhere, feel you connected to me. Because we do have this. We didn’t wreck it or miss our chance to have it before it was too late, no matter what happened. This is me being in the moment and loving what I have right in front of me. I love you – I love you fiercely, Sherlock. So come to bed.”
Sherlock sighs. “All right, go from the top: you were in the city – from where, by the way? I don’t believe you’ve said.”
So he offered chips. It was a spur of the moment idea. He remembers Chris’ turn of phase about the shelves and uses it, but Molly doesn’t seem to recognise the expression, either, and remains innocently hopeful. They part ways and he goes anyway, and knows then why he’s really going. It’s desperation that pushes open the door of the chip shop, desperation to be seen and known and wanted again, desperation urged by the last thing he heard John say to him last night, possibly forever. When he sees someone else behind the counter, Sherlock stops short and almost leaves. Instead he stands by the door and listens to the older man serving the customers, his tone familiar, exchanging quips and bits of information, and knows that he has worked there for a long time now. Eventually the queue dies down and the proprietor calls him over, so Sherlock goes. He’s in a chip shop and he hasn’t eaten all day; he might as well order. He does so, briefly, then asks about Chris.
“Hello Molly,” Sherlock says, striving to keep his tone congenial, the better to pave the way smoothly. “I wondered if you might have a moment to chat.” He attempts to deliver this without making it sound facetious. “Are you busy?”
Sherlock smiles. He should respond, but Kyle appears over his shoulder and says that they should get their speeches done and let people get dancing. He agrees, catches John’s eye, and they go back up to the head table.
“Yes, all right,” Sherlock says. He takes out his laptop and sets it on the table. “What else is on the agenda?”
He’s curious, then. Interesting. I tamp down my instinctive dislike for the man – I might have just imagined that sneer, I remind myself – and go sit down in my chair across from him, since Sherlock hasn’t sat in it. Sherlock pulls over one of the desk chairs and sits down next to me, and we wait for the man to speak. Suddenly I wonder if he doesn’t look a little familiar, but there’s absolutely nothing memorable about his bland face. It’s a face you could see anywhere, one that would blend into any crowd.
Vee pushes herself to her knees with difficulty, then stoops to pick up the bucket of mulch she’s spread in the vegetable patch and takes it to the little shed in the corner of the garden. The sun is beginning to sink toward the horizon, so it must be coming on five or so. Hard to believe it’s already been three weeks since the demise of Mary Morstan, not three kilometres from her own house. She closes the shed doors and locks them, just in case someone has a mind to make off with Desmond’s new lawnmower, then goes inside to make herself a cup of tea before supper.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Whatever you decide you want is fine with me. If you want to have her with us full-time, we’ll have to make arrangements, obviously, but she’s your – responsibility, I suppose we should say. And obviously David will have to have a say in the entire matter. When we find Mary, she should be charged for child abandonment. It’s a crime when the child is under the age of two.” He transfers his gaze to Molly. “What makes you think that she’s never coming back?”
Everyone (apart from the thief) laughs, Lestrade clapping Sherlock jovially on the back. Seeing anyone else touch Sherlock, even in this simple way, makes John feel unreasonably jealous. For a moment, his shameful desire to keep their entire situation hidden wars with his other desire to lay a very public claim to Sherlock that will leave no doubt in anyone’s mind as to their status and mutual claim on one another. It’s Sherlock’s half-apologetic glance at him that pushes John to the (correct) side of the equation, though. Sherlock specifically said earlier, in a statement that probably let on more than he meant to in terms of his subconscious and unspoken wish, that he was hardly expecting John to kiss him in front of everyone. Well. Maybe he should just do exactly that, then! Lestrade is still patting Sherlock’s back in a way that’s wholly platonic, nothing to get jealous over, but it helps bolster John’s resolve.
John shakes his head, though. “No. Look at the forest behind us: it’s far too thick. He’d have to take the road, especially if he’s in a hurry. Get down here.”
“It already is,” Sherlock tells him, and John lowers his head to kiss him again. They’re moving together instinctively, touching everywhere, and Sherlock lets his hands wander freely, trying to touch as much of John as possible.
“Yes,” Sherlock says vaguely. He looks up at the railing above. “Would you take us up there, please?”
Lestrade thanks him and echoes his advice to parents and childcare professionals to keep a close watch, and promises an update when possible. They step down.
I turn around and find his mouth with mine, winding my arms around his shoulders. “Thanks for taking Rosie,” I say after. “You’re better with her than I am.”
John is having a hard time stifling his own level of arousal. He searches Sherlock’s eyes. “Yeah?” he asks. When Sherlock nods, teeth digging into his lower lip, John agrees. “Okay,” he says. In tacit understanding, they move to the bed. Sherlock hesitates, then removes his pyjama pants, leaving himself fully naked in the light for the first time. He’s hard, his erection pointing stiffly upward, his pulse is hammering through his pale skin now. Sherlock looks as vulnerable as if he just removed his entire skin along with his clothes, his hands moving nervously, so John hastily strips off his underwear to make things feel more even. “Get the lamp,” he says, his voice softer than he meant for it to come out, and very consciously aware of his own cock, pointing straight out from his body, released from the confines of his clothes. “I’ll just – deal with the light.”
Sherlock blinks, glad that John can’t see his face. “Okay. Good. Thank you,” he says, perhaps a bit stiffly, but that seems to satisfy John.
I grin. “Didn’t realise you were waiting to,” I say, already moving closer to him. I turn my face up in unabashed invitation and Sherlock kisses me in lieu of responding verbally, his hands gripping my shoulders.
Sherlock feels as though something hard has lodged itself in his throat. He understands, though. “But you have a child,” he says, the words coming with a bit of difficulty. “That changes everything.”
“I don’t want to go back to the clinic.” Now that it’s started, it’s hard to stop. “I don’t want to stay home all the time. I want to work with you again. That’s all I want.”
After, Sherlock says he’s going to take a shower and John doesn’t attempt to join him, thinking that maybe Sherlock is due for a slice of space to process it all. Instead, he tacitly wraps himself in one of Sherlock’s posh dressing gowns and goes down to get the papers and put some coffee on, trading places with Sherlock once he comes out of the loo. They make breakfast together and eat it at the desk with the news on the telly and it seems so very mundane on the surface, yet the happiness is just about bursting out of John at every seam.
John is disappointed, but Sherlock seems satisfied with this. “Good. Thank you,” he says briskly, and is abruptly finished with interrogating the lady. He turns and makes for the lifts again, John hurrying to keep up.
“Don’t use that name!” she hisses. Her eyes dart out into the darkened, empty street behind him. “You’d better come inside.” An arm shoots out, her fingers gripping his forearm with tendons of steel and John finds himself being unceremoniously hauled into the small dwelling without warning. Mary closes the door but leaves it unbolted and backs away, facing him from across the space.
“Yes, I know you did,” Mary says, and just like that, she sounds as tired as John did when he came to get Rosie. “Look: I’m sorry I didn’t tell you I was leaving. I had no time. That’s the truth. I barely even told
His brow knits a little as he pulls it out of his pocket, but his expression changes when he sees the caller ID. “Lestrade,” he says, holding the phone to his ear. He listens, eyes meeting John’s across the table. His lips tighten a little. “How long ago?” Then, “Good. Yes. It’s never too soon in the case of a kidnapping. We’ll be right there!”
John looks at Sherlock and they get to their feet. “I know this is going to be painful and difficult,” Sherlock says. “I’m sorry. We’ll keep you posted of every development as it occurs. You can let your staff know whatever they need to know, as you like.”
“Not to her safety,” Harry says firmly. “That’s not something you can compromise. It’s one thing for the two of you to be doing whatever you want, but not when you’ve got her there with you.”
came home at the end of the day. I meant every word of what I said at our first circle meeting. You were there for me like a rock. I only just finally saw that you always have been. None of the things I saw on the surface were the truth. You’ve done nothing but save me, over and over and over and over again since the day we met, and I haven’t deserved you by half. I still don’t.”
They wait for the judging. To no one’s surprise, Jeremy wins, with Justin coming in third and Thom fourth. To both Sherlock and John’s surprise, they each receive an honourable mention, which proves to be a second bottle of champagne and a box of fancy chocolates each. Pleased by this, they take themselves back to the north guest wing.
John looks over at the time, too, and heaves a sigh. “You’re probably right,” he admits. He looks back at Sherlock. “So what’s the plan for today? You’re checking Joe Biggs’ room, and I’m – what am I doing?”
Sherlock smiles, but then it fades a little. “Last night… I was very much in earnest when I asked you to marry me, though I realise I didn’t quite come out and say it in those words. Are you… were you entirely serious when you accepted?”
“I already know,” Sherlock says. “I’ve known for years. And he’s talked about you.” She hesitates a moment longer, and he adds, “Please.”
John puts his hand over Sherlock’s, still holding his face. “I know what you mean,” he says, his voice tight. “I never thought we’d get anywhere close to this. Didn’t stop me from wanting it, though.”
Sherlock smiles upward at the numbers ascending toward the twelfth storey. “I’ll show you,” he says.
John is kissing his throat, Sherlock’s head tipped back to allow it. “This okay?” John murmurs against his pulse point.
John laughs and shakes his head. “You’re phenomenal, you know. I’ve let myself in for a lifetime of having my every move pre-calculated before it’s even occurred to me.” Whoops. He didn’t quite mean to say the
John exhales hard. “Oh my God,” he says, his voice more than a little unsteady. “We are the two biggest morons in the universe. Sherlock – I’ve been dreading this month coming to an end, too. I’ve known since the very start that I never, ever wanted to leave your bed again. I’ve always known that I wanted what happened last night to happened. I wasn’t expecting any sort of reciprocation – all I wanted in the moment was to be allowed to touch you that way. And I was relieved to discover that
“Yes, I would think that that would improve everyone’s enthusiasm,” he agrees. Their meals are served then, distracting them.
A taxi slows at the kerb at his gesture and he gets inside. “Drive,” he orders. “Anywhere. Just drive.”
John considers this, lifting his mug to his lips and blowing on his tea. “Body language throughout,” he says, then sips. It’s still very hot. “You’re an expert on that. You know – does he lean toward you, is his body language open, does he laugh at your jokes. Does he touch you in any way. That sort of thing. In this case, I think you can safely assume general interest as a basic given here, since he’s asked you out. You can signal your own interest back in all the same ways.”
John was hoping for a slightly more hands-on guiding, but Sherlock doesn’t take the bait. He concentrates on folding the rest of the crane correctly, with Sherlock feeding him instructions, and succeeds in making something passable in the end. “Thanks,” he says, a bit stiffly.
John smiles at him. “I’ll wear that cashmere jumper you gave me. The one I wore the day of our session with Margaret.”
“Me too. I’ll just nip into the loo.” John does so, then comes out shaking water off his hands and zips up his coat. “Shall we?”
One day Sherlock is in the break room, pouring himself yet another cup of the Yard’s terrible coffee when John comes in, never far behind him.
“Fantastic,” Lestrade tells him, sounding like he means it. “We genuinely never would have got there without you. Both of you. It’s great to see you back on your feet and in this again – or at least, for this one. Thanks so much.”
Neither of them acknowledges this in the morning, or at any other point after that. The day is quiet, just routine things around the flat. Mrs Hudson has Rosie, but brings her up for lunch along with a steaming dish of baked ziti, oozing with cheese, and they all eat together. Sherlock starts an experiment on a moulding apple he found at the bottom of the basket, and John decides to go round to the shops and buy some fresher fruit. He asks if Sherlock would like to come, but he’s immersed in his petri dishes and declines. Later, they cook and watch the news and another episode of their series. That night, John gets himself ready for bed, waits for Sherlock to come to join him, then turns off his light, and moves over to put his arm around him right from the start this time. He makes a questioning sound, and Sherlock makes that same affirmative one he made the night before. And after that, it stops being a question.
oh. I get it. It’s anal lube. That’s still nothing suspicious, Sherlock. Maybe they were into that sort of thing. Lots of couples are.”
Another denial. “No. I’ve a flatmate. John.” Why had he said his name then? Was it some sort of desire, even then, to be known for who he really was? He does not know.
extremely private about it, evidently. But it was never about Irene. The kiss goes on and on, their arms wrapped tightly around each other. John feels as though he can’t get close enough to Sherlock, and Sherlock seems to be feeling the same way, their thighs pressed together, bodies touching down both their fronts. John can feel himself responding physically to this and hopes Sherlock won’t be put off by it. Now that it’s sure that Irene was never in the picture that way, he can be fairly certain again that Sherlock is fairly much completely inexperienced and doesn’t want to push anything on him before it’s time. But then Sherlock starts kissing a rather sensitive place on his neck and John gasps, blood rushing south and stiffening his erection almost painfully, his hips jerking forward in automatic response, pressing into Sherlock. He moans again, because Sherlock is hard, too, and feeling him like that – for real, not just in a dream – is unbelievable. John feels the sharpness of Sherlock’s inhalation, directly into his neck, and then his hands are sliding up the back of John’s t-shirt to grip his skin. John throws his head back, mouth open, and attempts to breathe and just hold on. Sherlock’s mouth descends on his throat and he thinks he might just shoot off in his pants if this keeps up. He hears himself say Sherlock’s name, and it comes out shaky and punctured with breath.
John seems to be breathing with difficulty, face turned down toward his knees. After a moment, he nods. “Yes,” he says heavily. He pulls his fingers out of Sherlock’s and grips his own hands. “Very much so.”
Now, however, his enthusiasm is showing no signs of flagging. He’s pounding into Sherlock, both of them moaning and trying to contain it for Rosie’s sake, bodies slapping together as John fucks Sherlock as hard as he knows how, both hands on Sherlock’s hips.
Sherlock’s face doesn’t move at all, except to blink once or twice. Then he inhales and says, very carefully, “It’s not a burden.” John opens his mouth to counter this, but Sherlock cuts him off before he can. “If I can help in the smallest of ways – for instance, in feeding your child and occupying her while you sleep, knowing that the reason you were lacking sleep in the first place was because of me, then I’m… grateful that you have allowed me to do so.” He drops his eyes back to the paper, clears his throat, then adds, “There’s coffee if you want it, and I just started breakfast. But if you’d like to shower first, I can hold it back.”
“Sausages,” Sherlock says. He nods toward the fridge. “I ordered some for us to try with the last online shop. No idea what they’ll be like.”
The man’s gaze transfers to me with a hint of something very much like a sneer in them, but he blinks and the look is gone before I can confirm the overt hostility I thought I saw there for a second. “I’ve been robbed,” he says coolly. “And you’re apparently the best for a job like that. The name’s Edger. Horace Edgar.”
His eyes are at half-mast, his tone gentle and relaxed, and Sherlock moves instinctively toward him, straddling his lap and putting his mouth to John’s. It still hasn’t stopped feeling like a miracle, he thinks. Getting to do this: hold John, kiss him, feel the way his body rises and responds to the proximity of his own, in unashamed, unabashed desire. The kiss stretches out and deepens, Sherlock’s knees clamping around John’s sides to better anchor himself as his own need grows. John’s hands are pressing into his back, holding him close and stroking rhythmically over his skin as they kiss. They’re both getting hard, their erections sliding and rubbing in the warm water. Sherlock thinks about logistics for two seconds, then lifts John bodily out of the tub and onto the ledge. John makes a surprised sound, holding onto Sherlock’s wet hair for balance, and the surprise turns fairly instantly into a moan of pleasure when Sherlock surrounds his penis with the heat of his mouth, his head dipping down to bob in John’s lap. He’s kneeling on the bench of the jacuzzi and the jet is hitting him in the lower belly and, depending on how he moves, his penis, and it feels surprisingly good. He finds himself moaning into John’s flesh, at the satisfaction and need to be doing this for John again, and at the rising pleasure in his own flesh.
Sherlock smirks now, catching my slight discomfort. “Why?” he asks, lowering his voice both in volume and in pitch, knowing what it does to me when he talks like that. “Do you like them?”
John types, then sends the message and looks up at him again. “So they take one partner and pawn him off into a sex ring in Russia, and do what with the other partner?”
The next morning’s headlines come as a surprise to John when he stoops to collect the papers from the front steps. It’s not in the
He tells me about his scars a little later without being asked, still curled around each other in bed, and I listen with horror, my arms tightening around him as he tells me more of the details of his time away. He tells it all with a certain detachment, but he also says that the entire thing felt somewhat unreal. “How so?” I ask, turning my head and brushing my lips against his temple.
“In terms of your willingness to admit to it?” John asks dryly. “I mean, you’re not wrong. I’m sure I would have gone on denying it if you had said something. I always did when people mentioned it, didn’t I?”
They look at each other. Sherlock doesn’t speak, so John does. “Five days ago. It was… during that breakdown, like I said. I… hadn’t been taking care of Rosie properly, and a friend – Molly – came and took her away. That, at least, shocked me into sobriety. I was still hungover when Sherlock came over. I hadn’t been answering his calls or texts. He just came anyway, let himself in, and somewhere in there it all came out. He knew they’d taken Rosie.”
A mental image of Sherlock and John together that way flashes through her mind and Molly feels as though she’s going to be ill. “But you said – you thought that Sherlock is – inexperienced,” she manages to get out around the red haze filling her mouth and eyes.
John looks down at himself as though appraising the situation. “I haven’t even thought about food in – too long. Yeah. I could eat. Actually… that’s a pretty appealing thought. Chinese?”
Molly watches him, not bothering him as he gets whatever it is into a proper test tube and slotted into the machine, punching in parameters. She’s got a cadaver open on the table in front of her (John Doe, found in a park), but Sherlock’s presence is a distraction. She goes on after a moment, taking a sample of bile from the gall bladder. Once the mass spectrometer has begun to whir, Sherlock doesn’t move, standing there and watching it intently. She knows that he’ll know, based on whatever the sample is, about how long to expect it to take, so she decides not to suggest he sit down to wait or something. “Hello, by the way,” she offers, more to break the silence than anything else.
a date, rather than a cautious first re-emergence into public following a major episode of trauma. He reaches over and nabs a blackberry from Sherlock’s plate. “How did you sleep, after all that?” he asks, trying to distract attention from the whole public sharing of food thing.
“No,” Sherlock says firmly. “I forced him to give me your whereabouts at gunpoint, you know. It’s not something I imagine he’ll have forgotten just yet.”
He doesn’t specify, but his fingers slip further back, and it becomes very clear what he wants to do. John nods, his eyes riveted to Sherlock’s. His heart is pounding, feeling strangely vulnerable in a way he’s never experienced before. “Yeah,” he says, his voice coming out a bit hoarsely. “D’you – do you want the – ?”
Sherlock’s heart begins to pound again, and for a moment he finds himself incapable of speech. He swallows, nodding. “Yes.
Mary still looks surprised. “Oh,” she says. “No, I don’t think it’s that. I don’t think he’s been solving any crimes lately.”
“Jesus,” John groans, once they’re gone. “This is ridiculous!” He lifts his face, which is red possibly both from having been lying face down as well as from embarrassment.
,” he reminds John. “And as it happens, I have all of those things. Including a car. It’s just a few streets over. Come on.”
“It’s so good – you’re – ” John can barely speak, he’s going so hard, and to hear him like this, sounding more turned on than he ever has before, ramps Sherlock’s arousal up still further.
Sherlock tries not to smile and fails. “You could say that,” he says, concentrating on filling his and John’s cups with tea.
, of course! I would marry you here and now, if you wanted that! But do they let people get married during Evensong?”
It’s not that I don’t know. How I feel, I mean. What I might want, with him. It’s just so complicated now. It should have happened right from the beginning, but I guess I was over-eager in asking. It was too soon, and then things just got more and more complicated. I had girlfriends. He’d already told me he was married to his work. He could have said that he was a workaholic, that he just didn’t have time, but he said that, married to his work, like I’d just proposed to him and he was explaining about a pre-existing spouse. He was kinder to me than I’ve ever seen him be with anyone else who hit on him, ever. Every time I think of that conversation, I wish I could go back in time and move it forward three or four or six months into the future. I should have let it develop naturally, instead of jumping the gun. And then I’m sure I didn’t help matters any by stubbornly insisting on telling everyone who ever met us how we weren’t a couple and that I wasn’t gay. Sherlock never said anything when those rumours came up. Not once. It didn’t occur to me to wonder if I hurt him with all of those denials until much later. Now, of course, I’m kicking myself for it.
“Oh, please,” John says crossly, his arm still around Sherlock’s back. “He doesn’t know anything; he was just flirting with you. Wasting your time when you need to be thinking about the case.”
He moves on again, commenting on the others, and when they’re not actively being directed to look at the other couples, John always reinstates their hug position, and Sherlock loves it. When they’re finally told to sit down again, they sit very close to each other on the loveseat and John takes his hand again, holding it tightly. Todd has them experiment with different ways to sit together for maximum intimacy. After that, they discuss sleeping positions, and if Sherlock and John contribute less to this particular conversation out of their own lack of related experience, no one seems to notice.
All I know now is that we’re back here, together, seemingly for good this time, and there are questions that would be obvious for any other two people. Maybe he thinks I’m straight and that he’s asexual and that therefore said questions have rendered themselves moot. Maybe he knows that I’ve thought about him obsessively, compulsively, over the years, and is just too kind to point it out. Kind: hardly the word one would normally use for Sherlock Holmes, except that I’ve finally come to see that he really can be when he wants to. Especially to me. So then: what?
Lestrade nods at the pamphlet with his chin. “It’s all in there. Exactly what it sounds like. Some big Republican outfit, from what I understand.” His gaze flicks over to meet John’s, his own amusement at Sherlock’s reaction on par with John’s.
It’s the first time they’ve spoken in at least an hour. “I was thinking I’d do something with that chicken breast we’ve got,” John says. “Maybe a stir-fry or something.”
Sherlock’s mother is watching him anxiously. “You’re not hesitating because of… because of Eurus, are you? Because we did so badly with her?”
John nods, joy swelling up from his very bones. “I’m all yours,” he vows, and Sherlock smiles. John decides to add something else, just for good measure. “And – if you want that sort of thing – fancy restaurants and museums and real, proper dates – we can do that stuff, you know. Be proper boyfriends or whatever. I’ll even go to the opera with you, if you want. Anything. Anything at all.”
Sherlock opens his eyes. They’ve darkened to sapphire and their slant makes him look particularly alluring at the moment, along with the curving smile on his lips. “Kissing
“You know,” John says quietly, looking down at the string he’s tying to a branch, “I don’t really mind a lot about all the stuff that can’t happen this year. I mean – I miss restaurants and that, but – about Christmas, I mean. I don’t really need all of that… extra stuff.”
He sits there in the darkened sitting room and closes his eyes, for a moment unable to do anything other than anguish over how very badly he wishes it could be.
In a way, it’s always seemed simultaneously like a too-real possibility, and yet the rest of the time it feels like something that can only exist in the planes of fantasy. Like now: I’m lying on my back, hand shoved deep into my pyjama pants, slowly stroking myself into full hardness, thinking shamelessly of Sherlock in that tiny towel, his body muscular yet lithe, as graceful as he always is in those enviable suits, but stripped down to steam-wet, pale/rosy skin, hard muscle moving beneath it with every movement he made. I think of him touching himself in the heat of the shower, eyes closed in the stream of water as he unwinds from the day, that dark hair slicked against his skull. My fist is moving quickly now, a smear of lube easing the way. I think of Sherlock naked between his sheets and wonder for the seventy millionth time how and why I don’t know more by now about his sexual habits: how often he gets himself off and how, when, where. How he likes it. What he thinks about when he does it. I love imagining him doing it at the same time as me, right below me. I wonder endlessly and gratuitously about his cock: what it looks like, how big it is, how thick, how he would touch it. How I would touch it, if ever given the chance. I’m panting now, my free hand pinching at my nipple, my hips arching up off the sheets. I think of my old prostate toy and of Sherlock fucking me. Fuck yeah, I’d let him, if he wanted to. I’ve never been with someone who was so much bigger than me, physically speaking. I’m not what you’d call submissive by any measure, but the thought of that, of his bigger frame pressing up behind me, looming over me as he enters me, the hard, thick length of him pushing into me – fuck yes, I’d let him! Or we’d do it the other way. I imagine him bent over the kitchen counter, looking back over his shoulder at me with one of those trademark smirks of his playing about his lips, inviting/daring me to come over and do it, pull his trousers down and push my cock into his arse right then and there. I’m frantic now, panting audibly and cursing under my breath as I imagine that, fucking him in broad daylight, right there in the kitchen, imagine the sounds he’d make –
He points obliquely at the toilet. “Do you need the – ?” he asks. I nod, so he pulls back the curtain and steps out of the shower. He’s chosen a ridiculously tiny towel that only just barely covers his pelvic region and nothing else, and even so it gapes a little as he steps out of the bath tub. I must be staring, because he says, “What?”
“A little south of Sunderland,” John tells him in that same, curiously flat tone of voice, devoid of all feeling that he’s been using ever since their conversation. He speaks as though Mycroft is not there.
John hears himself make a wholly non-verbal sound in response, his heart nearly dissolving. He put his arms around Sherlock and holds him as tightly as he can, his face pressed into Sherlock’s cheek, and he can feel Sherlock’s heart beating directly against his own. Overwhelming amounts of relief and joy are welling up within him in a mixture so heady that he feels drunk. “I’ll never leave you,” he vows, his voice low and fierce.
He sounds as though he knows Chilton College rather well already. “That’s right,” John tells him. “Come as quickly as you can.” He disconnects before having to explain the obvious reason why Dan needs to hurry, and goes back to Jodie’s side with Sherlock, hovering anxiously. He feels helpless not being in control here, but at the moment he’s more than grateful for this American doctor and his new antidote and overall presence of mind.
Sherlock puts his hands in his pockets. “Since it started? Six days now. I trust you won’t need a breakdown of the hours and minutes.”
Sherlock bites back the urge to say something sarcastic along the lines of tree shopping being more of a tedium than a joy. Who knows. For John, perhaps it is a joy. “Shall we?” he says instead, to John, who nods.
John feels every bit as happy, himself. “I might just get us a flannel, though,” he says. “Would you permit that?”
“Looks good,” Sherlock confirms. He looks at the controls, then selects ‘low’ and puts the lid on, checking the time. “It’s half-past eleven. It should be ready to eat after seven or eight hours.”
John searches for an answer. “Maybe these were just the ones that have ended up here for some reason? I mean, it
She feels indescribably weary as she moves about the kitchen. It’s all been so much to take in: first finding out about Eurus, about what she’d done, then learning the whole truth about the woman who’d called herself Mary Morstan, the two kidnappings… no wonder she still feels worn out by it all, she thinks.
“Have you told Mrs Hudson yet?” he asks, as casually as he can manage sometime that afternoon when they’re sitting in their chairs, and Sherlock actually bites his lip.
Jodie eyes him curiously. “Rough morning?” she asks lightly. “I preferred the waffles on yesterday morning’s buffet, but it wasn’t
“He wasn’t,” Mycroft says shortly. “And for his own sake, I preferred it that way.” He starts in on his hash browns, stabbing them viciously. “Furthermore, John doesn’t half deserve him. After his bloody wife died, he blamed Sherlock, which was patently ridiculous, but John Watson has only a passing acquaintance with rationality. He nearly drove Sherlock to suicide in his despair, then beat him half to death in a hospital owned by a man who already wanted Sherlock dead. He should, by all rights, be worshipping the ground Sherlock walks on after everything Sherlock has done for him. Yet here they are: John is back at Baker Street with an infant in tow, and Sherlock has taken on the responsibility of both of them, without any of the benefits I’m given to understand are meant to come with such domestic arrangements.”
Sherlock’s mouth quirks a little. “I asked her the price for a room with one bed, then gave her double what she said and told her no questions. She accepted.” He searches John’s face. “I – couldn’t think of how to raise the subject, in the car. But you’re not – this isn’t too – ”
The next pair is in their early thirties, one white, the other possibly Indian, Sherlock thinks. They introduce themselves as Andrew and Avi and Avi says quietly that they have trouble dealing with their families, neither of whom approve of their union. Todd probes and Andrew explains that Avi’s family cared less about the fact that he’s with a male than the fact that said male wasn’t Indian. Avi glances at him and adds that being gay isn’t great, either, as far as his parents are concerned. Andrew’s parents haven’t spoken to him since he told them that he was seeing Avi.
“Hydroxocobalamin,” the man says. “I’m actually on my way to a conference to talk about its use here in the UK – we’re lucky I just happened to be passing through and had it on hand! It will need to be administered for the next ten minutes continuously. Meanwhile, has her next of kin been informed?”
“Listen,” John says, very firmly, taking both of Sherlock’s hands. “I don’t want to go back to the way things have been, you at Baker Street and me out at the flat, living separate lives. From here on in, I only want there to be one ‘life’: the one you and I share. I’m in this all the way now, and I want to be wherever you are. I want to come home, if you don’t mind my extra baggage.”
Oh. That changes things, then. “I don’t have to,” John says, scooting over. “I was just – I didn’t want to – never mind. It’s all good.” He puts his arm back where it was. “Better?” he asks, just wanting to confirm that Sherlock really meant this, not just having him closer.
It’s the measured tones of Lucas Brennan, president of Ravine Valley. Sherlock and John break apart, and John takes care to look particularly flustered. “Oh! Sorry!” he says. “We were just – looking for someone, and we, er, we got – distracted, you could say.”
“No. Wait.” Sherlock closes the door behind him, unable to put this off until they’re home. His heart is pounding.
Sherlock gives him a half-smile at this, puts the car into gear and begins to drive. “I can’t believe you walked all the way from Batkovica,” he says, and John hears the unspoken request to let the entire subject of Serbia drop.
The silence between them is intensely awkward, neither of them looking at the other. After an agonisingly long time, John speaks. “If you want – if you think I should leave, I’ll… understand,” he says, his voice sounding like an empty husk of itself.
can’t,” Sherlock says, starkly honest. “I – can’t leave you like this, John. I won’t. I’m not going anywhere.” He goes into the kitchen to spare John having to respond to this, or himself from having to wait for a response to this somewhat soul-baring statement he’s just made, and finds a clean glass. The water pitcher in the fridge is half-full, so he fills the glass and carries it back into the sitting room, still apprehensive. He sets it on the coffee table, then backs away. “Do you want to talk about any of it?” he asks, wincing inwardly. John has already made it quite clear that he does not want to talk, yet his own therapy sessions with Ella have finally succeeded in convincing Sherlock that talking does, in fact, sometimes help.
“The map, maybe,” John says. He goes to the table and finds it in their package. “Got it. Let’s go.”
“I see,” Sherlock says, and means it. He does see. It’s all quite comprehensible. “Well, we’ll see,” he says philosophically. “It won’t be so bad once she’s in school and that. I know it’s still a few years off,” he adds when John opens his mouth.
Sherlock searches his eyes as though verifying this for himself, then says it back, the words low but very sure, and John’s heart clenches hard as they kiss again, the moment stretching itself out, suspended and utterly glorious.
John takes a deep breath, then lurches into his apology. “I’m sorry,” he says, the words jamming on his tongue in their rush to get out. “So sorry, Sherlock. I don’t know why I – I’m an idiot. I didn’t mean to hurt you like that. I don’t know what I was thinking.”
John is filled with both admiration and relief. He touches Sherlock’s face again, face-to-face on the same pillow. “You’re brilliant,” he says gratefully. “That’s
“The attacks tend to manifest as a severe headache and often some nausea, but he should be fine in a few minutes, now that he’s taken his medication,” Sherlock tells Lee and the other man, going off John’s cue. “It can come on quite suddenly when he’s forgotten. It’s normally well under control and it will be again quite soon. I thought I should monitor in case his physician in London needed to be phoned, or else someone local found to treat him.”
Linda looks both startled and hurt by his questions. “Wow, that’s not super nice,” she says, stung. “Why would you think – well, any of that? What makes you assume that I don’t support my son?”
near suicide mission in Serbia. I would have helped as much as possible, but the likelihood of his survival would have been extremely small.”
“When you brought the cane,” Sherlock says. “I know, John. I – didn’t mean to lose control the way I did, either. We weren’t ready to work together yet. Mrs Hudson pushed it on you before we were ready.
comes on. Sherlock attempts to ignore the sentimental lyrics, but a curious silence falls as they eat and he can’t help but listen.
“I don’t,” Sherlock interrupts gently. He reaches for the book and pulls it closer, turning it to face himself. John turns onto his back, holding Rosie’s rabbit on his chest, eyes gazing up at the ceiling. “
A warm wave engulfs John. “Yeah? Okay, then.” He’s never seen Sherlock fully nude before and he feels like this is pretty damned momentous. He’s also aware that he needs to be the one to go first, so he does.
“No, I know,” John says, hunched over, his fingers twisting together. “But it’s not like that. He’s been having nightmares. Trauma. It was brought on from that case we had five days ago. It’s brought up stuff from when he was away, all sorts of different stuff – really bad stuff, and it’s got so bad that he’s afraid to sleep. I woke up to him shouting that first night after so I went down and we talked, and then he said, when I suggested he go back to sleep. So I ended up offering to stay and he agreed. It was all a bit awkward, as you can imagine. And then I don’t even remember whether he asked or if I offered, but you know him – you know how hard it is for him to admit when he needs anything. So I’ve just gone on staying down here. That’s all it is: just me sleeping there, near him. We don’t really talk about it at all. We’ve talked about some of the incidents that’ve caused it and we talked about him taking a bit of a break from the work, but – ”
John exhales. “No, there was. If it had been all negative, I think even I might have seen it sooner. But she’d question me endlessly, then throw me off by giving me a compliment, like on my appearance or something. Or once, the day she died, right after we’d got back from bringing her back, she said something about it not helping that I was so ‘perfect’, which threw me, since it generally seemed like nothing I ever did was good enough.”
Sherlock blinks at me and then smiles, and the smile makes my entire chest feel like it’s dissolving. “I
“Well…” Jodie looks at him plainly. “Here’s the thing I’ve especially noticed: while you both seemed to want whatever finally happened last night, unless I’m wrong about that having happened, what I particularly saw was that Sherlock is in pain. He seems to be constantly trying to hide the fact that he’s immensely hurt, and you’re the one hurting him.” She sees his face and adds, “Sorry – that may be way out of line. I’m just saying what I’ve observed.”
“You’re counting the teenager, then?” Hallsey asks. “I thought we hadn’t agreed that that case was connected to this one.”
Sherlock stops to clear his throat, and puts down his speech. “What matters to me most, and what I really wanted to say tonight is this: for every crime I have helped solve, for every terrorist I have helped end, for all of the clever deductions I’ve made, the accomplishment I am most proud of is having won the love of this extraordinary man. I endeavour to spend the rest of my days trying to make myself worthy of it. John: I cannot believe you actually married me. But I’m so incredibly glad that you did.” He lifts his champagne flute. “To my husband, John Watson.”
“If they target young, fit men, should we be concerned about Justin and Thom?” John asks. “Andrew and Avi are attractive enough, but not like those two.”
The next morning, they’re just finishing breakfast, seated across from each other at the kitchen table. They made crepes with fresh blueberry sauce and crème anglaise with roasted sausages alongside, and John feels very much contented and full. They’re sipping coffee and perusing the newspapers now.
John shakes his head, looking at Sherlock with something rather like wonder. “Thank you for letting me,” he says, rubbing at Sherlock’s chest. “I loved doing it.”
I hurry over to him and we get Horton turned around, his face pushing up against the brick hard enough to subdue him. He begins to weep. “Kitty was my whole life,” he moans. “I wanted to kill you both for taking her from me. I wanted to do it for her. But I couldn’t.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “Paul is the organiser of the after hours sexual activities in the steam room. Jeremy Davidson was abducted from there on Tuesday night. Evidently this is how they cull their victims.”
Lee blinks a few times and processes this. “If you knew what the problem was, why did you need to come with him?” he wants to know.
had been only half a joke: he had genuinely hoped that John had lingered where they were before, so that they could resume from that point.
John takes a sip of his concoction and returns his gaze to the contents of his mug. “I feel like I failed as a husband. I just – couldn’t love Mary enough. I suppose I never did. I was never sure about it – any of it.” He shakes his head, then goes on. “When I met her, I thought she was nice. That’s it: nice. Kind of pretty but not someone I would have looked at twice, shallow as that sounds. Not unattractive, just – not someone who stopped me in my tracks, you know? But she liked me, and that helped. She was the one who kept pushing for a drink, then teased about dinner until I gave in, then started hinting about moving in together. I went along with it because there was nothing better in my life and no reason to say no. I wasn’t even sure when I proposed.”
. He hasn’t forgotten his oath, all evidence to the contrary. He thinks of Sherlock, then very firmly forces the thought down. Even letting himself think of the letter, what Sherlock might be thinking about it right now, is not something he can allow himself to do. It’s been hard enough trying not to think about Sherlock, of never seeing him again. It’s been impossible to avoid thinking of the day Sherlock was supposed to come here, to Serbia, knowing that he was never going to come back. The parallel is impossible to avoid: this time it’s John who won’t be coming back.
He can’t bring himself to meet John’s eyes, but nods. “We were,” he says, his voice slightly unsteady. “We… go back farther. This: we had this before… any of the rest of it.”
Sherlock nods toward the number panel. “It’s the thirteenth floor. Difficult to believe that people are really that superstitious, but here we are.”
Sherlock silently nods toward his room. “It’s only ten…” he says, meaning that there’s still time before the room check.
John feels a smile spreading over his face, his eyes going soft. “I am the luckiest arsehole in the world, you know that?”
Sherlock paces in a full circle, his coat flapping behind him, trying to master his emotional state long enough to attempt basic rationality over this. He stops abruptly. “Can you please try to give me something to reason with?” he requests, his voice coming out evenly at last. “Just – anything, John. Help me understand what’s happening.
If she was expecting anger in return, she’s to be disappointed. John only shrugs again. “Maybe. Probably. I don’t know. What does it matter?”
He has them all hold hands while he talks about some of the related theories. Sherlock looked at John when Todd gave this instruction and John reached unhesitatingly for his hand, linking their fingers together in what already feels like their most familiar way of touching one another. Todd looks around at everyone, nodding approvingly at them. “Nice,” he says. “Very nice, with the fingers. Good,” he adds to Brad and Doug. “That’s it. All right: on your feet, gents. For the next few minutes, we’re just going to face our partner and look into his eyes. That’s it. You don’t need to talk or touch, just make eye contact and hold it. Go ahead.” As everyone stands and gets into this position, he walks around in the middle of the circle. “Notice what else happens,” Todd says. “Do you look more into his left eye or his right? Does your breathing sync together? Can you tell what he’s thinking about? Are you uncomfortable? Can you think of the last time you made prolonged eye contact this way? Go ahead and gaze, and see what you observe.”
They watch two episodes of the new drama series they had started just before the crime scene incident, then Sherlock stretches deeply and yawns. “I think perhaps I will have a bath,” he says. “You don’t mind?”
John thinks of Sherlock texting him and finding out that the text couldn’t be delivered, of knowing that he hadn’t even read it, and a hard edge comes into his throat. “Oh, Sherlock,” he says softly. “Christ. I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock swallows. “I had no choice by that point. I had to jump, and I had to make sure that you saw it and believed it. Lest you come to see too quickly that it was a ruse, and put yourself back into danger. I needed for all three of you to believe it. Mycroft put our parents into the know and convinced them to appear to grieve at the funeral. Molly had to be in on it to legally declare me dead, then help me escape from where I was hiding in the hospital. That’s why they knew and you didn’t. And then I spent the next two years eliminating every part of Moriarty’s operation that I could find, because I didn’t know how many assassins he’d left behind to carry out the plan.”
“About John,” Sherlock cuts him off, his gaze boring into Mycroft’s expansive forehead. His fury drives the words forward. “
“Especially the ones who’ve been gone the longest,” John agrees, trying not to feel selfish about Rosie. “Jimmy Wells has been gone for days already.”
tense, damn it. He gets himself out of the room with his dignity intact and escapes up to the privacy of his own room.
John feels a bit trapped. He decides not to try to deny this, but the truth is that he doesn’t know what he might have said or done. “I – you sort of hinted at it, at not coming back,” he says instead. “But I just figured that you’d pull a you and weasel out of it again. Like you always do.” He watches Sherlock’s face as he turns this over in his head, then adds, “I still would have wanted to know. I never want you to think that I wouldn’t want that. I don’t want you disappearing again. Ever.”
They get into a waiting town car and John sits very close to him, all four of their hands linked in their laps. “Well,” Sherlock says, with immense satisfaction in his voice. “That’s that done.”
Now they’re back in their room, and suddenly things feel awkward again. Not terribly so, but enough that Sherlock is certain that John’s noticed, too. John strips down to his boxer shorts and changes into an old t-shirt while he’s in the bathroom brushing his teeth. Sherlock changes quickly, taking John’s lead in terms of attire. He doesn’t own boxer shorts, but brought boxer briefs specifically for this event, and pulls on a t-shirt long enough for modesty. When John comes out of the bathroom, Sherlock goes in and brushes his teeth and washes his face. He uses the toilet, then washes his hands and re-enters the main room with some trepidation.
“Not here,” the lady says, squinting at her notes. “Ah yes – it was actually in Jamaica! Exotic spot to have a gig, I remember telling her! The couple even paid for her airfare, so it was like a free little vacation – all she had to do was sing a couple of jazz pieces at the reception, and it was out on a beach… I wish
“Didn’t,” he contests, turning his face a little to press his lips to Sherlock’s neck. He thinks again how every saying of it feels like a small burst of healing. For both of them, maybe. He resolves then and there to say it at least once every day for the rest of their lives. Maybe even right away, right now. “It’s true. I love you.”
“Of course!” Kyle says. “The masseurs are great, aren’t they? It’s my favourite thing to do when I have an afternoon or day off.”
John gets out from under him and pads over to the bathroom nude. Sherlock rolls out of bed on the far side and watches for an admiring half-second, then unwinds the sheet from around his ankle and hastens after John’s retreating form.
“Of course I know,” Mycroft says sharply. “I was watching. Per Sherlock’s rather explicit order. What you don’t know, and are too stubborn to ask, preferring rather to cling to your narrative of endless suffering and wallowing in self-pity and righteous indignation, is that Sherlock is the one who was blackmailed here. If he hadn’t jumped, the cost would have been your life.”
He’s said this before, but this is clearly for Mrs Hudson’s benefit. She looks back and forth between them, her face a bit anxious. “But it’s working?” she asks.
“It’s statistically more likely. Women rarely kidnap children, except for the dangerously unbalanced.” Sherlock makes a thinking sound. “I suppose we shouldn’t rule that out in this case.”
Sherlock is still frowning, his thumbs tapping away at his phone screen. “Have you heard of an actor called Corey Graham?”
The voice nearly startles John out of his skin and he silently curses himself for it. He manages to keep his composure, though, and turns to see that their informant has joined him. She actually
John pauses, choosing his words carefully. How honest should he risk being? Linda is a nice person, even if he has no intention of marrying her, and she’s just been rather dangerously forthcoming with him. “Honestly, I’m here on business,” he says, truthfully enough. “But being here has rather solidified some things that I didn’t have a strong opinion about before I came. I’m glad for that. But my views obviously wouldn’t be welcome, so I’d rather not say too much about that.”
Sherlock is there, too, his arms around them both. He kisses Rosie’s head, then gives John a look so intense it might as well have been a kiss. He turns away, though, duty calling. He questions Tamara first, ascertaining that she’s all right, that neither she nor any of the children have been harmed. She tells him that Hidgens wanted her to look after the kids while he was “collecting”, he’d said.
small mercy, John is back at Baker Street with his infant child, playing house with Sherlock. When Sherlock returned from his mission, he seemed to accept the reality of John’s engagement relatively quickly, after his initial disappointment, but now – ” He breaks off to shake his head. “Now he could hardly be blamed for hoping. And if John leaves him again, I will – ”
He’s breathless, panting, relishing every one of John’s thrusts pounding into him and wanting more still. His penis is dripping onto the sheets, needing as fiercely as the rest of him, but – “More, John – harder, please – ”
It feels like a scene out of a film, John thinks blurrily as they stumble into the ornate bedrooms. He closes the door, still kissing Sherlock as deeply as he knows how, cocooning them in privacy. If he’d thought it might be awkward or complicated, he was wrong. It feels natural, every part of it, from searching out every corner of Sherlock’s body, touching every inch of his skin with his lips and hands and tongue, taking him into his mouth for the first time, the dusky salt tang somehow already piercingly familiar. This taste belongs to him and him alone, he knows, and the thought makes his chest throb fiercely. Sherlock is writhing and panting above him, and when his voice rises, John lets up. He shifts upward to claim Sherlock’s mouth again, curling his hand around Sherlock’s cock in replacement. It’s an easy thing to get his fingers slicked up, a condom rolled jointly onto him, their fingers tangling, to feel his way into Sherlock’s body, feeling every minute reaction on Sherlock’s part in his mouth, in the way his breath stutters. It only takes murmurs of exchange, question, affirmation, again with each new step, and by the time Sherlock opens his eyes, John is harder than granite.
past deserving them. I’m aware that I’m one of those people. But he was willing to forgive Mary, too, even after she’d shot him. It was his suggestion that she come for dinner. And now, despite Eurus having literally terrorised us both for the past five years, he’s willing to reach out to her and start visiting, because it’s important to him that she not feel abandoned. Even after all that she’s done. So yes, you may be quite right in thinking that I don’t half deserve him. I know that. But he and I have agreed to leave that behind us, and that’s something I’m willing to do because he’s asked it of me, asked me to stop bringing up all of the reasons why I don’t deserve him. I do know that. I also know that I’m going to spend the rest of my life trying to deserve him, all right? I am never going to hurt him or leave him again. I love Sherlock, love him in a way that no one else has ever loved him before, and there is nothing and no one on this planet who is going to change that!”
“Two godparents, I think you mean,” Karen corrects him, still smiling, but somehow frowning at the same time.
I can hear the awe in his voice and it makes my heart clench. I look back over my shoulder and he takes the hint and kisses me as deeply as he can from where he is, and by the end of the kiss I can feel my body relaxing. “Okay,” I breathe. “You can – go!”
“Mmm. We should order a bottle of wine,” Sherlock says, letting his voice carry equally. “A shiraz, do you think?”
“I’ve worked rather hard to disguise it,” Sherlock says frankly. “I thought the information would be wholly unwelcome to you. Either way, you and I both thought that it would just be a drink. It’s not – it’s not what you’re thinking. It wasn’t a trick. I didn’t go for that drink to make you jealous, or ask you to coach me as a sneaky way to get you to kiss me. I went because there didn’t seem to be any reason not to, given that I thought you didn’t want anything from me beyond friendship. I actually thought that it might even be a relief for you if I dated someone else, in the event that you suspected that I felt the way I did – do – for you. You seemed so keen for me to try it that you were even willing to teach me what I needed to know for it to work. I had no idea that it would progress, that Corey would stick around. There didn’t seem to be any reason not to keep going with it, either, since it seemed to be functioning, and that was largely due to you continuing to guide me through it.”
This gets a chorus of reactions, and Sherlock feels his face heat. How the hell does John know about that?! He coughs. “I thought we weren’t discussing the private stuff,” he says pointedly, as though under his breath but deliberately loud enough to be overheard.
