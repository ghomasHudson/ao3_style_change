“We really aren’t,” Sherrinford said. “Sherlock enjoys showing off. That’s the frailty of genius: it needs an audience.”
“Blabbersnog,” the girl nodded. “It escaped from the Howling Halls and we’ve been trying to get it back ever since.”
His eyes are drawn to him immediately. Across a crowded room, dimmed and coloured by the beams of crossing purple and green lights, he sits, and John’s eyes gravitate to him the moment he’s through the door.
“Would it be okay if I did that, too?” John asked, his curiosity getting the best of him.
John slowed, glancing around the alley. A dark doorway caught his eye and he took a few exploratory steps toward it. A hand reached out and snatched him into the dark. John was immediately surrounded by heat.
“How do you...”
Sherlock scoffed. “Of course that’s not how it normally looks! It’s supposed to look like my exact double - exact!”
Sherlock thundered down the hall to Mycroft’s office and slammed the heavy wooden door open and into the wall. He braced himself on the door frame and glared across the room at his brother, who sat in his squeaky leather chair that cried under his weight every time he shifted, behind the big wooden desk that hid his ever-expanding waistband.
“I’m not an complete idiot, you know. I’ve been studying the mechanics of androids since I was a child. I’ve just never seen one this advanced before.”
The Doctor leaned close to John and murmured, “increased sensitivity.”
He took the stairs two at a time to his room and went to his wardrobe to frown at the confines. His eyes settled on the suit a girlfriend had bought him before he’d gone to Afghanistan and he hesitated a moment before taking it out. He held it up in front of himself as he looked in the mirror. He’d never worn the suit before, never really had the opportunity, but now seemed as good a time as any. It wasn’t really something he would normally wear, but if he was going to stand beside Sherlock looking like that, then he would damn well look good, too.
Once he had his clothes all stored away in a backpack, he lead the way to the kitchen where he quickly scribbled a note for Harry and his father, letting them know where he was.
The bot rolled to a stop less than 5 feet away from where John was crouched. His legs were tired from rugby practice earlier that day and they ached as he stayed still in the crouched position watching the bot turn and begin to roll in his direction. He found it not fair that the Old Man Crawley got to have a bot and he didn’t. He had wanted one since he was a kid and knew he would take a lot better care of it than the cranky old man.
He stopped himself before he could say anymore. He didn’t want to cry - he hadn’t let himself before and he certainly wasn’t going to start now. He didn’t want to break down and lay on top of Sherlock’s grave like he wanted to - to wait for death to take him, too. Death certainly couldn’t be any worse than this, whatever this was he was doing. Living. Sherlock had been right all that time ago. Breathing… Breathing was boring, and Christ, it bloody hurt.
He blinked once, twice before his vision came back to him and zeroed in on John who was crouched and leaning over him, his breaths harsh against Sherlock’s forehead as he tried to steady his racing heart. Prickles burst across Sherlock’s skin with each gust.
“He was the one person that never looked at me like I was a freak,” Sherlock said, looking into his glass of water. He eventually picked it up and took a drink, then set it back down. “Are you ready to go?” he asked, eyeing John's empty plate.
Sherlock breathed deeply through his nose. “What did you do with it?” he said as calmly as he could. His whole body was vibrating with the urge to explode.
“We would need the Blabbersnog’s saliva to develop the antidote. Come on, help me get him up. We need to move him into the TARDIS.”
Sherlock looked into his eyes, finally coming back to himself with those words. “I love you, too, John.”
Sherlock went back to his work, pushing aside wires to peer inside the android’s head. “Sherrinford and I agreed that you seemed to need it,” he said.
Sherrinford quirked his head. “It is my understanding that we all like each other,” he said.
“Yes,” Mycroft said, pressing his lips together again in that condescending way of his. He sat forward with a sigh and leaned his forearms on the desks edge to bring his clasped hands under his chin. “Must I remind you, Sherlock, that I also said the last time drug paraphernalia was found in your room that if any was ever found again, I would take that...
Seeing him jump, watching him plummet to the ground, seeing him still, checking his pulse, finding nothing. He witnessed all of this, yet it was seeing the headstone with Sherlock’s name on it that made John Watson finally admit to himself that this new reality he was living in, the one without Sherlock in it, just might actually be real.
The bot came loose of the pile, as well as the junk above it. John had only a moment to heft the bot into his arms and take off running as the deserted items began to slide down like a tidal wave. The thunderous crash had the lights in the house flicking on and a moment later John heard the telling sound of the door banging open. He spared a glance over his shoulder to see Old Man Crawley standing in his doorway with a double-barrel shotgun held in his arms.
John wasn’t entirely sure how Sherlock had deduced that the murderer was going to watch this movie. Did murderers even watch romances? At the moment, there was a man trying to keep his girlfriend from leaving him after she’d caught him cheating on her. John rolled his eyes at the predictability of it all, but Sherlock seemed intrigued when the man surged forward and began to kiss her. As John predicted, the woman jerked away and took her bags with her on the way out the door; the only good part of the movie so far.
Sherlock and Sherrinford had been working on an experiment involving the textures of different animal furs for the early afternoon when Sherlock caught himself once again glancing toward the clock. Though he was absorbing the information on which furs were roughest, which were the smoothest, and so on, he was also doing his best to ignore the undercurrent of thoughts of John that kept trying to make themselves known. The only communication he'd had with John in the past three days was to text John to make sure John had his number, much to his android's delight.
“Just that I was going to make dinner,” Sherlock said, looking at him with the look he often gave John when he suspected he was missing something. “What?”
“It’s not in your coding to do so,” Sherlock said from the other side of the bed.
“Sherlock hasn’t kissed anyone before, either,” Sherrinford said.
Sherlock roared and kicked Mycroft’s desk, chipping off a piece of the wood. He turned and stomped away, back across the room past Mycroft's four-poster bed with its dark blue silk everything.
“Experimental purposes,” Sherlock explained.
“Will I be uncomfortable?”
"Incon-... Sherlock, it's either comfortable or it's not," John told him.
Sherlock remained quiet behind John.
“Like I said, I’m The Doctor. This here is Rose Tyler, my travelling companion.”
“You're talking about yourself in the third person now?” John said, raising an eyebrow with a pleased smile on his lips.
Sherlock let out a quiet laugh. “Never.”
“Any preferences?” John asked as he dropped to his knees to examine the options. He glanced over his shoulder at the frowning faces of his friends with raised brows.
“It seems you did,” Sherlock said, the amusement in his voice apparent. John glared at the back of Sherlock’s head as he began to chuckle. He could feel Sherlock’s laughter vibrating through his body and it only made him harder. Sherlock froze when John’s cock twitched and John squeezed his eyes closed, hoping this was a all just a dream.
It’s a few days later that Lestrade calls with a new case: a woman has been murdered. She was found by her husband, hit over the head by a blunt instrument. The crime scene is only 5 blocks away, so John and Sherlock set off on foot. John suspects it will only take Sherlock moments to solve the case, but Sherlock hasn’t left the house in weeks, so he decides it’s for the best they at least get a little fresh air and exercise. Sherlock goes, surprisingly, without a fight.
“Not hungry,” Sherlock answered, eyeing the curtains intently.
Sherlock frowned and his eyes flicked over to Rose and The Doctor. “Who are you?” he asked, sitting up with John’s assistance. He rubbed at his temples like he was suffering from a headache, but his hands quickly shot away from his head and he shook them out, feeling like there were pins and needles pricking his head. Catching sight of his hands, Sherlock brought them up to his face and stared at their pink hue, blinking several times
John swallowed and forced his gaze away. He deleted the jumbled letters and stared at the entry for a moment, his mind gone blank, before he sighed and saved it as a draft. He closed his laptop and stood to head upstairs to change, casting a glance at Sherlock’s velvety suit as he walked past him. Christ, did he look good.
Sherlock, who had been squeezing his eyes closed, slowly opened them and looked up at John. “Why’d you stop?” he managed to say. His chest started to rise and fall slower as he studied John’s face.
“It’s a time machine,” the girl said.
, another text quickly popped up.
“Yes, we are,” Sherrinford inserted quickly. He offered his hand and Mary shook it, looking a bit starstruck. “Nice to meet you, Mary. Now we’ll be off,” he said, slipping his arm through John’s and steering him away, much to the chagrin of Mary, who looked after them frowning.
John dressed quickly in his pyjama bottoms and a light blue t-shirt, then walked over to the bed. “Umm... who’s sleeping where?”
“Sherlock, honey, it’s almost dinner time. You can’t stay in here all night.”
“Ask what?” both Holmes’ asked at the same time.
“Yes?” Sherlock answered, sounding wide awake. John barely kept from groaning from sheer embarrassment. The small part of his mind that wasn’t pleading for John to get out of the bed and make some sort of excuse to leave as soon as possible wondered how long Sherlock had been laying there, wrapped in John’s arms.
John’s knees were aching from being crouched on the ground and they popped when he stood. “Jesus.” He turned back to the bot. “You’re telling me there’s some guy out there who’s probably looking for you?”
Sherrinford quickly did just that. He kissed John hard and John was forced to lay back on the bed. Sherrinford’s hands quickly mapped the expanse of John’s chest and he paused over John’s nipples like Sherlock had, massaging his fingers over the erect bumps.
Her disappointment was made clear by yet another sigh and the sound of her grunting to her feet. The pirate ship shuddered as she braced against it for support. “Alright, love. Alright. I’m leaving. But don’t you think I’ll bring your dinner out to you, young man.”
John watched as Sherlock popped open the androids faceplate and began tinkering around inside. “It must have been damaged in the junkyard,” John supplied.
“What?” John gaped.
John blushed and took a sip of his soda to hide his smile.
Sherrinford looked down at his lap, then back at Sherlock and John. “I’ve missed something.”
A smile flashed across Sherlock’s face, crinkling his eyes up at the corners. John couldn’t help but smile back. “Would you like to help cut the toppings?”
“Sherlock!” the voice repeated, sounding relieved. “Are you alright?”
The compliment had put John in a good mood and he chuckled to himself as he stood. They buttoned up their suit jackets and, with a wave from John to the staff, they headed for the door.
“I’ll go up,” Sherlock said, heading quickly for the staircase inside the building. His coat flapped against his calves as he started ascending the stairs.
“What is it?” Sherrinford asked, leaning to peer over Sherlock's shoulder.
“What are you doing?” John called out, following quickly after him. He stepped in front of him just before Sherlock reached the hallway and put his arms out, blocking Sherlock from going any further.
“No, John. The banana from the trash can. He was searching for bananas.”
“TARDIS. Time and Relative Dimensions in Space.”
“It’s indeterminate,” Sherlock said.
“Can I help you?” the boy asked, his voice sounding fake in its warmth.
Sherlock huffed a sigh and turned to leave when something in the grass caught his eye. He stepped over to the fence and stooped down to retrieve the torn piece of denim. As he was bent squatted down, Sherlock spotted dirt on the fence’s links. He pinched a little between his fingertips, felt the texture and took a sniff, then sprinkled it off his hands onto the ground before rising. Dirt from the rugby field of the nearby high school.
“Well, if it was, nobody told me about it. That’s the kind of thing you discuss with a person first.”
Sherlock smacked his hand hard against the wall by John’s head, smearing John’s blood on the rocks and startling John enough to make him close his eyes tight. When he dared to open them again, Sherlock’s eyes were wide and he leaned into John, cupped his face in his cold hands, and kissed him shakily.
John took a steady breath and tapped his spoon against his plate. “I’ve already lost him once before, Rose. I can’t lost him again.”
Beside him, Sherlock stirred and his eyelids slid open. John noticed he’d been unknowingly brushing his thumb back and forth over Sherlock’s forehead as his palm rested in Sherlock’s silky hair. He pulled away once Sherlock’s eyes seemed to focus and he noticed a yellowish tint dusting Sherlock’s now pink cheeks when their eyes met.
“I am able to detect when and where I am being touched,” the robot informed him, matching the volume of John’s voice.
So, what are you guys hoping for when the sex finally ensues?
“Nothing,” John said quickly, avoiding Sherlock’s gaze burning into the side of his head.
"Well... not exactly, but it is a distraction," Sherlock admitted.
“His wife died from a brain aneurysm. No more than a week later, he was dead. My mother says he died of heartbreak. My father said it was a suicide.”
“I’m taking my android back,” Sherlock said, frowning at John. “Now get your hands off me.”
“It’s a place where dangerous aliens are kept.”
John looked up at Sherlock and realized just how close they were standing to each other. Fingers touched the back of his hand and they were cold. He glancee back and Sherrinford smiled down at him. “You can sleep in my bed this time,” he said, looking pleased. His fingers grew warm against John's skin.
The bot’s metal was cold to the touch as John hefted it into his arms and carried it out to the living room. Harry was staying the night over at her friend Clara’s and his dad probably wouldn’t be home until the early hours of morning.
Sherlock shifted and John caught what looked like a pout on Sherlock’s lips as he turned to the table to set the bags down.
It was different from the night before. It was slow and careful and exploratory, but it felt completely new, as well. It felt like it was leading up to something more. John slid his hand down Sherlock’s back, feeling ribs and the lean musculature that led to his waistband. He settled his hand on Sherlock’s hip and followed Sherlock’s lead.
“Is there anything he doesn’t have?” John asked.
John froze up as Sherlock held him close. Sherlock was so warm and John wanted nothing more than to press himself back against him to soak up his heat, but he knew what that would look like to onlookers: like they were cuddling up somewhere, getting each off in an alley or something. Sherlock’s coat would be perfect for it.
Just hearing that made John speed up even faster. “God, yes.”
“Sluurp,” she said straight-facedly.
“You can come in,” John told her, looking suspiciously at Sherlock as his flatmate smiled proudly.
It took John a moment to answer, taken by surprise was he by the vulnerability he saw on Sherlock’s face. Eventually, he nodded. “Of course. You can’t run me away that easily.”
The TARDIS was filled with an orangish-yellow glow and a large console in the middle of the room that was lit with turquoise up to the ceiling. Hexagons decorated the walls and thick wires hung from the ceiling. It was strange room and it was big.
Once in his bedroom, John locked the door and sat cross-legged on top of his bed and suggested the bot sit in the chair in front of his desk. The robot listened and crossed his room to sit on the dark blue chair.
“It wasn’t 100 percent bad,” Sherlock offered with some reluctance.
When Redbeard let out a soft whimper, Sherlock set down his book and gave his boy a pat before unlocking the cabin door. Redbeard left the ship and waited for Sherlock to join him in the moonlight, but Sherlock urged him on into the house.
“Blabbersnog?” John asked slowly.
“I’d thought I’d lost you,” Sherlock said when John started running alongside him.
Sherlock’s eyes flitted down to the cover of the folder in his hands. “If I told you, it may ruin the whole experiment,” Sherlock said. “The reason I am telling you is because you told me that I had to ask you permission before I did any sort of experiments on you.”
“Hello Sherlock,” Mycroft said, stilling the pen on the pad of paper he’d been writing on. He looked up at Sherlock with a pinched humourless smile, observing the likely damage Sherlock had done to his bedroom wall. “How can I help you?”
“Then…” Sherlock’s eyes danced over the candles and the flower petals leading away into his bedroom.
John frowned. “Could it harm me?”
“Touch it.”
John huffed and turned back to the movies, grabbing the first one his eyes saw. “‘Dr. No’ it is,” he said, popping the case open. He quickly turned the t.v. on, put the disc in, then went to the kitchen to make the popcorn. When he came back with a bowl filled with the buttery snack, Sherlock and Sherrinford immediately scooted apart, leaving space for him between them. John huffed a laugh and sat down.
“Can Sherlock kiss you, too?” Sherrinford asked.
He realized how strange that thought was, considering Sherrinford was him, only more… open. Sherrinford didn’t know what it was like to be considered a freak and turned away because of who he was. And John hadn’t done that, yet, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t, and it would hurt, because for once, Sherlock really wanted to be liked.
“Oi, don’t touch that!” The Doctor exclaimed, striding quickly over to Sherlock with his long legs. He swatted Sherlock’s hand and Sherlock yanked his hand back to stare at the burst of blue-green that had spread upon contact.
“Wait, sorry. What? Banana pudding?” John frowned in confusion, obviously missing their line of thought. It certainly wasn’t the first time that he was the last to understand what was happening.
“Sherlock?” John asked, furrowing his brow.
The way those words sounded coming out of Sherlock’s mouth sent a curl of warmth through John’s body and he stared down at his motionless hands, trying to clear his head. He cleared his throat instead. “How long will it take?” he croaked.
“Yes.”
“Hey, Sherlock,” he greeted, hitching his bag further up on his shoulder. “Sherrinford,” he nodded, smiling. “What are you guys doing here?”
Suddenly Sherlock’s nostrils flared and his irises, so light as to be nearly colourless, were nearly filled in by the black of his pupils. The bob of his adam’s apple caught John’s eye just beneath the tie of his thick black cape right before Sherlock crowded so close John had to tip his head back so he could hold his gaze. He couldn’t hide the way his breath hitched as Sherlock pressed into him, filling the void that was always his to fill.
Alas, a chapter! Sorry for the wait!
“Still up for spaghetti for dinner?” John asked, passing Sherlock at the kitchen table on his way to the fridge.
"John?" Sherlock said, peering up at him. "Phone?"
“It has heat sensors,” Sherlock explained from behind him.
Sherlock was standing at the window, peering out at the city under the moonlight when John walked in. He crossed the room to stand behind him and wrapped his arms around him, pressing his lips to the back of Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. “Of course,” he said, because in all honesty, he’d feel weird without him there. He and Sherrinford did everything together, it only made sense that that included this.
“John?” Sherlock murmured, his warm breath gusting against John’s ear. John couldn't stop the shiver that wracked his body.
As they walked, his flatmate filled him in on the case. He did his best to pay attention, but John quickly came to understand what Sherlock had meant earlier about distractions. The warm, slightly spicy scent of Sherlock's cologne filled John's nose each time he inhaled and he soon found himself breathing faster just to take in more of it. He’d smelled the cologne, but never up close like this so he could smell every little nuance.
Sherlock went into the closet and dragged the android out from the shadows. Once out again, he held it in front of himself and looked it up and down. “Do you realize how much work you’ve flushed down the drain? I’m going to kill Mycroft!”
They’ve been walking mostly in silence, side by side because the streets are mostly empty and the weather’s starting to get cold again. It’s as they’re crossing the street to the next sidewalk when John gets his first glimpse of the experiment, though he doesn’t realize it at the time. As John steps up onto the next pavement, he has to swerve closer to Sherlock to avoid a passing woman and Sherlock’s fingers tangle with his.
His cheeks started to burn as Sherrinford pressed his lips to John’s neck and he glanced sideways at Sherlock who seemed not to have noticed yet. Soon Sherrinford was nuzzling behind John’s ear and he bit his bottom lip when Sherrinford opened his damp mouth against John’s neck and began to tease his tongue across John’s skin.
"Did I get everything else right?” Sherlock looked at John hopefully.
“No, Sherlock. Don’t you dare. Open your eyes, you git. No sleeping on cases, remember? Sleeping’s boring!”
He got into position.
Rose laughed and her whole face lit up. “The Doctor’s the same way. Come on, the kitchen’s this way.”
It was the boy’s bedroom. His bedroom door was closed and he was rifling around in his closet, his backpack discarded on the bedroom floor and his jacket tossed half-hazardly over the back of his desk chair. As Sherlock watched, the boy grabbed the bottom of his shirt and pulled it off, then shoved it into a laundry hamper, followed soon after by a pair of jeans, which were dirty and frayed around the cuffs.
“What do the colours mean?” Sherlock asked. “Does green mean pain?”
The longer the conversation went on, the sadder John began to feel, so he decided to change the subject completely. He turned to Sherlock. “You said there was something you wanted to show me that you thought I might like?”
Sherlock threw the liquid back and grimaced. It tasted like pepper. He sneezed almost as soon as the liquid was down, then again, and one more time.
“I-” the android began to say, then it made a strange click sound. “I’m sorry.”
“Yeah,” John answered quickly. “It’s just been awhile since I’ve had to run like that.”
“You haven’t got my number,” John reminded him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but John smiled in amusement. He unlatched the gate to reach them. “I was actually going to text you when I got home to see if you guys were free today,” he admitted.
John smiled and took his hand and they set off for his house.
John let himself into the lightless house making sure to shut the door with as soft a click as possible behind him. His whole body felt heavy, yet every cell jumped with adrenaline and excitement. His footsteps fell quietly as he walked on socked feet down the hall to his bedroom. His dad’s bedroom door was closed like it had been when he’d left, but it didn’t tell him if his dad was home or if he was out. John paused outside his dad’s bedroom door and held his breath as he listened for the familiar deep snores of drunken sleep. Hearing nothing, John turned to his own bedroom door and stepped into his room.
Sherlock released him and John ran at full speed. He tackled a serial killer to the ground and they skidded a few feet across the pavement until they lost momentum. Sherlock laughed giddily, towering above them with a grin on his face. “That was spectacular, John!"
It was late by the time they got to Sherlock’s house; the sky was an inky blue. John was wiped out, exhausted from rugby practice that day. All he wanted to do was sleep, but... well, he was in the house of a boy he’d barely known for a few hours and, apparently, he seemed to also have a bit of a crush on the guy.
Sherlock blinked at the curtain where the light from the moon glowed behind a thin curtain, the only thing visible in the small, cold room he lay in. He sighed and turned away toward the invisible wall in front of him, thoughts of John leaving him restless. He would be home soon, a week in counting, and then he would be able to see John again. He would finally have the chance to tell him all the things he’d realized while he was away, particularly the part where he never wanted to be without him again. Without John, he felt like he was going mad. Sherlock closed his eyes.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, coming to a stop in front of John’s chair as if he’d been searching all over for him and was almost relieved to find him when John had been sitting in the same place pretty much all day.
A pause. Ghostly white looked back at ghastly grey, and, “You came back,” one of them said.
The dust became them once more, parting around them like an embrace. Grey hand gripped loose jumper and they came back to each other.
“You can kiss me if you’d like,” John told Sherrinford. “Just do what I did.”
“That’s... brilliant. You’re amazing!”
“I have never kissed anyone before.”
“Are you sure?”
“Oh, shut up!” Sherlock growled.
“I was planning to go to the symphony and was wondering if you would like to attend with me.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Maybe you missed him while you were performing fellatio on your fingers,” Sherlock murmured back.
“He was my uncle,” Sherlock informed him. “Well, not necessarily. An uncle in the way that your parents’ great friends are considered relatives.”
“Okay,” Sherlock said.
“Do you want to sleep over?” John asked before he’d thought it through.
“Sherlock isn’t familiar with compliments, so he doesn’t know how to react to them,” Sherrinford informed him quietly. “Don’t worry. If I like you, Sherlock likes you. We’re the same, remember?”
The first thing John noticed was how large the room was. It had a high, vaulted ceiling and four long windows that almost reached from floor to ceiling. Next, he noticed the wires, the bolts, and the metal body parts. There were computer chips, LED lightbulbs, and a large, open blue toolbox. The room looked like a cluttered mess at first glance, but upon blinking a couple times and having a few moments to take it all in, John was able to see that it was actually controlled chaos. There were tables lined up next to each other with just enough space for Sherlock to stand between them and each was cluttered with items that belonged together.
When the music picked up, John leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes, letting the beautiful sounds wash over him. His hand was on the same armrest as Sherlock’s elbow and he found himself just itching to reach out and slide his hand down it to take Sherlock’s hand in his. He swallowed and slid his arms off to rest his sweating palms on his thighs instead. His heart was racing along with the music and he peeked over at Sherlock, expecting to see Sherlock watching him with knowing eyes. Instead, Sherlock was sitting back with his eyes closed, his lips parted as if he’d forgotten himself in the music. His eyelashes were like brush strokes across his cheekbones.
John eased himself back out again and then slid back in a little faster. He kept a dragging pace until Sherlock’s eyebrows were no longer bunched together and his lips parted. He slid out and pressed back in faster to see what Sherlock would do and the other man gasped in surprise as John hit his prostate. His eyes flew open.
“There’s nothing wrong with showing affection,” John complained.
The android was beautiful. It was clearly male, though the softness of its lips and the angular, yet soft curve of its cheekbones made it appear slightly androgynous. It had sculpted metal curls painted black that revealed a gold shimmer as John shifted to sit back on his heels.
John and the android laughed. “Come on,” John said, holding out his hand toward the teen. “We know you want to.”
“I’m sure they can handle it just fine together,” John said. He smiled down at Sherlock before he turned and reached up onto the table to pick up a small chart with different colours squiggled all over it. He held it up. “‘Blue’,” he read off. “‘Surprise. Green, pain or anger or fear. Red, concentration. Pink, neutral. Yellow… embarrassment or nervousness’. You were blushing, Sherlock.”
His suggestion was met by two very displeased looking faces and he rolled his eyes. “Yep, we’re staying in,” John said. He turned toward the entertainment center and opened the cabinets underneath. They were stocked with movies. Without even seeing the titles, Sherlock presumed most were action films.
“It would appear so, yes.”
“Nope. I was simply nervous. I’m dying, remember?”
“Yes,” Sherlock said, his smile widening until there were crinkles around his eyes. A tear escaped down his cheek.
“I better be the only one you’ll be kissing,” John said, and his smile got even bigger as Sherlock’s cheeks glowed a yellowish-orange and he looked away bashfully.
“John?”
“Always have,” John told him, offering Sherlock a reassuring smile for safe measure.
“I made you," Sherlock said, "because two brilliant minds are better than one.”
“The Blabbersnog must’ve given you more than the average dose of poison,” The Doctor said. “Come on, come on. What could he have been trying to find at these restaurants?”
Pulling him back into the kiss, John began to free Sherlock’s shirt buttons from their prison.
John licked his lips as he convinced himself that Mrs. Hudson was wrong. This wasn’t a date. This probably had something to do with the bloody experiment. “So, what’s for dinner?” John asked with a hint of disappointment, but he was also a bit pleased, because any experiment that had Sherlock cooking dinner was a good experiment. Actually, that wasn’t quite true, but if Mrs. Hudson thought the ingredients were acceptable enough to pick up, John would at least give the meal a taste.
Sherlock hesitated, finally feeling what John had been feeling all night. Seeing him in this state seemed to leech all the nerves from John’s body, replacing it with a need to take care of Sherlock’s needs.
Sherlock replied by turning onto his side, facing away from John. He frowned, exasperated. Sherrinford’s hand sought John’s under the blanket and John turned to face the android, who was smiling.
Sherlock slipped into the bed quietly beside him and soon he was boxed in on both sides. John couldn’t breathe well with his face pressed into the pillows this way, so he turned his head to face Sherrinford.
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “What have you done to it?” Sherlock said. He shoved past John and hurried the rest of the way to John’s room. He glanced quickly around the small room before going for the closet. He threw the door open and gasped when he saw the android curled up on the floor inside. He turned eyes that could melt metal on John. “What did you do?” he roared.
Also unbeknownst to them, when one of the men, the detective, asked John, his friend, the doctor, if he could see the creature, The Doctor was asking his companion, Rose, the same thing at the exact same time. Each of the companions responded with a firm, “yes”, both watching as the creature dug around in a trash bin before straightening with a speckled banana held in its oddly-large hand. It then proceeded to shed the peel and take two large bites, devouring the bruised fruit quickly, then it let the banana peel fall to the ground and started rooting through the trash again.
Sherlock’s eyes fell away and he looked at the room with his hands in the pockets of his belstaff coat. “I would not be averse to sharing the use of my lab and everything in it with you.”
The way the robot described Sherlock, the teen sounded like an intelligent arse, and John had a feeling that the boy would be disappointed by him once he finally found him. The thought upset John, though he couldn’t exactly explain why. For some reason, he wanted the boy to like him. From what John had heard, the human Sherlock wasn’t afraid to speak his mind, and John liked that.
John’s eyebrows went up and he looked down at Sherlock, whose breathing was rather shallow. “Is he dying?” he asked, his voice cracking slightly.
Sherlock pointed to the bed. “The pillows. There are two, one on each side of the bed, both clearly slept on.”
Never had John expected to hear those words come out of his flatmate’s mouth, so if he answered a little quickly and perhaps sounded a bit too excited, he had good reason.

Peering around the room, the candle flames reflecting in his wide, clear eyes, Sherlock’s lips parted open, giving away his surprise. Without a word, he turned and quietly shed his coat, then unbuttoned his dinner jacket and draped it across the back of John’s chair.
The room was a wasteland and it was the worst thing Sherlock had ever seen in his handful years of life. All the glass and plastic left to be buried like bodies; a metallic, powdery graveyard. He was ashamed of his mother for allowing such a thing to happen, and right beneath their very feet, too; he couldn’t look at the monstrosity a moment longer. Each day, they passed above their forgotten bodies, desecrating their final resting place with their ignorance.
“Who are you guys?” John asked as they hoisted Sherlock up between them, each of Sherlock’s arms draped over his and the other man’s shoulders and their arms around Sherlock’s back. He was like a dead weight between them.
“Sherlock Holmes,” John and The Doctor said at the same time.
“Oh? What am I really?”
John was crossing the field after another arduous day of rugby practice with some of his mates when he spotted two familiar matching figures standing on the other side of the surrounding fence. His heated skin flushed even hotter and he quickly dismissed himself from his group of friends to walk over to them.
John pulled away and stared up at Sherlock in confusion. He swears- “Sherlock, how can you be touching me? You’re not real.”
As they waited for John to get dressed, Sherlock’s mobile started to vibrate in his pocket. He withdrew it and found a text from John. He frowned, confused as to why the teen would be texting, and opened the message. For the second time that day, Sherlock was completely thrown.
“You radiate quite a lot of body heat,” Sherrinford said.
Sherlock frowned and finally leaned away from the microscope. "No," he said, sounding displeased as he looked over at John. "I was bored."
The only other place he thought he might’ve put it was in his room. He glanced toward the stairs, contemplating the ascent to get his coat for a fraction of a second before he sighed and hurried out the door after Sherlock.
“Shouldn’t be too hard to find,” Sherlock said.
Dust, Sherlock knew, meant many things. It was a handy tool in his research. It meant inattentiveness, it meant forgotten, it meant abandoned. Without fail, it marked the passage of time. Entering the flat on Baker Street for the first time in two years, a finger across the bookcase said everything it hadn’t in his time away. People often used the phrase “if walls could talk”. To Sherlock, they did, the minute flecks of dust clinging to the wallpaper instead of swirling endlessly in the air telling him two years.
John sighed and rubbed at his forehead like he was getting a headache. “I’m starting to reconsider.”
“Did you turn Sherrinford on?” John asked. He was trapped between Sherlock’s bum and Sherrinford’s apparent erection and didn’t know what to do.
“Jesus,” John said. “A million... Christ! And your brother just threw it out? That’s... that’s insane! Christ! A million? Why did it cost so much?”
“Yeah. Of course, no one can really know, because it was a different time then, but… well, I figured you guys had so much in common, it wouldn’t be a surprise if you had that in common, too.”

John sat back then and pushed Sherlock’s legs farther apart to find his entrance again. He reached for the lube again and coated the fingers of his good hand with it. They were both virgins at the moment, Sherlock never having had sex and John never having done it this way, so John was gentle as he eased his finger inside.
“Where do you keep the androids?” Sherlock asked from a distance, catching the man unaware. He slipped his feet off the desk and placed the magazine over his lap.
“Do you think Sherlock would like me?” he asked eventually.
Finally heading out the door, John held it open for Sherlock and, after swiping his sweating palm on his trousers, held out his hand. He and Sherlock weren’t really the type to flaunt their affections about, but John needed something to keep him stabilized - he was growing more heated every second. Sherlock gave pause before he took hold.
“How about… a purple creature?” he asked, raising his pointed brows.
A frown pushed down Sherlock’s blood-plump lips. “What about it?”
“Yes?”
The android turned its head and seemed to study his face with its brightly glowing eyes. “Yes.”
“Don’t you?” Sherrinford asked, frowning.
John humphed and brought the cup to his lips. He tipped it back and gulped down the remainder of his drink before getting up to bring the mug to the sink. “Is this a warning, then? Is it going to smell?” John paused and looked back at Sherlock. “Will I need to stay at Greg’s again?”
The Doctor and Rose turned and took off running, their racing footsteps echoing through the library as they went. John stayed firmly put by Sherlock’s side, his hand back in his hair and his thumb brushing back and forth over Sherlock’s warm forehead..
John blushed and Sherrinford chuckled.
The android made a loud whirring sound and turned away to do the same, turning his- its back to Sherlock. The phone in Sherlock’s pocket felt heavier for the rest of the day and into the next.
John frowned at the bot. “Shouldn’t Mycroft have deleted that before throwing you out for anyone to find?”
“Then I would call him female.” John crossed his arms. “What are you getting at?”
Sherlock decided he should probably get some sleep, too, in preparation for the following day. He quickly changed from his black trousers and white button-up into a big, soft white t-shirt and kept on his black pants. He fell asleep almost instantly and was awoken the next morning by Sherrinford shaking him awake.
The power sign glowed a soft blue and the bot came to life right before John’s eyes. It seemed to take into account its slumped position and it straightened, using its long-fingered hands to push itself off the sofa cushions. When it was in the upright position, it stared at John.
“Mrs. Hudson took them. Apparently they’re making candles at her crafts club and it was her job to pick up the supplies this time and you said she could use them,” Sherlock grumbled in frustration.
It didn’t help that Sherlock’s face was as smooth as glass. He was as calm as still waters, raising his drink to his lips and taking a steady sip as he watched John. He wasn’t missing a single thing. Though he didn’t say anything, John thought he was probably amused - dinner and a show.
“I was going to eat that,” John grunted, looking at the popcorn on the floor.
Sherlock sighed. “I didn’t tamper with your tea,” he said, a hint of annoyance in his voice. “You made me sign the agreement, remember?”
“Your lips are warm,” Sherrinford said against his mouth. “I can feel your heartbeat.”
He’s cloaked in darkness, a solo figure apart from the rest of the seated high schoolers, and his eyes light on John as soon as he arrives. Maybe John imagines it, but Sherlock’s head tilts up ever so slightly in acknowledgement as their eyes meet and he swears he sees Sherlock take in a breath. Either way, John’s blood coarses just a little faster through his veins and he feels his cheeks burn. He could blame it on the heat of the room filled with sweaty, dancing students, but he doesn’t. Sherlock has always had this affect on him, always would.
John giggled. “He seems to like me quite a lot, too.”
“His opinions are my opinions,” Sherlock told him haughtily. “If you’re worrying about consent, John, don’t. Sherrinford and I both agreed that we could benefit from the data.”
John’s skin was jumping with anticipation as he let the android slump down onto the sofa. He couldn’t resist running his fingertips along the bot’s pearly cheekbones. With the shades drawn, the shadows in the room made the android’s cheeks look razor sharp.
“Take the book,” Sherlock told him. “It’s far more informative than the one you have.”
“Nooo! Really?” The Doctor said, coming to a stop. He gave Rose a beaming smile. “Ooh, that’s brilliant.”
Disappointed in himself for being affected so easily, Sherlock decided to just get this whole situation over with. He pried his fingers under the window and tried to tug it outward, but the window was locked and the sudden shift of the pot in the dirt sent Sherlock crashing to the ground, knocking the wind out of him.
John laughed. “Better?”
“Hmm?” He looked over his shoulder at him.
“Yes.”
John eyed the spoon curiously.
“Yes?” he croaked. John cleared his throat. “Yeah?”
John sighed heavily. The truth was that he wouldn’t even slightly be considering this if Sherlock hadn’t been driving him up the wall for the past month. They had been without a case that truly captured Sherlock’s interest in far too long and Sherlock had been almost unbearable. At least until a few days ago, when Sherlock suddenly became quiet during dinner. He’d stopped trying to convince John to allow him to dissect the arm in the fridge when John had reached over and speared a piece of orange chicken out of the carton Sherlock held in his hands. Sherlock had gone completely silent, his eyes intent on the stolen chicken as John steered it into his mouth. After that, Sherlock had gotten on his computer and was still staring at the screen when John went to sleep that night.
Two separate pairs, a detective and a doctor and The Doctor and his companion, were on a case. Though they didn’t know it yet, they were on the same case, hunting the same creature, and they were only a block away from each other.
Sherlock stood in the mirror behind him, watching him in the mirror like that was a normal thing to do, watch ones naked flatmate.John sucked in a breath. He’d been seeing him everywhere and, after awhile, he’d gotten used to it. Just another brick in the barrel. He met the eyes of his best friend and let his hand trail down to his nipple. He passed his fingers over it until it hardened. Sherlock kept his eyes on him, always thinking, deducing.
Another text came in the next day when Sherlock was installing new water resistant panels where his android’s shoulder blades were. Sherlock hesitated before glancing at it, but Sherrinford had already looked at the glowing screen and he couldn’t not know something his android did.
He listened attentively for signs that his mother had left, but could hear nothing.
Today was the first day since that Sherlock hadn’t gone near his computer. Instead, Sherlock had been in his bedroom and not come out until now. Whatever this experiment of his was, it had kept him mostly quiet for the past three days, and if by agreeing John could keep Sherlock from catching the kitchen on fire again, then he would. For his sanity and no other reason, he told himself. Sherlock’s almost shy expression had nothing to do with it.
And that’s exactly what John Watson did. He picked out the casket with the rich red-brown mahogany that looked like Sherlock’s hair under the sunlight. He’d picked the headstone and the engraving. He’d immersed himself wholly in the planning.
“What? How?”
“What?”
He’s slammed against the cement wall before he’s a had the chance to breathe and what little air in his lungs is knocked out of him as he collides with the rocky, hard wall.
“Can I?” John asked, holding his hand toward Sherlock.
Sherlock shifted slightly closer to John and laid his head down on John’s pillow. “Hurry up, then,” Sherlock said.
“Then let’s go,” Sherlock said. He started to walk before pausing and holding out his hand to John hopefully.
Sherlock heard a creak and cinders swirled in the air, alive again. He turned on the hardwood, his shoes slick on the once familiar floor, and a ghost took shape in the dust particles like smoke.
“I kind of guessed," John said with a smile.
He realized Sherlock wasn’t responding and gave his hands a gentle squeeze. “Alright?”
John stared at her. “Umm… okay. Sure. I’ll just pretend that isn’t completely mad. Is this other me a doctor, too?”
“You’re not Sherlock,” the android said, bringing its hands up and tenting its fingers just underneath its chin. “I do not recognize you.”
“I’m excited to see what Sherlock is going to show me,” John said, though that wasn’t just it. Sherrinford had been flirting with him pretty much all night and John was embarrassingly starting to get aroused by it. He couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that, if Sherlock wasn’t so closed off to emotions, he would be the same way.
The sight of Sherlock’s eyes flying wide before he came was what sent John over the edge. Sherrinford stroked them both and teased his cock against John’s hole through his pyjamas, causing sparks to explode in John’s open eyes. His breath hitched in his chest and he came, pressing back against Sherrinford and his stiff cock. Sherlock kissed him through it, rolling his hips as he held John’s face in his hands. Sherlock was shaking when John came down. Panting, John wrapped his arms around him and Sherrinford held onto Sherlock’s hip, sandwiching John between them.
“Since your mother died? She must have been dying of something where there was enough time to save her, had she had the right kind of doctor, yes? And now that’s what you want to do, right? Save people by replacing their damaged parts with indestructible ones?”
A candle never failed to be put down on top of their table whenever they went to Angelo’s. At first, it had annoyed him, because no one had listened when he'd said he wasn't Sherlock's date, but now he found that it annoyed him for a whole different reason: it annoyed him because he wasn't Sherlock's date. John stared at the dancing flame as he spun noodles around and around his fork and shoved them into his mouth.
John looked up at the silly-haired man and growled, “who the bloody hell are you?”
Sherlock was different. He could be eerily quiet for long periods of time, he could talk a mile a minute, and he could take anyone apart in seconds flat. He was also bloody gorgeous, especially when he allowed a smile on his full lips, and, despite the fact that he seemed cool and collected, the second John said something even slightly complimentary, Sherlock became shy. He wouldn’t be able to meet John’s eyes and there was a softness to his features that made John want to keep telling Sherlock just how brilliant he was.
“You took my android! Where did you put it?” Sherlock yelled.
“I like it,” John admitted as he set his glass down on the rich blue table cloth. Sherlock had been the one to choose the restaurant. John had tried to steer him to a more poor-friendly McDonald’s, but Sherlock had refused and told John that he would pay.
Heat spread downward and John closed his eyes, willing himself not to react to the thought. That would never happen. He wasn’t gay and Sherlock wasn’t… Well, he didn’t know what Sherlock was. Definitely not interested in him. If Sherlock were to be interested in anyone, it would be a sexy, beautiful, intelligent woman, like Irene Adler, or someone who could keep him thoroughly transfixed, like Moriarty. Not someone who wore too many jumpers, woke from nightmares of war, and could barely keep up with him; not someone like John.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m always careful,” Sherlock replied. Unseen by John, Sherlock quirked his lips into a smile and rounded the corner, directly into another set of lips, which planted themselves rather sloppily across Sherlock’s. The creature they belonged to was kissing him and as it did, Sherlock’s lips began to tingle.
“I didn’t know you were so modest,” John said.
“Yeah, all right,” John said, feeling his ears warm. “It was good meeting you, too, Rose. Maybe you should, too, you know.”
“What’s going on?” John whispered. He wanted to peer around the edge of the deep doorway, but that was a rookie mistake that might put them both in danger.
The door clicked open and Sherlock entered.
“Hello, Sherlock, I see you’ve found me. John has taken good care of me. I like him.”
“Actually,” Sherlock said, leaning away from his colourful project and turning John’s way. “I was hoping to make dinner for you tonight.”
The girl’s blue eyes widened when she looked at them. “Wow, you guys are twins, right?”
John worried the inside of his bottom lip as the android Sherlock came to life.
“Well, I think you should call him something else.”
“What?” John asked, slitting his eyes at Sherlock.
John laughed lightly and glanced over at the sleeping detective in his arms. He felt a blush warm his cheeks. “Yeah, I know that feeling.”
Later that night, after John had finished his homework and eaten leftovers from the night before, he had the android follow him to his bedroom. He walked to his bedroom door and turned around to watch as the robot trailed after him. He was surprised by how fluid the bot’s movements were as it came to him and he couldn’t take his eyes off of it.
John’s frowned worriedly and crossed the room to perch on the table beside them. “Very good, thanks,” he answered, peering into the open plate at the back of Sherrinford’s head. “Um… what are you doing?” he asked Sherlock when he prodded at a purple wire.
Not one stair creaked as they ascended toward Sherlock’s room. There were pictures lining the staircase, each one a picture of someone else. They ranged from painting to faded photographs to glossy pictures; old and new. It wasn’t until he got to the top that he found one with Sherlock on it. He paused on the stairs and studied the picture. It was of Sherlock and a man in about his 30’s. He had a slightly scruffy, peppered chin, soft looking black hair with subtle waves, and a laughing smile that lit his face and crinkled his eyes. Sherlock, perhaps 7 years old, stood beside him in front of a lake holding a frog by one foot. He was covered in mud from the waist down and the rest of him was soaking wet. Sherlock also had a proud smile on his young face.
Hearing this, Rose hopped off the metal bar she was sat on and walked over to them. She put her hands on John’s arms and smiled. “It was nice to meet you, John,” she said, before pulling him into a quick hug. “Maybe consider doing that thing we talked about?” she said under her breath, tilting her head toward Sherlock and raising her eyebrows suggestively.
“It’s… bigger in here than it is out there,” John murmured, sounding awestruck. “Jesus.”
"I wanted to see if they were as comfortable as they looked," Sherlock admitted.
For once, Sherlock was eating, so at least one thing was working out.
John smiled and turned onto his back. “You can definitely do that. Just as soon as I’ve had some sleep.”
“What’s that?”
Sherlock hesitated a moment before answering. “If you want me to stop, I will stop.”
Sherrinford’s hand squeezed his thigh gently. “It did turn out well for us the last time,” he supplied.
“I couldn’t bear not seeing you,” John said. He gently pushed apart Sherlock’s legs so that he was framed between them and then kneeled on the mattress. He leaned down with his arms on either side of Sherlock, bracing himself as he leaned down to kiss Sherlock soft and slow.
“I don’t want to hold your hand.”
Sherlock glared at him. “Then why is it silver? It shouldn’t be bloody silver!”
Sherlock turned away to hide his smile.
It was nice, preparing dinner with Sherlock. Though they’d never cooked together like this, they had a good understanding of how the other worked, so when one went one way, the other went the opposite way. Not a single elbow was jostled until they were standing side-by-side watching the minutes tick down to meal time.
“I love you,” John reassured him. “No matter.”
“What’d you do that for?” John asked as Sherlock moved past him and carried Sherrinford back to his chair.
John turned toward the android with a smile and his lips were quickly caught up in a kiss. John grunted at the force of it and Sherlock hissed.
“The android. It’s a machine, like you said, it doesn’t have gender, but you keep calling it ‘him’.”
Sherlock yanked his hand out of his pocket and grabbed onto John’s in a huff.
“I wanted to try an experiment,” Sherlock said.
“Yes, Rose, the banana pudding!”
John shrugged as nonchalantly as he could, but his skin felt like it was vibrating and every hair felt as if it was standing on end. He climbed onto the bed and crawled to the middle, then flopped down on his front. There was a situation in his pants he didn’t want to have to explain away.
A blush blazed across John’s cheeks and he shrugs. “I just thought maybe we could get to know each other better, is all. I like you guys, even though you’re a bit of an arse.”
The twins chuckled and John’s body filled with warmth at the sound. He turned and watched as they passed through the city on the way to Sherlock’s house. And if he blushed when Sherrinford’s pinky brushed against his as he laid his hand down on the seat, or when Sherlock, seated across from him, bumped his foot against John’s, neither of them noticed.
The first thing John noticed was that it wasn't just a robot, but an android. It was clear to him that the bot he’d unburied was expensive. He had never seen one like it before with metal almost like porcelain and pieces so delicately shaped the planes of its metal looked nearly human. If John didn’t know better, the android could have passed as a person resting on his bedroom floor, lips slightly parted as if to breathe and all. The only thing that was missing was a heartbeat.
“You’re attracted to my android.”
His gloved fingers were laced into the chain link fence as he stood waiting. He wasn’t stupid enough to risk a torch, not after the last time, so he put together a map in his head of the direction he would go when the time came. His eyes danced over the towering silhouettes of the junk piles on the other side of the metal fence as he tried to remember which piles he’d searched and which he’d wanted to get a better look at.
John looked at Sherlock in confusion. “That’s not how he normally looks?”
“Um... Sherlock?” John whispered, hoping Sherlock wasn’t awake. His arm was trapped underneath Sherlock’s lithe frame and his hard cock was nudging between Sherlock’s arse cheeks.
"You were right. The body was found in Regents Park. Will you come?" said the first text. "His hair has recently been dyed blue and he has new piercings on his face and ears. Wife not aware. Weird. Are you coming Sherlock?" read the second. "Please message if not coming," said the last one. John glanced up at Sherlock and saw a big smile on his friend's face. "Interested, then?"
Sherlock, on the other hand, sat with his elbows resting on both armrests and his hands folded over his flat belly. He was watching the big screen in front of them, because, as he said, they couldn’t both watch the door.
“Noope,” Sherlock answered slowly. John glanced over his shoulder to watch as Sherlock mixed the tube lubricants together and happened to notice the jar of Prego resting on the table near Sherlock’s elbow. He quickly stood up.
“The tingling should stop within a week,” The Doctor explained, “but the colour should go away within just a few hours.” He handed Sherlock the antidote and gave him two thumbs up. “I suggest you swallow it quickly.”
The android met John’s eyes with its silver lights. “If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that Sherlock will try to find me. After all, nothing would satisfy him more than to find me and show Mycroft.”
John frowned and swallowed the jell-o before going for another spoonful. He took a bite and his eyebrows went up.
Some of the boys matched the height, some the gait, and the rare few even bore the same treads on their trainers, but it wasn’t until the final students were trickling out that he found the perfect match for the footprints.
One of the dogs snarled and leapt through the air. Its jaws clamped down on the leg of John’s jeans and gave it a mighty tug, nearly ripping John free of the fence and the jeans. He clung to the fence with all his might as he tried to shake off the dog and climb at the same time. He heard pounding footsteps charging through the dark toward him and he kicked out wildly, trying to dislodge the dog without hurting it.
“Right about what?” Sherlock asked with his cheeks almost completely orange now. His eyes were warm and shiny as he looked up at John.
“Really?”
“What makes you so sure?”
John shrugged. “I like knowing what people are thinking.”
“The first time he was captured, after he left Dodola, the Blabbersnog had been eating a bowl of banana pudding! He must be trying to find it again.”
The silence from his flatmate was telling. He knew Sherlock’s eyes were on him, so he avoided looking back. Thankfully, a hint of green among the audience caught John’s attention at the corner of his eye and he turned slowly to look at the crowd behind him.
Sherlock glanced over and watched as John and Rose walked away, then he returned his gaze to the TARDIS’s control panel. A burst of red spread from Sherlock’s temples as he studied the curious buttons and cranks and within moments, he was almost completely the colour of a cherry.
Sherlock studied John’s face and he looked just as vulnerable as Sherlock felt. They were still for a moment, neither of them saying a word, before John couldn’t keep his hands to himself any longer and reached up toward Sherlock. He cupped Sherlock’s face in his hand. “Come down here,” he said, his voice suddenly rough.
He slid his arm into the second strap of his backpack so that his shoulders held the weight and offered his hand to the android. When their palms slid together, John took a quick breath. “Christ, your hand is freezing!”
Thank you for reading!
John paused at the weird question and recited it in his head. “Kiss him? No. Well, I found him like this. I don’t know,” John explained. His mouth turned down at the corners. “Wait. Creature. Why do you keep saying creature?”
Sherlock pressed his parted lips together and nodded. “Alright,” he said, with a slight tremor in his voice that John missed as the timer went off.
John's body jolted as he processed what was going on around him and nodded. "Yeah," he murmured distractedly as he turned off the burner, then walked down the short hall to Sherlock's room. He didn't see the phone right away, but another text alert drew his attention to Sherlock's bedside drawer. John pulled it open without a thought and froze at what he found.
“That’s why you need to tell him, John. You can’t let it go unsaid again, can you?”
“Is it my birthday?” he asked, finally meeting John’s eyes.
After reading all his entries on his blog for the millionth time, John finally decided to retire. He took the dredges of his tea into the kitchen and placed his cup in the sink, then headed to his room.
John fiddled with his spoon. “People do wonder about us,” he admitted. “But we’re not… we’re not a couple.” He shrugged and took a bite of chocolate cheesecake to busy himself and he avoided eye contact.
“And what did you tell her?” John asked, his heart doing something slightly concerning in his chest at the comment.
Sherrinford was fairly quiet through the lesson, sitting off to the side with a book in his hand. At one point, he placed a tray with tea on the table beside John and prepared him a cup while observing them. He complimented John on how well he was doing and even brushed John’s hair back from his forehead and dabbed his brow with a napkin. That had stunned John into silence and he felt Sherlock’s body still against him.
They walked hand-in-hand the rest of the way home, John clasping onto Sherlock like he just might float away if he were to let go. Once they reached 221, John held the door open for Sherlock and followed closed behind him up the stairs. He stopped the taller man outside of the door to their flat with a hand on his sleeve.
“Same way we came in.”
“Mycroft!” he yelled at the top of his lungs, so that his voice echoed through the halls. “If you did anything to it, Mycroft, so help me, I
“I told you that you didn’t have to pick up the shopping anymore, Mrs. Hudson. If Sherlock needs something, he can go get it himself.”
John huffed a laugh. “People might talk,” he said. Sherrinford laughed warmly and Sherlock softly.
There was a barely imperceptible turn of Sherlock’s head and they were eye to eye once more.
Sherlock sought refuge in the only place no one else could go (or even fit if they tried) - his pirate ship. He closed the wooden door and threw the lock (his own personal addition to his father’s creation) before immediately sinking against the door’s support and burying his face in his knees.
Sherlock followed the boy at a distance all the way to his small, rectangle-shaped house. When they got there, the boy unlocked the door and slipped inside and, as Sherlock quickly hurried toward the door, threw the lock.
, read the next text. Sherlock smiled unabashedly.
The movie quickly passed without John’s notice and the credits soon began to roll. John leaned forward and switched the empty popcorn bowl for the remote and sat back down to shut off the telly. Sherrinford’s hand immediately returned to rest on his thigh and John swallowed.
"Experiment."
John’s eyebrows went up. “Oh?”
John held onto the bucket of popcorn with one hand and clutched a handful of said buttery popcorn in the other. Every so often he would crunch on a piece or two, but never too many at once, because when the time came for him to run, he didn’t want to die by inhaling a piece and choking to death. He could just imagine Sherlock’s disappointment if he went out that way.
Needless to say, when John walked out of his bedroom, he found two very different expressions looking back at him. On Sherrinford, there was a beaming, pleased smile. On Sherlock, he could have sworn he saw fear edging in around the mask of calm Sherlock wore on his face.
“More often than not. Dad works until 10 and Harry’s usually at Clara’s. Want something to eat?” he asked, headed for the kitchen.
I've been struggling my way out of some pretty intense writer's block. I'm very sorry for the wait.
The mention of Sherrinford made John peer around the room. “Where is he, by the way?”
They made their way over to John’s couch and sat down to wait for him. When the water started up, Sherlock wondered what John would say if he asked to join him in the shower, then his cheeks began to burn at the direction his thoughts had gone. He turned toward the t.v. and stared at the black screen. Thankfully they didn’t have to wait for long, because a little over 5 minutes later John stepped out of the steamy bathroom wrapped in a towel. He turned to look at them in the living room and smiled as drops of water ran down his chest, then he continued on his way to his bedroom.
“Yes. Fine. You can do your experiment.”
John paused his hand. He pulled away the cup that had just barely grazed his lips and looked down into the dark brown liquid.
“I’ll have our driver drop you off.”
With wide eyes, Sherlock covered John with all of him. His erection pressed into John’s hip, the cloth already damp with pre-come. John rolled his hips upward, seeking any friction he could find.
John looks back at their hands and slips his out from underneath Sherlock’s. He tucks them into his jacket pockets, then turns to look out the window. His heart is racing a mile a minute as he tries to focus his sight on the passing scenery outside, but the reflection of Sherlock still looking at him seems to fill up all his vision. John closes his eyes and rests his head against the glass and tries not to think of how soft Sherlock’s hands are. It isn’t until later that he realizes that Sherlock hadn’t been wearing gloves and he tries to convince himself that Sherlock was just trying to warm those long fingers of his. Even later still, upon catching a glimpse of that blood red folder of Sherlock's, John realizes his stupidity at hoping it was something other than an experiment.
“I’m telling you that you can,” Sherlock said, turning to face him head on. “I... enjoy your company, John, and there’s plenty to go around.”
“Try it,” Rose said, grinning.
John groaned. “What about Sherrinford?”
He made quick work of revealing the metal underneath the caked on dirt. The water in the cup was swirling with the dirt by the time he was satisfied. He marked the android’s price tag up even more when he found that the now clean metal had a pearly shimmer. The android took his breath away and he removed his gloves to brush his fingers along its forearm. It actually surprised him to find that the android was ice cold. The lack of dirt revealed a tiny hairline fracture along the side of the bot's right eyebrow ridge, most likely from John's mistreatment of it earlier that night.
John made the decision to slice through the food with his spoon and brought it to his lips. He sniffed at it before hesitantly sticking his tongue out and tasting it. It was flavourless.
“Mm,” Sherlock hummed, keeping his eyes fixed on a test tube as he eased a blue blob inside to join a green one already resting at the bottom.
“I’m what?” Sherlock said confusedly, thinking he’d heard his friend wrong. His ears were ringing, after all. Suddenly his arm went out from under him and he fell forward onto the pavement. He turned a rich shade green the moment he hit the ground.
He sat up quickly and gasped for air, glancing around in embarrassment. He was well hidden by the wooden fence around the perimeter of the property. He grunted as he pushed himself to standing and dusted the dirt off his clothes.
“Can we visit John today?” the android asked when Sherlock was sitting him down for his weekly maintenance check.
“Mycroft had threatened Sherlock on many occasions to throw me away. It appears he has finally followed through.”
Sherlock was going to get his android back, whether Mycroft liked it or not.
Sherlock didn’t bother looking at the bag, because he knew exactly what was inside. He seethed at his brother, barely keeping himself from lunging across the desk and throttling him. “You can’t do this, Mycroft! Give. It. Back!”
"I'm going to need to wear one of your jumpers."
A smile eased onto Sherlock’s face, but it quickly fell when he saw the matching smile on his android’s mouth. He shoved the phone away and went back to screwing the panel into place.
“Right? Now, macaroni and cheese.”
John furrowed his brow at the back of Sherlock’s head of curls. What did that mean? “Have you… you know?” he asked, cheeks blazing.
John’s exhaustion started to catch up to him and he yawned. “You can lay down beside me if you want,” he told the android with his eyes still closed. He waited until he heard movement and the bed dipped beside him before he opened them to peer at the android. It laid down on the mattress and John propped himself up on an arm. The android had told him earlier that it could be charged by a power outlet and John popped open the back of the android’s neck to stretch out the cord inside so he could charge it.
“That suit,” Sherlock said after a long stretch of quiet, still facing out the window. “It looks nice on you.”
After applying an ointment and putting on a band-aid, John left the bathroom.
“Quite likely. If so, he will surely find me.”
Sherlock turned in his arms and met John’s eyes. “I’m sorry,” he said softly.
“Spaghetti and meatballs,” Rose informed him, handing him a clear purple spoon.
Sherlock kicked the flower pot in frustration and the brown ceramic cracked down the side. With throbbing toes, he circled back around to the front door and banged his fist on the wood before he could change his mind. He waited for the boy to answer for less than a minute before he heard the shuffling on the other side of the door and a pause where the boy most likely looked through the peephole. There was a long moment, then the door was unlocked and the boy cracked open the door to peer out at Sherlock with nearly grey blue eyes.
“You wouldn’t have happened to see a man around here just now, have you?”
Sherlock held John’s gaze for one long, searching moment before he swallowed and his eyes flickered down. “Yes.” He coughed and his eyes drifted closed again.
“It’s alright.”
John was pretty well informed from his own readings, but kept mum, because he enjoyed the warmth of Sherlock pressed to his back and his breath tickling his ear. Sometimes, Sherlock even took John’s hand in his and guided his instrument to the proper place. Thoughts of that morning kept filling his mind and he did his best to ignore them. Sherlock seemed to want to pretend it had never happened. By the end of the night, John’s palms were damp and his whole body was tingling with want.
“Go away!”
“I can do it,” he’d said. He’d been unsure about which one of them it would be left up to. Upon hearing Mycroft’s offer, he’d finally been given the permission to plan the funeral of his best friend.
Sherrinford smiled brightly at him and wandered away to grab their coats and shoes, making a pleased humming sound as he went.
John glanced over at him as they began to walk. “What?”
“Goodnight, love,” John murmured, pressing his lips to Sherlock's skin. "Sweet dreams."
John sighed. So that’s what Mrs. Hudson had been trying to ask him this morning. He’d been in a hurry on his way out the door because Sherlock had had a mishap with the toaster, so John had called out, “yes, yes, Mrs. Hudson, whatever you need,” as he quickly raced out the door.
John startled at the sudden burst of colour, then he surged forward to rush to his friend’s side. “Sherlock!” John dropped to his knees and reached out for Sherlock.
"Hmm?" John replied as he paused inside to pull off his coat. The chill of the cold outside lingered in its fabric and made him shiver.
Sherlock cleared his throat and put his hands down. “Yes.”
John shook his head. "She just likes her hair short."
John watched as an unabashed smile stretched across Sherlock’s lips and he grinned proudly back. He always felt like he’d done something brilliant when he managed to make Sherlock smile like that.
John laughed and went back to his food, but his stomach was twisting in knots and as hungry as he was, he really didn’t feel like he could eat right now.
“You have an android worth near a million pounds in your bedroom that isn’t yours. I doubt you’re going to risk anyone finding out.”
“Positive.”
John chuckled and went on to stare at the strange jell-o like food. He poked at it. “Does it actually taste like spaghetti and meatballs?”
“Whatever do you mean?” Mycroft said with faux-innocence, leaning back in his chair and clasping his hands together over the legal pad atop his desk.
“Goodnight, John.”
“Yes,” John said. “My mother could have been saved with a new heart and lungs, but the doctors... it was risky to begin with, she was in such bad condition, but they nicked her heart and she didn’t make it.”
“Yeah, well, it looks like a man, it sounds like a man, it says it’s a man, so it’s a man.”
John groaned.
John clenched his teeth together and lashed out with his fist at the mirror. The glass clattered into the sink and onto the floor around him as he stood there seething. He didn’t even feel the pain in his hand. He probably wouldn’t have noticed he’d been injured if it wasn’t for the bright red of his blood dripping onto the floor.
“Eh,” John said. “So so.”
With just himself and the imagined Sherlock in the room, John slowly backed up toward his bed. When the mattress bumped at his legs, he sank down, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s for fear that he’d disappear.
Sherlock went to the cabinet and pulled out a pair of silky purple pyjama bottoms and an extra large black t-shirt. He turned his back on John and stripped off his clothes, revealing his long, pale limbs. His skin looked so smooth and soft. John wanted to reach out and run his hands over the expanse of his back, just to see how it felt.
“So...”
Mrs. Hudson waved her hand in the air with a smile on her way out the door. “I’m just returning the favor,” she said. “You boys have fun tonight. I’ll be staying at Mrs. Turner’s,” she informed them with a wink before closing the door between her and a gaping John.
“Mhmm,” Sherlock nodded with his eyes closed. “Continue.”
He looked down at the book Sherrinford had been reading and frowned. He picked it up and tossed it in the trash. “He’s been reading my mother’s romantic drivel.”
His mother sighed and he heard her dramatically shuffle back. “Okay, you can open it now.”
Sherlock gripped John’s knee with his thin fingers. “I’m here, John. I’m real.”
John snapped to attention immediately.
“So, what did you think?” he asked Sherlock, turning to him with hopeful curiosity and a blush warming his cheeks due to the android’s hand and its close proximity to John’s cock.
“I don’t want to talk to you!” he shouted.
“Please,” he stuttered, gripping his cock at the root. He hadn’t heard Sherlock in so long. Christ, his voice did things to him. He reached with his other hand for the lube in his bedside table and fumbled to squeeze it into his hand.
Sherlock’s tongue was hot and awkward as it tangled with John’s, but Sherlock learned quickly. Soon he was kissing John back with great fervor, sliding his tongue along John’s and making John tremble with want. His fingers made their way to the back of John’s neck and he slid them into John’s hair, holding John’s head close so he could kiss him more deeply.
“Apparently he didn’t know that Sherlock had a separate memory storage built into my left ankle.”
John smiled. “God, that sounds awful. I can’t really imagine Sherlock not complaining the whole time about sand being between his toes.”
“Oh, am I now?”
John ate the mirror piece and his face scrunched up as the sweet tang burst on his tongue. “I’m not a big fan of sweets,” he said.
“How do you know it’s a ‘him’?” she asked, glancing back at the creature to make sure it was still there, but mainly just to hide the colour in her cheeks.
“Getting you away from her. Mary clearly wants to have sex with you, John. She had to know that you were already taken.”
Like ash from a destructive volcano, dust blanketed every surface, smothering everything in its wake with layers of its fine, choking grey. The dust dulled the silver surfaces and it swirled in the long-abandoned room, disturbed, and it filled each breath he pulled into his small lungs, suffocating him.
Sherlock grimaced as his skin flared green. “At least… three seconds,” he said, sounding pained.
The sliding entrance fence was pulled aside to allow entrance and rocks rolled under Sherlock’s feet as he passed through the opening.
John was about to open his mouth the speak, to tell Rose that Sherlock wasn’t like that, that Sherlock didn’t feel the same way for him, when there was an audible step in the doorway. John and Rose looked up to see Sherlock standing in the open arch. His skin was a swirl of blue and yellow and what John thought might’ve actually been a hint of orange, but it disappeared almost as soon as John saw it.
The android’s lights glowed brighter in the way John had come to realize meant that it was thinking and then it made the buzzing hum sound again. “It would appear that some damage may have been caused in that region.”
“Mycroft!” Sherlock blared, bounding across the room and its brilliantly red carpet. He slammed his hands down on the desk, making his hands sting and ignoring it so he could glare at his brother instead. “That was an accident and you know it! I forgot to return the hand to the morgue. I didn't leave it in the teacher's fridge on purpose!”
“You can come in now!” John called, setting the bottle of champagne down on the coffee table with a final thump.
Sherlock knew before he even checked the computer that his brother had at least thought to turn the android’s tracker off. He hoped his brother hadn’t damaged the android too badly in the process.
“Bananas?” The Doctor questioned. He tapped his fingers on his lips. “Bananas!” he suddenly exclaimed excitedly. “Oh, you’re brilliant! You really are!” The Doctor grinned and grabbed Sherlock by the cheeks. He planted a kiss on his forehead. “The bananas, Rose!”
“It’s the first of its kind. No other android has a camouflage interface like it. It also has the ability to repair itself. The android must have hit its head at some point, but there is no damage to be seen.”
John sighed and shoved the spoon into his mouth. It tasted just like spaghetti and meatballs. “Wow, that’s…” John chewed. “Actually quite good.”
John and Sherlock looked over at the android. “What?” John asked carefully around his mouthful.
John’s foot grazed against Sherrinford’s calf and he froze. Sherlock stilled above him and looked at him, concerned. “All right?” he asked.
“And this Mycroft guy is?” John asked curiously. What the hell kind of names were Sherlock and Mycroft?
Sherlock grinned back. “Would you like to get some lunch? I’m starving.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes in annoyance. “You only had the one?”
“After you, John,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock sighed heavily. “The metal that makes up this android has abilities similar to that of a chameleon or a cuttlefish where it can mimic the colors around it to fit in or, rather, disappear. I wanted to give it the ability to mimic whatever shape I chose, so I could make it look like whomever I wanted, but Mycroft threatened to tell Mummy and have my funds denied to me.” Sherlock huffed. “The android is supposed to share my exact coloring.”
“Hmm?” John typed a few words for his blog.
“‘Orange’,” John started. He at Sherlock and smiled as he watched the tangerine colour spread across the bridge of Sherlock’s nose. “You heard me and Rose talking, didn’t you?”
John himself laughed as he eased out his fingers, causing Sherlock to frown at the loss of having John inside him. “You’ve lost your marbles, love.”
“Mycroft will know,” Sherlock remarked.
There was a quiet rustle of cloth as Sherlock shifted in the bed and faced the back of John. “I would like to kiss you for experiment purposes, as well.”
There, sitting three rows back and to his left, was their suspect, making out with the dead girl’s mother. John stared openly in disbelief. He turned quickly back to Sherlock, but he was already gone.
There is some Sherlock/John/Sherrinford in this chapter. Nothing
"Have you seen my scarf?" John asked as he got ready to face the freezing cold. "I couldn't find it this morning."
“Apparently inside a time machine,” John told him, and he laughed at how absurd it sounded.
“There was one in one of those piles over there,” the old man said, waving his hand over toward the heaps of rubbish, “but someone broke in here last night and stole it. Bloody coppers said there weren’t nothing they could do about it.” The man scratched at his gray beard flecked with white, then went back to looking in the magazine.
“Purple is the current colour of choice among Blabbersnog males at the moment,” The Doctor told her, whacking his sonic screwdriver against his hand. It had started acting up earlier that day and The Doctor was having a hell of a time to get it to light up again. “They can be any colour of the rainbow, even colours your human eyes can’t detect,” he said, wiggling his fingers in front of her’s. She laughed and swatted his hand away before turning around to watch him unscrew the top of the sonic screwdriver and jiggle a metal wire inside.  “It’s looked down on in their society if you stand out from the crowd, so they tend to wear the same colour. The women are currently blue,” The Doctor said. “Like the TARDIS!”
When there was no reaction from Sherlock, Sherrinford called to him. “Sherlock, did you hear that? John said you can kiss him.”
“Hmm?” he answered, sounding too much like someone caught dipping their hand in the cookie jar.
He slowly eased inside of Sherlock, watching Sherlock’s face as he winced and held his breath. John didn’t stop until he was buried inside of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nearly picked it up to reply Not as well as I’d hoped, but then his eye caught on the android who hadn’t failed to miss the text alert, either, and decided against it. Sherlock ignored the text and went back to his experiment, turning his blow torch back on.
“My uncle Sherrinford,” Sherlock informed him, answering John’s unasked question. “The frog was dead in the water and he said I could dissect it if only I got it myself.”
“Once was enough, thanks,” Sherlock said, sounding breathless.
Sherlock and Sherrinford glanced over at him from either side of him and both wore worried frowns.
John blinked. “Huh. That… sounds familiar.”
“By creature, he means alien,” the blond girl chimed in. “A Blabbersnog.”
“No,” John said firmly.
“Sherlock will find me,” the android said once more, matter-of-factly. “Sherlock needs me.”
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down into a hard kiss. He held him tightly against himself. If it hurt, it had to be real, he told himself. He pulled away and quickly pressed in again, kissing even harder. He forced Sherlock’s lips open and met his tongue with his own. He trailed his hands down and dug his fingers into Sherlock’s hips as he tugged him toward the bed.
“Isn’t that a little… creepy?”
“Well, in my universe, you and Sherlock are made up characters in a book from Victorian London,” Rose told him.
Sherlock frowned at that. “It says what I’ve coded it to say. If I coded it to say female, than it would say it was female.”
“It’s like the guy’s a government agent or something," John groaned. "Is he a spy?” he asked excitedly.
"You’re confused," Sherlock explained. "You’re sexually attracted to me, a male, and an android that is also, technically, male.”
Upon first glance, the metal looked like it was just a thick pipe, but John knew better. He held his breath as he tugged on the metal leg. He knew not to get his hopes up; it wasn’t rare for him to come across random pieces of broken robots, but the leg didn’t budge. Heart racing, John began to push the junk surrounding the robot leg out of the way. His digging revealed a hip that was attached to a torso. He wrapped his arms around the middle of the bot and gave it a hearty pull.
“Oh god,” Sherlock groaned. “This is painful.”
The robot’s eyes lit on John and it made a buzzing sound that John thought was probably supposed to be a hum. “That explains it, then.”
John’s mouth parted and he looked over at Sherlock, whose eyes glanced over at him nervously. “I couldn’t possibly,” John said, shaking his head. “That’s way too much money, Sherlock. No, I can’t.”
Sherlock’s lips on his cheek were feather soft. He kissed the tear lingering on John’s cheek and kept his lips pressed there, breathing John in for the first time since his ‘death’.
“Well good luck with that,” John said. “There’s almost nothing in there.”
“He’s right there,” John said, trying to get control of himself. “I can’t just…”
“You keep calling it ‘him’. Why is that?”
Things will start picking up a bit more in the next chapter, I promise!
John wrestled their killer’s wrists behind his back and looked up at Sherlock with the man's thick wrists clasped in his hands. His friend was grinning with a brightness in his eyes that looked a lot like pride and John couldn't help but grin back at him.
A knock on the door made him press more fully against it, his body a barricade against the forces of ultimate evil. “Go away!” he shouted, his small voice sounding like a shrill wail.
John glanced over at Sherlock, who was currently crouching on the ground and poking at a banana peel with a pair of tweezers. “Um… no.”
John smiled and turned over to face Sherlock. “Not because you like me and would like to kiss me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
John dragged his fingers lightly down passed his belly, pausing only once he reached the waistband of his boxers. His cock already strained at the fabric, just from Sherlock’s eyes being on him. He gripped himself, pre-come dampening the front of his pants. He eased the boxers down and left them in a pool on the floor as he turned around to face Sherlock.
He went back to the front of the house and retrieved a flower pot beside the porch, then walked back around the house to the boy's window. He upturned the pot and stepped on top, gripping the window ledge with his fingertips. He pulled himself up and stood on tiptoes to peer inside.
Sherlock smiled. He was glad he hadn't watched the boy dress, because the twisting feeling in his belly was already overwhelming enough . “What gave it away?”
He knew it was none of his business, but this was possibly the only answer he'd ever get to one of the questions that had plagued him for years and he was going to take it if he could. He tilted up a few of the other bottles and noticed that each of them had been used at least once. An image of Sherlock spreading the liquid on his cock filled John's head and his neck flushed.
The words startled a laugh out of John and he glanced awkwardly around the luminescent cinema. It wasn't exactly rare for Sherlock to make sex jokes, but it always took John by surprise. He knew it was stupid to think that Sherlock didn't know anything about sex, but the jokes always made John think of Sherlock in those situations and he really shouldn't do that in public, especially with said friend's eyes on him.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked up from John’s cock and met his. “Yes, John?”
“Fine!” Sherlock hissed. He stuck the Shih Tzu fur back into the plastic bag titled with the same name and stood. “Let’s go.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together tensely and John must’ve noticed, because he laughed softly.
He used the pre-come to slick up his cock and started working Sherlock, matching the pace of his hand to his thrusts.
“Because you’re attracted to me. Also, it slept in your bed last night.”
Unfortunately, it didn’t appear to be working out so well. They had barely spoken since they’d arrived, and though Sherlock seemed not to mind it one bit - it was how these things normally went with them - the lack of conversation was making John feel even more nervous without anything to occupy himself with but his thoughts.
John closed his eyes, needing a moment to prepare himself before he opened them again. “Sherlock?” he said, barely above a whisper. He reached out and took Sherlock’s wrist in his hand. “It’s fine,” he murmured. “It’s all fine.”
He wondered what Sherlock might think of the black headstone. John thought it was quite fitting, actually. It somehow managed to portray the mysterious, beautiful dead man whose body lay 6 feet under John’s feet.
John gaped at the man. “Is there are way to save him?” he said, his voice wavering slightly. He clenched his jaw and looked down at his friend’s closed eyelids.
“I love you,” John told him. While Sherlock had been “dead”, John had spent a lot of time thinking about the other man. Hurting from losing him. Aching for him. And he realized that it had to be love.
“You know what I meant!” Sherlock said, sounding exasperated.
The Doctor sighed and tucked his hands into his pockets. “We’ll take him to Dodalo and from there, they’ll get him back to the Howling Halls.”
When John got outside, the street was nearly empty and there was no Sherlock in sight. He groaned and reached into his pocket to dig out his phone when he saw a familiar figure disappearing around the corner to his right. John turned and took off after him.
“Where is Sherlock?” the robot asked, its eyes scanning the room behind John. It seemed to understand that it wasn’t where it normally would find itself, that he was in a foreign place.
“Three…”
Sherlock blushed and tried to write a reply 3 different times before settling on,
“No,” Sherlock answered quickly. John eyed him suspiciously, but Sherlock looked like he was being honest. “Last time you said ‘no’ I nearly lost an eyebrow, Sherlock.”
John dropped his hands but stood his ground. “You know, technically the android is mine,” he said.
“You’re wrong,” John said, tracing Sherlock’s plump bottom lip with his thumb. He could feel Sherlock tremble in his arms and it made him feel a little more confident that this was okay. “It’s not about that, though I definitely didn’t see it coming. It’s just… of course you would see sex as just something to get data from. But it’s more, Sherlock. It can be so much more. It can be a way for people to be closer to each other, to show someone how much you care for them. But I don’t mind if you experiment on me a little.”
When Sherlock arrived at the salvage yard, he saw a man sitting a rusty metal desk with his feet propped up on top of it as he leaned back in his chair looking at a magazine with naked and curvaceous women on the pages.
Sherrinford frowned. “I’m sorry. I did not mean to jump to conclusions.”
Sherlock gaped at the android. “The speed of its speech has returned to factory settings and it appears to be forming its own opinions again...” Sherlock murmured. “The camouflage interface has been damaged.”
I hope you're liking it! :D
“Touch the androids hair.”
John nodded and they all three rose to go. Sherlock pulled out his wallet and dropped money on the table and they headed out together. Once they were out on the sidewalk, John glanced over at Sherlock, unsure of what was going to happen then, whether or not they were headed back to his house or if they were parting ways there and then. He felt strangely lonely standing there knowing this might be the last time he ever saw Sherlock and Sherrinford.
“He looks a lot like you, mate,” John said carefully.
Alone in the bathroom, John braced his hands on the sink and dropped his head, trying to calm himself so he wouldn’t kill Sherlock himself. How could he do this to him, John asked himself, gripping the porcelain sink even tighter. He was supposed to be his friend!
Another sigh and he heard his mother’s footsteps shuffle closer. He felt a thump against the door and could hear her sliding down to sit, leaning against the door opposite him. “What’s wrong, my boy?”
“John,” Sherlock said, after long minutes of silence. They hadn’t spoken a word since John had asked Sherlock if he was going to eat and Sherlock had told him ‘no’. John was used to it by now, eating while having Sherlock sit there with him, an empty space where a plate of food should be in front of him. He made plans to got out to pick up something to eat, since there was nothing edible in the fridge.
They started over to him and the girl’s smile fell when she noticed John smiling at them. “Mary, this is Sherlock and Sherrinford.”
“You’re an idiot,” Sherlock grumbled.
“So how do we find this… this Blabbersnog bloke?” John asked, joining Sherlock on the floor.
John's eyebrows furrowed and he slowly hanged his coat. "Um... why?" he asked, bracing his hands on the wall to toe off his shoes.
“Library?”
Moving quickly, John set off after him. He studied the side of his friend’s profile and his smile fell away. He felt both extremely relieved and oddly dejected after the kiss that never was and the reminder that love didn’t matter to Sherlock except when it helped with solving a case was a much needed one. He needed to remember that whatever it was he was feeling toward his flatmate, it wouldn’t amount to anything, so he should just put a stop to them before they got any stronger.
The boy grabbed a towel and left the room, closing the door with a click behind him. Sherlock sank down onto his heels and swallowed thickly. There was a foreign feeling twisting in his belly and his cheeks felt heated.
"John," Sherlock said, just as John reached the top step outside the open door to their flat.
“Oh yes. This way,” Sherlock said. He started down the hall and John and Sherrinford followed behind. As they were walking, John felt Sherrinford’s hand slip into his and he blushed.
“Mummy?”
“Boy, is it!” The Doctor grinned. “Follow me!”
"There are some things its unable to repair, because I haven’t had the time to install the coding for it to do so.” Sherlock did something inside the androids head and its body began to glow a bright silver. A moment later, the light faded and the android was suddenly the same milky white as Sherlock.
John looked down at Sherlock a moment longer, waiting for… something... Something that made him frown. Sherlock clenched his eyes closed and when he relaxed them, John was at ease again as he reached for a pillow and lifted Sherlock up to rest comfortably on it before he steadied his cock against his entrance.
The android glanced away, looking sheepish. “I wanted to see what John said the
From the doorway, John watched as Sherlock and Sherrinford walked away to an idling black car at the end of his driveway. He closed the door long after they were gone, then leaned against it with a heavy sigh. He was starting to feel like he may be in way over his head.
“I beg to differ,” Sherrinford said with a familiar smirk.
, he thought. “Sherlock,” John said, his voice dropping low in warning, the voice he used when he was preparing for a fight. He hadn't gotten so much use out of it since he and Harry were kids.
Because I’m trying to convince myself I don’t want to spend every moment with him, Sherlock thought instantly, but instead of saying that, he didn’t answer at all.
“Sherlock,” John groaned.
Sherlock was sitting in his usual seat to John’s left, his fingers tapping on the table cloth. He was looking out the window with his lips rested on his knuckles and a far away look in his eyes. Outside, the sky was dark blue and the city lights hid the stars from them. They hadn’t spoken a word since they’d sat down and John had ordered his meal, but he was used to Sherlock's silences.
Sherlock’s eyes met John’s and quickly dropped to his lips. He shifted forward and quickly placed his lips on John’s.
Finding nothing of interest but a nice lamp that was mostly unscathed in the first pile that he would give to Harry to replace her broken one, John moved onto the next [ile, and then the next upon seeing nothing interesting in the second. He was about to write off this trip as a waste of time when the torch's light glinted off shiny metal at the bottom of the third pile. He dropped into a crouch that made his legs throb and reached for the metal.
“Jesus,” John said. “It even looks like your hair.”
“What’s the point? It doesn’t even need a name.”
“Yeah, but for some reason, they rarely turn orange,” he said, shaking the screwdriver and tapping the tip. “I like orange.”
“You’re going to be late to meet John,” the android warned him.
“Here, let me get one for you,” Rose said, then she rushed off somewhere John had yet to see. She came back a moment later toting a strange, squiggly shaped mirror and put it down in front of the detective.
Sherlock glanced up at the sound of the door whooshing closed. John came to a stop just inside the door. His hair was matted down on one side and his pyjamas looked rumpled. He smiled at Sherlock when he noticed him among the android parts and ran his fingers through his hair, attempting to arrange it into some sort of order. “You shouldn’t have let me sleep,” he said, his voice rough with the last dregs of a good night's sleep.
“How long did the Blabbersnog kiss you?” The Doctor asked.
John ran his tongue along his bottom lip and set down the mug on the drying rack. He turned around and leaned against the counter. “Under one condition,” he said, looking Sherlock in the eye. “No one else knows about it.”
“What? How could you possibly know that?”
“John?”
John was nervous. He had just readjusted his tie for the fifth time in five minutes and he constantly had to dab sweat off of his forehead. His leg was bouncing so much under the table that he’d accidentally banged against it, causing his wine to splash a little over the rim of his glass, staining the cream cloth red.
John looked down at the android’s ankle and, sure enough, there was a thin crack from its heel to the peak of its ankle. “I don’t... I don’t know how to repair you or anything, yet,” John admitted.
"I was at work," John said. "You could have texted!"
Sherlock glanced away from John and began toward the refreshments counter. “Love is a very important part of my work,” he explained.
“That’s part of the camouflage interface. The perception filter allows you to see what you want to see and feel what you want to feel.”
kill you!”
With the fumbling feet of a child just shy of a toddler, he approached the tall tables, so high they avoided the top of his curled hair. On tip toes he stood to peer at the coating of grey on the once shiny surfaces. With a tentative touch, clumsy and small, he pressed the pad of his pointer finger against the soft dust. Like his mother’s face powder, it clung gladly to his skin, colouring him not a ghostly white, but a rather ghastly grey. It wiped easily from his fingertip onto his shirt. On the surface remained a light dusting that almost managed to hold the lines and whorls of his fingerprint, evidence that he was here.
“Take a bite thinking it will taste like mac and cheese.”
“We should be off now,” John said. “Mrs. Hudson will start to worry if we’re not back soon.”
John opened the fridge door and sighed heavily into it. "So, what's this one for then? Fashion sense and its connection to intelligence?"
“Good god,” Sherlock said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I can’t wait to get you home to fix your thought filter.”
“Yeah, I know, it’s a lot to absorb,” Rose laughed. “It’s only going to get weirder.”
“Hello, John,” the android said from where he was on the table. He was laying front down on the metal table and the back of his head was open. He turned his head to rest it on his other arm, much to Sherlock's annoyance. “Did you sleep well?”
Sherlock studied John quietly for a moment before speaking. “I do believe I would like to kiss you,” he said.
“Do you want… do you want me to power him on?” Sherlock asked, looking down at John. His pupils were beautifully wide and his cheeks were flushed.
Two years since he’d been there last, two years since the flat had been a home. It told him John had been here once, but never again. He could taste the years in the dust; the days filled his lungs. A hand to steady himself left a print in the ash of what had once been their’s - their bodies, their air, them. Their own personal pompeii.
“If I want to be your boyfriend.”
He tried to keep as quiet as possible as he slipped his fingers out of the fence and inched back against the rough bark of a tree trunk. The flickering sensor stopped at his feet and John tucked them underneath himself as he covered his nose and mouth to stifle his breathing.
“It warms things that need warming,” she explained with a smile.
Sherlock shouted for John to hurry- the bad guy was getting away, the game was afoot. John couldn’t find his coat. It wasn’t on the hook where he always left it and it wasn’t draped over the back of his chair, where he sometimes tossed it when his body was still thrumming with adrenaline.
He didn’t understand how his mother could do such a thing. Mycroft had taught him since he was a child to always think, that the work was most important of all, and yet his mother had allowed her work to waste away in the basement like a dying thing. And for what? A man? Children? Love? Sentiment, Sherlock thought with a sneer.
Mycroft smiled knowingly, amused. “You’re not going to find it, and if you do, you’re not going to want it anymore.”
“You’re uncomfortable,” Sherlock, the human one, said.
John frowned. “That sounds lonely.”
Sherrinford’s hand was warm to the touch and soft curled around his. John couldn’t help resting his fingers on Sherrinford’s wrist, just to make sure there wasn’t a heartbeat there.
Before he knows it, he’s made his excuses to his friends and is crossing the crowded floor, finding his way to the bleachers. His eyes search frantically, noticing Sherlock’s sudden absence from the bench and he spots, just out of the corner of his eye, a whisper of black cloth just disappearing out of sight behind the metal seats.
“22 minutes,” the android said.
“Sherrinford, what are you doing?” John said, hurrying to keep up with Sherrinford’s longer strides.
John frowned, but his curiosity got the best of him and he reached out tentatively to brush his fingers over the android's hair. It felt silky and moved under his touch. John yanked his hand back. “How?” he asked, looking at Sherlock, awestruck.
Sherlock was gasping for breath and John stilled his ministrations, worried that Sherlock might pass out. Seeing Sherlock like this, John no longer felt angry. He reached down and gently turned Sherlock over onto his back so he could look at the beautiful man beneath him.
John chuckled, then he began to shiver, both from the nearness of Sherlock and all his warmth and the cold. There was a shuffle of fabric, then Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, enveloping him into his coat.
When they got to John’s house, it was once again empty.
John’s been looking for signs of Sherlock’s mysterious experiment everywhere, but he hasn’t seen a thing, except that bloody red folder he’s spotted almost every day for the past week. It’s taken all his strength not to sneak a peek under the cover, or even at the cover. He knows one glance at the label neatly written on the front will tell John all he needs to know about it.
John paused when he spotted a button just behind the android’s right ear. He leaned forward and saw a thin, dark blue power sign branding the top. He took a nervous breath before pressing it.
John frowned, noticing just how close they were, how he could smell Sherlock’s freshly washed hair (and maybe a hint of chemicals), then stood to give Sherlock enough space to do the same. Sherlock was able to stand with the support of the wall and John’s sturdy hand on his elbow.
“Time and…”
The fire alarm sounded and John burst into action as the crowd began to make for the door. He didn’t take his eyes off the suspect as he shouldered his way through the swarm.
“Hi,” John replied, eyeing the smiling man and his blond companion curiously beneath slightly furrowed brows.
“So,” John started, turning to the fridge and pulling it open to reach for the Prego. “Have you got a case on?” he asked, then he stared into the fridge as he waited for Sherlock to answer until he realized he wasn’t seeing the jar of spaghetti sauce anywhere, which only brought the frown back to his face.
“Just one more miracle, Sherlock,” he said. “For me.” Christ, what a selfish man he’d become. But he’d been so spoiled, so fortunate to have Sherlock for as long as he had, and he would never be willing to give that up - he had admitted that to himself a long time ago. “Don’t be... dead. Would you do that for me? Just stop it. Stop this.”
He kissed him for all the days they couldn’t be together and all the nights Sherlock kept himself away, and kissed him through the dig of Sherlock’s fingers in his back, the cut of Sherlock’s teeth as he lost the control he’d had to keep them sheathed. He continued to kiss Sherlock down his cheek, down the side of his neck, holding him close as Sherlock’s fingers found their way into his hair and gripped it tight as he went in for the bite. John let out a scream as Sherlock sank his teeth deep into John’s neck and began to drink.
“He’s you, remember? He knows exactly what you like.”
John leaned forward and looked at the androids brow ridge where the crack had been, but it was no longer there. “If it can repair itself, why is it still silver then?”
The truth was that he found himself jealous when he watched John touching Sherrinford, John laughing because of Sherrinford, John simply smiling because of Sherrinford. He wanted John all to himself. It would be different if Sherrinford was like he was meant to be. That way there was no way John liked him any more than he did Sherlock.
With the help of the fire alarm and a bucketful of buttery popcorn dumped over the man’s head, they got their murderer. Sherlock and John leaned against the wall outside the theater as the police apprehended the criminal.
“That I would like to kiss you some more.”
“Why not?” Sherrinford asked, staring at Sherlock with his eye lights brightly glowing.
The bot came to a stop just in front of where John was crouched on the other side of the fence and he watched as the bot’s flickering eyes turned in his direction, scanning the dirt floor. There was the rusted frame of a car in between John and the bot and he watched through the windowless window frame as the bot’s eyes lit up the inside of the car. Its conveyor belt moved it closer to the car and its sensor lights nearly touched John.
“Come on, John,” Rose bumped him with her elbow cordially. “You have to actually eat it. It’s harmless.”
Sherlock growled and turned around with the android. He propped it on the foot of his bed so that it was sitting and pressed in the power button, muttering under his breath, “what else have you ruined?”
“The Doctor?” John asked a bit harshly. He turned away and peeled open Sherlock’s eyelids. His pupils reacted normally. John then laid his hand across Sherlock’s forehead and immediately felt his raised temperature. John turned to look up at the taller man in the blue suit. “Well, doctor, do you know what this is, because I’ve never seen anything like it.”
“Repairing the damage,” he murmured. There was a clicking sound, then the purple wire started to glow. Sherlock looked up at John with a grin. It was an unexpected peek of the Sherrinford inside Sherlock he tried so hard to conceal. “The wire must have been knocked loose when it received a blow to its head.”
“Sherlock!” a voice called.
Sherlock sighed heavily. “What is it, John?” he asked, turning over to face John. The bulge passing underneath the blanket as he did didn’t fail at catching John’s attention and John swallowed hard. It seemed he and Sherrinford weren't the only ones who'd been affected.
John huffed. “No one else, Sherlock.”
Sherlock was quiet for a long moment before John felt the bed dip. Sherlock leaned up on one arm and looked down at John. “I know what this is about,” he said, looking John in the eyes.
John turned on the faucet to rinse the mug. “Then what is it?” he asked, glancing over his shoulder at Sherlock.
He knew he shouldn’t risk his dad finding him still awake, but he was too excited to wait until morning, so he laid the android out on the floor, then shut the blinds and stuffed a towel along the bottom of his bedroom door to prevent the light from peeking out underneath. His knees popped as he crouched once again, dropping down beside his latest find.
There were times when John would ask a question and the android seemed unable to answer. Its eyes would brighten as if it were searching for the information to respond, but it simply wasn’t there to respond with. It happened mostly when John asked about Sherlock’s older brother and it frustrated him to no end.
Sherlock ignored him.
“Had sex with it?” Sherlock asked, glancing over his shoulder at John. “Yes.” He said it as if it was perfectly normal.
“Yes. Kind of like the colour of your friend’s skin over there?”
John had never really understood why people spoke to gravestones before. Standing there now, though, John knew why. He needed to say something. It had been floating just at the surface since he’d felt for Sherlock’s pulse.
A black cat leapt out of the car and over the fence and John nearly cried out as it landed at his feet and scampered past him. The bot’s flickering lights, after determining that there was no imminent danger, turned, and the bot continued to move past him.
“Your birthday?”
"Well, for one thing it's too small," Sherlock said, tugging on a sleeve of the oatmeal jumper with a frown. The short sleeves stopped about an inch above Sherlock's wrists. "And it smells like you."
He started to step backward, guiding them toward their room. It took Sherlock an awkwardly bumpy kiss to catch on, but he advanced forward, seeking John’s lips again, not willing to be left behind.
Sherlock stilled instantly and drew back. “Yes,” he said, his voice rough. “That was certainly enough information.”
The man nodded, not taking his eyes off the magazine. “Fucker yanked it right out, too. Toppled two piles I spent a lot of time organizin’.”
“And…” Sherlock said, watching his face closely. “You don’t know how to deal with it, because they’re both interested in you, too.”
“Your heart rate is increasing,” Sherrinford told him as they walked.
“I know when he gets off at school,” Sherlock said in agitation. The android sat up a little straighter and its eyelids lowered. When the lights of its eyes glowed a little brighter, Sherlock pressed his lips petulantly together and glared back. Sherlock was taken aback when, out of nowhere, the android’s eyebrows pushed together and up and his bottom noticeably peeked out a little further.
“He didn’t sleep at all last night, did he?” John asked quietly.
John laughed. “You should give more things a chance, Sherlock. You might be surprised by how not 100 bad some things are.”
“Rough seas ahead,” Sherlock told him, patting the greying whiskers on his golden muzzle.
The android made a rough humming sound like he had rocks in his chest and turned his face away from Sherlock until Sherlock finally finished and closed his chest panel. Then Sherrinford hopped off the table and strode out of the room, slamming the door with a bang behind him.
“Your lips are getting warmer.”
“You’d probably like it more if you let yourself hold my hand,” John said.
“Two…”
“Vera’s Sweet Treats,” Sherlock murmured, struggling to keep his eyes open. His skin seemed to turn every shade of green in less than a few seconds. “It’s not the best thing on the menu, but it is the only place that has banana pudding within three blocks of here. It’s a bright pink building with purple trim. You can’t miss it.”
“He was. Him and Sherlock also lived together and you- John recorded their adventures.”
“Put him here,” The Doctor said, stooping to lay Sherlock across the metal floor. Once Sherlock was laid out, John removed his coat and tucked it underneath Sherlock’s curly-haired head.
The sound of the boy’s bedroom door closing caught Sherlock’s attention and he spent two seconds debating the morals of the situation before he pulled himself back up to look in the window. He quickly dropped back down upon seeing the boy toweling off, because his cock gave a twitch in his jeans, attempting at an erection that he wasn’t willing to deal with at the moment.
He glared and hurried Redbeard along by his collar before slamming the small door closed again and putting the lock down with a satisfying clack.
The room was silent as Sherrinford and John both lay quietly, waiting for Sherlock to respond, but Sherlock was unmoving on the other side of the bed. John smiled, feeling somewhat disappointed. “He must have gone to sleep,” he said. “Ready to power off?”
“Caring is not an advantage,” Sherlock said, like they were words he’d recited to himself many times before.
“Sherlock,” he growled, peering closer at it, but it only took him a moment to realize that whatever was inside was darker than what had originally been in there. “That was for dinner tonight. I told you ahead of time specifically so you wouldn’t do anything to it.”
Sherlock felt his body jostling as if on waves. In his sleep state, he cracked his eyes to see what, he wasn’t sure. He couldn’t differentiate the night sky from the sea. All he knew was one thing for certain: he saw stars glittering like dust in the air.
“What?” John whirled to look at Sherlock, who was now angled slightly toward them as he sniffed a sticky-looking footprint. He stared in shock at what he saw. “Sherlock!”
“You wouldn’t have come if you didn’t need to,” John told him, his voice wavering. He tilted his head back, baring his neck for Sherlock. “Drink, Sherlock. Please.” He blinked his eyes several times, feeling the sharp prickle of tears forming. He’d thought he had come to grips with it, but if he was honest with himself, he knew that would never happen. He was done for the first time they met. “I need you to drink.”
John frowned, thinking perhaps this man was mad. “A purple creature?”
As they stepped outside, a sleek black car pulled up to the curb. The driver got out and circled around to the back where he opened and held the door wide for them.
Sherlock began dragging the android toward the door and John interceded once again. “What are you talking about? I didn’t do anything to him!”
Sherrinford’s hand slid down from John’s chest and mapped it’s way over his belly until his fingers found the single button on John’s pyjama bottoms. He unbuttoned them and pulled John’s cock out from it’s fabric prison, then Sherrinford wasted no time in pulling down the front of Sherlock’s bottoms, too. He wrapped his fingers around John and Sherlock, his hand slick with lube, and began to stroke them with a firm grip.
“You are very expressive,” the android said. “I enjoy watching you.”
“But why?” John asked, looking over at Sherlock. “Why, of all people, would you want to be around me?”
Sherlock ignored him and went over to his own table. Feeling out of his depth, John sighed and set down his tools. “I’m gonna go,” he said. “It’s getting late.”
“Stop this.”
“I have an experiment that needs my attention,” Sherlock said, wrapping his scarf around his neck while he slipped his shoes on at the same time.
“Call me Sherrinford.”
“Oh, sorry,” Rose apologized. “We’ve got all kinds of different foods in the kitchen, if you two are hungry,” she offered.
“So, you’re cheeks are yellow right now because you’re nervous?”
The android pulled away and its eyes flared brightly in worry.
“You won’t, John,” she said, putting her hand on his arm. “I won’t let you.”
John silenced Sherlock by pressing a kiss to his lips. He worried again that his friend might pass out. It couldn’t be good talking that long on only one breath. He kept his lips sealed to Sherlock’s until the other man relaxed underneath him.
“He’s alright. He’s just been poisoned.”
John chewed his food quietly as Sherlock and Sherlock sat watching him. He took a sip of water and cleared his throat, feeling awkward, and continued eating his spaghetti. He’d been hungrier than he’d thought and had ordered the first thing off the menu with lots of delicious garlic bread. After too long of being watched without a word being spoken, John set down his fork and swiped a napkin at the corners of his lips before dropping the cloth on the table.
Sherlock slumped to the ground and his eyelids slid closed.
Sherrinford smiled and leaned forward. He pressed his metal lips to John’s and they were soft.
Sherlock’s line of thought immediately derailed at the comment. He wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to John’s complimentary outbursts. He glanced over, unable to think of something to say, and saw Sherrinford smile.
They sat in an upper balcony looking down at the stage. It was just the two of them, despite there being two other seats on the balcony, and they sat side by side. Never before had they done something like this. He’d thought Sherlock would be the kind of person to avoid concerts, because it meant there was plenty of opportunity for mistake, but he looked almost serene looking down at the performers.
“Hello!” a rather chipper voice said.
“Do you want me to?”
"Yes, well, you were taking too long to get home," Sherlock said, not even bothering to look away from whatever had caught his interest through the microscope lenses.
Annoyed at being so easily distracted, he looked away from the clock and caught the android just turning away from the clock as well. “Can we go see John?” the android asked, it's glowing lights on Sherlock's face. “He should be getting done with rugby practice in 25 minutes.”
Sherlock was sitting at his work table when he got a text from John three days later.
Except, as John walks beside Sherlock, he goes over the occurrence in his head again and he doesn’t remember Sherlock standing so close. And hadn’t Sherlock’s hands been tucked into his pockets for the whole of the walk? John glances over at Sherlock again and his friend stares blankly ahead. John looks away and worries the inside of his lip. Had Sherlock really been trying to hold his hand?
“My eyes work perfectly fine during fellatio, thanks," John retaliated.
John stopped licking immediately. “I’m not seeing our guy anywhere,” he said, tucking his deliciously salty hand under his thigh. “Maybe he read the reviews.”
John huffed a laugh. “Never.”
"Very," Sherlock grinned. "Coming?"
“Please what, John?” Sherlock asked, though it was clear he knew what John meant. He was just going to make him ask for it.
John felt Sherlock coming undone against him and opened his eyes to see Sherlock’s were closed. He slipped his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and kissed him, remembering when things were simple, when he could kiss Sherlock like this under a beating sun with not a care in the world.
John met Sherrinford’s eyes in surprise, then glanced over at Sherlock as if to ask if it was okay. Sherlock ignored them both, fisting his hands in his pockets. John nodded. “Yeah, sure.”
“Good night,” the android said, as it always did, right before it went still.
From in Sherlock’s bedroom, John could hear Sherlock's phone chime, but he was busy staring at the side of his friend's face to really comprehend it.
“You’re dead,” John said, pulling away from him, all his arousal forgotten. “I watched you die.”
“It’s just like a blow-up doll or a dildo,” Sherlock said.
“You don’t shower after rugby because you usually jog home,” Sherlock said.
“Rose, close your eyes!” The Doctor said, covering her eyes with his long, bony fingers and quickly turning away to head inside the TARDIS.
Sherlock crossed the lot, ignoring the man calling after him. Sunlight filtered in through the trees, blinding him momentarily until he was near the fence. He walked carefully, seeing right away the footsteps ground into the dirt leading from the fence to the rubbish piles, then back and over the fence. Men’s size 9; 160, give or take two, pounds; small in build, perhaps 5’6”.
A fourth text arrived the following day as Sherlock and Sherrinford were pulling thick book after thick book from the large bookcases in the library closest to his home. Sherlock froze at the sound, but he resisted reaching for his mobile; he didn’t want to talk to John, John didn’t want to talk to him; John wanted Sherrinford.
“Sherlock!” he heard his mother shout in warning while Sherlock stared after the android in shock. He tented his fingers and pressed them to his lips. Alright, so he was being cruel, but he had good reason. Well, at least he told himself that. He had experiments to do, information to uncover, and he couldn’t do that if he was spending time with John.
Sherlock chuckled. "The only thing worse than me complaining about being cold is you complaining about it," he said. He pressed the scarf into John's chest and John dutifully accepted it. He wrapped it around his neck and quickly followed Sherlock down the stairs and outside. The cold weather chilled John's face the moment he stepped out the door.
“Hmm?” Sherlock said, fauxing innocence. He slammed the book in his hands closed and pushed it back among the rest.
“But what if I don’t…”
Sherlock turned to him and grinned. It was so bright it took John by surprise and he stumbled a few steps.
Rose and The Doctor nodded and the doctor and his detective stepped out onto the pavement. They were in an alley way just around the corner from 221. Rose and The Doctor watched as John and Sherlock walked away and one of the Doctor’s pointed brows went up.
“Sherlock,” John nodded in acknowledgment, then went to take a sip of his tea.
“What? No. Nope. It’s... why would you think that?”
Sherlock moaned, gripping John’s hips tightly as he came all over their stomachs in hot ropes. John leaned over him, thrusting sharply into him before he followed suit, calling out Sherlock’s name as he came deep inside of him. He rode out his orgasm seeing stars until he couldn’t hold himself up any longer and tumbled onto the bed beside his friend. His lover. His… there had to be a better name for what he was to him.
“I’m kidding. Of course I do. Well, I mean, I’d like to take you out on a date first, but yeah,” John smiled warmly.
Peeved, he took a calming breath and buttoned his jacket, avoiding Sherlock’s obvious gaze as he fiddled about with the wrinkles.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed, but it went unseen as John stared at Sherlock’s hand. It barely grazed John’s coat before it retreated. Sherlock was holding a piece of popcorn between his long, elegant fingers when he pulled his hand back. John’s eyes widened when he realized his mistake and his ears burned. Sherlock flicked the piece of popcorn onto the floor, but he was wearing a small, amused smile by the time John looked up at him; a carefully chosen mask.
other day,” he told him, then handed Sherlock a stack of folded clothes. “No time for a shower.”
“Careful!” he chastened.
When Sherlock was finally naked, John flipped him over so that he was laying on his stomach. He dropped kisses onto Sherlock’s shoulder blades, peppering in a trail of bites down to his arse cheeks.
“I... don’t know. You were, uh... I found you in a junkyard.”
“John-” he grunted as he hoisted Sherlock up. “Watson. This is-”
Tingles burst across his cheek and Sherlock opened his eyes.
Now that, Rose thought as she giggled, peaking through The Doctor’s fingers at the pair snogging against a wall, was a kiss to die for.
“You are going to come back?”
John smiled. Sherrinford was the same, his personality unaltered. John couldn't resist reaching for Sherrinford’s hand. Only hours earlier that hand had been wrapped around both him and Sherlock. The thought made him blush and he gave the hand a squeeze before helping Sherrinford up off the table. “Why didn’t you-” he started, turning to Sherlock, but Sherlock fluttered his hand dismissively in the air.
“Sherlock is not a person,” Sherlock reminded him.
John glanced over at Sherlock and the other man groaned and walked away from the mirror. He stopped and stood in the middle of the room beside the center console and stared up at the high ceiling with a look of frustration and intrigue; he seemed not to know where to look.
John looked at his friend with an amused smile and found him focusing once again on the slide in his microscope. "And?"
“Not watching one,” Sherlock suggested.
“Mr. Caruthers will be coming this way in a minute. When I say go, I want you to charge him.”
“Mind if I ask why he chose it?”
“You’re going to make me say it, aren’t you?”
Deciding to turn his attention to his food, John spun spaghetti noodles around his fork and brought it to his mouth. As he did, a blob of tomato sauce dripped off onto his tie and he groaned, putting his fork down. “Bloody hell!” he grumbled, dipping the napkin into his glass of water and swiping at the stain. It only seemed to make it worse, streaking red across the middle of his light blue tie.
“And you did all of it?”
“I’m The Doctor.”
“I’m alright, John!” Sherlock grumbled and pushed John’s hand away, feeling sparks jolt through his arm where John had touched him. He looked down at his hand and wiggled his fingers to make sure everything was in working order. “Did you see where he went?” Sherlock asked, looking at John in the dark hall.
When Sherlock didn’t do anything besides touch his lips to John’s, John pulled away. “You don’t have to be so stiff. Kiss me, it’s alright.”
Sherlock groaned and rubbed at his eyes. “You read my texts?”
Sherlock got a really pleased expression on his face and left the room in a hurry. “Excellent!” he cried in victory as he went.
Sherlock did the same process on the table, seemingly forgetting completely about his unexplained experiment with the lubricant, then he got to slicing up the chicken in neat strips while John first chopped the green onion, then diced the tomato.
Sherlock looked over at him and chuckled. He reached toward John and John’s breath caught in his throat when he saw the gentle look in his friend’s grey eyes. He swallowed, realizing just how close Sherlock was. He began to panic as Sherlock’s hand neared.
In all the time that he’d been gone, all Sherlock could think about was the light gray-blue eyes, peppered blond hair, and oatmeal jumpers that John was made up of. His kind smiles and easy amazement. John was home, and Sherlock had been homesick without him.
“The what?”
Sherlock stuck his tongue out at the door and crossed his arms. He didn’t want her food, anyways. Food was rubbish. Eating was boring.
Sherlock glanced over at the rubbish littering the ground and bunched his eyebrows together. Even he had no clue what the man’s method of organization was, judging by the randomness of all the items. “Did you see the intruder at all?”
“That could have been anyone.”
John glanced toward the eggs in the pan and his stomach begged for him to eat them. "Yep," John nodded.
“On my lips.”
Sherlock stared at the boy’s body, unable to resist. His calves were carved and his thighs were thick with muscle, and his dark blue boxer-briefs covered a beautifully curved arse. Sherlock imagined placing his hands on the boy's hips and holding him close.
He released Sherrinford’s hand just before they got to the end of the hall and Sherlock stopped in front of a door. He glanced over his shoulder at John with an almost shy smile before he turned the doorknob and entered.
The phone vibrated again and John startled and dropped the cherry flavoured lube he was inspecting back into the drawer. He snatched the phone out and slammed the drawer closed before he made his way down the hall. With any of his other mates, John would make some sort of joke about the contents of Sherlock's bedside drawer, but this was Sherlock he was talking about. He didn't know why exactly, but they didn't exactly have that kind of friendship. Instead, he opened the texts to distract himself from the image imprinted in his memory and read them out loud.
It was awkward at first. There were too many limbs, no one knew where to be, and Sherrinford couldn’t seem to stop going back to John’s mouth. But then John shifted slightly and Sherrinford’s cock aligned behind him again and his own erection lined up with Sherlock’s, and suddenly they fit. Sherrinford’s hands ran back and forth over John’s chest and he kissed him while Sherlock held onto his hips to experimentally thrust himself against John.
“The Howling Halls…?”
“Can you wait here until I call for you?”
“There’s a reason I choose to stay in London, John. Sun, not really my area.”
“We should get going,” Sherlock suddenly said. John made a sound of complaint and pulled away from Sherrinford to watch as his friend slipped his arms rather roughly into the sleeves of his coat.
“Yes, but if you touch its hair now, it will be. It senses your intent, knows what you expect to feel, and so it allows you to feel that.”
John laughed. He rolled onto his side to release the pressure on his erection and faced a sleeping Sherrinford. He reached out and held onto the android’s cold fingers and John felt Sherlock’s fingers curl gently around his elbow. Sherlock’s breathing slowed fairly quickly, warm against the back of John’s neck, and John soon followed him and Sherrinford into unconsciousness with a pleasant thrum of warmth pulsing in his chest.
John opened his mouth, then shook his head instead. “It’s May.”
After they decided on meeting directly after school the following day, Sherlock put his phone back on the table with a smile and spent the rest of the day looking forward to seeing John, so he barely even noticed when it went dark outside. It was drawn to his attention when Sherrinford came in and sat down in his chair to shut himself down.
“Sherlock’s older brother.”
John chuckled. “We’re not the only ones.”
“Ew,” Rose said, turning back to the Doctor with her nose scrunched up in distaste, only to bump it against The Doctor’s. She stared into the Doctor’s wide brown eyes for a beat as a flutter of warmth ignited in her belly, then leaned her head away, blushing.
John stepped back. “What do you mean what did I do? I didn’t do anything!”
“May I hold your hand?” the android asked from John’s other side.
“That text. It was from John again, wasn’t it? Why are you ignoring him?” the android asked. It was looking up from the book in it’s hands, furrowing its mechanical eyebrows pensively, its eyes glowing brightly.
The Doctor stared at Sherlock’s hand for a moment with his bottom lip pursed. “I… really don’t know,” he admitted. “I imagine they’re a bit like a mood ring. I’m sure I’ve probably got some information around here somewhere, probably in the ‘B’ section of the library.”
"I do not know," the bot said.
“One!”
He’d barely had a chance to set down his phone before it was vibrating with a text.
“I’m busy,” Sherlock said, yanking another book from the case and flipping the pages quickly.
Sherlock took off for the stairs in a rush, making sure to grab the bannister as he took the stairs quickly downward; his legs felt a little wobbly beneath him. He burst out onto the front stairs and his eyes darted about in search of their man as John joined him a few moments later.
John’s breath escaped him in a gust and he pushed his fingers back through the chain link fence to track the bot’s movements. He waited a whole three minutes before he finally decided it was safe to go. He slung his dirty black duffel bag over his shoulder and gripped the links of the fence to pull himself up and over. He landed on the other side with a muffled thump and took off at a run toward the nearest pile he wanted to search. He had only 27 minutes to dig until the bot’s next patrol, and 22 before he should head out.
“Are you su-” John started to say as he brought his finger to Sherlock’s entrance, but his words were lost as Sherlock let out a loud moan. He shuddered beneath him on the bed, gripping the sheets so hard his knuckles were white.
“Oh?” John quirked an eyebrow. “What’s your conclusion, then?”
“Oof!” Sherlock’s breath was knocked out of him as he was shoved against a wall while the creature fled, thudding down the stairs with heavy footsteps that only seemed to get louder the further down it went. Through the stars in his eyes, Sherlock could’ve sworn the man’s fingers stretched into tentacle-like hands, but he didn’t have any time to think on it, because he lost consciousness a moment later.
Sherlock’s tummy gave yet another defiant growl and he lowered his book to eye the candy wrapper discarded on the floor, the chocolate licked clean off of the white inside. It had been the only thing left in the hull after several days of quiet repose in the ship previous. He’d been meaning to restock his stores and regretted it now as he thought of the meatloaf his mother had made. It was a favorite of his and he’d been looking forward to it ever since he’d seen her bustle in the ingredients from the shops.
“Excellent timing, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said as he walked passed John to receive the bags from their landlady.
“What are you waiting for? Go get him,” Sherlock said, looking up at John with heavy eyelids.
Sherlock took a few pieces and looked to the screen as Sean Connery’s Bond came onto the screen. John quickly got caught up in the story and, much to his surprise, so did Sherlock and Sherrinford, so when Sherrinford’s fingertips came to rest against John’s thigh, he barely noticed. It wasn’t until the android leaned in and grazed his nose along John’s neck that John finally blinked out of the story.
“Are you okay? Should I stop?”
“Actually-” John started
“You okay?” he asked softly.
John chuckled. “I don’t mind.”
“Yes, I’m alright,” Sherlock said, sounding a little breathless. He cleared his throat. “I’m alright, John. Let me stand.”
John pressed his lips together and thought over everything he’d just learned. “So wait... you remember everything Sherlock’s ever told you?”
John turned to Sherlock and the smile he got in return was a little orange around the edges.
The android’s eyes glowed brighter for a moment and then dimmed. “Did. He did have a tracker on me. It appears Mycroft had it removed, as well as part of my memory. I can’t recall Sherlock’s address, nor phone number. No matter. If Sherlock is looking for me, he will find me.”
John smiled back. “Yeah," he croaked. "Yes.”
"My phone is in my room," Sherlock explained, as if that was an acceptable reason for not asking to go rifling through his things.
Sherlock paused his tinkering inside the androids head and turned back to John. “I’m supposed to apologize, right?”
“Because you like my android,” Sherlock said, and his slow building smile crinkled his eyes, making him look a lot like the boy in the photograph John had seen earlier.
He pulled his arm out from beneath Sherlock and shifted awkwardly between Sherlock and Sherrinford until he was on his back. He glanced over at Sherrinford and saw that his eyes were still closed. “You made him... fully functional?”
“I didn’t doubt that for a second, but I didn’t think you would actually do it. I thought you cared more about me then to fake your own death and not tell me about it,” John snapped. He stood from his bed and went to the armoire where he pulled out a robe. He slid his arms into the soft sleeves then stormed out of the room without another look toward Sherlock. He went to the bathroom and locked the door, then went to the sink to wash the mess from his hands.
The boy cleared his throat and straightened his posture. “You're Sherlock.”
Sherrinford chuckled. “Much more than that.”
“I could use a bite, yeah,” John said. “Got to eat when I can; sometimes he forgets that I need feeding.”
John’s mouth fell open in disbelief. “You’re telling me this guy willingly threw you out with the rubbish?”
“Again,” he urged. He gripped John’s hips the best he could to pull him in deeper. John thrusted in at the same time Sherlock rose up to meet him and the slow pace became too much. He gripped Sherlock’s thighs and started pistoning into him.
“I wouldn’t have pegged Sherlock as the holding hands type,” he said as the two headed off, then he spluttered as. a moment later, he watched John push Sherlock up against the wall and start snogging the detective silly.
Sherlock’s eyes slid open again and he focused his gaze on John. “The banana,” he murmured.
“I mean, because the other version of you two, the ones from the books, people have always wondered.”
“Sometimes he would give me a kiss goodnight.”
“Are they?” John asked, a smile stretching his lips.
There were bottles of lube filled with liquids every flavour and colour of the rainbow. John stared in disbelief at the sheer amount of them before his curiosity got the best of him. He glanced toward the door to make sure Sherlock hadn't gotten impatient and come in search of his phone before he reached out and picked one of the bottles up. A green apple-flavoured one, as the bright green colour suggested.
Sherlock sat up and took the proffered clothes in his sleep-heavy arms. “Aren’t you coming?”
John smiled and leaned up on his toes, reaching for a kiss. Sherlock met him half way and bent down to touch his lips to John’s. Instead of pulling away, John pressed into the kiss, running his hands up Sherlock’s arms to his back and finally resting them under the crook of his jaw, tucking his fingers into the warmth of Sherlock’s hair.
“So,” Sherrinford asked. “Was there anything in particular you wanted us to do?”
John’s cheeks heated even more. “If he wants to, sure.”
“Of course,” Sherlock said, nodding curtly. “So you agree?”
John was fascinated by the android’s previous owner, as well as the android itself. He couldn’t get over how well done the work on the bot was. Its movements were only slightly mechanical, only noticeable if you were watching intently, and it was perfectly capable of holding conversation. John found himself forgetting sometimes that he was talking to something that wasn’t even human.
John eyed the scarf as he zipped up his coat. "I'm alright,” he said with a shake of his head. “You'll complain about your ears being cold all night."
Sherlock studied John’s face, as if he suspected him of lying. “How about my house?” Sherlock said. “I have something you might like to see.”
John went to Sherlock’s room to retrieve his bag, then went outside to find the sleek black car waiting for him in the drive. He tried to conceal the smile on his face and failed. The driver didn’t acknowledge the look on John’s face and it only made him smile wider. The guy was probably well adapted to weird at this point.
“The Doctor found something,” Sherlock said.
With another yawn, John laid back down on the bed facing the android and he studied the bot’s silvery profile. It was really quite beautiful and he'd spent a lot of the day admiring that fact. “Can I touch you?” John asked.
John grinned into the kiss and got lost in it, losing track of where they were until they passed under the shadow of the doorway and found themselves standing in their room, surrounded by red rose petals scattered around their feet.
A small smile came onto Sherlock’s face as he looked at John and it went unnoticed as John looked away to finish off his last bite of food. He swiped his mouth with a cloth napkin then turned to Sherlock. “Ready?”
“I need,” Sherlock said through bared teeth, “for you to get away from me.” He tilted his head sideways, looking absolutely predatory, and glared at John. “Leave,” he growled. “John,” he managed after, his voice soft in desperation. He took a tentative breath, trying to keep control of himself and just barely managing to.
Even in the state it was in, John knew not to underestimate the bot, so he dropped into a crouch and slipped his fingers through the fence’s links to hold himself up.
Upon his brother’s death, Mycroft had paid a visit to the Army Captain to let him know that if John wanted, he could plan his brother’s funeral. John had shaken his head at the man who he’d come home to find standing at the window, peering out onto Baker Street like he belonged. John had shaken his head.
Sherlock blinked a few times, trying to process the words he’d just read. He very much wanted to keep the message to himself, which was strange, considering the android knew everything about him, anyway. Sherrinford was Sherlock, when it all came down to it. Biting the inside of his bottom lip, Sherlock tilted the mobile so Sherrinford could read the message.
“Yes, I can!”
“Don’t. You didn’t know her and you could care less. You’re more of a machine than your android," John said, with a look of disappointment on his face. "Take him and go.”
“Then you probably know she was right.”
John steps quickly away when he can, pulling his hand back with an apology. He glances over at Sherlock, ready to share a laugh, only to see the other man purse his lips and look away. Sherlock tucks his hands into his great coat pockets and that is the end of that.
John nodded and picked up the heavy book. “Thanks again.” He turned his back to Sherlock.
They take a cab to Scotland Yard to fill out some paperwork, then another to get home. It's on the ride back, as John peers out the window at the passing streetlights, blurs of cars, and people, that he feels fingers curl around his hand. He stills and looks down at his thigh where his hand rests and finds familiar violinist fingers holding onto his much smaller hands. He looks up at Sherlock and is met by eyes that are currently light gray. They dance over John’s face, as if searching for something. Calculating.
Sherlock sighed heavily and put down a heavy book with a loud thump that made the remaining tools tremble. “Fine," he said shortly. He turned on his heel and headed for the door and John laughed at his melodramatics as he followed him, Sherrinford following close behind.
“Eating’s boring,” Sherlock said without pausing the clattering, loud transportation of tools from one table to the other.
The army doctor shoved Sherlock down onto the mattress and quickly began tearing off Sherlock’s clothes, starting with his shiny shoes, black socks, then working open his belt to pull off his jeans.
“Possession is nine-tenths of the law,” John said.
John gave the android a kiss goodnight before powering him off.
“Really, John? You think that after all this time I wouldn’t know how to fake my own death?”
“Sherlock told me him and John were on to Vavalovx, because he’d broken into a friend’s restaurant, so we looked into it and it turns out that the last time he was caught, he’d broken into a restaurant, as well, so that gives us at least a general idea of what we’re looking for: food.”
“I told you, Sherlock. I’m not scared of you,” John told him, his heart thumping wildly as Sherlock studied him closely, portraying no more emotion than that. He’s gotten better at it recently, but it’s not enough to deter John. He knows, can tell by the way Sherlock still breathes slowly but surely between them.
John squeezed his eyes closed as a shuddering sob broke from his throat. He brought up his clean hand and pressed his fingers to his eyelids, willing the tears not to fall. One managed to escape down his cheek. “Stop this pain, Sherlock. Stop me missing you. Come back,” John plead. “Please, just come back.”
The sound of his jeans ripping was followed by a sudden loss of weight. John climbed at top speed up the fence and dropped onto the other side of the fence beside the limp robot. He sucked in gulps of air as he lifted the light weight onto his shoulders and took off running into the night.
“That creature didn’t kiss your friend, by any chance, did it?”
John’s house was quiet when they got there. Sherlock and Sherrinford followed him to his bedroom and he felt them watching as he sifted through his clothes to retrieve pyjamas and an outfit for the following day. Normally he slept in nothing or his pants, so it took him awhile to find his blue striped pyjama bottoms.
After eating a bowl of cereal so big his stomach started to hurt, John’s lesson ensued. Sherlock was actually quite a good teacher when he wasn’t huffing in annoyance because John didn’t know something. He hovered behind John’s shoulder, leaning over him sometimes to correct him. The first lesson consisted of explaining which tools were important for what. Sherlock got out an old android that looked like it had been in a car wreck and demonstrated how to use each, then handed John the tools and let him copy his movements.
“Is that… not right?” Sherrinford asked.
The dark made it impossible to get a good look at anything, so when he heard the familiar loud whir of the approaching bot, he searched frantically in the dark to see how close the bot was. It sounded a lot closer than it was and John blamed the bot’s fan. Clearly Thomas Crawley, the old man that owned the junkyard, didn’t take as good care of his bot as he should. More proof of that was given as the bot rolled closer and John saw that the bot’s age-yellowed eye-lights were flickering instead of glowing a steady bright white.
He’d been asking the android questions all day about it’s creator. It answered most of his questions, telling John that Sherlock was 16, had black hair, was (obvious, considering the quality of the android’s pieces) rich, hated school, didn’t really have friends, and was a genius.
“Shh,” Sherlock whispered in his ear, his breath warm in the crisp autumn air. His body curved around John’s back and John blushed upon realizing he fit neatly underneath Sherlock’s chin. Like puzzle pieces, they locked together perfectly.
John turned to look at his flatmate. "What, is that a bad thing?" he asked, sounding slightly offended.
Sherlock paused, likely trying to remember which one Greg was. “It’s nothing like that,” Sherlock finally said, following him into the kitchen.
“Umm… Well, I still need to shower,” John said, blushing.
“What do you mean so so? I was able to trick my brother into believing that it was me, that’s how much it looks like me.”
John knew that he couldn’t risk his father coming home and hearing the android, so he forced himself to push open the closet and hide the robot away inside. As he slid the door closed, he found himself feeling... he wasn’t sure. But he felt the need to draw a blanket off of his bed and tuck it in around the android. After closing the closet once more, he dumped the dirty water out the window, shoved the soiled towel into his laundry hamper, quickly stripped his clothes and hid his torn jeans, then shut off the light and crawled into bed. His exhaustion caught up with him and John was out almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered, just as quickly.
Sherlock slit his nearly colorless grey eyes at John. “It’s mine! I bought the parts, I built it; it bloody looks just like me!”
Sherlock gawked at the sight in shock. The android had never tried to use Sherlock’s own manipulative methods on him before.
“Oh, I oughta kiss you again!” The Doctor exclaimed.
As he suspected, he did not feel a pulse beneath his thumb, no warmth in Sherlock’s skin, and true panic took hold of John. Sherlock was edging ever closer to the monster.
“We work well together,” Sherlock said, dragging John’s attention away from the green numbers. He was watching John with a curious look that John really couldn’t put his finger on. He would say it was like Sherlock was trying to assure him, but John didn’t know why he would feel the sudden need to.
“If you’re not gonna buy anything, I’m gonna hafta ask you to leave,” the old man said, standing a few feet away and peering at Sherlock like he was mad or something.
