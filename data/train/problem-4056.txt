This was the end.
Aziraphale stayed quite for a moment, mulling over everything Sam was saying. "What do you mean by the universe crashing down on itself if you kill him?" He asked, finally.
"You also know people better." Jack said. "You've spent time with them. You know their limits, what they can take. You know what would break them." He finished his sentence mournfully, obviously still guilty about the deaths he caused. A fact that proves to Castiel that his soul had not been completely lost, but his words still did nothing to ease the fear of failure.
“That's rich,” Dean chuckled “coming from a douche bag who wears sunglasses inside. At night!”
"I know that souls have to have someplace to go." Billie answered. "I know that once you destroy everything, Heaven, Hell, every soul you have ever created will be doomed to the Empty for all of eternity, or did you miss that little plot hole?" Chuck gaped, then closed his eyes and shook his head, rubbing his temples in frustration.
“ The Jr. burrito, with a side of rice.” Jack answered.
Cas inched slowly towards Dean, apprehensive about the hunter's intentions. "What is it?"
"What do you think?!" Dean snapped at his brother. He wanted to rip Sam apart right now for even suggestion it. He knew it was a bad idea, but he couldn't find it in himself to even keep his head up, so instead he just curled in further on himself. "No, Sam. She's not helping us. This is what she wants to happen. She got pissed at me for even thinking she would go against God...and...and she took it all out on Cas. I don't even know how he got us out of there when he did. He couldn't even move after she got done with him. I don't know...he saved my ass again, man. I was a goner, and that stupid son of a bitch managed to pull my ass out of the fire again."
Cas nodded and toed off his shoes. He stripped down to his boxers and neatly placed his clothes on the desk before turning off the lamp a crawling into the bed. Dean nuzzled himself against the angel's chest and hugged him like a man-sized teddy bear. Cas wrapped him in his arms and placed another soft kiss on the top of his head. "Dean?" He said softly as the hunter began to drift off to sleep.
"Is it really so bad?" Aziraphale asked. "If you try to find a way to reverse it, well we don't know what kind of damage it could cause."
On the rare occasions the angel was awake while he was present, he mostly just talked with him. He'd come up with some excuse about needing to check his vitals or bring him a book, then he would linger a little longer, telling him the progress of the demons or Sam's hunters, pretending not to listen as Castiel gave his input. He would never admit to the fact that he was keeping up the ruse of being cordial to keep himself grounded. In reality, he was terrified. He had witnessed, first hand, how powerful the angel was. He was able to see the manifestation of sheer mana, surging underneath his human shell. He had watched how effortlessly the seraph had dispatched those creatures, two, even three at a time. To see him so broken after his encounter with the Almighty's sister was more than a little unsettling. Crowley was nowhere near as powerful, there were very few beings that were. How were any of them supposed to fare well against the Almighty himself, if a being, such as Castiel, hardly made it out alive against Amara? Truth be told, (though no one even dare to mention it to Dean) he wasn't even wholly alive. He had been mostly dead when they had brought him to the room. It had almost drained everyone working on him, entirely, just to keep him breathing.
"Stand-up guy you've got there, Dean." Crowley said sarcastically.
"So, what's the plan guys?" Garth said as they reached to bottom of the steps, turning to face to two of them. "Whoa! Dean, you look like hell warmed over! You alright there buddy?"
“Oh, my god. It's worse now.” Sam grumbled under his breath. “Look, Jack and I are gonna finish up in here, then we're gonna head to the store and pick up some food. Can you two please go be gross somewhere else?”
"What?!" Everyone else asked in unison.
That was the moment his whole family had turned against him.
Cas rolled his eyes, causing her to let out another laugh. " So what's the plan?"
"We'll call you in a few days, once we have everything settled." The angel said before ducking into the car.
"Stop." Jack cried, his soft blue eyes already rimmed with red. "You can't…you can't leave me. Sam can figure something out…"
" Nothing." Sam insisted. "Does it have to be tonight? It's been kind of a long day and I'm pretty beat." He half whined.
Sam sniffed again and looked off to the side. "We weren't meant to have that kinda life, Dean. We aren't the type of people who get to enjoy the apple pie life .You know that."
"Thank you." Dean smiled before turning to his brother. " Sammy?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you guys actually need to eat?” Dean asked as Crowley pushed him towards the dressing room.
Crowley sighed and set down his paper and mug with an air of annoyance. ”Of course, you are.” He grumbled before snapping his fingers and turning the tea into coffee. He picked his paper pack up and flared it out, crossing his foot over the other knee, leaned back and continued reading. “Is there anything else I can do to make your stay a little more comfortable.” He said sarcastically. “Shall I polish your crown and walk the royal corgis as well.”
Dean just continued his string of confessions. "I used to be jealous of Sam, ya know. I hated him actually. He got to go off and be his own person while I was stuck being dad's personal
What?
"That depends." The demon smirked resting his chin on the angel’s shoulder, lips barely brushing his ear. "Would you be there to catch me?"
"Alright, man" Sam conceded, half-heartedly. "Whatever you say." The other two men finished changing while Dean turned on the TV and set it to the DVD option. Sam placed his duffle next to Dean's in the closet and made his way to the other bed, spreading out comfortably taking it up almost entirely, only proving his brother's point. Cas placed his own duffle beside the couch and walked over to Dean's bed, sitting of the end and crossing his legs beneath him. Dean fought the urge to tell him to lay out and get cozy (no need to add fuel to the fire) and hit play.
Cas nodded and bent down, reaching his hand out to shake Adam's. “Hello, Adam. Thank you so much for saving our friend. It is an honor to meet you, my name is...”
Cas squared his shoulder, using all of his strength to keep an even tone. "Jack was important. He was needed to keep the world safe. He was supposed to fix everything. He..."
“I'm terribly sorry, Dean.” Aziraphale said softly. “I can't begin to imagine what you're going through, but if you don't mind me asking why would you even want to go back? From what you've told us, it sounds like the only thing waiting for you is certain doom.”
Sam ignored his brother. "Cas?"
The weight of the world seemed to fall off the angel's shoulders the second he heard Dean speak. He straightened up and swallowed, his eyes never leaving the hunters as the hint of a smile pulled at the corners of his mouth. “Hello, Dean.” He nodded.”
'Don't be fucking stupid man.' Dean thought to himself. 'He's crazy about you. He probably just didn't wanna draw any attention.' He stripped out of his clothes and put on his pyjamas. When he finished getting dressed, he made his way to the door, hand freezing on the handle. What if he had pissed Cas off. Jesus, he probably shouldn't have offered the guy food! He knew better than that! Or maybe it was the fact that he made such a big deal about not telling anyone. Cas probably thought he was fucking ashamed of him.
"CAS!"
“Adam!” Anathema scolded, returning to the table with a tray of snacks. “You mustn't be so nosey. It's impolite.”
Lastly, I am sorry for all the angst. I need a build up to the Apex and the little engine of fluff that could, just ain't cutting it. But it will all be worth it I promise!
He piled the toast onto a plate with sausage and eggs, covering it in syrup and handed it to her. “ Figured you could use a little pick me up for your drive back.” He grinned.
"What? That Castiel is completely, desperately and madly in love with your brother?" He said in a nasally, mocking tone. " I hadn't the slightest."
"I meant what I said, Angel." Crowley said quietly "Every moment without you by my side is hell. Your friends..¦"
"Oh, no!" She waved her hand in dismissal. "Of course! You two have been gone for a while and I'm sure you want to get home and rest. We'll have tea sometime and you can tell me all about it! Let me walk you to the door. I've had that spell that Rowena gave me protecting your car for you since you've been gone." She said as the three of them began walking towards the door, Newt following numbly behind, utterly dumbfounded. "I hope you don't mind I've had to keep it on the street. I was worried about someone crashing into it, being invisible and all, but that nifty little spell seems to have done the job." She opened the door and waved her hand, sure enough, revealing a black Bentley parked in front of their house.
“Go away, Sam.” Cas mumbled from the other side of the door.
? What the hell?
He swallowed hard, leaning away from Sam, letting his arms drop to his sides as he tried to put some distance between them. Sam looked a little wounded, looking up at him with wide, confused eyes.
“Heya, Cas,” he croaked, voice scratchy and weak and constricted. If only John Winchester could see him now. Castiel slowly lifted his head from the book he had been reading, taking his time to look Dean over closely.
Did Cas sleep in his bed? Shit, did he have a boyfriend in the future? And no one had thought he needed to

Sam showed them the jar Dean had broken, the inscription Castiel had translated. Rowena said she had seen similar curses before, though each, of course, required a different counter curse to fix it.
“Was Dean supposed to be in town? Is this de-aging, or time travel?” Jody chimed in, bringing them back to the topic at hand.
“Oh, come on,” Dean groaned. “I’m no newbie! I may not have ever gone up against vampires, but I know how to fight. I don’t need a babysitter.” He turned to Cas with wide eyes, holding his hands up in defense as he tried to backpedal. “No offense, buddy, but seriously. I’ll be fine.”

, there were the tears. The floodgate was opened, and he was practically sobbing, salty tears rolling down his cheeks as he clenched and unclenched his fists. He wanted to move forward, wrap her in a hug and never, ever let go. He wanted to run past her and hide in his room, locking everyone out. He wanted her to want him, to hold him and kiss him and tell him everything would be okay.
Mary’s heart broke a little more at the sight; her baby, who had always been so happy and carefree as a little four year old, had grown up so hard, so wrong, so much differently than anything she had ever wanted for him.

me, and it broke your heart to send him back there.”
The next morning, John blinked open gummy eyes, rubbing at his face as he groaned at the headache. Looking around, he found himself in Bobby Singer’s living room, the old drunk passed out on his own sofa next to him.
“Of course,” Castiel said, gently brushing a thumb across Jack’s wet cheek.
He didn’t feel anything different as she apparently searched his energy, or whatever, until eventually she sighed and pulled away. His eyes flew open as she stepped back, and he watched her warily. Hopefully she had good news, but going by that sigh, he doubted it.
burger. Sam reached into his pocket and checked the phone, eyes going wide at the name. Dean watched him warily, then; he knew that face, and it wasn’t anything good.
Even Sam rarely, if ever, tried to understand where Dean was coming from.
. Eventually he shoved away from the table, done with this whole situation. He left the kitchen without a backwards glance, shoulders hiked up around his ears.
“Uh,” he said, frowning, “I really don’t know. Who are you, exactly?”

do you think you’re doing in here?” Well, at least she didn’t sound mad. She reached forward and yanked the lamp from his grip, setting it down on the floor instead. “This place is condemned for a reason; it could come crashing down at any moment.”
“Yeah, of course. I’ll be fine.”

“S’okay,” Dean mumbled into his shoulder, avoiding eye contact. “Wasn’t your fault.” Mary winced at that; he had no idea how much of it actually
He looked her over shrewdly; she wasn’t bleeding anywhere, she wasn’t limping, and she wasn’t favoring anything. She was fine. It was all fine.
Dean glared at her. It wasn’t
Dean looked excited, bouncing on his toes as he waited for Cas to follow him inside. As they entered, Dean smiled at the waitress behind the counter and she smiled sweetly back. Castiel gave her a nod, then gratefully took the offered menus and started looking through options.
Halfway through breakfast, the front door opened and the taller, older version of his brother stepped inside, holding something heavy in a thick, burlap sack.
Sam, Cas, and Dean hopped out of the truck before John could convince himself to move and were already moving toward the porch. “Heya, Bobby!” Dean called, grin wide and joy practically radiating off him as he moved closer. Bobby faltered, blinking down at the men standing in his front yard, glaring at them in confusion even as he resettled the gun at their feet.
Feeling panic quickly start setting in, Dean tried to adopt that military mindset his father had drilled into him at a young age; if you find yourself lost, look for a newspaper, a news station,
“What else?” Sam asked. He glanced behind them, where Jack sat on a stool, scowling at the floor. He was pale and sickly-looking, and Sam just wanted to get this over with so their kid could stop looking so damn miserable.
Was it a little sad that he couldn’t remember the last time someone had hugged him?
The tender touch and heavy, grounding feeling sent Dean crumbling, shaking with silent sobs as he tried to be quiet. Tears were running down his cheeks, snot clogging up his nose, and he bit his cheek as hard as he could to keep his keening from breaking free. God, but how did he have this much water in his body? He was crying like it was a damn Olympic sport today.
Dean hesitated, taking a moment to order his thoughts. Where should he even begin? “Are we together?” he finally blurted out, wincing at how blunt he was being but he desperately needed to know.
Dean knew his eyes had to be practically bugging out of his skull. “A
! And
“Home sweet home,” he said with a smirk. Mary tried to return the smile, but it was strained, and Dean noticed. She grabbed a laptop from one of the bags and booted it up, settling in at the table by the window.
Jody laughed, pushing his head away playfully, before she turned and headed toward the stairs. “It’s not a problem, Dean. You’re family around here.” She gave him one last determined look. “We’ll figure out what’s going on in the morning, okay? Just try and get some rest.” He nodded, biting his lip and pulling the blanket up just a little higher, and she flipped the lights off, plunging him into darkness.
Dean ripped his eyes away from the smoking bowl to blink up at the witch in disbelief, before loudly growling, “
?” John asked, calling bullshit all over this. Why did the boys think they had to continue lying to him? “Yeah, and I’m the Easter Bunny.”
She held up five fingers then motioned for Castiel to step through first. As the most indestructible of the three of them, it had been an unspoken concession that he would lead them. A few moments later, Mary followed, Dean practically tripping on her heels. He looked excited, nervous, and determined; he looked so much like John in that moment that it hurt to look at him.
Stepping further into the room, Dean hesitantly perched himself on the edge of the sofa across from Claire. She was staring at him, not even trying to hide it. “So, uh,” he started, reaching up to rub a hand against the back of his neck, “how do I know you guys?”
, he chided himself.

Dean grinned, looking excited now. “Bobby’s.”
He was a nerdy little guy, dressed more like a lawyer or an accountant than what Dean would have pictured as an angel. His hair looked perpetually windswept, his eyes were
Without thinking it through, Dean rolled out of bed and threw the door open, breathing hard. Castiel stood there, seeming uncertain now that Dean was standing in front of him. He knew he probably looked like shit, with his bedhead and his heaving chest and his red, bloodshot eyes. He knew somehow, though, that Cas wouldn’t judge him for it.

Dean grumbled under his breath, cheeks still tinged red, but nodded. Sam sighed and disappeared out the door, leaving Dean alone with Jody and an oddly clingy angel, who kept creeping closer and closer to his side of the couch.
He had grown up just like her.
A soft rap at his door broke him from his spiraling thoughts and Dean pulled the pillow over his face again, letting out a low, frustrated growl. He could tell whoever was on the other side of the door was hesitating, probably having heard him.
your dad?” Seriously, what the
Castiel pulled forward his favorite memories of his time with Dean. He never would have thought that the man he rescued from Hell would ever become such an important part of his life. He thought about all the times Dean looked at him like
“Uh, sorry. That’s kind of awkward,” Dean said with a reedy chuckle, looking away.
In one of the desk drawers, he found a little jewelry box, full of old rings and leather bracelets. He recognized one of them as Mom’s wedding band and frowned before promptly closing the box and shoving the drawer closed again.
Dean’s brilliant green eyes were bright with interest, taking in all of the details, like a soldier hearing his marching orders. “Anything else I should know?” he asked with an excited, crooked grin.
“I’m glad he has you,” she said quietly. Castiel turned his head slowly until their eyes met, and Mary smiled at him, genuine and sweet.
Cas couldn’t help the soft look that overcame him, bright blue eyes turning into a shimmering pool of emotion, attempting to hold back tears. Dean stared back; he could drown in those eyes and not even put up a fight. “I really love you,” he told Dean adamantly, leaning forward until their foreheads touched. Dean sucked in a sharp breath, shaking his head even though he was smiling like a loon.
Dean turned around, tuning back into the conversation. “The who?”
“Yeah, no. He’s just lost about twenty years. Factory reset to sixteen years old,” Sam explained. “He broke some pottery that held a spell at Bobby’s house, and our friend Jody found him.”
“You really don’t remember anything?” Claire asked, sounding skeptical. “At all?”
“Can we stop somewhere to get some food, before we head back?” Dean asked, voice small, hating how his voice was just a little too shaky. He never would have asked if Dad were driving, but he was starving, and he thought maybe Mom would say yes.
Both girls froze, before they turned toward Jody again, disbelief flashing across their faces. “Dean?” Blonde-girl,
The waitress arrived eventually, asking for orders, and Dean got a bacon cheeseburger, carefully watching his mother’s reaction to see if she had any opinion, but she didn’t say a word. In fact, she turned a small smile his way when she caught him watching her, and he promptly looked away, embarrassed.
Dean glared at his father’s words, stepping forward to throw a heavy arm around Castiel’s shoulders; he didn’t even stumble at the force of the movement. Sam, likewise, glared at John, shaking his head like he was more than disappointed. “Cas is a good guy,” Dean said passionately, shaking Castiel’s shoulders and tugging him closer. “He’s saved our asses more than once.” With a hard, world-wearing look on his face, Dean continued. “And, actually,” he said, like he just wanted to dig the knife a little deeper, “we know quite a few hunters, nowadays. Have a big ol’ ragtag group of friends and contacts and acquaintances all over the country. Hell, we even got some contacts over in the UK. Hunting world got a lot more connected over the years. It’s better that way.”
Even as he thought it, he knew he was being too hard on them; they had been nothing but kind and compassionate since they arrived. He was just in a bad, black mood.
“Time to go, guys,” he told the others, and they nodded. Sam moved first, stepping up to Bobby and wrapping him up in tight hug. Dean followed immediately afterwards, and even Castiel gave him a warm, solemn nod. Then the boys moved on to John, each giving him a short hug as well. He definitely noticed the difference between how they acted towards Bobby, versus how they had acted with him, and it rankled at his sensibilities.
“Okay,” Dean said, taking his time to take his plate into the kitchen. He stepped back into the dining room, head down and unobservant, just to get tackled in a hug by Claire. She wrapped her arms around him and
Castiel, the angel, was sitting in the library, though, and Dean froze, hesitating. He wanted a distraction, right? What could be more of a distraction than a real-life angel?
Sam rolled his shoulders and turned away from John, throwing a short glance Dean’s way before Castiel took over, once more. “It is of no import for you to know. We will be leaving, and you need not worry about the outcome. I should remove these memories, so we do not disrupt the timeline.” He raised two fingers, reaching into John’s personal space and nearly touching his forehead before John reacted, swinging an arm up to swat the man’s hand away from his face.
Dean looked away, face pensive as he thought that over. Mary sounded far more confused. “So, you were all okay working with demons, but the British Men of Letters was just a step too far?” She didn’t mean to sound so snippy, but she was still a little pissed that they were so distrustful of them. She had thrown herself in with the organization, but she always reserved the right to leave them.
“I’ll check the internet, see if I can find any leads here. Why don’t you two go pick up dinner?” Mary knew she was being a coward, sending Dean away like that, but Dean looked excited about heading out instead of researching. Castiel sighed quietly but nodded, grabbing the keys from the table and leading Dean out the door.
that, but it would be nice to be asked, instead of ordered.
“Jody!” the blonde girl cried, shaking her head. “
“Sam! Hey, I’m going to put you on speaker, okay?” She pulled the thing away from her ear and pressed another button, and then there was a man speaking from the device.
happen?”
In a book on the nightstand, he flipped through it disinterestedly until he found another picture, tucked between the pages. It was one of him and Cas, dressed in suits and standing shoulder to shoulder against the Impala, grinning at the camera with the sun shining bright behind them. He stared at himself, noticing the fact that the terror in his eyes was practically non-existent with Castiel beside him. His smile was real and wide and bright; Dean tried to picture what could make him ever feel
“Mary!” Castiel growled, blues eyes practically glowing with fury. The vampire took a hasty step backwards, eyes wide, looking between the three hunters in shock.
Mary’s silence was nearly deafening, and Dean winced, feeling like he had undoubtedly said something wrong. He stared down at his hands for a long moment before sighing, turning away to look out the window, smile long gone. Castiel frowned; so much for easy conversation.
“I’ve missed this house,” Castiel said on a breath, peeking through the back window and smiling fondly up at the house. Dean looked more wistful, and sad, and John just knew in his gut that Bobby wasn’t around in their time. At least, not anymore.
?!” Dean felt light-headed, a panicky feeling sweeping through his body as he sucked in a sharp breath through his teeth. Sam turned to look at him, confusion all over his face, but Castiel placed a heavy hand on his shoulder. The subtle pressure calmed something primal in Dean’s chest, and he relaxed, just a little.
Castiel’s entire demeanor was icy and closed off as he glared in her direction. “As I’ve heard Dean say before, ‘demons I get, people are crazy.’ We do not trust the British Men of Letters, because they invaded our bunker, shot Sam, tortured him, lied to us-
“Jack,” Sam called eventually, waving him closer to the table. Jack reluctantly pulled himself away from Castiel’s side, letting Dean’s hand fall from his shoulder, and stood in front of Sam and Rowena, shoulders set and back straight as he surveyed the tools on the table.
Power flooded through his body, filling in every crevice and crack, healing the broken parts of him and easing the aching pain that had plagued him for weeks now, ever since he had been cursed.
“Shut up, you and Eileen are worse.” Sam flicked Dean in the forehead in retaliation and Dean reared back, still grinning wide like he had won some great argument.
“At least I will not have to worry about angel wards here this time,” Castiel grumbled, and Dean rammed an elbow into his side with a
Castiel eyed Dean silently for a moment before settling down at the head of Dean’s bed, Mary moving on to sprawl across her own. It was a little awkward; Dean kept watching Mary out of the corner of his eye, and Castiel was sitting a little closer to Dean than Dean thought was probably acceptable, but it was quiet, and calm, and he let himself relax into the easy movements of weapon care.
The woman stared at him for a long moment before she reached up, pinching the bridge of her nose, shaking her head. Eventually, she looked up at him again, looking sad, but not surprised. “My name is Jody Mills. I’m the sheriff here in Sioux Falls. Where’s your brother?” She stopped herself short, shaking her head at herself while Dean just stared in confusion. “No, wait. You said you were looking for him. Alright, let’s give him a call and figure out what’s going on.”
The Impala sat in Jody’s driveway, glistening in the sunlight, looking shiny and well-taken care of, and just
“Did you bring gasoline and a lighter?” he asked the room at large, eyes downcast on his self-imposed task. Dean stared at him in shock for a moment as he hefted bodies without a single grunt. Mary left to gather the supplies, and before long the barn was up in flames, burning the monsters along with everything else.
It wasn’t shocking that their mother found them,
. I don’t know what it is!”
is going on?”
Yeah, Dead thought, reaching out to idly trace patterns on Cas’s chest, marveling at the fact that he was allowed to do this now. He played with the buttons on Cas’s white dress shirt, tugged playfully on his tie. Yes, this was definitely worth growing up for. There was no doubt about that.
“We usually just eat at the first greasy spoon we can find in town.” He looked around, as well, and pointed down the road. “Looks like there’s one down there.”
.” When she threw the next ingredient into the bowl, with a little more force than necessary, it began smoking, and Dean eyed it distrustfully. “Have I ever led you astray before?”
Mary returned a few minutes later and ushered them towards their room. Dean grabbed the bed closest to the door, bouncing on the edge for a second before turning a look up at the adults.
John hesitated for a long moment, lowering the gun a few more inches as he squinted at them suspiciously, taking in their features in the dim light. It took him a minute but eventually his face lit up in recognition, moving to point the gun purposefully at the ground.
“Dean?” someone asked. Dean peeked up, coming face to face with the supposed angel Claire said was wearing her dad. The guy sounded slightly worried, his face scrunched up in a funny little frown. Dean blinked up at him owlishly, staring at him in silence.

?” She squeezed Mary a little tighter and started backing away, closer to the exit. “Leave me alone. I ain’t got no beef with hunters. Don’t want no trouble.”
fault. He opened his mouth to point that out, indignant, but Sam arrived then, cutting him off. Sam moved forward eagerly, leaning down to wrap Rowena up in a big, tight hug. She seemed to be enjoying it a little too much, as Sam gave a little jump before rolling his eyes and pulling away.
In one quick movement, Mary leaned forward as far as she could and clamped her teeth down on the vampire’s hand. She dropped Mary with a wounded shriek, backing away towards the door as she cradled her hand to her chest. While the monster was crying over her hand, Castiel stormed forward, swiping her head from her shoulders without much fanfare.
Dean eyed Jody critically before he finally relented; she did look nice enough, for a cop. It couldn’t kill him to stay at her house for a night.
“I try,” the angel eventually said, his hand stilling on Dean’s head as he thought over his next words. “Dean is very important to me. As is Sam. But Dean and I,” he trailed off, looking conflicted. “We went through Hell together. Purgatory, too. We’ve lied to each other, and fought each other, and fought together, too. In the end, I’d like to think that he knows we have each other to fall back on. I
Rowena,” he told Sam seriously, sounding grumpy about the whole situation. Sam just rolled his eyes and took the phone back.
She stared at him like she couldn’t believe he was real, and Dean figured he was probably looking at her the same way. She reached a trembling hand towards him, fingers lightly brushing against his cheek.
Dean blushed (
“Dean,” Cas whispered, voice husky after so many hours of disuse.
After talking himself back into moving, Dean pulled himself away from the bed and started opening drawers at random, rifling through the closet, crawling under the bed to see what he could see.
Jody sighed, relaying the information to Sam and Cas (whoever the hell that was).
Dean didn’t have the time or the brainpower to unpack all of that, so instead he focused on her little wink towards Cas, who was now furiously looking anywhere but near them.

Sam held his hands up in defense, shaking his head and looking just as confused as Dean felt. “I don’t know, man. We did what the spell said. Maybe the-,” he paused, giving John a long look, before continuing in a quieter voice, “the
“Sure, honey. Is a diner okay?” She didn’t wait for an answer, and Dean didn’t give her one. She was already pulling off the highway and looking up and down the main street for a suitable place. She found one after a few minutes and parked, then started rooting around in her glovebox. She found a pack of wet wipes and handed a few into the back seat so everyone could clean the blood and grime from their faces, hands, and clothes in order to look presentable enough for society.
to be an adult?” Mary finally asked, having gotten the gist of the conversation by then. She held one of the shards in her hands, turning it over and over thoughtfully. Sam turned, brows furrowed, unsure himself. “If it says it lasts as long as you want, then does he not
This woman with the blood on her face and blood in her mouth and vindictive look in her eye couldn’t possibly be the same woman who had once shrieked and made a horrified face when she had seen a snake slithering in the grass in the backyard while her little four year old son had giggled at the funny expression.
“Dean,” Sam said softly, looking heartbroken, “it’s not like that.” He looked uncomfortable, like he didn’t exactly believe what he was saying was true.
“Thank you, Rowena. All of you, really. Thank you. I know this wasn’t easy.” He shifted uneasily, but his family was never going to let that go.
Sam was sitting at the war room table, stacks of books and glass jars surrounding him while Rowena took over the head of the table, standing over a burning cauldron, glaring at it.
Something shifted beneath his fingers and Castiel let his hand relax, resting it against Dean’s head. He shifted again, more agitated than before, and Castiel blinked back to reality.
“Ready to go home?” he asked, moving to Castiel’s side and peeking over their shoulders at the book on the table. “All this trouble for one little spell?” he asked, a moue of distaste on his face.
Dean’s ears flared red and glanced over the top of his menu at his mother, who for the most part seemed to be ignoring them. Dean swallowed hard and nodded at Castiel, who went back to absently drumming his fingers slowly against the tabletop and glancing out the window.
Dean shook his head, a little life returning to his eyes now that he could talk shop, instead of feelings. Cas rolled his eyes at how predictable he could be sometimes, how easily manipulated. It had gotten him into trouble more than once. “Didn’t even know vamps were a
,” he sighed, voice heavy with warning. The older Winchester growled lowly to himself but extended his hand, letting Sam nick his finger. The blood rolled down his finger and into the bowl, and the smoking intensified.
There was a long, tense silence from the other end, and then the man sighed. “Dean? Are you okay?”
, he wondered.
Groaning, Dean held one hand against his forehead, using the other to push up against the concrete beneath him. Head pounding and body aching like it never had before, Dean pushed until he was sitting on the ground, trying to catch his breath. He cracked his eyes open and looked around, taking his time to move from sitting to standing.
“Thanks, Rowena. We owe you one.” Sam hung up before tossing the phone into the cupholder.
There was the sound of more moving around on her end of the call, and Dean’s mind was spinning at all of this new information. The Devil? The Darkness? What the
“Hey!” Claire whined, swatting at Jody with a hand towel, pouting up at her. Jody just smiled, grabbing Claire by the shoulder and pressing a kiss to the side of her head. Claire practically melted beneath her touch, smiling smugly.
“You got a kid?”
motel room. Man, if magic wasn’t cyclic and all that jazz.
Standing dumbly across from her as she pulled a sleek piece of technology from her pocket, Dean watched her poke at it until it lit up, lighting her face up from below as she continued tapping at it. She put it up to her ear at one point and waited, smiling awkwardly at him as he scrutinized her every move. She visibly brightened when another voice came through the speaker.
“Thank God,” Mary said, shoving her laptop away and making grabby hands at the food, “I’m starving. And I hate research.” Castiel handed her one of the packages and gave Dean the other, and they settled around the table to eat.
Dean yawned suddenly, so wide he felt his jaw crack, and he smiled sheepishly at Cas. “I’m sorry, you’re not boring, but I really am exhausted.”
“Okay, yeah. We’ll leave the door unlocked for you. Thanks,” he said, sounding a little dejected, but he hung up and turned back around to re-enter the kitchen, almost colliding with Dean. Sam looked shocked, and Dean just glared up at him, suspicious.
The man, Castiel, nodded, as if that were a perfectly normal thing to admit to. “Of course. I am an angel of the Lord.” He paused, head tilting to the side as he seemed to weight his words. “Well, I’ve Fallen, but I still have
“Only because you two have been making heart eyes at each other for
“Come on this way, Dean. I’ll show you around, yeah?” Dean let his eyes linger on the cars for one more moment before sighing and following his brother and the angel further down the dark hallway. It opened up to a stairwell, that opened up to a large war room with a big table, a map of the States on it. He stared, eyes wide as his head turned on a swivel, trying to take in all the details.
John was giving them another funny look, no doubt seeing the odd exchange and filing it away for later review. He found his eyes falling to the side more often than not, though, glancing at Cas out of the corner of his eye. Dean noticed his distraction first and sighed, waving a hand between Cas and their dad.
, he told himself viciously; he knew Dad was probably long dead by now, going by the fact that no one had mentioned him, yet. Besides, it was such a childish thought; wanting Daddy to come fix everything for him. God, but he couldn’t do anything right, could he? What a fucking
There were some guns mounted on the wall above the bed, pictures on the desk and on the bedside table, clothes strewn on the bed and the floor haphazardly. It looked well lived-in. He marveled at the idea that he had his own room, something he had never had before in his entire life.
“Your… child?” he asked, sounding shocked as he turned to look between Dean and Castiel.
Dean rolled his eyes, Sam looked about two seconds from waxing poetic about how much they loved him, but Castiel was the one that stepped forward, wrapping their son up in his arms and tugging his head close to his body. Jack held out for about ten seconds, stubbornly refusing the comfort, before finally sagging against his father, a few frustrated tears leaking out of his eyes.
Jody patted his back lightly, looking more amused than anything else. “Well, if it’s up to you, then maybe you just have to think really hard about it? You want to go back to normal, then just try thinking about that.”
If the world were ending, Castiel knew he could survive it if only Dean were by his side.
The lady looked him up and down for a moment before her whole demeanor changed, softening. “Okay, kiddo. What’s your name? I’ll help you find you family, yeah?” Dean swallowed hard and hesitantly followed her back down the stairs until they were standing in the relative safety of the living room. “Why did you think they would be here, though?
Jody looked smitten with him as she bumped her shoulder with his, a fond set to her features. “Of course, Dean. You’re welcome here whenever you want, but I think you’ll be happier with your brother around. We’ll catch up next time around.” She stood and wrapped him up in a tight hug, pressing a kiss to the crown of his head. It was a little awkward, seeing as he was still seated, but the hug was nice.
, but it does occasionally happen with Claire.” Dean sputtered on a sip of his lemonade, nose burning as some shot up his nose unexpectedly.

Just as he was about the open his mouth to start another conversation, there was a loud banging coming from the front door, and then it slammed open and someone in high heels began descending the stairs. Dean whipped around, expecting a fight, but Castiel just set his book down on the table again and slowly rose, moving to place a steadying hand on Dean’s arm.
As they stared at each other, Sam’s phone pinged. He pulled it free from his pocket and smiled. “Cas says he’s asleep,” he said with a snort, turning his phone toward Rowena and Mary, showing them the picture Cas had sent; Dean was sprawled on the bed, Castiel next to him leaning against the headboard, and Dean had his head laying against Cas’s lap, one of Dean’s arms wrapped tightly around the angel’s waist.
Nothing happened for a moment. They waited in silence, staring at the space in front of them, and then suddenly there was another young man standing in the room. He smiled, happy as he took in the scene around himself.
, tell Claire that she can’t keep asking me to look up medical records for her. She’s gonna get me arrested!” A young woman with long, dark hair was sitting on the couch in bright blue scrubs, leaning her head against the back of the couch, groaning towards the ceiling.
You're one to talk Sam thought to himself. He didn't like the guy's mocking tone on the last sentence at all. " Yeah, and I'm sure Dean told you how well that worked out for us." He snorted. "If you ask me it's only a matter of time before you and your demon buddy screw us over as well."
Dean turned to face Castiel, frustration and panic in his eyes. "You can't do this to me man! You can't leave me now! Not now!"
"Cas..."
"Stop it." Crowley growled. " I'm warning you..."
If it makes you uncomfortable then I suggest you skip the next couple of chapters... possibly another one as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So, what you're saying is, I saved Cas while he was saving me?" Dean winked at the angel in question.
This time Amara left Dean to meet Castiel across the room, shoving him up the wall with her powers, further and further as she approached, until his head hit the ceiling as he screamed out in agony. "And maybe I don't have time for you."
"Alright, so for those of you that don't know, Castiel went on, uh...a special mission yesterday. He was able to take down a good portion of the threats surrounding our fellow hunters, leaving an opening for is to make a more effective strike. The groups that are closest to us are on their way back now. Once they get here and get some much needed rest, we are going to regroup. A few of you are going to split up and join other groups. Jody, I'm putting you on zombies, since...well you know." He smiled meekly over at Jody, who gave him a small, sad smile in return. "Donna I want you on vampires. Alex and Patience are still needed here, along with Rowena. Claire. When Garth gets back, you'll be joining his group."
“No, Sam!” Cas practically shouted, uncovering his face and staring into Sam's soul. They sat in utter silence letting the words hang in the air like daggers over their heads. Cas's face began to fall from anger, slipping back into the broken expression he had been wearing since the moment Dean disappeared. “Just...no.” his voice was quiet and cracked. “It’s hopeless. Like you said. He's probably better off.”
"Is..." Dean swallowed starring down at his friend’s body. "Is he..." He let out a pitiful noise that he would vehemently deny later, as he watched the demon scoop up Cas, who hung limply in his arms as he rushed him down the hall.
"Seriously, mom?!"
Cas's smile widened. "Of course." He replied, dipping his head shyly, before following behind.
Dean's words swirled through his head, distracting him from his focus.
'Yeah and mom would still be alive' Sam thought. God wouldn't have had a reason to kick start the end of creation and Dean wouldn't be lost. He chose not to say any of that out loud. It was counter-productive. “You could've at least told us, man.” Is what he opted for instead. “I know we can't really do anything about it now, but you at least owe us that.”
"See, that's the other thing, man." Dean said. "How many angels are even left? Four? Five? Not counting the fucked-up things Jack made, cuz fuck if they know what they’re doing, what good are they even gonna do? I mean, for all we know, you're the only one who even got their wings back, and I don't know how much of your powers to you got back, but if you want my opinion, you're a thousand times stronger than all of those assholes put together. You've got compassion, man. Them? They're nothing but a bunch of bureaucratic shit bags who can't tell their ass from their elbow without going up the chain of command to ask permission to check."
"I just...I waited." Cas replied
" Have they given you any reason not to?" Garth asked.
Cas's plan was still stupid, none the less. He was on the phone with Rowena the second they landed back at the bunker. Dean wished he could say he was surprised she had managed to steal a bit of Gabriel's grace in their brief....um...moment together, but the witch was nothing, if not crafty as hell. Even still, it was only enough for a one-way trip. What if he had landed somewhere that didn't have witches, or magic, or even angels for that matter!? Then he really would be lost to them forever and Dean was sure that was the last thing they needed. He couldn't lose Cas, not now, not ever again.
Sam let out a groan and rolled his eyes. " Awe, man, Seriously?"
Crowley liked living on Earth well enough, but truth be told he could take it or leave it. More than once he has mentioned leaving it all behind, the two of them flying off into the stars and starting over somewhere new. He couldn't care less about Hell or his fellow demons, even less so about the other angels or Heaven. He enjoyed humans, as they always provided entertainment, but it wasn't their possible loss that he was mourning. Crowley wasn't attached to any of that at all. In over six thousand years, there was only one thing he cared about above it all. “Oh...” Aziraphale felt tears welling up in his eyes as well. “... Crowley....” a million thoughts flooded his mind of things he could say, things he should say, but the words died on his tongue when he saw a flash of light from the corner of his eyes.
"Why not?"
“Sorry, mate, but there's no possible way that you could've 'stopped the apocalypse'.” Crowley mocked.
"I never said you were gay."
He could hear the pounding building back up in his head.
" Thanks, mom." Dean smiled back " You kinda helped it along, so...thanks"
Aziraphale finally turned to face Sam then, his face turning serious as he took a deep breath. "You see, the more time we spent around humanity, the more we learned that nothing was ever really their fault. No human is born entirely evil, nor has there ever been one born that was entirely good. Humans are just born. Entirely human. It is the circumstances in which they find themselves that tip them one way or the other. That's how God made you. Monsters are not born, they are made, but that decision to become one rests entirely on their shoulders. Do you know what makes a monster? Lack of remorse. An angel is not a monster because he wipes out an entire village at God's behest, but they become one when the feel no sorrow for the lives that are lost. A demon who feels sorry for the souls he has damned to hell, simply because he has no other choice cannot be considered a monster either. They are simply doing what they are made to do. A werewolf who decides to live off of animal hearts, rather than take a human life is a different type of creature, most definitely, but a monster he is not. A man who was cursed by a monstrous demon, before he was old enough to defend himself, because of a deal that was made before he was even born, does not a monster make."
"Why not?!" Dean half shouted. Hell! He'd sleep with Cas for words that poetic.
“Agnes wrote another book!” She blurted out.
"Oh." Castiel replied, a smile spreading across his face. "That is excellent news. Thank you." He stood up and stretched out, moving to grab his trench coat off the bed.
Dean shot him the bird, a little too late, before looking back over at Cas. Unlike his brother, the smile on the angel's face was sincere and thoughtful.
"Dean!" Sam shot up out of his chair, racing to his brother's side followed closely by Aziraphale and Crowley. "Dean, what happened?! Are you okay?” Dean pushed his brother away and scanned the room, tossing off his back pack before scrambling across the floor where he saw Cas lying in a seemingly lifeless hump.
"Actually, Maeve and I pretty much have everything covered." she said looking around. "But, if you want, there's a banner over there behind the couch. Sam, if you and Cas could hang that up for me and Dean, if you follow me I have a few hors d'oeuvres that I still need to set out."
*****
Dean held up his hand, urging Castiel to quit speaking. "Okay." Dean said, his face still turned down. "It's…okay. I get it."
He was sick of Dean thinking that he could get away with pushing him around like he was just his lowly servant, so he pushed back. He never intended for Dean to fall into an unknown world. The Earth would be fine without Cas (it would probably be better off, to be honest) but it couldn't survive without Dean Winchester. Cas couldn't survive without Dean.
Your hands still catch the light the right way and
"He'll kill everyone. Everything." He explained. "Me."
"Leave me alone, Dean." He grunted, not looking up from his screen.
"NOW!"
Cas's voice, which sounded gruffer than usual, broke Sam out of his haze, nearly scaring him to death. He whipped around towards the voice to see the angel in a complete state of disarray. His hair looked as though it had been pulled in thirty different directions, his eyes were sunken and glazed. He had ditched the trench coat and suit jacket, leaving his loosened, backwards tie draped over his half-untucked dress shirt with the sleeves, sloppily rolled just past his forearms. As he walked towards Sam, he began pouring amber liquid into the glass in one hand from the half empty bottle in his other. He set the glass in front of Sam and flopped down into the chair across from him, taking a good few swallows from the bottle himself. Sam took a sniff from the glass and had to set it down and turn his head away. “Dude, are you drinking bourbon?” He asked.
"Anyway, Gabe's right." He repeated, sitting in a chair on the opposite side of the table, next to Amara. "You're powerful as shit Amara, but that power is dark. As much as you might have changed you can't help who you are. Heaven is not the place for you."
"Damnit!"
"There is an abandoned hotel not far from here." He said. "I can take us there for the night. We can ward the room and I will bring us back in the morning."
"Werewolves?" Garth chuckled, with a raised brow, when Sam told him his grouping. "A little ironic there, amigo, don't you think."
Sam cleared his throat and put his fork down “ Uh, Dean I think you might still be a little drunk from last night.” He chuckled.
Castiel shook his head. "It's not that simple…"
“Hey, Cas, can we talk?”
"How dare you?!" Chuck boomed striding across the room coming to a stop in front of Amara. "I gave you everything! I sacrificed everything for you! I...."
That your body couldn't keep.
Cas bent down and pulled Sam up by his shoulder to his feet before starting to walk away. "You need some rest Sam. Your body suffered through great trauma and it needs time to recuperate. It's best if we return to the bunker and..."
Mary's voice brought him out of his thoughts. He reluctantly peeled his eyes off Cas and turned to see her standing right neat to him. "I wasn't brooding." he scoffed.
"Oh, Dean's perfectly fine!" He smiled. "Better than ever, I think. We hope he and his family will come for a visit soon."
"I mean, it's not like your asses were just as much on the line as ours…" Dean started before Cas walked over and placed his hand over the hunter’s mouth.
“Are you always this talkative?” Crowley interrupted as he swerved past a pedestrian without so much as flinching. “Or is this some sort of punishment for making you tea instead of coffee this morning?” Dean promptly closed his mouth and stared down at his lap. “It's fine.” Crowley chuckled. “You aren't the first being to make the assumption and you most certainly won't be the last. In fact, most people, upon meeting Aziraphale, assume he's gayer than a tree full of monkeys on nitrous oxide.” He smirked over at Dean who was trying, very hard, not to laugh at that analogy. “Besides, you weren't entirely wrong. We are very dear to each other, though you won't find Aziraphale admitting to it quite so easily, and I truly can't imagine spending my existence with anybody else by my side. It's not entirely your fault that most humans feel the need to assign gender and sexuality to everything. If it makes it easier for you to view us as a homosexual couple then by all means, whatever makes you shut up. And I wouldn't bring it up to him either, if I were you. The poor thing might fall to pieces out of embarrassment.” Dean watched as Crowley's face flicked from fondness, to mild hurt and back within the blink of an eye before he continued. “After all, he's only recently been able to admit out loud that we're friends.”
"Damnit, Sam! We're not some fragile ass princesses you have to protect. I've been at this longer than you. I'm fine! I ain't just gonna sit around here twiddling my thumbs while everyone else is out risking their lives!" A few murmurs and stares are starting to float their way because of Dean's outburst. He was causing a scene, which is the last thing they needed.
"Hello, Castiel." Came a familiar and frightening voice from behind him.
Crowley's face scrunched up in an unreadable expression as he eyed Cas from head to toe and back. "I'd expect as much." He said carefully. His eyes flicked back down to Cas's hands, his wicked smirk returning. Cas briefly wondered if Dean would be so inclined to show affection towards the demon, if he could see the awful, serpentile creature beneath the human mask, as Cas did. " He thinks very highly of you. You know that, right?"
Aziraphale began pulling Crowley back towards the rift, while Crowley just began to laugh at the chaos. Dean rushed to put himself in front of them holding his hands out in front of him. “Can y'all just calm the fuck down for a second and let me explain? I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for these guys okay?”
"I get why Dean has been acting wierd, duh." She said, like it was obvious. Sam sat, staring at her, trying to peice together what puzzle she seemed to have completed. "Oh, my God. Do you really not see it?" Charlie laughed.
I couldn't resist slipping a little DW in there and for that I am deeply sorry! Kinda
Sam considered the idea for a while. His bond with Cas was the only thing that managed to break him out of her spell. He didn't like the idea of the two of them going off and facing her alone, but if she was their only other option..." Maybe. I guess." He sighed.
"Dean, what the hell?! I heard you and Cas shouting again and..."
“Love?” Crowley scoffed. “Love?!” He pretended to be offended, but somehow, Dean could sense the sarcasm in his voice. “Whatever do you mean by love? Do you mean Eros? Hmm? Philla? Storge, ludus, mania, pragma? Love is such a broad word. I'm afraid you're going to have to be more specific.” He reached over and grabbed three more fries.
“I'm just saying, guys.” Dean chuckled. His stomach was now sore from laughter and his face hurt from smiling but honestly, he couldn't care less.” It's not that complicated.”
“Forgive me for wanting to believe that the creator of the universe has more in store for me than simply being a pawn in some sick game, my dear.” Aziraphale responded. “Besides, even if what Dean here says is true who's to say this... 'Chuck' was it?” Dean nodded. “Right. Who's to say this 'Chuck' fellow, is the same as our Almighty? Who is decidedly more feminine, I might add.”
" Fine," Dean huffed. "what made your eyes get all watery and puffy like that then."
"I don't think I am anymore." Cas replied sadly, forgetting who he was talking to.
Sam stared at him in shock, chocking on his drink. He hadn't even gotten to that part of the story yet. " How did you..."
"Yeah, well neither am I." Cas scoffed.
"I'm sorry, Dean."
Marie giggled and slid out of the booth "Thank you guys again. This is going to be amazing. I gotta go. Don't be late, okay?"
"Yeah." Sam said. "They ran into some trouble after they left hell and had to stop for the night." Sam sat down next to the angel, pulling one of the books spread out over the table and flipping it open.
"Well, because now you have a chance." Chuck scoffed. "I mean, not against us, obviously, but a chance against the monsters and that's... frustrating. I worked so hard on this plot. I didn't want to have to be the one to kill you, but you kinda gave me no choice." He chuckled a little and shook his head. "You know, I wasn't even worried when Mar Mar here came and told me about your grand plan to take me out. It was actually kind of amusing."
“Huh...” Dean nodded.
🎶...thing called love, I just can't handle it...🎶
Cas threw whatever was in his hands on the bed with a huff and stormed past them. " I'll be in the library waiting while you say your good-byes."
“ I suppose it was time for one of my mistakes to take a turn for the better.”
"It's part of the reason I brought you back with me." Cas answered, smiling at her fondly (which did NOT make Dean sick!) "You are smart, and loyal, and strong. I trust you more than most anyone I've ever met. These are excellent qualities for a leader. I trust that you will not let the power get to your head and will rule over Hell with fairness, only taking the souls who deserve punishment, as it was meant to be."
Hooo! Okay guys this is a long one. Like, reeeeeeaaallly long compared to the previous chapters, but it is also an important chapter. I'll explain afterwards. I really needed to write this chapter the way I did and if I'm being honest, I actually cut it down a  lot! This was actually the one of the first concepts that came into my mind as I started writing this. I've been super excited to get to this point and I really hope y'all enjoy it.
Cas pinched the bridge of his nose and turned his face away from the hunter, letting out a long wavering sigh. "You win."
“Oh, everywhere is dangerous, Angel.” Crowley rolled his eyes. “Our world is no safer than this one, really.”
"Who am I now?" Cas whispered in his ear, sending shivers down his spine.
"Sorry, Deano." Meg crooned behind him, two angels surrounding her on each side. "Boss's orders."
“Yeah, great kid.” Sam said in a rush grabbing onto Dean's sleeve pulling him out of earshot of everyone else. “Listen Dean we need to talk...”
“Oh, come on, Angel. What's wrong?” Crowley slurred from beside him. “Don't want to believe that there's no such thing as 'The Ineffable Plan'? Is it really so hard to think that The Almighty is just an arrogant wanker, using us for their own amusement?” He laughed and tried again for another sip of wine before Aziraphale stopped him. With a snap of his fingers, one of the bottles on the table magically found itself refilled. “Oh, You're no fun.” He mumbled, crossing his arms and slumping against the back of his chair.
"Cas, I made a promise to be hands off." Jack said from beside him, staring off in the same direction. "Chuck was too involved. That's where he went wrong. That's why everything went the way it did. We can't interfere with there lives anymore."
Dean grimaced and shook his head. “I don't think so. Everything's a little wonky here. It's all so different.”
as always, y'all rock, kudos and comments feed the beast, i am tired and need sleep time now.
"What? That your hot?" Dean asked. "I mean, yeah. Have you seen you?"
"Don't be making excuses for me, boy." John shook his head.
"Crowley isn't at all like he seems." A soft smile spread across Aziraphale's face. "He was an angel once." Cas's head snapped back up with a curious expression. " From what Dean explained, it works very differently here, but in our world, demons are merely fallen angels. Those who followed the Almighty got to stay in Heaven, while those who followed the Adversary were cast down along with him. But Crowley....wrong place, wrong time, wrong angels, I think. He's chaotic for sure, and mischievous to say the very least, but I promise you, he's a far cry from evil."
“I don't get it man.” Sam barked. He was losing his patience with this self-doubt bullshit. “Why can't we at least try?”
"You know the lay out." Dean shrugged. "If we gotta sneak in, we need you to tell us where to go."
"I'm a fucking idiot. That's what." Dean marched back over to Jack and grabbed him by the shoulder, pushing him down the hall. "Come with me kid." He turned his head back towards Mary before they left the room. " I mean it, mom. Don't let Cas walk out that door, whatever it takes." Before Mary could ask any more
"And why not?" Aziraphale demanded, high on endorphins, as he placed the box of souls down on the table.
"Sounds like my kinda party." Meg winked back (and what the actual hell was that!)
on." Mary answered slowly. "What's..."
The angel was absolutely adorable, for starters, what with his confidence in the Lord's will, coupled with his kind nature and flustered speech, how was he not supposed to fall for him. What really sold Crowley though, was when he learned what had happened to the angel's flaming sword. An angel (a well trusted one at that, given that he was meant to guard the very first humans ever created) had gone against his orders and given his weapon away. It was hopeless from that moment on, really. Crowley had no choice but to fall in love with him. It was ridiculously unfair and (what he thought at the time) probably the worst mistake he would ever make. That little act of rebellion on Aziraphale's part would most likely be the demon's downfall.
"It's Zeppelin." Dean said in defense. "Someone's gotta teach the guy about good music."
It wasn't quite the reaction Castiel was expecting. It's not like he could help how he felt. It wasn't his fault. He didn't love him on purpose. He would give anything to change that. He watched as Dean approached him, fist posed to strike, and let it happen. Normally he would weaken himself, let the flesh of his body take the blow to prevent Dean from hurting himself. Not this time. There was a sick, twisted part of him that wanted to see Dean in pain. It wasn't anything like he was currently feeling, but it was something. He barely even felt Dean’s knuckles connect with his nose, but by the look of agony on the hunter's face, Dean most certainly did.
There's some super important notes at the bottom of this for those of you who have been chapter skipping so just a heads up. Read them, or don't, that's up to you, but I really suggest that you do.
The next part was getting everyone's story on what happened and getting things reorganized. About the only thing they could get out of anyone was "massive nest of hybrid vamps." They had to retreat before they were able to wipe the nest out, at the risk of losing more people. Sam spent a good majority of the day on the phone to call in other groups nearby to take care of the issue. It was a bunch of chaos and high-strung people, but Dean was more concerned about the day ahead. It was the day that Cas was gonna be given the okay to leave his room.
"Yeah, got that!" Dean snapped back, stepping closer as well. "It's like you have no fucking self-preservation."
"I am not a Cherub; I am a seraph! Well.... actually, I'm not really sure any more what I am. Now that Heaven is without a leader, it's quite possible that species and rank have no meaning..."
"Um, hello?" Dean waved his hands around the room then pointed to Sam." Big, warded, underground fortress, a kick ass warrior, and an angel..." then he pointed to himself, "out in zombie land, on my way to hell with a snarky witch and a demon. You really think I can survive a trip to Nebraska with nothing but these two to babysit?"
“Shut up!” Dean smiled, smacking Cas on the shoulder before moving to button his suit jacket. He was glad they had it tailored for this. It really showed off Cas's upper body. Especially, when it wasn't covered by that damn trench coat he loved so much. “ This is serious, okay?”
Crowley flipped a page and continued on reading. “ I couldn't very well have you following me around, smelling like a wild animal. I got enough of that in hell, thank you.”
“I... I'm not quite sure what you mean.” Cas stuttered.
Anathema's features twisted into a look of pained guilt as she marched over to the sink and dropped in the plate. “She wrote another book. 'Further Nice and Accurate prophecies'.” She let out a sigh as she gripped the edge of the counter, dropping her head. “Ye Saga Continues.”
"Busy." Crowley snapped, hoping that was enough of an answer.
Dean had to brace himself against the counter to catch his breath. That damn angel was gonna be the death of him.
******
"Billie?" Sam groaned opening his eyes. "What...what happened."
"Alright boys, break it up." Bobby chuckled fondly.
“And whose fault is that, my dear?” Aziraphale lectured as he got in the passenger’s seat after Dean was sat.
"Castiel said he had a copy of the play." Mary replied. "He told Jack and I he would watch it with us, since he enjoyed it so much the first time."
So I failed in my attempt to finish this before the end of the hiatus. I'm a little dissapointed in myself but I don't have any regrets. This pairing means a lot to me so, I refuse to apologise for writing about them as much as I can.
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?
"Was that Dean?" Aziraphale asked Sam when he walked into the library after hanging up his phone.
"I'm right here, Cas." Sam assured. "I'm good. You fixed me up, I'm right here. I'm okay. Dean's gonna be okay. He's always okay. You probably saved his life, too. He's gonna be okay." He kept repeating the same thing over and over, trying to calm down his friend; trying to convince himself. He was alive. Dean was going to be okay. Everything was going to be okay... except....
"Well...?"
"I apologize if my emotions and thoughts are too much for you to handle…" Cas said, quietly. "If being near me is too much of a burden, I can always.…"
"Aziraphale will do everything he can, Dean. " Crowley said slowly.
"You’re my best friend, Aziraphale." Crowley said quietly, looking everywhere but the angel. "You're my only friend really. Ever since the dawn of the earth, it's only ever been you. I've met a few good people over the years, sure, but people die, and I move on. You have always been there. Through…through everything. It's always been you. I can't bear the thought of you being gone. Not when I can do something to stop it. I can't leave here until I know that you're safe. I don't care about losing our world or anyone else losing there's but losing you.... losing you would be losing everything."
"Then we better get to work." Dean said brushing himself and moving while he spoke. "Rowena, come with me to check on the others, make sure no one got hurt. We'll move them to the dungeon, it's probably the safest place. Crowley, you and Aziraphale get started on that cage idea, Sam, call the others and tell them to turn tail. When he comes back, he's coming for us first. It won't do any of them any good to be caught in the line of fire. Come on let's get a move on people."
I think I saw you in my dreams you were
"You don't get to tell me shit about Cas!" Dean snapped. He realized, the second Sam shot him bitchface no.9, that he inadvertently proved his brother's point, but he didn't care. "Whatever! I'm gonna go find something to eat. Why don't you use that all knowing brain of yours and try to figure out another plan that won't get our friend killed." He grumbled while walking away. He heard Sam call after him, but he ignored it. He probably wanted to tell Dean that Amara was their best shot, again. Dean wasn't stupid. He knew Sam was right, but that didn't mean he had to like it. He was halfway to the kitchen when he found himself wishing he had actually listened to what Sam had to say about Cas. It's not like he wasn't used to the two of them keeping secrets, but that didn't mean he liked the idea of Sam knowing something he didn't any more than he liked the idea of sending Cas off to his death. It hurt. He wasn't sure why, but it hurt that the angel would tell Sam something he wouldn't tell Dean. It felt like a betrayal. But that wasn't important now. So, he shook it off.
