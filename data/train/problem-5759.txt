“ I don’t think he would do that.”
“ Wait... Wait... we need to stop.” Steve said as he pushed Tony away.
Peter couldn’t even respond with that way Harry kissed and cradled him against his body.
“ What is there to say? I’m babysitting a bunch of mermaids courtesy of SHIELD.”
“ Nonsense! You are a smart and capable man with goals in life. You have to be the youngest Colonel in the air force right now. You perfectly offset Tony’s impulsiveness and I trust you to take care of him in an even that Maria and I cannot.”
When he was ready to leave, Tony and his family tried to leave but Bucky decided to block their exit.  They ended up having Jarvis ordering them food as Bucky laid himself over Tony’s lap, a smug smile on his face.
“ You are a well known playboy with his sexual history carefully and explicitly documented on the Internet. One more bang is not going to hurt you.” Sam said.
Nothing was jumping out right at them. Tony supposed that was a good thing.
“ You said he.”
“ You know that this is not your Tony right?” Clint chirped from a distance.
Tony face palmed himself as the rest of the Avengers laughed at their expense.
“ Saving your ass. Do you really thing we would let you be by yourself when you are going to fool around with your boyfriend? Just because you make him a homemade Italian dinner it doesn’t mean his best friend isn’t going to kick your ass for banging his friend.” Rescue said
“Sir, the Commander’s heart rate is dangerously high. I don’t think he’s comfortable to answer that question.”
Tony gasped. “ Don’t say such blasphemy.”
Rhodey gave an exasperated sigh. “ Can we just go back to where you bitch about Steve and I pretend to listen?”
Tony giggled. “ I don’t think I can handle another round. Some of us are not twenty.”
He got another nod and Winghead took one of the skewers and handed him one. Tony took a bit of it. He tried not to gag as he tasted it.  Winghead was looking at him intently, as if waiting for a response.
Steve huffed a laugh as he gently laid his weight over tony’s back.
“ You two should ask about spring break in ‘89. Have him relive that. He will be so thrilled.”
Tony just threw his arms around him and began to cry, “ I know you’re not my Honey Bear, but you look like him and I miss him so much. I’m so scared, I don’t know anyone and I want to go home.” Tony sobbed and his words probably were incomprehensible but he needed to say them. Seeing him hurt too much. It reminded him of how much he missed his friends. He wanted to go home. He felt gentle hands begin to run soothing circles on his back.
“ I meant to clean earlier, but I got a little busy... do you mind moving?” He snapped at the brunette man in the couch. He woke up startled and looked up at him with a bleary look on his eye.
Peter made a verifiable attempt to break his restraints.
“ Commander, I think you should go see Schmidt. Didn’t you have a late appointment with him today?”
Steve looked down, ashamed.
Tony laid stock still. Even when steve finally when to sleep. He was definitely living with a lunatic.
Beck didn’t look convince.
Bucky had forcibly strip Tony away as Steve basically had a meltdown.
Peter hummed as he looked up to Beck. “ Hmmm.... Sounds like that villain mastermind is tracking my every move.”
Steve smiled and leaned forward to press a kiss on Tony’s cheek.
“ Holy shit, there are two of them,” Rhodey said breathlessly. They had finally taken the two super soldiers and split them in two cells while the rest of the Avengers were in the control room.
“ Just because I’m gay, doesn’t mean I wear shit like or usually wear shit like this.”
“How bad is this guy?” Tony asked incredulously.
Tony just shook his head. He really didn’t feel uncomfortable.
“ Pizza sounds good.”
And Morgan didn’t have another coherent thought after that.
Peter squinted at him for a moment. “ What was the question? I forgot.”
“ Careful babe,” Peter cooed.
“ Ummm....Rhodey it was his back that got hit...” Steve tried. This was really too much. What grown needed to be fed like this? It was his back. He still has one hand that was perfectly fine! What the hell does he need to be spoon fed?
“ It’ll probably be faulty.”
Tony said a soft thank you.
“ No, we are just going over the plans for the new Quintjet.”
Tony leaned forward sand kissed him again. He wrapped his arms around his neck and pulled him close. Steve lowered his hands and felt up his ass through his jeans.
“ Are they gone?” Tony looked up to see Sam stroll in and plopped himself onto the couch.
“ Why was he singing such a song?”
Tony looked up and smiled at him. Peter smiled back. He never told him of all the bullying at school. He wasn’t exactly popular by any measure. Another thing he like about Wade. He didn’t seem to care about that.
What the hell was that about?
“ Ok Steve, your turn,” Tony panted as he withdrew his fingers.
Grant stood and pointed to Steve, “ Why the fuck would I trust him to take care of Tony when he let his supposed best friend fall off a train!”
“ I would be piss at you for cheating on me, but man is that a nice ass.” That voice...
“ I’m just letting you know that I appreciate a fine thing. I’ve always been interested in the arts baby and you should be in the MET.”
“ If I may sir,  it may be wise to take them. Your slave here suffers from some depression and takes medicine for it. The move and recent changes of households could worsen his condition. His friends are much healthier and may be able to help him acclimate better.”
“ That’s fine. I’m going to do Steve first ok? Grant you can keep touching me if you want.”
“ You have no idea.”
“Excuse me?” Tony hissed. What the hell was this stupid mutts problem. Yes vampires can have that part too.
Bucky chortled with laughter as Steve stared at him shocked.
“ I am qualified to care for you. Even though I can no longer do surgeries I am still a well respected doctor.”
Eventually my time ended and I was sent on leave. Thankfully Bucky had been call back to the Middle East a few days prior so he wasn’t up my ass. I had thought that I had finally gotten rid of him  but he ended up on my fucking sisters porch.
Sam walked in at that moment, “ You both look like shit. What happened to you two last night? Was it because you heard those two morons going at it like rabbits last night? Geez Stark, could you not afford sound proof walls? I will not be able to look at Loki the same way again.”
Steve made a gurgling noise and motioned again to the fish.
“ I know, I know. I have to go. I’ll be back tomorrow.”
Tony nodded.
“ Dad,” they whined.
Winghead looked up at him, seeming a little disappointed at the name and looked back. Bucky was already pulling himself up. He wasn’t growling or hissing and seemed to be a bit wide as he shyly approached them.
“ My-“ Steve then motioned to his groin.
Clint chuckled. “ What you don’t want to be in a cute iron man onsie?”
“ You are a fucking idiot.” Nat drawled.
Tony sat upright as he tried to cough the spaghetti he accidentally inhaled in the wrong airway from shock. He looked over at Rhodey and he gave him his signature let-me-handle-this look.
“ They have been pretty chummy lately.” Clint said as he, Nat and Tony looked at the class conference room from their spot in front of theTV. The two were dressed quite similarly, khakis and plaid shirts. The only difference was that Grant wore red while Steve wore blue.
Thanks for reading! I hope everyone likes the update. I’m looking forward to reading your comments.
The bell sounded.
“I want to see,” Morgan whined as he reached for the phone.
“ Your here!” Tony saw the blonde guy from last night. “ Come on don’t just stand there. Here you can sit next to be and Tash. I’m glad he finally let go of you. From what Tash was saying he was a little bit on the possessive  side. Oh by the way, I’m Clint. I don’t think I told you. But if I’d didn’t now you know.”
Peter smiled and put his phone away. He couldn’t wait.
“ Hey is your name Peter?”
“ That’s quite a drive.”
“ Are you comfortable?” He asked him. The super soldier just nodded and held him.
“ That’s good Nat, but we need one more,” He glared at Bucky.
Howard’s expression was unreadable as he let go of Tony and walked back to the table to grab...
Tony just nodded. Not trusting himself to not same something that would get hi into trouble.
“ You for three minutes, before I fly out of here,” Tony snapped
“ I’m not giving up Tony.”
Tony smiled and gave a small wave. “ Don’t look so sad. I’ll see you later. Nite!” Winghead whines loudly, trying to get his attention. Tony ignored it. It was for the best. He couldn’t expect him to stay overnight and attend 24/7 to his needs. He has a company he needs to help run. And as Fury loves rubbing it in his face: he’s just a consultant.
“ You sounded a little rough in there earlier. I was going to interfere but it seemed like you calmed down when you two started.”
Tony scrunched his eye brows. Who the hell were they talking about.
What the fuck was going on?
He could basically hear Bucky’s eye roll. “ Yeah but that’s doesn’t mean you need to flash the world your Johnson.”
Tony groaned as he got up from the bed. Why was someone knocking at, he looked at the clock on the nightstand, 4 o’clock in the morning? What the hell was their problem.
Quentin glared, “ What you don’t like it?”
“ Steve didn’t tell him how he felt before his death which was six months ago.”Bucky said.
He raped me the first time when I was with him for 7 months. He had just pushed me on the bed and when I began fighting him I hit him into he face. He told me to do that again if I wanted to see my family hanged. So I didn’t hit him.
Before Peter could say anything else the door opened and a man with a goatee walked in with an angry looking Tony Stark and Commander Hydra. He could see the rest of the team looking angrily through the door at him. Great. Just great. The goateed man closed the door behind him.
“ He regrets what he did you know.” Tony looked up from the car engine he was currently working on.
“ By the way, I’m sorry about my dad yesterday. He can get over protective at times.”
Steve grimaced. Tony laughed.
“ Fine,” Steve grounded out. “ Take it up with Phil and give him his medical record. I would like to review. They better be his friends or I won’t be happy.”
“ Excuse me?” She snapped.
Fury nodded. “We have found a Hydra base and there seems to be at least two more creatures who appear to be similar to Winghead. We intend to rescue them and quickly. One of those is a merman who is being currently used as an operative and is responsible for sinking two Chinese  military ships this past week. We would like to prevent further casualties and are therefore are requesting that you leave tonight.”
“ Hey,  Don’t hump me! What‘s the matter with you? I just met you. Come On.”
Wade nipped at his neck and began to grind into Peter. Peter moaned as he clawed at Wades back, pulling at his grey shirt.
Steve shook his head. “ No, that’s fine. I think we will both enjoy it the usually way.”
“ Here, Tony, try some of the chicken. It’s amazing,” Grant said and placed a leg and thigh on his plate.
“ I brought him in-“
“ What? One that could get us spurned or killed? And he smells like shit.”
Steve led Tony to the bed and motioned him to take a seat. Tony sat down slowly as he watched Steve flitted around the room. He placed candles strategically in different corners and lit them to create some ambience that only made sense to him and turned off the light so that the room was illuminated by a soft amber glow. Steve walked over to a dresser and placed his phone on some speaker set And set it to some jazz playlist.
Steve frowned.
Peter rolled his eyes and lightly swatted at him again. “ Now come in tie me up. The hand cuffs are already watched to the bed.”
“ just like Portia wasn’t.”
The door opens and three massage therapists came walking. The first one was a perky blonde woman, “ Hi! My name is Sarah and these two fine gentlemen are Sam and Nick.”
Steve sighed. “Lock him up with That Rhodes servant. Tell
Steve gave a small smile. “ Thanks Buck.”
Steve blushed. He didn’t think he was human either.
“ Yes, whenever I’m bored I call him. It’s like a friends with benefits sort of deal.”
“ Ok, are we done arguing? I’m not used to being the adult here.”
“ Well I’m pretty you can get into any school based on merit alone. I’ve only known you a day and i can already see how much of a genius you are.”
Steve and Grant both looked at Tony, obviously hesitant to say anything in.
Peter looked up and saw Harry surrounded by a group of omegas and betas. He looked up as well. He smiled and gave Peter little wave. Peter gave a little wave back. He really didn’t want to be rude.
Tony also noticed that the Thor is this world had shorter hair and was much more fit than the one he left at home. Tony watched in embarrassment as his father tried to climb Thor to reach the rifle. The man eventually got tired and gave up. But he made sure to drag Tony with him and away from Steve.
Steve scoffed loudly. Tony turned to him and saw his expression.  He also turned to Grant and saw his expression. They were jealous, really?
“ I’m here because Tony and his friends are worried that you may be dangerous.”
“ So I’m basically his first piece of ass in years?”
“ Where the fuck are you?!” Bucky roared through the phone.
Tony shook his head. “ No that’s fine. I’m not apart of the team.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “ I’m not going to bite or poison you unless you piss me off. “
“ What the hell is this?” Clint squawked.
“ Babe?”
“ And who were these idiots because I would like to
“ Dude you smell like a French whore! Easy if the fucking cologne,” Clint whined as he tried to cover his nose.
“ Hmm... I think you peaked my interest.”
“ I can’t workout with a shirt. It bothers me,” Steve tried to explain.
“ A divorce.”
“ But he is also kinda old. He could have health problems. Slave-keeper how is his health.”
“ You idiot why did you take your brother to such a place. “
He blockaded the door as well. This was a nightmare. This was a fucking nightmare. He was actually surrounded by Hydra.
Tony scratched behind his ear. “ I’ll be back tomorrow. I’ll bring you something good to eat.” Winghead nuzzled his neck before allowing him to leave.
Tony continued to ignore him.
Tony was so impressed. He looked up at that clock. It was a new record of one minute and fourteen seconds. That was fourteen seconds longer than last night.
Tony tossed the box behind him and placed his hands on his hips. The area where the box had been was chaffed pretty badly, but the surface was still intact. “ There we go, no more-Omph!” Tony felt himself being pushed back and his body was caged by Steve’s torso while his fin was nestled between his legs.
“ Tony. The Tony in this universe... he was bisexual.”
“ Excuse me?”
Steve rolled his eyes.
She faded out of the screen to show Steve in his Hydra outfit minus the helmet. He looked to be he was dying the quinjet.
“That’s what it’s called. It’s a pussy. What you want me to call it a cunt?”
“ Are you out do your god damn mind! You almost hit Steve!”
“ Yeah our version of your Avengers. It was Tony’s idea...my Tony. I like the name Avengers better. And they were like a subdivision of SHIELD.”
Fury gave him an unamused look. “ And it nice to see that you finally decided to attend a team meeting.”
Steve stares at him in shock before breaking out in a fit of laughter. “ You have got to be joking!”
Steve adjusted the rifle when Tony began to move.
“ What did I say about nicknames?” Steve as he turned to him.
Steve nodded, not trusting his voice.
Tony looked up and saw Sam smile down at him. He clung on to her tighter and curled into her chest. He was scared.
“ You were so perfect, my perfect little bitch.” Steve cooed as he dragged his lips along Tony’s neck.
“ His name-“ the balding man began.
“ Oh...hi Steve. Are you busy?” Tony sounded a bit unsure of himself. That was a bit unusual.
Morgan smirked. “ You’re Damn right.”
Tony look at him in mock offense, a hand over his heart, “ Why your majesty I’m your most loyal subject.”
“ Is it something I did?”
“ Sure, why not. I don’t think you are smart enough to outsmart that.” Loki said.
“ Yeah yeah keep growling punk. That never fucking works on me. I have to report to you that the older Stark decided to throw a vase at Clint after he refused to tell him that you were currently fucking his son.”
A growl was the only response.
Steve grimaced.
“ Would you quit that already? You’re making me nervous.” Bucky snapped.
Them both Tony is currently keeping me company tonight. “ Do you want me to use that wording or that you are currently fucking him?”
Tony looked down at the battered suit with the infinity stones still attached to the armor. The damage was quite extensive. He’ll be here for a while. Steve will get his wish and be able to hang out with him just a while longer.
“ Shit. Come on. Look it’s better if you go back. They have everything for you.”
“ You said that you don’t think it’s right...” Tony let out a chock sob and downed a bit of scotch.
“ Take me home.”
“He looks fine to me.”
“ Shhh...it’s okay,” Steve coaxed as he massaged the oil onto his back. He worked the oil into his shoulders, pressing into whatever little muscle he had left from being starved on a daily basis. Tony closed his eyes tight. He knows how this is going to end. He doesn’t understand why this man was trying the delay the inevitable.
The fingers disappears and Tony felt his breath taken away when Steve quickly pushed in.
“ What do you want me to say?”
“ You know if you keep glaring like that your face is gonna stick like that. That’s what my mom used to always tell me,” Clint commented. Tony turned his glare toward him.
Steve’s eyes narrowed.  “ Tony, the pork is better. Here you go.” Steve places a healthy amount on his plate.
Wade shook his head and looked at him, a somber expression on his face. “ Babe, I will never get mad with you about something like this. I love you and care for you. I want you to know that.”
“ And I guess we have to introduce ourselves as obviously you won’t Howie. “
“ I’m in here.” He called.
Peter shook his head. Harry was really nice and he didn’t want to hurt his feelings and it felt nice to have someone to talk to that treated him like a normal person other than Ned. “ Sorry But i have this family thing this weekend and I can’t miss it.”
Bucky growled and nipped at Tony.
“ What do you mean been a while?” Tony asked.
Steve turned to look at Tony and saw that he had now closed his eyes and was sleeping. Steve sighed. He might as well have lunch now before the monster woke up in an hour:
“ Now that that is settled. You two need to apologize to Bucky. And that includes you Steve.”
Tony shrugged.
Tony gave him a pointed look.
******
Tony smiled. Strange smiled back down at him.
Tony just smiled and chose not to reply.
Steve and Grant were looking in opposite directions, not looking at each other.
“ What’s up with the outfit by the way?”  Wanda asked, Vision standing quietly next to her. He was Steve’s favorite Avenger; he was minding his own donan business and not embarrassing the hell out of him.
“ You are such a brat you know that Shellhead?”
Steve sighed. “ Fine I’ll take Tony down.”
Steve pouted at that. It was obviously not the response he was hoping to elicit.
He was not that fucking old! Jesus freaking Christ he was still in his 30’s! This whole week had been “ Bucky said to do this since you are older...”  or “ Bucky suggested this besucase of your age...”
“ Hey, kiddo. Did you see your brother yet?”
“ It’s nice to see you again Boss.”
“ Well I don’t give a fuck.”
Bruce just shrugged. Tony turned to look at Steve.  “ I need to go back to work. I don’t have time for this shit.” Steve looked at him and just gave him a small shrug as he went back to braiding Bucky’s hair.
Peter whistled as he opened the front entrance of the run down apartment. He really needed to persuade Wade to invest in better housing. He really couldn’t find the appeal of living in a place where the ceiling was caving in. Peter opened the front door, the locking mechanism long since rusted away.
“ None of your business.”
“ Steve?”
He also had to be careful with Harry.  He was getting very close. He really like him, he really did, but he was with Wade. He loved him.
Tony got to the park in about twenty minutes. He pulled the duffel bag from the passengers seat and slung it over his shoulder. He made sure to leave to keys in the car. Maybe someone would steal it and take it elsewhere so that way if the others where to trace the car to him it would lead them away from him for just a bit. He began walking. The Forest was thick and it would be able to provide him with quite a bit of coverage when it came time to fly. But first he wanted to make sure he was far enough into where the chances of running into someone else would be quite minimal.
Tony nodded. Steve and Grant who sat on either side of him nodded as well. Whether it was their own opinion or they just wanted to please Tony and go along with whatever he decided Sam did not know. “ Well that’s fine. We   Can have you three have sessions together. “
Tony hissed and glared at him as his tail swished angrily around him. Tony was a demon. In both the literal and figurative sense, especially when he was denied coffee.  Steve also took note that he had stolen on of Steve’s Army shirts again and had decided to forgo underwear again when his tail lifted the hem a bit to much and revealed  a sliver of his bottom.
Strange shrugged. “ Not up to you. He’s already decided on that. Good luck. And don’t forget Christine invited Pepper over for brunch This Sunday and you are expected to attend. I know how you love to forget these things.” Strange smirked as he suddenly disappeared.
Oh god he was marrying into this crazy ass family and they aren’t going to stop.
Steve let out a roar that started the table. He was standing up to his full height, Jamie in his arms crying from freight.
“ You’re right! I forgot. Thanks for reminding me. I’ll see you later tonight Tony.” With that Steve rushed for the elevator.
Tony didn’t answer.  He didn’t have the chance.
“ I’ll downsize.”
He heard Harry call after him, but didn’t turn around. He was dating Wade. He didn’t  to he around Harry.
“ I was hoping you could wear it.”
Tony asked Nat who was waiting and the entrance to Wingheads area.
The door opened and he saw Bucky walk in with a bag of Olive Garden.
Hi everyone. Here is the next chapter :)
‘Great, ‘ Tony thought.
“ I got an assignment. I’ll be over seas for two weeks at least.”
In the end, both Grant and Steve decided to take off everything but their boxers and sat down in the table with the blankets just wrapped around them.
Be together.
“ Yeah, i adopted them when they were both two. Their parents had died during a civil war and we were called in to settle the skirmish. We found them scavenging through our Quinjet for food.”
Bucky nodded. “ Ya’ should. He seems a little tired. Maybe you can fuck him first, ya know? Maybe that loosen him up a bit.”
“ Why are we here?” Tony asked as he looked at a familiar looking suitcase with very familiar looking Initials. “ If you think that I’m going to have some weird threesome thing with you and Rhodey then you are out of your god damn mind. He is like a brother to me. That’ll be like incest. “
“ Babe you are over-“
Tony sat up. “ Where am I?”
“I think you talked enough already Cap. You made the message very clear. You don’t want to be around a fag like me.”
Steve sighed. “ I know that... it’s just that.... I’m was the leader and I was the strategist and I didn’t....”
The elevator pinged, alerting them of their arrival as the doors opened.
Tony tilted his head.
“ You are very handsome. A handsome
The two had been squabbling ever since they had come back from the mission to debrief with Fury. Everyone glared at them, but they seemed oblivious to the many eyes on them.
“ You really want to do this.”
“ Are you out of your mind? Do you know how much danger you put yourself in?” Howard growled.
“ Don’t call me that here, when it’s just us. I think I would like to hear you say my name.”
“ How articulate.”
The waffles were actually really good too. Tony had to hold back a moan as he savored the taste. Tony guesses Steve made this too. He was actually a really good cook.
“ James you really don’t scare me. And how’s Samantha?”
outlandish reason like you as well.”
“ Yeah. He tends to do that. He is a pretty awkward fellow.”
The bed began to move and the headboard hit violently against the all. Steve bit down on Tony’s shoulder as he came, yielding a Yelp from Tony. Grant just grunted as he jerked himself quickly to completion.
“ Mark? No that’s not right”
Silence then enveloped the two of them. Tony pushed himself up and down on his feet nervously. He peered at Steve from the corner of his eye. The man seemed nervous too. Why was he nervous? Why didn’t he want to show him the lab? Why has he waited so long? Schmidt has told him to take him down here and Steve didn’t want to do it. Why was that?
“ Yeah and he would have too if Steve hadn’t showed up. “
Bucky was shaking his head. “ Man you always had some weird tastes.  If you don’t like him. We could always return him.”
Tony opened his eyes and was momentarily blinded. He blinked a few times and then saw he was sitting on the floor. There was just a blinding white around him. Nothing else.
“ Well I think your little friend is happy to see me.”
“ Well good luck.” The man said as he jumped back out the window.
“ When did you fall in love with him.” Tony interrupted. He had to know. The Commander just looked up at the camera, giving a pregnant pause.
“ Yes, I think we should.”
Tony sighed as he followed the man, resigned to his fate.
“ Tony?” Said a soft voice.
“ This is really good Tony. Thanks for the meal.” Grant smiled at Tony and as he chewed happily on the chicken.
“ what? I want this to work. I want us to work. I have feelings for you.”
Tony whined in pleasure.
Peter pouted.
Steve pumped into him a few more times groaned as he came and felt his knot popped. Tony slumped forward at the same time as well. Steve guesses Tony might have came as well.
Tony was really curious as to what her deal was.
He had a large smile on his face with his large tongue hanging out.
“ Pssst!” Tony jumper at the noise and looked near the window where the noise was coming from. Standing there was the blonde man from earlier. He had his hands up in a placating manner as he approached Tony.  Tony hurriedly backed away.
“ You are going to piss people off and those people are very dangerous and will scare Tony.”
Tony walked back into the lab and saw the two Steve’s glaring at each other. The one from his universe standing over him while the other one was strapped into a chair with Mark V on sentry mode right next to him.
Bucky had Peter in his arms and was gently rocking him.
“ You betrayed me! I thought we were buddies,” Clint whined.  Tony just smiled.
They all groaned and looked away. “ You guys wanted me to do these sessions for a reason. Now. Tell me what the hell happened.”
Steve pushed down his shirt and glared at him. “ So you basically stopped kissing me just because I have a good body?”
Hi everyone! Thanks for your support so far! I wanted to make sure to update one last chapter before the new year tomorrow! Happy New Years Eve and I’m looking forward to easing your comments.
He tried every thing he could think of, every trick in his bag of playboy experiences. This man was either too naive to figure it out or had the best god damn self control in the history of Earth. When he said he wasn’t going to touch
Bucky is smirking at then end.
He nodded at Brock, giving the man the signal that Tony just turned the block. Brock followed quietly behind him. He was thankful that the Hydra agent had agreed to help him out. He was to pretend to mug Tony and Steve of course would be there to rescue him. After a romantic rescue like that, he was pretty sure Tony would be wooed.
The guy never got to finish his sentence as Harry punched him squarely in the face. He collapsed to the floor and held on to his bloody nose.
Bruce groaned. “ I told you before, I don’t have the disposition for it. “
Peter shook his head. “ You can go, I have to get home after school. I’m... babysitting tonight.  Well I better get to class.” Peter said quickly before he dashed off.
Clint tried to reach for one but Steve swatted his hand away, Clint pulled back his hand with an offended squawk.
“ Yeah, but You look a lot bigger than I anticipated. I’m going to need-“
“ Well does it?”
“ Perfect! Why don’t we take a look?”
“ Can you tell us your name? And maybe a little about yourself?” Bruce asked. As he released the button he turned to Thor who was sitting down always. “ Thor press that blue button right there. It will monitor his vitals to show if he’s lying.”
He tossed Tony a bottle of lube, which he caught without trouble.
Tony nodded and smiled, “ Well thanks for inviting me.”
“ Oh...oh fuck...,” Morgan mewled as the tongue lapped greedily at his hole. That is that problem with people. Every fucking guy in the whole world wants you to give him a blow job. They are like ‘just do it, it’s not big deal.’ But then when You wanted someone to eat you out, oh no it’s a fucking problem. They are like ‘ oh is it really sanitary?’
Rhodey turned to him with a snarl, “ And do you have a problem?”
“ It’s because he knows I’m awesome.”
Tony lowered himself on his cock, slowly.
Steve frowned. “ Buck, I wasn’t finished.”
He looked at himself in the mirror one more time before nodding his head, satisfied with his appearance. He began his trek downward to his date
Steve was about to argue when Tony places a hand in his forearm.
Tony sat up slowly and kept his head down.
“ I just want to apologize. I was an ass back there. That was uncalled for.”
“ You fucked me in The ass of the floor of a cabin in front of my father. I think we are past the point of having a romantic night in bed or something like that.”
Groaned.
Peter just let out a moan as he threw his back as Wade thrusted his hips forward.
Tony smiled. “ I’ll leave you my card. If you need a job, I hear SI has a good internship program.”
“ And you want my help because you don’t think your body could handle another travel with the stones.”
“ - jerks decide to get jealous because Bucky decides to show up when they were on their morning run and wanted to spar with me.” He re-adjusted the ice pack on his nose.
Winghead nodded and made a few clicking noises. He hoped that meant he understood.
Tony heard a cap pop and then felt Steve’s cold
Tony looked around and saw that it was indeed. He was in his own room in the compound. He remembered this room. He noticed that he was in his bed. The one with the blue bed sheets and the soft silk sheets. It all felt so real.
“ Well, his idea of grieving is not exactly conventional.” Natasha explained. “ And that statue was his idea and how he wanted to remember Tony, not exactly the most tasteful but I guess to each their own.”
“ As such, we believe that we need to increase our training to meet the demands of our jobs. We will be meeting three times a week until we see some improvement. Are we clear?” Grant snapped.
Nat smiled and kissed a disgruntled Bruce on the cheek.
“ I named him.”
“ Jesús Barnes, loving the hospitality.”  Tiny seethed as he was man handled by said into the elevator of his own Tower. “ By the way, I love the handcuffs and all but when I usually use them, I get a happy ending. And word of advice, tie them to a bed and not behind someone’s back.”
“ Tony...”
“ But... you are my menace.”
“ You know you can tell me anything right? You can talk to me.”
When I busted open the cell door, that’s when I figured out why I was told to cover up. I had seen the asshole burn up a freaking black church on TV when I was in Alabama and I heard about how he treated African Americans. One guy that I went to school with was freaking whipped by him and he put salt on his cuts just for shits and giggles.
Tony nodded.
“ Hi, how are you?”
“ What about Sam?”
“ How did he die?” Tony asked.
“ So does that mean I can start now?”
The knocking had stopped, but Tony knew he was still there. He could feel his presence. Tony stopped in front of the door and took a deep breath. He straightened out his clothes and his hair the best he could. He might as well look presentable, make it seem like he was adapting well and was not suspecting him of anything sinister.
Sam laughed, “ Oh my god! I could do see Tony wanting to do that.”
“ It’ll be the same as last time Stark. I will place an enchantment on us and we will go in. And remember to stay behind me. As much as I can stand you, I don’t need you getting yourself killed.” With that he did a series of hand motions and directed his spell toward Tony. When he seems satisfied he turned and the doors opened. They walked in cautiously.
“ Tony. He is the winter soldier. He could have killed you.” Nat said gently.
Iron Man huffed. “ I wouldn’t mind but your little BFF assassin would like nothing more than to shove his AK-47 up my ass.”
Tony smiled. “ I didn’t want you to feel pressured to do this, but thanks. It was fun.”
“ I’m being serious. I’m tired of this shit especially when  my friends and I are in constant danger. They are trying to help your ungrateful ass and you just keep trying to hurt them.”
Howard slapped them back of his head. “ Shut it asshole.”
“ Do you know who those two men are?”
Tony saw Nat walk up behind him until she was next to him.
“ That’s gross. Stop trying to climb on me and I’ll show you.”
“ You’ll get hurt.” Steve said.
“ I can assure you, it’s no problem. I have some snacks somewhere.”
Howard sighed. “ As you wish Maria”
“ I believe so. He declined everyone else.” Wanda said.
Then there was Steve. Oh the great Steve Rogers. He put his entire heart and soul to making Tony notice him. He tried to invite him on runs and work out sessions, which Tony huffed at. He did not need to exercise. He enticed him with home cooked meals, which Tony couldn’t refuse. They were a religious experience each time he ate them. He was very sweet and smiled at Tony happily every time he saw him. Things were going great.
Shit. He was down. Someone he was disabled and tony was willing to bet it was the Hydra operative’s doing.
“ Yeah kinda.”
When Tony reopened his eyes he was back in his room. Now the only thing he had to do was wait.
“ Why hasn’t he been singing to get Tony then?”
“ Fuck you!” Tony snapped as Steve laughed.
Tony should have know Steve would have tried to make this into a date. The food smelled good, but it was not worth the headache. Steve stride ahead and pulled out one of the chairs, he turned back to Tony looking at him expectantly.. “ Please take a seat.”
Bruce clapped Steve on the shoulder before exiting the room, leaving him with his thoughts.
Pricks. The whole lot of them.
Tony leaned forward again and kissed him. It was pretty tame on Steve’s end. Almost as if he had never...
Bucky started to laugh. “ Man this is priceless!   You are so lovey Dovey right now! I can’t wait to tell Sam!”
Bruce groaned. “ Tony this is couples therapy. I told you before I don’t like people.”
The Squadron really had to come up with a new agenda. The whole world domination thing was getting real old. It was a normal fight, nothing too strenuous.  Tony should have been able to dodge that hammer thing that Viking chick Thor knew was swinging around, but he didn’t.  And that sent he plummeting toward the asphalt.
Tony turned to look at him and gave him a salacious smile. “ Well I guess you aren’t too opposed with the idea, please continue.”
There was thumping from the opposite wall. “ what the fuck guys! Go to sleep.” Sam yelled. Steve groaned. He can’t ever catch a break.
“ It’s What we call ‘ The Self Destructive phase.’”  Clint said happily. “ It involves a lot of drugs, alcohol and high class hookers.”
“ Or maybe you need to tell him it’s not acceptable behavior. He steals things from there because you tell him it’s ok.”
“ If it were a secret you know that I will not discuss it with you.”
“ You were in my lab?! This is Dum-E’s tennis ball. What the hell?”
It took some time and a lot of hissing, but the creature eventually went over to the food that was placed for it. When he was over there, that was when Tony ran to the barrier where Clint and Nat pulled him over. What he didn’t anticipate was how fast the creature was and how it nearly snagged him by the ankle. Tony and the agents hurriedly rushes out of the area as the creature began slamming his body against the barrier.
“ You don’t have high standards there Cap. Come here and let me show you a real kiss.”
“ And what do you mean sexual harassment? You showing up half dressed probably falls into that category too.
Tony gave him a deadpan look. Did these people not recognize him?
“Grant,” Steve growled, “ Hurry up. We don’t have much time.”
The Baby looked up at him with his bright doe-like eyes and smiled.
“ You fucking liar! Don’t ever talk to me again!”
“ Now, you usually have to prep to before you do anal, but I have already done that.” Tony smirked. Grant blushed at that.
“Never said that.” Bucky moaned.
Tony gave Rhodey a questioning look. “ He May or may not have strongly implied that we marry.  He thinks I’m a good match for you.”
Tony sighed angrily. “ I don’t have time for your musings right now Clint. As you can see I’m the primary entertainment for two super soldiers.”
Steve smiled. “ My mom taught me.”
Tony was indeed good at arcade games, much to Steve’s chagrin. He made it be known that he was better than some “ Senile old man.”
“ Nothing,” she said.
Steve thought it was really nice, this gathering, well that was what he thought until Barton opened his mouth.
“ Who let the kid watch that movie? Isn’t it like rated R?”
Harry didn’t comment and just smiled. “ My father is Norman Osborn.”
“ This week,” Wanda interjected.
“ Yes for two people.”
Bucky and Clint both broke down laughing.
“ You’re terrible.”
“Has Grant agreed to let Bucky back?”
Morgan hopped down off of Peter and waited expectantly.
Ch. 3
“ Please Iron Man.... please...” he no longer knew what he was begging for.
Peter kisses his cheek. “ And you know what would sound even better?” Peter asked in a husky voice.
“ It is when you are basically fucking around and throwing your life away,” Bruce snapped.
“ Hey.”
So the suit was in okay condition. It turned out Ultron he been. Trying to fix it. Tony has to admit he was smart, but he was as Clumsy as Dum-E. So he made him do diagnostics. Then Steve was cowering in te corner looking up at him hopefully. It was real distracting. So he got relegated to being Tony’s gopher and running to get him things around the workshop. And Tony swears if he had a tail it would be wagging.
He gave a slow stretch before turning to Steve. “ Cap? As in captain? Huh. That’s cute”
Steve kisses his neck and whispered, “ Now comes the fun part.”
Steve whined as he nudged Tony to the bed.  “ I’m moving, god dam it! You are so impatient.”
Tony panted as he continued to move.
He sighed as he pressed down on the non-existent wrinkles on his clothes and looked at himself once again in the mirror. He was going to be fine.
“ Ok so I’m going...”
Steve grabbed onto Tony and turned him to face him. “ It’s Fine. I didn’t mind.”
“ I just want...”
“I got some boxers. It’ll be more comfy and not as hot.” Harry went to his dresser and pulled out a random blue pair.
“ That and he accidentally opened his comm channel when you two were playing hide the cannoli.” War Machine Added.
“ Do I?”
“ Come on Steve, it’s alright. We have to check for any damage in your teeth” Bruce said soothingly./p>
Nat sighed. “ I’ll speak with Bucky. He’ll remind him to bring you your friends.”
“ Obviously we believe in different religions.”
“ There’s more of them?” Tony asked.
“ You can introduce them to me later. “
Tony didn’t notice it when Steve had inserted a third finger.
The blonde sighed and looked at Tony. “ Are you fine with fingers?”
“ Shut Up Steve.”
“ See What I mean? He’s possessive.”
“ Oh my god dad! It was consensual.”
“ Keep fighting it feel so good once you’re under me.” Quentin said as he grabbed onto Peters crotch. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the drone move to get a better angle of his groping.
“Hey, Stark,” he heard Clint said.
“ No you knucklehead. Sam always brings stuff with him whenever he and Rhodey are on a trip or mission together. He always has this hope that Rhodey is going to put out.”
“ Just That the apple doesn’t fall to far from the tree,” he replied.
“ Me too babe.”
“ Only for you, just put it in me. I’m wet enough.”Tony panted.
“ Har-har, Legolas. “ Tony sneered.
Quentin smirked and grasped Peters chin in his hand. “ Nothing to be ashamed of dear. I would love to make a homemade porno with you.”
“ But he still apologized for his behavior and wants to make it up to you. He says he knows some human customs and wants to have a “date” with you tomorrow. I don’t know what that will entail but I promised him to tell you. My suggestion is that you give me a chance and try and date this creature as he really likes you and refuses to give up. Just explain to him the people in your life and be very straightforward with introductions. And by the way, he’s name is Steve. He wanted me to tell you that. He loves the nickname but he wants you to know his real name. Now I need to go home a make dinner. Christine has a shift at the hospital today.” Dr. Strange stood up and prepared to leave.
“ Norman Osborn. He owns the  research company Oscorp.”
He glared at the red head. “ Watch what you say next. He was no good for her. I love her. I don’t give a shit about her race.”
“ So can Winghead bear children?” Clint asked.
Tony gave him a confused look. Why would Bruce follow Nat and what would it have to do with Bucky?
He was ready to growl at whoever was knocking when he froze in shock.
“ Tony...” Steve said cautiously as he raised his hands slowly. “ It’s alright. No one is going to hurt you.”
He stood up as well and chased after Steve, before the man did anything stupid.
“ Then why did he get hit”
Sam shrugged. “ I think like five years now. Bucky almost ended it like three years back and I should have left this building in a body bag, it would have saved me a ton of stress and headache but your boy saved my ass.”
“ Tony, he’s stealing things you like. The only reason he doesn’t have the cake is because cake and water don’t really mix. He wants to impress you and receive praise. He is possessive of you, Tony. Tell him it’s not okay, and he will stop. “
Peter: I like my tacos.
Oh. That’s right. There was Loki and then they were all just tired and fell into bed together. Fucking Loki. Why did he have to bring his fucking drama with him. He had no idea what Thor saw in him. Yes he was attractive but he came with a shit load of baggage.
Tony bolted up, momentarily losing his balance as he tried to get away.
“ I’m quitting coffee.” He said softly.
“ Hey,” he responded back.
“ Tony you say that about every movie in this series.”
So apparently Not So Jolly  small giant didn’t really want to fight. Well at least not with the Avengers. When they all landed in Central Park, he had glared at them and then demanded Thor to explain himself.
Morgan rolled his eyes. “ Time for school. Be glad it’s me and not our parents. I’ll buy you some time, just hurry up and get showered and dress.” With that Morgan walked out the door.
Harry grabbed some grey sweatpants from another hanger.
Tony heard someone rumbling outside and rushed to the window. He discretely pushed back the curtain and saw what appeared to be the quinjet landing.
“ God... I don’t know you yet but if you keep fucking like that I’ll let you fuck me every night.”
“дворняга это начала.” Bucky said.
Tony continued to watch them bicker among themselves with Steve acting as the occasional mediator. He tried to get Tony to talk, but after a few head nods and shrugs, Steve figured that he just didn’t want to talk.
“ You are mainly here to provide him emotional support. He has issues with depression, anxiety and PTSD. Bucky has been tiring to get him to do therapy but he refused and there is no way in hell he is taking medications even if they were somehow not affected by his fast metabolism. So the only other option was a support, and Bucky he Been trying to pair him up for awhile without Steve knowing. But you don’t have any training in that area, so I don’t know how much it’ll benefit him.” Clint elaborated.
He saw his housing unit for his nano Suit. He smiled as he too it and placed it under his shirt and over his chest. He activated it and allowed it to encompass him. He was missing pieces of armor over the part where the stones had melted through.
“ But what?” Maria growled. Her eyes bore into him as if she were daring him to challenge her.
“ Peter?”
Sorry for the short chapter, but wanted to add something. I’m hoping the next one will be longer.
“ But Honeybear I wanted to have fun. I want more ice cream.”Tony opened his mouth for Rhodey to deposit more ice cream in it.
Steve smiled. “ Well I can keep practicing.” He leaned forward and placed a kiss on Tony’s head.
It’s not like he needed it. He was freaking still under 40, but no Bucky said he needed so Steve just went along with it. What the hell? Was this really the man or werewolf to bring down man kind? And yet he believed he needed adult diapers. Fuck he thought he was going to kill Steve.
“ Possibly so. I hear they do Pay well for those who Can give an adequate blow job.” Pietro sneered.
“ Stark, if i thought I didn’t need your help, I wouldn’t have gone out of my way to ask you. To be quite frank I don’t like you. I can’t even stand to be in the same room as you. And I know you feel similarly. So why the hell would I come to your shitty tower unless I have a legitimate reason.” Fury ranted.
He just ignored Tony and continued to watch the TV screen that he accidentally turned on. Pepper had already left since she had an early meeting tomorrow and left Tony with the stubborn fish.
“ We can’t do this here. I don’t want to do this here. You deserve better.”
“ People hate me and think I’m stupid.”
“ Why do you have to always do that, Beck!” He whined.
Tony tried to fend off Howard but he grabbed his shirt collar and revealed extensive black and blue bite marks.
“ Is it safe to presume that you have a Steve Rogers in your universe?” The Red Skull asked.
“ Do you remember the stories I used to tell you? About the Winter Solider and His friend, Captain America?”Howard has put his fork down and was now looking directly at Tony.
Dinner, Steve explained, was a family affair. It was normal that all the Avengers to eat together with Loki, Pietro and Wanda. Steve explained usually Thor would eat with them, but he had ambassador duties with some ally of Asgard.
“ What the hell? Tony what is that sound in the background? Are you alright? Where are you.”
“ I would never,” Clint said in mock offense.
He will miss this. This intimacy, the love the steve just pours into him. But he loves Bucky more. He can’t deny steve his happiness. The man lost his mate once. And tony was just a consolation prize. If he hadn’t gone down into the ocean it would have been Bucky at his side. So he will take whatever he could before he had to say goodbye forever.
Steve and Grant just nodded and contemplated how they were going to handle Tony well they were until Bucky decided to interrupt their thoughts.
“ One What?”
Steve sighed. “ Pizza really isn’t a food. How about some grilled chicken and vegetables?”
Steve grinned sheepishly and pulled out a travel sized tube of lube from his front pocket. Tony smiled at him.
“ Really? Is that why Pietro has an ice pack over his eye? Because nothing decided he needed some natural eye shadow?”
It seemed he scared them enough that they all leave including his parents as well as Tony’s.
“ I would say the one and only, but that seems that is not the case.”
Now, Tony wasn’t so sure. He wanted to do nothing more than to kick both Grant and Steve out of the tower through the balcony window and see if they can survive the drop. The two had been arguing non-stop since this morning. And it was a stupid argument. It wasn’t even if Bucky can stay at the Tower instead of the upstate facility. No, it was why they had caught each other sleeping outside of Tony’s room.  At this point Steve was accusing Grant of being a creepy stalker while he was accusing Steve of being control freak who wants to monopolize Tony.
Hi thanks for your support so far. Please continue to comment as I enjoy hearing from you guys:).
“ I know. It’s real shitty.”
Steve blushes and stuttered out something. It might have been “ nothing.”
“ Bucky what the hell!” Bucky lowered his rifle and looked at Steve with a nonchalant expression.
“ Ooohhh! Is that a challenge?”
“ Everyone this is Tony. He is going to staying with us for a while.” Steve said as he motioned to Tony sitting down next to him.
“ What that you tortured and killed her entire family because you are a racist? Yeah I think she would found that you were racist sooner or later.”
The man then turned to the rest of the slaves. “ His majesty better pick one of you lot. And if he returns one due to his disappointment you can guarantee you shall be beaten.”
Tony felt himself being flipped until his back hit the soft mattress. He gave a loud moan when steve readjusted and thrusted into him.
“ This will protect us. But only for a short while so we must make haste.”
“ You said that about the other one too.”
Tony undid the time of his robe and let it slip down his shoulders and off of his body. He stalked toward the bed and crawled up the bed to where they were.
‘ I guess I know where we stand,’ Tony thinks before blacking our as the door to the room shut in front of them.
Tony laughed, “ Who told you that lie? Another groupie?”
Bucky came shortly after. Steve made some clicking noises at him and Bucky pulled out and flopped on his side next to Tony.
“ Well I’m his fucking whore aren’t I? Pretty hard to do that if you can’t touch.” Tony interrupted before he went on on some speech about respecting the king.
Clint gave an angry huff.
“ So do you want to explain why we have three mermaids in your penthouse or should I just guess?” Rhodey asked as he looked at the small kiddie pool next to the couch with Steve, Bucky and the baby.
“ Well it’s kinda weird that he says he likes me and then does everything to hunt me down just to ditch me.”
“ Peter...” he whispered before all went black.
“ Well one day he’s all homophobic and the next he’s making you breakfast. I’m just curious.”
Steve huffed and pulled out of Tony. Tony let out an involuntary whine.
“ Do you want me to make you feel good baby?” Harry whispered as he withdrew his lips.
Peter laughed and jumped. “ Squishy.”
“ You know he has rejected every woman that has been presented to him. I was thinking I should try a different approach. His majesty has very high standards in taste.”
“ A fag.”
“ Buck. I need you help.” The annoying voice was closer this time. He sighed and looked up and saw his 6’2” cockblock.
“ I’m not sure yet. I want to go into engineering. But more biomedical. I’m not even sure what school I would like to go to or what school I can get into.”
The surface was soon bubbling. Winghead paid no mind to either him or the change in the water.
“ Yes. The answer is yes. Do whatever you want.” Peter growled.
“ So your dad is like a mermaid whisperer or something?” Bruce whispered to Tony. The rest of the Avengers has wandered down when they heard that Tony’s dad was talking to mermaids. Couldn’t he be any more embarrassing? Like seriously.
“ тебе нужно забрать меня. американец неверен. он любил старого меня. Вы видели, как он сдерживался во время миссий. он поцеловал меня за твоей спиной. он плохой человек.”
Bucky and Steve were standing by his bed looking down sadly, the baby cradled in Steve’s arms. They must have been really remorseful about the incident and wanted to make it up to him as they were both were wearing boxers.
Wade was so good to him. He wanted to take care of him. How did he find someone as kind and understanding as him? He never pressured him and had spoiled him afterward, making him food and cuddling with him. Wade had even sent him texts regularly
Peter: My parents will kill you if they see you again.
“ Bucky, watch your language. This is a formal team meeting.” Steve chastised.
So Steve knew he was kind of an ass when he mourning. He was terrible to the prostitutes he brought over and his friends.   He was a terrible human being during that time. Yes he has a temper but that was no excuse for how he had treated people, especially those who were close to him.
“ Why?” There was no way in hell he was going to lick his privates.
Tony looked away and began to close his robe as best he could with one casted arm. “ Sorry. This was a stupid idea.” His eyes had begun to water as if he were about to cry.
Peter gave an exasperated sigh. This was going to be a work in progress.
“ Huh?”
“ Really then why this job then “
Bucky looked at him sheepishly. “ Well... can you like not judge ok? Just give me a second.” Bucky got up from the couch and walked out the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony sighed. “ What are you going to babysit me now whenever I’m in the bathroom?”
“ Then tell me what was the most recent fruit or vegetable you have eaten.”
“ I-I mean I didn’t do anything with them. Sex stuff.. you know.  I-I-I want you to know that.” Steve stuttered out.
Howard sighed. He knew better than to go against Maria’s wishes.  He wanted to do nothing else but protect Tony but he had to know what dangers he had just expose himself to when he had sent in that tape. The whole world now knew there was another Tony Stark.  He wanted to hold Tony just as Maria was doing and tell him everything will be all right and that they love him so very much. Seeing him with the semi destroyed suit and burns scared him. He could have been killed. Not to mention that asshole Commander could have injured Tony as well.
Tony raised an eyebrow.
fic .is Steve x Tony. But comes back into their lives. Bucky it jealous of Tony Tony thinks Steve is neglecting their relationship since he is Steve’s boyfriend. In the end, Bucky and Tony end up in bed together and Steve is happy. End game Stuckony. Can you please find me at ao3 Littlewildcat and comment on one of my stories if you find anything or need more info or can’t find anything.
Tony held back a sigh. They hadn’t been kidding when they said Steve had a crush. He looked like a nervous school boy telling his crush for the first time they they were interested in them.
“ Prepare What?”
Peter whimpered and pushed his chest forward, not sure what to do, but following his pleasure. He get Wades hand over his jeans, groping him. It was a soft movement.
“ Asshole!” Tony Cringed as he heard what was Bucky’s voice.
Steve sighed.
“ I’m setting a new trend.”
“ Well I want to know if my idea was actually a
Steve lowered himself down and balanced his weight over his forearms.
“ So... we are going to film this?”
Tony nodded. He can at least agree with that.
“ I’ll take this one.”
Tony huffed in response.
“ No. I’m alright.”
“ Fuck!” Tony cried and and jumped away. The brunette had suddenly sneaked up on him and bitten him in the leg. It was gushing blood profusely. Tony raised his hand and felt it being enveloped by a gauntlet. Tony felt himself being thrown backward with a sharp hit to the chest over his arc reactor.
“ I thought you two were done with this fighting. What happened?” Nat asked as they waited outside medical.
“ Yes sir,” The Hydra agent replied.
Tony barked out a laugh.
“ Hey Tony,” Steve said softly.
Ok tampons, ibuprofen, Hersey’s Kisses and Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.
“ Jesus Christ, what were you thinking? Did you think he was going to react well to what you had said?”
Hi! Thanks for reading my story so far.  I am really happy that I received so much positive feedback for my story. Please leave your comments:) Merry Christmas. :)
Steve gave him a confused look as Tony turned to Ultron. “ Alright Megatron bring out my suit, Daddy has some work to do.”
Tony Just hummed as Steve continued to kiss his exposed skin.   That Bucky was a ducking asshole. He was not that old.
“ Oh-oh god Tony!”
“ Really? So-“
Steve giggles and allowed Iron Man to push him back onto his back. He leaned his forehead against Steve’s.
“ But still... Where is he anyway?”
“ But I want to see it now.”
Harry was playing with the hem of his bottoms. Peter nodded and lifted his hips so that Harry could take them off. He gently tugged them of his legs and settled himself into the V of his leg. He began to run his hands up and down Peters sides.
“ Remember to be back in time for dinner,” Steve called out before they entered the elevator.
They both smiled at Tony and replied “ We know.”
Ah. Claire. The other Black Widow. What person would call themselves Claire Voyant? There was no creativity there.
“ Fuck...fuck... fuck! S- so good Steve. Keep it going.” Tony cursed between kisses with Grant. Steve leaned forward and began to kiss his neck. Tony broke his kiss with Grant and turned his head to kiss Steve. It was all teeth and Tongue and Steve accidentally  bit Tony, but it was like a masterpiece to him.
“ My little bambino,” Maria said happily and Ultron kneeled beside her.
“ I-I’m sorry your majesty. Th-this is just protocol.”
Schisms nodded and looked at her as if he expected something else.
Peter gave him a long look. He was hope he wasn’t getting paranoid over what Morgan had said, but he thinks that he was right about this whole Harry situation.
“ Now what about your family?”
The blonde man smiled at him and draped an arm over his shoulders. He pulled him close and lowered his head to kiss Tony at the edge of his mouth.
“ Do you like it?”
“ I’ll be there in 10,” with the Steve sprinted to what Tony assumed was his room.
His parents didn’t exactly approve of Wade. Hell the Avengers didn’t approve of him.
“ Umm... can you take your shirt off and lay on your stomach?”
“ I have no complaints,” he gave a dismissive wave, probably wishing the man to leave.
The brunette gave the blonde a shit eating grin. “ I knew you would see it my way eventually.”
It had been a week since he had left the Tower and he was further up north. It was relatively peaceful and he didn’t pay any mind to the isolation to the place. It was small, probably under nine hundred square feet and the living room was basically his bedroom. The closest store was about two hours away and he was quite honestly fine with That. It allowed him to work discreetly without any disturbances. He hadn’t even thought to turn on the television until tonight. He just had been too busy on working on updating Friday to the grey headpiece that apparently turned into a suit.
4) Bucky had been prisoner for a long time, but Peggy didn’t know how long and was the only survivor for the original group including the children. Those Hydra assholes.
“ Sex? Many, many times.”
Tony gasped when he felt the blunt head of his cock press in.
Loki’s lower lip trembled “ Are you saying that these Midgardians are more important than me? Was it really so hard just to contact me? Was I so disposable that I could be casted off like an old coat?”
“ Like a dog.”
Tony motioned for him to go on.
“ Well just keep your comments to your self,” Steve growled.
“ I have to agree with you there.”
“ We are having a training session tomorrow, if you’re interested.”
“ They are his family. He wants them safe. He won’t mind dropping you like a hot potato if you are meaning to hurt them. “
The equipment they had wanted him to look at was of Hydra origin. However, it had been attached to a creature. Bruce has explained they found the creature unconscious and beached in Hawaii with a Hydra labeled box attached to its tail. The creature had a thick and long navy blue tail with a dorsal fin running a portion on the back of the tail. The arms were scaly with a fin on the outer side of it running from the wrist to the elbow. At the end of the hands weren’t fingers but curved black claws.  Were the ears were supposed to be were fanned our fins that twitched  and flattened in annoyance and  anger. It was a lighter blue, like the dorsal fins, than the tail. Other than that he looked human, an incredibly gorgeous human with blonde hair, piercing blue eyes and a body of a Greek deity.
Sorry for the delay. Here is the next chapter. I hope you all enjoy it.:)
“ Nothing! I swear! He just strolled in the lab and introduced himself. I couldn’t  really ask him any questions because Cap and Grant freaking hate each other and they kept arguing.”
Tony looked up, his face smeared with marinara sauce and squealed in delight when he saw the box. He made grabby hands at Bucky as he handed it to him.
Peter ran out of there. He hated Wade. He hated his life. He hated that he was too naive to see his coming.
“ Super spider strength remember?”
Sorry about the late update. I’ve been very busy between school and work and it has made it difficult to update. I’m appreciative of everyone’s support and how that it continues.
“ As you have said before. Repeatedly,” she said venously, “And why this district attorney? Is it because he formally pressed charges against a man who was wearing an Iron Man suit and had attacked school children?”
“ Hmm?”
“ So what’s the issue?”
This vacation wasn’t bad so far. It’s actually has been pretty fun. It was good that those two idiots weren’t fighting. He hates it when they fight.
“ They’re going to be the death of me.”
“ Tony I want to-“
Tony nestled himself between Steve’s legs and mouthed at the already obvious erection. Steve groaned. Tony reaches out a hand and began to rub Grants erection. He stiffened under the touch and began to relax.
“ Yes how can I forget,” Bucky grumbled. Steve brought it up all the time.
Tony didn’t get the chance to deliberate much further  as Bucky made a pained whine and slumped against him. He looked up at the door and saw Bruce with a tranq gun and the rest of the avengers.
“ So big... oh fuck...” Morgan moaned as he felt the cock harden inside of him.
Steve pulled back and undid his belt and piped the button of his jeans. Tony quickly and gracelessly pulled his shirt of his head, excited from the chance to actually be able to touch his boyfriend again. Steve placed his hands on the waistband on Tony’s sweatpants and helped tony get his underwear and pants off in one go.
Winghead ignored him still and moved to the side and tried to lunge at Bruce who moved out of the way. Tony jumped on the merman’s back as he bucked wildly, angry at the sudden attempt to restrain him. He reared and flicked his tail, knocking Tony off and into the water.
“ What things?” Tony said softly.
Clint scrunched his face as if he were trying to remember. “ It would have to be Peg, right? Before she dumped his ass?”
Ned shrugged. “ Maybe it was normal in his time.”
The girl raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. Now that Tony noticed it, they were all dressed nicely and looked well groomed. Additionally they all had the same silver collars around their neck. It looked a lot fancier and lighter than the heavy metal collar he had been forced to wear for so long.
“ You look nice.” He said.
Quentin smiled and kissed his forehead. “ But I’m your doofus.”
Grant looks down sheepishly. “ We really didn’t read that far...”
“ Aren’t you handsome?”
“ Yeah and I’m a blonde. Now come on let’s go.”
“ But seriously though don’t tell our parents that I’m seeing Wade or texting Harry. They would flip.”
“Awesome! So do I. We can walk there together if you’re fine with that.”
“ But seriously though Tones,” Rhodey said, “ if they make you uncomfortable you don’t have to see them. I mean... it must be weird to see your parents and your own may be better than-“
“ Really?”
The minute they were in the car, Peter knew his dad would explode when they got home. His dad had been breathing heavily in the car and had his steering wheel in a death grip that turned his knuckles white. He had managed to go it somewhat together until he reached their floor in the tower.
“ Freak accident. He was driving from work in California  after some investor meeting when some drunk moron ran out into the road. He tried to miss the guy and swerved into a tree. He died on impact.” Clint explained.
Tony smiled and nuzzled his belly, content at the praise. He loved being praised and being cuddled. He was much like a puppy wanting love from his owner. Steve carded his fingers through the curly hair. Tony sighed in complete bliss. Steve continued to kiss him as Tony made small sounds of pleasure.
“Couldn’t tell. I thought he just tried to shoot me because he missed me.”
Gently. He learned early on that Tony would cry the minute he didn’t get his way.
“Ultron?”
Steve turned back to Tony. “ Do you need anything? Any food or water?”
Steve repositioned himself and Tony held onto his cock, lining him up and allowing Steve to thrust into him. It was easy due to the extra slick divided by Bucky.
Steve just rolled his eyes and turned back to the screen in front of him.
“ How long has this been going on? And be honest.”
“ Why don’t you just tell us why you are here. I don’t trust you. You could be a spy trying to infiltrate our ranks and endanger our team.” Steve growled.
“ Tony, maybe you should explain things to him. It will be good for him to have some structure for discipline.” Nat added
“ You are grounded!  Do you hear me? Grounded! You are not to have any lab time, no phone, no computers and no other form of technology and you will be weeding the garden and whatever other chores I can think of,” Maria seethed.
“ Shit. It’s not you. It’s just that, you deserve to have a good first kiss and that was shitty. Fuck, I just ruined that for you.”
“ So you found a mermaid,” he drawled.
Steve sighed and tried to place a kiss on Tony’s cheek, who evaded it. “ we just don’t want the team to think we are neglecting them. I mean we ditched the meeting. I don’t want them to think you know that I’m going to...” he flushed.
“ You can’t afford to retire.”
“ But how do we handle him now. If he is anything like you Steve he is bound to be very possessive. And looking at you, I think it’s same to assume that he wouldn’t mind tearing down anything in his way to get to Tony.”
“ Wait... wait.. Has Stark asked you to film a sex tape yet? I know he’s had a couple leaked in the past. I could imagine him wanting to do one for when he leaves on a business trip and can’t bring you two along.”
Steve motioned Tony to follow him as he headed to the elevator. Steve really didn’t look happy about it. Steve pressed a button on the panel and the elevators closed
“ But you didn’t hear what he called us!”
“ Well I think it would be more dignifying if we call him Steve. Dr. Strange did say that was his real name.”
Tony had swung his bat and he barely made contact. He turned around and smiled at Steve.
“ Don’t dad me.  He is probably having immoral thoughts. I don’t want him pressuring you into some S and M horror.”
“ I understand that. And Tony I need you to understand that this behavior upsets them. So I need you to try and Tone it down a bit. Grant, Steve you cant just beat up someone just because they were having a friendly banter with Tony and especially when you don’t know all the details. You broke Bucky’s nose and leg.”
