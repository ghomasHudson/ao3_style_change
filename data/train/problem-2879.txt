And together they moaned against each other’s lips as their bodies grew hot with pleasure, until both couldn’t take it any longer- who made the first move- they wouldn’t know- but in a second he and Dean’s lips met hot and messy in a kiss that spoke of passion and deep want.
’ it was feeling.
The first person he asked to see when he came to was Cas. No surprises there. He missed the omega so much.
Dean had been there for him ever since the miscarriage, however, he felt his alpha wasn’t all in the right headspace. He tried to be the best omega husband out there, also turning to comfort his alpha, but Dean would just say ‘
Shit!
Dean met his mother and father’s curious gazes. “Mom. Dad. I’d like you to meet someone special to me. This here is Castiel Novak. My beloved. My omega.”
“YOU WHAT!?” He folded his arms along his chest, “Gabe how could you!”
It was during family time that Castiel got to meet the two legged human versions of the entire Winchester family. It was time for a few beers and hot chocolate (for little Winchester) in the living room, by the fireplace.
Please tell me what you think!
Dean never left the omegas side, gently wrapping an arm around the trembling, frightened omegas mid back, pulling the omega to him. Her son narrowed his eyes at Chuck, “First of all, CHUCK, he is not wretched, he is beautiful like every other good omega out there, secondly, I asked him to come attend the event, after all I want him to come meet my parents and baby brother. I also want to declare to everyone that I will court Castiel and that he and my little brothers intended mate, Gabriel are to leave with my family and I tonight. They will now be provided a safe, non judgmental and secure home in Winchester lands.”
Craven sneered, “He went out on a midnight run, during my awakening!”
, Dean completed his omegas sentence.
Dean, the ever so curious explorer, asked, '
Dean sighed and met his lovers gaze, “I think we both are. How about we go pack her clothes and take it to her?”
He ignored the amused look on the sandy blonde haired alpha was spotting whilst he stared silently at their exchange. All he did was answer while his heart fluttered in his chest, “Hello Sam, my name is Gabriel Novak.”
He nearly jumped when he felt his brothers fingers thread into his. Gabe had decided to accompany him and their father to the drop off point. His little brother, who was the middle child, didn’t feel right staying home or imagining that he’d never see his big brother again.
Cas, pried open an eye lid, blue eyes peering at him.
He wasn’t no disrespectful brute. He wasn’t oblivious to the fact that this sudden arranged mating wouldn’t be hard for his intended omega too. This mating needed to happen.
Dean was almost stunned out of his skin when the Omega wolf stopped in its tracks, turning its massive head and narrowing its blue eyes at him, “I only respect alphas who give respect in return! Don’t expect respect from me if you don’t display it too!”
That’s what he called Jimmy’s messed up hair. He took a sip of his beer, feeling his heart squeeze lightly. Yeah. He missed Jimmy so much.
Now, all these feelings made him confused. What was happening? Why did he feel like tilting his neck to the side, just so the alpha could…NO! He won’t go there!
and doing
Now, here he sat, adorned in his usual and comfortable barbarian fur attire, ready to feast and celebrate further into the night with his warriors and their possible mates. There were no whores allowed- but he would make an exception tonight- Castiel was requested to attend.
He immediately sat up and smiled through the darkness. He replied, “Hey babe. I’m awake. Come in.” He flung his sheets off and sat up on the edge of the mattress, turning his bedside lamp on.
He pulled out of the hug, meeting Dean’s teary eyes through his own blurry vision. “I missed you too, Dean. It’s good to see you back home.”
Castiel decided he’d like to make pie for dessert tonight. At least that’ll keep his mind distracted from constantly thinking of his miscarriage, plus, his alpha would be thrilled to come home to his favorite, tantalizing, mouthwatering apple pie.
The next chapter doesn’t have much. The next chapter will probably see Lucifer being taken down.
Dean kissed the back of his knuckles, “Babe, calm yourself, please.”
So, when I get back into the groove, I will write a second part. I hope you understand.
Castiel held his head up high, eyes not stirring from his brothers, “My omega and I have decided that the bite will be delivered in a months time”. He and his omega began to walk past his brother and his goons. Castiel commented, “Now, if you’ll excuse us, I have to get my omega into a warm bath and some comfortable clothes”.
He was quiet, hugging daddy tighter.
Nostalgia.
Dean didn’t object. Instead, the man glanced at him with a soft smile, “Of course, Cas”.
(See the end of the chapter for
He and Dean’s little
Castiel had Dean pinned up against the wall, by the lapels of the man’s leather jacket. The death dealer sneered, “you lied to me about your father not accepting our love! HOW COULD YOU, DEAN!”
Rufus and Bobby only smiled at the boys being smothered in a cuddly hug by Ellen. The other two friendly alphas who made up the fourth and fifth members of the council were Pastor Jim and Daniel Elkins (the best damn tracker he currently knew).
before them. His eyes somehow dropped down to this patch of bushes by a huge boulder- just to the far right of Cas. Instead of heartache, he felt nostalgic. It was a good memory- finding Cas there. This whole place-
Castiel stood before the massive wooden doors that led into the great halls. His alpha had mentioned that his parents usually spent most their days here whereby they listened to the concerns a few citizens brought over. It was also in the great halls that judgement was passed and punishment was handed on in the form of sentencing.
He was just about to roll back to Dean’s side, when his ears caught a very familiar chirp in the air. The same one that followed him for 17 years of his life. His eyes found his little old Blue Jay friend, sitting up by the boulder that Dean had found him underneath, when he was a pup. His head perked up, he wiggled his ears, and, lightly yipped a greeting at the bird. The bird decided to fly over and sit on the top of his snout,
! But, I know that I cannot blame you for falling into the arms of another alpha!”
He watched how happy Mary and John were as they engulfed their eldest pup in their arms. Mary swooned over how gorgeous her alpha son had seemed to grow every year and John showed just how proud he was of his boy- with his words and hugs.
“They’re here.” Mary whispered, almost sounding excited.
These were just some of the words thrown at him during his high school years. Words that he had to endure, so quietly.
Charlie had picked a table that was in the center of the pub, upfront and near to the bar. On any other day, he would beg her to sit in a table in a dark corner, hidden from sight; however, he was comfortable to sit out in the open today.
The little omega wolf then aimed him those big blue ‘
He narrowed his eyes at the pup.
Dean heard what Castiel had said, but right now, he didn't care, because right now all he wanted was to devour his vampire boyfriend in the most sinful of ways for the umpteenth time tonight.
There was a whimper from Cas as Dean said those words- suddenly looking sad and teary eyed
So, those who have read my other fics know my style of writing by now. Hehe.
Cas added,
Dean tapped his nose repeatedly, “I could smell your aroused scent, Cas".
Another older wolf of the Milton council roared, “You will release the stinking halfbreed!”
His anger once again overcame him, and next he knew, he was stomping out his café towards Dean’s café.
He nodded. Wow. That was a big reveal. Question is, why?
But, his attention was focused on something else. And boy oh boy was his heart doing a somersault. That voice!
It made his heart fill up with jealous rage.
Castiel pulled Dean forward before slamming him back up against the wall. The groan of the lycan was
He watched as Ellen walked off, disappearing out of sight.
Dean shook himself out of his stunned state, turning his eyes away from the omega, pinching at a loose thread on his jeans and scoffing. Her oldest alpha was grumbling under his breath- who knows what the hell he was mumbling about, looking so defeated and resigned.
He couldn’t resist laying a hand atop Castiel’s, eyes meeting the side of the sweet omegas cheek, “Cas, you didn’t put Kaylen in danger ok. Nothing that happened here today is on you, I need you to understand that please.”
The Jay Brid chirped, lightly pecking his nose (which was ticklish), before taking flight back onto the boulder, hopping around on the rock.
This time Castiel released a cute giggle. “Of course Dean. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
He was being ridiculous. He could handle JIMMY’S TWIN. He said with determination, “Don’t worry about it Bobby. No sweat! I’ll handle things my way!” With that, he made his way towards the Impala, but, not before catching Bobby’s words.
And, it broke Castiel’s heart.
“Son, there's no choice. I can only delay your mating to Anna for the year, but until then, she has to live under your roof, while you and your omega try to conceive".
He was suddenly a little nervous. He replied, “Um, where would the engagement party happen, Sam?”
That thick white fur looked so glossy and radiant in the light of the sun; the omegas big blue eyes was a symbol of endless oceans; the kind wolf face looked happy and vibrant enough to make anyone smile and feel young at heart; that elegant long neck was inviting his wolf to sniff and snuffle into (which he had to control himself not to); and the height of the white wolf was just a foot shy of his great black alpha wolf height.
Michael nodded and spared a peak at his omega mate, Heather, who responded with a gentle nod of approval. And so the great white wolf sucked in a heavy breath before he told the exact same thing he had told Dean and Castiel a day ago.
But then, a week later, he couldn’t hide what they had lost any more. Things turned sour when Dean found out that their pup was gone, no longer growing in his womb.
All he could say was, “Oh”.
In his dreams!
Gabe eyed him like he had grown another head. His baker brother sighed, throwing in the towel, “well, the Fitzgeralds, the Lafitte’s, the Bakers, the West’s, the Braedens and Marge”.
is where he met his one true mate.
Hmm, that was quite unusual to be honest.
He got back to typing on his computer- hoping beyond hope that he wouldn’t tear up like a pathetic little shit. He was failing miserably as light tears clouded his eyes. Inside he was screaming ‘
Somehow, in his heart, he knew that the old friend ‘
Yes, it was uncertain now.
The Broodmaster’s, a vicious werewolf family, reigned over the werewolves- after William had been slaughtered by the vampires. And, to this day remained an important ally to the Lycans.
Mary clasped her heart, “Oh sweetheart, I am sure you will find him or her someday. Have hope and faith.”
Great. Now he would most probably be rejected again or looked down upon by everyone else today at the engagement party.
He saw the genuine pain in his father’s eyes and heard it in his voice. His father looked older than his years at this moment. He sighed, “Dad we can’t change what has happened, but we can do something to change these traditions. We must for the good of all.” Dean didn’t want to fight anymore, he was too tired. “You have the power as Winchester Pack Alpha to bring this up to the wolf council for reconsideration.”
Sam wished he could be with his babe too. Well guess the next best thing would be to call and say it over the phone. So, instead of replying via text he dialed Gabe’s number and within two rings the omega picked up.
He still itched to run after the omega, bouncing on his feet, meeting his dads composed green eyes, “But dad. He needs me!”
of the school football team. One that Lucifer was a part of.
Let me know what you think!🙂
It was Castiel who finally spoke. “I’m sorry that I put Kaylen in danger, Dean.” His voice trembled with sadness and an unmistakable fear. Now he just wanted to turn back time and rip Chuck and his posse a new asshole for upsetting his mate. But, he was more focused on the fact that Castiel had felt that he had put Kaylen in harms way.
They didn’t waste any time- well Castiel certainly didn’t- with the way he ordered Dean to strip, doing exactly the same, without warning shoving Dean unto the hay bed and swallowing that cock whole. There was some choking, some gagging, but soon, Castiel was expertly working that alphas cock with the right amount of suction and tonguing.
Cas had taken a step back like he had been slapped in the face with a massive revelation.
He asked,
He got back to fake scrolling through his computer.
He kept a day old scruff- because it made him look hella good.
He had no one, well except for his half brother, Gabriel. His half brother stayed with his wolf father in one of the cabins in the Milton Encampment- son of his mother’s second mate. The wolf was 2 years younger than him and was always friendly. If there was a wolf he cherished, it was his little brother, Gabriel.
Charlie blushed and sweetly said, “oh please, call me Charlie or Red!” She had the nerve to spare him a peek, wink at him, before saying, “Have fun learning, Cassie!” Before, she was walking over to the bar like she hadn’t just left her best friend to the wolves.
His dad asked curiously, “like a brother?”
Dean had thought of how his husband had cried himself to sleep last night. He trembled in his arms unable to contain his emotions any longer. It was too much for Castiel.
A/N: I apologize for the delay in posting, there has been so much going on in life that I hardly have the time to follow up with my stories. I will try making an effort to make time for my stories from now onwards, I promise.
Chuck’s annoying voice uttered in confusion, “You will what, Dean?”
. He quickly opened the message, excitement soaring as he read,
That sweet smile and renewed excitement in Cas face had him falling even harder than before.
He walked over to Cas, reaching out, and carefully cupping both Cas cheeks in his palms, steering the omegas watery blue eyes up to meet his. His heart shattering further, when he saw the

He watched as Anna's powerful orgasm drove Dean to the edge, making the alpha pound erratically into Anna, crying out his release into her soaking cunt. He watched as both shivered and held each others sweaty bodies- and from this angle- he felt they were sharing breathy kisses.
Chuck didn’t care, he just bellowed, “Look around you, Gabriel! Which alpha would ever want to give the half breed a chance, hmm!?”
It was nice to have someone you love seated beside you, sharing in this peaceful moment.
confessed.
The Jay Bird only tilted his head from side to side, eyes focused on him, while fluffing its feathers. It looked so happy to be basking under the glow of the sun, and, acted as if it were trying to project its happiness unto him. It hopped back and forth on its tiny feet, as if trying to entertain him with its goofy antics. It stopped and stared at him as he let out a giggle- and to him, the bird looked delighted that it had managed to make him laugh. The bird then sounded a final melodious chirp before it spread its wings and took flight, in the direction of its favorite tree, in the gardens.
he shared with Cas (not when he started dating Lisa). Like every young alpha, or teen, Dean made bad choices.
Dean chuckled, “you have a naughty way of marking me as yours, hmm”. The wolf slipped a hand into his pants, squeezing the globe of his firm ass. “I like it”.
Castiel scoffed, “Oh please! Don’t treat me like a child!”
They had had a hearty breakfast.
Midway up the stairs, he morphed into his tiny omega wolf. His stupid white furred omega wolf that was not as pretty as Lisa’s chocolate furred omega wolf. With tears running down his snout, he found his way into his bedroom, somehow managing to shut the door behind him.
Dean beamed, “Hey Cas”. The man pulled out an animal skinned pouch from his pocket, “I bought you a present".
He did want pups of his own someday. Soon. Hopefully.
My deepest apologies for lagging behind in this fic! I promise, that I’ll be updating this fic more often, as it is my main focus for now.
Castiel never felt so safe before. The feel of Dean’s warmth encasing him in a cocoon of love was the best experience ever. He sunk into Dean’s larger form, his entire back plastered unto Dean’s chest and torso, his legs entangled into Dean’s, feet resting in between his alphas. The way Dean’s strong arm wrapped around his middle, holding him so close made his insides all gooey and the best part was Dean’s calm breathing against the nape of his neck, those lips laying a kiss right atop his spine. The alpha’s voice a deep lazy rumble, “Is this ok, sweetheart?”
promise too- LIKE THE LAST TIME! Am I right PRINCE DEAN?” Castiel huffed, “Why don’t you stop beating around the bush and just admit that the reason you want to pay a visit is to screw my big sister, Anna! As if you don’t have any whores to screw in your thriving kingdom!”
They both entered their rooms, morphed into their human forms, got themselves ready and psyched, before they were walking down the stairs, hand in hand, ready to break news to John and Mary Winchester.
Cas asked while burying his nose into Deans neck- not so subtly inhaling his alpha scent. “Dean, are you ok? I was worried about you.”
He knew what was happening to him. He had learned about this
John was the fourth Winchester in line to rule, after his father, Henry. Hence, when Henry suddenly disappeared or in John's words murdered and his body stuffed away secretly, that’s when John Winchesters reign began. And, soon, if it's John's will, Dean will be his successor.
Before Dean could go anywhere, he timidly asked, “Dean. Will you tell them about Bal and me…um about me and him…you know?” Yeah, he could feel the blood rush up his neck and ears. He met the alphas glassy green eyes-
Castiel could only swallow the lump in his throat, tears brimming with more unshed tears, leaning into his palm that cupped the side of the omegas cheek, “Ok Dean. Ok.”
Dean knew she was right. He couldn’t hurt her in any way, mostly because it wasn’t in his nature to harm any omega. Nevertheless, he wasn’t going to stay mum. He pointed out, “yes I can’t hurt you, physically, but, don’t you ever mistake me for someone who will just lay around idle. I will find a way to get you off Cas and I’s back! Mark my damn words! In the meantime, if you ever get handsy with me again, I will report you. That is still sexual harassment!”
Cas had to meet Dean’s gaze with a confusing weary look. Still those green eyes didn’t seem unfazed. There was just pure curiosity and honesty in those beautiful alpha eyes he had come to love so much. He asked almost weakly, “Won’t your parents find me…unsuitable…for their prince?” He chewed his bottom lip, heart squeezing just a little as he admitted, “I mean, I am just a poor commoner.”
He chuckled, “So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?- Oh Sammy, my Sammy.”
status like him.
And, in the end, all he wanted to do was help the struggling pack.
This time, when he got to Castiel’s office, he didn’t just barge in. He stopped behind the door and actually raised a hand to knock. Maybe, Castiel was busy and it’ll be rude to just walk in…
He couldn’t help but spare a peek at Dean and
Daddy was about to say something else, but Castiel interfered, “Cas sounds lovely. Kaylen is right Dean, it is easier.” Oh he loved the way Castiel looked at daddy- like he was in love. It’s the same way grandpa looks at grandma.
He turned to lay on his back, stretching his arm that was closer to Cas out as an invitation, eyes searing into his omegas shy blue ones lighting up the darkness. “Of course sweetheart. My heartbeats are yours to fall asleep to.”
“Yeah. Jimmy and I knew what we were involved in and we enjoyed It. Yes, we cared for each other, very much, but, we were also very easily irritated with one another. And, we may have threw in the ‘
wouldn’t lead them astray. He figured Dean believed that too.
So, he asked, “So, what made you so drawn to Jimmy?…If not for love”.
When the front door slammed shut, Cas turned to face him with renewed anger on that beautiful omega face. The omega strode over to him, definitely into his personal space (creating this pleasant, yet, tense vibe), jabbing at his chest repeatedly, “You didn’t visit for 2

Of course John had spotted Chucks sudden change of heart too.
(he honestly didn’t know why). He grumbled below his breath and began rubbing Cas white furry tummy, trying to keep a stoic face as Cas purred in happiness -
Warning: Description of drug overdose and resulting death in this chapter...please do not read if this triggers you!!!!! Also, mentions of fatal car accident....
Wow. That was big. Too big. For both he and Cas.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was too late to save Jimmy. The doctors said that he had probably taken the pills the previous night and blacked out to the world. He had been dead hours before Castiel found him.
“I stay away till you’re 21”.
Both omega and alpha just nodded.
He felt himself falling back on his steps as he neared Jimmy’s gravestone. The teen lay between his grandparents gravestones. Guess it was only fitting. Jimmy never really got over his grandparents tragic passing and he absolutely adored them. But, his boy was strong headed. That much he knew.
Castiel balked, “You’re dating his youngest-?”
Even though Dean was buried in Anna, the alphas attention was completely focused, narrowly on him. Then, the omega in him saw how Dean licked his lips, nose up in the air, sniffing. He watched as Deans eyes widened as the alpha caught a scent. He moaned when Dean said in that husky, sexed out voice, “Apple pie. My favorite”.
Their lips slotted perfectly, moving in tandem and seeking each others’ taste. Cas lips so soft and warm between his- so pure and delicious.
Cas chuckled warmly, his free hand, covering one of his that was resting on the man’s tummy. Cas laid his head back into his shoulder, stretching out that fine neck that his eyes were drawn to- making his mouth water- with the want of sucking hickeys into it. Maybe, someday, he would.
“Dad, how am I going to explain to Cas what the council require of me to do!?” He rubbed a hand down his face, “He'll be devastated! Heck! We just recently lost a pup, dad!” He really wanted to pull the hairs out of his own scalp.
Well, maybe he’ll get to tell that someone that this dusty junk yard would warrant a car wash by the end of today. He took a deep breath and headed into Bobby Singers Auto Repairs, already wishing to get through the day and get back to the comforts of his lonely apartment.
He heard Mary’s inaudible reply. “Coming John! Just a sec!”
Anyway, this chapter is Cas POV only. We’ll get a Dean POV next. I promise. And, brace for a heart wrenching chapter...I hope you enjoy!
He found himself unconsciously huddling close to alpha Dean’s side, seeking to bask himself in the alphas scent of comfort. He hummed in delight when he felt the alphas strong arm encircle his mid waist, pulling him closer, till he was sat sideways on the wolf’s firm muscular lap. He turned his head, eyes immediately finding those green piecing ones and in slight trepidation, whispered, “Alpha?”
Castiel only beamed lovingly at Dean from where he stood, his eyes sparkling like the stars in the clear night skies. “Yes, lets go celebrate Gabriel.”
Heather answered. He remembered how his mom couldn’t have any more kids too; barren too- so it did hit a soft spot within him.
There was a tiny whine from Cas- vulnerable and hurting. He only rubbed his snout affectionately along the top of his omegas head and ears, a deep, chesty, rumble of comfort, vibrating out of him. He was working on instinct and wolf nature alone. Right now, all that mattered was providing that comfort to Cas during his hurting times. All else, did not matter at this point in time. Cas knew too and the omega also sought. The omega croaked out (whilst his head was still snuggled into his chest),
Pam shook her head, “No master Castiel. Dean did.” The servant winked, “The alpha is quite fond of you, I must say.”
He was a little on the fence with what Missouri was saying. It made him feel joy, yet, at the same time scared. He gathered himself and smiled, “Ill see you in a couple of days, Missouri”.
He furrowed his brows, “Who’s here?” Before he could explore further, he heard a deep gruff voice calling out from behind them. He turned to find that it was none other than his beloveds big brother, making him glance back into the side of Castiel’s face, “Dean. Dean Winchester?”
He has thought of kissing those damn lips, every damn day since the bar. Seize the day, right. So, he dragged his eyes back up to meet Cas lightly blown pupils, admitting so softly, “Cas, I really want to kiss you right now.”
Thinking about these things; feeling this way- about Castiel- was starting to get him wondering- ‘
“That my personal physician gives you a once over, just to make sure that you’re sound”.
He sighs loudly when he hears the honk of a car horn outside his tiny apartment. He walks over to the window and sees that it’s Gabriel’s unmistakable expensive beauty of a car- a BMW- who the hell drives a BMW here!
“Jimmy saved me from myself, Cas.  He opened the eyes of a closeted teen to the world. He was an amazing guy and I swear that I would have eventually fallen in love with him, if our relationship carried on. Jimmy was my drug. And, he took a whole chunk out of me when he passed, so I was too afraid to stay”.
He felt his eyes slowly drooping shut, replying in a sleepy haze, “Yes Dean. Mmm ok.” The last thing he heard was Dean whispering into his ear, “Goodnight Omega mine. Sweet dreams.”
There was this nagging sense of familiarity deep within him, the longer he stared at the well polished and, it seemed, well loved car. It’s like he had encountered this car somewhere…sometime….in his life. He just couldn’t put his finger on it!
Just like that, the elder vamp disappeared into the darkness.
“Yeah. I have. It’s going fine”. He took another huge gulp as his thoughts drifted over to Castiel.
Kaylen didn’t stop talking, asking with his head tilted to the side, “What colors your wolf, Cas?” He continued to add, “my furs brown like daddy’s and I got a white bushy tail!”
be ok?
He scoffed, “shut up, Benny”. There wasn’t a bite to his tone.
Little did they know, danger was already lurking in the dark of the streets.
And his name was Cas!
And if Kaylen was happy, then he was happy too.
Before him stood Dean Winchester, in a white button up, black thigh and ass hugging jeans and tan boots- holding a bouquet of red roses and wearing a charming smile. The man raked his eyes over him, before saying, “Damn. You look smoking, Cas!” The man held out the flowers, suddenly looking shy, “These are for you”.
over Dean. And her little alpha didn’t even realize it, nor did the little omega. One of the signs of a great bond in the making. They would learn of this power as the years pass by. The omega always held the upper hand in the relationship.
So, when it approached the 3rd hour of tossing and turning, he decided to throw in the towel. He sat up, threw his covers to the side, swung his feet off the mattress and got to his feet. Without much thought he walked towards his door, flung it open and headed down the hallway to Dean’s bedroom.
Cas sniffled and asked,
Dean felt his voice crack, “Of course I feel what you mean baby. Your pain is exactly the same I feel, though I know you had more of an emotional connection to our pup and are feeling more. I- feel like a failure hon, like I didn’t protect my pup from anything horrible”.
Sam looked uncomfortable and nervous. The omega stuttered, “I wasn’t supposed to say, Gabe. Not until we are officially married.”
Nowadays, Dean spent more time with Lisa; laughing together, giggling together, cuddling, hugging and kissing. They probably thought that he didn’t see, but, he saw. Many times, Lisa would come over and hang out with Dean at their place. Daddy always dropped her back in the evenings- and Dean always accompanied them.
Mary nodded, ruffling the hairs on the top of his head. “Ok sweetie. Just call and check up on him to see if he’s home safe, yeah.”
And that’s how he closed the gap and sealed his lips unto his mates soft beautiful ones. It was the best feeling ever and he swore there were fireworks.
Castiel took Dean from behind, so deliciously. The vampire pounding his large cock into the lycans lubed up hole. He gripped that waist hard, thrusting in and out, watching his cock slide repeatedly into that nice, tight cavern. The pleasures coursing through both their bodies was too much to describe.
He watched as Cas closed his eyes in contentment, the man’s face contorting into one of absolute bliss- as he took the first bite of his cheese burger. Castiel hummed in delight, “Oh my God! This makes me very happy”.
Something seemed to shift in Dean’s eyes before it was gone. He watched the alphas brows furrow slightly and his adam’s apple bob, before Dean asked quite timidly, “Um- was it good dreams?”
Dean had that ‘
Too charged.
Now, here he was, sitting in his car, bright eyed and bushy tailed, smiling all the way to work. He didn’t want to keep his hopes up, but, he also didn’t want to squander it. He had woken up a changed man, for sure. He had promised himself that he would do as Charlie had said, when they first started on their beers.
Nothing captivated him more in his life till date than the gorgeous hunk of an Adonis who seemed to be busy chatting up a slightly shorter 6 foot tall sandy blonde haired alpha, standing by the water fountain. Both wolves were well built and looked stronger than any other alpha he had seen, which could only mean that they were Winchester wolves.
John nodded, taking a sip of his beer. “Well, your mother and I approve too. He is certainly charming.”
Mary gnawed at her bottom lip, squinting her eyes and looking lost in thought. “Hmm. I don’t know John. I’m thinking Dean, years back.”
Chuck used Castiel’s hesitancy to mock the omega, “See, nothing but lies coming from both these two omegas mouths. Castiel and Gabriel are both liars!”
For the first time, in a long time, despite the riff-raff of their lives, he felt that good was on its way.
He nodded, “Ok, Dean. Thanks.” He placed the vase in the center of his dining table before taking few steps back and studying how the roses changed the outlook of his humble dining area. It certainly added color and life to the surrounding. He turned and smiled brightly at Dean, “Perfect!”
Dean was going to learn where he stood in the town of Harmony.
“Oh John. Leave the pup here. You go scout out the woods and if you find the pups parents, then you can invite them over to come get their pup. It’s going to be getting cold soon and I don’t think it wise to be carrying a very tiny pup around when temperatures drop”.
There were pleasant warmth and tingles traveling up his fingers and into his hand, the longer he pampered Cas- something he found common whenever he laid his hand (s) on Cas. Again, he wondered what that weird feeling meant. His fingers were getting a little numb now, so he pulled it away to shake the numbness off. “I swear that my hand will fall off one day, Cas!”
He remembered the kisses, the drunk fooling around, the naked times under the sheets, the jokes, the pranks played, the classes skipped, the fooling around under the bleachers and the janitors closets; the leather jacket, motorcycle riding teen who had the most beautiful blue eyes, with the cockiest attitude.

Dorothy was Charlie’s wife and one of Dean’s good friends in high school. He wasn’t really close to her, but, she was nice to him. She didn’t talk about high school much- which was fitting as she had lost her best friend,Jimmy, too. Dorothy was a cool chick and if you asked him, he would say that she’s ‘
Cas replied with a sigh of contentment, “Yes, Dean. A second date is warranted.” The blue eyed man gnawed at his bottom lip and asked, “And, I’d like the honor of planning it, if you allow me?”
Gabriel all but nodded. “Ok Sammy.”
He met his dads eyes, “No. Something more dad. Something that scares me….though it feels good.”
John sighed, sitting on his favorite leather chair. The older Winchester smiled a little on the sad side, ‘Son, you and Sam are sons to the pack leader, therefore, it is customary that you are mated between the ages of 20- 25.’ The alpha leader rubbed a hand down his face, ‘Look son, mating doesn’t mean that you immediately give up on yours goals and aspirations. It doesn’t mean you start a family immediately. You and your intended mate can still continue your education, make something of yourselves and when you’re ready have a family.”
Gabe rested his head just above his heart. “True mates always find their way back to each other, Sam. Let time play its part.”
“Mhmm?” Sam didn’t sound convinced.
He couldn’t help but feel like a piece of his heart was being torn off as Dean and Anna had sex nearly every hour, until the sun came up.
Wait. What?
The hug seemed to go on for some time- as if both weren’t wanting to let go.
(See the end of the chapter for
The alpha looked as if he was pleading, now combing those thick fingers through the dark locks of his hair, making the omega within him purr. “I am not fooling you, omega. I am serious. Give me a chance to win your trust, please?”
Dean shrugged. “Yeah baby. I’m certain.” Dean smiled softly, thumbing circles into his omegas cheek, “See, my mom and dad have a similar love story to ours. Dad a prince, mom was a commoner. They met when dad accidentally knocked her off her feet in the markets in the city. All the apples and vegetables she had harvested from her families farm had gone flying into the air. She had cursed at my dad but my dad was completely mesmerized by her. Slowly, they fell in love and dad ended up mating and marrying her. My grandfather didn’t say a thing, all he wanted was his son to be happy. So, yeah, my parents have gone through something similar to our love, so they understand. In fact, they are over eager and excited to meet you. Will you um- do you want to um- return with me to the castle Cas?”
Oh he missed the days Jimmy would take care of him.
Rufus cackled like a manic, while he, Dean and Castiel began laughing hard outside. It was a good few minutes before everyone calmed and that was when he heard the third alpha speak up in a completely uninterested voice- a woman alpha who had the temper of a fire breathing dragon, who could kick the shit out our any burly or masculine alpha in this damn state, “Ok you two! Zip it up! Ain’t got time for your old man issues!”
’. But, she knew just how to nag at him, and, he always gave up- with that pout! He released an unimpressed huff, before he grabbed the cue stick being offered to him. “Fine! But, if I’m going to make a fool of myself, then, you might as well buy me my next beer!”
Cas blushed further, leaning in and boldly planting a peck on his lips, before pulling away. The man playfully scratched his scalp at the back of his head- or more like tickle massaged the back of his head with those fingers, saying so dreamily, “I look forward to more kisses in the future, Dean. You will show me…right?”
Now, the time was here. Tomorrow, he and his father would go to the town borders edge and await the delivery of the omega by the town alpha. Though, the thought of the omega being told to just up and leave his family always bothered him. If it were up to him, he would unite the forest and town wolves.
He was only midway through the semester and his rut had already began. Usually, it took place during the end of the year, as temperatures were much colder and tolerable to cater for a rut. However, it would seem that he is an early bloomer.
This time Dean’s voice was not that of a young teenaged boy, but that of a man, deep, gruff yet soothing in a way as he replied somewhere close behind Castiel, “Dad. Mom.”
Oh that was the final straw for Castiel. Dean watched in sudden shock when his omega lover stomped toward Anna, grabbed a fistful of her red hair and dragged her kicking and screaming, towards the basement. “Let me go, you psycho!”
Dean couldn’t help but lower his gaze to the floor of the car, hugging himself tighter as he felt a sudden chill run through his entire being. He flatly stated, “So that I’m sound enough to be sold as a sex slave. No one wants to fuck a beat down omega”.
He ran up to Cas, “Cas hold me!”
His eyes scanned the area.  No one else, except for Samuel, the bodyguard and the omega.
Dean guided his cock, smoothly into Castiel’s leaking hole. Both moaning and sucking in breaths at the tightness. It was something else to be buried to the hilt inside Castiel. It was heaven. Dean studied Cas face for any signs of discomfort as he pulled out a little and sank back in. Cas face scrunched a little before it relaxed, the omega’s grip on his biceps tightened. He asked , “Babe, ok?”
He should be the one doing that, but, he ran.
. It resorted to more traditional types of methods of baking pie and cooking coffee. A family speciality, that they felt added flavor to pies and coffee.
He replied with enthusiasm, “Yeah, I’d love that Cas! This coming Saturday at 7pm sound good?” He asked, just the way Cas had done with him at Janes.
It took Dean at least a minute to make up his mind.
Cas asked,
Cas sighed with a soft smile, lost in what seemed like a pleasant thought, while staring at the window by the sink (which had a view of the gardens outside). “Hmm. I miss the wind ruffling my wolf hairs and the scrunch of twigs and leaves under my paws.”
Anna smirked a teasing smirk, “we’ll see who becomes the omega of this household”. She added sarcastically, “right Castiel!? I mean it’s always been me. I’m just better than you”.
He may be a young of age alpha, but, sometimes he needed his mom and dad by his side.
Dean smirked at his blushing mate, “So, baby, lets get to making little Winchester or Winchesters.”
Castiel was sitting not too far, eyes focused solely on the plate of food before him. When Dean didn’t think anyone was looking, he would spare a quick peek at Cas, before, diverting his attention back down to his plate, forking at a string of bacon. There was this undeniable, palpable, tension between the two.
Sam was like a dog with a bone to find. When he sniffed its location, you could bet he won’t stop till he digs it up or snatches it away. His brother would get things out of him one way of the other. So, he settled for saying, “look I’ll tell you everything tonight, ok”. He glanced at the papers in his hands, “In the meantime, I gotta get my signed contract back to the accountant, get the tour of the garage done- which FYI I already know the layout, but, Ellen says it necessary for all new employees and no one can argue with that woman anyways”. He sighs, “I start proper tomorrow. I seriously can’t wait to get my hands greased up!”
He huffed, “what is it Benny?”
. The omega nodded, but her eyes held this underlying mischievousness that Dean would have to keep a lookout for. “Mhmm Dean”.
He stuttered out, with fear laced in his voice,
And judging by the way little Kaylen had gotten along with him, he would conclude that he would someday make a good papa. And maybe he already held that title with Kaylen. Who knows what the pup may refer to him as in the not to distant future.
He smiled lightly at his dad, feeling that he at least had the power to make things right. That this wasn’t completely a lost cause. He felt his alpha rising up to the occasion, puffing out his chest a little, “Firstly, I will apologize to him. And secondly, I will make him a promise that no matter what, I will always make time for him.”
sounding from his phone.
Nevertheless, he replied, “You too, Cas”. He walked out of the office, feeling much better than the last time he left.
So, he pulled up beside the sidewalk, next to ‘
Like he, Dean was casually dressed in a red plaid long sleeved shirt and black jeans with black boots. The man actually resembled the look of a bad boy- with a charming lopsided cheeky grin. He bit his bottom lip, seeing Dean follow the movement with those green eyes. He blushed hard, “Hey Dean. Welcome.” He stood to the side to allow Dean access in.
Somehow, he wanted to show off his blue eyed prize to the entire pack. Maybe, take the male omega before all- the way any true ruling alpha barbarian would.
Dean Winchester, alpha son to John Winchester, was the lead commander of his warrior pack. He was a loyal soldier, determined to defend his people till his last breath. His people were known as ‘Black Wolves’ due to their dark shade of fur which reflected the night sky. They were known to hide in the shadows and attack when you least expected.
Yes or no-
Castiel asked quite intimidatingly, “Does she know about Dean and I!?”
Another long chapter guys....🙂
There was nothing wrong with his beloved girl; his loss of concentration was due to Castiel Novak’s lame-o car parked right next to his.
Castiel whirled around in a flash, hand poised on the handle of his blade. He was ready to defend himself, but when his eyes landed of the familiar, short, blonde, smirking vamp, leaning against the tree trunk, he found himself instantly calming and sighing in annoyance, “Gabe! How many times have I told you not to sneak up on me like that!?” He stowed his blade back into his specially designed holster attached to his belt by the side of his hip. “Well, tell me to what do I owe the pleasure of a visit from a Milton?”
He nodded and let his mind wonder. Oh what would his intended mate look like? Would he have dark hair, blue eyes, perfect lips? -
I’ll try to update more regularly from now onwards. I hope you enjoy this chapter.
I am so sorry that I did not update in a week. I have been real busy and when I finally get the time to update, I'm tired. Anyway, here's a long chapter for you...I hope you enjoy!
Smooth Dean! Real smooth!
He let out a breath, settling some, however, was still slightly on alert and on edge.
He couldn’t wait. He just needed this once. So he shyly asked, “Cas, can I- um- can I kiss you, please?”
John asked, “So, son, have you met Balthazar?”
All Dean thought of now was '
Oh how his heart ached with sadness and sorrow.
Dean shrugged, “This festival happens once every year, Cas. It usually lasts a week”.
He felt his boyfriend/future mate snuggle closer into his side, drawing circles on his chest whilst listening to the beat of his heart. “Sammy, I wish moments like these last forever.”
- making Dean smile so bright.
Sam again pleaded, “Please Castiel. It would mean the world to Gabe and I if you attended.”
Castiel asked, “Can I call you Gabe?”
couldn’t. He couldn’t to Deans words of
Dean couldn’t just lay back. He needed to please his omega too. He ordered, “I want to taste you! Come up here!”
Sam shook his head, “Nah-Uh! I still don’t wanna hear it Dean!”
He had decided to go with something Dean might enjoy.
Then, there was that slightly uncomfortable information that Cas
Michael answered, almost sounding deflated and worn out.
I hope you enjoy this chapter 🙂
He and Castiel shared a room, upon the omegas insistence. Castiel said he wanted to be near him, he was afraid of losing his alpha. Of course, he allowed it, and kept to his side of the bed. It was up to the omega if he wanted anything more, but he wasn’t going to push. He of course reassured his omega that he wasn’t going anywhere. Seeing Cas relieved smile made him happy.
He had a feeling that Dean probably wanted to talk about what happened at dinner a week and a half ago, so yes, he was a little nervous. He didn’t know what the alpha might say, and he could only hope that it’s good.
Feedback and kudos are much appreciated! 🧐
Again why didn’t he know about this?
Cas should be jumping for joy, however, he couldn’t help but feel extremely uncertain and nervous. He was a commoner after all. He knew this wasn’t something royalty accepted with open arms. Particularly the parental’s of his alpha mate. There was structure, there was responsibility, there were expectations that Dean had to fulfill. He drew circles around the center of his alphas naked chest, watching his index finger intently. “Um. W-What about your parents Dean?”
and an inkling of
Blue Jay leads the way....
His eyes narrowed in concern.
Not anyone else!
He only hoped Castiel would give him a chance.
He sensed it the instant he stepped out of his bedroom to Dean’s yells sounding through the upstairs hallway. Especially, when he caught sight of daddy rushing in and out of Deans room; momma handing daddy a few weird things, a basin of iced water and a cloth.
His hands were
John and Mary were listening to a farmers concern when the doors to the great hall swung open. In walked their oldest and behind him, another, who seemed to be in deep hesitation and using Dean as some sort of shield from view.
He trembled. He was upset and angry. His comfort right now was his old bedroom at his parents house- just sitting on the edge of his bed, head bowed and staring at his feet, away from the crowd at his little brothers engagement party.
The alpha looked determined as he stated, “I will pop by from time to time, omega. And when you’re 21, I will marry you”. The alpha graced an index finger down his right cheek, “Remember that omega”.
So, great ready for some sad baby Cas😢
Anna folded her arms along her chest, pushing out her jaw, “Castiel will not satisfy you Dean! He is still a child and cannot provide you any pleasure I can!” She knew that using the
He felt
He scowled at the alpha as he was jerked forward by his binds, nearly making him trip over his own feet, the alpha barking, “Keep up Castiel!”
“As much as it pains me, yes”.
Castiel smiled a smile that didn’t totally reach his eyes. “Yeah. I guess so”.
A few tears slipped into his true mate’s pillow and a muffled apology would follow. “I’m sorry my omega”.
, growled out.
Of course he would avert his eyes to the book he read, before he could see Castiel’s jeans slide down the curves of his ass. He would pretend to find the words of the book he was reading in bed interesting. But, he swore to whatever deity that he was feeling all hot and fluffy underneath.
“Why would you punish and isolate someone who has been nothing but kind, compassionate and caring to everyone, hmm!? He didn’t ask to be born a half breed!” He held unto Sam’s hand for comfort and to restrain his alpha from charging after the Milton Pack leader.
He sat between Grandma and Castiel, in his high chair. He dug into his pancakes, it was so yummy that he was humming in delight. When he finished, he thanked grandma for the lovely pancake. Daddy always says ‘
He smiled at his now slightly nervous children and winked, “Don’t worry.” He thumbed towards the council hall, “Those alphas in there are close to losing their entire teeth. Well two of them at least.”
The Winchester and Novak Pack were sworn enemies for decades. Always engaged in feuds, wars and acts of vengeance. Their history was riddled with blood stains as they refused to give in or let the other claim territories. As time passed, their tolerance for one another only grew thinner. Wars and feuds became an almost everyday thing- trying their best to keep their boundaries up and their territories safe from intruders.
Cas stubborn façade was back. And damn, another time, he would have found the omegas feisty nature hot, but, not today. The omega folded his arms along his chest, eyes narrowed at him and chin jutting out in full mischief, “What does it look like to you, Dean!?”
He sighed. His jaws ached, but, he couldn’t leave this pup here.
That’s when a cold chuckle without any humor, resonated through the alleyway. Craven then stepped out of the shadows, his long shoulder length hair as stiff as the pale vamp. The vampire sneered in disgust, “whether by your choice or not, whatever goes on between you and that werewolf is the most despicable act of betrayal to our family coven!” The elder shifted his eyes to Dean, “This means war”.
Instead of brushing Deans
A sweet romance they had and despite the years of heartache Sam’s older alpha brother had put him through-
Seeing Cas face when the man inhaled the delicious aroma of food wafting out the little classic diner made him feel super excited and thankful. The icing on the cake was the rumble of Cas hungry tummy-  which got the man to blush so adorably- probably from his shyness. But, he wasn’t focused on that.
Then, the horrifying day before senior graduation came.  July 6th, Jimmy Novak had overdosed on his anxiety meds. It was on the morning of graduation that Castiel found his brother, lifeless in his room.
“We apologize Gabriel, but it is not for anyone outside of the pack to know”, John responded
Castiel scrunched his nose, “Bleh! No thank you! I'd prefer to see you in less hair".
He froze though when Mary turned to him and asked, “Where’s Balthazar, baby? Dad can drop him back now, if you’re done with your studies.”
Nothing felt more hurtful, at this point in time, than seeing Dean leave so abruptly.
Dean shook his head and rubbed a hand down his face. The alpha took several steps back to lean once more against the door, blowing out a heavy breath into the air. It took several seconds for Dean to properly look at him- a little hunger had flown out the alphas eyes, now replaced by a sort of promise, “We need to settle a few things first, Cas. Soon, I promise, sweetheart.”
From his little, isolated cabin, built on a lonely hilltop, he could see everything. Just down the foot of the hill was a grand outdoor setup of lights, tables, chairs- all adorned in white décor.
to each other, nor cuddled like they used to
Bobby slipped in a few drops of whiskey into his coffee before taking a huge gulp. The old man hummed in delight and said, “So, when the accountant comes in, you can start on your paperwork. He’ll draw up a contract for you. Today, I want you focused on reading the contract and getting familiar with the auto shop. Tomorrow, you can start up on fixing cars”.
As promised, he left the bar at 11pm.
Their eyes weren’t red, not under the rays of the setting sun. Two had grass green eyes and one had light brown eyes. Those eyes had a commonality; they all portrayed a certain softness.
He gave the omega credit for maintaining a certain calmness, voice sultry as the beauty spoke, “Here I am, alpha. Yours for the taking.”
tonight. “SO Cassie. Don’t you think he’ll be furious if he finds out you’ve been sleeping with a lycan?” Gabe added, “Don’t you think he’d reign war down upon the two species if he found his beloved fucking a vile beast?”
Dean saw that his mate was stunned. Much like he was when seeing how beautiful the forests really looked. He said,
Dean couldn’t see straight through his pleasured state. However, their lips were able to find each other’s even more hungrier than before. Dean hiked up one of Cas knees to hook along his waist, leaving more room for Dean to shove three fingers into Cas hole. They were standing there grinding hard into each other, devouring each other’s lips and moaning hard.
He had to admit- it was the way Cas eyed ‘
Castiel only nodded, unconsciously saying, “my one and only beloved.”
Before he knew it, he was getting up on his paws, and, trotting over to the blue jay. The blue jay chirped in delight before taking flight once more-
It was maybe cruel to wish Castiel be mateless, but he wanted the wolf to himself.
It was time to go home.
Maybe, all hope is lost. Sex slave to the great alpha Dean he would be the rest of his pathetic life.
FYI- Dean and Cas are communicating telepathically. (In Bold-Italics)
Cas- the omega wolf- whined so pitifully, “But, Dean…..please!” The little wolf blinked his eyes repeatedly- fanning those long lashes- trying to be cute!
Dean gulped loudly, too spooked to even move, “who are you? Why do you smell so delicious?”
“But, Dean, you know what this means! If Castiel doesn’t conceive within the year, then you will have no choice but to plant your pup in Anna's womb! Secondly, Anna still has to come live with you both as per order of the Council”.
Yeah. Like he said.
Perks of being the largest pack in the state.
This time his eyes snapped up to meet the alphas green ones with such burning intensity, he grit out feeling the tremble in his voice, “Firstly, it’s called a brothel! Secondly, we dress provocatively to rile our clients up, but fully naked sex happens in our own private spaces- it’s better that way. Our naked bodies are only for our paying clients.”
Cas was a vision in white.
But, the instant he heard that break in Cas voice as he asked to be excused, the instant he spared a peek only to see tears rolling down those beautiful cheeks, the instant he realized that Cas stood there, looking down as if
. The love of Lucian's life. But, things turned sour and their love was discovered. It was then, Lucian was captured and made to watch his beloved die an excruciating death- by direct sunlight.
The alpha wolf in him took that as an invitation for a chase. His wolf heart sped up,
Castiel suspected what Gabe was here for. Apparently, news always spread fast in the Novak mansion. He lightly touched his brother’s chest, sighing, “Gabe, now isn’t exactly the right time to meet my omega. He is resting now, plus, too much attention will overwhelm him”.
He never felt more relieved when he shut the door to his home, sliding down to sit on the floor. He leaned his head back unto the wood, closed his eyes and took deep breaths to will his erratically beating heart to return to its normal rhythms.
He spoke through his silent tears, “Guess its just me and you, huh? As always.” He sniffled (in complete sadness) and stood up from his spot in the grass, dusting his jeans down, before he spared one last glance at the Annual Meet. He whispered, “Till next year.”
A/N: Cas is still five in this chapter and Dean is still nine years old.
“Because, I didn’t like her getting all up in my space like that, Cas. Because she felt like an intruding omega to me, Cas. Because she had the nerve to bad mouth you in front of me, Cas.” He licked his lips and carefully uttered words true to his heart, “But, mainly because she upset you, Cas. I didn’t like that at all.”
It was one of many beautiful moments to come in their lives.
Henceforth, to be fair, he had to end things with Balthazar.
Mary shooed all that were in the hall, “Leave. We will pick up matters first thing tomorrow morning.”
Deans legs finally kicked into gear, his shock wearing out. He followed and called out a little on the freaked out side. “Cas! Baby! Let her go!” He was once again met with his omega husbands angry icy cold eyes.
He nodded. “Ok Mary”.
He released a wet chuckle, “You were one hell of a cheeky rascal, Jimmy”. His smile fell, “I miss you, very much. And….I’m sorry that it took me this long to come back and see you. I just…I lost my way”. He sniffled and wiped a hand down his tear stained face, blowing out a breath. He nodded with a shaky smile, “But, I’m here now. I’m here to stay. I know you would have wanted me to be here….you always reminded me that family was important…so a little late start”. He reached out to grace his fingers over the petals of white roses, “Just, be with me in spirit, yeah”.
Suddenly, there was a strong alphas voice- like the one he heard in his head- but a little rickety and cracked, swimming through his mind,
. And after meeting Cas and the way he had fallen so rapidly for the blue eyed man, he would conclude that maybe, he felt drawn to Jimmy because Cas was also a part of his twin.
on this planet he will always be.
The alpha shrugged, “labels are useless. You are still a perfect wolf in my eyes.” The alpha hummed in agreement as he drew in a breath through his nostrils, “And by the God’s, you smell heavenly.”
Mary popped into the living room carrying a tray of hot chocolate followed by Sam carrying a plate of sliced up apple pie. She commented, ‘I know that both you boys will make both your mates happy.’ She placed the tray on the tea table, ‘Now come on. Let’s soothe the nerves via some hot chocolate and freshly baked pie.’
He found himself asking,
Dean said, “she’s waiting in the car, love”.
For now, they had to play along.
the City Council Of Lawrence were, and, by extension, it’s people. The only interesting thing that caught his eye as he passed the early morning dwellers in the local park, was how a teenaged boy was dusting off dirt from the shirt of his 5 or 6 year old brother.
, and, whenever they talked, she would notice Dean frowning as he sniffed the air, immediately taking a step back from Cas- it was there that she witnessed how Cas posture stiffened and he would look entirely crestfallen. The giveaway was when Dean would try his best to uplift the omegas spirits by cracking up some lame joke- just so Cas could smile- also going to the extent to mention
Dinner was hotdogs, hamburgers, corn dogs and apple pies. As they ate, they walked around visiting farm animals in a pen,  green houses and watching a pie eating contest. Dean even took him to game booths and won him a large squishy bee.
He showered well and was completely dead to the world, for the next couple of days. He was only woken up by his smiling mom to get him to eat and drink something before he was out like a light once more.
Dean just raised a brow at the alpha, repeating in curiosity, “Half Breed?”
Never had he thought that this would be one of the most difficult decisions in his entire existence; and that was to break things off with Balthazar. To be honest, everything was happening so fast, since Dean’s return.
Oh wait till he gets his hands on his alpha- he was going to hear a damn earful- and he better pray that that’s all he gets from him!
Of course, his attention was torn away from the blue jay, as Bal sucked on a particular pleasure spot on his neck, right under his ear, while thumbing at his hardened left nipple. The feel of the alphas hard cock brushing alongside his was the best feeling ever.
I hope you enjoy...
….later when your older. I shouldn’t have had dreams or thoughts of you while in my rut. It was wrong.” Dean huffed, “My dreams and thoughts should have been focused on Lisa….because, she is my girlfriend….and girlfriends and boyfriends do
Sammy hung up. He already missed his brother’s voice, but, at least he was calm and all good now.
“But I’m just getting to the good part, Sammy!” He teased his brother back.
- so that left his baby brother ‘Sammy’.
Daddy knelt down by his bedside, still not touching him. The way daddy seemed so calm and composed was impressive. Then again, his dad was an experienced alpha when it came to ruts and would most probably have it all figured out. Daddy gently spoke, “its ok son. You will get through this. Daddy will bring you a few things so that you can relieve yourself.”
He always hated these
Well, it was only a day!
Then, it gave a small whimper.
The guy clearly held himself much more lower than Jimmy-
That apple pie scent was ever so strong and captivating- it was damn hard to keep himself steady and calm, but he didn’t give in. He didn’t want to scare the omega. It was all up to Cas what he chose to reveal or not.
And damn did that send shivers down his spine.
Dean would watch the omega toying with his own hole, legs spread apart to give the alpha a view of his leaking cavern while he panted out, “Please Dean. I’m ready for your knot alpha! I can’t take it any longer!”
To be seen. To be acknowledged.
All Cas could say was ‘
and all (minus the sex toys he used on himself during his ruts).
Wait. What?
He smiled and continued cutting the sides of the ham and cheese sandwiches he had prepared for family lunch. He was just setting up the sandwiches on plates, when an unfamiliar scent caught his nose. One that was intermingled with his oldest child’s.
He remembered the pup whining baby wolf noises, trembling and curled up at his paws.
Of course, when he got on his bed, he pulled his knees to his chest, curved up into an almost perfect ball and sobbed quietly. His omega missed Dean.
John chuckled at his wife’s enthusiasm. “I’m sure our son will bring this special someone to the castle when he is ready to introduce him to us.”
And so they say the rest was history.
He knew he shouldn’t, but proceeded to peer in through a hole in the wall. What he saw broke his heart even further.
Yeah, he could do this!
Dean felt exactly the same. He kissed the top of his lovers sweaty dark hair, “This will never end, baby. We just have to be smart”.
Yeah Castiel bending down and pulling out a few weeds at the base of the sunflower plant was not of big help to his libido.
Both consumed in their heated desires that they had forgotten that he was sleeping not far away from their bed.
from the moment Cas started walking around in his human form- only to morph back into his wolf form when he was successfully snuggled into him.
He can’t look anymore. It was too painful to glance at. He walked away from the window, narrowing his eyes at Bobby, “I have half a mind to go outside and burn that piece of junk to a crisp, Bobby! Seriously!”
(See the end of the chapter for
She had had enough, her motherly nature kicking in, before she knew it, she was walking towards Chuck, then a loud sounding slap cracked through the air. She sneered at the alpha who was holding his stinging cheek, “HOW DARE YOU LAY A HAND ON ANY OMEGA, CHUCK! YOU ARE DESPICABLE AND ROTTEN TO THE VERY CORE! A WRETCHED ALPHA AND LEADER! HAVE YOU NO SHAME!” She could feel John and Sam lurking somewhere behind her, ready to prance if Chuck ever dared hurt her- a big IF that is, because Chuck Milton was nothing but a ninny!
Castiel was feeling hot and extremely unsettled. He was leaking like crazy from his hole and his cock refused to stay limp- erect, throbbing and red. This time he was in his bath water. He tried fingering himself and it felt so damn good, making him moan out loudly into the bath space. He tried jerking himself while working three fingers into his throbbing hole- it wasn’t long before his head fell back, crying out loud as he orgasmed hard. Yet, it still wasn’t enough.
John nodded and his green eyes shifted to someone nearby or behind him. The alpha’s handsome smile could light up the entire room as he called out a name that made him freeze on the spot, fear running through his veins. “Dean, my son! About time you showed.”
He had to blink twice at how beautiful and radiant she looked today in her crème colored dress and with her hair done up. Her eyes sparkled with such joy as she smiled so sweetly at him. His eyes left hers and slowly had a sweep around.
Enjoy! And thanks for your kudos and comments!🙂

Well, the older a wolf grew, the more hostility he would develop towards his own pack if without a mate to center him. It was wired into every wolfs genes. Weirdly so!
cabin. Bless his heart!
Cas shifted closer to his side, pressing his side into Deans. It was a sign of
Bobby got up from the dining table and clapped him one on the shoulder. The man said in between laughs, “It’s good to have that spit fire attitude back boy! This place needs it!”
Question is-
Castiel knew he had to keep his cool, otherwise the omega would be doomed under another slave traders hands. He held in his temper and walked up to the bodyguard, “Give him to me. I’ll carry him to the vehicle”.
“Do you genuinely want me to, Dean?”
Yup, the nickname stuck and never grew old. Castiel would only allow Gabriel to call him that.
Castiel giggled.
He slipped into the night, heading towards the dark alleys of the city. He was going to come back with Castiel- through force or voluntary will of Castiel.
Dean commented, “Now that’s the smile I was aiming for. Much better!”
Cas’ fluffy white tail wagged in the air. The little omega crawled, on his freaking belly-
He sighed. Yeah. Choose wisely.
Gabe blew out a breath and rubbed a hand down his face, “Well, I can sense trouble up ahead, Cassie. You need to be careful, lest you’re discovered and punished. Or worse, end up getting a death sentence for consorting with an animal. You remember what Elder Viktor did to his daughter, Sonya?”
Cas suddenly looks shy, taking a bold step towards him. He could feel that invisible magnetic force strong between them now, trying to pull them together. Castiel pressed the stuffed bee into his chest- lodging it between them, blue eyes meeting his neck, as if studying something there. The man whispered, “It definitely is you that makes it so beautiful here”.
Charlie listened intently. She gushed, “Oh he said your eyes were like the blues of the Pacific Ocean and he gave you a nickname too!” Her hands were pressed to her chest. “Oh he’s a charmer”.
Dean could see the tiredness on his mates face. Castiel was starting to be forgetful, snappy and emotional. Well, much more than usual. The alpha couldn’t believe that he and Cas had to live in their own house with an enemy.
The only words he could utter truthfully was, “A lot.” He then added, “you may want to take a seat first, Ellen.”
“He loves you, Cas. I know he does, much more than you think.”
Dean couldn’t help but moan deliciously around the omegas hole. Cas tasted so good. Too good. It was addictive. He speared his tongue into Cas, sucking around his hole and growling into the cavern as he grew hungry and greedy for the taste. Cas was squirming madly above him, crying out into the empty barn, keening and moaning until finally after several more seconds the omegas hole clenched around Dean’s tongue, releasing wave after wave of omega juices. Dean drank the omega up like he were some expensive liquor, loving the way his omegas juices flowed down his chin.
He already had an idea, based on the unmistakable scents of arousal permeating the air, just outside Cas bedroom, however, he wanted to believe that maybe he was overthinking things.
His attention was drawn to his friends, taking a long sip of his beer, before he shrugged, “I just…I needed to get my head right…is all guys. I’m sorry if y’all only heard from me over the phone”. He clicked his tongue, raising his beer bottle before him, “but hey, I’m here now!”
Sam’s big brother, Dean, was super charming too. The alpha looked wise in his years: spotting more defined crow’s feet on the corner of his eyes, a gentle sort of nature- though lesser than Sam’s, and spoke very sensibly and with respect.
Let we know what you think is happening between these two lovebirds!😉
He could smell his oldest pups scent, getting stronger.
His fascination soon changed into deep seated heartache and longing. He yearned to be one of those omegas down there, flaunting themselves at any handsome alphas. He yearned to feel the excitement that would brew when an alphas eyes were hooked on him, seizing him up as a potential mate.
Dean swallowed before he responded, “I want my mate to come live with us in the castle. We cannot be away from each other any more.”
The death dealers dispersed.
He wasn’t going to ever let his papa go.
He just needed space from everyone.
. He shouldn't panic.
Dean was calling his name, Gabe was calling his name. His trepidation began to slowly fizzle away, instead anger and irritation  began to bubble within him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re welcome, son.”
And as they locked gazes; he saw the same hunger he felt rattling around in lower tummy and groin. He felt wetness leak out of him and his heart was thumping hard against his ribcage. They were both trying to keep their breathing in check- as want and eagerness flooded their beings.
His eyes drifted to the rear view mirror. He could see their parents truck several meters behind them. He felt his heart relax some, thankful that his parents were accompanying Sammy and he to meet their mates, as well as, escorting them back.
There was a breaking of twigs and crunching of leaves nearby - too many. Dean was suddenly on his guard, standing just ahead of him, snarling at whoever it was.
He felt his heart squeeze tight, “I wish I could Gabe, but, I am not permitted to by our pack alpha. He has made his orders clear.”
For the first time since they started this conversation, he saw Deans eyes light up, along with that genuine nice looking smile. Dean spoke with what he would like to term as fondness, replying, “Thank you, Cas. Your reassurance and forgiveness means the world to me.”
As if reading Dean’s mind, Cas guided Dean’s hands down his body till he was gripping that omega ass. He moaned as Dean squeezed those globes, pulling away from Dean’s hungry kisses with a wet pop. He whispered against Dean’s swollen wet lips, “I’m ready for your cock Dean. Make me cum on it.”
John boredly asked, “So, you had sex with some random vampire?”
Dean was still dizzy from that air sucking kiss, only managing to murmur out, “yeah". He smiled as he watched his lover open a window and jumped out.
. Lucian had been hiding for hundreds of years. Family lineage was passed on and lycan sons that were fathered by Lucian, under the Winchester name, ruled and took care of the lycans.
Then he heard Dean’s voice in his head. Warm and caring.
He met Dean’s eyes, feeling over the moon right now.
Anna was still obnoxious, bitchy and rude. She still threw her weight here and there, trying to coax or lure Dean into her trap. It’s like the warning Cas had given her, had fallen on deaf ears.
Heather’s tears ran down her snout. She shook her head, eyes flicking over to meet his.
Castiel felt his heart thrum in adoration for his alpha. He leaned into Dean’s huge wolf form. For the first time, Castiel felt that all else that had happened before this day was mute and invalid. All the heartache, pain and disappointing times between Dean and he was nothing but a memory. He found himself saying,
Hehe. I'm sure many of my readers know that I don't like hovering too much on pain. I love our boys!
He knew that he shouldn’t poke his nose anywhere it wasn’t wanted. He would only end up hurting himself if he did. But, it’s like he couldn't help himself whenever he knew that Dean was here. So, when prince Dean came visiting, he would sneak out of the shed that he and his parents occupied- in the middle of the night.
His mind traveling back to his familiar dream of opening Jimmy’s room door to get him awake and ready for their graduation ceremony. The lifeless, pale corpse of his brother would be the only sight that greeted him.
Gabe saw the seriousness of the situation and without wasting time escorted him out on light feet.
Gabriel winked, “Yup!”
It seemed the alpha also got distracted the closer he approached. The alpha suddenly stopped talking, lifting his nose up into the air and sniffing not so subtly. The alpha picked up his scent, his scent was probably interesting and appealing to the tall alpha. Then, suddenly those hazel eyes found his…and boy oh boy did the world feel like it had stopped spinning, that time had come to a standstill.
I hope you enjoy the chapter.
His eyes shot up to meet Dean’s searching ones. He shouldn’t probe any further or he might just hear something he doesn’t like. But, his curiosity got the better of him. He asked in an almost barely there voice, “How so?”
He tilted his head, “How did you know that red roses were my favorite?”
’ for Charlie.
He just put his head down and walked on by. If he was lucky, his tormentor would leave him alone, but if he wasn’t, he would get one hell of a shove into the lockers before his bag was ripped open and it’s contents emptied unto the floor of the schools hallway.
They were all seated on the sofa’s in the living room (Dean and him on one & Mary and John on another).  Mary and he were nursing their cups of hot chocolate, whilst, John and Dean had settled for a few beers.
He was never meant to be loved. A
“Am I not part of the pack seeing as I’m dating your son? Since your son and I are true mates and all that? Doesn’t our bond make me…and in this case, my brother, part of the pack?” Gabriel outed without any care who he was speaking to. “If this is the way outside wolves are being treated when they enter this pack, then I say you don’t deserve them.”
Too late. Damage done.
And, lo behold, dad did come bounding in, looking all concerned. Dad’s nose scrunched as he took in the heavy scent of alpha pheromones and sex in the air. His dad didn’t touch him, neither did he say anything- when he couldn’t help himself and started rutting into the mattress below to relieve himself. His tears were running down his cheeks, crying out, “Dad, please, I can’t!”
