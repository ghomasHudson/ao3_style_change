Some time later, after he’d been to the loo, grabbed a flannel for himself and another for Sherlock, surreptitiously (and not a little giddily, despite trying to achieve some level of professional objectivity) checking Sherlock for any signs of damage, and wiped them down. Settling down on his back beside him, his fingers moved of their own accord, drawing faint crosses over Sherlock’s ribs, enjoying what, if he were in a writerly mood, he would let himself call the

The homeless man jerked into waking and yelled, attempting, disorientated, to escape the sharp sting of the impromptu wash on his open cut. Sherlock dug his fingers in sharply at the scalp.
As if stuck in a particularly stubborn temporal wrinkle, Sherlock returned to the exact spot on the pavement, feeling the same queasy undulation in his stomach. No, indeed – he had, quite accidentally, already discovered John’s dark humour had acquired a rather predictable lacuna roughly the size and shape of Sherlock’s bloodied doppelganger. His outburst on the second or third case after reinstatement – Lestrade’s reinstatement as well as his, he found himself satisfied to know –, that ‘Oh,

He untucked Sherlock’s shirt from his trousers to imprint his fingertips around Sherlock’s hips, and Sherlock groaned and grabbed for John’s mouth again because he had to. The electric shocks jolting his skin were going to send his heart into arrhythmia; he felt like the breath in his lungs (what little he could get, though he didn’t want it anyway) was burning him from the inside out, tendrils of hot liquid
He toes off his shoes and slides into bed behind Sherlock, wrapping his arms around him and nosing up to the nape of his neck.
“Just don’t scare me like anymore or in the future” Sherlock rest his head on your hand, “Promise me, that you’ll stay” he said before closing his eyes. You smiled, resting your hand other on his curly hair.
“Are you eliminating this person then?” Sherlock asks, you shook your head taking a piece of your dinner.
You cut him off from his babbling, “I don’t need to explain anything about—wait did you say you care about me?”
“I was out with a friend. He needs me to help with something. It was late and he told me to stay at his place” you did eventually come home, around five in the morning. Frank dropped you off made sure you were safe. It’s just the military in him.
“Agents, Hitmen and sociopath” Mary listed, smiling slightly
“Oh my goodness” John whispered running his hand through his hair
“I care about you, so does John, Mrs. Hudson, your friend Frank- which by the way, you owe me an explanation”
“[Name], now is not the time.” you nod slightly and walking inside pointing the gun at Mary.
“You know it’s not a bad idea to stay at Baker Street” Mycroft said as took a sip of his hot tea.
“I mean anyone can change right? Sure, Sherlock could be a little bit of a—“
You got to Mary’s flat and to your surprise; Mary got the idea why you were upset about.
“Fine,”
“Frank” you scold your partner giving out threats.
“But—“
“He offered us protection and to delete everything in the book for us, a chance to start over. I didn’t want to take it in the beginning but Frank thought we need an ally” he also asked you if you can keep an close watch on his little brother, you thought it was some kind of babysitting job but normal is what you need. Needed some change, “So, we work for Mycroft as agents and I guess Hitman for any emergency purposes, of course”
“John? What are you doing here?” John was startled by your voice and looking at you with confusion. He looks at Janine and back to you but he was unsure on what to say.
“John, is Sherlock with you?” John shook his head, trying to keep himself together
then all your memories seems to rush back to you, you remember how his eyes seem to shine when you walk in the room. The way he talks to you, and the way he acts around you, “Sherlock—what—what are you doing here?”
You made your way to the 221B with Frank behind you, slowly opening the door. You found Sherlock, John, Mary and Mrs. Hudson standing in the living room.
“[Name],” you heard with the deep, velvet voice.
“It was good, we’re going to get some Intel in the next two days” you said, taking a seat at the chair in front of Sherlock, since John moved out you decided to the chair for yourself. Sherlock passes the take out box to you before taking his usual spot at his chair.
“Nonsense! He just needs some time. He wouldn’t leave you like that—he loves you Mary,” you took a seat beside her, “It was a lot to take in, knowing that people you know, is well—“
“Nothing, just a lot of thinking!” you yelled at the living room, “I don’t even know why he changed like this all of a sudden. Just wanting a girlfriend the next day?” Something seems really off with Sherlock, he never gets this close to anyone. He was smiling, touching her and just being public about his relationship. It’s not the Sherlock Holmes that you know.
Sherlock was by your side not a minute later, putting his arm around your waist and leading you to the couch.
“It’s been a long day and you’re moving tomorrow” both you and Sherlock lay in your bed together.
You took a deep breath, “Agent 47, Frank Castle is an ex US Marine Captain into a hitman; he was at tour in Vietnam was he was set up and framed. His family was murdered in front of him” You remembered him at the park as he cried over his family. You found that he was set up and that his family was in danger but you got there too late.
Determined not to let either of them, or anyone, derail his attempt at a functional sibling interaction, he inhaled through his nose and counted to ten. ‘How’s… that, erm — your book club thing?’
‘Why don’t they just… well, kill him?’
‘You cannot expect me to believe—’
Sherlock slurred across the surface of his consciousness, voice dripping derisively, ‘If you can manage to emerge from the depths for a moment… I believe this would be an excellent opportunity to yield to your proposition. Lest you get impatient waiting any longer.’
‘And congratulations on his promotion to head of department.’
‘I’ll pop out and get something, then, yeah?’ he offered, hearing the forceful tension in his voice and resenting his own tangled feelings.
’ — and it clicked, while suddenly, if distantly, it occurred to him that John was going to be livid —
‘Why?’
After pacing around the square, which, as ever, afforded him space and breeze-refreshed air and anonymity, he decided to walk it off in the direction of home. The more he thought about it — thank
Planting in front of the empty grate, looking hard at the mantle with Sherlock’s magpie-like collection of oddities and contraband solid objects, with the thick orange and violet city light streaming in like a flood, staining the floor and walls with familiar colours, he tried not to decide whether he was more furious with all of them, or himself. It was a close call.

He blustered out some reply, the things he told himself when he lay awake wondering what was wrong with him. When he’d got like this. If he was better off with his gun and no one else.
‘I can’t believe you, sometimes,’ John had admitted, whirlpool-blue-brown eyes squinting in the now-unguarded sunlight. His thumb had gone on caressing Sherlock’s palm from beneath, and Sherlock had shivered with the — the
John was sitting back in one of the partners’ chairs, arms across his chest. His belly jumped as he snorted. ‘He’d notice, Sherlock.’
She gushed with cool laughter at that. ‘And so I shouldn’t be surprised not to see a ring on your finger.’
‘Just so long as it’s not you under the bus, I’m not actually all that bothered about that.’
, for it to linger as if it weren’t the case, as if Sherlock were the only one with failings here. ‘Sherlock, I’ve lied to you, too.’ (The tomato soup; Irene Adler, ages ago now…) ‘But I lied to myself for too long about… about this. What we could – become. I don’t need all of that stuff you just said. I know you think I do,’ he hurried to say, while Sherlock huffed disbelievingly, ‘but I’m here to tell you, I don’t. And I can tell you, if it changes.’

Sherlock flops sideways onto his side of the bed, grabbing a hand-towel in the darkness and cleaning them both, limbs ganglier than usual as his muscles succumb to pliant hormones. ‘Don’t flatter yourself, John, you could have lasted twice that long if you weren’t so tired.’
, John wanted to say, possibly with a hard kick to Sherlock’s shins, but he remained still.
… My sister, she – help me, god, please!’ He buried his face in his hands again and sobbed, shuddering and loud. The pitiful sound grated on Sherlock’s skin, crawling along his upper spine and lower ribs and forehead.
They sat there for a moment. John didn’t know if she was waiting for him to get up first, or just wanted to work in the kitchen for a bit. On balance, he hedged, ’Time to get back to work, I guess. If you’re finished.’
With a pinched look, Sherlock peered condescendingly through his fringe at John. Bradstreet stopped mid-sentence several steps below.
Again, John was sure — well, he’d have to wait until they were alone so he could confer with Sherlock — but his instinct told him that there was something, if possible, worse, and it was to do with her knowing about the ‘notes’ in question.
That wasn’t what he had meant to say, but he was apparently in no control of his rough voice, nor his face. Whatever his muscles were doing, though, seemed to satisfy — or at least subdue — John’s surge of emotions. John nodded, once.

He sighed with a relief he hadn’t been aware he’d been hoping for. (The depth and breadth of John’s forgiveness and patience had yet to be plumbed (like so many things Sherlock was still learning about him). Added to which, Sherlock did so enjoy the slightly handsier side of a tipsy John.)
. Sherlock had filed that away for a more adventurous afternoon.
Wiping her cheeks one last time and then rubbing her hands on her thighs as if to warm herself, Suze got to her feet — she was shorter than either of them — and came round to stand by the door. They both went to shake her hand, neither of them (John knew) giving a damn if it was clammy or flakey or covered in thick mascara.
Which was precisely the reason they were up here, approximately 442 miles from home or anywhere with sensible mobile phone service, in boots that made their feet ache and not another human life form visible. Thankfully neither of them was, as yet, planning to kill the other, though the setting made such a scheme all too easy.
Such snark would have been very annoying if not for three simple facts: first, Sherlock was usually like this; second, his voice was still sleep-crusted and thick, which John always enjoyed; and third, the tug of the bedsheet around Sherlock as he jostled about, scooping a nearly criminal amount of dark roast grounds per volume of water, meant that the faint sliver of a birthmark directly below the nape of his neck was exposed. More visible once John put his laptop aside and went to put the kettle on for himself.

‘I thought you had the afternoon off?’
‘Even in a disguise, I believe it would end… badly.’ (Most of his disguises required full mobility and lung capacity, neither of which he had entirely regained just yet, to say nothing of what John would say about allowing Sherlock to impersonate a character fully eight inches shorter. No: a disguise was, regrettably, not currently possible.

,’ he insisted on a sigh, relief rushing through him and dousing him afresh with fondness. He let his hands tug, almost magnetically, on Sherlock’s hips until they were touching and he could smile into Sherlock’s mouth.
For himself, Damery was balding (hair formerly dark mahogany) and clean-shaven; 5’9” though he seemed slightly shorter due to approximately five years of significant bone density loss, and for having spent the majority of his life inclining his head for one reason or another. (His wife, almost certainly minor nobility (inherited cufflinks, not Irish), was an inch taller (before heels).) Clothes: meticulous, current without being ‘edgy’ or absurd (a lavender pocket handkerchief; a charcoal silk necktie) yet assiduously well-kept (his regularly de-scuffed shoes); a man, then, who slept well at night and rose early to perform his life’s duty, to play the role he had been assigned and do so with dignity. The pin on his inner lapel spoke of his seniority within the Carlton Club, his private political leanings, his feelings about Irish Home Rule, his literary taste, and (considering the usual fat-heavy fare at such institutional meals) his cholesterol. He had worn glasses (a nondescript style that would be acceptable for another few years) for the whole of his adult life, which added to his overall impression of being reliable, likable, personally disinterested and, most important of all, discreet.
‘It’s in all of them,’ John pitched in, apparently understanding Sherlock’s fumbling (he’d creased the page! Thank god there was another copy). ‘I wanted it to be in all of them.’
‘I thought it might be a removed tattoo.’
And then John had left him, while Sherlock was still asleep. Now John was sitting, hunched and nearly dragged back to the floor by that familiar, detested weight around his neck, clinging to the lifeline that was Sherlock’s just-barely-warm hand.
, he thought to himself.
And oof: the next chapter is also going to be a belter.
Once he’d finished, he saved it to his ‘Drafts’ folder to look over later, not sure what else he needed, or if it sounded stiff or absurd. He felt like his focus was elsewhere.
of touching Sherlock softly while loving him so much he couldn’t breathe.
Straining slightly to reach the Grey Poupon at the back of the cupboard (John preferred yellow, like a builder or football enthusiast,
For a moment, as he observed John glaring at the long black bag, he considered the possibility that John would refuse to go.  Perhaps he truly had crossed some critical line, either last night or with this (rented, but certainly good quality) presumption, and now John was already subconsciously disentangling himself from their current arrangement. He’d scarcely let himself imagine things getting even this far.
? Annoyance? Pain? something John couldn’t read dashed across Sherlock’s face.
‘Christ,’ John gulped. Melting back. Languorous. Even his eyes, closed, curved up along with his mouth as he sighed minutely (almost weak: ‘bowled over’, he might have described it. Or ‘well-shagged’).
, not exactly a Mongol horde, of the most imbecilic oafs one could hope to find, one more worried about his hangover than manning the gatehouse, the other so arthritic and lumbering that even the poorest burglar would be able to hear him coming a mile off.’
When he dropped back beside John, the Baron’s fingers were shaking minutely mere inches away from his ruined, once-elegant upturned face. Another smell he would sooner never taste again: the scent-flavour of flayed, iron-drenched skin.
Sitting firmly by John’s feet, he had spoken in a moderate, commanding voice, ‘John,
Sherlock met John’s eyes briefly, but John looked away. His frustration resurfaced anew, gripping his neck like a physical hold. Sherlock’s sneer, and now these theatrics. This magic trick was an indulgence, at best, while back in Kent, Mrs St Clair sat wondering if today was the day she would have to identify her husband’s lifeless body. Whatever Sherlock had planned, John was tired of it; they needed to find Neville, or his body, and soon.
Sherlock’s hot breath gulped and gasped, his nose dug into John’s shoulder. John could imagine the riots of sweat-drenched curls, matted to Sherlock’s forehead where it was sticking to the nape of John’s sweat-clammy neck, tickling his skin with each cant of Sherlock’s hips —
Happy Valentine's Day! Apologies that this chapter can't be the romantic fluff we all deserve today. Later, perhaps...
‘Ta very much for the head’s up, Mycroft.’ He nodded (old habits: a gesture of (
After a silent second, they both burst out laughing, a rumbling jollity that shook their chests.
‘Oh honestly!’ Mrs. Hudson exclaimed. ‘It isn’t all that bad!’ When the parrot had concluded her noise and went back to sporadic peeps, Mrs. Hudson made to leave, patting John’s arm as she went. She did a lot of patting. ‘Do let me know what you decide about the bird, won’t you?’
For along moment, Sherlock was silent, and John’s stomach clenched around a flare of wariness: what was there even left to upset him tonight?
He whirled on his heel, leaving John to stare angrily at the police officers for an extra second. ‘No hard feelings,’ Peterson chimed, with a malicious smile, and John was tempted to remind her that he too had a criminal record. Instead he shook his head and followed Sherlock out.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a stab in his gut he suddenly wanted everything — ‘some’ was nowhere near enough, he didn’t know where he’d been drawing his restraint from, but it was well and truly gone now. He had felt shameful and ill at Harry’s words, not just because they were so unbelievably unfair from
Which meant: time for a check in with the other side of the tracks.
‘Last chance before I’m off,’ he murmured, nudging Sherlock’s cheek. ‘I really don’t mind…’
‘I would have thought this particular folly had been concluded long ago,’ Mycroft wondered haughtily, studying his customary umbrella like an absurd anachronism of a Dickensian walking stick. (All that was missing were sheepskin gloves and a powdered wig and he would have been indistinguishable from an exhibit in the V&A: “Victorian windbag”, the label would read. Sherlock smirked.) ‘Perhaps I should prepare his lordship for disappointment.’ He rose, and not a moment too soon.
After another few hours of skimming through the various books looking for any mentions of secret cupboards, hidden backs to antique picture frames, miniature stamps or rings or anything that could be rolled out and printed as needed, John couldn’t quite keep his focus much longer. He stood up with a embarrassingly middle-aged grunt, cracking his back and muscles as he stretched upward. As he bent back to collect the now-cooled food, he found Sherlock looking up at him.
But he wasn’t up to explaining all that just now, to Molly, to… to anyone, if he could help it.
Eventually he went about stirring the beans on the hob while informing Molly, ‘Help yourself to any of this lot, obviously. Or if you’d prefer to play it safe, the cafe downstairs opens at seven.’
‘So just because she’s still walking and talking, you think Gruener’s not as dangerous?’ He eyed Sherlock, because this was very much the problem Sherlock had: he liked drama, loved showing just how clever he was by daring death up against a ticking time bomb — and the thing he somehow
‘I understand if…’ Sherlock swallowed thickly, and John watched him from beneath heavy eyelashes. ‘I can appreciate that this is no longer sufficient. Needless to say, you can have a great deal more from someone else, as we have always known, so if you would prefer to end our current situation, we can… go back. To the previous arrangement.’

He nodded.
Her face soured with pity, disgust, disappointment, who could tell? — a muddle of negative emotions too entangled for him to make any stick — and she took a step backwards from him.

Just as he was about to finish his cuppa at mid-morning, his phone buzzed sharply. No one was in the break room to comment on the fact that he was already holding his mobile before it lit up.
‘UGH!’ His hands dug reflexively into eyesockets, a common gesture of aggravation which John exercised frequently. (John’s hands – later, when they had solved the case(s), Sherlock could easily devote at least an hour to the minutiae of John’s incredibly expressive hands.)
Sherlock constantly forces me to invent new words, or reanimate old ones.
‘And you will remain closed for seven to fourteen years, Mr Ramani, unless you cooperate with us.’
‘Eating foods rich in sugars and carbohydrates creates a spike in metabolism which ultimately leads to lethargy at inconvenient times, such as, to pick two random possibilities, running after suspects or surveilling criminals during three-hour operas.’
‘Of course you can,’ Sherlock argued stubbornly. ‘You’ve slept in active warzones.’
‘Greg? What’s happened?’
Several moments went by, and it was not until Sherlock had evidently felt the ebb of smarting discomfort that John dared squeezed his hand questioningly. Sherlock loosened his grip slightly and allowed his thumb to stroke the arch of John’s palm.
‘Doubt it,’ replied John, both because, well, he did, and because his scepticism sometimes was enough to dissuade Sherlock from a dead-end. ‘It’d always be getting ripped or greasy from fingers. And anyway, he doesn’t seem like the type that would want to have newspaper ink all over him.’
Was that a genuine question? Sherlock was standing here, making an effort to convince John, not because it was necessary: but deep down, John wanted to do this, as much as Sherlock did. And Sherlock wanted him with him (how could John be so obtuse as to believe otherwise). ‘Barring complications, that is very much
Though he refused to take another step back, his eventual sigh felt like a retreat. ‘I have work in the morning.’
At some point, Kate (whose name John had helpfully supplied) returned with their drinks, then scooted gamely into the bench, taking with her the irksome football fanatic, the nurse, and the technician, who all clustered into the 90* angle of the bench and made swift work of an asinine, prurient game involving other people in sight.
‘If it helps,’ Sherlock offered, inclining his head slightly to one of the less hearing-damaged of Billy’s saucer-sized ears as nonchalantly as possible, ‘my present client is attempting to bring
‘Right, sorry, hello,’ he got to his feet, never quite standing all the way up, ‘sorry, I didn’t know we were expecting anyone.’
‘“All right” what?’ he said, gracelessly. His shirt felt starch-stiff across his back, sticking to his skin, ill-fitting.
John considered having a word with Sherlock about interrupting when, clearly, some clients would actually open up better if they didn’t feel like they were being hurried along, but Suze was already moving on.
of mornings (hell, lots of nights too) waking up to an otherwise empty bed. But the thing that was making him want to crawl on top of the duvet beside Sherlock, leave the food and the case and the world outside to Molly and everyone else, was the sense that
, since the beginning: since the cabbie, since the pool, at Baskerville, at Bart’s, at every other fucked-up, upside-down Russian roulette fiasco they somehow found themselves facing, Sherlock believed in John. And yet Sherlock was afraid of losing him, just as much as John was afraid of losing Sherlock again — of driving him away.
John’s head snapped up. Sherlock glanced at John’s mouth so quickly he almost missed it, before returning his gaze. John swallowed again.
‘Read it to me, then,’ he commanded imperiously. ‘The portion of this essay you found so remarkably praiseworthy.’
Sherlock downgraded Sgt. Challa’s level of peril to merely moderate. ‘She

of the message flying from his hand straight (well, to a signal tower, conglomeration of satellites, second tower, and then straight) to John’s hand was intoxicating. And infuriating.
No one, in his entire life, had ever fundamentally, unwaveringly believed in him the way Sherlock did. The way Sherlock
On a sudden impulse, John folded his hand gently over Sherlock’s right fist where it was seized on itself, planted beside his ear as though he was holding an old wheel-dial telephone receiver. Immediately on John laying his own hand over him, however, Sherlock unlocked his fingers, tugging on John’s to interleave with his. (Additionally, he realised, this position brought not only John’s arm but his entire body down to lie closer to Sherlock’s, wrapped over him like a fire blanket attempting to smother a flame.) He held tight, pushed a fraction back, then a little bit deeper, and tried to breathe through his nose.
Without acknowledging this, Sherlock mused, ‘Was your gunshot wound recovery boring too?’

else.
Just as the teacher stopped and began to bark at one or the other of the duo, another teacher – a javelin thrower of a woman in a grey button-up with the same crest on the front as the man, carrying an oversized umbrella – interrupted him. A brief conference had the children tittering hopefully. The man nodded and, as the matriarch stomped away, blew his whistle. A few children cheered as they all followed off the grass.
John’s mouth was warm and amused, tasting of that last beer (ah, so they had run out of the ale, then) and — the second kiss clinched it — chips (more oil and vinegar this time: out in a hurry, not long enough in the fryer, too many customers, kitchen understaffed) and John. Sherlock inhaled the entire kiss until he was sure there were no sensations left unregistered, then drew back.
‘I’m not going to
‘Miss Winter is, as you can no doubt hear, John, a fellow Essex native.’
And with that, and an involuntary (unconscious) sigh, John’s lopsided grin disappeared out of the flat.
Many a true word said in jest, his Nan had intoned more than once throughout his childhood. Even so, he went back to his desk with a freshened cup of tea, chest a little lighter with the feeling that, if he couldn’t be with Sherlock for this one venture (and dear Christ, they spent an ungodly amount of their time together as it was!), at least he didn’t have to sit around pretending not to wonder what Sherlock was up to.
(See the end of the chapter for
What was ‘sailor’ — oh.
With a jerk, he awoke.
a four-years gone version of himself asked, during a similarly ominous row.)
‘That is not hygienic,’ said John, re-entering the room. (His lip was downturned in a firm, thin line, not very but crucially different from the solemn, risk-assessing ridge of a moment earlier. Sherlock attempted to read his expression – angry, but determined – was he upset by Challa’s interruption or Sherlock’s entertaining of the case at this inopportune moment? His body language was mixed and therefore perplexing.)
‘I’m always awake first.’

, remove his mouth from Sherlock’s skin now that he had tasted it. He panted, resting his cheek against Sherlock’s jaw, and felt his stomach flip with shame. After a minute he slowly sat back and, with conscious effort, released his grip.
— No doubt Sherlock would find the kinkiest, weirdest (and most expensive) lube — Who was he kidding, there’d be gay sex toys from the darkest, most sordid corner of the web, stuff he wouldn’t even know how to use.

, if he remembered correctly) (he did) – with what was almost certainly affection. Or appraisal. (It was sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two.) ‘His wings have been clipped, I think, so he was just sort of hopping along and chattering, trying to find some shelter from the rain.’
‘Sergeant Challa must have clocked off early,’ he cut in smoothly. ‘Mrs. Hudson will have let her in before going to tea with Mrs. Evans.’ Sherlock strode over to the desk, apparently to put his pen back in the drawer on his side, but (John saw) his fingers traced lingeringly over a scuff where the cage had been.
‘God, you look…’ John’s left hand released the bedsheet and went to Sherlock’s neck to pull him up to John’s mouth. When Sherlock obliged, John wrapped his feet around the backs of Sherlock’s thighs and pushed him forward, sending his cock to grate against John’s through his clothes, making them both gasp. ‘Take those off,’ John instructed or begged, he had no idea which, his mouth too full of the taste of himself plus Sherlock on Sherlock’s tongue, a combination which was strange and unbelievably arousing and new. Sherlock immediately lifted his hips and performed some kind of balancing act John could not process just now, but sighed with relief to see had had the desired result. His own hand wrapped immediately around Sherlock’s unobstructed prick.

‘And I’m very,
Mrs. Hudson laughed again and looked at John with indulgent disbelief, then back at Sherlock. ‘Your mother has a lot to answer for.’
‘You do have a perfect arse,’ he commented, laying one slick and one dry hand on each cheek, respectively, relishing the shivers that radiated from the contact. ‘Fit for royalty. No wonder the Queen’s butler didn’t throw us out.’
‘Take a taxi to the hotel. It looks like rain and I doubt Lady Morcar would appreciate you dripping on her carpet.’
With a robust squeeze of Sherlock’s thigh, John’s expression became a very subtle, conspiratorial smirk. ‘Thanks. For coming. I know it’s not…’ He shrugged, then looked at Sherlock’s now-melted muddle of ice cubes. Just then, a cheer went up — someone had scored, or not scored, or passed out, or wet themselves, or something equally puerile.
‘Sorry if I woke you,’ grumbled Molly in a surprisingly gruff voice, where she was leaning heavily against the worktop with eyes half-shut.

‘Death comes even to the young,’ Gruener purred, with lascivious awe, taking a few steps closer to stand by Sherlock’s side, admiring. ‘Even to young lovers.

‘Thank you!’ Challa was saying, a little gushingly, as she drew her phone from her pocket and began to dial. ‘And if you can’t find him – Baker, first initial H. on the receipt, I’ll leave that with you – I’m happy to keep her myself! I just – well thanks!’
John’s eyebrows shot up. ‘She knew you? What, as… as more than just the guy in the hat, you mean?’
Mid-afternoon, weekday (judging by the slightly reduced number of passers-by on the stairs and all right he had glanced at the newspaper), early enough for a tea break — and phoning John —
,’ with such heartbreaking sorrow that Sherlock had all but leapt toward him.
John would come home, and then Sherlock would explain – explain that he wasn’t like Neville St Clair.
'Men love to tell me that I don't want to be "one of those girls". Then they congratulate me that in fact "I'm not like other girls" — because I am not. I am not some rash, naive schoolgirl. And I neither wish nor require some man who's just come in off the street to patronise me and tell me he knows better than I do how to run my life.'
The sound of their accelerating blood became the only important thing left in the room. Sherlock’s pupils swelled slowly to push his irises (tonight the colour of seaweed) outward. Warm and nocturnal, bright-sharp with possibility: perfect.
In other news: sorry this chapter is nearly late. It's another one that's been mostly written in this form since the beginning. But I had jury service today (during which, among other stray thoughts, it occurred to me that Mycroft would consider it the HEIGHT of

‘Or, I could fuck you across the bed.’
, in a way that John was sure he was unique to experience. He knew Sherlock’s libido was fickle, perhaps more ungovernable than his mind, but
— and yet John made a noise of approval and set down the remote.
Somewhat hurriedly, Sherlock went to the floor and retrieved his erratically-used box of cleaning agents from under his bed, selecting an odourless, near-industrial-strength sanitiser and an ordinary cotton cloth. His hands removed mechanically his (soiled) clothing, placing the various articles in their proper receptacles for washing or dry cleaning. His mind, offline for the better part of the last half-hour in which he had almost certainly ruined his and John’s relationship, was roaring back to life.
Mycroft’s pursed frown was as delightful as anticipated: coarseness always did make him sour-faced.
John jumped straight into waking to discover several things: first, that it was dawn; second, that (miraculously) Sherlock was still in bed with him, tucked forcefully into John’s armpit; and third, that the light in the loo was on, while faintly the sound of someone brushing their teeth

that only placed him a matter of inches (approx. 20* anti-clockwise) closer to Sherlock. His hands spasmed, clenched.

) over the kitchen door. (There would be a minute scrape near the top panel where the hook was now digging into the paint.)
‘Utterly,’ Sherlock snapped. No one’s legs were going to be shattered in an accident, no one was going to end up drowning, and if Gruener thought Sherlock was still tempted by the siren song of the drugs — well, he could go on thinking it. Perhaps it would be a useful misdirection. (Must consider that at a later date. (John wouldn’t be pleased, even if it

Well, he supposed that answered his questions. And, really, despite a ripple of resentment, he couldn’t actually blame her: this was, objectively, a foolish thing they were trying to do. It was just as likely to succeed as blow up in their faces. And Molly didn’t
‘And she didn’t have, I dunno, any alarms or anything on it?’ John asked the sergeant.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sounding almost impatient at being spoken to for the first time since being told to
As ever, people fell for the misconception — one of the main reasons why John’s blog was so (surprisingly) useful — that Sherlock cared one iota for his ‘reputation’. Nevertheless, he cared for his legs (for John’s legs), which was also part of Gruener’s message.
(God, he hated writing formal letters. It made him feel like he was at school.)
), really, considering how many things he might have done with his life to make it better for others rather than simply passed the time so destructively for himself.
The man (recreational drug user, non-(cigarette)smoker) chuckled. ‘Yeah, I know, mate. Well, if you need to stretch your legs and that, go ahead. Can’t see you when the lights are on in there and it’s as dark as this out here.’
(The pang of fear that had stayed with him had not been that AGRA would turn up to kill either him or John, but rather that John would miss Mary Morstan — that there were things he needed or wanted from his life that Sherlock couldn’t or didn’t know how to provide. And when John hadn’t appeared to do so, Sherlock had been all too ready not to look that gift horse in the mouth.)
John’s jaw was clenched shut, and he waited, evaluating Sherlock carefully. Then: ‘You’re saying you’ll… keep me in the loop? Properly in the loop?’
want.’
‘That’s not terribly surprising, is it?’ John asked in his impatient, surely-you-are-not-so-dense-as-to-contradict-the-reasonable-thing-I’ve-just-said voice. ‘Lots of patients lose their memory of a traumatic injury.’
Some part of his brain was transfixed: suddenly watching Sherlock ram himself down sharply onto John’s fingers, groaning furiously like he did when they ran up against a roadblock in a case, and the low swipes of arousal tipped John over the edge, feeling like his brain was swimming in honey, warm and tractionless. Even in his most vivid daydreams, even when once, last year (on Sherlock’s birthday) — following that visit from Lestrade, providing him with the worst birthday gift he’d ever received, hating and craving it, and ending up absolutely
Though his eyes remained closed, Sherlock said, ‘Wake you up?’
‘Yes, I think you have a point,’ Sherlock confirmed solemnly.
‘It’s all well and clever having a Mind Palace, but you’ve only fifteen seconds, maximum, of full consciousness left to use it. So, come on – what’s going to kill you first?’
Sherlock was hanging his jacket and replacing it with the one he tended to wear when he expected trouble: hand-to-hand trouble.
Now, though, a full REM cycle and the escalating temperature under the duvet was making him feel almost dull witted. ’Mmm.’
Until then, hope you're all well. x
went straight to his libido. Christopher was noisy and nonverbal and too off his head to protest the lack of condom, and John was in a mood to set things on fire. When he came in John’s mouth, Christopher moaned loud enough to drown out the muted sounded of next door’s telly blaring the nightly news.
‘Mmm,’ Molly allowed. ‘And it’s not, well… not microscope slides or anything fragile like that: not exactly sexy to make the person you’re trying to sleep with stare into a microscope.’ (John took a moment to admit to himself that the image of Sherlock hunched over a microscope, dexterous hands wheeling the lenses about, absurd skin illuminated by the light underneath the platform, did plenty for him. But he took her point.) ‘And not pixels hidden in larger images, like some sort of…’
He opened his eyes.
caught their attention: the parrot, it seemed, was trying to attract Sgt. Challa’s attention and had in the attempt all but fallen to the floor of her cage.
As usual, no one could match the high bar set by a certain otherwise-occupied doctor/soldier who was probably being fleeced for cash by his sole, selfish sibling.
But something was nagging, something further,
Not waiting for Sherlock to produce his phone, John turned to the man squirming like a maggot and moaning incoherently on the floor, squatting and looking beneath the trembling hands to see the curdled, corroded skin, poppy-bright with slithers of wet where the acid – or whichever solution she had used – had burned straight through the skin. (It would, he noted logically, make a good (if malodorous) experiment.)
Firstly: all credit for the Stanhope goes to
She placed her napkin over her plate and smiled, which was, it seemed, their cue to go. Sherlock was already getting to his feet, and, with a nod of thanks, made his way directly for the lift. A little annoyed, John quickly shook Lady Morcar’s hand (her eyes were full of enjoyment at Sherlock’s rather tactless getaway) and said goodbye.
. His hips against Sherlock’s arse, his hands cradling Sherlock’s hands. That, and a kiss that could scorch the roof off a rocket, was all he ever needed again.
— He’d stumbled across the diagnosis (a disorder: a condition) years ago, possibly when he was in the final stages of dissolving his ties with Victor, wondering dimly if this confirmed what he had always implicitly assumed: that he didn’t feel things the same way as other people; that their cues were impenetrable to him, and their insistence on social patterns of behaviour when so clearly that was an
(a marvel of secrecy he had not credited them with being able to maintain). It had ended in a flying manhunt down the Thames, culminating Sherlock commandeering a vessel, upon which two bearded sailors had, recognising him, asked, ‘Arren’ you Sherlough Holmes, the detective?’ To which he had, even with the adrenalin and beer rioting in his brain, had the elated wherewithal to reply, ‘No: the pirate.’ It had been, quite possibly, the best night of his life.)
Evidently she appreciated all he could (or couldn’t) pack in to this simple statement, and set the cup down on the nightstand, jostling around him in the small, overcrowded room to give him the chair. The cushion had been worn down over the years to a flat, thin bit of faded, brick-coloured wool, all the stuffing gone lifeless with use.
Anne was sitting in the armchair, evidently enjoying her pastry. She pointed with a pinky and a grunt at the mug of tea on the dresser. Then she set her danish down on a plate, like a civilised person, while John leaned on the furniture and drank deep. After he’d finished his (second) croissant, Anne looked at him heavily.
‘Bad day?’
A few minutes later, untucking the trapped collar of his jacket, he looked at the pair of them, quietly retreated already into their own worlds — Molly with her feet tucked under her, a notepad on her lap and two large books sprawled open around her; Sherlock, eyes shut and mouth thin, hands steepled in front of him as though deep into his Mind Palace. Except…
‘Anything to help find her ladyship’s jewel, Mr. Watson.’

Unmoving, but not asleep – John knows that much.
‘Yes,
Sherlock’s footsteps in the corridor brought John’s eyes back up. Sadly, he was already — well, partially — dressed. For a man who’d kipped at most two hours on the sofa, Sherlock cut an annoyingly fine figure even in bare, damp feet. Perhaps more so.
) interesting case that came to their door, it was something of a satisfaction to know that he could be involved in the unraveling of more serious crimes than simple ones of passion or greed. Gruener, more than most, would not enjoy prison; John would categorise this under the heading of 'justice'.
‘Right, okay, well, while you think about that, I’m going to make some te–’
For a second he kept his eyes shut and simply kissed him, savouring the fraction of his life where he didn’t ache for wondering what that mouth was good for if not insulting or sneering at him because, oh, he knew now and was not going to be able to forget –
He was unforgivably distracted, brain foggy with literally and figuratively sickening disorientation, deductions coming
‘Er, where —’
‘Hmm,’ is all Sherlock rumblingly retorts, so John expects Rosie will be refusing to eat her fish fingers by next week.
It was easier, in the morning, to be angry.
Hm. Bit pompous.
She smiled wanly, but the spark went out of her stormy eyes, and he felt even more shit than a moment before. Didn’t seem like he was going to end the day on especially good terms with anyone.
She smiled in genuine amusement. ‘I thoroughly appreciate your advice, Doctor. Lord Morcar and I have been discussing our security arrangements and have already made plans for improvements. I apologise that I thought an update could wait until morning. It seems I underestimated you.’
,’ Ovid suggested, head slanted in confusion. Tone, as much as content, clearly aided the bird’s comprehension, but Sherlock simply could not instruct John on his tone without entering a conversation he was not prepared to have. He allowed John to continue.
‘I don’t mean,’ Sherlock began again quickly, throat thick, wishing he could clutch John’s upper-arms tightly for balance, ‘I was not referring to suicide. I meant rather that I… will try, not to let my tendency to rush in override…’ he searched briefly for the words, all of which made him sound like a parody of the security services he so reviled, ‘proper communicative channels.’ He grimaced at his own terrible phrasing. ‘I will make an active effort not to
Settling into the mattress, he muttered, as he caught a whiff of the scent of Sherlock’s skin only centimetres away, ‘Was right about the birthmark, though.’
‘John, I have known many people in this world, but made few friends, and I can safely say you are the bravest, and kindest, and wisest human being I have ever known.’
‘Never let it be said that Sherlock Holmes never told a bird he loved her,’ John commented faintly, from behind him.
His eyes flicked up from the page once more.
But he kept his position crouched (despite the shooting pain – transport:
I am indebted, in ways conscious and unconscious, to the
His pulse
‘Who’d’ve thought you’d be the over-protective one.’ He smiles when he says it, because it’s true but he also hopes Sherlock knows they’re in this together—as upside down and dizzy in this mad endeavour as each other.
Grey rain darkened the room as John thought, and waited.
‘Charmed though Miss Winter was by you, John, she is, I fear, another one of those tedious people who insists upon going to work during the daytime hours.’
2) Lots of Austen references. Not sure why.
The man blanched, and John considered whether he should be afraid for Ramani or himself. Wordlessly, the proprietor turned and walked toward the door marked ‘EMPLOYEES ONLY’, Sherlock one step behind. As they crossed the linoleum floor, John saw Sherlock wiggle his ankle again, before returning to his brisk gait with a
John had lost the thread for a moment there, so when Sherlock spoke with something like awe in his voice, John was a step behind.
‘What do you mean, you asked Mycroft?’ John demanded.
‘The mandala was complete,’ replied the man, with a nod of his almost completely balded head. ‘And so we return it to the earth, to restore harmony. It is a symbol of healing. Another mandala will be created in time, and be destroyed in time. There is nothing permanent in this world.’
‘Can’t drive,’ Christopher cursed thickly into the brisk March night air, hands going instantly into his pockets. His collar was open, though, evidently warmed inwardly by the liquor, and John raked his eyes over the exposed skin like a Alsatian eying a steak. ‘Well we can — it’s only a short bus ride, if we can…’ His eyes were a little unfocussed as he swayed a bit on his feet, frowning to make sense of their surroundings. John chose to believe he’d contributed at least in part to the eager hurry Christopher seemed to be in.
‘Once or twice a month,’ she estimated. ‘We originally kept a house in London for our visits but it seemed such an extravagance to keep the staff and rooms prepared at all times when we receive perfectly adequate comfort here. Recent events aside, of course.’ (If five-star room service and silk-and-crystal furnishings were ‘adequate’, John shuddered to think what sort of house she considered ‘extravagant’…)
(Messages were perhaps the worst conveyors of tone, but, based on years of experience attempting to gauge John’s texting habits

‘ Sherlock growled under his breath.
Angry though this made him, not least for the swipe at Sherlock’s past (no doubt also alluding to the morphine levels John had guided), John looked to Sherlock’s strained eyes, which widened slightly at this reply; turned to see Mycroft’s incompletely-stifled embarrassment. Sometimes with Holmeses he forgot how to read between the lines, but… possibly this was the closest they could get to expressions of sentiment.
John exhaled a shell of a laugh, as though distantly amused but primarily still processing. ‘Do — did you
of Sherlock’s soft-scratchy quicksilver tongue teasing and tasting his prick, inside the heat of Sherlock’s mouth. He shoved his shoulders into the bed and tried to catch his breath.
The bloke seemed surprised at John’s reaction, sliding instantly onto the barstool to his right.
Then, after another moment of flickering images: ‘D’you want to see them?’ John’s light tone betrayed his excitement — ah:
on his own,
‘Oh, yeah, course, sorry, go ahead.’
‘John, please,’ he offered automatically, extending a hand. ‘We thought we–’
Sherlock had depressed the button and lowered his bed from sitting to lying flat to escape such foolishness. John had snorted.)
, I didn’t mean…’ He choked slightly. ‘It was all a mistake, and then suddenly I was holding it and I hardly even knew how I’d got it!’ Effluvia were pouring from every facial orifice except his ears, turning him into a soppy, snotty mess. Sherlock’s insides wrenched with the desire to tidy him up, physically if not mentally, and get him
John was a terrible liar, but the genuine pleasure and fondness threaded through his tone kept the peripheral confusion at bay somewhat.
‘You need
But, in the here and now, Sherlock was breathing — even talking in his sleep about pirates and dogs and moustaches —, and thus John was free to fight like hell. He just hoped he wouldn’t have to keep fighting Sherlock.
(Rage and grief, it recurred to him, were sometimes indistinguishable. On John, especially so. Mouth, facial muscles, throat, all strained the effort not to quiver; eyes hard and bright; fists cramped so tight they’d be subdurally bruised. Ache: ubiquitous.)
The cab lurched to a stop, bringing John back from his reverie. If Sherlock had noticed John’s mental wander, he said nothing.
‘What? Is this not yours?’ Not that he cared, so long as they found some room,
So he quickly rotated his chair, then moved behind John’s turned back towards his (their) bedroom and exchanged his dressing gown for a jacket.
Well. The solutions were supposed to be at room temperature — indeed, overnight testing might provide additional data. He removed and stowed away the phials, tubes, and slides, switched off the light, and made his way to the sofa (careful to cross as quickly as possible in front of the screen), then sat (with the tiniest residual flip of his stomach at allowing the impulse of this to be acted upon) in the space at John’s side, beneath where John’s right arm was resting across the back cushion.
Which was, he supposed, pretty much the whole game.
.’ A young constable receiving these instructions gawped queasily over Sherlock’s shoulder, plainly hoping Bradstreet would countermand this no doubt joking orders.
,’ Sherlock had murmured, wishing there had been a second kiss, one enough to scandalise the entire crowd of morning tourists and fellow Londoners, the bulk of whom had seemed to find it compulsory to expose their pale, often overweight flesh to the sun at the first sign of even partially cloudless weather. The miracle of John Watson had been, as ever, not merely that he was not one of those so compelled, but that — unlike approximately everyone on the planet — his was still the only body Sherlock wanted to take home and explore. (Well. Only living body.) ‘I’ll keep that in mind for attracting your attention next time.’
Some time later, he became aware that (cooling) tea and eight brown cardboard packages were now on the coffeetable that had not been there previously, and that the front door and seventeen steps were reverberating with the return — oh —
, which only ended up hurting other people and himself. ‘What did you do with the parrot?’
‘ John said – he no longer needed the hardware to hear him – as though soothing a spooked animal. ‘Easy now.’
He smiled and shrugged. ‘Send me anyone who says otherwise, I’ll take care of ‘em.’ He stepped back to allow her room. ‘Besides,’ he added, lowering his voice, ‘I always need you to help me in case Himself solves the great parrot caper and starts climbing the walls.’
– he risked the miniscule sound of one metal (bronze) abrading metal (stainless steel) to grab what looked like a jewel-encrusted sword, complete with (hence it keeping company among Gruener’s things) pornographic illustrations dimly perceptible along the hilt –
, he mused, aside. Coming home from work or a date or, while Sherlock had been gone, the other side of London — listening to the grunts or soaring violin or unexpected voices of the flat upstairs, or sniffing the aroma of Mrs Hudson’s baking (or otherwise). His shoes had a place here. His coat, his keys. The kitchen was an absolute wreck but he knew where everything was, usually. The sitting room wasn’t much better, and sometimes he looked around at their television, tucked away under the cabinet between the rooms, and wished he lived the kind of life where he was more likely to find football flashing on his walls than foetid intestines or criminal Top Trumps (they really did play that).
) days in the hospital had nearly rotted his brains until they dribbled like putrefied bile from his ears.
— he had sat, shaking beside the toilet in his flat, biting his hand so hard to keep back the sobs he had to wear a brace the next day to cover it up — even then he couldn’t picture how shockingly, glaringly
Of that, at least, Sherlock was more certain, though he doubted he would enjoy being the messenger in this case. ‘Not entirely.’
It was true — though of course John
The kettle popped, and he was very happy to turn away from his brother’s convoluted face with its trivializing condescension aimed at him.
Sherlock wanted to shout, as though he were watching John stride into a funeral pyre meant for himself. What kind of life was that?
Worse than the damn Cheshire cat, this man, the tilt of his obscene mouth. ‘Can you not “resolve” your own tension?’
Harry blinked. ‘You
; Sherlock was at least 65% certain), and Sherlock had come back before things were irreversible. Before his return, however, he could only imagine… A blonde, objectively attractive woman’s body curling around John’s in their sleep, giggling with him at their clinic, lacing her pale feminine hands in his blunter, darker ones, keeping him in danger even when (especially when) he didn’t know it. All the while Sherlock himself had been in hotel rooms and mountain forests and snowy alleys thinking of
‘So you think a man who killed his wife —’ John cut in, hand poised over his glass as if preparing to use it as a projectile, ‘a man who runs a human trafficking ring in

], but he had no other distinguishable dermatological features [
‘Is he alright?’ John asked curtly, no doubt referring to the clumsy mess of a man at her feet.
John’s body was shaking with the semi-conscious effort to drag this out as long as possible, to stretch his own expectations to allow Sherlock to continue sucking him off for, he hoped faintly, at least a decade; but, as Sherlock’s hand at the base of his cock drifted back to press at the skin behind, John sobbed at how close he already was.
‘Don’t do anything too dangerous while I’m gone, yeah?’ One last swooping peck of a kiss (mouth reddened). ‘Can’t have you hogging all the fun.’
Again, Baker’s agile face transformed, this time lifting into a boyish smile. ‘My wife, is – ’ But he stopped, and looked more carefully at Sherlock. Ah – so he was just putting
‘There were two of them. Approached me on the street — or, well, I believe in a sort of private drive near the train tracks.’
Heed tags: MENTIONS of (but *not* scenes of) past, canon-typical bad things.
But this was his home.
‘No, but we should have.’
They marched up and down the street and the two parallel ones plus the adjacent dead-end lane, then attempted to scale the nearest overlooking yard. Unsurprisingly, most of the gardens were in states of leafy anarchy. At one point he considered scaling the rocky rise, in case the view from the tracks afforded any insight (perhaps it would provide a good elevated post from which to surveil the upper-floors when nocturnal business hours commenced). But Suze flapped about, even going so far as to yank his sleeve to pull him away, as though she feared he was about to throw himself under an oncoming train — there was none in sight! he was neither deaf nor blind! — and so he decided to put it off. At least until this evening when he and John could return: John would let him, so long as he came along to stand guard. (An unnecessary measure: John could no more stop a train than Sherlock could. Though a part of him would like to watch him try.)
‘Yeah,’ John sighed with audible relief, apparently that Sherlock hadn’t
Behind one tower of cheap steel shelves, a thin maroon curtain veiled the single window and the river beyond. Heart thudding, John placed a hand silently at his back, prepared to be jumped or shoved or blinded or any of the other possible attacks they had occasionally been treated to, just in the four months since resuming casework. Sherlock simply yanked the curtain aside.
With an elegance matched only by a certain pair of sparring brothers in his life, Violet rolled her eyes and stood up straighter from where she was leaning over her worktop. ‘A woman drowned, Dr. Watson. It isn’t as though she was pushed off a
It was going to drizzle, pour, dry up, and then (tomorrow) storm, he felt with certainty that was tinged, a bit madly, with affection. Nowhere rained with quite such constant paradoxical variety as Britain.
Which is all to say: this little AU has been with me for a while. And so to feel good — which somehow, amazingly, I do — about ending the story here, is sort of desolate and beautiful at the same time.

. Soggy. Tantamount to allowing Gruener to lick the inside of his mouth.)
‘God, you’re unbelievable,’ John rasped, coming up for air, which cut jaggedly into Sherlock’s breathing because he knew that, he
‘Charles Ryder,’ Sherlock announced with mock-cordiality.
That was fine — possibly better. Made things easier, if they were going to try to triangulate some sort of happy sexual/professional/domestic medium. Much as he enjoyed crowding Sherlock a bit, he felt tonight called for ‘quit while you’re ahead’.
But ‘before’ deictically revolved around an implied event:
John shook his head, unimpressed, but he knew he was back to smirking like the sop that he was.
‘I just kissed you, John.’
Sherlock didn’t bother to look down at the table, to move or to take his eyes away from John’s, adding to the electric charge in the room that made John want to throw Sherlock against a wall. As it was, the heat of Sherlock’s body, not in contact anywhere in particular but somehow palpable everywhere, where his hands and mouth and skin
