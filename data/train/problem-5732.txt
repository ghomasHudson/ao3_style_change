“It’s a long and I mean
“It’s okay,” Peter mumbles but it’s obvious that it wasn’t okay. He was hurt. And he had every right to be.
“Screw that guy,” Tony says and Steve peers up at him. “He’s a liar. Whatever he told you was all bullshit. That thing about him blaming you for the pups…” Tony stops himself when he sees how shiny Steve’s eyes have gotten. “Don’t listen to him. You’re free now. He’s gone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve eventually writes out his message, keeping it simple and straight to the point. He reads it over, huffing at his own words. It wasn’t perfect, but it would have to do. He rips the paper from the book and folds it up, then lays it on his nightstand.
Ned nods, this time following through and not bringing up anything to do with Flash or the baby.
“What happened?”
Steve swallows hard and quickly wipes away the tear that rolls down his face. “He’d hurt me. Sometimes it was just a slap or a punch. Other times I would be locked in this room and...he’d just beat me. It wasn’t just him. Other alphas were tasked to hurt me until I understood my place.”
“You’re a bad liar.”
Bucky frowns and turns himself in Sam’s arms so that their eyes can meet. “Well yeah. I had siblings and you have one. We’re having two.”
The beta and Steve stare each other down, waiting for the other to make a move. The beta moves first, and that’s when Steve attacks. He grabs the hand that's holding the syringe, twisting it roughly and the man cries out. Steve takes the syringe in one hand and with the other, he spins the beta around so he’s forcing the alphas and tightly wraps his arm around the beta’s neck, ignoring the gasping and struggling.
Tony smiles softly and takes Steve’s hand. “I know. You’re doing so good. I guess I just thought with the baby coming soon that we’d be too distracted and for once I don’t want to think about me. It’s always you and the baby on my mind lately.”
“It was all about control.”
Sam sighs again and sits down beside his nephew. “I wish I could. I’d give anything to go back and change the way things went down that night.”
“That’s good at least,” Tony says and drinks from his coffee mug. He takes the seat across from Peter. “No more morning sickness.”
There was no point in trying to convince Steve that enough was enough. Tony tried that, but Steve wanted just one more chance.
“Then there you go. I didn’t have what you had with Steve. God, I would’ve killed for my dad to hug me. You were lucky.”
“Then you never would’ve met me. We wouldn’t have mated and-” Tony winces again from the pain in his side and grits his teeth. “-fell in love, had a baby. Damn I wish I had done more. You and Pete would be safe. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
“Where’s your other half?” Clint is the first to ask. Steve’s eyes flicker in his direction, not missing the bored expression on his face.
“Hey, Pep,” Tony greets, doing his best to keep his tone light. He’s slightly irritated and tired.
There’s that word again. Tony still felt nothing. His heart didn’t flutter with joy when the doctor let them listen to the baby’s heart.
“J, please! Why are you doing this?”
“You feel so good.” Tony presses more of himself inside, groaning at the tight heat that surrounds him. Though he’s nervous about having a baby, he can’t deny that making one was the best part. He almost hopes this one doesn’t take so he can have an excuse to fuck Steve again. But then he’s reminded he’d have to be the one to carry the baby if this doesn’t succeed. It would be his turn to get fucked.
Steve peers up from the files he’s been reading and sets them down in his lap when he notices his son lingering in the doorway of his bedroom. Peter is holding onto his Thor bear, eyes bright with tears. He must have had another nightmare.
Steve can’t help but smile at those words. He wishes he could convince Tony to take a test now. It would be easy to blame Tony’s illness on a random stomach virus, but Steve can’t help but wonder if luck was finally on their side.
“Tony?” Comes Bruce’s voice, followed by a knock against the doorframe. Tony glances over his shoulder and gestures with his head for the doctor to enter. “How is he?”
Oh Tony 🤦♀️ I guess he’ll learn the hard way.
“You make computers?”
“You good?” Tony asks, reaching out to rub his hands along Steve’s thigh. The omega shudders and nods his head. “That was amazing, darling. Seeing you come like that.”
Steve hums softly and his eyes flutter shut. “Goodnight.”
“Wait, are we eating out?” Steve asks, his voice laced with panic.
“No.” Tony shakes his head. “That wasn’t your fault. I know you probably did everything you could. Steve, you need to understand that you had no control. Don’t blame yourself.”
“Tony!” Steve cries, head tipping back and eyes squeezing shut when the pain worsens.
Happy leads Steve toward the front door, then he rushes in the direction of the kitchen to grab the phone that was almost left behind. He returns a minute later and carefully helps the laboring super soldier out the door.
Steve does as he’s told, struggling at first to move his hips. He picks himself up until just the head of his alpha’s cock is inside, then lowers himself back down, moaning and throwing his head back when Tony fills him up again.
“Please? You’re the only guy I can trust.”
“Yes you are.” Tony stops moving and takes Steve’s hand, leading it to his back. “Touch me.”
Tony doesn’t press for any more details of Steve’s death. Peter wasn’t a hundred percent healed and it was going to take more time for him to become comfortable enough to talk about that terrible day.
Returning to his apartment is difficult. The moment he opens the door, a wave of sadness washes over him. Everything is exactly the same, nothing has been touched, just the way he wanted it.
Harley is back to pouting and he pulls away, shaking his head and crossing his arms. “No. I don’t wanna.”
“Y-yeah,” Peter stammers and fiddles with his fingers. “Papa thinks it was the serum. I don’t know. One minute I was normal and the next he found me crawling on the ceiling.”
Steve lifts his head and shoots Tony a tired smile. His gaze falls to the hard cock between the alpha’s legs, the urge to be fucked becomes overwhelming. Steve spreads his legs wide, inviting the alpha.
Steve glances down at their connected hands, and he smiles. “It’s been awhile since we’ve done this.”
“It’s okay,” Peter tries to soothe, but it’s a lie. Nothing was okay. Nothing would ever be the same.
The sad look the doctor wears is all Tony needs to know. They’ve lost another one.
“Dammit,” Tony curses and runs a hand through his hair. “FRIDAY, please tell me you know what the hell is going on.”
Silence.
Tony is livid.
“I’m sorry, but am I not allowed to come home early? This is my tower, isn’t it?”
Steve chuckles lightly and pulls Tony close until their bodies are pressed against each other. If the circumstances were different, they’d probably find themselves in another position, but being this close to Steve, and wrapped in his arms was enough.
Peter knew better than to hide on the ceilings, but there were times when he needed to cool down and found solace in high places. Steve would let him cool down that way, supervised of course.
“It’s okay,” Natasha soothes. Her own eyes are full of tears. She hugs her nephew tighter and his fighting stops. He clings to her instead. “It’s okay, sweetie. It’s okay.”
The nausea comes and goes throughout the morning, but Steve pushes it aside, forcing himself to forget about it and focus on the appointment. It wasn’t difficult for Tony to find a doctor, nor was it an issue to transform a section of the medical bay to fit his and the baby’s needs. It was surreal being in a new room with equipment Steve never imagined seeing.
Tony sighs harshly. He’s regretting confiding in Bruce, but at the same time he needed to talk to someone. After Steve left, Tony couldn’t ignore the horrible thoughts of his husband not being trusted around their daughter. He has FRIDAY keeping a close eye on them and so far all of her updates have been good, but he was still paranoid. He hated it.
“I didn’t know. He sounded like he wouldn’t go if I helped. So I did.”
“I know but we could live here. It’s quiet and private. No one will bother us. Pete can play out here until the sun goes down.”
Tony doesn’t even give Steve a chance to decide if that’s something he wants to do. The alpha is already on his phone and asking his friends to come down stairs.
Both Happy and Pepper rise to their feet. They share an uneasy look.
“What?” Tony pulls back. “And miss this? Of course I’d show up. I promised.”
“It’s okay. I know this isn’t what we expected, but we’ll figure it out,” Tony says, and he directs his attention on his sleeping son, a small smile appearing over his face. “He’s perfect.”
“Bye, Tony.”
“Hey, I know I’m not. I’m not making this about me.”
Steve chuckles and gets up from his seat to gather the dishes. He takes Tony’s plate and leans down to kiss him softly on the cheek. Tony finishes off his wine and follows Steve into the kitchen to help clean up.
Steve had his hands full with a super kid, but he wouldn’t trade his life for the world.
“I wanted to. And-”Steve pauses and slips free from around Tony to get to the island. He picks up the gift. “-this is for you. I...I hope you like it.”
Bruce finishes the exam and leaves the mansion, promising to see them both in another month. Steve is already looking forward to the next visit. They were the highlight of his month.
“Don’t fight me.” Alexander growls, and he grips Steve tightly by the jaw, forcing their eyes to meet. “You’ve brought this on yourself. You disobeyed me, and now I have to punish you.”
“It’s true,” Sam nods. “I’m the new Cap.”
“Yeah, but now you can do whatever you want. I want you to decide.”
“Yeah.” Steve nods and he peers up to meet Tony’s concerned gaze.
“Sorry. I’m just confused here,” Happy rubs at his forehead. “How did this even happen? Even when you do sleep around you’re always careful. Do you even know who this guy is?”
“Let me see that smile. You know it’s my favorite thing in the world.”
“Daddy, he’s Spider-Man!” Peter corrects.
“Sorry!” Peter quickly rushes to help. “I’m not grounded right?”
“Then prove it. That’s all we ask. Don’t get his hopes up.”
“Because he’s excited about something and Steve was always the first to know.”
With Bruce chatting with Clint and Bucky, Tony steps away and makes his way back to the kitchen. Peter had offered him a drink earlier and Tony had declined, too nervous to put anything in his stomach. He decides to get something now just to keep himself distracted.
“Nothing. I have to go.”
Tony was healing nicely from the latest mission, but Steve still refused to leave his side. He promised he would be there to take care of Tony. It was a struggle at first to juggle his care and their son’s, but they found a way to make it work.
The hot water against his skin burns, forcing him to grit his teeth and hiss through it. He doesn’t adjust the temperature, instead letting it run along his sore muscles. Steve leans forward, resting his forehead against the tile wall of the shower and hunching his back. His eyes fall shut.
This time would be different. At least, that’s what he tries to tell himself. That little voice in the back of his head laughs at him, reminding him that he was doing the exact same thing his past self used to do.
A white, hot pain erupts in Steve’s stomach. A scream rips through his throat and he glances down at the knife plunged deep into his belly. The hand around the edge of the blade twists, causing Steve to cry out again. Steve rams his head forward, connecting it with his attacker’s and sending the man back. The knife is ripped from Steve’s body and falls to the floor.
“Again, it’s a long story.”
He only sighs and says, “It sucks.”
Peter waits by his bedroom door, listening for signs that would indicate that Happy had left. He sighs in relief once he hears the front door open and then shut again.
“You?” Tony replies and Steve nods his head. “The guy who faced Hydra twice and won? The guy who didn’t give up and kept fighting, who continues to fight? Absolutely. Steve, you’re the strongest, most bravest person I’ve ever met. Every day you’re continuing to amaze me.
Steve was obviously ecstatic if the smile on his face and the tears in his eyes were anything to go by. They lock eyes and Tony forces another smile. Steve takes Tony’s hand, squeezing it tenderly.
The video call ends and Tony leans back in his chair with a heavy sigh. He knows he should go upstairs to be back with his mate and son, but he can’t help but get the itch to work. It’s been months since he’s gotten his hands dirty. Steve and the baby had been his top priority, and though they still are, he missed work sometimes.
“I know. I love you, Auntie Nat, but...but I want them to listen too.” Morgan sighs. “Can I just live with you?”
“Dad, don’t,” Peter begs, but goes ignored just like he knew he would.
“I remember when you were this big,” Steve gestures to one of the posters on the walls. The poster showed the different stages of fetal development. “I think you were the size of a grapefruit.”
It’s Steve’s turn to apologize. “Sorry. I’m just tired.”
“Great. I’m glad you figured out the reason for our separation. We’re fine. We don’t need to be together to raise a kid. Plenty of people do it this way.”
“That doesn’t help me at all. I work with a lot of people, kid.”
Steve sighs. “I don’t mean to be.”
Parenting four pups was a struggle, but it was worth the hardships. A family was what Steve had wanted for a long time. At one point it seemed as if he’d never get the simple life he envisioned for himself, but life had other plans and he was granted the greatest blessing in the world.
“O-okay. Wow um thank you so much.”
Steve swallows hard. “Y-yeah?”
The coffee is finished a few minutes later and Tony is filling the two mugs when Steve shuffles into the kitchen. Tony shoots him a smile, and this time he gets on in return.
Peter doesn’t respond and glances back down at his untouched food. He pokes around at the egg, his stomach growing queasy at the thought of having to eat it. He pushes the plate away and takes the toast to nibble on instead.
Tony scoffs and shakes his head. “Whatever you say, J. I’m still rooting for Tony Junior.”
Steve raises a brow. “Probably?”
“You won’t take me back?”
“Yeah. I’ve been putting off a lot because of-” Tony waves a hand at Steve’s belly. “-and I know once he’s born I’ll put off more. God. I don’t even know how I’m supposed to run this place and be a father. I should just quit.”
Tony is still frowning. “Only because you get up too damn early. If you would’ve stayed in bed longer I probably would’ve sucked your dick.”
Just that thought alone brings a smile to his face. But then it’s fading. At the rate they were going, he’d never get to see how amazing Tony really could be with their children.
Tony glances down at his lap, fiddling nervously with his hands and toying with the gold band on his finger. He wonders how Steve could possibly love him or even want to continue being married to him. He was a monster.
“Move on? My best friend is dead. Steve is dead!” Bucky screams.
“I’m sorry.”
“Pete!” His papa calls from the other side, followed by another knock. “Breakfast!”
Tony stands and makes his way over to the suit, placing his hand over the black spider in the center. It was exactly the way Steve had designed it. Tony added his own special touches, things he figured his son would appreciate, but the credit should go to Steve. It had been his idea in the first place.
Sam smiles. “You wanna tell me about him?”
Tony scoffs anyway and shakes his head.
“You can get the sauce.”
“Understandable.”
“Yeah. Let's discuss it, though.”
He doesn’t know why he’s telling her this. He trusted his husband around their daughter. Not once did he ever think he would bring harm to her. But that inner voice is quick to point out all of the times Steve grew frustrated with their baby. Tony doesn’t want to listen, but that voice is persistent, making him wonder what would’ve happened if he didn’t step in and help.
This time Steve complies and he takes a step back, his eyes never leaving Tony’s.
Peter wants to decline; he’s not even hungry, but he doesn’t want to leave his uncles just yet. He enjoyed staying over. They bickered sometimes but his papa always told him it was what married couples do.
that he can’t talk about
“I’m not an anesthesiologist,” Bruce deadpans. “Unfortunately, this is going to be a natural birth. This is what you wanted, right?”
He can’t decide if he’s more angry or devastated over the test result, perhaps a bit of both. But right now, the anger is winning and he throws the stick in the trash.
“Too big. Look at me! I look like a whale. It’s not a good look on me.”
“I don’t want to break it.”
“What is it?” Tony asks. “Who’s hurt?”
“I’ll be there.” Steve promises.
His smile is faltering and Tony knows what’s coming next.
“Honey-”
The party was meant to celebrate their victory. They had saved the world again and to commemorate the win, Tony threw the team and a few guests a party. Tony was used to opening up his tower and hosting these types of events. Though usually the parties he threw were meant to recognize his accomplishments, this one was strictly for the team.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. We’re trying to get them interested in something else.”
This time Peter gives in. He steps away from his bed and crosses the room to open the door. Steve smiles sadly at his son.
His papa is serving breakfast, nodding along with what his dad is saying and doing his best to calm him down. Peter already knows which one will be the calmer of the two when he tells them.
It only takes half a second for Steve to realize what he’s done. He grows frightened, terrified of what kind of punishment awaits him. He does the only thing he knows how to do.
He wasn’t sure what he was expecting. Maybe robotic arms to sprout out of the computer and poke and prod at his growing middle. But it’s nothing like that. He doesn’t feel anything.
“I thought about that and yours but...it didn’t seem right. He needs his own name.”
“I love you too, bud.”
Steve huffs. “Guess I’ll see you later. Bye, Tony.”
He sets Peter back down in the bassinet, wincing at the piercing cry his son emits. He quickly steps in to calm him, speaking to him soothingly and promising to make everything better. Peter isn’t having any of it, his cries growing louder the longer he’s deprived of food. Tony doesn’t waste anymore time and rushes out of the room to get a bottle ready.
“It’s just for a few weeks, right?” Tony asks as they walk together through the courtyard of the facility Steve has decided was suitable for him. Tony still begged to differ, but this was what Steve wanted and Tony needed to respect that.
And now they had a new member.
“You can’t go five minutes without hitting on someone, can you?” Happy asks, staring at his boss through the rearview mirror.
“I fought for omega’s.”
“Sorry, kiddo,” Tony tells him then turns back to Steve. “Not James. I can’t say the same for the other three.”
A baby shower had been the last thing on Steve’s mind. His son would be arriving soon and all of Steve’s time went into preparing for the birth and what was supposed to come next. It was scary to imagine what his life was going to be like with a newborn, but at the same time he couldn’t wait to hold his son for the first time.
Pierce chuckles. “Careful, Stark. You might just get your wish. I won’t kill you, not when I have a chance at creating more beautiful alphas. You son is only the beginning.”
“Don’t.” Tony shakes his head. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean what I said. I don’t blame you for any of this. I was an inconsiderate jerk.”
“It’s better than a press conference,” Tony reminds. He was right about that. Steve couldn’t imagine facing that many people and telling them his story.
“I’m not expecting anything but...forget it.”
“No,” Steve says with a shake of his head. “Brooklyn.”
“Day two of you being sick,” Steve corrects. “We don’t know how far along you are. I’m guessing maybe six...seven weeks?”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony assures. He remembers Steve struggling to get her to latch on the night before, and he curses to himself for not getting out of bed first. “You should have let me handle it.”
“I love you, too.” Steve smiles. He shifts so that he’s on his back and Tony is leaning over him. Steve cups Tony’s face and brings him in for a kiss.
After Tony’s cleaned up the mess the best he could, he takes Harley into his arms and lets the pup rest over his chest. Harley purrs the moment he picks up on the steady beatings of Tony’s heart, the sound lulling him to sleep almost immediately.
Steve ends the call. He waits, hoping and praying that the phone would finally ring and Tony would be on the other line. But the call never comes, and Steve has to fight back the tears that gather in his eyes.
Sarah takes a minute to think it over. Then she nods her head and wipes at her nose. “Okay, daddy.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“That makes two of us. Be good for your papa okay? He’s scared. Do you blame him? You’re gonna be a handful, aren’t you? But we love you anyway.”
“He’s right.”
Tony has to fight the urge to slam on the breaks. Instead he glances in the kid’s direction, a look of disbelief on his face.
Steve laughs. “Crazy dog.”
“You’re gonna hang out with your auntie Nat. Sound good?”
“Probably. But we haven’t discussed if we want to know or…” Tony trails off and Steve nods his head. They’ll wait.
A small smile forms on Steve’s face. He takes Tony’s hand and leads it to the place he was beating himself up over just minutes prior. Tony doesn’t rip his hand away or grimace in disgust. He smiles that smile that let’s Steve know that everything is going to be okay.
Ned grows silent and once glance in his direction shows how hurt and guilty he appears.
“Let’s just say it’s for a special occasion.”
The first thing he does is run into the bathroom to check on his appearance. It’s not until he realizes it’s just Flash does Peter stop himself from fixing his hair.
Tony sighs. “Steve, you’re not fine. Talk to me. Please?”
“‘M good,” Steve mumbles and lifts his head.
“Hurry up,” the alpha orders and turns away to let the omega dry himself off. Steve makes sure he’s quick about it, not wanting to be exposed for another minute.
“He just loved spending time with you.”
“No. Just meet me here whenever you get out of school or something.”
He should feel safe now that he’s in the air and out of reach from the alpha that’s made his life miserable, but yet he can’t find ease. Being in an extravagant jet was something he’s never experienced. But even that was something he couldn’t find enjoyment in. All he can think about is the last time he’s been this high in the air.
“What’s with the long face?” Clint steps into the kitchen and clasps a hand over Peter’s back.
They finish up the shopping, and end up getting more than what was originally planned. Tony hadn’t intended them on getting so much, but if it made Steve happy, then he was going to do it.
As soon as Morgan is back at the tower, she jumps out of the car and rushes for the front door, making sure to wave goodbye to Happy before dashing inside. The rule was to wait until Happy could escort her inside, but she was fine. She is all grown up now and didn’t require an adult to hold her hand. At least that would be the argument she’d use when her papa asked.
“You doing okay?” Tony asks, coming over until he’s standing beside the chair Steve is sitting in.
Tony begs to differ, but he agrees to go back to the party with Peter, reminding himself yet again that he was here for his son and no one else.
Steve cries out suddenly and uses Happy as leverage. The muscles in his abdomen coil, followed by a pressure between his legs.
“Guess you were starving, huh?” Tony grins, his smile growing brighter when Peter’s eyes open and lock with his own. Their eyes are identical in shape and Tony knows the color would be the exact same. “This is crazy,” Tony whispers. “You’re my son.”
“I’ll be downstairs. Let me know if you need anything.”
Tony huffs out a small laugh. “We’ll see. Tell your scary uncle to calm down first.”
Alexander sighs sadly. “He doesn’t get out very much, so when he never came home last night, I wondered if he had come to you. You would’ve been a familiar face to him.”
But that wasn’t reality. Leaving Steve was not an option. Tony loved him too much. The baby was another story.
Steve lets out a shaky breath and glances down. Tears are gathering in his eyes and rolling down his face. Tony lifts his head up again so he can wipe them away with his thumbs.
“Hmm.” Steve ponders for a moment. He had been content with the idea of blowing off his birthday this year, but in the back of his mind he can’t help but wonder what it would be like to celebrate. Things were different now. He wasn’t locked away and under Hydra’s control. He was free.
“Do you need the nurse?” Tony asks, failing to keep the bit of panic that has seeped into his tone.
“Shh, Pete, it’s okay. I’m not mad. No one’s mad.”
Bruce steps in this time. “You need to rest. I promise you’ll have your son back.”
“Out on a run with Sam and Bucky,” Natasha answers.
“Okay. I get that.”
His world had come crashing down after the loss of his mother and then again when he lost Bucky. They had been the two people he looked up to most. They encouraged him and built him up, provided a sense of confidence he felt he never would’ve gained if not for them. He had been lost without them.
“That’s not what I’m trying to say. If you would just listen.” Steve’s aware of the dangerous tone he’s using. His patience is being put to the test, something that always happens when he’s trying to communicate with Tony.
I wrote this chapter and it came out kinda long so I split it up. Double update! Yay! I promise the smut is in the next chapter, but here is some cute moments between Steve and Tony!
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll figure something out. I always do.”
“Tell me about him then.”
“And the smelliest.” Bucky wrinkles his nose when an unpleasant smell wafts through the room.
Their eyes meet and Harley curiously stretches one small hand out, tiny fingers brushing against Steve’s cheek. Steve whines softly from the contact, his heart fluttering. Harley takes a moment to scent Steve properly and explore his face, then once he’s comfortable enough, he leans forward and nuzzles his nose against Steve’s neck. Harley starts purring.
“Thanks, Pep.”
“Hold up. Did he ask you?” Sam asks.
“Yes. But I’m scared.”
“Steve, you do have a baby. You have a son.”
“How the hell was I supposed to know that you...that you loved me back? How!” Tony shouts. Luckily he’s the only one at the cemetery, and no one hears his outburst.
Steve nods and lays his head down on Tony’s shoulder. He’s exhausted and his body demands rest, but he longs to hold his son again. He’s only held one pup but even then he never got the chance to bond with her. Peter would be different. He would get to keep this one.
Sensing his mate’s nervousness, Tony decides to stay behind to comfort him.
“Hmm?” Peter mumbles and his brown eyes flutter open. He yawns and sits up. “What time is it?”
He’s left alone again and the door shuts, locking into place. Steve retreats back to his bed and curls around himself. The tears burn the corners of his eyes and he doesn’t even try to hold them back.
Those breaks he tried to give his husband never lasted very long. Morgan would get hungry and only Steve was able to fill that need. It was a special bonding time for them. Feeding her was Steve’s alone time with Morgan. At first, Steve had been happy to nurse, but little by little, that too changed.
“I’m not going to hit you,” she says as she pulls out an open bottle of Chardonnay.
“Shh.” Tony cradles Steve’s head, fingers gently threading through his hair. “I’m not going to do that. I’m sorry, Steve. I’ll do better. I don’t want to lose you. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“Morning,” Steve mumbles and sits down. His eyes shift to Morgan when she grows fussy in Natasha’s arms and he sighs loudly. “I’ll take her,” he says and sets down his breakfast.
“Yes yes I know. I’m just kidding. At least yours will probably go away soon. I still have months of this torture.”
Tony sighs. “I know. I honestly haven’t figured out how the hell to do it.”
“I know. We all did. Sweetheart, I’m so sorry.” Tony’s own eyes shine with tears, but he holds back, not wanting to break when Steve was already broken. He had to be strong.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wedding of the year? Tony, it’s supposed to be small.”
Pepper dabs at her eyes with a tissue, cleaning up the black streaks left over from her ruined mascara. Her attempts to make herself appear presentable are futile. More tears gather in her eyes, ruining the bit of progress she’s made. It would be hopeless to try again, and with one last look in the mirror, she exits the bathroom.
Tony growls from the begging, his cock hardening in response to the submissive sounds his mate was making.
“Hey.” Tony interlocks their fingers and gives Steve’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “Morgan’s good. You’re not missing much.”
“I thought you said he was doing better?” Bruce says, his brows furrowing slightly. “Why are you afraid to leave him alone with Morgan?”
There’s mixed feelings about returning to the compound. The last time he had set foot in it was 15 years ago. It was the last time he saw Steve too.
His daughter is ripped out of his arms.
“So then what?” Tony asks. “Did you stop this Schmidt guy?”
He forces a small smile. “I guess I just miss Ned.”
Steve places his face in the crook of Tony’s neck and lightly kisses along the skin. “I love you.”
“Why are you big on making me stay, Cap? You’re supposed to hate me.”
Steve clears his throat, his face burning when he catches the lingering stares from his teammates. He hated arguing with Tony in front of the team.
“You sure you’re okay?” Tony asks. A part of him is hoping Steve would let him stay longer or they switch it up and spend the night at his place, but then Steve is nodding his head, assuring Tony that he was fine.
“Thanks for picking this up,” Steve gestures to the second car seat. Natasha peers up at him and smiles, then she directs her gaze back on Peter’s curious face.
At least it wasn’t alcohol.
“Wait, Tony! You forgot about the-” The door slams and Steve has gone unheard. He sighs. “-hologram. Dammit.”
“Yeah but my papa still took care of his own. And I want to do the same.”
Clint had brought his whole family with him, which gave Steve a glimpse into his near future. He didn’t understand how Clint could have two children and another on the way. Steve was glad he was only having the one, but it was still scary. A baby was life-changing.
“Don’t worry about it. You might have to take him earlier than we scheduled. I’m needed for an assignment.”
Steve sniffs and buries his face deeper into Tony’s neck, staining the warm skin with his tears. Tony immediately senses his mate’s distress and he holds him tighter, promising that this wasn’t the end, that they were going to be free again. They’d have their son back and they could go back to being a family.
“Thanks. I couldn’t do this without you or...anyone.”
Steve is held down tightly and slammed into the wall, a small grunt leaving him when he hits the hard surface. Cuffs are placed around his wrists, not that it mattered. He was done fighting back.
“It was nothing,” Happy replies modestly. He smiles when Morgan yawns and opens her eyes for him. “You look so much like your dad,” he whispers to her. “I’m glad you’re here. You really do know how to make an entrance.”
Bruce hands her a tissue and she wipes away at her eyes, but the tears keep falling, her makeup smearing. Pepper obviously didn’t care what she looked like. She was usually more put together, she had to be as the new CEO, but now she didn’t care about any of that. Her best friend was dead.

The tests don’t take too long and Peter doesn’t even flinch when his blood is drawn. He keeps his mind occupied with other things, mostly school assignments that were coming up or catching up with Ned. He doesn’t want to think about the rest of the appointment.
Tony grunts and his body grows taut. His cock spills inside Steve’s mouth and the omega swallows the load. Steve pulls away and licks the bit of Tony’s release off his lips.
Peter decided at that moment that nap time was over and it was lunchtime. He fusses and whimpers in the car seat, tiny hands flailing in discomfort. Steve carefully takes his hungry son out of the car seat and adjusts him in his arms. Pepper steps in to assist and get the younger pup in a comfortable position for Steve to nurse.
Tony wanders over to the couch while he waits for Peter to return. He doesn’t sit down right away, his attention drawn to the photos hanging on the wall. He smiles at the ones of Peter when he was a baby. Tony follows the row of pictures, his smile growing just like the little boy in them.
“I wanted to name him Peter.”
Tony frowns and swipes his finger over the screen again to pull up the next option. “I will. I just want to get this done so I can show him.”
“Where is my son?” Tony asks in Russian.
Morgan giggles and crawls into bed beside him. She reminds herself that she’s too old to be snuggling with him, but his warmth is nice and it’s been too long since they’ve spent mornings like this. Harley was always waking up and crawling into bed with their parents.
Poor Steve though 😞 He was so excited and did all these nice things for Tony. Tony has a lot of explaining and apologizing to do!
Peter is cleaned up and dressed, then wrapped in a fluffy blanket and back in his mother’s arms. Tony makes sure to not interrupt the bond currently being formed between his son and mate. The smile on Steve’s face is unlike one Tony has ever seen. Steve looked happy. He was finally at peace.
“He doesn’t look scared to me,” Thor says, glancing over at the smiling toddler and giving him a little wave.
“Just the good stuff I hope.” Tony comes closer to be near Pepper. He briefly looks over the document he needs to sign. “I can’t sign this. I need coffee first.”
Thank you so much for reading! I love you all! 🥰
Peter winces. “Sorry.”
“Hmm?” Tony glances down at the bouquet. “Yeah. It’s been a while since I’ve brought anything and I figured maybe he’d…”
Tony’s brows draw together in confusion. He’s not sure what that has to do with anything. He answers the question anyway. “I guess. I mean my father always gave me hard time about my build but-”
“Has he ever made you believe that he would hurt her?”
“I got you, Steve. Just breathe. In and out,” Bucky instructs, his voice calm and soothing. Steve whimpers and clings to his friend tightly.
“I just don’t want to let you down. I hate seeing you so upset. Let’s see how it goes okay? Can we at least do that?”
“It hurts like a bitch,” Tony answers Bruce’s question. “Please tell me you have something to help him out.”
Steve’s brows pinch together and he bites down on his bottom lip. He thinks hard about his past life and what the older version of himself used to love doing. What hobby did he used to have? He knows he had one. It’s just been so long since he’s done anything.
“Hey, J, send a message to Rhodey. It’s been a while.”
“Keeping this to myself isn’t working anymore. That’s why I’m doing this, remember?” Steve asks, his tone growing bitter. Tony knows better than to upset him, especially when he was already in such a fragile state.
“Yeah! I’ll give you way more than Daddy!”
“I want to,” Steve says, his tone matching Tony’s gentle one. “I want this. I want a mate. I want you.”
Sam rushes to the opposite side of the jet, flipping buttons and working on getting the jet in the air. He returns a few minutes later to help. Peter assumes the jet was placed in autopilot.
Steve pulls away so that their eyes can meet. “I don’t want to lose you. For the first time I’m starting to feel like myself. You’ve given me hope. He’s not worth losing all of this over.”
“I’m sure he likes them,” Peter says and his eyes roam over the gifts that have been left behind. “All of them.”
Ned spots him immediately and waves him over. Peter takes his original spot, unable to meet Ned’s worried gaze at first.
“Thanks,” Steve replies while he lifts a stack of chairs to place in the corner with the others.
“And it was. Can’t wait till next year.”
His run is cut short.
“Nope.” She hands Steve a spoon and he takes it without any hesitation. “Ice cream is perfect for breakups.”
“Psst.” Peter lifts his head at the sound, finding his Uncle Bucky smiling at him. His uncle gestures toward the book and a crayon. Peter nods and rips out a page from his book, eyes going wide when the Director glances in his direction. He waits until it’s safe again before passing the paper and a blue crayon to his uncle.
Doctor Patterson smiles. “You need to rest. I promise you’ll make it back in time.”
Tony huffs out a laugh. “I mean...what if it was yours? It would be your baby.”
The omega hisses and his back arches when Tony wraps his lips around one of his sensitive nipples. Tony peers up at him, pausing and searching for a sign that he should stop.
Steve frowns in confusion. Nick made sure the Captain’s memories hadn’t been erased. He wasn’t trying to revive an empty vessel, but the person that left too soon. He can only hope that it has been a success.
“Tony, don’t underestimate him. He’s…”
Tony snorts and shakes his head. “We won’t.”
Tony has to fight the urge to roll his eyes. He’s lost count of how many times he’s heard that response. It was obvious Steve was more than just tired.
Steve finds his old sketchbook and one of his fine pens, then he begins to write. It’s not as simple as saying two words like Sam had said; it’s a lot harder than Steve thought.
“You love her,” Bucky grins and kisses the top of the cat’s head again.
A small groan leaves Steve’s lips and his brows crinkle in confusion. “T-Tony?”
Well, maybe not as well as he thought. His body wasn’t perfect like he used to think. It could still be harmful.
“Of course. Always.”
Sam and Bucky share a look. Steve just rolls his eyes and continues with his run.
“S-stomach.” Steve manages to get out. He can’t hold back his cries of pain. Tears roll down his face, creating wet tracks in their wake.
The room remains silent except for the quiet beeping of the machines his uncle is connected to. Peter lays his head down on the bed, listening to the soft beeping. It reminds him of the last moment he had with his papa, but this time he hopes for a happy ending.
Steve tries to lean in for a kiss, only for Tony to move away and point a finger at the door. Steve quickly pecks Tony on the cheek, laughing when Tony scolds him.
“What’s your problem?”
“Shit,” Harley says, looking as innocent as ever.
“Of course.”
He finds Ned first. They talk a bit about last night’s homework and possibly hanging out come the weekend, but then the small talk ends and Peter knows what’s coming next.
Steve smiles. He’s looking forward to it.
“Tony,” Steve whispers and rises to his feet, his eyes filling with tears.
Steve gives up on deciding on an outfit and goes with a pair of jeans and a simple black t-shirt. He slips on the black leather jacket Bucky had given him for Christmas and adjusts the front, giving himself a good look in the mirror.
Steve nods and allows himself to be led back to the living room where everyone was gathered and enjoying themselves. Steve wants to pull Tony aside and ask him about the trip, but he holds off. Now wasn’t the time.
He’s wide awake now and the thought of going back to sleep isn’t something he considers anymore. His stomach growls; he can’t even remember the last time he ate.
Steve quickly glances down at his lap, finding the small hole in his faded jeans more interesting. “Everything,” he finally says.
Tony sighs. He might as well apologize too. “I’m sorry, too.”
“J, ‘m sleeping,” Tony mumbles and pulls the blankets over his head. He lets out a pleased sigh and relaxes, ready to drift off to dreamland again.
Bruce nods his head in agreement. “You did. And he’s the reason for it. You two make a good couple.”
“You look even better.”
The doors to the elevator open and Tony leads Steve out and toward their private quarters. As soon as they’re inside, Tony pulls Steve into his arms and crashes their lips together. Steve gasps against Tony’s lips.
Since having Morgan his life turned upside down and not for the reason he thought it would. He loved her more than anything, and yet a part of him wondered why he bothered having her if he was only going to hurt her.
Tony nods and turns back to his tablet. “I’ll get to it.”
“I don’t want to hurt you. I’ll be fine. Just go.”
His stomach churns and he stops in the entrance of the kitchen, taking a deep breath to calm himself.
Steve claimed he wasn’t hungry and made the decision to stay back in their apartment. Tony didn’t question it at first, figuring his husband just wanted some time to sleep in. Morgan had been fussy again and though Tony made more attempts to get up and help, he found he wasn’t as helpful as he intended to be. He could change diapers and rock her back to sleep, but Steve was still doing all the feedings, and most times Morgan refused to latch on.
He decides he needs a little space of his own, and luckily his uncle doesn’t protest.
“Twelve hours,” Steve replies and he smiles sheepishly when he catches Tony staring. “The serum helps me heal. I thought I mentioned that.”
“I do want to help,” Flash eventually says. “I’m not that big of an asshole.”
It was better that way. He didn’t want to be known as the omega that sacrificed his life to defend others, only to end up dying for nothing and being resurrected into a world of horrors. How would it look? He had been fighting for omegas and their rights. He didn’t believe in alphas having absolute control over everything. And yet he allowed one alpha to control every aspect of his life.
“I guess this is the part where you want me to say you were right and I was wrong?” Tony questions and Steve chuckles. “Fine. You were right. He’s not so bad. Happy now?”
Peter stops his rambling to catch his breath, the smile on his face faltering. He sighs sadly and adjusts flowers he brought with him, cursing to himself when the petals from one of the white roses falls to the ground.
It’s not until it’s time for cake does he excuse himself from a conversation with Pepper to get the dessert he’s prepared. He makes his way to the kitchen, his ears immediately picking up on the familiar voices of Tony and Bruce. Steve is ready to ask them for help until he picks up bits of their conversation.
“Have me back?” Peter frowns in confusion.
Tony sighs again. “How about Sarah? She can okay?”
“Okay.” Steve smiles and raises himself so he can kiss Tony on the lips. “I love you.”
Peter chuckles and searches for the white cat, frowning when he can’t find her. He’s sure she’ll show up at the foot of his bed later.
“I know,” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand again and this time the omega doesn’t pull away. “You are safe. He’s not coming back okay? He’s gone. I promise you’re safe from him. Your baby is safe from him.”
Tony’s chest rumbles with an alpha purr. He brings Steve in for another kiss, then places kisses on each corner of his mouth and then along his jaw and down to his neck. Steve shudders when his bond mark is teased and his fingers find purchase in Tony’s hair.
“I’m fine.” Steve waves him off. He doesn’t mention the pain in his stomach; it’s already gone away and he’s forgetting about it. “Let’s go.”
But it was too late to dwell on the what ifs. Tony couldn’t change the past, but he could change himself and make his future a little brighter.
It doesn’t take long until Steve is succumbing to the pleasure and reaches his release. He falls completely still and waits for the alpha to finish. Alpha thrusts a few more times until he comes with a grunt, his breath hot against Steve’s ear.
“I miss him. I miss him so much. God I wish I could go back and fix everything I did wrong.”
The door is locked and Tony lets out a sigh. He knocks on the door once. “Peter, open up. Come on, kiddo, let me in.”
Tony chuckles and wraps his arms around Steve’s waist, pulling him close and affectionately nuzzling their noses.
“I don’t mind. Do you need clothes or anything? I might have something.”
The pup only frowns and cocks his head. “Ma-” is all he can say. It brings a smile to Steve’s face anyway.
Peter only begins to fuss when Steve gets him dressed. He kicks his legs, making fastening the little buttons difficult, but Steve manages, feeling proud of himself once Peter is dressed for bed.
“You know he’s not gonna respond.” Comes a familiar voice. Steve glances up, his face lighting up when he finds his best friend entering the room.
“Okay. Relax.” Tony pats the bodyguard gently on the shoulder. “I’ll check on him,” he says and reaches for the handle on the side of the door.
“Guess you’re awake too, huh?” Steve laughs when his son kicks in response.
“Why?” Steve has stopped sketching to frown at Tony instead.
“I’m fine. I just-I can’t. Tony, I don’t want to hurt her anymore.”
“Yeah. I guess.”
The thought never leaves his mind though and once Tony is asleep, he untangles himself from his husband’s arms and sneaks away to the bathroom. He shuts the door quietly behind him.
“I know. But you’re tired too.”
He’s complied and gave in, but the alpha still hurts him. Steve cries out when he’s kicked roughly in the face, his nose gushing with blood. Steve spits the liquid from his mouth, decorating the dull gray floor beneath him with crimson.
“Whatever you say, bossy pants,” Sam says, then a mischievous look spreads across his face and he pulls Bucky close again. “You know...with Pete out of the house...you and I could…” Sam waggles his eyebrows suggestively.
“You can. Steve wouldn’t want you hurting like this, especially not on his birthday. He’s still here with us, Bucky. I bet he’s watching over you right now and wondering why you decided to get a cat.”
Pepper smiles softly. “Good changes, I hope.”
“Your dad said the same thing and never did.” Steve chuckles and rises to his feet. “You might find it interesting.”
“You’re good at building things.”
“Eyes.” Peter touches one of Steve’s eyes and then touches his own.
“Um sort of. You knew my father. You guys worked together and-”
“What’s wrong, Maguna?” Her dad’s voice snaps her from her thoughts and she turns toward him. She hadn’t realized she had zoned out.
Happy scowls and points a threatening finger at the alpha. “I quit, Tony! I quit! Your pups are-”
Steve frowns. “You helped.”
Tony steps out of the room, not surprised to find Happy still guarding his post. Tony rolls his eyes.
“I am. I’m feeling better.”
“Daddy?” Peter asks.
“Not right away. I know you’re hesitant to leave, but maybe in a couple of weeks we can start preparing. That kid’s gonna be here soon.”
“You said yourself that something like this shouldn’t have happened. It’s not your fault okay? We’re getting to bring him home soon and I promise everything is going to be fine once he’s here.”
Tears flood Steve’s eyes and a few escape and stream down his face. There had been no updates since their son was taken away to be looked over. Surely they would’ve heard something by now. It didn’t take the staff long to clean Peter up and swaddle him in a blanket. But of course Peter had been monitored for the entire pregnancy. The other baby hadn’t.
He tries anyway. He made a promise to be there for him.
Then there was the last night they saw each other. Steve had been heavily pregnant then. Tony doesn’t blame Steve for that night, even though a part of him wants to. It had been him who had ignored Steve when he had been trying to tell him about their son. Tony had let his anger and disappointment get the best of him.
“Is he?” Steve smiles down at his son once he finds him fast asleep.
“Okay.”
“I can help you out,” Sam offers and Steve nods. “What do you like to do? Read, work out, watch bad tv? What’s your hobbies?”
“I can’t. I’m tired, Tony. I’m so tired. I can’t. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
It’s been years since he escaped Hydra with his life and rid himself of the alpha that abused him. The nightmares weren’t as frequent as they used to be, but occasionally sleep was interrupted by one. Steve thought after two years he’d be able to go a full night without the nightmares.
Here’s when it gets worse so warning! If any of this is too much then please don’t read. I totally understand.
Tony decides to be the bigger person and greet them, but before he can form any words, Clint is beating him to it and speaking first.
“It’s not fine,” Natasha says, reading him like she always has. “You’re scared.”
Peter is screaming for Bucky to stop, and Sam and Natasha wrestle to get Bucky off Tony. Their efforts prove futile, and it’s Peter who breaks up the fight. The sticky web latches onto Bucky’s arm, and Peter pulls roughly, gritting his teeth as he struggles to pull his uncle’s arm away from his dad’s face.
“Not until I’m retired,” the omega shoots back.
“Then why does it feel like it is? I was there on that stupid mission and I ran away like a coward. I’m not a hero. I’m not an Avenger. Papa was wrong about me.”
A smile forms over Tony’s face and pulls Steve into another kiss. They’re forced to pull apart when Peter squirms between them.
“No, I want you.”
“Jarvis?” He says before fully exiting the room. “Keep an eye on him please.”
A shaky breath leaves him when Tony reaches for the door knob and turns it. The door creaks loudly when it’s opened all the way. The apartment is quiet; the silence is unsettling.
“Will you stop saying that! I did have a choice and I made the wrong one! You know I’d like to consider myself a pretty good guy but maybe I’m not. Maybe I’m just like that alpha you’re running from. Maybe I’m worse than him.”
“SHIELD?”
“Hey yourself,” Tony says and pecks Steve on the lips. “I missed you and the kids today. Are they already asleep?”
Steve brings his baby close, and places a kiss along his wet, sticky hair. Peter’s cries die down; he senses his mother.
“He’s a good kid, sir,” Jarvis finally decided to speak up.
It’s cheesy, he knows this, and yet he can’t help it. He loved Steve, more than he should. They were just teammates, maybe even friends. But lovers? Nah. That would never happen.
Sam smiles softly and lowers himself down beside his nephew. “This scene has definitely played out before.”
Steve smiles softly. “Thank you, Tony,” he says and he places a hand over his belly. “I think we’re warming up.”
“We-we mated? No. I don’t think so. I would remember if you and I-”
Steve turns toward his best friend. “It’s okay. I wanted to go home,” he says and turns back to his son. “And I am. I’m home.”
Peter was quiet. It wasn’t unusual to find the boy so reserved; he was naturally shy and only came out of his shell once he was comfortable. Bucky had expected his nephew to be talking his ear off about
“I gave him the sketch,” Sam says, and everyone glances in his direction. “I...I figured now would’ve been a good time. He needed something positive today.”
“Dammit, Tony-”
Their relationship wasn’t perfect, in fact it was far from it. It was always going to be rocky and eventually crumble, but Steve had hope. They had managed to become friends, and maybe if they worked hard, that friendship would progress to more.
“Pete!” His papa’s voice startles him awake. Peter groans and buries his face in the pillow. The door to his room opens and Peter knows he won’t be getting any sleep. “Come on, bud, get up. You need to get ready.”
“I know. But I mean we kinda knew this. You don’t regret this do you?”
“I’m feeling a lot better now that you’re here. Trust me,” Tony smiles.
“Oh...right. I guess we never discussed how living arrangements are going to work.”
“Welcome back, Cap.”
Tony scoffs. “Not with that attitude. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”
Steve was not the biggest fan of Halloween. Fall was his favorite season. He enjoyed the cool, crisp mornings and the warm, spicy drinks. The sweaters he wore were always soft and comfortable. Tony’s lost count of how many times he’s taken Steve apple picking. The man loved this time of year, but not the way Tony did.
But now he was breaking the promise he made to himself. He hated to admit it, but he needed Tony right now. Their son needed him.
“Ignore this. Bucky and I were...figuring things out.” Sam immediately begins picking up around the room. Peter’s brow raises when he notices a small pile of baby items. He recognizes a few of his old baby stuff mixed in.
“Just a few more weeks,” Tony assures when he catches the wince across his husband’s face.
Tony doesn’t know what to say and instead he nods. He turns away to hide his tears. Being here, in front of Steve’s grave, was still too difficult. He didn’t understand how the kid came here everyday.
Steve eyes the strangers closely, a low growl rumbling deep in his chest. He clings to his pup tightly, baring his teeth when the alpha gets too close. She doesn’t growl back to show dominance over him, and instead completely ignores his warnings and comes closer, bright green eyes roaming over his dirty and bloody form.
Peter sighs and gets up from the bed to look for something to wear before he’s late for school. “No,” he says as he rummages through his dresser, tossing clothes over his shoulder as he searches for something that is both appropriate for school and his protruding middle.
They’re finally able to start working on the nursery, and it’s Tony’s turn to want to make things simple. The mansion wasn’t their home, at least not really. They’d be moving back to New York once Peter was born and it was there where they’d raise their son. The nursery at the mansion didn’t have to be extravagant when Peter’s room was back at the tower.
Tony sighs. “I just want to give you some space. I’ve probably come on too strong and...yeah. I’ll be in my lab if you need anything. Jarvis can probably help too so…”
“Is something happening between you two?” Steve asks, and he waggles his eyebrows in a teasing manner. Peter groans and covers his face with his hands, wishing he could just sink through the bed and disappear.
“Great,” Tony says with a roll of his eyes. He rises to his feet. “I’ll be right down. Oh and let Pepper know to cancel the call and the meeting with the interns. Something came up.”
“Shh. I don’t care about any of that. I think you’re beautiful, even more now than before. I don’t want to rush you. Baby steps, remember?”
Morgan tunes the rest out. They weren’t talking about her at all. It was always going to be her brothers. She didn’t matter. They forgot about her.
The doctor isn’t his usual doctor, doesn’t even come close, but he would have to do. Steve doesn’t even look up at him when he mentions getting Steve something for pain. It wouldn’t matter. Nothing could truly take away the pain he was feeling.
“You do. Come on, Stevie I can see it. Everyone can. I just think maybe you and him should talk.”
“Yeah.” Steve smiles softly. “Me too.”
When his latest session is over and the room has cleared out, Steve works quickly to organize the space and get back home. He hasn’t heard a single thing from his mate, something that never happens. Tony was usually sending Steve updates or cute photos of the kids. Not hearing from Tony only makes Steve feel worse.
“It wasn’t your fault.”
“It’s okay,” Steve assures. “If we get back now we can still have cake.”
“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Steve holds out a hand to her. “I-I-”
“No. No. Absolutely not! What are you thinking!”
“I don’t know!” Steve continues to sob. “We were fine and now...now he’s like this and I don’t know what to do. Tony, help me!”
“Well a girl would be-”
Tears gather in his eyes and a choked sob escapes him. His legs wobble again and this time he’s unable to hold himself up. He falls to the floor, his head hitting the edge of the bed. The flare of pain doesn’t affect him. Not when he was feeling something more painful.
He had his suspicions, back when unusual symptoms began to make themselves known. He had pushed the reason behind his sudden illness aside, not wanting to believe that the night he shared with Tony all those weeks ago could result in this. It wasn’t until he confided in Natasha did she suggest he take the test.
But no really I’m not. I just like throwing in some drama here and there. This story just happens to have a lot of it 😏
Sam takes his husband’s hand to calm him, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “He’s fine. Peter always catches up to him.”
“You’re just jealous.” Tony directs his attention on the screen and his face lights up at the image staring back at him. “Wow...a boy. Shit.”
“Don’t.”
Peter replies quickly and shoves his phone back into his pocket. He takes it out a second later and opens up the chat, fingers hovering over the keyboard as he contemplates to tell his papa to come get him.
“I know what you’re doing,” Steve says, his voice taking on a dark tone. His eyes narrow in the beta’s direction. “I’m not a whack job. I’m not someone looking for money or whatever it is you think I’m here for. I wasn’t even looking for you,” those last words are directed at Tony. “I’m just trying to get by in a world I don’t even recognize. I’m just trying to take care of my pup, and I don’t need anyone’s help to do that.”
It’s a risky plan.
“You’re so cheesy.”
“True,” Bruce nods in agreement. “He thought it was…something else.”
“I got her,” Tony says when Steve makes an attempt to get up.
“And you said you don’t know how far along you are?” Bruce presses the transducer to Steve’s belly and the screen of the ultrasound machine lights up. “Did your old doctor tell you anything?”
Steve can’t help but grimace. His own stomach churns violently. “I’m gonna get you some water and uh…”
“I’m so sorry, dad,” Peter says sadly, his eyes filling up with tears again.
And that’s all Steve needs.
Steve nods and directs his attention toward the window, watching the city get further away as they near the compound. Being home suddenly doesn’t feel like a place he wants to be.
She keeps her eyes locked on his while she eats. Steve leans down to place a kiss to her head, not caring that she’s still covered in blood and other fluids from the birth.
“You can’t get-now that’s one of the worst things I've ever heard. That must suck!”
Steve tucks Peter in for the fourth time, making sure he’s comfortable and has his favorite stuffed puppy. Peter smiles up at Steve and breaks free from the blankets to crawl into Steve’s lap.
“Alpine?”
“Not yet, but close. I think a suit would be a good motivator,” Steve says.
Tony nods and holds Steve tighter, letting him sob into his chest for as long as he needs to.
It’s a little after four when his last session finishes. A few group members stick around to chat or to express their excitement for the next meeting. Steve enjoyed his group’s enthusiasm. He remembered being nervous and unsure of himself for his first meeting. He’s come a long way since then.
“Hurt me. Do your worst,” Tony urges, “make me feel that pain too.”
Sam sighs. “Yes you do.”
The decision to stay home with the pups had been his idea. Tony was on board with it from the start. He knew it was Steve’s choice and he didn’t have a say in the matter. All he wanted was for his mate to be happy and to enjoy his second chance at life.
“He’s fine,” Tony is quick to assure and he brings Steve back for another kiss.
“I think I’m having second thoughts,” Tony admits as he finishes packing his bags. He probably shouldn’t have waited for the day of the trip to actually pack, but lately his mind had been elsewhere. Luckily he had Steve to help him and remind him to pack essential items. “Is this a bad idea?”
“I know. I’m sorry. Tony, I’m so sorry.”
“Don’t apologize.”
“He’s all you left. He’s all you have left of Steve.”
“Fuck…”
Tony takes a deep breath and steps away to put some distance between them. Their mixed scents were strong, the foul, bitter stench penetrating the air.
Tony gives the omega one last look before turning away and shutting the door quietly behind him.
Steve huffs out a small laugh and his eyes flutter open. “You’re a terrible liar. I could hear you pacing for thirty minutes.”
His face burns from the blows he received and there’s a hint of copper in his mouth, but it’s nothing he hadn’t experienced before. Coming out of a mission unharmed was impossible.
“Thank you, Tony,” Happy beams. “I won’t let you down.”
“Then they see us. What are they going to do?”
Steve hums in agreement. “Remember the last time we did this?”
“I don’t need your help,” Steve says stubbornly. Tony sighs harshly. He knew how difficult his husband could be and in the past it was his stubbornness that led to some pretty nasty fights, but he was sure after their daughter’s birth that he would tone it down.
“Of course I'd make it. I’m not missing anymore, Pete. I promise.”
“I didn’t see that much. I swear!”
Dodger cocks his head to the side when Peter emits a tiny whimper. Steve is quick to swoop in and take Peter from the car seat and into his arms. He lowers himself onto the couch and works on getting Peter calm.
“It’s not that good.”
“It’s not your fault, Steve.”
“I was what? Against it?”
“And I know you’d never hurt him,” Sam says softly and kisses the top of Bucky’s head. “You need to not be so…”
Most of the questions are about his medical history, which thankfully his papa steps in to answer. Peter sits quietly, listening to the adults talk until their voices drone out and he’s left staring numbly at the poster across from him.
“Let me go!” Steve screams and he wrestles against the man pinning him down. Steve’s eyes go wide when his throat is gripped tightly. His body writhes against the alpha above him, his legs kick out and his arms fly up to try and push his abuser off. The room fills with the sound of the omega’s struggling.
“I’m sure you’re doing fine without me.”
Pepper nods, but Tony knows she can see right through him. Truth be told, he wants to take that next step with Steve. They had done everything backwards. Breaking up, having a baby, getting back together, and now moving in, wasn’t the direction Tony had envisioned them going. But now, he wouldn’t change anything.
After he’s tucked Harley back in and kisses his head, Steve checks on his oldest. Only James isn’t in his bed. Steve’s heart thumps wildly in his chest, his fear growing.
“Then why are you telling me? Because I sure as hell don’t want no kid.”
“He runs and I catch him. It’s my job.”
At least that’s what Tony had been trying to tell himself since he first set eyes on the super soldier. His plan was to play it cool and not allow himself to entertain the idea of him and Steve. For the most part it worked.
The last thing Tony expected was for Steve to want to try again. He had been sure that the loss of their son would’ve been enough to convince Steve that a baby just wasn’t going to happen. But he was wrong.
“Maybe,” Steve replies. “Something came up and…”
“Hey.” It’s Tony’s turn to take Steve’s face in his hands and brush away the tears that fall. “I know. I don’t blame you. I’m sorry I couldn’t do more.”
“Yep,” Steve grumbles out a response.
He argues with himself the whole way there, trying to convince himself to not follow through. But that voice wiggles its way back in and talks him out of it. It reminds him of how worthless he is. He was nothing. He was never going to get better. He might as well just give up.
Some days his phone alerts him of new messages from his dad, but Peter can’t bring himself to read any of them. He ignores the phone calls too.
If Tony thought Barton was a pain in the ass, then Steve was giving him a run for his money. The super soldier/ WW2 veteran was one of the most difficult people to work with. He didn’t bother keeping his opinions to himself, which in turn led to arguments. Steve was a stubborn jackass, and that was Tony just being nice when it came to describing his fellow teammate.
This time Peter does peer in her direction. He meets her eyes for a second before turning away and back down to his worn out sneakers.
“We know.” Steve smiles.
“Yay!” Peter cheers and throws his arms into the air. “This is going to be the bestest Halloween ever!”
He was terrified of what their reactions were going to be. They would be upset and disappointed and probably angry as hell. He was too young to have a baby. Of course they had been young and unprepared too when they had him, but Peter felt it would be different this time. They didn’t want this for him.
“Have a seat,” Tony gestures to the chair in front of his desk. He sits down in his own chair. He doesn’t miss the way the other alpha’s eyes roam over him.
“6 it is. Hop in.” Tony gestures to the car and Peter’s eyes widen in surprise.
“What! He’s here!”
“What made me give it away?”
Peter is snapped from his thoughts when Ned elbows him in the side. He glances up and turns toward his friend, ready to question him, then Ned is pointing and Peter follows his gaze.
“Yeah. I’ll worry about it later. I just want to take care of everything else and get back to you as soon as I can.”
“Are you kidding? I can’t wait to have another baby. Peter and Dodger are going to be amazing big brothers.”
“Thank you,” Steve says quietly and takes the offered drink.
Sam sighs and takes Bucky’s hand back into his own. It doesn’t completely calm him, but it quiets him down again.
“You make me happy,” Tony says softly once they break apart. “You and Pete. I didn’t know I could ever feel like this. It’s cheesy, I know, but I don’t know how else to explain it. I love you, Steve. So much.”
“Submit!” Steve orders, applying more pressure to the back of the alpha’s head, sharp nails digging into the flesh until the alpha is screaming again. Steve pulls his hand away, not caring that his fingers are red with the alpha’s blood.
Happy had said Tony was on his way back, but the lack of communication on Tony’s part was worrisome. The time zone didn’t help and he wonders if maybe his husband had dozed off on the flight home. Steve would understand if he did. Tony was working harder than ever.
, Steve thinks to himself. He doesn’t voice that thought out loud though. Tony hasn’t said if he liked the idea, which made Steve believe that it wasn’t a thought Tony had. Marriage didn’t seem like Tony Stark’s style. Or at least that’s what Steve used to believe. He didn’t think Tony was into a serious relationship or becoming a father. But Tony had proved Steve wrong on both accounts.
“They’re good,” Steve can’t help but smile at the thought of his pups. “They’ve actually discovered a new show.”
“I hope you can shorten it. Pepper wants this thing to only last ten minutes.”
Just thinking about his last night with Alpha makes him almost lose his appetite. He shuts his eyes, a shaky breath leaving him when he’s forced to endure that night. He can almost smell him, can almost feel his touch. Steve shudders at the memory and he wraps both arms around himself. He never wants to think about that night again. And maybe he’ll never have to. He was a free omega now.
“And what? We still weren’t ready. I gave up a lot but I don’t regret our son. We have to be there for him.”
When he comes to, he’s unable to tell how much time has passed. He does notice one thing, the sack has been removed from his head and he’s being escorted inside Hydra’s new hiding spot. Tony is being held down by two alphas and led down a corridor opposite from Steve.
“It’s okay. He’s...better. I think meeting you helped. I had been worried about him. Steve was all he had.”
But Tony’s not like them and he wants to make Steve comfortable. Sure he was the one going into a rut, but this moment was about Steve and making it special for him. Tony promised he wouldn’t hurt him anymore. He’d show him love. He’d show him how this moment was supposed to be.
But he couldn’t go back to that. It was a mistake rushing into that relationship. They still didn’t really know each other. Peter had been blinded, only seeing what he thought was good. And maybe his dad wasn’t a bad guy, but he wasn’t the person Peter had dreamt about.
“You’ve made it this far and it’s been fine. I know it’s not ideal not having Stark but-do you want my honest input?”
“Yes! Everything’s good. We’re getting along and raising our son. Marriage isn’t even on the table.”
“I have something better, Brucie. Jarvis is going to perform the scan.”
The event is everything Tony expected it to be. The large ballroom is full of people dressed in their best attire, drinks are being served by tuxedo waiters and music is being played by a live band. Tony’s been to one of these before, more times than he can count.
Bucky eyes him closely, not fully believing him, but he doesn’t say anymore.
“I know. We can always shop online.”
“Hey, he’s okay,” Tony assures when they’re in the backseat of the car.
Peter glances down at his lap, pulling a piece of thread from his jeans and toying with it. He had been waiting years to meet his dad and get to know him, and now that they’re in the same space, the hype isn’t there.
Steve frowns as he listens to Tony and Pepper speak. The meeting was called to discuss what to do about Steve and the four pups that have magical appeared in Tony's life. Steve is still hesitant to come forward and face the world. It's been so long since he's been in it.
Tony ignores her. “He can’t be dead. He…”
The lock on the door clicks, startling Steve and sending a wave of fear through him. He sits up, readying himself to comply. The door opens and two alphas step inside. Steve can’t help but growl at the sight of them.
“I know it’s not something you’re used to,” Steve says and Tony glances up at him. “You probably usually get more tasteful things but...I hope you like it anyway.”
Flash inhales sharply and his hands roll into a tight fist. “And then everyone will know-”
, he tells himself but the frown on his face remains. How Steve fails to notice is beyond him. Perhaps his husband was just over the moon excited. They had been thinking about starting a family for a while now. Correction. Steve had been thinking about children. Tony made up his mind long ago that he didn’t want kids.
“Hey! Sometimes I sleep in or I just want to spend more time with my two favorite people.”
“It’s good. You can cook.”
“You’re making fun of me.”
Steve chuckles and leans in to peck Tony on the cheek.
“Leave me alone!” Morgan yanks herself free from his grasp and runs up the stairs. He doesn’t go after her either.
“You’re still in your costume,” Steve whispers.
“I didn’t mean it like that. Well, I mean they both can be exhausting. You know what I’ll go now. Sleep tight, Pete.”
“Sorry,” Tony apologizes. He had spaced the order too. Steve wasn’t the only one trying to adjust to their new life. “I can help move some of the stuff in...your place?” Tony’s not sure why he says it like a question. It was obvious the baby would be living with Steve.
“Okay. No stress, got it. So we’re getting close, right? That’s what this means?”
“You’re good. I’m pretty sure whatever you’re about to say is true.”
“Tony?” Steve sounds unsure, and maybe a little afraid. He turns his head, ears straining to pick up any sounds of Tony. He has to rely on his other senses now.
His hand finds its way to Steve’s belly, and he rubs the area soothingly. A smile forms over his face at the thought of their child growing just beneath his fingertips. In just a few months they would be welcoming the new baby and extending their family. It was an exciting time.
Time appears to be passing slowly after that. They’re left panting heavily and wondering what the hell just happened. Or at least that’s what Tony’s thinking. Through his drunken haze he’s still able to comprehend the situation he’s found himself in. Fuck. He shouldn’t have slept with Steve. What did he just do?
“I don’t trust him.”
Peter stands above him, a smirk written on his face. “You were saying, Pops?”
Just like Peter promised, he leads Ned up to his room and shouts to his parents that they’ll be doing homework before shutting the door. Ned sits down on the bed and anxiously waits for Peter to tell him what was so important that it had to wait for right now.
“It’s fine,” Peter says.
“Sorry. I guess I just assumed-”
“I know. But you’re making a human being. No one said it was going to be easy.”
“I’m not lying, Omega. Your pups are dead and you killed them.”
I’m so so sorry it’s taking me so long to update. My job has me working insane hours for the holiday and I haven’t had any time to do anything. I barely finished this chapter last night on my lunch break. 🤦♀️ Anyway it’s kinda long so hope that helps! Thank you guys for being amazing and so patient with me! I swear I’ll find time to write! ❤️❤️❤️
“Do you like it so far? It still needs work and a color scheme.”
The room has grown quiet; everyone has stopped talking and Steve was sure if he looked up he’d find them staring at him. He makes sure to keep his head down, pretending to find the blue and white tissue paper interesting.
