“He’s part angel,” Castiel says, although he knows how little weight that really has.
He thinks. This answer feels like it should be important, like it should matter. He finds, after some thought, that it doesn’t.
“And you don’t remember what happened in that park? When you were hurt?”
In any case, when he next looks away from the screen, Sam is gone. He reaches out and finds no human life in the Bunker. Ah. Sam was possibly telling him about a case. It looks as though he did not intend to ask Castiel to come along.
If I've already had Sam know some of the stuff here before, and have simply got mixed up (given I do like to write Sam finding out about this and have written it in at least one other fic I'm working on), please PM me on tumblr and let me know. I'll catch it eventually, but right now my head is too fuzzy and I just want to post this.
************************************
“You listen to me,” Dean says, and only briefly flicks his gaze at the others before narrowing his focus to Cas. It’s so obvious Dean’s tuned the rest of them out that Beth feels almost wrong to still be sitting there. She wonders how Sam stands it, if this is a normal thing for them. “You’ve done plenty, yes, and it’s all been to help, and you have helped. Cas, you’ve saved the world, and for what it’s worth you’ve saved me, and Sam. And Beth and Val, too. That counts. Okay?”
“Aidan? Shit. He’s spaced out. How badly is he hurt?”
Dean doesn’t answer, but now Riva’s there, brushing past Beth and kneeling to check Val over. It’s only a moment before she directs Dean to carry Val inside, and Beth finds she can’t follow them. Not right away. She’s stuck partway down her path, feeling her own breaths weigh heavy in her chest, and there’s a buzzing at the edges of her hearing.
“I’m sure it can,” Sam says, much more smoothly than Beth would have managed.
Apparently bored of waiting, Dean stalked past them and disappeared into the mist, not looking back to see who was coming. He must have known they’d all follow him. Or else he didn’t care.
Dean looks torn between irritation and amusement as he looks at Cas.
Sam shrugs, and Beth stops beside him and looks up at him with something that might even be edging towards sympathy. There’s still wariness there, but it isn’t the full-blown thing Dean saw on her face the first time they met.
“With the monster hunting,” Val says.
“I’m not saying I would. But…” She shifts on her feet, looking unsettled. “Look, can I just ask? You don’t have to answer. All right?”
What chapter length consistency? Who cares about that? Not me, apparently.
“Over you, Dean,” Sam says. “Cas watched over you. Not us. Sure, he’s saved me, too. Hell, he took Lucifer out of my mind. But that whole watching over thing? That was between the two of you.”
“We don’t know that,” Beth says.
“What he’s like.”
She says the last word oddly, with an element of doubt.
“Knee,” she says, through gritted teeth. “Monster. Cas.”
“Yeah, well. Memory loss is a symptom of running into whatever this fucker is,” Dean says. “Maybe it can mess with people’s heads in other ways.”
“I wanted to help,” Castiel says quietly, uneasily.
Bela coughed when Sam and Hannah stared at each other.
“Bit late for that, now,” Val says.
There’s nothing little about Cas, but Beth doesn’t correct him. When you’re Dean’s height, maybe even someone as tall as Cas seems small. Or maybe it’s just Dean’s way of making Cas small enough to fit inside Dean’s head. She’s having enough of an issue with what it can really mean, to have an angel as a guest under her roof. Shouldn’t it mean her crops grow plentiful or something? She’s almost sure there should be quickening involved.
“I wonder,” he says, a few moments later, and leans back over the tablet without explaining what it is he’s wondering.
“Hannah?” Cas asked. “How are you…? You’re alive.”
“No?” Hannah asks.
He looks away. He does that a lot.
“You know this isn’t your fault, right?” Beth asks, because she doesn’t want to disturb Cas, but she can’t stand seeing Val like this.
“Yes,” Inanna says. “Because I want to dance. And I want a drink. And there’s nothing you can do anyway. If Castiel is coming back, it’s out of your hands now.”
“That makes more sense than you ever feeling you have a gender, really,” she says. “I mean, you don’t when you’re being a ray of light, do you?”
*************************************
Without meaning to, Dean smiled, a quirk of his lips he knew could come across as cocky or leering. He wasn’t wanting either one, but he couldn’t straighten his mouth out.
“Have a seat, Cas,” Dean said, sweeping his arm out in invitation.
“You can’t be serious,” he says. “You think I’m leaving this spot until Cas comes back?”
The film isn’t over before he feels Dean sag against him, feels his weight grow and his breathing even out. Shortly after, Sam leans in and speaks quietly in Castiel’s ear.
The moonlight falls across her face and she looks nowhere near as definite as she sounds. Her expression fits more into what Castiel has learned means she’s worried.
He pulls his hands out of the way and waits until Sam has Cas safely out and in his arms. It feels wrong, letting Sam carry Cas like that, but Dean’s got a fine tremble under his skin, running deep into his muscles, and he knows he’s not in a fit state to be doing that job.
“Sammy,” Dean called, turning his steps in Sam’s direction and covering the ground less quickly than he normally would. Probably not wanting the demons to think there was any panic there. “You drop by for a family dinner I forget about? Or did you just come down here to congratulate me on my new gig?”
“You passed out standing up?” Dean asks.
They both watch Tanya make the truck carry the car across the carpet for a few minutes before Hannah speaks again.
And she won’t move from that opinion.
“Sam’s keeping an eye on Dean,” Val says, sounding disgusted.
Dean turns to Sam as though Sam will have an explanation, but Sam shrugs.
From there, it is easy enough to disappear.
Sam’s breath is heaving, his chest inflating and deflating enough he can feel it move, and he hasn’t wanted to hit out at something so much in months. Maybe years. He’s worked on his anger, but it’s always bubbling away underneath, less obvious than Dean’s but more deadly.
The thought follows him down, and he just has time to feel surprise before sleep claims him.
“But Cas can take it. All right? He knows it’s not like that.”
Sam waits. No way is Dean in a fit state to hear him just now, not with that glazed, defeated look on his face. And they have to play this right. Dean hasn’t ever let himself really get how diminished Cas is, how far he’s fallen. Even when Cas was fighting on with borrowed Grace, Dean acted like the angel was indestructible.
“I didn’t take an angel as a lover myself,” Inanna says. “Well. Not as such. Not for more than a night. Three at the most.”
*************************
Sam startled at Hannah’s hand on his arm. Turning, he found the angel shaking her head, looking concerned.
So Sam doesn’t worry and Sam doesn’t mourn. Sam plans. Because there’s no way his brothers are going to lose each other, not when he’s finally seen them start to get their shit together.
He heard Cas take a sharp breath as Dean sank to his knees. Interesting. The guy clearly had some understanding, and some expectations. Dean would have to remember that.
“Sam.”
This time, she moves closer, staring up at him with clear, gray eyes. Everything about her is gray, and maybe that should be lifeless, but it’s not. It seems…restful. Calm. Just another phase, instead of an end.
There was a sway to Dean’s body that hadn’t been there before, and he ran his hands down his torso and over his hips in a move Bela was sure was more at home on a certain type of stage. This was not the Dean she was used to, cocky and flustered by turns. This Dean was at home in his body and not afraid to use it.
“Hey, who needs a break?” Dean asks. “Because I need food and some air. I’m going to lose it if I have to sit here for much longer.”
He finds her so easily he wonders, for a moment, if God is helping him after all. It’s round the corner and there she is, huddled in a new coat that already looks grubby with her hands shoved in her own armpits, like that’ll do anything this time of year. She looks at him warily as he approaches, her whole stance saying she’s ready to run but doesn’t have the energy to do it too soon.
There it is again, that hesitation over the name. Nora only gives it a moment before she folds the thought away. Some people want a different name, or a different life, or they don’t have a choice in it. Or maybe it’s a nickname Hannah’s more used to using. Whatever it is, the woman’s respecting her brother’s choice to use ‘Steve’ here, and Nora isn’t going to make things awkward.
“Maybe,” Dean says. He closes his eyes for a moment, and when he opens them he seems under control. “But I didn’t know how bad it was, and I didn’t take enough time to ask. So go through it again, and this time tell me when it got worse. Tell me what might have made your eyes go dark. Tell me anything I might need to know so we can work this out.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Having been on the road for almost a week now, with Eileen, Sam couldn’t help but think back at how this used to be their life. The road had never been safe. Never welcoming. But always home. He still enjoyed the road, on occasion. But it was no longer home. No longer a highway without a destination. Their family, the family they had made along the way, that was their home now.
The silence takes a stronghold of the day, and although the world continues on with their lives, the remaining Winchester’s spend the day with silent tears. Silent words.
«Cas!» Dean comes running towards him. Embracing him when he gets close enough. For a moment Cas leans into the embrace, imagining for a moment that it´s
Dean doesn’t even turn to look at them, only moving closer to the black hole in the wall. He stops in front of it, lingering at the edge of the emptiness ahead.
When he’s fully dressed, Dean looks over his shoulder to see the door still closed and walks back to the bed. Leaning down and placing his arms on each side of Cas he gently strokes his neck with his nose, earning a smile and humming noise from his man.
Dean is about to move closer to Cas, but the Shadow moves quicker. Suddenly the other `Dean’ is standing behind Cas. And as he places his hand on top of Cas’s head, the angel collapses at their feet.
Its everything.
Dean isn’t gone for long, but as he returns to his bedroom, hands nervously carrying a tray with two plates filled with food, Cas is already sound asleep. He sets down the tray on his desk, moving to spread his blanket over the resting body. Dean's hand lingers by his face, gently stroking it before he takes some of the food from his plate.
«One could almost believe that the broken road always has been leading them together. I’ve never seen anyone love someone the way they love each other. And yet they are both too stupid and blind to realize that that love is most definitely reciprocated. Those stupid idiots can’t see what’s been right in front of their noses, literally, for over a decade, even though they spent half their time together, staring into each others eyes, making it hella uncomfortable for anyone else in the room. Believe me, I know.» She laughs at that, making him laugh too because he knows that she knows exactly what he’s talking about.
«Heya, Jack. You there kid?» Dean lowers his head as tears stings his eyes. Every night, he would pray to Cas. Each night so filled with hope that the disappointment of always being left feeling more empty, still took him by surprise. He would pray to Jack too, not every night like with Cas, but he found more comfort in talking to Jack these days. «I know you are busy, and I know you would have helped if you knew how to. But… if… if there is anything,
«You know. Dean sees his life as a broken road, one that he is destined to follow. There are no exits, nowhere to pull the car in another direction. So all he does is keep on driving.» Sam watches the town in front of them. He goes quiet for a while until he continues, his voice is more distant as his mind is somewhere else. «He’s been on this road all his life. Dean has been by my side
«We´re all ready.» Charlie and Eileen come through the door, both beaming with joy. «Are you ready, Dean? Cas is waiting for you.»
«It is true, Miracle is very cute, indeed.» At the sound of his name, Mir comes running down the hall. He stops in front of them, but when he sees that the bedroom door is open, he sneaks into the room, jumping to the bed. «But, you are very cute too. Cute. Just like your freckles. Adorable like your smile. Gorgeous like your eyes. Beautiful. Beautiful, Dean Winchester.»
«Well, I am God, so…» That makes them both chuckle a little before Jack breaks the silence again. «At first I might not have seen it, but then again I’m not exactly an expert on human emotion. But it was always there, your love, and when you told me how he was taken, I knew. I've always known you were his happiness, but it was only then that I was certain of
“We’ve been sleeping for three days.” Dean has to chuckle at the expression Cas gives him. “Yeah... let's not do that again. The whole spent-way-too-long-in-a-empty-void.”
“And whoever gets to hold your love, they have to be the luckiest soul on earth. I love you and I’m sorry this is the way I told you, I wasn’t supposed to tell you, and I’m sorry. But that doesn’t matter, I’m happy for you. Your happiness is all that matters.”
Still Dean Winchester.
Along with training and helping out the hunters, they would also start uploading and organizing the Men of Letters library to a hunters-only online network, that every hunter would have access to. It would make things easier for many, although Sam knows that some would curse them for «ruining» the business with modern technology and all that. But if it could save lives, Sam didn’t care about that because the meaning of the whole hunting business, was just that.
“We should probably get going.”
It doesn’t take long, only a few heartbeats, not even a minute, passes, before he can hear quiet and light footsteps coming closer. When the silence once more takes hold Dean's smile widens as he stands up. A gentle and warm hand touches him, knitting their fingers together. Dean turns towards his husband, his face as young as when they first met, moving closer to him they melt against each other.
«I for sure didn’t know of this place...”
“Cas...”
Where the blue of the sky touches the green of the earth, a fire is set once more. Flames that can never be tamed. In no life. In no world.
“Good boy! Yeah, good boy!” When he looks back up at Cas, he smiles fondly. “Cas, I want you to meet Miracle. Mir, this is Cas. Yeah
The song continues flowing through the car as they continue down the dirt road.
Dean’s eyes tears up and he almost curses himself when he can’t stop one from falling from his eye. He only has eyes for Cas, so he doesn’t really notice when Sam gently touches Jack's arm, both standing from the bed and quietly leaving the room.
Sam wakes the next morning to the sound of rain, the room cooler than it was the night before. With a small shiver, he pulls Eileen closer, hugging her closer to his chest. A small and tired «morning» escapes her lips and all he can do is smile brightly at her as he kisses her forehead. Neither of them really wants to get up, both wanting to just stay like this for as long as possible.
«I’m not really hungry, so I think I’m gonna go to bed. But you go get yourself something to eat. I’ll text you the room number when I’ve checked in.» Sam says to his brother and Cas, as he smiles at them over the roof of the impala.
The Shadow.
Cas could not see his soul. And his eyes. They weren’t right. The Shadow never managed to get his eyes right. They were slightly the wrong shade of green. He never managed to get the pattern of freckles right either. Cas knew the pattern better than he knew his own name. So the eyes and the freckles always revealed it to be the Shadow.
“You’re okay Cas, I’m here.” Dean rests a hand at the other man’s shoulder.
This is going to break him.
“Cas?” He whispers, the angel gives him a quiet and soft humming noise in response. Dean reaches out a hesitant hand, lays it against Cas’s face, his thumb gently stroking the space under his eye. His blue eyes locked on his green ones. “Can I...?”
«Good night, angel.»
«Do you… do you want me to stay here?» Cas´s voice sounds unsure as he stops in front of Dean's door, and as Dean turns to face him, he can see it on his face too. «I could sleep in my own room if you want to sleep alone.»
He should have said it already.
no matter how small a thing, that could help him, please come tell me.»
When Cas had been controlled by Naomi, and he was about to kill Dean. When Dean was pleading for Cas to fight it, to fight back, he had almost said the words. The words had been on his lips, but they were never spoken. And then Cas broke free, something had broken the connection, and Dean almost, for a moment, though maybe his feelings were returned. He almost said the words then, but he was too much of a coward. So he tucked them away, both the feelings and the words.
“Finally something we can agree on, Castiel.” The name sounds wrong coming from the Shadow.
Their touches have become a refuge in a broken world.
Sam thinks as he just stares at her
«Dean...»
After a long moment of staring, Dean can’t take it anymore. If he can’t tell him… maybe he can show him…
«So… how are things between you and Cas?» Sam asked from across the room, not looking up from the books he was sorting through.
The moment Dean catches Cas´s eyes, the world around him stops. He’s always been beautiful, but with the sight of him on the other side of the room and Cas´s blue eyes shining as they fall on him, Dean almost stops breathing. Dean has never seen anyone, or anything, as beautiful as his angel.
«Hello, Dean.»
With an encouraging smile from his brother, Dean surprises himself even more as he pours his heart out.
With wide, glassy eyes Cas takes a step closer to Dean, closing a distance that isn’t even there. With hands holding Dean tight, Dean can see Cas´s face crumbling with emotion before they both get lost in another kiss.
“Cas, you’ve always had me. You’re the only one who has ever truly had me. The only one that got me in every way possible. And I don’t want it any other way. I want you, and only you. I don’t know what you want to do with your life now that we are all free to actually live, but if you’ll have me, I’ll follow you wherever you go. And I know it's selfish of me to beg this of you, but please don´t leave me, stay with me forever. Don't leave me ever again." Dean pauses for a moment, breathless from his own words, the rawness of them. "I love you, Cas."
The first page is almost completely covered in black ink. The next is the same, except there are some spots on the almost white paper still visible. The third page is also covered in ink, but the fourth one holds two words on the center of the page:
Laying close together in the dark of their room, they fall into a sweet and peaceful sleep. Falling asleep in each other’s arms, night after night. Waking in each other’s tight embrace, day after day.
Pulled out another bottle of beer.
When it's time to leave the town, heading back home to the bunker, they are all tired after today's case. Dean only has eyes for Cas, so without looking at his brother over the roof of the impala, Dean points to the back seat.
His fingers dance around it, gently caressing the string of light that now becomes more bright as each moment passes. Dean searches out the pair of blue eyes again, still frozen in the place where he first found them. As the light reaches its brightest, Dean takes a careful hold of the strings of Cas’s soul, and tugging it towards him he gently embraces it, pulling it close against his chest.
, you will be loved until your dying breath, and even after that, you two will find your way back to each other. Love each other.»
«DEAN! Don´t you dare.» Cas starts laughing as Dean groans and buries his face in Cas´s neck. Only when there’s another knock at the door, does he raise from the bed, placing a gentle kiss at Cas´s cheek.
“Uhm, yeah sure. That would be nice, I haven’t talked to Claire in a while.”
«They do say that love blinds. And you two are proof of that.» At the look Dean gives them, Jack only smiles at him. «Everyone who knows you, everyone who has seen you together, have read your feelings for each other as if they were written on your face. But not you. You two blind yourself with the fear of rejection. The fear of being abandoned by the one thing that is keeping you afloat on a dark and stormy sea, when really it´s nothing to fear at all. There is no storm. The sun is shining brighter than ever. The sea is calm.»
«Hey Dean?!» Sam calls after him as he catches up with him in the hall, as Dean is about to enter his bedroom, «I… I need to talk to you about something.»
Forgetting the world, forgetting the time, forgetting where they were going, they stand there in each other’s embrace, only pulling away for the shortest second to draw in a breath, before diving back into each other.
All the threads lead to the same center, and as he reaches
The lips on his lips.
Dean though maybe the quiet would help him focus at the task at hand, but the loneliness slowly but surely creeps up on him as he stares at the pages of the maybe fifteen old books splayed over the table in front of him.
“Good morning?” Sam looks at his brother, confusion all over his face. Dean was never the first one to wake in the morning. Never waking this early. It almost made Sam a little worried.
He nods. His back’s straighter than normal and Val’s reminded of movies where a soldier’s being debriefed. They’ve still never talked about it, but Sam did mention serving.
“Don’t try to see it, Dean,” Cas says. “Let us handle this.”
“No,” Cas says. “I think…I think whatever is hunting in this town is affecting me. And…”
She only manages to move one leg a few inches before Cas’ eyes shoot open, his grip on her fingers tightening.
“We’ll be back tomorrow,” Sam says, sparing a fleeting thought to wish he didn’t sound so threatening.
Dean looks thoughtful, and after a few moments he nods.
“What, like, auto-immune?” Dean asks.
Panic loaned him the strength to jerk his body, trying to pull the chains from their tether above Dean’s head. If he could get down, if he could reach Cas, he could keep that Grace in himself. Until Sam found them. Cas could sleep, and Dean would keep him there.
“Someone will have to explain. Maybe it’ll know how to get back. Maybe not. I can’t recommend my method. I got stuck down in the underworld as a corpse.”
So, it might be a tad harder for Dean when he appears than it would have been, but Cas needs to work through a few issues, starting with how badly some things are for him right now.
They’re in the car within thirty minutes, Sam taking the wheel with a pointed look at Dean. He lets it go, but he glares at Sam. He refuses to so much as glance down at his hands. If he doesn’t see them shaking, he can pretend it isn’t real.
“Dean, I wasn’t in the same situation as you.”
Something of that must lace his words when he speaks.
Dean needn't think this is going to go easy for him. Sam neither. They want to help Cas, and they care, but they have got a great deal of work ahead of them.
“It wasn’t like that,” he says, clearly defensive. “You think I’m that much of a sleaze? The guy’s still hurting.”
She pushed down on that wriggling element of hope that this was all a ploy, that she’d see Hannah again. She couldn’t afford to think that way, even if she kept it to herself. Playing the role was important for her, too. If this did turn out to be Dean taking the throne, for real, and keeping it, then at least Bela had a place. A respected place, as far as it went.
********************
He’d drive on, but a glance in their direction shows a woman with a mass of long dark hair drop awkwardly to her hands and knees, and he might only have met few a few times, but…
“Bela,” Dean said, clicking his fingers.
“Are you doing okay?” Beth asks, softly.
“This time’s different.”
It’s an article on child abuse. It’s an article on how neglect is child abuse.
“So, Sam would know what Dean gets up to?”
“Dean, no… That isn’t what anyone said, about any of it.”
Well, she’s not sure about a lot of things. Some things are becoming clearer the more she lets herself think about them.
“Yeah. I know we got it for the main rooms, but I figure we can get a bigger one. He’s only getting a few hours a day, though.”
“Wouldn’t you be?” Val asks, and it might even be an honest question, like she isn’t sure if she’s having the right response.
“Cas?” Dean says. “You all right?”
As though Dean hasn’t told him to leave before.
It’s not a number he knows, which means it could be anyone. He answers non-committaly, just in case, avoiding names. There’s a pause before someone speaks and Sam doesn’t place the voice at first.
Castiel wants to curl them around himself, to shield himself with them the way he used to do in battle. But he can’t. He can’t because he still isn’t sure they’re really there and in any case he thinks that if he does hide in them he won’t ever unfurl them again.
“I’ll go get him,” she says. “I’m just going to assume you won’t watch anyone through the walls as a general thing, Cas.”
“There some law against it?” Dean shot back, stung.
Cas stiffens.
He’s sitting out in the dark and he isn’t sure why, or why he hurts. Trailing sticky fingers down his chest, he feels his wings curl around him, his brow furrow. There was something…some shape. No. He can’t hold onto the thought.
The sound of something clinking suggests she setting down plates.
“I’d need to explain it mathematically.”
Pulling in air he doesn’t need, Castiel pulls his wings up sharply, feeling the pain from the thing as it leeches into the evening. An angel’s wing can cut as well as its blade, but most things can’t be touched by them. This, whatever this is, can.
«I need to make up for all the times I didn’t say them. I’ve been such a coward all these years. Wanting to scream out the three hardest words I’ve ever known, every time I’ve looked at you. I was such a coward, keeping them to myself. I’m never doing that again.» Dean can see Cas´s eyes turn glassy as they softly smile at each other.
How Dean had managed to live his whole life without his touches, his lips, his warmth, is the biggest mystery of all. Now, having tasted them, Dean can not even imagine having to live without them for a day. Savoring the feel of their every kiss. Every embrace. Every moment. Dean tucks them safely into his heart for him to keep with him forever. Even forever won't be long enough for them.
«I miss him, so much. I miss both of you. I miss you, kid.»
“Okay.”
“What?” Looking back at Cas in confusion, Dean goes suddenly still, his nervous hands falling to his sides.
«Okay. Come on Cas, I saw a diner around the corner.» Dean closes the door, turning away from his brother, looking at the former angel.
“You think...”
“Yeah. That’s been there for over a decade. I’ve been third-wheeling them for so long I might actually explode soon.” He had to laugh at them again. It’s hilarious how these people who has spent less than a month in the bunker, had seen this so clearly when Dean and Cas hadn’t. “So, no they aren’t married, and they aren’t together as far as I know. But they’ll get there.”
«It's not really the best kept secret, you know. The fallen angel who fell in love with the faithless, but righteous man.» Jack smiles sadly at Dean. «He never did say anything, to anyone. But it was there. It was always there. You try to hide it too, but none of you are subtle when it comes to each other.»
«He told me he loved me, Sammy, and I let him die without telling him I love him too. I’ve never been so ashamed in my life. I didn’t tell him I love him.» He knows the words come out rougher than he meant, so carefully he moves his eye towards his brother, not knowing what to expect. Sam is watching him, waiting for him to continue. «I couldn’t tell you that, because I couldn’t even tell
“Don’t. Just say it again.”
«So, if we could get ´em here we could start sharing everything left over from the days of the Men of letters. There is way too much knowledge here for only us to keep. New and future generations of hunters should have a fair chance now that we know that anything can happen, even with Jack as the new God trying to make paradise.» Sam says wistfully as he finishes his breakfast.
“Yes.”
Too caught up in each other, they didn’t notice their son standing by the house, smiling at them before turning, disappearing into the forest. Pulling back slightly from their gentle kiss, resting their foreheads together, their eyes meet once more.
“It couldn’t make me sleep because the Shadow couldn’t silence the... I kept waking. I was awakened by someone’s prayers. They were so loud the Shadow couldn’t silence them.” He says it for everyone to hear, but the words are only really meant for Dean. “Prayers that kept me awake. Kept me safe from being consumed by emptiness.”
He´d never believed he’d get to live a happy life, to feel loved the way he had always longed for. To be loved by the angel that he’d fallen for so many years ago. The angel he, tomorrow, would get to call
“It’s no dream, Cas. If it is I don’t ever want to wake up. But it’s not a dream. It’s real.”
«But... How? I thought the empty couldn’t reach us here.»
And then when Dean had been resurrected as a demon, nothing could save him. Sam had tried everything to bring back Dean. But nothing worked. Dean had believed Cas to be dead, so he had given up and let the demon take over. And then Cas was there. Cas was alive. And so Dean started fighting. Sam had cured him, yes. But Cas was the reason Dean started fighting. Fighting against the demon. Cas was the cure. And yet. Dean was too much of a coward to tell him.
“Morning, bro!” Dean's wide smile and shining eyes take away his worry, but not confusion. Sam notices that his hair is damp, probably having just showered, and he’s wearing one of his silly-looking pajamas with pictures of pies on it, and a dark green comfy-looking hoodie.
«Dean…»
In every way possible.
«Do you mind?» Dean looks annoyed at his brother and Charlie as he points between himself and the door, his clothes not within reach from where he sits on the bed. They both narrow their eyes before turning and leaving the room. «Crazy people.»
«Shut up.» But Dean smiles as he kisses him gently on his forehead. Cas turns his face to Dean so that Dean only has to lean in slightly for their lips to touch.
The eyes are wrong.
«I am.»
Dean almost feels bad leaving the kitchen with that tone, but he knows his brother knows. And that almost makes it even worse. Almost.
A little more awake now, Cas chuckles against Dean's chest, his warm breath tickling his bare skin. «I told you.»
Just the two of them, without the others being nosy. Because, the moment they announced this, this thing between them, it would be everyone's business. He’d seen how the others had acted when Severin and Alex had told them that moving into the bunker, finally settling down, had finally brought them together. They had moved into one of the bigger rooms a couple of days later, together. Everyone had been so excited and happy about it, the other new hunters especially. Asking all kinds of questions one could expect when announcing a relationship. It was nice, yes, but Dean felt that for now, he wanted to keep Cas to himself. Everyone in the bunker… Well, everyone was everywhere. And although Dean wanted everyone to know how much he loved the angel, and that the angel was
“Never doubt that I’ll come for you, Cas. I’ll follow wherever.”
Loving.
Cas finds Sam in the library working on translating some old books. Joining him at the table Cas is feeling restless, Dean's phone call on repeat in his head. Sam looks up at him as he sits down.
«Nothing,» Dean mumbles through a smile, «nothing at all.»
Or when Dean had hurt his ankle after being carelessly climbing onto a shelf in their garage, tripping the whole thing over. Cas had been mad at how careless he could be, angry that he couldn’t heal him anymore. They’d started bickering about how the other was careless, and how the other had no way of protecting them if they kept being reckless. Sam had laughed when he came into the kitchen and heard them fighting about who gets to love and protect the other the most. They didn’t talk much that night either, communicating only in small, short, flat words. Silence treatment seemed to be their specialty. Later that day when they cleaned up after dinner, Sam saw the hand Dean placed on Cas's lower back when he passed him to get to the sink. How Cas had placed his hand on Dean's shoulder, his thumb stroking his neck, for a moment when they walked down the hall to Dean's “cave” that he had made into a private living room or movie room for him and Cas. When Sam was on his way from the living room to his own room that night, he had passed their slightly open bedroom, and as he quietly slipped past, Sam had heard them saying good night to each other with sweet words to make up for the silence.
His eyes are right.
Beautiful Dean.
Knowing what he now knew. It was one thing to live with the knowledge that nothing would ever come of Deans feelings towards the angel, knowing that his feelings were his, and his alone. Nothing would ever come of it, so they were simply pointless. But, knowing that Cas felt the same way. But living and knowing that the feelings Dean had towards the angel weren’t
It’s everything Dean has ever dreamt of. Longed for. Needed.
When the two of them were left alone together, cleaning the kitchen after dinner he’d had to force every cell in his body not to tackle the angel, pulling him as close as he could. Kiss his lips. Hold his face in his hands, hold his whole world between his fingers. Just. Hold the angel. While cleaning the kitchen, they’d danced around each other, both of them wearing this stupidly cute smile on their face. And when they were done, Dean had finally laid his hand against the angel's chest. Moving it up to cup his face. He’d leaned in and given Cas a light, warm, gentle kiss. They both put on that stupidly cute smile again before joining the others in the living room. Sitting close to each other, but not close enough for Dean. He was suddenly kind of unsure of how to act in front of the others. He hadn’t talked to Sam after they got back. He’d talked to Jack before he went to the empty, and Jack knew what had happened between him and Cas. But he still hadn’t said a word about it to Sam. He felt he needed to say something, but he didn’t know what. Or how. Feelings and words weren’t really his specialty...
(See the end of the chapter for
But, he wants it to be.
Feelings of memories, and memories of feelings.
Nothing other than the man in his arms.
The next time the Shadow approaches him as Dean, it has chosen another attitude. This one is the one that is the easiest to put up with.
«Morning, bro.» Dean follows, reaching for the bacon already before he has gotten his ass on the chair.
And the Empty had come for him.
“It’s a good deal. You let one angel go, and we let you go back to sleep. Never to bother you again.” Dean keeps an eye at the Shadow as it keeps walking around him, slow steps. He looks down at the angel in his lap, gently stroking his hand through the black hair.
When Cas had been human before, he had found mornings to be terrible. But not these mornings when he would wake beside Dean. Those were like little pieces of heaven. Them waking together. Smiling at each other. He never wanted to leave the sanctuary of their bed, their room. But as always, they had to get up sometime. During the weekends, when Dean didn’t have work, they would wake together like this, staying there for as long as they could. Usually, they were dragged out of bed by scratching on the door. They had already slept in, and the dog outside had waited long enough for them to wake. So when Dean went to open the door, Miracle sprinted through the door, jumping as high as he could to land in the middle of the bed, getting comfortable between the two men as Dean lay back down beside Cas. Miracle let out a happy bark as Cas obeyed his request for cuddles.
“No. No question. It’s the only thing I’ve ever been so sure of in my entire existence.”
«He was in love. Right?»
“Yeah... Now I really hope you’ll stop scaring me like that and just stay here. Safe. Both of you.” Sam looks at them both in turn with a worried look, but then a smiles cracks on his lips.
The last thing Dean expected was to be nervous, but standing in front of his brother as he fixes Dean's blue tie, he can feel his hands shaking. Sam and Charlie refused to let Dean and Cas see each other all day, and for some reason that makes Dean even more nervous.
And yet.
The room is small but divided into two separate bedrooms, with one bed in each. Only one of the beds are empty when Dean and Cas arrives.
Dean would be lying if he said he wasn’t a little glad there were only one empty bed and no sofa, in the room where Sam was already snoring loudly on the other bed. Dean, and Cas, fell asleep with a smile playing on their lips. The smile still lingering as Dean woke the morning after.
“Morning.”
“Maybe another time, Sammy. Wasn’t really planning on doing anything today. Got some parts to change on Baby, so I might spend some hours in the garage.”
~ THE END ~
Walking too fast, he crosses the room to leave the brothers alone.
I feel like this (or something similar) is what should have happened. After everything Dean and Cas and Sam have been through, they all deserved to live the life they wanted. Dean wanted to quit hunting, and Sam wanted to be of help to other hunters. Cas and Eileen would of course stand by their sides for whatever they chose to do with their lives. It should have been their choice.
When Dean wakes in the morning, his face is buried in the crook of Cas´s neck, arms around each other, their bodies are keeping each other warm. Safe. Not wanting to leave his arms, Dean lays there, eyes closed, hand gently running over the man's back, a small smile painted on his lips.
The bright smile on his face when Dean handed him a steaming cup of coffee definitely made the walk across town to find it, so worth it.
No more words are spoken, as Dean pulls Cas with him into his bedroom. As they get close to the bed, Miracle jumps up, before taking his place at the foot-end of the bed. More kisses are given, more freckles painted on his smiling face.
Cas dying without anyone telling him they loved him.
“Seriously? That’s your bargaining chip?”
A figure approaching him. «Cas!»
«Good. Okay. Thanks.» Sam is about to turn after having studied Deans eyes for a moment, when he stops at Deans next words.
It doesn’t last long enough.
“Hey, Cas. You okay?”
A young Dean Winchester sits by the lake behind their house, quietly watching, waiting, as for the sun to rise, painting the horizon in beautiful colors. Smiling at the silence, he waits.
“Uhm... I... I love you, Dean. And I don’t exp...”
But, Cas knows Dean never loved him like that. He knows he didn’t feel the same way. And all the while the empty is yelling at him, Cas has his eyes locked at Dean´s green ones. To remind him that this isn’t
«Yeah, it was.»
“Is... Is Dean... Uhm. Seeing some?”
«Anywhere. Always, freckles.»
It's not Dean.
Dean. Even if Dean didn’t feel the same way as Cas did, he knows that Dean would never hurt Cas like this on purpose.
Finally home.
Another was seeing a memory from the side of the road, that showed Dean and Cas in the front-seat of the impala, Sam, and Jack in the backseat. Cas was smiling softly as he watched Dean driving, Dean, closest to the `camera´, clearly at peace behind the wheel. Sam sat behind Dean, resting his head against the window, deep in sleep, lulled by the roar of the engine. Jack was directly behind Cas, head turned to the forest passing by, looking at something the picture did not catch. Cas had held the memory of watching Dean driving the impala, peacefully without a worry on his face, close to his heart.
Hope.
«No, Cas. Don´t be stupid.» Dean cursed himself for not being able to speak with a clear voice. «We´ll just share the bed, it's big enough for two. Come on, let's get some sleep.»
Dean's hands keep exploring Cas´s back, his skin warm against his cold fingers. Arms locking him tight in his embrace. He needs him closer. Closer. Closer. He can’t get him close enough. Can’t get enough of him. The want, the need, for the other man's touches, kisses, love, is almost dizzying for Dean. His mind only ever focused on those lips.
Kissing the angel until he no longer knows how to breathe. And then some more.
“I’m sorry... I couldn’t...”
«I now declare you, husband and husband.» Eyes and ears only for the man in front of him, Dean almost doesn’t hear the words, the most beautiful words he’s ever heard.
«It will be good to have some more life here.»
The room is not huge, but the two beds are bigger than the ones they are used to, but there is still only one empty bed as Dean and Cas arrives after having eaten dinner. Sam, as always had left first, right after having finished his salad.
His mind wandering to the angel.
«Ugh, don´t call me cute. Dean Winchester is not cute.» But he can’t hide the laughter from his voice, which makes Sam smile even brighter.
He should have said it already.
«Yeah.»
. Not much had changed really, except now they didn’t hide from
He needs Cas to hear them.
“I love you.” The words will never stop Dean's heart from skipping a beat. These three words. The only words he’s ever wanted to hear. The only words he ever wants to hear for the rest of their lives.
«No. Dean, it’s just a bad feeling that something will go wrong if you go alone. Just don’t, okay? I don’t know how to explain it, it’s a wierd feeling I got. But please, trust me. Promise you won’t go.»
“Cas.” He gently shakes Cas’s shoulder, still holding onto his other hand. “Cas, wake up.”
«Castiel!» Cas sits up at the sound of his name, looking around to find the source. A few moments pass where he sits there, staring at the emptiness before he can see a figure in the distance.
It's been a long time since Dean has worn a smile this real. This happy. This true.
Alive.
And so, their foreheads still touching, Cas lay his head to rest against Dean's pillow.
«We have also been talking about maybe seeking out some of the hunters we know are alone or has lost people, leaving them alone. You know we talked about maybe bringing some of the lone hunters here. Especially the young ones.» Sam had brought up the idea some time ago. Wanting to gather and establish some kind of hunter community. Dean thought it was a great idea, he just wasn’t sure if he wanted to be at the forefront of it all. Not anymore.
Knowing this wasn’t his Dean, standing in front of him, Cas also noticed that the Shadow got another thing wrong. Dean never called him by his full name when he was speaking directly to him. To Dean, Cas was always `Cas´. And the way the Shadow said his name was wrong too.
God who was writing everything could never control you two. He never managed to control Castiel after he broke free, and through him, you were free too. You freed him, without knowing it, and he freed you, without seeing it. You
The warmth of his embrace.
Their kisses a safe haven.
One showed Sam and Eileen, faces turned away, Sam leaning against her car, staring out at a beautiful valley from the hill, the sunset colored the valley with a golden glow. The view, and the feeling of Sam holding Eileen, her back against his chest, embossed the memory with joy and love.
As they drive through the dark forest soft songs play from the radio. Cas had fallen in love with music, and Dean had made him another mixtape, with all of Cas’s favorite songs at the moment. This one in particular.
«Dean, I know you didn’t mean to be cruel like you think you were. I know you, I’ve seen your soul and I know you are good. But even good souls have to let loose sometimes»
(See the end of the chapter for
Saving lives.
“What are you gossiping about?”
Days later, the clearing where Dean and Cas had made their home, is filled with friends and family, both hunters and a few supernatural creatures. They gather to say goodbye one last time, as the flames raises high in the sky. The silence and the darkness of night lit up by both the flames and the lanterns each hunter is carrying.
However, now the longing looks were answered. They didn’t turn away when the other caught them watching. The touches always leaving a fire around them, a fire they didn’t hide anymore. But they were still Dean and Cas. Dean very obviously in love with Cas. And Cas clearly in love with Dean. So sometimes Sam was still surprised when he’d catch them kissing in the hallways, laying very close together on the couch, standing close in tight embraces.
Stunned by the beauty of him, Dean stands frozen in front of the cosmic being. His hands falling to his sides as the thread he was holding on to escape his grip.
Cas was his home.
These arms. The only arms Dean wants to hold him.
Dean, the one who hated early mornings, was the first to wake, and after taking a shower he left the motel to get breakfast. When he returned he was met by a tired, but smiling Cas sitting up in the bed.
Dean had just started his new job at the garage working four days a week, the other days he spent in the bunker working with the hunters, although he never went with them on hunts. Cas filled his days by helping the others in the bunker the best he could, or by reading and learning, sometimes learning the hunters what he knew. Most days, when Dean was working, he would leave the bunker to go outside, their dog following close more often than not, something he had found to be his favorite thing to do to pass the time. Nature. The one place, other than inside this room, where he could find a sense of peace so deep and calm that he would long for it at times.
“He’s adorable.” Cas smiles, as Dean chuckled at the sight of them.
Dean had to remind himself to breathe when he felt Cas´s gentle fingers moving slowly across his chest before they rested at his neck. His nose brushed against the space between his neck and shoulder, sending shivers through Dean's whole body.
“What..?”
he is with that hesitant smile on his lips. «Fuck it.»
“I wish!” He had to laugh again. He did suspect something had happened between the two of them these past weeks after they woke from their sleep, but they hadn’t said or showed anything. But, if they didn’t open their eyes soon, and see the other, Sam might go crazy, if they didn’t explode first, from the tension between them. Amused, he sat back in his chair, watching the others. “Now, tell me. What made you all think they were married?”
«What?» Surprise spreads across his face as he stops on his way into the car.
Cas and Dean would stay up later than the others. Usually, the last in the bunker to turn off the lights. The new hunters had chosen bedrooms at the other wing, and Sam and Eileen´s room was further down the hall, so the nights staying up late, the comfortable silence rested over them.
They had all the time in the world. Nothing more to fight or beat. Nothing to worry about. Only live. Finally being able to live. To love. They had all the time in the world, the rest of their time, together.
“Uhm... it is?”
No words are spoken. No words are needed. They both know the name, but they won’t force the words before they slip out themselves. Their touches and kisses spell it out for them instead.
“We know he hit Cas,” Riva says. “He told Beth he had. He admitted it.”
No-one asks him anything else as he thinks, but Beth does bring him a sandwich and pat his arm. The tension in the room is thick enough to make eating uninteresting, but Sam takes a bite anyway. Got to be practical.
God, if Dean’s this close to the edge just from seeing Cas, Sam isn’t sure it’s a good idea the two of them talk. Not just now. Those women might be right about Cas needing to be shielded from the both of them, at least when Dean’s in this state. But not about them staying away for good. Cas is family, and Sam has lost enough family. They all have.
Holding Cas is harder than carrying other people Sam’s had to get out of places. When it’s Dean, that’s all he can focus on, and it’s rare Dean’s out so far Sam’s had to hold him like this. Either way, Sam hasn’t been keeping tabs on anything other than the man in his arms in those cases. Now, he finds he’s lost sight of his brother.
He blinked at that, his head moving back as though she’s pushed it. It took him a moment before he responded.
A thread of understanding reaches him.
She frowns, the shadows across her face chasing the movement.
Dean stroked one hand along the angle of Cas’ hip, the other cupping Cas’ face with a thumb under the guy’s jaw, adjusting Cas’ head until he had it tipped back and was looking right into Dean’s eyes. Dean had never thought before that he’d find it so compelling to be standing fully clothed when his partner wore nothing, but it could just be that everything with Cas felt so loaded, so full of potential and sparks, that anything would be exciting.
*****************************************
“Tell me what you mean,” she says. Demands. Thinks she demands.
They’re far enough across town that Dean’s not looking forwards to the walk back to the Impala by the time Cas nods at an office block.
“He won’t admit it,” Sam says. “Or maybe he will. But if he does, he’ll throw it in your face.”
“Are we done here?” he asks.
“Okay,” Cas says. “Then, yes, it might be in there now. We should investigate. Beth, Val, Riva, you should stay out here.”
“This time?” Ashley’s eyes fly open and he drops his hand to the arm of the settee, his knuckles white as he grips it. “You saw it again? Where? Here?”
“Nothing,” he says, because it’s a game they play, it seems.
He draws to a halt, staring.
Castiel feels movement on his other side, and Val leans around him, resting her hand on his forearm. It’s oddly possessive. It’s even more strangely comforting. Val has a smile on her face, but there’s an edge to.
“I don’t know,” Riva says. “But that’s the point. Cas is ill. Or injured. That’s something we’re right about, one way or another, but we don’t know what’s actually wrong. And we thought some of his issues were to do with this guy he was running from, and then Dean turns up-”
“But he didn’t,” Sam says. “It just takes time. And we’re all he’s got, Dean. Who else can he go to?”
The guy’s steadier than he was back at Val’s place, not hunched or shifty looking, but Dean’s known Cas for years and he isn’t holding himself right. With what they’ve found in the park, Dean tries looking at Cas with the idea the angel’s cut up, and the tension across Cas’ shoulders makes it all too easy to imagine.
Castiel feels the blind spots all around him, feels every place where he should be able to see and can’t. He’s tired of trying to see properly with only his human eyes. He didn’t feel this when he was mortal, when he was as close to human as he could get without tearing out his own Grace and being born anew. Even then, no angel is ever really fully human.  But Castiel isn’t sure he’s an angel anymore, either. Not really.
The voice filters through from a distance. He’s been without the never-ending voice of the Host for a long time, of course. Ever since he first turned his back on his superiors, the song, the chanting, the adoration of his father faded, became something only partly glimpsed. He thought he was used to it, the silence so loud it’s practically a roar.
“Sounds like they’ve hurt each other for years,” Riva says, but she says it calmly, and she looks a question at Sam as she says it.
It’s moving out there, out in the wider room, and she isn’t at all sure she’s escaped it. She has no idea if it smells or sees or what. And she can’t remember what it looks like. She just saw it. She must have. And she can’t remember what is looks like.
“He is good with physics,” Riva says.
“Bet it drives you to distraction,” he said, reaching out his hand until the point of his dagger touched the demon’s throat. The thing couldn’t rock away from him, or lower its chin to present a smaller target, because Dean had another demon, one of the loyal ones, holding the thing’s head back by the hair. “Bet you just look at those of us with a soul and with power and want to scream, right? Want to tear into me? Rend me limb from limb?”
“I’m not going to argue with you on that one,” Dean says,“but that’s not what I meant. Sam and me? We got a crappy deal. And we’ve got work to do. I…I’m just getting that. I think. Now sure how yet, but, yeah. But I was talking about you.”
That seems to be all he has.
The fight slips out of Sam, leaving him looking exhausted enough to fall over. He runs a hand over his face, huffing out a breath that sounds painful.
It was mostly to keep Rit Zien away, in any case, and with his wings back and with Dean and Sam around, they can deal with one, if needs be.
“Yeah?” he asks.
Sam opens his mouth and closes it again, looking away for a moment as though he expects to find answers on the wall or in the doorway. When he looks back, his face has that pinched look that means he’s more worried rather than less. That isn’t the way this is supposed to go.
He looks away, his eyes shuttering in a way Dean’s known for years means Cas is uncomfortable about a topic.
He sounded wondering.
“Neglected you? Abused you?”
“I knew it!” John says, triumph clear. “Physics. Did the two of you meet through Beth?”
“Hey. Hey, it is you. What are you doing here?”
“I sense the creature,” Cas says, voice low.
“But it’s why he’s been taking, what, painkillers? Crack? How bad are we talking here?”
Nora laughs. Steve only met Cassie once or twice, and both times seemed to have trouble with her name, but it’s a new revelation that they’re both so interested in discussing math. Nora supposes learning new things about people is part of life. She didn’t know Steve had a sister, but now she’s already thinking of asking both Steve and Hannah to visit again.
Dean seems to have become speechless. He opens and shuts his mouth, his expression one of shock.
Dean’s heart pulses when he catches sight of Cas. The guy’s standing there, sword in hand, over on the other side of the echoing space, and he isn’t looking at Dean. Blood streaks Cas’ face, running in a line from his temple to just near his mouth, and his face is set in that warrior’s mode. His face is set, his eyes are glowing, and behind him, above him, are arcing black wings. They flash in shadow-shapes against the wall, there and gone, there and gone, and each time Dean takes in more.
Meeting her eyes again, Castiel grimaced. He was more expressive than Hannah was.
He’s got his hands on Cas, still, one on his arm and one on his back, and Sam backs off, just a pace or two, wiping his hands on his jeans. Dean doesn’t even seem to notice.
She sounds quite upbeat about it.
“What’s it say?” he asks. “Were people forgetting things?”
He first met the man near the Thunderbird, two days after arriving in town, when he’d been weak enough to let the car pull him back. With pain etching its way down his wings, he’d had the car key in his hand when the man had almost run into him, asking if he wanted something as a pick-me-up, or something to help him have a good time. That was the only time the man was in the side-street. He will have to hunt in other places.
“Heaven,” he says.
“No. Yes. I…I don’t know. You don’t need to be concerned.”
“Tactical emotional advice?” Dean asks, sounding skeptical. He sighs. “Fine. Got to be worth a try. Lay it on me.”
Clenching her jaw, Riva steps back and folds her arms across her body, clutching an elbow with the opposite hand. It’s the kind of posture people use when they feel defensive, but Val’s pretty sure it’s more to keep herself from yelling at Aidan. Or from dragging him bodily to the hospital.
“No. Er. Yeah. Yeah, I’m fucking freezing.”
He moved, pulling the dagger back and throwing his arms out, spinning in a slow circle as the demons around him nodded and agreed. It wouldn’t take too long to destroy them all, but Hell was huge and Dean needed to know he’d got rid of the ones who’d really opposed him.
“I haven’t taken anything else,” Cas says.
This hasn’t got anything to do with any of that, though. This is people looking at Sam and thinking that, at best, he failed to stop his brother hurting Cas. He might have softened Beth’s view on it, or Riva’s, but they haven’t come around to welcoming Sam and Dean in. There’s still that wariness, that air they’re watching for anything Cas needs protecting from. It’s exhausting.
“No,” Bella said. “Just be patient.”
“And I am?”
And Castiel just thought of himself as something Dean loves. That is also pleasant.
Val’s biting a fingernail when Sam looks at her, her face hard to read, and she vanishes from the room without comment as Dean guides Cas towards the archway. By the time Cas is on the settee, Val is back with a glass of water. It’s clear she isn’t certain it’s needed, and the way she almost sags when Cas smiles and takes it pulls something like understanding onto Dean’s face.
“Sure,” Dean says, before Castiel can feel awkward. “I can finish up the eggs. You got anything to go with them?”
Castiel feels a spike of irritation. He tamps down on it as ruthlessly as he can. Dean is being caring. He should be grateful.
“You don’t?”
“Bela and Castiel are there, too,” Hannah said. “They’re survivors. Castiel is one of the best tacticians I’ve ever known. Bela knows how to plan almost anything to her advantage. If Dean has turned, and we don’t know he has, they’ll see this mission completed.”
“Whoa. Steady.”
“There should be,” Dean says. “He’s not well, Sam. Fuck. He’s wasting away up there. You think hauling some books in is enough?”
“Why’d she say ‘if’, Sammy?” Dean asks. Every few steps he looks back over his shoulder as though he’s thinking of bolting back to the spot Cas left from. So far, he hasn’t. “Maybe I freaked Cas out with all that boyfriend crap. Moved too fast-”
“Sam?” She waited until his eyes met hers. “Sam, this is important. I know you want Dean back. I want Bela back. But we can’t skip over the details. And we have to be practical. You can’t turn this into some suicide mission.”
They always seemed to be asking each other that question.
“Where’ve you been?” she asks, and then, recalling what else Dean said. “What do you remember?”
“That’s…complicated,” he said. “I never forgot what Meg was.”
“I don’t know why Dean asked him about dying and I don’t know why he isn’t getting better and I don’t know what caused this fit!”
She stays quiet all the way to the car, all the way to Beth’s house. When they pull up at the curb, she looks a question at Riva, who shrugs.
Images of times he’d done or said anything that might push Cas away, or put the angel’s objectives behind their own, trickled into his mind. It wasn’t a case of not trusting Cas. Hadn’t been for years, and even then Sam had seen that Cas’ heart was in the right place. It wasn’t even thinking Cas’ goals were insignificant. It was just… It was just their mission always seemed so urgent, and the tasks Cas set himself so often seemed distant. Other. But it wasn’t a lack of trust.
“Maybe. I’ve never seen an angel as damaged as Castiel who hasn’t called for a Rit Zien to end it. And his Grace has been in-” She paused and glanced right at Dean. “In angel Heaven for a long time. I’m not sure it’s unaltered by that.”
Jake, it turns out, has power tools and some loyalty card for a local place that sells everything else they need, and he takes Steve off in his truck to get everything. It leaves Nora with Hannah, who reacts to an offer of coffee as though she’s following a script she’s never really seen the point of.
