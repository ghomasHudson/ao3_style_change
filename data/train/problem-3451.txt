"I did it twice this morning. Once after he woke up from a nightmare and then while he was sleeping again. It's why he's acting so strangely. It was... too much, I think. But I wanted him to-" His voice falters. "I thought it could make it last longer. Give him some more time. I try to hurry but I don't know how long it will take until I’ll be back."
"It’s not your fault." Castiel stroked over his shoulder carefully. "Besides, Dean himself said that he was over it long ago. We are only good friends. Soul mates."
"Are we still operating under the assumption that what we're looking for is a God or Goddess?" Castiel asks.
"It's only a few more years." He tried to comfort Sam. "The books I’ve read on adolescence all say that the physical development in girls is already complete at the age of sixteen."
He turned away. Charlie just sat there and stared into the fire when the picture started to dissolve and Sam remembered that he existed.
"People have died because they did reckless things," Sam says. "People do reckless things all the time. If it's really what they want to do, maybe we should let them."
He doesn’t mean to actually say it, but it’s probably a good thing to have the dispensed anger of the past days out in the open.
Castiel had been right: He was happy. Happy-ish. And he would not let that slip out of his hands because of one lie or one fight or some misguided overprotectiveness. Not if he could help it. As long as he managed to pull himself together, put his acute feelings of hurt aside and look at things with some perspective. Maybe more perspective than anyone could ask for.
"It's not magic, it's just a custom. And if you don't get it right, then you have bad sex for seven years." Charlie giggled and then, when she noticed the horrified look of her two fathers, added: "What? That's what Uncle Dean said." She crossed her arms over her chest. "I wish he was here too."
The hallucinations were nothing but a hick up. Like falling off the wagon for a bit, and getting right back on. While Dean and, to a lesser degree Castiel too, was busy making a mountain out a molehill, blowing things out of proportion, Sam knew what he needed: Get past it. Not see Lucifer's face. Not dwell on his touch.
But at least, he’s enjoying food. He’d take this any day over Sam’s issues with eating, he thinks, as he eyes the half-eaten plate of egg whites across the table.
He knows one angel’s true form. He's seen how beautiful and dreadful and horrifying it can be. He can’t help but imagine now and then, how different Castiel's would be.
Something changed in Castiel, his features softened, he appeared less human. He took a step towards her.
"Okay." Sam still looked unsure."I really hope he's gonna call soon. I gotta be honest, I’m a little worried. I wish I could just go and check on him and make sure everything is okay.”
"We never fight in front of her." Sam crossed his arms over his chest. "I don’t know what you want to hear from me. She already knows how twisted her whole family situation is. Maybe now she still thinks it's normal... I mean, she knows that her father, who happens to be an angel, is in a relationship with her uncle. It's only a matter of time before she's gonna ask more questions. What do you want to tell her? That she exists because I was drunk and lonely, and you —whatever you were that night." Sam looked down at his entwined arms.
Outside, he's surprised by the pitch-black darkness and the cold. He checks the time on his watch. It's 3 a.m. Jesus, how long was he doing research? Maybe he slept longer than he thought. He walks towards the Impala and startles. He recognizes Castiel by his posture. He's wearing Sam's hoodie, oversized on him. Dean walks slower.
Even after changing the position of the seat, he feels cramped and almost clownish. His limbs too long and his head too close to the ceiling. He drives fast, outside the city limits, just to make sure. The tank is almost empty, so he has no other choice but to stop. Inside the gas station at the counter, he keeps watching through the glass door for anyone who might be approaching the car. The clerk chews gum and smells like he fell into a tub of perfume with a heavy flowery note. He doesn't say anything but he gives Sam a funny look once he hands over his credit card. Right. The blood. There is nothing he could say to make him seem less suspicious, so he doesn't try.
"I don’t know," Castiel says in earnest. Then there are warm hands holding Sam’s. "I just know that I really want you to. I really do. Maybe that can be a good enough reason for now? That people want you to stay? Dean is strong, but it would still break him. You misunderstand my importance in his life if you think I could keep him together when you’re gone. No one could."
Jody immediately opens the door, a beer in her hands, when they ring the bell. "I thought I heard you guys." She steps aside and lets them in.
He’s aware of what's happening. Spiraling thoughts like this can go on for hours. This is mild, but they only get worse with time.
“Hey Dad!” Charlie beamed at Sam as they pushed the door open. She was sitting next to Castiel at her desk. She greeted Dean equally enthusiastically.
For a second Sam wonders if Dean's got a point because his anger is confused. But it's not that he doesn't know what he's irritated by, it's that it's not one single thing but a whole slew of them.
"You've got to thank Sam here." She bumps her shoulder into Sam's arm. "He's not half-bad at cooking."
»It was fine.« Sam resisted the urge to take his eyes off his brother. »Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was alright.«
But even if the world was ending right now, he'd still feel heartache. The small stuff doesn't evaporate, you just shove it aside. He remembers feeling petty and petulant towards Sam even during the looming apocalypse. He knows how to swallow down pain well enough, but at some point you're so full of it, you need to find an outlet to make some space. Maybe it doesn't have to be a full blown apocalypse, but he's gonna have to find something to take his mind off.
"No, of course not.” Sam tried to smile at her. "But just to be absolutely sure: you’re not, right?"
"The Winchesters, your raison d’être," one of the angels he’d never met before had aptly commented. He had grinned at him, holding his angel blade close to the soft skin on Castiel’s neck, while he’d hung, suspended from the air. "Tell me about them."
He watches Dean walk up the counter, watches him talk to the cashier, watches him walk to the bathroom.
Speculating about her doesn't feel great, but it's better than thinking about Dean and Cas. Picturing them in the car together, serious looks on their faces.
But it’s not that. He just really likes good food. And where’s the problem with that? He’s not going to give up the few comforting things in life that he knows are a constant, that won’t ever disappoint him or leave.
"You didn't tell him, did you?" Dean understands. "You didn't tell him you were actually going to try and get help from other angels."
"Sam." Castiel crouches before him and cups his cheek. Sam forces himself not to flinch. These are different hands. These are good hands. "Look at me."
The way Sam had just slipped past him - half drowned rat, half suicidal apocalyptic; the confused look on Castiel's staring face; the fact that he himself was standing in Bobby's hallway, early Christmas morning, cold and tired in nothing but a T-shirts and boxer shorts, having a laughing fit of proportions not seen since the Magic Brownie incident in his youth.
Cas considers Sam’s sprawled figure on the bed and shoves his legs to the side, so he can sit beside him.
Castiel frowned. He couldn't really figure out why the time frame made a difference, and he doubted Dean would approve of one occasion more than the other.
"Well, don't say I didn't warn you," Dean says, his focus back on Castiel. He watches him tentatively open a cupboard, the loaf of bread still in his hand.
Dean had to help her. He focused on moving his body and actually managed to twist his little finger. He was able to overcome the effect of the poison. All he needed was just a little bit more time.
"I guess I should have gotten us two rooms now, huh?" Dean says, throwing his bag onto one bed. "Sorry, brain fart. Next time."
He pressed two fingers into the bridge of his nose, his face still nestled in Castiel's neck. He could feel Castiel's pulse, his irregular heartbeat, and felt his exhale in his hair before he spoke again.
"I am very happy that you and Sam have managed to establish a little contact with each other again over the past few months and have been cordial with each other. Charlie misses you a lot, and I'm very happy that she gets to have you in her life again."
But then she just nodded. Dean put his arms around her to steady her, as she climbed off the table. "Come on, let's get you out of here."
"It's got nothing to do with you," Sam says. His throat and chest tightens. Blood flows to his hands.
"She can't do that forever. That-" He stopped mid-sentence and pointed through the window. “I think we have to take that one. Garth's house is up there.”
He thinks maybe it'd feel less awkward to catch them fucking. But probably —no, probably not. They’d be all emotional and heartfelt about that, too. He’s pretty sure he doesn’t want to see that.
When Sam looked up, the freckled child's face had disappeared. Instead he looked into the worn face of a grown man. Sam screamed and instinctively backed away, but the stranger had already grabbed him.
Castiel shook his head. He felt slightly ashamed that it had not been his first instinct to go see her. It would have been different if he had come with more positive news.
"Sam." Castiel’s face is dark as he turns to him. "There is no such thing as the angels anymore. There is not one united front. There’s so few of us left, and those who are left have separated into groups fighting each other. Everyone is trying to gain the upper hand. Why should I be afraid of one small splinter group, when surely they will be wiped out soon by another anyway?"
He tore himself away from the view from the hallway and opened the door to his daughter's room. Charlie was already in bed, her long dark hair star-fished on the white pillow.
A moment later Sam stood at the table, a shiny stainless steel bowl in front of him, and looked around himself once more.
"What? You know it's true. They'd agreed that I could stay with you over the summer. But then they had this brilliant idea to get married. I mean they didn't even ask me about it!"
Soon enough, Sam and Cas start talking again, about some French movie they apparently watched together a few weeks ago. Dean turns the volume of the radio up again, The Moody Blues drowning out Sam's questions that suddenly vear into the historical. No one can be that into the structure of Paris in Roman times. ("You've really been to Lutetia? Wow. That must have been breathtaking!" - "I wish I could show it to you, Sam.")
. At least it would feel like he belonged there - and then Dean would somehow make him come back. He'd find a way, as he always did.
The man looks away. Then he yawns, puts his elbow in front of his mouth and gets up. He stretches and turns to leave. Sam grabs him by the collar and yanks him up. "Listen to me, you piece of shit. You'll tell us what we want to know."
Castiel waits a beat, and then says: "You missed a button. On your shirt." Dean looks down at himself, doesn't say anything.
»We're not.« Dean turned towards him, irritated. »I mean, we won't break up, because we're not dating.« He looked into his brother's grinning face. »Oh just shut up, Sam!«
Besides, Dean reminds himself, he's not even sure if Castiel ever wanted him like that. It's not like Sam is the only thing in the way. There's a million other reasons why it wouldn’t work. The only sensible solution to his problem is to squash these idiotic feelings.
"I did hit my head! Why don't you ask him, if you don’t like the way he looks at me? Why don't you just ask him for once!”
It’s a far cry from the apathetic guy who’d let himself be captured by a monster and listlessly stared into the eyes of death.
"It was just a normal ghost," Sam tries to understand. "Even if she tripped and even if you weren't in the room when she attacked, why didn't you just-"
"There's not really a protocol for this kind of shit. Most people don't have hallucinations of their actual time in hell and being tortured by the devil."
"Oh yeah. So you just went off to take a nest out by yourself? Cause that's so much better. That'd be suicidal."
It was difficult not to get lost in his heaven again, especially with Castiel lying next to him. It all felt so real. It would be so easy to sink back into the warmth and give into the forgetting. What did it ultimately matter that this wasn't the real Castiel, when Sam knew his own feelings were true.
He only realized that he was crying when his hands started to get wet. The odd sound filling the room were sobs escaping his own throat.
Today the circumstances were different anyway. There were no easy conversations and no snacks. Now there was a group of strange werewolves who had retired towards the kitchen with Garth, while Beth was in the room with Lila, and the two of them - the Hunter Angel fraction - who had helped in some way, but whom no one trusted.
Jody's voice distant echoes through to them again, but Dean can't make out the words. He doesn’t care if she’s upset or not. This is more important than putting some stupid glasses on a table.
"I should, shouldn't I? But I don't hate you. I couldn't hate you a few years ago, so how could I now that you're unhappy too?" He laughed without humor and shook his head.
"Because it's important that she starts to think about these things —what it is she wants in life. She needs to contemplate who and what she is."
"Dude, stop. I know what shaking your head means. This is just bizarre. I don’t need lessons from you on how to look out for Sam. You’re having a lot of gall, talking about hubris! You think you know him better because you two are holding hands like schoolgirls now? Bull-fucking-shit!"
Sam didn't see the grin on Dean's face, Castiel stood too close to him for that, but he heard it in his voice.
"Okay," he says defiantly and turns his body towards Castiel, who hasn’t let go of him. He shoots closer still, closing the last gap between their bodies. He puts his hands on Sam’s face and presses their noses and foreheads together, as he's done many times by now.
"Don't say it's not me," Castiel says. "I can tell it was me who just caused you distress, and I know it was me this morning too. I don't want that."
The floor was sparkling clean. It definitely hadn't been that shiny and smooth just a few hours ago.
"Don't even listen to him." Charlie rolled her eyes. "Dean just still can't handle the fact that someone who isn't part of the family is living in the bunker."
Anyone could have revived Azazel. Jack and Rowena are not the only people able to use resurrection magic. Nick nearly brought Lucifer back from the Empty, and he was an otherwise unremarkable human.
Although I’m not sure why. Michael thought that when God died, the next most powerful being would inherit his title. Amara split from him, and that should have been enough...
Chuck reaches out and waves a hand at Rowena-- who doubles over, in shock and pain, as her PURPLE MAGIC starts swirling around her chest-- and then Jack, too, sinks to his knees with a scream--
YOUNGER CASTIEL and YOUNGER DEAN watch on as YOUNGER SAM lies in bed, incapacitated. Set, make-up and costume to match 7.17 THE BORN-AGAIN IDENTITY. Castiel is stroking Sam’s forehead, looking miserable. Our Dean twists his head around-- disoriented again.
You can ‘counteract’ me all you like-- it doesn’t change a thing. Don’t forget, it’s not just me in here. I’m The Light
The WAYWARDS have laid out an extravagant feast on the war table. There are even decorations strung up around the war room. Similar to 15.14 LAST HOLIDAY but more Hunter culture-- think devil’s trap baubles and oddly-shaped bones as candle holders.
I’m in your mind, Dean. I see every part of you, every part of your heart. So let me ask you one question:
Jack is sitting on CASTIEL’S BED, looking defeated. He holds out his hand, as though about to cast magic. Frowning deeply in concentration. But nothing happens.
gonna replace my dad. But I know how much he cares about people. How much he cares about you. And even I can see how much you’re hurting him. So... when are you gonna man up about it?
A reedy businessman in a suit turns around, away from the body. He has a bloody knife in hand-- and yet his suit is completely clean.
Dean is thrown by this sincerity, and has to gather his thoughts again. He chuckles, trying to break the moment.
WIDE SHOT of the motel, and the scenes dissolve again-- this time re-forming into another motel room we haven’t seen before...
15.22 – For this title, I thought about using ‘End in Blood’ (referring to, of course, the famous found family line from the show). But I didn’t think that made as much sense out of context as ‘In the Blood’, a slightly more subtle reference to the same idea. Mostly refers to the idea of something running in the family, or ‘in the blood’. Also happens to be the title of this John Mayer
Everyone in the crowd mutters to each other. An old woman shakes her head. Her elderly husband watches on.
Don’t worry. It was going to his head, so I cast a glamour on him. Now he looks and sounds just as miserable as you remember.
Me! Killing Lucifer is turning into a rite of passage around here, isn’t it? Perhaps next time around, Eileen should claim the pleasure.
Castiel stands watch over him, gravely concerned. He hears a sound and looks up to see Michael-- now again in Adam’s body-- enter the infirmary.
Castiel follows Jack’s gaze to Dean, standing casually at the top of the stairs. Castiel-- unlike Jack-- is
She enters, and stares at the solemn scene before her. At Amara, a stranger-- who regards her with regal disdain.
We see a SHERIFF-- mid-50s, white, been through the mill. He’s holding a CORDED PHONE with one hand while the other rifles through papers on his desk. Extremely STRESSED.
I’ll get it. You have no idea how to navigate my laptop files, I don’t want you messing something up.
--but the second he comes back it’s all bitch fights and surly attitudes! You know sometimes you remind me so much of Dad it scares me.
We see the back of A TALL MAN, who brings two cups of coffee out of the café. He places them both down at the small table in front of Adam. We don’t see his face.
THE GRACE-LIGHT OF AN ARCHANGEL spills out of Michael, and into DEAN, who LIGHTS UP WITH BLUE RADIANCE.
Thing is, we have no idea how many angels or demons were in the Empty to begin with. I mean, it’s not even just human history here. It’s all of Creation.
Nick brought back Lucifer. That spell could work as way of reaching Castiel. Reaching the Empty. But I need you to make it work, and you need me.
CLOSE ON THE PLASTIC PLAYERS, and THE BALL being knocked back and forth as Michael and Jack twirl the handles around.
Something successful happens on stage. Those backstage turn to each other with glee. High-fives, hugs, and silent celebrations.
--it doesn’t matter how we feel! You know what? Stay. Stay. But somebody’s gotta be the grownup here.
WIDEN to reveal a brightly colored, faux-retro PORTABLE RADIO, on a table next to Chuck. The voices from the Bunker are coming through-- although the reception doesn’t seem to be very good.
But Michael is DEAD... his body lies IMPALED above the ground, his arms lying limp on either side of him.
I know I’m just the witch you turn to when you have some need of a spell, but... if you ever want to talk about it.
Same thing we all are. Playing out Dad’s little games for His entertainment. What did you think would happen here, brother? You’d manage to kill Jack, and then Dad would welcome you back with open arms?
On SAM AND DEAN. Sam still cradling Dean, Dean now sitting up slightly-- both looking at Chuck with their faces lit by the glowing light--
Chuck stands to his feet, dusting off his EXPENSIVE MAROON SUIT as he advances on Michael. Irritated.
Yeah, pretty clever of me actually. A few last minute edits. See, I couldn’t stop the Empty’s screw-ups of my lore... and I can’t kill Jack myself now he’s been infused with the Empty’s power. But I
Oh, come on. We really starting this again? Just-- let’s go talk to the sheriff before he calls it for the day.
MID SHOT revealing Castiel, Ellen and Bobby sitting at a table. All drinking from shot glasses. The others are holding alcoholic beverages and standing around them. Looking on the drinking contest with interest. At some point it seems that Pamela and RUFUS TURNER have joined the party.
Dean looks quizzically at Sam-- clearly, he hasn’t been filled in on whatever Sam is talking about. Meanwhile, Chuck is startled by Sam’s confidence.
Castiel goes to reach to comfort Dean from behind... but then he falters and holds himself back. Uncertain of his place.
Michael hopping all over the place left a cosmic vapor trail. One I’d only ever seen from archangels. So I took a risk, and I summoned him.
Uh, well. I got no right askin’ how that happened, and frankly I don’t wanna know, but... welcome to the family, I guess?
QUICK CUT MONTAGE of the Impala from previous episodes, very similar in content and style to 5.22 SWAN SONG but incorporating new footage from later seasons. Clips from episodes such as 11.04 BABY. Fifteen seasons of memories. Sam and Dean in the driver and passenger seat, laughing, crying, talking, arguing, singing.
Dean JERKS OUT with his foot, and sends TORTURER 2 CRASHING TO THE GROUND. Dean FIRES clumsily from his gun, and the bullet hits at POINT BLANK RANGE.
OVER THE SHOULDER MID SHOT of JACK, standing at the far end of the room. Staring at the TELESCOPE in the alcove. In the background, we hear the other residents of the Bunker as muffled, faint dialogue.
Well. You know how it is, we run out of codenames pretty fast. Can’t have the Corleones tracking us from state to state.
blew up all over her, and between that and killing Death-- she’s just not as powerful as she used to be. And we all thought she was a major hard-ass
Well, I, for one, am perfectly happy with my own bed. This one is appallingly lumpy. You need new mattresses for this whole place, since these are clearly leftover clearance stock from the mid-1920s.
I’m... glad someone is keeping track. Anyway, I just wanted to check in. Thought I might grab a few mattresses and drag them into the study, so we can sleep. You should join us.
Meanwhile, Sam and Rowena stand by the table of ingredients, Rowena LIT UP with PURPLE LIGHT, her hair billowing out behind her as she raises her hands--
Several moments pass in silence. Dean flicks on his indicator, and then turns the Impala on to the main highway.
Rowena’s wide-open eyes are glassy. UNSEEING. There’s an anxious moment, where it looks like she might be blinded-- but then, her head tilts down and her vision focuses again. Dazed, tired... but otherwise unharmed.
Demonic beings gain power from Hell, just as angels gain power from Heaven. It is a parasitic haze that consumes a soul-- a perverse reflection of angelic grace.
I’m not sure what a Leviathan feels like, and I’m not sure I want to know. But I certainly felt some powerful, vicious beasts inside him. Honestly, boys, I got barely the faintest impression of what was going on. It was like standing in the middle of a tornado for a moment and trying to identify what kinds of debris were caught up in the vortex.
Oh, just some special cuffs we found at a witch’s house. See, we might not be demons anymore, but magic? Magic still works just fine.
Dean can’t indulge in this right now. He can’t let himself hope, but he can’t let himself give up either.
Sam and Dean are being dragged through the motel lobby by TORTURER 1. The lobby is an absolute wreck-- walls are stained green with mildew and mold, carpet is rotted through. Every inch of space screams ‘decrepit’.
You want a confession? Here it is. You said you didn’t write the demon blood stuff into the books, right?
Billie was coming after us, and Cas summoned the Empty. It took her... and it took him. Cas is gone.
My mind is beyond your comprehension. A moment after possessing you, I had experienced every second of your life to that point.
We hear the sound of seagulls and rushing ocean waves. Children playing in the distance. Typical beach sounds.
Patience puts a hand up in the air, but then Claire shoots her a withering look. She quickly retracts it. Meanwhile--
Dean stares down as the remaining grace-light dims from his chest, and looks towards Michael for guidance.
...the kitchen, where Dean turns suddenly-- and in the process almost collides into Castiel. A beat, as the two once again sway together. As though pulled by gravity.
The memory-replica of Dean freezes. The Empty appears in front of our Dean-- reaches out and GRABS HIS NECK, choking him.
CLOSE ON his hands, taking out his PHONE. Turning on the screen-- no new messages. He opens the lock screen.
Fine, can you just-- go to the library and get a book or something? I don’t have the patience to sit here and stop Rowena from corrupting you.
Camera tracks Dean and Castiel, moving through the crowd-- following Sam out of the library. Others notice them, and start to move towards the war room too...
A beat, as the Roadhouse Gang ABSORB THIS STATEMENT. Jo’s eyes go wide. Ellen looks from Castiel to Jack, then back to Castiel. Bobby blinks.
Sam and Dean in the Bunker in Season 15, Sam and Dean right back in the beginning of 1.01 PILOT. Sam and Dean clinking beers while leaning on the Impala. Sam and Dean hugging over and over again. Then, finally, the Sam and Dean clip from 5.22 SWAN SONG, sitting on the Impala and watching the stars.
It’s not just that. I feel like I owe them so much more. And Sam and Dean keep lying to people for me, just to protect me from their questions.
Well, a lot of their remains were pretty badly damaged beyond recognition. But we’ve managed to match two missing persons.
Sam and Dean make grossed out faces. Michael, however, doesn’t react-- he doesn’t get the reference (or chooses not to).
Becky is typing at a desk table on her LAPTOP. We don’t see her face due to the positioning of the screen. On her desk are the Supernatural merch items and other set dressing from 15.04 ATOMIC MONSTERS.
Then we begin a cheerful and quick MONTAGE. Buzzing sounds of chatter a constant in the background. Dialogue may be improvised/added where appropriate. We see people enjoying themselves as the night goes on...
Dean is visibly struck by the sight of Castiel in the glowing light. AT PEACE. Dean swallows nervously. There’s a stretched silence between them, and then--
Yes. One by one, the strings would be cut, until the fabric of reality started unravelling. And at that point, I fear not even you and I would be able to mend it.
PULL BACK continues to reveal MULTIPLE SCREENS, all surveying different rooms of the Bunker. As we pull back further and further, we see the back of CHUCK SHURLEY’S HEAD, resting against a couch.
Oh, Sam. Did you really use one of the most powerful resurrection spells ever made on someone other than Dean? That’s certainly character development.
I spent... years. Millennia. Making them... love you. Believing you’d come back. Love me... for what I did.
He looks for the briefest moment towards Dean, who he has otherwise avoided looking at... but it’s only a moment. His eyes land on the other Winchester instead.
Dean looks away, upset, like maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all. Whatever it is between them is so delicate it’s about to break. Then--
You’re not very good at the whole seduce-me-to-your-side thing, Mikey. That was always more my gig. Doesn’t suit you.
-- there’s not enough power in the world to kill me. So, you go ahead and sit here, slowly running out of options. And I’ll watch you die, one by one, and then I’ll finally be able to move on. You know, the story of Sam and Dean has consumed my existence for a stupidly long time, but I think watching you die like this-- it’ll be closure for me. Cathartic.
a disappointment to daddy. You know, I’m sorry for everything I put you through. Really, I am. Must have worn down your resolve. I mean, it took thirty years for you to give it up to me. How long did it take for you to give it up for Heaven?
Dean turns back around, and opens his mouth to say something-- an apology or further aggravation, we don’t know, because the door of the Bunker SLAMS OPEN--
Even if he could, he says it would defeat the point of granting them humanity in the first place. True free will means Jack couldn’t see what they
On a much younger JOHN AND MARY WINCHESTER. Standing over a crib, looking down proudly at a young Sam. A toddler Dean is in Mary’s arms.
Then YOUNGER DEAN and YOUNGER CASTIEL walk in through the door. Wearing the same clothes as they were in 9.06 HEAVEN CAN’T WAIT. They’re arguing, and the younger Dean swings around as soon as they’re both clear of the doorway and chucks his DUFFEL BAG on the bed next to our Dean. Then he starts stripping off his JACKET. Hangs it next to the door. He’s not looking at the younger Castiel.
WIDE SHOT on a warehouse full of DEAD DEAN WINCHESTERS. At the far other end of the warehouse, NAOMI is making YOUNGER CASTIEL kill the Deans over and over again. Some footage used from 8.17 GOODBYE STRANGER.
Dean regards Michael warily, but nods. He has a tentative understanding of Michael. A comradeship in its infancy, forged in fire.
Okay, okay. Confessions. Um, Sam-- Sammy. Did I ever tell you... Did I ever tell you that night that, uh... that I came for you when you were at school? You know, when dad hadn’t come back from his hunting trip? Yeah, um... Uh...
But right from the beginning you vouched for me, even though you had no reason to. You convinced Dean to let me stay. You’re the reason I had a home.
Kinda funny. You always tried to be my parent, and here I am consoling you over your boyfriend troubles.
Even if we knew how many angels and demons and monsters had ever lived or died, we don’t know how many Jack made human. Or how to tell them apart from regular humans.
MID SHOT of ROWENA, rifling through cabinets and drawers. Picking up ingredients of various types and then tossing them back in--
The camera pans across to reveal ADAM MILLIGAN. Sitting outside a café, and sketching in a notebook.
He flicks up his sunglasses. Stares at the tea. Then SMILES at the volunteer gratefully, accepting it.
With that reference (which clearly goes over Dean’s head)-- he VANISHES. The four men and Rowena look at each other, uncertain of what to do next.
Sam looks away. Smiling-- it’s a fond smile, but tinged with melancholy. The weight of knowing the privilege of Dean’s love... and the costs Dean has paid for that love.
want now, right? Who I want to be, free of Chuck, or my dad, or maybe even being a hunter. And when I get around to thinking about who I want to be with--
A puff of purple smoke, and Rowena’s head TILTS BACK. Jack and Rowena’s eyes both FLARE WITH BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT.
. You Winchesters don’t understand the finer points of politics. I knew if there was a powerful being who had been summoned, there was a chance that being could be turned against Chuck-- if they weren’t enemies already.
Do you remember when we’d play together in the Garden? We’d make a tent woven from our grace, cloak ourselves from Dad. He knew where we were, but not what we were doing. And we trusted each other not to tell Dad how we did it.
If you’re... if you’re out there, Cas... if you can hear me. I’m coming. I swear, I’ll find you, and I--
Sam finishes tying the bandage, and steps back. They both walk out of the motel grounds and across the street.
It was tonight or never. We can’t stay another day away from home. And ya know, Sam and Dean can have the leftovers.
Honestly, it’s more fun this way. Really forces me to get my creative juices flowing. They say you should write with restrictions, and I guess Jack here is the writing constraint I have to work around.
Some footage used from 10.05 FAN FICTION in addition to new footage. Camera moves across side stage. We see the front of the stage with SIOBHAN (playing Dean) and MARIE (playing Sam) performing--
Apparently, they “don’t need sleep”. Jack wanted to show Michael ‘The Office’, so I imagine they’ll be occupied for a while.
And Dean realizes, in that moment, that what is between them isn’t delicate or breakable at all. He knows what he needs to say.
Sam grins, flexing his hands-- he’s FREE OF THE CUFFS! One of his hands is holding a WITCH’S HEX BAG. Now
He winces, remembering their previous argument. But Castiel doesn’t notice the negative association.
First Sam and Dean, and now this. I’m doing my best in impossible circumstances. My friends, they abandon me, plot against me. It’s difficult to understand.
No, nothing. There are no guidelines for this. Even when I took on the souls of Purgatory-- I am not Jack, and even if I were, the forces of Heaven and Hell are in a different league of power entirely.
Eileen and I were going to invite some hunters here for a while. Set up a kind of training camp. But only if that’s-- I mean, this is your home too.
Humans aren’t well equipped to handle knowledge like that. They’re used to the divine being-- an uncertainty. Inaccessible. Terrifying. Not a person just as fallible as them. And certainly not a child.
Our Dean starts PUNCHING THE WALLS, angry and grief-stricken and willing to tear apart Castiel’s mental torture chamber with his bare hands if he has to--
Dean looks to Michael, and then back at Daphne. Uncertainty flickers over his features, and no small amount of guilt.
On Dean, smiling in return. Then looking back to the road. A brief micro-expression of some sadness that Sam can’t see.
when we’re sharing information, sharing resources. And now I think it’s time to share a little of that back with the world. So that people can help protect themselves, and we’re-- proactive, not just reactive.
Who cares what Jack said? We don’t know what happened! But I swear, if he did something to her, if she is--
She must have noticed he was avoiding Dean's eyes when they passed him. "Please don't be mad at him,” she whispered, as he let her down and led her into the bathroom. "It really wasn't his fault. It was me. I wanted to learn how to shoot outside the range. I really had to persuade him. It was all me.”
Castiel looked at her with sympathy. "I understand your need to see him as soon as possible. But it’s much less dangerous if I go alone."
When Sam steps outside the house, the sun is standing high, and Sam checks for the time. He wants to kick something. How many hours have they been missing? They could be anywhere by now.
Dean doesn’t say much when he returns. He mumbles something about potatoes being on sale before heading straight to the kitchen.
"Yes. Sometimes very much so. But I've been trying to learn how not to be for a very long time now. I don’t enjoy it."
"Yeah." Sam gives him a quick glance and a smile that's supposed to be reassuring, and continues staring outside. Then he starts chewing the inside of his cheek.
"This isn't about me, Sam," Dean says after a pause. "This is just me wanting to make sure you are fine. And you think you are, right?"
"Because I didn't want to kill my friend once?" Sam says, and at the quirk of Castiel's eyebrow, he begins to explain. Castiel listens without comment. Sam tries to be diplomatic. "I was biased, but I still think… If I had to do it again, I still wouldn't kill her. Because I knew her. I knew she was a good person."
"Well you got it wrong. I don't." He cocks his head to the side. "You've seen us, what? A few times a year on a hunt, and you think you got us all figured out? I know you care about Sam, but believe me, I can look out for him. I've been doing it all my life."
"I have been meaning to ask you about your increased interest in Sam’s sexual orientation and activities," Castiel finally said.
Dean swallows hard. He takes a step backwards. "No," he finally says. "Nothing’s changed. We’re stuck and we need some outside help."
Dean takes another sip and winces. Getting drunk on your own is fine, but on a desperation-level this feels like barely one step above drinking mouthwash. They've got enough beer here, of course, but getting drunk on beer is so much work. You pee out half of it before you feel a thing. There's one last bottle of whiskey in his room, but he’d have to pass Sam's room and something tells him that he'd stop and eavesdrop.
"I guess I might as well try to get some sleep now. There’s really no telling when Dean will be back."
"I know that's not why he's not here. Don't lie to me." Her voice had grown louder, but she reigned herself in. "But I don't want to argue with you about this topic on my birthday, so let's leave it for the moment."
"This is so crazy! I mean, did we really go back in time?" He reached for the glass in front of him. "This is like that 80s movie my parents made me watch. I probably have to look out so my Mom doesn't fall in love with me and I don't mess up the future!"
He remembered the roaring Impala, the image of his brother and Castiel entwined burnt in his retina. His flask rolling off the seat, reaching for it. The next thing he knew, he'd woken up in a hospital bed to Castiel holding his hand. It'd been the last time he saw him.
"You will see how real I am when I lean over your dying body and my face is the last thing you see."
If there was only one person left in the world who meant anything to you, and that person had made it clear that you were standing in the way of their happiness - it was a difficult thing to ignore.
"Yes." Castiel closed the textbook and pushed it to the side of the table. He returned her serious look. He did not like to conceal the truth from his daughter. It occurred frequently that he had to correct wrong or incomplete notions that Sam or Dean had told her, whether out of shame or just for fun, he could never quite tell. "You’re right, that is what I'm doing. It's a topic that makes me uncomfortable. ”
Dean sighs. He really wishes he wouldn't have to be doing this. "So I guess they haven't told you they're a thing, huh?"
Castiel’s squatting next to the shelf now, in an investigative pose that looks awfully close to something from an old school detective show. He’s just missing the magnifier and the right hat.
Castiel looked at the small bowls and plates on the table with such a heartbreakingly overwhelmed expression on his face, that Sam had to smile.
"She is confused." Castiel patted her head. "This results in her inability to judge the situation correctly. You will never be unwanted."
This isn’t right, Sam thinks. Their messed up brotherhood shouldn’t weigh on Castiel. It shouldn’t stand between Castiel and his happiness.
He felt Castiel’s warm breath against his t-shirt. Its regular rhythm contrasted sharply with Dean's own pounding heart. It took him a while until he managed to speak again.
"I can explain," Castiel started, but Sam had already pounced on him like a cat. So fast that it made even Dean wince.
He awaits them, a tight feeling in his throat, that only gets tighter when nothing happens. No thunder, no disgust, nothing.
"You almost died," Dean says matter-of-factly. "Not just that. You could’ve gotten other people killed, too. You ever thought about that? When you told me you were fit to hunt, that you were fine?"
"Of course. If it'd just been up to me, I probably wouldn't have left in the first place. But Dean-" Castiel sighs. "He seemed so sure that I could help. I could not. I failed. I merely got myself into a dangerous situation. And the both of you by extension." When Sam doesn't reply, he continues: "Dean told me that you managed to solve the case without my help."
"Oh, nothing. There's just..." Castiel now looked straight into his eyes and into his soul. "I can't stop wondering how we would have gone on if I hadn't let you go." He took a deep breath. "No day goes by that I don't miss you, Dean. I..." He didn't get any further because that was the moment when Dean kissed him. One painfully long second passed until Castiel returned his kiss.
"Alright," Dean says, "everyone keeps secrets from everyone. That's just human nature. But yeah, don't worry, I'm not going to ask again and tempt you into breaking your freaking oath or whatever."
"Yeah, but —" Dean startled. He wasn’t sure what he was going to say. That Sam didn’t have to stay if he didn’t want to? That he and Cas could leave if they wanted? Dean wasn’t sure if that was even technically true. Jason was right: There were a lot of people who would object to Sam’s resurrection, and there was no safer place for him than the bunker. And in case they were going to be attacked, it would be wise to stick together for a while.
When Garth offered that Charlie could stay with him and his family overnight, Sam felt overwhelmed by all the possibilities that opened up to him. The museum, eating out, reading books —there were so many things to do when you didn't have a child to take care of. Reality hit a little later.
Sam doesn’t know who moves first. For a moment he’s unsure of why they have to return to the motel at all, when they could just stay right here.
Sam looks him straight in the eye. "A lot of the time," he starts. Pauses. "I — I still feel like I'm not supposed to be here."
"It just made me think Jessica and everything she never got to have, even though she’d deserved to. Everything that was taken from her. Just because of me. Just because she had to die so early because of me. I guess I just couldn’t stand hearing that I’ve ruined another person’s life too."
They were already on the narrow path at the end of which the bunker was hidden, when he spoke again.
"Yeah," Dean swallows hard. "You know, what you said about Sam's hallucination possibly being caused by all the stressed. Maybe you're right. Maybe we're all just overworked and a bit on the edge, and it gets out in different ways... Maybe we just need some time off."
"Please,” Castiel pleaded once more, although he knew he had lost. There was no changing Sam's mind.
Castiel looks at him, somewhere between sternness and sympathy. "You didn't want Sam to think it would have been better for him to join you on the hunt," he says.
"Yeah, I found her under the staff section." On the flyer there's a small map. Someone's drawn a line in red ball pen ink from the pensioner's home to the coffee shop. "The place is just a block from here. Let’s go."
You were never mine before, not at all, but it feels like you kind of are now. Tell me that I’m not crazy.
They're much closer to the car than anticipated. He'd felt like he'd walked a while but the Impala is just a few feet away.
Back when he’d fallen for Castiel, Dean had tried to suppress his feelings for good reason. But there had been all these near-end-of-world moments that prompted emotional confessions, and one thing had led to another and now here he was, exactly where’d never wanted to be, caught in a frustrating relationship he couldn’t quit
It doesn’t feel that great to have someone care about you like that. To have someone hold you. It doesn’t feel that much better.
Except that now Castiel was without the book and still without Sam. Even in his desperation, he should have been able to know that it was a trap.
"I don't think an apple is gonna ruin her appetite,” Dean said, rolling his eyes. "Stop complaining and help me with the other box.”
"Hello," Castiel replies and closes the tab he was just reading, but not before Sam can see it’s a Nebraskan newspaper.
They didn't speak during, not even each other's names. Once Sam had opened the floodgates, there was no turning back and although Sam half-expected him to, Castiel never wavered, never asked if he was sure. Sam was glad for it.
That was a strange question too. After all, they were all waiting for the children to put on street clothes. Where was he supposed to be going in the meantime?
He looks better than he did yesterday, fresher. Behind him on the bed, Sam is yawning and stretching. His arms in the air, his legs a straight line, a strip of skin showing between his trousers and his shirt.
"Oh, you know." Dean coughs and spits blood. "Just your usual lying piece of shit monsters. Fuck! I should have seen it coming!"
"Yeah, okay." Sam takes another sip. He wishes they had Dr Pepper instead; the vending machine only offered a generic coke in a bright green tin. It tastes worse than Pepsi, and that's saying something.
He’s trying to think of the right words, but his thoughts keep getting interrupted by the voice over.
But in that very moment, there had been none of that. He had felt like he used to in the very beginning. Back when Dean and Castiel had finally gotten together after years of back and forth, and Sam had been overjoyed for them. Finally. Damnit. Finally Dean had allowed himself to be happy.
"I mean." She shrugs. "Kind of? But I just slept with the best hunter in the world, and it was pretty good, so I think it was worth it."
"But let me know when you think I’m doing that,“ Dean went on. “Put words in your mouth, I mean. I'm not interested in doing that either. ”
When he looks up, Cas is staring at him and he can’t turn away. He even finds himself saying more things he doesn’t want to say.
"I just meant-” Sam raised his arms apologetically. "Anyways.“ He rubbed over the arch of his eyebrows. "What did you tell Garth?"
He had meant to talk to Sam about Charlie's grace and the danger it posed to her, but it would have to wait.
Dean shoves himself off the bed and walks over to the dresser. He expects Castiel to leave, while he picks out a new pair of boxer shorts and a t-Shirt (his jeans will have to last another few days), but Cas is still in the exact same spot, when Dean turns around again.
"It’d be kind of ironic if he went the drummers’ way," he tells Cas as they pull off Sam’s shoes and throw the blanket over him. "You know, choking on his own vomit in the night."
"Isn't that a weird coincidence," Dean says. "This guys dropping dead right when we begin looking around?"
"She is strong." Why did he have to put his hand on Dean’s face, was it really just to bring him comfort? "Much stronger than you or me." Castiel lowered his eyes. "She no longer needs us to protect her. And Sam also says that it is important to let her go. She must be allowed to live her own life."
The bar is closed of course. It's a hassle finding out who worked last night and then hunting them down at their home address. But at least the barkeeper is in and opens his apartment door straightaway. It doesn't look like he went to sleep yet. When they ask to come in, he leads them inside into a tiny kitchen where they sit around a wooden table with wobbly legs. The barkeeper rubs over his eyes before he takes Sam's phone into his hands. "Yeah, I remember them."
"Dad," Charlie said with reverence. She kept touching his arm. "I still can’t believe you’re really back."
David Banks’ address is only a quick Google search away. His home is about as much a mess as his hair. Dean immediately mistrusts him. He, on the other hand, starts telling them everything before they even have time to reach for their badges. They decline the offer for coffee, but they take a seat on the couch with its crocheted overthrow.
The police station in Carpinteria exuded the typical charm of a functional building built in the seventies. In his time as a hunter, Dean had been in so many stations like this one that they all blurred into one. At least the police station was tiny and the sheriff bored enough to deal with them directly. Dean suspected that this was mostly thanks to Charlie. The guy couldn’t take his eyes off her and kept offering a cup of coffee. He completely ignored Dean.
There's no one in the kitchen either. On the ginormous chrome fridge there is exactly one photograph held in place by a creepy yellow smiley face. Dean pushes the magnet aside to get a proper look at the whole family. They all look unremarkably upper middle class rich, both the parents and the teenager daughter and son. Castiel didn't mention which one's involved but if Dean had to guess, it's the brother.
Just as if they hadn't talked on the phone last night. Or maybe exactly because of that. What did he know?
"Were you really in hell?" He looks away, and she adds, "Sorry, that's probably not something you'd want to talk about. I wasn't thinking."
It’s unlikely that he’ll find something in there that he wouldn’t come across online, but he doesn’t really like reading the news on his phone. And he’s definitely not about to grab the laptop from the car just for some casual case-browsing.
He squeezed her shoulder. “I know you wouldn't annoy me. That's not what this is about. I would love to have you with me."
He had only woken up a few minutes ago. The sun was shining too brightly on his face and when he sat up and looked around he saw what appeared to be a desert with an empty road to the side of him. He raised a hand and felt the sticky blood on his forehead.
"Where the hell have you been?" Dean asks breathlessly, into his hair, as he tightens his arms around his back.
"Well, it’s too late for that anyway. This body is all mine now. And for the most part, I don’t mind it."
"That's not the same," Sam says and pulls away. It's clear that Castiel wants to ask why, but he stays quiet. Sam picks up the tablet, to read the article properly this time.
He won't act on any of the impulses, of course, but somewhere between sending Cas away and now he's stopped denying their existence to himself. It changes surprisingly little about his self perception.
The beginning of darkness brought Dean's reflection onto the window. The image that was reflected in the pane looked so different from what he had in his head when he closed his eyes.
He couldn't tell if she was really targeting the bowl in front of him or just trying to push his hand away, but in the next moment the red plastic plate and its contents sailed on to the tiles.
It feels different than when Castiel’s healing a wound. Sam's always been too focused on the pain, the endorphins and the fear to notice anything else.
"You saw him less than three hours ago." Dean throws him what he hopes to be an 'I can't believe how girly you are' look and not a, well, whatever that mess is he's feeling when they act so relationshipy one. "What could you even have texted him about? You told him all about the scenic route we're taking?"
He takes back the phone and enlarges the picture to take a look at the time stamp. He estimates how long it would take him to catch up with them.
"I tried to teach her how to fight! Because you’re incapable of doing that yourself! Maybe because you forgot how to, after all these years of cushy parenting.”
"Shouldn't we approach him?" Castiel asks, and Dean realizes he's been standing in the doorway just staring into space for far too long.
"Oh, of course." Dean rolls his eyes. "Fan-fucking-tastic. You know, there's a reason we try not to work with other hunters. You just can't trust other people not to fuck it up."
"He gets really weird when he tries to lie, especially when he promised someone not to tell, you know that. Kind of like a child."
It’s not something he thinks he’s able to articulate to anyone, even though he knows he probably should. Especially now, when it’s so clearly what he’s been doing.
She curls her blonde hair around her finger and unnecessarily touches his hand when she slips him the sign-in paper.
Sam bit his lip, suppressing a comment that had less to do with what Dean had said than with his own mood. A mood that had changed fairly quickly from melancholy to irritation since he’d entered the restaurant.
"Hey." Their bodies found another in the dark, and they embraced. Sam's face was wet. Dean could feel his warm body and his racing heartbeat. They hadn't been this close in years. "She’ll understand, don’t worry."
"Sam.” Castiel dared to touch now and squeezed his shoulder gently. He could hear how difficult it was for him to speak, and as much as he wanted to hear what Sam had to say, he also didn't want him to feel pain.
"But you're right, I didn't hesitate or lose a second thought on his sister. And I know what that feels like to-"
Castiel took a step away from Dean. "Unhappiness is one thing, it is something that can be worked on. But if you think so little of me, if you think I'm with you out of some lower motives - why do you think I've shared all these years with you, if you meant so little to me?”
"I didn’t mean Stanford. I meant earth." He laughed. He took his time as if he wanted to make sure to have enough words to fill the silence. "I mean, I like to be back and I’m thankful for every day I get but sometimes…" He took a deep breath. "I don’t know. I guess sometimes it just feels like I shouldn’t be here."
It takes a while until Cas answers in a slow and steady voice. "You are a good person, Sam Winchester."
Not for the first time, he thinks a bunker might not be the best place for someone depressed. Maybe he should try and get more daylight. Spend more time outside. They could do research outside in the woods instead of in the library sometimes. They could get away more often to get lost in each other and forget time. It's different in the bunker, where it always feels like you're only waiting, going from one case to another and another. Where Dean is always at the forefront of Sam's mind.
"Dean." The blue eyes looking back at him were too smart and too grown up. "I don't want to live with him anymore. I just wanted to stay with you."
"No,” Sam said. "It's not really about the cinema itself. It wouldn't be much better if we did something else together.”
"None of your business," he says, which is not a good way to get rid of suspicion. Sam's interest is piqued now.
"Your grace?" They had talked a lot over the three days. About music, movies, monsters, angels, hunting and everything in between - but very little about things that affected their actual lives. "I thought that was still sealed off?"
"I never really thought about it much," he says. "But I guess so. Back in the day, our hunts used to be a lot more straight forward. Almost everything we were up against back then was stuff my Dad would have already written about."
Sam and Castiel exchange a quick look. "It was fine," Sam says. It's obvious he wants to ask more about Dean's hunting partner, but something is holding him back. Dean's looking forward to the day when Sam snaps out of it, and stops acting so scared around him. As if Dean would ever hurt him.
They lock eyes, and Dean bites down on his lip, so he won't say any of the thoughts running through his head. Jesus, he's so tempted to keep this conversation going. 'My feelings for you," Castiel said - was that meant in the past or present? It would be so easy to ask and Castiel, he would answer. He would answer truthfully. Dean is almost sure of that. But then, what is he going to do with the answer? They all would be terrible in some way.
They stand in front of the car and drink in silence. Sam's always got his phone close in case Dean calls. And maybe they're inching in his direction, but that only means that they'd reach him quicker if he called. Sam is not going to go if Dean doesn't want him to.
"Everything has an order in heaven and everyone has a task to fulfill." He considered how to best explain. "There is nothing superfluous there. Nobody does something just for fun. Nobody dances or paints a picture."
Dean snorted. “Maybe later. Right now I just- " He didn't finish his sentence. He cocked his head and watched Castiel for a long time.
He hoped he wasn’t inconveniencing Charlie. She wasn’t a child anymore. He was just her uncle. He shouldn’t have come.
Dean looks back at the hotel. Then at Castiel. "I needed to get outside too," Dean says. "I thought I'd drive around for a bit."
There’s a hard thump in Sam’s chest that he knows shouldn’t be there. But he also knows they shouldn’t be having this conversation at all, not here, not now, not ever.
"Sam." The sharp tone was gone. Castiel got up and went to him. He put his hands on Sam’s shoulders. "The wedding and this trip is a nerve-wracking time for all of us. My question about your condition... I’d assumed that it was the current stressful situation that’s causing your bad mood and your detachment. That’s why I tried to give you space and not urge you to explain yourself. You know that I’m always there for you."
"I know." Sam nods. "But I messed up, Cas. I know I messed up." Sam stands up, all 6.5 of him looking lost and way too tall beside Baby.
When Castiel walked in, Sam was taken aback by the sheer absurdity of it all. Castiel carried a bunch of wrapped gifts piled up so high, he could just barely look past them.
Sam watched him for a moment, unable to identify the mix of emotions inside him, beside the relief to see his brother return - he seemed unharmed.
He was amazed every time he was in here. It didn't look like the room of one single child, but rather as if ten different people of all ages lived in here. A poster of a teeth-fletching Tyrannosaur Rex hung over the pink doll's corner, and alongside the children's books, there was a stack of non-fiction books Dean wouldn't have picked up if someone had paid him to.
"In retrospect you could," Castiel says. "But you've spent plenty of time before wondering about what's amiss with your brother or why he's upset."
Then they left the building and strolled a few meters to a park-like green area with a bench where they sat down.
"If it’s the associated memories of Jessica that are bothering you," Castiel started, but Sam shook his head.
Dean's FBI suit is still damp from the rain the next morning. He dries it with the weak-ass blow dryer for a good ten minutes, but even then the cloth still feels sticky against his skin.
Sam definitely remembers coming back to the table and feeling like he’d interrupted something. He also remembers the feeling of jealousy at their shared smiles, and that feeling turning into something completely different when he’d watched Castiel drink the iced coffee.
Sam looked at the garment on the floor, which seemed to him almost like a part of Castiel's body. Without the trench coat, he looked completely naked.
Sam understands now that they’re jumping right back into a discussion they must have started when he wasn’t around. Maybe this morning before they’d left, maybe while he was in the shower or still asleep.
Sam picks up his phone again to re-read Dean's e-mail to Jody. It's strange alright, a little erratic, but not something worrisome by itself. If he got an email like this, Sam would mainly think Dean hadn't slept for a few days.
"So," Sam says after taking a tentative second sip and putting the can on the ground. "Did she tell you anything useful?"
"Jesus..." Dean puts a hand over his mouth and lets it slide down. He walks over to Sam and grabs him by the arm.
Sam looks down at his hands in his lap. He feels grateful for her words and yet he wants to contradict her. "It's a weird thing to think about, isn't it? Why you care about someone?"
"Yes," Castiel says. "I assume the distinction you're drawing would hold true between humans as well?"
Dean raises an eyebrow and glances at the man again. It's not the first time a guy is hitting on him. Usually Dean is quick to shut it down. Maybe he's feeling a little bit intrigued, just as much as he's irritated. "I take it you're not."
Jody's eyes are big when she sees them. "Oh my God, Sam! What happened?" Then she searches Dean's face for an answer. "Is he-?"
A little later, when Dean was lying under his blanket, trying to swallow the taste of bile, he heard Sam restlessly turning in his bed.
"Yeah," she smiles. She shakes her head with a softness that surprises him. Then, more surprising still, she bursts out laughing. "Jesus, you must think I'm really easy."
Sam's expression got slightly desperate. "She does, but what kind of kid likes to go to school when their favorite uncle comes to visit?"
Sam feels a hand on the back of neck. It's soft and not callous at all, but it makes him quiver nonetheless. He half-expects to have his face pushed into the pillow, to be held down until his breathing becomes labored.
There was a knock on the door, and a second later Castiel's face appeared in the doorframe. "Are you both okay with pizza for dinner?"
He gets two cold beers from the fridge, knowing Sam won’t want one, but that he’ll understand the gesture.
Castiel smiles at him, grateful, and Dean allows himself to linger on his face a moment. His mouth, the softness of his skin, his eyes. It's really not the same blue at all. He tears himself away and clears his throat.
"The same way she wants to please you by inhaling all that useless shit about heaven, or the way she's trying to please Sam by pretending that she's into ballet and the whole apple pie bullshit?"
"You're good at this," Lucifer laughs. "You're so good at this and no one even knows. What a waste, Sam, such a talent."
The terrifying “everything will fall apart any minute now” feeling recedes. And makes room for a quasi-normalcy.
Jody gets up from the table, halts and turns around again. She looks at Sam up and down. "I really wish I could make you guys stay a bit longer. I'd feel a lot better."
"That does not mean that we stop worrying about her. I don’t think that point will ever come." Castiel hesitated. "Furthermore, I believe that this argument has little to do with Charlie herself. I think a lot of Charlie’s actions trigger different feelings and insecurities in ourselves. But this isn’t on her."
Castiel takes a step away from the fridge, so they are toe to toe. "If you have patience with me, I want to learn." He takes one of Sam's hands in his. The heels of Sam's hands are red-lined from where he's dug them into the kitchen counter.
Anything, Everything, would have been the answer he'd wanted to give and not be able to give. An answer Dean would never have accepted anyway. Not that Dean had ever been a person who accepted apologies and just moved on. No hard feelings.
Dean took a look in the fridge and their pantry. He wasn’t gonna write an actual list, obviously, but it couldn’t hurt to see what they were low on. Besides the drinks selection, which he was all too conscious about needing a restock. When he was done, he walked back to Charlie’s room. He was surprised to hear Castiel’s voice. Dean had talked to him in their room just a moment ago.
Sam's not sure if that's supposed to make him feel better. The fact that he himself creates these kind of scenarios in his head, is only further proof that a part of him chooses this. That it's his own fault, and he's got to find a way to stop. If not for himself than for what he has here, for him and Castiel.
Castiel shook his head. “A nephilim is always stronger than the angel who created it. Charlie's powers are comparable to those of an archangel.”
"Well, all right. You got me," Sam says. "I messed up — what do you want me to do about it now?" Sam hates the defensiveness in his voice. When his eyes cross Castiel's, he looks disconcerted.
"I am glad to hear it." Castiel puts his palm on top of Sam’s hand. "I was very much looking forward to seeing you. Your reaction to my arrival confounded me."
"But what you really want is someone who is always with you and who no longer divides and complicates your life. Someone who offers physical closeness but also understands you. With whom you can talk and who shares some of your interests. Someone who loves you for who you are."
"I know it's just because of Charlie. I know Dean is trying to be civil because he wants to keep her in his life, but sometimes it's still so... bizarre.”
"Dean." Castiel grabs both of his hands tightly. "While I’m gone…" He looks torn, deeply uncomfortable.
He snorted into the receiver. Sam was still looking straight at him, but his eyes had changed from angry to almost compassionate.
"When we were in purgatory?" Castiel asks. His eyes glaze over. Longing, Sam thinks, or at least some sort of nostalgia.
"I'm not asking for any brokering tips or how to plant flowers in my garden. I just want us to spend time together like... " Sam searched for the right words. "Like normal brothers."
"If you want my help," Dean says, after a moment of quiet. "I'm here to help. If you don't, I won't. That's all I'm trying to say. You can't have it both ways."
"Charlie, I have a bad feeling about this. We have no idea what’s going on and there were three of them and there’s only two of us."
Castiel's voice went straight through Sam's heart. The almost painful cry far too direct and intimate to witness.
"Even if he might say he doesn't want you there, I know he really does." She ran a finger over a hole in her jeans. "Besides, it doesn't matter what he thinks anyway, because I want you to come with me."
Castiel clasped his hands together in his lap and eventually said: "I would have told you, Sam. I wanted to have the facts straight. I wanted to know what it meant for her, before I told you. I didn't want to upset or scare you."
It’s not so much the memory of Lucifer that he can’t take. It’s the memory of himself in Hell, of who he became down there.
"Look for them," she says. "I will find out more about Aleithia. If she's not dead, we might still have to deal with her and it'd be better to be prepared."
"Come on, cheer up," Dean says. "We just saved a bunch of people from their imminent death. That's got to be worth a smile, Sammy."
"Jesus, don't go and read parallels into everything, okay? These snot-nosed idiotic teenagers aren't us. If you ask me, they got a pretty good deal. Without us, they'd all be dead."
Sam immediately returns the hug. "Yeah," he mumbles into the top of Castiel's head, a strand of hair tickling his nose. "This is good."
Sam’s not surprised, either. He’s also not angry. He mainly feels foolish that he tried to act like Dean’s feelings for Castiel weren’t a mere fact. He took Dean’s denial at face value because it paired well with his own interests.
"Dean." His stomach contracted when Castiel looked at him in surprise. He hadn't seen him in over a year and now they were staring at each other like two spooked deer.
It’s obvious what she’s thinking of them, how she’s interpreting both Dean’s rejection of her and the way Castiel is standing so close behind him that he can hear the rhythm of his breathing.
"I bought new dishes and some other stuff." Sam shrugged. "It's kind of wild how much money you can spend on these kind of things." And then when Dean didn't answer: "Come on, sit down. I’ll go get the coffee."
Or maybe it’s the fact that all the women he’s been with after the cage seemed like they’d have had a hard time overpowering him, lulling him into a false sense of security. They hadn’t been powerful angels with the ability to smite you in a second. Normally, it doesn’t feel like there’s anything Castiel has in common with Lucifer, and he plans to keep it that way.
Sam’s never really known how to feel about it. Dean's and Cas' whole... thing. And he's still not entirely sure what he makes of it. But he does know that when two people are in love, denying it the way Dean did is a recipe for disaster. It's just not fair to string someone along and then push them away, whenever they got too close.
Dean's face falls more with each word. There are times this would amuse Sam. That's why he did it after all, to try and fall back into their routine of jovial back and forth. It works on Dean, but it backfires anyway in that it makes Sam feel hollow. Like he's watching himself do a bit. Even though he meant him to, it irritates him that Dean falls for it. Sam hates when he feels anger that he can't justify.
"We should go," he says. She's surprised; they haven't combed through everything. But one look at Sam's face, and she pulls her ponytail tight and nods. "Sure, but where?"
"So she wasn't who we thought we were, so what?" It's not like it's the first time this has happened. You think someone's the culprit, you apologize and move on to killing the actual monster. It's not the time to dwell on your mistakes.
"I told you. Because I was curious if he'd seen her again," Castiel says, he takes a small step closer to Sam. "Were you reading something into my question that I didn't intend?"
Him freaking out. The music. Dean singing. The gas station. Cas’ warm fingers. Waking up. Falling asleep to Dean’s and Cas' intimate murmuring. The bar and the jealousy. That goddamn kiss.
Dean leans out of the red vinyl seat, reaches over to the table next to theirs and fetches the thin paper.
When he's back in the car, he can tell the mood has shifted. They're all smiles. They must have talked. It irks Dean to know how little time they need without him to work things out. How much better Castiel is at making Sam better now. At taking care of him. "Weird, huh?" Sam says, his neck craned so he can look at Castiel's face as he agrees with him, "Yes, very." Dean doesn't even have a freaking clue what they're talking about, but it makes him so angry. These smiles on their faces. Right about now he's not sure which one of them he hates more and which one he loves the most. All he knows is that they're both breaking his heart.
Castiel closes his eyes  and puts his head down onto Sam's chest again. "There are many places I'd like to show you, but also places I haven't been that I would want to see. Places from your past. Places that mean something to you."
"I think I just walked into Sam and Castiel making out?" She asks quickly, in a way that sounds like she's bracing herself for a bad reaction.
The lack of a victim is more troubling, but he decides if she’s here somewhere they will find her after they’ve killed the vamps.
"How?" Castiel smiles wryly. "Genocide could happen to anyone?" Sam wishes Castiel would stop using that word.
"What kind of asshole would do that? Predestinate this?" He breathes into Cas’ shirt. "What’s the point? Why should I keep trying, why should I-"
"Let’s go home," Charlie said into the silence of the night, when there were only the two of them left.
"To the bathroom." He stands in front of Castiel, waiting for him to get up. "I’m sure you’re right and you’ll be able to mend this thing soon, but until then you should disinfect the wound… and maybe take some painkillers. You really look like shit."
When have they ever had a semi-break from anything big for this long? Castiel being captured had felt big, of course, but if it’d really only been a few angels holding a grudge, objectively it wasn’t quite apocalypse-bad. Besides, even if anyone was still out to get Castiel, it wouldn’t work a second time. He’d try and make sure of that.
That was Dean's cue. He jumped out of his cover, whirled around, and held the angel's sword to the distracted angel's throat.
"If you wanted me to shut up, I wouldn’t be here right now. Ah-" Lucifer wiggles his finger. "I know what you’re going to say next. That I’m not really here. Well, I know that, you know that. So let’s skip right past that. I'm here in all the ways that matter. You ever thought about why that is? Why I’m in your head? That angel of yours —or well, your brother's, if we’re going to be honest— he took the crazy away. And sure, you’re almost a functioning person again. So what gives? Why do you think I’m still here?"
The lights went on, fusing everything in blinding white. Sam's expression was strangely soft, as it was before he brought people bad news.
"Because if she's whatever we're hunting, she obviously knows what you're looking for. You gave away our element of surprise."
"He didn't get an organic brand." Her glare suggested that it was a matter of life and death. "Maybe he doesn't care that if we continue to shoot so much CO2 into the atmosphere, the world will be an uninhabitable place in thirty years because he will be long dead by then. But since I still can’t use my grace, I have a legitimate interest that his generation does not plunder the earth like-" she paused, "like an electrical store on Black Friday."
“Right," Sam hikes up a corner of his mouth into a half-smile. Castiel squeezes his hand. "I didn't think I'd ever have this again," Sam eventually says and nods outside the front window. "Normalcy like this. Not just going on a date... Everything. It always seemed like it was either or. You can either lead a hunter's life. Or you can lead a normal life away from all the supernatural. A life which, if you're lucky, you get to spend it with someone you love. But I really didn’t think both was possible anymore. Not for me anyway." He gets quieter. "Hell, to be honest, I didn’t think love was in the cards for me anymore at all."
Her cowboy boots make an unnerving screeching sound as their metal caps scratch over the floor, as Dean turns her around.
"It’s got to be this place. I mean, it’s insane that she’s here out of all the places to be." Another stone flew and made waves on the water. "It feels like everything’s just going circles. Like I’m losing everyone I care about to this shitty university. I mean, how many universities are there? And it had to be this one?!"
It's a nice thought, but Dean doesn't really entertain the notion of a holiday. It's something normal people do. People who have a mortgage or pay rent, with a schedule and a regular job, who don't expect to die any day now.
"Room number?" asked the woman at the entrance to the dining room. Dean had to figure out what she meant at first and then tried to remember his room number. Finally he pulled out his key; the number was engraved onto the keychain.
"Jesus..." Dean shakes his head. "Hope you feel better soon," he says and it sounds pretty sarcastic to Sam's ears.
Dean stood in front of the Impala, arms crossed over his chest. He seemed a little tired, but otherwise he looked good, relatively healthy too.
"Oh, Charlie. No. There is nothing you just have to make right." Sam stroked over her hair like he had done when she was a child.
Something in the look that Sam and Cas shared turned his stomach. He couldn’t even say what it was that was fueling his anger. It made him feel like they were playing Piggy in the middle and he was the pig.
"He must have." Sam shrugs. "Otherwise, I would have remembered, wouldn't I? Later that day they both acted totally normal around me. Like nothing had happened. So I figured... I mean, I was really young. I felt weird about it but I also didn't really have anything to compare it to. Maybe I figured watching your father threaten your brother with a kitchen knife wasn't that big of a deal?" It sounds absurd said out loud.
He snaps himself out of his thoughts. Jody comes to stand before him. There's two brown paper bag in her arms, filled to the brim with groceries.
"Sam, if you need more help taking care of her, all you have to do is ask. You know how much I like to spend my time with both of you."
Sam can see the disappointment in Cas' eyes every time anew, as if he hasn't been shoved away countless times before. He should be used to it by now.
Sam runs a hand down his face and wonders if he's overinterpreting this; he most definitely is. "I know. Sorry." He wants to stand up and get dressed, or just sleep alone in his bed at least. When Castiel's tentative hand reaches for Sam's knee, he has to suppress the urge to shove it off. The fact that Castiel must think they stopped because Sam's seeing things, because he's broken and malfunctioning, makes Sam's stomach turn.
She’s a good cook. Sam is almost tempted to take a second helping of the lasagne. He takes another drink of his beer instead.
Communication is a two way street, and Sam knows this isn’t on Castiel alone. He can't expect Castiel to just know what he wants of him when he’s never told him.
Sam nodded, slightly overwhelmed. "I have to see if I can get a day off. I'm not sure if I'm working that weekend."
Castiel's face remains grim. "It seems like in so many cases I'm more of a hindrance to you two than a help."
"I need to tell Dad something before we leave." Charlie tore herself away from Sam and sped out of her room into the hall.
"Well, love. Feelings. Just life in general. I don’t think any of it is fair. I thought you’d already figured this out. God being an absent father and all that…" He touches Castiel’s shoulder. "Sorry. That’s just the way I see these things anyway. You probably shouldn’t listen to me. I don’t mean to be such a downer."
"I'm sorry," she stutters. "I didn't mean to —" Gone is the self-assured woman Sam's spent the day with. She's sunken in size. She scrambles up to her feet.
"I was serious, Sam," Dean didn’t let him finish. "I only care that you are back and that Charlie is fine. This is a win for us. I’m not saying it’s not gonna be awkward for a while, but we can do this, right? And I’m glad Cas..." He hesitated. "I am glad that Cas and I are on good terms again. And look, I’m not saying I’m over what happened or that I’ll ever really be. But I’m trying to see it like this: Being alone sucked. And the fact that I get to have the most important people in my life again is pretty much a miracle anyway." He had forgotten the beer in his hand and took a gulp; it was icy cold.
He knocks twice before he considers the possibility that Dean has left. At the fourth knock the door swings open. Dean seems annoyed at being disturbed, like someone desperate to get back to his plans, but when Sam steps in he can't figure out what he might have been doing. His things are packed away, his bed is made, the bathroom door closed. Wet clothes hang over the back of a chair.  It takes Sam a moment to recognize Castiel's trench coat, darkened by the rain, among them.
Charlie looked up from her textbook and considered him. In addition to preparing for the SATS, they had started to incorporate books into her lessons that were intended for college freshmen. In general, Charlie had seemed interested in the contents of "Introduction to Psychology”. But today she was going on tangents every five minutes. Her thoughts were clearly somewhere else.
"Do you consider direct blood lines to be the main definer for what makes a family 'real'?" Castiel asks, holding out the cup to Sam, who takes it back.
"What?" Sam shakes his head. What nonsense strategy of aversion is this? Just more denial on that staggeringly large heap of denial. "Are you trying to tell me I was hallucinating?"
She is confused, but when probed she admits that the assistant hasn't been in today. "I couldn't reach her at all. If she's in any danger, I need to know."
"It's too late for the morgue now, but one of the victims didn't live too far away, right? We could swing by there now." Dean looks at Jody. "Or did you already visit her family?"
"Cas, I told you before, I'm fine!" He shoots Castiel a look, that Dean's never seen his brother give the angel before. One that tells him to shut up.
A prickling feeling of pride overcame him. He looked at his daughter for a moment, thinking that she would be fine. That despite everything he, Cas and, in his own way, Dean had brought her up well. Or at least hadn’t messed her up too much.
Dean feels cornered. Every single time this happens, he has to tell himself that Sam can't read his thoughts. What's on his mind that is so scandalous, anyway? That he wouldn't mind to feel Castiel's hand on his skin a little longer? What is this, Victorian times? He wasn't even thinking anything inappropriate for fuck's sake.
Castiel mulls this over for a while, and then, right when he opens his mouth, Sam feels an instance of dread. But Castiel just says: "I have liked most of what we've done so far."
"How is it going in here?“ Sam walked up to her chair, put his arm around the back of the chair, kissed her cheek, and then looked at the documents on the desk.
"Well, great," Charlie said, standing up. "I guess then I'll bow to you and your tyrannic regime once more." With that, she disappeared out of the room.
So Castiel starts talking instead. He tells Sam of their day, and leaves out all the bits that really matter.
"Of course, I told her about Charlie. Hiding the fact that I have a child would have been such an asshole move. And at first she took it really well too. I think she was kind of glorifying the whole single father thing— ” He suddenly laughed when he thought about enthusiastic she had been. "And well, I admitted that I wasn't exactly a single parent. That I was raising her with Charlie's father, who is my brother's partner, who also happens to helps a lot." He would never forget the look she had given him. "It was all downhill from there."
He had never visited Sam in Stanford. They hadn't really split on good terms. Although Dean hadn't actually had anything to do with the conflict between Sam and their father, Sam had abandoned him to, left him behind like a tattered old sweater. Dean had known that Sam would have been ashamed of his stupid primitive brother if he had shown up in Stanford. That wasn't all though. If Dean was really honest with himself, he hadn't visited him because he couldn't stand to see this different version of Sam. He had been afraid that he would find that they were no longer connected, that they were alien. Strangers like they were now.
"Have you met me?" He laughed a little, and Sam gave him the courtesy and laughed too. They patted each other’s backs, as if only they played their parts right, things would fall into place eventually.
Castiel nods, but he doesn't look convinced. Sam takes a step forward to put the tablet down onto the table.
Castiel gets out of his crouching position. He looks at Sam with big eyes. "Yes," he says, "let's." But he doesn't move. So Sam doesn't either.
Castiel smiles up at him, his thankful expression strikes Sam as oddly… pure. It rattles Sam's low self worth, having someone look at him this way. His first impulse is to avert his eyes. Instead, he waits for the second impulse to come. He puts his cup onto the hood of the car and lays both of his palms on the sides of Castiel's face.
"I have limited knowledge of these things. I don’t know if Sam would like me to share these things with you."
Castiel sits in the passenger seat of the car, next to Dean, who’s not turning the engine on, who’s not moving at all, who’s just staring ahead.
"You can't play pool half as well as me." Dean shrugged. "And there's supposed to be a haunted abandoned farmhouse near Olathe. Maybe I'll take a look on the way back."
"I don't know. I've never had therapy. Probably should have — I guess every hunter could use it. Plus I have a terrible taste in men, so I got some issues there too."
it he was trying to do here, he wondered. He shrugged. “Some people just enjoy a glass of wine with a good meal. In France, for example-"
belonged to him. For years, his brother had slept his way through the beds of America until the thing with Castiel had happened. From bedding world champion to a quasi marriage, one moment to the next. A complete 180°.
"What exactly is your problem?” Dean turned from the bag he had just cleared to Sam. His demeanor had changed. "You've been in such a crappy mood all day. If you think Garth and a few other people coming over is such a horrible idea, why don't you just say it?”
Dean bends down and grabs the bottle of whiskey next to his bed that he left there last night and had forgotten about until now. Castiel readily accepts it and drinks the remainder.
"I don't like the plane." She held up the small plush airplane she'd been given at a travel agent’s. Sam leaned over and tried to close her seat belt. "Your ears snap off in planes."
Only now that he looked his brother in the face did Sam notice that Dean was freshly showered and wearing a crisp shirt. He smelled of aftershave.
"You should feel honored. If I try to sing her a lullaby, she puts her finger to her lips and says something like: Shhhh, silence."
"When I look at you, Sam, I do not see Heaven’s intent for you. I see someone who is unafraid of unabashedly being himself."
He sat like that for a while, aware he was just playing for time. Actively delaying the moment he'd no longer be alone.
And if bad things happen then, it's your own doing, isn't it? When bad things happen because of choices you've made-
"People fear us so much that they have written legends about us." He had come closer. "But I'm not alone. There are many of us. Women, men and children. But how does it feel to be the only one of your kind?" He was still smiling. "The angels: to say they hate you is almost an understatement. And the humans?" He shrugged. "You can go to as many 'save the world' meetings you want, you will never be one of them. They can feel how different you are."
"So it can't be soullessness," Sam says. "Besides, why would that be temporary? Who'd take a soul for a week and then give it back?"
The fact that he’d be happy for Dean if this thing right here, whatever this is, were to happen to him, unsettles him somehow.
"Dean." The instant relief in Castiel's voice as he says his name feels good. "I'm in the girl's bedroom now, unsure of how to proceed further."
"It's not... it doesn't feel like that. It wasn't like I was having visions. I knew I was hallucinating."
Like they’re former roommates and not whatever you’d call what they were. He tends to shy away from the words his mind offers up. Abuser. Victim. It doesn’t sound right. It doesn’t seem to correspond to what he knows happened, what he felt and still feels.
“Hey, you know what, that's great. It's fine,” he said now, his voice only a little on the hysterical side. “You found each other after all this time! Way to go! And now nobody stands between you." And then when neither of them protested, Dean added: "And I finally know for sure that I wasn't crazy or paranoid or all the other shit you guys were calling me! At least I know I can trust myself."
He did not spend a lot of time thinking about the pregnancy itself anymore. Not even about how it had come about. Of course he wished he hadn’t lied to Dean. Of course he wished he’d never hurt him. But regretting the night with Castiel always at least implied regretting Charlie’s birth too. And he felt a gnawing sense of guilt, looking at his daughter and thinking he wished he’d never let Castiel kiss him that night, wishing he’d never gotten so drunk in the first place. Because the truth of the matter was, he regretted it every day and didn’t at the same time. He wanted her not to have been born and still wanted her to exist. He never tried to linger on these thoughts too long, because it always felt like his thoughts were either betraying Dean or Charlie - or both of them at the same time.
"What happened tonight was unfortunate," Castiel said. "I was very worried too, but Charlie will be okay. And so will everyone. We have weathered much worse."
Castiel nodded, "nothing happened. He gave me a soda, and I have been watching him play the game. He's really nice Dean. You should come with me. I was going to get us something to eat and then watch him play some more." Castiel,  shuffled his feet,  "he kind of smells like you, just a little different."
Dean pulled his hand away,  "I don't want to, but it's worth a lot and there's three of us to feed and house, Sam." He put them safely away, then stared at his bare finger. "Cas, let's go to bed," he said quietly after a moment.
Castiel nuzzled closer to him as he ate. "What was your mom like?" he asked, curious about the omega that had raised such a strong and caring alpha.
Castiel shivered; he knew too. John would have made good on his threat. Castiel nodded and smiled, "he's a great alpha, and one day he will be a great father." He then saw someone walking towards them with two bags with chips and other snack foods. Castiel let go of Dean and walked around Michael. He looked at the alpha and called out, "Luke?"
"I had come to get Dean some breakfast, only to find a disobedient omega," Felix said roughly and reached for Castiel's arm.
Anna thought about that and chimed in, "maybe you should go talk to him. Leave Castiel where he is safe, and talk to your father. Make him see what he is doing to the business."
Castiel looked down and said, "I'm sorry. I'm just scared that what John said will happen. That if I don't have a pup I'll be sent back to the breeding house."
"Okay. We can do that, that way you can have sex anytime and not have to worry about pups," Dean went to find Charlie, she'd know the best brands to get.
Castiel whined, but nodded, understanding,  "okay. Could you send him a gift? Please?" He didn't want Adam to feel to alone. "I'll stay on this side of the house so you can work and not worry."
Castiel nodded and kissed his alpha's lips lightly before going to turn the tv on. He sighed as he changed his ruined shirt since he had ripped it earlier to try and stop Adam's bleeding nose. He stared at the large bed a moment, instoncts tugging at him.
"Shhh," Dean's arm squeezed him a little tighter, "we have to act like that's none of our business. He didn't do anything illegal. I know it's hard."
"Not yet. Michael..he...um...he told me he can't have pups," he replied, not wanting to embarrass his big brother.
"Brother? Cas, is he telling the truth?" Charlie asked, looking back to Castiel. Castiel nodded, "He is. I just got scared. I haven't seen him in five years, our parents told him I left home when they really sold me to that breeding house." He was holding onto her shirt feeling safer with her there. Charlie lowered the mace, and then put it away, "okay. Do you want me to call Dean?" Castiel shook his head. "No. He'll think I got hurt."
Castiel panted, eyes bright gold and pupils dilated. He kissed him back, his body tensing in pleasure. Unable to hold back any longer, he came with a low groan of pleasure, his body gushing even more slick for his alpha.
Castiel nodded and said, "Thank you, alpha Dean." He smiled, this felt better, and hoped he would remember this. Castiel relaxed and dozed off on Dean's lap, going limp against his chest and making Dean chuckle softly.
"I just want a friend, and he's acting like I want more than that with you. I just want a friend," he whimpered over and over, feeling so broken, almost more so than being at the breeding house. Maybe that was what he deserved, to be made to have pups and never get to hold them, cuddle them, raise them. Why was him wanting a friend, regardless of who it was, so bad?
"Oh, yes, I do. I needed something small to cuddle and I found him. I hope it's okay," Castiel said softly and Charlie smiled gently,
John rubbed his head, "a little. Is Dean getting his work done?" He was always a little more subdued after a night of drinking.
"Sure, Cas. Choose any show you want. Why don't you turn it on and I'll call down for dinner?" Dean replied quietly, feeling exhausted as he got  up to go to the phone connected to the other parts of the mansion for convenience.
"I..." Dean paused, sighing, "unfortunately, yes." He stroked hands down Castiel's back, "I'm sorry things have become so difficult, Cas. You must hate me by now."
Castiel clung to him and whimpered, "I'm sorry Dean. I tried so hard, but then he said... I'm so sorry." He buried his face in Dean's neck. He had just ruined Dean. He knew it, John would not let him keep working in the family business, or stay in the mansion. He destroyed their lives.
Dean sighed in exasperation, "not my fault he has a hangover, Felix. He can still work or things can wait an hour." He stepped inside his rooms, "my mate is the most important thing in my life, as my mother was to my father. It'll stay that way too." He slammed the door and gently dropped Cas to the bed, climbing to press him down with his weight and kiss him again.
"I agree. In fact, I think I'll turn in early too. He made such a pretty nest, we might as well use it. Thanks, Charlie," Dean smiled and gently scooped Castiel up against his chest.
"I can do that. Thanks, Charlie," Dean ruffled her hair affectionately and headed to the spare bedroom to find Cas, smiling when he saw him arranging everything into a nest, "do you want me to ask Charlie for extra blankets?"
Dean kissed him back, holding him in his arms. "The nest looks amazing," he told him lovingly, "could just use a couple more pillows, hm?"
John had had an affair, and that had to upset Dean and Adam. However, Adam had nothing to do with that, he was innocent from it and didn't ask for it to happen. Was that really the only reason he was so disliked?
The last thing Castiel had expected was a tongue over his hole and he gasped in surprise. It felt good, and he melted a little when Dean's tongue began lapping at him again.
Castiel stood up slowly and got Adam's plate. "I'll see you at 5 to get measured for the dress for the charity thing," he turned and started out of the kitchen, heading towards Adam's room.
In the store Castiel couldn't believe all the food he saw. He stayed close to Charlie and was thrilled to see cakes, cookies, and all kinds of baked goods. The wide variety of fruits was also amazing. "Oh, Charlie. Can I have this?" he asked, picking up a pineapple.
Dean smiled at the sound of Castiel singing softly in the shower and dialed Charlie, speaking with her briefly and she said she'd pick them up in an hour with some clothes. He told her the room number, thanked her over and over and she just laughed and hung up on him. Dean threw a pillow at Sam, "hey, get up. We've got a temporary home."
Dean cupped Castiel's chin and rubbed his thumb across his bottom lip gently, looking thoughtful. "Okay. If you want to spend time with him, I won't argue. It'll be good for you to not be alone," he leaned in and kissed Castiel softly, running fingers through Castiel's already unruly hair.
Castiel sighed, "I won't. I asked Dean if I could go visit, but he said right now it would not be a good idea. I hope he gets better soon. Maybe I shouldn't have met him, at least then he wouldn't have been hurt because of me."
"Sure, Cas. Anything you like. I'll wear a blue vest, like your eyes." Dean grinned, kissing him again lightly. "I'll have them bring some cloth samples. In the meantime, would you like to go swimming?"
Castiel tensed, looking at the ground. Adam had been comforting him, he wasn't doing anything sexual. "Bye, Adam," he whispered weakly before he left Adam's room, slowly closing the door behind him.
Dean kissed back up Castiel's body, stopping to suck and nibble his nipples a moment as he moved his way back up to his mouth.
Charlie laughed, "well, thank you very much. I like your eyes, they're very pretty." She plopped down on a chair, crossing her legs, "so, mating ceremony?
The tailor measured efficiently, obviously talented at his craft. "Did you have a specific style in mind?" he asked Castiel, who nodded.
Dean just stayed a few paces away, looking at him sadly, his scent soured with displeasure. "I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I thought you were beginning to see my dad is the only bad alpha around here." He quietly stood there a moment, "come on. I'll show you back inside. You can be alone if you want."
"Theres something else, a bonus that dad included in the paperwork specifically for you, Cas," Dean said slowly, taking a breath, "he got you visitation rights for Jack."
"So, he arrived. I told Felix I wanted to inspect him first," John growled lowly as he started towards the now clean and dressed omega. Castiel almost wished he hadn't showered, now nothing was covering his own omega scent.
Anna smiled and rubbed her belly as she ate slowly. She watched Dean with Castiel and could see the alpha being a loving and protective father to the pups they would have one day.
Sam looked torn, trying to figure out what to do, "maybe he shouldn't be speaking this way, but he does belong to Dean. Dean should be the one who decides the punishment and how to go through with it." Sam knew his brother would be kind, "besides, he's new. He isn't trained like the omegas in the past. Let Dean train him before judging his fitness."
Outside there was a car waiting, which the beta shoved Cas into the back of. "Stay quiet and speak only when spoken to," He advised, turning on the car.
Castiel smiled and softly said, "I got this just for you alpha, come to bed." He then got on his knees on the edge of the bed closest to his mate and motioned for him to come closer.
Castiel's eyes widened in awe at the suggestion, a grin appearing on his face. "Could I see the pool? And horses? I've never seen one in person before," he was so surprised that Dean was giving him so many choices. Omegas weren't supposed to get a choice in anything. "Can I pet one of the horses, please?" He asked Dean, voice soft and sounding more like a child then an adult.
Dean looked at the stack of files as well, "yes, unfortunately. You're welcome to hang around but it might get boring." He pulled Cas tight to his chest a moment, sighing.
Dean squeezed him a little tighter, "love you, Cas. I'm so happy you're getting to do this. I never expected this."
Castiel kissed him back then said, "I also have steaks being made too." He nuzzled him and grinned, "I asked them to make it how you like it with veggies and potatoes."
He closed his eyes and purred as he felt Dean rub his stubble on the back of his neck. It felt so good, and he felt so safe. He sighed, feeling content for the first time in forever.
Castiel smiled and kissed him back, "you're welcome. I thought it would help a little." He nuzzled him then began using this moment to try out how he should sit at the party. It still felt so odd as he put his head under Dean's chin like he saw in the video.
John snarled, but walked out of the room, head high. Adam had managed to get over to Castiel who had ripped his shirt to try and stop the bleeding. He looked up at Dean and Sam, "he has to go to the hospital, please." He put his arm around the injured beta. This was all his fault.
"Yeahhhh, maybe you should find Dean first though. My scent is gonna be alllll over you," Adam checked the clock, then looked at Cas, "he's not normally aggressive, but if he thinks I've been on you, he's gonna literally rip my throat out."
Castiel jumped some when Dean stood, then mumbled in a quivering voice, "Hello alpha.. I.. I was told to go to you by the taller alpha. He and the beta said that you own me now." He was shivering from how good the scent was now along with his nerves. It was stronger here and he wondered if this could really be Dean. He saw a man with jade eyes, a square jaw, freckles dusted across his nose and cheeks. Castiel noted the strong build, sturdy and toned even under the casual clothes the alpha was wearing. This alpha was very handsome, and he blushed some and looked away as he felt himself starting to get slick, a purely biological reaction to this alpha's scent.
Castiel shook his head. "No. I want to be with you. And we can still make a place out here for us, our own little nest if you will." He responded with a smile and hugged his alpha back.
Castiel moaned loudly in pleasure and purred as he slowly wrapped his legs around his alpha. He was thrilled that this was how their night would end.
Sam looked at him, "I can continue to look into the legalities, but Charlie's a tech wizard. We're trying to help, you've just gotta understand we can only do what the law allows."
Dean had also said he wanted to touch him. Was he going to do that now? Castiel kicked himself for assuming Dean was not like the others. He'd only known him only a few minutes. He could be just the same as every other alpha on the planet. Castiel wanted to look up, but could feel the tenseness in the air still, could scent Dean's anger.
Dean laughed softly, gently tugging Cas forward and guiding him a bit closer, handing him a carrot. The horse took the tidbit from Castiel's hand, jaw moving as he crunched it in an appetizing way.
Castiel came out showered, and clean once again. He walked over to Dean's bed and sat on the very edge. "What is this show?" He asked, as it looked interesting.
Castiel looked at him in confusion,  "you don't? But why? It's not his fault your dad had an affair." He didnt think that he might be crossing a line since Dean had let him talk freely yesterday.
"I think that's a really good idea. I'm sure other omegas would be very interested in what you have to say," Dean shrugged, "especially after what happened."
"It's okay, Cas. If I had to sell it, this is one thing mom would have been okay with," Dean kissed his head, then stripped Cas to the silk gown under his dress. "Get into bed. I'll be right there," Dean told him quietly, going to take his tuxedo off.
Castiel stood in the doorway and looked out at the city, he could hear people out and cars driving by. He didn't want to hurt Dean any more than he was already. "I don't want him to sell the ring and I don't know what else to do to help."
Dean hummed along to an ACDC song as he cleaned off one of his tools from his workshop, then paused as he scented something good. Really good. Moutherwateringly good. Like pie and cider and the sweetest cloves. He sat up turning towards the sitting room of his part of the house, and his eyes connected with big blue ones, an omega standing there looking frightened out of his mind. Dean carefully set the tool he had in his hands aside and stood, palms out to show he wasnt a threat.
Castiel only looked at Dean. His heart was beating out of his chest. His alpha, looked so good dressed up and he was nervous, not wanting to make a mistake.
"Luke, breathe," Gabriel told his brother, ultra calm, not reaching for him. That would just be asking to get bit.
Dean quickly whipped up grilled cheese and ham sandwiches and found Castiel browsing youtube when he set a plate in front of him. He kissed his cheek, smiling, "Thinking of posting videos?
Castiel still shivered but his body slowly relaxed as he slowed down his breathing. Sam smiled gently, "That's it Cas. You're doing great, keep breathing like that. Nice and slow." He watched Castiel and reached in his pocket, pulling out a protein bar. "Here, would you like a little to eat? I have more, and we can get you a drink if you want."
Dean immediately shook his head, frowning. "No, sweetheart. No pup of mine will ever be taken away. Girl or boy," he nuzzled along behind Castiel's ear. "You'll never have another pup taken away again. I promise."
"If we slip up, I'm afraid he might try to hurt you. I wouldn't let that happen, but there would be consequences on me regardless." Dean ran a hand through his hair. "I know its degrading, and I'll hate making you feel like that, but if it's what keeps you safe, I'd rather do that than be sorry."
Dean dusted himself off calmly, then grabbed a handful and dumped flour all over Sam's long hair with a wicked grin. "Ha, fuckin' serves you right for laughing!" he smirked as Sam groaned about having just washed it. He gave Cas a sneaky wink and ruffled flour off his shirt.
The servant came in and cleared his throat, "I'm sorry to bother you, sir. Mr. John Winchester wants to speak to Castiel. Right now."
He then was quiet, not sure if he said to much, or if he would be punished for being clumsy. What if this alpha would change his mind later and want to have sex with him? He had no home to run to, and they would find him. He was nothing but property.
"Hello, Felix." Sam spoke calmly, crossing his arms. "Is there a specific reason you're here to bug us now?"
Sam smiled at his brother and said, "you're a lucky alpha, Dean. Look at him. He loves you so much."
Dean grinned at that, looking after him affectionately. His omega always said just the right thing without even knowing he had.
Dean chuckled, not saying anything but silently thanking Anna for knowing exactly what Castiel needed right now. He put his arm around his mate and kissed his temple.
Dean smiled, continuing to nuzzle along his temple. "It'll only get better from here," Dean whispered, arm winding around Castiel's middle and holding him in a tight embrace.
Dean stared at him for a second, shocked. "I thought you felt like last night was just sex. You seemed to rapidly become close to Adam, where with me you didn't even come find me until you wanted lunch and you smelled like him all over. I thought he'd..." Dean looked away, pausing,  "I'm falling fast for you, Cas. I think we were meant to be. It hurt when you came to me hours later smelling like someone else. I reacted badly and I'm sorry." He kneeled by the couch and cupped his cheeks, wiping thumbs over Castiel's cheeks. "Please don't cry."
Dean hadn't thought of that, and thinking about Castiel's wonderful scent changing made him frown. If it made Cas happy, though, he'd have to be fine with it.
Dean hummed tunelessly, ruffling his hair and watching the show, already feeling sleepy from lack of endorphins.
Adam was quiet as Sam got into the car and turned on the engine. As Sam drove silently, Adam didn't quite know what to say, "thanks. You could easily have let him kill me."
They stepped into the kitchen and Castiel looked around at all the omegas in there making dinner. He watched them closely, curious to see what they were doing and how. The head chef smiled as she approached. "You must be new here. I know all the omegas in the mansion. Would you like to help cook?" Castiel smiled and nodded and was immediately given the job of cutting some vegetables.
"Of course. We can do more planning. Oh, do you have a favorite flower?" she asked as Castiel looked at him a little worried.
Castiel nodded and smiled at Dean. "Yes, and tonight maybe we can cover it in our scents?" he asked, trying to hint at him wanting his mate tonight in their new bed.
"Of course, Cas. Anytime you want to, we'll drive over and see him," Dean ran fingers through Castiel's messy hair, looking at the halfway done nest, "that's gonna be a huge comfy one, isnt it?"
"Hes suffered so much. I just want to give him everything he needs, everything he wants," Dean told her softly, "he deserves the world."
Sam sighed and nodded, that was true. But, maybe this would start something for the better? When the bathroom door opened and Castiel came out in his silk underdress he smiled, "good morning, Sam." He then saw the news and his heart sank, "is everyone mad at me?"
As he said that Castiel took a breath and exposed his neck just like he practiced with Adam and Charlie. They all watched and waited with held breaths for Dean to mate mark Castiel.
Castiel looked at him, he wasnt exactly sure what to do, but he gently put his arms around Dean. "It's okay alpha. You kept us safe. I'm right here," he leaned up and kissed his cheek lightly. "Can you get my scent?" he asked softly as he bared his neck to his alpha, hoping it would calm Dean down to smell him safe and well.
Castiel smiled and nodded before going to look at the cakes and other bakery items. There was so much to chose from, but he finally decided on a marble cake, with chocolate frosting. He reached out for it, and as his hands touched it so did someone else's. He looked up saying, "Oh I'm sor..." He stopped mid sentence and his eyes widened. It couldn't be him! Why would he be here?! "G-Gabriel?" he gasped out, not believing that his brother was here, a brother he had not seen in 5 years.
John rubbed his aching temple, sighing, "he's only been here two days, Felix. I promised Dean I would give him until the dinner. Now off with you before my headache gets worse."
Luke heard Gabriel but it was like through a fog, and he kept pacing. He felt someone touched his arm and whirled, ready to attack, but stopped when he saw omega gold eyes. Castiel had slowly moved away from Dean and gone over to his brother. His eyes shimmered gold as he spoke, "it's okay, Luke. It's okay now. I'm safe, you and the others saved me."
Castiel was quiet a moment before he started to cry happily. He would get to see Jack! He held tight to his mate and nuzzled him, "you'll get to meet him Dean! You'll love him like our own. I know it!"
"I dont know, Cas. I've never been bitten that hard. I heard the more compatible the alpha and omega are the less it hurts," Dean replied, soothingly stroking Castiel's arms, "besides that, you'd need to plan the ceremony. When you're ready, we'll start that too."
Castiel sighed and nodded, "okay." He really didn't want a revealing dress but if he didn't have any real choice he would just pick one to get it over with.
"My father has no say on what happens to you now. Your body is your own," Dean told him softly, tilting his chin up to look into his eyes, "you're never going back there."
"Okay. It can wait for now, alpha. I'm still learning how to text on Charlie's phone," he replied as he looked out the window.
Dean groaned, aiming there as he sped his hips up. He started fucking into him, holding himself up on shaking arms so Cas wouldn't have to hold both their weight, and felt his knot start to grow.
Castiel did like exploring his alpha's office. He even found a book about bees and smiled as he took it off the shelf to read what he could.
Dean clenched his jaw, low growl echoing in his chest. "I'll walk you to his office. Call for me if you're in danger, and I will come." He looked at the servant, "I'll take it from here. You can go."
Dean slowly deepened the kiss until it was open mouthed and his tongue was tracing along Castiel's soft lower lip. He could scent Castiel's arousal, making his own hormones flare, and he pulled back panting before went too far, the omega's purr soothing in his ears. He licked his lips, chasing the taste of him, eyes half alpha red as he struggled to gain composure.
Castiel smiled and nodded as he hugged him. "I missed you too Gabriel... see you soon." He let go and watched his brother walk away. His brother remembered him and had thought he had been dead. How could his parents have lied to his brothers and sister so long? He looked to Charlie, "Thank you for letting me come. If I hadn't, I never would have found Gabriel." He  hugged her tightly.
Well, he supposed it was no longer all he had as he followed Dean into a large bedroom and saw some bags of new, designer clothes. He stood there a moment before saying, "Those...are for me, alpha Dean?" He didn't know what to think.
He nuzzled at Dean's neck, he just needed the alpha's scent to feel a bit better. John's threat rang in his ears, and thought of going back to that breeding house make Cas feel physically ill. He didn't want to think of what they would do to him, a failure sold to such a successful family.
Castiel cried out, the sensations completely different now but just as pleasurable, "Alpha! Oh, god yes!" He moaned loudly as he dug his nails into his alpha's shoulders.
Castiel was wondering the same thing. He nuzzled him and said, "Alpha?" Charlie stopped the video looking at Dean, not sure what was going on.
Dean's green eyes met his blue and the alpha gently cupped his jaw, thumb resting under Castiel's bottom lip. "May I kiss you?" Dean asked softly, kindly. If Castiel said no, he would pull away, but he was so close and smelled so good and Dean just wanted to drink him in.
Castiel nodded and smiled, "Thank you Charlie." He looked through the bag of clothes that would fit him and pulled out some pants and a nice red shirt. As he was going to the bathroom to change he turned, "Dean, I know we don't have to sell it any more, but can we still sell the dress?"
Castiel nodded and said, "okay. What's her name? Will you even have time to do it with the work you have to do?" He went back to gently running his fingers over Dean's chest.
Dean nuzzled back, sighing, "of course she wouldn't be happy. But she wouldnt want us fighting either." He shook his head. "We'll talk about this with Sam later. We're supposed to be here for you," he kissed Castiel's cheek.
Castiel snuggled close to him, hating himself for always being so afraid. He couldn't even remember what he was like before the breeding house. What did he like anymore? What was he like? Who was he? He felt nothing but ashamed as to what he'd become.
Dean moved between Castiel's legs and pushed his thighs apart gently, lining up and sliding in slowly so he wouldnt hurt the omega.
The staff was quiet as they cleaned up, glancing at Dean, not sure how their second in command boss would take what Castiel just said before leaving the room.
"Of course, Cas. It's really comfortable, isnt it?" Dean smiled, running fingers through Castiel's hair. He was slowly relaxing from all the harsh activity, Castiel's cheerful and calm attitude helping a lot.
"Why couldn't you have any now? Can't he protect them? I know you two are all over the news," Michael crossed his arms, watching as Dean placed burgers on the sizzling grill.
Castiel purred contently and held onto him, happy that Dean was relaxing. He loved his alpha, and hoped that nothing went wrong when they went to the barbecue.
"Yeah. You're Dean's. Knowing Dean's posessive personality, you're probably only Dean's, though as the head alpha of the house my father could overrule him." Sam paused, "you're mostly here because father insisted Dean get an omega to accompany him to events and keep company in the house." Sam finally stopped in front of a door, "this is Dean's wing. Mine is across the hall and dad's is way on the other side of the mansion so if you wanna avoid him I suggest not going that way." Sam pointed the opposite direction.
"Yeah. I'll text you the name and address since you're the research wizard. Better not let dad know." Dean responded just as quietly, sitting on a stool and watching Cas start to smile as the other omegas joked with and accepted him into their group immediately. It was nice to see Castiel with people that accepted him.
Charlie shook her head, "unless the alpha dies, Cas might never get him back." She tensed at a whimper in the hall. She turned and saw Castiel had slipped out of bed to go to the bathroom, hearing the last part about Jack. It hurt, he felt his heart break a little. "Cas... I'm so sorry," Charlie said gently.
"I think you and Charlie are magicians. Nothing could be more perfect," Dean replied softly, pulling Castiel into his arms. "Even the weather is perfect, how did you do that?" he teased.
Castiel looked at him and nervously cleared his throat, "just talking with Adam." He looked down at Adam's hand and gently moved it off his knee, standing up, "I should go back to Dean's room." He slowly started towards the door and tried to get by Felix without touching him.
When Dean pulled away, he opened his eyes, blue eyes gone shining omega gold. Castiel loved Dean's scent. It felt so good, and safe, somehow. Maybe sleeping next to Dean wouldn't be so bad.
Cas smiled as Gabriel hurried over to him, and when he was close enough he hugged his brother. After a moment he pulled back, "Gabriel, this is Dean. The alpha I told you about at the store."
Castiel sighed, "Dean was doing most of the work anyways, so Dean should be in charge of the family business."
Castiel quietly started to eat his burger. Did people really think caffeine would make it hard for him to get pregnant? He had no trouble at the breeding house getting pregnant, but then again, he ate whatever he was given.  He took a deep breath as he ate his burger and stared at the one for Adam.
Castiel smiled as he kept gently petting the horses muzzle. "He's so sweet. Is he yours?" He asked softly his blue eyes focused on the beautiful creature in front of him.
Castiel leaned into Dean and began eating breakfast as Charlie showed Castiel how to take a birth control pill before having him take one himself. "Now these ones are for when you are in heat. Take one each day while your mind is still clear. Okay?" Charlie pointed them out and Castiel nodded,
He purred low and rough as he got Dean's pajamas pulled down and saw his cock. He had seen many alphas before, but none were even close to Dean's size or length. He moved to get his own slick covered pants off, tossing them aside. Dean echoed the purr with a rumbling growl. He tugged Castiel back onto his lap, groaning as warm slick smeared over his thighs. "Cas, please," Dean whispered, letting his omega control the movements.
Dean frowned, "that's barbaric!" He looked at Sam, both of them wearing shocked expressions, and turned back to Castiel. "Cas, we're not going to hurt you. I know that must seem really hard to believe right now, but we'll show you. Neither of us is going to touch you without consent. You deserve respect, okay?"
Dean smiled, pressing a kiss to the side of Castiel's head and sitting at his desk, flipping open a folder and booting up his expensive looking computer. He began to type at a rapid pace, calculating and recording transactions with the business and any notes, complaints or progress. He looked up at Cas exploring his office occasionally and smiled before turning back to his computer.
Dean sighed a little in relief, kissing Castiel's head. "I have to admit I would have been thrown off if Castiel's scent changed. I love him the way he is."
Gabriel felt sick, "600,000. They said they got that money from some lotto they bet on, bastards. All this time they knew where you were and never told us."
Castiel smiled and said, "I like that. It sounds really fun. Charlie, can you see if Gabriel would like to do that?"
Castiel looked at him, "I can make it better?" He smiled and as he went to get cream and sugar Charlie sighed, "He's so sweet, but he doesn't really seem to know to much about the world. All of us should really teach him."
Sam shook his head, "why, is it cute? Don't omegas only nest when they're pregnant?" He arched an eyebrow, "you think Cas could already be pupped?"
Castiel thought and smiled back, "well, I always thought a beach would be nice, a beach with white sand and bright blue water." He felt calm wash over him as he thought of that image. He could hear the sound of the waves, seagulls crying out over head. He sighed wistfully.
Dean wound his arm around Castiel and rested his hand on Castiel's thigh. "That was perfect. Good job," he whispered softly, giving him an affectionate nuzzle, rubbing his scent on him. Their table slowly filled as alphas sat down, Dean speaking about business to some of them, greeting all. It was obvious he'd done this so often he knew everyone by name and face. They all completely ignored Castiel, which was protocol. If Dean wanted to show him off he'd bring up the omega himself.
"Of course, Cas. If you want me to meet them I'd be more than happy to," Dean agreed immediately, loving the way Cas seemed to light up when he mentioned his siblings.
Michael looked horrified, coming to look at Cas. "Thank God you're still here and safe," he looked up at Dean, "we saw what you did on tv. Thank you. We all know what would have happened if an alpha didn't step in."
Castiel tensed and whimpered before pulling away. "They never told you?" he asked, not wanting to be touched right then. Charlie.. where was Charlie? He started looking around for the red hair, his heart racing, "our parents sold me to a breeding house. I had been there for five years."
Dean curled around his future mate, burying his face in Castiel's neck, taking slow deep breaths and letting his scent lull him to sleep
Castiel was watching and smiled proudly at the tv. His mate was so wonderful, and he could not wait to marry this alpha. The press asked about Castiel then, asking if he was doing alright and if there was anything happening between Dean and Castiel.
Castiel sighed, he felt safe right there in the little nest he made, snuggling in, "Dean, could we sleep in this nest tonight?"
Dean held him tighter, keeping his chin over his shoulder so Cas couldn't see the expression on his face, "yeah, Cas. I'm sure I'll love him."
Cas came over to dean, wrapping arms around his neck and snuggling close, "thank you, Dean. Its going to be beautiful."
"Sure, Cas! I can get that before we get to my place anyways, won't take but a minute," Charlie replied happily.
Castiel smiled a little at Dean's praise. He glanced to the other omegas and saw they all seemed fine with this, like it was no big deal. He tried not to look at the alphas, as he knew he shouldn't.
"He's getting ready to be fitted right now," Dean stressed the word he, Castiel was not an it, "is there something specific you needed? If you were going to ask, yes we've been intimate. I also plan to mate mark him very soon."
When Dean grabbed his wrists, Cas got scared, an unhappy alpha meant pain, and it spoke poorly of his obedience to be punished so quickly. Then he heard what Dean said, and noticed how gentle he was being.
"We have a big room across the way and then a few smaller ones on the opposite side of the hall," Dean pointed in that direction.
Castiel nodded, "much better than Sam. His scent is okay, but I like yours better." His eyes remained closed, enjoying the relaxation he hadn't felt in far memory.
Dean walked with him hand in hand, just getting exercise, "it's nice to live in a suburb like this, isnt it?"
John nodded, "I had a feeling with how he reacted at that dinner. But, let him know, Jack knows next to nothing about him." Once the papers were all sighed he had copies made and given to Sam and Dean, placing the original in his brief case, "good luck boys. I hope to see you soon."
Castiel looked up at him and smiled, "it should be near ours, in case he gets scared at night." He purred softly, he loved when Dean touched him like this.
"I figured it would come to this eventually. I'm assuming you'll be retiring privately to the villa to escape media coverage?" Dean asked, taking the thick pad of papers and standing next to Sam so they could both see.
Sam smiled, "any time. Now that you're feeling better, I'm going back to the kitchen. Would you like to come or stay here with Dean?"
Castiel smiled, "maybe a smaller one for now." He then moved to hug him again, purring loudly. Even though his heat was two days away his body was already preparing for it.  By that night he knew his scent would be a bit sweeter, more desirable to Dean.
When Sam came out of the bathroom, he got in the other small bed and looked at Castiel, "Hey Cas, don't worry okay? We'll figure everything out. You're safe with us." Castiel just nodded but didn't say anything and Sam felt guilty. This was the second time he could have helped Cas, but didn't. He stayed back, being the passive son.
Dean smiled happily, pulling Cas into his arms, "I'm so glad to have met you all. I look forward to getting to know you all even better in the future."
Castiel whined high pitched and anxious, "Not alone, please. Only bad things happen when I'm alone. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please don't leave me alone." He was curled in a ball protecting himself and flinched when Sam touched his shoulder.
Dean came into the room a couple of hours later and gave a frustrated, exhausted groan. "Cas?" he wandered into the bedroom and found him watching tv, glancing at the show with a smile. "Do you like dogs?" he began to grab clothes to dress before the tailor got there.
Dean stood quickly, eyes narrowed. "Dad, I haven't even had the chance to touch him yet. Permission to be the one who does touch him would be ideal."
"Probably, but I never was the most proper of people." Dean headed back to his section of the mansion, and laughed as he looked at himself in the mirror, covered in white powder and smiling. "I need a shower. I'll be back, okay? Shouldn't take long. Will you be alright by yourself?”
Dean gripped his thighs with his hands, holding him in place as he sucked, dragging his tongue up the underside of Castiel's length. "Taste so good, cas," he pulled off to say, then leaned to lap at his leaking tip.
Charlie squeezed him, chuckling. "Just explain quickly as possible to Dean before he amps up to ten smelling someone on you," she teased, smiling. "I'm happy you found him, Cas. Let's grab eggs and milk and were done here."
"I'd like something not too tight, and in a deep green color," he replied, glancing over at Dean with a smile. Dean was browsing over a tablet and swiping, and Castiel looked at him curiously. "Dean, are you alright?" Cas held very still as the tailor measured his legs.
John looked back to Dean. "Your mate? He has no mark, boy, and as for Adam, I would think you'd actually want to see him dead, touching Castiel as if he has the right," John spit on the ground.
Dean nuzzled him back, rubbing his scent all over Castiel's cheeks and neck, nipping at the corner of his jaw and sucking a mark softly to his throat. This would broadcast to all other alphas that this omega was taken.
Sam looked up from the laptop he'd been borrowing from Charlie and smiled kindly, "yeah, what's up, Cas?" He turned to face him.
Castiel moaned a bit louder, his body starting to make some slick. A soft knock at the door stopped the kiss, "Sirs, when you are able, Dean has a phone call from the press asking about the business."
Dean rumbled a happy growl, nuzzling Castiel's cheek, "all mine." He spread Castiel's legs, pressing up against him and pushing home.
John nodded, "Good. I will deal with Adam. Now, on to the dinner." He spent an hour talking with Dean about what needed to be done, who would be seated where, the cuisine,  and all that. Dean nodded along impatiently, because he honestly did not care about any of this fancy bullshit.
Sam surprised him by just laughing and shrugging, "Dean says I'm the reason we cant have nice things. I'm always tripping over or breaking things. Dont worry about it." He paused, "speaking of Dean, we better go see him. Dad bought you for him, so... follow me." Sam turned and went to go up a long winding staircase, expensive carpet soft and plush under their feet.
Castiel smiled, "no. A small bruise, but I'm okay. Thank you." He then hugged him and Gabriel smiled.
John nodded and said, "Thank you. If you allow it, I would like to come to the mating ceremony when you have it. I will understand if you do not wish for me to be there." He shook his hand and then Sam's. His boys were ready, even if he did not want to retire but perhaps it was time. "Oh, I did add something for Castiel in the contract he may like."
The preacher smiled and looked to Castiel, "and do you, Castiel, take this alpha, Dean, to be your mate? To have and hold, in sickness and in health. For all the rest of your days?"
A beat, in which it immediately becomes clear that neither of the Winchesters wants to answer that question.
It is not how I would do things. Unfortunately, however, it is not my place to question God’s will. He is very big on choices, this new God of yours. Even in Heaven, people can choose to leave and be reincarnated back on Earth. And the administrative work that has created--
Sam. You were just talking to a whole bunch of hunters in here. Telling them about how we need to work together and so on. So don’t you hesitate to call for backup, you hear me? Besides, the last thing the Association needs is its fearless leader going down a mere day after its first official meeting.
TIGHT ON DEAN, tracking him around the kitchen. He drags a pot over to the sink and fills it with water.
Ya know, I think the normal folks are gonna be more of a problem than the ex-demons with a vendetta. Religious types out my way are verging on mass human sacrifice.
--but they’re more than that, and so are you. Family isn’t about sacrificing yourself for each other.
Well, Amara and I-- we’re God, now. And the angels... those few still in Heaven were put to work in soul administration instead.
What you said about Billie, about how maybe she couldn’t touch us because I was here. When I was in the silo... I touched a weed by accident, and it... shriveled up. It
Michael appears beside Dean. He’s quite annoyed-- although on Michael, this is a barely noticeable change in countenance.
Dean tips over the POT he’s cooking with-- water goes FLYING EVERYWHERE. Jack drops his KNIFE. Only Michael seems relatively unfazed.
CLOSE ON JACK. Terrified. Not knowing what he might be becoming. Not knowing what he might be capable of doing... or who he might hurt in the process.
He leans down and uses his blade edge to delicately encourage Dean’s neck up. It’s an almost sensual act.
--but now it seems like Heaven is the only post-death realm left standing. And with all these dead angels and demons popping up, most people are starting to believe in the existence of the supernatural. We’ve got CNN doing lead stories on angels, and people coming out of the woodwork to talk to the New York Times about their encounters with wendigos. Since people are asking more and more questions, we think it’s-- time to be more open about what it is we do.
Suddenly, A HUGE BLACK TEAR opens in the study in front of them-- the walls of the Bunker SHAKE-- they’ve torn a hole in reality that should not be opened.
Sam is taken aback by that. Rowena also looks a little surprised, but Jack and Dean seem to have worked out this revelation already.
CLOSE ON A RECORD NEEDLE, and Sam’s hand-- he is putting a record on an old, expensive-looking record player.
’Cos I would have thought you’d be happier. Getting him back from the dead twice-- hell, what has it been now? Ten, twelve times?
Sam, Jack and Rowena are sitting around eating breakfast – EGGS, BACON, SAUSAGES, THE WORKS, piled high on the war room table.
WIDE SHOT of a green, sparsely forested area. It’s scenic, peaceful... and totally isolated. Nobody around for miles.
Sam SNATCHES it out of Jack’s lap, and slams the receive call button immediately. He holds it up to his ear.
METATRON is being CHOKED BY JANE-- but then, the younger Castiel STABS HER IN THE NECK. Jane groans as the angel blade goes through her.
It’s true! And honestly, I’m grateful. This place is what’s gonna help draw hunters to the Association HQ.
The Empty’s space is all but Swiss cheese, beams of light streaming through the darkness and more appearing every second. Michael circles The Empty, and they scuffle desperately. Michael wields an ARCHANGEL BLADE while The Empty works with its BLACK, OOZING KNIFE.
Wow, we never showed you--? Huh. Short, angry, talkative guy. Thinks he’s smarter than he is. Chuck, with less hair.
What is this but a whole lot of ‘later’? Which primordial entity did you piss off to get such a terrible, boring deal?
Mom? Mommy, please stay with me, okay? Mom? Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Mom, I’m sorry.
Behind her come the WAYWARDS, carrying bags of supplies. They’re joking around with each other, but stop abruptly behind Donna. The chatter ceases.
One was John Argent, strange old fellow who disappeared years ago. He was sent to a mental facility for spouting some stuff about angels and the apocalypse.
Dean stares at Chuck for a heartbeat-- and then in an instant, he’s turned away and is SPRINTING TOWARDS THE LAKE. But he doesn’t get far before--
Two hunters are FIGHTING a monster-- ALICIA BANES stabs it through the chest with a wooden spear before it can maul her brother, MAX BANES.
Honestly, dear, I think you just forgot I existed. Which I’m grateful for, by the way. But as for the power, well--
Sam squints at the sign, which is barely legible since so many of the lights are out. Supposedly ‘Rothschild Motel’, but now reads something like ‘Rot child el’.
CLOSE ON DEAN’S PHONE, still in Sam’s hand. The group photo of the Roadhouse Gang filling his screen.
He didn’t answer. I think he wants to watch. Son of a bitch has the popcorn out. He’s watchin’ us right now, Sam, and he’ll
Heaven’s ‘Beautiful Room’, from 4.22 LUCIFER RISING. Dean and Castiel once again mirroring their body language from a previous time. The ANGELIC SCREECH is growing louder--
Michael isn’t fazed by Dean’s reaction at all. The two of them stare at each other for a long moment. Dean’s scans Michael’s eyes for understanding. Then he scoffs.
Whoa, hey, hang on. What, you’re going to delete file, start new game? How is that different to Chuck?
Ah, of course. My apologies. I had forgotten the Winchester tendency to endure pain as a point of pride.
At the bar, CASTIEL is arranging bottles up on a shelf. He turns when he hears the Winchester brothers come in.
MID SHOT OF THE THREE-- Dean and Castiel still holding their phones up to their ears. Staring at each other.
, and also refers to the two main settings of the episode... and Dean and Castiel. Meant to parallel the title of 4.10 ‘Heaven and Hell’ (the one where Anna chooses to become an angel again.) And finally, adjacent to the lyrics of ‘Heaven is a place on Earth’, of course. I know I put too many callbacks and photographs in this one, but honestly, I’m a sucker for sentimentality (if you couldn’t tell!). I console myself with the fact that Becky wrote this episode, so saccharine fanservice is fair game. The Becky speeches were a continued conversation from Swan Song and Meta Fiction, but also inspired by Jack Rackham’s speech in Black Sails’ excellent finale.
What? We’ll work it out. ’Sides, what’s wrong with a little mix-and-match? Bit of diversity gives the place more character.
Oh, but we’re just getting started. I could loop you torturing people in the Pit, or-- oh, this one’s good. What about watching me consume your angel, over and over and o--
Jack needs to believe in himself, and his purpose. And containing the power is only half the issue-- controlling it is something else entirely.
He pulls a phone out of his pocket, taps twice and then puts it to his ear. We hear the phone ring, as Dean--
On Claire and Alex. Claire mutters to Alex, as Sam’s voice continues indistinctly in the background--
And I never wanted to feel like this, because you’re always walkin’ out on us for some reason. Heaven always needs fixing. Even now.
Amara turns away from the smoking remains of Chuck’s body. She walks towards Dean and Sam, still on the ground. Their skin BURNED from the impact of Chuck’s dying light.
Oh yeah? Who, huh? The demons that don’t have powers anymore? Queen of Hell, maybe? If Rowena’s back, we sure haven’t heard from her. Maybe she’s gone dark side again.
We want to rebuild Heaven. Into somewhere Sam and Dean-- and the people they love-- can truly be at peace.
ON DEAN, groaning. He sits up, clutching the edge of the shoulder he landed on-- injured there, but otherwise okay.
--walks through the Bunker, through the corridors-- the phone keeps ringing... Dean starts running... we hear another phone ring somewhere else--
EXTREME WIDE SHOT. We watch as the small figure of Dean makes his way through the fields. The night grows darker, and darker.
A bit awkwardly, they descend down the stairs one after the other. Absolutely everyone is aware there’s something not being talked about. There’s an extremely pregnant SILENCE.
I’m not God anymore, though. And sometimes, I wake up and I feel like I don’t deserve this. There are so many things I didn’t fix.
Sam frowns, and sits up. He looks at Rowena. Suddenly a whole lot of thoughts he’s been having at the back of his mind are spilling over.
Sam draws a barstool out for himself, and Castiel copies the action. Once Sam is sitting down, he takes a moment to fully appreciate the bar.
