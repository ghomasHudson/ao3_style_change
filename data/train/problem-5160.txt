“See if you can try to bear down a little, Steve. And if you don’t mind, try and scoot down the table a little closer towards me, maybe get up on your elbows and angle your hips a bit more.”
He felt exhausted down to his very bones, his thoughts cloudy and disjointed, but he was grateful for it, too tired to concentrate on anything, especially the person sitting across from him at the table.
he’s off-limits, and at the rate he’s going, Dr. Stark is going to start taking vacation days every time Steve comes in.
He feels like every muscle is clenched tight, as if he can keep the orgasm back by will alone, and he’s getting a cramp in his left foot from how curled up his toes are, but he can’t, he can’t, he—
The design of the toy was relatively simple. It was a nice thickness and length, substantial but well short of pornstar dimensions; it had a flat, flared base, so Steve could sit down if he wanted without any danger of it slipping inside and getting stuck; and it was light enough that Steve could wear it standing all day, if necessary, but not so light that the weight wouldn’t gradually start stretching Steve open around the rounded bulb near the bottom if he didn’t clench up occasionally. In general, it should’ve been pretty comfortable for Steve to wear.
I might write more though, depending on response.  >_>  *cough, cough*  If I do continue, the warnings and rating will definitely go up, so.
In the end, Steve had still chosen to come back. Late, yes, and without contacting Tony to even let him know he was safe, but it hadn’t been the absolute rejection that Tony had first imagined, and whatever punishment Tony might have thought Steve deserved, Steve had already suffered through it, ten times over.
“Right, so please help yourself to anything in the kitchen, and the television remotes are on the coffee table, and I’m just going to be a couple of minutes, but if you need anything, feel free to knock.” He sends Tony one last bright smile and doesn’t quite slam his bedroom door, but it’s a near thing.
Steve couldn’t say anything for a moment, Tony’s words a punch to the gut, and while he could understand in one part of his mind where Tony was coming from, the truth was that it wasn’t what he wanted at all.
Tony had put in safeguards to keep from hurting him unintentionally. It was a thoughtful act, but there was a part of Steve that couldn’t help but think that it put a lot of power into his hands; he could always call out a stop and then keep attacking anyway. Who knew how long it’d take before Tony could use his weapons again, five seconds, ten seconds, a minute? Time enough to take Tony down.
He didn’t know why the realization shook him so much, but it did. He’d never questioned why Stark gave him free reign of the Tower, including his lab that housed important company secrets; why Tony put himself in the position of being taken down during their daily matches and never complained about the inevitable bruising or suggested that Steve had done more damage than necessary. He’d always known that he could be trusted, and he’d taken it for granted that Tony would know it too.
, Steve thought, his name a mantra as he turned into Tony’s hand, trying to offer what comfort he could, his breath coming out in hitching gasps against Tony’s skin. He could barely make sense of Tony’s words, too lost in his own thoughts, in the latest in his series of betrayals.
to get undressed in order to accomplish your objective, and I decided to do the same in the spirit of camaraderie and because I like being naked.  It’s fun, and I am not ashamed.”
Of course, Tony was going to give in now, and Steve wasn’t half as desperate as he could be, although he probably felt like he’d never wanted anything quite so much. But then, no one had ever teased Steve like this before, so he didn’t understand what Tony
know what a computer was. Vaguely. Nick had just begun allowing him to use one under the watchful eye of a SHIELD-issued Dom, and while he thought of them as more a glorified typewriter/calculator, he’d definitely seen the appeal of the Internet.
the fact that he had somehow developed telepathy overnight.  It was just that until he could figure out what the hell was going on, it seemed important to keep the information on more of the need-to-know basis.  It wasn’t
He thumbed the corner of his mouth, imagining Tony watching as he dipped his fingers between Steve’s lips, a tease before the real thing.
with Tony, had from the very beginning.  They were so good together, and he’d wanted that commitment, wanted to be able to say he was going home to Tony, to
Steve didn’t lift his head, unsure if he had permission yet and knowing he wouldn’t be able to control his expression anyway. Orgasm was the last thing on his mind, no matter how eager his body. He hated the fact that Hill had called, had set back whatever progress he’d made over the course of the day with Tony. Why was Hill calling? What was—?
Of course, that was when Tony said, “Spread your legs a little wider for me, Steve,” and all hope that this wouldn’t be half as embarrassing as he thought it was going to be flew right out the—thankfully closed—window.
Three hours later though, they’d gone through six stores without purchasing even a measly decorative item, and Steve’s patience was reaching its limit.
“I know it can’t be comfortable for you, but we’re going to figure out what’s causing the excessive slicking, and then you won’t have to deal with it anymore.”
“Alright, I’m heading this way to clean up,” Tony said at the door, pointing in the opposite direction. “How do you feel about Indian for dinner?”
It was a dark and stormy night.  Or at least it would be, once the storm arrived.  Steve had already gathered candles and a flashlight in preparation for any potential power outages.  He loved thunderstorms, had ever since he was a kid, and he’d exchange a few hours without power to be able to enjoy a thunderstorm each and every time.
The thought is so strange and disorienting that he barely responds when Tony kisses him and doesn’t move when Tony pulls out other than to let his legs fall to the bed, splaying out, and Steve blinks up at the ceiling, still breathing hard, his body buzzing.
“Yes. You will,” Tony said, and there was a note in his voice made Steve fall silent as Tony went to grab something from the bar counter and then walked past him to the elevator. Tony made no mention of Steve’s bags on the floor or in his hand, and he didn’t touch him before leaving, barely glanced at him on the way out.
. But Tony continued to focus on his work instead, and Steve could feel his eyes starting to burn as Tony ignored him and ignored him.
Pet play. Steve bowed his head and nodded, concentrating on making sure his fingers didn’t tremble and betray him. When he’d been growing up, there’d been a man who’d had a collar that had looked more like something a dog would wear than a person, and a few of the other kids had whispered and laughed about it. Steve hadn’t really understood their jokes until he joined the army and heard rumors about one general and his aide, but it wasn’t until after he’d been pulled from the ice that he’d ever actually seen anyone doing it.
, he thinks, even though he never refers to Dr. Stark by his first name, would never. It’s too personal, a line he can’t cross—although who knows why he’s picked this boundary, when he’s demolished all the rest.
In the past, that would’ve been enough to almost if not actually make him come, but not this time, not when Tony’s cock is
There’s a fine tremble in Steve’s hands as he unbuttons, but it’s silly. There’s no reason for him to be nervous. He’s been shirtless in public before. This is no different.
Not that Tony would ever get to do more than appreciate how aesthetically pleasing he was, even if Steve had agreed to pretty much any kind of sex Tony had wanted—his eyes staring flatly at the wall as Nick had listed option after option and Steve had replied with a monotone “yes” time and time again until he’d sounded like a bad porn track.  Tony really wasn’t a big aficionado of duty-driven sex, however, no matter how pretty he thought Steve would look spread-eagled on his bed, eyelashes wet and clumped together from sexual frustration, a cock ring keeping him ready for however Tony wanted to use him.
“Then let’s go.” Tony hesitates before saying, “I’m sorry about your pants,” before deliberately tilting his bottle of water over so it spills across Steve’s lap.
“Oh great,” he muttered, knowing there was no way he was going to avoid him. Not that he’d been planning to avoid him, of course. But it would’ve been nice to have the option.
Steve hadn’t had the faintest clue what he meant, but it hadn’t been important. He hadn’t said anything to contradict Stark, but he
“Just once,” Steve said, but he found himself wondering. It’d been a long time since he’d felt anything like the way he felt for Tony, and he honestly didn’t know how that would affect him. During his recent mission, he’d masturbated more frequently than normal, but that might’ve been attributable to anticipation rather than necessity. If Tony planned on teasing him, however, until he was allowed his one orgasm—assuming Tony gave that to him instead of milking—
Steve tried to nod, tried to acknowledge Tony’s request, but he didn’t know if he succeeded, orgasm turning everything hazy and white.
He had honestly never thought of that solution before—if it could be called a solution. For him, it’d always been A led to B, and then he’d go do whatever it was he needed to do; but Tony was talking about skipping A altogether, about
It’d been a tossup between going this route and finishing up the fucking machine. The problem with the machine, however, was that it wasn’t exactly personal. To really get the most bang for your buck, a person had to be strapped in for
, Steve?” Tony asked, one hand cutting through the air in frustration, and Steve’s mouth felt glued shut. The way Tony said it made Steve remember the last time he’d sounded like that, back in February when Steve had asked Tony to try again. Steve couldn’t help but notice how similar the two occasions were, and he hadn’t thought he could feel any guiltier, but he did. He kept screwing everything up, even when he didn’t mean to, and Tony was always the one who suffered for his mistakes.
It wasn’t the conclusion Tony had reached, though. Tony had decided Steve had meant something entirely different, and Steve had had to watch as what looked like a combination of horror and despair had started to creep across Tony’s face.
“I shouldn’t have been so careless, I guess. It’s too bad, because you’re a lot like him, in your own way,” Tony says regretfully, and then there’s the anger, a raging fire that does nothing to warm the frigid wasteland of his heart.
Steve just didn’t get it. Pepper had been right: Steve still needed him. His first Dom. He needed someone that he could reasonably trust, and after enough time and distance, he’d decided his best bet was Tony. That was all this was. Steve had found a shiny new bicycle and decided to go around for a while with the training wheels on. Once he was comfortable, those training wheels would come right off, and then Steve would leave again.
He also hadn’t known that he could develop an erection when he was in this much pain, but the man is
demanded one as soon as he’d signed the contract, especially considering how prickly he’d been the first day. Tony mentally went over the terms, and yeah, it’d been part of their contract, so he was surprised Steve hadn’t wanted to use his safeword in any and all circumstances he thought he could get away with it—
“Kiss me,” Bruce said, eyes heavy-lidded and inviting, as if he weren’t ordering Clark around in a low, no-nonsense voice that demanded immediate action.
While Pepper replied with, “I’m not crazy. Will you just listen to me for a second?” and once, “You have an exhibitionist streak a mile wide, don’t you?”
“I spent some time with Peggy,” he said, remembering how her eyes had sparkled from the Christmas lights hung up in her room as they’d listened to music. “Her relatives picked her up for Christmas, though.”
He pulled both shoes and socks off, neatly placing the shoes side-by-side with the socks inside, and then he took a fortifying breath. There was just one more thing he needed to take off Tony.
“Anywhere. Well, within reason. I got a message saying SHIELD wants you to stop by in the morning for a checkup,” Stark said, rolling his eyes. “But otherwise, the sky’s the limit. Kind of. How do you feel about flying?”
“You know what? You’re not my Sub anymore,” he said, an echo of what Steve had once said to him, “so you don’t get to ask that question.”
“Mr. Stark,” he said, because he could be the bigger man and acknowledge Tony’s arrival and assistance, even if the words felt clumsy on his tongue. It’d taken him a long time to start calling Tony by his first name, but now that the transition had happened, it was much harder going back.
“Well, you could always try sleeping on the bed for a change,” he said, shaking his head.  “Shocking, I know, but most people seem to like it.”
that Steve had picked up along the way, interesting but ultimately unimportant, and what did it matter if they were in New York, or in DC, or if they were gone altogether?
ETA: Also, all the apologies to all the people who've left comments that I haven't responded to. There was a while there where I thought I was done with fandom and couldn't get the energy to respond, but I'm going to try. Months and months and in some cases
Hmmm, maybe he should’ve created a theme song?  Had JARVIS call out “Fatality!” or something equally ridiculous every time he—anyway, getting distracted.
Thrusting doesn’t come naturally to him, but he just has to remind his body of the motions. He’s been told that it feels better if he does one hectocotylus at a time to start out with, so he alternates them, fucking them into him slowly as Steve moans and clenches around him. He doesn’t realize the tentacle in Steve’s cock is mimicking the motion until he notices another spurt of flavor and realizes he’s tasting much more than he used to be. Steve isn’t protesting, however, and he feels even harder in Tony’s grip than he was when they began, but Tony still asks, “Is this alright? Steve? Is this alright, beautiful?”
—would be required of him. It was, after all, the only thing Stark would be getting out of the deal until the end of the three months, and Stark seemed the type to believe in immediate gratification.
Sorry for the short chapter, guys, but I've been busy and will be busy for a while longer, but I didn't want to leave you hanging forever.
“For God and country, eh?  Lie back and think of America?  Wow, I can’t wait.  Can I take you home right now?”
as it were, which, wow, did that mean Captain America thought Tony was a high-class hooker?  Because if so, Tony was
“I can’t help it if you’re not very good,” Steve says, teasing as always, but his heart’s not in it.
He closed the door, wondering for a second if there were cameras in the bathroom as well and then dismissing the worry. What did it matter?
It’s obvious that he’s resolutely ignoring the camcorder, and Tony’s totally fine with that, prefers it in fact, because he doesn’t really want Steve to act any differently, doesn’t want to have to cajole and seduce a hesitant and blushing Steve every step of the way like he’s a virgin or something.  Although.  Yeah.  There are . . . that’s kind of tempting actually.
him aware of it. Article after article called him “brilliant,” praised his “incredible mind,” claimed he was an “unparalleled genius.” Companies paid Stark to consult on their projects; universities asked him to give speeches to their graduating students.
“That’s not the point,” he said, because he wasn’t actually made of iron, so of course he’d had thoughts.
He tries to bury that part, shoves it down as far as it can go. It’s not the time, it won’t ever be the time, and he just—he can’t believe he just—
force him to do anything, and Tony definitely wasn’t one of them. In a battle of strength, Steve could win without even breaking a sweat, but here, in this situation—
“Keep your head on the ottoman, don’t touch your cock, and make sure I can see everything you’re doing. Anything else is fair game, but be warned: you can come as many or as few times as you can manage, but if you don’t come like this, then you you don’t come, period. Pick up the vibrator if you understand.”
He sighed and closed his eyes, but he didn’t say anything to ruin Tony’s moment and even found his mouth twitching at Tony’s antics.
“Not at all,” Steve said, stepping back to give him room to enter.  “My name’s Steve Rogers by the way.”
But Tony lifted his head, beaming at him, and he knelt down to kiss him, whispering things like, “You’re amazing,” and “Fuck, your mouth,” and “We’re doing that again,” that made Steve smile, even as he tried to ignore how hard he was, desire so acute, it was almost painful.
Steve got up and started clearing the table. It was a typical Sub duty, and he’d balked at performing it the first day he’d arrived, but Stark had never acted like he expected Steve to do it, had gotten up after lunch and taken his own plate—leaving Steve’s in front of him—like he hadn’t even thought of the possibility that Steve would do it for him now that they were contracted. Steve had been raised to do his part, however, and it’d taken a few meals, but he’d started cleaning up after Stark as well. Stark had provided the meal after all; the least Steve could do was clear the dishes. Stark had been so pleased the first time Steve had done it, beaming at him in delight, far out of proportion to what Steve was doing. But Stark hated cleaning up, even if it just meant taking the plates from the table to the dishwasher, and he’d been thrilled.
Somewhere in all the mess of Loki’s arrival, though, that had changed. Maybe it’d been Steve looking at him like he couldn’t stand to be around him, or knowing he wasn’t going to see him again, hell, maybe it’d been seeing him walking away for good, but Tony had realized he’d done it. He’d fallen in love with Steve.
would ever do. No wonder Fury had seemed more animated! He’d probably been secretly cackling with glee!
Tony could admit that there was a tiny, spiteful part of him that wanted to climb in the suit, blast Steve with a few dozen rockets and yell, “Ha! How do you like me now?”
But Steve never had, no matter how many times he’d told himself he would. They’d reach some critical point in their relationship, and Steve’s faith would falter each and every time.
It was embarrassing how eager he was, but he just . . . he honestly had no idea what to expect, but he wanted all of it. All at once. Immediately. It was ridiculous, but he wanted everything
He allowed his drawn-up knees to fall further apart, willing to offer every part of himself up to whatever Tony wanted to do to him if only it would involve release.
“I’m—I’m fine,” he says, his back arching and toes curling in the stirrups, and he tries to relax as much as he can. Even with all the slick he’s producing and how aroused he’s been, the penetration burns, and he doesn’t get how one finger could be so uncomfortable when it usually just feels good.
But the thought that Steve was suffering because of something Tony had done, that Tony was the cause but he couldn’t do anything to solve it, couldn’t
Things would’ve been easier in many ways if Tony had actually agreed to punish him that first night, because then, at least, Steve could have admitted what he’d done wrong, atoned for it, and been forgiven. He would’ve still carried around his guilt for what he’d done, but it wouldn’t have been as bad.
He was a mess of drool and other fluids by the time Tony finished, and he swore his stomach felt swollen, but even with all of that, he just wanted to sleep, no matter that Tony was still stuck inside of him. He hadn't expected it to be so ... intense, although he probably should have. His muscles felt weak and rubbery, his knees had gone numb at some point, and his ass was raw and throbbing, but as far as he was concerned, those were problems for later, when he could string more than two thoughts together. For right now, he just wanted to savor his soreness and the little flashes of pleasure that shivered through him and rest.
with Steve, because all he can suddenly think about it is that with the way they’re positioned, they could kiss while Dr. Stark finger fucked him, and he forces himself to collapse back onto the table before Dr. Stark actually touches him and Steve tries to make that a reality.
It was humiliating how quickly he was on the edge, a miracle he’d lasted as long as he had, his hands trembling with how tightly they were gripping the blanket, his head hung low between his shoulders as he gasped for breath. He could feel trails of saliva leaking from the corners of his mouth, and although he licked his lips, there were still drops that escaped down his chin. His hips were rocking back onto Tony’s hand, undulating in order to maintain as much contact on his prostate as possible, and the sounds he was making … his ears burned with shame, but he couldn’t stop, he couldn’t stop, he couldn’t stop.
Steve wasn’t the type of person to lie about something like this. But he wasn’t the type to blurt out details about his personal life either.
He must have actually fallen asleep, because he woke up to the feeling of a deep tug, and he cried out, disoriented for a second before realizing Tony was trying to pull out.
He was relieved when the doors opened, but he still hesitated for a moment before stepping into the penthouse. Should he go straightaway? Or maybe to his own room first so he could freshen up?
“Almost two years now,” he said, even though it’d been closer to six months.  He pasted on a smile.  “But I’ve worked on cars my whole life.”
Tony comes back with a spray bottle of cleaner and paper towels, and Steve doesn’t know what he told the store employees for them to just give them to him without coming to inspect the situation themselves, but he’s thankful nonetheless.
“Look,” Tony said, rubbing his face, and Steve couldn’t read all the emotions on Tony’s face, but he could see the frustration, the regret, and for the first time, he understood Tony hadn’t made the decision to end their contract easily. A person didn’t look like
Thor had nodded in recognition of the words, but even then, it’d been too late.  There was nothing he could hide from Loki, his feelings least of all.
“I thought I showed you too,” he said, and maybe Steve didn’t mean it as an accusation, but the words still fell on Tony like a blow, because wth Steve’s revelation ringing in his ears, Tony could begin to see that Steve
“I—you’re right,” Steve said, climbing to his feet with much less coordination than he’d gone down, and fuck, Tony had to—one more. Just in case.
He still desperately wished that he’d been able to complete his punishment, wished for … so many things really, but stopping had obviously been the right thing to do. For Tony. For the both of them, because Steve didn’t know how he would’ve recovered if he hadn’t realized how upset Tony was until it was too late. This had already cut it incredibly close, and even though Tony was looking a little better, he still felt horrified that he hadn’t noticed right away. The only thing that kept Steve from drowning in guilt was the fact that getting caught up in his self-recriminations had been to blame in the first place. He had to be calm and clear-headed enough to watch out for Tony, no matter what else happened. He’d have all the time he could ever want time for yelling at himself later.
He knew that Steve would always remember him, but he didn’t want to just be Steve’s first, he wanted to be the
“We’re getting him as we speak,” he said, because he knew Natasha, and he knew she wouldn’t fail. “But we have to hurry.” He took a few slow steps toward her. “The jet is waiting to take you out of here.” Nine minutes left. “We’re going to take you home.” He held out his hand.
“What’s up?” he says, casual as anything, as if his heart rate hasn’t picked up at the anticipation of talking to Tony.
He could understand how the past week had made Tony doubt … everything they’d built together, but Steve wouldn’t be here if he didn’t care so damn much that he’d accept whatever punishment Tony threw at him for just a
to ask where you were,” he said, anger creeping into his voice, and while Steve was grateful for the crack in his calm, for any indication that Tony still cared, every word made Steve feel that much worse. “To ask if
—and he nearly fell with the force with which he jerked back at Tony’s hoarse shout of pain, barely catching himself as Tony took two staggering steps, his hand hovering over his shoulder but not touching it.
He looked away, flushing furiously if the heat in his cheeks was anything to go by, but he could still hear the rasp of cloth as Tony lifted up, pushing his jeans down.
“I’m your son,” the kid in the weird futuristic armor who had suddenly appeared in his lab in a burst of blue light said again, and oh shit, Tony would recognize that expression that managed to convey annoyance, hurt and disdain anywhere.
“Good boy,” Tony said, and the surprise of hearing those words made Steve’s breath stutter in his throat.
He took comfort from that feeling, wanted to hold onto it, except as the hours ticked by, he found himself thinking about Project Insight again and again, about what it meant for SHIELD, for the world, and he just became … tired and disappointed and
The soft ache in his chest at the thought that Tony was still taking care of him barely had time to form before he got distracted, Steve’s hips twitching down as Tony found his prostate. He wasn’t sure he managed to muffle the sound that escaped his throat, but he couldn’t tell, too much of his attention focused on the press and slide of Tony’s finger. He didn’t think he could’ve forgotten how much he enjoyed Tony touching him like this, but the growing pleasure felt out of proportion to how little Tony was actually doing.
“Yes,” Steve said hoarsely, but he looked tired—peaceful mostly, but like he didn’t have any energy left, and Tony had been there. A really intense orgasm could knock a person out, and Steve had had not one, but two in the span of a short period of time. He looked at the end of his rope.
,” he says, getting angry all over again just thinking about it.  Steve had told him the news one hour ago.  And he was leaving tomorrow.  “You've already said that we won't be able to talk much, maybe not at all!  I just want something to be able to look at in the middle of the night when I’m alone."
“A journal,” Dr. Saunders said. “I wouldn’t read it—unless you wanted me to, of course. I think it would be a good way, however, to organize your thoughts and write down events that you find significant or noteworthy during the day.”
“What the fuck was he doing?” Tony growled at Fury, keeping his voice low, as if Steve could somehow hear him from a floor away and through the soundproofed walls of his lab. It was the guilt making him so paranoid, he knew, but there wasn’t much he could do about it. Steve had seemed fine once they’d left SHIELD, had been more interested in exploring Central Park than dwelling on the events of the morning, but the last thing Tony wanted was for Steve to know he was talking about him behind his back.
Tony tormented him a moment longer, Steve’s hips twitching as Tony’s tongue thrust and rolled, his gasps muffled against his arm. Tony finally pulled away in order to mount Steve, leaving him gaping open and too empty, and his front paws thudded on either side of Steve’s face. They were vaguely terrifying, the claws seeming improbably long and sharp from this close, but Steve was just grateful to be able to hold onto his legs as he felt Tony’s cock thrust against him, hot and stiff and intimidating, trying to find his opening as Tony’s fur rubbed along his back.
Steve remembered flinching when Tony had strapped him down, being unable to look him in the eyes as Tony tried to reassure him.
“Ah, ah, ah, no coming without permission,” Tony reminded him, stroking over the impressive set of marks he’d left with the thumb of his other hand while he kept ruthlessly fingerfucking Steve, switching to four fingers to really stretch him out, which made it a little too dry since he hadn’t wet the last two. Steve didn’t seem to mind, if the noise he made and the way his thighs gave out so he collapsed on the bed were any indication.
Tony grinned. “Hell yeah, I am. But I have to get a few things ready first, and like I said, I still owe you something tonight.”
“I need to come at least once a day,” he said in a rush, looking away, as if that would help when he was blushing bright enough to light the whole damn room.
“I have no idea what I’m supposed to do here,” he admitted, and he was referring to more than just figuring out why Steve was acting differently.
Steve still felt a rush of relief at the visible proof Tony was okay, which he ignored in favor of grabbing him by the arm and pulling him inside, slamming the door behind him.
He glanced at the clock, which read 8:14. With any luck, Tony wouldn’t have eaten yet, and they could have dinner and then . . .
“Thanks,” Tony murmured, taking it at last and folding back more of the wrapper to expose the chocolate inside.
He opens his mouth to beg Dr. Stark to stop, to say that he can’t take it anymore, that it’s too much and it hurts and
But he knew he didn’t have the time for it, not if he wanted the chance to join Tony for dinner. So even though his erection still hadn’t gone down, he arranged himself as well as he could, which was pretty well all things considered—being in the Army had been useful for all sorts of things—and then made his way out the door.
After a heart-stopping moment, though, his mind rejected that idea. He couldn’t believe that Tony didn’t care about him, that every word and action hadn’t meant what Steve had thought they meant. He wouldn’t. Tony had made too many exceptions for him and had been so obviously hurt by his absence and by his silence while he was on the run.
But it never lasts, and before long, he’ll start counting the days until his next appointment all over again.
,” he corrects quickly, eyes going wide. Shit, he can’t believe he let that slip out. “Sorry, I mean, hi, Tony.”
Tony doesn’t mean to slow back down, but two of his tentacles have decided they’re going to wrap around his Angel instead of work, and while technically, yes, Tony could fix that, he doesn’t really want to.
He stayed completely still as Tony leaned forward, only moving to tilt his neck in order to make it easier for Tony.
“Yes, Dr. Stark,” he says, and he can’t seem to look away from eyes that seem much darker than they had in the waiting room as Dr. Stark gets closer and closer.
“Fury dies, and I don’t hear anything from you,” Tony said, and Steve flinched at the words, at how even his voice was, almost bored in tone. It was only the blankness of his eyes that told Steve he wasn’t as unaffected as he seemed. Tony had always been expressive, his hands flying all over and his face stretching into smiles and frowns at the drop of a hat, but it was his eyes that had let Steve know what he was feeling. And when they were masked like that, it meant Tony was hiding his emotions, because they were too much.
shower, at least for the important parts, and tries to think boring thoughts but is pitifully unsuccessful. He has to turn the water cold partway through, but the effects start wearing off as he’s getting dry, and he ends up wrapping the towel haphazardly around his waist before taking a deep breath and opening the door.
Okay, okay, fine, not all Omegas were bad news.  Happy was an Omega, after all, and Tony considered him family.  But then, Happy was Bonded, which meant that like the vast majority of Bonded couples who were deliriously happy in a kind of creepy, plastic Barbie-and-Ken type of way and who always smiled at each other and looked blissfully content, he’d likely stay that way.  Less than 1% of Bonded couples wanted a Breaking—each and every case highly publicized in the news, because something like that just wasn’t supposed to happen—and even with the endless specialists and hospital stays and various drug cocktails, some Bonds couldn’t be broken no matter how hard both parties tried.
, he might have to give Fury even more tech to balance things out, because Tony would totally have paid money to do this.
“Really, Smallville?” It wasn’t the annoyance in Bruce’s voice that made Clark freeze as he started to pull back but the resignation. “I shouldn’t be surprised—”
“So should you,” Tony said, even as he gently brushed Steve’s bangs away from his forehead, sliding his hand through his hair.
And Steve sighs, lowering the foot that had been raised to climb the ladder up to the helicopter.  It's not like Tony telling him to do it should change anything; they'd just finished foiling the enemy, everyone else is already seated, and he'd been all set to go aboard, but now that Tony's making an issue of it, Steve can't let it go.  He frowns at Tony, but the suit's faceplate is down, so who knows if it has any effect on him?
He couldn’t explain any of that without causing a scene that he desperately wanted to avoid, however, so he shook his head, a low, “I’m sorry,” slipping free.
Steve didn’t let the silence linger. “I’ll do it,” he said, turning towards Clint and Natasha. He was the one who’d been with Tony when they’d been ambushed. He was the one who hadn’t saved him.
He nodded again, and taking it for the suggestion it was, he finally let go of Tony’s hand, curling his hand into a fist in order to hold onto Tony’s warmth as he went in. He didn’t linger, and when he came back out, he walked straight to the hamper, taking everything off quickly.
“What?” Steve asked, not understanding the sudden change in subject, his stomach muscles jumping under Tony’s touch.
Steve shook his head, muscles tensing further as he realized what was coming up next. He tried to push away the echo of wrongness, the doctor’s touches still ghosting over his skin, and searched for a sense of equilibrium. It was going to be much worse very soon.
"You know," Tony said, staring at the handcuffs that tied them together, "you had me at hello, so this was really unnecessary.  Not that I’m complaining.  Who doesn’t like a little bondage in the bedroom?  Normally, however—"
Which means he probably shouldn’t point out that all the extra slick he’s been producing at home hasn’t been accompanied by any kind of excitement, nor should he mention that he hasn’t gone around smelling like someone spilled a whole case of rut enhancers on him on accident.
“Love leaves marks on all of us,” his mom said and explained how every time people’s hearts were broken, scars would form on their bodies.  The more scars, the more you loved them.  They’d gradually get smaller until they were only thin, white lines, and falling in love again would help speed the healing process along, but they’d never disappear completely.
Stark had warned him, “In the interest of full disclosure, JARVIS will know each and every website you go to and every keystroke you make. You see that camera?” he’d said, pointing to what might have been a tiny dot on the wall. “It’s recording us right now, and just like there are cameras in every room, JARVIS has eyes that see every piece of information that comes and goes into this building.”
And Steve thought about it. Thought about how Tony felt in his mouth, how thick he was, how it felt when Tony fucked his throat, and how much harder and deeper he’d go when he didn’t have to be quite so careful. He thought about how good it felt to have something inside of him, how it made everything so incredibly better, and then he thought about being on his knees, his head pressed to the ground by Tony’s hand on the back of his neck, the nipple clamps jangling with each thrust—
“Can you explain why, Dr. Strange?” Natasha asked after a pregnant pause where everyone avoided each other’s eyes.
He was sure he could hear her rolling his eyes if he concentrated hard enough. “Uh huh. Look, Tony, none of this seems like a bad thing to me.”
“Tony,” he said, debating whether he should set the items down on a clean spot—except there were no clean spots, or at least, none that didn’t make him nervous. He doubted a little spilled food would cause a problem, but then again, it might.
Steve finally manages to jitter his way down the table, his ass nearly hanging off the end as he clutches onto the sides for dear life, his legs halfway to his chest and his face almost touching the drape. The smell of his come wafts up from the material, and he squeezes his eyes closed.
Sub—alone in a new place!” Happy said, and Tony couldn’t help but feel a little guilty at the disapproving expression on his face.  He hated feeling guilty.
“Please, Tony,” he gasped, grinding down onto the bed, and Tony wondered if Steve was getting off on the pain, or if he was rubbing against the sheets in order to find some way to offset it. Steve had really gotten into the spanking, but biting was a different kind of pain.
, he told himself, and pulled off his shirt before lowering his boxers down to his knees and shifting his legs up so his feet rested on the bed. He worked up some saliva and spit into his palm, taking his cock in hand.
What could Steve say, though? That he didn’t deserve to hold Tony’s hand where anyone could see? That Tony should know better? That before everything had happened, Steve had wanted to go out with Tony and be open with his affections but he couldn’t do it
His orgasm was so intense that he couldn’t stop shivering afterwards, hands limp at his sides and knees splayed.  He watched with dazed eyes as Tony pulled out, stroking himself to completion and coming all over Steve’s already messy stomach, Tony’s hand reaching out to tenderly rub the come into his skin.
“That couch,” Tony said, hitting the wall, “that stupid, cheap Ikea couch you own is the first place we ever had sex!  Every time I go over to your apartment, I sit on that couch, and you come over and force me to cuddle, and there’s that dip in the middle from the number of times we’ve fucked on it, and it’s old and uncomfortable, but I always fall asleep on it, and maybe I don’t want to throw that damn couch out, Steve!  Maybe I want to keep it, alright?  And those curtains you were looking at?  The ones that look like they’re straight out of some damn issue of
He was almost tempted to open the door and take Stark up on the offer he’d made after dinner to watch a movie—the images so crisp and clear, it seemed that he could reach out and touch the bark of a tree or the fabric of a person’s sleeve—or go to his gym downstairs, where Stark apparently not only had a full-sized boxing ring but an indoor pool as well.
“Maybe I should have you tell me about them.” Tony turned his fingers back down and dragged them up Steve’s chest as the muscles in his torso went rigid, painted now with trails of moisture.
Tony didn’t offer him the chance, however; he simply leaned back and hummed, a happy, pleased sound that calmed Steve more than he would’ve thought possible. Maybe Tony could tell, because he smiled wider and reached out to gently tousle Steve’s hair.
The night he had come back. Tony absorbed the news, trying his hardest to keep his expression from revealing how devastating Steve’s answer was.
It was obvious that he didn’t know who the hell Tony was, which was vaguely insulting, but nothing he couldn’t forgive considering the guy had been frozen for the past seventy years.  Although he’d been awake for months, and one would think he’d know Tony’s face by now, what with all the magazine covers and news shows he’d been on recently, but whatever.
He swallowed. “It’s pretty tight,” he said, flexing his muscles. He could probably get out, but there was no point since he’d already lost this round, and Tony would release him eventually. “It’s not unbearable though.”
If Tony hadn’t told him to stay in position, he would’ve curled in on himself as the question continued to echo in his head, but Steve had to be good for all the times he hadn’t been in the past. He wouldn’t move from where he was until Tony told him he could.
“Yes,” he said, his voice low, and he didn’t think Stark could understand how much. But the smile that spread across Stark’s face made him wonder if that was true after all. “So let’s go.”
But Tony didn’t say anything else, his lips curling downward more and more, looking sad, not for himself but for
“Yes,” Steve rasped out, mesmerized by the sight, feeling like every nerve in his body had come alive from the mere possibility of Tony’s attention.
“The first one was for you,” Tony said, finally letting him go. “That one was for me. I’ll see you in three days,” he said and watched as Steve nodded and made his way into the elevator, stood there as Steve left him alone again.
“I would like another hug,” Tony said, keeping his tone easy and wondering if Steve would balk or if he’d be receptive to the idea.
“Lean forward,” Tony said, putting his other hand to the back of Steve’s neck and enjoying the sharp gasp followed by the drawn out moan as he guided Steve’s head until it was resting against the wall. Only then did he shift his other hand again and push the tip of his middle finger inside, Steve making a guttural sound in response, his standing leg trembling.
“No one’s arguing with you that you made the right decision, Tony!” she said, putting her hand on his arm.  “
It’s just like his glands all over again. “Kind of,” he says weakly, because he knows what comes next, and he grips the sides of the table with his hands.
“No, it’s fine,” Steve hastily assures him, fingers curling in the sheet and bunching it up higher, subsequently hiding the evidence of his shame and reexposing all the skin Dr. Stark had covered. “I wasn’t looking and—”
“Oh no! I’m so clumsy!” Tony says loudly, pushing his chair back with a screech and grabbing all the napkins.
“Hey, watch this,” Stark said after a minute, the only warning before he dived, plunging towards the water below, only pulling up when Steve could see the spray leaving droplets against his face shield.
“Good, good. Has anything changed since the last time you were in? Any signs of sickness? Tiredness?” Dr. Reynolds asked, smiling congenially, as if he thought that would somehow put Steve at ease.
“Of course I don’t,” Tony says as he leads Steve forward, wrapping his oh-so-firm arm around Steve’s waist. “But I want to,” he says, squeezing Steve’s side, the tips of his fingers slipping under the towel, practically burning into this skin, and fuck, who’s Steve to argue?
Steve rose to his feet, and fuck, Tony had no idea how a guy that was both taller and wider than he was could manage to look like a kicked puppy.
The security on the fifth floor was minimal in comparison to the first two floors: one guard at the stair entrance who’d been more asleep than awake and one outside the doors of the lab itself.
order the meatloaf under any condition, but you should be safe with just about anything else.  It’s the best place to wait while I tow your car in, and I’ll come get you after I’ve taken a look.”
“Eh.” Tony shrugged. “The music can get distracting, but I like the feel of the bass sometimes. It keeps me going.”
“So I put a bag in the master bedroom while you were looking around. If you’d like, I can go in with you and help you get ready, otherwise, I’ll let you do it yourself. Which would you prefer?” Tony asked, squeezing his hands gently.
Tony’s going in so deep that it actually hurts, and he knows that Tony’s stretched him out so much that he’ll be loose and sloppy by the time Tony pulls out, gaping open and dribbling slick, and the tears start falling even faster, because it’s all so good that he can’t keep them back.
He rubbed his hands over Steve’s back, and when that didn’t seem to help, he bent over and hugged Steve as much as he could, grimacing at the pull but ignoring it in favor of giving what comfort he could.
sniff of Tony’s shirt, even though it mostly just smells like him, and then wrap a spare towel around his waist and march back outside.
Stark had been quiet all day. After hours of dealing with the man grunting or talking in monosyllables instead of running at the mouth like he’d gotten used to, Steve was getting uneasy.
“So glad we had this talk, Steve!” Tony said cheerfully, already moving, and he clapped him on the shoulder and ushered him out of his room, and if there was some resistance, well, who could say for sure? He just knew that he didn’t want Steve to have an epiphany about what he’d just divulged any time soon and
While he was there, he decided to change his clothes, just because, although—should he shower? He thought about all the places Tony could possibly want to touch, and yes, he definitely needed to shower.
“Well, if you’re sure,” Tony said, stepping back. “Now bear with me for a minute,” he said, right before he threw his arms up into the air and yelled, “Yes! Victory! JARVIS, mark today as the day I finally defeated Captain America!” Then Tony started—
“I can’t believe you,” he said, even though this was Tony, so actually he could.  “What is this about, Tony?  Really.”
“You don’t have to do that,” Tony said roughly when Steve knelt at his feet, and he looked up, smiling wryly.
“Is that right?” Tony asked, letting his fingertips, one after another, slide over Steve’s exposed hole, which flexed in response. “You sure about that?”
Steve still wasn’t sure what Tony meant by that. He had his suspicions—he remembered Tony’s expression, reluctant and pained, and why would he look like that if he weren’t forcing himself to admit to something he’d wanted to hide?—but he couldn’t bring himself to believe.
“So correct me if I’m wrong, but I’ve gotten the impression that you’re expecting corporal punishment. Actually, you know what? Don’t correct me, because while we’ve never really talked about this, you should know that I prefer not to do that. I can, if the situation requires it, but I don’t like it, and I don’t intend to do it right now.”
“My role in what?” Tony said, upset but obviously confused, and Steve knew then Tony might’ve suggested improvements to the Helicarriers, but that was as far as his involvement had gone. The rush of relief that hit Steve was staggering.
For someone who had never had a Dom before, Steve had a lot of opinions about the way they acted. Or maybe it was just Tony. Maybe he just really, really,
“For a few reasons,” she said calmly, “but the most important are one, right now it matters less to me what actually happened than what you think happened; and two, trust has to be earned, and how can you possibly trust me if I’m going behind your back?”
Steve rolls his eyes, but he lets that second part go, because Tony always has to get the last word in, and besides, he'd be quite happy to be captain of Tony's pants if he'd let him.
Steve gets the mental image of that same tongue enthusiastically eating him out, and then a moment later, there’s the sound of liquid dripping onto something metallic. It takes him a second to figure it out, but when he does, he slams his thighs shut as much as he’s able to with his feet still in the stirrups and sits up, crying, “Oh crap, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” because he’s making so much slick that he’s leaking onto the step beneath him.
“Some of these are pretty deep, but overall, they look good,” Dr. Reynold’s said, stepping back, and Steve wondered if he were imagining the flat tone of his voice. “No lacerations anywhere. And you aren’t experiencing any internal pain? Or anything that seems out of the ordinary?”
“I know you do,” he said roughly, because even though they hadn’t worked out as a couple, he knew she loved him. Whatever else happened, he could always count on that. “Thank you.”
“No, really. I know this is a wild and crazy idea, but maybe instead of talking to me, you should be talking to Steve.”
Steve was quiet for a while, bridling at the thought of Tony’s rules, no doubt, but when he spoke, all he said was, “But you
He doubted Steve was even seeing a therapist anymore, now that he thought about it, or if he was, he never talked about it or kept any kind of regular schedule. Tony forgot sometimes how much Steve had left behind to be with him, and while it was all still there for when Steve went back, it had been a big sacrifice all the same. Steve had never gone into any of it with the intention of hurting him, Tony knew, and he felt guilty for the momentary spike of bitterness from before, especially since he’d accepted the consequences of them being together a long time ago.
” He cuts himself off as soon as he realizes he’s whispering out loud, but it’s too late. Dr. Stark’s head comes up, and Steve’s in real danger of giving himself whiplash as he turns away because he can’t look at him. He can’t. “Um, sorry,” he mumbles.
pleasure, too sudden and immense to be comfortable. It’s all he can do to ride it out, and when he comes to, his fingers are digging into Tony’s back and tears are leaking from the corners of his eyes, and over the roar of his heartbeat, he can hear the filthy, almost disgusting, wet sounds of Tony fucking into him.
The office lights are still on, however, when he gets out of the elevator, and thank heavens, the door opens under his hand.
at redeeming himself, and for Tony to say that … as if Steve didn’t love Tony. As if it’d been easy to approach Tony after a year away, or give up his life in DC, or let himself be vulnerable in front of Tony in a way that he’d never been with anyone else.
The Colossus was the first electric programmable computer and was first demonstrated in December 1943. The Colossus was created to help the British code breakers read encrypted German messages.
“Sorry,” he coughs and waits until everyone gets back down to business before peaking at his phone once again. The message hasn’t changed.
He watched Stark focus, coming alive briefly as he registered the question. “Hmm? Oh, pad siew and like three different types of curry. You’ll have to ask JARVIS. He knows what I like,” Stark said, although his plate was still mostly full. He gave Steve a distracted smile before looking out the window.
They stumbled over each other’s feet, and Steve twisted as they fell back against the wall, making sure he took the brunt of the impact. He couldn’t stand the idea of Tony getting hurt, not even so much as a bruise.
say, because he honestly hadn’t thought about the consequences to Tony of what had happened besides assuming he’d be brought in for questioning and monitored in case Steve contacted him. Steve never dealt with this side of SHIELD, just got the results of their investigations delivered to him in neat files, and it wasn’t that he hadn’t known the lengths they would go to in pursuit of keeping the world safe, he just hadn’t ever worried about it. “I’m sor—
“Tony?” Steve gasped, the first word he’d said since Tony had grabbed him from behind and sped off with him, and Tony squeezed him reassuringly. Well, as reassuringly as he could, he supposed, considering he had Steve pinned against him, Steve’s back to his chest, with his arms trapping Steve’s to his sides, and they were hovering a few hundred feet in the air. Oh, and Steve’s shield was on the ground.
“Don’t worry, I didn’t make them,” Stark had said, holding a plateful of chocolate chip cookies between them. As if Steve had even considered for a moment that he would’ve cooked. “JARVIS makes the meanest batch of cookies this side of the Mississippi. I wouldn’t trust him with a knife—precision laser-cutting is more his style—but if you’ve got a recipe that calls for measuring cups and a beater, he’s your man. Well, AI really. Computer.”
"I was willing to put up with it at home, but we're still technically in the field, Tony, and that's really not appropriate behavior—"
Steve had expected it to pass the mental tests as well, which it had, not only solving unbelievably complex math problems in a flurry of pen strokes that Steve wouldn’t have been able to copy if his life had depended on it but also correctly answering question after question about Tony’s personal life and the lives of those around him. The armor was perfect down to the very last detail, which meant the aliens or whatever had potentially gotten access to Tony’s private servers, so all the moments that they or anyone else had shared with Tony could very likely have been recorded and used as reference. With JARVIS and then KAREN afterward, they might not have had a truly private moment ever.
, he told himself sternly when his cock just got that much harder, and he got up to find his clothes and finally get dressed. Or maybe not, he thought, remembering Tony’s comment about milking, and shit, was he going to get goosebumps every time he thought about it from now on? He’d gone from never considering it to basically counting the seconds until it happened, and he really, really needed to stop. Later was later, and hopefully, Tony would want to do . . . something. And if not, well, Steve apparently was looking forward to that too. But whatever Tony wanted, Steve did have one request of his own.
) drew art for me!!!!!!! (sorry, I know this isn't a real chapter, but FUCKING GORGEOUS ART, I can't)
fight and that if it’d been anyone other than Tony doing this to him, he would’ve gotten free, damn the consequences. But it wasn’t anyone else, it was Tony, and he wanted to give Tony whatever Tony wanted, because he—
It’s poor consolation to realize that even if he had managed to keep the noises in, the way his come hits the drape, the shaking of his legs, and the accompanying rattling of the stirrups would’ve given him completely away.
“Wait, wait,” he panted and despaired to find he was hard again. But even now, with Tony’s knot being considerably smaller than it had been, it still felt excruciatingly good, and he realized he must have tightened up again somewhat, because it stretched him out so well. He wasn’t sure it was fair to know this about himself, that being stuffed and full to breaking could make him want even more, but he didn’t have time to regret it. Tony whined and jerked back then, once and then again as Steve gasped and desperately tried to bear down, although whether to push him out or try to keep him in, he honestly couldn’t  say, and then Tony was slipping out of him, a mortifying rush of come following right after, and Steve moaned at how empty he felt, moaned even louder as Tony settled down and started licking him clean, burying his tongue into where Steve was wet and open for him.
Steve clung to the voice as much as he could, knowing that it’d just be a matter of time before it disappeared.  He’d do anything—
He registers the fact that his fingers are fumbling at Tony’s belt without his conscious permission, and damn it, he’s desperate and very obviously so at that, but he doesn’t want to be the type of person to rush past any kind of foreplay and go straight to the fucking,
“Are you going to be alright?” Tony asks when they reach Steve’s apartment, and the answer is no, but Steve won’t admit it out loud.
He tried to figure out some way to sit down without looking ridiculous, but it was an armchair, and while roomy, there was nowhere to put his knees, especially not with the way Tony was sitting so far back. He finally had to wedge them next to Tony’s thighs, which put his groin extremely close to Tony’s face for a few nerve-wracking seconds, and it was only the absurdity of the situation that allowed him to maneuver around without blushing to high heaven.
“Steve, no, don’t,” he said, his hands coming up helplessly, not understanding what had set Steve off and unsure if touching him would make it better or worse. Fuck, he didn’t think he could handle worse, didn’t think he could handle this much without coming apart.
Steve, on the other hand, was horrible at flirting.  He didn’t believe in fake smiles, in acting coy, in being nice to someone with the sole purpose of eventually having sex.  He acted interested because he
“No,” Natasha said and turned back to Steve. “So does that mean I should expect to see you two in the news some day soon? Or are you keeping things quiet for a while?”
Bruce ran his fingers along the lapel of Clark’s suit, which probably looked pretty flirtatious to an outside observer, but then an outside observer wouldn’t be able to tell how hard Bruce was pressing down.
There’s just something about it being Dr. Stark doing this to him, about Dr. Stark doing this for his own good … it’s messing with Steve’s head. His previous exams have never really been painful. They’ve been varying levels of uncomfortable, and he would rather not talk about the amount of embarrassment he’s experienced, but the exams themselves have never gone past that. Whatever his previous doctors might have thought about him, they’ve always been professional when touching him.
“Loki,” he pleaded, sliding his fingers down to clutch at Loki’s tunic and dropping his head to his shoulder.
“Captain Steve Rogers,” he replied, all rigid lines and judgmental looks, and Tony was going to have so much fun with him.  He felt almost giddy in anticipation.
Stark glanced up at the sound of the door closing, loud enough apparently to be heard over the din in his ears.
sound to mark that he’d been there at all.  Although from all the stories he’d heard, Captain America was supposed to be extremely self-effacing, so maybe he wasn’t thinking Tony was passing up all that and a bag of chips, maybe he was surprised Tony wasn’t looking for a Sub, but whatever, because seriously?  Hot.
“I am aware,” the person who could only be Dr Reynolds said stiffly. “As soon as I realized whose chart I had—”
“Um.” Steve looks at the computer, positioned near the end of the bed. Technically, there’s no reason to say no. Dr. Stark’s going to see everything eventually anyway, and it isn’t like Steve’s body-shy. He gets undressed at the gym all the time with no problem, and Dr. Stark wouldn’t actually be
Which turned out not to be that long, as Steve seemed to catch on a little more than twenty four hours and two hugs later. It was always Tony asking for them and Steve the one to pull away, and that one was no different, except Steve moved back almost immediately, no doubt testing his hypothesis. But all Tony did was smile and ask if he wanted bacon or sausage with his eggs. Steve gave him a weighing look before choosing sausage, but Tony noticed Steve stopped acting confused during their hugs, and none of them were ever that brief again.
“Okay, so I grabbed these because you still looked cold,” Dr. Stark says, pushing two metal poles and holding an armful of what looks like blankets. “Why don’t you lie back, and I’ll put them on you?”
Tony could feel the couch pressed firmly against his arm, but it still seemed like the room was tilting dangerously.
“You look like shit,” Pepper said, and Tony groaned, slouching down in his chair and letting his head loll back. “Seriously, you need to take better care of yourself, Tony.”
He ignored him and headed toward his room—his old room—to pack. Tony wasn’t his Dom anymore. There was nothing left to say.
But Steve didn’t answer, not vocally anyway, although the shudder than ran through his body and the seeping dampness under Tony’s fingers was probably answer enough.
“Yeah, me too,” Tony said, and even though Steve could tell Tony wasn’t completely back to his normal self, the confirmation of any kind of improvement was still a relief.
“You like that?” Tony asked, pulling back out in order to do it again. “Yeah, of course you do,” he said, satisfaction heavy in his voice. He didn’t mean to sound quite so smug, but Steve’s shivered in response, and oh yeah, Tony could work with that.
Soooo......summer is not a good time for creativity for me. But you guys have to know by now that I'm going to finish this thing, so anyway, I'm back now, and hopefully, the chapters will flow smoothly from here on out. >_>
When he’d called that morning, he hadn’t expected them to be able to fit him in on such short notice. After telling the nurse his symptoms, however—tenderness in his lower abdomen for the past few days, leaking slick all day, hot flashes—she’d put him on hold and then come back to say that if he were willing to see someone other than his normal doctor, he could be seen at 6pm, even though that was when the office technically closed.
Steve was used to being the center of attention. It hadn’t always been good attention, people staring at him as he yelled at someone bigger than he was or gawking as he got beaten up, but after the serum, people had generally looked because they wanted to, and he could admit that he’d enjoyed that.
, no matter what I say, or what threat I make, or how many things I break, let me into Steve’s room until three days from now. Acknowledge.”
At one point, he had Steve pull up onto his elbows while still holding onto the headboard so he could pinch and tug at Steve’s nipples while he tasted him. Steve had already begun shivering each time Tony bit him, but at that, he started grunting as well, involuntary little sounds that had Tony’s head swimming.
,” he said, pleaded almost, and he couldn’t believe Steve was trying to argue with him about who should apologize more—actually he could totally believe it. He just couldn’t deal with it at the moment. He was hanging on to his composure by the skin of his teeth as it was, and if they started fighting again, even about something like this, he didn’t know how he’d handle it.
It hit him then that he didn’t actually know what Tony had been planning to tell him. He knew what he’d both feared and hoped Tony would say, but maybe Steve had been putting words into his mouth. Maybe Tony had just intended to reassure him that even though he didn’t love him, he still cared about him a great deal.
He hadn’t expected him to be . . . “kind” wasn’t the right word. Stark wasn’t a kind person. His jokes all seemed to be slightly barbed, and he didn’t try to ease Steve’s discomfort so much as smother it, and he ignored—no, he
Of course, it’s really hard to follow through with his resolve to get over it when Bucky texts him a little over an hour later.
?” Steve had to be joking. He couldn’t actually think Tony thought that contract had been worth the paper it’d been printed on. “I barely referenced that contract when we were in it; why the hell would I want to use it now?”
Still, it was never a bad thing to have Steve already frantic to orgasm before they ever really got started.
“But I can try,” he added, glancing quickly at Tony and then down. He didn’t want to disappoint him, and it’d been a while since he’d gone without masturbating. Maybe it wouldn’t be that bad now, he thought, even as he remembered the heavy, sickening feeling that had spread through his body before he’d understood what he’d needed to do.
Steve held the ottoman up until  his arms became numb, the blood draining away from his hands as gravity fought against his body’s demands; until sweat began pouring down, and his breathing became labored; until he began shaking all over, and his face contorted in a rictus of effort; until he started making involuntary grunts of pain, because he couldn’t lower his arms, but he had to let something out; until he thought for sure that the ottoman would drop on his head, because he couldn’t do it anymore, but better that he hurt himself than disappoint Tony one more time—
“There’s my good boy,” Tony crooned as Steve shook and gasped, as Tony fucked and fondled him and drew out his orgasm for what felt like forever and ever, a lifetime at least, the pleasure cresting over him in wave after wave. He didn’t understand why it went on as long as it did, maybe because it was a reward, because he was doing what Tony wanted and being praised for it, but everything turned slow and hazy almost, and it was a relief to let go, to get lost in it all, knowing Tony was there to watch over him.
“I don’t know,” he said crossly, because the question implied he should’ve given everything a level of thought and consideration that totally hadn’t happened.  “I’ll think of something.”
“Please what?” Tony panted, his hands tightening on Steve’s hips for a second right before he pulled out.  They both groaned, although Steve couldn’t help but notice how more desperate he sounded in comparison.
For all that Steve wants it, and he does, he wants to lay here with his legs open and Dr. Stark’s fingers inside of him forever, he still instinctively tries to close his legs when Dr. Stark pushes in. It’s nowhere near as painful as when he first started, but it still feels like Dr. Stark’s fingers are bigger than they have any right—
If things had gone better between them, he wouldn’t have added that one, but considering the situation, he felt it had to be said.
It gets infinitely worse when he puts his legs in the stirrups, when he’s spread open, the sheet barely a nod to modesty, and Dr. Stark stands in between his thighs in his damn pristine lab coat, all too gorgeous and impossible to look at. Steve doesn’t know if he’s been this turned on even during a heat, and it’s mortifying how much he’s looking forward to Dr. Stark putting on his gloves, but it’s one more drop in the sea of humiliation he’s drowning in, and he breathes and breathes and promises himself he isn’t going to orgasm as soon as Dr. Stark touches him.
Except then Steve’s shoulders began to sag in small jerks, as if his strength had finally given out, but he continued to fight every step of the way. “I don’t want to give you up.” His eyes were filled with something like shame when he looked up at Tony. “I want to be with you for as long as you’ll let me.”
Even worse, he didn’t have anything of Tony’s. No pictures or keepsakes to mark their time together, because it’d been early days yet, and there would always be time for that later. He didn’t even have a collar, not even that much to show that Tony had cared for him once upon a time.
Dr. Stark knows better by now than to stop and keeps pushing the speculum in, deeper and deeper. The stirrups clack with how much Steve’s trembling, but he can’t help it. It feels too good for him to stop.
He’d gone a little soft while he’d been having his freak out, but Steve apparently hadn’t noticed, which Tony could only be thankful for. It wasn’t as if he could explain that he’d realized he was even more in love with Steve than he’d been even a month ago, and the thought had devastated him.
that was looming over their heads, and as soon as Tony gave it to him, it’d be the beginning of the end.
buy him because they are ugly, like seriously ugly, and really, that's what Steve buys with his own money?  He looks like an overgrown puppy, staring at Tony with big, soulful eyes and a downcast expression and damn it.
“I’ve always liked a little predicament bondage,” Tony said, and he patted one of the sides running along Steve’s inner legs. “The machine is going to exert pressure outward until about here,” he said, putting his hand out to demonstrate, which meant Steve’s legs would be open about 120 degrees at the maximum width. Steve could comfortably do 180 degrees, could do more honestly, but he was relieved it wouldn’t be put to the test.
It was, and it wasn’t, because while he could feel Tony’s erection pressing against his back and have Tony’s arm across his chest, he couldn’t touch him back or see him, which wasn’t anywhere close to what Steve had been hoping for.
“These look—” Tony lightly ran his fingers through Steve’s hair around the edges of the ear, “—really good on you.”
“I’m sorry, you have to be freezing!” Dr. Stark says, pulling away. “Look, I know you said you don’t want any scrubs, but you might consider taking off your shirt. You’re never going to warm up if you’re all wet like that.” He scrunches his nose apologetically. “I can’t even offer to raise the heat. The office temperature is preprogrammed as a result of the infamous summer of 2018 apparently, and all the thermostats are locked.”
Unless someone had stolen their DNA and combined it in a lab with the intention of creating an evil super villain with Tony’s brains and Steve’s physique; now that he could see.
Yes, Tony had been hurt when he’d found out Steve had doubted him, but looking back, was it really fair to Steve that it’d affected Tony
So Steve continued to muffle his sounds against the leather and to keep his orgasm as far away as possible, and when he thought enough time has passed that Tony might be getting tired of seeing him pounding himself with the vibrator, Steve bit his lip and shoved a finger alongside as well.
“Yes, of course,” he says, even though it’s a lie because he’d be happy to be trapped here with Dr. Stark all night. It’s an odd question, though. He imagines the vast majority of patients hope their exams will be over with as fast as possible.
Which makes no sense since he really didn’t want to find out anything about Tony because of Bucky’s crazy cyberstalking. And yet.
“Just what are you thinking about?” Tony asked, curious and amused, and Steve froze. Which made it easier for Tony to run his fingertips through the little puddle of pre-come that was on Steve’s stomach. Steve’s cock flexed, as if offering itself up, but in vain.
remembers their first,” she said, and he looked away, mouth thinning, wishing he could disagree. “And you know that that experience sets the tone for years to come about what you’re willing to do and how eager you are to do it.”
There are a few reasons why he doesn’t. One, with his luck, he’d trip over his clothes and land face-first on the ground. Two, it’s extremely unlikely that Dr. Stark can actually see Steve’s problem, no matter how obvious it feels to Steve. Three, Dr. Stark is going to find out quite soon that Steve gets somewhat affected by his exams. And four … well, there’s a small, shameful part of Steve that thinks Dr. Stark knowing just how wet he makes Steve isn’t necessarily a bad thing.
He slid his bag off his shoulder onto the floor before sitting wearily on the couch.  It wasn’t as if there were anything breakable inside, mostly just clothes SHIELD had given him, all new with the creases still visible and made from fabrics that didn’t need to be rationed for war.
“I will,” he said, rough and hurried, and he felt like his head was spinning with everything Tony had said so far, but he needed to make sure Tony knew that much. “I promise.”
Stark didn’t move after the door closed, not for a long time, and Steve took his cue from him, staying on the table, even though he wanted nothing more than to get down. He could be patient, though, if Stark needed him to be.
“Good,” she said, and he narrowed his eyes, because she was playing with the edge of her skirt, and the only time Pepper fidgeted was when she knew he wasn’t going to like what she had to say.
Maybe it’d be better if Tony didn’t forgive him, he thought, even though the very idea made it feel like his chest was going to cave in. The thing was, Steve’s answer hadn’t changed. He wanted Tony, wanted to spend his days and nights with him, wanted everything he could get, and the fact that Tony had to ask, that he didn’t
They fall onto the bed, and Tony has to bat Steve’s hands away when he reaches for his clothes.  Being naked would be fun and all, but he’s
He doesn’t mean to squeeze down on Dr. Stark’s finger, but what else is he supposed to do? Dr. Stark is
His hips nearly come off the leather when Dr. Stark accidentally gets his prostate, and Steve bites down on his hand in an attempt to lock in the moan, but he’s doomed to failure. Even to his own ears, he sounds like hunger. Like base desperation.
Steve has always appreciated men’s arms. Maybe … maybe not quite this much, but that’s probably just because he’s here right now, Tony directly in front of him, and once he looks away, he’ll realize his sudden fascination is actually completely normal for him.
What he ended up doing, however, was lying in bed and staring at the ceiling. It was about a nine hour flight back to New York, but with the time difference, he’d see Tony that afternoon.
Although, how could he really know? Maybe in the same way that Steve hadn’t believed he could use his safeword, he also felt like he couldn’t be the one to end—
He couldn’t decipher the expression on Steve’s face, wasn’t sure he wanted to, and he didn’t understand how he got himself in these situations with no easy way out.
Less than 4 chapters left, guys. I'm serious. I'm getting this fucker done soon. I'm determined not to hit 100K words. Or even 90K.  Maybe not even 80K, fucking hell. This damn fic.
“Tony?” he said as Tony walked into the living room, sunglasses on his face and wearing a rumpled tuxedo that looked like it’d spent several hours on the floor. It wasn’t the outfit he’d been wearing when he’d left the penthouse.
either,” he says wryly, the faintest hint of a blush rising back to his cheeks.  “After today, I’m going to pretend it never happened.”
, which isn’t something Tony would do with someone of his own race, but he’s had sex with Humans before, and it just takes him a second to recall what’s worked in the past.
“Would he? Maybe he feels like he has to hold up his end of the contract or something.” He let his head thunk against the dummy.
What if he’s watching Steve fumble around and staring at the back of Steve’s naked thighs and imagining some other reason Steve might have for bending over in front of him?
What if Steve had been too late? What if the reason Tony had asked “since when” was because he’d wanted to compare how long Steve had been in love with how long Tony had been
“And afterward? Will I re-contract with Tony?” he asked, holding on to some twisted hope that there was another reason behind all of this, that Tony wasn’t getting rid of him the first chance he got. He’d promised himself he’d think better of Tony.
“Why would you say that?” Tony asked, barely above a whisper. Of all the things he’d envisioned, all the ways that he’d assumed things would end between them, it seemed surreal that Steve might walk away because he thought it’d hurt Tony
“Or maybe it was a ‘please find other places to bite, soft, delicate places that have never had the threat of teeth anywhere near them,’” Tony said, moving his hands once again, this time to push Steve’s thighs open so he could fit in between. He didn’t bite him at all this time, just spread him open and lapped at a spot on the inside of one firm cheek, and Steve froze, tension humming through him.
He tries to make sense of Steve’s words. He can’t what? Steve’s begging him as if he’s somehow stopping Steve from orgasming, which would be laughable considering he’s doing everything he can to
“I get SHIELD agents in my home, telling me that you’re wanted for questioning and heavily implying you’re somehow involved with Fury’s death, and still nothing. Days of radio silence, and there are explosions on the news, and there’s Natasha, and the-the
“You’ll wear the collar I give you, as well as a muzzle, ears, mittens, and a butt-plug tail, but nothing else. Puppies don’t wear clothes, so neither will you.”
marks—covering his body in striking curves and ovals. They’d be gone in a few hours time, maybe even less, but it wouldn’t change the fact that Steve had let him do it in the first place, that the memory, if nothing else, would forever be etched into Steve’s being.
comfortable. “I may have indicated to Steve . . . that I, uh—that I was . . .” He tried to think of the best way to phrase it. “ That there might be . . .”
I am sitting here, writing this letter to you by candlelight, one small candle shared by the three of us in the tent with the light barely enough to see by, and it makes me think how annoying something like this must be for you.  There are so many things we’ve lost since the First, but the lack of reliable electricity probably bothers you the most.
“Did you know that you talk about me a lot?” Tony asks, biting down briefly and making Steve jerk.  “Seriously, a
It turned out that it hadn’t been the wrong decision, not exactly. But he would have protected himself better if he’d known that this was where it would lead.
“Good,” Tony said, although it came out too heartily, as if he could compensate for how wooden Steve’s voice had become. He knew some Subs didn’t want a safeword, but he didn’t think Steve was one of them, especially considering how short a time they’d known each other.
“Now, I know puppies can get pretty rambunctious, so I’ll let you run in the gym and put on your leash for walks outside and play games with you.”
“I know I wasn’t your first choice, and I know there were things I could’ve—and should’ve—done differently. These past few days have been—and I acted like a shit, I know that. Although you weren’t entirely blameless yourself!” Tony said, glaring at Steve for a second before looking down. “But even when I fucked it up, I always tried to do what was best for you—”
“Thank you,” Steve said, even knowing it would make Tony uncomfortable, because he couldn’t not say it, and maybe it really didn’t mean much to Tony—although Steve didn’t believe that was true—but it meant something to him.
Was it just because he hadn’t suggested Steve give him one sooner? But that didn’t seem right. Steve wasn’t exactly timid, and surely he would’ve said something if he’d wanted one off the bat?
It took everything he had to wrench his thoughts off that path, to shore up the walls that were barely holding him together. Later. He’d have time for that later once Steve was … once …
The thought had made him laugh so hard at the time that he’d stumbled and nearly sliced a chunk out of his leg.
Steve felt lost and useless as he stood awkwardly at Tony’s side. They had literally just been touching, but he couldn’t bring himself to offer his arm for support, no matter how much he wanted to.
“We should arrive in five minutes,” the pilot said, breaking the silence that had been with them throughout the ride.
Also, for those of you who were worried, we're definitely going to hit 80K words. Maybe even 90K. Probably not 100K, though. >_> *is hopeful*
“What about that one?” he asked, pointing to a piece that he knew Tony wouldn’t like, but there were only three couches left that Tony hadn’t insulted, and by golly, they were walking out of the store with a couch if he had to sit on Tony until he picked the one he disliked the least.
with the rough treatment. He tried to shift to make it easier on himself, but Tony apparently took it as a sign that he was trying to get away, because he snarled and snapped at the air next to Steve’s head until Steve grit his teeth and slumped down, letting Tony take what he needed from him.
“Steve,” Tony said, smiling and looking unbearably fond, and Steve knew he was going to give in.  Of course, he’d known that as soon as Tony had said he had a small favor he wanted to ask Steve.  “You don’t have to.  You can say no, now or later.  Yes, I made it with you in mind—”
Of course, it was only after Thor had been toppled to the ground by magic that Loki had explained it wasn’t necessarily a feat of
Tony reached out to help him, but Steve’s body curved away, and it would’ve been easy for Tony to be hurt by the rejection, except he knew the only reason Steve was getting off his knees was for him.
He smiled to himself, thinking about Tony’s expression were he to ask that question. It seemed like the kind of thing Tony would appreciate.
Of course, he hadn’t known that fact until Tony had been unmasked right in front of him.  Prior to discovering Tony was Iron Man, Steve had always had a bit of a crush on the other man and had made up ridiculous excuses in order to stop and chat with Tony whenever he came to SHIELD headquarters.
They mate one more time before reaching the island, again after Steve stumbles his way onto land and Tony directs him on how to open a coconut to drink, and again after Tony brings him two fat fish to eat.
And maybe the Earth was safe right this instant, but they weren’t hidden in anonymity anymore. There were millions upon millions of planets that knew about them now, knew there were Stones to be found here, and yes, they’d defeated Thanos, but who was to say there weren’t other, even more powerful beings that wanted to succeed where he’d failed? Could Steve really leave the Avengers to fight without him when they were already down—
Lightning cracked the sky, and Steve blinked several times in order to clear his vision, imagining for a second that he could see a face filled with regret in the fading lines of light.
It wasn’t that he’d thought Stark would be a horrible Dom. A bad one, yes, definitely, he hadn’t doubted that for a minute. Not cruel—although Steve hadn’t ruled out the possibility, even if there hadn’t been hints of it in his file—but someone who’d provide the basic necessities and otherwise ignore him, too caught up in his own life to think about an unwanted Sub.
Instead of taking the elevator down, however, they’d gone up to the roof where the helicopter and pilot had been waiting—and he could recognize now that he’d been disappointed when he realized Tony hadn’t been planning to fly with Steve in his arms like before. If he was being truthful, he still was.
