Tony’s too good to attack a man while he’s down, and he’s too good to hit Steve in the face while the man checks over his worthless friend. Because Tony isn’t a fucking liar, or a bad person.
“Steve, please fuck me, please.” And Steve is on him, rewarding him, fingers finding the space between his crack, fingers seeking out the heated channel of his body.
“What? I’m not sick anymore. I’ve had enough takeout.” Tony spins around to face him from his stool.
Steve takes a moment to look at Tony, gorgeous in his well-fitted suit. The front is unbuttoned as he drives, showing his nice heather-colored vest. The pocket square is a bit more ostentatious, or at least loud.
well, hips shoving back to meet Steve’s urgent thrusts, rocking upwards until he attains a perfect rhythm between them. They’re glossed with sweat, an almost pearlescent sheen of it, and he licks a hot stripe across Tony’s neck as he takes Tony’s cock into a fist. Tony promptly makes a desperate keening noise, throbbing with unrepressed need as he snaps his hips back.
“No sweetheart, she shouldn’t have.” Tony’s hair is mussed like he’s flown the suit without a face mask, and it’s endearing as it is attractive. It’s quiet but for the distant roar of the fires billowing out the broken windows, and Steve feels like the world is being reborn right in front of them.
After he’s done drinking his fill of the suffering of the Bay Area’s citizens, he returns home to host a party for those wealthy enough to purchase Extremis on the daily. It’s a party to end all parties. And with a champagne glass in hand, he has a grand time as he tosses Daredevil into the water for having a shitty attitude.
After, they’ve gotten up and they’re shuffling around, getting their clothes on, when Nat jogs into the room. She ignores their state of undress in favor of delivering her message.
The ride back is only made possible by the suit’s navigational abilities, Tony staring into Steve’s eyes as if he’ll disappear the very next second. But Steve doesn’t. He stays mind-blowingly, maddeningly present, and Tony feels like his world has been flipped inside out and back again.
“You have no idea what you're dealing with.” If Tony wasn’t so freaking irritated from having to capture Loki yet again, he wouldn’t taunt the man in front of him. But he’s never been one for self-preservation anyway.
And oh god. He needs to hear it while he’s inside him. He wants Tony to beg, plead with him to let him go. He wants to see his Omega break when he realizes there’s nowhere he’s ever going to be besides with Steve. Steve needs it more than air, more than life itself.
“Yup! Now click search and let’s see what pops up. Oh, we have a match. It’d be good if you knew the alpha’s name?” Aisling is leaning over him, her shoulder almost touching his shoulder. It’s a little close, but New York has always been short on personal space.
Maybe he should have asked Nat. He’s not quite sure of her feelings on the matter, but she is an impartial ear at the least. And she knows how bad Tony’s ruts have been in the past. Bucky is really only a recent guest at the tower.
“You’ve been such a good boy. And as your Captain, I’d like to reward that.” Tony’s face lights up and he rolls off the bed, scampering over to a cabinet before pulling out a bottle of lubricant and heading back to the bed, bouncing as he tosses himself back into position.
Tony knows all the things people say about how relationships are supposed to be based on mutual respect and liking the other person. That even if it’s just a hookup, you should be considerate to the other person’s feelings. The thing is, Tony can’t tell Steve how he feels. He just can’t. And that’s disrespecting a man who is offering to do him
“It wasn’t him.” What if Barnes had bombed the UN? What if it were T’Challa and Tony here, both enacting vengeance for their parents. Steve wouldn’t stand a chance. He wonders where kitty-cat is. Is he self righteously telling himself that he won’t interfere? Why is everyone in this world a practitioner of “for me, but not for thee?”
His pants start to rip and Tony makes a split second, instinctual decision to undo his belt and slip out of his pants. The fabric slides down, his boots being narrow enough to fit through the legs, with the wolf doing a good rendition of Tony’s bed time routine. Finally, he’s free of his pants, and he rolls over, hoisting himself up from the ground and makes to run again.
“Symbiote liquid metal armor. It’s cool as fuck.” The shiny metal reaches for him, its slippery limbs outstretched to wrap around his arm and then his entire body. It’s fucking hot, to be honest. He turns himself on just by wearing it. Which, he hasn’t had sex in the suit—yet—but he’s going to.
It takes Tony too long to compose himself before Bucky slips out of the kitchen, leaving Tony with a desperate hard-on along with so much confusion.
As he speeds away from his interview to waylay SHIELD from making this any worse, he checks the cameras to see if Captain America has come along. Bingo. All muscle and patriotic duty.
“Don’t mention it. Ever. I don’t know why I bothered.” Tony stalks off, and Steve, in the midst of feeling low from Tony’s words, notes the sway of Tony’s hips, the slenderness of his body through the loose shirt and pants that hang off of his bottom. He looks away. Tony may be his husband, but that’s not the nature of their relationship, and it won’t be. And despite Tony’s efforts to misbehave and generally be uncharitable, the omega did show up at his door, concerned. And nothing he said after belays that.
In the time before Rogers showed up, Tony worked tirelessly on practicing disobeying Alpha commands. Recordings don’t work as well as in person, so he rigs up a hologram of Steve and the records from the com.
“This has nothing to do with Tony and everything to do with your actions. The responsibility is on you. You did this. You suffer the consequences. Not Tony. Play it again with me. My little game. One more time.”
“Well gosh, not many people ask about that for that reason, but yes, I think I’ve got some information for you. Is now a good time?”
“You do, and I’ll try, I promise I’ll try and be what you need. I want to be that alpha.” The delicate soap bubble of his happiness is threatening to burst, or maybe it already has.
“Go wild,” Tony says. Steve scoops up some of his spend and reaches for Tony’s glands on his neck, rubbing it into them with quick caresses of his thumb. He shyly takes some of Tony’s essence that’s left on his stomach and pushes it around his own glands. Tony watches with half lidded eyes and his eyes widen just a little bit as Steve smears his glands.
“I see she died in 1974. That’s not that young, but not too old either?” It’s not perfect, but it’s better than Brenna’s life.
Steve tilts his head forward, pressing their foreheads together, noses lined up just perfectly that their tips touch and tease. Tony blinks, his eyelashes brushing at Steve’s cheek, a teasing sensation of shyness before Tony flows forward to meet Steve at the apex of their lips. There’s a feeling like a freshwater spring, bubbling and rising inside of him.
Yes, Steve has just given him a massage, but he’s sore from it now, and Bucky’s soft rubbing feels like aftercare.
“As if you could kill me.” Tony swallows and levels a glare without any heat in it at Steve. From this, he knows he has Tony. Tony is listening at the very least.
“I do.” The Andorian taps his glass and gives Tony an even look. Tony isn’t deterred. Emotion isn’t something readable on alien faces at all times. Someone could look like they’re glaring at you and it turns out they’re smiling. He finds that he sometimes gets himself into trouble, but as long as he stays on subject and the subject is one that the other person has agreed to, he’s mostly safe.
“I wouldn't know.” And christ, this is what Steve has been reduced to. Taking the Lord’s name in vain in his own mind and lying. He has a fleeting thought that he doesn’t know how he got here. That this was all harder than he had in mind and while the fruits of his efforts are worth it, he doesn’t know if he’ll make it to the other side unscathed. There are so many factors that can go awry, including the one in front of him.
The Captain’s underwear is tight around his massive length and girth, and see-through wet. Tony doesn’t think it’s going to fit. It can’t fit. It doesn’t matter that he was biologically made to accommodate the size. But he realizes he feels so empty. So bereft of something critical that will make him whole. He hopes it’s Steve.
“I am soon to be your mate and husband. So yes, I do get a say. More than a say. Things are going to change, Anthony.”
“Look Steve, this isn’t going anywhere. I don’t think you care about what you did, not really. You don’t really want to change. You just keep insisting that your way is correct, when it’s not. Did you feel like a monster when you denied him access to food? Did you feel anything at all?”
All around him the city is chaos. People are staggering in the streets, their bodies shrinking and expanding, turning back into the sad sacks of flesh they were before.
“No. I won’t. You don’t know anything about me. I’m a person. Not an object!” Tony’s face is flush with rage now, and if he wasn’t so ornery and hard-headed, Steve thinks he might have been attracted to the omega. He doesn’t want one, as so far it’s been so much work. But after all, he does have one. He’d be within his rights to possess Tony. Not that he wants to go anywhere near the man.
“No, I’m—well, I’m trying to help. I know that I hurt you, and that you must think I don’t care, but I do. I’ll do the cooking for now, until we figure something out. Maybe a cooking class, or I can teach you.” He’s still holding the plate, which is rapidly cooling in his hands.
Finally, he does, and Steve mercifully rubs Tony’s face where he clenched him, hoping that he doesn’t bruise too deeply.
He can’t even resent Steve’s happiness, the man’s ability to live the life he wants on his terms, with simplicity and grace. No, if he can give Steve anything at all, any gift, it’s his silence, his ability to abort any attempt at his unknowledgeable future self at figuring it out. He knows he’s going to hate himself. Resent the implication that something went wrong.
“Starting early and hard I see,” Rhodey comments when Tony orders a double shot of scotch with a few chips of ice.
He then trips on what must be another log, falling backward onto his ass on some branches. The wolf doesn’t move, thank god, and he plucks out a broken branch to hold onto.
“Mouth. Suck me.” Those words make Steve shiver and he leans forward, thankful that Tony’s gland is on his left side and they’re laying on both their right sides. He brings his lips closer, feeling the heat radiating off of the little pucker of flesh. He licks once, and the taste hits him. He jerks, like a puppet on wires, and
They’re all beaming, and Tony’s breath catches as he sees Steve at the head of them, in full uniform, his ears peeking out from his helmet, his tail wagging just so.
Steve rubbed his face, trying to wipe away something. Was it the way Tony looked? Maybe he should have gotten naked first. He didn’t want to disappoint Steve.
“I’ve never needed your help, Ty. You really think poaching Captain America’s omega is the brightest idea you’ve had?”
“Care for me? What does that even mean?” He doesn’t want to hear Steve’s excuses, his lies, not anymore. Steve has never treasured Tony as Tony does—did—Steve.
The heat lasts for days. Longer, far longer than a normal heat. Tony has a lot of catch up to do with his body. Tony is propped up by pillows from his nest, his body in perfect lordosis. Steve perches on the bed behind him, one knee sunk into the mattress, pulling Tony to the side. He rights Tony, a hand moving his leg up to compensate.
“Well, my five year plan is to maybe go out for ice cream this afternoon?” He’s baiting Steve now, but it doesn’t seem to be working, and he hears Bruce sigh next to him in the front seat.
Bucky wanted. He doesn’t know if he could do it. It’s one thing to be shared with Steve, but anyone else sounds better in his mind as just an idea rather than a reality.
“Just couldn’t stay away?” It’s only Tony and Clint in the room, the former still pipetting various liquids into other vials before placing them inside some kind of machine.
“46 minutes and 34 seconds.” Grumbling, he eyes up Captain America’s battered suit. There are several tears across the chest that only accentuated his prolific muscles. Tony couldn’t claim ignorance as to having seen Steve’s bare chest, but for whatever reason, this time it felt like he was stealing an intimate moment. Perhaps it was a trick of the light that Steve looked so defined.
“Yeah, well, Steve wasn’t there at the time to reel you in. You’ll be impossible if he doesn’t come back. So, he just has to.” Carol crosses her arms and glares at Tony, as if Tony is the
“Stark do you hear me? You have a missile headed straight for the city.” Fury taps into his coms as a Chitauri uses the butt of its gun to smash Tony into the ground. Sparks fly as he responds.
“Studies show that it doesn’t help an omega! It only hurts us! We’re people with needs just like alphas, not windup
His self-control is in tatters, but he’s got to make sure Tony is washed before he takes him to the nest. Normally he’d be gentle and kind, drinking in the opportunity to put his hands on all of Tony. But he’s perfunctory, efficient, soaping up Tony’s hair and washing it out in a few minutes. The tub turns slightly ashy, and the oils sit on the surface. Draining the tub, Steve runs a quick shower for his Omega, washing the last of the grime away.
“As a highly specialized genius, I spend a lot of time trying to advance the frontiers of human knowledge. However, as someone who was born in New York, I secretly believe that true progress is a fantasy and that I need to prepare for the end times. So yes, hackers are gonna hack, and get the real low-down on what’s going on. Because not doing so will probably let Rock of Ages win and we’ll probably end up hogtied in the man’s dungeon.”
“They’ve been digging for hours now, and at this rate, they’ll be here in five. It won’t be long enough to– to withstand this. ” He turns his head back to Tony, eyes a predatory gleam amidst the guilt.
Steve swipes at Tony’s cum between them, lifting some to his own neck for maximum sealing of the bond. They’ll renew this between them repeatedly, until Tony does it of his own volition.
“Yes.” Steve is so calm, so reasonable. Tony wants to believe that it’s fine, but every hair on his body stands on end from some unknown, unseeable danger.
“Yes, I believe I will grab this topic by the dick. What happened Tony?” Rhodey was already dressed for action, his date for the evening. The navy suit was slimming on him, almost like his standard issue Air Force uniform, but with way less stick up the ass.
“You can’t leave. You know as well as I that you just hit rut.” Tony stepped closer, unsure of what his own intentions were. Steve bloomed, his body leaning forward and his scent changed to something hopeful, something
It’s just his luck that when the food shows up that every item is extremely spicy. Tony also comes up to snatch his portion and retreat to the workshop, leaving behind the scent of his false heat like a beacon of light. It’s maddening, and he tries to overcome the spice levels with copious amounts of milk.
“If you are an Omega, I’m yours, if you’ll have me,” he intones, letting the cadence of his sincerity wash over Tony.
“Fuck, Steve, I’m yours, I—” Steve sweeps forward and kisses him once more, lapping up Tony’s admittance. Tony mumbles something against his lips, and Steve pulls back just that much to hear it.
“How? I can’t believe I didn’t see, that I didn’t– know.” Steve had pinched his nose shut, trying to keep the pervasive scent out of his face. Tony didn’t blame him. An omega heat was designed to reduce alphas to bare instincts.
Scrambling up, he holds the branch out in front of him like it’s going to be able to help. Maybe with poking it, getting it angry, but not much more than that. So he decides to toss it in the wolf’s direction, see if it gets scared.
While technically, when Steve had been in the ice, Anthony and he weren’t married, and Anthony could do as he pleased. The omega had been linked to a string of betas and other omegas, along with a token alpha or two. It was scandalous. In Steve’s day, omegas were married off young, like they should be to curb their appetites. Instead, Tony was allowed to fool around with whomever he saw fit.
“You’ve reached the life model of Tony Stark—” He cocks his head to the side, a little customer service voice creeping into his tone.
“Please Steve, I’m begging, want you, so perfect in me, need you—” He can feel the slush of cum inside him, his belly distended and biology designed to perfectly keep in an Alpha’s spend to ensure fertilization.
It’s shameful how badly he wants Tony, even when he’s sick. He’s better than this. He’s disgusted with himself.
Steve nods. He knows she doesn’t know exactly how he feels, which after their intimate session, he’s riding a high he hasn’t felt since he met Peggy. It’s disturbing but also a mercy that he’s feeling as good as he does. Only a day ago, he was in a plane ready to die to keep New York safe. The fear of losing hasn’t worn off, but somewhere in this, he’s found a light in the form of a strong, smart, opinionated brunet.
The doors open to the room and there’s Tony, hunched over equipment that has streams of wires hanging from it. He’s filthy, jeans slung low on his hips, his boxers peeking out the front and back of his pants, soldering iron in his hands. There wasn’t much to say about the tank top he had on, because at this point it was mostly grimed from working in the bowels of some machinery. Tony keeps spare shirts on hand like he did terry cloth, but he so rarely changes into them. It warms Steve to think that sometime soon, he’ll be peeling those off of Tony, bathing him, and tucking him into Steve’s bed.
Food finished, they all meander back to the tower, Steve and Thor righting flipped over cars that they pass by. Tony’s armor is heavy around him, the power barely able to maintain his ability to walk. He’s this close to slinking out of the armor and letting it fall to the ground, but his pride won’t let him.
His knees give way, flattening his body to the ground while Steve practices the art of becoming; becoming Tony. Hot fingers trace along his gland, seeking. It’s always tentative, Steve looking for something in particular that he only seems to find when he’s close to losing himself in Tony.
“Ok, well talk. Tell me off for doing what I’m doing. Scold me. Make it scathing. I like it rough, baby.” Tony walks around the bar and sits on the top of the couch, one leg pulled up and the other still on the ground.
Steve can’t help but put his hands everywhere, Tony’s soft flesh calling to him to cover, to protect. It’s too easy to drape himself over Tony, hands reaching down and under to grasp at Tony’s wet and leaking cock as Steve positions himself at Tony’s entrance.
As he ducks around, dodging tentacles and other oddly shaped limbs, he finally finds what he’s looking for, the dingy exterior a siren song promising dubious clientele and even more suspect beverages.
“When is it not about money Pepper? The city isn’t going to stay beautiful for free. Watch.” All around him, the sheep he’s shepherded into the gates of heaven, fall, and turn into their former, uglier selves. Witnessing their tears of agonizing stupefaction is more fun than he expected, and he chuckles as he pulls out his phone and sets the price at $99.99 a day for Extremis.
“Hey, I am doing what any reasonable person would do! Cloaking myself in a wall of denial and pretending that nothing happened.” He pokes at the panel, not making eye contact.
“I can’t fucking believe you,” Bucky hisses, his metal hand flat on the table as he leans over it. “Never, when I gave you those pills did I think you would do this.”
Altogether, though, Tony is speechless, and he blushes, placing gentle hands on Bucky’s arm while the other man stares down at Tony through the curtain of his long hair. Bucky’s eyes are a more solid, consistent blue than Cap’s, a kinder determination than he used to have swimming in their depths. The Bucky of before was all furrowed brows and downturned lips, struggling with his identity as the Winter Soldier. This man is more secure in himself—maybe less Bucky than he is James Barnes or the Soldier, but somewhere in between.
“Fuck!” Tony trips over something and whirls around to look at Steve, his face guarded and pinched. He’s covered in grease and his jeans are ripped in several places.
Steve’s response is muffled by the warm metal cock that’s wedged in his throat. Which is just as well, because nothing he could say would contradict Iron Man’s words.
When she gets to the room, there’s already a silent gathering of medical personnel and other pilots. Rhodes walks forward and grabs Natasha’s hand as Steve picks up the other helmet and puts it on.
It doesn’t take them that long to get everyone from the building. The fire department is there with its portable cranes and long hoses, sluicing the building with water from the top down. Clint doesn’t shoot him this time at least, but both Natasha nor Clint say anything to him on the coms.
“Say it, Tony. I need to hear the words.” Steve glides his hands up Tony’s body, petting his neck where the mating glands sit, his face so terribly kind. It sends shivers through him that trail down his spine and coalesce at the base of it, a threatening storm of sensation that promises to overwhelm.
“Lie.” Tony presses his hips forward and bumps at Steve’s waist, where his hardness is now surely squeezed against his pants.
Their lips mashed together, and the teeth and spit were jarring, her lips thin and jerking under his. If he’d had ardor in the moment, it iced considerably with their kiss.
“Tony, my darling, it’s so good to see you.” She lays a proprietary hand on his shoulder before she drags her claws down the fabric, leaning in for a kiss to his cheek and then his other. Steve says and does nothing. Tony knows he hates when people touch him, but they’re in public, and some things are required.
He doesn’t make it far. Steve gets one arm, and Bucky is right behind him grabbing the other. He thrashes, but it makes little difference as the alphas press him between their chests, hands everywhere on Tony.
“It’s fine. If you want to be sorry, just don’t do anything like that to your omega.” Trevor’s eyes are hard, accusatory.
“Steve, yes, I want it, I want you—” That does it for Steve, and he’s coming, the first volley squishing out of him, knot so thick that it all but pops back inside Tony before they’re locked together, the slow but methodical pump of Steve’s cock undulant inside his hyper sensitive channel. Steve collapses over him, wet chest pressing into his back. He kisses the back of Tony’s neck, his spine, licking a fine stripe of sweat off Tony.
Tony is his. His to fuck and take care of. To nurse through his heat. His alone. If this is all he gets, then he’s going to make sure that they share this. He’ll stay close to Tony throughout the night, and make sure any other contenders don’t get close.
“Ahh! Please, please let me go.” The wolf holds tight and pulls at his shoulder with his teeth, causing Tony to release another sob of pain. Adrenaline is keeping him from feeling most of the discomfort, but it
The soft whine of repulsors fills the room as War Machine barrels his way in. Everyone already knows what’s coming, and they all dive out of the way. Natasha hustles Bruce out of the room as Clint pulls his bow and knocks an arrow. Thor raises his hammer, eager to fight.
“Sounds like you’re having a midlife crisis. Let me be the first to inform you that I won’t be staging an intervention.” There are stars in Tony’s blue eyes, the glint of Extremis tingeing them a lighter blue. He’s going to bind and leash each one.
Steve sucks in a harsh breath but doesn’t pause his ministrations, and Tony lets out a low moan when Steve gets at the stubbornly tense tissue in his right shoulder. Steve’s hands roam south, rubbing the base of his spine and pressing down above his glutes. Tony should feel some sense of shame, but he doesn’t care, because he hasn’t been touched like this in so long—and if this is all he gets of Steve, he’ll take it.
“That’s classified, and I don’t want any discussion with other agents. If a word about this comes out, since you’re the only tech who knows, I’ll be back here for you.” Steve is disapproving enough, frighteningly so, that no agent would dare break what rules SHIELD already has in place for improper sharing of information.
He supposes he can just let Tony’s budget go back to what it was and just… monitor it. He should see what these events that Tony goes to are like. Whether they are or aren’t appropriate for Tony.
He pulls off Tony, panting, trembling with his own need. He grinds his own cock down on the bedding underneath, feeling the slide of his own skin, back and forth, his knees bending so he can get more friction.
“For you sweetheart. I’m hard for you,” Steve promises. Then Tony moves, and Steve lets out a sound like Tony is
that he has. Tony tries to move his hips into the brutal fuck that Steve is giving him, but Steve grips Tony tightly and angles him just so. The slapping flesh as Steve drives into Tony is obscene and hungry, and Steve feels feral, with no thoughts other than Tony, Tony, Tony.
Steve had always been too sickly for heats and those sorts of things. It had protected him from having to marry, though omega males were not always expected to. Half the reason he thought Erskine took him was because he didn’t have heats or an alpha to bother them while they worked to make him better.
“I’ve had such luck with this program, honestly. All my heats have been so professionally handled.” The Omega splayed her fingers out in attempted commiseration at the sorry state of the market for top-shelf bondmates. She was finely dressed, clean lines in the designer clothing she wore. Understated, poised. The kind of balanced where ten people who met her the same day would give different descriptions of her personality. Tony knew what that was like. Being a chameleon.
The slow expansion of his channel is bliss, and he orgasms again, his own cock releasing smaller amounts of cum than before. Soon, he’ll be milked dry.
The interior of the apartment is the same as when Steve had moved out—basic, everyday items sit on the kitchen table, gun ammo on the living room desk, clean clothes in the closet—stocked just enough for an Avengers to live off of for a weekend away from the tower or to emergency restock. It’s
“I just did.” In the air, he circles and looks for the nuke, establishing contact with its rudimentary piloting system through JARVIS. There’s not enough time to hack it, and even if he did, where would he send it?
He thinks that Tony might be right, that Tony isn’t fitting the mold of a regular omega, but for the life of him, Steve can’t figure out why. He’s tried everything but holding Tony’s hand through all of it. Which he shouldn’t have to do.
“Babe, Tony. Say you’ll be mine.” Tony wants to answer yes. He very much does, but he’s shocked into silence when he feels teeth on his shoulder, clamping down just under where his mating glands are. It’s a threat, a promise.
Ok, so he’s made a mistake. He should never have let Bucky do that. Tony is out of his mind with how to cope, and he doesn’t know if it was just yesterday that it happened or a week ago. He hasn’t seen the sun in an age and the couch is starting to smell like his unwashed body. Several times JARVIS has turned away people. Bucky, Steve, Pepper, everyone.
The accusations about privacy are laughable. If people think they had privacy before his drones were in place, they were fooling themselves. Tony is in every home, every crevice of technology. Does your fridge connect to your phone? Then as does Tony connect to you. This was just removing the thin veneer of illusory confidentiality. There is nothing Tony is not inside, nothing he doesn’t know.
“At first I thought you were the kind of fella that was aimless, selfish. Given all these things and doing nothing with all of it.”
himself spill hot liquid down his crevice and onto the sheets. Steve moves up the bed, cock glistening and stuck haphazardly to his thigh right next to Tony’s face, the knot still puffy and red. Tony wants to lick it, to taste himself and Steve, make himself useful.
of all people, set something off in his loins. He felt taut, a string ready to snap as soon as Steve stroked it just so.
“I’ll be honest. You’re all the same in the end. I’ve never met one alpha in my life who hasn’t crossed the line at least once.” The other omegas stay silent beside Trevor as he speaks.
“—Right here.” Loki links arms with Tony as Thor does the same, and walks all three of them back towards the tinny voice that’s calling all pilots.
As he disembarks from the train, the couple lingers in his mind, taking up space and forcing him to question his views on food. Perhaps now it’s ok for alphas to do that sort of thing, but in his time it was looked down upon. Steve has always been a good cook. And it was ok to do when it was just him and the Howlies. It’s not like there was anyone else to cook for them.
Bucky isn’t fooled by anything, and he side-eyes Steve with what looks like apprehension. Steve gets it. His behavior is off from his usual.
Steve was never good at following orders, and if he could have snuck away, he would have. But he’d learned all about Bruce’s little green problem, and he didn’t think he could just sneak by. On the list of rules were Don’t Make Bruce Angry along with Don’t Touch Tony’s Coffee Stash Upon Pain Of Death and the newest rule, Feed Steve Three Times A Day, Or Else. He didn’t have to like all the rules, but he liked some.
In the meantime, Tony goes to unevenly chop some red pepper, leaving seeds scattered in the mix, and he adds them to the eggs, which are already mostly done from the high heat that Tony has left them on. The kitchen stinks of overcooked eggs, and as Tony tries to flip his makeshift omelet, it falls out of the pan and on top of the burner on the stove.
“Then come with me. We may need more blood.” He gamely follows as she leads him to the medical center where all the people he’s met so far are gathered.
“I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it.” Tony dropped the other file, snatching his personal folder from Fury. There was no denying he was interested in what Natalie had to say. Even though she was an Alpha, her scent, designation suppressants, and acting had been so sound. She’d played an Omega so well, but when she’d strode into the diner, that walk was all Alpha.
“I love you.” It slides out easily, but it feels like it tears pieces of himself with it when it goes. Out from his lungs, his heart, his very soul.
Right now he knows that Tony is just play-acting at accepting the deal. Tony wants to hear the rest of it before he decides his plan of action. They’ve been opponents before, and it’s given Steve a new and better perspective on Tony’s strategies. Not that he hasn’t always known Tony’s play.
“Good boy. Such a good boy, begging so pretty for it. Can you plead just a bit more, love? Want to hear you.” Steve is sheathed tight into Tony, the sound of his cock moving in and out loud and wet, like Tony is sucking him off. He stops spanking in favor of gripping Tony’s hips, kneeling on either side of Tony’s body.
He needed a knot, and he’d pick any knot but Steve’s right at that moment. Steve didn’t smell so good at all. His instincts, which had been quiet initially, roared through his body, up and up, until his whole head felt swallowed into a miasma of want. He had to keep it together. But it was so hard, his control fraying at the edges with every gulp of air.
Tony knew that the places he went and the people he often saw were beautiful, or considered so. Sweeping arches with soft frescos covered the vaulted ceiling of the event hall. He found it less charming than the sleek and modern designs he came up with, but respected that art was a form of power. It was why he had Pepper decorate the walls of the tower exclusively.
He’s dressed in a suit that wouldn’t look out of place on an alpha, and Steve thinks something must have gone awry for Anthony to think he can walk around with an exposed neck and incorrectly gendered clothes. Maybe things have changed, but it still looks out of place to Steve.
Tony quivered. There was one solution that the omega inside him absolutely loved for an idea. But the other side, Tony’s alpha side, screamed in protest. Tony shivered at the thought of Cap forcing the issue, forcing him down and bowing his back–
“Wait, hold the phone. Did you just—Did you—What, you’re offering me sex? You’re putting that on the table. This is—” Pointing at Steve, his suit wiggles with contained uncertainty. Always wearing his emotions on his sleeve, Steve thinks.
“I’m sure, let me do this for you.” And that confirms it. Tony feels simultaneously blindingly happy and anguished at the thought that this is all it is.
“What? That’s—what in the fuck are you thinking?! I’ve been living like a ghost in my own house trying to escape you!” Chin held high, his voice shakes with rage.
“I shouldn’t have brought you here. Into this. I don’t know what I was thinking.” Tony hugs his knees to his chest and looks away from Steve.
Between his wings and his prostate, Tony exploded into an orgasm that overtook him in a crashing wave of sensation. Steve doesn’t take that long to follow after, grunting out and filling him with hot spurts of come, grip tight on Tony’s wings. They shudder together, Tony’s wings fluttering without control.
The doctors stay for several hours, and finally, one of the medical team comes out and stands there waiting for Steve. The beta has a pinched frown on her face.
.” That sly smile transforms itself into the toothiest sneer he’s ever seen. “Like I would ever want your knot. If you want it, you’ll have to take it. Show me how much you don’t mean anything you just said. Come on. I’m no super-soldier but I think I can still tear you apart.” His words are vicious, as sharp as a paper cut and stinging wherever they land. Steve feels the warmth of Tony’s breathing on his neck and he shudders.
Instead he hovers closer, closer, letting the warmth of his breath bounce off of Tony’s face and back to him in a loop of soft heat. Tony’s lips are parted in askance, and there’s just the barest hint of saliva on them. They look soft, plump, and pink. Steve’s eyes dance back up to Tony’s, waiting for permission.
“JARVIS put everything we got into the thrusters.” Tony knows he sounds desperate, and he rises off the ground in a shower of sparks and repulsor energy, blowing Chitauri off of him with ease.
“Right! It’s worth a try, and if it’s successful, we can let more in from the street and get them to safety. Yes, it’s a plan, I mean, I bet I could crop dust the entire street anyway, but that would be complicated—” Tony is muttering to himself, looking into a microscope and fiddling with the lenses. Who knew they’d gotten so small.
The Subaru handles the highways well, and he uses it as hard as he uses his sports cars, zipping between cars and hurtling forward at about 90 mph. The sun is out, but since his Subaru is new, there are barely any dust motes to dance in the rays. It’s sterile, lonely.
“I am sorry for hitting you. It was wrong, and I won’t do it again. I thought I was enforcing discipline, but I realize that it was hurting you and wasn’t helping at all. Is there anything I can do to make it better for you? I would like to commit to doing that.”
“You want me to make it good baby? Fill you up?” Tony starts babbling, blaspheming god, and it’s not anywhere near coherent. With that, Steve pushes in, steady but quicker than he would have chosen, had Tony’s body not opened itself so beautifully to Steve. He feels Tony’s internal muscles give, and faster than he thought possible, he’s seated inside his Omega. It’s so disorienting, the feeling of everything funneling down to a single point that leads out of his cock. It’s everything. Tony is all that he’s ever needed.
He’d ask where Steve was when Howard was laying hands on him, but that’s not fair. And anyway, the defense he gets now satisfies every broken dream he’s ever had about Captain America saving him. Steve has been healing his childhood one glowering stare at a time.
There’s no hope for Tony like this. Natasha watches as Carol holds the crumpling form of Rhodes in her arms, the man shaking with loss.
“I think so. It’s very TMI, but I think it’s possible you’ve given him antibodies through—well, you know.” Bruce is red-faced, hiding beneath his salt and pepper curls and not meeting Steve’s eyes. A sharp bark of laughter comes from Nat’s throat and she gives him the barest hint of a smile.
“You bastards,” Tony cursed under his breath. He pulled the wings tight to his back, or tried to. His brain was still acclimating to the extra limbs that were attached to him. Mostly the wings just did whatever they wanted, like lay waste to the surfaces of his workshop and any other countertop that had the gall to exist with stuff on it.
“Ok, I guess I understand.” He doesn’t understand, exactly. They are married. They have to make this work, and to be perfectly frank Tony has only demonstrated the same behavior that Steve has a problem with. If the priest hadn’t said that Tony’s sins are his own, he would have had Tony over his lap in an instant.
“I’m always beautiful,” he deadpans. Tony watched Steve circle around the counter, gaze still locked onto the monstrosities sticking out from Tony’s back. Steve really likes the wings, and the wings really like Steve, and all of that was just a clusterfuck waiting to happen.
“I’m trying to understand, I am. I think I know the specific things I did were wrong, but when I look at omegas, all I see is someone to be protected, and that doesn’t feel wrong to me.” Steve shifts in his seat and tries not to look at Natasha to see what she’s thinking about all this. Her face is as impassive as usual.
“I’ll never forgive you then.” The words feel like fire, destruction. He’s severing the line between them, as sure-sounding as he was when he told the world that SI would no longer produce weapons. If only he could claim that his whole self agreed. The Omega in him was screaming, thrashing with hurt and want. Tony slammed that part of him down, buried it with a litany of facts that didn’t include his life choices being dictated by instincts. This part of him wasn’t him. It was a burden. A cruel and inscrutable burden from nature itself.
“Won’t bother you again.” Tony’s fingers enclose Steve’s, and he pets at them, trying to scrape the essence of what Steve has done off of them. Steve belongs to Tony, and Tony belongs to Steve, and if their deaths are Steve’s, then they’re Tony’s as well. The tight squeeze of his gut begins to loosen, and he feels delirious relief swell inside of him.
“Play my game Rogers, or get up and get out, and never come back to SHIELD. I don’t think you recognize how serious this is. Fury can and will cut you loose if you fail to change.”
“I’ll believe that when I see it, Mr. Stark.” Tony had to hand it to him. In a twisted way it made sense that Cap was going to believe what he saw, not what Tony says. But it leaves a bad taste in his mouth nonetheless. He should be used to it by now.
“Admit it darling, and I’ll stop.” Steve doesn’t say when he’ll stop, which is after he’s good and ready, his knot locking in the copious amount of cum he has waiting for Tony. The knot increases expulsion of sperm in spades, and it’s nothing compared to a regular orgasm without a knot.
“We can have whatever contracts you want drawn up Tony. I’m willing to negotiate. We just need to get it stable.” The wheedling is covered with a veneer of slimy salesmanship.
“I’m not mad Tony. That’s the worst part. I’m just disappointed. Because now it’s not a question of whether I can accept Iron Man or not. You are Iron Man. You’re him, and Iron Man makes the kind of decisions a leader does, not a partner. We can’t be— we can’t be that. I’m so sorry.”
“None whatsoever. I’m as shameless as a newborn.” Tony is grinning at him, a dare, and a challenge to Steve’s authority all at once.
He’s got all his ducks in a row now, and the Andorian nods, so Tony opens the door to the room, leading them inside.
“You can’t be serious. Oh my god, you are serious.” Steve sits on one of the many couches and pats his leg once. He doesn’t expect Tony to come right away, but he does want him to come over of his own volition. Blinking rapidly, Tony makes his way over carefully, as if he’s picking through some kind of obstacle course. When he comes to stand before Steve, Steve pats his knee again.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Steve says. He doesn’t know what else there is to say otherwise. Steve would never force himself on Tony.
“So. Magical healing dick!” Tony is sitting up in the bed drinking a cup of water and staring at Steve with glee in his eyes.
“Tony—” Steve looked pained, yet there was no way Tony had sympathy for any Alpha who was told they would have the privilege of spending heat with an Omega. What other purpose did Alphas even serve, anger tainting his own scent causing it to go slightly acrid.
“You fucking rapist–” Rhodes roars as he pulls a gun out latched onto the suit and fires it into Steve’s arms. The bullets hit with like pebbles being flicked at him, but the sting after they settle agitates.
Tony is rattling off curses and otherwise begging for release or more, maybe both. Steve can’t tell. It’s impossible to stop thinking about how he’s impaling Tony on his fat cock, and how absolutely perfect it is.
“Yeah, but well you see here, in 1938 she was institutionalized for a few months, again in 1941, and again in 1947. This institution in particular dealt with deemed problematic omegas. Rape was common there, by the guards. The treatments were what we now define as inhumane: full restraints, denial of nests, heat prevention tactics, non-consensual gland rubbing. A lot of omegas didn’t make it out alive. She must have been so strong to go in three times and come out each time. Those places were death traps, designed to do away with unwanted omegas. She probably had children.” Steve doesn’t even know what these things are. He’s never heard of denying an omega their nest. Restraints, yes, he’d thought, maybe at one point he would have restrained Tony if it hadn’t been made illegal. Now he can’t imagine Tony tied down by a leash and collar, much less a full set of manacles.
“Oh no. I’m not playing this game. Not anymore. Leave me out of it!” Tony stares defiantly at Bucky, daring him to do something. Anything.
Tony’s only answer is a moan. Steve pulls Tony into his arms and breathes in their combined scent. It’s a heady aroma, and Steve finds himself licking at Tony’s gland on his neck. He wants to bite into it so badly, but he remembers himself and keeps to laving and nibbling.
“Oh, this is nice. This must have been expensive.” Tony holds the blanket up to the air and examines it, rubbing his thumbs along the seams at the top where he’s gripping the fabric.
“Oh Tony, that’s not stupid at all. They hurt you.” Steve’s arms curl around Tony, bracketing him from whatever forces exist in this world that intend him harm.
When he gets there, the team is performing a rescue operation on a building that’s on fire. Natasha and Clint are drawing people from the building one by one, and as he looks up, he sees Iron Man blasting out windows with his repulsors and diving into rooms.
Yet it feels so good. And he lets himself imagine Tony eating the food, maybe throwing in a little moan on a particularly good bite. If he thinks about it more, he wonders if Tony would let Steve feed him.
“Yeah, I get it, thanks.” Rhodey’s tour guide has been a fount of negative comments since they left the station. He gets that the man is right, but this is his best friend they’re talking about. Ever since Tony disappeared a year ago, Rhodey has spent every guilt ridden month coming back to this place to look. He’s not sure what he’s trying to find, but there’s something that tells him that Tony can’t be dead. That he wouldn’t just disappear. Tony has always been larger than life.
“That wasn’t what I asked.” Dr. Nowak’s eyes are sharp, and his voice is piercing as he asks the question.
“I’m not your Omega. And I’ll never forgive you because there will be nothing to forgive in a few hours.”
The wolf’s grip tightens on his shoulder and he feels the slide of its cock up and down his crack, a wet warmth that makes him shiver and shake. This is well beyond anything that a wild animal would do. He’s not sure if he’s more frightened by the idea that the wolf is semi-sentient and isn’t interested in his consent, or if this really is just an animal that’s interested in… fucking him.
“You may be a genius Stark, but you sure are an asshole.” Clint stalks off then, Natasha slipping into step behind him, leaving Fury glaring at Tony. Tony throws on a lascivious little smile right back, which causes Fury to huff and follow Clint and Natasha. That left Great America, the emotional rollercoaster that was Steve Rogers, to continue focusing on Tony.
Steve’s heart swoops down to the bottom of his stomach. All of his best-laid plans, going to waste. The version of Tony in his head gives a sly smile, as if Tony himself knows that he’s unattainable. It makes Steve burn all the more for want of him.
Bucky doesn’t disappoint as his fingertips gently circle Tony’s entrance, testing the landscape to see if Tony is receptive.
“Wait, what are you—stop.” He puts his arms up against Steve’s chest, and Steve smashes them to the ground above Tony’s head, both wrists held in one large hand. Steve continues his ministrations, pulling stubborn panel after stubborn panel, flaying the armor from his flesh. He can’t help it, he wriggles, uncomfortable, between Steve’s thighs, and Steve responds by letting his hands go and flipping him over.
Tony remembers the feel of the cloth down his back, his chest, and most especially the gentle swipes at his wet and gaping hole. Dollops of cum seeped out of him in the water, the trail of white dispersed by Steve’s dip of his hands into the tub. Another way of claiming, as Steve gently kissed him. Breathless, open-mouthed kisses, with Steve’s hot tongue swirling around his own, licking at his teeth and gums.
“Yeah, I can’t remember what I’ve started, and I’m never finished.” His eyes sparkle with mischievousness, and he snatches the coffee pot off the counter to refill his cup before giving Steve a careful nod and Nat a hand wave goodbye as he meanders out of the kitchen.
“Then he’s not causing himself harm in the medical sense. May I suggest you do some reading on omega biology and socialization.”
“I forced nothing. Tony chose to bite me back.” He’s getting angry now. Tony is his. Not a thing in the world is changing that. Any attempt to kill him could result in Tony’s death. Their bond is strong. Steve made sure of that.
As he leaves the room, he speculates that while Steve and he share a primitive emotional connection, that doesn’t mean that Steve couldn’t somehow block Tony out, or do disappointing things regarding Tony.
“Never meant—” The shield comes down and the HUD is flickering, Friday warning him that he can’t beat Cap hand-to-hand.
.” Is all his fuck toy has to say before Steve licks his palm and grasps onto Tony’s weeping cock, jerking it roughly. A cry claws its way out of Tony’s throat, and his dick is spitting hot streams of cum over Steve’s hand and Tony’s belly. Steve bears down, pushing himself in as far as he can, until he can feel the slight strain of Tony’s ass clench around him.
Slowly, slowly it nuzzles down his back, sniffing and huffing at his body, until it reaches his boxers. He feels its nose dig around, and he has no idea what to think as the wolf bites at his waist band and
We are terrible for one another, and yes we are a disaster. But tell me your heart doesn’t race for a hurricane, or a burning building. I’d rather die terrified, than live forever. - A Softer World
Steve’s only met with soft little whimpers of need as he touches Tony, and Steve reaches down again, petting Tony’s hair, drawing his hands down Tony’s face to his neck and shoulder. The olive-toned skin is sweaty to the touch, hot and silken. It feels intimate, like Steve is a thief, stealing something precious for himself that doesn’t belong to him. But he can’t stop himself, with how much he wants to touch Tony, to feel his skin and cries as though they’re one endless stream of sensation.
What are they going to do? Whoever that was will be coming for them. Maybe not soon, but Tony can’t fathom how they wouldn’t want revenge for what just happened.
The kiss they give each other is all kinds of sloppy and needing, lips diving in and out of each other’s mouths. Bruce flees the room as Tony laughs.
Outside is pandemonium. Men in more tactical gear than he’s ever seen in the army are clustered in twos and threes, firing relentlessly at the door through which more broken and bleeding people are streaming through. There are only so many bullets, Steve knows, and the stream of people is endless. He looks for another exit, finds it, and bolts to the door, depressing the handle and spills out into a large hallway. There’s fewer of the shambling people here, if they can truly be called people, but they all look at him as if they are one hive mind and let out horrid gurgles and moans, their lips peeling back from their teeth.
It was always easier when Tony had something to fight. Now he was just scrapping at his scabs, letting the blood dribble out of his wounds. As if he could shed his filthy thoughts of reviving her and killing her all over again. Of his pathological jealousy of whoever had done it. Whoever had taken from him what was
Tony stands in the shower, counting his Fibonacci sequence tiles that he had custom laid into the walls. He wishes it were the gala tonight that’s making him anxious, but he’s consumed with thoughts about his impending heat. He’s worked most of the day, blasting music and generally banging loudly at his equipment. The silence is unnerving to him, so he avoids it, and with it, any self examination.
respect you, as a teammate. I’ve—” One step forward, two steps back, though Steve had come closer in the meantime.
Tony sneaks glances at Rogers as Bruce monologues about his terrible depression. Tony can’t blame the guy; Tony’s soon going to know what it feels like to be out of control, to be someone he’s not. His heat will make sure of that.
He licks a quick stripe up Tony’s crack, catching a little roughly on Tony’s rigid hole. Coming back around for another lap, he stops and focuses on Tony’s entrance, pleading with his tongue for it to open. It’s so charming how Tony tries to keep his body closed to Steve, but eventually the delicate petals of his ass loosen and Steve has his tongue shoved inside while Tony starts to moan.
had to keep Steve’s rescue from Tony even a second longer than necessary? I could almost accuse you of setting this up. If Tony doesn’t make it out of this…” Natasha trails off, accusing and threatening all at once.
“Luck doesn’t have anything to do with it. This is a numbers game, sweetheart. And while the numbers have always favored me—love me some math, you know—I’ve scented more people than you’ve met. And I have an extensive distrust of institutions that measure compatibility via personality tests.” Some personality tests worked, it was true. And he wasn’t about to admit that they’d mostly pegged him, but for his occasional need to be chased and dominated. Sometimes controlling trauma was a matter of repeating the same incidents, but this time, with victory on the mind. He tried not to think of Yinsen; the Alpha’s gentle hands haunted a place in his mind he never wanted to go back to, but lingered like a ghost in the hallway anyway.
“Do that, and we don’t have a problem,” she says, searching his eyes for a confirmation. He tries to give it to her, not looking away from her scrutiny.
“You may say things that you don’t mean, and I can’t hold them against you. I remember.” Steve starts to take his clothes off too, loosening his belt and unbuttoning his shirt.
Their lips meet, and it’s so warm and silken that Steve sucks in a breath around Tony, drawing him in for more. Steve can taste the coffee inside Tony’s mouth, and the flavor of that and Tony is heady.
He’s long since passed the point of asking himself if this is the right thing to do. After he’d seen Tony fall from the sky, watched him carefully stuff Shawarma into his injured body, and avoid treatment after the battle, Steve had decided Tony needed someone. And that person is Steve. If the other man isn’t going to take care of himself, Steve is.
“With all due respect Fury, I’m going to completely ignore what you just said. Captain, I am delighted by your shiny-gold hair and facial symmetry.” He snatches Rogers’s hand, and he’s struck by just how warm the Alpha is. As an Omega, he’s always struggled with cold. It would be so lovely to wrap himself up in a blanket of muscle. He somewhat reluctantly lets Rogers go before he holds on too tight. After all, he doesn’t actually know the man. Even if he knows just about everything in his past that there is to know.
“Don’t do that again.” Steve is suddenly there, pressed into his space, cupping Tony’s jaw in his hands.
“Phase 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons. Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow.” Tony doesn’t bother glaring at the man or telling him that if Captain Icicle had been here last night instead of freezing them out, he’d have known about phase 2 already. A stubborn ass is a stubborn ass, however, and there are more important things on their plate. Like cornering Fury on this, presenting a united front, and lambasting the idiot for thinking he could lie to them about making weapons. Something that Tony is sadly an expert in.
Tony’s eyes blink open, fluttering, and refocus on Steve. They look panicked, scared, and Steve takes a shuddering breath.
“Yeah, Alcohol is a real shit show. It’s like the TLC of beverages. Hence why I drink it.” He raises his glass to the bunch of them. On accident, he meets Cap’s gaze, and locks in for a moment on the man’s eyes. They glitter with irritation, and something inscrutable.
and things. Not to mention the metal arm—an arm I designed for you, by the way.” He knows he’s whining, but Steve loves to spoil Tony, loves to give in and give Tony his every desire, and there may be a chance that Tony’s made it a habit.
He comes hard, little arcs of sensation traveling through him, his cock pulsating like a vein in Tony’s mouth. At first he casts his head back, but then realizes he can’t see his beloved trying to take all that he has to give him. And it’s a sight.
“I think I do. Let me show you what you deserve. You’re a good boy. My best boy.” Steve’s hand makes its way down and over Tony’s fly, pressing in until Tony gasps and jerks in Steve’s palm. Tony feels undone.
“I know. But I guess I just wanted to feel something good.” Tony gets out of the car then, and Steve follows. There’s a little trail of scent that drags behind Tony, and Steve floats on it to the elevator and up into the penthouse.
Tony finds himself inside of Steve, scrabbling for the grounding he lost earlier in the evening. It comes on a wave of orgasm, his hands gnarled with possessive grip in Steve’s hands as he knots his omega, his Steve.
Steve has to get him to medical, but he doesn’t know who to call or where to go. His mind is running in circles until he realizes SHIELD were the ones who helped him with the contract. They would know what to do and would keep this private.
“No I suppose it doesn’t. The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that. What have I to fear?” The other man is staring out the window now, and he looks small in his elaborate robes. He wears his wealth and class like armor against the world. Thor hadn’t mentioned what Loki had against his family, but Tony knows Daddy issues when he sees them. Loki is much like himself, if Tony had decided to be a wreck of a human being. The truth of that stretches between them like a chasm, and Tony sees a dark reflection on the other side.
. I want to fix it. I need to fix things, Steve. I’m a mechanic. It’s what I do.” A month ago, Tony wouldn’t have been so openly emotional with Steve, but things have changed. Bucky is his friend, and being around him makes Tony feel like he’s on some kind of adventure he doesn’t have the quest map to, but Steve grounds him. Steve has been there when Tony has needed him, and especially the times when Tony has pushed other people away.
Which is when things go to shit. Steve gets a hold of Tony as he tries to fly out of his grip, slams Tony to the ground and mounts him there, fists battering down onto the face plate. Each punch is accentuated by a grunt, and Tony thinks about how he once longed to hear those noises in far more pleasant circumstances.
The next morning, the front page of the paper shows a picture of Sunset and the sensationalist headline that she’d been murdered in her bed the night before. It hits him like sinking into a too-hot bath. His skin is crying out against the incursion of emotion, and it burns, it burns, it burns. Until it’s numb.
.” Steve isn’t coming back. The truth is written on his skin; he has all of the lust and need for an Omega painted on him. Bites at his neck, a bruising ache in his glands from how often Steve had sucked on them. But it’s over now, and Steve isn’t here. Tony wants to cry. He hasn’t truly cried in so long. Not since leaving Afghanistan. He doesn’t count the endless tears that Steve had twisted from him. They don’t mean a thing.
“I’ve wanted to ask, Tony, can I touch them? Please?” Steve was already in molestation range, the tips of Tony’s feathers hankering to drag themselves along Steve’s biceps and torso, to wrap themselves around Steve in a soft, plume-y hug. Just because he can’t control them, doesn’t mean he doesn’t know what their dirty little plans are.
“Steve, please, please move.” He thrusts then, hips jerking tightly to the sweet crevice of Tony’s thighs.
“Gonna to make you into something else, gonna make you this, just this, for me. Want to fill you up, make you complete and mine.”
“In his case, I understand. The best treatment would be you knotting him, but we respect his bodily autonomy.”
“Don’t do what? Throw something that could be good away? You did that already. This is what’s left. And I don’t need you constantly around me to remind me of what we never had.” Tony gestures at them as if Steve can see the lingering smear of cruelty that Steve has put into their relationship.
After, Steve is collapsed by Tony’s side, his cock tucked back into his pants. Tony is shameless next to him, only the symbiote to cover his casual nudity.
Groaning around Bucky’s cock, Tony shivers as Steve picks up the pace, grabbing Tony’s hips and tilting them so that Steve gets the angle right.
“I still think omegas should be cherished and protected, but I guess the way I do that has changed. I like to feed Tony, and I like that he’s… defiant. It looks good on him. I don’t touch him, I promise I won’t touch him anymore. I know he doesn’t really want me, like that.”
Whoever is promising this to him seems like they mean it, and Tony slumps into his person, letting go of everything.
Steve grasps Tony’s cock and starts to pump it in time with his hips that are snapping into Tony at a ferocious pace. The muscles in his channel are fighting for and against the intrusion, aching so sweetly with effort to clench on a knot. Steve hikes up Tony’s legs so that Tony’s knees are by his head, and proceeds to pull his entire length out before slamming it back in with exquisite accuracy. Tony looks down to see Steve’s slick cock as he pulls it out before it disappears once more. Steve is beautiful, his abdominal muscles clenched together with effort, his chest tight, and arms tense. His lovely face is all that Tony can see. All that Tony wants to see.
“Just keep me posted.” He’s near constantly weaving between buildings now, hoping not to get caught in any traps. The Chitauri are thankfully foolish enough to not set any, and he’s able to draw them in a neat line while he shoots random repulsor blasts behind him.
, he feels a swelling inside of him. It’s so good, tight in his channel and pressing into him deeply.
“Omega.” Cap says it like a prayer, like he’s grateful Tony is ok, after all the time they spent insulting each other. Condescending prick of an Alpha.
“Move on from what? I’m still your CEO; I’m not going anywhere Tony.” She pulls the lines of the suit straight, looking back and forth to make sure it’s all on according to the rules of Pepper.
“Here’s the letter that was meant to be for our run.” Sam hands it over, holding onto the edge of it until Tony looks up and meets his eyes. The air feels heavy around them, like this moment is important, the words carrying monumental weight. “I’m glad it’s you, Tony.”
Steve leans over to Tony first, shuffling his face in between the collar of Tony’s shirt. He smells like expensive cologne, metal, and sweat. It’s a heady combination, and Steve reflexively breathes in deep, taking it all in. His lips bud on Tony’s neck, finding the outline of the gland there before he laves it a few times. The saliva acts as an analgesic on the gland, prepping the area for a bite.
“Tony wants to be with me. And we can’t be together if he’s an Alpha. That’s consent enough to do this,” Steve insists.
“This isn’t, no, this isn’t what I want,” he mumbles. His mouth isn’t working and there’s drool freezing on the floor below his mouth.
He slams his cock in as hard as he can, delighting in the perfection of Tony’s tight flesh. The V of his hips nestles perfectly with the globes of Tony’s ass and as he looks down, he watches the slide of Tony’s rim as it tries to keep Steve’s cock inside every time he pulls out. The symbiote is gently tugging at Steve’s balls and flicking over Tony’s nipples while it undulates with suppressed energy. Trust Tony to make a suit that helps debauch its owner.
When the knot deflates, Tony slips off and crawls away to the corner again, little hiccups sprouting from his mouth as he shudders and shakes. Steve can’t stop himself this time, and he goes towards Tony, crawling carefully into his space. Tony mewls and tries to burrow into the bedding, but Steve covers Tony’s body with his own, offering protection instinctively as alphas should.
. There’s a part of him looking up to the challenge of breaking Tony in. It seems no one has done it for him before, and there’s a certain pride to think that what will come out on the other side will be as close to perfection as an omega can get with the past life Tony has led.
“For my heats?” There’s a strain in Tony’s voice, a flatness to the question that Steve doesn’t understand.
“Then you don’t know him as well as I do, Sir.” Tony’s heart is so expansive, it covers the world. The truth of Tony, is that he’s a soft thing, underbelly vulnerable against certain incursions. Like the one that Steve is about to commit to Tony.
“Tony is mine.” The look Nat gives him is calculated. Steve’s forgets all of his reservations, his concerns. He can’t help but look at this interaction between Nat and Tony and see himself as the better option. Tony will be an Omega and Steve is going to mate him as soon as the change is complete.
The other man grunts as Tony sinks his mind into the array of the left arm, twisting it to lock onto the rough surface of the Kaiju, grasping at the plated biological armor of the thing, hoping to twist off a piece or otherwise secure it in place so that Steve can activate the beam. It scrabbles at them, squeezing down on the metal plates and releasing a shrill cry of victory that’s ahead of schedule.
“Don’t you dare leave! You can’t leave me like this in here!” Tony was almost screaming, the rage palpable to everyone. The door vibrated with the impact of Tony’s fists slamming against it, each bang making Steve flinch.
It’s been a week since the thing with Steve on the couch, and Tony has been desperate to not think about it or process it at all. Bucky and Steve are still at each other’s throats, only now it seems worse than ever. Today in the field, Steve’s shield almost clipped Bucky, and there were definitely some stray bullets that went Steve’s direction that didn’t need to. Everyone on the team noticed and even Fury had called them to have a word. Which is why they weren’t here at the tower just yet.
“Listen here,” Steve says, vibrating, “you’ll repeat those vows, and you’ll do them correctly. This is embarrassing of you. Have you no shame at all?”
“Tony, I’m sorry. If you don’t want this— I’ll— I’ll leave.” Steve folded in on himself, somehow managing to look small, defeated, his scent turned sharp with disappointment.
“I’ve been better, in all honesty. I feel like every time I complain about my life to you, and you just listen. I should be a better friend.”
The salesperson comes back with a cloth that feels so soft and tough at the same time. Something sturdy with which to build the nest. Steve gets a few blankets and pillows of it in muted colors, along with the silk in pillows and blankets. They also look into the nest pads and pick out one with a firm base so that Tony can build atop it with ease.
“Do you kiss Fury’s ass with that mouth? Of the people in this room, which one is A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?” Tony hits the man where it hurts. Soldiers are one and the same. He’s had Rhodey figured out for a long time, and he uses that as a template to understand what makes Rogers tick. Little Army boys despise the insinuation that they can’t do a whit of good in the present situation.
Steve uncrosses his legs and leans forward on his knees, putting his face as close to eye level as he can without being flat on the floor himself.
“So, do you think your gift is warm and wet enough for you? Your call, Captain America.” There’s no amount of spit that will make the rounded piece of metal easy to take. Steve didn’t have time to prep himself before he came here. Not that it matters; his body is like perfect elastic, always cinching back into place after a good stretch. No matter how many times Iron Man shoves his cock, his fingers, his
It’s not winding down just yet, but they’re at a steady clip of removing the bots when he feels a sharp pain in his shoulder that’s deep. He cranes his neck around to see an arrow sticking out of his back.
Humping the empty air where the symbiote is working at his covered cock, Steve takes Tony into his mouth again and presses his lips down to the root where Tony’s wiry, coiled hair tickles his mouth. Groaning, Tony reaches down and grasps Steve’s hair, fingers flexing tightly to his scalp.
“Omegas are people! We’re living, breathing, feeling people who get to live our lives how we choose! I don’t need or want a leash, but I’m stuck with you. Why would you put us through this? I can’t be what you want me to be.” Tony holds his arms out in askance, his face taking on a begging quality that gives Steve a shiver, just thinking about Tony submitting to him. It feels like it should feel wrong, and Steve shoves the emotion away, not wanting to examine it or give it credence at all. Alphas have instincts, that’s all it is.
“You’re supposed to be Captain America, an upstanding, forward thinking alpha who always does the right thing. How is this right? How could you be so heartless?” Steve’s never seen Pepper so disheveled, and he imagines Rhodes must not have either, because the other man gets up from the bed and goes to wrap his arms around Pepper, head nestled on her shoulder.
“Fine.” Tony’s eyes roll back in his head and he slouches back up to the justice. Steve thinks they’re going to have to work on comportment as well.
“Nat, can you show Cap to his room? He’s coming up the elevator now.” She gives him that sideways glance of hers and he feels like he’s transparent under it, the things he doesn’t want her to know swimming around, exposed. “Please Nat? Pretty please with new knives on top and more widow’s bites in the middle?”
“What experience!? You never married!” Tony is yelling now, arms waving erratically, but not at Steve. So Tony has some guise of self-control.
Steve tucks his cock back in then, and says nothing. His face is a wreck, almost like it was Steve that Tony had fucked. The shield is propped up under his hand, and Steve uses it to stand. His uniform is torn to shreds, blood dripping down his face and on the slashes of his arms where Tony has torn the fabric loose.
Finally, after an agonizing half hour, the machine moves through its power down process and the locking mechanisms detach from both pilots.
It’s the right time. There will never be a better place and feeling than this, Steve thinks as he descends on Tony, Alpha teeth snicked out and waiting to strike. And strike he does, sinking into Tony’s neck, puncturing the delicious gland underneath. The scent of Tony abruptly changes, morphing into a medley of Steve and Tony. Unique, mesmerizing. Tony moans long and low, helpless. The connection tears through him with violence, like feathers beating at his brain, he feels Tony all over. The fear, the pleasure, his despair, and underneath it all, a dark and twisted desire for Steve that is pressing at the membrane of Tony’s self-control.
And what does he choose to think about? Steve, and how instinct is cruel to give him this in a way that makes a mockery of what he wanted. Steve is here because of Fury and his rut. He’s kind because Steve is always kind, except when Tony is unkind first. And he is always unkind, nowadays. But even when control is something that should be lost, Steve finds it in himself. Not like Tony, who can’t stop thinking about what it might be like, if it wasn’t just for his heat. And when it is his heat, he knows that Steve is his whole world, a warm and tender one where Steve soothes the savage energy that lives inside Tony. The thing that makes him create, destroy, self-immolate, and rise again. Steve makes that part of him pause, a reprieve from his very nature.
She finds it when Tony’s conversation partner slips away, and Sunset slots herself in place. He looks at her hands, so cruel, her nails the same red, the very same, that they were when she gripped his neck and made his world go black.
“I just– I just wanted to know.” He twists his fingers with his other hand before dropping them, and gazing back at his friend. There is nothing wrong. He’s not done anything, and he’s not going to do anything. He just wants to know.
Tony’s arm flops against the empty bed besides him. Steve’s scent has only just faded, like he had been here next to Tony moments before. The rays of light from the window leave the bed warm and toasty, but it’s not the same as Steve’s arms around him.
Then there’s the sight of the largest, most technologically advanced army he’s ever seen at the end of it all. Suspended in the sky, waiting.
Tony cries, sweeter than anything Steve has heard before, and that’s more than enough. Steve shudders, slowing his hips as he pulls in and out, knot starting to catch at Tony’s seams. Finally it seats fully in Tony, and Steve tugs at it from behind before he nestles it in deeper. Tony doesn’t need anything more, and his Omega comes solely from the stimulation of Steve’s knot. Tony’s orgasm is a gutted, wounded thing, tears streaming down his Omega’s face while he’s slack-jawed and trembling convulsively.
The cheek is a welcome break from his sappy thoughts, and Tony laughs, spying the twinkle in Bucky’s eyes. “Princess kitty needed his beauty rest and ample coffee. Besides, you’re a faithful companion. You can wait.”
“The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable.” Tony checks what Thor has said and sees that the machine is encased in a forcefield. It’s self sustaining, he suspects, and might be nigh impossible to stop. His stomach drops to the bottom of his gut. If they can’t stem the tide, there’s no way they can hold off for even another half hour while the military gets here.
Rhodey had said there were no large predators out here. Not even black bears, and those fuckers are the raccoons of the large predator world.
, through and through, taking care of the rest of the team to the best of his abilities. It shouldn’t surprise him, but even still, Steve’s thoughtfulness catches Tony off guard sometimes.
“You’re an idiot if you think I’d let him go once he’s mine. Making love isn’t the only way of caring for an omega. They need to be
“We’re cutting your caffeine intake.” Steve all but snarls. He can’t believe this is his marriage. Having a battle of wills with his omega husband over a granite countertop that cost more than his apartment in Brooklyn when he was young. He doesn’t want any of this. He’s never wanted this, and he feels a twisted sort of hate at Tony for making him have it.
Behind him, the doors swish open and clack back shut. Tony spins around in his chair to see his new favorite pal, Bucky.
“You know something.” It’s tossed out there by Nat like a grenade, and Steve has to remember to breathe, to push down the adrenaline rush.
“We both want you. We thought—well, we thought we could see who you’d pick, without telling you what we wanted. Let you choose on your own.” Bucky starts to gesture at Tony, but cuts himself off and drops his hand, before reaching back up and tugging at his ear.
“You know damn well why! Back off!” He meant to put his arm there, but it doesn’t stop the flare of instinct he has when the Alpha pushes him away. His Omega nature knows it wasn’t a good idea, but Tony can’t help himself against ass holes. He’s got to get in their hostile faces and make it
