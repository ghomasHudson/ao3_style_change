“Dean?” Jo asked suddenly. He hadn’t realized she’d asked him a question about something. Not only did he not answer, he wasn’t even sure if he’d heard the question in the first place.
“It’s… it’s okay,” Castiel assured him. “I… I appreciate your honesty, Dean. And I’m flattered by it, but, it is like you said… I am straight.”
The rest of the shift slowly ticked by, and eventually Castiel waved goodbye to Gabe and his parents, hung up his apron, and made the drive home.
“You’re starting to scare me, here, Winchester. What’s going on?”
Castiel huffed, falling back onto Charlie’s bed. “I don’t know, Charlie! I just… I’m straight! Aren’t I? That’s like… the default? How would I even know that I’m not?”
For the first time in a while, Dean slept somewhat peacefully.
Castiel didn’t look convinced. “Dean…” Castiel reached out and rested a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “You know you can talk to me about anything. You don’t have to hide anything from me.”
“I’m really sorry, Cassie. I’m sorry I couldn’t see how much she was hurting you. I just wanted you to be happy, and I thought Hannah was the person who could give you that.” The apologetic smile on her face was immediately wiped away by an onslaught of tears. “I couldn’t have been any more wrong if I tried.”
Jo shook her head. “Why didn’t you just tell me at the dance that your feelings had changed?”
Dean had attempted to help clean up after dinner, but Castiel’s parents kindly refused. So, he opted to head upstairs and pack up his things and slip his shoes on before waiting awkwardly in the living room for the ride home that Castiel’s father had kindly offered. And by offered, Dean means that Castiel’s father would not take no as an acceptable answer.
Castiel simply placed a hand on Dean’s knee, and the words stopped spilling from his lips.
The two spend the next 15 minutes picking up pots and pans and sweeping dough and sugar off of the floor.
“Lord have mercy on me…” Castiel muttered, falling back on Charlie’s bed.
She kissed the top of his head and continued to rock the two of them. After several more minutes, Dean’s sobs had devolved into occasional sniffles. He eventually pushed himself off of her and rubbed at his eyes, now puffy and red from tears. He looked up at his mom to see that her own eyes were slightly red with shed tears, but they exchanged soft, loving smiles.
“Nope. I’m just tired.”
“Jo Harvelle, huh?” Castiel said softly, laughing when Dean’s gaze whipped back to meet his own, blushing furiously.
“Oh, that’s my mom. Gotta go help out at the bar tonight. I’ll see you later!”
Castiel grunted something unintelligible as he shoved the rest of his books into his locker. Dean reached out and attempted to grab his shoulder, but as soon as Castiel caught his movement out of the corner of his eye he jumped back like he’d been burned.
Castiel snorted. “Dean, be serious. They could never.”
do it,” he muttered to himself, walking away from the Novak household.
“Remember, Cassie,” she whispered against his lips. “No Dean Winchester if you know what’s good for you.”

“I’m sorry, Cas,” he said, pulling him into a tight hug. “I promise I’ll be back before you know it.”
The afternoon slowly crawled away from them as they played games together. It had been so long since Castiel had had quality time with Gabe like this and he missed it more than he wanted to admit. Gabe had always been so easy to talk to, and he always felt safe with him.
The line went quiet, but only for a moment.
“Alright, then. Interrogation time,” she started, turning towards Castiel with a
His last thought was of Castiel’s face plastered with a wide smile, his eyes bright and full of love. He hoped beyond all hopes that someday, maybe Castiel would look at him like that.
Before Castiel or Charlie could ask him anymore questions, he turned around and stormed off. Hidden behind the end of the lockers, Dean overheard the whole conversation.
reason I’m doing this is because I know how much Cas has missed you. And I’m hoping rekindling your friendship will put some of the light back into his eyes. I’ve missed seeing that… but maybe the person who put the flame out can bring it back.”
“Cas,” he muttered. The desperation in Castiel’s voice broke him. But before Dean could say anything else, Castiel pushed past him and ran for the parking lot. Hannah watched this unfold from further in the crowd of students leaving the school. She smirked.
“If it’s serious enough, make sure it’s the police who are the first ones to know, not us,” Gabe muttered.
“Stay out of trouble, Winchester,” she joked, her voice cracking slightly from tears that still wanted to fall. “I’ll see you later.”
“There’s this new kid in my Media Tech class. His name is Dean, and he looks just like that! Do you think it’s him?”
“You don’t really think she’d do anything bad to him… in front of people, right?” Dean asked, his voice timid. Gabe shrugged.
“I am, actually,” he confirms.  That fight last month had shaken him more than he cared to admit.  It was just a fight, but he’s had a few nightmares in the last couple of weeks in which a break up features prominently.  “The holiday party might be a great way to spring it on him, wouldn’t you say?”
“Is it really that early?”  Dean holds up his wrist towards Cas and taps his smartwatch.  6:09 am pops up on the face before going black again.  Cas’ cheeks again turn pink.
“How lucky for me,” Dean replies.  Instead of the confusion, derision or outright hatred Cas was expecting, Dean actually seems delighted by the fact that Cas is an unmated omega with a daughter to raise.  How is this man even real?  “So Emma, how do you feel about hot chocolate?  There’s a café close by that serves the best.”  And now he wants to take Emma out for hot chocolate?  Is he going to invite Cas too?
“Hey, hey, hey,” Dean soothed, “I’ll help, okay?  I may not have a fancy degree in event hosting, but I’ve put on enough of these things that I think it’ll turn out okay.  I promise, it will all be okay.”
He hurried out to his car and took off towards the Winchester ranch.  He drove the fifteen minutes in a daze, not really remembering the turns and stops.  When he pulled up outside the house he saw Dean’s car sitting outside the garage and the lights to his apartment were all on.  With trepidation Cas started to climb the stairs leading to Dean’s front door.
“Hey, Cas.  It’s nice to meet you.”  Dean smiled again.  Cas noticed that it made his eyes crinkle at the sides.  It made his stomach flutter unexpectedly.  Cas smiled back but couldn’t bring himself to say anything for fear of looking like an even bigger idiot.
“What? No, Sammy, I wouldn’t do that.”
“That is nothing you should be admitting to, Dean.  You know I always tell you to read those contracts when I send them to you,” she admonished.
“I, uh, couldn’t sleep last night.  I guess I was up early and thought I would get a head start on my chores for today.”
First, the rooster.  Like, what the hell?  It’s an orchard, not a farm or petting zoo.  Why is there a rooster allowed to crow at 6 freaking o’clock in the morning?
This is another chapter I'm splitting in half, otherwise it'd be pretty long with the added scenes.  Also I really wanted to get something out by Christmas, so here this is.
Killing her would be simple, and it would solve some problems later. But Cas wants the occultum, he wants her knife, and he knows she was a valuable resource to the boys, even if she was acting out of ulterior motives. “I'll let you live if you can do one thing for us.”
Bela pops from around the corner.   Figures she was hiding where it was safe.  “I'm coming with you. I need to see if this thing works.”
“You gonna tell me why? I know you haven't told us everything.”
Dean closes his eyes and leans his head back against the wall. “Sam.”
“Because you could be more useful to us alive.” Castiel walks closer to her. “Things won't end well for you. I've seen how they end; with you dead, trapped in the Empty reliving your mistakes forever. I can spare you that future, if you help us now.”
“In my timeline you stabbed me on our first meeting.”
“Killing Lilith is the final seal, but it shouldn't matter if you never break the first one,” Cas says. “In my time, Sam kills Lilith and causes Lucifer to walk free, due to manipulation from Ruby.”
“What?” Ruby says, sounding desperate. Cas knows that as soon as he lets her go, she'll report back to Lilith, tell them everything. Soon Lilith will know they're after her. He finds he doesn't mind. Sam and Dean have defeated God; what is one demon to them, even one as powerful as Lilith?
“I don't know what you're smiling about,” Dean says, pointing to the devil's trap “You're not going anywhere.”
Sam looks confused. “Okay, but I've only seen her once.”
Sam and Dean have to go deal with something involving a storage locker and their father, so Cas makes his way to Crowley's alone. It's fine, he doesn't need Sam and Dean there to do business with Crowley. He's worked with Crowley before, though he doesn't like to remember how he betrayed Sam and Dean. It's all in the past now. His Sam and Dean have long since forgiven him, and he doesn't plan on betraying this Sam and Dean.
Bela lets out a wry chuckle. “How do they decide who gets into Heaven?”
Both boys look at her, unsure of what to do. Cas considers trying to reason with her, but humans can be most unreasonable when it comes to money. Putting her to sleep is an option, but that hardly seems the way to start a business relationship. He still has telekinesis at this power level; he could just knock the gun from her hand, but there's the risk she'll pull the trigger.
“Probably,” Dean says and he looks away from Cas, swallows. “But it's good to know someone else has his back.”
“She can do that?” Sam asks.
“Not if she's dead.”
Crowley shrugs. “I am king of the crossroads. The contract will belong to me.”
Castiel had been spending a quiet Thursday night working at the Roadhouse when Dean Winchester had first sauntered into the bar.  He’d noticed the man hovering inside the door with a smile on his face.  He looked like he fit in around Blue Falls with his dusty jeans, plaid button-down shirt rolled up past his elbows and dark work boots looking like they had walked a million miles.  He didn’t wear a hat like many of the ranchers around the area and Cas could tell that his face had tanned a little from exposure to the sun.  This man was gorgeous.  And probably straight as most of the cowboys that came into the Roadhouse were these days.  Castiel didn’t like to assume because even though Blue Falls was about as progressive an area as Texas got these days he’d been subjected to some pretty nasty language his first few weeks as a server due to trying out his rusty flirting skills.  It hadn’t taken him long to perfect the “polite interest” persona when anyone, male or female, came into the bar.  Cas had to remind himself that this was probably a good thing given the beating his personal life had taken upon leaving Chicago last year.  He’d lost faith in himself and his ability to know a good situation.  His brother, Gabriel, had assured him that he would gain confidence with time but he was still so insecure.  He sighed and pushed the bad memories away as he turned to walk over and offer to seat the man, but then he heard a screech from behind him and he stopped in his tracks.
“Mama says I look like my auntie Anna but I’m going to have freckles and auntie Anna doesn’t have freckles not like you have freckles.”  Emma touches her little fingers to Dean’s cheekbone where he knows he has a light dusting of freckles.  Dean turns back to Castiel and smiles.  Castiel still looks flustered but smells more surprised nervous then unhappy nervous.  Dean takes this as a good sign.
Castiel was visibly upset.  He wanted Dean to be as upset about this as he was.  His arms were now wrapped around himself.  “Listen, I get it.  I really do.  You have this public persona thing going on where you play the charming, rugged, down-to-earth cowboy.  You are used to the spotlight and you have fans.  You and Lisa have a history.  But where does that persona end and the real Dean begin?  Where do the feelings for Lisa end and the feelings for me begin? I’m not sure now if I’ve seen the real you yet, Dean.  Every time I think I get a glance at him, something happens and we’re right back where we started.”  At this Dean rose and walked towards Cas.  He stopped just out of arms reach.
And finally, did Cas really have to start the tractor as soon as the sun climbed over the hills?  On a weekend?
“They’re good.  Between my current caseload and the holiday party, I’ve been spending more time at the office than I would like, but your brother is his usual supportive self.”
“Cas, listen.  Jillian had a real crappy day and we all ended group today in tears.  Someone suggested drinking at the Roadhouse. I agreed to be a designated driver, that’s it.  I don’t need anyone reminding me of how Claire’s mom died to know that drinking and driving is a bad idea.  I was helping some people out, that’s all.”
“Charlie could have told your Secret Santa. Um, everyone in school knows that she’s one of your best friends, right?”
“I would call it jealousy, but since I’ve not met Cas yet, I don’t know if that’s accurate.”
The My Little Pony DVD is playing the menu music on a loop.  Dean’s breathing is deep and regular while his daughter is emitting tiny little snores every so often.  He sees the plastic cup with just a thin layer of syrup still in the bottom on the table next to the recliner.  If he hadn’t already calmed down in the kitchen, the adorable picture they make asleep in the chair would have done the job.
Dean and Sam continued their discussion through a dinner of bacon cheeseburgers, a slice of Ellen’s pecan pie, and another couple of pints.  Castiel made a few more rounds before the Roadhouse cleared out almost completely.  It was close to midnight but the two men didn’t appear to notice until Cas wandered over.  He cleared his throat and tried not to melt under the gaze of the two in the booth.
“Of course I do, Cas.  You’re brilliant, sexy, kind and you’re obviously a family guy.  I think you are exactly what I’ve been waiting for.  And Emma is like a mini version of you.  She’s smart, engaging and obviously very affectionate,” he says as he runs his hand over her hair and down her back.  Emma seems to be ignoring the two grown-ups as she continues to color.  Cas thinks she looks just as at home on Dean’s lap as she does on his.  “I think this is the perfect time to ask if you’re up for another date,” Dean pleads.  Dean looks shyly at their hands still joined on top of the table.  It is strange to see him as anything other than cool and confident.  Frankly it is quite adorable to see the normally composed alpha as anxious as Cas himself has felt.  “Just you and me this time?  That new Marvel movie is coming out this weekend.  We could go out to that new diner by the mall before the late showing.”
“Well, he’s getting more and more vocal every day.  Thankfully he still doesn’t use ‘no’ any more than necessary.  I’ve heard the horror stories.”
“Mama says I look like my auntie Anna but I’m going to have freckles and auntie Anna doesn’t have freckles not like you have freckles.”  Emma reaches her fingers towards Dean’s face and Cas wants to grab her hand and chide her for touching strangers.  Dean doesn’t seem to mind, though, and Castiel is fascinated by the way this alpha is reacting to his little girl.  He seems smitten with her, which gives Cas all sorts of ideas that he should not be entertaining.
“Hey, you wanna go to my place and make out?” Dean whispered in Cas’ hear.  Cas giggled.  He was pretty sure the entire Winchester family would realize what was happening if Dean and Cas suddenly disappeared and were seen heading up the stairs to Dean’s apartment over the garage.  Just the suggestion made him feel better.  Although the talk of Chicago had made his insecurities rear their ugly heads again, Dean had made them mostly go away with his tease.  It may have only been three weeks but Cas was pretty sure he was falling in love with Dean Winchester.  Now if Dean would only fall in love with him back.
Cas needed to take it slow.  He was so close to letting Dean take it all the way.  Maybe after this weekend they could see what happened.  For the moment, Cas was focused on trying to relax and let his body drift off to sleep.
“Yeah, they just walked out about 5 minutes ago.  They were going to head for Dean’s place to finish talking.”  She was too busy grabbing plates ready to go out to notice the look on Cas’ face upon hearing this news.
Cas might come from a family with money but Dean comes from a single family and will need all the scholarship help he can get in order to pay for college. Dean’s proud to work part-time on the weekends for his Uncle Bobby to save money for himself once he gets to college. Heck, without Cas’ help Dean wouldn’t even be going to college. He’s the one that helped Dean find and fill out all those scholarship applications. Charlie helped, of course, but without Cas pushing Dean to keep submitting them, he wouldn’t be in a place to even accept the offers he received.
“Yes, anyway. We were talking about the second Secret Santa gifts.” Cas clears his throat, bringing Dean back to the issue at hand.
As Dean continues to hear the tractor make its rounds on the large patch of grass behind the farmhouse, he grits his teeth and thinks that Cas has to be done soon.  Cas will be finished and then he’ll turn off the tractor and Dean can go back to his own thoughts without the benefit of the buzz from the engine in his head.  It takes 20 minutes of hearing the tractor for Dean to lose his temper and storm out the door and down the steps.  The first thing that vaguely registers in his mind is that it is cold outside.  He glances down to see that he’s only wearing a grey pair of sweatpants he dragged on when he got out of bed and the tags around his neck that he hasn’t gotten comfortable with removing just yet.  He realizes that he didn’t even put his sliders on when he hops down off of the last step on to gravel and has to bite back a curse when a rock lands in that soft spot between his first two toes.  He’s been trying so hard not to curse because he wants to be a good example for Claire.  She does not need to be sharing his bad language with the other kids in preschool.  Cas wouldn’t let him hear the end of it if that were the case.
Cas had called him a few days earlier asking if they could reschedule their regular Saturday date.  Emma brought home a fall bug from daycare and she and Cas had sounded stuffed up.  Dean’s Alpha decided without his conscious thought that he would turn their normal Saturday play time into “take care of his pack” time.
Cas was in a daze as he walked back to the kitchen.  He exchanged his serving apron for his wine-colored hoodie.  It was too warm this time of year to be wearing his trench coat.  He wasn’t even sure why he brought the coat from Chicago except he’d been wearing it when he left his apartment and his life with Uriel.  It was a survivor.  Cas thought of himself as a survivor sometimes too.  Now if only he survived the date with Dean later that week.
“Cas, what are you doing here?  I thought your shift didn’t end until midnight?”  Dean sounded happy to see him but if that was the case why hadn’t he moved away from Lisa?
“Nope, my teacher wants us to write a letter to Santa.  She wants us to ask for special things. But I don’t know what that means.”
“Well, uh, maybe they overheard you talking about those kits when we got back home. I’m sure the whole wrestling team knows you almost spent your entire ComicCon budget on one of those.” Dean thinks back to the late summer training camps he had with the wrestling team. His teammates know about a lot of his interests, but it isn’t something they all stand around and discuss when they are lifting weights or watching each other drill.
“Why do I feel as though the time is right now?” Dean’s voice is quiet but the words echo in Cas’ ears along with his heartbeat, which seems to have sped up with Dean’s admission.  Is he really saying what Cas thinks he is saying?  “I’m saying I want to see where this goes, Cas.”  Castiel blinks in shock; he may have said that last part out loud.
“You were flirting with her, Dean.”  Cas stood in front of the cowboy with his arms crossed and his lips pressed into a thin line.  “It’s obvious that you still have feelings for her.”
“I guess it’s a good thing you are on clean up duty today.”  Cas is a little stiff in his responses. He’s not smiling as readily as he has this past week.  Yep, disappointed for sure.
Dean scans the letter template.  It’s definitely different from what he did when he and Sam were in school.  He can’t actually remember filling out something like this all those years ago.  Maybe they were just given a blank piece of paper and told to go to town.
Emma must get tired of hiding because she soon crawls out from behind the couch and into Dean’s lap.  He immediately cuddles with her as her thumb goes to her mouth and her eyes drift to the TV where My Little Pony is still playing softly in the background.  She must not notices when Cas comes back into the living room because she starts when he picks her up and starts walking into the kitchen.
“We are going on a date.  I’m going to take you out Saturday night.”  Cas was floored.  This man was good-looking and successful.  Why did he need to ask plain ol’ Castiel out on a date?
He calls Cas’ sister Anna to see if she’ll come watch Claire at the house tomorrow night so that Cas can have some time with Dean.  He ends up having to tell Anna what he’s got planned. He hears Anna’s laughter ringing in his ear long after his call with her has ended.
Cas had been hoping to have a few moments alone with Dean but the way he stuck to Lisa’s side the whole time Cas had been standing there was upsetting.  He looked away and blinked back tears.  It was stupid to cry, he knew, but it felt as though Dean had been keeping this from him.  “I’m sorry, Dean.  I have to get back to work.” Cas turned and quickly made his way back to the kitchen.  He thought he might have heard Dean call his name but no one appeared to try and stop him from leaving.  He pushed through the kitchen door and stopped just inside.  Leaning up against the wall, he took a few deep breaths and tried to get himself under control.  How was he ever going to finish his shift with all these emotions swirling through him?  He shook his head and closed his eyes.  When he opened them a few minutes later, Jo was coming through the door.  She stopped and appeared to look Cas over.
Then came the mental attraction.  Not only was Cas spectacular to look at but Dean found himself laughing at Cas’ dry humor and melting at his compassion for the kids going through tough times.  It had been the little things that got Dean to thinking that maybe he was becoming more than friendly with Cas.  First, Cas is very sweet and good with his foster kids.  That isn’t enough of a reason but it’s also not a deterrent.  If he’s going to be a proper parent to Claire, he needs a partner that can truly help him raise his daughter.  He’s seen how Cas is with the other kids that cycle through the orchard.  It’s a patience thing, Dean thinks, and it’s something he’s still working on.  Claire is a delight most days but she’s also a child who is testing her boundaries with Cas, who has only been a parental figure for a year, and Dean, who has been her father for just about six months.  Dean had to learn quickly that he’s not allowed to run away from a three-year-old when she starts getting cranky.  Cas had laughed behind his hand when Dean had just stood there watching Claire have a meltdown when she was told that she could not go out and splash in puddles because Dean didn’t want to clean her up afterwards.
“Yeah, I know.  Bobby reminds me every time he comes out to the ranch for something.”  Cas noticed that Dean hadn’t taken his eyes from him the entire conversation.  And he had that smile again that made his eyes crinkle.  It made Cas nervous.  Why was Dean looking at him like that?
A rooster crowing is not the weirdest thing Dean has ever heard first thing in the morning, but it sure ranks in the top 5 of most annoying.  Wishing he could just reach out from his nest of blankets and shut the rooster off like an alarm, he pulls the covers down past his face and rolls sluggishly towards the nightstand.
Dean hadn’t sent him a text all day and Cas was kind of missing the man.  They hadn’t gone an entire day without some form of communication since that first date.  It was making him a little short with the other servers.  Ellen had commented on his attitude and Cas just brushed it off at being stressed at the number of people at the Roadhouse that night.  Cas hadn’t expected Dean to come in so was surprised when Jo mentioned seeing Dean and his manager in one of the corner booths.
“I’m good, man.  It’s been a while.”
“Did you see Dean and Lisa leave?” Cas asked, out of breath.
“You shifty sonuvabitch,”  Dean sniffs, helping Cas put the ring on his finger.  “How long have you been planning this?” Dean is obviously trying not to cry.  His eyes are red and ever sniffle that Cas hears makes him want to break down. He takes a deep breath and gives Dean a watery smile.
“For those of you who haven’t been introduced, this is Dean Winchester.  He’s responsible for putting together the entire party from start to finish.  In fact, the only thing that I can take credit for is hiring him in the first place.”  Once again, polite laughter follows this pronouncement as well as some applause. The butterflies in Cas’ stomach have now taken up a game of dodge-ball, but he’s determined to get through this next part with all the confidence he can muster.
Cas cautiously sat up, waiting for a moment to let the nausea pass before standing up and shuffling to the bathroom to grab his migraine pills.  While there he wet a washcloth to put over his eyes. Shuffling back to the bed, he threw back the pills before washing them down with water.  He took a deep breath and put the washcloth on his face.  He was so very grateful that Dean seemed to go with the flow when it came to Cas.  Except for the barbecue on Sunday, Dean had already let Cas pick all the places they went on their dates.  He hadn’t pushed Cas to get more physical with their relationship.  They’d had some very nice make out sessions in the back of Dean’s car.  But Dean seemed to understand that
“You thinking about proposing to my brother, Cas?”  Sam has lowered his voice for which Cas is thankful as he wouldn’t want to ruin the surprise.
“Yeah, sorry.  I skipped lunch today and that coffee cake muffin was calling my name.  I couldn’t very well order something for me to eat and neglect my dates,” he winks at Cas as he adds that last bit.  Every time Dean winks Cas can feel his face heat just a little.  Dean obviously has a flirty personality.  He is also extremely good looking as evidenced by the heads turning as they arrived at the café.  Cas is baffled as to why that doesn’t bother him.  In the past he has avoided overly flirty people because he felt like it drew the wrong kind of attention.  Dean manages to make his flirtatious nature inviting instead of off-putting.
“Hey Sammy, you busy?”
It takes him a few moments to realize that the alpha is still standing next to him, elbow propped against the counter.  Castiel has heard all sorts of horror stories about what could happen to children who were taken by unscrupulous alphas or desperate omegas.  He takes a deep breath and turns to the man.  For a moment Castiel is speechless.  He didn’t notice before but the man is gorgeous.  He has kind, hazel-green eyes and a wide, genuine smile.  Thankfully his mouth isn’t as paralyzed as his brain because before he realizes it he is speaking.
“Uhhhh, why doesn’t he know, buttercup?”
“Same, man.  Claire seems to be pretty easy going.  She doesn’t really use that word either.  But I think that’s more a Cas thing than a Claire thing.”
“Yeah, yeah.  Anyway, we’ve got the business out of the way and were just catching up on the personal stuff when you wandered over.  You have a few more minutes for a break?”  Dean waved at the other side of the booth, vacant since Lisa was sitting next to Dean and didn’t look like she wanted to move to the other side of the table.
to care about your friends and all that jazz.”
Enjoy the update :)
“He totally recognized you, Cas,” Charlie said, excitedly whispering again. “It’s your Dean!”
Dean watched the screen in anticipation, not even sure why he was so anxious. He was going to respond eventually. Hannah didn’t control him anymore, and he wasn’t moving across the country again.
to hurt him, I’ll have your head. The
Dean fell onto his bed and it wasn’t until then that he realized how exhausted he was… would it really be that bad if he went to bed at 8:30? He answered his own question by passing out within 10 minutes of changing into his pajamas and collapsing back into bed.
“Well, you’re the
Castiel tried to insist on helping to clean up after breakfast, but Dean’s mother heard nothing of it. She enlisted in Sam’s help, much to his dissatisfaction as the next episode of his cartoon had just started.
Dean looked at the other two nervously. “Um, I’m Dean. I too enjoy vine references, and I, um… I’m also bisexual.”
When Dean pulled away, his face immediately fell. He moved away so he wasn’t so close to Castiel and started stumbling through words when Castiel had no discernible reaction.
I know it's short, but I promise there is more coming! I'm so glad I started working with this story again. I've always wanted to publish the angsty teenage story I never lived myself, lol.
Castiel fumbled in his pocket for his keys before pulling them out and put them in the ignition. “I’m fine, I’ve just had a long day.” Castiel started the car and started maneuvering his way out of the parking spot and out of the school parking lot. Once they were out on the main road, Castiel told Gabe everything that happened.
Jo sat down next to him, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
Castiel looked at her confused but stood up. “Uh, yeah, sure.”
Cas grinned at him before running back downstairs. He was just in time for the door bell to ring. He ran to the door and threw it open to see Dean and his parents, holding a very tiny Sam in their hands. Castiel’s mom came to the door behind him and smiled.
He literally had the world’s most awesome date in front of him right now, and all he could think about what his friend. He couldn’t be more of a dick if he tried.
Dean was silent. He reached up to rub the back of his head.
Dean snorts at this.  The pup doesn’t want peanut butter; Jess wants peanut butter.  And Sam doesn’t say no to Jess.  As his omega sister-in-law gets closer to her due date Sam doesn’t stray far from her side either, it seems.  Hence Dean’s impromptu trip to the grocery store for peanut butter.
“Well, do you want to do it now so you can surprise mama when he gets home?”
The sound of a gun cocking fills the air of the cemetery. Dean turns around and Bela is standing with her gun drawn. “I think you'll find that belongs to me. Or you know, whatever.”
He reaches out to grip Cas by the arm when he walks past him toward the rubble. “The demon chick, she ah, said me and Sam are famous with the demons. That true with the angels?”
Bela crosses her arms over her chest and sits on the edge of the bed. It makes her look small, more frail. “Bad people go to Hell.”
That's a bit of a loaded question that would take several minutes to answer. Cas decides to keep it simple. “It's complicated.”
Cas walks in the door, but something is off. He's not wearing his usual trench-coat, for one. He never goes anywhere without that ugly ass thing. But damn, he still looks good. He's not even wearing anything fancy, just jeans, a green tee shirt and a burgundy hoodie. Dean's actually pretty sure that's his hoodie that Cas stole from him not long after they first started dating. It's nice to see he still has it, like maybe he's still okay with being tied to Dean.
Meg bumps her shoulder into his. “Hey, you got this. And I'll be out here waiting. We'll go get plastered and find you some cute rebound guy.”
Jack had two weeks off from school for Christmas. Counting the weekend, he'd be home a total of 17 days. That was seventeen days to convince Cas to stay. Some of those days would be spent at his mom's, with the rest of the family, but considering how Cas's own family treated him, that could add points in his favor. Cas liked his family, liked being a part of it. And they all loved him. Sam and Eileen, and Mary and all the family that wasn't blood but family none the same.
Sam looks unsure for a second. Castiel understands; he doesn't truly know him yet, but it still stings. His Sam's trust in him would be unwavering. “As soon as we're back with Dean you'll have your answers. To anything you ask. But I do warn you, there are things you may not want to know.”
It's what Crowley implied, but Cas doesn't know for sure. Crowley likes his loopholes. “I believe so.”
“Say goodbye, rascally rabbit.”
Dean stares at him for a second, then comes to sit next to him. He's close enough that their arms brush together. “Tell me what?”
“I brought Bobby and Bela. They're outside. They're scouting for others.”
Cas could say a lot of things here.  He could say they weren't meant to intervene.  He could say he had his orders and they weren't to help.  He goes with the truth.  "I didn't care, until you.  You made me care, Dean.  Because you cared, I cared.  You taught me what it means to be human."
“What does that have to do with Bela?”
“Bela Talbot?”
The door opens and Dean steps in with his gun at the ready. He sees Cas and sees the two hunters on the ground. “They dead?”
Castiel doesn't know how much he can explain without getting into the whole apocalypse of it all. He isn't sure Sam and Dean are ready for that. “To manipulate you. She'll offer a way to help Dean, but she's lying.”
Bela's face twists wit fury. “Leave it, Castiel. Your kind never gave a damn before. All those nights I prayed for someone up there to come save me and none of you lifted a finger.”
Sam looks ready to argue, but he holds back. Instead he just picks up the phone and calls Ruby. Cas doesn't bother listening to what he says to get Ruby over—it doesn't matter, she'll come regardless. She's playing a dangerous game with Sam, but her position does make her somewhat useful. If they can convince her to join them, she'd be a powerful ally. It's unlikely to happen, but Castiel doesn't like the idea of killing her outright. At the very least, she proves useful in the future. It would be beneficial to keep her alive until she hides the occultum, in case they need to use it.
Cas wants to explain that he had orders at the time and that he was merely following them, but Dean made him doubt. Though he supposes it's too soon for that. So what he says is “Because God is a dick.”
The room is nicer than the sort Sam and Dean usually get, but not by much. Sioux Falls isn't exactly a tourist hot spot. The thick carpet is a dark brown and the walls a bland beige, the king size bed covered in a floral comforter. The whole thing seems below Bela's normal comfort level.
Dean lumbers over clutching a cup of coffee to sit next to Cas on the couch, close enough that their knees touch. Cas has gotten somewhat better at personal space over the years, so he realizes this is a violation of his, but he doesn't mind. “How long they been going at it?”
“You're overlooking the part where Lilith flays me alive for betraying her, and not in the fun way.”
Crowley sighs and makes himself more comfortable in his chair. “Not many angels come calling. What do you want?”
Bela slams the door on the way out. Sam almost feels guilty. Almost.
She sounds happy, more happy than Sam has heard her before. It's a genuine sort of happiness, and it makes him feel sick. He turns to look at her with a stormy expression. “I also killed a person.”
Cas isn't sure what to say. That it was nothing? That seems wrong. “I'm here to help.”
“Kill Lilith?” Bela says with something close to a snort. “You think you can kill Lilith?”
He really dislikes this demon. He tries again, but it's not working. “Nice try, but I think you just ordered a pizza. Should have paid more attention in Latin class.”
He tries, but he can't remember the words right. “Having a little trouble there, sport?”
Ruby darts her eyes around like a cornered animal. There's nowhere for her to run, nowhere to escape. Sam has the holy water in his hand and Cas doesn't need to be near her to wreck her. “What do you want?”
That's when Dean notices the manila folder in Cas' hand. “What's that?”
Bobby nods. “You just make sure you treat him right, or I'll find a way to kill an angel, ya hear?”
He wants to protect him, Cas knows. It's the same reason he hadn't wanted to tell them. But the boys hiding things from each other never ends well. “Dean, hiding things from Sam usually ends poorly.”
Cas talks to the boys about Ruby
Cas steps closer and places a hand on Dean, on the same place his mark once rested. “Then I promise you I will look after Sam.”
“He died?”
“They were abusive?”
Sam prays for Cas to come over before he calls Ruby. He's already spoken to her, but he hadn't called Cas because they were in a public diner. He wasn't sure how Ruby would react to seeing an angel, and he didn't want her smoking out in front of a room of witnesses. Cas understands that, but he wishes Sam called anyway. Ruby has already gotten under his skin. He's asking questions about his mother's friends, asking why they are all dead.
Castiel knows that Sam would have survived, because he already did. Unless he's already changed the timeline so much he could not. Time travel is a difficult thing. He's very glad Sam and Dean haven't asked about it. If so he'll tell them human minds cannot comprehend the physics behind it, which is true, but also he doesn't entirely understand it himself. “You had the rabbit's foot. You would have saved him.”
Dean turns to him with blazing eyes, as intense as he's ever seen him. “This thing with Lilith goes sideways, I need you to keep an eye on Sam. Keep him safe after I'm gone.”
“Friends of Gordon.”
“In a year I'll pull Dean from Hell,” Cas says.
Cas can't tell if she's being sarcastic or not. She brushes past him and strides inside. “Love what you've done to the place.”
“It worked,” Bela says smugly. “I knew I could fix it. Let's go tell Bobby the good news.”
“What do you think I'll do to you if you refuse?”
“Yes.”
“Yeah, but you're an angel. Aren't they your family? Or isn't there some lady angel or something?”
“That isn't going to work.”
“Sent her back to Hell,” Dean says, then jerks his head, “Well, he did.”
Cas almost wants to go with Sam and Dean, or just go and deal with the problem himself. He knows this is where Dean reunites with Lisa again, where he lights a spark that leads him back to her after Sam's death. It isn't selfish, or not entirely, he knows things won't work out with her and he'd rather spare Dean that pain. It's not his place, however. Besides, if they stop Dean going to Hell and avert the apocalypse, Dean may have a real chance with her. Maybe that's what he wants. It's not what's right for his Dean, but this Dean isn't his Dean yet. Perhaps he can still make things work.
No, he isn't.  And for the first time, Cas wonders if that's what he wants.
It makes Cas feel warm that Dean cares he was shot. But this isn't the time to linger on the feeling. He has Bela to deal with. “I'm an angel.”
“The queen of Hell.”
“You'd have to speak to Crowley.”
Bela holds her ground, her and Crowley staring at each other for a long moment. “Fine,” Bela grits out. “What do I have to lose?”
Dean relaxes minutely. “Right.”
The door opens and Dean walks in, carrying a bag of burgers and fries. He pauses when he sees Cas there. He seems mildly embarrassed. Cas wonders if he's remembering the dream he had last night. “Cas?”
“How is that a good thing?”
Cas can feel Dean's eyes on him as well, but he doesn't want to look and see what's there. He isn't prepared for it, whatever it is. “They'll find new vessels soon. We should regroup and be ready for an attack.”
“Yes, they can. Most angels don't, do some of us do.” He would, of course, if Dean wanted. Not before, with Jimmy Novak sharing this body, when this body wasn't
“So, this human, why aren't you trying to get back to her?”
It's the Father's idea to tag along, but Sam doesn't like it. Exposing a holy man to their line of work seems like it would cause some bad karma. Plus, the Father seems like a nice guy.
“I got eyes, son. I see how you look at him.”
Cas feels tired, weary down to his bones. “I rebelled against Heaven for you Dean, I don't deserve your anger.”
It's cold out and Cas can see Meg's breath as she talks. The street lights gleam down on them and shine off her dark hair, giving it a halo like effect. But Cas knows she's no angel—a heartless bitch, that's what Dean had always called her. Not that that's entirely true either, Meg cares well enough about things she thinks matter, those things are just few and far in between. The one thing she does think matters, more than anything else, is Castiel. It's an odd friendship made of opposites, and not one many people truly understand.
“No, it's a lot to take in at once. I wanted to spare them.”
It takes another four hours of Sam, Dean, and Bobby periodically asking him questions and attempting different exorcisms on him before they believe he is an angel. Bobby apparently found some lore that mentions them, so they believe angels exist, though they don't know whether to trust him.
“I've fought in many battles against many enemies. He didn't survive,” Cas says. “It's still one of the things I feel the most guilt over.”
“So if we wanna go check these omens in Ohio...” Dean starts, “you think you can have that thing ready by this afternoon?”
“Not all of us are.”
Inside the house, Cas and Dean are emerging from the rubble that Cas has cleared. Dean is carrying the passed out girl. The Father sees her and snarls “What did you do to her?”
“No cage, no apocalypse,” says Dean. “So how do we kill her?”
Bela's smile fades. “Tell a lie enough and you believe it's true.” She rolls back over on her back and closes her eyes. “Like you hiding your feelings from Dean.”
It's another in a string of near identical motel rooms that Sam and Dean frequent. Though this one seems to have recently been on fire, fron the lingering smell in the air. Sam isn't alone, two other men, hunters from the looks of it are with him, one speaking “...but as it turns out, I'm on a mission from God.”
Heaven should have stepped in and saved so many.
Cas can feel Dean's gaze on him. He glances over and sees Dean looking at the hand on Bela's shoulder. Cas lets it drop. “I can take you to Bobby's now. He's been working on the Colt.”
, his inner voice reminds him) alpha waiting in line to buy them coffee and hot chocolate.  Dean had steered Cas and Emma towards a corner booth when they entered and didn’t take no for an answer when Cas insisted on paying for their own drinks.  That’s not how a date works, Cas.  Dean had smirked at him and then turned towards the counter.  Cas could only sigh and lead his daughter to the table.  Looking at Dean standing at the counter and pointing to different items on the menu board Cas wonders if anyone will believe him tomorrow at work when he tells them about the events of this afternoon.
“Cas, you okay?  You look like you got hit by a truck.”  She walked over to him looking like she was ready to catch him should he fall.  Do I really look that bad, he wondered to himself?
Dean smiles at the picture these two make.  The omega looks frazzled by the sight of his hair standing up on end as though he was trying to pull it out of his head.  His hair is dark, nothing like Emma’s light red coloring, and although not currently sporting a tan Dean can see by the skin tone that the man would color nicely after being in the sun for a few hours.  And although Dean thought Emma’s eyes were pretty when he first saw her they are nothing next to the deep ocean blue of this man’s eyes.  Dean called Emma pretty, he would certainly call this man stunning.
Cas smiles and nods excitedly, already thinking about the upcoming weekend and which of Emma’s uncles would be willing to take her for a night.
“Mmmmmph, thank you baby.”
“I would try and explain but…”
“Awesome, you won’t regret it.”
“I came because we need to talk, Dean.  Tonight’s events have made some things very clear to me and I think I need to get this off my chest.”  Dean and Lisa shared a look and Lisa started to get up.
“And mama, we got a paper that I need help to do.  It says so here.”
Shaking his head, Dean heads to the bathroom.  It’s time to jump in the shower and start his day.  Work waits for no man, pining or not.
Since the day he had met Cas and his adorable daughter Emma two months ago, he had been spending an increasing number of his Saturdays with Cas and Emma.  It had started with Cas inviting Dean to the park on Saturdays to sit with him while they both watched Emma run around with other pups at the playground.  After a few weeks Cas invited Dean to their house to play with Emma since the weather had turned cold and rainy.  Emma and Dean had turned the living room into a pillow fort complete with television viewing window that allowed Emma to catch her regular Saturday afternoon cartoons while the adults had coffee in the kitchen.  Dean hadn’t had that much clean fun in a long time.
“I forgots to tell him.”  Emma says this with no concern at all.  She continues to focus on making sure that the candy cane she is working on has the perfect red stripes through its center.  Dean taps the table right in front of her to try and get her attention. She looks up with a crease in her brow, her head tilted just a little to the side.  She looks so much like Cas in that moment that Dean can’t help but smile.
Castiel wasn’t scheduled to work tonight so Dean had planned on taking him to dinner.  However, when he woke he felt like his head was about to explode.  Shifting in bed Cas noted that his equilibrium was off as well.  He groaned and buried his head in his pillow.  What horrible timing for a migraine to pop up.  He wasn’t too surprised, though.  He tended to get them whenever he was under stress.  The upcoming weekend as well as learning that Dean was aware of the events in Chicago were enough to throw his body out of whack.  He grabbed his phone from the side table.  Cracking open an eye just wide enough to see the phone he opened up the messaging app.
Dean smiles more than he is sure is appropriate considering that Cas coming over tomorrow is not a date, no matter what his brain says.  He goes to sleep with a smile on his face, in fact, excited about both breakfast with Claire and dinner with Cas.
Cas didn’t bother knocking and just walked in.  Dean was sitting on the sofa with Lisa, his arm wrapped around her shoulder.  He looked surprised to see Cas and it had Cas stopping just inside the door, uncertain of whether he should move forward or just turn around and leave.
so what info can he give Dean that will appease the alpha mentality he’s sure lives under the surface.  “Her ‘father’ left before she was born.”
He starts waving his hands in the air as he storms over to where Cas has started mowing the side yard.  Cas apparently doesn’t see him at first because he turns the tractor and starts away from Dean.  Dean stands there with his hands on his hips and waits for Cas to get to the end of the row before he turns around.  Dean notices with a perverse sense of smugness that Cas stops the tractor, his mouth open and his cheeks turning pink, but does not turn off the tractor.  He’s seen flashes of this side of Cas since he moved out to the orchard, but this is the first time that Dean thinks that he’s ready to accept that this attraction he’s started feeling for Cas might be reciprocated.  Dean’s not above using it to his advantage.
He walks in the door and smiles as he hears the TV in the living room playing a Teen Titans episode.  Claire might not understand Teen Titans, but she likes the colorful animation and laughs at the funny antics of the young superhero group.  It doesn’t hurt that it’s tangentially related to Batman. One of the first things Dean brought Claire when he first met her was a small fleece Batman blanket.  He is a firm believer that he needs to start engaging his daughter early in order to get her interested in some of the same things he loved.
Being awake this early is a monumentally bad idea.  Dean turns and looks with bleary eyes at the clock on the bedside table.  5:32 am looks back at him and he groans.  It is entirely too early to be waking up on a Saturday.  But that is what life is like, apparently, on a working orchard.  He should be used to this by now, having spent the last half a year waking up like this, but he’d hoped that it was just a summertime seasonal thing.
“Yes, Dean?”  Cas tried not to fidget but it was hard with Dean focused on him.
“Yeah!  Lemme get the paper.” She hops off the chair and runs to the front hallway.  When she comes back she’s got a crumpled green paper in her hand and she puts it on the table in front of Dean before climbing back up into her chair.  Dean smooths it out. How she managed not to rip it while pulling it out of her school backpack is a mystery to him.
“That goes without saying, Dean.  I know we’ve had our ups and downs with planning this party,” Cas clears his throat before continuing, “But I hope you know that I don’t know what I would do without you.”
“Cas, we’re giving you carte blanche with the budget.  Hire yourself a party planner, if you must, but you will select a date, a venue and an appropriate menu so that the firm can celebrate a banner year.”
“That I would be receptive to going on a date with you?” Cas turned his head to look at Dean.  It didn’t bother him that Dean had been so forward to ask him out.  He was truly curious though as to how Dean knew that he would want to go on a date with him.
Emma is still staring at him so he grabs a piece of coloring paper and writes d-a-d-d-y on it and places it in front of her.  He still hasn’t said anything but Emma swings her legs and smiles before finishing the sentence she started.
“Sure, babydoll.  Did mama tell you to write a letter to Santa this year so you get what you want for Christmas?”  She’s been more careful at coloring inside the lines, but Dean sees that some of her crayons are starting to fall to pieces, making it more difficult for her to use them.  He makes a mental note to get her some of those washable ink pens for Christmas. He thinks Cas would really appreciate the ‘washable’ part.
“I need you to leave, Dean.  I’ll handle the after-dinner dishes.”
Dean turns and winks at Emma as she peeks out at him.  She giggles but immediately slaps her hand over her mouth as Dean shushes her.  He can hear Cas calling for Emma and is tempted to give her up considering he doesn’t want to get on Cas’ bad side when the poor man is still so sick, but Emma looks just too cute all curled up in a ball behind the couch that he keeps quiet.  After all, how mad could Cas get?
He opens up his messaging app and sends a text to Cas.
Friday rolled around and Castiel has had no time to see Dean since the barbecue.  The opening ceremonies for the Blue Falls Rodeo were scheduled to start around the same time as Cas’ shift at the Roadhouse and Dean, as the reigning rodeo circuit champion, was expected to lead the parade.  Cas was scheduled to work Friday night, Saturday night and Sunday night.  Ellen had given Cas Monday off so that he and Dean could watch the fireworks from Sam’s ranch after the closing ceremonies.  Once again Dean must have had something to do with that because Jo had told him that the Roadhouse would be extremely busy on the 4th due to the holiday.  Cas didn’t think he’d see much of Dean over the weekend as Dean had told him that he was riding in 3 different events and had other obligations for sponsors during the evenings after the rodeo had ended for the day.
“I would like to ask someone to come up and join me at the front of the room.  Dean?” He holds out his hand, hoping Dean will come and take it. Almost as one, the room turns and looks at Dean who has been standing with his hands in his pockets for the duration of the speech.  He looks confused, but slowly walks towards Cas with a smile on his face. Dean doesn’t take his hand but does stand right next to him; close enough that Cas can feel his body heat.
Cas smiles and Dean relaxes a little.  If Cas reacts to his concern with a smile, things are probably fine.  “Yes, thank you Dean.  I just found my mind racing a mile a minute last night and tossed and turned from the time I lay down until I decided that it was a lost cause.”
“What?”
“Damn it, Cas,” Dean said as he wiped his eyes again and pulls Cas from his position on the ground.  “When did you get to be such a sap. I’ve already said yes.” Dean reaches for Cas and they meet in the middle, arms wrapped around each other and mouths grinning through kiss after kiss, ignoring the party that has begun to pick up all around them.  Cas said his part, he’s exactly where he wants to be for the rest of his life.
Dean stays silent this time.  He knows that it will be impossible to try and get a word in with Cas as upset as he appears to be.
“Who, Lisa? Yeah, they go way back.  Dean and Lisa used to be a couple back when Dean was in his mid-twenties.  Real serious, too.  Me and mom thought they’d get married, especially since Dean was practically acting like Ben’s dad for a while.  I guess Lisa wasn’t keen on all his travelling during the early days of his rodeo career so she dumped him.  Agreed to keep managing him, though.”  Cas let his head fall against the wall.
“Is this good, Mr. Dean?”  She picks up the paper and hands it to him before grabbing the coloring book she had been working on and opening it to the candy cane.  Dean holds the paper in front of him and rubs his hand across his mouth. Cas is absolutely going to flip when he sees this but Dean thinks he may flip in a good way, so he’s not going to worry about it.
Dean drove Cas home and gave him a chaste kiss at the bottom of the stairs to the apartment Cas shared with his brother.  It was early enough that Gabriel would still be awake and Cas wasn’t ready to tempt fate by kissing his date where Gabe could see him.  Cas could tell that Dean wanted to be invited upstairs but Cas still shied away from intimacy, as though afraid that letting himself open up would lead to a repeat of the events that drove him from Chicago.  It didn’t seem to bother Dean too much when Cas shook his head and started up the stairs alone.  Dean stood at the bottom of the stairs watching Cas until he disappeared behind the door to his apartment.  Cas stood at the door to his apartment until he heard the throaty growl of Dean’s car pull away from the curb.  Smiling to himself, he turned and went into his room determined to ignore Gabriel for at least the night.
“Dean, I…” Cas starts.  How does he fix this? It had seemed like such an easy project in Dean’s capable hands but if his temper is anything to go by, it has been as tough on him as it would have been on Cas.  “I’m sorry. I know I’ve been avoiding making any decisions about this party. It mostly feels like my input wouldn’t be helpful to you as you have such a firm grip on everything. But I get it.  This is ultimately my responsibility and I’ve been shirking it. I’ll sign off on whatever you want me to and I’ll back whatever decisions you make. Okay? Please, please don’t let this come between us.”
“I dunno, Cas.  I feel like I’m more excited about this pup than Sam is and it isn’t even mine!”  Dean appears to be dragging the crayon over the paper too hard.  Emma frowns up at him as she succeeds in taking the crayon away before he ruins her coloring book.  Cas reaches over and places his hand over Dean’s.
It’s not a seasonal thing and Dean is starting to hate living at the orchard.
Cas leaves Balthazar’s office in a bad mood; a mood which does not seem to dissipate throughout the rest of the work day.  He walks into his house and goes straight to his office, slamming the door before letting out a deep sigh and falling into his office chair.  He regrets the childish actions immediately because while he was stomping through the house, he had heard the sound of Dean moving around in the kitchen.
“Yeah, he hasn’t been here long,” Jo said, wiping her forehead before picking up another order of drinks.  “They just put in their order.  They’ll be here a while.”  Dean wasn’t seated in Cas’ section so Cas decided that as soon as he had a quick break he would stop over and see how Dean and his manager were doing.
“Yeah I’m a little early, but you know how busy I get that weekend.  I wouldn’t have any time to come bug my little sister if I waited until July to show up.”
“Ellen will give him the night off if I ask her.  She loves me.”  Sam snorted but he didn’t argue with that statement.  The brothers turned to look at Cas.  Once again he felt pinned in place by their dual gazes.
“Your eyes are pretty,” she states, ignoring the question all together.  “They’re green and mine are blue and mama says my eyes are pretty but I think your eyes are more pretty than mine.”  He laughs at her very forward statement.  He’s been called pretty by many a cute beta or omega looking for a good time and even by an alpha or two trying to challenge him by throwing insults but never by a child that looks like she’s lost.  She’s swaying back and forth a little at this point.  Dean thinks she looks like she’s about ready for a nap.  He reaches out slowly for her hand hoping that she’ll trust him enough not to bolt.
“Let’s go see if we can find mama, okay baby girl?”  She sniffs and nods like this is the best idea ever.  Dean gives her another smile and starts for the front of the store.  He can’t imagine that her mom has gone very far from this little girl and must be frantic at finding that she has wandered off.  He walks up to the customer service counter and is about to ask the nice lady behind it to page for the girl’s mother when he hears a shout behind him.
Emma is soon looking longingly down her straw. Probably hoping more hot chocolate will magically appear, Cas thinks to himself.  Holding her cup out to Cas, Emma asks, “More cho-co-lit, mama?”  He smiles at her attempt to sound out the word.  Becky at the preschool had told Cas how good Emma was getting with bigger words.
Sam makes it sound so simple but Dean is going to tie himself up in knots until tomorrow when he gets a chance to talk to Cas.  He takes a deep breath, holds it, and then exhales slowly. “Yeah, alright Sam. I get it. Thanks, man. I appreciate the pep talk.”
“Yeah, that you can blame on Gabriel.  Apparently he talks too much when he gets drunk.  He and Sam are both on the rodeo planning committee.  They went out for drinks after a meeting one night and ended up at the Roadhouse.  Gabriel worries about you, you know.” Dean finished gently.
“Any time, Dean.  Listen, I gotta go.  Jack is getting into something in the kitchen.  Talk soon, okay?”
When he moves on to reorganizing the spice cabinet, he pulls up Sam’s number on his phone and dials, making sure to activate the speakerphone.  If he stops moving, his mind will start itching again and he’d rather not give himself an excuse to grab his keys and head to the Roadhouse. Cas would probably kill him.
, Cas thinks.  This alpha is also a charmer who could probably sweet talk a nun out of her habit.  Castiel is decidedly not a nun.  And the heat he feels in his cheeks as Dean stands there and interacts with his daughter is both confusing and wonderful.  What would it be like to have an alpha like Dean to help him with Emma?  To be a partner in his life?
“And honestly, I’ve seen the way that some of the partners feel about those that take too much time to deal with ‘family issues’.  They can’t do anything legally, but they also aren’t quick to promote those people either, no matter how good they are at winning cases.”
“Yes, Dean?” Cas does not look up from his books, but that isn’t surprising. Give Cas the opportunity to get ahead, and he’ll ignore anything else.
“You too, Cas.  Dean’s been telling me all about you.  I haven’t been able to shut him up since this morning.”  She turned and looked at Dean as she spoke.  Cas could see the twinkle in her eye as she did and it made the back of his throat hurt.  He swallowed a few times as he stood there, unsure of what to say next.  She looked at Dean like they had history.  Dean didn’t talk about his past so maybe they did.  Cas didn’t know why this was making him so emotional; it wasn’t like he was unaware that Dean had been with others before him.
“You are a charmer, sweetheart.  You must get that from your mama.”  Dean looks back to the omega, Castiel, to see him blushing.  Totally charming.  He doesn’t see a mating mark but that doesn’t mean there isn’t an alpha waiting at home for this pair.  How to ask the delicate question, though?
“Cas, you don’t gotta tell me what happened in Chicago.  You tell me as much as you want to tell me.  I’ll be here and I’ll listen.”
“Okay Emma.  We’ll look at the paper and make a plan when we get home.  How does mac and cheese sound for dinner tonight?”
“Nope, he doesn’t know that I need to write a letter to Santa.”  At this, Dean pauses. Cas always knows everything that goes on with Emma and school.  He wonders how this slipped through the cracks.
Alphas aren’t errand boys.  At least this is what Dean tells himself as he stands in front of the peanut butter at the Whole Foods down the street from Sam’s apartment.  Stupid little brothers and their stupid puppy dog eyes.
“Cas, that’s just me.  I am rugged.  I mean, just look at me.” Dean swept his hands up and down his body.  Cas took in the worn boots, the faded jeans and the black tee shirt that looked as if it had been washed a hundred times. “I am down-to-earth.  During the rodeo off-season, I work on my brother’s ranch shoveling crap.  I’m not going to comment on being charming because I am trying to be humble here,” Dean continued with a twinkle in his eye.  “But do you honestly think that the things I’ve done and said in the past few weeks haven’t been the real me? Do you really think that I would drop you for Lisa so quickly?  I didn’t tell you about her, I know.  It was a dumb mistake.  But I’ll tell you everything you want to know if you’re willing to listen.”  Dean stepped forward, a hand to Cas’ cheek.  Cas tried not to lean in to Dean but the way he was rubbing his thumb against Cas’ cheekbone back and forth soothingly was calming him down.
Second, why doesn’t this apartment have blinds?  It’s not fair that he has to wake up to both the rooster crowing at stupid o’clock and the sun shining right into his eyeballs.  Nevermind the fact that he didn’t go to bed until 1 am last night.
his mind supplies.  Yup, there’s also that.
It was frustrating to be kept apart but they had promised to continue texting throughout the weekend.  Dean was sending him funny observations about the other cowboys and about members of the crowd.  It seemed that one patron had almost fallen over the rail into the arena when he’d tried to impersonate one of rodeo clowns.  His wife, who had looked extremely embarrassed according to Dean, had to grab onto his belt to try and keep him from going “ass over teakettle” into the arena.  The emojis Dean had included with that text had Cas smiling for a good hour.
“Cas, I honestly don’t have any idea what you are talking about.  Lisa is helping me end my contract obligations so that I can be free to stay with you here in Blue Falls.  Nothing is going on between us and if you had just stuck around and talked to me at the Roadhouse, you wouldn’t be bursting in here demanding we break up.”  Dean looked bewildered at Cas’ admission.  Dean’s reactions to everything Cas had said so far were starting to confuse him.
“Maaaaaamaaaaaaaa!”  Her little body does not stop so Cas reaches down and picks her up before she can faceplant into his legs.
“Thank you, Dean.”  Cas squeezed Dean’s arms.  Dean reciprocated by pressing a kiss to the side of Cas’ head.
What crap.  What kind of alpha eats all-natural, organic peanut butter?  His brother, the biggest non-alpha to ever alpha, that’s who.
“I need some time to digest what I’ve learned today.  I think you can feed yourself tonight and I will tell Claire that she will see you tomorrow.”  Cas turns back to the stove, dismissing Dean and leaving him speechless. He’s sure this has not yet happened the whole six months he’s been living at Cas’.
“You know, Dean, hiring you was the best thing to happen to this party.”  Cas is struggling not to pull Dean into his arms. Dean is dressed up for the party in grey slacks and a cashmere sweater and yet looks just as approachable as he does in jeans and a tee shirt.  Frankly, it doesn’t matter how Dean dresses, Cas thinks he looks fabulous in anything.
“I can’t believe this night is finally here,” Cas says.  “All this work done in only four months. For a party that I never wanted a hand in planning, I’d say so far we’ve hit the ball out of the arena.”
:    :) I accept your apology.
“Friends, colleagues, guests; I want to thank you for making tonight memorable in so many ways.  When the partners first asked me to plan this get-together, it felt like I had just been handed the hardest and most important case of my life.  In fact, I would have taken on 20 cases if it meant not being in charge of tonight’s festivities. Please never ask me to do this again.” Everyone laughs politely at this.  It gives Cas time to take another breath and to once again collect his thoughts.
“Good, good….uh, Cas is actually why I called.”  Dean proceeds to tell Sam about his day, including Cas’ reaction when he came home from the get together after group.
“He’s been helping you plan, right?”
Castiel walks into the Whole Foods and immediately feels overwhelmed.  He never comes to this store but it is on the way home from both the pediatric clinic where he works as a nurse and where his daughter goes to preschool.  Lately she can’t stop talking about these fruit snacks that the preschool gives the children after nap time.  He finally talked to Becky today who told him that Whole Foods “has absolutely the best ever all-natural fruit snacks, Castiel!  You must get some for Emma!”
“It was one of those tabletop robot kits like the ones we saw at ComicCon last summer, remember?”
She neatly circles ‘a perfect angel’ and Dean smiles.  He’s taken to calling Cas ‘angel’ as a nickname which Emma must have picked up on.  She is precise when she starts to spell out ‘f-o-r M-r D-e-a-n’ and then she stops and looks up at him.
“You’re a little early for the rodeo, aren’t you Dean?  Or did you get your months mixed up?” Jo grabbed a pint glass and began to fill it with a local IPA.  There was curiosity in her eyes but also affection.  Cas’ stomach twisted a little.  He could see how close these two were and it made him jealous.  Aside from his brother with whom he was staying he had few friends and even fewer romantic prospects.  It was easy to get jealous over his coworker and her apparent relationship with the good-looking cowboy.
As soon as Cas announces that lunch is over, Dean grabs Emma and escapes back to the living room and My Little Pony.
“Cas, c’mon.  Let me try.”  Dean reaches for Emma and pulls her onto his lap.  Cas lets her go with a huff and a frown as she snuggles into Dean’s chest right away and wraps her arms around his neck.  Dean rubs her back and kisses the top of her head, warily watching Cas get up from the kitchen table and walk out of the room.  He tries not to get involved when it comes to the parenting thing because he has absolutely no recent experience with pups.  Cas has done an amazing job as a single parent without any help or input from Dean and he can only think that his interference will make Cas question whether or not he wants Dean in their lives.
“My name’s Dean and it was no problem…” Dean trails off hoping the man will offer his name.
“Well, Ms. Becky says that we should ask for something special.  I want you to be my daddy. That’s special, right?” That is absolutely not a tear that is gathering in Dean’s eye ready to slip down his cheek.  He and Cas have been spending an increasing amount of time together and most of that time includes Emma but he didn’t realize that Emma had started thinking of him that way, request for more hot chocolate notwithstanding.  He’ll have to ask Cas about that when he gets home.
Castiel currently feels a strong desire to pinch himself.  That the omega is dreaming is the only way to explain how he and his daughter Emma have ended up at a small café close to their regular grocery store with a handsome, caring (
: Yes, Dean.  Claire is expecting you bright and early for pancakes.
“I mean, how did they know?” Dean tries to sound incredulous because he is. If Cas isn’t his Secret Santa, then he truly doesn’t understand how his Secret Santa would know what to get him. The first gift was the special kind of interior cleaner he uses for his car. Now, lots of people might know to get him that brand because he’s not shy about bragging when it comes to his car. But that kind of thing isn’t cheap either. Cas would definitely be able to afford it, as might a few others, but Dean feels like the stars are aligning just a little too closely.
“Cheeeeeeeeeese!  Mac and cheese! Mac and cheese!  Mac and cheese!” Emma continues to chant as he buckles her into the car seat.  Her whole body is bouncing with excitement.
“No, Lisa.  You can stay.  I will not be here long.”  Cas turned and looked at Dean.  It was breaking his heart to stand in front of this man he had developed feelings for in such a short amount of time.  “I think we should break up.  Dean, it’s understandable that you would rather be with Lisa than with me.  She can give you all the things you want out of life.”
He stands and preens for a few minutes before he sees Cas visibly shake himself, turn off the engine, and climb off the tractor.  Cas walks slowly over to Dean and says in his low voice, “Hello Dean.”  Dean visibly shivers at hearing his name in that gravel tone.
Emma grabs the crayon and huffs.  She’s used to getting her own way with her uncles, he knows.  Cas constantly complains about how his brothers will drop anything to make sure that princess Emma, as her uncles call her, doesn’t have to lift a finger.  She starts at the bottom with her name. Dean and Cas have both been working with her to make sure she can spell it out and make it legible. She makes it through her name with no issues and moves back up to start writing what she wants from Santa for Christmas.
So here he is scrubbing the sink and composing some kind of apology to Cas in his head.  Maybe some kind of apology where he tells Cas that he might possibly be attracted to him but not because of Claire.  He’s got to make it clear that no matter what happens with his daughter that the attraction to Cas is because the man is funny in a deadpan way, caring no matter what the circumstances, and passionate about his causes.  Everything Dean used to be but isn’t sure he’s got the conviction for any longer.
“Alpha, I can’t thank you enough for keeping an eye on my daughter.  I turned away for one second and she was gone.”  Castiel hopes this alpha doesn’t think he’s a total failure at being a parent.  Why that is so important doesn’t really register at the moment but the smile on this man’s face is beautiful and Cas will do what he can to keep it there.
“I know, I know.  One of these days I will have you out to the farm, Sam, I promise.  You and Jack. The weather is nice enough for a barbecue and since its just Claire out here right now, it would be just us.
“Dean, you didn’t have to come over today.”  Cas definitely sounds stuffy and his voice is even rougher than normal.  If he didn’t looks so miserable Dean would have been insanely turned on by the dip in the timbre of Cas’ speech.
“What? That sounds awesome, Cas.  You can make this the best party ever!  I can see it now.” Dean is now talking faster and the excitement is evident in his voice.  This just gets Cas more panicked as he realizes that he was hoping Dean would scoff and agree with Cas that he should not be involved in planning the party.
Not long ago he would have been at work for most of his Saturday before heading out to a bar with friends to drink and flirt the night away.  And then this amazing Omega and his daughter had come crashing into his life.  He often thinks back to that day in the grocery store.  How fearless little Emma had introduced herself with the best pickup line a four year old could manage and how Castiel, fearless in his own quiet way, had shyly agreed to coffee with Dean on the spot.  How dreary his life would still be without these two crash landing into his life.
Stepping up to the table Castiel gave Dean and the woman a tight smile.  “Dean, I didn’t expect to see you here tonight,” he said with a question in his voice.
“Cas, I know you said you were fine but I want to take care of you.”  Dean packs an overnight bag for Saturday as he talks to Cas on the phone.  In the kitchen he already has some homemade soup with alphabet pasta (his mom’s recipe), oyster crackers (he loved breaking these open as a kid and eating them one half at a time), and some cartoons recommended by a few of his coworkers (he doesn’t think Cas would appreciate introducing Emma to anime at this stage of her young life even if it is Sailor Moon) in a reusable shopping bag ready to go.
Cas put his phone down and rolled over.  Staring at his screen like that had made the daggers behind his eyes sink in deeper.  Probably not smart but easier than calling Dean and trying to explain to him over the phone that he would have to cancel their date.  Cas was already close to crying from the pain in his head.  Telling Dean that he wouldn’t be able to see him until Monday would definitely have made him break down.
“Are you sure that he’s not going to take that as me wanting to jump into bed with him?  He did just give me hell for potentially inviting people back to the apartment for just that reason.”
“Cas, I need you to weigh in on this venue.  We’ve only got three months to go and you haven’t told me if you think the partners will want to have the party at Old Market Brewery or not.”  Dean has brochures and papers strewn all over the dining room, his laptop open to a budgeting spreadsheet perched precariously at the corner of the table. Their ability to eat at the table has suffered in weeks past, but Cas knows the alternative would be to plan this party on his own, a sacrifice he is certainly not willing to make.
“Hey baby, it’s time to take your medicine,” Cas calls from the kitchen.  Dean sees the look on Emma’s face and he has to stifle a chuckle.  Emma looks terrified and she immediately runs behind the couch trying to hide.
“All right.  I’ll be back in a moment.”
“You’ve had enough for now, baby.  How about you have some water?”  Cas pushes the cup of ice water in front of her.  Emma frowns and turns to Dean.  Putting on her best smile and batting her eyelashes yet again (seriously, where did she learn that trick from?) she holds out her cup to Dean. “Papa, more?”  Dean is thankfully neither taking a drink nor chewing food at that moment.  Cas has a feeling the alpha would have sprayed the table if that were the case. He just starts laughing instead.  Cas, on the other hand, almost chokes on his coffee.  Dean pats Cas a couple of times on the back to make sure he is breathing, smiling the whole time.  He feels his face heat up.
“Dean, please don’t stress yourself unduly about this.  You will be a wonderful uncle when the time comes and the pup will be better off for having so many loving, caring family members.  Sam is probably feeling a lot of pressure to be the stoic, unflappable alpha mate,” Cas argues.  “I bet he’ll be just as sappy as you once that little girl or boy is born.  And you’re still young enough to start a family.  When the time is right, it’ll happen for you.”
“Someone had to watch you before you made a fool of yourself.  You were acting quite drunk.”
Lisa held out her hand for Cas to shake.  He reached out carefully, not wanting to offend the woman but not too keen on shaking her hand.
Dean pulls into Cas’ driveway 15 minutes later.  Because he can still be polite even if his instincts are screaming at him to barge in and take over caring for Cas and Emma, he knocks on the door and waits.  As the door to the house swings open, Dean stops himself from gaping.  Cas looks awful.  His nose is red, the bags under his eyes are more pronounced than usual, and his hair looks like a bird took up residence since the last time Dean saw him.  Dean is not going to be the idiot Alpha that actually voices these observations out loud.  He’s learned enough from seeing Jess go through morning sickness to know that saying anything about how off an Omega looks is cause for bodily harm.  Instead, he opens his arms allowing Cas to walk up and snuggle into him.  Dean kisses Cas on the forehead noting the eucalyptus and menthol smell surrounding him.
Over 45 minutes later, Cas found himself able to slip off his apron and on his way to the corner where Jo had said Dean was seated.  He wound his way through bodies before stopping a few feet away from the booth where he saw the back of Dean’s head.  Seated next to Dean was a woman with long brunette hair and tanned skin.  Their heads were bent together as the woman passed her phone over to Dean.  From what Cas could see there were pictures on her phone that she was intent on showing Dean.  Her had was resting on Dean’s arm.  Cas’ stomach dropped into his feet as the sound of Dean’s laugh carried towards him.
“Yeah, right. So how did my Secret Santa know to get me one of these?”
Dean and Cas had spent the rest of Sunday night and most of Monday wrapped up in each other at Dean’s place.  They’d both slept in their clothes after staying up talking the night before and falling asleep on the sofa.  They’d moved to the bed in the early morning hours but neither had been comfortable enough to disrobe.  Cas finally told Dean the whole story about leaving Chicago.  How helpless he had felt when Uriel had moved from verbal abuse to physical abuse.  His whole life had been wrapped up in Uriel; he’d lost his apartment, his job and his friends when he decided to leave.  Dean held him as he confessed to calling Gabriel crying because he had nowhere to stay and no money to even get a motel room.  Leaving with only a small backpack full of personal belongings he waited at the Greyhound station for Gabe to show up a day later.  Cas admitted to Dean that he never wanted to be that helpless and out of control ever again.
“Damn it, Cas,” Dean explodes.  “I’ve been working my ass off on this party for you and you can’t even give me straight answers.  If I can’t pin you down and get you to sign off on some of these decisions, I’m going to dump this on your lap to deal with.”  Dean is breathing hard after his torrent. They both stand in the dining room staring at each other. Cas is the first to look away.
“We didn’t see your car, so I told Claire that you were probably going to meet us at home.  So we drove home. We drove home past the Roadhouse. And do you know what I saw when we drove past the Roadhouse, Dean?”
“And, frankly, I’m grateful that you take “alone” time at the Roadhouse and don’t bring it back to the apartment.  I don’t know if I could handle knowing that you brought someone home with you while you are still trying to build a relationship with Claire and prove to the state of Illinois that you are fit to be her parent full time.”
“Hey!” Dean exclaimed but Cas could see that it didn’t really bother him.  Dean was quieter when he continued.  “Cas, we all got secrets.  I’m not going to judge you for the ones you chose not to tell me.  When you’re ready, I’m here.  If you never want to tell me, that’s fine.”
Now that the awful medicine has been consumed, Emma seems worn out.  Her head is resting on Dean’s chest just under his chin.  He rubs his cheek on the top of her head and takes in her clean scent.  He lifts the footrest of the recliner and lays back.  Emma takes a deep breath and seems to settle even further into Dean.  Her thumb is now wedged firmly in her mouth.  He can sporadically hear the soft sucking sounds and she seems to drift off to sleep.  If Dean weren’t so worried about waking her from what will certainly be naptime, he would call Cas in to see how precious she looks right now.  No sign at all of the little hellion that was causing all the trouble as Cas tried to feed her the cough syrup.  His last conscious thought as he drifts off is that he wants to do this every day for the rest of his life.
Dean is looking at Cas’ hand resting over his with an unreadable expression on his face.  Cas thinks that he may have gone too far and is ready to pull away when Dean suddenly places his other hand over Cas’.
“Little traitor,” Cas mumbles as he takes a quick picture with his phone and throws a blanket over both of them.  As his two favorite people in the world slumber on next to him, he turns off the TV and lays down on the couch with a book.
Cas doesn’t hear any noise from the living room as he finishes loading dishes and gets the dishwasher running.  The process of cleaning up after lunch has soothed any of the remaining ire Cas was still feeling after the frustration of Emma’s tantrum.  The kitchen is as clean as it’s going to get at this point so he grabs a mug of tea from the microwave where it was heating up and wanders into the living room to see what Dean and Emma are up to.
She looks around and he sees the moment she suddenly realizes she’s alone because her eyes well up with tears and her face scrunches up.  Dean is positive that she’s about to cry.  Before she even gets started Dean picks her up and cuddles her next to his side.
Cas had to hold on to the fact that Dean continued to ask him for more and more dates.  Their last date – the barbecue at the ranch outside of town – had felt more like “meeting the family” than an actual date although Cas had already met Sam before Dean came back to Blue Falls.  But Cas had finally met Bobby in an official family capacity and had learned how close Ellen and Jo really were to the Winchesters when they were invited for the barbecue as well.
“Hey baby girl,” Dean reaches down and picks up Emma.  “I wanted to see you and the munchkin,” he says to Cas.  “I brought some things with me to help you out.  Let me get her settled in front of the TV with some My Little Pony and then I’ll heat up some soup for the both of you.”
Now Cas is embarrassed.  How is he going to tell Dean that he’s all riled up because he’s got to plan a holiday party for the firm?  When he thinks about it, it seems quite silly. He takes a deep breath and pulls back to look at Dean. Dean looks so concerned and it’s honestly adorable.  It’s just one of those things that Cas loves so much about Dean. He’ll go from teasing to downright serious in the snap of his fingers if he thinks something is wrong.
“Whatcha thinking about, Cas?” Castiel didn’t realize how much he’d zoned out until he felt the voice in his ear.  Startled, his eyes flew to Dean standing next to him.
“Okay, okay.  I get it,” he chuckles.  “Excellent idea if I do say so myself.  Let’s get home and get started on dinner.”  As Cas drives home, he completely forgets about the light green paper that Emma had clutched in her tiny fist and the project she was supposed to complete.
, he thought.
The rodeo that led Dean back to Blue Falls was scheduled to begin in just a few short days over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.  The small town of Blue Falls would be inundated with 50 times the number of people that it was used to for the other 51 weeks of the year.  Cas had never been through a Blue Falls Rodeo weekend.  The weeks leading up to the rodeo had been slow at the Roadhouse.  The crew at the bar had done nothing but tell stories about previous years.  And although Dean had been sweet and attentive during recent weeks, Cas had heard some raunchy stories – some of them downright unbelievable and most of them involving Dean.  He was struggling again with feelings of inadequacy.  If Dean had really done all of the things that Jo said he had, how would Cas ever be able to hold his interest long term?
“Dean, is Emma in here?”
“This is perfect, sweetheart.  Good job.” Dean is proud of how he says this while keeping his voice steady.  Damn it, he will not get emotional over this and cry in front of a child. He pins it to the fridge with one of those silly magnets Cas bought that look like reindeer with sunglasses on and he turns back to the kitchen table to continue coloring with Emma.
And this is why I love the SPN family.  You guys gave me great feedback (kudos + comments) on the first part of this from Dean's POV and I was excited to give you more!  I will be working on the 'hot chocolate date' and I'm going to try and weave the two points of view into one long chapter.  It will be a separate work from this so keep your eyes peeled!
Lobster tank…no little girl in pig tails.  Bakery counter…no little girl in a purple plaid dress.  Bathrooms…they didn’t use the bathrooms this trip but Emma has been so proud of using the bathroom at home by herself more and more lately so maybe she wandered in that direction.  No little girl in orange Crocs with her thumb in her mouth.
“Cas.”  Dean slapped his hands on the table top and stood up.  Cas started, half afraid Dean would topple over.
Dean told Cas about Lisa and how young he had been when they decided to live together.  He’d enjoyed teaching Lisa’s son Ben about being a man.  He’d shown Ben how to protect himself from bullies at school; he’d taught Ben about cars and the importance of regular automobile maintenance; he’d introduced Ben to the wonders of classic rock.  Cas smiled at that last admission as he’d rubbed his face in Dean’s chest.  Dean told Cas that he thought Lisa was it for him until he’d met another cowboy on the rodeo circuit.  He’d slept with the man with almost no thought for Lisa waiting at home.  Dean went home to Lisa and confessed.  They’d talked about staying together for Ben’s sake but decided in the end that they’d be better role models for him if they abandoned what had become a toxic relationship.
Jo smiled. “Yeah, Novak’s a real sweetheart for sure. But, you seem like a really nice guy too, Dean. I’m sure he wouldn’t forgive you if he wasn’t sure that you were worth forgiving.”
With one last kiss, she pulled him into a tight hug. “Love you, Cassie. Enjoy the rest of your classes today!”
Eventually, it was Dean who finally broke the silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel plastered on the sincerest smile he could muster as Charlie dropped his bookbag into his lap. He rubbed the back of his neck. “Sorry, Charlie. You’re seriously the best.”
Right?
“What a fucking prick...” Gabe muttered, turning to look at Castiel. “Has he given you his full-of-shit excuse yet as to why he didn’t talk to you all that time?”
Before too much longer, the bell rang, and lunch was over. The three of them got to their feet and fought the current back into the cafeteria to throw away their lunches and grab their things.
It was obvious that Dean was trying really hard to get them somewhere where they could mend their broken friendship. But Castiel had just started healing. He wasn’t going to let Dean drag him back into his pit of despair. He slammed his locker closed.
“Dean Winchester...”
“Sounds like a great fucking plan,” Castiel said. With that, they drove out of the parking lot and towards the bakery. Meanwhile, Dean had caught up with Charlie. As excited as Charlie was earlier was how intimidating she was now, staring Dean down after he’d asked her a question.
put him through, Winchester.”
“You know, we’re probably setting ourselves up for disappointment,” Jo started with a laugh. “There’s no way they’ll be playing
He was… he was actually interested in spending time together again.
Dean groaned as his phone vibrated on the bed next to him. Of course he forgot to turn his phone off.
“Ah, impressive credentials… you can’t pass up an opportunity like this, Novak,” Charlie teased. Castiel remained silent, blushing furiously. Hannah gave him a sweet smile.
Jo simply smiled at him. “What do you think?” she asked, posing at the bottom of the stairs.
“I can… I can go eat somewhere else, if—”
Before Cas knew it, he had started crying. He always hated how emotional he was. His mom always told him it was good that he didn’t feel pressured into the patriarchal standards of emotionlessness that was expected of boys. But he still hated how he cried at damn near anything.
“You’re so amazing, Jo. Really.”
Dean’s face lit up at the number. He saved her as a contact before sending a text back.
Castiel shook his head. “My apologies, ma’am, what can I get for you?”
“Thanks, Cas. That means a lot.”
Charlie thought it was the ‘most adorable thing’ she’d ever seen, and that frustrated the hell out of Gabe and Dean. They both bristled with unease as they watched them interacting; how could Charlie not see it? Castiel always looked like he was quaking. He looked like he was unsure if he was going to make it to his next classes alive or not, and there was no way in hell that that was a good sign.
him because he’s still dad, even if he’s a piece of shit…”
Charlie rubbed her temples, groaning in annoyance. They’d been sitting here for an hour while Castiel word vomited how he couldn’t be gay just because he liked Dean kissing him. Not even bisexual… he insisted.
They were always going to be there for him. They were never going to ignore his texts or his calls.
Jo grinned at him. “Well, we can’t all be rugged acoustic guitar players, can we?”
“Yeah, join the club.” Gabe said, his tone monotonous.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Ass.”
Dean sighed. “I’m sorry I couldn’t be better for you, Jo. I really am.”
“Present,” he said, with a deep husky voice. This time it was Castiel who turned to look at him, and he was met with those emerald-green eyes. Castiel blushed and turned away again. He felt Charlie wiggle next to him, and he knew she’d seen what just happened.
Castiel thought for a few minutes.
Dean pulled Jo close to him and smiled as Ellen took what felt like literally thousands of pictures. By the time she was done, all he saw were white flashes in his vision.
Jo hushed him as she pulled him into a hug. “You don’t have to apologize to me.”
It was the beginning of the day. Castiel could
really don’t like you. But Cas likes you, and unlike some of us, I actually care about my friends.”
, he thought to himself, not daring to say any of that out loud. He was sure Jo was already suspicious of his feelings towards Castiel after how he reacted at the dance.
Hannah laughed at the scene. “If your friend is implying that you would like to ask me to the dance… I’d be glad to go with you, Castiel.”
Castiel gave a small smile. He forgot how nice it was to be Dean’s friend. “You never know if you don’t ask, right?”
“You’re right.” He pulled himself back into his present and looked Jo in the eyes, smiling. He reached over and grabbed her hands into his own, giving them gentle squeezes. “I’ll start focusing more on the things in front of me. I promise.”
Dean nodded his head, looking down where he was nervously fidgeting his fingers. “Yeah, of course… uh…”
“Dean is the most important person in my life and has been for a while now.  When I came home from the office upset because I had been handed this holiday party to plan, he immediately talked me off the ledge, so to speak, and agreed that he would help me out.  When he needed decisions made and I wasn’t providing answers, he tore me a new one, as he should have. He made the charity part of this holiday party come together because he cares about our community.  He helped decorate this beautiful space because he cares that I care about you all. I guess what I’m trying to say is that my life would not be as beautiful as this space without him.”
: No funny business.
“Yeah, about that.  Is there some reason that you are mowing the lawn at 6:00 am this morning?”  Dean sees Cas’ forehead crease as the man frowns.  Cas almost looks confused for a moment.
“Dean, you didn’t have to buy us anything else.”  If Cas had his way, Dean wouldn’t have bought them anything at all and would have allowed Cas to contribute to the ‘date’.
“Normally I would say yes, Sam, but I wanted to solidify my place there before I start bringing Dean into the equation.  This isn’t the type of employer that would fire me for not being straight, but I just don’t want to bring that kind of attention to either myself or the partners.”
“I just don’t know if a brewery is a good option for an open house holiday party, Dean.  We’ve talked about this.”  Cas is trying to avoid the discussion by staying in the kitchen and trying to finish loading the dishwasher. Who knew there would ever come a day where he would prefer chores to having this conversation with his boyfriend.
