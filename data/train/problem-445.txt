That serenity in counting out the seconds, dividing the astronomical day into 86,400 equal parts, making them measurable. But that wasn't it. It also wasn't the caesium-33 atom that defined the atomic second. It was the sixty beats per minute. The pulse of the human body. The measure of deep relaxation, rest and composure.
There was scarcely a single square centimetre of skin on the man's body that wasn't decorated. He was huge, with the bulging muscles of his upper body covered only scantily by a sleeveless leather waistcoat. He carefully examined the picture of the spider that Sherlock held out to him. In the background the high-pitched buzz of the tattoo needles. Tattoos were being done at every station in the studio. It was well-frequented, one of the best addresses in London. Sherlock had been directed there with the tip that the spider might have come from there.
"The best thing I can do for my father is to take care of you," Sergej answered earnestly. "I also think you need me more than my father does right now."
John closed his eyes again and relaxed. He was dead tired. Shaky and incredibly frail. Sherlock was alive. He could still feel Sergej squeezing his hand, heard the regular beeping fading away and fell into a deep sleep.
"No," said John.
Time passed. Sherlock's cool fingers felt their way into John's hand and held it fast.
John studied his friend's pale blue eyes, saw the flash of uncertainty there, just for a second.
"I'm sorry, John. I'm not at liberty to divulge any information on that point," Mycroft replied, just as neutrally.
. But the recipe was supposedly lost."
"You're wearing a wedding ring," John said, in shock.
"I can't," Sherlock said, his voice choked.
The theme broke down in the middle of the name, reeled, wobbled, slipped away. Sherlock felt his anger collapse, his grip eased off and weakened; he opened the hand holding the fingerboard, relaxed his bow hand. The entire weight of the bow rested on the open strings, teetered by the ferrule on the outermost tip of his middle finger. Feeble. Powerless. The sound nothing more than a creak. Laboured. Empty. He'd let go of everything. Given it all up. In its place a black flood that drained every fibre of his strength. The bow refused to make a sound.
He'd suspected the CIA was responsible for Mary's death. Mary and his unborn daughter. Mary, a rogue agent. Not an accident. Even if it had looked like one and no one had been able to prove otherwise. Sherlock's fears had come home to roost. Mycroft's people hadn't protected Mary. The connections between the intelligence agencies were too complex, any interference too delicate. Sherlock had broken his vow. He hadn't been able to protect her. Empty words. Worthless promises.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "Thank you," he said.
"You were trying to reach me?" Harried breathing on the other end of the line, street noise in the background. Seal was out somewhere.
Sherlock's clear eyes. Still uncertain for a brief moment. A lingering gaze into John's. A dull shadow in the icy blue. John didn't know exactly what it was. Worry. Fear. Sadness.
"This is so far out of line, what you're doing here, John," Dave said once they were out in the corridor. They'd stopped walking. Dave's eyes sparkled with controlled rage. "You're not only betraying the trust of the centre, you're betraying your partner, and he's under our protection here as a patient. I'm going to have to report this to the centre heads."
"No, John! No. Please, not this either-or! Don't make me choose! I'm begging you. Let us find a solution. Please! Please!"
I do not speak any further, as the grey in his eyes clouds over. Then it becomes translucent and wet. Slowly. Very slowly. I have never seen it, never before. I have never seen tears in Watson's eyes before. He swallows hard. Then he stand up and leaves.
Sherlock sat there, pale and bleary in the expensive leather armchair. Mycroft's words didn't seem to annoy him or even provoke him particularly. Instead, he said calmly, "I'm too old for this job. That was my last assignment. I won't be accepting any more."
John and Sherlock stayed behind alone. They sat reclined in their armchairs in front of the fire, their legs stretched out, silently drinking the single malt scotch Lestrade had brought. It had a faintly smoky flavour and a rich aroma, like dried fruit perhaps, a hint of vanilla. The fire crackled, casting a flickering light on the scene. A pleasant warmth filled the room. They gazed into the flames, both of them lost in their own thoughts. They were dog tired.
"I need to pick Rosie up," John said after a while, glancing at the clock. "Mrs Hudson's minding her." He gently separated his fingers from Sherlock's and stood up. "I'll be back tomorrow, okay?"
"You? How did you get in?"
"No!" Sherlock almost shouted the word. "We've invested so much and we're so close to our objective, John. You can't interfere now. Please. Please, John."
Ginger Burton smiled disparagingly. "I found out," she answered.
"Our second life," John said.
"Oh please! You can't possibly be that naïve."
John searched Sherlock's eyes, but didn't find any irony there, no downplaying of the situation, no avoidance. Sherlock was holding his hand. John sank back against the wall at Sherlock's side, sat right next to him. Shoulder to shoulder. They sat there for several long minutes, hand in hand. Eventually, they turned their heads toward each other and smiled. Just then, the door to the attic was torn open.
"And you? What do you need?" John's eyes were earnest and full of concern.
Sherlock's fingers felt along the edge between the glass and the tablecloth.
The beautiful grey eyes were wide and questioning.
"The church is locked at night," Sherlock continued, unmoved. "Yet your friend was in the chapel. How was that possible?"
"You're playing my variations," Sherlock noted.
"Martin wants to try it out with us and asked if we'd let him," John lied, but Callum shook his head.
The call came while Sherlock's arm was being bandaged. On John's mobile phone. John answered it.
"Then eat of Him and drink of Him. He will always be in you, and you in Him. He will share your waking hours, your table, and your bed. He will accompany your every word, your every thought, and your every deed. He is you. And you are He."
Steps. The door downstairs, opening and closing. The woman was talking to the child, apparently taking it into the bathroom. Sherlock heard water running and carefully snuck down the stairs. The door to the bathroom stood open. The water was still running. The woman was speaking softly to the child. Sherlock slipped past to the house door, opened it, knocking at the same time, and called, "Hello, Mrs Beatty?"
Sherlock froze for a moment. Then he placed the violin into its case, closed the lid, and flipped the catch. It was as silent as a grave in the living room of 221B Baker Street. Sherlock put the violin case into the cupboard and sat at the table across from John. They looked at each other. Held each other's gaze.
These are the moments in which I doubt my own perception of nature and turn apostate from science, in which I mistrust every model and do not lend credence to any explanation. I suspect, in those fleeting seconds of somnolence, that I am experiencing what is vulgarly known as love. Love the likes of which should not be between men – and yet is. To my knowledge, there are no scientific measurements of this form of love; merely of the sexual love between a man and a woman that originates in the natural drive to reproduce. I do not know what happens to me when I lie in John's arms. But I cannot believe that it is nothing more than a few chemical processes in my body which release such deep emotions. I fear science is capable of illuminating much, but not our most basic, fundamental nature.
"Leave us alone!" he snapped, just barely able to maintain control. He was shaking all over.
Sherlock followed her. A short hallway. Lift to the eighth floor. A long hallway this time, stairs. The studio was a surprise. A glass-domed ceiling, the octagonal room flooded with daylight and filled with a dense acoustic carpet of ticking clocks in every possible pitch, every possible frequency, an eerily present, all-encompassing backdrop of imperturbable time measurement. There were clocks hanging, standing, lying everywhere.
"No!" he said, alarmed. "No, John. That's not why."
Sherlock released the last tie, pulled the open strait jacket forward, and pushed John back against the wall by his shoulders. He was heavy and bleary.
"Stop! Stay within yourself, John," Martin whispered urgently. "Stay entirely within yourself. Centre yourself."
"Thief," he whispered.
"Today is not my day," Sherlock said apologetically as he slowly turned around. The tip of the bow dragged over the carpet. He went to the window, set the instrument down on the table, loosened the bow, and started to clean the violin with a cloth. Not saying a word.
"So are you. And Gerome as well, come down to it. He was a physicist before he made the decision to become a priest."
Linda picked John up from the train station at Bury St Edmunds. Linda Woodard, a psychologist and employee of the Suffolk Constabulary. John's contact for the duration of the mission, a nondescript woman around John's age. Ideal for the job. She took John to the small flat that had been rented for him, close to St Anna's Hospital but not on campus. A block of flats, sixth floor, one and a half rooms, furnished. The flat was surprisingly spacious and light. It was on the top floor of the building, and daylight streamed into the space through a large skylight.
John didn't leave his side. He got into the ambulance with Sherlock and watched attentively as his colleague tended to Sherlock's injury on the way to the hospital. John looked terrible. Tired and sad. Sherlock saw it all, but didn't say anything. He didn't know what he could have said.
Sherlock sat down next to John in the narrow pew, looked toward the partition between the chancel and the nave at the front, a painted wooden screen with a triptych. It blocked the view of the women singing and separated the religious order's part of the church from the public side. The bewitchingly pure sound of the Gregorian chant rose over the partition, up into the plain, Romanesque vaulted ceiling, floating through the room, filling it with a purity that settled over them like a cloak, surrounding them completely. Its presence was so compelling that it was impossible to think.
"Why do you not observe, Holmes? Why do you not look at the facts? Why do you not draw your conclusions from what you acknowledge to be true? The same way you do in all other cases? Adam and Eve are not the only option."
"Out of necessity," Rose pointed out. "Without Ferdinand Magnussen decoding it for them, the data are worthless. And without the data, there's nothing for Magnussen to decode."
Sherlock looked over at the attendant, who nodded. John was no danger anymore in his sedated state. Sherlock slid closer to him and tugged him in by the shoulders to loosen the ties on his back. John let himself flop forward, let his forehead sink down heavily onto Sherlock's shoulder. He smelled of medicine and some strong detergent or other, mixed with the bitter, acrid scent of sweat and stress. While Sherlock undid the ties on his back, John whispered into his neck, the smouldering energy of a volcano beneath the hot stream of his breath.
"We've overlooked something," Sherlock said. "But what? It must be something simple, something obvious. Something that's obscured, invisible in its implicitness."
"One hundred percent," Sherlock said to John when they left the Yard an hour later. They'd gone over the mission with Greg's people and everything was set.
John took a deep breath, then let it out in a heavy stream. He looked at his hands for a long time where he had them folded on the table in front of him. Then he sought out Sherlock's eyes.
"I'm going to do everything in my power."
"She's dead," said Sherlock.
"It is a dangerous game, Watson."
Twelve times three hours. Following every block, one of the priests opened the door to the chapel. John and Sherlock wobbled upstairs, used the toilet, warmed up a bit, drank some water, ate the soup and bread they were given. A quarter of an hour break. Then back to the chapel. Another three-hour block. A new task. One of the attendants came into the chapel from time to time, bringing new candles, sitting in the background for a while, observing them, asking if everything was all right.
John had waited for him outside with Rosie. The little girl was babbling as she played with the colourful pebbles John had gathered with her along the shallow riverbank and laid out on a blanket.
She got up and left. John didn't need to be told twice, and went to inspect the buildings. Both empty. John decided to wait and sat down on a bench behind the house, shielded from the view of any guests who might be coming up. The wind had picked up. Where was Sherlock? John took out his smart phone. No reception. Of course. What else had he expected. You could probably only contact the lodge via a special radio frequency.
"Because of me?" he asked. His voice sounded sceptical. "Why?"
John drank some more wine, which the server had topped up quietly and discreetly. Sherlock's phone had buzzed, and he was clicking around on it. John was in a pensive mood. He enjoyed sitting here in the pizzeria with Sherlock, full and relaxed from the wine. He enjoyed seeing Sherlock and spending time with him, being close to him, being in his presence, even if they were both less talkative than usual.
John paused, hesitating. He didn't know whether it was a good idea to tell Sherlock all of this. But then he realised that he already was. That they were propped up here in this dank cellar amongst consecrated candles, speaking about things he'd wanted to forget. Forever. Things that he'd considered swept under the rug. And that were now creeping out from all the nooks and crannies of this case.
He was smiling. He was actually... smiling. John was confused.
"Eighteen years."
"Where is Sherlock?" John asked.
Sherlock was breathing heavily. John didn't know whether he was annoyed, whether he'd discovered something, or whether the ritual had affected him. He couldn't discount the latter possibility. But he didn't know. He knew nothing of Sherlock's spiritual side. Did he even have one? Was he able to take in and comprehend what was going on here? They'd never spoken of such things. John had avoided it. Perhaps because he'd been afraid of Sherlock's ridicule.
John peeled back the pink flowered blanket and lifted the child out, cradling it in his arm. A little worm. It was packed up in a bundle of cloth, its little arms bent and sticking out the top, the sleeves of the white cotton onesie folded back several times over the wrists, such tiny fists. The head with the surprisingly dark hair, the eyes squinting, the skin red and wrinkled. A scratch on the forehead. It had been a long and difficult birth.
"When did the path you walk become a river with only one direction? That's what you're asking yourself, isn't it? And you also know that every river ends in the sea."
Uncertainty in front of a steep wall. Then he saw the path. It was signalled by the usual white-blue-white marking found up here in the mountains. A safe passage. It was quiet. Here in the shade of the ravine, the moisture from the night still clung to the mountain, clammy; the smell of water and insensate cold. The panting coming from his own body too loud. Was Sherlock walking this very trail somewhere? What about Moriarty? There was another way to get to the Dossen lodge, from the Urbach valley. Were they coming that way? Or was Sherlock being dropped off by helicopter? How about Moriarty?
A hiccup was the response at the corner of John's neck, maybe a moan. It got lost in the force of their embrace, becoming stronger and more binding.
"You heard John's reservations and accusations toward you. What hurt you the most?"
"When?"
And so they had ended up inviting Mycroft after all. However, they received neither regrets nor an acceptance from him. He simply didn't react to their invitation. Sherlock was annoyed. John took it in stride.
"Are you a relative?"
John took a deep, worried breath. "These preparations. They really get down to the heart of things," he said softly.
"He said he was going to burn the heart out of me," Sherlock said.
- Congratulations, he cut him short. Is that what I am supposed to say?
He was grateful.
And Sherlock and John hadn't talked since their last exchange over phone: “Did you find anything suspicious? SH», followed by his answer «I told you I won't do it, and I will not change my mind”. So things were going just
- Destroying us.
- Hello, Mycroft! I need your help, right now.
nothing. We are stuck here because she is smartest than us, admit it.
- Okay. Can we not, like, fight right now? John annoyingly said. We will get rid of them, Mycroft. Sherlock and I know the stakes in game, okay?
He had picked Rosie up one hour and a half earlier, and the baby was now sleeping, gently cradled in Molly's arms. It had not been easy at the hospital, everyone looking at him with pity-filled eyes, glaring like he was an alien. He had felt like an animal in a cage, the doctors oppressing him with their questions about his wife and their “It will be fine”. Like they knew the whole reasons for Mary's disappearance. They knew nothing, yet they still acted like it would all go back to normal, like mothers breaking out of a maternity hospital leaving behind their newborns happened every Sunday. But now Rosie seemed at peace, magically unaware of the beautiful disaster that surrounded her and everything that would be her life.
Sherlock seemed to hesitate, like he knew the words he would say would ire John, in one way or another.
- My name is Thomas Milburgh and I was your wife's obstetrician, the man repeated with a heavy sigh.
- I… I might have a problem with the whole family situation.
- He knows, but that is really not a clever idea.
- A. Case. That. Has. Nothing. To. Do. With. Mary.
- John? It's Greg.
- I know, but there is no other way. We have to do this, we have to stop it. If we do, maybe e can stop Moriarty. Because there is one thing she hasn't realized, one thing she hasn't planned and that we can twist in our advantage.
- Good. See you around, Mycroft.
- So, Mrs Hudson mentioned a safe... Sherlock's voice resonated in the otherwise quiet room.
- Yes Sherlock, I did.
- How did nobody realized she was gone? he shouted, his voice faltering near the end of the sentence.
- Did you ever love me? he uttered.
- You know what? he said as he began walking backwards, I don't even want to talk to you right now.
- See you Greg!
“I am going to Baker Street to visit Mrs Hudson and Sherlock. Hope you're okay”. He hesitated, his fingers hovering over the “send” button. Should he make it more detailed? Less? Could Mary see he was lying? What if everything went downhill because he could not send a bloody text? He was about to ask for Sherlock's advice and knowledge in tricks, but ultimately decided against it. He could not always rely on others, he had to start believing in himself. And maybe, if he wrote the message, it would somehow look more authentic anyway. He took a deep inhale, kept the air in his lungs, and stopped breathing as he hit “send”, praying it did not sound too fake.
- John that doesn't make sense! She was so kind! I don't get it! What… Why would she do that? she seemed furious.
- Then we can stop this once for all! he picked up. The organization will be chaotic for a while, a fault in the system, without a leader, and that is when we will bring it down. It will give us an opportunity, a chance... She has no successor yet! Oh! That's brilliant John, very good!
- So what do we
- 221B Baker Street, he winked and turned back.
- One on you, dear! Mary interrupted the detective. Sherlock could never admit it, but he cares deeply about you, some might even say he loves you. And when Jim threatened to harm one out of the three of you, or all of you, he just didn't have the guts to see you die. So he jumped. Of course, he should have died that day, she retorted..
- A number you said, dears? interrupted Mrs Hudson.
- Yes, Mycroft articulated, sighing at his brother.
- Every belongings? he insisted.
- Well you can always try, but he is in his spirit palace, or whatever he calls it…
- You're a genius, Mrs Hudson, John said as he finished his tea. And a saint, he said raising up one last muffin.
- You wouldn't listen to me back at the flat, and I have a case I need to solve.
- It? Isn't James James Moriarty? I don't understand.
- Well, I'm certainly beginning to rub off on you, that's for sure.
The wind was howling. The gun. Mary about to shoot Sherlock. John palming the revolver in his pocket. Pulling the trigger. Mary. Black spots dancing before his eyes. The world spinning. Mary falling to the ground. Screaming. Blood. Blood everywhere. Death. Mary. Mary. Mary is dead.
- Listen. Mary's waters have broke in her living room and we're on our way to Saint Mary right now. Just make sure that nothing stops us. Clear the traffic, find a way to keep the cops out of our hands. Use your influence or whatever you do! Whatever suits you, honestly.
He could not have been more wrong.
- Intuition. Now, you will hide somewhere safe and wait. Do not try anything, am I clear? You'll tell her you got out so she feels safe, he continued without actually waiting for an answer, but instead Lestrade and his agents will surround the building after you sent me a message to signify her presence in the house. I'll come to Euston Road as soon as I called Scotland Yard, and we'll arrest her. Smooth and clean! he concluded, seemingly very proud of his idea.
- I figured you wouldn't. We spent the past years believing Moriarty was a man, but what if he isn't? No, he said as John was about to speak. Let me explain before you ask stupid questions. What if James just took Moriarty's name because it was convenient? Imagine it: a worldwide organization. Imagine hundreds of agents without a real boss, but someone to coordinate the operations of an entire country. And now imagine if all those coordinators had the same name as a recognition, as a way of communication between countries.
- Is that all? Or is there any other dirty secret you're hiding from me? Because if not then you can just
1) he was completely hungover
- It was all a game for her John, a new voice answered him.
- I believe she has lied to you, and even though I can't be sure of it, I think she is still hiding something. Once again, I wish it could go any other way. I'm…
Sighing, John slowly turned around, giving one last look to the general direction in which his wife has been brought, and got back outside. Sherlock was on his phone, leaning casually on the car's bonnet. John clenched his fists as he felt anger rush to him. He hurried his steps and, when he was close enough, posted in front of Sherlock and waited for him to acknowledge his existence. He cleared his throat, for good measures, and was strangely surprised to hear the detective's voice.
John did not know you could feel like fire and ice were contemporary running through his veins. He had not cleaned up the mess he had made with the snow globe. It was still there, like a sentence staring back at him. And Mary would see it, she would know he discovered her secret, even if he still did not know what it meant. The truth was that he would not accept the proof he was given of Mary's guiltiness. She had something to do with everything that was going on, somehow. “Be ready to run, if necessary”, Sherlock mouthed as an audible gasp came from the next room. John froze as his body automatically went into soldier mode. John cursed it to stay calm: it was only his wife, for God's sake. Footsteps echoed into the room, like a fatality coming to life. But, as John and Sherlock were expecting a furious ex-killer (
Suddenly, Sherlock rummaged through his pocket and extricated his phone with difficulty from it. He dialed an unknown number and put the phone to his ear, murmuring to himself.
John looked into Callum's aged eyes. They were serious.
"Yes. I talked to her, after a fashion. I mean in my head, of course. A couple of hours."
Applause breaks out. Thunderous. Thousands of people clapping, stomping, shouting, screaming. The lights come back on. Floodlights. The team of pyrotechnical artists gathers on a wooden pier on the shore, surrounded by billows of smoke. Something like twenty people. They bow stiffly in the cone of light. John's eyes are filled with emotion when they find Sherlock's. They smile at each other, overflowing with happiness.
"It's not your fault, John."
There was no way to move forward with Celine. She was frighteningly intelligent. John would have rather worked with her. But she was from the NDB. She had objectives that didn't line up with theirs. They'd gone over it and discussed it several times the past few days, he and Sherlock. There was no way to cooperate with her.
A new universe. John bit Sherlock's ear, a helpless, yearning yes. The kiss that followed left no more doubts.
"I was afraid," Sherlock said softly, very softly. He'd lowered his eyes. "Mycroft told me that Mary..." Sherlock faltered and swallowed. Then he continued, with difficulty and just as soft: "Mary and you, you were going to get married. That wasn't part of the plan."
Silence fell between them for several long minutes. Sherlock's condition frightened John. Including the fact that he didn't want to be touched or talk about what had happened during the psychotherapy session.
"Are you happy?" Fear and distraught concern in John's voice.
"Erm. I don't live at Baker Street anymore."
John smiled.
Oh yes, I was well aware how wrong that was. I stood up and went looking for him. I was a fool. A hopeless fool. I wanted to see him, to smell him. I wanted to hear his voice, to look into his eyes. I was gasping for his attention, to have it turned on me for a moment at least. A meeting. A few words. He was the man who had vanquished everything in me, conquered all, consumed me entirely. My thoughts were with him day and night, even now. I wanted to see him. Even if it might be painful to stand before him, it could not surpass the cruelty of the torment I suffered without him.
The trip with the all-terrain vehicle took about a quarter of an hour. Down to Meiringen, along the Aare toward Brienz. At some point they took a right across a narrow bridge, then on the other side of the river up again, a gravel road parallel to the train tracks. The commander eventually parked next to two police cars and an ambulance, let John and Mycroft get out. The police divers were there cleaning their equipment. The commander stepped over the single track of the local Zentralbahn railway and down to the Aare.
"No," Sherlock retorted. "You wanted revenge on Callum McHattrick originally. You saw him now and then at St Anna's and kept an eye on him, looking for a weak spot. You weren't thinking of murder at first, but then you discovered something: Callum was taking Optineuro capsules from the hospital on a regular basis. A harmless dietary supplement to improve cognition. Large capsules, filled with lecithin, vitamins, and amino acids. Easy to inject with poison. Your plan was set from that moment forward."
The words, enunciated in a loud, clear voice, echoed in the darkened chapel. There was something threatening about them. The priest in charge abruptly launched into the Canon of the Mass. He spread a white cloth out on the floor in the centre of the circle and knelt down. His two assistants brought a chalice, a pitcher, and a loaf of bread wrapped in white linen, laying the offerings on the cloth. The priest took the bread, blessed it, and tore it in half. A very physical, powerful act, far from the barely noticeable, symbolic fraction of the Host that John was familiar with.
"Mr Watson," she called through the house. "Your party is here!"
Sherlock called the mobile number again. Voice mail.
*****
So up here is where those strange rituals took place. John walked around the wall, studying the archetypes. Peter had been found in the Magician's garden. The toilets were on the south side, in the Warrior's realm. And Davide had died on the north side of the ritual room, in the King's area. Was it coincidence? If not, then the Lover was missing. A fourth murder was missing. Was it possible? John didn't like that he couldn't discuss the idea with Sherlock. That he couldn't have him at his side. Sherlock would have drawn his initial conclusions by now.
"Can I wait for him here?"
John ran his hand over my back, let his hand linger there as he showed me how to change Rosie's nappy the first time. He let his hand rest on my body. I felt John there, right beside me, felt his body heat seeping into me. Along with my longing for even more heat, more closeness, my desire to hug him. I concentrated on Rosie and saw my own hands passing on to the baby what I was getting from John.
Maggie put the next whisky down in front of John without being asked, along with a card; silent, inconspicuous, together with the glass. It was a simple white calling card. Maggie had laid it down with the blank side facing up. John picked it up and turned it over.
"Sorry," John said unhappily. "Definitely not a good day today. I shouldn't have come. I apologise."
"No one."
"Based on the music here you're not a beginner," Sherlock said. He'd picked up one of the books of sheet music from the bed and leafed through it. Hoffmeister, Sonata No. 2 in D Major.
"You look terrible, Sherlock. What happened to you?" John asked, his voice tinged with concern.
"Mrs Hudson's already set it up as a nursery," John said. "Rosie sleeps there when she stays with her. But I think Rosie should sleep upstairs with me as long as she's still small. We'd have to take stock again later."
"It was nice," John said.
Martin moved closer to him, ran his hand down John's back, tried to comfort him, to cool him down. John tried to calm down, but he was ablaze with desire. He was passing it on to Martin as well, couldn't help it. Martin hugged him from behind, pulled John into his lap. John could feel Martin's erection against his back. They were both wheezing, breathing heat.
"Have you any substantial counterarguments?"
Those days were nothing but a basic struggle to survive. A basic struggle for mental, emotional, and psychological survival. Just to get through the next hour, the next night, the next day. It was as if John had been turned to stone. His expression was hard, as if carved out of marble. His eyes empty. He functioned like a robot, made tea, drank it, ate some toast, went to sleep.
"We've spoken to his commanding officer," Greg informed John and Sherlock. "Michael Johnston was considered an excellent chaplain. Everyone loved and respected him."
Sherlock unwound the bandage a little, held one sleeve of the shirt in his teeth, and pulled the cloth more firmly around his leg. The stabbing pain made his entire body break out in a sweat, forcing tears into his eyes. He bit down on the material of the shirt as hard as he could in order not to groan out loud. With difficulty, he wrapped the shirt around the wound again, his progress slow and painful, before re-knotting the sleeves.
It was shortly after four a.m. when John returned to the efficiency flat. Sherlock looked up when the door opened. He was sitting in the reading chair with his laptop. He'd turned off the main light. Only the small reading lamp projected a narrow cone of light onto him. John didn't turn the light on. He silently took off his shoes and jacket. Then he crossed through the semi-darkness of the room and stopped in front of Sherlock.
Tears leapt from John's eyes. He wiped them away with his hand. "And then you came to Bury. I set everything on a single card, and you met me halfway. It was clear after that. It must have been clear to Martin too, at least after the ritual we shared. And now he's dead."
"This time both of us together," John whispered in Sherlock's ear when renewed heat flared up between them following a passionate kiss.
We stare at each other, Watson looking down at me with his grey eyes still glittering. I cling to his wrist, determined not to let him go.
"Sherlock..." he began, but had to stop, unable to articulate the words.
John nodded. He looked down at the floor in front of him. He'd set down the doctor's bag, wanted to reach for it with one hand but hesitated and looked up into Sherlock's eyes one more time. The steely grey melted for a long, lingering moment, dissolved in the soft, warm depths.
"A church is only as strong as the spirituality of the people who sustain it," Gerome had said. "Everything else is facade. Flash and show."
"Do you want that?" Sherlock whispered in John's ear, a hot stream of breath. Sherlock's hand in John's hair. "Do you want to sleep with me?"
"Can you carry her? With your leg?" John asked, tearing Sherlock out of his thoughts. The others had already left.
John took her from him and brought her to the kitchen table, settled her in the high chair, tied the bib around her neck, and placed the bowl with the mash in front of her. She ate whatever John spooned into her mouth without any resistance, changing off with the whole wheat crackers and banana slices John had set out for her too, which she stuffed into her mouth with her fingers. She wiggled cheerfully at the same time, laughing at Sherlock.
"Yes. So?"
A brick wall. Two metres high. Sherlock couldn't see the number of the house behind it. But the GPS system on his phone indicated this was number 93. The metal door, painted grey, was locked. No nameplate, no mailbox. A crooked doorbell affixed to the door frame on the left, the cable leading up over the wall. Sherlock pushed it.
John took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He felt the motions of Sherlock breathing at his side, the pressure of his body, the heat radiating from it. He wrapped his arm around Sherlock and held him close. Then he let go again, pulled the blanket all the way up over their heads, and wrapped the heavy wool around both of them. A protective tent covering the two of them. Underneath, he held Sherlock firmly.
Sherlock had accepted the offer to stay at John's place temporarily. It wasn't a decision he'd put much thought into. John had offered and he'd said yes. The heady image of John coming home every evening. Coming to where he was. With Rosie. That the three of them would spend the night together. Banded together. Each in their own bed, but together in the flat. Each within reach of the others.
"With my partner."
"Love me," I pleaded.
"John's at the end of his rope," Molly said out of the blue.
The flight attendant at the gate reached for the microphone. "Doctor John Hamish Watson. Please report to gate 23. Doctor John Hamish Watson," she said, her rich intonation coming through the loudspeakers like a velvety acoustic ribbon being laid on top of the background chatter of the waiting crowd.
"I didn't fall when you left, John. I forgave you a long time ago. I fell when I met Thomas and realised the magnitude of my desire."
"Stay here, John."
I am violently ill. John holds the bucket for me when it overcomes me once more. I gag and cramp up and vomit copiously. I shudder with disgust. The acidic sourness burns my throat, driving tears into my swollen eyes. Watson sits beside me on the bed and doesn't say a word, just holds the bucket for me. It seems to go on forever. My stomach has been empty for a while now, but it keeps regurgitating sour slime and caustic heat. Over and over. My nightshirt is soaked with sweat. I am on the verge of collapsing. I huddle over the bucket and struggle to breathe. Saliva drips from my mouth. Tears run unchecked from my inflamed eyes and likewise fall into the bucket. I touched the monkshood in the garden, rubbed it into my eyes.
John sank down beside him, onto his knees, so careful. Arms wrapped around Sherlock and Rosie. Cautious and gentle. John's breath. John's sobs. A gush of dampness. John's hand running tenderly over Rosie's head, John burying his face in his daughter's hair for a long while. John's hand in Sherlock's sweat-soaked hair, rough now, perhaps clumsy, holding his head as he pressed his forehead to Sherlock's temple. John's breath. John's tears. John's lips, his whole face pressed up against Sherlock's damp skin. A choked "Sherlock," the motion of his lips palpable on his cheek. The flood of tears. John's and his.
THE END
"The apple pie is also from Mrs Hudson."
"I'm not, John." Sherlock tried to speak calmly. "Mary didn't want to burden you with it and asked me to do the same."
John pushed Sherlock away a bit. "What are you doing? We're in public."
*****
"Not yet," Molly replied, "but we're still working on it. The complete report will be delivered to Greg this afternoon. You can look it over there."
John took a deep breath. "Mine," he said.
"We don't know what the motive is," Lestrade shot back darkly.
Sherlock remained silent. Grateful that John didn't expect him to say anything, that John simply held his hand. Everything was topsy-turvy inside him again. His thoughts kept falling through a grate, being shredded before they could fully form. Avoiding all attempts at catching and bundling them. His emotions were dead. Extinct. Sherlock was trying to find them, trying to find anything, but there was nothing.
Then he walked over to Sherlock and held the phone out to him. "It's for you, Mr Holmes.
Sherlock ran his fingers across John's lips, leaned over and kissed him on the tip of his nose, biting it lightly and suckling on it for a moment, chuckling at John's bewildered look.
The first guests arrived in the late afternoon that Saturday, a couple of women from the village with their children. They brought hot coals in a metal bucket, which they placed in the fireplace to bring the village fire into the house. They smoked out the house with sage and drew a small infinity symbol on one of the wooden door posts with chalk. Sherlock and John were told it was a local custom.
He stood there now, his cock stiff and upright, stood directly in front of Sherlock, who sat on the bed, looking up into his eyes.
"A local spice," I say, mixing the pepper into the stew.
John closed his eyes. It was unfair, he knew that himself. "Breaking up IS a solution," he said.
Ever since John wept, since I put my arms around him, since we embraced, it's been easier for us to allow physical contact. But it's only now that John is living with me again that we've become aware of this new thing. There are likely several contributing factors. Rosie, who is still entirely reliant upon physical means of communication, whom we feed and change, bathe, carry around and cuddle. My experience with Eurus. The emotional depths in myself that I've been feeling my way around ever since I remembered Redbeard. Boarded-up pathways that are just now opening. My faith in my own heart. I can no longer deny it, will never be able to deny it again.
"Something like that."
"Because no one knew about the scandal," Sherlock growled. "The church successfully swept it under the rug. It never became public knowledge. There's just that note in 'Inside'. It mentions the
"My mother," Sergej began, "offered some materials from the ISS to North Korea. Delicate stuff, military. But she was stabbed before she could turn them over. They've disappeared. The Koreans must have thought Andrej knew something, and tortured him for it. They threatened to kill you. Then they took me and wanted the information from me. I have access to the ISS project, as you already know."
Sherlock explained that he was there regarding the repair of a wall clock with a pendulum from 1922. It had fallen down.
Sherlock examined the blue eyes in front of him, but they were impenetrable.
John stared at Sherlock's derivations. The mind map. All the layers. Rational. Clear. Cause and effect. There was another truth behind the Chalice, though. John was well aware of it. A deadly tradition over hundreds of years. In every age. A last resort. A last resort for men who had smiled deep into the eyes of other men, who had shared their lust with them. Social ostracism. A dead end. Aberrations of creation. Hopeless. Men who had chosen death. Voluntarily or by force. Alone or in pairs. Death – Martin had said – had been the flip side of homosexual love for centuries.
"You modify your role. We'll do the couples therapy but you tell Dave you hate it, that you don't really want me back."
We start with the neighbour woman who was first at the scene. She says she did not notice anything suspicious either that day or the day before. It wasn't until the Waugh child peeked into the cesspool whilst looking for his cat and started screaming bloody murder that she rushed over and found the dead farmer's wife.
Sherlock pulled John into the narrow service lane between the beehives and the wall of the house, opened one of the boxes and took off the cover board. The honeycomb was visible through the window into the super. Almost half of the cells were capped. Sherlock opened the glass pane straight away. He wasn't wearing gloves or any other kind of protection. The bees didn't seem to be interested in him, maybe they knew his hand, which reached into the super with a meditative peace and attentiveness. Sherlock gently moved a couple of bees aside, scraped a cell open with his fingernail, and caught the liquid that was extruded on his finger.
John extended his fingers hesitantly; he couldn't resist it any longer, touched the black strand of hair on his lover's forehead. Just lightly. A reassurance that this was real. It felt as if he were dreaming. As if he were breathing nothing but light and pure joy. Such was the enchantment which lay over the sleeping man.
John reached for the bony fingers that lay restless in Sherlock's lap, took both hands between his, encircling them with his warmth and the peace that he felt, that seemed to be surrounding them like a blanket. A shell of darkness and comfort, of admissions and a new togetherness.
He held it up in front of John's face. "I know it says 'Sherlock' inside," John grumbled. "I had it in my hands often enough over the past few years, dreaming of wearing it."
Sherlock felt John with his entire body, saw every emotion in those grey eyes. Even the brief shadow of a doubt that gave him pause. Only for a fraction of a second, before longing and desire overcame him with uncontrollable might, he felt John's complaisance and pushed himself into the hot, wet channel, slowly, deeper and deeper, barely able to rein in his hunger for closeness and union, for assimilation and possession, his eyes locked on John's, the lake churning, breath stuttering. Their bodies joined. The lake black. Sherlock lets himself sink into it, his breath coming in fitful jerks, every breath drawing a sound out of the depths, hips moving in desperation. A pause at the edge of the abyss. Hand in hand. Teetering. Fingers interlaced. Heat. Plainsong. Tonic. Safety.
John exhaled and started whistling “We Can Work It Out” by The Beatles as he went in the kitchen to seek for a snack and a glass of water: there was nothing he could do and it was pointless to stay there and twiddle his thumb when Sherlock was buried deep in his mind of genius. Maybe it was the way he had been stressed the whole day (week), but somehow the water tasted as if it was made in heaven; and the way too-old chips like they were the best meal someone could ever have in their life. He heard a “Of course!” coming from the living room and he hasted there. Sherlock was now looking into the bookcases and gesticulating widely at John, who raised both eyebrows in confusion. He was about to question his friend and to ask for explanations, but the detective hushed him as if he was a child who could never stay quiet. John frown and had to physically bite his lower lip to keep himself from speaking up. Once again, he probably would have snapped at Sherlock if he was not so worn out by life in general. Some minutes were spent in absolute silence until a distinct clink echoed. John gasped as the bookcase slowly turned around a revealed a cold black safe that looked like it came from a James Bond movie. It was relatively small, and the lock that held it closed was shining, almost teasing them. Sweat pooled at John's forehead as his hands began to slowly become clammy. Sherlock looked at him and a smile appeared on his lips. A nervous smile, of course, because it was all too serious for jokes or satisfaction for solving a case.
- I completely forgot about these muffins I made earlier! Fortunately you came by and made me think about them.
His phone chose this moment in particular to notify he had a message. He excused himself and took it. “This is doctor Milburgh. Just a message to tell you that, given the circumstances, we are allowed to keep Rosie until tomorrow morning.” He locked it and closed his eyes, huffing a long sigh. He took a glance at his friend and, seeing that she was still waiting for him to continue, curiosity shining in her eyes, he took a deep breath and resumed his tale.
- It doesn't matter anymore anyway, he replied, clearly annoyed to be upheld.
He threw his phone on the couch and let out a frustrated noise as it bounced on a pillow and crashed on the floor. He carefully stepped closer to the floor and picked it up. And okay, it was definitely
John turned around abruptly and was startled to face his best friend, wearing his signature coat and purple scarf. As if everything was completely normal. John was furious. He was completely mad at the whole world, and if Sherlock was at the receiving end of his anger,
) to storm into the room, they were soon faced with a deathly pale Mary, clutching her stomach with her left hand while her right one was gripping the door handle and giving her balance. As John made a move to help her, she threw both friends a helpless and pained look. If John had looked closer into it, if he had not being completely emotions-wiped to face the situation, he would have noticed the flick of a wicked grin. But as it was, John just thought about taking an obviously in labor Mary to the nearest emergency hospital. Sherlock, after a moment of stillness caused by his surprise, spoke to the couple:
- No offense, but spit it out. I am tired and I don't have time to beat about the bush. So...
He got back to the menu screen and a picture of him and Mary at their wedding stared back at him, almost like it knew he was having an internal conflict about them. He furiously locked his phone with a grunt. He would not answer his friend. He would not give him the satisfaction. But he could not help feeling a bit curious. How did Sherlock know about Mary's little disappearances? He could not help feeling like he was missing something, blinded by his love for Mary and his trust in her honesty. His hand grabbed his phone again, without his mind's consent (because apparently his hands did that now) and his fingers independently searched for Sherlock's number and pressed the “call” icon. The phone rang for about one second and a half before the familiar voice of the detective was heard through the phone.
As Sherlock cryptically nodded, John continued, almost shouting out of frustration and panic.
Sherlock smiled and, as Mycroft was about to move away, going back to whatever business he was having, when Sherlock grabbed his arm and stopped him:
He had told her the broad outlines of the matter over a cup of tea and some cookies. She had cried, had apologized to John, and he had not had the strength to tell her all this fussing over him did not really help, quite the opposite if he were to be honest. He offered her a tight smile, swallowing the lump in his throat, and walked away.
- What? What is there to discuss? You betrayed me, played with my feelings when I was the weakest and...
- I am really profusely sorry. We will find her, I promise you. We'll keep you updated and will transmit your number to the authorities.
- But you just said he…
He took a sip of tea then, and picked up a chocolate and blueberry muffin. He turned it around a bit before taking a bite and actually closing his eyes in delight.
- Am I being clear? How is that a difficult question?
He offered her the brightest smile he could manage with the current situation. He must have been pretty convincing, if the blinded grin she gave him back was anything to go by. She made a “oh” sound, like she had forgotten something, and then moved from the threshold so that John could enter the house. He was surprised to see every curtains drawn. However, contrary to the shadowy atmosphere, the place was sparkling clean, as always. He looked around before stepping into Mrs Hudson's little living room and sat on the couch as the old landlady came back from the kitchen with appetizing cakes and streaming tea embalming the whole room with its exquisite smell.
“My name is John Hamish Watson.”
- Mind palace.
- I... came with a car; I can drive you to the ER...
- John! John we have to go!
Or was he?
- Sherlock? What... What is this?
3) he had to get Rosie from the hospital within exactly two hours and twenty-three minutes.
- No... the detective thought. There must be something we didn't see, somewhere we didn't look. But I am sure it's in this house, John. I need to get in my mental palace, he concluded before sitting cross-legged on the parquet, making the old wooden boards, the only things the couple had not renovated, creak.
Until suddenly a Microsoft Word paged filled with numbers appeared. And there it was. Page five out of seven: a letter or a mail or
He threw his phone to the ground with a distressed shout. His back hit the wall and he slided down to the floor, he fisted his hands in his hair and screamed. He screamed with everything he had, the air leaving his lungs. But no one heard him, no one was here to hear him anymore.
As John was about to open the door, Sherlock put a hand on his left arm and warned him:
- I can't believe it. I can't believe you!
- I can't even argue with the two of you, he tightly said, his lips pressing together.
- You can always leave her to me, John, I hope you know that.
John glared at Sherlock and Sherlock glared at John. The only thing you could hear was the familiar ticking of the old clock. It was weird, this atmosphere between them, and even the overconfident Sherlock Holmes seemed to realize it as his gaze faltered before he resumed his explanation.
has been transferred
- You would have just told me to stop what I…
This was all Sherlock's fault anyway. They could have been just great without him taking drugs because he could not face reality. They would have been perfect.
Watson did not wait the older man's answer before walking away, angry at the whole world. Molly was still working on the analysis in the lab and Sherlock was sleeping after having woken up for about one minute and a half. Mary was sitting on an armchair Molly brought her so that she would not get tired with her baby belly. Her eyes crossed his and he turned away. He did not know if he was really mad at her anymore, but right now he would have snapped against whoever stood in his way. He thought back to the whole day. When he had woken up that morning, it was to say goodbye to his best friend who would leave to Serbia on a “mission”. He left on that plane with a false smile on his face and fear in his eyes. But John was blinded back there. His reconciliation with Mary was still fresh and fragile, and he did not really get the point of everything. Not when it mattered. “He wasn't suppose to come back”, Mycroft had said later, much later. It wasn't a mission, it was a suicide. A
He cut the call without hearing Mycroft's answer, but he must have been convincing because soon enough they were the only car on the streets. The only thing you could see in miles in the starless night were two highlights; Mary's scream to only thing you could hear. It was Thursday and everyone was sleeping at home. It was somehow beautiful, the emptiness of the city. But John did not get the time to admire London's stillness, as if it was holding its breath for them, for they soon caught a glimpse of the gigantic building that is St Mary's hospital. The structure was like a dark lump elevating in the cloudy sky. The breaks squealed, and John hurried out of the car, taking Mary by her arm and leading her inside the hospital.
- I know, he tried to sound convinced, but it obviously did not work as Sherlock glanced at him for several seconds, his eyes almost shut, analyzing him.
- Yes but now I can actually make you a nice cup of tea and we can catch up!
After the reception, everyone left very quickly, of course. Nobody really wanted to be here anyway, they were all doing it for John's sake. He was grateful. Sherlock and him were the only ones left: the detective leaning on an old tomb, John holding a peacefully sleeping Rosie in his arms and looking at the flawless baby. His daughter, who would grow up without a mother. Yet she was perfect, so beautiful. John thought back to everything that could have happened to her, and felt immense relief flow through him. He was grateful. Both friends were interrupted when somebody approached them, holding a file in their hands. Mycroft, of course. His brother was already next to him when John joined them. Sherlock glanced at him, concern written on his face, a frown slowly making its way between his eyebrows. Sherlock cared, and John was happy someone still did. He was grateful.
- Well, actually…
- I'll come back when things have settled down a little, John said as he was standing on Molly's threshold.
- I don't think you understand the extent of this, Sherlock.
Mary was on the bed, half reading
- Yes, and we looked around Sherlock. There was nothing. There
- You didn't listen to what I just said! I said James was dead, but not Moriarty. At least I'm almost sure it isn't.
- You wish! John half-joked.
- I'm sorry you had to see this doctor Watson.
- No, I've waited enough for a lifetime. Beside, she could come back any time and, if she is part of this, and I'm really starting to think she is, she won't let us compromise her situation by blowing her cover.
- The game is on, Sherlock murmured so low John was not sure it actually happened.
John would have laughed if he did not have to be absolutely silent to, you know, stay alive. Usual business. "Don't worry, I already called Lestrade; Scotland Yard is sending him with twenty men. SH". John kept himself from answering but felt immense relief wash through him: the law was on their side. Mycroft was already an assurance of safety (kind of), but Scotland Yard meant legal, recognized, clean. There would not any problems regarding Mary's arrest if they had the police on their side.
- Can we, like, not talk about that? he said while rubbing his temples with his indexes.
- That's not even the point Sherlock! You… In a few hours, I'll be a father and...
- She is missing.
by Robert Harris, half typing on her phone, probably to Janine. The pregnancy was coming to an end now, the baby would be born within two months. John was delighted of course, but he was also very nervous. And as much as people told him it was perfectly normal,
- Always the selfish one, John. Does it really matter?
- I was here the other day, remember?
- We have things to do John! Cases to solve! Come along!
- This, John, is a map of London.
- Yeah, well, some of us actually sleep at night, he half-lied.
- No. I did not love you, even if you are quite lovable, I have to admit. But, as you probably know, the job matters the most. I can't get involved with feelings.
- What? Which day? John confusedly asked.
Mycroft probably was not very keen on helping as Sherlock replied to his brother with an irritated voice.
- You wouldn't have believed me otherwise John.
- Whatever, John. Just call if you need anything. Bye.
- Spare me John, we both know you're lying to yourself. Here is the truth: Mary is not home, she is not answering her phone and she is an ex assassin. Even the foulest man in the world wouldn't ignore those signs. And you are not, bless me, the stupidest.
- Have you transferred everything?
He bent down and took a muffin before making a move to go out of the flat. It was then that John remembered a detail he had not communicated to his friend, blinded by his (misdirected?) fury.
- Sherlock! We were just waiting for you to start the show!
brother, he answered full of sarcasm.
He sat on the red false velvet sofa and wiped his eyes. He was
- Answer. My. Question.
- Okay. Well, then you know what to do.
Entering Baker Street again felt strange, like both friends were suddenly aware of everything again: the fall, the wedding, the overdose... The flat felt like a bubble ready to implode. Mrs Hudson had been very nice to John, but he could see that even she blamed him for not visiting earlier, for letting Sherlock recover on his own for over a week. But he did not get the time to dwell on it as the detective dragged him to the living room and pushed him on a chair. He then himself went to the opposite armchair and sat, crossing his hands under his chin and staring at John.
- Or get really drunk before a case, which is very…
- My wife is going to give birth! he shouted as soon as the automatic glass doors closed behind him.
John was about to argue, but Sherlock did not leave him the time to as he resumed talking, now addressing to Mary.
- Mary, or should I say Moriarty? he answered, venom slipping out of his voice.
He stood up from his perfectly comfortable couch and strode to his room, leaving the detective to wait for him just a little more.
- John? Do you have questions?
He was particularly touched by Sherlock's attempt at lighting the atmosphere, and was even more grateful when it turned out it worked. A little, but it worked. However, they were soon snapped back to reality as Sherlock brought his left hand to the lock and began entering the combination he (of course) knew by heart, somehow. They waited, holding their breath, until finally, to John's relief and anguish, the lock clicked open. Both friends stayed still for at least thirty seconds before Sherlock moved to open the safe, but John stopped him and took his place.
- Sherlock? What are you doing in my living room? John cut him off with an exasperated sigh.
, honestly.
- What?
- “UK”. United Kingdom, John murmured.
- Hello doctor Watson? The voice of a stranger came through the phone.
- Destroying me, John.
“She was here”, John heard the words from the bathroom and almost bolted to his friend. And there, before his eyes, was standing the proof of Mary's presence in the house earlier today: water drops were slowly dripping from the shower head, steam fading but still tangible on the mirror, a damp towel hanging from the rail. There was also the distinct smell of coconut shampoo still lingering in the air. John inhaled and shut his eyes. When he reopened them, Sherlock was looking at him with concern-filled eyes. The doctor shrugged before going forward, going past his friend and the questions the detective probably had and went back to the living room.
manual? His wife was looking at him with eyes full of questions. He met her eyes before lowering his head and answering her silent interrogation.
- Amazing snow globe you have here, John! Look at all the details of the Eiffel Tower, you can almost see yourself there. I really…
- The video then. It has been recorded before Jim's death, of course. I reckon even you can get that. But someone broad casted it. Someone is playing with us. Someone is walking in Jim's steps. It can be anyone but I think this is way bigger than everything we assumed. I don't believe Moriarty is dead.
- Hello?
When the plane turned back, he smiled. Beyond his different feelings, madness, betrayal and pain, he was relieved. For the first time since the Magnussen story began, he felt like maybe things could go back to being fine, like maybe it would not be so bad anymore. His best friend would not leave, his wife would stop her illegal activities and they would talk, they would be okay. They had to be, it was written, it was how things
- Just breathe with me Mary. One… Two… Three, he counted, taking exaggerated inhales.
- Hum? John told him in a what he hoped as a “go on” tone.
- You know what? I'm seriously starting to doubt that.
He slided the lock out of its loop and slowly opened the safe with trembling hands. There was no turning back now, no fixing this. What he was about to see could probably never be repaired. He took a deep breath and glanced at the safe. Shining silver mirrored in his eyes. A laptop. John's blood ran cold and turned to ice as he was faced with the truth: truth about Mary, Moriarty, John's wedding. They were about to discover the truth of a false life John had been convinced was real for so long. Sherlock made a move to take the computer, and John let him. He was frozen in place anyway, unable to move a muscle. The detective carefully stepped out of the recess holding the laptop to his chest after having checked it for explosives. As John lost sight of his friend, he sighed and released a whimper before walking back to the living room, where Sherlock was patiently waiting for him, the damned laptop now resting on his knees. John took a trembling breath before sitting next to him and moving his hand in what he hoped was a “go on” motion. Sherlock seemed to pick up on it, anyway, as he began working on the pass code. It took him two minutes to figure it out, of course. And the sequence of letters and numbers which held no meaning would probably be inked in John's spirit forever. 927T828HHB. It was weird, so impersonal, so unfamiliar for John, so different from the Mary he loved and knew who always would invoke sentiment for whatever she did. But then again, he certainly only knew the shell of a woman, the appearances, the mask she wanted him to believe was genuine. He had been fooled, from the beginning. It hurt so much, scarred at his heart and mind, hit at his trust. He realized then that he was not ready to face reality. Unfortunately, whether he was ready or not was no longer a concern, as the desk of the device appeared before both of their dumbfounded eyes. There were only two files on it: AGRA and MLONUK. They already knew what “AGRA” meant: Mary's teammates names, like a family of assassins recruited by some organization beyond the government.
- It's been so long since you last visited, darling, she squealed.
- Don't you think I have tried? Mycroft said with anger in his voice.
His outburst was cut short by the door opening again; They had moved to the dining room where Sherlock was gesticulating widely, not giving a damn about the China vases he threatened to knock down with every movement. But when they heard the distinct noise of the key turning in the lock, and the door cracked open once again, they both stilled. John's blood ran cold when he heard it being shut with great strength and he closed his eyes, trying (in vain) to control his ragged breath.
The light that welcomed him as he opened the door almost blinded him, his eyes having just adapted to the darkness of the cabinet. The wind was whipping his face, the cold biting at him in this twelve March's afternoon. And there, at the edge of the roof, looking into the void expanding below them. She had her back at him, her signature flashy red coat flying behind her.
- “M” like Moriarty, “LON” as in London, Sherlock guessed, and…
- My brother have always been an addict. He always will be. There is nothing you or me or anyone else can do.
- You think you can stop me Sherlock? You think you can stop this? Have you not realized yet that this is way bigger than everything you could have ever imagined? she snapped back, extending her hand in a showing motion at the city that expended below them.
- My men searched the flat. I believe it's clear, weirdly enough. Are you gonna tell me what's wrong?
- A safe… Sherlock repeated. Then, as if struck by lighting: A safe! He shouted as he stormed out of the flat.
So yeah, he probably should have thought it through before downing three bottles of whiskey. When he had woken up, it was to a pounding headache that felt like a hammer was hitting his skull again and again. He had groaned before processing where he was, and what he and Sherlock had discovered yesterday. Sadness flooded through him, his core being shaken by a pathetic cry as his heart felt like someone was crushing it in his fist; it hurt to breathe. It felt like he was drowning, desperately crawling and swimming in the dark and infinite sea, never reaching the shore. He sighed and went to the kitchen, grabbing a coffee he downed in exactly thirty seconds and cooking some scrambled eggs. They were good, but not as tasty as Mary did them.
He reopened Sherlock's conversation, the detective's unanswered message filling him with bile, and typed furiously yet weakly. “How did you know about the snow globe and why on earth didn't you mentioned it before?”. He quickly left the messaging application before changing his mind and hesitantly typed another message to the mysterious number.
- The curtain rises, Sherlock, Mary whispered over the wind, like it was bending to her voice.
- We can open it now or wait if you'd rather… Sherlock asked, sensibility so out of character.
He closed his eyes and sighed. This day was never going to end.
- It doesn't matter anymore.
It felt like the world had stopped turning, like time was frozen. The letter was one of many, and above it was one from a so called Tony to Jim, and above that one from Franz to Bill. It was a record. A record of all the archives of the organization in Great Britain. It was terrifying, mind blowing, heart-wrenching. Sherlock had been right: it was sway bigger than any of them had imagined. John's head started spinning faster and faster and the next thing he knew he was laying on the couch, a cushion under his arms which held his hand. He vaguely heard the faint voice of Sherlock on the phone: “I am asking you to watch out for Mary's move. Find her and track her. I need to know where she is at every moment of the day”. Then, a pause as who John guessed was Mycroft answered on the other line. And at last Sherlock hung up with a “I'll send you everything”. John heard footsteps and then Sherlock was back in the room, talking to someone. John frowned as he realized he was the one addressed and tried (and half failed) to listen to his friend.
And then the door slammed shut and John was alone again, in the deep maze that was his mind at the moment, everything mixing until nothing made sense. He did not cry, he just felt numb, empty, like he had been drained of every feeling, of every emotion. He was not angry, nor distraught, nor particularly surprised. He was nothing at all. Only one word made it through the thick fog of his thoughts: lie. Everything he had been told was a lie, his life was a lie. Eventually, John got up from the sofa to the kitchen. He opened a cupboard and took a bottle of whiskey. He would cry tomorrow, he would start thinking about the future tomorrow. Tonight, he would drink. Quickly, one bottle turned to two then to three, and the last thing John saw before blacking out was the bright light coming from the laptop still on the coffee table, staring at him and judging, probably. Because for the first time in years, John Watson let go of all reason. Nothing mattered anymore anyway, except for the numbness to stop, for life to stop, just for a little while.
He nodded and hoped Sherlock somehow understood his answer, somehow. He was tired already, and he was frightened, if he were to be honest. He was about to hang up as Sherlock said one last thing that warmed his heart and in a way made him believe he could be alright, even after this.
Nobody answered as Lestrade kept looking for them. It felt like they were in another universe, like in a bubble they had built from rage and anguish and outsmarting one another.
- Your wife has disappeared. When the nurse came to her room to check on the baby, she was gone and the window was opened wide. We don't know how or when she left, but nobody has seen her since. We already called the police department, but they haven't found anything yet… I am so sorry, Sir.
- What? I don't understand, John said, dread filling his bones.
- I heard everything, as usual. We need to go John; she might be anywhereand we
- I am sorry it ha to come to this, John, you know I would have rather any other way…
I sat there shaking in front of the fireplace in the dark, fearing and hoping in equal measure that Watson would come. I was afraid he would be so deluded and forlorn as I and come here. I hoped he would be so stupid and blind as I and truly do it. And I suspected that I would not have the strength to survive either course of action. I sat there numb and fearful, chiding myself a thousand times over for being so sick; a madman.
John's gaze, lingering. Deep and penetrating. Sherlock's pulse was racing. Heat rose from his groin and spread throughout his body. He longed to put his arms around John. But he didn't. He closed his eyes, removed himself from the situation. John's hand on his good arm. Warm and gentle.
"Sorry, but no. I've been through too many Holmesian games before. I'm done. I want to live MY life, got it?"
A hand-held spotlight hung on the wall next to the old, dark wooden door leading to the chapel. Gerome took it down before opening the door. A puff of damp, stuffy air billowed out at John. Gerome shone the light down the steep stone staircase leading into the narrow vault.
"Peace be with you, my brothers," a low, gentle voice said finally. "I'm sorry, but the church is closed. You can't pray here at this time of night."
"Yes," he finally said. "I don't want things to stand between us that might endanger this new thing we've started."
"I don't know how to accept a present like this, Sherlock," John said.
They left. Lestrade, the security guard, and the nurses. Sherlock and John stayed behind.
A strange topic beween men who had desperately fought every single second, for years, to preserve life.
John ate the omelet he'd prepared in the tiny kitchen, a salad too, drank a glass of wine. He checked over his new identification documents, made out to the name of John Horton, committed his fake life story to memory. He washed up, put away the dishes. He'd wanted to watch television, but ended up lying down on the bed and staring at the ceiling. Night had fallen outside, the skylight was black. The flat smelled foreign. The sounds from the nearby street. The gentle hiss of the heating and water. A television was on somewhere. He would have liked to send Sherlock a text. Just two words. That he'd arrived. That everything was fine. But he couldn't. Call him. Hear his voice. John took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He missed him.
"When they're in love," he replied.
"The ideal bait," John corrected him.
That was the first devastating conclusion. It was devastating because I hungered for those eyes from the first moment onward. They were full of life and emotion. They were full of those things I did not have. I did not understand until later that I was the one who triggered all of that in him. John had a way of laughing, of thinking, of attending to me that thoroughly and utterly won me over. He changed my life completely. He taught me to feel. He introduced my soul to flight, my mind to stillness. He taught my body to surrender itself and lit a fire in my heart. Dr John Hamish Watson was anything but harmless. He made me into a man who loved, but who was also lost. He gave me a heaven whose underside was hell.
Sherlock was weeping freely. Martin waited. John didn't know whether Martin had taken Sherlock into his arms, comforting him.
The naked man didn't respond. His breaths came in heaving gasps. But he allowed Conley to take a couple of steps in his direction, pick up the torn cassock from the floor, and wrap it around his body. Then Father Conley knelt down in front of the altar without another word and began to pray in a low, steady voice:
Sherlock sat down on a rock, and John found a seat too. They looked out over Lake Brienz, a turquoise green surface glowing far below. To the west was Lake Thun. In between them Interlaken. Directly opposite the Rothorn. Clouds were coming up in the west. The weather could turn that night. Evening thermals blew down the mountain to the valley, rippling through the grass and flowers.
"What should I do with these?"
Sherlock. Sherlock was missing. John knew it precisely at the same moment Martin asked. John bit his lips. He didn't answer. He was seized by a sense of bewilderment. Bewilderment and an unexpectedly painful longing for Sherlock. Sherlock. His presence was so strong. Sherlock. John fancied that if he reached out his hand, he could touch Sherlock in the darkness of the room.
"I'm going to play the violin a while and think," Sherlock said. "Maybe later."
They watched each other. Sherlock felt himself trembling inside. His heart was thudding so hard he could feel it. Such a struggle. So much effort to ask for a bit of time from this man with whom he'd shared so much. Hours, months, years. Day and night.
"Why did she have Mary taken to Holloway?" Sherlock repeated his question. He was furious. "And where is the child, for Christ's sake!"
"Give me some time, John," Sherlock had answered without looking up from his computer. "It's not that easy for me either, you know. I need some more distance."
"What are you thanking me for?" John asked.
"Good." Sherlock turned to the security guard. "Do you think you can do a sketch?"
Ethan put the cup back down on the saucer without letting it go, without looking up.
Celine came out of the cabin, joined the two men at the wooden table again, set out a plate with the nut tart on it. She'd cut it into small, bite-sized pieces.
"They were the worst two months of my life," Sherlock whispered. "But you waited two years for me."
"It needs to be injected intravenously within the first twenty minutes," Sherlock said. "After that it's too late."
"She came and went here as she pleased. Don't you remember? She always gets what she wants."
John let Sherlock shuffle him over to the bed, took off his shoes, trousers, jumper and shirt. He lay down, numb and overwhelmed, crawled under the blankets. Sherlock had already taken the key back to use the toilet, had forced him to eat some of the soup. John had let him. Sherlock's explanations had made sense, somehow, and ended up placating him after a while. Irene Adler was dying. The duplicity would end with her death. Sherlock's words ran circles in John's head.
"We sought sanctuary in Benedict," Sherlock whispered. John could have sworn that his voice sounded broken.
"Was Luke with you at the Rosenfeld Centre?"
Sherlock broke off his playing. Dumbfounded, but still confident enough to reach for a pen and write down the sequence of notes. Inspired. Sherlock played through what he'd written. The lines striving upwards through several attempts. The threshhold. The consciousness of what was perceivable. No, this melody was not sweet. It was austere, yet tender. It wasn't without questions, not without doubt, not without fear. A heartbeat pulsed in the background. And even as Sherlock played, he knew that this wasn't all. There was more. He closed his eyes, let the instrument find its own way, let it sing, let it express what he was undergoing, what he was feeling, what he saw and knew.
"They fixed up her corpse. And it is a corpse. The people here are able to determine that. And the surveillance cameras recorded what happened in the cell at 9:27 this morning."
Sherlock reacted with alarm. "You're distancing yourself," he said, visibly shaken. "Why?"
"A doctor," Sherlock said.
"I know."
"It's the essence," he whispered. His voice almost failed him.
"Sherlock! What should I do?"
"Please sign in here while you wait, sir. I'll have someone call Dr Salisbury."
There was a knock at the living room door. Mrs Hudson stood in the doorway holding a tray with tea and biscuits. A surge of wild fury pulsed through Sherlock.
Sherlock strode briskly toward the front. To the left of the sanctuary was a passage leading to a side chapel, a tight, arched walkway about five metres long, whitewashed like everything else, straight and narrow and just high enough for a man to comfortably walk through it. A red and white plastic crime scene tape blocked the entrance to the chapel. Sherlock stepped over it without pausing. John followed him.
The cottage was cold, damp, and abandoned. John lit the fire in the hearth first off and made tea. Sherlock put the bags on the table with the groceries they'd bought in London. They drank tea and ate a few biscuits in silence. Then John went upstairs, showered and got into bed. It was only afternoon, but he was dead tired. Tired and reflective. The trip lingered in his bones, the events of the past days and weeks weighing on him heavily.
11 a.m. Still no message from John.
"Thank you, Mrs Hudson. Very kind of you, but not necessary."
"Fine. I'll report back."
"You're expected," he said and opened the door.
John pointed to himself with a questioning expression.
Rosie gaped at him a moment before crying some more.
Calum fell silent, appeared to be thinking. He sat on the hard chair in the interrogation room, his hands on the table in front of him. He looked calm and collected.
"You belong to me," John said, shocking himself as he heard the words come out of his mouth.
Waited. Took a sip of whiskey. The darkness outside. No headlamps, no car. No gravel crunching beneath any tyres. John entered Mycroft's number, let it ring for a long time. No voice mail. Good. Very good!
The Constable slides the saddle forward and helps John to mount. I allow myself to be hoisted up behind the saddle and cling fast to John. The Inspector rides ahead. The Constable walks at the rear. He will arrive at the scene somewhat later.
John sat in his bed, leaning back against the headboard, and listened to the footsteps recede. Sherlock went slowly down the stairs and into the living room. John wasn't sure at first whether he should just turn off the light and go to sleep. But he felt lonely. Abandoned. The abrupt ending. It hurt and it felt wrong.
"We found these in the dead man's flat." Lestrade pushed another piece of paper toward Sherlock. "This is the list of contacts from his computer and phone. We've gone through everything. He called the same number several times in the period before the attack. The number isn't registered. We haven't found out who it belongs to."
"Be reasonable, John. It's midnight. It's raining. The creek drains the entire massif and carries huge quantities of water. The gorge is dangerous. You can't go there now. We'll do it in the morning. As soon as it gets light."
"Fine," John sighed.
"We will do what your body demands, as often and as regularly as necessary, so that it does not reach a point of crisis. It will become accustomed to being satisfied at any time, and thus develop patience."
They went upstairs a little later. The new shower worked perfectly. They crawled into Sherlock's bed in the midst of shelving, bags, moving boxes and crates. The upstairs rooms weren't set up yet. A bare bulb hung from the ceiling. When they turned it off, it was pitch black. Pitch black and utterly silent. No cars, no subway, no people, no street lights, no blinking neon signs. Nothing. Absolute blackness.
John pulled the cloth through the instrument and cleaned the key mechanism.
"You're not asleep yet," Sherlock said uncertainly.
is Real, we know neither our self nor the chaos that awaits us.
John closed his eyes and simply waited. Martin ran both hands down Sherlock's back, John could feel that much. And then he felt Sherlock relaxing. The temperature rose between them. Sherlock's heart rate increased, became faster and faster. He panted lightly against John's neck. John could feel Sherlock's heart beating hard and fast against his chest and tugged his friend closer, a signal that it was all right. Everything. Including the arousal that seized their bodies, both of them, the fire in their loins, making their genitals swell and press against each other. Sherlock burrowed into John, his fingers digging into John's back, grasping at his hair. He writhed and gasped. He clung to John, and John to him.
"No. We'd just scare her into hiding. Are you thinking of John?" Rose asked, turning to Sherlock.
"I met Irina many years ago," John replied. "She was a beauty. Andrej fell in love with her."
I cannot help but admire him for the way he thinks and what he is. What he is to me as well. A strong and intrepid friend. And a loving partner in all these things that unsettle me so greatly.
The woman shook her head. "We didn't find anyone. Two of his coworkers from the institute were here, and one from the club. They didn't know anything either. But Mr Combs did regain consciousness for a short while and said a name: John. The police thought that meant you."
"We have a common past and I like him. That's all."
"John!" Sherlock whispered urgently into his phone.
"Should we go down to the elm tree?" John asked.
We performed the actual act off the bed, as our movements transferred to the bedstead and from there to the wooden floor. My Doctor stabilised himself by holding fast to the ceiling beam while I moved inside him, stirred by my passion. My hands stroked the raw wood, then John's skin, both aroused and irritated by the difference in the textures, the strange roughness and the warm softness. Overwhelmed by the unrestrained lust in my loins.
Sherlock had come to the train station with him, an unexpected gesture; perhaps an expression of his unease or concern. They'd stood face to face in front of the gate, hadn't known what to say, given the situation. They'd stood there, facing each other and not known how to go their separate ways. They'd lost track of time. Sherlock had just stood there, closed off, his hands deep in his coat pockets. Their eyes locked on each other. John had opened himself to his friend's gaze, and seen his affection.
They were both familiar with those final sentences from John's journal.
The club was on the outskirts of town. A typical country estate. Light-coloured, natural masonry. A tiled roof with gables. Latticework windows. A massive chimney on the gabled side. The facade overgrown with ivy. A gravel courtyard in front of the house. The gardens surrounding it. They were smaller than John had thought they would be. No walls, open, not even a fence around the patch of land. The transition from countryside to garden was so subtle, it was like entering a park without being aware of it. John approached from the east, past a goldfish pond fed by a brook, and realised he was already in the Lover's water garden. He was too early and turned back, went out into the evening fields. Moisture was already gathering in the nearby forest.
'The dungeon of subconscious fears,' was what Eurus had called it.
John took a deep breath and lowered his gaze, surprised at the disappointment evident in Sherlock's voice. Then he looked up into his friend's eyes.
"I know. You're still not going to Bury."
Sherlock snorted and rolled his eyes. Then he grabbed John roughly by the bicep and dragged him quickly and indiscriminately into room 209.
"Have a seat," he said without any further greeting.
"He told me."
"All right." Their eyes still locked on each other, John asked, "What's it about?"
"I'm so pleased to meet you. John's told me of your special talents. And I've read your 'Art of Deduction'. Quite an interesting approach, I must say. Heidegger himself said that true listening and observation are a kind of worship. But come on in first!"
"Isn't it Sunday?" Sherlock asked.
John had glanced at Sherlock's screen and been surprised to see that he was typing in Cyrillic. Fluently. He appeared to be writing something in a Russian email program.
"Tell me about him," Ella said.
"I know. I'm going to take advantage of his absence," Sherlock said. "Can you show me his office?"
John grinned. "He was so excited. I think he wants to perform the variations. I already said he should talk to you about it. I just want to be able to play them. I don't have anything else to do with it." John raised both hands meaningfully. Then he smiled, put one hand on Sherlock's back and pressed his lips to Sherlock's temple for a second, a fleeting endearment as he passed by him on his way to the stairs.
Sherlock's fingertips stroked his chest, caressed his nipples, cautiously explored John's body, inspecting him. John watched Sherlock's face, bewitched by the emotions there, the concentration, the process of discovery, the amazement, the act of experiencing, the helplessness in the face of what it was doing to him. His parted lips, his deep, slow, lustful breaths, his glazed eyes.
"You know Moriarty?"
Speculation on ritualistic Celtic festivals. Magical tracings and ornaments. Photographs of archaeological finds. Brooches. Needles. Daggers. Bones. On the next shelf down was something covered in a cloth. John cautiously unwrapped it. It was an incense burner. Used, apparently, but cleaned afterwards. It held cloth sacks with herbs and resins. John took pictures, wrapped the vessel back up in the cloth and put it back. The computer was password-protected. Of course. What else had he expected. John rummaged around in the desk and the surrounding area, looking for clues to the password, checked the filing trays. Nothing. Not a chance.
After the Boons' arrest, Inspector Schofield, Watson and I searched their house. It's something I am good at. I know how the criminal mind works. If there is something to find, I will find it. It was scarcely a matter of seconds to recognise that there was something off with the drawer of the dresser. And it was immediately clear what that was: it was too shallow. I pulled it out and reached behind it into the depths of the commode, found the small wooden box and pulled it out. It contained a few pieces of jewellery. And a contract. A simple, informal piece of writing which was still a valid contract in the eyes of the law. It was signed by both of them: Alistair Boon and James Waugh and set out the property situation between the two families, should Pauline Boon and James Waugh marry.
"Father Rafe Conley," Sherlock corrected him. "He saw John at both crime scenes and could unmask him. He's a suspect. That might be a risk."
"That won't work," John said. "We may see each other now and again, for a couple of days somewhere in the world. We may sleep together. But we won't have a life together anymore. We won't share anything. We'll be lonely, we'll lose that closeness. You'll die somewhere out there and I won't even know it."
"Do you have a mind palace for personal things?" John asked.
"Nor to me."
John closed his eyes. Neither of them spoke. Just stood there in the kitchen, wrapped tightly around each other.
John simply said, "I'm back."
"No."
There was a petrol station at the port that was cheaper than anything else around, Nikita said, and pulled over. John got out. The air jangled with cold, clawing sharply into his hair. Hard, dry snowflakes whipped into his face. John promptly pulled the hood up over his head and turned his back to the wind, which pressed his hood against the back of his head, forming a shell against whose outward face the snowflakes rustled as they flew past. The warmth of his breath created clouds of steam in front of his face. Moisture gathered, clogging up his senses. The world as if through cotton. Everything cut off. Reliant only on himself. No sense of direction. Everything white. The Lena a desert, the port an abandoned, ghostly backdrop.
There was a bench free underneath a willow tree. Sherlock went over to it and sat down. He reached into the breast pocket of his suit jacket and took out his mobile phone. No messages from John. It still wasn't three yet.
Half an hour later, when they'd finally forced themselves to end the call, sleep was the furthest thing from Sherlock's mind. He lay on the couch, staring at the ceiling, his eyes wide open. It felt as if he were in a trance and couldn't be sure of his own thoughts. Something huge had just happened. He and John had cracked open their friendship. What came next was the adventure of a lifetime. It was going to hurt, Sherlock knew that. But he was prepared to risk it. He was prepared to go through all the insecurity and pain, even if it frightened him.
"I'm seeing him this afternoon," Sherlock replied. He rapidly made his way out of the morgue and decided not to hear Molly's "He loves you, Sherlock."
John smiled. He bent over to the girl without taking his hand off Sherlock's arm, not breaking their contact.
Sherlock felt the quivering in John's body and realised there were no more barriers, they could love each other without constraints, in a physical sense as well, here in their shared flat, secure, unobserved, a private matter between the two of them, their own responsibility, no explanations owed to anyone. Free. No barriers. Responsibility. Panic overcame him.
"Take the key, John."
"You were right," Sherlock said as they sat on the bench as dusk began to fall. "Dave didn't seem to care about the couples therapy."
"No. He said you needed him. I assumed he went to see you."
Sherlock stopped in his tracks in surprise. He came to a full stop right there on the staircase, cutting off the momentum with which he'd been running up the stairs. He stood perfectly still. A flageolet? High and clear. In the flat at 221B Baker Street? Impossible. The next tone – a different one – blown too hard, the onset soft. Then the tone caught hold, swelled briefly before moving on to a delicate pianissimo. And now he could hear that it was a clarinet playing – Sherlock could hardly believe it – the opening notes of the theme of his variations. In a clear, confident tone. Sherlock listened, baffled. The warm sound, sustained by breath. The melody he'd carried with him in his heart for so long, that he'd worked on for so long, that was so closely tied to his emotions, his soul, his most intimate feelings. That oh so familiar melody. And this foreign, timbred, aloof, dark, emotional sound. The clarinet. Mid-register. Astonishing. Confusing. He shivered. Goosepimples spread across his skin. It was coming from upstairs. From John's room.
Sherlock lowered his head. And there in the midst of the crowded bar, his forehead touched John's. A cautious experiment. John leaned his forehead against his friend's. Deliberate, no chance of it being a coincidence. They rested against each other, forehead to forehead. Their breath between them. Heat. Togetherness. A closed-off space of mutual awareness. The noise of the club room fading away. Everyone else shut out. Just the two of them. Breathing. John closed his eyes. Sherlock's scent. His hand. Closeness. Sherlock.
Sherlock held John's hands still, tried to stop the caresses. But it was too late. They both knew it. They couldn't go back. Didn't want to. They lay in each other's arms, their cheeks pressed together, breathing hotly.
"John," he said.
A shiver ran through Sherlock's body, and he paused. Their eyes met. Sherlock's pupils were large, his eyes dark and flooded with arousal. John gazed into them, overwhelmed by the wave of heat between them, by the raw desire for this man. Sherlock was beautiful. So beautiful. Those eyes. Good God! Their hands wrapped around each other. They held each other fast and looked at each other for a long time.
They'd believe him. A wounded, traumatised field chaplain taking the first tentative steps back into the safe haven of the civilian church. Seeking a new mission, a new life. He'd be forgiven if he didn't remember every single word of the liturgy. War demanded other priorities.
John thought for a moment, then shook his head. "No."
"Fine. I'll see what I can do."
It was really an absurd image. As if the body had been prepared and now lay in state. But it hadn't been moved a single millimetre. Stean had died here, in his alb, the crucifix in his hand, his eyes closed, his jaw bound shut. His body was unblemished. No sign of a violent death.
"So? We'll simply act as if we're praying all day and all night. If we must."
"You understand nothing of power, John. Moriarty is both brilliant and powerful. It's better to cooperate with people like that and keep them in check that way than to pick a quarrel with them the way my stupid little brother does." Mycroft was clearly angry.
"Odd. Can you go to the club and look through the list of members, John? I need all the names from back then. Plus or minus two years. I'll be at the Constabulary. We'll meet at Linda's."
"Aren't you Dr Watson?" the man asked cautiously.
"Are all of the rituals held in this church?" Sherlock asked.
"Fine. Four eyes are certainly better than two, two statements better than one," John said. It sounded cool and professional. The armour in his chest was heavy but impenetrable. Good.
They struggled their way through the Mass ordinary, prayed through it on their knees. John translated the ancient Latin texts for Sherlock, explaining what they were about. They sat on the floor, on top of the woollen blankets, sometimes on the steps of the steep staircase. They walked around the shadowy room, moving to warm themselves up as they talked. Sherlock seemed to start to enjoy analysing the unfamiliar texts, even if he was mostly picking them apart and comparing them with other data in his mind palace, rather than simply accepting them. Whenever one of the other priests was there, he switched modes and became as pious as a lamb.
That went too far for John, and his reply was defiant: "I don't think that's relevant here."
"See you soon," he said, affection in his voice.
He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. (Matthew 12:30)
Sherlock nodded uncertainly. John was standing here, standing right in front of him, and Sherlock didn't know what to say to him. All these things about children were so foreign to him. He was still standing at the window.
"No. That will just alarm the kidnappers, make them nervous and needlessly endanger the child. Wait a bit," Sherlock said.
"Is there any proof? I mean, how does this professor of yours know the treasure is in the hands of Chaeronea?"
"What then?"
"I'd like to speak to Steffen Boyd," Sherlock said.
John shook his head. "No, Sherlock," he said. "No. We're letting ourselves be manipulated. We're controllable through our..." John considered whether to use the word 'love', but then said, "… relationship. We're proving exactly the point that you always made, which is that our emotions make us weak. But that's wrong, Sherlock. It's not our emotions that make us weak. They make us strong. It's our insecurity about them that makes us controllable."
"Are you coming?"
"Of course. Do you know whether the brotherhood still exists?"
"Yeah," was all John said to that. "Let's go home."
"A consequence of secret conspiracies and complicated cover stories," Sherlock elaborated. "At some point, the ones in the know disappear unexpectedly, and no one knows anymore. What remains is an internal ritual of passing things on, the purpose of which no one is aware of. And no one asks. No one. The gems were simply passed on. For centuries."
"He's still a friend, isn't he?" Sherlock pressed, his eyes fixed firmly on his screen and his fingers still moving.
A long, searching look. Sherlock had sat down after a brief hesitation without waiting for a reply. John had closed his eyes for a moment. Warmth. The sounds of people eating and chatting in the background. His own calmness. He'd opened his eyes then, wanting to say something but didn't, instead mutely gazing into that icy blue. The waiter had come and Sherlock had ordered an omelet too. He'd eaten part of it, wordlessly, a couple of forkfuls, then just poked at it, finally setting the fork aside.
"You're not sleeping, are you?"
The next moment, Sherlock was rushing up the stairs, torch in hand. John followed him. As soon as they were outside, Sherlock turned the key in the lock of the old wooden door. The priest, who had followed them up, tugged at the handle and knocked on the door from the other side.
John turned to him, taking note of how stiffly he sat beside him, staring into the middle distance.
"Nope," John said.
"Sherlock."
Eyes blue as water brushed John's before Sherlock looked away again to stare at his hands. John took a deep breath. No, he wasn't jealous. Not really. But there was someone he remembered. Someone who had threatened to destroy his entire life, everything that had been important to him. A severe, vicious threat that had almost suffocated him in fear and despair.
"NOTHING? What's that supposed to mean? You slit your wrists, Sherlock!"
"I've asked Mrs Walton to bring a fresh one," he explains.
Sherlock took his magnifier out of the kit he always carried with him and peered more closely at the marks on the upper arm. "The haematomas bled all the way down through the tissue; in other words, they were inflicted prior to the time of death," he said.
"That's it! Yes, that's it!" Sherlock beamed. "John and I will talk to Callum McHattrick," he told Linda. "Can you have him come to the station to make a witness statement?"
"They ordered lunch," she huffed.
"Fine," Sherlock said. "Then let's do something else. Have you been to the Aare gorge yet?"
Sherlock swallowed. "I promise," he whispered, struggling to get the words out.
Sherlock started with Variation 1, ran through the part with the flageolet a couple of times. Then he turned his attention to the transition from the cheerful first part to the darker second half. The difference needed to be audible. Clearly audible. The subtext. The shadow, the fear of the depths. Then Variation 3, the fearsome roar of the storm, the simple, straightforward power of the plainsong in the background. Sherlock cursed himself for having composed such a technically difficult variation. He practised it over and over. He was no beginner. Passable.
Ella. Ella got right to the heart of things. Always. What did John want to tell him? Why now? Sherlock leaned his shoulder against the door frame. He was afraid of what was coming. Because whatever it was, it was the truth, and it was going to hit him hard. He could see it in John. In his eyes.
They sat silently on the back seat of Mycroft's limousine. The driver was fighting his way through the midday London traffic. It wasn't until they'd left the city on the A20 going south and were driving through the countryside that John relaxed a little. He'd had an internal struggle over the fact that they weren't being taken to Baker Street. It was so strange. A journey out into the country, into an unfamiliar life. Not to Baker Street, back to the familiar chaos. John had a hard time with it. Their flat on Baker Street didn't exist anymore. It had been let out. Other people lived there now.
John decided to do as the men asked and picked up his backpack. He didn't get as far as opening it, however, as one of the bodyguards promptly plucked it out of his hands.
"We found ourselves standing like two madmen on the threshold between life and death. It was as if we were in a trance. Thomas was utterly obsessed with a ritual death by the sacred sword. He wanted us both to make that sacrifice for a love in Christ. Looking back, I think it didn't really have anything to do with me. He was just waiting for a reason to take that step. At any rate, we were completely blinded by our madness. At that point, things simply took their course. I was barely even aware of what we were doing. Thomas set everything up, arranged the time and met his death by sword. I was in shock."
John got up. He ran a hand through Sherlock's curls and kissed the soft fluff, which smelled of Sherlock: beguiling. Then he left the other man on the couch and went up the stairs to his room.
They'd drunk their tea, John had set out some biscuits, and Dr Halsey had admitted, startlingly: "That's kind of my secret dream, you know. To live with a man."
John looked into those pale eyes. The flickering restlessness had disappeared from them. He hesitated. He was tired. Sherlock was too. But maybe... maybe that was a good thing. Maybe it was good if they were too tired to think. John sat down on the bed next to Sherlock and looked at him. Sherlock had stuffed John's pillow under his head. Black, tousled curls. A soft look in his pale-as-water eyes.
Sherlock had eaten the fruit salad a little later, and then rung John.
Dr Kenny nodded. She stood up as well and said, suddenly sober: "Let me give you some parting advice, Sherlock, whether you want to hear it or not: Don't play with love. Especially not the love of the person who belongs to you. Love is power. Take responsibility for it."
"Stop." John raised his hand toward Sherlock. His fingertips touched Sherlock's collarbone, exerted a gentle pressure there.
I must have been staring at him, and he must have sensed it. He turned his head and our eyes met. I saw his eyes widen. He was startled, just as much as I, clearly having as little expected to see me here as I him. We watched each other through all the people, dishes and glasses, through coiffures and hats, all the chatter, blather, and laughter. We stared at each other like two strange wolves who have caught each other's scent.
Sherlock had pressed his face into John's neck briefly before falling asleep in John's arms.
"I want to see your eyes," I said.
"Both have criminal records," he said. "Elisabeth Cardigan, incarcerated at Holloway for the past four years. Sentenced for coercion and manslaughter, along with violation of the controlled substances act. And Maggie Sun Lee, in Holloway for the past two years, various burglaries, robbery with use of force and incidental death."
John ran his hand through Sherlock's dark curls, touched his lips lightly.
"Of course. I work on an international project." Sergej held his smart phone out to John.
They stood there, the space between them insurmountable. John's grey eyes so intent. So familiar. Yet so foreign. So much uncertainty. So much doubt. There was a brief moment, though. An acknowledgment. A glimmer. A memory. An ancient feeling, somewhere deep down. A surge of warmth and pain that welled up, inundating Sherlock, scraping him raw and drenching him in balsam at the same time. Taking away all his strength and making moisture shoot into his eyes.
Lestrade frowned. "It's not a very pretty story, unfortunately," he said.
"The game's already been played, Sherlock. The case is solved and you have the information. All that's left is to decide on the price. But I'll be fair: the little Watson for a Holmes."
They sat on opposite sides of the table and smiled at each other. Sherlock's heart was beating in his throat. He was shaking. Every fibre of his body was trembling, light but noticeable. It made it hard to breathe, the fact that he couldn't do what he'd taken for granted over the past few days, that he couldn't close the distance, couldn't touch John, feel him, smell him, surrender in his arms to the desire that had built up in him. A strong magnetic force between them, one that he was only able to withstand with great effort. The table between them.
Watson comes back after a few minutes and sits beside me. He has brought the bucket back, sets it next to the bed. He has a damp cloth that smells fresh, like diluted vinegar. He uses it to clean and soothe my face and eyes. Carefully. The crisp smell of vinegar crowds out the stink of vomit, floats up into my nose and head, clarifying as it goes. Watson washes the sticky layer of sweat from my face. I open my eyes with a concerted effort, gaze into the gentle, careworn grey.
he gasped. Then he screamed. A lone scream, releasing his desperation into the room. A long, drawn-out cry that made the hairs on the back of John's neck stand up.
The dampness of the summer rain still hovered in the old trees. Their leaves were heavy with water, the grass and paths wet. It smelled of moss and the weathered stones on the old graves. They walked silently side by side. Sherlock with his crutches, John right next to him, adjusting his gait to Sherlock's limp. The gravel on the path crunched under the crutches' rubber tips and the soles of their shoes. An overly loud and omnipresent sound in the stillness of the cemetery and the two men's silence. John rested his hand on Sherlock's arm when they arrived at the fork in the path, mutely guiding him. His touch light, very light, yet filled with so much warmth, firmness, and care. Sherlock needed all of it.
"Those who need to know find out by word of mouth. The dates are passed on from one man to another."
The abbey was Baroque, but the inner dormitory was older. Much older. The narrow Gothic tracery-work windows lining the cloister were unglazed. Through them, the cloister garden was visible, laid out in a geometric pattern with a low fountain in the centre. The heavy, rain-laden sky cast everything in a dim grey light. It was cold in the cloister passageway and smelled of  damp sandstone from the worn stone walkway. Ancient tombstones lined both the floors and walls, bearing testimony to the monks buried there. The autumn wind had stuck a few yellow leaves from the garden to the grey stones. Signs of transience.
He entered him, careful but decisive, and Sherlock clawed into the pillows with a low, lusty cry, rising up toward him, tempestuous and impatient, pressed himself towards John, pulled him further inside through the movements of his hips. John moved slowly and attentively, completely in sync with Sherlock's countermovements. Sherlock gasped and pleaded until John wet his hand with spit and stroked Sherlock's rock-hard cock with it. Sherlock was about to climax, and John knew that he was so far gone himself that the contractions he would feel while so deep inside Sherlock would suffice.
The blue open and attentive, transparent as glass. Sherlock's gaze boring into John's. A long time. Searching. John allowed it. Let Sherlock examine him. Verify. Probe. Deeply.
Sherlock waited at the exit by the ticket gates on the arrival platform. He stood back, leaving some space between the exit and himself, positioned himself by the back wall of a sandwich stand. He wanted some time when John came through the gate and saw him, when they saw each other. A few steps at least, a couple of seconds to collect himself.
"Please have a seat, Mr Watson," one of them said, indicating an empty chair.
John massaged, stroked, kissed, sucked and licked, became aware of his renewed arousal and transferred it to his partner. Sherlock moaned softly. John was stunned by the feeling that spread through him. He loved. He loved in a new and incomprehensible way. What they were doing was more intimate than anything he'd ever done before. It was unconditional. Everything else, everything, paled in comparison, became meaningless. At some point, Sherlock tugged at his hair and John stopped. Sherlock pulled him up to lie next to him, and they covered themselves with the nearby sheet and curled up in each other's arms. That was the only thing that mattered now.
"What happened?" he asked, his voice flat.
John caught Mycroft's eye. And for the first time, the very first time since they'd known each other, John saw unadulterated worry in the flinty blue eyes.
Eighteen years. But the warmth was still there. The unsullied joy that spread and surrounded them now, crowding out all other realities. The two of them. They were together. Eighteen years. They looked at each other. There was nothing to say. Nothing to tell. Everything was irrelevant, no matter what had happened. Sherlock took a single, hesitant step, and then they were hugging. Shy at first, then fierce. They nestled into each other. Wordless. Not letting go. They sniffed at each other, kissed, clawed their hands into each other, bit, cried, sobbed. They sank down together onto the hard bed, peeled off their clothes and made love. Made love tenderly and freely. They were still so familiar to each other, still so sure of what they were doing as if the last time had merely been yesterday.
"On the contrary," Sherlock said. "I need you."
Sherlock took a deep breath, closed his eyes for a moment to escape John's gaze. Then he leaned back in his chair, groped absently for the menu, and tried to relax. At least on the outside.
"Yes, he did," said John. He didn't have the heart to give any other answer.
"That was the Russian secret service. They got the data off her before you could. Irene was armed and injured one of the men with a stiletto. He defended himself and injured her in return."
It was barely a whisper. Sherlock's hands had twisted around his friend's a while ago. They lay close together, their faces mere millimetres apart, breathing together. This is how they would die. John didn't feel any more pain, was comfortable where he lay, his final position. Sherlock wasn't moving anymore either. Resignation had set in between them. But there was a sense of peace too, along with the knowledge that it was good like this.
"He was in love with you, wasn't he? Back then?" Sherlock's voice was gentle.
"Sherlock?" The telephone was set to loudspeaker mode.
"Ethan loaned it to me," Sherlock whispered. "Let's go outside. This church has too many ears."
John looked him over with concern, squeezed his arm. "I guess it wasn't such a good idea after all to go in there," he said.
"Sherlock's hurt," said John.
"No." Sherlock reached his hand out again, grasped the sheet covering Eurus's neck, and pulled it firmly down a few centimetres. Her head was sewn onto her body with large stitches. Sherlock stared at them doubtfully. A seam. No gaping wound. It could be an illusion. He felt the rough thread with the tips of his fingers. The flesh beneath it was cold and blue.
John wrote back.
Out in the corridor, John stopped short. He was all in a muddle, still didn't understand what was going on. The case had been solved, Sherlock was starting to communicate, but the pieces of the puzzle still didn't fit together.
John absently pulled open the drawer of the nightstand, reached inside and felt around in the dark for his wallet, took out a couple of notes and his bank card and put them on top. He tugged a handful of tissues out of the box on the nightstand, cleaned up the semen on his stomach, preoccupied. Then he stretched out on the bed and tried to breathe slow and easy, to compose himself. The sound of the shower running. He wasn't dreaming. Sherlock was here. He was alive. But he would leave, be gone again. Invisible. That made John realise their life was going to change. Life on Baker Street. His life. Without Sherlock.
Boring. Standard attempt at misdirection. Why was Grainsburgh's girlfriend trying so hard to implicate his friend and co-worker, Sam? She must have a motive. And she was mixed up in it. She was the lead to follow. Not Sam.
"But let's say good-bye to your sister first and wait until the worst of the wounds have healed. And until we're more sure about us," John said.
"What for?"
"Yeah."
Ethan rotated his teacup on the table in front of him. He took his time answering. Finally, he said, "Okay to keeping my ears open. But don't expect me to spy or take actions against my own. Even if they maintain different beliefs, that doesn't give us the right to judge them."
Then he had something to eat, poured himself a glass of wine and stretched out on the couch. It smelt like freshly laundered linens, and he realised that he hadn't spent a single hour in his bed since John had left.
John had seen enough during the war. As a doctor, he'd stood side by side with the chaplain at the deathbeds of his fellow men-at-arms. He'd participated in makeshift farewell rituals and witnessed the barebones masses and blessings before battles, the low-key, improvised celebrations of the Eucharist, a last supper before going down into Hell.
"I'm not your partner," Martin whispered. "I'm just his proxy. That's important. We both know it. But I can't cool us off any more, John. If this is the only path, then take it."
"Interpol?"
"No accusations please, John."
"Weren't you ever jealous?" he asked.
"Thanks." Greg examined the document. "Interesting," he said, laying the list down on the table. "Two of the men who were relieved of the priesthood back then emigrated to Chile. One lives in Bhutan. Three died shortly after the affair in a traffic accident – all in the same vehicle. One died of injuries sustained in a climbing incident and one died of a heart attack. There's no trace of the last four."
John leaned back in the chair. His legs parted for his friend's fingers without him needing to think about it. Sherlock slid one hand down, rubbed the material of his trousers, beneath which John's cock quickly swelled. He moaned out loud when Sherlock probed his ear with his tongue, gasping, hot, demanding.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock whispered hoarsely. "I just need a moment."
"We'll have to pray together all day and all night," John explained.
"Come here. Kneel down next to me." John lowered himself onto the folded blanket and tugged the other one closer.
When he emerged from the bathroom, Sherlock had made coffee, pushed a cup into his hand without asking. The gesture confused John. He couldn't recall Sherlock ever having made coffee for him before. He accepted it gratefully. And he was astonished to recall that Sherlock had made him a sandwich the night before, cut cheese into strips for him, taken him into his arms, cried with him. Everything was so new and unfamiliar, and it touched John unexpectedly deeply. It also scared him. He wasn't alone. Sherlock was here. He'd chosen Sherlock. Not Martin. Sherlock. Sherlock's eyes. Pale and worried. John put the coffee cup down on the table.
John lay awake for a while before falling asleep, listening to the strains down in the living room. Sherlock was improvising. A gently rocking piece with long, drawn-out notes. Probably still in the dark.
Callum shook his head. "No, John," he said slowly. "He uncovers painful dependencies and frees men from the wrong partners. And he brings those together who belong together."
John glanced over at Sherlock. His eyes were dark and shadowed, a deep reflectiveness beneath brows drawn together with worry. Sherlock had pushed his chair back from the table a bit, as if he wanted to distance himself, remove himself from what was going on. He was leaning back with his legs crossed, his head resting on three fingers of one hand, his other holding a teacup balanced on his knee. He wasn't as relaxed as it might appear at first. John saw in Sherlock's breaths the restless attentiveness with which he was following the conversation.
John had stopped short in shock during Sherlock's explanation. His heart was pounding. What Sherlock was saying was nothing short of monstrous.
John nodded bitterly.
"We practically caught him red-handed, took the murder weapon right out of his hands. He's not going to get his neck out of this one."
Callum nodded. Then he began again. Serene and solemn.
John immediately knelt down, set the candle on the floor and placed his fingers against Martin's neck. He was warm. John felt a slow, strong pulse beneath his fingers. Martin moved, turned, seemed to emerge from a deep sleep, and stared at John. His black eyes glowed in the light of the candle.
"Is it because I'm close to him? Because he's my friend?"
"While we're on the topic," John started, "if I don't need to pay rent on the flat any longer, I could quit the practice and take on a couple of shifts at Bart's again. That would mean I could help out more with cases. And Bart's has a nursery. Rosie would have more structure in her day."
"Extend my deepest gratitude to Mr Holmes. We will reciprocate under the terms of the agreement as soon as we have checked over the plans."
What bitter words to use in relation to love: Break. Pain. Destruction. Death. He'd suspected this was how it was.
John stayed miserable on the floor for two hours before he decided he had to act. He slowly got up from the carpet he was half-laid on and gripped the nearest bookcase as his still-sour legs trembled from the too quick movement. He was still sore after spending so much time on the floor, and he had to stay still for a minute or two before moving to the kitchen and having a glass of water. He watched his reflection in the huge mirror that covered almost the whole surface of one of the kitchen's wall. He looked terrible: pale like a sick man, red bloodshot eyes watered by his now drying tears, slumbered shoulders that seemed to carry a way too heavy burden, and clothes that still had wine stains from the day before, when he and Mike had celebrated Rosie's birth at his friend's place. Seeing his awful figure made him realize that he had not properly slept, nor felt really at peace, since at least a week and a half. Since the overdose, if he was to be honest with himself. He let out a shaking breath and headed to the entrance hall. He took his khaki coat, his keys on the key ring that spot a rainbow one of his youngest patient had given him, and got outside. It was around a quarter past fifteen, but the sky was stormy, yet paradoxically calm, like it was mourning with John. There were a lot of people outside, but they looked like ghosts to the doctor as he took the familiar road to Baker Street, walking under threatening and sad clouds.
Sherlock smiled before walking away, not doubting a second his friend would follow him. At on point he turned around and spoke over his shoulder. Just a sentence. Just one thing.
- Working!? Are you kidding me? What must be so important that you don't even ask me if everything is going fine with my wife?
- It was part of a plan, John. A possibility, if you want. Me and Mycroft had planned every single way this could go, so I wasn't in danger when I...
He did not want to have this conversation a thousandth time. He was too tired. When he got back to the living room, the detective was rummaging through the desks. He raised up a Paris snow globe John and Mary bought as a souvenir of their honeymoon and examined it like it contained the secrets of the whole wide universe. He seemed immersed in his thoughts and clearly did not realize he was not alone anymore. John cleared his throat to signify his presence and Sherlock turned, his coat floating behind him.
- What do you mean, if I may ask? Sherlock asked with a proud-filled voice, like a master who sees the results of his instruction on his apprentice.
John only nodded as he carried a grunting Mary outside, grabbing her coat in a fly and latching onto her as he opened the car's left rear door and crawled inside, dragging his wife next to him. He shouted for Sherlock as he was still in the house, probably analyzing the carpet or
Something was missing. Something in front of them, hiding in plain sight. To end this mess, they needed Sherlock Holmes, and not just the shell of the man. He would come back from this, but when? What if it would be too late? He vaguely heard his phone ringing and reached for his pocket with sweaty hands and put it to his ear.
- Let me speak and maybe this fluctuating brain of yours will start understanding things!
- You asked me what could be more important than your wife's sake. Your wife.
John nervously laughed before turning his attention to the folder. Sherlock double-clicked on it and they waited for the content to load. It felt like hours of waiting, like an eternity with the little circle turning and turning on the screen, like a mantra, indicating that the laptop was working. Like it did not understand, like it refused the informations he was given.
- The universe is rarely so lazy, John murmured, echoing the detective's past words.
And then the line went down, Sherlock having probably hung up to go back to concocting new plans. John took a glance at the digital clock on the wall, and gulped when he saw it was already eleven and thirty-eight. He had to get Rosie, and then he had to get rid of her again. He felt guilty abut being such a bad father, but she would be safer far away from him now.
- I put a tracking device on your phone. Well, not exactly a tracking device but whatever. It's the fifth time you've called her tonight, and the twenty-eight time in the past days.
- Yes, a number. Now if you excuse us, Sherlock said prolonging the last syllable.
- I don't know yet, but I was just going to update Sherlock about the… recent development.
- Do you think I never went to the hospital? We both know it would be a stupid question since you are not with Mary right now, so you can't know how it's going on; that's just a thing you say to stick to the etiquettes.
“Done.” he wrote to Sherlock, and in the following minute he assisted to the change of his phone location as an answer. Sherlock was controlling it from Baker Street, tricking the device into believing he was at the flat instead of here, outsmarting Mary's probable tracking device that she had put on on his phone someday, when he was naive and ingenious. John wanted to stop a minute, think for a second about what the plan really meant for her, but he had no time. If Sherlock was seeing right into it, then Mary would be here within minutes. He had to hide somewhere safe, somewhere she would never think about checking. And he had to be fast about finding a place.
The detective's voice echoed through the house. John groaned.
- Yeah but then…
six feet under. Yet they all had come, and John would be forever grateful for that. Whether it was a facade or not did not even matter, John needed the commemoration to say goodbye. As they approached the grave, Rosie started whimpering louder, like she somehow knew, like she could sense that it was her mother's tomb. As they all gathered around the pit, John saw the outline of a man near a tree. The umbrella betrayed the man's identity: Mycroft. The man nodded in acknowledgement at John, who return the greeting. As he focused back on the funeral, he saw the priest coming near them, and he snapped out of the religious words as the man began praying God to accept Mary in His breast. He was never a pious in the first place, and he found it extremely hypocritical to listen to someone's blessing for a woman he had killed, that would probably never go to Heaven anyway, if something like Heaven actually existed. Sherlock and Mycroft had convinced Lestrade to cover the murder, making it look like a suicide. There had been an official statement pulling John and Sherlock out of justice's grasp and declaring Mary as a "traitor to the Crown, compromising the safety of the citizens of the British ground". They would not be sued, which were of course brilliant news, but it did not help with John's guilt. He believe it would eat at him forever, even if he had not had a choice. It was her or Sherlock. His wife or his best friend. Maybe it meant he was a horrible person that could not be trusted with his love, but he would always chose Sherlock over one of his girlfriends. It was mechanical. When he focused back on the priest, he had apparently finished his invocation of God or whatever force was suppose to save Mary from an endless wandering. They were all dropping off flowers at the feet of the grave, chrysanthemums and gladioli and white lilies. Minutes were spent in absolute silence, before all eyes were on John, like they were waiting for him to do something, to
- Which one were you asked to shoot, Mary?
He cursed under his breath as the digital clock counted down the seconds, like an hourglass. Like an accusation. Like a little lullaby that always stays in your mind, obsessing you with its unbearable melody. “Hurry up, or you will ruin everything”, it was singing to him again and again, like a loop, turning him crazy. Three minutes had passed, Mary had not answered yet, but John froze when he heard the distinct sound of keys being shaken out of a pocket. Seconds passed before he bolted up the stairs and got into the first room to his left, leaving the door ajar behind him. Rosie's bedroom. His steps were unheard as the floor was covered in a pastel pink afghan that Mary had chosen, claiming it was “appropriate for a little girl” when John had complained they would grow tired of it. He quickly adverted the room, and was relieved to find a closet. He opened the door, wishing for it to be new enough to be noiseless, and apparently there was still a God somewhere as his prayers were answered. He stepped in and shut the sliding door, being immediately plunged into darkness. He tried to keep his breathing quite, willing his heart to stop racing, and palmed his jumper pocket for his phone. He put it on mute before unlocking it, lowering the brightness right away. "She is here. I'm hiding in Rosie's wardrobe". His friend answered in the ten seconds following his text. "Oh, so you're in the closet now. SH". And, okay, cool, Sherlock still found the will to crack jokes at him. "Shut up and do your part" John wrote. He was being petty, but it was part of their game, of their dynamic.
to find her before she leaves the city. Or worse, the country.
“She is out again, isn't she? SH”
- Oh! How is Rosie? Can I see her soon?
- John…
- You sacrificed yourself for us?
did not know. What if Mary still had guns around the house? What was he supposed to do? Why did nobody write a
Blood pooling out, everywhere. Sherlock unharmed. Scotland Yard. A shock blanket draped over them. Mary. Moriarty. Dead.
again. And now he was home alone, walking aimlessly trying to talk to his wife who wouldn't answer. He was going to the kitchen when his phone rang. Once. A message, then. John got back to the coffee table to pick it up and was surprised to see the familiar name of Sherlock on his bright screen.
- Shut up! Do you... Don't you get what you're telling me? You're asking me to spy on my wife, who is pregnant with my child, who could give birth at any moment, based on suspicions you can't prove? Well big news, I'm out! You're alone this time.
The ceremony was a masquerade: everyone here knew they were burying a murderer, a sniper. Everyone knew they were putting
He did not even realize it as his steps soon lead him to the familiar green door, the gold letters sending a ray of light reflecting in his gray eyes. He knocked on the door, tapping the heavy door knocker on the acacia wood. He heard light hurried steps on the other side and a voice shrieking “Coming!”. The footsteps slowly got closer until John was faced with a very disheveled Martha Hudson wearing a purple-pink apron, her hair in a messy bun. She had her i-Pod in one hand and her headphone in the other, but when she saw John her eyes widened, she huddled everything in her front big pocket and lunged for him, hugging him until he could no longer breathe.
believe she might be linked to Moriarty somehow… So, yeah. Things are not that great.
- What about them? Is everything okay? Is it the baby? Oh my God, tell me the baby is okay.
. “We might have to change the plans”, Mycroft had said, very calmly as usual. They still did not know what had happened, why all the agents abruptly left like the devil just appeared to them. They did not know anything. But it was fine. Because as the plane turned back, John Watson felt at peace.
- Frank used to have a safe where he kept everything regarding the, you know… she said glancing around her as if to verify nobody was eavesdropping, the drugs. Of course, the cops figured it out after a while.
- You would be right not thinking that, brother of mine. Here is a list of agents that work, or shall I say worked, for our late Moriarty, he said while handing them the papers. They have to be eliminated. At all costs.
It was not long before Mary's willowy shadow was cast on the wall, and the first thing he saw were her shining black pumps, the heels echoing through the now silent house. She smiled and longed for her husband, plunging for a kiss that John could not help but feel sick about, somehow. She then turned to Sherlock and offered him a polite yet tight smile, to which he answered with a nod of acknowledgement. There was a tension in the room, a silent question hanging in the air. “Where were you?" Nobody would ask, they would all act like nothing was up.
- I... I'm sorry but I don't think I can. Not now. Mycroft made me promise not to say anything. But we will reach you as soon as we need your help. And we are gonna need it. We will need Scotland Yard.
Both John and the landlady jumped as Sherlock's deep voice elevated in the little flat. They turned around at the same time, wide-eyed and open-mouthed. The detective was casually leaning on the yellow flower-designed wallpaper. John raised a curious eyebrow at him to which Sherlock answered with a snicker.
his day. The screen spotted now a large scratch on the whole length.
- You act like I don't know that,
Sherlock laughed and was about to reply before John cleared his throat, interrupting the two brothers.
- What do snow globes have to do with everything? Sherlock, he said as he heard nothing on the other side. Sherlock? Goddammit!
And then it appeared in front of him. He felt dread filling his core, his blood ran cold and he began to sweat out of feverishness. Right before his eyes were concentric circles that all started from the same fixed point on the map of London: Euston Road. 310 Euston Road.
- Of course we'll stop him, stop speaking nonsense John. This is why we're here, after all. We both know this isn't some kind of courtesy visit anymore.
He had no time for thinking or whimpering or calling anyone. She could not escape them, or they were all dead. He was about to follow her when his feet tripped over something. A gun was stored in the closet's, a small revolver that could fit in his pocket if he wanted. He felt hot tears pearling at the corner of his eyes, but he angrily wiped it away, sniffing and reaching for the gun. He then rushed to the roof and tried not to think about how many other guns she was hiding in their home, and about how he would have raised his daughter in this house that probably stored a whole arsenal. As he approached the door that lead outside, his life played before him, and he prayed for his daughter not to be an orphan by the end of the day.
something. He stepped forward, placing a single orchid in the center of the already existing bunch of flowers, and sighed heavily. At least it was over, no more Moriarty, no more Mary, no more danger. At least not for a while. Of course they would probably have to bring down the rest of the men, but there would not be a leader, nobody would know about Mary's passing. In the end, they had won.
- I… No, I think I got it. Seems like a good enough plan.
suicide this time. If the plane had not turned back, Sherlock would have died in a period of six months. That was a revelation. Then James Moriarty. The video. Probably the weirdest thing they had ever seen, the hardest case. It was recorded, that was for sure. You can't exactly come back from shooting yourself in the head. But then who had sent it on air? How could Moriarty have known what to say?
- Well. I already asked Mycroft to find her, as you may know. And, although that useless brother of mine did not actually found trace of Mary, I have reasons to believe she will come back at Euston Road within the day.
- Now now, she laughed. I think we should discuss it honey.
2) his breath felt like someone had made him drink gasoline, stale and nauseous
He hastily replaced the snow globe on its shelf and ran out the door, leaving John behind, probably expecting him to follow him around. He probably would, anyway. John grabbed his coat, shouted a “I'll probably be back late tonight” and, without waiting for Mary's answer, shut the door and followed his friend.
- What the hell? Are you actually serious right now? She could have give birth in your car! Are you that distanced from everything?
As he walked to the hospital, he thought about entrusting Rosie to Mrs Hudson, but then decided against it. Baker Street would not be safer than his house, and if the plan failed (which he hoped not, really), then she would probably go there, guessing this is where he would leave the baby. Perhaps he could ask Molly? Yeah, that seemed like a reasonable enough decision. He took out his phone and wrote out a “Hi! Could you take care of Rosie for a couple of days?”. He felt bad, only talking to her when he needed her help, but he did not have time to dwell on it as she immediately answered with an “Of course! Something is up?”. He sighed and locked his phone; deciding he would (maybe) explain everything later. He owned her that.
- It's only natural John, Molly answered with a compassionate smile, patting his arm with her free hand.
He then quickly walked out of the room as a “John, hurry for once!” was shouted from the door. Sherlock was there and put on his coat before opening the door to the big outside world. They waited on the concrete for a minute before Sherlock ran to a cab to the other side of the sidewalk, earning himself several horns from the angry drivers. John apologized with a hand up to them before stepping into the cab with his friend, shutting the door just as the taxi-driver pushed the accelerator pedal; Sherlock had probably told him to ignore all limitation signs anyway. He was already on his mobile, probably asking Mycroft to give them a clear way, just like every time Sherlock was in an urgency. John looked out at the passing buildings around them. They were really rushing to Euston Road apparently, as five minutes later they were in before his front door. He did not really register as Sherlock payed the cab and dragged him out by his right arm. He did register the cold that bit at his skin.
. He was about to abandon his useless research and send Sherlock to hell when his thumb nail got stuck in a crack between the snow globe's base and the glass as he was smoothing it down. It was not big enough to cause a leak, but definitely not small enough to be a manufacturing defect. As his breath became ragged, a bad feeling taking over his senses, he slowly removed the base and watched amazed as the false snow fell on the rug Mary was so keen on keeping although it was ruined by time and eaten by moths. The miniature glass-made Eiffel Tower shattered on the floor, water pooled on the top-left corner of the rug and then, to John's horror, a minutely folded paper of one inch slowly glided to the ground, gently rocked by the wind coming from the open window. John paled and picked it up with trembling hands. Unfolding it and praying it was innocuous, he thought back to every bad choice that led him to this moment, hating every single one of them. “666 217 01”. The number before him seemed to challenge him, waiting for the dam to break. What did it mean? Weirdly short for a phone number or coordinates, too long for an address... The now empty snow globe fell from the doctor's hands to the ground and rolled under the desk, its crash softened by the thick rug. He folded the paper back with shaking hands and slided it in his front pocket. Mechanically, John took his phone from his back pocket and unlocked it. 3008.
- What? What are you talking about? Mary is pregnant, what does she have to do with all of this?
- Thanks Mycroft, Sherlock answered when John just gaped at the man. But I reckon you are not here for sorries.
- Moriarty is dead. I saw it. I was there.
. As the detective's black silhouette was now coming to them, the doctor tried to give his wife some advices.
Of course, fate had other plans for Sherlock and him. It all went really quickly. He widened his eyes and felt sick in his core as he heard a yell from below him, and then hurried and heavy steps, like an elephant was in his house, resonated as Mary rushed on the stairs. John felt sweat polling at his forehead and his hair got damp as the footsteps got closer and closer, then stopped in front of his door, like his wife was thinking about entering the room. Luckily, she resumed walking until John could not hear her anymore. But he did heard the distinct noise of their fire exit door opening.
The morning after was a mess. John immensely regretted having drank himself to unconsciousness as:
It all went really fast from there, and John only remembered parts of it, like snapshots, instants mixing in a blur.
- And that's it? You just gave up because you couldn't take care of your brother? Because it was all too much for you?
- The day I jumped.
- Yes, that! she said, clicking her fingers like she had suddenly found the meaning of life. So anyway you won't manage to reach him, I fear… So, tea and biscuits, am I right?
- You think Moriarty is an alias?
- John. Sherlock, Mycroft greeted them. My condolences, doctor.
Sherlock made an enthusiastic sound as his call was finally answered.
- Are you spying on us? Because that's definitely what it feels like!
Sherlock slowly turned to John with a warning look as he had let out an unwilling sigh. Mary did not seem to have heard it, or at least she did not pick up on it as she turned on her high heels to the living room.
- Oh, give me a bloody break, Sherlock.
- You mean when you mourned for two years after your best friend jumped off Saint Bart's? she replied, now facing him and imitating a pitiful pout.
- Actually, is Sherlock here? I would kind of need to talk to him about a... case, he said, even though the last word got half stuck in his throat.
John could not help but be fond at his friend's genuine excitation after having made up a plan. He was like a child, sometimes, wanting to be rewarded for his wittiness. However, he could not help but feel anxious about the plan. Of course, Mary had to be stopped, but what if something went wrong? What if somebody died? He was not in love with Mary anyway, at least not with who she really was, but he still cared about her. He could not help but to. But even if he did not, what if something happened to Sherlock, to Lestrade, to Rosie, to Mrs Hudson, to anyone they cared about? He would probably always blame himself and die of consuming guiltiness. He was cut short in his thoughts as Sherlock spoke again:
