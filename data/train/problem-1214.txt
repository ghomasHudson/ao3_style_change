“Museums, cooking lessons, segway tours. You would hate it.”
“They’re chapped. I’m dehydrated from the cheap beer, and it’s rather chilly and windy out here, and I have been licking my lips a lot…”
"Is that what's got you being so nasty? John ignoring you for Katie?"
And just as when I discovered Sherlock was gay earlier tonight, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread that I was on the precipice of learning something about him, something about myself, that I was not ready to acknowledge. I polish off another drink and try to ignore the sound of my heartbeat in my ears.
“I think not.”
“Now the name is kind of cheesy, but it’s left behind from when this place used to be a strip club. Don’t worry, we won’t be seeing any nudity tonight.”
“Though I am an expert in innumerable fields of study, I regret to have to defer to you when it comes to romantic courtship. Was your display last month at the shops not an indication of a shift in our relationship?”
In line at the Tesco where a detatched, increasingly annoyed checkout girl declined my (turns out) expired coupon for paprika crisps (his weakness, not mine).
I’m ashamed how grateful I am for the out. I stand and reach into my pocket to retrieve my wallet before I’m packed into the dense crowd at the bar.
I did notice that, believe it or not.
Well, that was the moment, I suppose. Quite odd, but it’s fitting. I can’t help but wonder how things would have played out differently if either of them had the self-esteem to see what was right in front of them and—oh, the wife is stabbing Mahoney now.
It's not perfect. His instrument is all out of tune and he hasn't quite figured out circular breathing, but it couldn't matter less. At this moment, John is approaching me with his clarinet, playing back to me the song I've been writing for him since the day we met.
Oh, and here returns my doctor, my captain, my heart looking rather small in my beloved Belstaff. (Intentionally forgot to pack John’s coat to help bolster my plan. Hopefully the combination of my unadulterated scent and the erotic display I’m about to initiate will leave John helpless against my sexual prowess.) Another crack of thunder. How poetic.
“It needs one more thing,” she says as she presses a button at the end of my sleeve.
“What?”
I find myself where I belong, in his arms on Christmas Eve, in our Baker Street haven, where the world comes to our door and adventure calls. I bury my face in the crook of his neck and decide that loving John Watson has been the most exciting and terrifying adventure I've ever taken part in.
And although Mrs. Mahoney got away with murder and I lost my job with accompanying public shame and scrutiny, it was all worth it. The rain stopped, and a rainbow appeared. Very gay, indeed. As it should be.
“I’m sorry for that outburst, John. You must keep in mind I’m not used to imbibing so much at such a rapid pace.”
He finally distances himself from me completely. I feel irrationally empty. He shakes his head and exhales, steeling himself, before he comes back up to me. He tentatively puts his hands on my shoulders, whispering and looking at me as if his words hold great importance. "Sherlock, if this is what I think it is, and I hope to God I'm right..."
The homemade sweater is finally pulled over my eyes just as the door closes. I hopelessly try and smooth down my hair and glare at Mrs. Hudson, who eyes me critically.
I pull out my binoculars to see more clearly. “Is that the wife? I thought she fled after learning the truth about her husband.”
“It really was.”
It’s Sherlock’s turn to avoid eye contact with me. He seizes the drink and takes a long sip through the thick green straw. “I love this drink. Excellent choice. Just let me enter its ABV into my phone.”
“Look, did you just need to get out of the house? Are you and John… doing okay? Have things been different since he moved back in?”
The fact of the matter is, it was probably inappropriate for me to serenade John to sleep in the first place. He has made it clear that that is not a part of his life I should be involved in, that part being things bedroom adjacent.
“And how do we know Jack?” I answer, somehow with a thinly veiled accusatory tone. What is wrong with me?
“Mmm, yes, John?”
Without looking up from his phone, Sherlock replies, “Hmm?”
Maybe the wine has me feeling more seductive than I actually appear.
“Damnit, John! I have exfoliated, moisturized, and briefly considered Restylane injections. What more cosmetically must I endure for you to get off your arse and court me?”
“John?”
“Sorry I skipped out. Force of habit. Wouldn’t be proper for you to pay on your own stag night.”
I stand up, surreptitiously wipe my eyes, and hold out my hand to him. I echo the words of a former self, a man who had no idea just how much meaning those words would afford themselves later on. “So, you’re unattached then, like me. Good.”
“I suppose Jack could sense that I couldn’t truly devote myself to a relationship when in fact I—“
Ganimard immediately turned his attention to me, but I barely registered a word coming out of his mouth as blood rushed to my face and my chest swelled with warm pleasure and delight. Lupin who? I would gladly cross swords with ten thousand of thieves like him to hear the same little speech being repeated by Sherlock...
I seized Sherlock’s wrist in a steely grip and turned his face to me with my free hand, forcing the eye-contact. I then proclaimed, emphasising every word: “Greg is my friend, that’s true, but you are my priority, Sherlock and that won’t ever change! So I am going in with you – that’s not negotiable! If you think you will expose yourself to danger while I’ll just idle away somewhere, you don’t know you man!”
Sherlock cursed loudly and grabbed me by the hand. He then stormed through the bridge like a galloping horse. Having no other choice but to run after him, I followed suit.
Sherlock sighed softly when that happened and started to disrobe. He stripped down to the plain shirt and trousers and hung his coat, cap, jacket and vest on the rack. He remained standing near the wall after that, with his back turned to me.
“Yes. And I’ll show you right away. But you must promise me you won’t comment on it, OK?”
Sherlock wholly raised up his arm now. He hesitated for a second and then swung it in my direction with devastating force.
I bit my lip painfully.
John grins from ear to ear.

He pointed his finger accusingly at the white-haired man, Authié.
“My belt broke! I can’t believe it! The very day I’m going commando!”
John yielded to the temptation. He unhooked the button of his jeans, undid his zip and released his own cock from the confines of the underwear - large, dusky pink and already prepared for an action.
We managed to catch up with Rosalie when she was already in the middle of the bridge. She was standing motionlessly next to the solid stone edging of Pont Vieux and observed the fiery red glow of the approaching dawn at the horizon, wan mist of October morning enveloping her like a transparent veil. When we stepped out of the cab some distance from her and went to her on foot, she turned in our direction and closely observed us, but she didn't try to flee or to do some other inconsiderate thing. A simple wicker basket lay at her feet, covered with the piece of white cloth.
I forgot all about my mission for a while and let my glance run over him hungrily.
And so, while Sherlock begun to examine the place in earnest, I drew closer to the central podium and contemplated over the sculpture.
He lay on his back with lapels of his Belstaff splayed to both sides and didn’t move. At the front-part of his white shirt, a dark red blot was gradually expanding.
But in the next second, he was composed and cold like ice once again. He halted in front of Sherlock and addressed him in the mellow, friendly tone that was so fake it forced me to shudder.
Lestrade froze and then shook his head dismissively.
“Cathars?” I shrugged. “You mean that queer sect of heretics that plagued Southern Europe during The Middle Ages? Of course I have heard of them.”
Anderson saw us to the entrance and then returned to resume working. I have warmed up to the man in the last two years, but he was a hopeless detective indeed. He never noticed that the wrapped up object Sherlock carried in his hand became shorter and bulkier in shape during our short visit in the bureau.
The white-haired man leaned his cheek into Sherlock's palm and blinked sluggishly, as if he was not entirely aware of his presence. Then he replied in a low, enticing tone which was dripping with some surreal, mesmerising quality: “Guillaume… mmm, you returned… my boy.”
We managed to complete the same crazy ride through Thames once more.
Glimpsing a gun, I burst forward in panic and tried to take it away before it could be used against us.
Mycroft’s office, into which I was unceremoniously pushed, was immersed in a warm semi-twilight. Wooden panels covering the walls, barely visible in the background, hid in a mead-coloured shadows, while the strong sunlight coming from outside painted shiny ovals on the surface of the thick carpet there under the windows. All was silent and undisturbed. Only the particles of dust shivered in rays of light which cut across the heavy air.
Greg thoughtfully nodded in approval. “That makes sense, yes. But it puzzles me that the crutch was empty after all. Did you know that would be the case?”
Carrying the thyrsus over his shoulder, Sherlock then headed to the Lestrade’s car parked in the vicinity. He put the metal thing into it and took perch in the passenger’s seat, clearly expecting me to drive. I slipped behind the wheel and looked at him in expectation.
Some ten minutes later I shut the book again, thoroughly disgusted. My head was spinning. It was beyond my comprehension how this bloodthirsty being could ever be considered the god of light. The massacre of Niobe’s children. The flaying of Marsyas. But above all, the killing of Hyacinthus. Apollo was supposed to be a clairvoyant and yet he couldn’t foresee that a disc thrown by him would be deflected onto his lover’s head, killing him instantly? What a shitty bastard!
“The man she mentioned – Arnaud. Does he live in the flat on the first floor?”
“Sorry, I don't smoke.” I responded with somewhat reserved air.
“Still, your cousin, Vernet, knows about it, doesn't he?”
“Well, don’t blame me if I get there on my own, then. I asked!” retorted Sherlock.
Those full red lips adorned with cupid bow are surprisingly soft and taste like ripe cherries.
Sherlock turned to me, carrying a wary expression in the lines of his face.
“Did you see Monsieur Arnaud lately, Madame?” Sherlock asked empathetically.
Sherlock, who quickly collected himself, stepped up to the window and looked out inquiringly. An ominous buzz of angry voices droned around us, coming out of neighbouring compartments and the heavy steps of the train crew already resounded in the vicinity, but he didn't let himself to be disturbed by any of those facts and resumed the place opposite me, cavalierly reclining against the backrest.
“Ooh!” Sherlock rumbled in a low tone and went slack against the wall of the cottage, looking bewildered and rapt at the same time.
The man turns up to the stairs at the end of the terrace and disappears underground quickly.
Sherlock shook his head ruefully and glanced out of the window with grim expression on his face.
“Not interested, thank you.” Sherlock replied briskly and switched on the hotel PC placed on the tiny table in the corner. “Besides, I have some work to do. I'll sleep here. You can go up there, it's all yours.”
A short pause filled with stunned silence ensued after that. Defiant blue gaze contested against grave and worried brown one.
“I think there’s only one way to do it…”
We descended our unceremonious transport and dusted our garments off, eyeing our destination warily.
The parts I always meant to keep private when in public (with varying success) twitched enthusiastically. I gasped, turned around and tried to repay the torturous treatment to Sherlock, but the detective slithered by me like an eel and laughing silently, he saved himself by jumping out to an empty platform.
“Maybe he was dangerous, but he was certainly not considered a bad guy in the long run.” I protested. “Didn’t he preside over light, over music and poetry… over intellect, in fact?”

“Hm, if you think so…”
What a terrible sight that was! The house which appeared so cosy and luxurious from outside looked no better than a devastated old ruin after one went past its façade. Joyless and plain wall daubed with rough greyish plaster stretched to the shadows in front of me, the court around me heavily infested with weeds. The wall of the house was entirely windowless at the ground level, but possessed the small, dirty windows leering at me at the level of the first floor. All of the windows were very shabby, with the paint flaking away from them in stripes and with rags hanging behind their glass instead of curtains. A dilapidated gallery fringed the first floor from outside, battered wooden stairs leading to it from the rich tuft of stinging nettle. An ugly bay-window, more like ghastly wooden cage than a lofty construction, hovered right above my head, its side-door presumably serving as the entrance to the flat. All in all, the building resembled the dolled up bride who lifted the snow-white veil only to reveal the ghoul-like face underneath it.
“Because he's…” Sherlock hesitated and bit into his lip, frowning irritably.
“The rest is history.”
John, patiently waiting behind the wooden fence, exhaled in relief. He understood Sherlock's need to care for his long absent sister… still, you could never know with Eurus. One visit of Sherrinford sufficed HIM for a lifetime, that's for sure.
“De Vries noticed immediately that something is amiss and threw open the emergency exit to jump out of it. He kicked Murray’s body together with the now useless crutch out to see how it fares. But when it ended on the edge of the embankment instead of in the Thames, he lost the nerve to follow it. Or maybe he was already too weak and near collapse. Either way, he died there within a hand’s distance from freedom. Very nasty death, no doubt.”
Chosen one! The moment he used that term, the sparkle of enlightenment was kindled in my mind and it threw light at the last piece of the puzzle for me. I couldn't believe how dense I previously was.
“Lead on!”
Listening with the keen interest, I nodded in affirmative at that statement.
Their kissed roughly, two pairs of firm lips fighting for dominance and as they exchanged hot breaths, John's right hand usurped a place on Sherlock's waist, while the left one furtively travelled down. As his hand palmed the place between the detective's thighs gently, the low chuckle escaped from Sherlock's throat and the tall man put his own hand on his belly…
“Absolutely. He was most likely poisoned. Even through the wind, the smell of almonds was quite strong around the cubicle. Hydrocyanic acid, I’d say. I would be very careful around that cubicle for a while, Gordon.”
Suddenly, something hit me. It pushed into me with such force that I flew to the side, crashed down and stroke my arm painfully against the wall of the promenade. My ice-cream cone ended some ten feet from me, smeared in a sticky smudge on the pavement and Sherlock somehow appeared on top of me, wild-eyed and panting heavily.
“Assuming he will win, of course.”
They wandered through the abandoned island road in wordless pensiveness from Sherlock's side. And John did not try to break this barrier of silence down. He damaged their friendly relations more recently and was used to see more reserved, business-like side of Sherlock from that moment on.
“Is it really? But I'm none the wiser where it's concerned, I must confess. Can you tell me more about it?”
However, strange loud din disturbed me unexpectedly. As in a dream, I observed the bearded figure with blood streaked face emerging from among some overturned shelves at the far end of the counter. Emitting the roar of absolute rage, the man ran to Sherlock swiftly and kicked my unconscious friend into the temple. I started. Screaming in return, I quickly lifted the piece of debris wallowing near me and threw it after the attacker. The metal shamble hit him into the back accurately and forced him to snap around.
“The girl… it was the girl all along?”
“Comments? Nope. Who gave you that idea?”
I blankly watched the said door for a while, uncomprehending. Then I froze.
“Isn't it, indeed?” I echoed, barely masking the sarcasm dripping from my voice.
“Sherlock.” I managed to get out despite the fact that every bit of moisture disappeared out of my mouth unexpectedly, leaving it as dry as sandpaper. “When we’ll be inside… be careful, OK?”
“Didier!” He called out. “Didier, open up, I must speak with you!”
I joined him there and whispered: “What now? Do we alert the police that these guys are hiding here?”
In that moment a cetacean-shaped green-eyed monster burst from beneath the surface of my consciousness and her humongous fins tore every rational thought in my head to shreds.
Visible shadow of distress flickered in his eyes. He pursed his lips thoughtfully. Yet faced with my fierce determination, he was unable to oppose me. At the end, he leaned against the car-seat and flung his head back, staring at the ceiling grimly. Then he nodded: “All right, we will go together. And now listen to me, John – it is very likely that as we go in, they would grab and subdue us. If that happens, let them. Don’t struggle and yield to them. Will you do that for me?”
Following my bold plunder of him, I never bothered to transfer into my own bed. I just threw my arms around him, holding him close and immersed myself into a deep, sated sleep. However, in the wee hours of morning I was roused unexpectedly and coaxing Sherlock out of his slumber too with playful bites to his jaw, I prepared and claimed him once more. I could never have enough.
The armchair is a disaster. A crumpled box lays on top of it, cream, white chocolate and marzipan leaking from under its squashed up cover in every direction, sticking as a white messy splash on the chair's red velvety surface, paired with incredibly soiled up trousers which hang limply from the backrest.
“Well, that steak and kidney pie flavour sounded interesting the last time, John…”
I couldn’t believe how it all came back to me at that moment. It was St. Bart’s all over again and the pale cheeks, temporal bones striped with blood and wide open glassy eyes transformed itself into the features of another familiar face… I’m ashamed to admit it, but I lost it and threw up. Doctor and a retired soldier and I was not able to do a thing, to take control, I just crouched down on all fours and trembled like a leaf, moaning quietly.
The casual admission ejected me from my seat as a bullet: “You mean to tell me you allowed this disgusting pervert to defile you for years? That's… preposterous!”
“You could say that, yes.”
Sherlock, sitting on the edge of the bed and lacing up his boots, looks over his shoulder disinterestedly and shrugs: “Room service will be here in the afternoon. They will take care of it.”
“Just think about it, John!” Sherlock gesticulated in excitement. “Just think what we saw at the site of a tragedy! The house which was neat from outside, but nothing more than a derelict ruin from inside. The poisoned tea. The room where the shooting took place, the dead man at one side of the door, the drugged up man at the opposite side, the door between them completely unscathed. The blocks of coal which should scatter around the victim in a completely random manner but which were arranged into something of a row. Does it ring a bell with you, John?”
“Dieu!” The Frenchman screamed in outrage. “Is there something you cannot deduce before it actually happens? There goes the surprise! And I believed you will be so astonished to meet your old mentor again! What a pity! How do you cope with this all the time, Doctor Watson?”
I repeated the cough, amplifying its noisiness this time and cursed hoarsely: “Shit! It looks like I’ve caught cold near the Eye! And nasty one at that! Do you have some tea at hand by chance, Philip? I could do with a cuppa right now…”
Ioan let him sweat for a bit more, before he dropped his stern expression, and smirked fondly. “Idiot,” he smiled gently. “Come here.”
Willingly, Sherlock rushed into the offered embrace.
Something moved in the corner of his eye. He turned, but he immediately sensed that he was too slow. In the last second, he saw the warrior with his drawn bow. It was too late, he couldn't avoid the deadly arrow.
A pained gasp from the bed made him hurry up.
Eventually, Sherlock started to squirm under his inquiring gaze.
Finding a fluttering pulse, he breathed a sigh of relief, and the pained groan that tumbled over Sherlock's lips was the sweest sound he had ever heard.
Ioan cocked an eyebrow expectantly and waited.
Winning his men's respect had been hard. Together with Ioannes, a priest had been send with him who was supposed to bring Christianity closer to the people here.
“No, don't!” he cried when, as he returned to the bed, he caught Sherlock weakly trying to pull the arrow from his chest. He slapped the man's hands away, and spread out his supplies. Pelonius appeared at his side with a bowl of steaming-hot water, and he grunted a noise of thanks.
Mutely, Ioannes trudged next to Gregorius and his other companions. He wasn't really in the mood tonight to spend his time in the tavern though. Not that there was much else to do in this god-forsaken pithole, and normally, he was the last to leave his comrades hanging on their tavern-mission, but today, he felt... melancholy. Maybe the anniversary of Gratian's death neared once again – out here, you sometimes lost track of time or the date –, his soul reacting instinctively to that. And although it had been seventeen years ago, it hurt as much as it had on that fateful day.
Nonetheless, his joy was short-lived when he registered the arrow protruding from Sherlock's chest. His blood ran cold.
Sherlock scrunched up his nose. “Yes... No... Màiri and your Georgius can do that.”
As if in slow motion, a blurry figure suddenly moved in front of Ioan, blocking his view of his would-be-killer. A sharp whooshing noise when the arrow was released and a pained grunt reached his ears as if through wax. Then, the tall figure in front of him crumbled, and time seemed to pass normally again.
Incandescent rage gripped Ioan, and he looked up. For a moment, he met the Celt's eyes, then, he hurled his sword at the man without thinking, the sharp blade embedding itself in the man's chest. He was dead before he hit the ground.
Now, seven years later, he was one of them. They were a family, he and his most trusted men, a group of auxiliary troops from Gaul. Most of all, it had been his optio Gregorius who had stuck with him early on even when most of the men were still weary of him. The older man was the best friend he could wish for. He trusted him unconditionally...
Everything went so fast. In one second, he and Sherlock had dined together in the early evening, in the next, chaos had broken lose, their peaceful moments together shattered brutally.
After he had shown his worth over and over in battle, leading his men into victory, but also protecting them, he had gained their respect and their loyalty.
As if predicted, Sherlock scoffed. “I would be a stranger there. Worse, nothing more than a slave.”
His instincts reacted before his brain, and before he even identified the intruders as Celts, his sword was in his hand, and he was urging Sherlock behind the protection of his body. While Ioan was fighting them off, Gregorius and some of his soldiers stormed into the room to aid Ioan.
His biggest fear had been to fail. But the men weren't weary of him because of his past (Gregorius had even confined in him once that none of the men cared about that as long as he was a good leader and soldier; they had other worries here – like surviving – than caring about who their centurion took to bed) but because he was a stranger. Fortunately, that had been something Ioannes could do something about; he'd always been good winning friends, and he knew he was a good leader.
, he thought, beside himself with fear. But he had to keep a clear head right now if he wanted to save Sherlock. It hadn't been in his power to save Gratian, but he knew he could save Sherlock. He was a medic. A good one. He just had to remember that right now.
“No, Sherlock. You'll loose too much blood. Pelonius, hold him,” Ioan instructed. His slave did as he was told, and in the next second, Gregorius joined them in keeping Sherlock still.
Sherlock, on the other hand, was transformed into the whirlwind of energy. He let go of me and darted up, running at first to the fallen body to check its vitals and then to the assembled group of ogling passers-by who just started to panic and shriek. He bellowed at them like a young bull, deep-tone of his clarion-like voice vibrating through the whole area and gesticulated wildly, barking out orders and bossily organizing the place until the people dispersed, some of them running to the Eye, some standing on guard at various parts of the fresh tragedy, some pulling back and phoning frantically and some whispering among themselves.
With my mouth open in surprise, I shook my head weakly. Sherlock mentioned to me, once, that his grandmother was related to some French painter, but this, this was something entirely new to me. It suddenly occurred to me how little I actually know about Sherlock and his past. It was a very humiliating realisation. To be aware that he allowed me to share his body, but he never felt confident enough, never trusted me enough, to share his innermost thoughts with me…
I still remember how astonished I was when I first saw the statue.
When Sherlock threw the door to the car open, I reached out for him on impulse and splayed my hand on his chest, exactly over the spot where the old surgical scar lingered, masked by Sherlock’s clothing.
“My fair friend, this is me and you:
Sherlock looked at him slyly and lifted one shoulder in a gesture of mock-helplessness.
His resolve hardened some more. He nodded determinedly and skilfully escaped the confines of the room.
Sherlock pierced him with a stern, steely gaze from the side and replied curtly: “Do what is your duty, captain. You will find me at the house of Mr. Vernet if my presence is deemed necessary.”
”Yeah,” agrees John and secretively hands the purse over to Sherlock there under the table, their hands masked by the long tablecloth.
And what better deed could a spiritual person like him crave for than a destruction of the heretics, the wiping out of the enemy of his Church?
Sherlock smiled wistfully. “Striving for purity is a nice thing, but having too much of it – it is definitely not healthy.”
“Oui.” The girl replied, overpowered by my friend's forceful personality and stammered. “It's Marie… Marie Thibaut.”
I glimpsed him at once and ill or no ill, I was on my feet in an instant, frantic with worry. My mouth opened in shock but I was unable to give out a shout in paranoid fear that it could reach him somehow and make him slip.
Sherlock then returned and knelt down by my side.
Thankfully, Sherlock doesn't let him go. He turns around and takes John into his arms, holding him close. They lay still, nestling against each other and kissing in the pale light of dawn. It feels like eternity.
I gasped audibly and returned to the present, trying to steel myself for the inevitable. I realised that I always knew this was meant to happen one day. I didn’t foolishly believe that my dealings with Mary will go unpunished. The resentment had to be there, it simply had to dwell inside of Sherlock for a long time – and now it was allowed to flow out, unbridled.
Sherlock sharply averted his face to the side, shook his head and addressed Anderson again:
“Now, you are probably aware that fulminated mercury is highly sensitive to shock. The moment it violently impacted against the crate it exploded immediately. It was not able to do much damage on its own. However, it was powerful enough to pierce the thin plywood of the crate and to detonate its contents at once.”
“Pan golçat, please,” ordered Vernet and chose the wine to go with that dish. We sat to the table by the window and as Vernet poured the dark red liquid into three glasses, the girl swiftly cubed the fresh baguette on the cutting board. Sherlock observed her distractedly for a while, then pressed his lips together in sudden determination and turned to his cousin.
“Don't laugh!” Sherlock growled at him, knitting his brows into two frustrated lines.
Shots from a rifle accompany a dog attack as Betondorp wakes up!
I heard him exhale heavily and he replied, sounding very tired: “I never said that he is my ideal, John. I only said that he's Perfect.”
His eyes met Sherlock's, head-on, boldly, with the soldierly determination: “I'm not the one for big speeches, Sherlock. So I'm just offering you this. Us. I would very much like to have it, if it's the thing you wish for too…”
Dim light of a lamp flickered in the porthole above the door after some time and the key rattled in the lock. The oak opened hesitantly and a young man appeared on the threshold.
So I will finally pay for all the pain and suffering I caused him through the years.
“But as we already know, the frail protection of the participants that the cubicle offered didn’t last and De Vries killed Murray in anger with his crutch there. The cubicle was booked on Murray’s name so maybe he hoped to run off quickly after landing, before his crime was properly discovered. He didn’t know that Murray brought the vial containing hydrocyanic acid with him. While he was dying, Murray threw the vial to the ground and stepped on it, changing the whole cubicle into the gas chamber in no time.”
So why was he in Arnauds flat, I wonder?”
The Frenchman, however, was no longer interested about me or my inner turmoil. He draped himself over Sherlock's stiff form and proclaimed delightedly: “It is so incredible to have you here after all those years, Guillaume! Come, we must drink on this tonight!”
The reproach was worse than a shooting wound to me. I blanched, staggered and I had to sit down at the edge of the bed again, lest my weakened knees would give way on me.
And at that very moment the stomping of many feet resounded outside and subsequently, five members of gendarmerie burst into the room.
He believed I only used him as a cheap substitute for Mary, or some other female lover.
He slightly bowed to the gendarmes, placed the deerstalker at his head and beckoning to me and Vernet, he left the room. We hurried after him and soon found ourselves at the street in front of the bistro once more.
“Why do you call Holmes “Guillaume”?” I once interrupted him, remembering how he addressed Sherlock by some long form of English name when we met earlier this evening.
“Because what? I'm all ears!”
We emerged from the building via the automatic door facing the quiet street shrouded in greenery. Running like crazy, we dashed round the corner of the house and reached the little bridge by which our odyssey originally begun. Even from the distance I could discern the loud whirr of the motor boat. Just as we arrived at the water-margin, the sleek white body of a dynamic-shaped vessel detached itself from the wooden pier and promptly headed to the middle of the dock, taking up speed, leaving only disturbed, rippling water in its wake.
THE END
“Impressive, isn’t he?”
We found the underground studio in the same state we have left it – even the lamp over the entrance was still dully lit as if nothing had happened here in between.
His lover stirs up at this impulse and blinks confusedly, frowning and complaining in his deep, rumbling voice: "Hey, what was that for?"
Sherlock bowed his head and leaned against the wall of the alcove, crossing his arms over his bandaged chest. He directed a determined glance at me right after.
At last, I coughed and replied dryly: “You know, that is quite a detailed knowledge of this arcane teaching – from the person who refuses to register that the Earth goes round the Sun.”
He sat at the edge of the opposite bed, looking utterly devastated and then he lay down unexpectedly, as if all of his strength was sucked out of him at once. He reclined among the duvets motionlessly, faintly trembling with nervous exertion.
”You were quick,” remarks Sherlock, eyeing John from above the edge of a desserts menu.
He was a bit nonplussed by my inquisitive request, I could sense that. But he just brushed his lips with his index finger and answered truthfully: “It was during one day in the middle of the summer. We strolled with Julian at the opposite bank of Orb. Some peasants tended to their vineyards there, next to the road and the pair of local women passed us by, returning from the market at Les Halles. It was sultry hot, the earth being soft and muddy after the rather violent storm.
“Because he's perfect, that's why!” He retorted in a muffled, but very firm voice.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks and threw a flirtatious side-glance at me.
There was no doubt – it was him. A decorative pin and a yellow chrysanthemum were a dead giveaway. He looked exactly like last night, during our encounter at Gare du Nord in Paris. He obviously had no time to change into a travelling outfit in between. I carefully examined his figure from head to toe and spotted a portable bag almost immediately. It was sitting next to his polished patent-leather boots on the floor.
I shouldn’t jump into this in such a gung-ho manner. I should have spoken to him first. But speeches are one area I especially suck at. I am like Ajax, that unhappy warrior who committed suicide under the walls of Troy for the sole reason of not being eloquent enough. I am prepared to do any daring physical task you can bestow on me. Just don’t demand any heartfelt, elegant orations from me.
Soon, they sit on the terrace overlooking the stormy sea, observe the flock of sea-gulls gliding over the white-capped waves and listen to the shrill voices of the birds. Sherlock is slowly eating Spaghetti Bolognese and sips Italian white wine while John is heartily devouring full English breakfast accompanied by the pint of good pale ale. Out of custom, they do some small-talk in between.
The corners of Sherlock's mouth twitched. He scratched his cheek covered with a light stubble absentmindedly and shrugged his shoulders afterwards, the cunning twinkle dancing in his eyes.
“I don't know.” Sherlock steepled his fingers under his chin, his eyebrows creased up in thought. “Based on what Marcel told us, the Professor intended to meet him at the bistro later this evening. I doubt he bothered to explain his presence at Arnaud's place to him, though. I guess we must wait until we reach Rue de la Citadelle, John. Julian's filius minor will maybe tell us more.”
“Mon Dieu!” He gaped at the white-haired sleeper sitting behind our backs. His mouth opened in disbelief: “Professor Authié!”
“Three weeks ago, an audacious robbery took place at Coster Diamonds, the famous diamond cutting factory located in Amsterdam,” explained Sherlock. “The consignment of the precious South-African uncut diamonds was stolen and three employees responsible for its despatch were kidnapped together with their car. Two men were later found dead, strangled, at the outskirts of the town. The third man, Simon Nijmeijer, captured on this photograph, remained missing.”
Vernet approached us with the rueful face. He put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder and started to apologise: “Guillaume, I'm so sorry….”
“No!” Red like a tomato, Sherlock barked back. “It's the mussel! It slipped into my underwear… right there! Eww! So gross!”
If I had my suspicion about Authié's tastes before, it now increased tenfold and it soon solidified into horrifying certainty that sunk into my stomach like a stone.
He receded towards the door and locked them tightly, closing heavy draperies over the glass wall. After that, he turned on his heel resolutely.
The light flooded the place at once, illuminating the sitting figure which shifted and shut its eyes at the intrusion.
“Do you know who that is?” Lestrade, not sure what exactly are we doing here and unwilling to join a human dynamo currently prancing about a warehouse, appeared by my side.
Lestrade’s question was merely rhetorical, of course. For Sherlock was already busy browsing the net on his smartphone. Soon, he found the article he was looking for and showed it to me and Greg triumphantly. I found myself unable to supress a faint tremor when I recognised the face of our late kidnapper at once.
He bowed his head to both of us in greeting and passed us slowly, heading right to Didier and raising both of his hands to him. The young man was at his side in a flash and they embraced amiably. As they separated, they started to walk towards the town almost immediately, never looking back at the huge building which held one of them prisoner a while ago. Vernet intercepted them on their way and engaged them in a boisterous conversation, his ringing laughter reverberating through the place like thunder.
“Shut up, John and don’t disturb the driver!” bellowed Sherlock angrily in return.
But he ultimately wasn't what I was searching for. I have found that much, much later.”
Still, he was saved from further awkwardness by Sherlock who went past him carrying himself like royalty, his back ramrod-straight and approached the temperamental officer with his self-possession back in place. En-route, he produced a visit-card out of his vest-pocket and as he was handing it to the policeman, he coldly introduced himself: “My name is Sherlock Holmes, the consulting detective and I am currently in your country on the invitation of your government. I arrived into Béziers this evening in the company of Inspecteur Principal Justin Ganimard of La Sûreté. You can check these facts with him, he is to be found at the local Commissariat de Police at the moment.”
“Well, first and foremost, he was known as Loxias, a dark and gloomy interpreter of ambiguous oracles.” Sherlock, now fully immersed into our quarrel, halted right in front of me, staring me down. “Haven’t you ever heard of Delphi?”
Sherlock stared down on me, quite intrigued. His eyes narrowed into slits and his full red lips opened enticingly...
“And Julian Authié is now the leader of it, here in Béziers?”
The Eye was brought into a complete standstill by now. Capsules full of frightened passengers were hanging on the massive structure like drops of dew on a stem of a flower, blue and transparent in clear summer air. Maintenance ladder placed near the rim of the gigantic wheel encompassed the circumference of the Eye as a thin girdle, miniscule and as frail as a straw in comparison with the rest of the structure.
Greg started when we appeared in front of the half-open gate and called after us softly, but we paid him no heed. We steeled ourselves and entered the dark interior.
The man blinked at me at first, uncomprehending, while Sherlock abruptly dropped his hands to his waist and took a step back. He hummed and hawed in an uncharacteristic manner, more flustered than I ever saw him.
“What I don’t get is the reason behind these kamikaze’s actions. What the heck did they expect to find in that hollow crutch? Do you have any idea about that, Sherlock?”
The hall which stretched in front of us was evidently some fish-canning factory that has fallen into disuse. Long metal counter which previously served as an assorting line stood to our left and behind it, an ugly concrete wall leered at us. This wall, however, only went to the middle of the hall. The second part of the hall, placed to our right, was an open space leading maybe to some storage area at the rear side of the building.
Standing on tiptoes, John kissed these soft black daubs and his cheeky fingers once again strayed behind the band of Sherlock's briefs.
John removed his heavy coat and peered at the narrow staircase leading into the bedroom above their heads.
The new-found French cousin, on the other hand, laughed uproariously.
Gnashing my teeth, I plucked the smelly cancer-stick from his lips and stomped on it angrily. Sherlock, unpleasantly awakened from his movie-star impersonation by that act, sullenly frowned down on me.
I clenched my hand into fist and I pinned it against the side of the table.
Thankfully, he seemed to be descending now. Unable to aid him in any way, I nervously observed him, shaking in agitation.
“You want to examine De Vries’s enterprise? But Sherlock, it’s almost 9 pm!” He protested. “We will look into the matter tomorrow, OK? I’ll let you know when and we…”
And as they disappeared in the dark interior of the house, I noticed a shrivelled old bloke standing at the door – probably one of those credentes Sherlock was speaking about in the cab. That's when I obtained the final proof.
“Fascinating. I admit it could happen that way… but in that case, where is the true murder weapon? We didn't see it when we examined the corpse. Did it fell into some obscure place that escaped our attention?”
Sherlock stands up majestically and stretches into his full height.
“I will, yes.”
I was rendered speechless by that announcement. I caught myself facing Sherlock again, unbelieving and bug-eyed, but now it was him staring out of the window. He observed the lights of the town and continued in a wistful, dreamy tone: “Cathars are the folk which, according to their beliefs, carries within itself the shard of the Divine Light. They are the folk which perceives the human body as a garment of flesh only. The Angelic Soul of an individual is trapped within this garment, forgetting its origin in God and it must incarnate into this world time and time again until it is able to return to that original state. Most individuals therefore go through this long circle of reincarnations.”
I couldn't believe my ears and this time, I let my displeasure be known.
Inspecteur Ganimard who just ordered the train crew away wiped his forehead with the white handkerchief and looked at us in reproach.
When we landed near the Greenland Pier at last, I was dead tired, hungry, dirty and probably looked like a drowned dog. Sherlock – all dishevelled, wet and wild-eyed - wasn’t much better off. Still, he paid no heed to his pains and broke into an energetic walk back towards Finland Street the moment he stepped back on dry ground. Too exhausted to do anything else, I followed him docilely.
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded in a grim resignation. “The message from Moriarty’s organisation. They are threatening me again and I am inclined to leave the town for a while to avoid any trap they have possibly in store for me. But I must talk to Guido first, he ought to know about this. Can you contact him? I tried to call him earlier but he is not responding.”
Blood rushed into my head and caused my cheeks to burn. Heart thumped furiously in my chest and I felt a bit faint from sudden onslaught of red hot jealousy and pain that enveloped my whole body. I blindly clambered into the cabin and shaking in agitation, I sat next to Sherlock, but avoided looking at him, preferring to stare out of the window instead.
Releasing Sherlock again, he lifted up the hem of his shirt and his palm deftly slipped behind the waistband of Sherlock's boxer briefs.
The second compartment was quite rambunctious as I approached it. A discreet look into its interior showed me two respectable matrons and the white moustached man caught in a heated debate, laughing five-year old girl engaged in a play with a basket which contained meowing black kitten and the burly baby-boy sitting on the knees of one of the women. The baby emitted the loud shrieks, evidently competing against the adults in this razzle-dazzle tournament. The party was so obviously Italian that I didn't even stop and continued in my course to the third compartment.
John shook his head in amusement, it was so Sherlock to come with such a remark. But he didn't respond. Instead, he stepped close to his friend who blinked sleepily at him, huddled in his coat at the threshold. He seized his wrist in a gentle grip and deposited a small object into his hand: a single mussel.
Third kidnapper, also masked, assumed a wary pose behind a counter. He stood at attention and bristled, aiming a nasty looking FN Five-seven at Sherlock.
“Come on then. We must not let them wait.”
Red eyes, mad like raging bull’s, met mine. The man roared for the last time and immediately went after me, his fingers twisted into claws reaching for my throat with murderous intent.
I instantly looked around to make sure that the beastly creature responsible for this savagery does not hide here inside. But there was nothing to see. The room was sternly furnished, almost empty aside from the drawing table, two chairs, the meagre bookcase and the oaken closet. The only striking feature of its space was the statue of Holy Virgin Mary placed in the little alcove opposite us, simple crucifix pinned to the wall next to it and the painting of some bearded religious figure underneath it. It contained very little otherwise. The thought that I previously imagined this room to be a luxurious chamber equipped with a large fireplace seemed so preposterous now.
I reached the pair in but the two swift long steps and placed my hand firmly on the shoulder of the Frenchman.
Meaty paws seized me and dragged me through the room, until I was bent over the long metal counter I noticed by my previous visit. The loud click sounded near me and in the next moment I found myself handcuffed against the rail running around the perimeter of the counter. Honouring the word given to Sherlock, I didn’t offer any resistance to this treatment.
Still, Sherlock didn't pay any attention to either me or his relative. He sat huddled there in the corner, slim thighs pushed against his chest, wiry arms enfolding his long shanks and he stared right ahead, frowning, lost deep in thought.
Sherlock resumed the place behind the wheel this time and drew into Silvertown at maximum speed, as if all the devils from hell rode at our tail. That’s why I felt as if no time at all passed between the moment we left the Victoria Street and the moment we sighted the ugly barracks of the dilapidated docks caught in our headlights.
Due to such proceedings, a dormant part of Sherlock's anatomy had woken up again and is begging for John's attention too.
Holding a bag full of thin wooden planks I patiently waited near the place where the doors to the first-class carriage should appear any minute. But from time to time, my eyes were inadvertently ranging over the platform, keenly observing the passengers standing to my left.
And that was our last peaceful moment that night.
And afterwards – unbelievably – he slowly turned to me, holding the crutch in his fist. His face bathed in sweat and he looked stricken. Shadows cast by sharp angles of his cheeks lengthened. His hollow eyes met mine and he shook his head faintly.
A little shiny light twinkled somewhere in the azure abyss of the sky.
Another object, dark, large and heavy, landed three yards from us with an ominous thud. Unlike the crutch, it never moved after that. I stupidly stared at it, registering the dust covered shoes, unnaturally bent legs, torso crooked to the side, blood-streaked face and wide grey eyes which gazed glassily at me from among the mess.
The ice-cream melted slowly in my mouth, cold and absolutely delicious.
The next half-hour passed in absolute silence until the Sea Garden Cottages came into view.
We collectively jumped from our seats and managed to catch her before her head hit the floor-tiles. We settled her into Vernet's seat and I checked her vitals quickly while Vernet was fanning her with the newspaper he grabbed from the nearby stand. Fortunately, she recovered in a minute and blinked at us in confusion, but she was still unable to emit a word and groaned plaintively until we handed her a glass of cold water to drink. Only after that did she wail: “Monsieur Arnaud… Monsieur Arnaud was shot dead! And the murderer…!!”
We sprinted along the line of houses on the other side, flying by the edge of the former dock. The level of water was unusually high, its dark surface glistened only a few inches beneath our feet. I often glanced at it over my shoulder, trying to observe the movements of the boat in the twilight. But it was futile. As soon as we reached the big building towering over the top-end of the dock, the stern of kidnapper’s vessel disappeared somewhere near the centre of the opposite bank.
“Later, my dear Watson,” he promised, mischievous sparkles dancing in his eyes.
Seeing the basket, Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. He bent down and took it into his hand. Rosalie just mutely looked at him, but she didn't make any effort to prevent him from touching it. The detective lifted up the cloth, checked the contents of the basket carefully and after that he showed me what was inside. The revolver, very dirty and bound with the cord from all sides, rested upon the pile of straw at the bottom of it.
At this signal, Sherlock raised both hands high above his head and kicked the gate open.
In the following half an hour we became human again. Sherlock used the bathroom first and dressed after that, while I relished the hot water under the shower.
After some necessary preparations, he crept downstairs and stepped over soundly-sleeping Sherlock sprawled on a carpet. PC monitor was still on, emitting the wan flare into the room. John took a quick look at it, reading the ominous words: “Il pleure dans mon coeur…” with a frown.
“Uh… Apollo, I think. We had such a statue at the university when I was still a medic. They probably ascribed some healing properties to this god, those ancient Greek dudes…”
“John!” Sherlock’s deep voice forced me to look over my shoulder. Sherlock stood at the base of the stairs and waved at me, pointing his finger to the other side of the room. “John, leave it! There’s another exit! Come on, we’ll get out through that!”
“Greg?” I uncertainly called out.
Sherlock stubbornly lifted his chin, his eyes steely and dark: “In a way it was me who killed those men. And yet I do not regret anything. I would kill every single one of them all over for your sake.”
“Are you picking mussels?” Sherlock's sleepy voice rasped over him some five minutes later, when he walked back from the edge of the coast, his jeans wet to the knees. “They contain microplastics, you know?”
“W-What’s happened?” Noticing my distress, Sherlock stuttered in alarm.
Scatter of small stones fell out of the decorative cone when he overturned it above Greg’s desk. The greyish pebbles spread over the surface of the table and lingered there like raindrops. We gazed at them in astonishment.
”14° of Celsius, north wind at 10 miles per hour, 91% of humidity, 60% chance of precipitation with showers likely in the evening,” replies Sherlock courtly.
He shut his eyes and cited the words he evidently knew by heart: “But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry, nor are given in marriage, neither can they die any more: they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.”
“A true patriot, huh?” I beckoned him with my hat in mock salute. “But the Saxon in question is very useful to France nowadays, isn't he? He works hard to recover some of its most beautiful national treasures, after all. Moreover, wouldn't it be fabulous if that blackguard Arsène Lupin was finally caught and put under the lock? The man gets on my nerves in the worst way possible, to be honest.”
The harsh, but fresh wind went right at him, reviving his entire being with its cold touch. John marched to the beach determinedly and as he reached the water-margin, he stepped on the rock, took off his shoes and put them to the side carefully.
“But…” He gasped like a fish pulled out of water, clearly out of his depth. “But why… why didn't you say that right away? Why did you persuade me that you would like to see me with her?”
The man stared at me searchingly for awhile. It was a decisive moment. If he would recognise me now, our plan would go awry in a second and I would be forced to improvise… I stood motionless, with a benign expression on my face, but my grip on the bag handles tightened a bit in barely concealed tension. I was like a taut spring, prepared to shoot up at any moment now.
"Merry Christmas, John."
John's phone beeped conveniently and he pulled it out of his pocket, grateful for something to end the thick silence.
"I might have been a bit out of it." John got up from the steps and ascended the stairs all the way to their living room. He poured himself a glass of red wine and handed one to Sherlock as he came in behind him and shrugged out of his big coat. The detective scrunched up his nose but sipped the drink anyway.
"Sherlock!" John yelled again, and an affirmative groan came from the bedroom down the hall. John chuckled and didn't hesitate to walk in Sherlock's door, leaning on the frame.
"Merry Christmas, Sherlock." John reached up and tangled his hand in Sherlock's thick curls.
? Distracted by what?" And all of a sudden it dawned on John. How Sherlock stopped in his tracks in the middle of a deduction if John complimented him, or simply if their eyes locked for too long. How Sherlock was married to his work – and had made John such an important part of it; always bringing him with, always listening to what he said with care. How Sherlock's insults were becoming increasingly
John stopped using the bedroom upstairs after that. Mrs Hudson noticed it at once, of course, but wouldn't comment on it for weeks, letting the boys take their time and adjust before having to confront others.
"Yeah, I got in to it some time ago, knowing you barely ever check your emails. One of us need to do it or you'll start shooting the wall from boredom again."
"You just left," he said, his deep voice sounding like gravel rippling up his throat, groggy from sleep and alcohol.
And just as unexpectedly, I felt how Sherlock's hand slid into mine. I don't know how he did it, but he suddenly stood by my side, straightened out into his full height and as taut as a violin string. His face turned into stone once more, but his fingers, intertwined with mine, trembled in nervous anticipation.
I won't ever forget the face our would-be Napoleon made when he spotted him. The bouts of mirth are still tickling me in my belly when I remember how his eyes bulged out of their sockets as if ready to pop off and to land on the floor, how his jaw slackened and a cigarette fell from his mouth into his lap.... but as it turned up, the rascal still had some surprises in store for us. Because even in the midst of the mind-numbing scare – which I'm sure was genuine – he had a presence of mind to stretch his left hand forward abruptly.
My fears proved to be justified – as soon as we drove forward riding a jetboat, the water ejected from under the hull of our vessel drenched our trousers and backs so thoroughly that not a dry thread remained on us.
“You are very eager, aren’t you?” He drawled. “Why do you want us to be off so quickly, I wonder?”
“Could have fooled me.” He replied, his voice choked with suppressed anger.
We retired into the kitchen promptly, abandoning Sherlock for the moment.
It was a cleverly evasive answer, but it came too late. The deed was done. One glance at that young chap, Didier and the words of that old guy were enough to tell me what I needed to know, what I already surmised. And the truth appeared in front of me in its naked wretchedness, as clear as a day.
A narrow cave-like corridor running along the individual compartments opened in front of me, silent and peaceful as the Diogenes Club boudoir. All passengers apparently spent their time properly seated on their places or were off to the restaurant carriage. This state of things didn't bother me the least, in fact, these circumstances played right into my hand. I saw how the door of the corridor at the other end of the carriage opened slowly and I glimpsed Sherlock's tall, stately figure behind them, lurking in the small vestibule there. As his fiery eyes met mine through the distance, I mutely signalled him that I'm ready. Then I sprang right into action.
“Love?”
“John. My lips.”
Sherlock stands up on the dumpster, more carefully this time, and examines his shirt, ruined with the wet of the storm and the filth of the dumpster. Though his back is to Mahoney’s window, I can clearly see Mahoney’s silhouette, and other figure, a woman.
It's as if, in that moment, all the Londoners at their various Christmas parties stopped what they were doing to listen to me as I made of fool of myself. It's of no concern to me, I would have said the same thing a million times just to see that delightful blush on John’s cheeks. I don't, however, appreciate Molly and Mrs. Hudson's interest in the matter. I’ll have to delete those photos later…
“Since when?”
“Reconciled.”
“I can see that.”
“Lestrade, aren’t you always encouraging me to be more in depth in my explanations? I’m merely trying to deliver.” The rain is really starting to pick up. Perfect.
“She was right, though. The coupon was expired.”
Sherlock looks around, incredulous, at our surroundings. The throngs of men, the heavy dance music, the ‘flamboyant’ drinks. “I’ll leave you to your deductions, John.”
It does bring to mind a more memorable missing persons case in which a jilted mistress was found dead in her lover’s chimney after an excessive breast augmentation left her stuck in the flue. I believe John’s blog post on the subject was titled
“Is that what you think? John, I am the most observant man in this world. I know what my options are. The rest fall up short. It’s not even close.”
A stakeout in Brixton. Not exactly necessary in the investigative sense, but I had a feeling that if I played my cards right, the outing could be quite beneficial to as before neglected areas of my life. Lestrade insisted on tagging along, but no matter. John rarely diverts his attention from me as it is, save for that music television special about spring break in America featuring women in soaked t-shirts. Which reminds me, any minute now it should…
I thought this new balance we had struck was working for us both, but twenty nine days in, I am sure of it. Sherlock is stumped, and I’m the only way out.
“Why did you never say? Did you not feel—did you think that I…?”
And there stands John and Katie in the corner, whispering rather seriously to each other. No doubt agonizing over which charming bed and breakfast to holiday for New Years. "A cozy place to ourselves, John. It's about intimacy, John. Why does your flat mate have a catalogue of your eye color in different levels of sunlight, John?" It's positively hateful.
“I know ash, John.”
Okay, now he’s swinging punches.
scolded when I gifted John a report on the reach and success of his sexual conquests organized by location of origin of each partner, duration of each encounter, and overall partner satisfaction.
“Just a few weeks, Raymond. Had to get back to work.”
Sherlock smiles ruefully and looks at me, more unsure than I have ever seen him. “I don’t think so. We were together only briefly. He ended it.”
I swallow, and stare intently at a scuff mark on the floor, deliberating. Could Sherlock really have just offered up this information to me so effortlessly? Has he really just answered the question I have been pondering for years now?
I want to hug him, throttle him, reassure him, but all I can say is, “I thought you were married to your work.”
I stood up and extended my hand, before thinking better of it. Sure, I’ll moisturize his lips, but I don’t need to be holding his bloody hand. “Fine then. I would love to see what your kind of pub could possibly be.”
“Why, John, I don’t mind at all.”
“Sherlock! It’s been too long.”
It's none of my business why John and his latest conquest Katie seem only to meet during the day. It's true that John typically likes to see women during the night time, possibly for the discretion the darkness brings, more likely because of the implication it brings to accompany a woman up to her rooms at night. It is of no concern to me if John and this woman chose to defile one another in the light of day, like some sort of exhibitionists. Doesn't affect me in the slightest.
I pull him down for an embrace and hide my relief tears in the crook of his neck.
“Not today, John. We’re needed at Scotland Yard. It seems the most elite law enforcement your city has to offer has taken to replacing their coffee with spiked eggnog. Tis the season!” I grab my scarf and head out the door, not wanting to look back to see if he will follow. Once upon a time it was a sure thing.
“Get a room, you poofs!”
I choke back tears and look down at my hands fiddling on the table, a coward. I speak with the same graveled tone I used when I pleaded with Sherlock’s grave.
“I know ash. Don’t. Tell. Me. I. Don’t.”
“And anyways,” Sherlock says, quickly brushing off his suitor, “I imagine those rumors will cease now that you’ve got Mary. Perhaps it’s time I found someone as well.”
I make my retreat from the bar back to Sherlock and focus on not spilling the frothy orange drinks.
“Nope. I don’t want your help. I’m really close. Plus I know you’ve deleted all the movies anyways.” I don’t even fold the paper down to look past at him.
John pushes past me on his way out the door. “That’s just when Katie’s available.”
A figure walks past in Mahoney’s window.
“Do hurry. I’ll grab us a taxi.”
I smile back at him. He's not angry.
He looks at me and at once I know he remembers too. I feel unsteady and lightheaded, and am immediately grounded by the oddly familiar feeling of those long, bony fingers entangled with mine. He looks down at our conjoined hands and feels at the smooth metal of my engagement ring. At once I regret all the signs I have ignored since I met Sherlock Holmes and hate myself for what we have become and what we should have been. And then, he pulls me on the dance floor.
The girls burst out in laughter again. The noises from the bedroom grow louder. I throw my head back on the couch and groan. Is anyone in all of London having a worse Christmas than me?
Molly, most normally impressed by my scathing remarks about her sex life, just turns to Mrs. Hudson and laughs as if I've just done something hilarious!
“No worries. I suppose I’m not cut out for the pub anymore. I’m not as young as I once was.”
I feel rain drops drip down my back into my trousers. Though I am incredibly uncomfortable, I am embodying the perfect image of masculine lust. It’s perfect.
"After what?" I yell, but he and Katie have already disappeared together to the kitchen.
Sherlock is a lightweight when it comes to Mrs. Hudson's mulled wine!! I hope he doesn't say anything embarrassing to Katie, who John brought to their Christmas Eve party!!!! (he does)
I take the container from him and gather some balm onto two fingers. I gently apply it to his lips, as I have done so many times before.
"You know what they say: practice makes perfect!"
“I don’t want to meet another one of your vapid girlfriends, John. I merely thought that your time would be better spent working with me rather than doing something hateful like ice skating.”
Now. I could care less that John has somehow further found a way to scrape the barrel of London’s available women. I don’t mind how smug and self-assured he comes back from his rendezvous, but that fact is that it is starting to affect the work. I tell John this as he attempts to leave the house on the Thursday before Christmas.
“Well, I’m going to the car to get my coat. And Sherlock, Stanley isn’t even close to Greg.” John skipped around the corner of the alley. I just love the way he runs like he’s trying to catch up to a man who dropped his wallet. My little soldier.
I tense and narrow my eyes at Sherlock, who, for some reason, seems to becoming more and more amused.
But she's wrong! John is not nothing, he is everything, and my everything is cruelly using my bedroom as some sort of love shack for his latest conquests.
"I don't mind, honestly. Getting out of the house, seeing you so excited about something to do – having and excuse to chase through London on Christmas morning – I'd never mind that. Not with you." John realised what he'd said a bit too late, but didn't try to make it better by finding an excuse. It wouldn't help in the least. So he licked his lips, holding Sherlock's gaze for a moment, then turned away.
"A cuppa would be nice, while you're at it," John called and went to his chair, opening the paper in his lap in case something had happened the last twenty-four hours that he ought to know about.
"I thought so. Was quite surprised every time I thought I'd been too obvious but you didn't mention anything."
"You think so, I can tell." John wasn't about to comment that the adoring expression that had probably been on his face and insinuated this deduction from Sherlock was due to his studying Sherlock and not the world around, even though the mix of the two made everything even better.
“Got back together?”
Katie stands in the corner of the room, smugness intact, and encourages John to come further into the room. My eyes are fixed on him and surely my mouth is agape, so I don't notice at first when Mrs. Hudson puts my violin on my lap.
Anyways, ever since that day, I have observed a disquieting tension in my flatmate, accidentally turned love of my life.
I stumble up from my chair, still looking at the man who has never failed to surprise me. I join into the melody, but falter when I see the look in John's eyes. Oh, joy! He loves me. Of this I am certain.
“This is a gay bar.”
“It’s Lestrade. A murder in Lewisham. Shall we postpone the segway tour, Don Juan Watson?”
“I love you.”
“Not to worry. I’ve brought someone with me. Come along, John.”
I feel tears prickle the back of my eyes. I can't hide anything from these two women. Their faces drop when a betraying tear falls from my face. Mrs. Hudson pulls me into a hug and Molly hurries to retrieve me some more wine. I all but blubber into the cup.
“I know I’m prone to disputes. I regret if it ruined your night.”
Once I know for sure John is tucked away in bed, I pull out my violin, as I have for the past few months. I have been fiddling for a while with a composition that, at its current stage, has about an 85% rate of getting weary, PTSD ridden army doctors to sleep.
Sherlock stares at is phone far too long and intermittently takes a sip of his fruity beverage. As I fester and threaten to overflow with questions, I look down and see that my glass is almost empty. The bartender from earlier brings over two more drinks without a word. I take a long pull from the glass. That really goes down smooth.
“Not Ella, no,” he smiles at me (why?).
“I have been doing some grooming.”
Sherlock beckons me to the door.
I close my eyes and curse myself. For all that I feel insufficient in our professional partnership, I never considered he could feel similarly in our personal one. I stand and brush the lone, errant curl from his face.
As if I wouldn't be nice. I look Katie up and down with all the scrutiny of a casting director at a modeling agency. Unlike most of John's girlfriends when I act up, she looks distinctly amused. Smug, perhaps?
"Oh, Sherlock. You're getting all worked up over nothing."
"Hi, Sherlock. Happy Christmas! Love the jumper."
I am sick of these two overgrown children using my crime scenes as an excuse to parade around and push each other’s buttons. I don’t know what they’re waiting for. They’re two financially independent men choosing over and over again to be roommates. It’s not like anyone would be surprised. Meanwhile, I’m over here trying save my job after falling asleep at a press conference last week—
