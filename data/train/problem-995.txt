"Not disobedient," John protested in a soft whine, dropping into Omega to soothe his Alpha. "Had permission. Was wrong. Hurt, yes. As much milk as you want," he promised, squeezing his breasts a little harder. He took Sherlock by the hand and tugged him reluctantly out of their bed, coaxing him to the sofa, sitting him down and kneeling in front of him, leaning up to suck at his scent gland submissively. He kissed down his mate's chest, giving one nipple a hard suck while pinching the other, rubbing his hands over his smooth alabaster flesh, trailing wet open-mouthed kisses down towards his groin. He nuzzled his inner thigh, looking up towards his Alpha, his expression sorrowful and apologetic, keeping his eyes fixed on Sherlock's as he opened his mouth and licked his lips, taking the head of his huge cock into his mouth and suckling needily, massaging it with his tongue, whimpering as if to ask if this was how Sherlock wanted it.
John teased fondly, nuzzling back.
"Surprise me," John yawned contentedly, "you've got a much better eye for that sort of thing than I do. Besides... it'll be good for winter, you know, when my bondbite is covered by a scarf or a high coat collar... a leather collar would still be visible at the front, let everyone know I've been claimed... Purely from a practical point of view, you know... Mmm" he hummed agreeably as he began to drift off, the scent from Sherlock's chest soothing and relaxing him. He felt utterly secure, wrapped so tightly in his mate's arms, and had no qualms about allowing his Alpha to collar him; he knew that Sherlock would always respect the boundaries he set, and wanted to give this to his mate, the reassurance of surrendering to him wholly, completely soothing and satisfying his inner Alpha. The man had suppressed his instincts for so long around John, never once attempting to bond with him or asking to share his heat, giving him space despite the instinct that must have been screaming at him to bite, to claim, to own; now, it was time for his patience to be rewarded, to be allowed to possess his Omega utterly, to show off his breeder in front of other Alphas and be acknowledged as one of the finest among them.
he agreed,
John nearly screamed with pleasure as his Alpha came in him, his eyes fluttering shut as he felt the huge cock inside him pulse and jerk. "I love being so full of your pups, it feels wonderful... knowing how much you love me, knowing you gave me the honour of carrying your children... allowing me to have so many... makes me feel special... I love how they make my belly curve out, huge and round... ohhhhh god, please Sir, please can I come?" he begged desperately, still riding Sherlock as if his life depended on it, achingly close, but so lost to his Omega that he needed permission now. He wasn't even sure he knew his Alpha's name any more, never mind his own; all he knew for certain was that the Alpha he was riding was his mate, had stuffed his belly full of pups, loved him, loved their babies, and had left a pure and deep bondbite on his neck. He was operating at the most basic instinctual level, much as he would when the birth got closer - later, when John thought about it, he'd realise he probably wouldn't say
Sherlock touched John obediently, feeling the pups immediately begin to turn and move underneath his hand as he pressed it to the soft skin of John's belly. The Alpha let out a contented hum. His fingers massaged the swell, working in small, languid circles.
"Piss! Piss!"
John opened his mouth to protest but his husband had swept away before he had a chance to explain. He wasn't embarrassed that they'd seen Sherlock feeding from him; it was that they'd been seen doing something so utterly intimate that they might as well have been having sex on the table. He wilted, his Alpha's obvious disappointment in him giving him an odd, clawing, shaky feeling in his chest that he didn't like. He stared at his food, tears filling his eyes, too upset to eat. Mrs Hudson saw him sitting there almost vacantly, gripping the arms of his chair, and went over to him, perching on the edge of the table. "Don't you worry, dear," she said kindly. "The play had only
- full to bursting, stuck in the nest and -
as the last one had been, modern and spacious with touches of the traditional, but without the secluded, private feel of the Gothic estate; that house had the feeling of previous families laughing and chaotic and large having lived in it, this one felt plush and sleek and like it belonged in a magazine. He loved it, but wasn't sure if he liked it more than the Gothic one. By the time they reached the sitting room at the back, with its wall of glass doors looking into the garden, his pert breasts were aching, swollen as full as they could currently get with milk. He whined as he began to leak, embarrassed, his nipples plump and dark and straining against his nursing bra, until finally he couldn't stand it anymore. He
Felix yet refusing to be put down, Sherlock allowed Beatrice to push the pram containing the other six boys. The elderly Omega was beaming with pride as she took the handles, pushing the large stroller with surprising ease as she followed the young couple out the door. Sherlock kept his free hand at the small of John's back as the small procession headed down the drive and turned onto the pavement. He pushed reassurance through the bond, even as his eyes scanned the area around, his instincts already on alert for any threat to his pups and mate.
John watched fondly, snaking a hand out into the pile of pups lazing near him to tug gently on Blake's ankle. "Blake sweetheart, go see Daddy," he crooned softly, "it's your turn... go ahead love, crawl to Daddy, show Uncle Mycroft what a clever boy you are!" The pup sat up and eyed his mother suspiciously. "Mama?"
"Just a bit longer," Sherlock crooned soothingly, wanting to build their releases even more, "I'll make it good for you, I promise." He sped up another fraction, adjusting the pumps another few settings faster, panting and grunting as he began to fuck his Omega harder. His hands moved to John's hips, holding him steadily to keep the pumps from swinging too much, controlling the pace of their lovemaking. When he felt he could hardly hold on any longer, he placed his hands on the Omega's belly again, growling, "Now."
John moaned whorishly in agreement, his lips parted in invitation, and the sound was the herald for a symphony of broken, pleasured noises spilling from the doctor while he continued to fuck the toy. Speeding up a little he whined, long and high, transmitting the fuzzy sensation of
Sherlock felt himself calming another few degrees as the scenting process continued, though his cock remained hard and erect in his trousers, his need to claim John increasing by the minute. Sweating, trembling, the Alpha looked as if he were sick with fever by the time he sought his pack Alpha's approval to mark his Omega. Mycroft nodded. As Sherlock undressed, the elder Alpha gently divested John of his shirt and bra so that the Omega might be better claimed by his mate; the action was one of entire deference to Sherlock, showing that the pack Alpha was willingly offering this Omega as his brother's to be claimed.
he pushed through the bond, lapping at his mate's jaw, encouraging him to take his pleasure. The next pup apparently wasn't in a hurry; he felt it settling, slowly shifting itself head down. He whined when he felt the head enter the birth canal, pressing himself against Sherlock more closely.
," she sneered nastily. "Did he make you? Blink twice for yes." She gasped as the size of John's belly became more obvious as he wriggled a little in his Alpha's lap, grinding against his growing erection. "How... How did you get so big so fast?! Did he force you to swell too?!" Anderson was still silent, an envious and slightly predatory look on the Alpha's face. The scent of pregnant Omega was thick in the air and he
" John hissed, arching his back and covering Sherlock in happy little kisses. "Always... Mmm, Sherlock, fill me up again, give me more," he begged with a playful grin, "make me grow even bigger, heavy with two litters at once... Stuff me with more of your babies, make me carry your third brood even as I grow ripe with the second... please, Alpha..." John bit his lip and rocked his hips a little faster, whining delicately as Sherlock's fat knot rubbed over his sweet spot.
They stored the fabric in John's old bedroom and the doctor woke early the next morning. He knew he'd need to be milked, but thought it was best if they did it after the appointment - he still didn't know if the doctor would be an idiot and heed the warning, and anything that might heighten Sherlock's possessive and protective instincts was best kept until after the scan. He dressed carefully and made breakfast, batting away his Alpha's attempts to help (to dampen the instinct to provide). He did permit Sherlock to fuss over his clothing, if only because he knew they wouldn't leave the house until the Alpha had satisfied himself that John and the pups wouldn't be cold, and an hour later he was sat on an examination couch, Sherlock standing imperiously beside him, when the doctor walked into the room. A doctor who looked oddly familiar, but he couldn't place why.
swell. Small, but unmistakably a pregnancy. He beamed and ran his hand over it. Solid. The babies had filled the available internal space and were beginning to grow outward. He showered quickly, drying his hair to make it fluffy and warm, then threw on his dressing gown and sauntered through to the kitchen. "Morning, love," he smiled, kissing Sherlock's cheek. "I’ve got something to show you…" He stepped back and dropped his robe to the floor, smiling shyly at Sherlock, and turned sideways to display his little bump.
Inside, folded delicately on a wine-coloured velvet cushion, was one of the most luxurious sets of lingerie either of them had ever laid eyes on: a baby doll top of the deepest black, the body of shimmering, pleated silk; a ribbon of lace around the hem was matched by the piece's delicate quarter-cup bra and matching thong. The thong had a precise, circular opening in the front panel through which the Omega's cock was meant to be put on display; like the rest of the outfit, it was meant for show, not practicality. Every detail had been designed to the Alpha's specifications, and Sherlock was purring loudly with pleasure as he watched John's reaction unfold before him.
sure that he didn't want John to go. John was
." Gripping his Omega's shoulder as well, he efficiently spun John around to face him, pressing forward with more insistent kisses until John's back was nearly flush with the slick tile of the shower wall. Mrs Hudson would be letting the guests in about now. And the bathroom was far from soundproof. He captured John's lips, his advances and attentions becoming more feral and needy as he heard the front door close once again. His hands had let go of John's and were roaming over the Omega's ripe belly, his pulsing, aching erection rubbing between John's legs. He caught his mate's eye - if John truly did not want this, now was the time to detangle himself.
"Truly, brother mine, this was your doing," Mycroft added, shifting a little as the sense of raw power and dominance flooding through him made his cock twitch and swell. "If you had not bonded with and sired pups on John, I would have had to wait longer to challenge our sire. But now all of you are
John's words seemed dim though the haze of the Alpha's possessive anger. But Sherlock began to feel his mate's distress reaching through their bond, could hear it in John's pleading tone, and momentarily slowed - at least until he grazed John's prostate. John's moan sent him thrusting again, spurring him on until they were both groaning and panting open-mouthed. The Alpha no longer bit, his possessive nipping lessening in frequency as Lestrade's scent faded. Another almost-knot, bigger than either of the two he'd filled John with that morning, began to swell at the base of his cock. He grunted and closed his teeth around John's bond bite once more when the knot finally breached the Omega's entrance, triggering both their orgasms.
, happy to do anything that would please his mate. When he received reassurance, he carded a hand into Remington's hair and smiled, not yet letting him latch on, but keeping him close. Precedence had to be given where it was due, so John locked eyes with Mycroft, purring gently, offering the pack leader the first rights to nursing at his still-full breasts. Scenting and stroking like this strengthened pack ties, allowed pack members to imprint on each other, but nursing - that was different, it was tender and loving, would strengthen the urge in Alphas to protect, create an extra level of warmth in the bond between them. Mycroft met his brother's gaze, more than a little surprised at his willingness to share his mate in this way, and waited for a clear nod of agreement before crawling forward, curling against John's side and taking a plump nipple delicately into his mouth. He was unused to the motion and suckled a little clumsily at first, but John's breasts were so full his milk barely needed any encouragement; soon the pack Alpha was nursing properly, nuzzling the soft mounds as he drank, unable to stop some little pup-like grunts of contentment from escaping. He was careful not to take too much, just enough to cement the nurturing bond, and drew back, purring loudly to show his approval. John smiled, finally allowing Remington to latch on as he invited Lestrade to take the other nipple.
He smirked and reached out slyly for his Alpha's cock under the water, stroking it gently to encourage it to full hardness.
he sent gently,
Oblivious, John mewled in pleasure, his body rewarding the Alpha with more slick and a warmer, tighter grip as he began to pulse around his mate.
, with your babies... oh, oh god, tell me..."
"Idiot boy," the elder Alpha hissed, towering over his son, "You pathetic, insane,
"We couldn't have that," Sherlock murmured lowly, cutting off another bite with the fork and bringing it to the Omega's mouth. "Your buttons are under duress already," he hummed as John chewed and swallowed, the Alpha already bringing another forkful to his mate's lips. The index finger of his free hand traced circles around John's navel in anticipation. "You've eaten so well - stuffing yourself so full just to feed our pups, helping them to grow so big and strong." He raised a glass of water for John to drink from, making the Omega take an extra few sips even as he groaned softly in protest. "Such a good Omega- just a little more-," he encouraged sweetly, offering John another piece of baklava.
Mycroft wrinkled his nose when he saw his brother's caller ID on his mobile. He pinched the bridge of his nose and answered the call. "Yes, Sherlock, the notices were posted last week in accordance with the law of this county," he sighed heavily without waiting for the question. "Our parents are of course friends with Mrs Bennett, who is married to the registrar, and is the silliest gossip ever to draw breath. I would be shocked if she had not taken great delight in telling them of your impending nuptials. Father has already phoned me demanding that I talk to you and persuade you to put them on the guest list. The fact that you have not heard from me will give you some idea of how our conversation went."
John paused briefly as the request came through, and sent a soft wave of understanding and love back to his mate.
But something strange had lit in his eyes at the mention of "Victor and his mate." If John had the time to notice, he would have seen that the Alpha's cock was becoming erect again, and that Sherlock was regarding him with a gaze both lustful and predatory. If it were up to instinct, he would have carried his debauched mate downstairs that moment to show their guests how much this Omega was
"Thirteen is... unparalleled," he granted." I must say, he is rather lovely -
Soon enough it was time for them to move on and they said farewell to the pair, and the other guests at their table, before moving to the next one. John had parked himself next to Beatrice, who was looking at John's belly with longing; he flicked his eyes to his Alpha, seeking. She was family, after all; Mycroft had been allowed to touch John's belly during the scenting after he became pack Alpha, and would be permitted to leave his scent on John in the future as well, since now the scent would reassure Sherlock of his protection and not be seen as a challenge. As the pups' grandmother, was Beatrice another acceptable exception to the
Persephone dug her fingers into the thin sheets, the pained moan that escaped her lips blooming into an exhale of pleasure. She curled her toes at the sensation as Mycroft skilfully caressed her, his breath warm and heavy against her sex. Her belly was still tight, eager to bear her pups, but her newfound arousal dulled the edge of the contraction and urged her to chase bliss instead. "Ooh- oh- oh darling-" she groaned happily, her legs falling open wider of their own accord. As she did so, the first pup pressed down again and found passage, making her bellow. She was the vessel for the pack Alpha's pups, and she was ready to deliver. Persephone had always understood her pups were exceptionally large, but only now did she truly appreciate their gigantic size as the head entered her birth canal. Suddenly, she was blissfully, impossibly, unbearably full. "Now-," she gasped raggedly, struggling to articulate when her body only knew one command, "Push- now, Mycroft, darling, now, I need to-" She cut off as she groaned, bearing down with incredible strength.
The club servants soon brought a wheelchair for Ms Howard's Omega and wheeled her off to the birthing suite, still writhing and groaning on her mate's knot. John's vague thoughts,
The house was large and white, more modern than the others they'd seen, set close to the road but framed prettily by trees and greenery. The first floor was blocked off into several rooms - two separate sitting rooms, a study, and an open kitchen and dining room. The next two floors were bedrooms, though there was a reasonably-sized playroom close to the master bedroom on the second story, which could easily be converted into a nursery, though a smaller one than either Sherlock or John would have liked. However, the rooms overall were airy and spacious, naturally lit by large windows, with dark, rich floorboards. While the front garden was small, the garden behind the house was large, the lawn stretching far back and framed by woods. The Alpha was pleased, but found nothing that particularly caught his heart about the home.
"Cake," John demanded petulantly, like a child promised a treat and then told to wait. "Want cake." It took a few moments for his mate's next words to register. "Both?" he tried tentatively. "In your lap," he qualified instantly, not wanting to leave his cosy seat. "Not moving. And while we're waiting... I think it's time we find out if I can come just from your hands rubbing my belly... don't you agree?" he purred breathily, mewling happily at Sherlock's kisses.
"You don't want to fuck me, it's the heat talking," John almost sobbed, Sherlock's order not to restrain himself sealing his fate. He had to obey, had to give in, however hard he would have restrained himself otherwise. He unlocked the door with a loud click, giving a keening whine when he heard Sherlock pleasuring himself. He began to inch towards the top of the stairs, the
- family. Several calls were made, and soon Sherlock was on his way to a large corner room, the pups squealing with delight as they rode down the hall on top of their sire.
while you whispered in my ear -
" Leo growled, his hips working furiously. The Alpha was obviously chasing his orgasm with the sole purpose of coming as deeply as possible inside the pack Omega. "You love it when we take turns, don't you," he rumbled, his knot pulsing at the thought. "Love it when we all sire pups on you, give you a nice heavy litter to carry..."
John cooed in pleasure as Sherlock cupped his belly. "Yours," he agreed happily, kissing him softly. "Mmm, yes... Babydaddy
there, Sherlock replied as he fucked him, his eyes narrowing as he watched John's hand try to work his small cock. In one swift move, he gripped John's wrists and placed the Omega's hands firmly on his breasts.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose at the stench radiating from the older body. He snapped on gloves and crouched between the victims, carefully inspecting their hair and the details of their clothing, paying particular attention to the scarves. Reaching into a deep pocket of his coat, he pulled out a pocket magnifier, efficiently examining the skin, pulling fibres from the scarves and holding them under the lens, before retrieving a small plastic baggie from the same pocket and depositing them inside. Finally, he stood, his eyes narrowed in thought. "Show-off," he declared brightly, turning to Lestrade, "Technique and originality don't substitute for cleverness. They're bright, yes, but not especially neat. I'll need evidence from the morgue - there are small flakes of skin on these scarves, nearly unnoticeable, that don't fit with notable a condition from either of the victims. You've certainly got a potential serial killer on your hands - but an amateur one."
John's words finally registered with Sherlock, and he glanced up at his mate before sitting back again, keeping his Omega pressed close against him as his hand cupped the spot his mate had indicated. Both Alphas laughed when John chimed in with his idea about the pram. "I'll see what I can do," Mycroft chuckled, not at all taking offense to John's obvious decision about his midsection, "But yes, baby brother, you were suggesting there was something I could do to help-?" Sherlock nodded; he wanted to provide for his family on his own, but his instincts did not mind a small interference in how he got to that point. In fact, instinct almost encouraged him on to ask for help in this matter. "John and I are looking at homes," he explained, "He is already feeling a strong urge to nest, so the sooner we find somewhere, the better. If and when we find a house, I would appreciate it if you would, ah... make certain that we really do have it, immediately. No long processes, no nonsense about other bids- the home we will choose will be one my mate absolutely wants, and I want to make sure he will get it as easily and quickly as possible."
Sherlock's lips parted a little as John spoke, his hands rubbing the round swell more sensuously. "God, yes...," he breathed, "I'll help you nourish our pups and make sure that both you and they grow big and round and strong. It'll be perfect, feeding you in front of everyone, showing them how good of an Omega you are, how well I care for you. I'll stuff you until you're straining against your suit," he murmured suggestively, leaning in to lick his mate's scent gland. "They'll all wonder why you had a harder time getting out of the chair than into it."
and was already planning to breed him again. Although the thought made him want to purr and rub his belly he refrained, wanting to prove that his mate had an obedient Omega who wouldn't vocalise without permission.
Sherlock, Remington and Mycroft meet a sibling they didn't know about
, Sherlock added,
Sherlock's eyes had widened as the yellowish fluid splashed onto the covers, his hands tightening instinctively on his mate's hips. He needed no coaxing to touch his labouring partner, moving to feel between John's legs. "Not yet," he replied roughly, "Patience." He, too, could feel the pressure of the pups pushing downwards; the skin around the Omega's hole was beginning to bulge with their weight, but John had to dilate several more centimetres before he could deliver safely. The Alpha purred in sympathy and pride, pressing a kiss to John's lower back before massaging the tight muscle.
John sent tenderly, gazing in awe at his bondmate and their child.
The Omega began to purr quietly, a low constant rumble, encouraging and rewarding his needy husband. He was glad that Sherlock seemed to be shaking off his previous listlessness, and began to feel cautiously optimistic that he wouldn't have to put Victor and his mate off after all; he was sure it would do the Alpha good to see his old friend again, to help him forget the uncomfortable return of guilt the morning had brought. John smiled as Sherlock kept suckling; it was good to see him consuming any nourishment with such gusto, and the normal rosy glow of health had come back to the Alpha's face.
The large tree dominated one whole corner of the room, wrapped in crocheted garland and fairy lights, decked out in an eclectic variety of ornaments - some from their home in Baker Street, others parts of a set, others crocheted by the Omegas, and some even newer - most notably, thirteen "Baby's First Christmas" ornaments, and another bearing the dates of the couple's two anniversaries. The skirt under the tree was invisible through the piles of colourful toys and presents.
Adam jerked awake in confusion at the noise. The baby seemed set to cry, his little face immediately screwing up in displeasure at having been woken from his nice nap. He began to relax by inches, however, as the vibrations soothed him, and slowly began to cotton on to the fact that his siblings were doing something he wasn't. He whined, then concentrated. His first effort only brought forth a small puff of gas, but at the second, a small vibration caught in his chest, and he crowed in glee.
slick between your legs and you'd
. He had bred John and these were the incredible results, tiny combinations of both their DNA. He purred deeply, looking over only a fraction of their family. The Alpha turned to kiss his labouring mate, showering him in approval through their bond;
The vibrations caused Sherlock to moan aloud. At the pressure and movement of his Omega's swollen belly against his leg, Sherlock felt his cock pulse dangerously, threatening to come too soon; he bit his lip, a strained groan escaping his throat as he willed himself to let John draw out his pleasure a little while longer. As John increased his pace, however, he quickly came undone, feeling his balls tightening as his orgasm pooled within him; with a deft flick of John's tongue and a particularly sensual rub from his Omega's growing stomach, he was there, coming hard inside John's mouth, his hot seed spurting and flowing with every pulse of his enormous cock.
, he murmured through the bond,
John lay obediently still, working his throat around his Alpha but making no movement that wasn't commanded. The world for him had ceased to exist; there was only Sherlock and his commands and his praise, the leather of the collar around his neck and the occasional tug as his mate pulled on the leash. The Omega's expression was soft and docile, his eyes fluttering as Sherlock fucked his mouth. He could hear the grunts of exertion and moans of pleasure somewhere above him and moaned gently, letting his Alpha know that he was enjoying this, that he was glad to serve him. In his belly the triplets kicked and rolled, visibly warping the skin as they moved, and he wriggled slightly to help soothe them, his hands clenched in the sheets to stop himself touching his belly without permission. Beyond coherent thought, nothing more complex than adoration and eager submission came through the bond; John spread his legs a little wider, waiting patiently for Sherlock's next order as his mate used him.
Sherlock's suckling grew stronger as John spoke, until he was drinking down the milk from the Omega's teat greedily, his hands coming to cup it and squeeze more out. He knew the answer to the question - it was him! He was Mummy's most favourite!
"Come, my love. Let's say goodnight to the children," he murmured quietly, helping John to the floor. Together, they scented their pups, nuzzling their soft curls and kissing their chubby, rosy cheeks. At Sherlock's soft command, and with a little help, the parents carried their babies two by two back to their cribs and tucked them into bed.
Next chapter should be much fluffier and lighter! More timeskips are coming up as well, might even get right up to the birth :P
John purred happily and crawled forward to rub himself catlike against the Alpha's chest. "Collar is perfect," he murmured stupidly, "means I'm yours. Means you'll take care of me, provide for me and our pups. Don't need anything else. Besides... hat's the only one we can't share. You'll see." He rubbed his cheek firmly over Sherlock's smooth torso, lapping at his scent and growing a little tipsy on it, his purring growing louder and deeper. "Open," he demanded, nudging the remaining packages with his knee as he tried to squirm his way into Sherlock's lap, so the Alpha could hold him and pet him as he opened the remaining gifts.
The skin underneath his hand fluttered slightly, as if the triplets within had heard their father's mention and wanted to accentuate it by making their presence known.
John whimpered as Sherlock entered him, stretching him perfectly. "All for you, Sherlock, you claimed me, it's all yours now," he panted. "Ohhh... Your cock is
Sherlock smirked as he noted John's scent subtly change to that of arousal, his Omega's pupils dilating wide. There would be time enough for that later; now, John still had his own gifts to open. The Alpha swallowed, anxiety stirring in the pit of his stomach. His mate's gifts had been
He pressed a reassuring, soft kiss to the tip of John's nose, the corners of his eyes crinkling when he smiled. He kissed John again, this time his lips pressing to his mate's, and purred lowly.
The colour in brackets is the colour assigned to that pup, to help tell its things like bottles and clothes etc apart from the others:
me... use me however you see fit, mount me at your pleasure, command me however you want... I want to feel your collar around my neck, nice and tight, constricting my breathing just a little... want to serve you however you wish," he moaned whorishly, tightening his legs around Sherlock and coming with a small scream as he rocked on the knot. "Would that please you, Sir? Having me collared and leashed, kneeling at your feet, mewling for attention, displaying myself for you, obeying you utterly?" He smoothed a hand over Sherlock's perfect arse, grabbing a handful of firm flesh and squeezing to encourage his Alpha deeper inside him.
. Holding his own children in his arms was something Mycroft had never allowed himself to believe might happen; now that it was real, he could scarcely believe how fortunate he had been. Five years ago it had all been so different; Siger had still ruled the Holmes pack with an iron fist; Beatrice and Catherine and Remington had been trapped and miserable; Sherlock had been desperate to claim John but afraid to act; and Mycroft himself had been alone, knowing the day would come when he must challenge Siger and unwilling to mate in case he was slain in the attempt to defeat his sire. Now he was the head of the pack, respected and loved; his family were happy and settled; Sherlock had sired a frankly obscene number of children on John; and Mycroft had claimed a mate of his own. The only thing that made it feel real in the moment was the solid weight of his two sons, snuggled against his bare chest. Mycroft purred again, a gentle rumble to make his little family feel safer and more secure. Looking down at his second-born son, he noticed that the baby had his nose, proud and aquiline. “Augustus,” he smiled.
to please his Alpha, to be utterly submissive and perform just how his mate wanted him to, trusting Sherlock to lead him through their activity. He felt his breasts swell a little as they began to fill once more, but the pups slept on, not yet in need of another feed, and he mewed gently as he felt the familiar pressure. Although he knew his mate would be able to scent his increased production he didn't move an inch, wholly trusting that he would be milked before he reached his limit.
"I know you will, but I want to hear you to promise me that if anything happens that you don't like, you will let me know immediately. I want you in control of the situation just as much as I am," Sherlock continued seriously, one hand moving in circles over John's enormous side. "And I promise this time will be just between us two. That is not to say I have forgotten about the others... But this will be our time, ours alone."
Sherlock chuckled, "If we manage to wake him and actually get him to move, he could break our tie." He ruffled Viola's hair.  Scanning the remaining pups, his eyes fell on sandy curls and a navy play suit. "Alistair...," he rumbled. The pup froze, then turned his head, looking at his father interestedly over his shoulder.  "Your turn," Sherlock informed him, picking him up by the seat of his pants, as he'd done with Miles. Alistair began to babble loudly, kicking his legs and reaching out towards Sherlock with a giggle.
after this!" His voice was high and needy, stuttering little cries of pleasure dropping from his lips as he caressed his belly, the touches heightening his pleasure, his small cock rock hard and slapping against the underside of his mammoth belly with each thrust. "Ohhhhh, my Alpha... so strong, so protective...
"I have always wanted you," Sherlock murmured earnestly, closing his free hand over his mate's and bringing it to his mouth to press a gentle kiss to the knuckles. His fingers splayed on top of the massive swell of John's belly, he felt their pups moving beneath, stirring softly in response to John's surge of emotions. "I could only ever want you." He held John quietly, closing his eyes. The Alpha buried his nose in his Omega's hair and inhaled his scent, feeling the radiating warmth of his mate snug against him, listening to the soft, rhythmic sounds of their breathing, which had fallen into unison. Pure love pulsed through their bond, and Sherlock allowed himself to lose himself to the feeling, to the sensations of being so close to his fiance, his Omega.
"Yeah," Lestrade nodded, shrugging on his jacket. "you're probably right. Come on then - let me buy you a pint." Mycroft fought the look of distaste - the idea of drinking
John whimpered minutely and opened his mouth, obediently eating the treat out of his mate's hand. The image made him want to keen and roll onto his back to present, to spread his legs for his Alpha and let him take his pleasure, but he fought the instinct, wanting to spend more time with their babies on their first Christmas. "I'm sure they will," he managed, a little dazed, "they're still only five and a half months old after all. I think anything longer than five minutes would be a stretch." Blinking to clear his head, John patted his stuffed belly happily, soothing the triplets who were beginning to stir at the spike in John's blood sugar.
everything so much more intensely and here he was, pregnant with Sherlock's pups, bonded, engaged to be married, less than an hour ago the man had milked him in the most tender way possible and now they knew which home they'd raise their family in, they could start nesting almost immediately and it was all so
compare to you. He can't even come close. Everyone will know that, from the mark you put on him. Have I mentioned how much I love it when you knot me? Christ, Sherlock... your knot is so huge I think I might actually come again, it's pressing on my prostate," he whimpered, his small cock beginning to throb. "Oh god... milk me again, please?" he begged, his body sensing the Alpha and making more milk to please him.
WARNINGS FOR THIS CHAPTER!!!
The sirens were growing louder. For a long moment, Sherlock met Greg's gaze with a calculating stare. "Wait until I reach the door, then remove the scarf from my neck. You have my blessing to enter our nest and aid my mate. Should you attempt anything more, you will end up in pieces." The detective trusted the DI fully; he knew Lestrade was better than to poach his mate - however, his Alpha could not help but utter the warning. In one swift motion, Sherlock rolled off the consulting criminal and yanked the man up by his collar; choked by his clothing, Moriarty thrashed like a fish out of water, blood burbling from his mouth as the Alpha held him up for his mate to see. Sherlock regarded the offending Omega with a look of incalculable rage and disgust, his eyes thunderously dark. "'I'll shoot your kneecaps and let you bleed to death,'" he snarled, echoing the bleeding man's earlier words, "I think that's an appropriate place to begin, don't you, John?" He dragged Moriarty over to the chair as if he were no more than a medium-sized bag of trash, and picked up the gun.
something inside him, and was working two fingers in and out of himself, making his scent roll off him in sweet,
"Did you lose consciousness after the injury?"
Sherlock was pressing another hot, worshipful kiss to the Omega's belly when it happened - a responsive pressure, right beneath his lips. The Alpha froze, his eyes widening. He waited a moment, hands slowly beginning to rub renewed circles over the globe of John's middle, the motions less lustful, and more tentatively encouraging. Then again - against his lower lip, and another underneath his left hand.
Molly piped up from across the table, grinning and holding out her cracker. "You haven't got a crown, John!" He smiled back and reached for the other end, his smile broadening as he came away victorious and earned a golden yellow crown. He pulled it onto his head, sharing a fond smile with his mate before starting to eat, his appetite returning. He couldn't help but glance around the table; Lestrade was happily discussing bizarre murders with Molly and Mrs Hudson was chattering obliviously to Mycroft, asking when he was going to bond and have pups of his own, completely missing the odd look on the Alpha's face.
"You need not use such words with me," Sherlock said quietly, reaching out to pull his Omega closer and nuzzle him gently, "I should be the one apologizing, John. You must understand that I want to protect you, I only want to keep you safe - but I feel like a monster when I wish to do it in a way that interferes so completely with your free will." He breathed in his Omega's scent, "Since you have asked, I forbid you to go back. I want you to support our family because it makes you happy, but I would much rather you do so from our home, or somewhere more secure." Tentatively, sadly, he nipped at John's earlobe.
"My Omega." Sherlock carefully pulled John's naked body close, running his hands everywhere over his mate's gravid form. He spread the Omega's legs and gently pressed his cock inside his wet hole to pacify him further, rocking his mate back and forth as he fucked him lovingly, reclaiming his upset partner with the utmost care and attention. His fingers trailed over the Omega's heavy belly, running over each inch of stretched skin again and again, cleaning away the traces of the other Alpha and replacing them with his scent. He kissed John deeply, the whimpers of uncertainty giving way to those of need and pleasure, Sherlock's mouth greedily pulling more noises from his mate. Trailing kisses along his jaw and down his neck, he refreshed the dark bruises he had suckled into his Omega's skin just the day before and added bright new ones to the tanned flesh, before latching on to one breast, so swollen with milk that it looked to be painful; the Alpha whimpered in sympathy as he began to nurse, milking the Omega with his other hand to give him more relief. He could feel John getting wetter around him and growled; it took control to claim his mate so gently after such an episode, when much of his Alpha wanted to claim the Omega roughly until he was crying out as Sherlock pounded into him, groping and covering every part of his mate he could reach with his scent.
The woman looked up sharply, startled, but her expression softened when she saw the prams full of pups and scented the dark-haired Alpha's pregnant mate. She remembered well how protective and possessive she'd been when she'd gone out with her mate soon after having their children, and didn't blame him for his reaction to her. She dropped her eyes demurely to show she wasn't a threat, allowing him that comfort, and stepped a little further over to the other side of the path to give them more space as they passed.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. John had placed the entirety of the blame on him, before. He sighed, slightly assuaged. John wasn't taking responsibility for tempting him, he knew, but at least he was no longer forcing Sherlock to bear the entire burden of the fault. It still confused him that John wished they could have prevented it, yet was still glad they hadn't. He sighed and kissed his Omega softly. "Of course I will," he smiled, "You'll look well on your way to full-term with one by that time." He thought better than to add that everyone would know that John must have been begging for it again, how he took it like a good Omega, how it would show off how powerful of an Alpha Sherlock was.
John mewled and arched as Sherlock began moving inside him, his exposed belly button almost brushing the sheets as the Alpha rocked them together. "Love being like this," he moaned decadently, eyelids sliding closed in bliss as he felt his milk draining slowly from him. "Love being so round and swollen with your pups, absolutely stuffed full of them... mmm, want more. Keep me pregnant constantly... always ripe with another litter for you." He grunted softly as he began pushing back against the motion, the feeling of the pumps on his breasts making him even wetter. "Faster," he begged, knowing Sherlock had the remote.
"No."
"I do know," Persephone smiled back, her voice catching a little. "Yours. Your children have been kicking me for
protective and possessive, but he knew from experience that some doctors ignored patients' requests to give their own advice if they felt it necessary. He placed a soothing hand on his Alpha's arm, squeezing lightly, before moving his mate's hands to rest on the swell of his belly, pushing his shirt up and out of the way so Sherlock could cup the bump with skin-to-skin contact.
him to breed me. The bump is so big because Sherlock... aah!" He screamed and lashed out as Anderson lunged for him, trying to pull him out of Sherlock's lap. He landed a decent blow to his stomach and instantly rolled off Sherlock's lap to stand behind his mate, growling angrily and holding his bump protectively.
One by one, the pups began to stir, kicking sleepily and stretching in their cosy Christmas outfits. "Oh dear," Sherlock tutted fondly when Adam began to fuss by his ankles. He shifted very carefully to retrieve the little boy, who stopped crying immediately, cheerfully grabbing Sherlock's curls with a triumphant giggle as soon as he was within reach.
John yawned, rubbing his face against Sherlock's chest, mewing to be petted again. He snored softly, rubbing his huge belly without waking.
John didn't trust himself to speak so merely nodded his agreement, striding out of the room and heading straight for the men’s toilets on the floor below, which he knew were barely used since they hadn't been refurbished in years. Everyone preferred the newer, shinier ones upstairs. He banged the door open and pulled Sherlock close the second it shut behind them, kissing him deeply. "Mmm... My strong Alpha... I loved it when you claimed me in front of them," he breathed, kissing up Sherlock's jawline.
John sat patiently as Sherlock took his card back and prepared to leave, allowing him to button up his coat and fuss over him to make sure he was protected against London's December weather. He didn't dare to look at Sherlock during the cab ride home; he knew that if he did he'd want to simply open his shirt right there and demand relief. When they finally got home he all but threw himself at his mate, rubbing up against him hopefully. "I know you're full, love, but please... please, I need you to suck my tits, just a little, I need your mouth on me... If you want you can finish milking me with your hands, oh god, please, I'm so full..."
not my place - yours - you, you own me... wait for - ah! - orders, try to - to please you...
. The Alpha didn't want control, didn't want John's submission; he wanted to make love to John, with John. Their push and pull had been equal before, and it had coaxed him into desiring to penetrate the Omega, but the hint of John slipping into instinct made him hesitate. He held back, slowing the movement of his hips, changing mental directions to focus on only the kiss and the way John felt as he moved beneath his hands.
John purred loudly, pressing his face into the crook of his Alpha's neck, lapping at him submissively.
he couldn't help but plead gently, however, even as his eyes began to close,
"At this rate you'll look six months along in just two or three weeks instead of four," the Alpha groaned, suckling even more eagerly at John's confession, "I'll make you grow so quickly for me, John, lavish attention on you and fuck you so well that our pups can't help but get larger in response to my nurturing. Perhaps I'll have to go out and buy you your first nursing bra soon... or maybe I won't, just let your pert nipples show through your shirts, your pretty breasts swelling - getting fuller, rounder, heavier - until you're pleading with me to buy you something to support them." He could feel John's hole dripping and loved it, loved the way his Omega was so needy, rutting against him. He wanted to sink inside his mate's tight heat while John whined and fed him; as he spoke, he parted the Omega's legs even wider, reached one hand down to circle John's slick hole and guide his mate upwards, pushing in slowly when he lined up his cock with his opening. "Yes, John - I love how I've made you like this, how your body responds to my every touch," he hummed low in his throat, his hands roaming over his mate's other breast and belly, "Do you think that if I commanded it, you would swell just for me?"
at regular intervals to beg for more tickling, and suddenly John was glad that they had thought to set a few video cameras around the room to capture the pups' first Christmas; they would be able to revisit some of their childrens' first words, at least, and John knew it would do Sherlock a world of good to have the footage of his babies asking for him specifically.
Sherlock kissed John's knee, feeling his own pleasure building lightly as he rutted against the Omega's leg. He put a little more pressure on John's belly as he rubbed; even though his knee was also stimulating his mate's small member, it was remarkable how much John responded to the Alpha's hand on his rounded middle - almost as if he were stroking John's cock. Sherlock smirked, rocking a little faster, flicking John's bellybutton with the pad of his thumb and continuing his attentions.
Sherlock looked up at John and gave a small nod, his eyes wide and trusting. He latched off just enough to turn his head, peeking at the doctor from the pillow of John's breasts. "Yes," he replied, "Hit my head several times... During cases. Had other concussions. Most recent was seven years ago."
Sherlock smiled as the burgundy-clad baby was placed in his arms. "Adam Gregory," he announced, momentarily bowing his head as he handed the little boy to Mycroft. Lestrade swallowed thickly and beamed at the child; he'd already known from the birth announcement that the first pup had been named after him, but hearing it out loud was something else entirely. Mycroft purred as he scented the little pup. Adam burbled and flailed his tiny limbs as the pack Alpha nuzzled his cheek, the feeling ticklish. "Alpha," Mycroft announced, and the pack purred and cooed in celebration. He passed him to Lestrade, the third Alpha of the pack, and looked expectantly to Sherlock for the next sibling.
"I'll give you all of them," John promised, drunk on his Alpha's praise and attention. "I'll let you breed me time and again until you've fertilised all the eggs I have left." He kissed Sherlock gently, then tugged on his hand. "Come on. We'd best go and re-join the others before our children start to worry we aren't coming back."
Surrounded by their thirteen sated babies, John gazed at Sherlock and purred. He didn't need to push any words through the bond; he felt blissful, complete, and knew it wouldn't be long before the triplets began to arrive. Already there was an ache in his lower back, ramping up to become contractions. "I don't think we've got very long," he whispered huskily, "this one is going to be
"No," Sherlock said softly, and took another few pulls of milk.
Sherlock nuzzled the back of John's neck, eyes fixed on the scene in front of him on anticipation. As he watched Leo begin to thrust with vigour, he laved hotly over the scar of John's bondmark, sending notes of his mate's desire blooming across his tongue. Sherlock smirked and kissed the spot. One hand cupped John's round belly firmly, feeling the heft of it, as the other massaged one huge teat. "No need to be so rigid," he purred lowly, "You're much better than every other Omega on the planet. Just relax..."
. "Mr Holmes, your pupils aren't responding properly to light."
know better, and I have no excuses. I got carried away." He sighed, searching for words, "You know I'd never hurt you on purpose. You're my-," again he stopped himself, "You're in my pack, and I respect you. You're a good man John, and you didn't deserve what we did and said about you. I'm sorry. Really, I truly am."
Sherlock quickly wrangled a larger box from underneath the branches and began to open it. "Oh look," he exclaimed with a hint of authority, lifting a soft teddy bear from the tissue wrapping.
"He is, don't worry," John smirked. "We'll do it however you want, love. But please can I at least have a dark suit? Then if I leak milk it won't show up as badly... We'll have to set aside a time after the ceremony for us to go into a private room so you can milk me, or I will
Sherlock returned the smile. The thought of the first appointment would have worried him, had he not seen all their children large and healthy on their own ultrasound at home. He was concerned, however, about the words the doctor might wish to have about the number of children his mate was carrying. "I've hoped you've informed them that they are not to mention... That they are not to argue against us keeping all the babies. Not that it would be much possible for them to do anything about it at this point, but..." he trailed off softly, blushing; it had been an effort to keep his voice even. He knew they'd been over this before, but all the same, the Alpha needed to be sure nothing would be said - he didn't know how he'd react if it was.
John slurred happily, the effects of the additive finally showing themselves; he felt pleasantly relaxed but vibrantly alive, Sherlock's hand on him sending sparks of pleasure fizzing through him. Sherlock's order registered and he felt himself relax further as he obeyed, feeling his mate's approval wash over him as he drank. He quickly finished it, licking his lips as he set down the glass.
he promised, as he hurried out of the nest to retrieve their food.
Sherlock was groaning, growling, whining as John spoke, his mind filling with images of a constantly bloated Omega - naked and bedridden with litter after enormous litter, his legs spread wide to accommodate his gigantic belly, eager to birth and be filled again - even as he was aware and engaging with his mate, his fingers splayed wide as John moved his hands over the round swell. His breath hitched dangerously as he watched John's heavy form bouncing and rocking on top of him, felt the Omega's tight walls working around his cock, burying him inside his hole over and over again as he rode him frantically, eagerly, wanton and obviously close himself. John's cheeks and lips were flushed, his nipples reddened and erect. The Omega's milk ran in thick rivulets down his breasts and onto the curve of his stomach, large drops dripping and splashing across the sofa and Sherlock's face and chest as they jiggled, the rest of the creamy liquid smeared obscenely over the Omega's gravid stomach as the pair worked their hands over John's belly. "Fuck, you're perfect," the Alpha growled, feeling his balls tightening dangerously, nearly on the cusp of his release; John's every word made the beginnings of his orgasm coil tighter inside of him, "Come for me. Want to see you come just from riding my cock and displaying yourself to me, thinking about how helplessly big my pups are making you. Want you to come because of how much you love how enormous you're going to be, at the mercy of your belly and breasts as they grow and swell, make you huge and heavy and unable to do anything but wait and grow until my litter is ready to force their big bodies out your tight little hole as you writhe helplessly and moan that they won't stop coming out of you, that you can't stop pushing them out, even as you want me to fill you up with more as soon as you're done, over and over again, always keeping you swollen with enormous litters of my babies..."
Sherlock smiled as the grey-haired Alpha became more vocal at John's breast, grunting and whining softly as he drank his fill. The detective inspector had been without pack for so long that the vulnerability of the action must have felt especially soothing, the deepening of the bond even more acutely profound. The older Alpha's eyes sparkled wetly as he pulled away, giving a soft purr and nod of approval to Sherlock before shifting aside to allow Catherine a turn.
Beatrice looked at her son with wide eyes, her gaze flicking back to her defeated mate. One hand rose shakily to her collar before she hesitated, suddenly clutching herself and whimpering softly in distress. Siger was yet her Alpha, but Mycroft was her pack leader. She had a choice of whom to obey; she did not remember ever having had a choice. How did one decide for oneself? Her eyes continued to flick back and forth between Siger and Mycroft, searching for a direction, for someone to command her - until she caught sight of someone between them. Two someones. Her youngest pup and his mate, so big with child. Embracing so happily. Should she go with Mycroft, she would know those pups. She could vaguely scent them even now, despite their distance. A healthy pregnancy.
John eagerly kissed him back, his mate's soft lips and gentle hands soothing him. "Never... Mmmm, yours... your babies," he purred, the Beta's touch erased, his inner Omega content again. "My strong, perfect Alpha... I know you'll keep everyone away from me, you'll be so
John purred loudly at the words, clinging tightly to his mate as he returned the kiss, feeling wonderful and relieved and proud of himself for pleasing Sherlock so much. He hummed and mewled submissively into the kiss, Sherlock's praise and attentions making him wet. He spread his legs a little before he remembered that he had gifts to open too, and when his Alpha finally drew back for air he smiled lovingly at him and stroked his cheek, pressing his forehead to his mate's chin. His eyes flicked to the bottom of the tree where his gifts were waiting, but he didn't ask to open them, or even if they were for him; it was always up to the Alpha to offer the present, to bring it to his mate's feet, to show he can provide. To ask if he could open them would have been rude, so he sat patiently, fighting the urge to lie on his side and spread his legs wide right there.
He leaned down to press a kiss to the Omega's forehead. In that moment, John was the only thing that mattered. He wanted to give everything to his mate, so sweet and obedient, so strong and stubborn, such a good mother to their pups. The Alpha's low, rumbling purr filled the space, somehow sounding in perfect harmony with his partner's. It took several long moments before he became aware of their guests' presence again. "Apologies," he smiled, looking up at the other couple as he adjusted his loving hold on John. "We were just discussing children," he explained to catch his Omega up.
of the eggs I dropped for him," he purred, closing his eyes and pushing his little swell further into Sherlock's hands.
John parted his lips receptively, slowly getting used to the sensation of a tongue that wasn't Sherlock's exploring his mouth; it felt decidedly strange, but the strangeness served only to increase his arousal, made him feel safe in a way he didn’t quite want to understand. The collar around his neck and the approval coursing through their bond wrapped around him like a blanket, comforting and encouraging him, and he panted desperately at the servant's teasing of his sensitive navel, groaning into their kiss when the other man wrapped a firm, purposeful hand around his cock again. It felt deliciously naughty. John moaned, rolling his hips to push his enormous middle against the servant’s as he was wanked and kissed, reveling in the sensations.
Sherlock had washed quickly and quietly, the Alpha absently scrubbing himself as he watched John get clean. His Omega, washing the evidence of his claim away. John had not noticed as Sherlock grew even harder with each bit of his seed that disappeared from John's skin and down the drain. His erection wet and throbbing, he'd inched closer to his oblivious mate, licking his lips in anticipation as he watched the suds running over John's shapely hips and full arse. This Omega was
Mrs Hudson kept the house clean and stocked their kitchen, but after John became completely immobile she knew better than to approach the nest. Mycroft knew his brother would be loathe to leave his mate's side at all, so he quietly arranged for the three other Omegas of their pack to move to a new townhouse nearby. They began to visit regularly, leaving neat little piles of food, water, reading material, case files sent by Lestrade, boxes of home-baked goods - anything they thought the couple might need outside the nest.
he asked, offering him a small encouraging smile; he knew Sherlock loathed talking about feelings generally, but hoped he'd be bold enough to say whether or not he felt closer to the other Alphas, more secure of his position in the pack.
Sherlock lifted the lid of the box within, and inhaled sharply. Thirteen hand-knitted hats and booties, in the thirteen colours they'd chosen for their children, were nestled lovingly within. "John..," he almost choked, passing the box to his Omega to see. They'd shared their plans for the nursery with the landlady, although she'd not been allowed in their nest - and obviously she'd kept them perfectly in her memory. They were skilfully done, and obviously had taken ages to make as a result of the sheer quantity of them. "This...," he began, looking up at Mrs Hudson with slightly wet eyes, "Thank you..." He rose to give the elderly lady a kiss on the cheek, huffing in surprise when she pulled him into a tight hug.
in his life. He clenched desperately around his Alpha's massive cock, begging for more, even as he felt the pain of the stretch. "Give it to me," he begged needily, "give me your knot, fill me up, please, oh god, I don't even know if I can take it, you're so
The Alpha began to apologize immediately, "I-I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like a bloody teenager- It's just-," he huffed a quiet sigh, "I was just wondering, if maybe... maybe you'd like to go out for coffee sometime. With me."
John nearly screamed in frustration. "Are you trying to kill me?" he moaned. "You know I need it, Sherlock..." In spite of himself, he took his hand off his cock, but added another finger inside himself, purely thanks to the need to have something in there. "How much longer will this take? I can't... I can't hold out much longer, I want... I want... you should leave," he finished desperately, unable to admit he wanted Sherlock.
an old sonogram machine from the clinic... It was due to be thrown out because we got new ones. It's old but there's nothing actually wrong with it... It's in the upstairs bedroom. We can use it to scan me... We won't be able to see any detail, not at two weeks, but we'll be able to see the little balls of flesh and count them," he breathed, smiling beautifully at his Alpha, mewling quietly as Sherlock touched him, loving the idea of Sherlock drinking as much of his milk as he could handle.
he sent tentatively,
he managed to push through the bond,
Sherlock looked as if he'd been slapped. "I understand you're angry, John, but think about what you're saying," he said in a small voice, "They're - they're still our pups." He could feel the blood pounding in his ears, his heart racing. His whole body felt hot with shame and fear. How could John destroy their pups? "They've already attached and- and-," he swallowed, running a hand through his hair and trying to collect himself. "You know I didn't mean to, John - I hadn't even consciously known I'd done it until I smelt it in your scent. It was pure Alpha - and your pure Omega, too. There are three condoms in the rubbish bin - obviously I'd intended to honour your request. The details of what happened from there are ... fuzzy, at best." He hung his head and fell silent. "Please understand I did not mean to ... to do any of this on purpose."
John took a deep, steadying breath. "Thirteen." It rang heavily in the silence of the room, John praying that this Anderson would have more sense than his relation. Before the doctor could say anything John spoke again. "What relation are you to
John whined and nuzzled him. "I
John whined loudly in shock and pleasure, fork halfway to his mouth. He looked at Sherlock, eyes wide, panting a little - and brought the fork to his mouth, taking a bite. "I'm still hungry," he breathed, "Can't get enough. But don't... don't stop..." He wriggled a little, pressing down on Sherlock's finger, before bracing himself on the table and hauling himself to his feet, grunting a little with the effort. "Easier this way," he moaned, one forearm flat on the table as he leant over the plate. His belly hung low, the topmost curve grazing the edge of the table, as he kept eating with his free hand. "Can get closer to the table like this," he purred. "Keep going while I eat." He stabbed another forkful of the omelette, spearing the requested fried onions and bananas, and moaned whorishly as he tasted it just as Sherlock brushed his prostate.
"Nest," John supplied wretchedly, struggling to press as close to his Alpha as possible. "Nest. B- Blanket." His eyes were unfocussed and glazed, his mouth hanging open a little, his hands still quivering just slightly from the overwhelming sensations. He'd never had to wait so long for an orgasm before, never been on the razor-sharp edge for so long, ready to go off on a hair trigger. Sherlock helped him to his feet and he leaned heavily on his mate as he was led back to the nest on unsteady, weak legs, all but collapsing onto the soft bed. He mewled helplessly as Sherlock dragged the silver fur throw over them both, snuggling up to him and putting his arms around him. He breathed in the scent of his Alpha's hair, the familiarity and calm of the nest and his mate gradually bringing him back to normal. He let out a tentative, quiet purr, growing louder when it was met by an approving hum from his mate.
"Mmmm... I agree. The second one... that Victorian Gothic estate... it felt like a family home… Maybe something to do with Victorians having huge families. I like that we wouldn't need to decorate it much, and the nursery just needs painting. I liked the garden, and the big windows, the red brick, the arches... It felt like somewhere you'd have grown up. I'd like that for our pups. I like that the nursery would be just downstairs from our room, and the fact it's slightly closer to the tube so we could still get to Baker Street easily. That one's definitely my favourite so far," he purred, mewling happily as Sherlock suckled at his scent gland, his scent becoming sweeter and more submissive to please his Alpha, the scent of the pups coming through more strongly in response to their father's actions. John wondered idly if his mate would be able to scent their genders, even though they were only technically two weeks old, since they were at roughly five week's growth thanks to the forced swelling he'd enjoyed.
The Alpha purred as his mate snuggled closer to him on the oversized sofa, thumbing interestedly through another page of a cold case file. Takeaway cartons littered the coffee table beside them. John's wheelchair, now a permanent fixture wherever the Omega went, stood close to the armrest. Sherlock nuzzled John's hair, smirking and obligingly giving kisses when his mate tilted his face up to ask for them. "Lestrade's actually bothered to give me an intriguing one this time," he murmured, nodding towards the folder in his hand, "Decapitation in a locked room. Doors locked from the inside, murder obviously committed in the location the body was found, but no sign of the murder weapon."
Donovan watched them with wide eyes, her jaw hanging open. At Sherlock's declaration of the sheer
, oh,
Put in on me?" he whispered shakily, holding out his left hand, fingers spread.
The next day he'd called for John, the order unmistakable, and John had slowly emerged - a bit dazed at first, but all there, focused and clear and present. For a few hours, Sherlock had John Hamish Holmes-Watson again. They'd talked, simply enjoying one another's company, discussing the potentials of current cases before fucking, John tiredly receding to his instinct once again at the end of it all. Sherlock had watched the sleeping Omega with quiet longing before retrieving his laptop from where he'd deposited it, pre-coitus, on the nightstand, and opening the latest case files from the DI. There were several new, but he chose the one he and John had picked together.
There was a long silence. "I'll text Mycroft," Sherlock said finally. The Alpha looked hollow and defeated, his face drawn, his eyes red-rimmed. He dared to walk closer to John to reach the nightstand and pick up his mobile. It seemed to take all his strength to type out the message.
"Just like this," Sherlock grunted, grinding his hips upward and growling in satisfaction as the sensation made John cry out. The sight of the Omega's face drawn in pleasure, his lips parted as he panted open-mouthed into the air, sent another surge of pre-cum flowing from the Alpha's cock. The friction of the thong's fabric was becoming lost as it dampened with the fluid, the slickness between the couple's hips increasing with each passing minute. Sherlock let his legs fall open wider, John sitting more heavily on his pelvis, allowing the Omega to do most of the work in pleasuring them both. "You've already- ah- had my cock twice today," he teased, panting. "But I've made you so needy, haven't I? Such a little slut for me." The finger that had been circling John's wet entrance pressed inside just a fraction. "Later I'll have you underneath me, I'll fuck the gigantic belly I've given you until I'm satisfied, thrust my cock against it while you whimper and whine for more, mewl about how enormous I've made you." He cupped and rubbed the gravid mound greedily. "Right now I love you just like this, wanton and leaking for me, only a few degrees of self-control away from giving over to rutting yourself against my enormous cock."
, John thought to himself,
Sherlock wasn't sure there was any breath left in his lungs as he watched the image on the screen. Four tiny lives that they had made together, growing and well inside his Omega. It was more incredible than any revelation on any case he'd ever had, more satisfying and completing than The Work. He gaped, putting an arm around his Omega's shoulder and taking John's free hand. "I want to see them all," he whispered in utter awe.
"I... I am sorry, John," he began lamely. "I have no excuses for how I acted, save my overwhelming concern for my younger brother. I never... never intended to hurt you, or to... take advantage, as I did." He looked at the floor, excruciatingly embarrassed. "I beg you to forgive me," he managed, "for my loss of control, and my appalling behaviour towards you. It will never happen again."
(See the end of the chapter for
you to claim me. If it had been too much, I'd have whimpered and scented distress and fear, and you'd have stopped instantly. Do you see?" He pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock's forehead as the Alpha whined and pushed closer. "We're not sleeping in the bedroom. I wouldn't punish you like that, you don't need to be punished. I was just proving a point. You're a caring, nurturing mate and you'd never put your comfort or happiness above mine. So when you've finished feeding we'll grab the leftovers and you can make us both some hot chocolate and we'll watch a sappy film and snuggle up under that new blanket you got me, and then you can take me to bed in our nest," he whispered, stroking the Alpha's pale cheek.
Something clicked in his mind through the fog of hormones and he reached behind himself carefully, picking up a large envelope from the bedside table and emptying the contents onto the bed. There were thirteen little hospital tags and thirteen coloured stickers, one for each colour they'd chosen. Each tag had one of the names they'd agreed on written on it, with space for a sticker so they could assign colours as the pups were birthed. He squinted at the labels, searching, until he found what he was looking for. The tag for the eldest boy. One handed, he peeled off the burgundy sticker and stuck it to the tag, handing it to Sherlock so his mate could wrap it around his tiny ankle.
Sherlock inhaled, and as he held the air in his lungs it felt almost electric with anticipation. A thousand thoughts seemed to flash through his mind in an instant as he looked back at his mate, each one of them answered just as quickly as a new sense of confidence suddenly flooded him. He could sense their strong pack leader securing their home, protecting them from harm. It put his mind at ease, relieving him from the burden of sole guardian of his Omega. Their pack ties, too, were stronger than ever before, he knew that they had full support from his family at any time during John's labour. This time, he was free to focus the entirety of his mind on his whelping mate, secure in knowing the rest was taken care of.
, he grinned, guiding the pregnant man upwards. He set the plate aside for a moment as he helped guide the Omega down onto his massive cock, his hands steadying John's hips and then rubbing his belly possessively as he seated himself.
. He huffed as he wriggled to the edge of the seat, bracing his feet apart on the floor for better leverage.
"Oh, my love,.. you were hurting too," John soothed, kissing and nuzzling his hair. "It wasn't monstrous. Neither of us would have wanted to risk what we had." He wiped the tears from Sherlock's face, purring as his Alpha's touch soothed the pups. "See how you take care of me, our pups? Good Alpha. Perfect Alpha, so protective. I'd never have allowed you to claim me if I didn't know you were good enough. Remember how I presented to you? I knew you were the best Alpha I could possibly have. There is nobody better for me than you." He pushed more comforting markers through his scent, warm and soothing and milky and happy, content in the nest. "Be calm, my Alpha. My mate. My love."
Miles (cherry) has dark, straight hair and John's dark blue eyes. He's a little more tanned, with quite a square face like John's.
Beatrice whimpered and clung to her son, burying her face in his hair, grounding herself with his scent.
don't you see?"
Mycroft cleared his throat. "Even if the others don't become vocal for some time, there would be no cause for concern. I myself didn't utter a word until I was almost four. Sherlock, pass me the gravy, would you?"
Sherlock scanned the room coolly, if anything drawing himself up to stand just a hair taller than before. He was still sporting an impressive erection, and holding the lead of an equally impressive Omega. Looking around, he knew his lithe, muscular form was easily the most pleasing in the room, and his cock the largest by far, unmistakable evidence of his incredible virility and the number of pups he'd sired on his mate.
"Hell if I know," Lestrade chuckled in amusement. The grey-haired inspector lounged casually in one of the plush, white chairs standard to all the venue's dressing rooms, his long legs stretched out and crossed in front of him. He loosened his own tie even further as he watched the detective struggle and round irately on another attendant who had begun swiping at his suit with a lint-roller. "Sherlock, calm down! You're acting jumpier than a goddamn jackrabbit. If I didn't know you any better, I'd say you have a bad case of nerves."
he begged suddenly,
They want to find us."
- this fucking good, you better never stop knocking me up..."
"You were equals," John murmured quietly. "He wasn't
John affirmed instantly,
"That one next," John demanded quietly, pointing at the sleek crimson-wrapped gift brought by Mycroft. His eyes welled up a little when Sherlock destroyed the paper to reveal thirteen little sets of dogtags and he raised his eyes to the other Alpha, seeking.
The ginger Alpha took the offered limb in his hand, bringing it to his nose and scenting it thoroughly. He purred in approval at the submission. Mycroft continued the process of the first scenting, moving up the other Alpha's arm, along his shoulders, nosing behind his ears, in his hair. His hands roamed carefully but firmly over the DI's body, testing the other Alpha's submission, marking his authority over the grey-haired inspector. When he was satisfied, he finally moved to the other man's scent gland, inhaling and purring loudly when he was met with notes of deference, and the barest beginnings of the pack scent mixing with Lestrade's own distinct scent. The pack Alpha nodded, satisfied. "Come," he ordered, "it is time to join the others."
John half-smiled, politely, but let it go, gently setting down the pups in his arms and picking up three more. It was a constant balancing exercise, trying to ensure each baby got the same amount of attention; not for the first time John was glad of his heightened Omega sense of smell, so he could tell which pup had the weakest traces of its parents' scents. Cuddling Iris, Imogen and Blake he purred quietly, nuzzling them and smiling as Iris automatically turned her head and latched on, suckling almost as she would on a dummy, just for comfort.
"Mycroft," the young Alpha hummed, pulling a small box out of his pocket, "now that our entire pack is gathered together, we have one more gift to give you..." Unable to rise from the sofa, he made do with bowing his head, offering the present to his brother.
you asked for this Christmas..."
so goddamn hard, it was
Sherlock clung desperately to his mother, as if afraid any looser a hold would allow her to fade away into thin air. He didn't care that the whole pack was watching as his tears stained the front of his mother's blouse - he had not felt these arms holding him so close for twenty years, or heard his parent's words of reassurance and love. "N-need you... Don't go, Mummy..," he begged, his breath coming in wet, hitching little gasps, "Love you... Please... Love you so much…"
Sherlock's breathing slowed, but his heart continued to race in his chest, pounding hard enough to hurt. "Could- might- what if they come early?," he breathed fearfully. He sniffed anxiously at his mate, trying to see if he could discern the scent of "Omega-in-labour," still wanting to rush John to the hospital, or at least back to the safety of their nest. He could feel the pups healthy and well under his fingers, but still fought an Alpha urge to tear off John's pants and trousers, to check if it was the Omega's time to birth.
Adam (burgundy) is like a mini-Sherlock, pale skin and dark curls. He has a face shape similar to Sherlock's, but he's got John's eyes.
, he chuckled, rubbing himself against Sherlock's neck again.
he sent,
John purred through the bond.
Sherlock glanced quickly at the preoccupied DI. Lestrade was looking Heavenward in annoyance, as if trying to show God that these were the kinds of people he had to deal with, and that it'd be nice if he took note and cut the man some some slack every now and then. Taking advantage of the distraction, the Alpha lightly cupped John's breasts through the fabric, giving them just enough of a squeeze to set them leaking, knowing the creamy milk was already easily beginning to soak through the vest and undershirt. "I think that sounds perfect, my eager little Omega," Sherlock whispered hotly on John's ear, the beginnings of an erection already able to be felt through his trousers, "You'll be dripping for me soon, considering I haven't fucked you yet today. I know how you get when you're desperate for me to fill you up." He enunciated the last words slowly, with a smirk of satisfaction as the Omega shuddered and choked back a moan. Recognizable footsteps could be heard in the hallway, and the Alpha guided his hands to more or less appropriate places, beginning to splay his fingers over John's swell. At the gasps and looks of horror from the newcomers in the doorway, the Alpha broke into a wide, toothy grin.
John came instantly as Sherlock knotted him, clenching harder around it than he ever had before as the most powerful orgasm he'd ever had gripped him, leaving him floating on waves of pleasure as he half-laughed, half-cried with the sheer pleasure of it. He stroked his Alpha's arm, keening as he exhaled, his body still rippling strongly around his Alpha's knot, milking him hard. It took a full two minutes to subside and when it finally finished John flopped his head back onto the pillows, grinning deliriously. He purred and nuzzled his mate, the pups still kicking excitedly in his belly. He pushed against Sherlock's face, seeking more kisses. "I'll carry as many pups as you want me to," he promised sweetly, so Omega he'd have agreed to anything his Alpha said. As it was, it took him another full day to emerge from his Omega; the hormone swing and the fact he was now trapped on the bed had taken its toll.
, begging for your knot... felt so good when you filled me with your come, so full it gushed out of me and soaked the sheets when your knot went down. I can't wait until you can knot me again... I'll scream your name as many times as you want," he whispered, kissing and licking along Sherlock's collarbone. "We should really start looking at houses and different areas of the suburbs... shall we each find, say, five houses and arrange viewings for next week?"
Sherlock's face changed when John began to use his hands. After seeing the hurt in his mate's expression, he didn't have the heart to tell him he still wanted more, wanted John rubbing up against his leg like last  time, too. He pushed the disappointment away to enjoy the pleasure the Omega was giving him otherwise. His breathing became heavier, his eyes half-closing in lust as he sat back against the sofa cushion. John's actions pulled low moans of pleasure from him, the sight of his mate on his knees, small mouth working desperately around his cock, making him more aroused still. Soon he was panting, groaning, getting close- almost too close, and the Omega still hadn't figured to pull off yet. "
Sherlock's enormous member throbbed inside the Omega, his cock already swelling at the base, the knot growing at an incredible rate. The Alpha nipped possessively at John's lips in response to the Omega's wordless plea. He could feel his release coming quickly; with every contraction of John's slick walls, the presence of the condom became more annoyingly apparent.
Satisfied, Sherlock breathed hard as his cock finished pulsing, releasing his bite and weakly resting his head on his mate's shoulder. The world felt like a blur, so far away as he struggled under the heady influence of instinct and hormones. He'd only given himself over so completely to his Alpha in the moment they first mated. He felt himself slowly, lazily surfacing - and then he heard a soft whimper.
"Yes, John, you're already growing, beginning to swell up because of my children. Can't wait to see it. You'll be outgrowing your clothes in a few short weeks. We'll have to work hard to keep finding things to fit over your expanding belly until you can't squeeze into anything anymore..." He moaned, rocking his hips harder into the Omega, "You're so close, I can feel it. Come on John, come for me, make me fill you up even more."
Sherlock blushed bright red, his pupils dilating until only a sliver of blue iris rimmed the black. He shivered as the Omega spoke, his previously softening cock growing harder inside his mate. "John..," he breathed raggedly, unsure as to whether he was mortified at the Omega's initial reaction, or dangerously on the verge of jumping his mate in a primal, lust-driven frenzy.
. He began to press soft kisses to Sherlock's neck as the Alpha continued to rub his swollen belly, purring and lapping at his scent gland.
John felt a little soothed by Sherlock's protective display and the unthreatening demeanour of the blonde, and once she had passed them he hummed softly to his mate, nuzzling him and giving his cheek an affectionate lick.
John glowed at Sherlock's words, a shy smile painting his lips. "I'm glad you think so. I love being special to you." He stroked Sherlock's hand affectionately with his thumb as their waitress cleared their now-empty plates and left them with the dessert menu. "Read it to me," John murmured lazily, "I don't want to let go of your hand, and the pups are wriggling like mad. Need to soothe them." He stroked his swollen belly in slow circles, closing his eyes, a slight blush on his cheeks as he was very aware that he looked utterly domestic and Omega. He hummed as Sherlock read him the choices and opted for baklava, leaving Sherlock to order as he went to the bathroom; pregnancy was already taking a heavy toll on his bladder.
, he realized with a sleepy purr, and when he heard the hungry wail of a baby downstairs, he knew why. He carefully rolled off his mate, and returned minutes later with his arms full of Adam and Eleanor, both pups eager to greet their mother if for no other reason than that he made their food.
mother... someone worthy to raise the children of genius. He'll see, when he gets back, when I'm surrounded by all those babies, nurturing them, he'll see how we could be a family. I bet he won't even ask me where you are."
"I'd never have used a condom, given the chance to have you I'd always have bred you, always have filled you up with evidence of my claim inside you, made you irrevocably mine," Sherlock growled, moaning as John's walls tore another orgasm from him, his enormous cock beginning to pump and pulse uncontrollably. He nipped the lobe of John's ear, suckling dark marks along the Omega's jaw and down his neck as he spoke, "I could keep fucking you all day, until you're limp with exhaustion but still wanting more, boneless on top of me but still moaning with every thrust. That's all you'll be wanting soon enough, even more than you do now. I might need to build a machine to keep fucking you day and night, pistoning a replica of my fat cock in and out of your hole, while the pumps constantly work at your breasts..."
John pressed his face into the crook of Sherlock's neck, opposite Felix, and the pup reached out to touch his mother's face, cooing gently. Sherlock's scent calmed and reassured him, and he felt much better for hearing the Alpha's promises through their bond.
and pizza
. The Alpha straddled his mate's head, facing away from John. Looking down through his arms, he'd be able to watch Johns mouth, and the Omega's heaving tits and belly. The bedroom mirror, however, provided an uninterrupted side view of the both of them, giving the Alpha an entirely new angle to watch his mate take him. He lowered his cock into John's eager mouth, feeling the Omega engulf it once more as he began a new rhythm.
"That's it, drop for me," Sherlock rumbled, whispering hotly against John's ear. "I want you to come exactly when I do, and drop at the same time."
"Hello, my darlings," Sherlock cooed, chuckling as the pups climbed in one by one into the nest. He'd settled the quints and twins safely on one side of him, giving their older siblings enough room to settle close. Felix made a beeline for his father, grabbing onto Sherlock's pyjama shirt with chubby fists and burrowing his head against his chest. The Alpha smiled fondly and wrapped a protective arm around him, extending the other to Iris. The little girl had begun to sniffle, her feelings of relief overwhelming. "Come now luv, it's alright," Sherlock soothed, drawing her close. He scented her soft hair until she giggled, the others waiting eagerly close for their own turns.
"I don't know if you'd ever have been able to convince me that John Hamish Watson, ex-army doctor, would take
He had patience, however; this was obviously something important to John. The Alpha made room for his Omega when John sat down with the heavy book, watching as his mate scanned the contents and opened up to the desired page, passing the volume into Sherlock's lap.
Sherlock snorted, grinning fondly.
Breathing hard, Ms. Howard snapped her fingers, calling a Beta servant. "Get a wheelchair for the both of us and take us to Birthing Suite 4 immediately," she demanded, "We have a reservation for this evening." Her Omega lowed desperately, making harsh grunting sounds as her belly contracted again. Her Alpha soothed her, rubbing her shoulders and admiring the display as the Beta rushed off for the wheelchair. "You're all very welcome to come, of course," she added, smirking at the other Alphas, "This one's exquisite to watch when she whelps. She becomes so primal in the heat of labour, like a wild animal."
- it was too close to many of his previous fantasies about the detective, when they'd been living at Baker Street and he'd thought the man could never want him. "Yes... please..." John keened pathetically, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck, pliantly waiting to be hoisted up against the wall and onto his mate's cock.
he murmured,
, get your scent all over me..." He felt his Alpha's tongue at his scent gland and knew that his scent would be telling the man exactly how much John was loving being fucked and claimed, exactly how much he needed and wanted the thick cock that was filling him, how completely he submitted to the Alpha. He knew that if Sherlock asked it of him, he'd present anywhere, at any time, no matter who was watching; he wanted Sherlock to be able to prove his dominance to anyone.
The pups cooed agreeably, and splashed contentedly for another couple of minutes until John began to ferry them to a large fluffy towel spread out on the bed in the nest; Sherlock was unable to help, since Felix had wailed and whimpered when his father tried to put him down, and refused to be separated for even a second from his Alpha parent. It didn't take long to get all thirteen babies dried and dressed with the help of the pack, and barely fifteen minutes later the family was gathered in the hallway, ready to go to the park for their walk.
Sherlock leaned in to kiss him deeply as their hands closed over the swell of John's middle. "You're so gorgeous like this," he murmured, his lips feather-light against his mate's mouth, stealing soft kisses. "I love you, John." He continued to undulate his hips in a slow rhythm, like the push and pull of gentle waves, his mouth catching a sigh of pleasure it was breathed from John's lips. "I've never seen anything so incredible as when you were birthing our pups, groaning and straining as your body pushed them out, moaning and trying to spread your legs wider as they spread you wide open. I stored every minute in my memory. No one has as good of an Omega as I do: so strong, so fertile, and a perfect match." Sherlock looked into his mate's eyes, "Even when you are no longer able to bear me children, I will still want you. I desired you even when I believed it would be impossible to have you - I have always wanted John Hamish Holmes-Watson, and he has exceeded my best imaginings beyond belief. My amazing wife."
He went a deeper pink.
"Yes, sweetheart, I know," she cooed, "Nana's right here. And Nana Martha will be here soon too, won't that be nice?"
Bashfully he nudged the collar into Sherlock's hands, shuffling back just enough to give the Alpha room to place it around his neck.
John raised a skeptical eyebrow at his Alpha's excuses - they'd been bondmates for a year now, Sherlock should have felt able to ask for anything - but let it go, waiting for his explanation. His mate's guilt washed over him hot and heavy, and he cooed soothingly, reaching up to cup his mate's face.
. He chewed as he grabbed a cloth and began cleaning, wiping down the cupboards and surfaces, every so often glancing back to Sherlock and growling a soft warning if his Alpha looked like he was going to remove his arm from the water. "That was a bad burn, Sherlock, your arm is staying under the cold tap for fifteen whole minutes. I can manage the cleaning." He got out the mop and looked up then down, deciding after a while to do the ceiling first. He made quick work of it and by the time he'd finished the floor as well, the kitchen was spotless and John's Omega was purring loudly, pleased that he'd made their home clean for his mate. He shook his head like a dog coming out of a lake and marched over to Sherlock, gently taking his elbow. "Let me have a look then," he said softly, kissing his cheek. "Mmm, yes, that looks like it's going to be very sore for a while... Let me get my kit."
pleased with you, my Omega, my pet." He stroked John's hair and crooned to him, swiping a finger through the semen on his collar and holding it to John's mouth for the Omega to taste.
John moaned obscenely when Sherlock's cock filled him, his mate's words sending shivers down his spine. He closed his eyes and gasped, feeling Sherlock everywhere; hands on his skin, cock in his hole, lips on his neck, breath against his ear, pups in his belly. He thought about all the heats he'd suffered through, fucking himself desperately on a toy, moaning Sherlock's name,
"Then let me give it to you," Sherlock rumbled, "I'm pumping you as full as you can take. You'll be far bigger than you were with the last by the time I give you these new ones, laid out in our nest for months-" He grunted and shuddered as he pistoned forward and another orgasm took him. "Can you feel it? By the time I'm done with you, you won't be able to leave our bed. You're going to be enormous again, an animal succumbed to instinct, your world reduced to pleasure and need and carrying my young." The Alpha felt he had one more climax in him, though the volume of his seed was pressing against his cock with each thrust, threatening to begin leaking around the fat knot secured inside his Omega.
more bite?," he purred hopefully, his thumb brushing gently over the fabric covering John's inverted navel. The Alpha relented, however, and offered his custard-filled plate to John. He hummed as the Omega began spooning the creamy treat into his mouth, and rubbed his mate's belly happily as John offered him bite after bite.
he grunted in relief, sliding his own hand up from their bellies to return the favour.
"I don't know how I'm supposed to be carrying any mince pies like this," he commented to his sons, as Adam tugged a fistful of dark locks and squealed in glee. Felix gripped his shirt tighter and watched Sherlock worriedly, as if afraid that his daddy would try and leave him again. The Alpha found a burlap shopping bag left on the counter and ended up piling a Tupperware container full of the Omega's treats, several bottles, and a couple napkins into it, just in case, before returning to the living room. He propped the pups against him again before unpacking it and starting the film, smiling as he offered a small, sweet pie to his mate.
, Sir," John breathed, clutching desperately at his Alpha's shoulders as his pleasure spiked. "I'll be a good Omega for you, so obedient, please you in every way you demand, offer you every fantasy you want... I'll love being round and ripe with your babies again, showing everyone what a potent Alpha you are, keeping your Omega constantly pregnant... Oh, Sir, your knot feels so good," he moaned deliriously, jerking his hips into his mate's hand as he came again, panting hard. "You'd like to take me to Pendleton's, wouldn't you Sir?" he smirked playfully, lapping submissively at his Alpha's jaw. The club was well known for its Alpha clientele, who would bring their collared Omegas along to kneel at their feet while they smoked cigars, drank brandy and discussed business; it was plush and traditional, all velvet armchairs and log fires and wood-panelled walls, full of powerful Alphas and their submissive mates. It was commonplace to see an Alpha petting their pregnant, naked, kneeling Omega's hair as they read a book or closed an important deal, full of the kind of men and women Mycroft worked with; making a show of your Omega at Pendleton's was a sure-fire way to gain respect amongst those more traditional circles.
"Well," Sherlock replied a little less stiffly, giving an uncertain wave to the other Alpha. "Though doing less... ah... detecting as of late. I've been a bit preoccupied these past few months. This is my wife and bondmate, John, and our children are over there." He couldn't help but grin a little as he looked toward the prams, the Omegas having turned the contraptions towards them so the pups could easily see their parents and feel reassured. He raised his hand to gesture towards them, pointing at each pup as he introduced them in order. "That's Adam there in the burgundy, Miles in red - then Blake and Arthur, Alistair, Benedict, and Felix. Then there's, ah, Eleanor in pink and Lucy in orange, Iris and Imogen, and Viola and Enora. And the three little ones who will be joining us in a few months," he added, squeezing John's hand a little proudly. The Alpha immediately blushed; he'd not meant to show off.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed at the sight of the woman, his muscles tensing even as they continued their procession down the pavement. The dark-haired Alpha's nostrils flared dangerously as he scented the other.
. His erect cock was pushing against the swell of the Omega's belly.
"If only," Sherlock groaned, "but I never considered the possibility until this moment...." He hummed thoughtfully, beginning to purr as he thought of it in earnest. "I'm huge, John - I was already larger than the size of an average male Alpha before we began, and I'm far, far bigger now... But in subspace ... In subspace you could certainly take me, though it won't be easy... You could take anything I asked for, almost..." He massaged more of the come and breast milk into John's belly, making sure to get every inch of skin. He wished he could take his Omega out in public like this, he thought with a smirk, half-naked and covered in his seed... His eyes widened a little as he remembered the Pendleton's, his mind suddenly lighting with all he could make John do there, in full view of the clientele...
Sherlock's breath hitched lightly at the soft spark of pleasure. "Tease," he chided, nearly rolling his hips to counter the sensual action until he thought of the collar. He immediately aborted the movement, his expression sobering. "Rightfully so," the Alpha murmured quietly. He'd put so much effort into making the collar special for John, had put all his love into its design, and now his mate would never want to see it again - it was tainted now, and John would want a new one. Sherlock wasn't good with gifts, but the Alpha had never been more proud and assured than when he'd presented the fine leather to his mate.
John let out a little mewl of pure want at his Alpha's words, the thought of being fucked and pumped while Sherlock encouraged his pups to move in John's belly making him buckle a little at the knees, his entrance rapidly becoming wet and ready. "Sherlock," he breathed, licking his lips, "you'd better be planning to fuck me in the shower. Because I need you and if you're not... I'm not moving from this spot," he whispered, kissing his mate's scent gland and reaching for his trousers, trying with shaking hands to unbutton them and pull down the zip, his own small cock already hard and throbbing.
Sherlock hummed softly in response to his sibling. He made a soft noise as he pressed more insistently against John's breast, demanding more milk; with thirteen pups and three on the way, his Omega was only swelling larger by the day to make the enormous amount of milk his children required, and in addition to John's size it pleased Sherlock to no end to feel how the creamy liquid came gushing readily into his mouth at the slightest provocation.
Half an hour later they were in a cab on their way to Scotland Yard, John eager to see the looks on everyone's faces when they scented the new bond, trying not to stroke his belly absent-mindedly. Sherlock looked over at his mate, smiling as he watched the continuing cycle of John's hand traveling to his belly, only to abruptly pull away as the Omega realized his behaviour. He draped an arm over John's shoulder, pulling his mate to lean against him. "It's alright," he said, "Let your hands rest on your belly. Just make sure it doesn't happen in front of the Yarders, or we'll give ourselves away."
Sherlock pressed John's head down further, encouraging him to take more without choking, groaning when John easily took in over a third of his impressive length. He increased the Omega's speed just a fraction, guiding him to move faster, but John had already set a near-perfect pace and the Alpha was incredibly close. "Christ, John, I-," he moaned, before John gyrated against him, the sensation of his mate's heavy belly and breasts sensually pressing against his skin sending him over the edge. He gave something between a gasp and a moan, coming hard in the Omega's mouth, his body shuddering as he released. His fingers were fisted loosely enough in John's hair to allow the pregnant man to come off his cock when he had swallowed all he could handle.
, his instinct supplied - the foreign object was restrictive, unnecessary.
John struggled to his feet as the front door closed and took a moment to lean on the arm of the chair before walking over to Sherlock, his gait slightly undulating thanks to his massive belly. He kissed his Alpha on the cheek, purring softly. "You did so well, love. I'm proud of you. Now come on, let's get back to our other twelve children," he smirked, taking Sherlock's free hand and tugging him towards the stairs.
Sherlock purred, a deep, low rumble that vibrated through his chest. He thrust as best he could to meet John's rocking, running his hands sensually along the Omega's plump curves to rest at his waist and keep him steady as Sherlock pleasured him. The Alpha could feel his cock swelling as he watched the pack's attentions to John, saw John nursing two full-grown Alphas at his breasts. Sherlock dipped his head to nuzzle and kiss his mate as he undulated his hips faster. He nosed insistently at John's cheek, guiding the Omega to look at the scene before him, rewarding John with kisses and the Alpha's enormous cock grazing his prostate when he did.
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully, his hands trailing down underneath John's enormous belly to feel the few ridges that marred the taut skin. John's growing belly fascinated and aroused him to no end, and the Alpha kept careful tabs on its development, often charting its changes as his Omega slept. He knew every inch of his mate's heavy middle. "Not 'worse,'" he murmured, "A few more, yes, but it's to be expected. You're growing so rapidly that, even as an Omega, your skin his having a hard time keeping up." He held the swell in both hands as he placed a gentle kiss to his mate's chest. "I think they're incredible. You might not keep your belly, but the marks will remain as evidence of how much my pups stretched you, filled you."
John perched on the rim of the bath, reaching out to turn the taps on. "I've changed my mind," he purred. "I want a bath. It's going to take a long time to clean me up properly and I don't want to be on my feet for that long..." He smirked and licked his lips, his eyes fixed on his mate's obviously interested cock. "Besides, we had this lovely huge corner bath installed... we'll both fit comfortably. Although my belly will sit high out of the water, stuffed with so many of your pups... But you love that, don't you? You love that I'm carrying your young, that you've given me such massive brood to carry it'll incapacitate me..." The bath filled quickly and he heaved himself to his feet, holding a hand out so his mate could help him climb into the bath.
but knew he would have to wait until Sherlock decided to let him have it.
"Ohhhh, yes, that's it," Emily choked out, her knot locked deep inside Brendan, giving short little stabbing thrusts with her hips as if to ensure every last drop of her seed entered him. "There you go, my sweet. That's what you needed, isn't it. Now make me some babies," she demanded, giving his rump a firm smack.
John purred softly as he moved off the bed to obey his Alpha's orders, any hesitancy or embarrassment he might have felt removed by the comforting weight of the collar around his neck. In his Omega state, slipping blissfully towards subspace as his mate dominated him, John could not feel self-conscious. He began to sway to imaginary music, undulating gently, running his hands over his exposed breasts and rubbing his enormous belly, licking his lips and moaning open-mouthed in the most blatant show of sexual desire he had ever put on; his actions practically screamed
... I look full term already and the pups are only eight weeks... Everyone who sees me knows I'm yours, with your mark on my neck and your babies in my belly... Are you proud, my Alpha? Does it please you that you've claimed and bred me, cemented your claim?" He crawled up over Sherlock and kissed him as the Alpha sat up further. "Mount me," he husked, a plea and a demand.
"I know you do," the Alpha rumbled, his erection now pressing insistently between John's cheeks. His eyes grew dark with possessive lust at the Omega's submission and eagerness.  "You'd have my cock in you every minute if you could, knotting you over and over again. You were made for this. Look at you now, mewling and moaning over me, desperate for me to take you again even though you just had my cock an hour ago. You're insatiable." He rocked his hips up against the Omega, encouraging him, but not yet giving him what he wanted.
John groaned desperately after only a few minutes, unused as he was to this kind of stimulation on his cock.
John's face crumpled and he reached for his mate again, clasping him to his breasts in a strong but tender hold, cradling him tight. "I phrased it wrong Sherlock, I just meant we needed a catalyst, something to push us into action.   You did what you thought was best, you'd never have forgiven yourself if you couldn't hold back from claiming me, even if I wanted it. We'd still have had each other, still have lived together and been close, that would have been enough. Don't be upset love, please, you
you didn't want to take a pill..." he rattled off.
he managed breathily, rocking a little faster on Sherlock's cock, arching his spine to accentuate his round belly, his gravidity pushing forward as he rode his made.
inside him, panting lightly. "Oh god, Sherlock... this is where I'm going to birth your pups," he whispered darkly, a smile spreading across his face as his pleasure built. "This is where I'll swell so big I can't
John whimpered and moaned softly at the thought of leaking milk through his wedding suit, at the thought of Sherlock having to relieve some of the pressure, remembering Sherlock's vow not to let him use the pump at all until there was so much he couldn't consume it all. He caressed Sherlock's dark curls, loving the feeling of his Alpha suckling hungrily at his tender, swollen nipples, his body attempting to start the let-down reflex to please him. Only the very strongest bonds caused a pair's biology to respond so violently to each other, John thought proudly, relaxing into Sherlock's lap a little more as his mate continued to lap and suckle at him. "Yes, I love this... I want to always be heavy with your pups, constantly pregnant so everyone will see how virile you are, keeping me full of your babies... Want to keep getting so big I can't walk, having to be pushed around in a wheelchair with my thighs spread to accommodate my enormous belly... want to please you, you really can't wait for my milk, can you?" he purred, gasping as he felt an odd prickling sensation in his breasts and a small bead of milk formed on the nipple Sherlock was lapping at.
The Omega mewed softly and gripped his Alpha's arm, gazing at him with wide eyes, trusting and vulnerable. He'd half expected a token protest, but had made sure he was wearing stretchy and comfortable clothing to handle his expanding belly. The waistband of the bottoms barely rose past his hips, pushed down by the hanging curve of his midsection; the hem of his top rested on the upper curve, ruched and stretched, and John would be glad later he'd chosen a stretchy material. He panted as the familiar twinge began in his womb, the copious amounts of takeaway food he'd eaten providing the necessary fuel. He groaned as his belly pushed outwards, swelling steadily, inflating before their eyes, but more than last time; he had been due for a growth spurt, and he cried out as it hit full-force in the space of two minutes. His growing belly forced him to spread his legs a little wider, the material of his clothes snapping tight over his expanding girth, his breasts filling with milk and straining against his bra. He whined, his Omega rising to prevent him from panicking at the sensation of more weight, his belly truly gargantuan and heavy, pinning him to the bed. He clutched at his mate, seeking approval, desperately nuzzling, his belly now so massive he couldn't hold Sherlock in his lap curled around him, his arms only able to reach around two-thirds of the way along his massive protruding girth as the swelling finally stopped. He whined, wriggling - and then the waistband elastic of his tracksuit bottoms snapped.
In short order the two women had been invited onto the bed as well, everyone tangled in each other's arms, nuzzling and purring, rubbing noses affectionately against shoulders and cheeks and arms. Remington and Catherine held back a little, having only met John once before, during the initial pack scenting, but soon relaxed and approached him under Sherlock's watchful eye. John purred loudly, glad of the company of other Omegas, of the assurance of affection and protection for his pups from their half-uncle and step-grandmother as well as Beatrice. It felt comfortable, without awkwardness, despite the fact that Sherlock was half-naked and John was completely nude; there was no need for Alpha posturing between the two brothers. This was family, unquestioning loyalty and the knowledge of automatic protection soothed the group; Mycroft had proved himself to be a generous pack leader, allowing his pack members as much freedom as they wished, never attempting to interfere unless it was necessary. John sat happily leaning back against his mate as Mycroft nosed across his forehead and into his hair, stroking a thumb across Remington's cheekbones as Sherlock and his mother held hands, Catherine rubbing her cheek submissively against the pack Alpha's chest.
"Ngh - so many," John squeaked, achingly close, knowing Sherlock was drawing it out to hear him moan and praise him but quivering with pleasure too exquisite for him to care. "So many times I got wet for you, in alleyways or on stakeouts, I imagined you scenting it and following it to the source and realising it was me, making me take your cock right there, sometimes even with your hand over my mouth to keep me quiet..." He bit his lip, rocking desperately on Sherlock's cock. "Please let me come Sherlock, please, I'm so close, oh god... yes, oh fuck, yes... such a needy little whore for you, Sherlock, I couldn't even stop myself from fucking myself in your bed outside of heat sometimes... please, Sherlock, please tell me, you had fantasies too, you must have, did you think about how you'd claim me? Oh god, please tell me, please let me come, please!"
he sent through the bond, slipping his free arm around Sherlock's waist, not relinquishing the kiss,
Sherlock cast his gaze over their sleeping brood once more, making sure each was asleep and accounted for. Satisfied, he turned back to John. "Terrible. Better with everyone here, but still terrible," he murmured, cuddling up to John and resting his head on the Omega's shoulder. He splayed a hand over John's bump. "I want to go home. This bed is too firm, and these pyjamas itch. They're like paper," he complained, wrinkling his nose, "I much prefer the purple silk set you bought me for my birthday." The IV needle in his arm began to itch, and he flexed his fingers, fighting the urge to scratch at it; it had taken several tries to find the Alpha's ruined veins, and touching the bruised skin would be a much more unpleasant sensation.
Sherlock placed a gentle kiss to his mate's temple. He lifted his eyes as a loud wail of displeasure rose from among the happy pups, Alistair having just decided that he did not like this bath very much at all, and was most certainly not having fun. With an apologetic kiss, the Alpha shifted his mate off his lap to tend to the little one. He smiled sympathetically as he lifted the little Alpha from his baby bath, careful to keep the wet, wriggling pup held securely in his arms. "Yes, yes, I remember," the Alpha cooed, "You don't like the water very much at all, do you?" It was true - Alistair was never happy at bathtimes, and it had always been a struggle to get the pup washed as he cried and flailed in protest. Not even bathing him with his siblings had seemed to help, the tiny Alpha ignoring their squeals of joy in favour of wallowing in his own frustration. Instead of removing him from the tub, however, Sherlock took him further under the spray, careful to keep the baby's eyes shielded from the water droplets. The father hummed softly to his son, nuzzling his damp, sandy curls, giving him his complete love and attention as the warm shower gently soaked them both. And slowly, tentatively, the baby began to calm.
John needed a few moments to calm himself, becoming a little overwhelmed with the cuteness of the gifts and the reminder that in seven months he'd be birthing a huge litter of Sherlock's babies. He smiled weakly at his mate when Mrs Hudson finally released him, pressing into him to ground himself with the Alpha's scent. He looked at Mrs Hudson, gratitude and emotion shining in his eyes, before being brought back to the present by his mate reaching for the final gift.
He cradled Sherlock's head as he guided him to his other nipple, kissing his forehead in approval when he latched on and began to nurse again with undiminished enthusiasm.
John hummed happily as he took Sherlock's enormous erection into his mouth, sucking greedily, stroking the base with his hands, almost milking it. He swirled his tongue over the head as he began to move, building a rhythm, rubbing his belly and breasts against Sherlock's leg the way he knew he liked, bobbing his head eagerly, wanting his Alpha's orgasm to be quick and intense. He reached for one of Sherlock's hands and placed it on his head, encouraging his mate to wind his fingers into his hair, to help him direct and control his movements.
"The Landau, and a tiered white frosted Madeira cake with orchids down one side," John declared happily. "As for colours... Blue and white, like the tape at crime scenes," he smiled lazily. "And I'm not wearing a dress, git." He smacked him playfully. "I might be pregnant but I'm still wearing a suit. Are we both having a best man?"
out his remaining potential as long as possible, siring smaller litters such as this one until he has no more to bear. But he knows I can't get enough of him like this - if there were a way to -
"It would be my pleasure," Sherlock growled, cupping the small mounds, "I can't wait to feel the weight of them in my hands, can't wait until they expand and fill out so much that I can't splay my fingers wide enough to hold all of them. I'll make sure you have my mouth, claim you as often as you like - almost every time you need relief in the beginning, until you produce so much that I can't possible drink it all. Then I will allow you to use the pump."  He kissed down his Omega's neck hotly.
John obeyed gladly, his breathy panting crescendoing into a constant stream of pleasured little cries, wailing moans and hitching sobs as he grew utterly wanton and incoherent with bliss. His eyes rolled back as he clutched Sherlock's neck, barely able to hang on, fighting to keep his coherent mind. The exquisite pleasure of his mate's cock and rough claiming had left him teetering on the edge of subspace again; with permission, he would easily lose himself to the dreamlike state. John's desperate need flowed through the bond;
Sherlock's breath grew shallow as he watched his mate, the toy just visible underneath the girth of John's full middle. Never had he asked his mate to do something like this, and rarely had he fantasized about it - it didn't occur to most Alphas to imagine an Omega taking pleasure in fucking something like this, though Omega-on-Omega scenarios were common. "God, that's it...," he murmured, his cock so hard it ached, but his fingers clenching the sheets tightly; if he touched himself now, he would come far too soon. His hips rocked disobediently, thrusting lightly against nothing but air.
When they were once again alone, the Alpha's hands snaked around John's front, caressing his mate's belly with his own hands, cupping the Omega's emptied breasts, pushing his pride and approval in strong waves through their bond. His lips found John's and he kissed him deeply, his heart swelling with love for his mate and what he'd done.
"Ah, Mr Holmes, excellent - it was you I needed to speak to," Doctor Anderson said. "I wanted to talk more with you about post-birth knotting, after our last appointment. As I've said before, Omegas will sometimes reject the advances of their Alphas after birthing, until they can be sure the litter will be well provided for and that any additional pups would be too. That said, there are a few more things we need to discuss. Firstly, the Omega will not be fertile immediately. After the last pup is born, there will be a short wait for the afterbirth, and then around an hour later the womb lining will have replenished itself and a microheat will start, lasting anywhere between six and twelve hours. During this time, the Omega will be as fertile as during normal heat, and Alpha sperm can stay alive inside an Omega for up to a week, so any sexual activity after the afterbirth has passed could result in a pregnancy. I have to tell you that I think it is extremely likely that Doctor Holmes-Watson will sleep through much if not all of his microheat - birthing thirteen pups will be exhausting even for an Omega. However, he may still be - receptive, when he is asleep. It is the
He pushed his pride and pleasure strongly through their bond, kissing along John's jaw before moaning blissfully into his neck as he came, his knot pushing past the Omega's entrance and beginning to swell.
Sherlock suckled more eagerly, giving a rumbling purr as milk flooded his mouth, his cock seeming to become even more engorged with each pull. After draining half the breast, he was shifting to the other side, drinking so quickly as to make his Omega mewl in discomfort, grunting and thrusting his hips lightly as John smoothed a hand over the sensitive head of his cock. His belly had begun to smart from its fullness when he finally popped off with a wet sound, licking his lips to catch the last drops of John's creamy milk, beginning to pant as his desire rose. He wasted no time in fulfilling the next event in the Omega's prediction; the need to knot and claim his mate was rapidly becoming unbearable. The ten minutes were well up as he quickly rolled his John on his side with lust-darkened eyes, hooking an arm underneath John's knee to spread the pregnant Omega's legs as wide as they could go. His enormous, swollen cock was throbbing heavily. It looked far too massive to even begin to fit in John's tight little hole. With a growl, Sherlock bit deeply into their bond bite, giving the Omega the pain of the wound to distract him from the pain of being stretched so incredibly wide as Sherlock snapped his hips and rammed inside.

John's legs turned to water as his mate claimed his lips, and whined breathily into the kiss.
," he gasped, eyes wide as the Detective Inspector rushed toward him,
Sherlock growled quietly. "As if I would let you," he rumbled, nipping softly at John's earlobe. "You of all people should know I am more than pleased at the thought of everyone knowing of our activities, of how full I've made you." He smirked, subtly cupping his wife's breast, "
