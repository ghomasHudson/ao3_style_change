They talk for a few more minutes, but then Jack starts to yawn. “Alright,” Castiel says, patting the bed and getting up. “Bedtime. Sleep well.”
It’s the best he’s going to get right now, so Dean takes it. He roots around for Cas's other hand and puts it back on his head, wriggling on the bed to get comfortable again..
Cas was quick to shake his head, holding his hands up to try and placate him. “Dean, no. I checked. If he was still there, I wouldn’t even be able to see inside your head. I swear to you he’s gone.”
He came to with his body hurting all over and his ears ringing with noise. After a while he realized the noise was not inside his head but was actually people yelling. Also he was laying on something soft but he couldn’t remember going to bed? What was going on?
Without looking at any of them, Dean had stammered out a thank you, and then closed the guitar case again and reverently set it aside. He was quiet through the rest of his birthday breakfast, and for days after, the guitar seemed to sit untouched in their room. Castiel had figured that maybe Dean just wasn’t ready yet to let himself have this thing that was for him and him only.
“Yeah, well… he’s right. Just needed some sleep.” Dean offers Jack a reassuring smile but the kid still looks uncertain. Dean sighs. “Jack… it’s not your job to worry about me. I’ve got Sam and Eileen and Cas looking after me. You trust them to do a good job, right?”
They’ve reached the motel parking lot by now, and Dean parks a couple spots away from Eileen’s beat-up Toyota Corolla. Baby’s engine ticks as it cools down, but neither of them makes any move to get out of the car.
Cas brings up Nachzehrers but quickly dismisses the idea again since it doesn’t seem low profile enough for them. There’s been no sign of increased demon activity in the area so the others argue back and forth for a while about the possibility of djinn or witches until it’s determined that they don’t have enough to go on for a solid theory.
Not that it mattered—Dean wasn’t actually asleep anymore. He was going to “wake up” in a moment and then he’d watch another movie with Cas. Or teach him how to play foosball. Anything to keep him here.
"Dean, have you been letting yourself rest enough?" He asks, clearly worried, and reaches out to gently stroke the skin under Dean's eye with a thumb.
Walking up to look over Dean’s shoulder, Castiel sees a notebook page where, in big block letters, it says “FOR YOUR SWIM LESSONS.” Dean has a pen in hand and appears to be trying to copy the letters onto a card. He seems to have gotten stuck right on the first letter : his ‘F’ backwards and wobbly and full of extra strokes. Castiel doubts he’d have recognized it if he didn’t know what Dean was trying to write.
It’s fully dark the next time he wakes, but the curtains are drawn to the side to let the moonlight in. There’s a nice cool breeze coming in through the tilted window and Dean can see a few stars. He’s lying curled up against Cas with his head on his thigh while Cas is leaning against the headboard, a hand resting on the curve of Dean’s side.
Cas is sitting beside Dean, which is nice, and he nags Dean about slowing down, which is less nice, but it's still attention Dean's getting from him, and Dean is really pathetic for attention from Cas. Not pathetic enough to
The kids show Jack how to move his arms and where to stand and then they take up the game again. By the end of the day Jack’s going to have sore arms and sand in uncomfortable places, but he’s laughing, all sadness forgotten for the moment, so Dean thinks it’s going to be worth it.
When he’s feeling better, Castiel vows to make love to Dean as thoroughly and as tenderly as he knows how to.
how long you’d already been under? To realize you’re not breathing? To be doing CPR and emergency breaths and have no idea if it’s already too late and you’re
Cas has turned the one on his side off as well and has shimmied down the bed to lie beside him. Dean rolls over and right into his open arms with a sigh. He puts his sleep mask on so that Cas can use his lamp to read or watch something after Dean’s asleep. Then he tucks himself close, his arms going around Cas’s waist. Cas rubs his back, slow soothing circles.
Even though it hurts to see him like this, Castiel feels a certain peace wash over him that only Dean has ever been able to bring him. By Dean’s side is the one place in all of creation he feels like he belongs, the place he has chosen to be his home.
Not even bothering to point out how Castiel is very visibly shivering, Dean nudges his arms up so he can get the t-shirt and hoodie on him easier. Soon enough, Castiel is dressed and tucked into bed again, and Dean brings him chicken noodle soup. Castiel has no idea when he’s had the time to cook it.
Cas must read something in Dean’s silence because he continues, his voice gentle like he thinks one wrong word will shatter Dean like glass. “Is it the seizures?”
Heart rate rising with his anxiety, Dean mutely shook his head. Unable to keep himself up anymore, he let himself sink back against the pillows. “What…happened?”
“You're looking better, did you finally sleep?” Sam asks when the food is ready and Dean has sat down to join them.
still hurt, and it's bound to get worse, and anyway, is it too much to ask for a damn kiss on the mouth? “Really really b-b-b-bad.”
"I'm okay to keep driving. It's only a few more hours, and you need the rest." He does feel kind of drained from the case, but he’d rather get back to the bunker and recuperate there.
Dean had given him a look then, and Sam, realizing what he’d just said, had rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean. Magic means equivalent exchange—there’s always a price. There’s side-effects. This is your
Dean pretends to be grumpy, but only minutes later he’s joking around with Eileen and patiently guiding Jack through the prep work for the meatballs.
When they're done, Dean does the cleanup while the kid finishes his math assignment. By the time Dean's drying his hands on a dish towel, all the problems are solved and Dean gives them a quick once-over.
Changing into one of the t-shirts and sleep pants Dean insisted are needed for cuddling purposes, Castiel slides in under the blanket next to him. Dean sighs and reaches for his hand. The trembling has lessened but Castiel can still feel it.
With the attention finally not on him anymore, Dean tries the stupid rabbit food. At least if he eats that first he can have the tasty stuff after, right? The carrots and the sweet corn are okay because maybe Dean lied a little about not liking those. It’s been a while since he's tried broccoli though and it's an instant no—the taste, the way it feels on his tongue, it's all blegh. He can cook that stuff but not eat it, nope. Just no.
Despite Dean’s words, Cas is looking at Dean with compassion, like he’s still seeing something completely different than what Dean is. Like he’s not getting at all that Dean isn’t the bright and loving being that he believed him to be.
"It's one of mine. I thought you liked them?" Cas pauses where he was sorting their dirty clothes from their suitcase to put them in the hamper for Dean to wash later.
When Castiel turns to him, Dean seems tense and withdrawn where he was so openly emotional before. It’s not unusual for Dean to retreat into his protective shell, though Castiel suspects it has less to do with his outburst, and more with what they’re about to do—while Dean swims in the bunker’s pool a lot, the ocean is a much less controlled environment.
Castiel tries to protest—his grace isn't so weak that he requires sustenance, so food will be wasted on him. Dean matches him in stubbornness though, and though he doesn't say anything, it's clear that he will spoon-feed him if he keeps resisting.
Cas finally sets his phone down. “Of course,” he says, sounding far too serious, but the affirmation still soothes Dean’s stupid separation anxiety.
Shaking his head, Dean wipes at his cheeks and then makes himself meet Cas’s eyes. “No, I… I always want—And it’s so good, I swear, but then after, I feel…” Dean trails off, licking his lips and tasting salt.
Dean has gone completely still. He's staring at the rings, his eyes wide and vulnerable, the tremble in his hand even worse than before.
“It's alright, I'm just—” He sighs, and then abruptly shoves his plate over to Dean and gets out of the booth. “You can have it, I—I will wait outside.” Then he turns around and walks out.
The kid looks like he's out for the count, head leaned against the window at an uncomfortable looking angle. Dean's starting to feel too warm anyway, so he shrugs out of his jacket, holds it out to Cas. “Stuff that und-d-der his head, ‘m g-g-getting a crick in my n-neck just from w-w-watching.”
it, needs to get it off. He scratches at his skin and then hands seize his, stopping him, squeezing with enough force that it doesn’t hurt but he can’t easily get out of the grip either.
he had asked of Dean all those months ago when Dean had finally confessed his need for more physical affection. It doesn’t feel right to be cross with Dean for hiding this though, not when he thinks about how overwhelmed with guilt and, yes, trauma Dean must be at the prospect of Jack’s birthday. And then to have to see Castiel like this today, unconscious and so similar to how it must have looked when he was dead...
“I’ll make some. You can help me out too. Learn some things in the kitchen.” He liked the thought of that. Really, he liked any time that he spent with Dean, but it was the domestic moments he loved the most. He imagined them in the kitchen baking, cooking, and laughing at the mess they’d inevitably make. He followed Dean into the kitchen and gathered what he was told they needed. As they began to make the patties, Jack walked in and sat down at the table to watch them. They didn’t notice as Cas was caught up in watching Dean, and Dean was trying to make sure the burgers didn’t burn. As they got close to being done, Cas turned to grab their buns prepared with lettuce, bacon, and cheese and saw Jack quietly observing them.
They discovered it and got it running a couple months ago. Dean can only swim in the outer lane and when someone’s there to watch him, but he’s taken all of that in stride. He’d never known what a great stress relief swimming could be.
. Everybody’s scared they or their friends are next. I’ve been trying to set up some kind of network, but it’s hard to keep track of people out there. Far as I know, we got 79 people missing in the last three and a half months, but I’m sure it’s more.”
Sam is standing on the opposite side of the fire in front of which Castiel and Dean have made themselves comfortable sitting on the logs that are set up in a circle around it. The fireplace is a recent addition to their home that they’ve all built together not far from the bunker’s entrance where it’s sheltered by a handful of trees.
Dean complained about it but also made no move to get another plate and put a stop to it all. When Castiel stole his fork and fed Dean the next few bites, Dean rolled his eyes, but judging from the blush on his cheeks and the bashful way he avoided everyone’s eyes, he enjoyed it a lot.
While the fence is not particularly high Dean is really not looking forward to climbing it, but to his luck, it turns out there was the as of yet unknown option of Cas taking hold of two of the bars and just
Still, “I don’t know if I c-c-can, y’know. Just turn th-that off. And I really d-do n-n-need to t-talk to S-S-Sam l-l-later. Didn’t g-get a chance with this,” he taps against his temple, “a-a-acting u-up.”
Dean, who has such an affinity for sweets and who probably would have eaten one of his suggestively shaped cookies just to annoy his brother, hasn't munched on any of them.
He’s busy struggling to get his blanket and pillow nest out of the way so he can get up without getting tangled and kissing the floor, but he can
He made to lie back down, already dreading what that meant. But Sam held him back, sputtering, “Are you out of your mind?! Dean, you only barely made it through this round! If we hadn’t stopped—”
Dean’s eyes are burning and not with fatigue. Rolling onto his other side so his back is to Cas, he holds his breath and bites his lip until the tide of sadness and shame settles. He curls his fingers into the cold sheets and clings so tightly his joints ache.
There’s a smile in her voice, and she sounds like she knows something he doesn’t. When he asks, she just laughs lightly.
Sam throws his bag to the side and stands up, only to hover like an angry giraffe. “No, and I told you we're just friends! Stop talking like we're a couple!”
He starts moving his hips, just small, rolling motions, and is pleased to feel Cas's dick starting to harden against him, his hold on Dean’s hips tightening.
“No. But I think you’re forgetting one thing.” Mary’s voice is very soft. “You’re not alone. You’ve got all of us here, willing to help.”
Feeling himself smile bashfully, even though it’s far from the first time that Cas has asked this, Dean sets his beer down in the sand. His heart feels light. He reaches for Cas first, taking his hand. Leaning towards each other, their mouths meet, gentle and careful. Dean presses closer and Cas presses back. A shiver races down Dean’s back but he doesn’t panic. He squeezes Cas’s hand. Cas squeezes back and intertwines their fingers.
It's not a lot and mostly watery. When it's over, Castiel helps him take a sip from the glass so he can rinse out his mouth.
Sam and the stupid old books could suck it, it was Dean's turn to monopolize Cas's time now! Fair was fair!
“You’re unhappy,” he finally says, staring at a point a little above Dean’s shoulder. “I know you’ve been trying to hide it from me, but you are.” Dean wants to interrupt him but Cas is already talking again. “At first, I wanted to confront you about it, because we said no more secrets. But then I thought about it from your perspective, with our history in mind. And, Dean, I want you to know that even if it turns out that whatever is making you unhappy is something we disagree over, even if it’s something you need or want that I can’t give you—I’m not going to just leave.” He’s finally meeting Dean’s eyes, and Dean can’t do anything but stare back, breath caught in his throat.
He was so deeply in thought, he hadn’t realized Dean was looking at him. Dean sounds vulnerable all of a sudden, and Castiel is quick to focus on him.
Cas's arms come up around Dean’s shoulders, holding him close, and Dean leans back to search his eyes.
Cas puts a hand on the back of Dean’s neck and draws him forward into a kiss that’s a lot more passionate than their gentle making-out from before and that Dean has a hard time breaking away from.
There’s a small store that sells cooled, freshly pressed juice, and Jack looks like he could use a pick-me-up. Besides, hydration is important, right? He gets two, and also a navy blue ballcap with some kind of writing in white at the front that Dean assumes reads Ocean Beach, since that’s where they are. Jack doesn’t seem to care for sunglasses much and if Dean has to keep watching him squint against the light he’s going to get a headache.
Cas has turned around, but he’s hovering in the doorway. Seeing his own uncertainty reflected back at him like that makes Dean close to angry. He waves Cas in and Cas shuts the door and sits down on Dean’s desk chair.
Dean watches a koala munch on leaves while her baby is clinging to her back, all cozy and safe nestled in their mom’s fur.
So Cas went and got the next two items. And then he figured that Dean could just call him when he came out and couldn't find Castiel on his own.
He retreats back into the hallway. In the kitchen, he carefully washes and dries the plate and puts it away.
Sam, who was walking on eggshells around Dean, probably waiting for him to have a break-down or an angry explosion. Sam, who came home one day and presented Dean with what looked like one of those stupid smartwatches. “It’s called
Dinner is overrated and bodies are stupid. Dean grumbles to himself about the injustice of it all while he puts on the socks and sweatpants and the tee Cas brought him. The sweatpants are fine—his hotdog ones—but the hoodie isn't.
Dean grumbles but has to direct too much attention on his footing again to be able to complain about Cas's lack of appreciation.
His legs covered with the blanket, still in his soft hoodie and all pressed up against Castiel’s side, Dean is so warm.
It’s early afternoon when Castiel and Jack return to the bunker after their hunting trip. It was a simple case, a haunting, and Castiel had stepped back and let Jack make most of the decisions. The hunt was a success, and seeing Jack gain confidence and learn to trust his own instincts makes Castiel feel incredibly proud.
, Cas's hands are holding him in place, and the way he keeps saying Dean’s name makes him try and press even closer.
With his face tucked into Castiel’s neck the way it is, Castiel can feel the way Dean’s face flushes. Dean grumbles something about him being a sap, but he also squeezes Castiel’s hand and holds it tighter like he doesn’t intend on letting go ever again, and that is all the answer Castiel needs.
“I don’t know, it’s—Dean, and it’s Jack, and—” He cuts himself off, torn between wanting to talk about it and the urge to pretend that he doesn't have to.
The first time Dean managed to claw his way through the black water and reach the surface, they were standing in front of a big mirror. Meticulously, Michael was stripping their body naked. Fabric slid over their skin and fell to the floor as more and more skin was revealed. When it was all gone, Michael inspected their body in the mirror. When Michael noticed Dean was there, their mouth smiled at Dean’s horror.
to her. She offers him a gentle smile and rubs his back. The touch is good and warm and Dean’s overcome by the wish that she would hug him.
Dean, who was clearly dozing but jerks out of sleep as soon as he feels the mattress dip. “‘M awake!” he claims and quickly moves his hand to wipe away some drool from his cheek.
He hadn’t expected it to be this nice. The water is cool and clear and smells of salt instead of chlorine. He can see the sky overhead and is able to actually touch the seafoam and hear the soft sounds of the water from up close.
Blinking in disorientation, Dean sees that Cas isn't on the bed anymore but is rummaging through the dresser. The blanket has been pulled up to cover Dean's back, but he preferred Cas's hands keeping him warm.
“You know,” Cas says, his tone warm and intimate like they’ve been having a conversation the entire time they walked silently at each other’s side. “I started calling you Bear because of how grumbly and grumpy you are when woken or hungry. But there’s another reason.”
Castiel strokes his hand down Dean’s side. Dean’s lying very still and seems to be listening intensely.
He's about to get up and start the super fun task of packing his bag when Cas cups his cheek and presses their mouths together. This time when Dean's eyes close it's because of pleasure and relief, and he puts his hand over Cas's hand on his cheek. The angle isn't perfect so Dean tips his head a little more to the side, and then
Dean wants to object and say that at least Claire did not adopt anything from him, she and Dean just happen to share a love for ketchup and for eating pizza with their hands, but his mouth is too full.
The hands go away. Dean wants to open his eyes, wants to speak, but only manages a weak groan. Everything hurts. He's so tired.
That eerie coldness is gone, and the warmth is back in his expression. There’s a hesitancy though, and that’s new.
Eileen and Jack snicker. Dean glares at them and then at Cas, though he can’t really be mad that Cas made them laugh, even if it’s at his expense.
"That’s good, but… not what I meant." At Castiel's confused look, she adds, "You've been kind of quiet. Worried. So, we started worrying about you."
So far, their flashlights have hit nothing but stone and debris. It makes sense that the thing wouldn’t nest right at the entry, but the farther they need to go into the mine, the more at a disadvantage they are. Not to mention the possibility of the damn thing just crashing down around them. Dean’s anything but a fan of enclosed spaces, even with an exit nearby.
Dean had wanted to yell that no fucking deep breathing exercise would fix his broken mouth, that some things just plain do not get better, they get worse. But Sam didn’t deserve to take the brunt of Dean’s frustration, so he swallowed all of that back.
“I m-m-mean it’s j-j-just w-w-weird, w-when you th-think y-your p-p-parents a-a-are a c-c-certain w-w-way a-a-and then they’re not. A-a-and it’s w-w-weird w-w-watching your m-mom m-make out with someone. ‘Cept I’m not Sam’s m-mom n-now. I just w-w-was.”
"My phone's a-a-at home.” The plastic of the icing package crinkles where Dean is clutching it too tightly in his ire. “It's
Shifting his stance, Dean clears his throat.  “How ‘bout me a-a-and Jack st-t-tay here?” It’s like he’s read Castiel’s thoughts, though he is no longer looking at him, firmly focusing on Sam. “You guys got th-this. I’m not good w-w-with witch stuff, but you’re l-l-like Row-w-wena’s apprent-t-tice at this point. And c’mon, you’re go-go-gonna have Maggie ha-a-andle the netw-w-work
Cas is looking something between touched and embarrassed at same time, so Dean grins ruefully and adds, “Remem-m-m-ber our first k-kiss? I was so nerv-v-vous I alm-m-most missed your mouth.”
Gentle moonlight is illuminating their room, the thin curtains are moving in the breeze, and the sea is close enough that the waves can be heard loud and clear. It’s so soothing that Castiel spends most of the night just listening to the ocean and watching the stars move across the sky.
Letting his thoughts wander, Castiel muses that if there are any truly holy things in the world, feeling the love of your life fall asleep in your arms must be one of them.
After a night of very little sleeping and a lot of worrying, Dean drags himself to the kitchen only to find everyone already there.
Several months ago when Dean and Cas had their talk, Cas had stayed in Dean’s bed for the first time, holding him the entire night. Dean fell asleep in Cas’s arms, warmed and soothed, and woke up that way too. In the morning, Cas had confessed that he’d been thinking about what Dean had told him the entire night, and that he had an idea about how they could help Dean feel less out of control.
Maybe it's something Dean said? But all they did was talk about Jack, because he's still struggling now that he's as good as human.
It’s night by now, but not as dark as it could be with the sky free of clouds and the moon almost full. The lack of bright light at least helps a little with Dean’s pounding head.
Or... Cas is simply not a stay-in-bed-and-cuddle, sleepy-morning-kisses kinda guy. The dude doesn't sleep; Dean should be content that Cas wastes a couple hours every night letting Dean fall asleep next to him and staying until he's really out for the count. Sometimes he even lets Dean falls asleep on his chest, and if Dean wakes up alone later, well, it's still more than he's ever had before. He shouldn't complain.
It's only now that Castiel notices the flour over Dean, Jack and Maggie's clothes, some of which is handprint shaped. There's a lot of it on Dean's clothes especially.
Cas frowns at the cookies. "You seem to be having the issue well in hand," he says, which makes Dean snort and then chuckle. Dean starts to say something else but Mary and the others have just entered the kitchen.
Bent over his tray of chocolate and peanut butter cookies that are about ready to go into the oven, Dean checks one last time that they’re all arranged in a way that they won’t stick together as they bake. “Fuck off, Sammy, ‘m busy.”
“You could j-j-join ‘em,” Dean offers, not for the first time, voice barely louder than the crackling of the fire in front of them. “‘S more fun th-th-than just w-w-watchin’.”
With his tail between his legs, Dean shuffles back to his room, grabs a change of clothes, and locks himself in the shower.
When they’ve trudged down the stairs in the bunker and entered the war room, Eileen briefly draws Dean into a hug. It’s warm and gentle and Dean’s still aching all over and can’t find it in him to refuse the comfort.
“I won’t tell if you won’t. C’mon.” Dean puts some cookies on the plate and then fixes a glass of milk. “There you go.”
Sam chuckles. Eileen, coming over from where she had been talking with Stevie, leans into his side and he puts an arm around her.
When he's scraped together the courage to meet Cas's eyes, Cas is looking at him all warm and maybe a little bit sad, and okay, Dean really wants close now. Wants to hug.
To keep Cas from saying anything else that’s only going to make Dean flustered, he picks up another cookie and waves it in Cas’s face in a deliberately annoying manner. “Have another one. C’mon, you know you wanna.”
With Jack away from the bunker for the next couple of hours, they get to work outside. After the grill and the garden chairs and tables have been carried outside, Castiel leaves it to Sam and Eileen to hang up colorful lampions in the trees.
His hair's a mess but he leaves it because by the time he's done with everything else his eyes are watering too bad to fuss with it anyway. It's a relief to shut off the light and go back to the room where the curtains are still keeping out the brunt of the sunlight. He's just finished putting on pants and a fresh tee when there's a knock on the door and a muffled, “Dean?”
Dean goes to hit the head and by the time he walks outside with his little take-out box of stew, everyone's already piled back into the Impala. Sam is sitting shotgun again, and Dean would think it's for Jack's benefit so he can be in the back with Cas, except Jack seems to have fallen asleep. Dean would really like to have Cas be in the front with him, so Cas could nag him about staying hydrated and they could argue some more about whether Cowboys vs Aliens is a
Sam pats his back, broad palm rubbing gently. "Think I know what that's like," he says. "I'm really happy for you."
“We’re not w-w-wearing r-r-rings or anything. No one’d bel-l-lieve it, I guess,” Dean says at length, torn between his head wanting him to stay realistic about this and the needs of his stupid, stupid heart.
Dean moves his face away from where he had it tucked into Cas’s neck again and rests his head on Cas's chest.
Belatedly, Dean realizes that everyone’s already done with dinner while he still has half a bowl of soup and almost all of his bread left. At some point, he stopped eating his food and just stared at it while he played with his spoon. The soup tasted good but it’s probably cold by now and he doesn’t feel like eating anyway. Sam is collecting their dishes so Dean shoves his bowl towards him.
The one-on-one time with Cas lifts Dean’s mood, but while he’s cooking dinner, he slowly slips into melancholy.
Turning around and starting to rummage through a cupboard that he doesn't need anything out of, Dean somehow manages to keep his voice cheery—"What're we watching again?"—even as he's blinking away tears.
Sam snorts. “I’ll leave you to it then. Behave.” Dean rolls his eyes and Sam chuckles. Standing at the foot of the bed, he squeezes Dean’s ankle in parting and then leaves.
They’ve just returned from a hunt—or, technically, two hunts, both of them nasty cases of ghost possession. They had needed to split since the cases were happening almost simultaneously, Castiel and Eileen and Jack taking on one case while Sam and Dean tackled the other. They weren't particularly hard to solve but left a string of victims, and that took its toll on all of them.
Dean nods but regards her with worry. He doesn’t have time to think of a way to ask her if she’s really okay because then Sam and Jack are back.
The door to their room is slightly ajar. Only the lamp on the left nightstand is on and Dean is lying curled up and with his back to it on the other side. He has a hand covering his eyes and Castiel walks around the bed to sit beside him.
He won't wake for at least three hours, and Castiel decides to use the time to get some rest himself. There's the blanket he's been knitting and the podcast he has yet to finish, but for now, what he really wants is just to lie next to Dean and listen to both of them breathe.
The noise it makes in response sounds eerily like high-pitched human laughter, echoing off of the boulders and the side of the mountain where the shadows are getting longer and deeper by the minute. And then someone—Cas?—
There hadn’t been a lot of refugee hunters who were able to come at such short notice. Dean had stepped up to take care of the ones that did come, taking some of the weight off Sam’s shoulders. He’d been in the kitchen with two of them—Kit and Valerie, he learned later—getting some beer out of the fridge for them, when it happened for the first time.
Castiel can feel Sam watching them closely. Dean doesn’t seem to notice, completely focused on every single step. Once he’s sitting, Castiel pushes the wheelchair as closely to the waterline as possible, then helps Dean stand again.
Molly snorts. “They’re chalking it up to overdoses or gang violence. Now, I’m not saying that stuff ain’t happening out there. I’ve seen folks beat to death, set on fire, left to rot. I know the work of human monsters when I see it, and I’m telling you, this ain’t that.” Her shaking fingers almost rip the salt packet. She lets it fall, takes a deep breath.
He’s selected a pin of a platypus for Jack and one of a capybara for himself, when he spots Dean two aisles over. He’d said he wanted to wait outside, but now he’s staring intently at a shelf with various plushies, an unreadable expression on his face.
"Hey, C-C-Cas? Don't mope in h-h-here w-w-with me the ent-t-tire time, 'kay? Go ha-ha-have some fun."
Halfway through his passionate ranting, he’d become aware of the way Cas was looking at him—like Dean was doing or saying something amazing, instead of boring Cas with more cowboy trivia. Confused, Dean had paused, and then Cas had taken his hand.
There’s an agony-filled howl that abruptly cuts off, and warm blood flooding over Dean’s hands where both of them are holding onto the hilt of his knife. He stumbles to his feet. There’s ringing in his ears and a tightness in his chest and it’s hard to remember where he is.
“He did,” Cas agrees. His voice has a soft lilt like he’s trying to soothe Dean. “But Dean, I’m sure he will ‘bounce back’.” Cas does the air quotes thing. It looks just as dorky as usual, and a strong wave of fondness warms Dean from within. “When he’s ready to talk, he’ll come to you.”
Eileen hugs Cas too before she starts to speak and sign. It makes Dean feel bad because everyone is so much better at signing than he is by now, even though Eileen has told him that she would never even think of being mad at him for not having the time or energy to study during his recovery. While she’s exceptionally good at lip-reading, it’s gotten a lot more difficult for her to understand Dean, so he’s mostly been relying on Cas signing what he says to make it easier for her.
It's not like Dean is asking Cas to—like, morning breath and all, and maybe it's important what he's doing on his phone, or maybe he just ain't in the mood.
Dean couldn’t care less about the stupid sun but he wants to know what picture of him Cas is using. He tries to grab Cas's phone.
At Wal-Mart, Cas pushes the cart while Dean fills it up—he’s thinking homemade lasagna for tonight. One half with meat and one half with—blegh—vegetables for the part of his family that has no taste.
Dean snorts, shaking his head and chuckling at the almost scandalized expression on Cas's face. Looks like the kid ain’t as oblivious as they’d thought.
“I’m good,” Dean says quickly, waving his hand dismissively for emphasis. Frantically casting his eyes around, they land on the TV. “C’mon, let’s watch something. We still need to catch you up on Wynonna Earp.”
Dean nods, and then he’s gently lifted up by the armpits and helped to lean against the stove with his back.
"Hey, um." Oh fuck, is he really doing this? "Whaddaya say, once I've put the pot roast in the oven, wanna go kick back a little and watch something? Your pick."
“I did not hear you complain about the curry chicken,” Sam chimes in triumphantly, signing while he speaks.
Rolling his eyes, Castiel counters, “I know you were excited about swimming and I want you to have that.”
He’s behind Baby’s wheel and they’ve torn out of the bunker by the time Dean remembers that it’s really risky for him to be taking drives by himself now. Especially when it’s dark and rainy and stormy outside. He needs to soothe the
Cas seemed hesitant at first, looking up from the dusty (germy!) old parchment he'd been studying with a frown, but he did get up and follow Dean to the garage. There, Dean showed him the two La-Z-Boy recliners and the foosball table where they were still sitting securely in the trailer he'd used to get them to the bunker.
Dean leans into the contact gratefully, then points over at where the kid is still so engrossed in the very game he had been so sure he’d be bad at, he hasn’t even noticed the others arrive. It looks like Jack just landed a point for his team. The others high five him and he laughs, a bright smile on his face.
Already halfway to the door, Cas hesitates. It makes him feel needy and stupid, but Dean can’t help the hopeful, pleading look he’s sure is on his face. Watching something together means they’ll close the door and sit side by side on the bed or in the armchairs in the Dean Cave. It means Dean gets Cas all to himself for a while—Cas’s attention, his body heat, his thoughts and opinions. His fond smiles whenever Dean says something ridiculous.
His sight gets blurry under the water and the salt stings, so once he’s gotten what he came for he quickly surfaces again.
“Sh-sh-shut up,” Dean says, though he sounds fond. “How a-a-are th-things on your end? Sam sound-d-ded stressed. You guys need me to hij-j-jack some wheels and drive up th-th-there?”
Heart skipping a painful beat, Dean goes tense all over before his brain has even fully caught up with events. He’s about to gently dislodge Jack when he realizes that Jack’s hands are bunched into Dean’s flannel at his back, that the kid is hiding his face in Dean’s chest.
“Please eat something healthy before you have cake,” Castiel tells him, accepting a plate from Dean that’s piled with scrambled eggs and toast, and setting it in front of Jack. He’s sat down beside him, Sam and Eileen opposite them. Dean has swivelled one of the seats around so he can sit at the end of the table between the four of them. He’s too far away for Castiel to put a hand on his knee to keep in contact, but then the problem is solved by Dean’s foot bumping into his.
Mary and Eileen pat his back consolingly, though Castiel can see both of them trying to hide their amused smiles.
“I’ve been worried. About you. But I don’t want to sound ungrateful, so I don’t quite know how to say this... “ Cas looks torn, so Dean takes his hand. Gives it a reassuring squeeze. Cas takes a breath.
“Woah, C-Cas, hey. W-w-what’s all th-that t-t-talk about d-d-dyin’? Y-you th-think ab-b-bout that a l-l-lot?”
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on something more substantial," Cas says, still visibly amused. "And vegetables."
Dean waves him off. It irks him that he has to sit here while everyone else does all the work, but he’s going to need every last bit of strength to make it back to the car.  It gets progressively darker while he waits, and chillier. The others have turned their flashlights on when they get back about fifteen minutes later, and Dean shakily rises to his feet.
They share a moment of silence, just soaking in each other’s presence. Cas's hand is in Dean’s hair again, petting it and making it really hard for Dean to stay awake.
Dean feels smug for all of three seconds when Eileen steals some of Sam’s ice cream as “punishment”. But then she and Sam sign back and forth too fast for Dean to follow and somehow end up kissing and being all lovey-dovey.
“Let me.” Cas heaves Dean's bag on the bed and then moves to get Dean’s toiletry kit from the bathroom. It's kind of nice being fussed over, but Dean needs a distraction from how it felt to have Cas's broad, strong hand on his chest, manhandling him. Dean watches with narrowed eyes as Cas folds up his sleeping clothes.
He listened dispassionately as the doctor explained to him about abnormal brain activity, about different types of seizures, about how for half the people with epilepsy, there was no identifiable cause. He was given a whole stack of glossy pamphlets that like half a rainforest had to die for, and a prescription for drugs that would cost them an arm and a leg if they didn’t have rigged credit cards.
The car was silent, except for the quiet panting of Miracle, as Dean drove back to the bunker. There was only one thing left to do with Chuck now human and everyone returned. It couldn’t be that hard to rescue Cas from the Empty with a newly superpowered Jack on their side and Dean’s quiet but obvious determination to see him again.
“I’m not your son.” Jack smiled as he watched the grace drain out of Lucifer and into a small jar he pulled out of his pocket. Michael was silently displeased as he watched his grace get bottled up and shoved carelessly into Jack’s pocket. “Lead the way.” Michael and Lucifer walked in front of Jack on their way to the portal leading back to the bunker. Far ahead of them, he could see Dean practically carrying Cas through the portal. The Nephilim and former archangels arrived at the portal and stepped into the light. Jack took in a deep breath. It was good to be home.
Silence. Quiet. Just how they liked it. Oh, how they loved being able to sleep along with all the demons and angels. And that’s how it was for millennia. Until that stupid blue-eyed seraph woke up and started screaming and yelling and being a nuisance. That pesky little angel managed to worm his way out and not wake anyone else up, so as irritated as the Empty was at least it was quiet enough to go back to sleep.
Then the nerdy Nephilim wanted to go to Heaven instead of where he belonged. And there was that angel again. Not leaving empty-handed, the entity made a deal. The Nephilim for the angel. But they wanted the angel to suffer, so they wouldn’t wait for the angel to die again. They would come and take him when he finally allowed himself to be truly happy. With that, the Empty went back to a peaceful place. Until the Nephilim came back after his grandfather killed him. Then Billie took him to do her bidding and said they would work together with the Empty.
“You gotta level with me man. Look me in the eye and tell me you’re not working with Crowley.” Dean’s eyes begged him to say it, to prove he had put his trust in the right angel. Cas couldn’t bear to look him in the eyes. “Son of a bitch.” He raised his gaze. He was on the floor and Dean was above him covered in blood, holding the angel blade. He grabbed onto Dean’s wrist that held his tie. “Dean, please.” Dean slashed down. Cas’s life flashed before his eyes. Watching humanity, pulling Dean out of Hell, rebelling against his family, betraying Dean, arguing with Dean, loving Dean.
“How did I mean what?” He was really going to make Dean say it out loud. He’d barely had the time to process what he was told and much less to think about his response.
and the other was the Winchester they had yet to meet. The Empty looked down at Cas, “Looks like your boyfriend is here to save you. Too bad you can’t go anywhere.” He looked up confused and followed the source of light. His sad expression became almost hopeful, until the Empty’s words sunk in. From their throne, the Empty smirked, “We made a deal angel.” He cast a forlorn glance towards the hunter and let his misery show as he looked back down.
“It’s different this time. Jack and Amara are in control of everything now. Chuck’s mortal, everyone’s back, and now you’re going to come back too. Please, Cas.” Now Dean was actually pleading.
“Cool! Does that make Sam my uncle now?” Cas supposed that made sense. He was Jack’s father, he and Dean were together, and Sam was Dean’s brother.
From what Jack could remember about the Empty, he knew that it would be mad that he “made it loud”. Guessing from that comment, there were suspicions that there might be others who were awake. Getting into the Empty would be no problem. Jack would open the portal to the Empty, and Sam would use a spell to keep it open while Dean and Jack went in. The conflict was with the entity itself and how to deal with it.
They were the first to arrive back in the bunker. Cas was groggy and tired and felt like he needed to get off of his feet and sleep for a week. “Dean, I need to rest.” He managed to say.
“Yeah, yeah. Got it.” Dean responded shortly. How would he explain himself to Cas would he understand?
“Yeah, I just meant lovers usually when they already share a living space, they also, you know share other things.”
They pulled up to the bunker, and as soon as the door was opened, they got to work. Dean rarely found himself this focused on a case, but this was Cas. Cas was more important than anything else right now. Dean still had something to say, and he wasn’t going to let Cas get away without him saying it this time.
“I’m sorry Dean. I don’t mean to offend. It’s just that you’re just managing to surprise me a lot today. So, you’re asking me if I’d like to share a bed with you now that I’m human and require sleep?” Dean nodded. “Yes, I would like that.” He glanced at their position. “It seems like we’re already sharing it.” He gave Dean a cheeky grin.
“I mean, do you want to stay in here with me? I think the bed is big enough for both of- what?” He stopped, feeling insecure. Cas was grinning from ear to ear and doing his best not to laugh.
Jack decided that Amara didn’t need to be tucked away within him when she had spent most of her existence being locked away. He let her out and let her be free to continue her exploration of the world that her, now mortal, brother created, but only after they discussed the reformation of Heaven.
“For you and Raphael, that is if Raphael does not wish to join Michael and Lucifer in what I’m sure sounds like a fun little adventure on Earth,” Amara turned to Raphael. He simply shook his head, eyes wide and still taking in all of the information he’d just been given, “you will be helping me rule Heaven and the other returned angels. There is work that must be done, and if you don’t think you can handle it, you know the other option.”
“That’s the spawn of Satan? Looks like a copycat Castiel.” Jack smiled at Crowley’s comment, proud to resemble his chosen father while Lucifer looked offended.
“Shut up! Ugh, why can’t you all just be quiet! Why do you have to make it so loud?” the Empty let their frustration out for all in the void to hear. For just a moment there was complete silence. Then came the onslaught of questions. “Who are you?” “Meg?” “Where are we?” “What’s going on?” were most of them.
“Not quite yet. We have to discuss some things before we send you away.” Amara interjected. “See, Jack and I have come to an agreement on where you belong. Lucifer and Michael, until you can figure your crap out, you’ll be human, like Chuck. So you might want to figure it out quick or you’ll find yourselves living mortal lives and dying mortal deaths.”
Someone starts walking him forward, strong grip around his back catching him every time he stumbles. All sense of time is lost on him, and there’s a hitching, wheezing sound in his ears like someone having trouble breathing. Finally, the darkness around the beam of light that’s somewhere to his left transforms into something softer, more blue than charcoal black. The vision of the torturous experiments he’d witnessed faded away at some point, but he still feels outside of himself, confused and exhausted.
They’ve picked the perfect day—the sky is clear and blue, the waves calm. Despite the warmth from the sun, Dean still thinks it’s too early in the year to go swimming. The water is gonna be cold as fuck. That’s not stopping Sam, Eileen and the kid though, who are all already stripping off their clothes and can’t seem to wait to get into the ocean.
"C’mon, you go-go-gotta t-t-try this." Dean breaks off another piece and holds it out to him expectantly.
Unable to do anything but nod, Dean leans back to give Cas room, and then his mouth falls open when Cas's thick fingers close around his leaking dick. Dean realizes quickly that not only is Cas a fast learner, he’s fucking ruthless in applying his newfound knowledge. Cas presses kisses along his throat and then nudges Dean’s chin up and sucks at the pad of fat under it that Dean’s actually kind of embarrassed about, it’s just hard to remember about that when the attention paid to those sensitive areas is making his heart pound. Cas's thumb is sliding over his slit on every upstroke, making his toes curl and his balls draw up.
The last item on it is rock salt, and Castiel heaves two bags into the cart and then makes his way towards the registers. With everyone joining together as a mass with their carts, unable to form distinct lines, he has to push through both carriages and people. Why no one has set fire to the entire place yet, he does not understand.
Dean opens his mouth, then closes it again. Cas is not wrong; this could save them a lot of time and work tomorrow, maybe even save somebody’s life. But, “A-a-a-and if that fucker at-t-tacks you with no b-b-b-back-up, what then?”
Dean’s actually awake at a reasonable hour the next morning, and he drags his whole family into the Waffle Spot for breakfast. His body still aches with exhaustion, but the memory of last night is enough to distract him from it. He can’t stop smiling, can barely keep his hands off Cas, pressed close to his side while he munches on his blueberry and banana nut waffles.
Dean drops his gaze and nods. He reaches out and squeezes Cas’s hand where it’s touching his elbow, that little point of contact enough to make him long again. Then Dean lets go, and turns. And he goes to bed alone, and he lies alone on his back and relearns how to breathe around that hollow cave that is his heart.
At long last, and using his superior strategizing skills to his advantage, he manages to navigate past a woman with three shopping carts who has a small goat strapped to her back in a baby carrier, and reaches register six.
Dean wants to say yes, but it’s hard to remember how to do that or even concentrate on it. His reality wavers between his bloodied hands that he’s staring at, and a vision of a strapped down and screaming creature, of a chalice with glowing liquid, of burned out eyes. He starts shaking.
When he goes back, they’re going to kiss, but he wants more. After all that emotional intimacy, he’s longing for some physical closeness, for comfort and for the opportunity to make them both feel good, if Cas is up for it.
Cas shakes his head in exasperation, but his smile is betraying him. Dean gets all of five seconds to feel smug and then Cas's hand is at the back of his head and guiding him into a sweet if short kiss.
Cas starts stroking a hand down Dean’s spine again. “You’ve lost weight, and you’re not letting yourself have the rest you need. You try to be there and take care of everyone, but you’re not letting us take care of you. I know it’s a hard habit to break, but I’d like you to try. Try and be kinder to yourself, Dean. Try and think about what would make you happy, and then let yourself have it.”
Sometimes when they’re on the bed and Dean’s fallen asleep on Cas’s shoulder, Dean even gets a gentle touch or two. Like when Cas eases himself out from under him and tucks the blanket over his legs.
Dean sniffs, unwilling to concede Cas's point but too tired to keep bickering. It’s kind of strange to wear Cas's coat, and also kind of nice. Like getting hugged by him, only not tightly enough.
Dean snorts and then chuckles, shaking his head, his expression radiating fondness. Swaddled in thick clothing, hair mussed, shadows of exhaustion under his eyes that are crinkling in the corners, he is radiant. His throat and chest tight with emotion, Castiel can’t help staring at him.
Cas says it so matter-of-factly, it should make Dean laugh, not have heat rise to his face and his dick twitch in his boxers. He’s already plumping up and they haven’t even really done anything yet.
It had taken him a while, then, to find the courage to go and tell the others. Sam and Cas were in the library, and they stopped talking when Dean entered. Wordlessly, he’d handed Sam his phone. His speech still wasn’t improving, and it got worse when he was distressed, and he suddenly couldn’t bear to hear himself talk, to hear himself admit that he couldn’t do yet another very simple thing anymore.
By the time it's getting dark and the LEDs in the lampions have turned themselves on, the kids have retreated inside, presumably to play video games. Dean grumbles something about them at least taking their 'awful excuse for music' with them, and frowns at the half-empty Margiekugel in front of him, the label all but picked off.
, right fucking now. Dean’s mouth is dry, his skin is tingling with the need to touch and be touched, and he’s definitely starting to plump up in his jeans.
Somehow, his hands have found their way to Cas's forearms. The solid strength there kicks his desire up a notch, and he has to pause their kiss to moan lowly against Cas's mouth.
Eileen and Sam leave to get some rest but Mary stays, claiming that she got enough shut-eye in the car and that if she sleeps anymore now she won't be able to at all tonight.
Dean settles himself in, arms around Cas's thick waist and cheek mashed against his shirt. Still grumbling under his breath, he tries to will himself to pass out to escape the pounding in his head.
"How'd it g-g-go?" Dean asks as Castiel sits down on the bed. "You guys ca-ca-catch th-the evil g-g-ghostie?" He's still smiling, but his hands are fidgeting nervously in his lap. There are extra blankets on their bed, and Dean’s wearing comfort clothes—hoodie, sweatpants, thick socks.
"You d-d-dumbass," Dean says from where he's pressing the side of his face against Castiel's, his voice affectionate and watery. From this close, Castiel can hear the hitch in his breath.
“Hey, Cas. We’re done here alread-d-dy, not much to g-g-go on.” Dean looks around, but no one seems to be in immediate hearing range. “Think we can r-r-rule out ghosts and d-demons though. Anyway, gimme a call when you guys are d-d-done. Um, I, um, m-m-miss you.” Cheeks burning, Dean stares at his phone in horror. He can’t recall planning to say this but now he has and there’s no turning back. “Um, ‘kay, bye.”
Tugging the blankets up higher over his back, Dean huddled into them for warmth, huddled into them and hid himself.
Dean tugs on Castiel’s sleeve and shifts around until Castiel is on the bed with him, sitting back against the headboard. Then he tucks himself into Castiel's side, reaching for his hand again. He seems to want to move it somewhere but is lacking the coordination.
Suddenly, Cas's hand is covering Dean’s where he’d been absently plucking at the comforter. Cas squeezes Dean’s hand, and his voice has adopted that soft, hushed tone he uses when he wants to soothe Dean.
Dean wishes, but he knows how this goes. “Gonna take a sh-sh-shower.” And then he leans forward and draws Sam into a hug. Sam seems surprised for a second but then relaxes into it and, very carefully, puts his arms around Dean as well. Dean would bitch that he ain't fragile, but he doesn't have the energy. He couldn't even say if this hug is more for Sam's benefit or his own. Maybe it doesn't matter.
"There, there," she says, patting his back. Castiel hopes that Sam relayed to her what they were arguing about—she can't read Dean's lips when he is this disfluent.
“I will ensure that that doesn’t happen. You have my word.” Jack was sincere. He was going to fix all the messes Chuck and Billie made. First, he would get his dad back, then bring silence to the Empty by returning those who wandered through it and figure all else out from there. Before he brought everyone back he considered taking a hands-off approach unlike Chuck, but he figured that Chuck’s problem was not in interacting with his creation but controlling it in his favor and using it for entertainment rather than letting it grow on its own. Jack was smarter than Chuck.
“Okay, let me shower and get out of these clothes first.” Dean leaned over and gave Cas a peck on the forehead. He walked out, and Cas felt his eyes closing against his will. He turned over and was out before Dean got back.
He was still disoriented from the nightmare, but managed a very hoarse “Yes, I- I’m sorry, can I have some water?” Sam handed him a glass, and Dean watched Cas with a worried face.
“Why are you worried about what will happen when you're out?” Jack knew he probably shouldn’t have asked that by the look on their face. “I just mean to say that you won’t have to worry about that sort of stuff when you’re asleep. No one to bother you or wake you up.” Jack hoped that he sounded convincing enough.
Jack turned to walk away and hid a smirk on his face. Thankfully being a Winchester meant he wasn’t terrible at negotiations. Three, two, one. “Kid, wait.”
“We can worry about those other things after we get out of here. I want to get you back before we can even think about them.” Understanding what was being conveyed Cas slowly lifted the angel blade to his throat. He hesitated to extract his grace. “It’s okay. I’m here for you when you fall.” Cas held his loving gaze as dragged the blade across his throat. As it started to flow out, Dean watched with fascination. The angelic grace dispersed and fizzled out into the surrounding atmosphere and Dean planted the hex bag Sam had given him in a pocket on the trench coat. Then Cas collapsed. Dean dropped onto the floor with him. He tried to shake him but to no avail. “Cas! Come on, wake up! We gotta get going home now. Sam and Eileen are waiting on us, and we have to go back before the portal closes.” He thought for a second to slap Cas’s face but decided against it. Instead, he held his face gently and leaned in to kiss him. It was probably just a coincidence, but his eyes flew open, and Dean was able to relax. He pulled Cas into a sitting position and grabbed his shoulder, “You good? Lost you for a second there.”
“No!” Dean closed his eyes. “Not h-h-him.” A fist clenched in his blanket, he’d swallowed, forced the words out past the spasms in his throat, past the debilitating fear. “The D-D-Dean y-you knew f-f-from
“Thank you, but the text I’m reading is in Ancient Canaanite. And Sam is already working through the other ones.”
Castiel helps Dean stand and then walk over to the beach wheelchair. Sam and Eileen are over at the other shelter, drying themselves off with the towels they brought.
"It's for like—kicking back, having fun." He gestured vaguely at the way he'd arranged everything. "What, uh. What d'ya think?"
Dean, who hoards more food than he could ever eat, and all the soft bedding he can find. Who starts missing his home, his
Dean tells him to shut up but with his mouth smashed against cotton it comes out completely unintelligible.
Jack only just makes it out of the kitchen and down the hall to his room before Cas enters, looking around.
The moment Sam turns off Baby’s engine, Dean's there, opening the backseat door. Castiel lets Dean help him stand, and they make their way to their room together, Cas leaning on Dean. Dean doesn’t say a word and determinedly avoids Castiel’s eyes.
“Kick Sam’s ass,” Dean says and signs. She laughs and nods, and then runs to where Sam and Jack are already wading into the waves.
Two minutes later, they’re all gathered in the library. Sam and Eileen and Maggie are already dressed and stand alongside Mary, who arrived yesterday to take part in the celebrations they were hoping for. Dean and Jack gather next to each other, still dressed in their pajamas.
Because it’s apparently tease-Dean hour, Sam gets a glint in his eye and coos at them. “Aww, that’s so fitting! Dean, did you know that an adult capy can eat 6 to 8 pounds of grass per day?”
In the kitchen, Dean gets busy preheating the oven and pulling everything he needs out of the cupboards. They've re-organized so that all the important stuff is low-level enough that Dean can easily reach it. He also has one of those neat claw-thingies with which he can theoretically grab stuff from higher up shelves but he's mostly just used it to annoy Sam.
“Mmm, th-that’s n-n-nice,” Dean murmurs, and that’s the last thing he remembers before he passes out.
He makes it through his nightly routine without looking at himself in the mirror once. The moment he shuts off the light and lies down, though, there's pressure on his chest and in his lungs, and his heart starts racing.
About an hour after they turned on the TV, Dean finally returns. Sam, who had been dozing in his chair, startles awake but Dean doesn’t look at either of them. He’s wearing a bathrobe and toweling his hair dry. He must have just showered, but there's still a faint smell of chlorine, so he probably swam laps down in the bunker’s pool. Ever since they discovered it and got it running again, Dean has turned to it for stress relief.
“I had a dog for a while that I’d named Hamster,” Eileen is saying. “He was a stray, and he’d put everything into his mouth and try to eat it. He wasn’t much help at hunts, but I still liked having him around.”
Deciding that he’s being irrational, Castiel forces himself to quit stalling and sits down beside Dean on the bed.
Ducking away, his ears feeling like they’re on fire, Dean grabs a dishtowel to fiddle with. “‘Course. Now scram, before—”
"The kids," Mary explains when she notices his confusion, a soft smile on her face. "That they can have more good days than bad, now. That's a victory right there."
“Do you need help getting undressed?” Cas asks, though he must already know the answer. Dean doesn’t let him help with this anymore unless the seizure was bad enough it leaves him no choice.
. I’m t-t-tryin’ t-to thank you he-here, man.” Cas has carried Dean’s chewed-on ass around, dealt with Dean’s episodes, stayed with him even while Dean was doing his best impression of a lumpy sack of potatoes. It’s been years since Cas was powerful enough that healing people didn’t drain him, but he still gave Dean what he could. Even the teeth marks on Dean’s forearm, while still visible, look weeks old and faded.
Cas doesn’t look like he’s faring much better: pupils dilated, hair a mess from Dean running his fingers through it while he kissed him. Dean leaves the condoms—he’s clean, and Cas doesn’t get STD’s—and puts a towel down on the bed so they don’t ruin the sheets. After tugging off his boxers, he climbs back into Cas's lap, who immediately draws him close, and then they both gasp into each other’s mouths when their dicks touch.
Cas sets Dean’s backpack down. He turns his flashlight off and then reaches over and turns Dean’s off as well, only the glow sticks around their necks remaining to illuminate the space between them. Putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder, Cas steps close, and points upwards. Following the line of his finger, Dean finds one of the very few constellations he knows.
Dean snores on and off and at some point talks in his sleep, but with his face mushed into the sheets, Castiel doesn’t understand any of it. He wakes again after only five hours, but still deems ‘operation lullaby’ a success.
There are hands on his shoulders, steadying him, eyes that are trying to catch his confused, wandering gaze. Another pair of hands patting him down, “—not his blood, Cas,” and the hold on his shoulders tightens.
Sam snorts and Castiel tries to hide his smile, though he’s mostly unsuccessful. Dean had lit up when the baby had smiled at him, and it was deeply endearing to watch them play, to see how happy it made Dean when the baby laughed and squealed in response to his silly faces.
Instead of getting angry back, Cas calmly holds his gaze. “I think that sometimes, we’d rather have the guilt of believing we could have done something differently than have to face that we were powerless. And that’s what you were, Dean. You let him in because you were desperate, but that doesn’t mean you consented to what happened after.”
Dean signals and guides Baby off the highway while the others continue off towards home. He can’t wait to be home too—he’s gotten used to driving with the hand-controls, but what he’s still not used to is being forty and not being able to handle driving for hours anymore.
After bringing their empty bowls back to the kitchen, Dean goes through his nighttime routine and then shuts off the light and climbs into bed.
“Dean, I just watched you seize on the kitchen floor and we still don’t know why!” Sam finally yelled over Dean’s continued protests. His eyes were shining wetly, the movements of his hands erratic as he gestured. “Excuse me if I don’t want to perform a highly dangerous, not to mention intensely painful procedure on you just now! Especially when we don’t know if it’ll fix anything or maybe even make it all worse!”
He assists Castiel in storing away their groceries in the trunk, but even though they’re out of the store now, their irritation remains. They’re still arguing by the time they walk back into the bunker, arms loaded with groceries and the bags of rock salt.
She replied by knocking on the door of the bunker. Sam raced up the stairs as he had seen Dean do days before when he believed Cas was on the other side. As he got to the door, he pushed it open and saw Eileen waiting for him with a smile on her face. He pulled her into a tight hug, determined to not ever let her go again. He released her from his grip just to lean down and kiss her softly. He held her face in his hands and with one hand, gently pushed her hair behind her ear. Smiling, he signed
Castiel is starting to suspect that maybe there is some truth to Sam’s claims that Dean (and Jack, for that matter) has Castiel wrapped around his little finger.
“Right. I’ll just—” Cas doesn’t seem to be faring much better. He gets up awkwardly and goes over to Eileen, who’s watching them with obvious amusement. The only one unfazed is Jack, who’s just beaming at Dean.
Still uncertain how they even got to this topic or why exactly Dean is so insistent about it, Castiel nonetheless is quick to reassure him. “Of course, Dean.” Sensing an opening, he adds, “If you return the favor.”
Castiel uses the opportunity to put a bit of water inside the shell for the flowers. There’s a little table right next to the glass doors that lead to the small balcony, and he puts the shell there. The light breeze coming in through the half-open doors jostles the flowers lightly and spreads their scent around in the room.
“I need it out! Now! All of it!” The thought of even a little bit staying inside him made him want to gag, made his hands itch to claw his skin off and dig it out of him himself.
Trying hard not to get defensive, Dean held out one of the mugs to him. “Yeah, well, you like hot chocolate, right?”
Sam and Eileen get in the car and Sam guides the Impala off the dilapidated parking lot and towards the road. Jack looks around with a frown.
“Should-d-d just use Sam’s.” Dean scowls at the notebook page with the neatly written block letters. “Least it don’t look l-l-like some k-k-kinderga-ga-gartner wrote it.”
move? Oh right, Dean did—and one kiss turns into two, into three. "Dean," Cas tries to protest, so Dean has to kiss him again. "Dean, dinner—"
Dean takes out his phone and stares at the dark screen, thumb hovering over the button that will make it light up. What if this is it? What if he’s made Cas so mad he’s broken up with Dean over text? What is Dean going to do then?
Castiel reaches out to steady Dean, who appears to be literally have become weak-kneed from his continued amusement at his brother's expense. It seems to be contagious too; Mary and Eileen have both given up trying to keep themselves from laughing, and finally, Sam cracks too, grinning and shaking his head, "You jerk."
“D-d-don’t th-th-think so. C-c-could j-j-just b-be th-this though.” He fumbles a hand out from under the blanket and taps a finger against his temple. “St-t-tuff j-just g-g-gets too m-m-much t-to h-h-handle n-now. Kn-kn-knocks me out.” He shrugs. “Not g-g-gonna l-l-lie, it would-d-d b-be k-k-kinda sc-sc-scary if I w-w-were al-l-lone, b-but. ‘M not.”
Smoke was billowing high in the sky, and Dean really wanted to be there for Sammy, but finally another dizzy spell forced him to his knees. He’d probably have fallen headfirst into the mud if Cas hadn’t suddenly been there, hadn’t steadied him and cupped his face.
He must have spaced out for too long because suddenly Cas's hand is on Dean's arm, gently shaking it.
It is; Cas's dick is gliding over his perineum, putting pressure on his prostate from the outside, the head catching on Dean’s hole every couple of strokes. Dean’s dick is getting rubbed against Cas's stomach and Cas's hips have started making little thrusting motions, his feet braced against the mattress. It’s a little uncoordinated and sloppy but that doesn’t even matter. Dean’s warm all over and he’s
They're sitting like they did yesterday, just that Dean's sitting where Cas sat. It feels like there’s more distance though, with all those stupid books in the way.
Cas is looking at him with round, worried eyes. Dean is so startled, he doesn't answer, and the next thing he knows Cas has laid a flat palm on his forehead and is squinting at him.
Judging by how little light is filtering through the blinds, it’s getting dark again the next time Dean wakes up for real. The pounding in his head is less but his body is aching all over and he feels totally gross, covered in dried sweat and with faint traces of blood still caked  under his fingernails. He’s dazed from the pain and from two flashbacks in a row and so deeply exhausted he has no idea how he’s going to get into the shower, much less stand upright under the spray and clean himself.
When they’re ready to go, Cas takes his hand off Dean’s back and turns to him. “I’ll see you later,” he says, something hesitant in his expression Dean can’t read.
Cas comes over and picks up the hoodie, squinting at it. "That's a little dramatic. And the navy one needs to be washed."
Sam and Jack laugh. Cas tucks Dean's arm back against him and says, like Dean is some petulant child, “Sleep, Dean.”
Irritated with himself for letting his thoughts wander in that direction again, Castiel reaches over and grabs his phone. He knows he should talk about this with Dean, but—not yet. They’ve just had a very eventful couple of days, and he wasn't lying about being grateful for and happy with the life he's living right now.
“Please let go off this guilt, Dean. There’s no need for you to keep tormenting yourself like this.”
Castiel gently squeezes his hands. "Bear," he says, and the nickname is what finally gets through to Dean; his frantic, distracted demeanor making way for a soft bashfulness. "Get ready for sleep. I'll be there."
“It is important, that’s true,” Cas agrees. Then he looks down and doesn’t continue until Dean meets his eyes. “But what’s even more important to me is
The bastard is fast, and it figures out quickly that Sam and Cas are its biggest threats, as they are the ones matching it the most closely in height and strength, respectively. Too busy dodging fangs and a maw filled with needle-sharp teeth, none of them have managed to land any lethal hits by the time it goes for what it figures to be the weakest link.
“Do you see the two stars at the outer edge of the dipper’s bowl? Connect them, then extend the line above the bowl, and you find Polaris, the North Star, at about five times the distance between the two stars. No matter where the Great Bear is in the sky, these two stars always point to Polaris, helping the lost find their home.”
It doesn’t look like he’s ready to talk though, and the silence isn’t awkward, so Dean just drives and gives him space.
. And then, we’ve been taking shifts keeping watch every night, and I know other places have started doing that too, but people keep disappearing and nobody’s seen a thing. No way a human could be that stealthy, ‘specially when carrying a body around. Hell, some people keeping
“Dean, listen, this might be temporary. And even if it’s not, we can find a way to work around it. It’s—”
Dean sniffs and nods, but still keeps his eyes closed. It doesn’t seem to help much—when Cas strokes a thumb just under his eye, Dean can feel the wetness there.
“Nothing,” Dean grumbles, at the same time that Cas says, “I told Dean about capybaras because they remind me of him.”
And it should have been fine. But mere seconds later, Dean’s heart had started beating faster and faster and not for fun reasons this time. Suddenly, everything felt weird. Panic clawed at his lungs—he felt funny every time before a seizure, but not like this. Not all slimy inside and out. Not guilty like he’d just done something wrong.
And makes him hurt. Cas turned away because him entering the room and looking at Dean when he’s not fully dressed is an intimacy they can’t have. Probably one that Dean's alone in wanting, anyway.
There’s a smudge of chocolate at the corner of his mouth, from the s’mores they had earlier. Reaching out, Castiel rubs it away with his thumb. Dean playfully tries to chase after it to bite it, pouting when Castiel evades him.
"I don't recall," Castiel says, though he does, in fact, recall Dean saying something along those lines while Castiel was distracted with the impressive shopping list Sam had just handed him. He’s unwilling to admit that right now though, too pissed off still by the crowd in the store and his battle to the registers.
By the time they finally leave the bath, Dean is loose-limbed and has a permanent smile on his face. He makes good-natured fun of the way Castiel’s hair curls behind his ears from the humidity and presses a kiss to the hinge of his jaw.
Wrenching his gaze away from Cas’s hands, Dean drops it into his coffee mug, watching the dark liquid swirl before he takes a sip. Finally succeeding in clearing his throat, he manages a half-shrug with one shoulder.
Dean swallows, needing a moment to digest that. “You were t-t-tryin’ to protect people, Cas. Th-that’s important. I c-c-can’t fault you for th-that.”
Dean is quiet. Castiel wants to look at him and search his eyes, but he can tell that Dean isn’t ready. “Why are you asking me this?”
At some point, he can hear Sam talk with the doctor about which antibiotics are safe for Dean to take so they can prevent a lung infection. He falls asleep with a ventilator helping him breathe and then it’s gone when he wakes up.
Trying not to show his irritation—didn't Cas want to spend time with him?—Dean waved him off. "Sam's still not back from his run. And when he is, he's gonna take a shower, and then raid the fridge, and then take a nap, trust me. Besides, the freaking lore ain't going anywhere." Well, neither was the movie, but—but! "I told you man, you gotta learn to kick back and have fun from time to time."
Dean doesn’t have a comeback to that. Castiel can hear him complain some more under his breath but he finally twists off the cap. By the time they’re back inside their motel room—after giving back the wheelchair they’d rented and retrieving Dean’s—the bottle is half-empty.
Sam must interpret Castiel’s dismayed expression correctly. He sends him a soft smile in the rearview mirror, but it’s sad.
"Just for the record though," Cal continues, either encouraged or made uncomfortable by Dean's silence. "I don't believe in what Kit and Valerie were sprouting. Obviously Mi—, uh,
None of them own swim trunks, so that means shopping trip. “I w-w-want one w-with a sh-sh-shark on it,” Dean says when they’re back in their room and he’s brushed his teeth for the second time today so Cas stops complaining about the lingering walnut taste he does not care for.
needed, but for his health—and Castiel’s peace of mind—it would be better if he stayed at home. But Castiel is not sure how to say that without coming across as selfish or making Dean feel unwanted.
“I’m sure the pillows in our bed will appreciate a good hugging,” Cas says, moving to get out of the car. Dean is very much not okay with the loss of contact that goes along with that.
His smile widening, Jack follows after Dean in a way that reminds Castiel of a little duckling hurrying after its mom. Between their last case, Castiel needing care and then Dean needing care, Jack hasn't had much opportunity for one-on-one time with Dean.
A tear spills over, rolling down his cheek. Dean closes his eyes and swallows hard, overcome by sadness and relief at once. A thumb rubs through the wetness under his eyes and Dean struggles to force his mouth to obey him. “B-but I g-g-get need-d-ding t-to b-be out th-there. So if y-y-you’re not ok-k-kay with—”
Dean’s thumb is running back and forth over Castiel’s ring. It’s an endearing action that he knows Dean turns to for comfort sometimes, with both Castiel’s and his own ring. Now, it’s what’s finally making Castiel’s eyes well up, all the emotions of the last couple of days crashing over him.
He looked back at Cas and smiled. “Hey handsome.” His voice was deep after having just woken up. “How’s it going?” Shivers went down his spine at the tone of his voice.
“No! No, Cas you are more than your powers. We don’t need all the mojo, just you. I just worry that you won’t be okay once you become human again. You’re so proud of being an angel. I don’t want you to lose who you are because you aren’t what you were.”
“Of course. They go back, you go to sleep. You finally get to rest in peace.” Jack knew he was close to cracking them.
“Cas, do you remember what happened in the Empty?” He was surprised Dean brought it up considering the extreme lengths he used to go to in order to repress his feelings, but he supposed things changed. They certainly had between them.
“Yours is closer.” He didn’t see the slight red blush on Dean’s face at his suggestion, but he felt his neck and shoulders warm up. He wouldn’t have expected Dean to be so flustered at the idea of Cas in his bed considering the fact that they had kissed not long ago, but Cas was far too tired to think.
