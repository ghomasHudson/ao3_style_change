I walked up to the royal dormitories and stood in the hallway in between the kings quarter and the princes, looking at both the doors in frustration. The guards that were stationed at each door were looking at me in amusement while I debated which one to go into.
The look was a look of a man who has pure fear in his heart.
"Your majesty, Crowley has asked for your company." He bows and I itch my eyebrow and nod my head absentmindly.
"I'm telling the truth. I will not kill you. If i wanted to kill you i could have done it a long time ago but i could never find the strenght to lift a blade to your neck or a poisoned apple to your throat little red."
“I know why you don’t love me anymore Castiel.” I tell him, trying not to cry and he looks at me quickly. “It because of the demon prince isn’t it?”
"Fine, is that all your highness?" I bow lowly and grimace.
“PAPA! PAPA YOU’RE HERE!” She cries over and over again as I hug her tightly.
“Hello little demon, my name is Gabriel.”
“You’re pregnant?” He asks me and I turn to him and raise my eyebrows questionably.
"Do you honestly have to go now?" I ask him sadly and he nods his head before standing next to Gabriel who was taking up back to his own kingdom in Lawrence. "Why now?"
“Don’t tell me what to do! You are a liar and a dirty dirty little cheat! You have betrayed me and you have betrayed our daughter!”
“Okay. Just give me two moments.” I tell him as I walk back to my chambers to tell Amelia that I won’t be here in the morning. She just nods at me and smiles before I walk back out her room and back towards Gabriel who is tapping his foot impatiently.
"Anael? I thought she had turned to the dark side." I chuckled but he shook his head.
"Then I don't know what else to do to apologise to Mariel's... Mary's memory." His lip trembled and I groaned loudly.
We marched on and on, my army was getting tired and restless. Everyone was getting agitated not only with me but with each other as well. I frowned, as I walked through the camp we had set up to rest, at all the angels bickering with each other and arguing over petty things. I sigh when I get back to my own tent and walk in to find Michael and Gabriel sat shouting at each other over which tactic is better.
“Castiel is coming with us baby girl, it will all make sense soon but for now I need you to go pack okay?” I say, smiling at the little girl as she nods her head suspiciously and turns to Castiel.
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree.
"And your the stupidest demon I'VE ever met." I retorted back and he throws his arms up in the air in defeat.
I walk outside and into the beautiful garden that was now ours. A number of different kind of flowers filled my nostrils and the colour of them all filled my sight. It was fantastically beautiful and i felt at peace. I walk further into the garden which is now covered with trees and place the palm of my hand on the bark of a tree, feeling the life that was coming from it. I snatched my hand away and hid behind the tree when i heard a soft humming sound coming from further into the forest and peered my head around it to see who was coming. I could see no one but the soft humming tune was getting louder and louder by the second.
"Oh your highness! Have you come to join us?" Anael asked happily as she stood up and curtseyed to me, her maids and friends following her movements close behind.
“Interesting? It was utter bullshit. He didn’t even react to his wife being an angel but instead told Castiel’s wife that he was in love with him instead. What is wrong with that bloody demon?”
“I was just going to ask how your meal with Lady Anna went.” He says and I snicker.
“Don’t even.”
“Yes, your highness.” They bow before turning back around and travelling back down the alley. I turn back to the angels who are looking at me in shock. I myself didn’t know why I did that but I just knew that there was no point in capturing these angels. They weren’t warriors, they were afraid of demons and they didn’t look like they were going to cause any problems.
“Where are you going?” Gabriel asks and we both stiffen up before turning to him. Castiel sighs and walks over to his brother, placing his hands on his shoulders and shaking them slightly in comfort.
“Did he?” I ask, trying to seem calm but inside I felt like I was tearing apart. “With Anna?”
"What?" I say impatiently, arching my back up slightly and he smiles down at me.
“I think he may be my fathers.” I grunt, not letting the fact get to me as I feel a shiver down my spine.
"It's your fault." I say to them quietly, eyes flashing milky white. "It's your fault she's dead. And here you both are, arguing with each other while yOUR OWN DAUGHTER, LIES DEAD ON THE EARTH. You are nothing but children, not even that, you are vermin on this earth.
"Damn it Castiel, what is it?" He groans in frustration and I shrug;
"What?"
"No where, just out in the forest." I say quickly and he frowns again.
“Val, if you don’t go to bed, Dada is going to eat you.” She drops her mouth in shock as I put three fingers up. “Three.” She backs away from me. “Two.” She jumps a bit on her feet. “ONE!” She squeals as I run after her, pretending to fall over as I do so.
"No, i'm not in love with you but that is only because i am incapable of loving anybody." She looked down at her feet dissappointed but nodded her head anyway. "I would like to still meet with you."
"Morning grumpy pants." He coos and I growl at him again, trying to push him off me. "Now now, don't be like that angel." He murmurs into my ear before trailing kissing down my neck. I give him another shove and she chuckles into my jaw before biting into my skin gently.
“My name is Castiel. I am king of the angels.” I tell her and her smile broadens.
"Don't be afraid." I find myself saying to the little girl who was cowering away from me. "I won't hurt you." Her eyes are wide and bright, she doesn't look scared, just wary of me. She was probably a young demon child who was rebelling against her parents about coming to the edge of the border. She looks me up and down and her eyes slowly drift to the hilt of my sword. I look down at it and slowly unsheaf it and she backs away from me. I put an arm up in defeat and slowly lower the sword to the ground before approaching the little girl.
"I know that." I sigh loudly and bite my lip. "I just can't keep myself away from you Cas, I need to be near you. These past few months have been hectic and miserable without you and I don't want to carry on without you."
“Oh my god.” I look at him quickly and he’s looking back at me in utter shock. His mouth his open, his eyes are wide and his eyebrows are raised. There is something in his eyes that I can’t quite make out and my eyebrows furrow in confusion.
“Stop.”
"I didn't mean too."
"That can't be good." I say to them and they shake their heads slowly. "We need to destroy these blacksmiths before they are allowed to make any more angel blades. Send a thousand of our best warriors to find them and put an end to them." I say regally and the advisor nods before hurrying out of my study and back down the stairs. I look down at myself and notice that I am still wearing the slave clothes, I groan loudly before clicking my fingers and my attire changes to a long tan coat with a good, white tunic with black leggings and a gold belt with a matching wrist lock. Black boots covered my feet made me feel more comfortable now than I had ever done before.
"Sam? But your name is Samuel." I grumble and he rolls his eyes.
"You have?"
"Well-" the door burst open and my father walked into the room, looking surprised about the fact that we were all stood around his door.
“You want me to send my women into army just because you have a gut feeling that this is all a trap?” Anna asks me and Dean’s head snaps up.
There was a moment of silence where I waited for him to say what he wanted I say or do what he wanted to do but he never did anything. I looked at him expectantly but he was looking at his feet like they were the most interesting thing in the world.
“Please, we haven’t done anything wrong.” Says a smaller girl. Her wings had obviously not grown fully yet and none of them were wearing angel armour. They were clearly not warriors but yet normal angels who were just in hiding from us demons. “Please your majesty.”
“Why shouldn’t I dare? You think I will let you bring my child up when you go out and sleep with a demon? A demon KING for that matter? What do you think your advisors and all your people would think of that? Do you think they would just not mind and let you get away with fúcking a demon? I don’t think so Castiel. I will not let my daughter be involved with a man who is not even faithful to his own wife. I can’t trust you with her.”
“You’re an angel?”
Val (POV)
"Castiel. You are king of the angels, not Gabriel." His voice was firm but not unkind.
"Anael came for a visit to the hideout near Turpixy." He said mildly and I look at him with my eyebrows raised.
"I'm so sick of all these stupid titles. Why can't we just call you by your Lucifer be damned names!" I stomped my foot and crossed by arms over my chest angrily.
"No, but you are." His eyes go wide and he looks from me to the back and then back to me again.
“Gabe it is then, tell me kid... What you doing down in the slave quarters. Don’t you know it’s haunted?”
"Yes your majesty." His voice is thick with sarcasm and sadness but I decide to ignore it and just keep riding on in silence, not wanting to upset him any further about the fact that angels and demons can't be friends and they exceptionally can't be lovers.
Castiel was king of the goddamn angels for heaven’s sake! Or at least he was which meant that he still had the power of the king. And Dean was part angel and part demon, he had powers of both good and evil within him and mixing them together, although tricky proved extremely powerful against evil beings as he and Sam found out when out on a hunt together one time.
"You had no right to look."
"You're a curious one, aren't you?"
“I-“I start but she storms off and a minute later she is sat on a horse and by my side, glaring at me slightly. My lips thinned but I turn on my horse and start riding anyway, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to get her off my back because of how stubborn she was. We ride off with an army of angels trailing behind us towards the battlefield where the army of demons were waiting.
"Those are good questions, Val." I smile at him and clasp my hands behind my back.
"Such as getting your son ready to become King of Lawrence. Has he chosen a bride yet?" Crowley asked my father but stared at me, eyes boring into my dark soul like he could see straight through it.
I find the tent easily enough but unfortunately there are two guards placed outside the front of it playing cards. There was no way I was getting into his tent unless I ripped part of the fabric with my knife around the back of it. And that is exactly what I did. I snuck round the back of the net and after checking that the coast was clear and ripped a tear in the back of it which was big enough to fit me though. I stuck my head in first to check again if the coast was clear and I saw only a single candle burning low next to a bundle of expensive fabric. It as moving up and down steadily so I knew that the king was asleep but this wasn't going to stop me any time soon so I snuck in and walked over to the sleeping angel slowly and quietly. When I got to him and knelt down and watched him sleep, his eyes flickering to a dream he was having and I smiled in adoration at the man. I brought a hand to his face and gently caressed it making him fidget in his sleep slightly before turning over and letting the fabric fall from his body so now it showed me one smooth naked leg which I couldn't help but run my hand along. My hands were cold and Castiel gasped at the touch, letting his eyes flicker open slightly and looking at me in a daze.
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
"What's your name?"
“It’s bad luck to talk about the dress.” She giggles and I roll my eyes and give her a pointed look.
“Get off me!” I screamed and shouted at the demon, kicking my legs up and swishing my wings. He dragged me down into the cellar along with my brother, Gabriel and a few other women angels whom I didn’t catch the name of. We were held down by our wings as a nutcase of a demon attached a cold hard metal collar onto our necks. This was it, the end. I was now trapped, but at least I was not alone. I had Gabriel and probably other angels that had already been caught whom I recognised. The demon did some sort of spell and I could feel the clasp begin to work. My wings were being inverted into my back and chained there and I could feel my powers begin to drain out of me. I was turning into just a regular human being.
“Well are you going to pick them up?”
"Y-your teeth. Your eyes. W-what-?" My eyes had turned milky white and my teeth had produced into sharp points as part of my original form coming out. I was originally a Seraphim before i fell from God, one of the originals. The first born of the angel kind. My real form was a serpent that breathed fire, humans called them dragons. Steam was flowing out of my mouth but i cooled down when i saw how terrified she looked.
"For me?"
"Okay." She smiles and shuffles towards me, stopping a few inches from my face. I look at her in confusion and she rolls her eyes.
“Valentina.” He whispers out and tears spring to my eyes but I try to hold them in.
"So good for me baby," He murmered under his breath. "You're still so tight and perfect after all these years."
"Took you long enough." I spit out, he clicks his fingers and his guards grab a hold of me and drag me off towards the dungeons. I look behind me towards where the king is still stood and start laughing. "You'll regret this demon, you and all of your little followers will regret ever enslaving any angel! You will pay for what you have done to our kind!"
"Oh Cas..." He says, resting his elbow on the table and pinching the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. I gulp slightly but don't take my eyes off him as i give him a sad look. "Don't look at me like that."
"I've never seen another child around these parts before. Where do you come from?"
“Your woman seemed worried about you.” He smiled and I coughed awkwardly.
“What’s wrong?”
"So you thought that you could put more stress on me just so the other angels wouldn't have any. How kind of you." I mock and he looks up at me.
“I need your help.”
"Your bath is ready... now?" With that he bursts out laughing and clutches his stomach, throwing his whole body into the laugh. I look at him surprised and shuffle awkwardly on my feet.
“Yes sir.”
"I just-" I start but he cuts me off by leaning down and slamming his lips on mine. For a moment i kiss back, bringing my hands up to his face but i suddenly let them drop and stand backwards, breaking this kiss and looking away from him.
"My name is Aneal." My eyes go wide suddenly before I regain my composure and look around us quickly to see if anyone was around.
“I beg your pardon, I’m doing no such thing.”
“Am I beautiful?” Valentina asked, blushing slightly. “Am I beautiful like momma?”
“Well, there was meant to be a flash of red light and fire coming from my hands but instead everything just went pure white, like I couldn’t see anything. Your eyes also opened and they were burning with white fire… isn’t that your grace?”
“Castiel.” I say to her and her smile drops. I look at her confused as he lips part slightly in shock.
“No, I don’t think it is.”
"I had fun last night." He murmered, bringing his face down to peck my lips softly. I smile, even though i didn't want to, into the kiss and deepen is but pulling him forwards. We break apart finally and he rests his forehead on mine contently, closing his eyes as he did so.
We walk down towards the market and Valentina is ecstatic when she see's a small puppet play going on near the docks. I tell Dean to stay with her while i rumage around the market to try and look for anything we need while also looking around for any angels or demons that may spot me. I had put a ring around Dean and Valentina so no magical being could see them but i didn't have enough power to put it over myself so i would just have to be extra careful. I grab a basket and the women were looking at me strangely, i only guessed it was because it was normally the women that did the shopping and the men who were working hard labour jobs for low pay. I smile at them and shrug.
“No.” Is all he says before I shake my head at him for the utter betrayal and extend my wings and finally fly off out of the castle and back towards home. I don’t know why I didn’t just kill him there and then but I just couldn’t bring myself to do that. He had killed my wife and taken my daughter but… I still loved him so much that it hurt, and it hurt even more now that I knew what he had done. I should have expected something like this from him, he was a demon after all.
“How the hell did you-“I say but he cuts me off as he pushes me back into my chambers and slams the door shut.
“How far along are you?” She asks me and I shrug.
“You think I don’t know where you have been Castiel?” She snarls at me and I just keep looking at her without a care at all. “You think I don’t know who you have been with? I know exactly where you have been! How could you do this to me Castiel? How could you go and see that monster when I was trying to make you fall for me again? You know what you are? You’re his little bitch!” She screams at me and I grit my teeth angrily.
Castiel’s heart wells in it’s chest when Dean argues his point across. He wasn’t going to leave Castiel again, he had made his point and the honest to god truth was, Castiel didn’t want him to leave anyway. He didn’t want him to pretend that this meeting never happened because even though they had missed ten thousand years of each other’s lives, that would leave ten thousand years of catching up to do. They would never not have anything to talk about, and when they were not talking….
"Actually there was something my lady." I say seriously and her smile dropped and her chest heaved as she breathe in heavily.
“I don’t see anything.” He says and I grimace slightly. See? No room for beauty in their twisted minds.
"Not so sure your majesty, we got called down here un-expectantly also." I purse my lips and turn around when I hear the doors opening and watching two angels walk in.
“No I’m not, because I have as well.” I don’t know what came over me, it had just slipped out and he looked up at me quickly.
"You sure darling?" I ask him, my eyes flickering black which only makes him móan again at my sudden dominance. He nods his head frantically and I flip hip around so he is facing the floor, lifting his híps up so he's now knéeling in front of me, expósing himself to me. I make him lick my fíngers which I find so hot before bringing my hand back around and slipping a fingér intó him. I slidé another one in for good measure and start curling it around insíde him make him arch his back and throw his head back in pleásure.
Crowley (POV)
Papa sent me to upstairs for a little while but even with the door closed it didn’t stop the shouts from travelling up the stairs and towards my ears. I heard something break from downstairs and then boots slamming across the wooden floors. There was one more shout before the door slammed shut and then everything went quiet. I stayed in my room for a few more minutes before tiptoeing down the stairs and towards the dining room where papa was sat with his head in his arms resting on the table. There was small whimpering noises coming from him and I didn’t like it. Not one bit. I stuck my bottom lip out and walked slowly and quietly towards him. My hand rested on his shoulder and he jumped slightly before looking at me and breathing out heavily. His eyes were red and puffy and his face was pale.
"For what?"
"Promise?"
"Piss off." I grumble and a huge grin spreads across his face, his eyes twinkling as he straddles naked body and looks down on me.
"I love you Dean." I choke out before turning my head to the side to kiss him. "I love you so much."
“I love you.” I mumble out quietly.
“I didn’t know she was yours Castiel, I promise I didn’t. I found the baby next to the river bank and looked for hours for the mother. I even stayed in the same spot for so long hoping that someone would come and collect her but then she started crying and I realised she was hungry. I didn’t have any food on me Castiel, I brought her back here and fed her. I kept going back to the river bank hoping that the mother would turn up but she never did. I looked after her, but I promise you, I did not kill Leliel and I did not know this child was yours. You know I wouldn’t do that to you Cas, you know I would have given her to you if I realised she was yours.” I glare at him angrily through his whole explanation and breathe out a breath of smoke that proved my insides where on fire with anger. “Please, you have to believe me.”
"Hello Luce." She says, walking up to me.
"Dean, holy- Dean oh yes." He stámmers, dropping his head to the floor and clutching his hair as he keeps rócking his hips. Suddenly I take my fíngers out of him and he makes a noise of complaint at the sudden loss which turns into a yelp when I gráb his hair and pull his head back up. With my other hand I spréad his legs a bit wider before gripping onto his waist and súcking on his skin.
"A-angel." He stutters out, sitting up and making me complain slightly. My eyes tried focusing on the beautiful features of his face rather than the beautiful features of something else that was only a few inches down.
“No Cas, I don’t want to hear it. Give Leliel my love, I’ll tell Crowley that you agreed on my request.” With that I turn on my heel and begin walking away from him. I don’t know why I did that, I knew he was married and was having a child after all but I couldn’t help but be overcome with jealousy. A lump had formed in my throat as I walked back but I gulped it down before appearing beside Crowley.
“Why did you name her Valentina?” He asked me seriously and I bite my bottom lip and look down at my hands. “Dean?”
Gabriel, King of the angels and Sam, King of Lawrence made a pact and soon enough the two kingdoms were conjoined together. However this did not last long as angels and demons did not work well together and after a millennia, the kingdoms fell. Angels either went up to heaven or stayed in earth to become guardians of the Homo sapiens. Demons either got banished to hell by someone of higher power than them of stayed on earth to wreak havoc wherever they went.
"Your majesty." He says, his voice thick with a hidden emotion.
“Yeah, that’s probably a good idea.” Leliel nods, picking skin of the berry that was stuck between her teeth casually and Castiel couldn’t help but grin at her and shake his head in disbelief at the eccentricity of the woman. Just then Emandriel comes out into the garden and giggles when she see’s Castiel. “Oh goodness, she is annoying isn’t she?” Leliel says loudly and Emandriel sends her a death glare. Gabriel laughs out loud then and Castiel tries to hold back a grin from his face.
“Oops, sorry there kid!” He exclaimed and grinned broadly at me.
"Leliel, calm down. His mother was an angel so he's half angel. Besides i know him." I say, grabbing her hand that was gripping my arm tightly and holding her hand. "He's a good person."
"Got you." I muttered to myself and managed to push my fingers into him further to reach his prostate again. He moaned loudly in pleasure and I smiled proudly at myself. I hit it a few times with my fingers before adding the final finger inside of him, making sure to spread his legs even wider then before. He groaned in pain when the third one went in and when it was finally all the way in I stayed still for a moment to let him get used to it.
Crowley, the king of hell had known that there was something fishy about The First Fallen not killing the little girl so he had followed him and watched them both as their romance bloomed. Then on her 18th birthday, just like he had done to her own mother, he set one of his dirty trolls to slaughter the young girl.
“Well hurry up then.”
“I can’t Samuel, your father and brother would never give up on trying to get you back. It would be too dangerous and who knows what the younger angels will think of me bringing in a young demon. I’m sorry Sam.” His lip trembles as he looks back at Gabriel. Gabriel’s face is expressionless so I don’t know what he is feeling so without another word Sam walks, or pushes, past all the angels and out of the camp without a single angel trying to grab him. “I’m sorry Gabriel.” I say to him and he just nods and bows before turning around and walking off silently. I sight and rub my forehead before telling everyone to get back to work and going back to my parchments, this was going to be a long day.
“The necklace, it is Leliel’s. S-she, she was my wife but she died after having a child and then the child went missing.” He looks into my eyes again but what he is saying didn’t really make any sense. “Where have you been?”
“Why would I do that?” I ask innocently and he groans in sexual frustration.
Meanwhile in another part of the country, Crowley and some of his closest warriors are on a search for a fallen star. A human prophet had told them that the fallen star will bring about victory for the demons in more ways then one. He told them that they will be able to enslave the angels and bring about peace to the demons, letting them rule the earth the way they wanted to rule it. They rode on horseback for days when finally they reached a desert land where they were told the star fell.
"She fought for the angels?" He asked incrediously and i smiled and nodded.
"Sexual experience you mean?" I ask and he nods in embaressment. "Okay, so what do you want me to do about it?"
"He's the king of the angels."
"What's with the moody face?" She asks after a while and i shrug.
Castiel walks out from behind a tree, looking at my wings with his lips parted and eyes wide. He then looks at the necklace in his hands and shakes his head, tearing up a bit before looking into my eyes. I gulp and quickly try and hide my wings from him but he steps forwards quickly as I back away from him.
"You just said sorry." Sam says and I cough awkwardly.
"Around the castle somewhere your majesty, but where I have no clue. I will get one of the guards to go and fetch her." I nod absentmindedly at his decision and turn to face the view once again. "I knew where you were."
“What?”
"Best be off." He says before turning around but I stop him.
Cas (POV)
But I’m half angel; I’m not even fully demon. We could be together.
“I think we should pull our your imperial majesty, I think Alistair is right. We don’t have nearly enough demons to fight the whole angel army and we have friends on the other side of the world that we can call upon to help us fight but I will take them months to get here. I say we wait for them to arrive before we start the main battle.” I say, not sure if that was what he wanted to here. Crowley sighs and rolls his eyes before nodding.
"I'm sorry your highness but we need to get you to a safe place. There has been a break in. The angels have come to claim back their king once they found out that we have locked him up." The guard said and my eyes shoot open. I jump out of bed and quickly slip on my robe. I don't even bother to get change or even wait for the guard as I run down the hallways and towards the dungeons where I hoped Cas would still be. I pushed passed the guards who warned me not to go down there and looked upon the darkness of the broken and smashed up cells. Angels were all standing, facing the guards and demon soldiers but the one that stood out the most was my angel. He was still wearing his slave garments but the seal around his neck was broken and lay like scrunched up parchment upon the floor. His wings were fully spread out and I gaped in awe at the sight of them. They were as black as winter's night but looked soft to touch, they were big and glowing slightly with his grace and power. He was holding a demon sword that he must have grabbed of one of the guards high above his head and was shouting some incantation at them in Enochian which flowed gracefully from his lips. I pushed through the guards and just as he was about to swing the sword down on one of them I stood in front of him, holding my arms up to try and stop the blow.
“Sam really likes it here.” I say, wondering out loud and I see Castiel nod from the corner of my eye. “I was wondering, when I become king…. What would you say to him coming to live here? Where his mother grew up? He’s more angel than demon anyways.”
Dean (POV)
"Merry Christmas." God says, smiling at us as we look at him in confusion once again. He walks inside the house without wen being invited and before following him in, me and Dean look at one another frightfully. Valentina on the other hand does not seem phased at all by the sudden appearance of the Angel God but in fact had more or less embraced it and was now inspecting the flower that he had given her.
"It's just, i was hoping for something else."
"I'm getting there!"
We sat in complete silence, both of us staring into space as we just sat in each others company. Finally i turned to face him, looking at him properly for the first time in years. He looked almost older and wiser then ever, like something in his life had drastically changed. There were bags under his eyes and stubble on his face but he still looked happy, and he still looked handsome. I suppose he could be an old decrepid man and still look handsome. I made myself smile by thinking this and he raised an eyebrow as i just smiled studidly at him.
“It’s not all that bad boy, I found your mother during one of these balls.” We look around the hall were angels were getting it ready for tonight. Large ornaments and flowers were being strung up while tables and chairs were being scattered around the room. A stand for an orchestra to play was also being set up and I pulled a face. “She was the most beautiful woman in the room. She stood right in the middle of the hall, he hair was down to her bottom and she had on a pure gold tiara that was circling her head.”
"Castiel?" I look around to see a lady stood there, she was wearing a long red dress that clashed with her same coloured hair. I recognised this as the demon who Dean was planning on marrying so I stood up quickly and bowed to her.
“You need to get out of here.” I warn them and the brother snaps out of his shock and nods seriously. “Do you have a way to go?”
For a while, Dean and Lucifer worked together to find the killer of Valentina as they knew it was no coincidence that a troll had suddenly sprung up out of nowhere and murdered the poor child. However this did not last long and soon Dean went his separate way, trying to find his lost lover.
"Your Majesty." Gasped a voice from the front of the hall and I looked up to see my right hand man, Michael walking carefully towards me and bowing.
"You don't already? How old are you again." She snorts again.
He finished his song and smiled at me kindly, showing a small amount of his white teeth. I stopped suddenly and looked at him shyly and curiously, biting the inside of my mouth.
“Please, I don’t want you to go!” Leliel shouted at me and I frown at her before kissing her forehead.
"No Sammy, I didn't really have a mistress. I can just tell everyone I had a mistress and she got pregnant but didn't want the child so she left it with the slaves downstairs. I can get Amelia to say she found her when she was doing her morning rounds." Sam nods slightly and smiles.
"It was good." I replied back.
“Shut up Winchester.” He leans down and places his lips down on mine eagerly, biting and sucking on my bottom lip. I gasp when his hand reaches in between my legs and palms me softly which gives him chance to slide his tongue into my mouth and explore around as if he had never done this with me before. I put my arms above my head and he holds them with his spare hand while his other one is busy trying to slide my leggings down. When he finally gets them off without breaking the heated kiss he breaks apart for a quick send to pull my tunic over my head and leans back down again. I spin us around so I’m sat on his clothed body completely naked myself and smirk down at him. His face his red and his lips are swollen, his hair was a hot mess and his ears were burning from passion.
It takes me a day and a half to finally get to the border and find Castiel and Valentina who have pitched a tend and were sitting comfortably around a warm fire as Valentina told him stories about her childhood. He was listening intently as I walked up to them and Val was the first one to notice my arrival as she shot up and came to hug me. I smiled and sat down next to Castiel as she sat in front of us and resumed her story. Somewhere along the lines Castiel’s hand slid into mine, our fingers linking as we sat listening to my-his…. Our daughter ramble on about how she once got her mattress and slid down the huge staircase back at the demon kingdom, back home.
“I don’t love you.” He says quickly before looking at me and gulping. “I’m kind of thankful that you’re leaving because I wasn’t ready to marry anyone yet anyway.”
"I told you to call me Sam! It's what everyone else is doing."
“Fine.” Anna says suddenly and I raise my eyebrows at her. She looks at me and sighed before throwing her arms up in the air dramatically and walking out the great hall for me and King Dean to follow her. I glance at Dean who is still looking at me suspiciously before walking after Anna.
"Yes I do, but I cannot tell you Castiel. Perhaps it is tomorrow or maybe 20 years from now. But he will come."
“Your majesty, I didn’t realise you would be coming down here today!” The king ignored her and looked towards us.
"Why are you in love with me?" I say a bit harsher than i intended too.
Lucifer (POV)
“YOU KILLED MY WIFE, you killed her after she had given birth to my daughter and then you took my baby and you raised her to be a God forsaken demon! How could you do that to me? You ruined my life!” Dean’s eyes softened slightly in sudden realisation of what was going on.
“Sure there is nothing wrong. Come on Cas, tell me.”
“Come lay with me?” He asks and I quirk an eyebrow at him. “Not like that. Just lay with me.” He grabs my hand and pulls me towards his bed chamber, plopping down on his bed and letting me sit down beside him by myself. I do so, although I feel awkward and all of a sudden shy.
"Tadaa!" I say, smiling broadly and Sam just rolls his eyes before getting up and trying to put the baby in the crib. "I wanna do it!" I tell him and he hands me her to gently put her down in the newly forged crib. I stand over it and watch her sleep with a certain calmness coming over me.
"What about him?"
"what?" Gabriel looked up at me in shock as did Sam.
“Castiel, he’s your father. Your real father, your mother was his wife but something attacked her and she must have died after giving birth to you. Your father spent 7 years looking for you and when he found you he invited you to come and live with him as you know. But I chased him down and we came to an agreement instead.”
"You don't have one." He mocks and I roll my eyes
"No, I can't imagine that you do." I hold my hand out for her to take and with that we walk out of the hall together, hand in hand. Suddenly I stop and look at her. She stops also and stares back at me again, tilting her head to the left slightly. "Is something wrong?"
“DADDY!” Valentina shouts loudly and runs over to Castiel and hugs him tightly. Castiel freezes and looks down at her in shock before looking up at me with tears in his eyes. ‘Thank you’ he mouths to me and I smile and nod my head as he kneels down in front of her and gives her a proper hug. “What was Momma like?” She asks him and her arms cling to him.
"Why don't you open it and find out?" He tells me I blush before opening the box carefully and peering inside. I gasp slightly when I see a beautiful blue necklace inside, one that had the same colour as my eyes. I pick it out of the box and look at it with wide eyes, holding it carefully in my hands. “It was your mothers.” Was all father had said to me, not elaborating but just letting me know that I finally had something that belonged to my mother.
"Maybe it will Dean." He whispers, putting his hands on the back of my neck and closing his own eyes. "Maybe it will be forever."
“Because no one knows about her! They all thought she was a demon because she could change her appearance and appear as a demon. Okay?” He sighs and goes to sit down on one of the chairs around the table. He looks old and tired, a way that I had never seen him before in my life. “I didn’t even know she was an angel until it was too late, I had already fallen for her but the surprise was that she had fallen for me also.”
"I suppose I should do this properly, I was wondering if you would like to go to luncheon with me? To get to know each other a little better. I have to admit that out of all the gorgeous women at the ball, you were the one that stood out with your beautiful red hair and big green eyes." I smiled at her and she blushed prettily before giggling.
"Good by Valentina." He says, smiling brightly with a small twinkle in his eye which brings butterflies to my stomach. "I hope to see you again."
"I hope so too." With that i run off back to my house where dada is stood outside with his arms crossed.
“You’re too much.”
Castiel.
“I’m fine.” I say a bit too quickly and she raises an eyebrow. I sigh and rub my eyes before looking at her. “Honestly I am but it just all happened so quickly you know and I suppose I’m still in a state of shock.”
“I don’t know, but I don’t think I will be coming back.” With that Castiel kisses the forehead of his brother, bids farewell to him and walks towards me, beckoning me to follow him. I do so and we go towards Valentina’s room where she is packing her things excitedly. Castiel had bought her toys, clothes, bedding and all other kinds of different jewels and items which she treasured to the bottom of her heart. She places them all slowly and gently in her bag and Castiel lifts his fingers up to hurry the process along but I stop him.
"Cas..." I begin to say but with a swoop of his almighty wings he flies up above the demons and shoots out of the dungeons and up towards freedom. I wondered how with just a click of his fingers he could free those other angels when I realised that he must have been playing weak this whole time, trying to get information out of the castle in any way or form. I begin running back up the stone cold steps and towards the great hall where I knew my father and brother would be waiting for me. When I burst into the hall, there was even more commotion in here then there was down in the dungeons.
"But what about your father or your mother? Your brothers or sisters? Your aunties an uncles? What about your family and friends? Is there no one to feed you and look after you?" I ask and he just shrugs.
"I didn't at the time Sire, but I do now. I regret every day, every single say the way I killed her. We must save her son's, we must bring them here and teach them how to be angels rather than demons." I shook my head at his idea but Gabriel stepped in.
“Well, we have our own room now so I was kind of hoping we could-“ Castiel shot up and dragged me up with him by the hand. I laugh under my breath and he drags me upstairs with him and then pushes me onto the bed when we get to our bedroom before climbing on top of me. “Not so tired now, are we?” I smirk and he grumbles and shakes his head.
"Who's Cas?" He squeaked and I bit my bottom lip. "It's not... Castiel is it?"
"Your Majesty, we have some more information on- what are you doing?" I had resulted into leaning on the doorframe with my coat handing off my shoulder. ABORT ABORT MISSION! I straightened up and coughed awkwardly, avoiding the angel's gaze.
"What are you doing out here? It's freezing." He shivers and I nod my head before walking into my study and shutting doors behind Dean.
"Forget about it." I mumble out and she closes her mouth and nods her head, biting her lip slightly out of embaressment.
"I know you think that I betrayed our kind Michael, but that is not the case. I have some information for you." I keep my head held high as his piercing blue eyes bare into me.
“I don’t know, I only know that this is hurting like a bitch.” I look down and see a hand print on my chest where Dean had branded me and hissed when I poked at it.
"Dean..."
"Let's fly." He ordered the angels and they all took flight above us, swishing about the broken cells before finally flying off. Demons tried to catch them but I took no notice of the commotion going on behind me. I was still staring at Castiel who was looking back at me calmly. "Do not try and find me Dean, you will not succeed."
"Come on." I pulled at him and led him slowly towards the bed, walking backwards so I didn't break eye contact with him. He was blushing furiously and it almost made me laugh at how pathetic demons were. We entered his bed chambers and I picked him up, wrapping his legs around my waist before leaning my head upwards and placing my lips on his. My whole body felt like it was on fire with that one single kiss and that is how I got addicted to him, going into a sort of frenzy. This kiss was only meant to be a small one so it lingered on his mouth but I lost control and chucked him into his bed before climbing in top of him and attaching my lips to his once again. He gasped and groaned at the sudden movements but I just couldn't stop myself. I ran a tongue along his bottom lip before forcing them open with my tongue. He finally granted me entrance and my tongue explored his mouth like there was no tomorrow, more sparks and fire spreading through me due to the taste of him and the feel of his tongue wrapping around mine. I finally sat up on him, straddling his hips and looked down on him. His lips were red and puffy, his eyes wide in shock, his cheeks blushed and his hair a mess from when I ran my fingers through them. He looked so beautiful underneath me and that was something I never thought I'd say about a demon.
“My husband would never be in love with vermin like that.” I snarl at her angrily and she raises her arms in defeat.
"Well aren't you the optimist." He gave me a bitch face and turned around to stalk out of the room, leaving me alone once more. I had decided to get a good night's rest and try to speak to Cas tomorrow, not knowing what to say but to try and prize more information out of him about who he really is. I would sleep on it.
“I can’t g-“
“You did, but that isn’t going to stop me from never letting you live this down. You’re pregnant to an angel who might be in love with a demon. That is priceless.” She laughs loudly and it echo’s down the halls while and ball my hands up into fists and shove her against the wall angrily.
“Ah no, I came for you actually.”
“How did you do that?” He asked wondrously and I shrug
“Okay, sorry.” She says sarcastically as I let her go and carry on walking. “Now let’s go kill some demons.”
“I do.”
“Alright, let’s do this”
"Dean, i'm sorry."
“I’m not.” He growls and I grin
"Ergh, love. I hate it."
“Meet me tonight? We shall have dinner in my chambers.” She nods and opens her mouth to speak but my father calls me over. I kiss her hand before walking over to him to hear what he has to say.
Castiel walked the streets, feeling extremely low today as he knew what today way. Today was another 18th year and the millionth time he was going to see his little girl but unable to get anywhere near her. He didn’t feel up to it today, it always took him so long to get over it. He had tried so many different times in so many different ways to get in touch with Lucifer and try to take back the curse or at least change it so I didn’t feel so damn crappy every time it happened.
"Don't you dare say it"
"It's been two years Castiel, of course there is something new."
"Hello dada." I say quickly and out of breath while he frowns at me.
“Y-yes.”
"I thought you couldn't love." She says dubiously and i groan and lean back against the grass with my face in my hands.
“Not until you apologise.” I say smugly, smiling as I do so.
“Oh Cas,” He says. “How I’ve missed you, my angel.” His chest heaves slightly as a sob tries to escape but Dean doesn’t let it.
"Dirty." He replies simply but he can't hold the smile from his face. I shake my head at him when he takes the crown off and inspects its value. He then starts taking off my clothes again but as he does, I notice him smelling himself and grimacing. I suppose that he hadn't bathed since he got here which was more than six months ago now and I frown. When he is back in his normal slave clothes he walks over to the lavender that is placed in a glass bowl at the end of my bed, grabs some and starts rubbing his body with it. "I smell."
"Because that is my name." I say bluntly and she bursts into tears right in front of me. Something inside of me tugs and hurts my chest slightly at the sight but i decide to ignore it, instead focusing on her.
"Tell me about it. I don't think i can go on with the image of that in my head for all of time." I shudder again as the image of Dad kneeling up behind pops covers my mind.
"That's your business not mine." He snorts and I sigh and roll my eyes.
"Hello you." He says softly and my lip trembles as i collapse into his arms, pulling him in close to me as i start sobbing into his chest. "Shhh, Cas. It's okay." He whispers gently as i cling to his shirt. I don't know why i was breaking down now, i suppose it was because i hadn't seen him in so long and with everything that had happened i just couldn't keep it in any longer. I had been sad, i had been angry and now i just felt empty.
"You're holding her all wrong then." She tells me and I huff as I hear Sam cackle behind me. She walks a bit in and closes the door behind her before holding her baby closer to her body. "I'm guessing you want me to feed her?"
"So, what do you say?" I ask, grinning slightly and walking slowly towards him. "Would you like that your highness," I lean in to whisper in his ear. "-for me to fuck you."
"But why would they take the body? And who would do that?"
“Oh yes, that is probably the thing that I miss the most you know.” Gabriel says, looking up at the sky himself. I smile at my younger brother and pat him on the shoulder before turning on my heel. “Castiel, I’m sorry you have to go through the things you do in this place.”
“Yeah, whatever Gabriel.”
“Hell yeah! Let’s go get you LAID!”
"Finally." She scolds, handing us our cloaks and walking over to the door, stepping out quickly. Dean gives me a worried look and I just pout at him before following our daughter out of the door quickly, only to find her already down at the bottom of the path and next to a large oak tree. "Hurry up!" She says again, stomping her little feet so me and Dean walk a little faster towards her. She holds out her hands so we take one each and start walking away from the protection of the house and into the woods.
"His name is Castiel! The king papa! The king of the angels." Dada's eyes narrowed slightly and he bit the inside of his cheek hard.
"Ah, ah.." I moan softly, finally finding enough energy to rock my hips into the palm of his hand. Our breathing was ragged, soft noises coming out of our noses as our mouths were preoccupied with each others tongues fighting for dominance. He was going to win, he was going to top today, he was in that frame of mind.
"Hey Cas." I say simply and he sits up slightly, looking about his tent.
"Maybe, but they didn't need Leliel for that. They have my daughter and they know that an angel will do anything for their kin." I tell him and he sighs and rubs his eyes.
"Yes, i am." I say, leaning against the cold wall, looking down at the girl on the other side. "I rule the angel kingdome, just a while back from here." I point behind me and she nods her head enthustatically.
I wake up the next morning feeling better then i have done in a long time. My eyes were still tightly shut and my mouth was curved upwards into a smile as warm quilts as well as Dean's arms are wrapped around me comfortably, making me warm and cosy against the morning chill drifting in through the fireplace but it wasn't hitting me at all, i was so comfortable...
“Hello Leliel.”
"Was there something you wanted to say Cas?" He asks expectantly, smiling a little as my strange behaviour. I put my own fork down and look up at him, licking my lips slightly.
“Oh yes, there’s a ghost now…” I turn around quickly to see what is behind me and Gabe is now stood in front of me again. I look at him in confusion and turn slowly back around to see an apparition of him slowly disappearing.
"Thank you little brother. Now I have got a job to do." He grinned at me before walking over to the group of men and within minutes they were all in stitches.
"it was extraordinary, he saw us when he and his fathers army were looking for angels but when he came to us he let us go instead of actually capturing us." Adam says, looking at me with bewilderment. I nod and look back at Michael.
"I know you're upset about your brother..."
"You won't like it."
"Shut it!" The guard smacked me around the back of my head and I grunted in pain. My feet were dragging along the floor while the two guards had a hold of an arm each. I growled and snapped at them both, struggling.
"Sammy." I say softly as I walk over to him and sit down next to him, placing an arm around his shoulders. "Everything will be okay."
I recognised the voice of God but i didn't know what it meant. What all relies on me? What did he mean by that? Suddenly, from somewhere in the forest there was a shrill scream. I turned around quickly and my cold but slowly warming heart almost stopped in my chest.
“I should hope so.” She winks before turning around and walking out of my chambers. I sigh and the smile drops from my face. There was still a shred of hope left in me that Castiel might just swoop in on those large black beautiful wings of his and pick me up when I’m just about to say “I do” and carry me off into the sunset. Wow, talk about being in another life.
I don’t know how long me and papa were sat there for but dada came back, walking slowly into the dining room and looking at us both sadly. He carried a bunch of blue flowers in his hands and I slid off papa’s knee and ran up to him while papa looked at him seriously.
"What was your mistresses name?"
“Shut up.” I mumble before carrying on down the stone steps and towards the garden where we first met. When we got there the smile dropped from Castiel’s face, my heart was beating loudly in my chest as I hoped to see some sort of expression on his face. Even if it wasn’t love, maybe nostalgia or want. I had no idea but I wanted something to be there.
"If anyone is the scum here, it's you." I snarl and he growls lowly at me.
"Oh Dean, f-faster." He manages to moán out and i try to pump my hand faster all the while his own hand had slipped into my own leggings and had begun to do the same routine as I was. Our bodies were thrustíng agaist each others and i looked up at Cas above me to see his forehead was glistening with sweat as he pánted away, his mouth parted open and his eyes tightly shut. "P-please." He begged but i didn't paticularly know what he was begging for until he began coming into my hand and inside of his leggings, shouting out my name loudly as he did so.
Valentina (POV) *three years later* 5 Years Old
"That was our first kiss!"
"I can't believe i'm 18 already, time flies so quickly." She sighs, sitting down on the tree stump. My hands itch as i pat the present in my pocket to make sure it was still there.
"I know i didn't. I wanted to see for myself."
"F-father?" I mutter after telling Dean who was stood in front of us gracefully, smiling. Valentina walks out from behind Dean and past me. I try grabbing her, even though I wasn't particular sure why but my reactions were too late. She walks up to Him and stands in front of Him, smiling up at Him.
"Not until I see Gabe." He pouts before disappearing out if the slit in the tent. I turn to Cas and shake my head in disbelief while Cas just laughs, amused by my actions.
“I’ve missed you too.”
"Like I said, it needed to be done."
"You know where they are?" He asked surprised and i look at him and snort.
“Your highness, we have a lot of angels down here. Any one in particular?”
"Good." She replied simply, letting go of my neck and tapping my nose with her forefinger. He grin at her and kiss her nose before placing her back down on the floor.
"I don't know." I whisper and wipe my face again, hoping to get rid of the acidy substance. It burnt my face when it ran down it and I assumed it must be the salt within it, not knowing how it got there at all.
"No you didn't, you knew exactly where I was. I know you have spies working at the castle in Lawrence." His lips thinner and his eyes narrowed. He pursed his lips and leaned back on his desk, putting a hand on either side of him to hold himself up.
"I've already asked Marian, she says she will go if you say yes." I say, smiling broadly and battering my eyeslashes at father.
“Oh Lucifer, please don’t let a child be in there.” I pray as I walk steadily over to it a look down. I sigh and grimace. “Alright, thanks Lucifer, I pray to you and this is what you give me. The exact think I wished not to see.” Inside the basket was a baby girl, with raven curly hair and big blue eyes. I had to admit she was a cute little thing so I knelt down and picked her up, cradling her to my chest and cooing at her before looking around for any sign of its mother or father.
“I’m not going to hurt you.” I whisper. I hear a noise from the entrance of the alleyway and turn to look down it. Some of my men were travelling down it quietly so I call out to them. “It’s just me lads, nothing down here.”
"So I've heard." He clicks his fingers for one of the angels to come to him and murmurs something into her ear. She walks off and a couple of minutes later she walks back in with another angel at her side. "Tell her about your meeting with the demon prince Adam."
"Sometimes i feel like i can sense her, like she is talking to me or trying to find me. I sense when she is upset and even when she is joyful. I believe that she is still alive but... how do we find her?" I speaking more to myself now, mumbling out who would want the baby. Who would want my daughter? My enemies, obviously. Crowley? I don't think so, he was too clever for that. He would know that he would be the first person i would go after... but i wouldn't put it past him.
He hadn’t changed much, he still was rough skinned and sexy to the bone. His jawline was high and his eyes were wide and still as green as the day Castiel had first met him. Dean’s hair looked like it had gotten darker which was probably because of the climate change and how it had actually gotten colder, making his hair change darker in the process.
They would never let me out on my own but I found ways to leave the house without being noticed. Sometimes Papa and Dada would go upstairs for a few hours and play their own games so whenever they did this I always took it in my stride to leave the house and walk around for a little while. My imagination was large so I pretended I had friends of all species. Demons and angels would walk together hand In hand in my imagination, just like dada and papa do, mermaids would be able to grow legs and run about on the sand, fairies would be able to grow big and play with the children before flying off again. It was my favourite time of the day when I got to do this.
"You don't like it?"
“I don’t know…” I contemplate but he spins me back around and gives me a pleading look.
"Who found her?" He asks.
"What would you do if they kidnapped me?" I asked him angrily and his mouth opened in shock. "Or Leliel?"
Dada was still holding onto the flowers while papa was sat in front of him with his arms crossed and angrily staring up at him. Dada was saying something, an apologetic look in his eyes as his shoulders slumped forwards while papa was shaking his head and looking away from him. I frown, take the flower out of the water and walk back into the dining room. They both look at me and stop talking for a moment, watching me as I walk over to papa and handing him the flower. He delicately takes it from me and smiles at me sadly. I lean in to whisper in his ear so dada can’t hear me.
“Yeah, and you can go and see how your pregnant wife is doing.” My voice drips with venom slightly and he frowns and looks down at his hands before straightening up slightly, not wanting to make it look like he is losing his touch on being king.
This was taking forever, I knew I needed to look for my daughter but I was stopping every ten seconds to try and hear a cry or see a bundle of rags shuffling around. I needed to hurry the process as I had no idea what could have taken my little girl. I rode on a bit more but again I stopped when I heard a bird cry, almost thinking that it was a baby. I scowled up at the eagle flying around my heard and growled at it.
“No.” He says quickly, staring me down slightly.
"Oh shush you!" I say, stepping towards her and tickling her so she fell back onto the bed, laughing madly. I stopped suddenly; hovering over her with an arm placed either side of her head to hold me up above her. She stopped laughing and looked up at me seriously, neither of us moving but just looking into each other eyes.
"Who are you?" He asks.
I see a couple of angels running towards my chambers and I know that the body will be cleared in a matter of minutes. I give my courtiers one last glare before slowly making my way towards me room once again, wanting to put Valentina back for her nap.
“Fuck, I love you.” Castiel shouts, slamming his lips on Dean’s for the first time in ten thousand years. The kiss was sloppy and not well thought out but neither of them cared very much. They were so damn hungry for each other. Castiel pushed Dean into one of the cubicles in the toilet and kicked the door shut, reaching a hand out behind him to lock it. All that could be heard in the small cubicle or in fact the whole toilet was the heavy gasping and panting coming from the boys mouths that were greedily biting, sucking and kissing one anothers.
“Not tonight Leliel, I’m too busy.” She frowned at my words and before I could get up and leave she grabbed my cloak and kneeled up in our bed so she came face to face with me. I looked at her in wonder and she gulped before opening her mouth to speak.
“Well I’m prince Samuel but you can call me Sam.” I looked at him in shock and bowed low.
“D-dean, please Dean. Oh my god, please.” He stutters out, begging me to touch him more. “I’ve wanted, I’ve needed you for so long. Please.”
"I'm sorry Dean, I wanted to but she was only doing her job." He says, avoiding my gaze slightly. I smile at him and lift his chin up to et him to look back at me.
"Not it Azazel, HER. And she's mine of course." He looks at me in surprise and I just shrug. "I had a mistress and she had a baby. She couldn't cope with her so she left her here and now I'm looking after her."
"No. No. Please, God. Please let her be okay." I whisper to myself, walking slowly towards her and crouching beside her, turning her body so i can see her face. A loud, broken sob escapes my mouth when i see her dead, lifeless eyes staring up at me, the terror of her endeavors with the troll still etched upon her face.
“Valentina, it’s either father or Dean! Not dada!”
“Excuse me?” I asked the young boy and he looked up at me in shock and quickly stood up. “You don’t happen to know where the kings quarters are?”
"You alright there kid?" One of the guards asked, chuckling slightly. "You look lost."
“That was weird.” Dean mumbles and I look at him in confusion.
“No.” He replied and I could feel my heart shatter into a thousand pieces and I let out a loud sob and clutched my chest, the pain bursting through my body like fire and stab wounds. I fell back onto the bed, shielding my face from the look in his eyes, not wanting to show that I was breaking but it was obvious. So obvious that he had broken my heart the way sobs stuck in my throat and tears poured out of my eyes. How could he do this to me? How could he just fall out of love with me like he has?
"I've learned never to trust a demon."
"Of course I know your name." He replies and starts fidgeting with the buttons on his waistcoat. "I-I just, erm."
“Well I’m glad you think so Sasquatch, you know exactly what a guy like me wants to hear.” He grins broadly and I laugh at him.
"Oh I got it! I had a mistress." I tell him and he cocks his head slightly.
"Come on Sam, quit bugging me. I'm busy." I snap at my little brother and he sits down in front of me in a huff.
“C’mon Cas, don’t be an ass. We are all dying out there, we need more men.” Cas rolls his eyes and sighs.
“I don’t really want too to be honest with you Winchester.” Castiel says, inspecting his fingernails casually. “I think I’m having fun here, especially on the nights.” He smirks again and I can’t help but return it.
"You keep snorting like that and you're going to turn into a pig." I say, riasing an eyebrow at her and casting her a crooked grin while she just shrugs back at me.
"Dean please!" He whines, a tear slipping out onto his cheek at the desperation of pléasure that I wasn't giving him.
"Put on your armour Dean, Angels have been spotted not far from here. We are going to hunt them down." Growled my father, flinging my heavy armour at me. I caught it quickly and clicked one of the maids to get it on me. As I was getting fitted up for it my father filled me in on what was happening.
"YOUR MAJESTY!" A voice shouted from the doorway and I swung around to find one of my advisors stood there.
“If you don’t tell me, I’ll send you to the dungeons.” I tell him grimly and he shrugs.
"You have a beautiful name, my dearest one." I say and she smiles shyly and blushes down at the ground, letting her long black curly hair fall in front of her face. "My name is Castiel." She looks up at me quickly, her eyes wide in shock and her lips parted slightly before they break into a huge smile.
“Gabriel, let me stay with you! Please, I don’t want to go back to the demons. I want to know what it was like for my mother growing up, how she used to deal with things and how she used to play and learn.” He pleaded and Gabriel sighed and looked at me.
“Dean…” I say without thinking
Leliel (POV)
“Shut up Castiel.” He murmurs and places his head into the crook of my neck where he begins sucking and biting. I groan at the touch and lean backwards, about to fall over due to my knees going weak but Dean’s strong arms are keeping me up. His hand travels down my back and cups my ass, massaging slightly which makes me moan again. He lets go of me and I look at him all hot and flustered while he just grins down at me. “Knew I could make you shut up.”
“You, what?” I ask him stupidly and he gives me the best bitch face I had ever seen in my life.
"Whatever, just... Go away."
"Shut your mouth and your eyes." He commands. I rolls my eyes but shut them anyway, hearing him rummaging around and making weird grunting noises. "Okay, open them now."
“How can you love me when we haven’t seen each other in five years Dean? You’re a damned liar, a demon, I could never love something like you.”
"You're face is brighter tha-"
“I don’t think he is.” Castiel says moodily and the woman laughs.
I had just put Valentina down for her nap when I heard it. There was a tapping noise in my walls so I quickly decided to hide, ready to pounce on the assassin that came into my room. The tapestry ripped open as a demon all in black stalked out of it and rolled towards the cot. He got out a long blade and looked down at baby girl, his eyes black as night. I quickly hurried out of my hiding place and in one quick movement I severed his head from his body with my own long blade, it falling to the floor and rolling off slightly. I picked up Valentina who had sensed the presence of the demon and begun crying and cradled her in my arm before picking up the head with my other hand. I carried both the baby and the head down the halls and towards the great hall were all my courtiers were placed. I slammed open the door and held the head up in front of everyone, fury fuming in my eyes.
"Shit, Cas." I gasp, "do that again" he does it again, and again and then I start to move with him so we are now thrústing onto each other without any rhythm whatsoever. I start going a bit faster, plúnging my self intó him and bring my hand that is gripping his waist around to his cóck and start rúbbing it up and down in time with my thrústs. I feel myself swáating, my hormónes completely taking over my body and I qúicken my pace even more, still grípping his hair tightly. I feel him clénch around me and I cry out at the same time he does when I hit his prostate a few final times. We both begin to ridé out our orgásms together and I finally let go of his hair, letting it drop down to the floor as I gently púll myself óut of him.
"Happy birthday baby girl." He says, walking over to his desk and picking up a present that was wrapped in paper. He hands it to me and I rip it open before looking at the velvet box.
“REALLY? But you look so young!” I say in awe, looking at him in wonder.
“You need to…?” He drags out the word sarcastically and I shrug my shoulders.
"I'm sorry Cas." I mumble into his neck.
"Because she looks like her mother." I lie smoothly, not looking back up at him but instead getting baby girl out of her cot and rocking her gently backwards and forwards. "I would like you to go downstairs to the slaves and collect a woman slave names Amelia. Now Azazel." I add when he just stands there looking dumbfounded. He scurried off and while he is away and change baby girls nappy which is already getting easier even though it still stinks and carry on rocking her backwards and forwards. Azazel soon come back with Amelia and I give her pointed look and she nods.
"That's good, okay then. Why not just believe us that this once we will do as we say we will." I ponder this for a second and nod.
“Sorry.” He mumbles and I smile in triumph before starting to climb off of him but he grab hold of my hips and pulls me back down. “You’re not going anywhere.”
“Do you know her name? I always wonder why us demons never get to know the names of the angels. They could be important.” She smiles kindly at me and I return her smile.
"Oh indeed it is. You see, Dean Winchester has a soft spot for angels. Both him and his brother treat them in a strange manner that contrasts with how other demons treat us. I think that when he becomes king, there could be a catalyst event in this war." I look out onto the view and think about the demon that had said he loved me. I had said it back and I had meant every word of it when I said it but I didn't know whether I said that because I hoped that he would let me out or because I didn't want him to hate me for what I was about to tell him; that I was king of the angels.
“Y-you’re an angel.” He stammered and I nod, smiling slightly.
"I've missed you too."
However every 18 years for the past thousands of years gone by, Dean sees a little black haired, blue eyed girl in a red cloak somewhere around the city and his heart breaks all over again down to Lucifer’s curse he set upon the two beings. It takes Dean many months to get back on track again and to become happy with a little help from his moose brother but he knew that every 18 years, this will all happen all over again.
"Valentina."
I had bathed and i had shaved and right now i was pacing my study, almost pulling my hair out in frustration of waiting for my stupid brother to return with my stupid not-so-much lover. I heard footsteps slowly tap tap tap up the stairs and my breathing hitched as i tried to be somewhat cool about the whole situation, leaning against the doorframe and looking at my study door that was so closed to opening. I bit my lip seductively but i decided against that as i probably looked like a tool. The door was opening slolwy and i honestly didn't know what to do with myself. Oh my God, i was so nervous.
“You’re going to be the death of me.” He grips my hips tightly and I can tell he’s close to coming in his leggings. I start palming him roughly instead and he shouts out in pure pleasure. Suddenly my hands are beginning to get wet as his cum in coming through his leggings, leaving a patch near his groin. I let go of him but stay straddled to his hips.
"Me too Dean." I close my eyes. "Me too."
"I-i'm gonna-" I start but he cuts me off by kissing my roughly, making my lips swollén. My bódy starts shakíng violently before i finally start comíng over both our chésts with no mercy or control. I cry out in a long and suggestive móan until he ejéculates insíde of me, still keeping up his thrustíng motion as we slíp into our come down. All you can hear is out hot and heavy breaths and stícky soungs from where he is slowíng his híps down before finally pullíng out and collápsing on tóp of my swéaty body.
"You're a bit young for that little red."
A knock at my door woke me from my slumber and I got up too see who it was after rubbing the sleep out of my eyes. I yawned as I padded bare feet towards the door and opened it to find Sam stood outside. I looked at him in shock before looking down the hallways to see if anyone saw him.
"And how have i done that may i ask?"
"POPS? DAD?" There was a shout from outside the door and Valentina came walking in. I couldn't even look up in shock but Dean quickly pulled out of me and covered out bodies with the sheets. There was silence and then i heard laughter coming from Valentina.
“Leliel died? How?” I ask but he shakes his head.
“Wow the security in this place is fabulous.” I say sarcastically and he rolls his eyes.
"No, i need to give you my present." I tell her and she squeals excitedly.
"I don't know," I shrug. "It was just a kiss." She pouts her lip moodily and shakes her head at me.
"Away, but I'm back now." I reply to her, looking down into her light grey eyes.
"Of course your majesty." She bows again and I open the door for her to leave my chambers. When she is gone I thank Lucifer that angels don't try and get involved in other people's business because I don't know what I would have told her if she asks me where I really got the baby from. No one must know that I actually found her, no one at all.
"No Dean, I'm not being a child I'm just saying the truth. I don't like being a demon. Violence, hate and pain is all we are meant to feel but I don't feel that. I feel happiness and love and an angel made me find these feelings-" his eyes flickered to gabriel. "-I don't care if they lock me up in chains and stick me in the dungeon, as long as I don't have to be a demon bastard anymore!"
“What?”
"Yes she can." I say firmly and Sam shakes his head.
"Hm." I mumble tiredly, trying to turn my back on him but he catches my waist and turns me towards him instead.
"The ladies of the court are taking my friend!" He complains.
"I know."
“SHUT UP! I DO HAVE A SAY IN THIS!” I shout, “IF YOU LEAVE WITH HER I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND TAKE HER FROM YOU.” With that I storm out of my study, leaving Leliel alone with her thoughts. I storm down into my chambers and collapse onto the bed when I get there.
“I’ve missed you too.” Castiel replied back, smiling sadly and noticing that Dean’s delicate fingers were still holding onto his chin.
“Get away from me. I have taken Valentina, she is back at the angel kingdom.” He gasps and his lips tremble as tears begin to fall from his eyes.
I'm going to ignore that happened. She will probably be back tomorrow, blushing like a disgusting rose. I know what to do. I'm going to poke fun at her for it. With a wave of my hand, bright red roses bloom around the tree stump that i normally sit at and i smirk to myself and nod my head. Now i can say that her face looks redder than these roses when she comes next.
“Why is that good?” Castiel asked, curiosity getting the better of him.
Good bye my Valentina, I loved you with all my heart. You were too young to die, and now you have slipped out of my hands forever. Good bye my Valentina, good bye my beautiful little girl. You will forever be in my heart and thoughts. Good bye.
“That’s okay, I would like to be alone for a while.” I started riding off out of the castle gates all the while thinking thoughts of Castiel and how I probably would never see him again. My heart ached as I rode but I hoped all the same that he would be happy with his wife and child. If Castiel and himself ever did meet again it would probably be a fight-to-the-death situation and this made me feel down in the weather. I rode across the grassy hilltops and down a long river where the water was glistening in the morning sun. I stopped at the river for a while and breathed in the morning crisp air, looking around me at the beauty. I had learned to take in the beauty of the land, well Castiel had taught me how to do it when we sat at my window and looked out at the kingdom either at the sunrise or the sunset. I smiled at the memories of me and him together but quickly became serious when I heard a very particular noise. It was quite faint so I shrugged it off and went back to looking at the sun. However the sound came again and it was a bit clearer this time, it sounded a bit like a baby’s cry. My eyebrows burrowed slightly as I looked around me, wondering where on this earth could the sound be coming from. I looked around and carried on down the river a bit until I came to a handmade basket where the sounds were coming from.
"How is she doing?" I ask Amelia worriedly and she turns to smile at me.
A small part of me, a very small part, hoped that maybe Castiel would come to his sense. That he would see how much I loved his daughter and would remember how much I loved him. Maybe, just maybe, Cas, Val and I could just run away and be together. I didn't want to rule this kingdom anymore and Sam could easily run it more smoothly then I ever could have. I wasn't cut out to be a king; I was cut out to be a father, and a lover. I knew that Castiel would probably try and kill me as soon as I stepped into the Angel Kingdom but I couldn't stay cooped up in my castle, always wondering whether he would let me see her or not. The years of no communication had put up a blockade on mine and Castiel's relationship but that didn't mean that I still didn't love him, and maybe, just maybe he may still love me with the part of him that wasn't still angry at me for apparently killing his wife and kidnapping his daughter.
"Sorry kid." Was all he said before looking up to where Castiel was perched next to a broken glass stained window high above the great hall. He lurched upwards and a pair of bright golden wings suddenly appeared out of his back, flapping strongly to reach up towards his brother. Gabriel went straight through the window but Castiel remained sat calmly on the edge of it, one leg up on the side and one leg dangling down.
“This is going to hurt Cas.” He says to me as I stand there in front of him. I nod silently and shut my eyes, waiting for the red hot burning sensation of his brand. He places his hand on my chest and I inhale deeply, waiting for the pain to come. I can feel it tingling and suddenly I smell smoke and burning flesh. My own flesh felt like it was on fire and through my tightly shut eyes, a flash of light broke through my eyelids and the pain was unreal. I cried out, loudly and almost collapsed there and then but Dean held me up. Suddenly it was all over but the pain of the brand was still searing through my body. Dean took his hand away and I fell forwards, feeling weak and hurt. Dean caught me and held me in a tight hug before picking me up and carrying me back towards the bed where we had both woken up this morning. I’m groaning in pain but my eyes flutter open, tears springing to him as I try and gasp for air.
“Yes, I suppose she was.” I looked back at her and she was talking to some of the warriors about their adventures.
"So she's definitely yours?"
"Don't touch me." I grumble moodily but he does any way and comes to me closer, putting his legs on either side of my own legs and kissed me gently and sweetly.
"That sounds like it would hurt. How about you just go to the one you want to go too... More, and tell a maid to tell the other one that the another had summoned you?"
"We have to go." I whisper quickly in Dean's ear and he jumps slightly before looking at me in confusion.
"That's what i'm doing little bird." He tells me and i can hear the grin dripping from his voice. He keeps going agonisingly slow and i claw at the bedsheets and bite the pillow, moaning softly. Once all the way in, he stills for a moment to let me get used to him even though i was used to him, i've been used to him for over 15 years now, actually it was more closer to 20 or 25 years seen as i knew him and had fucked him long before Valentina was born.
Every once in a while you got a rogue demon that gets too big for their boots and starts to kill people but they are most always caught by the angels and put to sleep, either that or booted off earth all together.
“This is Valentina. She is Leliel’s daughter, Gabriel.” He gave them a pointed look that I didn’t understand and their mouths dropped in surprise as they looked at me.
I wasn’t worried for my life, I was worried for my daughter’s life. I just wanted to love and protect her and I was sincerely regretting leaving the castle so close to my due date. My daughter was coming into the world this night and I had no one here to help me. I had to help myself; I had to do the whole process by myself. I would be strong about it; I wouldn’t let something as simple as childbirth break me. I had fought wars, I had led armies and I had been married to an idiot. I could do this. I kept telling myself this over and over again throughout the whole process. It hurt so badly and I was so damn worried for my little girl that is almost killed me.
Okay, on with the story…
"However..."
"Please can we go to the woods Marian?" I please my nurse as she pours another drink and rolls her eyes. "Please please please!" I give her my best Uncle Sammy look puppy doggy look and she gulps down her drink before picking up the bottle and wrapping it in brown paper.
"How did you-"
“Oh my goodness.” I gasp and the beautiful figure smiled at me. “What is a mermaid doing in a lake?” I ask her and he just shrugs before coming up the bank and resting his elbows onto it as she puts her chin in her hands. “Is there more of you?”
"My name is Amelia your majesty and I would be happy to help." With that she turns to take her baby back off Sam who is tightly pulling at his hair and walking out of the chambers, curtseying slightly as she went.
"I'm eight summers old! And you look no older yourself." I object and pout slighty at him while he just smirks.
"Yes alright! I don't know how to seduce you! I've never done this type of thing before!" He snaps and then a glimmer of sadness and hopelessness fills his eyes.
Yes but look at him! He’s bootylicious (I don’t even care that they wouldn’t say this in the middle-ages, screw you all) and handsome and tall.
"Thank you blessed God!" She cried when she saw who grabbed her and I hugged her tightly before stabbing someone behind her. "Castiel, I have something to tell you-"
"What did you get from your dads?" I ask and she shakes her head.
"How am i meant to experience the world if you won't let me do things on my own?" I explain and he raises an eyebrow.
"Why would you want to help me?" I ask sceptically and he shrugs, smiling grimly.
"She could be a very powerful little angel." He says before disappearing right in front of our very eyes. Dean finally let's out a breath of air that he probably didn't know he was holding and looks at me.
“Shut up Castiel.”
"Valentina?" My fathers asked as i came running into the house, tears pouring down my face and straight up to my room. I hear them running up the stairs to my room and bursting in, approaching the bed slowly.
“Unless?” He turns around to face me slowly with a fiery gaze and a sad sneer. “Unless I actually am you mean?”
"Oh it is. I get to talk to the animals and the trees. I've seen all manners of creatures and the sights when i climb mountains are wonderful. Everyday is an adventure." I sigh in longing and sit down on the grass a few feet in front of him.
"Marry me." I say quickly, looking into her eyes and suddenly she smiles so brightly that it almost blinds me.
"Angels are meant to do what they're told. If he is telling you to be friends with him than that is what you should do." I say suddenly and they both jump up quickly, looking around in shock.
“Your highness.” He corrected, still not looking up at me and I chuckled low.
"Victoria."
“I was only joking. I know you’re not a sex slave.” I explain but his back just stiffens and he stays quiet. “Unless…”
It was me that sent the troll on to kill Leliel, however when she battled it and succeeded over it I grew angry at the troll and dragged it's body away to shred it up and send it to it's own stinking family. However I did go back to check on Leliel and to my surprise she had given birth to the child I so hoped I would kill. I tried waiting until the right moment to grab the baby and run, so I went back to my men, ordering them around for a while. When I went back I had found Leliel dead and one of my men informed me that king Castiel was on his way. I didn't want to be around for that so I decided to look for the child instead. However when I got to the place where Leliel had given birth to the child, it was no where in sight.
“Oh but I did.”
"What do you mean Angels have been spotted?" I asked him.
“I do not know who Lucifer is.” The mermaid giggles slightly and i smile at her.
"No helping." I grit my teeth again and go back to looking at the doors. I didn't actually know what Prince Dean wanted whereas I knew exactly what the king wanted and he had told me that I was "going to get it tonight" when he had caught me shoving jewels into his throne. Yep, I had made my choice. Dean it was. I turned on my heel and walked towards Prince Deans doors and the guard at his door whooped.
He decided against it.
"Val's a tough cookie, i'm sure she'll survive." Dean snorts and i roll my eyes.
“Hello!” I say enthusiastically and he raised an eyebrow slightly.
"You hear me Cas?" He asks loudly and i groan and nod my head but don't open my eyes. He laughs lightly and kisses my face a bunch of times to wake me up a little but it didn't work. However when he kissed the lids of my eyes softly, they flickered open and blue met green like they had done so many times before.
He walked towards him and put his arms around him, wrapping his ex-lover in a tight embrace, feeling the warmth and the not-so-familiarity of his body again. They both smelled the same after so many years and they both felt the same, the same hug, the same love shared between them, the only thing that was different was neither of them knew what they were going to do when the hug finally ended.
"No, she was an angel." I say and their mouths drop open. I look around the hall at the other angels who all look just as shocked and horrified at the Winchester brothers. "Sam and Dean Winchester are half angel and half demon. That means that they are half one of us, you will not touch a single hair on their heads until we find out what to do with them."
“Didn’t I tell you too shut up?”
Dean breathed out heavily and bit his lip, looking down at Castiel with passion, longing and desire while slowly stroking a hand through Castiel’s thick chocolate brown hair. Castiel smiled up at him in love before looking at Dean’s growing bulge that was restricted by his boxers and opening his mouth, mouthing at the fabric sending heat waves through Dean who gripped Castiel’s hair tight.
"Cause Cassie, we are fúcked up. On the other hand, that was some amazing sex." He crawled slowly over me, grinning before nipping at my ear slightly. I hum in agreement and lean my head against the head board casually. "Say, how much stamina do angels and demons have?"
“THEN LET THEM KILL ME!” I shout, making people look at us. I lower my voice once again to whisper to him. “If I can’t have you then I would rather be dead!”
"I'm going to melt it down and make chains. I'm going to capture those cursed angels and make them our slaves." He then laughs loudly and his demon warriors laugh along with him before getting back on their horses and riding off into the night.
"They're beautiful!" She exclaims and i frown, looking around at the roses and than back to her. I open my mouth up to speak against but once again, she cuts me off. "How did you know roses were my favourite flower? And they're red too! Oh Luce!" She exclaims, plopping herself down by one of the flower beds and smelling the roses, smiling broadly.
"Dean wake up! Wake up!" My little brother was jumping on my bed trying to wake me up from a hard night of boring meetings and studying that my father made me do. I groaned and sat up in my queen sized bed, rubbing my eyes tiredly.
"That's... Worrying." I mumble and he nods before standing up.
“What for?”
“A Gabriel of the angels here to see you sire.” A guard comes in and says formally. Apparently the war was called off two years ago but I never did find out the reason why. Nowadays I was just focused on running my kingdom and keeping my demons as happy as possible. I hadn’t met an angel since Castiel left!
"Wait!" I shout and he turns around and looks at me in confusion. "Aren't you going to see Sam?" I ask him and he sighs before shrugging and nodding his head.
“Aren’t you a little cutie pie.” I say to her and she gurgles slightly. I smile broadly at the little girl but bite my lip hard, scolding myself for being so intrigued in this little girl. I look back at my Impala and shrug before taking the baby over to her and letting the horse sniff the girl. “What do you think Impala, should we wait around to see if the mother or father turns up?” I ask my mute horse and decided that this would be the best idea. I would wait here for a couple of hours.
"Dean." He says abruptly and he stand away from him slightly, looking at him apologetically. "I swear if you say sorry one more time i'm going to shove this flower up your ass."
“We don’t have enough men, sire. They have brought the women angels in and also there is more angels coming in from the south. We have to pull out and start making more angels blades before we carry on fighting.” One of my advisors told me and Crowley. Crowley looked at me sceptically and I bit my lip.
“Like what?” I ask again, a bit more demanding this time.
"I told you that you would pay King Johnathan and now you will. Why don't you tell your boys who their mother really was? To think I found out by just observing them both, it was very clear to see where their hearts truly lie." His words didn't make sense to me so I looked at my father and saw fear and shame written plainly across his face. With a cruel laugh, Castiel jumped off the ledge and with my heart in my mouth he swooped up just before he hit the floor and went smashing dramatically out of the window, making the glass fall towards the ground.
They strung up a man, they said who murdered three
“Aw hell no.” I say, holding the sleeve of my tunic to my mouth a nose before flinging the rags away from the baby and wiping her bum with a spare one. “You are disgusting.” I tell the little girl but still she hadn’t stopped crying. I wrap her in some dry, clean rags from my own saddle and finally take my hand away from my mouth. “Why are you still crying?” I ask her but she just screams ever louder. “How for something so little do you have such a loud voice? Shut up.”
“Where?”
"Sir, what will you do with the star?" One of his men bowed and Crowley grinned at him,
"Yes, your highness."
"Lucifer." I whisper and he nods solemnly.
Castiel is smiling slightly, looking at the berry bush that I had eaten from on that day and turns to look at me slowly before sighing.
"Yes." Sam says sadly, nodding his head.
He gave me his bath?! He gave me his bath! I looked at the hot steamy water and shivered with pleasure at the thought of being clean for the first time in six months. I stripped off my only garment of clothing and quickly got in it, ignoring the pain of how hot it was and just enjoying the fact that I was going to be clean! However my mind drifted to Dean, why would he give me his bath when he himself was dirty?
"Name her? Why should we name her? We can just call her baby girl." I say, cooing at the curly black haired beauty in her sleep.
"Castiel, his highness wishes to see you, prince Dean I mean."
"I've missed you my Queen." I say, leaning down to kiss her.
“You will get angry…”
"I see my dads do this, one of them gets close to the other and waits for the other to lean in. So just do it."
The reason why I had told Castiel I would help him was because his daughters disappearance was just as much a mystery to me then it was too Castiel. I wanted to actually find out who had taken the kings daughter, I wanted to congratulate them on their bravery and faithfulness to the demon kind but I also wanted to kill them for not bring the child to me. The demon would now not stand a chance with both mine and Castiel's army on his back.
"I go out their to think. You're lucky you caught me before I jumped off and started flying." I start pouring two glasses of whiskey and hand him one when I have done. He takes hit with a nod in thanks and sips it, smacking his lips together and licking them. "I'm sorry about my advisors, I hope they didn't rough you up too much."
“I’m the king, Leliel. I have to go.” I say before jumping on my horse. She tries dragging me back down but I grab her wrists and tear her off me, looking at her sternly.
"This might sting a bit." I said honestly but he didn't looked like he cared as his eyes were now shut tightly and his fingers were holding firmly onto the bed sheets. I shrugged and finally slipped a finger into him which was easy enough because it was only one finger. He gasped and stiffened up slightly but I told him to relax as I started sliding said finger in and out of him, opening up his whole little by little. I curved it slightly and he moaned as it rubbed against his walls so I thought that now was a good time to add a second finger. I did this one a bit gently as I was basically ripping his hole open for my own untouched erection to go in and he gritted his teeth in slight pain. I ignored his whimpers and carried on sliding the second finger in along with the first and when it was all the way in I started to scissor my fingers slightly to open his hole. He gasped and shivered but his whimpering were subsiding as he was getting used to the uncomfortable feeling and starting to enjoy himself. I twisted my fingers around him and then started sliding them in an out of him a bit harder then I intended to which causes him to yelp and cry out but I had suddenly managed to brush against his prostate which caused all noises of complaint and pain to cease altogether.
"We will bury her." He says, his voice catching slightly as he tries to gulp the lump in his throat down. I nod my head reluctantly and grab two branches, turning them into wooden spades.
I put a curse on you now and forever more. Every 18 years from now you will see a child. A child in a coat as red as blood. A child with eyes bluer than the sky, a child who's hair is as dark as coal and you will recognise her as your own. But you will never be able to get to her. You will never be able to speak to her and you will never be able to touch her.
"Don't we have enough slaves’ father?" I sigh and he glares at me.
"I get it. I understand. I don't resent you for it i promise that because perhaps i should have taken you up on your offer a long time ago." He pushes his food away from him and gets up to walk over to me and behind me, pressing a kiss to my cheek and hugging my from behind.
“I know.” He says simply, nodding his head and I gulp down a fresh set of tears, wanting to appear strong and reluctant to give up on him. “Can I hear her again?” He asks me, looking at me stomach and I look at him in shock before looking down at my bump.
I ride for days and days until I reach the edge of the woods in which I loved so much. Rather then riding in, I hopped off of my horse and walked steadily into the woods; admiring the trees and the flowers as I walked, the snow that had set on them looked perfect. I see the lake that I had seen oh so long ago and walk towards the bank, looking in. The water was not cold enough for it to have been freezed and I hoped for the mermaid, I forget her name now, to come up to the bank and greet me but all I get is silence back. I sigh and sit down, running my finger along the water which sends ripples along the surface. Suddenly I get this overwhelming sensation inside me, something that makes me want to keep moving further into the woods. I get up but my feet don't move, as if they are afraid of what is in these woods. I gasp as the feeling gets stronger, something or someone is drawing me towards them so I clutch to the hilt of my sword which is places firmly in it's sheaf and descend further into the woods carefully, looking around suspiciously in case anyone jumps out at me. I get closer to the border and look around, leaning against the stone wall that separates my kingdom from Dean's. My heart tugs again, telling me to walk along the border, towards something that I had no idea what. I run my hand along the cold wall as I walk slowly towards my destination, keeping one hand on the hilt of my sword at all times.
"Do you like him?"
"I can't wait until i stop aging. No more growing pains." She says, sighing contently.
"Oh don't tell me, you're a servant for the lord." She asks, giggling slightly and i shrug and nod my head. That will do. "What are demons like then?"
"D-Dean? What are you-?" I hushed him and bent down to kiss his forehead gently before grinning at him.
"Who is your father?" I ask her but before she can answer someone calls her name in the distance. She looks behind her and sighs before looking back at me.
"What slave were you?" She asked, turning around abruptly to face me.
"Yes. Yes of course i will!" She cries and flings her arms around my neck. We stay like this for a minute or two before i pull away and she looks at me seriously.
“Please Cas, just move your hips again.” He begs, throwing his head back and tightening his jaw.
"Oh indeed! I am ever so curious about the angels. Will you come again?"
"I can't do that Valentina." I tell her.
I wasn’t in love with her.
"SHUT UP!" I shout at them and they both turn to me apologetically and shut their mouths. "Everyone else is bickering and I don't need it from you!"
"I find that very offensive angel scum."
“Don’t worry.” I find myself saying. “Everything will be okay.”
"Dean, that's what an illegitimate child is. A bastard. I'm not insulting her!" He defends himself as I glare at him for calling baby girl a bastard. "So that also means that people are going to try and kill her."
"Eh? Oh erm, Leliel this is Dean Winchester." She turns around quickly and backs away from Dean, eyes wide in horror. "It's okay Leliel."
I ran back down from the study and went up to everyone asking if they had seen her. Where was she? She couldn’t have actually ran away with our child, she couldn’t do that. I was frantic as I looked about the castle, searching for my wife. Two hours later and I was hopping onto a horse and riding down fast towards where I knew Leliel would be going. She wouldn’t go to the demons and she wouldn’t stay with the angels so the only place she could find refuge with is in fact the humans. She would be going to the human cities down in the south and that is where I planned on looking.
"That's a good idea." He says seriously I roll my eyes at him.
“Fine, but only because you asked so nicely.” He says, the sarcasm coming back into his voice.
“Good, you wouldn’t want to meet him.” He hold out her hand and a fairy flutters onto it, making me smile.
No Dean, he isn’t yours. He was married long before he met you probably.
“We are expecting the demon army to march again at noon, sire.” Michael says, bowing to me as I walk up to them. I nod my head and look at some official documents before I was interrupted by a guard.
I toss and turn in my bed that night and finally decide to get up and walk around after not being able to sleep. I stand at the edge of the camp, looking down into the valley where the angels are and wondering if I would be able to get into the camp. It was worth a try and I don't believe that Cas would kill me if I got caught. I slip on a deep black clock to stop myself being seen and put up the hood to keep my head down low as I start walking around the camp and through a different way where I knew less angels would be on guard. When I got there I saw two angel guards talking to each other quietly and smoking on some tobacco, not even looking in the direction of the dark field ahead. I slip past them easily and try and act natural as I walk through the camp. They say that those who look sneaky get caught, those who look obvious don't. I look around for the biggest and most beautiful tent, knowing that Castiel would be in that one as he always love beautiful things.
"Yes. That would be best. Also come back up with the others as soon as my son's ball ends." I gulped and nodded my head at the king before walking quickly out of the room. As soon as I was out I let out a huge breath of relief which I didn't know I was holding before I realised that I had left all the stuff back in his room. I let out a groan and looked at the guards on the door who was looking at me expectantly.
"How do you know she is in fact yours, Sire?" Azazel says sceptically.
"It's good to have you back sire, anything new from the demons?"
"Don't act like you don't know darling," I chuckle at him and he blushes a bright shade of red. "You know, you could have told me that she was an angel."
“Gabe is easier to say.” I smile and he rolls his eyes at me.
"Yeah, I don't know how to get her to shut up." I say as he walks over to me and looks down at the little girl in the crib.
"Frightened? I'm not frightened Castiel, i'm wary. And know him like you know him? Isn't he the one that made you .... be his slave." She spat, glaring at Dean who was whistling and looking around the room awkwardly at the whole situation. I kept hold of a laugh that wanted to get out at how he was acting and looked back down at my small wife.
"Of course not your highness, come sit by me." I took a seat next to her and smiled in kindness at her bubbliness. The jester bowed to me and muttered out his highnesses before carrying on with his act that was actually very funny. He told a joke about not being able to do his actual magic tricks a we took away his magic and I laughed so hard that we had to excuse him from our presence. Anael waved her ladies away and turned to me when I finally stopped laughing.
I hopped off my horse and decided to walk for a bit, knowing that I would have caught up with her by now. She was pregnant and couldn’t ride that far and that fast in only one week. I was cut off from my thoughts when I saw a figure in the water, stuck on a rock so they couldn’t move. I approached the figure cautiously only to notice that they weren’t moving at all. Blood was trailing from the figure down the river and I ran over to them and choked back a sob. My wife was laying face down in the water, a rock stopping her movements as blood filled the river around her. I pulled her out of the water and noticed that she was pale, he mouth parted and her eyes closed. My wife was dead and seemed to have been dead for maybe a whole day. I cried and cried into her, holding her wet body close to mine. I looked down at her stomach but noticed that it wasn’t round anymore but more flattened out. I stopped sobbing, tears still streaming down my face but looked in the water for any sign of my child. I couldn’t see her, I couldn’t see any sign, no cry, no bundle of rags, nothing that showed any sign of her. I looked back down at Leliel and gulped, resting her on the grassy bank gently.
"Oh..." We both go silent for a minute, both looking at everything and anything but each other until Dean finally breaks the silence.
"He has heard about one of his followers running away with the angel king. It will not take him long to find you Castiel and when he does I dread to think what he will try to do." God warns and I nod my head frantically. "However, I'm not only here to be the bearer of bad news."
“But Dean…”
"I told you not to call me little red anymore Luce." I scold him and he shrugs and grins again.
“Do it, but then you’re going to have to tell them why you sent me to the dungeons and I don’t think you want people to know about you letting those angels go.” I growl at his comment and he glares at me, pouting slightly.
“Is that why we live here now? Because you’re both my daddy’s.” I smile at her and nod my head, that was the easiest way to explain it and it came from her mouth. “I have two daddies?” She asks and smiles brightly so I nod my head again.
I had spent months and months looking for that child so I could slaughter it but I found nothing, not a single trace of that snot nosed little baby anywhere. Then I found out that Castiel was tracking the person that took his child and I knew for a fact that I needed to get away so he wouldn't find me snooping around and get suspicious.
“Let’s go. Away from here Cas, away from this whole split kingdom bullshit. Gabriel can run the angel kingdom brilliantly and Sam can run the demon one. Me, you and Valentina can just run away and get a house in the forest or something. I know this may sound corny and crazy but can we at least try. I’ve spent every day for the past 5 years thinking about how things would be so much easier if we were together and didn’t have separate kingdoms to run. I know you are probably going to say no but you can’t help me for trying. I love Valentina like she was my own child and I love you more than my heart can bare. I have never stopped loving you Castiel and nor will I ever.” We both slip into silence as he just stared at me with his mouth parted open slightly and his eyes wide at my small outburst of emotion. I sigh and turn away from him towards the large window and look out at the view that looks so fantastically beautiful showing a big wide word out there and I can’t help but let my heart reach out towards it. “I understand if you say no Castiel, because me out of all people understand that you have a kingdom to rule here but don’t you just sometimes get sick and tired of the same shit on a different day? Don’t you get sick of the ‘majesties’ and the royal courts and people looking for your advice. We are only one person and people expect us to be all knowing.”
I walked down the paved streets of New York City, watching and hearing all the loud cars go by and the bustling people bump into each other or greet each other. He was mesmerized by how much had changed in thousands of years. Rather than angels and demons ruling earth, now humans did. Who would have guessed? They were always such background characters and now they were the most important beings on earth.
"No Dean! I want him to be friends with me because he wants to, not because he had to." Samuel argued and I rolled my eyes. "Look, just because you don't believe they have thoughts and feelings doesn't mean that I think that as well! I don't know why you have so much against angels, it's not as if they are going to overthrow us. We have taken everything off them."
“What manner of demon art thou?” I shrug and he shakes his head in disbelief. “I never thought I’d meet a good demon. Especially not a demon prince.” Before I can argue about being ‘good’ he disappears around the corner with his sisters. It reminded me of what Cas had said about me being ‘kind.’ Maybe I was turning soft; it’s just that I didn’t see the point of capturing more angels especially when they weren’t exactly important or powerful. I could have easily captured them or tortured them but why would I? What was the point? I sighed and travelled down the alleyway myself to go back to the horse. I got on her saddle once again and rode her towards the city centre again where my father was going livid.
"It's fine Cas, I'm a bachelor again now and that's the way I like it. Now I can do this." I move onto him, straddling his hips and leaning down to kiss him gently, letting my tongue slip into his mouth and rolling it around his own tongue greedily. He moans slightly into the kiss as I start grinding down on him and he holds onto my waist tightly as if to keep his balance.
"Good." She then tells me to go and tell everyone while she already starts making arrangements for it; what dress she is going to wear, how she will have her hair and what music will play. My smile drops once she is out of sight and even though this should be a happy occasion, the fact that I had just proposed to my future Queen, I felt as sad as if someone whom was close to me had just died and in way, I suppose they had.
“How did you even get into the castle without being seen?” I ask him and he shrugs casually.
"Oh yes it is your majesty." I retort back and he grins before finally disappearing out if the tent. I laugh again before walking out if my tent and towards the guard that was calling out too me. "What is it?"
"What, why?"
"Oh..." I can feel a blush creep up on my face when I looked at him and wondered why. I never blushed in front of him before so why now? His bright green eyes seemed like they were bearing right into my soul but I couldn't find the strength to look away from him. He smiled suddenly and rubbed my wet hair with his hand before getting up.
“You have no say in this.”
“What are you doing in here?”
"Well the kings the king!" Said one.
“Shut up Anael.” I say through gritted teeth and she just laughs while skipping along beside me.
“Not until we know this forest is safe baby girl. We need to look around it first and see what kind of creatures are here and how far away their lairs are. She sighs and nods before walking into her own bedroom and started unpacking her things and placing them gently on every shelf and nightstand she could find. I smile at her but suddenly Castiel collapses at my feet and I yelp and try to catch him. He bangs his head hard on the wooden floor so I pick him up quickly and take him to what will be our room when we unpack our things and lay him on the bed. “Cas?” I say quickly, my heart beating fast but it slows down when I realise he is breathing and must just have fainted from all the power and energy he had to use. Valentina came running into our room while I stood over him and pushed his hair out of his face and came over to me before holding my hand.
Night was quickly coming so we sent Valentina up to bed, tucking her in and wishing her goodnight before going back downstairs and sitting beside the glowing fire to warm us up. Somewhere along the lines me and Castiel got closer together until finally he ended up sitting comfortably on my lap and resting his head on my shoulder, slowly falling to sleep.
Half a day later and Gabriel dropped me back in the courtyard of my castle. I smile at him and he pats me on the back.
"And what was this angels name, princess?" He asks me in a soft voice and i huff.
"How did you even get her into the castle?" Sam whispered hurriedly as I rocked the baby back and forth. I had just sent for an angel slave that had just had a baby so the little girl could feed off her breast.
He looks over at Dean who has not gone a deathly pale, his eyes still as dark as a winters night. He let's go of my hand and walks up to Dean, looking at him and putting a hand over Deans eyes which made the blackness drip out of them and turned back into his bright green ones.
He sipped down the rest of his drink and pushed the cake away from him. Suddenly he didn’t have very much of an appetite, as beautifully nice as the cake actually was. Castiel stood up from his table, avoiding the business table as much as possible and walked into the toilets at the far end of the coffee shop. He went to business and just as he was washing his hands, the doors flung open.
"Yes!" She giggles and I smile back at her and bring my face to her, kissing her soft red lips gently.
"What is Cas?" He says informally and it makes me feel that slight bit better that I still had my brother at my side.
"Okay, but remember-"
"How's my baby girl?" I asked, cuddling her close as she wrapped her little arms around my neck.
"I DON'T CARE! KILL THEM ALL!" I scream at my advisors who had brought in demons for questioning. It had been two weeks since my daughter went missing and I was going crazier and crazier by the minute. I had almost every single angel in the kingdom out looking for her and I now had called on Crowley to let him know that I couldn't carry on with the war. My people weren't happy about it but I didn't really care to be honest because getting my daughter back was the single most important thing in my life right now.
