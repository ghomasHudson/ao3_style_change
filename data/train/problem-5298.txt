Cas nods.
They sit quietly for a time,

“A snail can sleep for three years,” Cas says.
“Should be a little more. I tend to produce more ejaculate that normal men, so you told me anyway, remember?”
On Dean's second to last night in town, the two had caused something of a sensation around downtown when they decided to go out drinking together.
“Then give it to him,” Sam offered. “We have an easy solution for once in our lives just sitting there, why don’t we just take it for once?”
"Yeah, yeah I got it," he confirmed. “Place I interned at during freshman year spring break taught me how to use it all.”
“Settle down, Dean. You three have had quite the adventure.”
“There’s more to the army than just that.”
His tongue felt stuck to the inside of his mouth. So not only would this be a massive flop, but it was going to be
They moved to the bedroom the three of them had been sleeping in, being sure to turn the key in the lock and keep Sam from accidentally coming in while they were in the middle of whatever was about to happen.
” His eyes were sad and Dean’s heart clenched with brief fear.
Dean started laughing again. “Nope! Not even close. We didn't even get to audition. Some douche shoved Sam over because he wanted to audition before us. Without really thinking about it, I yanked the twerp by the collar and told him to watch out where he put his hands, because if I ever so much as saw him look at my little brother again, I'd knock his lights out.
“Sammy, Sammy, Saaaaammmmyyyy,” Dean called.
Dean clenched his buttocks up, putting pressure on the four fingers Castiel still had in him. “You make me really happy.”
“You are truly magnificent,” Castiel told Dean with a happy sigh.
(which Dean took to mean replaced), by a young screen writer by the name of Kevin Tran, who supposedly had been apprenticing Chuck until recently.
“It is real. Everything about my grace tells me this is real.” Castiel had done extensive self-reflection. As his strength grew, he pawed at as much as the universe as he could, trying to figure out if there were holes that pointed to this all being a self-contained dream.
“No, no, nothing to apologize for.”
“Okay?”
“And you were kind of a workaholic.”
Sam licked his lips and could feel the coils of his own arousal build. Maybe he’d missed sucking a cock more than he’d realized.
“You’re the one who keeps,” Castiel swiveled his hips to just the right spot making both of them sigh happily, “who keeps bringing up my father.”
“You’ll like it out there, Sam. I’ve had a hard time leaving here lately. Dean’s done an incredible job.”
“Hello, Dean,” nine of the Castiels spoke as one.
territory?” Anna asked. “All this CGI to change the actors...”
Chuck was dead – thankfully dead – and Jack lost to them too.
“What were you watching when I came in?” asked Castiel, keeping his voice low and calm.
“Are you sure?”
“Wait,” Dean grunted.
“Processed, agreed! Now fuck me,” Dean said a bit agitated. He was never at his most polite while horny.
or anything else he claimed to get from the virtual world. He just looked dehydrated and confused to Castiel’s eyes.
Castiel made Sam feel safe. It was a genuine question, not a trick.
Sam pulled off with a pop. “You’re not a stranger anymore.”
“Yeah?”
“You write? That's cool, brother,” Benny chimed in.
“Ah... thanks.”
She looked over at Anna. “Anna, we're all so grateful to have you here.” There was a moment of enthusiastic clapping from the assembled group.
“What's the time?” he asked, having realized his one phone was dead.
, centauricorns, Dean, you need to get this into your head”, Dean could hear Bela correcting) side of things was shot.
Sitting in Jody's trailer at the end of their first week, the three of them commiserated each other.
A knock at the door was what finally made them stop. Breathing hard and plump lips red from being bitten and sucked, they separated.
Stepping back from where Dean was still bound to the tree, Castiel studied the unmarked side of Dean’s buttocks.
He’d had the frame of mind to let Dean know he wouldn’t be back last night. Dean’s reply had been a string of increasingly lewd emojis. Six egg plants seemed a little excessive.
“Dean,” Castiel shook Dean gently. “No really, you
Castiel used his two already inserted fingers to slowly loosen up Dean's hole.
“No, you’re perfect.”
“I said used to be. It was the old life, the old me.”
“That isn’t a regular thing for you? Potentially just stress, Sam. I wouldn’t be concerned,” Castiel brushed it off like it was nothing.
Castiel found himself lost a little as he watched Dean lick sugar dust off his fingers.
There was nowhere else for him to go, though. Sam and Castiel had created this place, his bar, as the only tenable option. This was where Dean had to be, while Sam and Castiel kept order. And that was just how it was going to be.
“Thank you for being honest with me, Dean. I appreciate it very much.”
“You want to know how I got the role?” he said suddenly.
“Yes?” Castiel paused, dirty coffee cup in hand, wondering what was so important Dean would come back when he was already running late.
“Are you still willing to do my yard work and clean my pool?” Castiel had to ask, had to be sure of Dean’s motivations.
“Definitely,” Castiel grinned. “Take more than that to affect my judgment, don't worry.”
Castiel swallowed. “I think I'd like that, Dean. Thank you.”
Dean groaned. “Lots of us were there for the dinner. It was a farewell from the studio to all the cast and crew, basically a wrap party.”
?” Came the shocked question from Anna.
“The cheese and green onion waffles are my favorite.” Garth stretched back and rubbed his stomach. “Though I wouldn’t say no to some more of those little cakes.”
“Me?” Dean scratched his head. “I'm not too sure yet. Still mulling things over, I guess.”
It was getting ridiculous how much pizza Castiel was ordering. His fridge had enough leftovers to make up another three pizzas at this point.
Dean shrugged. “I won't lie, it's true, I don't have to worry for a bit. My folks were good to me and Sam. They put every cent we made into a trust that we had access to only when we turned 18. Sam used the money to go off to college, bought himself a nice apartment in the city. I invested in some property.” He took a sip of his beer. “I guess because we never used the money before that, I kind of forget I have it? But it's true, I don't exactly have to think about these things.”
sport,” Benny said with fake shock.
“Oh. Would you like me to... leave?” Castiel asked stiffly, feeling like that was the end of things between him and Dean.
“It doesn’t really matter when I come back, whenever I come back will be the time I came back today.”
“Surely the film isn't going to be ready for another eight months at least?” Jody questioned, eyebrows drawn together in confusion. “The amount of post-effects you're going to have to do? Last film I worked on had nowhere near this amount of green screen and they were working for a year after principle photography finished.”
“I wanna. I wanna come home.”
“You can pretend I’m your best friend, if it helps?” Sam said quietly.
“Even if I don’t let you come?” It was clearly what Dean was angling for.
Dean smiled benevolently at her. “It is, yes.” He wasn’t going to deny it.
“This must be the least active you’ve ever been,” Dean chuckled. “Enjoying it?”
“No. Donna was the actress, she plays Missy in the film. Cas was the guy I was hanging out with.”
, was the reply on the tip of his tongue. All he knew was that he couldn’t have stayed here much longer. He didn’t have the energy to argue with Dean that
“Greetings! I'm Bela Talbot, and on behalf of Crossroads productions, I'd like to welcome you all. We're just
"Dean, you want to do my gardening as well?" Castiel had his phone on loudspeaker so he could eat breakfast while talking to Dean. It was practically second nature to him now to use the loudspeaker when the phone call involved Dean. He found it useful to ensure he had both hands free on such ocassions.
“You want me to hang around while you two get up to this all day? Come on, I don’t need that.”
Dean nodded his head.
I'm petitioning the studio to make a film about Sam Winchester as a centauricorn. Please click
Sam paused, wondering himself. What did he want?
Not when he was the one who had been dying, while they sat at his bedside grieving his weary bones.
“I’m... um,” sorry? But not really.
“We know,” Jody said with a roll of her eyes.
Dean was closing the space between them, tipping Castiel’s chin up and leaning down to kiss him.
,” the others corrected.
“I think it was sexy,” Cas told him, voice low. “Seeing you enjoy something so much? You get so lost in awe when you’re focused on something that pleases you. A doctor who is also into classic cars? Double hot.”
“It was my fault too, I should have made him leave it in the kitchen. I was just distracted by you being here and…”
“I was not,” Castiel tried to argue.
“Before you came along, I didn’t think anyone could ever make this feel as good as it does when I do it to myself.”
“They're a metaphor, a hybrid of all the animals and humans put in danger by our reckless destruction of the rain forests. Except now we can't use the Amazon because of trademark issues with
Castiel’s pinched Dean’s left butt cheek hard, hard enough that Dean hissed in discomfort.
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice was lower this time. He ran a finger down Dean’s spine, resting his palm on the base of Dean’s spine and enjoyed the sensation of his chest moving as he breathed.
“Yeah, no problem. The keys are on the table by the door.” The table that was destined for Goodwill since neither he nor Jess were attached to it. It was a strange feeling knowing that today would be the last day he’d see that table.
“Er, yeah.”
“We've got the best people in this cast, and I personally have never felt such a strong sense of camaraderie in before on a film set.”
my family?” Dean butted in. “Yes, yes I would.”

“Wow, oh wow. I thought living in this hippy city would have left you a little more enlightened than that. Life’s what you make of it, Sam. Be that kids or a weird seahorse fetish thing. That’s what Cas has always said.”
“Er…?” Sam shrugged. “Dinner for what?”
Castiel gently pulled out. He wiped the left over cum and lube on his cock onto his palm and used it to ease his way through working Dean to orgasm too. The dream world had certainly left Castiel with a lot of ideas Dean wouldn’t have thought Castiel could have ever of come up with.
“Donna, this guy here?” Benny pointed towards Castiel, “He doesn't follow
album?”
“Hiya Sammy.” He tried to inject his voice with a level of fake enthusiasm so Sam wouldn't know something was wrong.
“Oh. Oh fuck.” Dean leaned back against the sofa and placed his hands over his face. “Oh fucking fuck.”

“Isn't that... kind of the point?” Cas asked, out of breath and confused.
“That is oddly specific. Another kink of yours?” Castiel slowed his strokes on their cocks. He could tell from the way Dean was tensing things would be over soon if he didn’t.
Maybe they were arrogant, maybe they’d been through so much trauma that they just didn’t see barriers anymore, maybe they truly were all-powerful. But Sam was King of Hell and if that didn’t mean anything, if that didn’t prove they were more than they used to be, then what did? Maybe, just maybe, an angel, the King of Hell, some witches and a couple of hunters could find portals to enough alternative universes to convince some angels to come back with them, to help
“The Jones brothers were your characters in that movie series?” Castiel asked.
, he told Sam of Castiel's theory that Dean hadn't enjoyed the last film so much because it didn't feel like family. Because he'd been used to having family around him. That Cas thought a TV series might fix that.
“Yeah! Remember, we always wanted one as kids?”
He gently stroked the hair off Dean’s face and tucked it behind his ears. Dean’s hair had been so short a year ago when Castiel had first met him. Now it was long enough that it fell into his eyes a little…
Dean has died for Sam, given his soul to a Demon, a creature they had hated to save him. He was willing to do the trials in place of Sam, risking his own life. He took the Mark of Cain so he could kill Abaddon, not caring about the cost. He was going to put himself at the bottom of the sea to keep others safe from Michael, who he kept trapped in his own noggin.
But as they were leaving, the ground began to shake. Spikes broke the wooden floor boards of the small house they owned and then went back down, only to repeat with lava coming with them. The rift was starting to close, Chuck affecting Jack's abilities, so he pushed them in. Only, when they  turned around, the rift was gone and Jack wasn't there.
In the house, Jack had found another journal, kind of like a scrap book. It was from the first day they arrived there till today. Every memory they remembered from what happened on their Earth. Showing they were from a future Earth, but also giving insight on what's about to happen.
And ever since meeting each other, they changed. Sam saw it clearly as they were on the road and talking and being more like a family. Dean made Cas human and Castiel made Dean whole. Within their first encounters, Sam saw a difference in their 'profound bond'. Dean hated all Angels, but Cas was different. He always was and it made him such a good fit into his brothers life.
But Dean was more frightened to be without Castiel. Friend or something more, he couldn't lose him in his life. "C-Cas I-"
,” Dean chuckled. “Hearing you explain what was my life the last 12 years.”
“Goodnight, boys.” Mary kissed them each on the cheek, including Castiel, before she took to Dean’s spare room to sleep.
"Relative to my lifespan: new," Cas said with a roll of his eyes.
“Green,” he said without even a moment of hesitation.
Castiel shrugged. “What could I possibly offer that his virtual world doesn’t already?”
“It was an accident!” the older twin shot back.
“You run a restaurant?” Dean was surprised.
Castiel took a deep breath. “I know the studio are pushing my name like I'm some mysterious, only just discovered human being, who goes by mononym, but that's to hide the fact that my last name is Allen.”
Dean kissed Castiel’s head and put his breakfast stuff by the sink. “Deal.”
It wasn’t the most conventional moment to realize he was in love with Dean, Castiel reflected, but he wouldn’t change it for the world.
“So is a kink,” Castiel uttered softly. He stroked Dean’s hip with his thumb already calculating how much fluid he’d have to make Dean drink once he woke up to re-hydrate him. Lucky for Dean, taking care of a fucked-out sleepy Dean was Castiel’s favorite kink.
There was a difference between Castiel and Jess. Of course there would be, the physical, but also the emotional journey Sam was feeling. Things with Jess had been familiar. Castiel was anything but familiar. Sam’s eyes slipped down to Castiel’s cock.
Two hours and 19 minutes later the end credits started to roll.
“Well then I need you to not come so you can fuck me into oblivion after this shower. If that's good with you?”
“Feel free to help yourself to a drink, Dean. I’m just going to tuck them in.”
“Bubblegum pink?” Dean sounded very unsure of himself.
The poor reaper sent to get Dean was there for weeks while Sam and Castiel argued it out with Billie over Dean’s final resting place.
“Well, he was this big, strong, handsome soldier and he was so kind and sweet too. Made sense more than one girl had caught his eye. He had the ring, if it wasn’t me it was someone else.”
“Oh,” Castiel laughed. “Then I apologize, I probably shouldn't have just left it about after I changed. Someone probably mistook it for the studio's and hung it up.”
“No, I was just born there, but my parents moved on a few months later. They're artists, so we moved around a lot. They were always looking for inspiration to create new things.”
“Your brain wanted to,” Dean pouted and sat back on the couch, crossing his arms over his chest.
,” Kevin explained. “He's some higher up at the studio. Apparently if he's on your set observing, that means you're close to being finished. The film's already massively over budget.” Looking around Donna's trailer as if a thinking a hidden executive might jump out, he continued in hushed tones: “They think Chuck will sue if they don't finish the picture.”
“Sure. Where do you wanna go?” Castiel looked around for his shoes. Not even slightly sure when he took those off. They could be anywhere in the suite of rooms Dean was occupying.
“I mean, I guess? But they couldn't have helped what happened.”
“Oh brother,” Benny sighed. Dean took a peak and saw Benny had a blue cover. In fact, most of the people at the table had blue covers.
“No. You just seemed so... mature? I guess I assumed you were older. You look beautiful, but I had no idea how old you were.”
“I’m going to vomit,” Castiel said. “What have we been given?”
If it hadn't been for the film, Dean didn't know if he'd had ever met Castiel. If he hadn't met Castiel, he wouldn't have come to understand that film wasn't perhaps what he wanted to do. He wouldn't have learned about himself as much as he knew now.
Dean pinned Castiel against the closed door, arms crossed behind Castiel’s back, embracing him, breathing him in as he indulged in the moment.
“Well, then you know why he does that. It’s them acting out their passion, love, and mutual interested in a visceral way. Both get pleasure from the act, both agreed to the act.”
“I’m in love with my best friend,” Castiel offered up, sitting himself down next to Sam. “We sound like two peas in a pod.”
This wasn’t something they’d spoken of in many years. Their agreement that to keep the universe whole, they’d have to continue to give up their time on Earth and their time with Dean. And Dean would have to give up everything else.
“I was thinking... we could shower together?”
“Ex-flyboy. I’m not able to fly an aircraft any longer.” Castiel looked into his empty glass and Sam felt his heart squeeze for the look of upset that flashed on Castiel’s face. Clearly there was more to that story.
“I’M TELLING DAD!”
“Well, if it’s okay with your dad,” Dean shot Cas a nervous look.
“Don't look so glum. This won't end your career,” she tried to reassure the blonde.
“I don’t want to share you,” he breathed, his voice catching. “I know you love the idea, but Dean, I just… I can’t share you.”
“Nope, and I’m not going to force her into telling me. You can’t force people to out themselves, even if it is pretty obvious they aren’t studying every evening.”
“It isn’t crazy to me to want you to be happy. I can see from the longing in your eyes when you’re watching those videos just how much you long to serve a group of men like that.”
“I didn’t want to be with her though.” Sam shoulders were hunched and he curled up on himself a little. He so strongly remembered how he’d felt about Jess in the other world. “In the dream world, at least.”
Dean chuckled and poured the rest away.
Sam’s appetite was nonexistent and the steak he’d ordered tasted like nothing in his mouth. The hyper awareness of Castiel sitting next to him, with his brother and mother across from them, was just too much.
“Um, a red apple?”
Castiel nodded. “I imagine it would be nice to spend time with the same people. That was what you were used to on your movie series, from what you've told me. A TV show would be a similar thing.”
Sam’s smile was bashful as he took another sip of his drink.
Jody, Donna, and Dean were the only major roles left who were playing humans. But without a lead for the centauricorns, Dean wasn't sure how the film was ever going to go ahead. He thought at many points they'd just cancel the film and he could go onto something else, laughing at the lessons learned about contracts and warning signs of doomed films.
“It puts him into a better headspace,” Castiel confirmed. “Sam,” Castiel paused to ensure he had Sam’s full attention, “This can’t last forever. This isn’t a permanent solution. We’ve agreed on that.”
Sam laughed as the others all moaned.
“I feel like I'm in the

They were at their hotel room, preparing for a party the studio was putting on to congratulate them all. Following the party, they had the premiere, and then would be out doing international press together for a few weeks.
“Should it?” Dean wasn't bothered, but he started to get worried Castiel was.
Each time the door bell rang, there was Dean, in his cute little uniform, waiting to handover the pizza.
"Your plan, getting everybody safe, that's good, okay? But it won't last forever. Now we couldn't make Chuck pay, but Billie? She left her blade. Her I can kill."
"What did I tell you about that? Don't do that, it'll rust and bend like what happened to your other one." Cas scolded before sitting beside him. Dean just gave a guilty look as he put his jewelry back on his left hand.
"Don't take this the wrong way, 'I want him to be happy'. But it's so hard to watch you fall again, cause now I gotta play pretend."
When Cas went to the kitchen to see if they had anything to eat, he saw there wasn’t much there.
"Should?" Bobby repeated.
'This is where you always belonged.' Sam thought sadly.
"Don't take this the wrong way, 'I want him to be happy'. But it's hard to watch you fall again, cause not I gotta play pretend. Spending all of my time, writing on this fine line. It's hard to watch you watch you fall again, cause now I gotta play pretend."
“Want to get some rest? Jack should return soon, but it’ll be dark out by then.” Cas suggested, still holding Dean who wiped his eyes and nodded. Cas had already begun to lose his grace, becoming more human and needing human needs, such as sleep. There being one bed and one couch, he'd give the couch to Jack and use the bed for tonight.
"As long as I can still give you random midnight visits," Dean smiled, making Cas chuckle a little.
Then Dean looked up to see a book and a piece of paper on top. Not bothering to wipe his eyes, he crawled to it and picked it up. Only to drop it again and bury his head in his knees. Jack saw this and went to see what it was while Cas finally stood up and hugged Dean. And for once, the hunter didn’t fight it.
Cas had been startled and got his case down before wrapping his arms around Dean. He was shaking since he got off stage but he was so happy he did it.  And now so happy Dean was here and could hold him. Cas started crying too and held onto the other boy tighter.
Though we all know that when they do, it never ends well for someone.
Dean was half watching and half listening to his buddies. But he wasn't saying anything unless someone directly addressed him. One of the topics that he'd been pulled into was about his new girlfriend he had gotten, Lisa. She was a cheerleader and one of the best looking. Anyone would want to date her and not many were surprised Dean Winchester had snatched her up. He'd asked her out so suddenly the footballers were surprised but hooted and hollered at him. Dean just smiled and thanked them for their congrats, but it was half hearted.
"Follow me." Jack turned and went through the dinning room which had a small table, maybe fitting 2-4 people, and a wooden hutch seeming to be handmade here. It had photos and objects on display behind glass. The photo of Dean, Mary, and Sam when they were still kids. One of Mary and John when they got their wish for a few days. Another that seemed to go unnoticed by Dean from the backseat in the Impala.
Dean didn't know when he started liking Castiel but he was someone different and understood him like no one else. Like Dean understood Cas like no one else. Dean tried to blink away a tear at the realization. Cas must have felt so lost...
“Dean.” Cas brought his other hand up to hold Dean’s cheek, Dean automatically leaning into the touch, his eyes glossy. “I’ve stayed this long. Do you really think there is anything you can do that will push me away?” Cas smiled at him sadly, getting hopeful eyes in return, a tear falling from them.
He was eating dinner with the two most important men in his life when he saw one. Split from the core to the surface. People falling in the cracks, disintegrating from the heat of the inner Earth or suffocating from no air. It was horrible. So he told his father figures and said they had to leave.
Cas made him smile, made him laugh. When he was clueless, Dean would teach him mostly. And as he traveled with the Winchesters, and then finding Gabriel, he felt. He smiled, laughed, understood jokes, used sarcasm, cried. He was essentially a human with wings. But he also cared.
"We need a location," Sam thought out loud. "Somewhere central to everyone. We, uh, need somewhere secure, contained. We put them in, and we put up every last bit of warding we've ever used."
"Alright, you do that." Dean cut in.
He was willing to sacrifice everything he was for everyone he knew. Everyone he loved and cared for. Dean and Sam lost people left and right their whole life, even Castiel and each other. It's what's made their bond with family so strong. That knowing one day, out of the blue, they could lose one another and they may not make it back. Family is everything to the brothers. And now it's everything to Cas.
"He's kinda perfect and I wish he knew. Told me he thinks he has to settle, but I know that ain't true."
"We don't have a choice, Sam." The two stayed silent, finishing the conversation with a stern look and a nod.
"We'll figure this out," Cas said, intertwining their hands. Dean tightened them together and wiped at his eyes.
"Where would that be?" Cas asked him.
Dear Cas and Dean,
"I know you like the back of my hand, I want you more every day and it's hard to watch you fall again. Cause now I gotta play pretend. All I want to do is hold your hand, to keep you from sinking in quicksand. It's hard to watch you fall again, cause now I gotta play pretend."
The gym had filled up and the school talent show had begun. Dean was sitting with his football 'friends' at the top of the bleachers in the back. The other boys were talking quietly, not paying any attention to the performers. Not many people were actually watching, most of the acts being similar or have been done in previous years.
"I know Dean," Cas murmured softly. He brought Dean's face back, cradling it gently in his hand before leaning up and kissing Dean lovingly. Only way he could get across what he was feeling. Dean's eyes closed and he melted into it, tears flowing even more. He pulled back afterwards and looked at Dean, his eyes squinting with a smile.
Cas, I know what you said. I know what you did and what you were going to do. The Empty said you had to be happy. Your happiest moment, and it was that you love my brother. All my life I have wanted him happy, and you make him happy. You make him whole. You can do what I could never imagine, never thought I could do for him.
“Why not.”
The Impala was driven up to the house and stopped, Dean taking the keys out. Cas had been in the passenger seat while Jack was in the back. He looked up at the building before getting out, as did the other two. Going to the trunk, Dean unlocked it and they each took out their bags and closed the lid, all the weapons gone and in the bunker.
Dean opened his eyes hearing the next contestant, this one singing. Looking up at the stage, a raven haired boy was sitting on a chair in the middle of the stage with a microphone stand in front of him and shaking hands lightly strumming a guitar. But Dean knew that voice without looking. It's what he'd look for every day in third period. Where he met them. Where he met Castiel.
"Okidoke." Donna huffs out.
"A sacrifice." Cas added.
It’s been a week since that day. Since Sam died. Dean, Castiel, and Jack fixed everything. They beat Chuck and Jack took his powers making him mortal. When he brought everyone back, he decided to stay with the two and follow through with what Sam wanted for them. The three had decided to move out of the bunker and to the other worlds Cas and Dean’s house. From what they could tell in the journal, it was isolated somewhere in the forest in Texas but it also was beautiful.
Cas saw Dean's good and illuminates it. He stays, no matter what happens, and always appears when the man needs him. He always goes with Dean even if it's dangerous, especially when it's dangerous. He's pulled him from the darkness and the bad.
They left because of many reasons. If Dean stayed, he’d eventually want to find a way to hunt down the Empty or try and save his brother. Though all three of them knew that there wouldn’t be a resurrection this time. If Cas stayed, he’d always be reminded that Sam died when he should have. That the sacrifice that he was supposed to do was taken by someone else, someone close. And if Jack stayed, he’d see all the memories with Sam, what they did or said where, what he had helped him with. Even in his room when he had over heard the brothers talking about him and Sam came to clarify what he said.
"Yeah, I'm sure he does." The hunter looked out the window.
Dean could hear Cas's voice trembling, knowing he hated having the center attention. But he also knew Castiel could be determined when he wanted to be, and this probably seemed like the only way he could get Dean to listen without being direct. Dean's eyes drifted down for a moment, feeling even more terrible. Dean was always faking smiles at school, for Sammy, and now with Lisa.
“Are you two,” Dean gestured between them, “are you like a
“Suuush, it doesn't matter. Just the press being jerks, or the studio being jerks.” Whatever the case, it certainly wasn't worth talking about right now.
Sam was frozen. Confused more than anything as to why Castiel seemed so determined to get a reaction from Dean.
"Dean," he greeted. "You know you could just use your key, you’re always welcome."
It wasn’t in how he looked at Castiel, how he talked to Castiel, how he acted around Castiel. Well, not just in that. There seemed to be an inner light to his brother that Sam wasn’t familiar with, an energy that glowed harder the happier Castiel was.
“Concoction of djin juice, a spell, and some charm we’re still trying to figure out. Don’t worry, Claire’s on the job. I think she even had some knuckle dusters on her.”
“Why do I have three copies of Usher’s
Dean snuck a sideways glance at the man next to him. From his profile alone, Dean could tell he was a handsome fellow.
Sam shrugged. “I was curious. I know it’s not like that with me and Cas, Dean.”
“And that's why you're a professional, Dean,” Bela slipped in with a smile. “We have complete faith in you and Gabriel here to get the job done right.
Sam spent his Saturday morning out getting groceries for the weekend, in particular for the Sunday morning breakfast feast Dean had promised.
“Oh.” Now Dean felt awkward, and they hadn't even got to his penthouse suite yet. “It, um, just comes from experience with the contracts. I've spent much of my life in hotels, I just know what I like, you know?”
“What’s this other room?” Castiel squinted at Sam, tapping on the new addition to the existing building.
“Why don’t you just tell him? You don’t think he might be interested?”
Dean huffed impatiently. “Are we getting to the actual pain part yet or…?”
Dean silently cursed himself for putting Castiel on the spot. “I'm sorry. I'm sure you're very well qualified. It was just... an unusual move for them to take. If I'm honest, I feel like they're taking an even bigger risk on me.”
“I am, was? A lawyer. Maybe I should try a polar opposite career.”
Castiel pretended to consider the premise, eyes sparkling with love. “I just don’t think I can write that, Dean. Too kinky, too unbelievable. The audience would never buy into it.”
“Oh God, ohhhhh God yes,” Dean played along, back arching slightly, head coming up off the pillow. Sure, the muscles in his thighs in places were starting to cramp up, but he’d put up with that for hours if it meant more of this. More of this sensation of feeling so safe, yet so connected to someone he knew loved him.
“Pick a color, Dean.”
Dean kept hearing.
“This seat taken?”
“Anna is in her 40s, I know that much,” Dean replied. “I didn't think much of it. And besides, it isn't like our characters really do much together, romantically speaking.”
The footsteps of his little darlings were getting closer.
Looking wistfully through some of the action figures one afternoon, Dean thought maybe they were already correct in thinking he'd find it nice. Losing himself in nostalgia for an afternoon gave Dean time to reflect on what he really wanted from the future. For the time being, he concluded, he just wanted to see his brother.
last take”, which Dean learned meant at least five.
Sam was propped up against the headboard, rubbing his left eye slightly.
The words
Dean laughed, “Well, I've never gotten to film in Australia. I think I could do a pretty good accent,” he said in what he knew to be an awful imitation of an Australian accent.
That was a matter for debate, but not a debate Sam felt like getting into presently.
“I’ve missed you, Dean.” Castiel kissed Dean’s neck so softly before he took a step back. “What shall we do next?”
Dean was out with his cop friends again, this time Sam had declined the invite. He used the time instead to finishing putting together the presentation for his second interview on Monday. Something told him that after Saturday he wouldn’t be in the mood to do it on Sunday.
“I... I think I'd like that. I have a few meetings set for next week though.”
Castiel could see the relief in Dean’s expression at Claire’s joy.
“Look, we going for food or are you just going to keep bitching at me?”
"It's mostly the hedges and bushes I need trimmed,” Castiel explained as he gestured to the plants in question. “My old gardener retired and I'm afraid I let it all turn into a mess lately, as you’ve probably noticed. The grass needs a good mowing. A few of the vegetable beds will need to be plowed and seeded deep – but that can wait for now. I have a sit on mower and other tools in the yellow shed. I can take you back there later, show you the ropes."
“I’m a good boy,” Dean squeezed out. “And good boys deserve spanks.”
“You just come here to pick up then?”
Castiel laughed, “Deal.”
A shower, clean set of clothes and Sam let Dean drive them both to his Captain’s house.
“Ouuuuch, why did you...”
Dean and Castiel had at some point moved closer together, abandoning their cards on the table.
“I am so sorry, man. Here, I'll take it off.” He started to pull his arms through and went to lift it up when Castiel placed a hand on his chest stopping him.
“Nothing much?” Sam repeated back at him instantly. “Why are you calling me then?”
“He’s just jealous he doesn’t have you and your magical fingers,” Dean assured Castiel. “Cas, oh Cas, fuck, Cas!”
“Not of this particular lubricant, Dean. I made sure to pick up the nicer stuff last time.”
“What if this isn’t to his benefit? Are we being selfish?”
“Why would I know that?” Claire gawped at him.

Sam rubbed at his eyes and took a step back.
“Are you feeling well?” Castiel asked with great concern when he returned to the bed.
Sam was thankful to find Dean gone by the time he had finished cleaning himself up, but he persisted into the evening trying to get details. To Dean’s credit, he’d cooked for both of them before he started again with the questions.
“Together?” Sam looked at Castiel in surprise. “What do you mean?” Castiel had been woken up first though, he must have seen something Sam hadn’t.
As the days turned to weeks, and to months, Dean and Castiel did what they could. They learned about each others’ bodies as best they could until such a time that Dean was finally healed and Castiel was back to his most recent definition of normal for himself.
“That’s what my brother Sammy said too, you two really should meet one day.” Dean winked at Jack. “He’s a lot older than you too. The gummy bears must be magic.”
“So what? What’s love got to do with anything? Say we get together, say we’re blissfully happy. Shit still happens. It either ends in us breaking up or eventually one of us dying so the other can be alone for the rest of their lives.”
“What did you say?” Castiel asked, pulling back slightly.
“I’m on holiday,” she answered, putting her Kay back in her pocket. “I can go back to my hotel?”
Another Castiel was now kissing him. Dean wondered if the Castiels were ever tempted to kiss each other to expand some of their sexual energy while waiting.
“Blue?”
“Hey, hey, not my fault!” Sam stammered, eyes going wide and taking a step back from his mother. “Dean asked me not to say a word.”
The bellboy moved them onto his trolley and proceeded out.
The Castiels looked to each other again. Dean felt a shiver down his spine. It was almost like they could all communicate silently, but logically Dean knew it was more like all but Castiel One knew what happened. The Castiels all moved in as one and started to undress Dean.
The silence of the apartment got to Sam in the time Dean was out. Even if Dean wasn’t being useful, just having him there, a familiar anchor in a sea of uneasiness, had somehow made the process better. Sam had tried to be practical, tried to tell himself to just think of the next step, then the next, one at a time until he made it to the end. Stopping to think about the unknowns of the future was too fretful a thought.
“The dinner?” Dean prompted, noticing how nonplussed Sam looked.
“Eileen,” Sam coughed. “How are you…” he tried again to reach out. His arm responded but the movement was sluggish and hard. As his pupils grew used to the light, he could see they were in some sort of cave.
“I really am,” Castiel replied, voice troubled.
Swallowing his mouthful of food, Dean thought about his life.
Bobby looked between Castiel and Dean, eyes taking in everything before him and the personal objects strewn around the room.
“You look so hot doing that,” Dean encouraged. “You’re the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen. Ain’t no porn that’s ever been this good, ain’t no being that’s ever turned me on as much as you do just sitting there.”
“They seem like good people.”
“Sure.”
“We need to break this door down,” Sam told them, while he took a few steps back. “We have to get mom and get out of here!”
Out of the shit storm Bela had overseen came Castiel. And for that, Dean had to be thankful.
“That’d be great, Jody.” Sam infused as much enthusiasm as he could into the sentiment. “This food is incredible,” he was sure to let her know. And it really was. Simple steak, potatoes served with vegetables she’d grown herself in the backyard. “I haven’t eaten this well in forever.”
“Thats… wow.” Castiel blinked rapidly. “You’re a very hard worker, Dean. I’ve always thought so.”
“You were about to come.”
“I do trust you.”
“We’ll start with bubblegum and reassess at that point. If everything goes well, we will then proceed onto apple. You may ask for me to stop at any point, no safe word today, just tell me stop.”
“I... um, thanks,” Dean stuttered, 20 minutes later when the whole thing was finished. They were standing in the area behind the stage again, all congregating and getting to know each other.
business. It’s too easy to lose touch with your heart as you get older. You see too much, experience too much, feel too much. Why else do you think so many of the angels end up as they do?”
“To people watch, if I’m being honest. And if someone catches my eye, I try to see if they’re interested back.”
Dean wanted to call him out on it. Wanted to ask if everything he’d said about Dean’s aging body still being beautiful to him was true or not. Wanted to ask if Castiel had missed sex more than he’d thought.
“Ah, Mr Fitzgerald–”
Dean leaned over the table and wrapped his knuckles on Sam’s skull. “Funny, not hollow after all.” He sat back. “Again, what the fuck, Sammy? Why would I think that?”
“Hello, Sam.”
"We need something! You think Heaven's the only place that needed maintenance? When all the angels were gone except your precious Castiel, you found a way to fix that."
The door opens and the last jumper, the one that I fought the first time, comes out. She is shaking and leaning on the aids that are leading her from the room. That really calms my worries, not. Benny asks me what they did to her. As I turn to tell him that I have no idea, Cas comes to the door. Evidently, he is the one that is administering the tests. He looks around for a second and then calls my name. I look back at Benny, and I’m sure that he can read the fact that I’m scared. It’s written all over my face, but Benny is one that I have gotten closer to here. I think he suspects that I’m not who I personify myself to be, but he hasn’t said anything, at least not yet.
I ask about his tattoo. It’s something else that really shouldn’t be consequential, but it ends up being something very significant. It’s a large black set of wings that run from the base of his back up and out his shoulders with each of the symbols for the factions down the middle. I tell him how amazing it is as I run my fingers over the feathers. He does a full body shiver and I try to distract myself by asking why he has all the factions. He tells me that he doesn’t want to be just one thing.That he can’t be. He wants to be brave, intelligent, selfless, honest and kind. He turns around and is right up in my space, saying that he’s still working on kind. I think back to all the times that he has been abrupt with me, but I also think of all the times that he has been kind to me, and I have to wonder if he doesn’t see that he is kind already.
We make a run for it, heading down the street and making a turn at the next intersection of the path. Unfortunately, Gordon fires a shot, hitting me in the arm as I go around the edge of the building. Cas notices as well, saying that I’ve been hit. It’s a testament to my worry, that I don’t have a witty comeback to this statement. He stops me, pulling me back into him as three men step around the far end of the building and two more come up behind us. Gordon yells for us to drop our weapons. We are then bound and lead into a building that seems to be being used as a base of operations of some sort.
“She did it because she thinks this is her chance to win. With both you and Naomi out of the running she stood a real chance, she saw an opportunity and she took it. As far as not denying her claims, no I didn’t because she wasn’t wrong. I have been seeing Cas, for a few weeks now actually. We weren’t really sure how to tell you and Naomi, but I guess Betty did do us one favor in spreading the word.” Dean finished up answering Mary’s questions and was trying to give her time to digest the information, but they didn’t really have a lot of time. They had to get her on their side and have her agree to Dean’s idea before they could go on to the next part of the plan.
“No, I get it. It isn’t right, and I know that it really bothers Dean. Cas is a little quieter when it comes to me so I honestly don’t know how he feels about it all, but I know Dean has said that they didn’t like having to keep things secret, so that tells me that Cas is feeling the same. Tomorrow changes all of that though, they won’t have to keep the fact that they are together a secret. It isn’t going to change the drama that’s going to happen, if anything it will actually draw more attention.” Sam ended with a smile, he knew that his brother would like the fact that he was going against everyone's expectations, if he could let himself see that instead of worrying what the repercussions would be.
I gather the papers and pieces of cardboard that I found and head back to the building that we are calling home. We have to keep moving because we aren’t allowed to close to the city, but there is an area where the Abnegation brings food. We try to stay close to that. The problem is there is no heat. That’s where the papers and cardboard come in. We are almost out of places to look in the outskirts, soon we will have to go outside of the walls for these things.
“Castiel Novak? I mean, I always knew that Benny guy in Paris was more than a roommate, but really, Dean? Castiel Novak? Mom is going to lose her mind over this.” Sam seemed to run out of steam. Dean wasn’t sure if he simply didn’t have anything else to say, or if it was something on his own face that made his brother stop, but he was grateful for it either way. He had always been close to his brother, and he had been hoping Sam would understand.
We gather around to find out our final scores for round one of training. Gordon is explaining that if we are ranked above the red line we go on to the second stage of training. If we are ranked below the red line, they don’t want to waste anymore time on us and we will be thrown out. We become factionless based on one little red line. I’m sitting with my friends as they start lighting up the names. Some people start shouting, but I’m almost afraid to look. I somehow manage it, and my name is above the line! I honestly was starting to think that I wasn’t going to make it.
Sam grinned. Yeah, he knew where this was headed. “I’m sure there’s some left in here somewhere. You aren’t going to get tore up like he is are you? Although, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have any trouble carrying your short self up the stairs.”
We leave the house and step into line with the other Dauntless that are marching by, having already cleared the houses down from us. Of course as we get around a hundred feet down the path we see Uriel and Gordon walking the other direction. Uriel looks as if he is about to step in and I notice Cas sending me a glance that I decipher as I keep going, but stay close. That’s exactly what I do as Uriel steps in front of him, causing him to have to stop. He’s taunting Cas, but to his credit Cas doesn’t react. He simply stands there looking at Uriel as if he can’t hear him. He goes to step away, but steps back before I can even let my guard down in the least. Gordon asks him if he thinks Cas might be divergent, but Uriel being the cocky bastard that he is, says that there is one way to find out and begins to aim his weapon.
He goes on about how the faction system is the safest way, and that divergents are going against the factions, and that eliminating them keeps the peace, that independent will is dangerous. He says that even though there is a certain beauty in our resistance, that it is a beauty that they just can’t afford. Then he just walks away, apparently having made his point and not wanting to waste anymore time on me. I try again to wake Cas, but just as I touch his face one of Lucifer’s lackeys pressed some buttons on a screen and he’s attacking me. He fights hard, and he fights dirty, he truly is Dauntless. I have learned well though, and I hold my own for a while, but it eventually becomes apparent that I can’t continue. I call out to him throughout the fight, but there is no recognition.
“I’ll do it. Do you actually have a plan, or just an idea? There is a difference you know.” He was trying to keep how shocked he was off his face and out of his voice, and he must have succeeded, because Dean didn’t mention anything.
He tried a few times to get me to stop, and yes I am human, he did ask. I just wanted to be able to get a good vantage point. When I do stop, he climbs up even with me. I tell him that it isn’t too bad, he agrees, but I don’t believe him. It’s an amazing view. I can see all the way across the park. I enjoy a few seconds with only me and Cas in a little bubble on top of the world. I have to be careful, I could see myself falling for him, and that would be dangerous. I spot Uriel’s team flag and point it out to Cas.
“I get it. My mom always said if she wasn’t getting to compete against your mother, then it wasn’t any fun. I kind of get where she was coming from. If there isn’t any good competition, it isn’t a challenge.” Dean must have felt he was being too sappy and quickly added on, “That just means I have to get you trained up, so you can give me someone worth competing against.”
Sam had grinned a little with the confession that he had helped Dean, and he wasn’t sure if it was because Sam had done something to finally be in on the secret, or if it was because he enjoyed his time being the distraction. Sam had always had a sort of hero worship for Gabriel. Dean wasn’t sure if that was all it was, but if it was more, he hoped he and Castiel could pave the way for his little brother to pursue something else, if that’s what he wanted.
The judges had completed their tastings and were discussing amongst themselves the merits of each entry. It was truly nerve racking for Cas. He knew Dean would make it through without a doubt, but he wasn’t as sure of himself. Yes, Dean had taught him how to bake, but would that be enough? Cas wasn’t completely sure.
“There is no reason for you to beat yourself up, this isn’t your fault, just like it isn’t Sam and Gabe’s fault. I know you aren’t mad at them, but you are taking it out on them while also berating yourself. We may not have started this feud, but we are going to end it. Our mothers are working together again, so we don’t have to worry about hiding anything from them and our fathers have been getting along all this time. I think it’s wonderful that our brothers can find a little happiness in life, they deserve the same chance at it that we do. I want us to be happy Dean, don’t let something that is almost over cause you so much pain.”
Because Cas rarely spoke up, it got Gabe’s attention. He decided Sam was right and that maybe he should hear his little brother out.
“Hey, Cas. Any luck on the bread?" Dean had that cheeky grin that meant he knew Castiel hadn’t had any luck but was asking anyway.
I ask just to be sure, that he just said he would be able to see inside my mind. His simple reply was uh huh, with a, why are you asking, look on his face. He walks over and runs a finger along my neck. This makes me shiver. I don’t know if he thinks it’s fear or not, but it definitely was a little of both, fear and anticipation. The fear this time isn’t because of the tests, it’s the fear of my own reactions and the thought of Cas being this close to me. I look into his eyes, then he breathes in and injects the serum.
I walk up the steps to the platform that the simulation chair is centered on. I notice that not only is Lucifer here, but so is Uriel. This is awesome, all my enemies in one place. Sarcasm comes easy, because it’s my coping mechanism when I’m nervous. I sit down in the chair and Jo comes up and administers the serum. She tells me good luck, and that she hopes I make it. That isn’t really a confidence builder, but I have faith in myself and in Cas, we have practiced enough that I should be able to do this. I close my eyes and the next time that I open them, I’m in my fear landscape.
I’m in a building in the old city when I hear a scream. Someone goes flying by over my head on a zipline that Dauntless set up. I had once been Dauntless, and had heard stories about the zipline, but I never did get to experience it. When I attended my choosing ceremony, I was already in love with an amazing young man who was also from Dauntless. I followed him and left my home and my family.
“Anyway, Dean and I came to an agreement of sorts. We agreed that he would help me learn how to bake, so that I didn’t end up losing the bakery, and I would help him make a business plan. He wants to expand the bakery he and his mom own, and she agreed to take a serious look at the business plan if Dean wins. It might seem counterproductive that we are helping each other, but it works. This round might get a little trickier because there can only be one winner, but it worked for the last round. I’m honestly not sure what is going to happen, but that is how I started hanging around Dean Winchester, as you put it.” Cas wasn’t done, and they both knew that, but he had to compose himself and prepare for what was going to come when he continued this conversation.
“Quit using your mommy’s recipes, Winchester.” Cas knew that he was in fact using his mother’s recipe as well, but it was something, and he didn’t really know what to say to Dean’s comment. He knew that they would have to do this, but he really didn’t have a come back for Dean’s statement. He really had almost burnt down the bakery, twice.
When Mary and Naomi had their blowout, it had affected more than just their friendship. Chuck and John had been golfing buddies for years, and Dean and Cas had been as close as brothers. John had silently agreed with everything that Mary dictated, but it was harder for Dean. He was upset about losing his friend, and it was the first time he and his mother had such a serious argument.
Gabe had taken it as his personal mission to spoil the poor child rotten, but Sam was trying to keep his husband in line. It wasn’t an easy task, but if anyone had been up to the challenge it was Sam. He and Gabe had gotten married last fall, on their two year anniversary, and it had taken them almost another full year to finally be able to bring Jack to meet the rest of the family. They had all seen him through skype and had been shown pictures of the little guy, but only Sam and Gabe had met him in person.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Yeah? How exactly does that work? I can’t bake if you haven’t noticed. What can I possibly help you with?” Castiel raised an eyebrow at Dean in challenge.
“What exactly do you have in mind?” Sam could give a smouldering look of his own.
“What’s really bothering you Dean?” Cas knew that Dean didn’t have a problem with Gabe and Sam getting together, and he knew that Dean was aware of how close the two actually lived. If Sam was going to fall for someone while he was here, Gabe was actually the best option because there wouldn’t have to be any decisions made about who was going to give up their lives to move so far away. They only lived about a half an hour apart, it was perfect. It was something else, and Cas just couldn’t figure out what it was.
Since Gabe was making no moves to get out of the truck, Sam pulled past the drive and started towards Dean’s house. He wasn’t sure what Gabe was expecting tonight, hell he wasn’t even sure what he was expecting. They had known each other growing up and had become fairly good friends over the last week, but they had only had their first kiss today and he wasn’t sure where Gabe saw this going. He wanted to make sure that they were on the same page before things went too far, and if that meant that they had to have another conversation then so be it, that is what they would do.
After what seemed like a lifetime, the announcer came on stage and announced he would call the names of the finalists, and they would need to come back up on stage. It wasn’t like they were very far; the semi-finalists had been corralled just down below the stage so they would have easy access through the crowd of people when the finalists were announced.
“Come on, I drove tonight. I remembered how crazy it could get and definitely didn’t want to ride with my mother. I can take you to Cas’s place.” Sam led the way to a shiny black pick up truck Gabe hadn’t seen before, which made sense because Sam hadn’t been around town in a few years.
“I guess Gabe is down. Cas says they are going to be here at eight. Do you wanna grab a bite to eat before they come? I really need a drink. Gabe can be a real pain in the ass, and I am not sure I can deal with him completely sober.”
He had to laugh. Evidently, Gabriel was still as wonderful as ever. Dean couldn’t really complain. They had gotten along alright back when they were allowed to, but Gabe had always been rather loud and boisterous. Dean could see how that would get on Cas’s nerves.
Going down to the choosing ceremony is a family affair. We go in and each faction is sitting with its own members. Our society is divided by what faction we belong to. Each faction also has a bowl setting on the stage that will provide us a way to choose. After we have made our choice we will go to the faction that will be our home from now on. We climbed the stairs to our seats and the ceremony began. There are a few that chose the same faction that they are born into, then one that defects. The parents are crying, they won’t see their child as much anymore. The motto is faction before blood after all.
“Easy tiger, I let you sleep in, or well I tried to let you sleep in as long as I could. We have to get ready quickly, and I believe the best way to do that would be separate showers or we will never be leaving the house.” This made sense to Cas, but he still pouted just a little bit. It was enough for Dean to lean over and plant a chaste kiss on the protruding lip.
This round would be two groups of three, and the judges would wait until after everyone had completed their dishes before deciding on the finalists. Dean and Cas were in the first round, and they were, in fact, going head to head. They were on opposite ends of the room, so as to contribute in a small way to the feud that neither one really wanted to perpetuate. They were willing to bicker a little and try to stay as far apart as they possibly could, but they wouldn’t degrade each other, and they wouldn’t get violent. It wasn’t something that they had really talked about; they just weren’t really comfortable doing that. It may have been a very dramatic finale for their mothers, but they refused to stoop that low. It would be harder to explain when everything came out if they were mean to each other now. Though, some teasing was fun.
Meet me somewhere…
Left with no other choice, Castiel made the decision to step up and take his mother's place in the bake off. He had her recipes and the bakery, and at least a rudimentary knowledge of how a pie should be made.The only problem was that Castiel couldn’t bake. The knowledge of how something should be made and actually being able to make it were two totally different things.
Once on the roof there is a gruff guy who introduces himself as Uriel. He’s a bit of a dick, and informs us that now we must jump again. This time it’s into a hole in a roof that is below the one that we are standing on. He says it’s the only way in and if we don’t jump then we aren’t brave enough to be Dauntless. Benny now looks terrified. I have to do this, I at least have to prove to myself that I am brave enough to be here, and that I did do the right thing in leaving my brother to Lucifer. It can’t have been for nothing, so when he calls for the first jumper I volunteer.
Finally the contestants and their families go their separate ways to try and get some sleep before the finals the following day, or at least that was what they had said they were going to do. As Dean was waiting for Cas to climb into Baby, he noticed that Gabe was climbing up into Sam’s monster of a truck and Mary was riding with Naomi. He really hoped that things between Mary and Naomi would be better now, and it hadn’t passed his notice that during their little experiments, that Naomi and Mary had held their own discussion. He had tried to allow them their own time to work things out once it looked like they were going to, so he didn’t pry.
We don’t have too long before the round starts…
Well, he can really screw off now, because I’m not telling anyone my secret. I tell him that I don’t have any tricks and he reminds me, once again, that no one makes it through the sim that fast. He says that if I’m not going to tell him then I should at least tell my friends. I wish that I could tell them, so that there was some way to help them have an edge over this system. When Garth asks what he’s talking about and if there is some way to make it easier, I just say no, and that I don’t know what he’s talking about.
Sam and I, since we don’t know what faction our parents should have been in, aren’t so sure what the tests will say tomorrow. The way the factions are set up, when you are eighteen, you choose the faction that you will be as a full fledged member of society. There is no going back. Once you choose you either succeed or you become factionless. The factionless are considered the scrugs of society and have no home and no family. You don’t want to be factionless.
“Bitch.” With that they went the rest of the way into the building and found their places. The semi-finals were getting ready to start.
Dauntless are spread between the different paths and go door by door to every house, pulling men, women and children out onto the street. Once they have been brought out they are all herded together like animals. I can’t take it anymore, I turn to Cas and tell him that I have to find my parents. They can’t have any idea what’s coming their way. I mean, Sammy knew, because he’s the one that told me something was coming. He didn’t seem to have any idea that it would be something like this, or I don’t believe he would have had any part in it. Sammy may be one of the smartest people I have ever met, but he still cared about his family when he left, and I don’t think that they could have brainwashed him against us that quickly.
Since Dean and Cas were now helping their mothers, Sam thought that it would be a good time to talk to Gabe. He waited until everyone else was discussing whether to use pecans in the pie, simply as a garnish, or not at all, to pull Gabe aside. Grabbing him by the arm and leading him to the stock room of the bakery, Sam wanted to say a few things, but he also wanted to ask a few as well. How Gabe answered those questions would determine which way this conversation would go.
Betty looked taken aback and Dean was grinning from ear to ear. He was so proud of Cas for confronting Betty. They had wanted to, but no one knew exactly how she had gotten the recipes. It got the announcers attention and he came over, wanting to see the original and the photo of the recipe. “We heard her on tv talking about her recipe, so we decided that we were going to change ours. She stole both of our recipes and combined them to use in the bake off. We just didn’t have proof until now.” Cas wasn’t backing down and Dean was liking this side of him.
She tells me that I need to be careful. I’m not completely sure what she is talking about. I try to ask, but she just asks about my tests. It takes a few minutes for me to answer, I don’t trust easily and I really don’t know this woman, even if she is blood. She says that I can’t tell my friends or instructors. I ask her what I am, what’s wrong with me? She says that I just don’t conform and that makes them uncomfortable. They can’t control me, therefore, I scare them. She told me that I’m at the most risk during the second stage of training. That they will be getting inside my head.
“Why would you bring Novaks in this house? You know, Betty told me something yesterday that I just couldn’t believe, but looking at you all now I just don’t know.” Then, Mary looked between Sam who was sitting on the couch and Gabe who was standing behind him looking more like a pit bull then anything that she had ever seen in her life. “What do you two have to do with this? She told me that she had seen these two sneak off to make out in the orchard, but that doesn’t have anything to do with you. What’s going on?”
Everyone unloads and lines up beside the platform. We then march across the gravel roads between buildings. Our destination is almost immediately clear, as the grey buildings of Abnegation come into view. It wasn’t like I had any doubt to begin with. My mind flies to Bobby and Ellen. It’s barely sun rise, they would be still preparing for their way. We come across some children playing in the path that runs between the houses. The soldiers, that Dauntless have been transformed into, don’t even stop, they don’t even slow down. I look to Cas and we both seem to realize this isn’t going to be good.
“How did you know you wanted to go into law enforcement?”
It had been a weird few months, but maybe... maybe it was destined to happen so that he could be here, at this moment in time, with Castiel right beside him.
They hadn’t started here. They’d started with cuddling five months ago – or perhaps five years, maybe five decades ago? Even Castiel was losing track of time now. With no Dean or Sam on regular time to help him keep relative to human time, he was back to the fluid-time experience he’d had before he’d met them. Where the days and weeks passed in but a blink of the eye.
“For your best friend?”
“Jody,” Dean muttered. “What is, who...” Dean gave up.
He woke several times in the night, cheeks wet, brain feeling rung out like a cloth twisted dry.
Dean snorted into his beer.
“And I don’t want anyone but you either, Cas. It’s just a dumb fantasy. I don’t need that, I just need you. Honestly, Cas,” Dean moved his body to lean even further into Castiel’s naked, warm body behind him. “I don’t need anyone but you. The porn is just a fantasy, you’re my reality and the only one I want.”
“I'll miss you more,” Dean whispered back.
The battery on Sam’s laptop had died a couple of hours ago and he’d meant to get up to plug it in but time had gotten away from him. Time spent watching some shopping channel with the sound off. Zoning out on the smiling hosts while pretending everything was wonderful was easier than trying to figure out why he didn’t feel like he wanted to practice law anymore. School, grad school, internships, days, weeks, months of not sleeping, the debt (oh the debt), so he could achieve his dream. And suddenly there he was at 35 years old, sleeping in his brother’s spare room, questioning where he’d gone wrong.
And thanks for reading!
“I need to confess something.”
“Ah, um...” Castiel hesitated.
“It kinda is, Dean.”
“What do you have there?” Castiel asked Jack.
