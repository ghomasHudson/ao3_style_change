"Hey, cheer up, handsome." Jack patted John on he shoulder as he rose. "The doctor has a habit of showing up to those who need them. Have a little faith."
“This is amazing. Fantastic!” John said, staggering up to the console.
can manage that."
John bent to lick slowly up his neck, then paused with his lips barely touching Sherlock’s. “Just say it.”
be the fathers the Doctor mentioned! Hamish is the very spit of you both! But I have to ask. How was Hamish—“ Craig cleared his throat. “
Sherlock raised his eyebrows at John, his voice still level. “Will throwing a fit save us? Will worrying change the outcome at all?”
Jim gnashed his teeth as he got closer to climax and reached one hand up to clutch at the back of John’s neck, the other reaching around to jerk him off.
century. This, right here, is a fluke. And it needs to be corrected,” the Doctor said.
“Want to play ‘spot the people having affairs’ like we did last time? Granted, you always win. But you can laugh at my feeble little mind or use whatever the insult of the day is,” he suggested.
“Experiments I want to try,” Sherlock lied.
idiots, yes! I get it, okay! You’re a freakish genius, we’re not. You don’t have to say so every five seconds.”
"Oh, don't be dull, John, things went from crazy to loopy as soon as Duncan Reynolds II walked through the door. Massive crush? Please. He flirted with everyone."
“Are…are you….can I?” Sherlock worked his fingers in and out a bit.
Hamish looked at Craig for permission, who nodded, then marched off to his bedroom, still holding the ice to his head.
John wheezed and tried to pry Jim's fingers from his throat as Jim hissed in his ear, “
John laughed outright as Sherlock shot him a death glare. “Your
“ Wow! Adventure stories? I love those! Brilliant! I’ve never met a real writer before!” Hamish took another step toward Doyle to shake his hand, but tripped on the edge of the rug and smashed into him.
John wrapped his hands around Sherlock’s arched back, taking him in his mouth at last, pulling in and out, easing off occasionally before setting in again, causing Sherlock’s pleasure to roll in waves.
Sherlock polished off his sandwich and laced his fingers together. “Keep together…and blink—what sort of instructions are those?” He frowned.
“You don’t recognize either of these men?” The Doctor asked. “The name Sherlock Holmes doesn’t ring any bells?”
The letter wasn’t very specific, and clearly part of a chain of correspondence, but it was clear enough that Jim was having trouble with business in London. Apparently since they had left, things had been spiraling out of control in that particular section of Moriarty’s web.
Sherlock held onto John tightly, closing his eyes, then pulled back to look John up and down. John felt harder, more muscular, and his face looked weary. The lines in his face were more definite, hardened. His eyes were sad, as if he’d seen too much. He smelled of gunpowder, too—the skin at his neck, his hair—and Sherlock knew John had been carrying on in Sebastian’s footsteps.
“Well, he’s called the Doctor, and he’s really funny—and really weird,” Hamish added, frowning a bit. “But he pops in every now and then to say hi. He usually ends up breaking something on accident.”
? I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO KEEP THIS CLEAN!” Jim took a step forward, and before John had time to react, he took a swing at him, his fist connecting hard with John’s cheekbone.
John followed him, his mind still whirling. “Why did you kill that man for me, Jim?”
Sherlock knew the prostate was a sensitive area, and he knew he’d hit the mark when John let out a strangled gasp of pleasure. That only spurred him on to thrust faster, grabbed John’s hips so he could angle himself the right way to hit John’s prostate again.
Jim grabbed a bottle of some sort of oil from his bedside table and slicked his fingers with it, then shoved two fingers into John without warning, curling them against John’s prostate in a way that made John arch his back and curl his toes, wanting more.
John shrugged. “If you need anything, I’ll be in my room.”
“Hamish and I stopped a robbery, nothing too exciting. The criminal was too obvious, but we were in the neighborhood. It’s good to be home.”
human?"
One evening, as he sat at the kitchen counter, measuring the toxicity of large quantities of nutmeg, some part of his brain suggested that he had, on some level, been curious as to what kissing John Watson would be like. He immediately tossed this off as ridiculous and, furious with himself, grabbed his things and headed to St. Bart’s to work without distractions.
The Doctor?”
“Dad, you look hilarious! Can I try your hat on?”
John considered this dilemma as he stepped into the kitchen. Gone was the fridge full of convenient if slightly off food, and the electric stove was replaced by an intimidating coal stove. Without a microwave and an electric kettle John was at a complete loss on what to do.
This meant that Jim was relatively harmless, but in his current state, John was never going to be assigned to London. And, just because Jim was listless didn’t mean his hired men were. John knew several of them kept close tabs on him, whether he went out or stayed in.
“Got scraped up again, you pathetic shit? Let me see your gun.”
Sherlock cut him off with a soft kiss, wrapping a hesitant hand around the back of John’s neck to pull him into the kiss.
“For experiments,” Craig and Sherlock said at the same time, and Sherlock grinned and rubbed his hands together.
Sherlock flipped forward a couple pages. “Ha! Wrong.” He kept skimming. “Wrong—wrong! Gregson...who’s he? We don’t know a DI Gregson, do we? Clearly this is a load of rubbish. These stories aren’t even accurate. Embellished…
“This…is definitely not home,” John said, turning in a circle to take in everything.
Sherlock finally stopped pacing. "Too early to say." He disappeared to his room, murmuring to himself.
“Sherlock! Another one—“ John managed, as if Sherlock hadn’t been able to tell from the way he’d jumped back.
“Feeling lucky, Johnny?”
rather brilliant. Enjoys causing mayhem.
“Right!” John stood up, pleasantly surprised that Sherlock was game to join him. He often made it a point to avoid pubs, especially on those days when a match was on. “Cross and Keys, then? It’s just down the road.”
sake, should I put my life and
“You need to have a bit more faith in the TARDIS, Sherlock Holmes! She’s never landed on anyone—well, just the once. But honestly, he deserved it.” The Doctor grinned and surveyed the living room, then his smile faltered a bit as he took in the cluttered flat that was still overrun by ashtrays and stacks of file folders. “Am I bit late?” He checked his watched and tapped on it.
John closed his eyes, his breathing falling short. When he opened his eyes, Jim was standing over him, and John felt weak and sick to his stomach. “Y-you’ve never managed to kill him before. Why should I believe you?” John looked up at him tiredly.
That night, John felt happier than he had in a long while. He curled around to protect his son’s body while he slept, not minding the pain in his back. If nothing else, John thought, he had kept his son safe so far. He had killed and done other unspeakable things, and he had abandoned Sherlock, but his son was safe in his arms, and that was almost enough for the moment.
“Nice to have some youthful energy around here again, isn’t it?” John hung his bowler on the hat stand and walked over to kiss Sherlock.
Sherlock considered this as he unbuttoned his suit and shirt. He thought of his own father, a stern, often-absent man who had frowned on rituals like tucking in or stories or other methods of coddling.
Hamish looked like he could melt with happiness, and pressed his cheek against his father’s arm.
“I think Arthur’s a bit in love with you. Every time I pass his door he wants to hear about a new case.”
“Shit.” John hurriedly sent the image to the scanner in the next room and shut down the computer. “Shit, shit, I’m in trouble.”
“Mmm, just like every other activity under the sun.”
Sherlock looked down at the boy. “How much do you know about the Doctor?”
Breathing hard through his nose, Jim said, “I imagine this was your doing?” he gestured at his shoulder vaguely.
Blood pooled across the Persian rug, staining it, but John knew Jim never cared for it anyway, so he rolled O’Seanassy’s body up in it and dragged it out through the kitchen. He had thought that Jane had gone out to run errands, but she was still there, chopping potatoes. She watched with wide eyes as John silently dragged the rolled rug through the room, but said nothing. She was all too aware of the consequences of Jim’s work, and she must have heard the gunshot minutes before.
“Why, Sherlock Holmes!” The jovial voice came from behind him. Sherlock whirled around to see the Doctor grinning at him. He was dressed as he was before, in his antiquated bowtie, ridiculous suspenders, and too-short trousers. The only thing that was different was the top hat perched on his head. “Look at you! I just popped out to have a look, see if you were getting on all right.”
The man gave another disgusting grin and shoved a folded piece of paper into John’s hands. John unfolded it:
“Mm. The wall looks so
“What’s happened?” he asked, leading the inspector up the stairs to his flat.
“Do you really want to test me?” He leaned towards John, bracing his arm on the sofa back. “Care to gamble your lover’s life? If so, by all means, turn down my offer. It could be fun! Maybe I’ll just kill you
One night, while lying awake, John said out of nowhere, “You know what the worst part is? Not the dread of going, but the idea that we might get separated somehow.”
Sherlock glared at him. He felt powerless, and he loathed it.
She mumbled an apology and gave a quick curtsy before hurrying past him down the stairs.
Sherlock watched him with pure and utter loathing as the tidy man slipped his fine silk tie from his shirt collar and tied it around John’s head, blindfolding him. He wanted nothing more than to punch this man in the face, over and over and over again. He dug his nails into his palms and bit his tongue.
John rolled his head back, groaning involuntarily, and clutched at Sherlock’s hips, beginning to rub himself against Sherlock. Sherlock still had his trousers on, and the layers of fabric between them were infuriating.
By now, John had learned the conditions and expectations of his position as bodyguard and assassin. He’d started calling Jim, with no suggestion from him, “sir.” When Moriarty asked him why, John said, “You’re my boss, aren’t you?”
John closed his eyes, sick of Jim’s games, and nodded, giving up, almost wishing for the bullet when a shot rang out. He jumped and kept his eyes squeezed closed. He didn’t feel any pain, and when he finally realized that he hadn’t been shot at all, he opened his eyes.
be. Oh, and look, no amygdala,” he joked.
A couple of days later, as John was re-stitching a popped seam over one of Jim’s wounds, he finally asked, “Who shot you, Jim?”
It wasn’t so hard to kill Burke after all. He stalked him while Burke was on assignment. One bullet; tidy, no witnesses. He had, he estimated, less than a day before Moriarty found out. Less than a day to kill him, then. As John walked home, wiping off and pocketing his gun, he coldly decided that he would kill Jim as soon as Jim got home from his meeting that evening.
I imagine you’re quite the precocious five-year-old.”
“He left of his own volition. It’s time we led our separate lives, and I intend to give him his space.”
“I never said it was fair, John,” the Doctor said, giving him a sad, old smile. He gripped John’s hand. “Goodbye, Doctor Watson. Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes. I know you’ll both do what you need to do.”
. The happier
“Oh, but you were never able to deduce how I felt about you from all the insights you gathered from that tie index you made?” John asked sarcastically.
John’s eyes widened, and he began struggling even more intensely, expending all of his energy into a simultaneous effort to get free and to increase the pressure against his prostate.
“At least with clothes, most folks don’t have very many sets of them,” John said. “At least that’s what it seems like. Makes sense: a good tailored suit’s expensive, relative to the time, I mine!”
When Mary answered the knock at the door and looked up at the man grinning at her, she new exactly who it was. He matched Sherlock’s description perfectly, and she remembered Sherlock’s warnings all too vividly. She gripped the doorframe tightly to steady herself. “May—may I help you?” She was so frightened that she forgot to curtsey, and hastily tacked on, “…Sir?”
“No need,” Sherlock said, excitement creeping into his voice. “I’ll be there immediately.”
suffer from delusional memories? I was born here in London, 1981,” Sherlock said.
“Mmm,” Sherlock mumbled distractedly.
“Yes. Mycroft, there are…extenuating circumstances. If I could explain, I would, but this is very much my goodbye.”
this way. It’s like…if you were on a case and there was nothing at stake, and the world would continue on regardless of whether you solved it or not, but it was so incredibly
Sherlock threw an arm out to stop John, knowing Jim was right.
Sherlock refused to look at him. “Goodnight, John.”
“Did he? That
“Sherlock, ease up! You need some people on your side, because right now you’re pushing
John followed, closing the door behind him. “You’ll thank me later, honestly. Most of these Victorian medicines should be avoided. Trust me, I’m a doctor.” He eyed the bloody scrape on Jim’s knuckles from where he’d punched the wall. “I’ll disinfect that for you.”
. You want to know about my business,
“Me too.”
“Yeah…” Craig said, looking dazed. “He was testing chewing gum elasticity or something. Like I said, often I don’t even understand what he’s talking about it.”
“Your wife...when did she die?”
“Look at them. All so happy. Ignorant. Must be nice,” Sherlock grumbled.
Hamish’s frown mirrored his dad’s. “What are
“I beg your pardon, sir!” Arthur stepped backwards as the men stepped in.
The space was of course entirely different. The fireplace was in the same spot, but the floor was covered in an old rug. There were a few pieces of furniture with dusty sheets thrown over them, but it was mostly barren.
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile at that. “Tell the serial killers to bring their best game. And Doctor…thank you.”
John knew exactly where he’d go. He had enough money to take a carriage to Hamish’s school and visit.
John had to ask. It had been the most absurd thing he'd ever seen. This man had held up a piece of tarmac and a woman's face was stuck through it. It was a good video trick, John granted him that, but it was so laughably ridiculous that it had to be fraudulent.
Hooper?”
“Not in the slightest. Not now anyway. Where were you when you saw this ‘police box’?”
Jim growled fiercely, “
John began to suspect that something had happened to Sherlock. He hated that he had no way of knowing. Not for the first time he wished he had any sort of technology. He felt entirely disconnected from London, other than scraps of general news. Sherlock could be dead, for all he knew.
call me back. It’s like—it’s like they’ve been moving on their own. They used to be covering their eyes—now one is turned toward the window, as if looking out. Please call me back.
it. The world is spinning on as happily as it is able, so what
They had the decency to at least pretend that they were look at exhibits on their way up, but they were quick about ducking inside the room. It was empty, as expected, and John wasted no time in yanking Sherlock into a secluded corner, pushing him against the glass case to kiss him.
The Doctor led Sherlock and Hamish through the console room and down an oddly-shaped corridor, then another, and another. Sherlock lost count of the rooms they passed and the number of turns, some off them not left and right but up and down, their center of gravity switching to the point where Sherlock felt dizzily disorientated.
“Wh-what? How will
Once he was gone, Sherlock turned back to Jim with cold and calculating eyes. “Why are you here?”
He turned to leave, but John grabbed his arm, feeling injured. “Why did you have to do that? I mean…you don’t feel anything for me…do you?”
"Mycroft."
"Hm." Sherlock's expression changed from fractious to contemplative, "You have given me something to think about."
"Care to come with me to a crime scene? Might be dangerous..." His tone was wheedling, and I could tell I was being manipulated, but I didn't care.
"So, why don't you ever talk in the hansom?"
"No, but you are a bit of a brat, aren't you?" I mused. Yes, we were going to get along very well, I thought. I trailed my hands down his back again, firmly this time, being sure to activate the muscles on either side of his spine.
I shook my head, "We never discussed it.  We should have.  I'm sorry."
"I do what I am paid to do, Doctor."  She smiled, "Call me Irene, Dear.  But of course, I do have some preferences.  I prefer not to use verbal humiliation, and I prefer advance notice for anything involving urine or feces."
"And you say she was tied with my trademarked items?" She husked, "What makes you think it was me who attended her?"
"I took the liberty of moving in."
Red and Green
"Good enough for now." He smiled when I said it, and I was suddenly aware that I was in this thing a good deal deeper than I'd expected for having just met this man yesterday. "I will ask for colours if I'm not sure, but otherwise I expect you to speak up if you run into something you don't like, okay?"
"Uh?"
"Good. I like kissing." I pulled him down so he was almost sitting on the ledge of the bookshelf and gently licked into his mouth. He whined and pursued me in turn. He was an enthusiastic kisser, though not terribly skilled. I took my time, and he was a quick learner, picking up in skill level astonishingly fast. I got the impression he had perhaps not been kissed too much in the past. I slid a hand behind his head and raked my blunt nails in his scalp, he gasped loudly.
"But how did you know all that? It's amazing."
"Enchanting." I replied.
"Now which is it? Stop teasing, or touch you?"
"Apparently, we're supposed to." I shrugged, "I just won't inhale."
"What you did before, the licking and biting? That was good. Do it again." I whispered into his ear. He shivered and complied, watching me with his big eyes as he worked his way down my chest and to my belly. He smirked as he grazed the other nipple this time and I hissed as quietly as I could. "Let's not have any interruptions this time, yeah?"
"Not a child." He whined, grinding down on the arm of the chair with an unexpected wiggle at the end. My suspicion was confirmed, he was getting off on this. At least his ardour hadn't been put off by the serious conversation.
"Stamford was pretty clear about my having to be in proper dress when I arrived."
I nodded enthusiastically, then paused, "Was it latex?"
"Oh, Heavens yes." I, more fool I, bounded down the stairs after him, his brilliant grin intoxicating and burned forever into my mind's eye. I didn't know where I stood with him, but things couldn't be too bad if he was dragging me along with him on whatever this adventure was going to be.
"No way. I'm not letting you in without direct orders."
She glared a little, "Next time I'm going to introduce you to a friend of mine, I think."
"What's going on here?" The voice from before belonged to a well dressed individual, taller then I and shorter than Sherlock with odd curled sideburns and grey temples. "Holmes. You brought a friend?"
"Yes, seriously." My mouth thinned to a flat line, "You don't like it, we stop right now."
Call Me Irene, Dear
"Now that you mention it, I could really use a rest. I overtaxed it a bit getting here, I think."
"What?"
"Maybe?"  I shook my head, "I had a good time, but it wasn't really about much more than sex, so I guess it really depends."
Delighted, I did. Then I remembered my rules. "Sherlock?"
I paused in my downstroke to wait for permission.
"No." Sherlock wiggled deeper onto my lap, then gasped, "Oh."
"Gentlemen." Her voice was deep and smoky, baritone where I was expecting soprano. "Welcome to my humble establishment. I hear you upset my secretary. I do wish you hadn't done that."
"I don't prefer to be interrupted.  I prefer kinks to be pre-negotiated.  No pegging today as I haven't had a chance to clean up."  I shrugged apologetically, "I imagine you're good at it, but I wasn't actually intending to come here when I left the apartment.  How about you, Ms. Adler?"
"Fair enough." I took a deep breath as his hand closed around me. "Yes."
We had spoken at nearly the same time, and Sherlock's face fell a little. "I suppose I can stand to tidy up a bit." He said.
Irene took one more step away, and turned.  "Good."
I put a finger to his lips, "It's all fine, remember?" I slowly brought myself closer to him, and kissed him, close mouthed. He hid his face in my shoulder, and I felt a little dampness.
We spent that first night cleaning. Eventually around three in the morning, we collapsed into a chair and a sofa respectively and dozed. When I woke in the morning it was to an unexpected weight across my lap. I'm not entirely sure how Sherlock Holmes managed to fall asleep across my lap without waking me up, but there he was, my junk pressed somewhat uncomfortably up into his solar plexus. His ass hung rather enticingly over the chair's overstuffed arm, and my hand was gleefully petting down his spine as I woke. I wasn't quite awake enough to stop immediately, especially when he made a happy little humming noise into my armpit.
He took one look at me, eyes wide and his expression turned stormy.  "You've been to see the Woman!"
"No."
Her eyebrows raised, "Ah, a soldier, then.  I guess we'll just have to try something more direct.  Loose the pants."
"That's not what people usually say."
His hands found the bottom of my sweater vest, and dug roughly into my stomach. I huffed a laugh, "Here, I'll help."
"Work on what?"
He paced back and forth, "I thought we had something.  I guess I thought we were exclusive."
"Is that what you say to all the boys?"
"I want." He set his jaw firmly, and there was a crease between his brows. He set to work, rather faster than I expected, so I may have made a little noise. It only encouraged him, which encouraged me to make more noise, too. He delicately closed his lips around the head and hummed around me.  A jolt of pleasure went through me.
And that was the end of that good mood, I thought ruefully. Sherlock tilted his head at me and made as if to continue.
"Yes." I said, "Yes, this." I tugged him closer by the waistband of his formal slacks, and looked deep into grey eyes, "Is it okay?" I tugged again, more meaningfully this time. He looked confused for a second, then figured it out.
"You're sure?"
The fourth day was Saturday, and as such I could have slept in. Instead I was up at the crack of dawn as usual, and was sitting in my usual chair with the paper, a mug of tea and some breakfast when the door bell rang. Sherlock streaked out of what I assumed was his room and tromped loudly down the stairs. I could hear the conversation as it wafted up the echoey stairs.
“Why do you hate her so much? She’s genuinely trying to make your life more comfortable, and you sulk around like a child. It’s embarrassing.”
John didn’t’ understand how Sherlock did it. They had just time-travelled, and now Sherlock looked as bored as if they had popped out for a coffee at a corner shop. “Only you would call an alien who took us to 1895 ‘impolite.’ Didn’t
“P-please,” John moaned. He moaned a bit louder when Jim pressed his fingers harder inside, then gasped again as Jim yanked the revolver from his pocket and shoved it down John’s throat as he simultaneously withdrew his fingers and then shoved his cock inside of John.
Sherlock stood up, irritably brushing John off. “It wasn’t intentional. I needed a Bichon Frise and Ruby had one readily available.”
“Sherlock, the first time we met…that’s all in here.
"Mm, some might say so," Jack said, buttoning his coat. "If I get some word of him being in your time, I'll give you a call. Maybe I'll call you sooner than that." He grinned at Sherlock again, much to John's irritation.
"Yes, what have you done now?" Mycroft answered impatiently.
Sherlock was finding it hard to keep himself restrained as he looked down at the struggling, flustered doctor. His name sounded so good on those lips. He could keep John here forever, he thought as he trailed his fingers up and down John’s chest.
Sherlock’s eyes flashed. in excitement “There’s a murderer in Belgravia? For how long? How many deaths? What’s the murder weapon?”
John gasped and pressed against him, then laughed, still finding laughter such a surprising thing, then growled into Sherlock’s mouth,  “That’s not funny.” He pushed Sherlock’s shirt off his shoulders, rolling him over slightly to the left and then to the right so he could pull the arms free, then sats up, looking at Sherlock and running his hands up Sherlock’s arms from his wrists down to his chest and stomach, then back up to cup his face. He smiled.
To his surprise, Mycroft didn’t question it. He only nodded and said, “If either of you need anything—“ He nodded again, unable to finish his sentence, then stood up. “If that will be all, I’ve got business to tend to. The car will take you back.”
“The most seen at any given time is four, from what residents have told them.” Lestrade looked at it with interest. “It is a bit eerie, isn’t it? It’d look more fitting in a cemetery.”
John made an almost pained noise and was mortified to feel tears stinging his eyes, he was so happy. He burrowed his head into Sherlock’s shoulder and wrapped his arms around his back, pulling him as close as he could.
John clenched his teeth. “Fine. See you at the flat. Maybe.” He stalked off, furious.
John’s breath quickened. “Yes, sir.”
would be fascinating! A bivascular system! Who knows what about his biology is different? Examining the genetic code would be wonderful…”
After several weeks, John had finally had enough. He stalked over to where Jim was spread on the couch and plucked the laudanum bottle from his hand. “You’re worse than Sherlock, you know that? Get up and stop this.” It had been the first time John had mentioned Sherlock’s name since he’d started working for Jim months ago, but Jim was too out of it to notice.
Over the next week, Sherlock couldn’t help but notice every time John and Mary talked, even if it was a polite greeting, and he couldn’t help but feel an unpleasant twinge at the base of his stomach when John praised her. Was this what jealousy felt like? Such a pointless emotion.
“Left-handed. See how he carries the folder in his right so he can open the door with his dominant hand? The haircut’s the definite giveaway, though. As you noticed, he cuts his own hair, and see how it’s just a bit shorter on the right, as it’s easier for him to reach, and a bit more jagged on the left?”
Sherlock ground his teeth together, unnerved once more by how much the Doctor read into him. “But how do you know? What is your evidence to believe that this universe will be ‘damaged’ if we stay? It’s ludicrous.”
John’s grip on the note weakened as he read it, until the scrap of paper finally fluttered out of his hands. He hoped against reason that someone would pick it up and read it and do something to help, but it was soon muddy and trampled by the other pedestrians.
“Pulled a late one. Typical.” John didn’t look up at Sherlock, but there wasn’t an angry tone in his voice.
Jim’s eyes slid over John’s flushed body. “You didn’t come,” he said, raising an eyebrow.
love with me?”
“So what do we do?”
He dropped out a few bitter drops onto Jim’s tongue, then gave him a glass of water. As Jim drifted back to sleep, John resumed his spot, keeping vigil until Jim had completely lost consciousness.
The Doctor absently stuck his head up the fireplace for a moment. “Bit of soot build-up, nothing hazardous. Now then…the flat upstairs. Has anyone ever lived up there?”
faint.”
A man showed him to a room where Mycroft was waiting and they could talk freely. “What has he done now?” Mycroft asked, motioning for John to sit down.
John straightened and reached behind his back to touch the dampness in the middle of his back. “Dammit,” he murmured, then began unbuttoning his shirt as Jim walked over to him.
John pushed it open slowly, stopping just before the point where it began to creak, and slipped into the townhouse. He silently picked up the gun stored in the desk and began searching the quiet house, his feet noiseless. It wasn’t until he reached the kitchen that he saw Jim, passed out on the floor in a pool of his own blood.
“Ugh, I’m
"I know the place! If you go down now, I should be there by now."
“It’s just…in my dreams—in my nightmares, one of us gets sent back and the other doesn’t. Or in one dream, we got sent to different time periods. I was in 1895, but you weren’t with me, and then I found stories about a 16
There were no animals in sight, but as they reached the final step of the flat, four stone angels were lined up in front of them, staring straight at them, hands outstretched.
Hamish nodded tearily, then finally pulled away, wiping his eyes.
” He craned his neck up towards John and growled, “
, the man he loathed more than anything.
“It means we’re staying the night, and it means you can’t tell peole I’m not actually dying. The fact that John is calling himself a big gay slut is amusing but irrelevant. I highly suggest you lock your flat door tonight.”
“Since when did you care about breaking the law?” John asked. “We’ll play it by ear. I’m not suggesting—“ he lowered his voice, glancing at a security guard watching them curiously. “That was have
It was all absurd, frightening, and undeniably exciting.
“Where are you coming from?” he asked curiously as Jack rose to shook his hand.
He would never, ever tell Sherlock this, of course. Their friendship was invaluable, and if it caused John a bit of private suffering and confusion, so be it. Better than to wreck it by sharing the truth and losing the closest friend he’d ever had.
Sherlock yanked his hands away, letting Jim fall back to his feet, and Jim straightened his suit, annoyed. “We both know this little arrangement can’t last long. I will find you within a day with the whole of Scotland Yard at my back. Child abduction warrants a long jail sentence, even in 1895. Don’t tell me you expect me to let you leave with John and Hamish.”
“I’ve been saving up,” John said, glowing with pride as he watched Sherlock pull out the bow. Sherlock looked down its length before tightening it and running the rosin over the  horsehairs before bringing the violin to his shoulder and lovingly drawing out a few notes, his eyes closed.
Sherlock glared up at him. “I’m not
The bed
It was rare that John heard Sherlock ask that question. “He
…oh, hell, we’ve been through this before. You know how I care about you.” John leaned over and rubbed his forehead with his hand. He wanted so badly to tell Sherlock, to release the overwhelming, churning emotions inside of him, to bring them out of him so he could make some sort of sense from them.
the best option?
Sherlock pulled back, making an annoyed sound. He grabbed the belts from the bed, looping each one around John’s wrists and stretching them apart, tying them around opposite bedposts so that John’s arms were immobile.
The thought of saying goodbye to everything and everyone he knew was too much, and seeing Sherlock sitting calmly in his chair only set him on edge all the more. “You can sit here and—calculate all you want. Honestly, someone should do a Turing test on you,” John muttered, going to grab his laptop and engrossing himself in a shallow blog to get his mind off things.
John stormed out into the street, Sherlock following after. “Oh, right!
“No, it wasn’t that—Mary, you don’t have to leave—“
In addition to the paranoia, Sherlock was getting bored. Aside from the angels, there had been few cases, and now more than ever he needed some good crime to stimulate his mind.
Sherlock finally noticed Hamish from the corner of his eye, and looked over at him.
Hamish’s eyes widened with hurt. “You didn’t…you don’t want me?”
“I am going to kill you,” John panted, his face bright red, then he laughed. “Well. Shall we?”
“Right,” John muttered, then continued filling in details about his and Sherlock’s first case. Eventually Hamish fell asleep by the fire and John carried him upstairs, tucking him into the large four-poster bed, then set about removing the sheets from the furniture and spreading then out on the rug for himself and Sherlock to sleep in. He was still up when Sherlock came home with a black eye.
“We’ll try to be,” Sherlock said.
Tell me what you did with Hamish. Jim, I
“Of course, Mrs. Hudson,” John said.
“I do.” Sherlock picked up the violin from where it rested by the hearth and played a couple of trills before setting it back down.
John gasped. “God, yes.”

“I’ll eat in the kitchen, sir,” Mary said, grabbing her plate. “It was wrong of me to sit here in the first place.”
Torchwood?" John pressed.
“Baker Street, London, 1895,” The Doctor said, merrily pushing them out into the street. “Welcome home!”
“Hamish isn’t my clone, though.” Even now, Hamish was resting his elbows on his knees and his chin on his fists, his brow furrowed in a perfect impression of John.
Mary swallowed. “He died overseas, in India. I only got the news a few weeks ago. How did you know?”
“But the scans--!”
“W-why’re you faking your death…again?”
“Absurd doesn’t even begin to cover it! We’ve been together for less than a month, and he’s a 10-year-old boy! Even if this
Sherlock finally stood up, giving the mostly-bare fireplace mantel a once-over before finally turning to Jim, hands clasped behind his back. “Look at you—positively glowing. In the middle of a new scheme, I take it.” He tilted his head, considering his enemy.
I might need to drop you home for a while…things need checking.”
“Craig and Sophie? You lived with them?” The Doctor knelt on the cobblestones to look Hamish over, touching his shoulder.
Sherlock was delighted. “Fine work—what’s your name?”
" Sherlock stopped, shocked that he was turning up utter blanks on anything remotely logical. He began snorting into uncontrollable laughter. "I have
Jim ripped his wrists away from John, not liking being pinned, and grabbed the sheet in his fists, shuddering at John’s touch.
John could feel Jim’s eyes on him as he examined the bloodstains in the shirt. “How bad is my back?”
“Right. You need to go to bed,” John said, groaning a bit as he stood up.
-century crime solver named Sherlock Holmes, and I knew I’d never see you again.”
Sherlock gave an exhausted chuckle. “Worth it,” he said, then gently took John’s wrist in his and kissed the inside of it.
After some more questions and mutterings about the entire procedure being “most irregular,” the interviewer finally agreed to test John’s skills, provided he came up with new licensure papers in reasonable time.
be able to help. No guarantees. Now leave. Me. Alone. I have work to do."
“Sh-Sherlock, please—“ He begged.
kissed the housekeeper. You’re in the wrong, admit it.”
John raised his eyebrows, but Duncan looked relieved. “Th-thank you! Oh, thank you, sir!”
Hamish frowned, but nodded. John rose and took his hand. “Are you sure you want to do this, Hamish? If you don’t want to come, this might be your last chance to say so. You could go back to live with Craig and Sophie.”
Jim finally turned in his seat to ask boredly, “Something on your mind, Dr. Watson?”
John’s breath caught and he raked his hands across Sherlock’s bum, kissing him again. “I want you inside of me.”
“I do. It’s artwork made by the Coptic Christians back in Egyptian times.”
He spent the next week alerting the homeless network, giving them a description of the bowtied man and the blue box. For days there was nothing, then one day Sherlock came home with a bounce in his step.
“That never gets old!” The Doctor said. He stepped up to John, who hadn’t moved, his eyes wide as he stared up in awe. “How are you faring, Doctor Watson?”
“’Fraid so. Listen to the Doctor. That’s the best advice anyone can give you,” Jack said. “He wouldn’t tell you this without a very good reason.”
“And I found a passable scan that we should be able to—“
"Of course not." Elton poured himself a cup of tea. "He's an alien."
“He’s right; we only just started believing time travel was possible a couple days ago,” John pointed out.
is why I like receiving texts—because you can notify someone when you are running late. You would think that someone who makes their living in…time…would be able to
John smiled at the postscript, then carefully folded the letter away. When he returned to the townhouse, he hid it with his other letters, which were rolled up inside a hollowed-out leg of the bedside table. Their correspondence had been going on successfully for several months now; there were weeks between letters, and the waiting was agonizing, but each brief, scribbled note was worth it.
"I don't know if you can
“…What day is it now, anyway?” John wondered as they stepped back outside.
On their first meeting, the Doctor said, he had lifted a hair off Sherlock’s coat and had attempted to create a DNA replication in the TARDIS.
John couldn’t think of a suitable answer, so he remained silent, beginning to explore the upstairs. His bedroom was fairly large, and two doors away from what John assumed was Moriarty’s bedroom. He took mental notes of which floorboards creaked, and began testing Moriarty’s door for creakiness, seeing how easy it would be to sneak in during the night and possibly try to kill him.
him.” Jim locked his eyes with John’s. “I want you. I need a replacement for Sebastian. You’re an army man, a good shot, used to following orders, not a complete idiot—at least going by
Mycroft set his glass of scotch on a small table beside him, not bothering to look up from his book. “Glad to see you alive. Thank you
Within a week, Sherlock had lapsed back into an addiction. He didn’t go out anymore, not even to St. Bart’s. He spent hours on end lying on the sofa or plucking listlessly at his violin, feeling morose and stagnant.
“You’re not obliged to hang around me, John, if you find me so ‘freakish,’” Sherlock said, his voice like acid.
The feel of John coming inside him sent Sherlock over the edge as well, and he came just after John, intense waves of pleasure washing through him. He fell limply into the mattress, gasping for air as John pulled out and crawled next to him, giving him a shaky, wet kiss. “We had a…lot of lost time to make up for…”
Sherlock waved to a seat, annoyed, then sat himself in his chair.
They stared at him in shock, neither knowing what to say.
“By all means, continue your dinner,” Sherlock said, then disappeared into his and John’s room, knowing John wouldn’t follow him while Mary was around. Irritated and somewhat injured, he buried himself in some case accounts he was re-writing, all the while listening to John’s and Mary’s conversation. John was being his usual charming self, perhaps not meaning to be flirtatious but coming off that way anyway. It felt like ages before the sounds of dinner plates being stacked and cleared filled the next room and the door to the flat finally opened and closed.
“I’m 9 and a half!” Hamish laughed. “Same as when I saw you at Craig and Sophie’s!”
“Am I…am I…
“That’s exactly what I expect. I’ve got people watching you, Sherlock. I’ve told them to keep an eye on you and if you start getting too curious, or looking too hard, you’ll be killed.”
They finally turned and silently headed up the stairs to the flat.
“…I might not be around to. It’s complicated, but Sherlock’s made requests for me to…go somewhere should he…die.” John was alarmed to find himself growing emotional, even though he knew Sherlock wasn’t really sick.
Sherlock was right, of course. John nodded slowly, pressing his lips together. “I wish we had more time to give him. I wish we had more time to get to know him.”
in Victorian London?”
The interviewer was well impressed with John’s medical background, which he’d been mostly truthful with, changing a few dates and details to fit the time period.
And that’s when Magnussen pulled away completely, leaving John panting and desperate. John made a needy noise through the gag, and Magnussen smiled, stepping behind the kneeling, panting man. He pulled a napkin from his pocket and wiped his hands. “…And sometimes it doesn’t even take a touch,” he said to Sherlock, then leaned down to John’s ear, so close that his lips brushed them. His voice was intimate, but it was loud enough for Sherlock to hear.
“ He grabbed the purse. “—Thank you, Hamish—we can hopefully afford some proper attire for you, and possibly get a…cab ride.” He eyed a passing carriage.
a dick. That didn’t stop me from falling for you immediately.”
Sherlock clenched his jaw and closed his eyes against the bright white surroundings. He had always hated hospitals, hated being reminded of the frailty his human body. What if John actually found something? The prospect of his own mind turning on him was one of his darkest fears. It was a long thirty minutes before John was finally done scanning.
doesn’t mean I wasn’t interested in the opposite gender.”
“It better not, or I’ll cut out your tongue.” Jim said the words lightly, but John shivered, knowing that he meant them. “Gannon and O’Seanassy will go with you. Clean up
“It’s the
“Ooh, so many insults. Whatever happened to ‘fantastic!’ and ‘amazing!’?” Sherlock asked.
“Dad? Can you wear the hat?” Hamish pointed at the deerstalker resting on the angel.
Sherlock smiled, resisting the urge to kiss him, and Hamish clamped a hand over his mouth to stifle his giggling.
“Does it say anything about any events in his life in 1895?”
“You need to eat too, Sherlock.” John ran a hand along Sherlock’s ribcage.
John began to laugh, shaking his head.
“Pocket universe, remember?” The Doctor said amiably. “You have to meet the angels before you get sent back in time. And you
Sherlock frowned at the two of them, stepping to stand a bit possessively by John.
“You mean like Mr. Holmes? I can’t imagine him ever marrying.”
me like that? How long’ve you—“ He cut himself off and kissed Sherlock again.
make you watch.”
century was the reputation he’d built up over the years. It had taken a long time building up the connections with the Yard, getting the privilege to enter crime scenes, to give his opinions and look at evidence. It was driving him mad, being a nobody in the detective world.
been?! That job should’ve been done
the usual throat-slitting.” He looked over at Hamish, realizing he should have held his tongue in the company of the young boy, but Hamish was hanging to his every word. Sherlock, too, was engrossed.
“Going where? To the crime scene?! You must be raving mad!”
him from self-abuse.
Jim seemed surprised when John came back so quickly, wearing the same graven face as before. “He’s dead.”
The Doctor smiled and snapped his fingers, and the door of the TARDIS swung open on its own. He leaned with it and half-fell inside. “Come on, then.”
John hurriedly tucked it back in, his face no less red, as the boy finished, “And the fact that you’re hanging around in the boring old ivory work room’s sort of a giveaway.”
He didn’t expect the gentle, gliding touch of Jim’s fingers as they ran up John's back and stroked the nape of his neck.  Jim leaned down to whisper in John's ear, a regretful tinge in his voice, “It really upsets me that you went behind my back, Johnny Boy…I thought we could trust each other. Now I have to teach you a lesson.”
John was already grabbing his coat. “A case? Where?”
John was overwhelmed, delirious with pleasure and hardly able to believe that this was all really happening. He came with a strangled groan.
will be…”
Jim looked down at him, unsatisfied with the indirectness of John's statement. “Stand up.” John was disgusted at how his heart hammered as he obeyed. He turned to face Jim, who locked eyes with him. “I need a 'yes' or a 'no.' Do. You.
“You have no idea. I just feel lucky he hasn’t driven away our most excellent housekeeper...”
"We've been off the research for a long while, but we can't help but notice when Doctor-related news pops up…and we've been hearing this name Torchwood come up. Somehow the two are related, but we haven't been able to find any information on it, other than it's a government organization for 'security matters.' Sounds like alien business, if you ask me," Elton said.
“It’s just…your surname’s Watson…and mine’s Holmes-Watson, and what with you two snogging and all I thought—“ The boy looked up at them both, his eyes wide and full of hope. There was fear there, too, as if worried of being let down.
“Yeah, and I told you I wasn’t!” John said. His heart was hammering. Sherlock had suspected this whole time, and hadn’t said anything? “I’ve had
John drew back to look at Sherlock’s face, examining every feature. “Yes. We get to go home.”
“Sorry to disobey, but no. You pay me to protect you, so that’s what I’m doing. Good night.” John tossed his pillow on the ground and lay down, rolling the blanket around him.
As they stepped outside the flat, a handsome man in a blue wool coat spun around to look at them expectantly.
” He kissed John again, sliding his tongue into his mouth and ran his hands down John’s back and slowly slipped them into the back of John’s trousers, gently grabbing at his bare skin.
“It’s the Doctor, of course,” Sherlock seethed. He hated that he couldn’t get in contact with the Doctor when he needed him. It was utterly irresponsible not to let them know that they had a precocious cocktail of their DNA material wandering around London. Unless the Doctor who visited
“Did you see how he narrows his eyes at people, and those little half-smile smirks he does? And the eyebrow raises? You all over,” John said on the cab ride over.
was not going to be taken in by this monster. “What happens if I kill you right now? No mobile phones or computer codes to signal your lackeys.”
“Right,” John said shakily. His heart was hammering.
“M-more—“ Sherlock gasped.
my dear! As much as I could go on about how amusing that is, I really must be off. We wouldn’t want my men to think you’d done something nasty to me and prematurely slit John’s throat, would we? How embarrassing!”
Sherlock stared at the ceiling. “We tell people we’re going to die—or that one of us is dying. That way they know we’re gone and won’t bother looking for us.”
The Doctor sat back. “When I found you in the 21
A month of very cautious investigation led John to the key name: Burke. Burke was the one assigned to kill John should John kill Moriarty. Of this John was fairly certain. John began watching Burke closely, assessing his style, finding his weaknesses.
“You really shouldn’t tell him this, his ego’s already too big for this flat. I’d rather not upsize,” John said.
Jim stepped forward until he and John were nearly touching. “Everything.” Jim began unbuttoning John's trousers himself, a small smile spreading on his lips. Once they were unbuttoned, Jim yanked them down to his knees and turned away to begin removing his tie. “Finish taking those off and get on the bed, kneeling, head down.”
“You’re thinking. About what?”
“See, John and I hadn’t even known each other nine and a half years ago, which leads me to deduce that time travel must have been involved. That’s all we know so far,” Sherlock finished.
The boy tilted his head to the side a bit and blinked up at him. “Both your lips are swollen, your cheeks are pink and it’s not cold outside today, or windy, so why is your hair all mussed? And
am, the happier
Grinning, Hamish pulled a decently filled coin purse from his jumper.
Sherlock closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling even as he warned with clenched teeth, “
“Thank you,” Sherlock said after a moment’s pause. “Leave your information with John. We’ll be in touch.” He rose, taking the drawing, and without a backwards glance disappeared to his room.
, John thought.
John moved carefully out of bed to avoid waking up Sherlock and showed Hamish how to work the toaster oven, wondering in the back of his mind how one went about toasting bread without electricity. Coal ovens?
John couldn't help laugh along with him. "That's it then! We've both gone mad. Something in the sugar, maybe?"
“Yes, that’s right, struggle,” Jim laughed, bucking against him, then dug a fingernail into one of John’s fresh wounds, just above his bicep. John let out a wounded cry. “Cooperating quietly is such a yawn.” He licked John’s blood from his finger. “Yum.”
John stiffened. He didn’t want to relive that night.
“Reynolds, young man. The second. So you’re Sherlock Holmes,” he said, looking up.
Sherlock went to his wardrobe for the first time in weeks to find clothes that weren’t pyjamas, and John pulled on the clothes he already had.
“The universe will continue cracking and crumbling around you, and if you stay too long, you won’t be able to go back if you wanted to. Just being here now is making me uncomfortable. We’re on the brink of nonexistence. The next time the angels come, don’t try to stop them.”
Together they carried the man through the kitchen, Jim snatching a half-empty bottle of wine on the way out. They dumped the body in the back alley, making sure not to be seen. Jim propped him up against the wall, then opened the wine and poured some into the man’s mouth, not caring when it sloshed down the man’s front, then put the bottle in his hand. He stepped back to admire the setup for a moment, then turned to walk back in the house, satisfied.
The Doctor held up a badge that looked very much blank to John and Sherlock. “Fireplace inspectors, mind if we come in?” He pushed his way in despite the woman’s protests. “City mandated, won’t be a moment!”
Sherlock frowned. “I knowingly put myself in dangerous situations, John. You don’t have to try to protect me.”
“So you really
Sherlock sat back in his chair. “I’ll take the case.”
Sherlock’s brain whirled as he tried to keep up and make sense out of it all. Moriarty. Alive. Here, in 1895. It was even more impossible than himself and John being here.
"I haven't the

“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock said, “and this is Doctor John Watson. Are you Craig?”
The Doctor snatched the book out of his hands. “Perhaps
Sherlock sat on the bed next to John and shrugged off his waistcoat, dropping his tie to the floor. He slowly and hesitantly slid his tongue out to meet John's lips, but doesn't move it farther.
“Going to the cinema…not catching horrible diseases. God, do you know how rubbish medicine was in Victorian London?”
“Did you know doctors during this time only made £100-200 a
Hamish considered the heap of clothes and books on the bed. “I can use a smaller bag if I have to. When you get moved ‘round so much, you learn to only pick your best and favorite stuff to take with you.”
“Upstairs. Here, we’ll take your suitcase up—“ John started, but Hamish had already bolted up the stairs to look.
It sunk in then. Sherlock would never see his pompous older brother again, and the thought bothered him far more than he had predicted. “No. This is—“he swallowed. “This will be it.”
Jim squealed with joy at Sherlock’s reaction, some taunting laughter escaping his lips. He shrugged as best as he could, pinned as he was. “All right, you’ve caught me…I
Sherlock only paused for a quick breath of air before he began hungrily kissing John back, ripping his jacket off and pulling him closer.
“You’ve really got to stop these self-destructive tendencies…they’re not at all attractive.” John licked at Sherlock’s ear, biting it lightly, moved up to kiss his mouth again.
” Sherlock demanded, then dropped his head back onto the pillow.
He was enthralled, writing down everything, muttering things like, “Oh! Brilliant. Tell me again what you thought of him when you first met him?”
John and Sherlock shook his hand in turn, still unable to get over the impossibility standing in front of them. John glanced at the teacher before leaning down to Hamish. “Where do Sophie and Craig live? We have some questions for them.”
Sherlock continued playing. “Yes.”
It wasn’t until the fifth day in Dublin that Jim gave John his first assignment.
He had to look away when Magnussen’s fingers trailed to John’s straining erection. He couldn’t bear to watch John’s face flush beneath the blindfold and the gag, to see his wrists strain against the handcuffs and to hear his sharp intake of breath at the touch.
“Yes,” Craig stammered. “He pops in every now and then. If it wasn’t for him, Sophie and I never would’ve…”
?” John fumed, and Sherlock smiled.
but a clone combining the DNA of both you and Watson. This created, essentially, well…a child. Of sorts.”
, Dad,” he whispered.
?” He couldn’t help but feel a bit pleased.
“For once…” John said. “Just for
Why, for
John held Hamish for a while before speaking, relieved that he was here and safe. He tried to get words to come out, but the lie got caught in his tongue. Jim rolled his eyes, unseen by Hamish, and took a knee next to Hamish.
Molly nodded, then said after a pause, “So you two finally got together, then.”
“Thank you, boss. You know I would do just about anything for you…right, Jim?” John hoped he wasn’t pushing things too far.
John wanted nothing more than to punch the last fragment of life out of Jim, but he forced himself to stand up, wincing and clutching his stomach. “I’m sorry you’re bored, boss, but these stints always end. Something new always turns up.”
John weakly lifted his head up to nod, then flopped back onto the pillow in frustration, practically shouting through his gag.
Jim, pleased with John’s speedy response, gave John a few more jerks, then gripped John’s hips. He bent down and ran his tongue from between John’s shoulder blades, up along his neck to his ear. “
Sherlock didn’t respond to John’s words, even though they bruised. He stayed in his chair and thought. When he came to bed that night, John was lying awake on his side.
Jim looked down at himself as if seeing the blood for the first time. His lip curled in disgust. “No…” He ran a finger across on one of the stains, which hadn’t dried, then looked at his red hand. “I
“Where’s Hamish, my son, Hamish?” John babbled. “Hamish Watson…please—“
“Good luck, Sherlock!” the Doctor grinned. “I’ll cross my fingers that a brilliant head-scratcher comes your way!”
He tore his eyes away and rolled out of bed himself. “This whole flat smells like it needs a thorough cleaning—been keeping Mrs. Hudson out?”
“As intriguing as it is, I fail to see the issue,” Sherlock said. “Who cares if he doesn’t publish a book of stories? It’s not as if people will know what they’re missing, and I hardly impact the world for the worse. You’ve been to 2012, you’ve
“Don’t play dumb. If I thought you were
“Clean. Efficient. Good. You can have the rest of the day off. I don’t need you for anything else at the moment.”
John weakened in his arms, melting into him as they held the kiss. He'd almost forgotten a kiss could be a gentle, mutual thing instead of a painful conquest, and he started crying all over again, grasping at Sherlock's arms and leaning limply against him.
” he seethed.
“Mycroft is Sherlock’s brother. Feel lucky that you’ll never have to meet him.” John couldn’t imagine Mycroft liking children, even a clever nephew. He zipped up the suitcase. “There! Are you sure you packed everything?”
This made John falter for a moment.
“Have you tried Mary’s rolls? She’s like Mrs. Hudson, except ten times better…and less nosy.”
John felt
“Until the money from my job starts coming in, we’re going to be in a tight spot,” John said, looking up at Sherlock. “Pick-pocketing might have to do us for a while, unless you happen to catch a criminal and collect a reward.”
in 1895, therefore cannot stop existing there. Your logic is ludicrous.”
doing?”
decision, not mine. I made him an offer he couldn’t refuse.”
“Molly, you must trust that we have good reason to believe what we do,” Sherlock said, meeting her eyes.
“Do you mean the blogs?” John asked.
Jane, startled by the fervency and anguish in John’s voice, nodded. She blinked back a few tears of her own. Of course she wanted to keep her son away from Jim, and she knew all too well what it was like to miss her love. She sniffed and gave another nod. “All right. All right, sir…I can help…what exactly did you want me to do?”
fine. Why’re you…high right now?”
? How could you not tell that I’ve wanted you since
John laughed and straightened the hat on the statue. They did indeed look a lot less menacing now, and John’s heart lifted at the encouraging thought that they’d beaten these two stone angels. “So, is that it, then? We can tell people your aneurysm magically cleared up?”
Later that night, after Jane had cleared up the dinner table and had gone home for the evening, Jim was writing a letter at his desk and John was reading. He had taken to reading much more in his free time, eager for any sort of fictional escape. A knock on the front door echoed through the room, and they turned to look at each other. Jim raised his eyebrows and turned back to his writing, leaving John to answer it.
“Yeah, Dad, it’s just a game,” Hamish said, moving his piece into the conservatory.
Jim frowned at him, giving him an annoyed look. “No. Why would I need anything from you? I told you, you’ve got the day off. Go…rescue wounded puppies or pick flowers in a park or do whatever it is that you ordinary people do without your precious tellys and laptops.”
to work.”
John didn't bat an eye, but he knew something was wrong. Maybe he
It only took an overlay of the two brain scans and a rescan to create a fairly passable new scan that made it look like Sherlock had a prominent aneurysm. “That should fool Mycroft,” John said as they hurried out the hospital doors and into the busy London street. “I hope you’re happy. Now everyone here is going to think I’m a big gay slut,” John muttered as he handed the finished scan to Sherlock.
“I didn’t know—“ Sherlock kissed John again, dragging him towards the bedroom. “And then—you pulled away—I thought you didn’t—
John drew his mouth away and looked up at Jim.
“You sure? Tonight?” John managed to say before Sherlock found his lips again, although he didn’t know how he was going to be able to stop at this point. Sherlock’s insistent kisses and caresses and totally disarmed John and he was far too worked up to want to stop now.
Since John’s and Hamish’s absence, Sherlock had buried himself in his work, obsessively compiling notes on deduction, cataloguing common mannerisms, analyzing minutiae, anything to keep his mind off how much he missed John and his son. During the first month, he’d spent all of his energy on potential rescue plans, but they had all fallen through, so now he lost himself in his work and spoke little with Mary or Arthur.
“It doesn’t matter.”
Over the next hour, Sherlock showed Hamish how to hold the violin, and how to grasp the bow, steering his arm, letting him play a few notes. Soon Hamish was awkwardly holding the large violin by himself, experimentally sawing at the strings.
The older Holmes brother leaned back in the leather chair and crossed on leg over the other, steepling his fingers. His voice was soft when he asked, “You’ll inform me if…anything happens?”
“So you stole money to take me suit shopping?”
Sherlock continued to tap his fingers on the wall, not looking at John. “There is…one way. A physical reaction. An experiment.”
Hamish nodded his tear-stained face into John’s shoulder, wrapping his arms tightly around his neck. His breath hitched. “It’s not fair! I finally got my dads! It’s not fair, it’s not—“ his mumblings became less coherent as he sobbed into John’s shoulder, his face red and his nose running.
John returned with an elderly gentleman, who looked around the flat warily before sitting in the chair John offered him.
He stalked over to the kitchen table and upturned it in a swift, violent movement, getting only mild satisfaction as it hit the wooden floor with a thudding crash.
“You know, John, I
When Sherlock called the number of Jack Harkness, it took several tries before a boisterous American voice answered. "Y-ello?"
the man was quick.
“Mm. Children are remarkably resilient, based on my observations,” Sherlock said, sinking into his chair.
Even so, John and Sherlock's relationship needed mending. John was hesitant to get too physically close right away, which Sherlock didn't press.
They hailed a cab to Westminster, getting out at Trafalgar Square, and walked amidst the tourists to the Thames, silent the whole way. John watched the double-decker busses and police cars and cabs and felt a pang. He missed everything already.
Sherlock was walking around to take everything in, muttering time travel theories to himself.
Sophie was home before the hour was out, and Craig explained the situation. John and Sherlock lagged outside the living room as Craig and Sophie said their goodbyes to Hamish.
I’ve been stupid, Mary, so bloody stupid. He has the advantage now, but he is not going to come out on top. He can’t.”
The Doctor waved as she left. “Lovely woman, your landlady. Almost makes me wish I had a landlady.” He turned to Sherlock, looking
? You write books and things? Have you written anything that I’ve read?”
“Unlock your door. John and I are coming over,” he said, then hung up. He grabbed John’s hand and they headed out of the hospital and down the street. Molly’s flat was only a few streets away, and when they let themselves into her flat, Molly was standing tiredly in a robe and slippers, looking concerned.
“What happens in the morning when everyone’s out on the streets again? Then it won’t be able to move at all, and we can, I dunno, smash it or something.” John’s eyes watered as he continued to stare down at it, wide-eyed. The morning was ages away.
Jim rolled onto his back and pulled the knife from the bed. He held it up to the morning night streaming through the windows, turning it to let the light bounce off the blade and dance along the walls. “No. I guess not.”
As Sherlock pushed John’s legs apart and brushed his fingers teasingly over John’s aching cock, John groaned loudly, twitching his hips up towards Sherlock, and slid his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders, unable to keep from touching him anymore.
It was easier for John to cope if he gave Moriarty a title besides “tormentor” or “arch enemy.” Jim bought John a wardrobe of fine clothes and saw that he was fed nourishing meals to keep him healthy. John had tried a brief stint of starvation, but that was quickly extinguished with the usual threats. Now John cleaned his plate and was doing push-ups every morning, his old military routine. It was easier to think of himself as a soldier again, not asking too many questions, not letting morals creep into his head.
“Me too.”
John thought back to the “hound” from Baskerville. They’d had experience with scary beasts people “saw” before.
When Mary had cleared up after dinner, John pulled her aside in the hallway and explained quietly that the reason she and he couldn’t be together was because John was in love.
“Let me alone! You’re going to give me an asthma attack, you inconsiderate berk!”
In the first message, her voice was chipper.
"Sorry, 926? Is that an age he's likely to be?"
“I am
Mary looked at the two men with a new level of respect, which quickly faded when Sherlock asked conversationally, “So, when did your husband die? No more than a month, surely?”
Jane hardly had all of the details of Jim and John’s arrangement, but she knew that John was being held against his will and that he wasn’t to communicate with anyone outside Jim’s circle. Her voice caught nervously as she stammered, “You-you know you’re not supposed to be sending out mail, sir…I-I…” She put down her vegetable knife, her hands shaking as she thought of what Moriarty would do to her. “…I don’t know, sir…I’m sorry…if Mr. Moriarty found out…I…” She looked at the floor.
“You saved the universe, Sherlock. I hope that doesn’t inflate your head too much.” The Doctor tousled Hamish’s hair.
Mycroft nodded, mulling this over. “I-I, um…” he heaved a sigh and rolled his eyes. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I know I was never the most. Well, I’ve always tried to look out for you, even if—hm.” He gave up on his floundering sentence, closing it with a tight smile.
“Tell me John,” Jim said, keeping the barrel in place, “How do you feel right now?”
"Sherlock. Do you really need to do this?" John muttered, rubbing his thumb between his eyes, but Sherlock barreled on.
Sherlock clicked on the page and squinted at some blurry photographs. Did crackpots simply refuse to focus their camera lenses when they took photos? "This isn't the same man. He doesn't fit Duncan's description," Sherlock said.
“He’s the one I was telling Arthur about...the one who made Sherlock fake his own death,” John put in.
He waltzed out, leaving Sherlock standing in shock. When Jim reached the bottom of the steps, he sidled up to Mary, who was listening fearfully, her face blanched. He touched her chin so that she was staring up at him, then ran his thumb softly along it. “If you value your life, dear, I wouldn’t recommend letting anyone in or out of that door for a while.” He smirked as Mary shuddered, taking his hat from her trembling hands, then strolled out of 221B whistling.
John fought the urge to point out that he took things all the time. He had taken his son, his freedom, the crown jewels, men's lives. This wasn't the moment to contradict Jim, however.
“We could run,” Sherlock said. “Hail a cab, keep our eyes on it until we’re well away. Not a permanent solution, of course.” But it was the only one he could think of at the moment.
“You once told me you’ve always trusted me. So trust me when I say that ‘fine’ people don’t shut out the world and take opium for weeks on end. You’re depressed, and this isn’t helping.”
John read through the letter several times, scrutinizing the unmistakable handwriting, and finding himself tearing up over idiotic things, like how tightly Sherlock hooked his ‘G’s. He kissed the letter then pulled the fresh sheets he’d stowed for writing to Sherlock and wrote,
Sherlock had moved one of the chairs near the fireplace, precisely where his former chair sat. He was sitting in it now, scanning the paper for any sort of crime. Other than a recurring, frustrating dead-end involving an enigmatic professor, there wasn’t anything exciting so far. “New waistcoat,” he remarked, looking up at John. He hadn’t spent much time with John during the past few days, since they’d both been busy. “Any other news?”
He drew the gun out slowly, then pushed it back in, beginning to fuck John’s mouth with it, never losing his grip in John’s hair.
Elton sat, stunned as they aways did, before finally spluttering, "How-how did you—"
“Hm. Clearly.” Sherlock dipped his head to kiss him, savoring the feel and taste of John’s lips, both of which were entirely unique sensations that he found himself growing increasingly addicted to.
John blinked rapidly, his heart hammering. Sherlock didn’t care about him like this. Why was he tormenting him? “That’s not a fair question…either way I answer, it looks…bad.” He licked his lips, equally wanting and dreading for Sherlock to continue moving closer.
If you’re going to rely on logic for everything you’ll miss so much. I’ve been to London in this era before. You can buy Sherlock Holmes books in any bookstore. There’s a statue of you--in that hat—outside the Baker Street tube station.” He points to the deerstalker sitting on John’s chair. “221b Baker Street is an address everyone knows and flocks to. Except now all of that’s gone, so either I’m in the wrong universe- again- or time is being extraordinarily naughty.”
Sherlock stood silently, fingers steepled and pressed against his lips. He took a deep breath and cast a steely look at the Doctor. “All right. This isn’t…logical or probable, but here it is. So…so what?”
At the word “angel”, Sherlock bolted for 221B, phone still pressed to his ear. “Keep your eyes on it, John, but call Mrs. Hudson—you’ll need to blink before I can get there. Ask them where they came from. Obviously she won’t know, but she’ll stick around to have a good look at them.” He pocketed his phone as he rounded the corner. Only one more street to the flat.
“Not long. Maybe a year? He spent a bit of time with Mr. and Mrs. Williams, and with this nice old man named Wilfred. He’s been moved around a lot, I’m afraid, but in good homes. And he’s gotten a good education. He’s so smart, that one, that he got into a really good school. He might be too smart, sometimes.”
and you two have no business getting pulled into it. ...
“No. We’re leaving London to live somewhere else.” John didn’t want to admit that he had no idea where. “Come on.” He helped Hamish to his feet, then stood up himself. He looked down at the small boy. He was so young. Too young for everything he’d already felt and lost in life. He knew it would be worse to tell Hamish the truth and watch him die, but at the moment it was hard to imagine anything worse than breaking his son’s heart.
John nodded and joined the three men as Jim listed off the men he wanted taken care of and the people who needed to be threatened. As always, Jim wanted the job done quickly, demanding their return in a week. This gave them a scanty two days in London, but it would be enough time for John.
That weekend, Hamish came home from school gushing about his favorite professor.
“Nobody will ever believe us,” John muttered.
Listen to him, Lestrade. Get everyone out of here, away from these things,” John said.
“All of it.” Sherlock gave John a sad smile. “I was in the kitchen with Jane. I fear I might have disturbed her.”
Sherlock watched him, kissing his eyelids and lips gently. He’d spent so many nights alone that it seemed impossible that John was really here next to him. He almost didn’t want to fall asleep in fear that John wouldn’t be here when he woke up, as illogical as it was. “…Goodnight, John,” Sherlock murmured, his eyelids drooping despite his efforts.
“Okay. We need to get out of this flat. We’re both jumpy and irritated, and a bit of fresh air will do us good.”
After a silent ride, only punctuated by the occasional question about the case from Sherlock, they arrived at the crime scene and Sherlock stepped to look around it. It had been a grisly business, the deaths.
“So...how do you want me?” He looked up to meet Sherlock's eyes, awaiting orders as he began to unbutton his own shirt.
The organization's webpage was an obnoxious, low-budget website, with unbearable gifs and a silly acronym-"London Investigation 'N Detective Agency"—but there were dozens of images of the blue police box, not only from photographs, but from paintings, stretching back throughout history.
"Don't be dramatic," Sherlock snorted. "All I was is a
He flopped onto the pillow, turning his back to the center of the bed.
“Yes, well Mycroft won’t be born to eat pastries for several more decades,” John jabbed back, then immediately regretted it.  Sherlock hadn’t talked about Mycroft since they’d come to live in 1895.
“If you’d like to try, I can show you. I’m likely a bad teacher, though. Come here.”
The next day, when John informed Jim that he was to stay in bed and rest, Jim let a steady string of curses fly at him, but followed his orders and stayed in bed, grumbling about boredom and work and taking more laudanum than he could possibly need.
Sherlock couldn’t help but find it amusing when John ranted. He got so worked up over the most trivial things. “I don’t believe
“We’ll discuss it later, but until later notice, you’re coming home with us,” Sherlock said.
“I heard you were up and I brought some freshly baked croissants.” She entered carrying the plate of pastries just as Hamish slipped into Sherlock’s bedroom. “How’s your head, Sherlock?”
been talking to? Torchwood's not a name you casually throw around."
When the MRI was finished and the image had processed, John pulled him over to look. “Here’s your brain. Looks healthy from what I can tell, although this isn’t really my area.” Sherlock couldn’t help breathe a sigh of relief.
“Do you think St. Bart’s is hiring?” John asked. He knew that St. Bartholomew’s hospital was at least still around. It was the oldest hospital in London.
"You see, Mr. Holmes. There are thigns far stranger than we ever imagined out there. And here! This is the kind of thing that happens when you run with the Doctor," Elton said.
“I’m sorry!” Mary finally said. “That was—I shouldn’t have—“
John glared over at him, even though he knew Sherlock was only speaking logical.
Sherlock slammed the door behind them, and John pulled away long enough to say, “You started smoking again. Idiot,” before pressing his mouth back to Sherlock’s, pressing into him.
things. Now SIT!”
John leafed through it. It was the strangest thing to skim through events so similar to his life, written by someone who sounded and thought like him, except from over a century earlier and written by a strange man. John finally put the book on the console.
John gave Sherlock a sideways look. Sherlok kept his face stoic as he asked, "Of course. Where from?"
, going by his dress, stature, name, and the way he looked around our untidy flat in distaste, do you remember?" Sherlock paced back and forth. "And he wouldn't come to me if he'd seen someone who simply reminded him of the man he saw during the Blitz.
Once they were situated in a sitting room which seemed designed solely for housing a myriad of sofas, settees, divans and couches from all different eras, Sherlock was able to focus back on the most important question, the one that had been bothering him since he’d first heard Hamish’s name.
a six.” He let out a long, loud sigh. “I’m bored, John. Bored!”
The Doctor sidled around the statues, admiring them and keeping his tone conversational. “Love the hats. Clever you, trapping them like this. You did your research.” He fixed his deep-set, old-looking eyes on Sherlock and the casual tone disappeared. “But you can’t keep running. I can send you back myself, you know. If it comes to that.” He locked eyes with John now, and John felt the weight of his words. So they really were doomed, then, to be sent back. At that moment, John knew they weren’t going to win this one.
“I’m not that drunk! The point is…I would do anything to save you, Sherlock. If you died, Sherlock, died for
Jim laughed once more, utterly pleased by Sherlock’s response. He shook his head and smiled. “Oh, Sherlock, Sherlock.” Jim’s eyes flashed. “I don’t want
Sherlock came out a minute later, fully dressed, and stepped over to give John a little kiss while Hamish’s back was turned.
Jim squeezed his eyes shut and clenched his teeth. “Yes.”
don’t. The stories are hardly identical.”
“You’ll tell him, John,” Sherlock said. “He would never believe me if I told him in person.”
Hope you're enjoying it! Since I already have this story typed up and am only making small adjustments as I go, I'm aiming to post a new chapter every day. If I stay on schedule, the fic should be complete by January 26! Hooray! Reviews are appreciated, as always :)
"Follow me, Doctor."  She turned, and said over her shoulder to Madeline, "See that we aren't disturbed."
"What can I say? I have sensitive skin." I shrugged the shirt over my shoulders, but Sherlock leaned down over me before I could get my arms free.
"Red." I said firmly. He pouted, stood up in a huff, grabbed his shirt and stormed into a room I hadn't seen the night before, slamming the door behind him. I rolled my eyes, straightened my trousers and pulled the sweater vest over my head just as there came another nock,
"Do you intend to see the woman again?"
"Sherlock! Let go. I have to pee."
"Splendid." He pressed into me and let his teeth run over my neck. I must have made a sound, because he pulled away, looking concerned, "It's okay?"
"Very well.  Lick me till I cum."
"Oh, him."  Sherlock shrugged, "You wanted to know about the boilerplate.  You could have asked me.  I have a copy, in the Encyclopedia Britannica, volume three."
"You're thinking too much, again."  She scolded, putting a nail between my eyes and pushing gently.  "Let's see what we can do about that, shall we?  Marks okay?"  When I nodded, she dragged her fingernails down my face, leaving what were probably livid lines behind.  Not what I'd expected, I admit, but certain parts of me were certainly on board, and Irene laughed not unkindly when my hips twitched up a little involuntarily.
"Don't worry, Doctor Watson.  Mr. Holmes informed me that you might be by soon."
"Three, actually, so far." Sherlock looked strangely pleased, "We have our very own serial killer, right here is London Village."
"Well, now that you two are acquainted, I had better go." I had forgotten that Stamford was still there, actually. "The missus will be expecting me."
He ambitiously tried to take me to the root and came up spluttering. Where I had managed not to laugh before, I failed now.
"Oh." Sherlock regarded the teapot's contents and nodded, "Yes, that's fair."
"If I touch it, will it cause you pain?"  She took the last step toward me, looking up the half a head or so to my eyes.
"Very well.  Are you here for an appointment?  We usually prefer if you book in advance."
He looked smug, "I've barely touched you."
"Thank you." Sherlock gave her a beaming smile, and I felt a little twinge of unwelcome emotion.
"Hm?"
"Imagine you are doing this for yourself, and start there."
"Nice to meet you." I sighed as the door closed behind her. Well, so much for that encounter. And it had been going so well.
"Mmhm."
Madeline was wearing powder blue today, I noted.  She glanced around furtively, "Alone today, Sir?"
"Touch me! Stop teasing!"
My lips pursed and as soon as our yellow-dressed friend had left, I hissed at Sherlock, "Did you just take us to a serial killer's place of business?" I had no illusions as to what type of institution Ms. Adler was at this point. Clearly she ran some form of sexual services out of this building. What I didn't understand was why someone would have willfully left a crime scene so clearly implicating themselves behind.
Anthea raised an eyebrow, "Don't you want to hear the rate?"
I took a deep breath, "Yes Ma'am."   Then I paused, reconsidered, and asked, "Is Ma'am okay?  What are your pronouns?"
Yes Mistress
He frowned, "No. Fine. Red is stop, yellow is slow, green is go. Got it."
For three days I didn't see Sherlock at all. I don't know if he was holed up in his room sulking or if he had snuck out each morning before I was awake, but either way I was busy enough that I didn't spare too much concern for the situation. During the day I went to the hospital and treated minor ailments and injuries, and in the evenings I read the newspaper in a comfortable chair in the living room. I quickly learned to wash any dishes or kitchen implements before using them, which wasn't really such a hardship in the end.
"Yes. Very good." I confirmed. I petted long strokes down his back, but he squirmed violently, so I stopped, "Sherlock?"
He reached for the buttons of my trousers, and asked, "Yes?"
"Alright. I'll quit Monday."
"What would you like today?" I asked curiously, "Will you allow kisses?"
"It's happened again, hasn't it?" Sherlock smiled. "Come, John. The game is afoot!"
"Well, I guess I know what I'm doing in my time off."
"A doctor of medicine, then. Yes. As I suspected. An army doctor will do quite nicely." He was tall, this gentleman, with dark hair and a hooked nose. Striking more than handsome, I would say. "I am an amateur chemist, myself, and often conduct experiments. Would that bother you, do you think?"
"Yes, but..." I hissed back, but stopped in my tracks as I saw the person who could only be Ms. Adler. She was truly a work of art, all beautiful dark skin for miles and black curly hair, beautifully decked out in pure crisp white lingerie.
I cut him off effectively by shrugging out of my shirt and finally grabbing his lapels to pull him in for said kiss. He groaned, and quickly took over the kiss. I let him. This was exactly what he needed.
A laugh burst out of me and I could see his expression turn sheepish, then certain.
"Seriously?"  I blinked up, bemused.  "How many hands do you have?"
"Umbrella man?" Sherlock stopped bristling, "Oh, I bet he loved that!"
We followed them into a little parlour, complete with overstuffed stiff couches and chairs, all in opulent red. "Wait here."
"I don't see what that has to do with"
I smiled triumphantly, and licked a stripe up his ear. He shuddered and exhaled a quiet, "Yes...."
"Why don't we just see where things go, Irene?"
"I once had a case where a hansom driver was a serial killer. I am more cautious these days."
"Have you tried? There's no exit for us. And even if there were, legally we belong to the Government now. We can't work anywhere else ever again." Sherlock shrugs, like this is a totally normal conversation, "It was in the boilerplate. You really should have read the whole thing."
Boilerplate
I backed him up against a bookshelf, and caged him in, "Are you interested in that, still?"
"Are you quite sure, Stamford?" He smirked lightly, "A military man?"
"What?"
"I suppose."  He did not look pleased, and his face was flushed, "Sex.  Can we?"
"What?!"
Her eyes narrowed, and she stood up gracefully.  "Come with me, John."
"Let us see- what other of my faults might trouble you? Oh yes. I sometimes keep to myself for days on end, you mustn't think that I am sulking or upset with you, I simply take some time occasionally to process things."
"Oh, I see." I nodded, "Okay, we're going to be really literal here, then. A few rules before we start; 1 no teeth, 2 no bending at awkward angles, and 3 no trying to choke yourself- there are more pleasant ways to do that."
"Oh, Sherlock, no." I allowed regret to tinge my voice, "No. Using the safeword only ends the session for the day, not forever, just for the moment."
He sighed, as if I should already know the answer.  I can recognize when a brat needs something they can't articulate, of course, so I was really just checking to see how self aware he was.
"You found another one!" Sherlock didn't even bother to greet his guest.
"Sociopath, actually. Problem?" I had my doubts about that, as I could see he cared quite a bit about my opinion on this, despite his very deliberately flippant tone.
I raised an eyebrow, "Sex."
"No. I'll do it." Sherlock said, decisively. He undid my top button, then the second, and struggled for a second with the flap, "I see you're already in costume."
"I have informed the Detective Inspector as to the progress of the investigation. We might as well go back home now." He said as I approached.
"Are you going to just pet me all day?" He squirmed again, tossing his head a bit.
"Good. Now, everyone does this a little bit differently."
"Oh, Sherlock, I shouldn't laugh." I wheezed, "It's alright. Perfectly natural. Happens all the time."
She smiled, "Yes, Soldier.  Get over here.  How good are you with your hands?"
The paper was a conundrum that Donovan and Lestrade debated in hushed voices at one end of the room while Sherlock grilled me on the details of the poor girl's condition. Despite the condition of her skin, she seemed to have died of some sort of poison and not anything which might have occurred during the active and creative session of sexual congress prior to her death.
"Oh, I very much do mean." Sherlock looked smug. "You probably got a letter from whatever his secretary is calling herself these days. And let me guess, it was the first you'd ever heard of this place?"
"He was here, I know he was."
"Actually, yes." I frowned, "How on earth do you always know these things?"
There was a swift intake of breath from him, and he nodded.
"What does she have to do with whether or not we can leave this place at the end of six months?"
"In favour, generally."  I replied, somewhat mollified, "But warn me first, okay?"
"You were asleep. You can't consent if you're sleeping. Do you want me to stop?"
"Yes."
People say it's all about the heat of it, but I say it's more about the even pressure and the slip and slide and friction of it.  There's no substitute, really, for someone who knows how to use what they have.  If I had been expecting her to move slowly, I was wrong.
"It's all fine."
"It's okay. I just need to..." He stood suddenly, "I need a shower." He turned on his heel and left.
"You told me yourself that you don't smoke. You have none of the usual signs of the abuse of drink. Military bearing is easy to observe- you surveyed the entire room before returning your attention to me, and even now you stand 'at parade rest'. The limp I could hear when you walked in, and you hold your left shoulder more tightly than the right, which I can clearly see by comparing their heights. Troubled sleep is implied by recent service, though I admit it is at best speculation. Financial troubles would be the most likely reason to bring someone of your background to a place like this, especially given the fact that a surgeon might have a hard time securing usual employment with a tremor such as yours, despite how mild it is."
Sherlock's smile widened, and he nocked loudly on the door. The door opened almost immediately to reveal a very short person, dressed in a stiff Victorian dress in butter yellow pinstripe.
"See that these two take a voucher each before they leave."
I woke up completely immobilized by Sherlock's limbs. Fanfics always say that one partner is like an octopus, but in the case of Sherlock Holmes- he was definitely the octopus type. I grunted, waking him up. If anything, his grip tightened, like I was an oversized teddy bear.
"Fair enough." Well, that answered that. "How long have you been here, actually, then?"
"Sherlock!"
"Reasonable.  Better with my tongue, or so I'm told."
"In a way." Sherlock slumped into the couch, "Mycroft is the second child. Runs the government here, more or less. You won't meet Sherrinford or Eurus, hopefully. Sherrinford is with Mummy, Eurus is in a corrective facility."
He leaned down and kissed me again, his over-eager teeth met mine in a short clash before we adjusted to the new position. He grazed his hand down my chest and tugged at my shirt, "Off?"
"Very green, Sherlock."
"Yes." I replied hesitantly.
"Now, John."  She huffed, "Move me!"
We took a hansom to the scene, which turned out to be a townhouse at the other end of the village. Sherlock didn't say a word the whole way, and out of deference to the weird truce we had going on, neither did I. We beat Sherlock's friend by a scant few moments, and it's a good thing, too. There were constables at the front door, and they were not friendly.
"Very much so."
"No." He said firmly. "But the last time I imagined doing this and did what I thought you laughed at me."
So that's how I found myself in an exclusive relationship with Sherlock Holmes not hours after having sex with the most notorious sex worker in London Village. Here we are, I guess. We slept together that night, though we didn't have sex. We slept next to each other and it was the single most intimate thing I'd done since I'd been discharged. We breathed one another's air, and despite the little discomforts of my arm here his leg there it was wonderful.
He flinched.
I may have been a little distracted by Ms. Adler's appearance during the conversation between Ms. Adler and Sherlock, but followed the conversation as best I could. Sherlock was in rare form, having copied my formal greeting himself before smoothly transitioning into a more in depth conversation. Ms. Adler did not join us in sitting, but rather stalked the room much like a large cat might pace its cage.
"No."
"I don't judge. Some people like it." I shrugged, "It can be a little dangerous..."
"Yes, good boy." I said into his ear and he shivered. "Like that?"
She looked down at me and stepped out of her white chunky heels, forward and extended a hand to shove me down to the bed. I let out a little air as I went, laughing a little at the absurdity of being pushed around so easily.  She raised an eyebrow as if to ask if I was going to play along.  I spread my arms out to my sides as if to say 'I'm here, aren't I?'
I nodded, and ran my hands greedily over her, pleased to take in what I had expected- beautiful soft skin and little shuddering gasps from her as I did so.  I leaned up to put my face between her breasts and inhaled the lovely scent of her.  I could feel her dampness where it gathered below my belly.  The underwear she had on was thin enough I could easily see where it had spread, too.  I smiled.
"You are correct. I do not usually take clients off site, either, however, this particular client had some very specific requirements which I am not at liberty to discuss. I will, however, say that you might track down her husband to inform him as to the whereabouts of his wife. I can have Madeline give you the woman's full name and address, as we keep those on file here."
"Yes."  I smiled, "Yes we can."
He shook his head where it lay, "No. This is perfect."
"So it's Mycroft Holmes." Sherlock shrugged, "I have another, older, brother and a younger sister as well, I'm afraid."
I laughed a little, "We aren't in bed."
"No." I stood up and prowled towards him, as best I could with my leg still being awful, "No, I very much want to continue that session. However, I do not like having an incidental audience- it's a hard no for me. Being intimate with you, in private, is very much a yes."
"You knew what I meant."
I slammed into 221B Baker street, and found Sherlock more or less where I'd left him.
"I think we'll get along just fine."  She prowled closer, "Is there anything else particular you would not like today?"
"I don't." I smiled, "My gut tells me that you aren't the sort, in much the same way my gut is telling me that Ms. Adler is going to be trouble, even if she isn't the murderer."
"That's right, Soldier."
"Good?" He asked.
"It doesn't, but what does that have to do with…" The expression on my face must have sufficiently betrayed my confusion, because he cut me off without delay.
"Someone dies and, sure enough, here you are, turning up like a bad penny."
"The thought had crossed my mind. I know it isn't a sensible thought." I shrugged, a little taken aback, "Anyone could be a murderer. For all I know you could be the culprit, I've barely known you a few days."
He glanced up and shoved me much too deeply into his throat. I remember his eyes being bright, thin bands around mostly pupil as I shuddered through.
His expression was clearly not amused. "Yellow." He growled.
It was dark by the time we arrived at 221, and Sherlock confirmed that Mrs. Hudson would probably be asleep. It was a narrow building, as all of the buildings on Baker Street were, and tall. The first stairs up to the landing were hard on my hip, and I watched with increasing frustration as Holmes took them two or three at a time. He waited at the top for me, producing a set of old looking keys when I finally made it. It was dark inside, and the hall was narrow. We took the door to the left and went up another flight of stairs that seemed interminable, like it would never end.
"Still good?"  I asked, hoping she'd let me get her off, too.
"Can we get you off?"
I winced, slightly, thinking of Sherlock.  "No blow job."
She leaned down and kissed me, soft and skilled where Sherlock had been determined and pushy.  Irene's hand went to the back of my head and gently held me there when I would have deepened the kiss.  She shook her head and smiled, pushing me backwards into the overstuffed chaise as she stepped forward into my lap.
He stood up from the couch, "Why don't you sit down?"
"Seriously?" He scoffed.
"Not recently, and never because I just wanted to." He frowned, "But I want to now, with you. Is that okay?"
"Yes. Now, adjust your grip like this." I said, taking his hand and moving it how I wanted. The sensation of both our hands on me was exquisite, and I may have lingered a little longer than strictly necessary. "Up and down like this, and if you want to twist your wrist at the end... Yes. Like that."
"Next time?" He pleaded. I smiled.
Stamford walked me from the station. He was mum on the subject of my new roommate - just told me to wait and see for myself. He did talk about everything else under the sun, though. By the time we arrived at the hospital I was happy enough for the reprieve. Nice fellow, Stamford, but my lord could he talk.
"You can be a little firmer, if you like, but no squeezing."
"Okay." He slid over to one side of the bed, still somehow managing to take up the vast majority of the bed. I laughed, and flopped carefully down in the available area.
"Let me tell you, shall I? You don't drink, you don't smoke. You are recently from war, walk with a limp, and have some form of shoulder injury. Probably your sleep is troubled, and you are financially in trouble. I think that is enough to be getting on with, don't you?"
"What do you deduce?"
Anytime
I shook my head as our fingers tangled over the last button, "No. Feels good."
"Not yet."  A delicately manicured hand held me at arm's length, "I can see you're most accustomed to taking charge yourself, but today allow me to do the work for you."
He cracked an eye and looked at me suspiciously, "Aren't you going for a walk?"
"John, you're a doctor, aren't you?"
"Very well.  And anything you do want?"
"No." Sherlock got up and took my mug of tea, "Can I have this?" He had drunk the last of it before I had a chance to reply, so I shrugged, somewhat bemused.
"It is sex, Irene."  I shrugged, "Just because my dick isn't in you doesn't make it something else."
He was right, of course, though at the time I had a few doubts.
I deflated, "Of course you do."
"Okay, okay." I laughed, "Kiss me?"
"Why?"  Sherlock looked genuinely puzzled, "I can't say 'to eat' in Uzbek, but I still eat food."
"I very much doubt that a woman of your repute would allow any of your employees to take a client anywhere other than the safety of your establishment." Sherlock's tone implied a question to which he felt he already knew the answer, and sure enough, Ms. Adler nodded thoughtfully.
"Yes Mistress."
He hissed his displeasure and through clenched teeth finally bit out, "Green. Yes, whichever. Whatever it will take to get you to stop teasing me!"
I stopped, mid stride, and settled back into parade rest.
I waited.  She smiled.  "I see praise doesn't really do it for you.  Shame."
"Was it a one time thing?"  He asked, facing away, "With me, I mean."
He grumbled, but untwisted himself from around me and let me go. I took deep breaths, and navigated to the washroom mostly by feel. I did what I had to do while there, washed up, and went back to bed only to find that in my absence Sherlock had spread out to take up the entirety of available space. "Budge over if you want cuddles."
"Why?"
"Good. Someone like her rarely allows themselves to be emotionally invested, don't get yourself hurt."
"I'm used to the army, Ma'am.  We get inured to words pretty quickly."
"Did I miss anything?"
"Infuriating."
"Because whatever we have going on between us is complicated enough already without someone like her coming into the picture." I shook my head, "She would be worth the trouble, but likely is not interested in either of us outside of her professional capacities."
I crawled back over to her, and gently pulled her panties down her legs and off.  I was pleased to see that while she was well groomed, she was not entirely hairless.  I myself have always thought that smacks a little of underage play and it makes me mildly uncomfortable.
"But I can't hate my own father?" Sherlock guesses. Then he scoffs. "Mycroft said the exact same. But I do, truly. This isn't teenage hormones or whatever, John. I hate him. It's alright, he hates me too. Tells me at least once a day, when he's around. He hates me because I'm not perfect like Mycroft. I'm nothing he wanted me to be. I'm not the child he wanted."
Sherlock pauses for the briefest of moments there - so subtle an idiot like her would never notice it. He mustn't let her see his reaction, mustn't let her know how that word stings.
"Why did you come here?" he asks, rather than answering the question.
"Sorry to bother you," he says - he's got one of those smooth, deep voices that is perfect for radio. "Is this seat taken?"
"Uh... nice car," John remarks, and Sherlock chuckles.
It would've been he and Victor's one-year anniversary.
"Thanks," Anderson had said, looking John up and down. "That gangly bloke watching today, the one with the legs and the cheekbones..."
Somehow they're kissing again, and Vic has ended up on top of Sherlock with one hand cradling his neck and the other carding through his curls. Sherlock's arms wind around Vic, one at his waist, the other at his shoulders so he can scratch the back of Vic's neck in the way he knows makes his boyfriend melt. It's a lifetime of bliss before they break apart for breath.
"See you around, John," he mutters it under his breath, as the blond starts to walk away.
Mycroft is gone again when Sherlock manages to rouse himself for breakfast.
"Take a picture, freak. It'll last longer," she snarls.
"What? Oh, that. Yeah, it's much better," Sherlock flexes his fingers, then winces. "Not totally healed, apparently. But better."
"Right okay," Lestrade holds his hands up. Sherlock skulks in here enough that Lestrade knows not to push him when he doesn't want to talk. "But if you ever decide you
that? You can't just do that to people. It's morally wrong.
Finally. Someone at this school who's
That's all it is at first. A tentative touching of lips-on-lips. After a moment, John dares to add a little more pressure, and that's pretty weill-received by Sherlock. His eyes flutter closed and he pushes his lips back against John's. A second later, John's eyes close too and he sucks Sherlocks bottom lip gently. This elects a sigh from the taller boy that makes John grin. They carry on like that for five minutes, moving their lips together, letting their hands roam. Sherlock's startled when John slips tongue in, but nervously returns the gesture a second later. However, John clearly gets too brave when he moves his hands up inside Sherlock's shirt.
"I have to get it done, Shez," Victor doesn't throw him off, but he does gently prise his arm away. "Mr N will go batty if I have another outstanding homework."
"School shit," Sherlock waves a hand dismissively, because he doesn't want to explain it to Jim.
"He told you all that?" John's forehead crinkles in confusion.
"I did something stupid," Sherlock waves a dismissive hand. "It's done with now. I'd just like to not think about it for a bit."
"No problem, darling," he says, and John's taken aback by the pet name. He's never heard Sherlock call anyone by any kind of pet name before (except last year when he got in an argument with a teacher and called her 'sweetheart', but that was sarcastic and condescending, not affectionate). He doesn't really know how to respond, so he doesn't. Instead, he squeezes Sherlock's fingers in return and smiles at him.
Sherlock to hit him back. But he can't do it, can't bring himself to hurt Vic. So he clenches his fists and doesn't break eye contact until Phil smacks him in the back of the head. He almost yells out, but he bites his lip hard. He's not giving them that kind of satisfaction.
"Mm," John mumbles, his hand pausing at the back of Sherlock's head.
"It's an adrenaline kick, if nothing else," Sherlock shrugs. "And anyway, you could always leave me. You don't
It's a longer kiss than last time - they actually get to move their lips together this time. John's definitely the more experienced, so Sherlock lets him take control, just going with everything John does. Kissing is totally new to him, and he's pleasantly surprised that it's infinitely better than the research he's done. John's lips are full and soft and he tastes faintly of tea and toast and spearmint chewing gum. Gentle, calloused fingers weave their way into Sherlock's curls and, after a moment's hesitation, his own hands rest on John's hips. Seconds later, the big light snaps on and they hear a gasp on the other side of the room.
"You enjoy pissing your brother off, don't you?" John observes, and Sherlock nods.
"For fuck's sake, Harry!" John hisses, as they break apart. "What are you doing up?"
"It's not
"No," is the short answer.
Not that he's
"Well, that's as may be, but I doubt you have any aversion to staring at Kate Winslet for two and a half hours," the dark haired boy shoots back, and John just laughs. Sherlock moves his feet into John's lap and John's hands come to rest on Sherlock's legs. It's not gay, John tells himself. It's alright for friends to snuggle up together when they watch a film, isn't it? Anyway, John
"You fancy Molly!" John says, and Sherlock splutters at that.
"You're going shopping. With Molly," John says, slowly.
"Hello John," he says, and it's almost dismissive. "If you've come for a chair again, feel free."
"You're going to Sally's birthday party," Sherlock points out, and John's about to argue that Sherlock didn't know about that until about two minutes ago, but he knows there's exactly zero sense in starting an argument with Sherlock; they both know who'll win in that situation. They're scraping the bottom of the ice cream carton now, and it's getting late. Sherlock stands up, stretching his back. "Come on. Let's go up to bed. I'm exhausted."
"Just try not to kill us before we get home, right?" he says. "Jesus. How did you pass your test?"
"Thought he'd be here already," he says.
"I am so regretting complimenting your ego," he says, shoving his rugby boots into his bag and sticking his feet into his ordinary trainers. He hops to his feet and holds his hand out to Sherlock. "Come on then, Mr Fantastic. Mum and Dad are away 'til Sunday and Harry's on a school trip to Paris. I've got the house to myself all weekend - you can stay over if you want."
"Splendid!" Sherlock galloped up the stairs, "Just let me get my hat- go ahead. I'll meet you there."
"What do you mean you can't leave? Of course we can leave."
He preened under the praise and his usually quite sallow cheeks coloured a little. Clearly the praise thing was something I would need to incorporate a little more often.
St Bart's Hospital
I laughed, chagrined, "Fair enough.  That's how I usually start scenes, myself- asking what my partner wants.  I guess I am looking for a distraction today.  I need to get out of my own head for a bit."
"You lower the intelligence level of the entire room each time you open your mouth, Anderson. Kindly cease." Sherlock scoffed, "We've got everything we can from the scene, but there's a lead to follow. We'll get back to you when we have more."
"Bother. There's always something."
I peeled the vest off, and immediately his deft fingers were at my collar, pulling the buttons loose as he went. "Easy, easy. I'm not going anywhere."
"Holmes!" Lestrade chided from ahead, "She's up the stairs. You could show some respect for the dead, you know."
"He doesn't." Umbrella said flatly. "I want to employ your services. I understand you are not being compensated as much as you should be."
"You are unnecessarily difficult to kidnap, Doctor Watson."
"Like that, do you?"
The next day we heard from Lestrade. They had talked to the husband and he had confessed to murdering his wife after finding out that she had been cheating. All in all, a fairly straightforward situation. Sherlock sulked for days afterwards, claiming there was more to it, despite not being able to prove it.
"That's it." I shrugged, "There isn't really much to it, it's repetitive and will make your jaw and wrist sore. We can do something else if you don't want..."
His stare was flat and unimpressed, as if he wasn't entirely sure if I was making fun of him or not.
"Is something wrong?" I goaded.
"Now what?"
"You have an archenemy?"
"Yes.  Very standard, of course."  Her smile turned wicked, "But at least I can't mistake it for anything else."
He frowned, "Um..."
She frowned.  "You're thinking again, Doctor."   She leaned forward and kissed me, clearly as a distraction.  It worked, because the next thing I knew her hand was on me, and she had rolled a condom on.
"Oh?" I stood, "Why don't you sit down?"
"I'll help.  I haven't had a reason before."  Sherlock looked a little apologetic, which I thought was strange.  "I'd rather you didn't have sex that doesn't mean anything.  If that means exclusive, then..."
"Right.  We're going to work on that."
"It's a type of snake, you know, Boss."
Eventually we reached his destination, and he ran up the stairs to the front door. When I finally made it up behind him Sherlock smiled, "Are you ready to meet an institution?"
"Red, yellow, green okay with you?"
"Fair enough, Doctor Watson." A slim individual in black Victorian dress stepped out from behind Umbrella. "You may call me Anthea. My pronouns are she/her. I am Mr. Holmes' secretary."
"How on earth do you know that?" I interrupted, mildly alarmed but mostly intrigued.
"Who even are you?"  I clenched my jaw, "How could you allow this kind of thing to happen?"
By the time a hansom stopped, I was in considerable pain, and Sherlock couldn't stop talking about Ms. Irene. I was getting a little tired of it, actually, and was relieved that he stopped talking when we got into the carriage. It was a short enough drive to the police station, but Sherlock bounded out of the hansom so quickly that he left me to pay for the bill. I was sore and cranky by the time I caught up with him in the station.
"I am not the good guy here, Dr. Watson."  He backed me up into a bookshelf, glaring down at me, "Whatever made you think I was?"
"No." I gestured, "You know where the door is."
"Okay." I smirked, and tugged again.
He looked puzzled, and I mimed a jerking off motion. His expression went flat again. I smirked and shrugged, "You can call a colour any time."
"Hm."  She tilted her head a little as she regarded me with an odd look on her face, "I rather like you, John Watson.  You are welcome to visit anytime, you'll have a half-off deal every time."
I leaned in close and whispered in his ear, being careful not to touch him at all, "I won't touch you until you do."
It didn't matter where.  I went.
It was my turn to raise an eyebrow, "Oh?"
"I appreciate your concern." The sarcasm was thick in his voice. "And just to be clear, there is nothing going on between us. You very clearly ended it yourself."
"Very well, then." Umbrella got up, and gestured to Anthea, "He has made his decision."
"Yes." I breathed.
"Let him in, Madeline."  Ms. Adler's voice was smooth and deep.  "I've been expecting him."
"This would be a good time to inform the Detective, if only so we don't have to do the usual chore of informing the family." Sherlock gestured that I should follow as we left. "We'll catch a hansom this time. I don't fancy a run. How's your leg?"
"Okay. If I say anything that makes you uncomfortable..."
"Well, let's go get you settled in, then."
"Would you like me to explain for you?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow, "It's simple really. It's always the same. You are down on your luck in some way, then out of the blue you receive a letter addressed to you from a place you have never heard of, offering steady and regular employment. All you have to do is give up your normal life, which hasn't been going well, for six months and live onsite. It sounds like a great deal, doesn't it? But of course it is a trap."
"Oh. You like it." He nodded, "Okay. At some point we'll try it."
"Yes."  She said, "Take off my bustier."
"Anything different this time?"
"She/her. Ma'am is fine.  Now relax."  She shoved me, hard, into the cushions, and I groaned. "You are overthinking."
"No."  My nose flared a little,  "I don't have much sensation there, actually."
He turned to look at me skeptically across his generous nose, "Yes?"
Sherlock's long arm reached around the door for his hat when his gaze fell on my chair.
"Good." I licked a strip up his ear from the lobe to the top, and dragged my teeth along as I went. He hissed. "Perfect is right."
"If we can all get out of here.  If you're up to help me.  If you really are interested in more, and if you want to be exclusive."
"Do you want to continue later?" I asked, gently.
I drew away as she finished and looked around for something to wipe off on.  Finding nothing, I licked my hands clean.  She stared up at me, grinning, "You enjoy that almost as much as the sex, don't you?"
I shrugged out of the shirt and let it fall to the floor.  Her eyes sharpened, and I knew what she was seeing.  The shoulder wound was bad, I knew.  And this was the first time anyone other than a doctor or Sherlock had seen it.  I clenched my jaw.
"Yes, Sherlock. Green."
I pulled him back into my lap, and he came bonelessly, collapsing with a knee to either side of my hips. Surmising that he enjoyed a little tooth, I licked up his throat and nibbled a little as I went. He groaned, and sought out my mouth. This time the kiss was deep and dirty. He kissed like he spoke, little bits at first, then a deluge of information. I loved every second.
"I very much doubt you object to someone who can actually throw you around.  How do you feel about threesomes?"
"Not at all."
"My sleep is solid, actually."
"Demanding," I teased, but slipped a finger inside to see what I was working with- plenty of room, as expected.
