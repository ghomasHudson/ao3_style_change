They both kept their promise - if one could call it that - of seeing each other again only a couple of days later, when Monday caught up with them. However, it was a busy shift for the 8th Heaven cabin crew - so much that not even Gabriel and Balthazar could do much to allow Castiel enough time to tend a bit to Dean. They greeted each other, exchanged their how-have-you-beens, and merely managed to smile at each other a few times when the flight attendant passed him on his way to other guests. The frequent flyer didn't even order anything so he wouldn't cause him any more work than he already had.
But here a fierce and too-loud, "No!" from his lover interrupted him, and in the blink of an eye he found himself engaged in a forceful, if not bruising kiss. Dean allowed it for a few seconds, before he gently pushed the other man away.
Was he really...? Had he truly...? There was this big four letter word floating in the air just in front of him, and he still wasn't all that sure how to grasp it. How long had he known that man? Surely not long enough to... to...
Shaking his head, he scolded himself for giving in to hopes and fantasies. For being ungrateful. He should be thankful for what he had gotten here; he
Castiel wasn't sure what he expected, but the passenger in front of him flinching or the plane suddenly descending a few feet wouldn't have surprised him, seeing as there was a rock dropping down from his heart. So no family; not of his own, anyways, only in a greater sense. And the flight attendant was sure that if there had been family, the other man would have talked about them and not his brother and his brother's girlfriend.
Just as Cas was five minutes early, Balt was, as usual, ten minutes late, which gave the younger flight attendant the chance to think through what he needed to bring up. Knowing full well that it would be gone again by then anyways. But there were things weighing on him, and he hoped that the self-proclaimed expert on 'all things sex and romance' held at least the idea of an answer.
"Yep. There's this little bakery not far from here that has specialized in them. They're technically normal muffins, but, as you may have noticed, not the normal sweet ones. Instead they leave out the sugar and add ingredients for a hearty taste, like ham and bacon and cheese and even potatoes. Then they add spices and onions and bell pepper and stuff and it tastes like a whole breakfast, but in the form of a handy pastry."
"I don't understand why you have to think so little of you, Dean. You're worth so much more than that. I will never hate you. I've been on this Earth for three and a half decades and never did I feel so sure about anything. Not even about my career choice, despite my love for flying. I love you, Dean, and nothing else matters. I'm not an impulsive person, I think things through. You know that. And I've thought long about that decision. It is the right one."
A shower washed off the remnants of chlorine clinging to his skin, making Castiel feel refreshed, but also pleasantly tired when he crawled into his bed afterwards. He fell asleep immediately.
"I guess so, yes," he eventually remembered to reply, and forced a smile onto his face. "I assume it's not easy only seeing your family on weekends."
For endless minutes nothing but breathing could be heard over the connection, fast and full of little gasps from both sides. Dean reveled in those sounds; in the thought that his plan had worked out and he had succeeded in exhausting Cas enough so he would hopefully fall asleep soon.
Castiel knew he should have stopped Dean. He should have asked, if not demanded, to talk first. What he had to tell could change things, and maybe not for the better. What use was it to meet Dean's family and friends now, when he didn't even knew if not tomorrow he'd look back at this day, this evening, as the last he'd seen him, been with him privately? What if Dean sent him away and then even chose another airline to fly with?
Just when Dean was about to come back with a  witty reply, a droplet hit his forehead - and another one his rose right after.
"Glass of your best red wine for me and for my friend Castiel here... Cassie?" Balt made him snap out of his thoughts - and staring - and blink a few times before he realized what had been asked of him.
"Hey idjit," a grumpy yet fond voice called out to him, breaking through his bewilderment, and Dean looked down to find their old friend sitting there, in a wooden armchair in the sun, a bottle of beer in his hand.
"Yeah, about that..." Jess started, just as Cas, having recognized the cue, said, "I leave you two alone."
"Yeah, pathetic, right? Anyways, my recommendations... obviously, there are the classics. You know, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Cable Cars. If you're interested in museums, you should check out the Cartoon Art one, it's my personal favorite. Oh, and the Musée Mécanique, that's really awesome, it has this huge collection of all these arcade games, and you can actually play on them. And... okay, this is embarrassing, I'd actually have to ask Sammy for the more intellectual stuff, he's much better at these things. Speaking of, Stanford campus is pretty impressive, at least it was to me. But hey, what do I know, never been to university, so..." Blushing, the passenger trailed off. He really ought to shut his mouth now.
"Hey," he smiled, brushing over and then wrapping his pinky around Castiel's where his hand lay between them.
"I believe you already had that often enough. Just this morning, for example," he gave back, equally quiet, before he turned away to tend to the other guests. He never saw the proud smile on his lover's face as he watched the retreating form of the flight attendant he was so hopelessly... well.
Sometimes he wondered what people would think if they knew of his thoughts; how he wished to be up in their air, but without the means of a plane or any other technological or mechanical help. He knew most would deem him crazy; his notion that maybe, at some point in his existence, some time before he came to be in human form, he was someone else, something else, something that was able to lift up into the clouds on their own volition, whenever it liked and wanted to. A bird, a butterfly, a bee. Or something bigger and more fantastic. Or something - heavenly. Like an actual angel.
"Seems like you got his attention. Well done, Cassie!" Balthazar laughed, clapping his friend on the back. It didn't much help the dreadful feeling the younger man had in his stomach all of a sudden, knowing that this was all wrong. There was nothing of that feeling of 'right' he had had with Dean the first time they had talked; instead he felt like a piece of meat the stranger had just decided to devour.
"That means though that you still have to meet the eggheads in there, you know that, right?" And Castiel let out a laugh that had never felt more liberating.
"Spread your legs a little, Cas. Allow me to touch you without hindrance." The whimper that followed Dean took as answer then, not forcing the other man to actually respond with words; he was sure he wasn't able to anymore anyways. "I'm there, Cas," he reminded gently, "and when you touch your cock now it'll be my hand; it'll be me wrapping my fingers around you. Are you hard already, Cas? Can I feel how much you like that touch?"
Of course he didn't know what he expected out of it. The chance that he'd be allowed to get to know the flight attendant better, to even see him outside his work, was, given Dean's track record with acquaintances that demanded a bit more effort than being chatted up in a bar or something, rather small, but that didn't mean he wouldn't try. Something told him the dark-haired, blue-eyed - and weren't that eyes of the bluest blue he had ever had the pleasure to look into - man was worth it.
Dean didn't seem to mind, though. He climbed over Castiel to come to hover above him, and entwined their fingers, thus keeping the flight attendant's hands securely and immovable next to his head, while he ducked down to follow the path his palms and digits had taken before, kissing and licking down Castiel's neck, chest, stomach, as far as their locked hands would allow.
very shy when it came to sex, especially when his partner looked at him so openly and attentively as Dean did now. And their new position, with his lover presenting himself like this without hesitation, didn't exactly help.
Right now, Castiel was stuck in South Africa, after their flight had been delayed for safety reasons. Something was wrong with the plane, and while Dean was all for not taking any risks, especially when it came to flying - and his lover - it meant that Cas wasn't going to be back in time before Dean had to leave for Detroit again. And it had been like this the past two weeks, just as it was about to be in the upcoming couple of.
Now it was too late. He couldn't just announce he'd give up his work, stay at home, get a less demanding job, but at least be there whenever his partner came back. It would make him make look desperate, and if he knew one thing, then that desperation and, consequently, the dependence behind it, was even more of a death sentence for a relationship, any kind really, than being apart all the time.
Castiel nods, acknowledging the pain of their loss. A few moments pass before either of them speak again.
In that moment, Dean abruptly realizes the person sitting across from him probably knows him better than anyone alive. Cas probably knows about the times Dean had to make do with scraps, probably knows about how Mary would hum along to the radio as she cooked dinner, probably knows about the loaves of bread Dean would hide under his jacket to bring home to Sam when they were short on money.
Castiel, who’d been staring at the stars overhead, turns to face her as well. “I’m well, thank you,” he responds stiffly.
“We'll find him,” Castiel states, then presses his fingers to the kid’s forehead. Aaron falls unconscious immediately.
“St. Michael Vanquishing Satan. Classic glamor shot of big bro,” says a voice from behind her. Deanna whips around and—
“This meeting's over,” Dick declares, dropping his eye contact with Cas and his expression of forced good humor at once, beginning to step with purpose towards Dean.
They're at Room 207 by the time Dean comes back to himself, to 2008, and the door swings open to reveal—
“I thought about asking, you know?” Dean says, wishing for the alcoholic fuzz he’s so used to now, but he has to go it alone—what a surprise. “Asking you, that is. If you’d bring him back. Hell, Chuck brought Lucifer back from there, and you’re more powerful than he was, I’d guess.” Jack is silent, so Dean continues. “I realized, though, that maybe—maybe he doesn’t
Deanna is making coffee (her second cup, Bobby’s fourth) when the phone rings. She glances at the wall of labeled phones, but Bobby interrupts her scrutiny when he picks up the black one on the kitchen table and says, “Yeah?”
“Well, there's got to be some sort of link between, uh, skid mark and bubble wrap here.” She flips through the case notes Bobby had given them. “We’ve got a witness. Officer Ed Colfax. Saw Hatch go from a solid to a liquid. Let’s go pay him a visit.”
And Dean remembers the look in Cas' eyes when they first met, the placid calm as the nerdy-looking guy in a trench coat proclaimed himself an angel of the Lord and spread his wings as mighty shadows,
Most of the time is spent pooling resources like weapons and first aid items, and then making sure everyone understands what they’re getting into. Basic Enochian symbols are taught to the hunters, ones that power up weapons enough to
Later, Deanna is never sure which of them moved first, but their lips meet and her right hand moves to his hair as his left cups her cheek, and they’re
Raphael’s people slowly, so slowly, thinning out, until Deanna finally catches a glimpse of Raphael. The archangel is just a bit to the left of where she wants him, so she moves into a position where—
“Please. There is another way. Brother, please. I don't want to hurt you.” A dull thud, then the hair-raising sound of an angel’s dying scream. Her fingers dip into her pocket, retrieving the lighter, and she carefully doesn’t pray for Castiel’s safety lest she’s overheard. Then: “Why won't any of you listen?” Deanna releases the breath she didn’t know was trapped in her lungs.
painting, the one that had kicked all of this off, the one that gave them hope only for them to die before they’d gotten their hands on the weapon depicted in it: the Lance of Michael.
“Trust me, buddy, and this is coming from someone who’s not exactly a big fan of you mojo-ing us places: airplanes suck.”
The blonde angel throws his hands up, exclaiming, “It’s not like I have any other choice, do I?” He gestures towards the flames.
Maybe I’m getting tired – I can’t think of anything but nights with you. I want them warm and silvery.
She winces, feeling guilty as soon as the words, laced with a bit more venom than intended, are out of her mouth, but she holds his stare as he tilts his head to the side, from where he’s seated next to her on the porch. Absentmindedly, she wonders, not for the first time, where exactly he picked up that particular gesture.
of the gravel beneath Dean’s boots, already expecting his friend’s arrival after his his fleeting prayer earlier:
The first week at Singer Salvage Yard holds that same silence, the hushed grief she was only beginning to experience on her way back from Stull Cemetery making itself known everytime she weaves through the scrapyard, or stumbles downstairs to make her and Bobby coffee and unthinkingly sets out a third mug, or manifests in the way she’s unable to look Bobby in the eye without hearing a sickening
“I think Hell is worse,” Jack says mildly. “Unless Rowena has significantly changed the day-to-day there, being flayed doesn’t sound pleasant.”
and every terrible thing that comes after: Raphael, the civil war in Heaven, Cas' betrayal, the Leviathan—
Gabriel spreads his hands. “Okay, so here’s how it’s gonna work: you give me my big brother’s lance, and I give you—and Cas here—exactly what you want.”
Dean’s sure he’s gaping at Jack like the big, dumb human he is, but any hope he might’ve had for Jack to swoop in all
“Dominoes,” Deanna responds. “In fact, we just dug yours up.” She looks down at the pile of bones that once belonged to Crowley.
Balthazar nods, seeming to approve. “Good. Well, you lot have already done the easy part,” Deanna sees Bobby bristle out of the corner of her eye at that, “finding a weapon that just might possibly give us a chance against Raphael. Now, it’s up to yours truly to find it. Give Castiel my regards when he returns.” And he’s gone in a rustle of feathers.
Garth emerges from the steps leading downstairs and opens his mouth to say something, but Bobby grumbles, “Not yet, Garth,” and the hunter closes his mouth and takes a seat on the sofa.
Crowley’s eyes find hers. “The oldest of the old demons. The first generation after Lilith. Lucifer turned them himself, before the oceans drank Atlantis.”
Dean mechanically picks up the sandwich—strawberry jam, from the fancy farmer’s market a couple miles south, not even grape like Sam told him Cas preferred, what the
“Now, now, Feathers,” the demon protests, “this is no way to treat a lady on the first date. Wait until the second, at least.”
“It’s likely Raphael’s followers will be here. If we split up, perhaps I can talk Balthazar into making a stand with us.”
Dean leans forward and slaps him once, then again. He thinks Sam isn't even breathing. But just like last time, the demon does nothing but glare at them, looking more and more nervous.
Deanna guiltily shifts her weight from her left foot to her right before settling. “Well? Do you have it back now? You own your soul again, right?”
Dean’s face darkens, a stormcloud of anger and hurt passing over his countenance before smoothing out. “Sam? He won’t have a problem believing me. My brother’s
A hunter who Deanna had only met the day before, bleeding profusely and scrambling back on the ground before one of Raphael’s pant-suited soldiers had stabbed him through the heart.
“But seriously,” she pauses to drain the rest of the cup, before setting it aside. “You feeling okay?”
Dean's just finished outlining the important stuff, the real milestone events, when the TV turns on and spits out static. Dean debates telling Cas to cut the shit, he obviously can't hear him like this, but the radio whines and Dean mentally rolls his eyes at the histrionics. The noise in the room grows to that high high pitch, and Dean covers his ears just in time for the mirror above the bed to shatter. Bobby rushes into the room as the rest of the glass in the room gets blown out, and shouts, “Dean!”
Castiel flips open the folder, and says, “Gerald Hatch, a police officer, was found dead in the locker room of the police station he worked at. He was… liquified.”
Getting ready for a trip to the angelic afterlife? Not something Dean ever pictured doing. As he debates what to take with him (shotgun? Possibly. Demon killing knife or angel blade? They’re already dead. Liquid courage? Hm.), Sam approaches him.
Castiel walks around the desk and checks the unmoving figure for a pulse, or, knowing him, some sign of his soul still inhabiting his body or something equally weird. “Dead,” he states, then tilts his head. “Do you hear that?”
, or his soft snoring as he dozed with his face mashed into the window on the passenger’s side—no, his side. Ever since she dragged him back into the hunting world, the right side of the Impala belonged to him. Unbidden, the last moments she’d had with her brother in the car that’s been more of a home to her—them—than any place since the house in Lawrence spring to mind.
“Relax, Cas,” Deanna says, bristling at his concern but not shrugging off his hands. “He didn’t give me demon juice; it’s in my soul.”
“Ramiel, Prince of Hell. It’s catchy. It rhymes,” Crowley muses. “And he’s going to kill you if you try to take his toy.”
“No. Because if you were, you would have done it already. Fact is, you don't know who cut me loose. And you're just as spooked as we are. And you're looking for answers. Well, maybe it was some turbo-charged spirit. Or, uh, Godzilla. Or some big bad boss demon,” Dean says. “I'm guessing at your pay grade that they don't tell you squat. Because whoever it was, they want me out. And they're a lot stronger than you. So go ahead. Send me back. But don't come crawling to me when they show up on your front doorstep with some Vaseline and a fire hose.”
“I want Crowley's name,” Bobby demands. The crossroads demon just looks at him, smiling. “His real name, back when he was flesh and blood.”
to Hell, before closing it when he realizes he doesn’t care. Also, it seems rude to argue with literally God about semantics, especially when it seems like Jack’s gonna help Cas.
Now it’s her turn to tilt her head, albeit in what she hopes is a slightly less owlish manner. She doesn’t know when, exactly, she became fluent in Cas-speak, but something in his posture... the tension in his shoulders, maybe, or the slight note of hesitance in his voice as he asked for an invitation inside…
not yet, not until after the first time they trapped the angel in a ring of holy fire, not until he sat across from him and played
Dick doesn't get a chance to do anything more than take that one step, however, before Cas is roughly shoving Dean behind himself and subsequently getting thrown across the room with the full strength of an angry Leviathan. He crashes into a stack of SUCROCORP boxes and crumples to the ground. Dick watches his handiwork with satisfaction, then turns to face Dean. For his troubles, Dick gets a bone thrust through his heart, Dean stumbling back and praying to… something... that this plan works.
Dean racks his brain but can’t remember if that was the one with the harp thing or the one with the sleep god before—
“Dammit!” Deanna curses, and begins pacing. “Don’t know why I believed him. Once a Trickster, always a Tr—”
Deanna clears her throat. “I mean, I’d argue with the first one; I didn’t try to break you out, Gabriel just did it for me. I didn’t even ask or anything.” Sam tips his head in acknowledgement.
“Right,” Deanna states. “Look, Officer Colfax—Ed. We think that your partner died of unnatural causes.”
Deanna had headed upstairs sometime later, exhausted from the interrogation and still hurting from the lamia situation. She must’ve crashed, hard, since when she wakes up, it’s to a twilit room, and Bobby shaking her awake. “Whazzit?” she says fuzzily. How many hours had she been out?
Sam says nothing, and Dean steps into the room, ignoring Ruby. Sam pulls a knife and lunges at Dean; Ruby screams, Bobby pulls the brothers apart, holding Sam back as he shouts, “Who are you?!” and struggles against Bobby's restraining arms.
So, yeah, he’s a forty-something year-old man who doesn’t eat the crusts on his sandwiches. Whatever.
Balthazar and Rachel and the rest of Cas’ band of merry misfits take off shortly after with Raphael’s forces, leaving the hunters and the lone angel.
, just like our darling Castiel should be.” The Entity glares at Cas with pure and unabashed loathing.
“Bobby, they’re just paintings. Besides, we know how much the Bible got wrong, so even if the artists
“You only wish..?” Castiel prompts, finally turning to look at him. Dean’s eyes meet his, irises shadowed in the low glow of the moon, hair limned by the silvery light.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t able to return sooner. I had to give instructions to the angels under my command,” the angel apologizes. Deanna waves him off.
Deanna smiles wider, and the slight one he’d had on his face grows. Hers does, too, until they’re both grinning at each other, slightly giddy.
Deanna eyes first the symbols critically, committing them to memory in case she needs to block out the ever present ears of the God Squad again because she’s in hiding (or, like, masturbating), then turns her shrewd gaze to Castiel, green eyes taking in his form once again. Now that they’re inside, he seems even more off, blue irises standing out from the dark shadows underscoring his eyes and posture slumped in a way she’d call exhaustion in any another person. She exchanges a look with Bobby, but he just nods his head at her as if to say,
Castiel nods, not saying anything in response, and turns his gaze back to the blanket of stars above them. Despite the coffee, it’s been a long day—hell, a long few weeks, a long few
“Then what’s the hold up? I can fend for myself for two days, Cas, I’ve done it before,” she says, bemused by the angel’s reluctance.
Rising and dusting imaginary grime off her jeans, she extends a hand to him to coax him up. After a beat too long of staring at her fingers, translucent in the stark sunlight of midday, he grasps her palm and rises as well. They stand there for a moment, his hand warm and wide in her gun-calloused grip, before she prompts him, “Inside?”
Bobby lunges forward with the knife, but swipes at thin air; Dean rises from his swift crouch and catches Bobby's wrists in his hands. He tightens his grip on Bobby's hand with the weapon in it until it clatters to the ground. The older hunter backs up towards the kitchen, and Dean says, “Bobby! It's me.” He slices his arm with the silver knife, wincing slightly. “I'm not a revenant, or a shapeshifter. Your name is Robert Steven Singer. You became a hunter after your wife got possessed, and... you're about the closest thing I have to a father.” Dean pauses, able to take in the look of diminishing disbelief and growing hope properly this time around. “Bobby. It's me.”
Another deep breath. Dean comforts himself with a) the fact that Cas was the one who opened up this particular can of worms and b) his hand is being held in a tight grip, secure in the knowledge Cas would never let go.
—they talk over each other, babbling, then abruptly quiet down, still holding each other’s gaze, blue eyes on green. Deanna presses her forehead to Cas’, puffing a breath containing a slightly giddy laugh against his face.
of a plate being placed in front of him, and Cas’ hand smoothing across his back. Dean lifts his head.
After stripping off her pants and pulling on worn flannel pants and an old tee shirt, Deanna sits on the edge of the bed that had once been Sam’s designated sleeping spot whenever they’d stayed here. Bobby had insisted she take the room, but she’d been adamant about not doing so for the first few days, taking the lumpy couch as usual. Eventually, Bobby had threatened to cut off first the caffeine supply, then the booze stash, before she’d relented. It still feels wrong to be sleeping upstairs, but she supposes she’ll have to get used to it. With that frankly depressing thought, she turns to crawl under the covers but is interrupted by a gentle tap on the door. She sighs.
They go through the whole Wedge-Antilles-and-proximity-to-grave-site song and dance again, and then head to the Astoria Motel. The whole way there, Dean wars with himself over what to do with the whole Ruby situation. He doesn't want to get Sam's hackles raised this early, but the sooner his brother gets away from that demon bitch and off her blood the sooner they can deal with… well, everything. Heaven and Hell and Lilith and Alastair and Lucifer and Michael and the damn
He flicks through his recollection of the first time around, trying to stop seals from breaking while dealing with a much less agreeable Dean Winchester, all the while fighting against the evil forces within Heaven. Castiel contemplates this, searching for any potential allies amongst so many enemies.
"Thank you. We will." He didn't even know where the answer was coming from - but it was out of his mouth before Cas had even the chance to reconsider the words. Balthazar wasn't any less surprised than his friend, if the light gasp from his side was anything to go by. The barkeeper, on his part, obviously liked the answer, and grinned winningly before leaving the two flight attendants' table.
"And what? Dean, are you seriously asking me whether I mind?" If he hadn't been sure about the answer, Jo's look that warned him to better not say anything stupid, or else he'd get his ass kicked, told him everything he needed to know. When he shook his head, she continued, "I don't care who you love, or sleep with, as long as you're happy. So, about that flight attendant. What do you think, what are the chances of seeing him again and moving things along?"
"Haven't seen your handsome face around here before," she began, leaning slightly over to him, her raven hair brushing his bare arm and making it tickle. "Off on a short trip, or frequent flyer?"
"I hate waiting," Dean murmured, interrupting Castiel. "I wish you were here with me. And on my flights."
"Angels are not supposed to be on Earth. Our place is here, in Heaven." Dean's heart, for a moment readying itself to dance of joy, sank once again.
"I take the red and yellow one," a voice he'd come to know so well, despite not having heard it that often yet, sounded from behind him, and he smiled when he turned around. "Hello Dean."
As soon as it’s just Bobby, Cas, and her—Rufus had to stay in Stull to smooth things over with the locals, and Deanna doesn’t envy him for having to explain why there were charred imprints of wings in the cemetery—it’s late, and Bobby pours them all full glasses of whisky. The three of them sit in silence for a while, each wrapped up in their thoughts.
“So, Dick explodes all over both of us and we get sent back in time?” Dean asks, a note of incredulity creeping into his voice.
Unfortunately, by this point, Castiel has clearly heard enough of Dean’s attempts at bravado and obfuscation over the years and doesn’t even deign to comment. Instead, he continues to look at Dean, face soft and eyes gentle.
“Stakes, iron, silver, salt, knife,” Dean lists. “I mean, we're pretty much set to take care of anything I've ever heard of.”
White hot pain races up her spine, and her back arches. Her eyes involuntarily shut, and when she forces them open after the agony subsides, the lance isn’t in Gabriel’s hand anymore.
It’s silent. Utterly, completely silent. The only things Dean can hear are his own breathing and his heartbeat loud in his ears.
Deanna squints at him in bemusement. “You think your Heaven would be the guestroom of Bobby’s house?”
He changed the angle now and then, lightly pulling at the muscles surrounding his two fingers, carefully stretching Dean's hole while keeping the movement to a steady in and out. Soon enough, a third finger followed, easily finding a way in.
"I'm in car business, my company's in Detroit. So I travel back and forth between there and San Francisco."
At just the right temperature, the water in the swimming area was exactly what Castiel was seeking - a place where he could relax, where he could just float on the surface, close his eyes and pretend he was drifting through warm summer night's air that gently held him by his wings.
Gliding smoothly over to kneel in front of Dean, the flight attendant rubbed his palms along the other man's legs and over his hands, before finding his ass cheeks again. In a moment of braveness he leaned down and kissed first one, then the other, enjoying the way Dean's breathing hitched, and drawing a gasp right after when he placed a digit on the hole before him.
Shrugging and shaking his head, Cas remained quiet for a short while, sorting his thoughts. There wasn't actually anything to say to that. They'd never talked about it. End of story. He liked what they had. And he knew that Dean was - had been - more of a one night stand, no-feelings-involved kind of guy. What if he told the truth - said those words that so often changed so much, while at other times they were simple confirmation for something that had always been clear anyways - and it did change something? And not for the better, because while they were so good together, Dean still saw them as nothing more than, as it was called these days, friends with benefits? Of course, he had introduced him to his family and all, but was that really indication for anything?
Castiel hated himself for confirming his friend's words by blushing furiously. Balthazar was right. It had been a while since he had pleasured himself. Most of the time, he had lacked the right mood, simply hadn't felt like it. And had he taken care of himself one or the other morning, it had been only for convenience, never pleasure.
And now it was for Dean to prove to Castiel that what they had was another one of these good things.
"Yes." More Castiel didn't have in him, but the smile he added to the word told Dean everything he couldn't put into words right now.
When Friday came around, he was ready to kill someone - anyone at all - whereas he usually didn't even have the heart to kill a fly that bothered him half the night. The thought that kept him sane was that he was hopefully going to see Dean again.
"Yeah, got it," he dismissed and tried to squeeze past the flight attendant in the small passageway, but Gabriel wasn't finished yet. His face turned dead serious - an expression Dean didn't have expected him to even know - before he spoke again, all cheerfulness gone from his voice.
All that, however, he had become used to. It was his life - not always great, but it could have been worse. Hell, it
, his mind provided him, and he was inclined to agree. Trees and fields and mountains around him. A beautiful, peaceful scenery.  And behind him a--
He felt restless. He felt like someone had taken a vital part from him and put it on the other side of the globe, practically unreachable for reasons made by time, money and certain anxieties.
"You know full well I didn't mean it like this. But you have to do something. Something more than just ask for his name. If you like that guy - which you obviously do - try to find out if he likes you, too. And for the record, my money's on
The by now so familiar voice, and the words that had become something that could almost be called tradition, soothed Dean's strained nerves. It was so good to have the chance to talk to Castiel, even if it was only over the phone. It was rarely enough these days, their busy schedules and his lover traveling the world keeping them apart more often than not, but for now...
"No, it's fine. I... I wanted to talk to you about it, actually." Castiel coughed slightly, and blushed when he continued, "I have gotten a bit of information on the whole topic. Thought we might be able to see if we agree on its usefulness."
"Hey babe, you're crazy, you know that?" There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line, and Dean believed it was because of some delay. Way to the satellite and back took its time or something. However, when Castiel answered, the sound was as clear as if he was right next door. Wondrous technology.
She also loved Dean's cooking and singing, and Cas reading stories to her; she got excited whenever Uncle Sam played airplane with her or had her in his arms in general, because it allowed her to see so much more than when she was with either of her fathers. She enjoyed cuddling with Aunty Jess and was always quick to fall asleep when Dean's sister-in-law carried her around, and the toys and colorful pictures Aunty Charlie showed to her always made her look at them with wide eyes and every now and then a mouth formed into an engrossed 'O.'
"Yes, I know, but..." Jess took a deep breath and rubbed a hand over her face, the other stemmed into her side, as if she was trying to hold onto herself. "I'd still quite like your opinion. As someone who's basically new to the family, maybe you have another insight. It's just... I'm not sure..."
And Dean just couldn't stop himself anymore. Taking two quick steps towards the other man, he wound one arm around Cas' waist and the other around his neck to pull him close and press their lips together. It took the flight attendant a second and a surprised noise before his arms locked around Dean's body and his mouth opened in welcome.
- so busy that he flew across half the country several times a month, he surely wouldn't have time to arrange his schedule according to Castiel's shift plan so they could see each other on a regular basis.
Both those things, however, had the potential to end something he didn't want to lose. No matter how hard it was to cope with not seeing each other for weeks on end, being so far apart most of the time, practically not really having a relationship in a classical sense. So they were not 'classical' either, but that didn't mean that a little bit of that standard mainstream normality that was usually associated with relationships shouldn't apply to them, too.
"You really are dedicated," the passenger said with a smile when he accepted the water and immediately took a greedy sip from it.
"Oh crap, I'm so sorry, Cas! I thought since you won't be home this weekend and Sam's gone as well, I'd just stay in Detroit... damn. You know, let me check if I can find a flight, then I can be home--"
It stung nevertheless. As innocent as it - hopefully - was, Castiel did his best to avoid looking to Dean and that woman.
"It's not... it wasn't a hookup. There was just... a very nice flight attendant on the trip here. That's all."
to each other, apart from their passenger/flight attendant conversations on the plane. Even if those had been more private than any such talk should ever be, they still were strangers in most respects.
"I love touching your body, Cas. You are so beautiful, all muscles and yet softness in just the right places. Now give your nipples a bit of attention. Remember how I always rub them gently? I'm doing it right now. I lie beside you and I tease you, just as you like it."
Morning came and with it well-trained ignorance that was applied to all things two people living together in permanent close quarters couldn't afford to get too agitated over. The choice for having breakfast at a nearby diner was made wordlessly between the brothers, as was the decision to get back on the road immediately after their morning meal.
"All done with your phone call?" the purring voice next to him sounded once again, but this time, before also the hands were able to return, Dean turned his head towards Pamela, looking at her apologetic.
"Of course I am, Dean." Slow steps brought him who was once again clad in his trademark trenchcoat to the dirt road, and in reaching distance of the human.
"If you can't talk, or won't, or whatever, make a decision, Cassie. One of you has to," Balthazar stated matter-of-factly. Castiel was almost afraid to ask - and he knew the answer already.
"It's true, though, Cas! Also, you were the one who came in here looking like you had just seen a ghost."
That particular occurrence, more like a habit now, he couldn't claim he didn't like. In all honesty, he refused to even think of the possibility of having to let go of it again. No, it was good, it was comfortable, it added so much to his life. But, as things went, even the best ones had a catch. There always was one, that much he had learned in his thirty-odd years, and this - well, it was no exception.
"That is probably because he hadn't found the right person yet. Some people search their whole life; others at least half of it. We have both been lucky to meet the other, or I wouldn't be in a relationship either." Castiel's no-nonsense tone of voice as he stated what were simple facts was enough to have all of them - even Dean - stare at him open-mouthed. Dean was the first to recover, being used to how his lover was, and smirked.
It took Dean wriggling and his hands finding purchase on his lover's shoulders so he was able to counter any movements before Castiel pulled back, almost all the way out, and pushed in again, a slow but constant glide that he felt every inch of. Three times was he allowed to repeat that motion the same way, before his partner very clearly - albeit non-verbally - told him to get a move on.
"Hey Charlie," he greeted, feeling tired all of a sudden. His best friend was the last person he wanted to attack just because he couldn't be with Cas, and not being able to get rid of this dark cloud above his head made him resign.
A fork clattering loudly on the plate beneath it when it slipped from Dean's fingers startled the passing waitress. "Jesus, Cas, would you mind?!" He complained in a hiss when people turned to them at the noise and, as Dean was sure, also Cas' question that hadn't exactly been whispered.
Glaring at the curtain of hair obscuring his view on his brother's face, Dean took a moment to contemplate his answer while wondering if fratricide was a possibility, considering their family history. Ultimately he decided that it wasn't worth the effort. And that meant the effort of doing all research in the future on his own. In any case wasn't Sam his primary concern.
The whole thing had been more practical than anything else. It wasn't as if they'd gone on dates, taken each other out to dinner or lunch, or spent otherwise time with each other, except, of course, at work. They hadn't been a couple, and Castiel was sure Balthazar also never would have wanted to be the same, even if Cas had suggested it. He hadn't, though; and he was certain it had been a good decision by his subconscious mind.
On a thought, Dean was back at the Roadhouse, found Bobby looking curiously, then knowingly at him, smirking, winking.
The question Dean asked him was the one he had wondered about as well - in the beginning, when he had first started to think about quitting after his conversation with Balthazar. But the answer had come so naturally to him, without almost any consideration, and without doubt.
He'd probably been a hopeless case the moment he first met Castiel. Naturally so - who could ever resist the charm of a handsome man with his innocent friendliness and clueless charm? Cas was what Dean had never known he was looking for. Not someone who was calculating and too self-assured in themselves; but was an honest and kind soul. Not spoiled and rotten by this world that taught so effectively to everyone that it was good to be someone, just not oneself.
"Come on," he said, his voice a conspiratorial whisper, and led them out of the hotel into a thankfully rainless late afternoon. He navigated them through throngs of people, commoners and tourists alike, into a quiet area not far from the hotel; a park of sorts that, for some reason, didn't seem to have attracted the attention of anyone yet. And hopefully it never would, Dean found himself thinking as he looked around the small oasis that presented itself around them in awe.
"Always glad to be of service. And any time for you, Cas," Dean replied cheerily, and gave a lopsided smile, wondering not for the first time what the hell he was even doing here, flirting with that guy. Not that he didn't think of him as worth it or something, but... as much as Jo's voice in his head demanded him to take action, the dark-haired flight attendant was still just doing his job, so however was he supposed to know whether Cas' interest went any further than business? Yes, of course he was never going to know unless he tried or said something and--
"You're not the short term guy. I get that," Paul interrupted him, once more closing the distance between them, his arms winding around Castiel's body in a way the flight attendant actually craved. It made him feel safe. Home. Loved. it only it had been the right guy... "But don't worry, handsome. There's nothing shameful about it. I'll make it good for you. And I don't expect anything in return." Letting his hands wander up and down Cas' back with soft massaging movements, he added, "I'll be more than happy to know those muscles are a bit relaxed afterwards."
Should he be honest? Should he tell Dean that it wasn't great at all, because it meant that he'd barely get to see him anymore? Should he take that first step before Dean could, in vain hope that it'd protect his heart at least a bit? Should he say they could just as well call whatever that was between them a quits? Sure, 'whatever that was between them' run deep, that much was undeniable. But was it enough? And moreover, if he declared now that he would turn down the job offer, just so he could be with Dean - would he scare the other man off?
And kept hoping, week after week, flight after flight, that one of these days something would come along and make flying easier and more comfortable for his strained nerves.
Unfortunately, this didn't seem to be the way it worked. Dean even suspected his being distracted repeatedly by thoughts of that one particular flight attendant were what caused one or the other error in his work and thus the problems that kept them all busier than usual.
"And what decision do you suggest I should make?" There was no pause after that. They both knew the answer - and unsurprisingly, Balt was not shy to put it into words.
"8-20, as usual. One of these days we might just put your name on the door." Castiel knew it was a joke; he understood it as such also. But it stung nevertheless, being reminded that in this city, despite being here on a regular basis, he didn't have a home. Sure, the company would have paid for it, or at least supported him having a permanent residence, but what use was it to have two homes - one in his actual hometown, one where he travelled to the most due to his job - when he couldn't be quite at home in either? As much as he enjoyed his solitude, he often enough caught himself wishing for someone waiting for him when he returned. Someone who'd smile and take him into their arms and be his company in comfortable silence or during conversations about whatever they found interest in talking about. Someone to spend his free days with as well as his nights, explore the city with, learn from them, be shown all its secrets and wonders, be introduced to a family he never quite had, experience what it meant to be welcomed with open arms by a brother and a sister-in-law, by a partner's close friends who might just become his friends as well and---
"No, I mean... this whole past week was very unpleasant, and it is... nice to have a friendly passenger like you every once in a while. I was... really looking forward to today."
However, now that he had the chance, he couldn't help be struck by how gorgeous that man really was. And apparently also quite nice. There was his gut instinct that had green-lighted the stranger from the very first moment on, even if Castiel had no idea what he was supposed to do with the approval.
And indeed he was lucky, finding the other man standing next to the exit, all alone, his colleagues apparently already busy cleaning up.
It was only when they pulled back and looked each other deep in the eyes that the flight attendant realized that all this was, indeed, too good to be true. He was fooling himself.
By the time he was done, they were sitting on the bed, turned towards each other, and Dean was gently playing with the fingers of Castiel's left hand, caressing and massaging them as he listened intently. The flight attendant was sure that the light physical contact was meant to reassure him, to let him know that his lover was still with him. He smiled a silent thanks when, after he finished talking, Dean remained quiet for a little while longer, only lifted Cas' hand and tenderly kissed his palm.
However, when Dean wanted to pull Cas closer and get comfortable to sleep, the other man resisted, keeping a small distance between them as he faced his lover, tired blue eyes staring into green ones.
"I am whatever I want to be. And… wherever I want to be." Even a Dean Winchester couldn't miss the emphasis put on that
Nope, that was definitely a first. And Dean decided that while he was totally on board with what his mind - heart - had made him do, he wouldn't give it too much thought. For now.
Dean waited until all other passengers had left the plane before he shouldered his bag and walked towards the exit, silently hoping for the chance of a few more minutes with Castiel.
"Yeah, coffee's not good for the heart and all anyways," a blond-haired woman in 4a piped up, "and I'd very much like some apple juice. And a few of those heavenly tasting cookies!" Catching first the woman's eyes, nodding his thanks to her, and then Balthazar's, who immediately understood, Castiel turned toward the back of the plane and trailed the drinks trolley behind him. When he reached row 15, Dean's usual one, he used the wagon as a sort of a wall between them and the unfriendly passengers.
"Well... Cas helped." There was a curious rise of eyebrows and the tiniest smirk on Bobby's face, while Dean himself felt the same bloom on his. Of course. How could he ever have thought that Jack would leave Cas in the Empty. Dean strongly believed Jack had meant it when he said that he wouldn't want to interfere anymore - but Cas wasn't just any random creature lost in the Empty. Cas was... special. In every way. "It's a big new world out there. You'll see."
"I had an idea," he began, "How about we leave together? I have my car here at the airport; I could wait for you, then you wouldn't have to take a cab or the public transport."
With his bag in hand, Dean maneuvered around suitcases and people alike as he walked the well-known way towards the airport exit. It was time to start his day, and his week; the office was probably already expecting him.
Castiel shook his head at the analogy his mind was providing him with. The last thing he wanted to think about was his friend's possible interest in Dean. Because Balthazar jumped - sometimes quite literally - everything that was attractive enough. And if there was one thing no one was able to argue it was Dean's beauty. Gorgeousness even.
"I'm not stubborn. I can deal with it. Wouldn't be the first time," Dean hissed in reply, awkwardly getting up from his seat and stalking towards the bed to lie down and carefully put the ice pack - the one Sam had found him God-knows-where - in the juncture of his thighs, placed strategically so it wouldn't press on his sore parts.
The bag in hand, he wormed his way back under the sheets and into Castiel's welcoming arms, before he slowly revealed the contents of his purchase by dipping a hand into the papery case and pulling out one of the objects it held, all the while he carefully watched his lover's face. Which was set in curious expectation and topped by adorably ruffled hair, courtesy of their earlier round of morning lovin', as Dean had called it at one point, much to Cas' amusement and, in turn, his delight.
The road was still there, as was the sun, the light breeze, and the feeling of freedom. Still, Dean's smile faltered.
An hour later saw them bring their suitcases, bags and little Mary, bathed, dressed into her favorite jumper and snuggled into her car seat, to the front door. With a good fifteen minutes still in hand, they were ready to go - on their first real holiday as a family, and only their third one since they'd become a couple.
"Very funny." He fumbled to remain standing as Balt pushed his pants down, the by now unbuttoned shirt from his shoulders, and the change of clothes into his hands, but wasn't stopped from his continuous protest. "You know that's not what I meant."
"Dean?" he breathed, his voice just now deciding to refuse working. In return, he earned himself a frown and an apprehensive half-smile.
, that thing had put up a fight and had been disturbingly good at it. Up to the point where its ghostly foot landed in Dean's very real and definitely not dead private parts.
"You're not going to eat something as well?" came the question from his side that pulled him from his thoughts, and Dean blinked for a moment, before he leaned forward and took a bite from the muffin he was holding, earning himself a playfully shocked and hurt look.
But nothing compared to the pain he was feeling right now. Bloody ghost and its definitely-not-textbook ability to manifest in corporeal form. Lucky for them, at least textbook killing worked, even if some other things didn't. Not so lucky for
Dean was aware that he'd have to have a talk about that with Cas, and soon. But did he really want to? Did he really want to know where this was going to lead to, also? Did he want to face to possibility that they'd have to accept they had failed at making this work, even after Dean's passionate speech about how they'd manage? And most of all, did he want to waste only one minute of their precious time together for such an unpleasant conversation?
"Cas," he breathed, his voice gone all of a sudden when it got through to his brain who the opening door revealed.
"Cassie." There was something patronizing in Balt's voice that made Castiel want to strangle him. "That guy has it as bad for you as you have it for him. Just
The last time Dean had been this excited, there had been an actual date awaiting him - on a Friday. Not a mostly-business meeting on a Monday. On a flight, no less. And yet, this felt so much better.
It never came. Save for a mumbled, "of course, what was I thinking," his friend just sighed and took another sip of his wine, all the while watching Cas intently over the rim of his glass. And Castiel knew that look. The one that indicated Balthazar was about to say something he wouldn't like.
"I can't do anything about your hopeless swooning over Mr. Dean Winchester, or your crushing on him," Balthazar opened as he pushed past Cas into the room, "but I
"There's something I wanted to tell you..." was what the flight attendant heard before he was out of ear shot and back in the living room, settling down next to Dean. His lover didn't even get around to ask what was up before there were joyful yells and cheers sounding from the kitchen.
"Nah, it's be all right, the cafe's a little busy today, another birthday party, and there'll be a bachelorette party later on, so I can definitely use the break. Something happened?"
It had taken some effort and negotiation to convince Dean's boss that he just as well could do his work in his company's office in San Francisco, and that staying in Detroit was unnecessary, unless it was for short business trips that now happened once or twice a month and didn't last longer than three days at a time.
He gave his lover another few minutes, before he decided that there was one last thing he needed to do.
"So you're basically our angelic sheriff?" Dean laughed good-naturedly at the thought, even more so as Cas frowned and raised a doubtful eyebrow.
, exactly?" Sam heaved a sigh, one he reserved for 'how do I deserve such a dense brother' kind of situations - as such this moment doubtlessly qualified.
Castiel Shurley did this job because he loved flying. He did it because he wanted to be above the clouds as often as possible, all the while he relished in the chance of sharing his joy and contentment in an environment that didn't hold any danger to his heart and soul.
"No," came the immediate protest from the blanket mountain which began to move right after, spitting out a rumpled and disgruntled Castiel.
He may not have been a virgin anymore when he met Dean, but he still considered his lover as his first true sexual experience. Of course couldn't the other man know that his lack of same experience had made him shy and hesitant over the years. And that phone sex was nothing he would ever have even considered trying.
"Yes," Castiel growled, knowing just as well as the other man that there hadn't been the necessity to say it out loud. And make him blush. "Anyways. His family likes me, and I like them. I want that, I really do, Balthazar. I just don't know how we're supposed to make this work any longer. We're rarely ever see each other, and if we do, it's oftentimes only for a few hours, sometimes a day, and that's it. I mean, every second is great, but... it's not enough. And I wonder how long this can go on like this. I mean, I... I don't even know... I mean, obviously there's something, but we have never..."
“No,” Raphael again, sounding as close to ruffled as angels can get. Deanna hears a curious sound, a sort of
The next morning dawns crisp and gray, and Deanna would pray to God for no rain if she knew He wasn’t such a dick.
The car is quiet, now; no Sam bitching about her choice in music, or beginning another trip to Crazy Town with a
It's the same abandoned barn they arrive at and subsequently scribble all over. Dean finishes laying out their gear on one table despite knowing it won't do them a lick of good, and knowing it won't need to. He glances over at where Bobby is completing a complicated squiggle of a sigil. “That's a hell of an art project you've got going there.”
“Don’t be sorry,” he tells her, and runs his fingers through her hair. She would never admit to it in the cold light of day, but in the coziness of the room with just the two of them, she nuzzles into the touch and sighs, content.
. You already do.” Hey, this confessing to a Castiel he can’t see and who can’t say anything back is actually pretty nice. Dean’s aware that that probably makes him an asshole, but Cas lo—likes—
“One day I’d like to fly in an airplane,” Castiel says, jolting Deanna back to the present. She shudders.
Bobby looks forlorn, head dipped low as he eats in silence. Sam glows with power, his whole being radiating with demonic essence. Dean, at least, looks somewhat chipper.
And that’s all, folks! Might come back to this ‘verse sometime in the future, so if you liked my Deanna, leave a kudos or drop a comment and let me know if you’d want that, and what you’d wanna see, or other general thoughts about always-a-girl!Dean.
“Before the Apocalypse, Heaven may have been corrupt, but it was stable. The Staff was safely contained.” Castiel sighs. “Like I said, it's been chaos up there. In that confusion, a number of... powerful weapons were... stolen.”
Deanna thinks. “Balthazar,” Castiel begins. “You won’t give me the weapons you stole from Heaven, but I would still ask that you stand by us in the fight against Raphael. You won’t be able to have any... ménage à douze if Raphael rules Heaven, not after you turned his vessel to salt.”
It’s also the times when they were so low on food, Dean resorted to giving Sam the full sandwich and eating the scraps—the crust—and the times he carefully picked mold off of the loaves to make a passable meal.
See, this is what Dean had hoped to avoid by not telling either of them about Cas’ last words. He didn’t want the—the
Dean stares at him. Cas stares back. Dean prematurely folds, eyes darting back to the crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich in front of him. It’s never a good idea to start a staring contest with an angel. The bastards always win.
“No clue. Let's find Sam, though, see if he knows anything. Even if he didn't make a deal, him acting off is reason enough to be suspicious.” It's not even a lie, more of a not-truth.
Castiel had left shortly after, promising to check in on Dean the next night. He’d also reminded his friend that he need only pray and Castiel would come. They both knew the rising of the witnesses was the first trial the hunter would face, and Dean had grimaced when reminded of that fact.
Castiel doesn’t respond, just looks down at his hands in his lap. Deanna nudges him again before he goes into a full-on brooding session, surly and hopeless and unresponsive and despondent and everything Deanna hates to see in him.
“You smote them with the Staff of Moses!” Castiel accuses, donning his “I-Am-An-Angel-Of-The-Lord” voice. Deanna sighs.
The angel wastes no time in attacking Castiel with his angel blade, but Castiel blocks the swipe with his own.
“Michael’s got a—a spear, or somethin’. I’m still working on finding the name, but once we do, maybe we can use it.”
“He took off earlier, said he was gonna rally the troops or somethin’. Think he’s hoping we can get this show on the road sooner rather than later.”
“'Cause of Christopher Birch.” Ed knocks over a bottle of booze. He watches it spill for some time. “Oh, damn it.”
She half listens to the conversation, most of Bobby’s side being noises of acknowledgement, until he loudly says, “He what now?”
“Plus, it served a purpose: Jack was able to absorb all the cosmic energy getting tossed around, so he got stronger. It looked like Lucifer was winning—almost did—but then wham! As he’s leaving and giving this asshole speech, trying to convince Jack to join the dark side or whatever, Michael appears behind Lucifer and stabs him when he turns around.” Dean smirks. “And again, an archangel dying releases a lot of energy, if you catch my drift.” One squeeze.
They let a few more minutes pass without saying anything. Castiel, for one, is soaking up the feeling of being near Dean, allowing himself to relax fractionally when so close to the bright-burning soul of Dean Winchester.
“Why don’t you make some calls, Bobby? See if you can shake any ideas from any of your contacts,” Deanna says, rubbing her eyes and slumping lower in her chair. She looks up, notices the time, and does a double take. “But I need my four hours, and so do you, old man. Let’s restart this tomorrow.” She pauses. “Cas, how much time do we have until teenage mutant ninja angel is ready to go?”
“Two lovebirds, one dies, the other goes to get her back and fails?” Dean says, pleased and a smidge too smug at Sam’s look of surprise. “I
Dean sighs and scrubs a hand over his face, looking far more tired than Castiel remembers him to be when they first met. “Bobby’ll come around if we tell ‘im, but probably not right away. I need him in my corner
I'll be updating this as I write the chapters from now on! They're plotted out, just need to be written down. I'd say expect a new chapter in about a month, but who knows? Maybe the muse will strike sooner.
After catching Sam up on everything, first Cas then Bobby disappear from the room, the latter giving her brother’s shoulder a squeeze and a muttered,
Between one blink and the next, Deanna and Castiel shift from the dingy motel room to a living room, with a man seated on the couch, cutting out a section of a newspaper.
Deanna gathers herself, then thrusts her cell phone into the angel’s hand. “Mind taking a picture? I wanna see.”
“You two done? Or can I state the terms?” The Entity sounds annoyed. Dean and Castiel both turn to look at it, and Meg’s hands clap together again. “All right! Here’s the deal: you two walk out of here, not a hair on your heads harmed,
Dean can feel Bobby's eyes on him, probably wondering how he knew before, but the older hunter just says, “Well, don't get me wrong: I'm sure gladdened that Sam's soul remains intact, but it does raise a sticky question.”
“Well. That’s good.” She pauses. “Wait. You can see my soul?” She doesn’t know whether to feel creeped out or embarrassed—or both.
“Summoning Castiel.” Bobby is still looking at him like he's nuts, so Dean continues, “It's time we faced this head-on.”
Deanna’s eyes dart around the room, trying to discover the source of the noise. Her sweaty palms tighten around the weapons in her hands, uselessly. She then notices the door, innocently ajar diagonally to her right.
“Sorry,” she sheepishly replies. “Anyway, we were getting our asses kicked, so you shoved me into another room. I noticed a door open by itself, so I went in. It led to the basement, and that’s when Gabriel showed up.”
“I have been patient,” Raphael intones, “but you have stretched the limits of my mercy, Deanna Winchester. I’m going to eviscerate you, now, in front of all of your,” he sneers, “
, Dean catching Cas up on what Sam and Eileen have been up to, carefully avoiding talking about his version of coping. Finally, Dean can’t take it anymore; he knows Cas is with him—in every sense of the phrase—but he feels like he’s suffocating, like Cas planted seeds in his stomach with his goodbye that have been growing ever since, and now Dean is choking on all of the flowers growing in his throat.
Cas pipes down eventually, and Dean grimaces as he remembers the ordeal with Jimmy and Amelia and Claire. He jots that detail down and underlines it before turning to Bobby, casually asking, “Up for a ride?”
Finally, the roof begins to rattle, the panels flapping up and down. The two hunters grab a shotgun each, and retreat to the back of the warehouse.
Cas out of the cosmic afterlife going to be easy, because when were things ever easy for the two of them?
“Yes, I remember,” Castiel responds, then he furrows his brow. “Why? Are you going to make me go to another den of iniquity?”
As soon as Cas reaches her, he lays his hand atop hers, healing the gash in her abdomen instantly, as well as the rest of her lacerations and bruises.
Bobby seems to have the same thought, as he stands up and walks towards them from behind the book-covered desk. “Mind if I join you?”
Dean pounds on Bobby's door until it swings open, the older hunter's face crinkled with that familiar annoyance before smoothing out with complete shock.
“No catch, I swear to Dad.” He crosses his fingers in an x over his heart. “But wait: there’s more! You see, that’s what
There’s a moment, where the two of them look at each other, crickets chirping around them and stars spinning above them, before—
“Hey,” she softly says, “it’ll turn out fine. Just you wait. Balthazar is gonna bust in here any day now with the lance, and then we’ll kick that teenage mutant ninja angel in the ass.”
She’d woken up when it was still dark out to Cas’ fingers brushing through her hair, and the angel saying her name in a hushed voice.
but decides to ignore him. He rounds on Jack (or, rather, turns his head just a tad, the rounding is more of an attitudinal or perhaps spiritual type of thing) and demands, “Well? Care to elaborate?”
Dean ignores the jibe, instead questioning, “But I’m holding his damn hand! ‘Course I’m gonna know Cas is with me.”
“It’s designed to kill Lucifer, though?” Deanna needles. Balthazar nods. “Does it have to be used by Michael, or can anyone use it?”
“Yeah, you think I don’t know that, Cas?” Dean snaps. “That’s fucking priority number one, okay? Detach Sam from Ruby and her schemes and we might have a shot at preventing Lucifer from getting sprung.”
“Well, now Raphael will have to go shopping for a new vessel. Should give me a nice long head start on him. Until next time,” Balthazar says, and Deanna takes a few more silent steps forward.
encounter angels, maybe they, uh, embellished the size and power of Michael’s stick, if you know what I mean.”
Gabriel’s eyes zero in on her. “Yep! And let me tell you, I am definitely getting the short end of this stick, kiddo.”
Dean rests his head on the kitchen table, letting the cool surface lull him into a doze. He’s awakened by the quiet
She jolts, right hand automatically going to the knife in her boot before she realizes just who has appeared next to her on Bobby’s back porch. She sighs, something she feels she’s done more in this one seven day stretch than her entire life before, and says, “Cas. Remembered us ‘mud monkeys’, finally?”
Adjusting her grip on the steering wheel again, Deanna tries to think of what she’s going to do next. The goddamn capital-A Apocalypse was just averted thanks to the help of the power of love, or whatever. She thought that shit only happened in movies, but then again she and Sammy have always lived a life filled with more suffering and drama than any soap opera she’d ever seen when she’d been bored and flipping through the channels on a shitty TV in one of the motel rooms they’d grown up in.
Agents Green and McVie from the FBI aka the Fleetwood Bureau of Investigation, because they don’t actually say the aliases used in 6.03 and I really love Fleetwood Mac.
It’s a combination of texture, and taste, and the wisps of a warm kitchen filled with food and love.
Once Sam and the demon bitch are both dressed, Ruby telling Sam, “So, call me,” and Sam replying, “Yeah, yeah, sure thing, Kathy,” and Ruby informing him with an affronted air, “Kristy,” and Sam sheepishly responding, “Right,” as he shows her out the door, Dean watches the whole exchange closely.
who I am.” Dean waits for Cas to acknowledge that. He gets no extra pressure, so he swallows his fear and continues, “I’m not the ultimate killer. There was no reason to kill Chuck: Jack told us he was powerless, so there was no point. So… we walked away. Left Chuck groveling in the dirt.
The demon regards Dean as if he's a particularly annoying bug that needs swatting. “Lying's a sin, you know.”
The glass shatters with a well-placed blow, just as it did before, and Dean grabs the same water bottle and slakes his thirst with the same enthusiasm, just as he did before. He already knows what date the newspaper will read, but picks it up anyway.
Rufus says something else. Bobby’s face flickers with an expression of interest, reflected in his voice when he asks, “Did he now?” He continues writing the information Rufus is relaying, then asks, “They fish out his bones?” Deanna sighs. Sounds like there’s some grave-robbing in her future.
Halfway through, Cas having settled back in his chair, all but twiddling his thumbs as he watches Dean chew, decides to interrupt the tranquil atmosphere by saying, “You deserve good things in your life, Dean.”
“Go inside, Claire,” he says quietly, before stretching his wings and flying to a warehouse containing his past, present, and future.
“No,” Jack says. “It will be—difficult. I can open a doorway, but it’s going to be a trial. For both of you.”
Dean laughs again, so he doesn’t cry. “I think I know what he wanted, Jack. He wanted to save me, again, and all that got him was dead. Again. So spare me the bullshit, okay? Cas is gone, he’s not coming back, and I ain’t gonna beg you to bring him back. That’s not me.”
“So, uh. Well. I know you can’t talk back, but—” Dean has another lightbulb moment. Score. “Wait! Squeeze once for yes, twice for no. Capisce?” One squeeze. Dean allows a moment of smugness for doing literally the bare minimum to find a loophole in the Entity’s rules before continuing with his original plan: updates.
They seemed to be everywhere at once. Roaming his back and kneading his shoulders, trailing down his chest and stomach, firmly grabbing his ass cheeks through hindering fabric and rubbing and rolling his nipples to sensitive attention.
Heaving himself from the bed after having disposed of his phone on the nightstand, he went to the bathroom to clean up. He was too tired to shower, feeling as relaxed as he had aimed to make Castiel, and barely managed to brush his teeth before he fell onto his mattress again and struggled to get under the sheets. He was asleep not even five minutes later, slipping into unconsciousness with thoughts of Cas on his mind.
?" Castiel pulled a face at that, and he was aware that Balthazar didn't require a verbal answer anymore then, so he saved the energy for the lecture he was sure going to get now.
Staring into the cabin, he let his eyes roam over the passengers, all busy fixing their belts, talking to their neighbors, reading, or just waiting for the soon-to-come start. It was a curious mixture of people, old and young, casual and business, excited and unhappy and even grumpy. Since 8th Heaven didn't offer any Business or First Class seats, their planes' cabins created a passenger manifest that was quite unusual, and always fascinating to Castiel. Even more so if there were especially interesting people on board. Like, for instance--
He had noticed him before, of course he had. It was hard to miss that man, for that beautiful face alone. Still, as the passenger so far had been very quiet and unobtrusive, Castiel hadn't had any contact with him yet, aside from probably at one point the obligatory greeting and farewell before or after a flight. He hadn't paid much attention to him either, apart from his short moments of staring when little breaks in his routine allowed him to.
Castiel breathed heavily, his fingers digging into Dean's shoulders, as he slowly rose his head to look at Dean.
Their short walk back was a rather fast one, though they also did their best to take their time at least a bit, so they could make the most of every second. And it was done so in silence - walking next to each other, fingers still linked, shoulders bumping. The smiles on their faces told whole tales, as did the joy reflected in their eyes.
want, it was to be alone. He was not good when it came to relationships of any kind, and he had never even dared to think about, much less hoped for finding someone one day. And definitely not someone like Dean. Even if it didn't work out in the end - which he doubted, for some reason - he rather had that now, than regret his whole life to have not even tried it.
"Hey, I'm sorry I didn't say it right away, but I'm sort of... taken." He didn't know what reaction he had expected, but it certainly hadn't been low laughter and her readily assuming her normal seating position that left some space between them again.
- the book lying next to it as if he wasn't listening to anything around him at all, but now turned into a vibrating giant shaking with laughter he worked hard - and failed - on suppressing the sounds of.
"No," Castiel shook his head, "you go, I have a meeting to attend before I can leave, and it wouldn't take too long now."
"Gosh, you're as much a spoilsport as he is. You're just lucky I love you both enough to be capable of respecting your wishes every now and then."
"Says the man who hates flying. Besides, to go anywhere by plane you need money, Dean," Cas grumbled, trying and failing to give his lover an equally disgruntled look, instead letting himself be kissed again by insistent lips and a clever tongue. A hand came to rest on his waist as Dean turned fully towards his lover, then slipped up his side and finally around his shoulder to press him close as Dean deepened the kiss, effectively making Cas forget whatever he had wanted to be unhappy about.
Domestic flights weren't a dream job, not when it came to work within air travel business and one's desire to see the world. But, as he knew, there were also worse occupations to be had, and Castiel wasn't all that bothered that he was able to stay in known territories, so to speak.
"No, angel, don't ever think I'd do that to you!" Dean exclaimed while rounding the bed and, after throwing the paper bag Castiel only noticed now on the desk that was standing on front of the window, wrapped his arms around the still bewildered flight attendant. "Well, okay, so we've only known each other for a short while, and, uh... like this," he moved his head back and forth to indicate the two of them, since his hands were occupied holding his lover, "an even... shorter while, but Cas, I'm not... you gotta know, I'm not doing this. You know, just leave without a word.
"Yes, Dean. I'm fine," he thus replied, smiling warmly and taking the object of offense from him. Within seconds he had cracked the seal, and squirted a bit of the clear substance onto his hand, before he handed the bottle back and boldly let his hand sneak down their bodies and into the other man's briefs, where his wet hand closed around Dean's cock.
"Hey, Sammy," Dean eventually said, quietly, a smile on his face, and turned around. There he stood, his brother, finally with them again, and Dean let a tear escape from one eye, and then second from the other, as he hugged his brother tight. He pulled back after a while, and held his arm out to Cas, who joined the hug with the man he loved and the brother he cared so much for.
"I will make sure of it." Dean could have sworn there was a hint of something else there, something that spoke of a yearning that remained unspoken, and desperately hidden. All of a sudden Castiel began to fidget, just a little bit, barely noticeable, but he felt strangely aware of the other man, even though they weren't more than casual acquaintances.
"Um, next Friday in the early evening, I guess, as usual. I should definitely be back before you return." There was silence on the other end of the line, and a strange feeling settled in Dean's stomach. "Cas?"
But cold - cold wasn't a part of perfect. It was killing the perfect. And it was ridiculous because it shouldn't even have been there. That was the whole reason for the arrangement. Okay, part of the reason, but still, an essential one. Being warm thanks to the arrangement. Not cold. Shivering and curling in on oneself and waking up at all times when he could have been sleeping peacefully.
"I wish I had wings..." Castiel replied thoughtfully to Dean's enquiry about his dreams and hopes, "I could fly whenever I wanted to and not be limited by anything." He sighed. "Didn't have to wait and hope for being hired by an international company."
"Of course, Dean. I merely wanted to assure that you are all right. And you needn't worry, the residual grace left during the healing process also won't affect the functionality of your urinary or reproductive system."
Unbeknownst to him, despite their one and a half star haven in sight Sam was in for a lot more Grumpy Dean. Grumpy I'm-very-manly-and-don't-feel-pain-even-if-I'm-winding-in-it Dean who didn't want any help.
Slumping against the nearest wall, Castiel took a deep breath and exhaled slowly through pursed lips.
"Unless you have hooked up with someone," Jo exclaimed, not even bothering to make it a question, and Dean groaned. "That's it, isn't it?! You got lucky this weekend!"
"It was my pleasure," the flight attendant answered, and the color rising into his cheeks was more than a little endearing.
Of course he and Cas had to answer questions, and not few of them. Every detail of their first meeting was enquired, as was how they had taken that next step from passenger and flight attendant to, well,
Silence answered him, and when Castiel managed to open his eyes he hadn't even noticed closing he was met by a look he could only identify as worried.
The following evening and night were uneventful and - much to Dean's relief, not that he would have openly admitted it - painless. At least what Cas had done had helped, even if the older Winchester preferred not to think too much about it.
Castiel was about to allow himself to feel relieved, when, as soon as Gabe was gone, Balthazar leaned in suddenly. The younger flight attendant reflexively wanted to take a step to the side, however the other man kept him in place with a hand on his hip when he pressed their cheeks together and brought his lips close to his friend's ear.
Living in the bunker was spoiling them, no doubt. A proper home, a real kitchen, an archive and a library, and of course beds with memory foam mattresses. Memory foam! It could have been so perfect.
It was right on his flight the following Monday that Dean was in for a surprise. Arguably not one of the good variety; not entirely at least.
"You know what, I can't watch this anymore," Gabriel all of a sudden announced, and though he should have known better, Cas was about to let out a sigh of relief. That was until he heard the chief say, "come on, Balthazar, we gotta do something," and vanished through the curtain, closely followed by his colleague.
