"I'm sorry Tony, Bucky and I explained to the others everything that happened and how we all made mistakes but Clint well... he still harbours certain feelings about being here and what happened between all of us." Steve said gently getting up and sitting on the bed next to Tony.
"How about Buck and I take you on a walk tomorrow? Nat can talk to Clint I have a feeling she'd probably be able to get the most out of him anyway."
"Shame, that would be fast at least." He reached over and grabbed the bottle of whiskey that was sitting on the bar.
"Because it's weird, and don't look at me like that you know I'm right. I'm sure you'd agree with me Widow." Always count on the super spy to be rational even if it was about her partner.
"We? Who we? Because if we is who I think it is then I might just walk out right now." Or he might just suffer a mental breakdown whichever happened first.
"I just wanted to see if we could talk if that's okay?" Steve asked gently he always spoke so gently to Tony now. It was strange.
"I know it was, but everything will work out Stevie. We'll get doll back before you know it." Bucky said placing a hand on Steve's shoulder before leaning up for a chaste kiss that was deepened by the other man. Steve's hands gripped Bucky's waist and he pushed the man up against the nearby wall until Bucky pushed him away.
It seemed like someone was going to interrupt him when he heard Natasha whisper not to disturb the genius.
"Divide and conquer. It's an old tactic but usually effective, Vision and Wanda are both pretty heavy hitters in their own right. Clint provides aerial support, it could be possible that they think that by reducing your numbers they can take you all out." It didn't feel right though, it felt like he was still missing something.
"Well let's see, my ex boyfriend who lied to me and left me to die in SIBERIA just happened to show up in my hotel room with his super soldier BFF. So no Buckeroo if anything this one bottle isn't enough for the amount of bullshit that is currently my life."
"We can talk here if that would help? The Dora Milaje are right outside no one can hurt you here." Steve said sounding so understanding and so sympathetic that it almost hurt.
He looked down at Tony's lap and then back up at his face again. Steve wanted-- he wanted so badly in ways he didn't even understand. "I want--" Steve stopped himself, cheeks turning a tinge pink. He swallowed and then sighed.  "Tony, that felt really good," he whispered like it was a secret.
They both didn't mention that if Steve wore his uniform people would be able to see the back of his neck.
"Right." Steve guessed he really didn't know anything about drugs. He had never had reason to; now that he'd had the serum, most drugs had little or no effect on him and wore on too rapidly to be of any real use. "I thought a lot of stuff was endangered now, because...to quote Clint,
.  His body ached from tensing over and over, and he was certain his dick was bruised; it was not dissimilar to the feeling one got from wearing a cock ring for too long.  (Of course Tony knew what that felt like.)
He briefly thought back to the racetrack and how possessive Tony had gotten. Something stirred low in Steve's belly-- yeah, he liked that. He swallowed and sipped at his tea, realising he was almost blushing alone in his very own living room.
He tilted the bottle up and took a long, deep drink, trying to chase away those painful childhood memories.
"...I think a lot of people were drinkers after the war," Steve said quietly, eyes dragging down to the real life model on the desk before them. He stepped around, peering at it. "It has a remarkable amount of detail, don't you think? Lasted well too."
The women rolled her eyes and sauntered off; Pepper looked down at Tony.  "...that was Arcadia Rivas. She and Chloe Madison are the hosts of
Tony got up and went to the kitchen to fold some coffee ground into a napkin and put them over his face.  Natasha was right; the smell helped clear his head.
George had a flat in northwest Hollywood, and after some rather confusing directions, Happy found it and dropped him and Donner off.
"You know it," Sam told him with a wink before heading upstairs. That man's confidence would never cease to amaze Steve. Not that Sam shouldn't be confident, but his casual attitude about being an acer around a superior officer was something else.
He could ballpark how many there were.  More than a dozen, less than twice that.  But for some reason, not knowing whether it was sixteen or eighteen made Tony feel a small, smug sense of victory.  That their attempt to torture him by forcing him to remember had failed, at least a tiny bit, because he didn't know, at least not fully.
"In for two and out for two. That's it, but slower. Don't try to talk, just focus on breathing. That's it. In for two and out for two..." Steve's voice was soft, encouraging and understanding. Because he'd been before. Being a good leader hadn't just been about the battle, it had been about off the battle field too. Steve squeezed Tony's fingers again. "Just go slow. Don't rush it. Just focus on breathing. In for two and out for two..."
"Go ahead and resist," hummed Gideon.  "The longer you wait, the harder it will become.  I've heard your heats come on unusually fast, don't them, Steve?"  He pulled one hand away from behind Steve's ear, keeping the other in place, and licked his fingers.  "I should also like to remind you, Steve, that one of your Alphas is currently under the care of SHIELD, which is overseen by the WSC.  Keeping him alive is both a massive security risk as well as a huge cost drain. It would be very, very easy to eliminate him. I'm happy to keep Barnes alive for you, if you would show some gratitude."  His hand went back to Steve's scent gland, massaging it; it was slippery with oil, a result of Steve's preheat and the stimulation.
It was like a rollercoaster. One minute they were happy and okay and it felt like Tony was the only person in the world he could truly trust, and then this- now Tony didn't want him. Steve could feel it. It was like Bucky again. The familiar heavy pit of rejection and dejection swelled in his chest and Steve thought he was going to be sick. He wasn't right- before he'd been sick, weak. Now he was strong but he was broken- there was a sickness in his mind.  A sickness that might be HYDRA's doing, somehow.  Who was the Winter Soldier? What did he want from Steve?  How the hell had HYDRA managed to entangle the Winter Soldier with Bucky?  Did they have an ancient Bucky locked away somewhere?
"I'm not going to share him," said Tony.  The words were growled, not spoken. Gleason noted the bristling, the slight curve of his upper lip.
Steve checked his watch.  "...another twenty minutes.  I'm hitching a ride back with some of the MI-13 guys."
DeSoto paused for a long time, then muttered, "Jeremy.  But please don't call me that. They get mad if we use our old names."
Tony stuffed his hands in his pockets, feeling pleased with himself.  In the new simulation, Steve had fallen and Tony, his Alpha, had caught him.  Which was precisely how Steve's subconscious should see it.  Tony was his Alpha, his protector, and when threatened, Tony had appeared to save the day.
"Good."  Tony stifled a yawn, the glass bottle still cold in his hand.  He poked his head into the gym and his face split into a grin; pop music was playing and Steve's back was to him; he was lifting weights with the focus of a guy in prison.
. Whether it was about his work, or sex,  or annoying SHIELD... he kept himself busy, just like Steve tried to.
Numbers Nine and Twelve, the ex-Miss Teen Illinois, stepped out of line; Twelve grabbed Seven's hand, and virtually yanked him off the stage with her.  Seven was clearly struggling not to cry; Number Twelve hauled him after her with a sort of grim determination. Number Nine, on his other side, took his other hand.
It was sort of frightening, how quickly Steve's mind slipped from their conversation to him dropping to his knees like it was as simple as breathing. Is this what Frond did to her omegas all the time? It must have been terrifying when they were first bonded.
He still had every intention of going to lunch before going down to Pendleton to test out SHIELD's fancy little brain-scrambler, but he could feel that they weren't going anywhere for at least fifteen or twenty minutes; his knot was still throbbing and Steve's body was tight around it.
Steve shuddered as Tony's fingertips dragged over him. He felt serene- like he was floating. Like this wasn't quite real. Like Tony wasn't here with him- as if this was just a fantasy. He could have easily been. He often dreamed of having an Alpha who would treat him as an equal. Steve never thought that was truly possible.
"I can honestly say I don't regularly think about having sex with hostages right before rescuing them, but maybe I'm the weird one," said Clint scathingly.
Between outings with Natasha and Sam and Tony, Steve was wading through press releases and public appearances, guided by Aria.  He had an upcoming dinner at the White House and had spoken in passing with Agent Coulson and Director Fury about getting into the field.
He heard the door click and his breath hitched a little.  He didn't dare look up to the Alpha he was alone with. He didn't exactly like Chantelle, but at least he knew her.
Outside of the bedroom, they rarely used titles.  Tony sometimes affectionately called Steve "omega," but in the bedroom, it took on different connotations.  Steve called Tony "Alpha" never failed to make Tony feel... big. Powerful. Like he truly was a dominant Alpha, one who could fulfill the role he was expected to, the role of a protector.  In the bedroom Tony was no longer
People were beginning to file through into the dining hall. Steve only hoped he wouldn't be sat next to anyone too pretentious. He squeezed Tony's elbow. "I'm sure he'll be fine.  He's Nick Fury, after all.  C'mon.  I think we're being summoned."
"My suit..." protested Tony weakly, but Rhodes helped him to his feet and dragged him, towel-clad and still clutching the vase, back upstairs.
"--here, let's get you some food, share some with me, okay?  Okay. So the thing about the spring break special is that we were shooting on location but the Bahamas were
"Captain Rogers really can't leave the premises," Sitwell piped up from his place at the edge of the table, hands clasped in his lap. He watched Steve devour the rest of his breakfast with mild disgust and curiosity. Steve ignored him watching. "Headquarters have been very clear about that. Pierce has issued an order."
Tony had been escorted through all sorts of protests in his forty years.  You made plenty of enemies as a weapons designer. This was the first time he'd ever had to shove through a protest that wasn't directly toward him.  And somehow, that made it worse. Because these people didn't hate Steve for actually killing anyone, which was a pretty legit reason to hate someone.  Tony had been called a killer and a murderer and he'd even had a couple of assassination attempts ("For Sokovia!" A place Tony doubted he'd even be able to find on a map...) but he had always felt a sort of smug sense of deserving.  Like it was an accomplishment, somehow.
Was he still dreaming? Steve reached over, grabbing his phone. He had a few messages from Aria and Banksy.
Suddenly, his vision started to go. He walked into a pile of boxes, knocking a few over, and realized he was screwed. He fumbled for his phone, but couldn't see the screen.  StarkTech phones had no buttons and required one to be able to see the "keypad."
strip," he said, handing it to Steve.  "It's a non-orientable structure with a single boundary and a single, continuous surface.  It's the topological quotient of a torus that has zero Gaussian curvature and a Euler characteristic of zero.  I mean, you can represent it in a three-dimensional Euclidean space as having an x value of cosine u multiplied by one plus half-v cosine half-u, and a y value of sine u multiplied by one plus half-v times cosine half-u, and z value of half-v times sine half-u, but obviously, plotting it parametrically or using cylindrical coordinates is like, way simpler, you just set the log of r sine half theta to equal z cosine--"
Yes, Steve, tweeting is the bird thing.  God, I hope ownmega starts trending, that's a great hashtag."
Why hadn't he told anyone?  He didn't want to be seen as weak.  Didn't want their pity.  He wanted to die in peace, and dignity, without doctors prodding him, without Pepper looking at him like he was a delicate, wilting flower.  He had been through all that when he'd come back from Afghanistan and it had been humiliating.  Tony hid his wounds, both physical and emotion, like a wild animal.  He could handle the pain himself but he was loathe to drag Pepper into it.
Happy slammed the brakes.  The car behind them swerved and blared their horn, narrowly missing them.  Every bodyguard in the car was already reaching for their hip holsters.
The hair on the back of his neck stood up at the brush of Tony's fingers and he swallowed. "It's still- it's still sensitive there," he said quickly. Steve didn't want Tony touching it. It wasn't that it hurt, really. He just felt
"They can write us up when we get back from Yemen," said Clint.  "Nat, take that thing off of him and let's get to the jet."
"Okay, look, if this is too much, just tell me to fuck off, okay?  The thing is, Steve is in heat and... the last time it was sort of a disaster.  He needs to take all these meds to keep from getting knocked up but both of us are so completely out of our minds that we can't really... follow the schedule very good."
Tony wasn't kidding about crashing.  Within the first ten minutes of the movie he'd closed his eyes, letting the alcohol drag him down into a deep, dreamless sleep.  He was barely conscious when he cuddled up to Steve.  It wasn't a purposeful action; Tony craved Steve's warmth, his smell, the texture of his skin.  He wasn't thinking about what it meant, what anything meant.  He just knew it felt good and that the last forty-eight hours had been an emotional war for him.  He needed the serenity that came from being close to Steve, from holding him, and being held.
Sometimes Donner wished he could be like Steve but he simply didn't know how. And right now it was about survival, about being
He tried to push away Gideon's touch but he could barely move his own arms. He could feel panic rising in his chest. Steve, for once, was actually afraid of Gideon. For once he wasn't the stronger one. He was defenseless and he'd put himself in this goddamn position.  His gut had told him something was wrong with the STRIKE team. Steve knew he couldn't have gone with Rumlow. But then they were just following orders, weren't they? They must have still known something was up.  And the water.  Steve had known it tasted weird.  He never should have finished it.
"...Mr. Stark..." said Malick, who looked like he felt the need to intervene but wasn't certain how to go about it.  "...do you typically drink this much?"
Steve shouldn't have been surprised when he was woke up the next morning, not by the alarm, but by both the phone ringing and a pounding on his door.
"Ruined," said Karpov darkly.  "I've had him nearly thirty years and they've reduced him to a mess.  That damned witch... I don't like her. Never have. The control we have over her and her rabbit, it's tenuous at best."
"Let's get something straight.  We're an integrated special operations team.  We're not here to help you hug things out when you get into a fight with your honey bun.  You told us you could go undercover and that you could do so without getting in too deep.  We didn't say anything when you bonded, because we understand these things happen.  But we can't ignore that your bond has compromised our organization and what we stand for and what we're here to protect.  You're on thin ice, Rogers.  You want to be the face of omega rights?  Then get up off that floor and start acting like it.  We hire omegas because we believe anyone can be strong, but what you're doing right now?  It's not the behavior we expect from Captain America.  This isn't a damn dating service.  This is an elite team that I've fought for years to keep integrated, and shit like this from omegas makes us all look bad."
"-see, this arm piece- this is sort of a single piece.  That's because all the circuitry inside is wired up together.  You've got pistons in here that run the whole length of the arm.  But what I'd like to do is have an armor made up of smaller pieces with fixed circuits in nodes or ports that basically click into each other and can self-assemble.  It's like if Clark Kent didn't need a phone booth anymore... it's like... like, can you imagine, if I could just snap my fingers, have the suit at my beck and call?"  Tony was getting a gooey-eyed look normally reserved for new parents talking about their babies.  "...the gantry's always been the big weakness.." he said softly, sorting around the pieces of wire and metal in front of him like a rat rearranging its nest.  "...that was what killed Yinsen."  His voice had taken on a hard edge.  "...it didn't power up fast enough... it was too heavy... it was locked into the platform..."
Sure, he never had a dad but he could appreciate the embarrassment of a supposed authority figure walking in on them. Steve liked the private to stay private, and all that.
"Forget the Expo, JARVIS, I'm making something big here!  Well... something small, actually, something very small... an atom, actually... how the hell did he get access to my personal line, anyway?  That guy shouldn't be able to call me--you know how annoying I think he is."
Clint took a small, running leap at one of the supporting struts, kicked off the wall, and grabbed the edge of the catwalk, pulling himself up onto the mezzanine.
Tony snorted a little at the joke.  Two glasses of scotch in, he was feeling slightly more at ease.  But he still wasn't going to put the collar onto Steve, at least, not while anyone was watching.  It was far too intimate.
Tony gave the microphone a couple of taps.  "Hello?  Is this on?  Can I get this-"  There was a shriek of feedback and everyone groaned.  Tony winced.  "Oh, ouch, that was unpleasant- oh, good, there we go, that's better- can you hear me in the back?"  Tony pointed the microphone toward the crowd.  He was walking easily around the stage, apparently unperturbed by the vast, empty space, or the fact that he was in jeans and a t-shirt.  "...kind of embarrassing that we still haven't figured out microphones, huh-"  The crowd laughed easily; Tony was talking to them like he was in front of a friendly crowd of twenty friends instead of a sea of strangers.  "-well, it's good to be back- I kind of miss the dancers, though, to be honest, feels weird to be up here without them-"
In the relative privacy of his massive living room, teaming with orchids, Tony stroked himself lazily, thinking of Steve, thinking of the way he swam through the water, the gleam of his smile, the way the little beads of water traced lines on his skin, and darkened his soft blond hair... the way they sparkled in the sunlight like jewels on a collar...
"Yeah, I figured that out," said Tony, dragging a hand across his face.  He looked over at Steve. "...Steve, what is it
The truck had already started under them and they were headed out.  He gripped the bench he was sitting on, watching her closely, because Karpov had told him to.
and so he got out without being too messed up.  I, uh, you know, they sterilized me and that's actually how I met Richard, he did all my reconstructive surgery because they fucked up my knot-- artificial knots were a fad back then, they don't do that anymore, I don’t think, thank God... sorry, I'm going to ruin your dinner.  You should get back to your friends."
"That's it! That's the end of questions!" a woman called, the lights dimming on the stage. Before Steve knew what was happening Tony was pulling on his hand and guiding him up and off the stage. They walked down the steps and Steve's legs felt like jelly.
Steve ignore him, nuzzling into his head.  When he told Tony he was good person, Tony's heart seized a little in his chest.  He wanted to refuse it, to deny it, but he didn't have the chance; there was a knock on the door.
Steve was already hard; Tony kissed his shaft, running over it with his tongue, tracing the vein on the underside up to the head, where he flicked the edge of Steve's foreskin before running over his head.  Steve's cock was wonderfully familiar to him even though it was so completely different him his. Uncut and without a knot, Tony had come to appreciate Steve's anatomy in a way he never expected to. With his hands, anyway.  This was only the second time he'd ever gone down on Steve but from the sounds coming from above, he was doing a good job.
Tony rolled over but didn't move to get up.  He lay on the floor, breathing shallowly, one hand on his chest.  He could feel the arc reactor's warmth through his clothes.  Natasha was staring down at him, her face haloed by energy-efficient bulbs.
"...okay.  Okay, fine.I'll see you soon, Tony, yeah? Get your ass over here," Steve said, a fondness creeping into his tone.
When they got back to the house it looked about as awful as Steve expected. Happy was snoozing against the couch right by the door and Aria was ushering a very drunk woman and gentleman out the door. "Where the hell have you been?" she asked, peering over them both.
But, smell aside, watching Gleason drain the back of Steve's neck made Tony's stomach turn, especially the noise of the fluid being poured down the drain and the way Steve was going gray and clammy.  At some point, without realizing it, Tony offered Steve his hand, and Steve gripped it desperately, eyes watering, teeth gritted.
No.  Steve wasn't his omega.  Steve didn't want him.  Not like that.  They were just friends, friends who had experienced something weird together.  Steve wasn't in heat anymore.  The kneeling had probably just been due to... who knew, maybe, emotions had been high, neither of them were thinking.  Tony asking Steve to kneel in the first place was way out of line.  But he'd apologized and Steve had forgiven him and now they could move on.  Steve was a powerful omega and a captain in the armed services; of course he didn't need some weak little Alpha like Tony to feel validated.
The clatter had attracted the attention of the men in the room.  They turned, spotted Steve, and began shouting.
More skipping on the reel obscured the first part of Howard's reply.  "--right.  Even if I mess up, he'll be able to figure it out.  He'll be alright."  Howard sighed and rose.  "Okay.  That's good enough for now, maybe we can shoot another one tomorrow?  I just need him to understand that this is his."  He gestured vaguely to the model in front of him.
She walked out of the room and, less than a few moments later, Dr. Gleason walked in, a newspaper tucked under his arm.
Did Tony believe that Steve was a virgin?  Honestly, he wasn't sure.  And he didn't care.  Steve saying he was a virgin implied he had never bonded, either; bonding without mating was a bizarre concept to Tony.  A bizarre concept to any Alpha.  And
Pepper sighed.  "...give him two or three hours to come down.  Enjoy," she said drily to Steve, tucking the reports under her arm.  "I have to head into the office but if you could get him to sign the statements I left in the kitchen, that would be wonderful.  Full disclosure: Tony gets horny when he's tweaking. ...ask Beth, she knew him in the nineties." Pepper rolled her eyes affectionately.
A piece of the rock wall above Tony's head exploded suddenly, showering him with pebbles; Tony ducked behind a partially demolished fountain.  "I've got a few more guys over here.  I can't hack into anything without tripping the alarm.  You need an access card.  Seriously, where's Clint?"
It required a bit of clever thinking.  The slot in the door was too narrow to allow a proper cup, but managed to procure a wide, flash dish, not unlike a pie tin, and fill that with water.  He took it very carefully back downstairs so that he didn't spill any of it.
Tony gave Steve a weak smile, but it didn't reach his eyes.  He could feel Steve's uneasiness in his gut.
Steve just shrugged. "A relationship isn't a competition. I don't see how his success would pull me down, or vise versa. We lift each other up."
Steve hesitated. "Well, I'm sorry about the consequences..  If Nick ever calls me government property again then I'm not coming back to SHIELD," he promised him, jaw tight.
"Oh.  Gee, really?"  Clint scratched the back of his head.  "...huh. Well, you know what I mean, though."
Eric seemed even more uncomfortable at Steve and Tony being cute, the omega leaning back into his Alpha's touch on instinct. Steve had to try not to laugh at Eric's floundering over how to describe him.  He was proud of being unruly and he felt a bit of grim satisfaction any time anyone at the conference looked offended by his behavior.
John was friendly and all but he referred to Steve as Tony's omega, which the blond wasn't all that fond of.
Happy was waiting for them out in the car. Before, they'd considered having Steve waiting with him, but that was evidently a bad idea if they wanted Donner to actually come with them.  Steve had desperately wanted to be on the "front lines" of this operation but had recognized he'd be better off waiting at home, with Tony.
"If Alphas respected us they wouldn't attack us when we went into heat," Steve said quietly. "But you go into heat twice a year, right? You can't let two weeks of your year dictate how you're going to live the rest of it. No, heats aren't easy. They're messy and vulnerable and, yes, I would know; I've been in heat on a battlefield before."
"Well, that would've required Dad to talk to me, and he preferred to pretend I didn't exist," said Tony flippantly.  Anger surged up in him again.  It had always pissed him off how people, omegas in particular, worshiped Howard.  Sure, he'd been smart, but he'd also been a lousy father and, near the end of his life, an abusive drunk.
As usual, he was well aware that Steve was big and strong enough to push him off, but some emotional or psychological barrier prevented him from doing so, and Tony felt strong as he pushed Steve down and crawled on top of him.  He ran his lips over Steve's jaw, recently shaved, soft and smooth; one of his hands reached up to cup Steve's cheek, and Steve's head turned automatically into the touch; Tony pressed his nose into the junction of his jaw and ear, his tongue flicking out to taste Steve's skin.  He could feel Steve's body quivering under him, vibrant, longing; Steve's smells were nothing but pleasant, eager, willing, accepting.  Tony couldn't quite describe Steve's flavor, only that it screamed comfort to him; it was the smell of his sheets when he came back from a long, hard business trip and he was exhausted and the promise of sleeping in was imminent; it was the smell of Christmas morning when he was eight years old and Jarvis woke him up and he ran into the front room and, inexplicably, Howard was there, even though everyone had warned him that his father was probably still going to be in Tokyo and he shouldn't get his hopes up much; it was the smell of Pepper's hair when she had just washed it and she was bending over an earnings report with high numbers, her breasts just barely concealed by her blouse, her green eyes sharp, intense, talking numbers to him, a recently sharpened pencil scratching over the page in front of him, the sun rising at his back from the thirty-second floor of their Manhattan office, a fresh cup of coffee within arm's reach.  It brought back a million memories that Tony didn't even know he had but every one of them was a perfect moment, perfect and peaceful and intensely nostalgic, and every one of them missing this one thing, his omega; Steve was the missing puzzle piece to a perfect life.
The trick to car-stealing was to get something ubiquitous.  Motorcycles were easy to spot. Bucky hadn't been on a bike since the eighties.
Tony's eyes lit up with interest and he walked toward the den; Pepper grabbed his arm.  "Don't. That's his."
Now that she thought about it, she and Tony were drifting apart and had been since Afghanistan.  She decided her New Year's resolution would be to try to spend more time on their friendship. The company sucked up a lot of her free time, but she didn't want to wake up one morning and discover their strange little friendship had dissolved.
One of the women looked down at the picture he was pointing to.  "Everyone knows him.  That's Captain America," she said.  Her accent was much thicker than the doctor's.
A twinge of anxiety flared up in Tony.  He had felt so blissful, so at peace.  But now he remembered.  He wasn't the only one to lay claim to this omega.
He rolled out of bed, wincing on his bad ankle.  It was a lot less swollen; a night of having no weight put on it had done it good.  Tony threw on a t-shirt and a pair of board shorts; outside it was a dazzlingly sunshiney day and he was thinking he might float around in the pool for a bit.  "JARVIS, I know you're already doing a whole bunch of stuff, but if you happen to have any free time, could you also start compiling a list of all the people who sent us flowers so I can make Pepper send out thank-you cards?"
"Yeah," Steve said. "Better than we've been in a while actually. It's nice. I mean, we've come a long way, you know?"
"Fuck," she said, looking at the three half-conscious bodies in front of her.  "Fuck, fuck, fuck..."
sake Tony. I'm so goddamn sexually frustrated you're going to kill me. Jesus Christ," Steve said and he actually sounded annoyed. But not angry - the kind of annoyed he'd get when Tony accidentally poured coffee all over himself: fond but exasperated.  "I'm not Captain America right now. I’m Steve goddamn Rogers." Steve let out a frustrated sound. "Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I like it? Maybe I like being submissive? No, I can't say it out there because out there I'm the captain and I'm a symbol.  But here I'm not. Here we're supposed to be honest with each other. I don't want to give you what you want just to make
“I get the feeling that you want to hit me.” Steve was watching Tony’s hands carefully, but not nervously. There was always that calm acceptance about Steve that drove Tony mad.
“Oh, yes, yes it is!” Steve bit down on his arm and Tony saw it, he rifled around him, found the bottle of lube and coated his fingers with it, then slipped his fingers inside Steve once more. He put in four and Steve clenched around his hand so Tony slapped him hard. Steve bucked his hips but relented, allowing Tony to start working him.
“Now that’s more like it.” He drew a hand back and slapped that perky little butt and Steve yelped. “This ass was made to be ridden Steve.” Steve dropped his head onto his arms for a moment and tried to catch his breath, but Tony pulled his arm back and spanked Steve as hard as he could, leaving, disappointingly, only a faint red mark. But he did notice Steve’s cock start to dribble and he grinned. “Oh baby did you like that. Is that your thing? Or have you never been spanked before. Never been treated like the bad boy you are.” Tony purred seductively.
“You absolute pervert Stark!” Steve leaned down and grabbed Tony round the waist, flinging him over his shoulder into a fire mans carry, ignoring Tony’s protests.
“There we go, normally we can’t get you to shut up about patriotism and shit, don’t go quiet on me now baby, show me how much you want it.” Tony sat back on his haunches and stroked himself, watching as Steve caught his breath, taking in the sight of Captain America bent over an armrest in front of him, naked and flushed. If that wasn’t the sexiest thing he had seen in a long time…
He tried to think back through the fuzzy haze that was his mind currently. Sure, Steve in his tight sparkly outfit that showed of the contours of his body was attractive, and Tony liked attractive things, but his good Christian boy attitude and justice obsession was such a turn off. God he fucking hated it, his stupid attitude and his ridiculous shield and he practically had eagle wings sprouting out of his back.
“He’s my friend! You think I haven’t defended you to others for some of the shit you’ve done in your past.” Swearing, Tony was certainly getting to him,
Steve looked up at Tony once more, glaring at him for a moment before he took one hand off the other man’s waist and ran his hand up Tony’s thigh, he leaned in to Tony, running his rough cheek up Tony’s shaft until Tony threw his head back and moaned deeply. He reached the head of Tony’s cock and wrapped his tongue around it, slowly, languorously and closed his eyes, Tony pulled his head off the wall and looked back down at Steve as he encircled Tony with his mouth, he bit his lip as he watched Steve slide his lips down Tony’s member, Tony felt himself growing at the feel of that hot mouth enveloping him and he reached down, entangling his fingers in Steve’s pretty boy hair and holding on tight as Steve started to work him with his mouth, Tony could feel Steve’s tongue on his erection, stroking it, teasing it and then moving as Steve started to bob his head.
Steve just watched him rant with an amused look on his face, not even attempting to move his body to let Tony pull his suit off easier.
Steve gave a token resistance before Tony put him on his back, he trailed his hands down Steve’s sides, using his fingernails on the skin and making the other man twist and shiver under him, he reached Steve’s legs and yanked them open, taking a moment to enjoy seeing Steven Roger’s pink little asshole and his baby blue eyes filled with lust. He ran his hands back down Steve’s thighs, knowing he was driving Steve wild, and then took his hips between them, Steve pulled Tony into his body with his steel legs and Tony pushed the head of his cock into him slowly, nudging at him inch by inch, Steve once again moaned deeply, breathlessly and Tony found himself in sheer delight that he was the cause of that throaty sound. He looked down and caught sight of Steve’s suit and that delight mingled with the softened anger from earlier and he thrust himself into Steve without ceremony. Steve screamed and gasped as Tony’s entire length entered his body roughly, Tony thought Steve might protest but instead he grabbed Tony’s hair and took Tony’s mouth roughly with his own.
Steve’s eyes widened in reply, but before he could open his mouth Tony grabbed his waist and flipped him over, this time there was no resistance. He pulled Steve’s ass up into the air as Steve rested his elbows on the arm rest grudgingly.
It was Steve’s turn to laugh and he let go of Tony, who propped himself up above Steve once more, he reached behind his head, did some magic and started to pull the suit down, but he was too slow for Tony, Tony grabbed it and yanked it down his torso, revealing the Adonis beneath the suit. “God you’re ripped it’s actually ridiculous like seriously. Every damn time I look at you. You’re a walking Calvin Kline advert.”
Tony mused to himself as he felt a second hand slip under the waistband of his boxers, this one made its way round to Tony’s now fully erect member almost timidly, and Tony rocked his hips in Steve’s hands, offering silent encouragement. Dear innocent Steve, he was going to have a whole new world open up to him.
Tony caught his breath, gulping down as Steve pulled his lips up Tony’s cock and swallowed, causing that gorgeous mouth to tighten around his tip, he couldn’t stop himself from thrusting into Steve’s mouth, he expected Steve to stop him but instead Steve wrapped his large hands around Tony’s ass and pulled him into him, taking Tony’s fully erect cock all the way down until Tony could feel the tightening flesh around his tip. Steve sucked in hard as Tony thrust into him, hollowing his cheeks and sliding his mouth up and down with a measured calm that made Tony want to scream at him. He gripped the back of Steve’s head and continued to stare down, watching his slick cock slide in and out of Steve’s mouth, he could feel the precum leaking from the tip of his penis and then he felt Steve lap it up with his tongue and he let out a guttural, primal groan that made Steve squeeze his ass hard enough to most likely leave handprint shaped bruises. Steve now started to pull Tony to him in time with Tony’s thrusts, letting Tony fuck his mouth as hard as he dared. Steve took it all, swallowing down on him as if he were made for it.
“Oh for fuck’s sake Steve, Levi’s? Really. Does Fury not pay you enough; does he exploit your kind nature? I’m buying you underwear for Christmas; Captain America should be wearing Versace.”
Steve closed his mouth and Tony took the silence to continue his critical analysis of Steve Rogers’ body. His eyes worked their way hungrily over the v that dipped below the atrocious boxers, and across the perfect washboard stomach, up to the bulging, hairless pectoral muscles. That caused him to ponder if all of Steve was hairless, he’d soon find out. His eyes continued to rove up Steve’s solid shoulders and perfectly outlined collarbones, up the soft skin of his neck and onto the slightly (for once) stubbled jaw, the swollen lips, the straight, perfect nose and onto those ravenous blue eyes that were staring right back at him.
before even realising he was already thinking about the next time. He laughed and Tony opened his eyes and looked up at Steve, one eyebrow raised. With his face flushed up his cheeks, his eyes steamy and sultry and his mouth working on Steve’s cock Steve knew he couldn’t hold it much longer. He thrust into Tony’s mouth and Tony’s hand slid up his leg and under his balls, until it reached Steve’s still slightly sore asshole. He pushed one still lubed finger inside and Steve clenched his jaw, a cry still managing to escape him. Now Tony worked on his cock with his mouth and his ass with his fingers, sliding in another finger to join the first, curling them into Steve, seeking that glorious nerve bundle. He found it and hit it hard and Steve erupted into Tony’s mouth, his hips jerking erratically, his hands digging into the sheets and his toes curling as he arched his back and thrust once more into Tony’s welcoming mouth. Tony took it all, closing his eyes and still working Steve’s ass as Steve rode out the climax into Tony’s mouth. He hit that little bundle of nerves once more and Steve came again, his hips bucking wildly and a cry tore from his lips as he threw his head back onto the bed. He’d never had a multiple orgasm before and the pleasure was so intense it was almost unbearable.
Pepper appeared at the top of the stairs. "Spare sandwiches, if anyone wants some," she said and set them down before sinking into the sofa with a sigh.
Steve took the water and opened it, drinking it greedily. "I like proving points. You know that. It's my thing," he pointed out and then he put the phone to his ear. "Besides, now everyone knows we went collar shopping. Gotta have a reason for--"
"I think Fourteen's going to be this year's high bidder," said Fred.  "Eyeballs aside, Fourteen is gorgeous."
And that Rhodey was a threat.  And that maybe, just maybe, this was why Steve didn't want him.  Maybe he hadn't proven himself yet.  Or maybe Rhodes was encroaching on what was rightfully his.  Rhodey was, after all, a much more dominant Alpha than he.  And Rhodey was, like Tony, unbonded.  Competition.
Steve was wiggling into his touch, begging softly; Tony let him come down slowly, still holding his shift, his fingers still inside him, grazing his prostate.  It occurred to him that, at least in this moment, they'd cross some sort of weird barrier.  Steve was calling him "Alpha" and Tony was telling him he was a good boy, and it all would have been insulting and out-dated in anywhere but the bedroom.  If anyone else were to see or hear this, it would be political suicide for Steve, but it was just the two of them and it felt romantic and deeply personal.  Again, that dreaded "i" word: intimate.
"Hmm," said Dr. Brennan thoughtfully.  Her pager went off suddenly before she could follow up her hum with anything substantial.  She checked it. "Steve, I'm very sorry, but I've been called away on an urgent matter. I'd like to continue this discussion on a daily basis for the next week, at the end of which I'll share with you my recommendations.  You understand that, while what is said in here is confidential and protected by HIPAA law, if I think you're going to hurt yourself or endanger anyone else, I will have to say something... and that at the end of our time together, I do have to advise SHIELD and the DoD about what's to be done with you."
She got up to gather up the two pieces of the box and dispose of them.  When she returned, her mug and teabag had disappeared, buried under a pair of hand towels on the outer edge of Phil's nest.
isn't perfect. But if you really have feelings for me then it doesn't matter. Fuck biology; if you want something, you should take it."
There was a sudden, loud honk behind them that echoed through the concrete parking garage; Tony jumped and whipped around to see a young blonde women.  It took Tony a moment to recognize Kate-from-down-the-hall.  She was holding a key fob in one hand and had a gym bag slung over her shoulder; she smiled at them.
"It's beautiful, huh?" said Tony cheerfully as he showed Steve proudly around the penthouse, which included a helipad and a mechanical gantry programmed for his armor.  ("Not that I'll ever need it, but... y'know. Iron Man.")
"You're right," he said grudgingly.  He leaned forward to take Steve's face in his hands.  "You have no idea what it sounds like, do you? Everyone saying, over and over, how Bucky would kill me?  Does it occur to you that I'd rather die fighting for my omega than let everyone stand up for me like I'm a baby bird or something?"
"Try to keep yourself out of trouble, will you, Captain?  My reach only extends so far." Fury sounded... tired.
The bartender stared at him in confusion, accidentally spilling the vodka he was pouring.  He swore quietly as he handed Bucky the shot and went to go get a rag to clean up the mess.  Bucky threw it back, again without any indication that the liquor burned. The man beside him watched him uneasily.
"Use sheets!" Steve said, despairing as he turned on his feel and headed to Trickshot's room. He swallowed.
Downstairs, Tony's sense of contentedness was short-lived; he plucked at the guitar for a while, then, itching for something to do, looked over some of the notes scattered over his desk.  Tony was awful at note-taking.  His father's careful, delicate lab notebooks were the exact opposite of Tony's style.  Tony wrote notes on whatever was handy; he relied on JARVIS to help him digitize and organize it later.  Notes were scrawled on scrap paper, napkins, sticky notes... anything handy.
"Since when are omegas so goddamn level-headed in heat?  You want it. I want it. We're all adults here. I say we have a good, hard hate-fuck and then never talk about it again," said Tony.
"Down, boy," said Natasha.  She was only half-joking; Tony's hackles had been up for nearly an hour and he was oozing enough aggression to make even her uncomfortable.  "We want to scare him, not obliterate him. If you're sure about this, c'mon."
Tony blinked with exhaustion and grabbed Steve's hands, pulling them onto his arc reactor.  "Steve. Feel the heat. You're not cold, you're feverish. You don't have frostbite, I promise.  You're warm. Put your hands on my heart if you want them to be warm," he said. His voice sounded exhausted, even to him.  "I'll get you a bath, okay? You're doing great. We're both doing great."
He pulled out Pepper's itinerary to look it over; he had no major investment in any of the various things she had planned for that and frankly planned to hit up the hotel spa as soon as possible.  He knew he didn't have to go to London to that, but whatever; it was
Steve was taller than him, but they still fit together surprisingly well.  Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's waist and set his chin on Steve's shoulder.  Steve pulled the covers up.  It was perfect.  Tony had never realized spooning was actually pleasant before.
He wasn't tired, not really, but he held Steve, waiting until his breath was slow and steady, before slowly, slowly untangling them and getting out of bed.  He eyed the plate of pastries next to the bed, grabbed one, and bit into it.  He barely tasted it; he put it back.  God damn.  Now that he was awake, he was restless.
Walking around Tony's house in basically no clothes was strange...it felt like he was flashing because of all the big windows even though there was no one around to see.
sorry." He sounded so sincere it was gut wrenching. Aria looked about ready to cry. She knew Steve could get bad, but she'd never actually seen him in this sort of state before.
He pulled the shield away from Steve and crammed it under the pipeline to check the level again.  It was perfect.
"Can I get two double burgers and a lot of chips?  Like three servings of chip?  And a shepherd pie?"
She seemed even more confused about why Tony Stark and Captain America would be at a dive bar on Frying Pan Avenue for Tony's birthday.  "Didn't you blow up your house on your last birthday?" she asked.
"What happened in Yemen was fucked up.  You shouldn't've gone there. But I also think this gives you a chance to really... pull apart yours and Tony's relationship, and work on it.  Double-bonding doesn't make you any less of a person unless you let it. I'm not saying what happened was okay. Just that there's a silver lining here.  That sometimes, when shit happens, it's a blessing in disguise because it leads to a lot of great things happening later down the line."
Banksy was watching her closely.  "...if he needs someone who knows what it's like, I'm here.  ...let him know, will you?" he said softly, in a low voice. Pepper nodded.  Like Tony, she had grown up with Banksy and Boswell; knowing how they had come to be bonded had radically changed her perception of them.  She was still unclear on who arranged the bonding and how, but hadn't asked; that was ancient history and Banksy seemed happy enough with his Alpha now.  Still. Being part of Tony's rich, gilded, rose-glass-filtered world meant her perspective had grown somewhat naive. Knowing how prevalent forced-bonding was made her skin crawl.
Tony cast a look at Steve.  Tony had a strict policy against getting chummy with locals.  Also, he was starting to notice that Steve's life was packed full with other Alphas that Steve seemed pretty friendly with.  There was Natasha and Sam (who Tony still hadn't met but imagined like a male version of Natasha, complete with sexy Russian accent) and now Kate-the-nurse-from-down-the-hall.  It made sense, of course; there were lots of Alphas in Steve's line of work.  Nonetheless, it put Tony on guard.  Or maybe he just still felt self-conscious because they had only bonded so recently, and also only recently gotten over their first fight.
to be but because they weren't ever given the opportunity to be anything else. Put people on a straight path chances are they'll take it, even if it's not the right direction for them. Would you have bonded Gideon if you could have gone to college, or something else? Sorry, don't answer that, that's not fair of me to ask--"
Tony flashed Steve a grin and reached for Steve's hand, lacing their fingers together once again.  Gently, he took the microphone, turning it off.  "Kneel?" he murmured, softly.  It was a request, not a demand, and it was made gently, tentatively.  Steve could tell Tony wouldn't be mad if he didn't want to, but he had come to understand Tony's brand.  Tony was bold and brash and confident and unapologetic, and he liked shoving himself in people's faces.  Tony preferred to demonstrate things instead of describing them; the Expo was a living monument to that sentiment.
. So claimed. His body practically sagged in relief, his arms falling down by his head. Steve belatedly realised his knees were probably pink and sore along with his elbows. His serum meant it would be gone within the day but it was there for right now.
Steve frowned a little. "When did I say I don't want an Alpha? I mean, I shouldn't...who could cope with my lifestyle?" He didn't deny that he was aroused, because it was true and Tony could already tell. "And especially with the stunt I pulled yesterday."
"We couldn't afford that kind of stuff," Steve said quietly, looking up as Tony walked over to the fridge. He was currently drinking straight out of an orange juice carton himself. "Because I didn't get heats properly I probably would have never gotten pregnant, or if I had, the chance of survival would have been... That life was never an option for me. It made me feel inadequate, but it was also never really what I wanted."
"What did he say to you, Steve?" asked Natasha.  She was more interested in the practical questions.  If the Winter Soldier was trying to lure Steve somewhere, then something was wrong.
"Well, you were getting pretty worked up outside, before you know I was bonded.  I know how it is.  You get obsessed and everyone seems like a threat.  ...do you like chardonnay?  We have chardonnay and a sauvignon.  ...Meha only drinks white, I'm afraid, so if you're a Merlot guy, then you're out of luck."
"My mommy and daddy said monsters hide under beds," she said and then pulled Tigger's ear from her mouth.
He reached out with his right hand and drew a curved line, then another straight one under it, and another straight one under that.
"We're not all big like you.  No omega is," said Ten softly.  "I want an Alpha to protect me. I don't want to get attacked every time I go into heat."  More were nodding.
The keys also weren't in his jacket, anyway, but his waistcoat. Although Steve didn't think it a good time to mention that.
Tony practically purred when Steve came in, looking like an Adonis, wearing virtually nothing and bearing food.
Okay.  This was fine.  He was fine.  He was panicking, yes, but he'd been through worse.  There were a dozen people in there, senators and ambassadors and dignitaries, who wanted Captain America.  And Tony wasn't going about to go to pieces in the White House foyer.
Tony had been bumped ahead so many grades as a child that he'd never had sex ed.  His sex ed was limited to Obadiah telling him to be safe in college and tucking a condom in his wallet.  Therefore, he had no idea that what he was doing was courtship behavior.  Besides, he'd always limited himself to betas.  This behavior was new to him, and he was doing it not because he knew what he was doing, but because... well, it just
"Of course, Captain.  Now, if that's all your questions...I recommend bed rest. No strenuous exercise and plenty of iron in your food."
Clint ducked as Steve threw the shield prototype right back at the other's head. The omega captain was on his feet again, jaw a little set in frustration that the moment had been ruined. Maybe it was a little embarrassing getting caught doing
"...that's what he calls it."  Happy checked his watch. Tony was chronically late and today was no different.  Pepper had once remarked that Tony having a private jet wasn't a luxury, but a necessity, since he'd never be able to make a commercial flight on time.  "Ginny told me that you two are going to the Alphas' United conference. Isn't that co-hosted by the Gentlemen Alphas' Club? You know what you're getting into, right?"
"This is insane," he breathed. Steve took the flowers off of Tony and went to set them down on the table. If their honeymoon period was nearly over that meant Steve's first interview was...what? A few days? He suddenly felt nervous. After the expo and his Tony's reveal there would be so many more questions. He hoped he could hold his cool. It was time for him to really make a stand, after all. Steve wouldn't be timid about his civil rights agenda. He was anything but timid.
"Yes Nat," Steve sighed from where he was draped over his sofa, lazily flicking through to channels. "Only one more day now. I've got this."
The doctor opened his case, pulled on gloves, and then slowly peeled away the bandage. The gauze against the wound was wet and tinged yellow from leaked serum. Gleason threw it into a plastic bag which would later go into the trash and then fetched wipes from his case to clean around the wound. "So, you were shot a few days ago...?" he guessed.
. Steve knew he was really no better and the last thing he ever wanted to be was a hypocrite. He was quiet for a moment as Tony talked and Natasha said something about leaving now. His hands twitched in his lap. Steve's left arm felt uncomfortable but his right was the one bandaged up. Maybe he'd hit it with his encounter with the wall or something.
"Do you ever just... wish you could stop thinking for a while?" Steve murmured. He guessed that was why Tony was hitting the booze hard today; Malick and his parents' up coming anniversary. But Steve couldn't get drunk (right? He'd never really tried to figure out a way to get drunk; the serum dampened the effects of most drugs considerably, as did his size.) There was no real escape for him, not right now.
Suddenly Tony wondered whether this was about Barnes.  There had been a lot of Barnes-related imagery in his simulation and Steve had been watching.  Remembering Steve's old Alpha made his dander rise automatically, but he didn't want to make Steve feel bad.  Barnes was dead.  Or, if not dead, then missing for sixty-six years and well into his nineties and not a threat.
"--don't think mine's playing, it's really not her thing," Hal was saying as Steve returned to them.
a HYDRA base?  HYDRA, like, the guys who tried to kill you recently?" repeated Tony.  In an instant, his hackles were up and he was bristling.
They kept to the back of the class to attract the least attention. A woman clapped her hands and dragged everyone's attention to the front and the class began. The leader of the group was called Melinda and her voice was calming the instant she began talking. Aria and Steve sat down, listening as Melinda started talking about the importance of an 'aura', or something like that.
he thought to himself.  He snorted softly; the phrase was twice as funny considering he was cuddling with someone who was practically a living version of G.I. Joe.  Steve probably didn't know who that was, though.
They left with cheers from the crowd and general whooping noises made in their direction. When they piled into the car Steve felt his head spin a little and so he leaned it against the window, his eyes slipping shut. Sitting down felt really nice.
Maria Hill was a fierce beta. Steve didn't know her all that well but he knew it was dangerous to underestimate her. And right now she didn't look so happy. Steve sighed. "I'm pretty sure that Justin Hammer teamed up with Ivan Vanko- the guy from the racetrack. He must have helped him fake his own death too." He pressed his lips together in a thin line. "They had these ‘bots...they were attacking people, and Tony. And James Rhodes’ suit appeared to be out of his control. Vanko had a suit of his own- which is how I got thrown against a wall. We thought we had him beat but then his suit was set to self-destruct and destroyed the entire building."
Steve knew Tony was trying and he felt bad for being so unresponsive. Maybe he should shower, clear his head. And if Tony was asleep he could back down to the gym again. Or he could look for B- what the hell was he thinking? He couldn't abandon Tony when he was at his most vulnerable to go after another super-soldier who didn't even remember who he was.
"Literally nothing?" Steve echoed, blue eyes bright with mischief and voice deceptively soft. "Well then, I guess won't bother trying...but I did have an idea in mind," he hummed and pulled away, feigning seriousness just to wind him as he walked into the wardrobe, dropping the towel as he went. He grabbed the clothes him and Aria had agreed on earlier - black jeans, a white shirt, navy blue waistcoat and a tie to match. The tie was
He took a quick shower and then dressed in jeans, tee, and a hoodie. Steve couldn't do much to hide one of the bite marks higher up on his neck, but aside from that, the evidence of their previous activities was gone. He pulled the duvet back over Tony before he headed downstairs to find the 'head shrinks.'
Tony pulled on one of Steve's shirts (too big, but God, it smelled amazing), let himself out of the apartment and walked down the hall to the guy who had been smoking.
"Tony, seriously, in the last three years you've done a ton to stabilize the Middle East.  The whole Iron Man thing is great... now lay down, I wanna rinse this vase out..."
Steve went downstairs to cook up some dinner to find there was almost no food in the house.  He pulled out of his phone and ordered them two pizzas; he was feeling too lazy to cook. It took less than half an hour to arrive. The first pizza didn't last very long; he ate it in under ten minutes, working out in his head how long Tony had been in the lab.  All day, it seemed.  At least six hours.
His grip on Steve's neck loosened as both of them went limp.  "Fuuuuuuh," mumbled Tony inarticulately against Steve's neck.  The ridges of the original bite brushed his lips and his whole body shivered; his flaccid penis twitched weakly inside of Steve.  He had a brief, wonderful flashback of Steve kneeling, of himself circling, of that first wonderful bite and how he'd shoved himself into Steve and claimed him.  His knot was still swollen, but he didn't care, he didn't want to pull out anyway.
He didn't pull his gaze away from the window.  He felt pained that Steve didn't want him touching his neck.  Tony had meant for it to be a kind gesture, letting Steve know he didn't care about the other's mark.  ....he did, of course. But he wanted Steve to know that he was still desirable. Steve's shyness made Tony feel awful.  Like he was in trouble, almost.
The memory of teeth sinking into his neck shuddered through him and Steve's eyes flew open.  He lashed out, knocking Clint away with some force, arms in front of his face, ready to defend himself.
"I'm just here to give you guys an anniversary present!" he said and moved around to the boot. And from that, he produced a hamper, which, for all intents and purposes, looked entirely innocent. Steve wasn't sure what he'd be given. Guns, knives? He sort of hated using both. He hoped they were would give him some kind of blunt weapon...but there definitely wasn't space for a shield in that thing.
Maybe it was normal for Steve to feel emotional right now.  Hormones and junk.  They would feel better in a few days.  They hadn't even know they were--
In Steve's humble opinion, it was probably the best Christmas ever. Steve wasn't freezing for the whole day, and they had food and real presents. He'd always just drawn Bucky pictures each year. He'd never been able to afford actual things before. Although this year Steve hadn't strayed too far from his usual style. After two movies and a very long bath Steve gave Tony his present.
Tony recognized a primary suit weakness was reliance on the gantry to get it on and off.  He wanted a suit that could self-assemble, something like the Mark IV, but better, lighter, faster.  The lesson he had learned from the fiasco with Vanko, and having to get the suit stripped off him afterward, was that gantry armor was impractical and that, when attacks came suddenly, without warning, he couldn't be properly prepared for them.
Something hard and heavy, rope-like, wrapped around his body and the screen in front of his face scrambled almost immediately.
"If you wanted an omega you could just buy one.  They had auctions and everything," said the soldier, remembering.  "That's how come I took him. I didn't want him to ever end up there.  I wanted to protect him."
He caught a random stream of trains, going between multiple tube stations, his hood up the whole time, before he finally stepped off and used his burner phone to find a hotel nearby. He paid with cash, not card, and headed upstairs for the night.
Tony sat next to Steve.  The seats were fake leather, he noted with amusement.  Why they hadn't sprung for real leather was beyond him.
. Suddenly the whole of Steve's body felt like it was on fire. He collapsed onto his knees and groaned. The pain, it was unbearable, he couldn't- Steve sucked in a shuddering breath, the shocking pain gone as quickly as it came. Phil knelt down beside him and pressed a hand against Steve's forehead. "It didn't work," he murmured.
He took the liberty of looking up Gleason's little support group while he had a moment alone.  It wasn't hard to find on the web. There was a phone number.
They dozed most of the day away. Steve only woke when they brought in a hospital dinner. It was some sort of lasagna. The meat was processed and the vegetables watery but it was warm and filling and that was all Steve really cared about. It felt so good to eat proper food again after eating nothing for so many days and then being on a drip. They drank their tea cold after. It was still sweet.
The Winter Soldier seemed to freeze for a brief moment. HYDRA agents were closing in and Fury was bleeding out on the pavement.
"Steve and Tony's anniversary," butted in Phil.  "At least, that's what Aria said, last I talked to her.  First week of June."
He went to the bathroom to brush his teeth, gargling some mouthwash to rinse out the bitter taste of gin, knowing Steve was upset with his drinking.  He padded out and slipped under the covers with Steve. The bed was warm, about a million degrees; Steve, as usual, radiated body heat.
He'd never experienced pain like that, not that he was aware of.  He'd been shot and stabbed and hit in the back of the head with a cast-iron skillet, but this... this was unbearable, his heart was straining, he couldn't figure out what this feeling was except that he didn't like it at all and he probably needed medical attention.
Tony flipped open the itinerary.  As long as they were in New York for a week, Pepper had crammed in a few tourist trips for Tony and Steve, plus a couple of board and shareholder meetings for Tony.  She also wanted to meet with some contractors about a new building she was planning. The central seat of Stark Industries was technically in New York, but the Los Angeles building had been catching up... that is, until it had been partially destroyed in 2008 by Tony and Obadiah.  Although they were rebuilding, Pepper had decided they might as well expand the New York location as well, and had an idea for a tower that would include both business and R&D offices, and be entirely self-sustaining. Tony had begrudgingly agreed to support her on the project but as far as anyone could tell, it mostly involved him signing off on things and not really helping whatsoever.
?" asked Tony, looking the kid up and down.  He was dressed... weird.  In slacks and a button-up shirt and suspenders, like he was going to a costume party as sort of Dickens character.  He looked a few years older than Tony, maybe by two or three, but they were the same height and Tony could tell at a glance that this guy probably couldn't win a wrestling match with a well-fed kitten.
His hands had already untucked Steve's shirt and were undoing the buttons of his waistcoat and shirt, fingertips brushing his skin teasingly.  "Clearly I'm a bad influence... let's get you out of these clothes, I don't want them to get all sweaty... bend over the bed for me, Steve, let me take care of you."  Tony kissed his neck, helping him shrug off his shirt. "I'll be good for the rest of the day after this, I swear," he added, reaching into Steve's pants. His hand brushed Steve's erection, his balls, then dug deeper to find his entrance.  Steve was already moist; Tony teased him gently, stroking his hole, enjoying the way Steve squirmed and gasped and tensed, at the warm fluids slowly coating Tony's fingers.
Her long fingers were taut and the asset could see the energy crackling between them; he threw himself across the alley between the buildings.  The blond was still struggling to get up--
“I’m not anymore am I? I’m not welcome here, I’ve never really been welcome here, I was kidding myself thinking I could ever be. They pulled me from the ice with a purpose in mind and that purpose is long gone.”
He backed off of Steve, pulling his boxers off and leaning over the other man, who pushed his lips to Tony’s chest, placing a kiss on his thrumming arc reactor as he rummaged in a drawer next to the sofa. He pulled out a small red bottle and two little packets.
“Well this is weird…” Tony looked from Steve’s chest to his face then to the ground and back again. “Certainly never had this happen to me before…” He looped an arm up around Steve’s neck and sighed dramatically, fluttering his eyelashes at Steve.
‘Call you if I need you, call YOU, YOU BASTARD!” Tony punched the large glass window and yelped. “Son of a bitch! YOU’RE NOT EVEN HERE AND YOU’RE PISSING ME OFF!” He screamed at the window.
Then Steve crawled up Tony and forced his mouth onto Tony’s own, Tony tasted himself on Steve’s lips and drew in a heavy breath, kissing Steve back as hard as his tired body would allow. He pulled Steve into him, Steve’s still dribbling cock dripping down Tony’s thigh as he slid his leg up and down Steve’s own. Steve left Tony’s mouth and worked his way down Tony’s neck and onto his chest, where he bit down hard.
“Yes! YES I FUCKING DO, I RUINED EVERYTHING, I TORE THIS FAMILY APART BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT THEM AND NONE OF THEM COULD SEE IT. EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK MY SIDE COULDN’T BEAR TO HURT ANY OF YOU AND SO THEY LET YOU GO TOO. DO YOU THINK I DON’T KNOW THAT? DO YOU THINK IT DOESN’T KEEP ME AWAKE AT NIGHT? DO YOU THINK I DON’T RECOUNT EVERY MOMENT FROM LAST YEAR IN MY HEAD, WONDERING WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?” Tony could barely breathe, he felt his chest constricting like a vice around his heart and he took gulping breaths of air, sniffing and shaking his head, trying to not let his emotions take over completely.
“Come on Stevey baby, what gets you hot under the all American collar huh?” He traced one finger down Steve’s hip bones and Steve let out a sharp breath. “You know you want to tell me.”
Steve grabbed Tony’s waist and ground his hips up into Tony. “You don’t need to be Stark,” He ran his fingers up Tony’s sides, ignoring the squirming man above him as he did, “you look damn good.”
Tony could feel himself burning low down in his hips and then gasped as Steve drew one hand away from his ass and made its way to his balls, cupping and fondling them, stroking the sensitive skin between his ass and his balls then going back to caress his sack. That was what did it for Tony, he could feel his cock throbbing in Steve’s mouth, who hummed onto his shaft, vibrating it, encouraging it, driving Tony wild. He buried himself in Steve’s mouth, crying out, closing his eyes and having the breath knocked out of him as he came into Steve’s mouth, he heard Steve take in a breath through his nose and then he was swallowing everything Tony had to offer him and that just made Tony lose his mind. He opened his eyes, panting and looked back down at Steve. Steve whose face was flushed, his eyes closed, his mouth still working Tony until every last drop of cum was swallowed. Tony had never seen anything more erotic in his life. Bliss stole over Tony and he untangled his fingers from Cap’s hair, letting Steve slowly draw himself off Tony. He looked up, licking his lips and Tony groaned at the sheer sexuality of Steve’s expression right then. As Steve lifted his chin he could see Steve’s enormous erection, just begging to have something done about it. Steve followed Tony’s eyes and smirked before getting up. He pressed a hard kiss to Tony’s lips and swiped his lips down Tony’s cheek to his jaw where he nipped and feathered kisses down his neck, leaning into Tony against the wall, pressing his erection into Tony’s stomach and grinding against him.
Steve didn’t reply, but he shifted his ass under Tony’s hands and Tony took the meaning. He pulled his other hand back this time, replacing his other hand on Steve’s waist and steadying him. He slapped Steve’s left cheek with all his might and Steve groaned into his arms, he could almost see Steve biting down on his lip, trying to hold the sound in.
Dismay struck him as he realised Steve probably wouldn’t even stop him. Steve would atone, for every bad word, every line crossed, every secret kept, with a punch, or yelling, or being hurt in any way. That was who Steve was.
"I don't know, someone's attacking us. Clint, Vision and Wanda are all out of commission. None of us know how they find us or slip past Wakanda's security, Nat said that we need help if we're going to find out who's behind all of this." Steve said and he did sound like he regretted this.
"Let's go on a run Punk, we should burn off some energy." Bucky said with a grin Steve easily agreeing. Knowing that this was about more than just a run, the room wasn't safe to talk in the only safe place was on the outskirts of Wakanda away from the ears of the Dora Milaje that guarded the rooms.
Of course Steve needed him, of course that's why this all happened. Because who cared if he wasn't ready to see Steve or Bucky or any of them? Who cared if he was still having nightmares and panic attacks? Because Steve needed him, and that meant everything else didn't matter. "Why?"
"I guess it wouldn't be that much difference to what we're doing now... Okay Steve." Tony regretted it almost instantaneously but he couldn't change his mind after seeing the look on Steve's face. Even after everything that happened between them he still loved Steve. Maybe Howard was right after all emotions really can kill your mind.
"Sure, come on in." Tony said closing the door behind him. He had a feeling the man would show up eventually but he didn't imagine it would be so soon.
"Not really Steve, the attacks only happened here and Bruce is as unstoppable as they come and I don't just mean as the Hulk." The Hulk was pretty strong but people should never underestimate what Bruce Banner was capable of either.
"Nat should be able to distract Tony enough for now, tonight I'll go see him, talk to him." Steve had to fix this.
"We showed too much mercy that's true, I know Tony better than anyone I should have known he'd realize that Clint's injuries were less than Wanda's and Vision's." Steve had made a mistake, he had let his closeness and friendship with Clint affect his mission.
"Always spoiling my fun." Tony said shaking his head, trying to keep some level of normalcy. Inside he felt like he was going to break being around them again, but he would never let anyone see how much they affected him. When people saw that then they saw how much sway they had over you. Although knowing Natasha she still saw, he hated how she always seemed to know everyone's secrets even his.
"Steve has a good point, come on I'll show you around. I'm sure Shuri is dying to meet you anyway." Natasha said and Tony wasn't sure if he wanted to accept, he didn't know whether he wanted to get that close to them. After everything that happened wasn't this all just a little too easy? Then again Steve might have just told them to be nice to him since he was here to help them.
"That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about or at least part of what I wanted to talk to you about. Do you still keep in touch with Bruce?" Steve's question did surprise Tony a little. What would Bruce have to do with any of this?
AN: Thank you to everyone that left a comment or kudos on my first chapter and I hope this is as good as you were hoping for.
"I thought we were gonna leave him alone tonight?" Bucky knew that Steve was panicking a little, but when they decided to bring Tony in this early they knew it would be a tight stretch. Tony was smart, resourceful, and strong. This was always a risk and they'd both known it.
"Easy Stevie, we both know it's not safe here let's get back to Wakanda and then we can have some real fun." Bucky grinned as the two of them hurried back to the plane needing to put the next phase into motion fast if they were going to ensure their plan's success.
"You can sit you know. I'm fine, Steve. Besides whoever is strong enough to take down both Vision and Wanda is someone we all need to worry about." Tony said as Steve sat on a chair that was thankfully not too close to Tony he didn't know if he could have handled it if Steve had sat with him. Then again there's not a lot of places to sit in the small room.
"I'm sure, the plan will go easier if we have him by our side. Besides it's been too long without him, I never intended to leave him there Buck, that was a mistake." Steve said as the two of them turned down an alleyway and headed to where their ride was, they needed to hurry if they were gonna beat Tony to Wakanda.
"Not really, he just said he was attacked from behind and woke up not long before we found him." Sam said which confused Tony even more.
"How are you Tony? I know it must be difficult being here with all of us. You don't have to do this." Steve asked standing next to the window as Tony sat down on the bed.
"I'll go." He said softly before turning to Steve. "You knew I wouldn't be able to say no." The words were soft and a little sad, because Steve had to have known he wouldn't have said no. Steve had known him better than anyone at one point in their lives.
"Not like we weren't divided before." Scott said only to have the others look at him disapprovingly.
"Why are you here? Why couldn't I just be going crazy? This would be so much easier if I was going crazy." If his mind had been creating hallucinations of his ex boyfriend then at least he could handle it. He knew crazy, he knew his mind, he could easily handle his brain deciding to fuck up his life. His brain had been fucking up his life for years. But no Steve was actually here, probably.
No major warnings for this chapter, there's some very subtle manipulation by Steve done here but other than that it's pretty tame.
"No, just thinking. Trying to figure out what we should do next." Steve said smiling slightly at Tony.
"Tony you should eat something, you need to take care of yourself." Steve said stubbornly, it felt like every conversation they had before when it came to Tony overworking himself.
"You say that but I have no idea how much help I can actually be when I don't even know that much about the problem." He knew they were being attacked, but that's about all. Really he should have asked more questions about all of this before he left for Wakanda but all he could think about at the time was how badly he wanted Steve and Barnes to leave his room.
"Since when do I sleep?" He hadn't really meant to say it out loud but if there's one thing Tony always struggled with it was controlling his brain to mouth filter.
"Of course not, The Brooklyn Boys would kill us." A different voice said who he did not recognize. Which made him turn around and look at the man. Ah Falcon boy.
"But why those three? Not to be rude or anything but wouldn't Captain America be the better target? Like he's the heaviest hitter." Scott said looking more than a little confused.
Why did he do this? Why did he agree to come? It would have been so much better if he had just stayed in Cuba. But then he knew, he knew he had to be here because whoever was powerful enough to beat Wanda, Vision and Hawkeye wasn't a threat he could ignore.
Tony couldn't believe he was here, that he was doing this. It was a terrible idea, it would end awfully and he would everything but yet he was here. In Wakanda. Waiting for the ex-Avengers to show up so he could do something, he still had no idea how much help he could actually be. He hadn't told Rhodey or Pepper where he was going or what he was doing. After what happened with Rhodey it felt like a betrayal to help the very people that broke his best friend but he couldn't tell Steve no. And Pepper was getting married, it wasn't right for him to worry her at a time like this.
Tony would though, he knew he would help them and they knew he would too. Because as angry as he was at them he still remembered what it was like to be a part of the Avengers. To watch weird Russian soaps with Nat, to playing video games with Clint, laying in bed with Steve and depending on him. They had all been so close at one point and as angry as Tony was that it had come to this he did miss those moments.
"We have no idea, Wanda, Vision and Clint were attacked alone at different places and different times. Wanda and Vision are both unconscious and Clint says he never saw his attacker, he was taken from behind, blacked out and woke up bloody and beaten." Steve explained which did confuse Tony a little.
"Do you think I could talk to Clint it might help me figure out who could have sent the attackers?" Tony asked surprised when Steve shook his head.
"You sure we should bring him in now before we make our move?" Bucky asked unsure about this whole thing.
"While that's true in almost every case, why do you want to take me on a walk?" Tony asked confused why the sudden interest in taking him anywhere.
"Goodnight Steve." Tony said softly before closing the door behind the man and sinking to the floor, he hated this. He hated being here, he wished he had never agreed to help because none of this was fair. He shouldn't have to deal with Barnes or Steve, he shouldn't still love Steve after everything he did to him, he shouldn't feel guilty when it's not his fault things happened like this.
"We were, but baby is too smart for his own good and maybe too smart for our own good too. We made the mistake so we'll just have to speed things up a little. Enough talk though, come on I'll race you back." Steve said patting Bucky's shoulder before running.
"So what you're saying is this isn't some simple take down the Avengers type bad guy? They're big and bad." Sam asked looking at Tony.
"I don't think that's a good idea Tony, Clint erm... he's still coming to terms with being here." Steve said tactfully but Tony was smart enough to read between the lines.
"I don't think so, Thor's in Asgard right? So he's pretty protected. Bruce is okay he just wants to be left alone right now after everything that happened." Tony knew that Bruce needed time, they all needed time really but villains rarely care about what they need.
"I'm so sorry, I know this isn't fair. I know this is wrong of us. But something's happened, and if I could avoid this I would. Because I know this isn't fair to you, but the Avengers are being attacked and I can't figure out who's doing it and I need your help and I'm sorry I really am sorry to ask this of you but you're the only one that can help us." Steve pleaded.
"Well at least if you two have come to murder me and finish the job I can spare myself the mental breakdown I'm about to have. Actually being murdered might be preferable."
"I do agree, I didn't say anything before but it's bizarre. Vision and Wanda are still unconscious even though they were attacked days before Clint was, for him to be awake before we even found him leads to only two possibilities." Nat said sighing.
"I thought it might help us, I know what happened in Siberia was inexcusable I just thought that if we got away we could all talk about it just the three of us. I wish I could have given you the space, I know you're still angry and you have every right to be and every right to say no but we're gonna have to work together to solve this and I just... thought maybe it could help." Steve said and it sounded so much like Steve, so sincere and sweet and caring.
He was about to say something else when the two super soldiers came through the door and any words Tony could think of died on his lips. God damn it, he hated the affect they all had over him but he especially hated how seeing Steve and Barnes affected him.
"You really think he won't work it out?" Bucky asked Steve once the two of them had blended into the crowd.
"Because Vision isn't easy to take down, Vision is a sapient construct, a perfect hybrid between organic and inorganic material. His entire body is a mix between a synthetic simulacrum of organic tissue and vibranium. Add to that his cosmic powers, it shouldn't be possible to keep him down like this." Tony couldn't even think of any of their usual enemies that could do this without making it obvious.
Rhodes rolled his eyes.  "I feel like I'm in bizarro land.  Next thing you'll wanna be cuddling me."
). She grunted with the effort and it felt like her arms were going to pop out of her sockets when she attempt to lift Steve, and immediately gave up on the idea. Sam woke with a gasp and a splutter.
Tony found himself wondering if he was asleep and having a nightmare.  He knew Christine, all right.  They'd screwed like weasels about a year or two ago and he'd been ducking her calls ever since.  Justin was still holding Steve's hand; Tony watched a finger slide up Steve's wrist and he could feel anger coursing through his veins.  It took an enormous amount of self-control not to lunge at the other man.
Deep down, he was hoping this wouldn't affect Steve wanting to meet Taylor Swift, who had been on Tony's "To-Screw" list for a while.  The list was ever-changing, moving people up and down according to desirability (i.e., how hot they were), how hard to get they were, and how big of a scandal it would cause.  Currently, Pepper had occupied slot #1 for close to a decade.  Swift ranked relatively low in desirability (7 out of 10) but high in the other two categories (8.5 in hard-to-get and a delicious, tantalizing 9 in scandal; she was a goodie-goodie female omega who was half his age), putting her average at 8.2, which put her rank just below Salma Hayek (a 9.2 ever since she'd slapped him at a charity gala) and Amy Adams (whose desirability was already at a 9.5, matched with Pepper, and whose hard-to-get and scandal score had been recently both been knocked up to 10s because she was in a monogamous relationship and had had a kid the month prior; she was now just below Pepper with a score of 9.6).
"I did lead an army, that one time," Steve pointed out. Piper was poorly concealing a grin. Malick looked furious and Donner looked... concerned, perhaps for Steve's safety. Or sanity.
"Yes, yes. That's fine," Louis nodded and shook her hand. He turned to Steve. "It's good to finally meet you, Captain. Thank you for letting us into your home, both of you." He said, turning to face Tony. "Pleasure to meet you too, Mr. Stark."
Okay.  This is-- super awkward.  When it rains it pours; am I right, Steve?  Hi.  Morgan.  Right.  Uh, this is Steve, and uh, Steve... well, here's Morgan, apparently..."
Coulson nicer.  Clearly, they cared about Steve.  Anyone who cared about Steve was all right in Tony's books.
Tony closed his eyes, trying to focus on the hum of the engines beneath him instead of the words coming from the news.  "... at a hearing just last week, in fact, where Mr. Stark
"Tony," Steve sighed and lifted his head back up. He nudged their noses together. "I told you. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere." Right now, Tony was fragile; it wasn't a good time to tell him that he'd asked Natasha to look for Bucky, or that Steve wanted to help him. He wasn't sure if Tony was currently capable of telling 'helping' and 'getting back together with' apart.
"Do you think they're doing ok?" Aria murmured to Pepper as she settled back down with her coffee. "They look like they are."
"Ellis!  Rodriguez!"  He greeted both the president and the vice-president familiarly, shaking their hands.
. In movies in the forties it had been cheesy and over the top; that was what made it entertaining. It would take Steve a while to get used to the 21st century sense of humor. He just didn't get it.
"...I need a bottle of water," he demanded.  He felt hot and flushed and on edge, and, yes, he could still smell Steve, he desperately wanted him, but he couldn't.  Tony loved fucking his assistants but he didn't want to do it like this.  He didn't want to feel like he couldn't control himself.  Tony had never slept with an omega in heat and never planned to.  Frankly it was kind of disgusting, how it turned perfectly reasonable people into hysterical messes.
"I know I need to stop going off and doing shit on my own. I'm sorry. It's just hard--" Steve let out a withered sigh. He walked over to the bag. "I just-- I got you-- well, sort of for you-- listen, I don't know why I freaked out yesterday. But I want to go that stupid conference. Everyone knows we went collar shopping. We've got to set an example now." Steve moved over to the bag. He pulled out a thin black box. "Cost me five dollars each. Boxes are tacky as hell. And... I got you flowers too. Figured a girlfriend probably never got you flowers before."
Steve and Tony sat respectfully through the usual prayers and quiet memories.  It wasn't until the priest invited Boswell's mate to say some words that things got interesting.
This fucking forced monogamy.  I haven't touched a woman since May!  What the hell, Steve? You're allowed to double-bond, and I can't even fool around?  I get that you have an image to protect and I've been nothing but supportive of that, but enough's enough!  When do I get to start fooling around again?" He stalked back and forth, body tense, screaming at him for relief.  "None of this is fair, I didn't ask to be dragged into SHIELD, I didn't ask to meet you, all I wanted to do was to just be Iron Man and I didn't even ask for that, either, I just wanted to drink and party and fuck beautiful women and I got dragged into all this covert government and omega civil rights stuff, and frankly I think I've been handling it really well, but I'm not going to let you cuckold me, Buckold me, whatever.  If I can't have a mistress then you can't have another Alpha. It's not fucking fair."
Jesus Christ.  Tony realized as he was saying it that Steve was having another burst of pheromones.  Heats ebbed and flowed; at times, Steve was (almost) rational, and others, he was doubled over with cramps, begging to be fucked.
JARVIS didn't respond and Pepper realized Tony's override was still in effect.  JARVIS would only take orders from him until it was lifted.
"Loved you on SNL," he told Steve, who blushed a little, because, God, he'd put a lot of work into it. He had no idea being funny was so... well, hard.
"No, he's not-- damn it, Happy, these stupid tabloids are just guessing!"  Tony threw down the magazine and stomped off to his shop. So far, Happy's tabloid had successfully guessed Steve, Taylor Swift, Carson Daly, Rihanna, Union Jack, and Mockingbird... but he felt like he needed to prove to Happy that they were only guessing.
Steve brought his head back up and looked at Tony with those piercing baby blues. He opened his mouth to speak, then swallowed and let out the breath he’d been holding. “I don’t really know I guess.”
“That… Was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before.” He panted in a breathy whisper as Tony kissed down his cheek and under his jaw to the soft skin of his throat.
“Yeah, probably. So who’s this friend, should I be jealous.” Tony smirked and raised one eyebrow devilishly.
“You’d be wrong about that, that’s where you and I differ you see Boy Scout.” Tony replied sarcastically with a mock salute.
Tony got his knees under him and stroked down the inside of Steve’s thigh, then slid the two fingers still gratuitously coated in lube under Steve’s balls and up to his as expected tight little hole. Steve watched his hand disappear underneath him with unbidden lust and Tony’s free hand grabbed his chin, bringing his eyes back up to Tony before he closed his own and kissed Steve deeply, he slipped one finger inside Steve and the other man cried out, the sound so pure and perfect against his lips. He kept his lips on Steve’s panting mouth as he worked the finger into Steve slowly, up and down, up and down. He felt Steve’s cheeks clench around his finger and he shh’d at Steve, who breathed in and relaxed himself, scrunching his eyes up and pressing his forehead to Tony. Before Steve had time to regain composure Tony slid the second finger in and Steve moaned so sultrily that Tony’s cock twitched in response. Steve’s hands, now on the cushions, dug in to them and Tony was sure he heard a slight ripping sound. He dismissed it and grabbed the bottle of lube from beside Steve; it had rolled down into the dip of Tony’s knees on the sofa.
Tony never got to finish his sentence, he was slammed full force into the wall. Surprise caused him to lose his balance and suddenly Steve was the only thing holding him off the ground, Steve was glaring at him, blue eyes hard like chips of flint. But there was something else too, Tony held his gaze trying to figure it out.
secure building in Manhattan, shoot maybe America I’m sure I could hack the Pentagon if I wanted to. I asked you to meet me here because if something happened you could get out alive.”
He quickly reached down and pumped Steve’s shaft a couple of times, enjoying watching Steve squirm under his ministrations, then let go and spanked Steve once more for good measure. Steve’s cock was positively dripping now, but Tony knew he had a lot more left in him. He straightened up and leaned forwards, dragging his teeth down Steve’s rock hard ass, something he’d been dying to do ever since he’d got a good look at it.
“Better make it worth my while then pretty boy.” Tony dragged his fingernails once more down Steve’s ribs and he was pleased to see red welts slowly rising from Steve’s tanned skin.
“Yeah, I know.” Tony shrugged and brought his other hand down to Steve’s chest. “I’m much less complicated. If I think you’re hot, I’ll fuck you, I could not give a rat’s ass about man, woman, super soldier, whatever the fuck people like Thor are yadda yadda. I like pretty things and you are a very pretty thing Steve. I’ve thought that from the beginning but you’re also aggravating as hell, pompous, self righteous and a total douche bag at times, that can be quite the turn off. But it wasn’t until the accords that I realised just how much I need you Steve. And I do, need you. Even if right now I want to beat the snot out of you, I need you and I want you.” He ran his hands up Steve’s chest and trailed his fingers around the other man’s nipples. “You are one hot piece of ass Rogers. Even if you are an asshole.”
He took Tony’s skin between his teeth and worked it in his mouth until blood bloomed underneath the skin leaving a large purple bruise. He brushed his lips down a bit more and started again, Tony pushed his fingers into Steve’s hair and threw is head back, allowing himself to catch his breath as Steve’s mouth worked itself down his now hyper sensitive body. Steve reached Tony’s nipple and took it in his mouth, dancing his tongue across it, flicking it and sucking on it. Tony closed his eyes and tightened his grip on Steve’s hair. Steve finally let go and looked up at Tony, the glow from Tony’s arc reactor causing Steve’s eyes to sparkle.
“Why do you always have to make this so personal Tony! You did the same thing for the accords! You had to make it about you, about the kid that died because of you, not about us or about anything else but you. Newsflash not everything is about you!”
“You’re right; I think the longest I’ve gone without sex is like three days.” He laughed and then moaned as he felt Steve start to push back onto his fingers.
Tony grabbed him and in a singular motion turned him and shoved him backwards until his knees hit the edge of the bed and Steve went flying onto it. Tony knew if Steve wanted to he could turn to an immovable rock under Tony’s hands, but he still enjoyed shoving the Captain around. Tony advanced on Steve and Steve backed up on the bed, giving Tony space to crawl up him and drop onto him. He leaned one elbow by Steve’s head and took his lips for his own, conquering Steve’s still salty mouth, his tongue crashing against Steve’s and struggling for dominance over it. He reached down, his hand finding Steve’s gorgeous cock and grasping it firmly. Steve gasped into his mouth and Tony grabbed his bottom lip between his teeth, pulling at it, letting Steve moan, feeling his hot breath on his face as he stroked his hand up Steve’s lengthy, thick shaft. He could feel the heavy veins that crisscrossed it and he couldn’t believe how fantastic it felt in his hand. He dropped himself to the side of Steve slightly and with every pump of his hand he thrust into Steve’s side, rubbing his still flaccid cock up Steve’s hip, feeling the smooth, hard muscle as Steve’s body reacted to Tony’s ministrations.
“You’re actually vile.” But Steve was laughing too in spite of himself, well, trying to laugh in between his now very rancorous moaning. “Do it, again and I’ll, bite the fucking things… off.” Steve panted.
“You heard it ladies and gents.” He let go of Steve’s throbbing cock and sat up, he grabbed Steve’s shoulders pulled his entire length out of Steve, ignoring the futile protests from the older man. He threw Steve into the couch and drew himself up to tower over Steve.
Tony glared at him but Steve was smiling under his hands. He groaned dramatically and dropped them to his side.
“Even though you’ll disappear on me, and somehow have to explain to your new friends that you were shacked up with me for however long this lasts and I would love to be a fly on the wall for that, I don’t regret this Steve.”
Now Tony’s hands were roaming up and down that ridiculous suit, thank god he didn’t have his mask on; Tony would have destroyed it then and there, who wore that suit like that, why? Just, casual clothing, how long had it been? Did he really have to dress like that now? He did it on purpose Tony was sure.
Steve dropped his head back to Tony’s chin, his sweaty hair brushing Tony’s cheek. Tony closed his eyes and circled his hips, slowly, teasingly, spinning the heavier man around on himself and causing Steve to grit his teeth and grab at the sofa. He took his other hand off of Tony’s shoulder and traced down around Tony’s chest, around the arc reactor where the skin was ridiculously more sensitive than the rest of his chest, which was so weird as the scar tissue should have practically deadened the area to touch. He reached Tony’s nipple and twirled a finger around it, stroking it, kneading his pectoral muscle with his hand and then brushing his fingers down Tony’s ribs. Tony switching the direction of his grinding hips and Steve gasped once more.
“Oh I am far from gramps, what about you, I’m surprised you didn’t lose your voice with the amount of screaming you did. I thought you were trying to keep a low profile?”
“Well if you actually stayed around long enough you’d experience them a lot more.” Tony replied between nibbling the skin of Steve’s neck.
He put them both onto Steve’s boxers and then thought better, and instead leaned down; catching the material between his teeth causing Steve to moan loud enough for Tony to be glad the place was empty. He worked them down, his fingers tugging at the edges of the legs as his top lip and nose brushed the head of Steve’s shaft, he could smell the salt of Steve’s cum already and it excited him greatly. Steve’s hand let go of Tony and Tony pulled himself down Steve’s legs until finally that glorious creature was released.
Tony felt himself begin to climax and his thrusts became erratic, Steve held onto Tony’s cock, pushing back into his thrusts and then Tony was crying out Steve’s name in between expletives. He felt himself explode into Steve and as he pulled back and continued to thrust he looked down to see cum already leaking out and down to his balls from the edges of the condom, that was one hell of a load he’d just shot into Steve’s perfect ass.
“Cut the bullshit Cap, this was never just a fuck. It was a lot more than that. It wasn’t anything romantic or destined, it was just, well, right I guess. It felt right, felt like it was meant to happen from the very beginning. Why do you think I hated you so fucking much? Here comes this perfect, godlike Adonis who my father was so in love with it’s a wonder my mother never straight up divorced him over it, I’m all ready to hate you, I’ve seen your photos and files I know you’re a pretty boy but that was nothing to seeing you in person. I hated you because I couldn’t hate you, you were just gorgeous and perfect and sculpted by fucking Michael Angelo himself and it wasn’t fair because I wanted so badly to hold onto all that childhood hatred, and then I got to know you and that was even worse because not only were you a bona fide 1940s war hero you were also pretty fucking nice and great to work with and talk to. You and me, we’re what created the Avengers, I don’t care who Fury contacted first or who Fury thought would be best, seeing as I was actually rejected for the project on the grounds of my perfect ego,” Steve chuckled at the smarmy look on Tony’s face, “it was always you and me buddy, for better or for worse till death do us part and all that shit.”
Like that time in Manhattan with the bomb and the Chitauri. That was right, and it hadn’t made him feel good in the slightest, it wasn’t like in the books or movies or what people tell you, that sense of overwhelming goodness making you know you were doing right. It was pain, and anger, and fear… So much fear. Was that how Steve felt every time he had his little justice vomit all over people. Justice vomit, he liked that. He laughed quickly, nervously and put the phone down, then picked it back up again.
“This ain’t my first rodeo.” Tony took in the sight under him, holding himself up on his hands so he could look directly into Steve’s eyes, but that was boring. There was too much in them.
“Really Stark?” Steve tried to sound confident but it didn’t work. He looked down at himself and crossed his arms, he was in his suit with a jacket over the top, he shrugged the jacket off and hung it on a peg on the wall and moved closer.
“It wasn’t him!” Steve moved closer and Tony stood stock still, he wasn’t sure he could move and not punch Steve. “He was brainwashed, why won’t you get that? You’re willing to look past all of us and what we did and we’re willing to look past what you did because we can all see the person behind it but Bucky? Bucky was forced to murder people like a puppet with no free will of his own and you can’t look past that. You had a choice, Widow had a choice, Bucky doesn’t.” Steve was breathing hard now, his chest rising and falling and his fists clenched. “We’ve all had a wake up call in our lives, Bucky had his and put himself under, that was his choice, like your choice to stop building weapons.
