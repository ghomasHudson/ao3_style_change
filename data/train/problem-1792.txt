Sherlock is refulgent and pale, surrounded by women dressed in bedazzled eveningwear. In his veins courses the fire of his city, his circulatory system a percussive map of London’s streets. Seventy-two beats per minute.
) File-thirteens the budding, sexual identity crisis when Sherlock endeavors to leave him to his thoughts. John holds him fast. “We aren’t done! What do I need to say, Sherlock? What do I need to do to get it through that thick skull of yours? If you leave me behind ag—“
. Love, marriage, waist deep in the cellar of an old rectory in naught but their pants. A quest, Sherlock had thought, sounded relatively harmless. Like a scavenger hunt. Only he’s getting paid. John might enjoy a risk-free case this once. (On their honeymoon.) A day spent deciphering poetry, libraries and book passages and trees for God's sake. John is ‘starting to feel like Nicholas Cage’, whatever that’s supposed to mean.
Sherlock nestles his face between John’s shoulder blades. Wraps them in the bedspread. Safe, warm, and not the least bit itchy.
John, however. Sherlock believes the man has a soul. He can feel it. Like the vastness of the snowfall outside 221B. Immeasurable. John is so much bigger, so much greater than the melanin of his hair, the marrow of his bones. His eyes are the ocean, his skin is the desert. Sherlock could fall into him and never find his way out. Sometimes, he thinks he already has.
John shakes the handle of his 10-in-1 at him. “I went to college. I’ve assembled my fair share of cheap-arse furniture, thank you very much.” He also dated a number of women who purchased entertainment centers in the infancy of their romantic liaisons. Forcing slot A into remotely-resembles-a-conical-outlet B is almost a prerequisite for any relationship. Even this one. Though, Sherlock is capable of building a bloody table. He’s smart. Efficient when he wants to be. Good with his hands. (John is
at John. Saying a million things and saying nothing at all. Marriage has not been a topic of discussion since the night Sherlock instinctively proposed. Since the day John said yes to more than pizza. They’ve lived together, worked together in (mostly) harmony for years. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.
“Let’s get started, shall we?” Sherlock says as he sheds his coat. A black, diaphanous shirt hangs loose on his shoulders, clings tight to his abdomen. A pair of studded, leather trousers like a second skin. They complement the curve of his plump arse and emphasize the length of his outrageously long legs. Powerful thighs. Muscular calves and...John’s not entirely sure how Sherlock got himself in them, but he’s not complaining. On the contrary. A bit distracted by the idea of him removing them, honestly. Peeling them off, and he’d have to go slow. May even need a little help.
John laughs. Rolls Sherlock over on his back. Dusky bedclothes like a tent over his head. Sherlock has long since lost track of the edge of the bed, but he doesn’t mind. It’s huge. Large enough for two, grown men to wrestle as much as they please, thank you.
John supersedes his predecessors, too. Sherlock has known a few companions in his lifetime, some of which more invigorating than others. (In every sense of the word.) Stimulants, appetite suppressants, anesthetics. Anything and everything to tame the pandemonium inside his head. To gag the ghosts of his past, peeling their vitriolic accusations from the synarthrodial joints of his neurocranium. John, though. John looks at Sherlock and his consummate loyalty needles his veins. Hot. Potent. Incredibly addicting. Washing away his insecurities, his reservations.
Sherlock shakes him off. Pulls John down against him. Kisses his lips. Where his words originate. Every tooth, the palate of his mouth, his tongue. John whispers Sherlock’s name. It tastes like honey.
Sherlock rakes his fingers through his hair, tangle in his soppy curls. John’s words bandage the evidence of insults past. Enfold him, a second skin, and it’s John’s assertions how he’s fantastic, brilliant, and marvelous that support Sherlock as he shrugs off the
Not lost-lost, John hopes. But definitely itinerant. It’s half one in the morning and Sherlock is staring at himself in the mirror over the fireplace. E-mails printed and taped to the mantelpiece. His eyes dart from one to another intermittently, hands pressed against his mouth. Otherwise, he doesn’t move. He hasn’t moved in so long John begins to worry. Sherlock needs to move, if nothing else. Not because standing in one place is bad for him, necessarily, but because it is.
“You’re overdoing it.” John shrugs his aching shoulders. (He is, of course, carrying everything they’ve purchased thus far.) “Who am I kidding, you always overdo it.”
Sherlock scoffs. “Nice. Nice is a word used to describe one of your dull acquaintances or your great aunt Silvia’s handmade doilies.” He taps a beat on the doorknob, his patience wearing thin. “John, you didn’t have to accompany me if that’s what you’re getting at.”
“Fine, then. You’re my new cover. I’m actually here to catch a murderer. Just sit there and look happy, for God’s sake.”
Sherlock evaluates John’s cheeky grin. The smudges of blood on his shoulder where he cradled Sherlock’s head while the German’s wife rebuked their interference and he kisses him. Because no one surprises Sherlock Holmes like John Watson. The inside of John’s mouth is velvety and warm. Breathe. Slow. Quick, quick. Slow. More breathing, less kissing. Just John’s lips on his lips and
. Under Sherlock’s arse, out of his trousers, and John’s arm is effectively pinned. The mouse scurries back under the couch.
John turns, sleepily pulls Sherlock into a kiss. Or what he thinks is a kiss. He’s virtually asleep, but Sherlock lets him. He always lets him. Relishes the taste of John’s breath, in and out. Alive.
John purses his lips. On the verge of asking what in the world Sherlock is talking about when Sherlock prods his forehead with a lackadaisical pointer finger.
tacit and oh-so worth it. John sucks his tea between his teeth, the slurping finally driving Mycroft back downstairs.
why, but the compromise of John Watson’s safety—the usual ‘could be dangerous’ notwithstanding—is linked directly to Sherlock’s ability to function under stress. Worse than H.O.U.N.D., his body shaking uncontrollably. His mind replaying the unfortunate events leading to John’s incapacitation, over and over. Lead pipe, generic ne’er-do-well number two, and somebody played cricket as a child. Once to the face, twice to the shoulder. Bam, bam, bam.
Sherlock wraps his coat tightly around his midsection and props his knees against the vacant seat in front of him.
“I’ll ask again,” John says evenly. Sets his fork down. Breathes through his nose. “What. Did. You. Do?” Finally notices. Fully distracted. “Are you wearing pants?”
“I’ll get her,” Sherlock offers for absolutely no reason because why would he trouble himself when John is always so delightfully useful? Analogous mundane activities. Analogous is a funny word. It has anal in it. Logous. Pertaining to study. The study of arseholes. Yes. And what’s inside. Ha! Certainly not jam. No. Would have to be pudding. Chocolate pudding. What self-respecting anal would fill itself with vanilla pudding? “I’ll go get her,” Sherlock repeats himself.
Sherlock sways. Rocking from side to side, feet shuffling against the rug. His eyes are still trained on the e-mails. He doesn’t say a word. The flat is dark. Sherlock’s only light source originates from outside. Curtains drawn wide and the city pours into their living room, flashing and pulsing like a living, breathing thing. Sherlock exhales, a silhouette, framed in gold. He closes his eyes; he doesn’t need to see the evidence anymore. Hasn’t had to since the first time he read them. He tilts his head back and he continues to sway.
). His munificent partner in crime receives the notification wherein Sherlock employs XI for the win. And this, John thinks, is their life in a nutshell.
John would like to explain, would like Sherlock to understand. Home is where the heart is. And John’s heart is currently held captive, bound and fettered in Sherlock’s possession, locked so deep inside there’s no hope of recovery. John doesn’t need Baker Street. Doesn’t need London. But. Can’t deny they fit the city. Filling the cracks, slipping unnoticed in the recesses of dark alleyways, abandoned warehouses, the banks of the Thames like a lyric in his ear, memorized backward and forward and John says, “Come here.”
related. He doesn’t even identify as asexual. Not technically. He identifies with no one; labels tend to make him itchy. Especially
Sherlock opens his eyes. Transfixed by John’s crumbling restraint, his failure to rein in his happiness, his anguish, his fear, his fury. A familiar moue Sherlock cited on more than one occasion over the past three years.
. Folding over. John guides him to the floor only to assail him with renewed vigor. Ten fingers teasing and poking and driving Sherlock absolutely mad, tears in his eyes. John had no idea he was ticklish.
. Sherlock squirms. The tipping point. He braces himself, teetering on the brink of feelings and emotions he never let himself succumb to before John.
But no. It’s just John. Or the memory of John. Long years traversing Europe, the Americas, hunting down and destroying the vestiges of Moriarty’s crime syndicate. And it’s always when he’s alone. Lying awake in a flea-ridden motel in the middle of East Jesus Nowhere at the crack of dawn. John thrumming though his body, his mind, his heart.
Bubble bath plus jets is not a good idea. Sudzy walls of white obscure their view of one another. John can hear Sherlock almost-giggling and he almost-giggles in return. The wine is damn damn
John’s soul is old. Not very old, but older than Sherlock would imagine. A century. Worn around the edges like a book yellowed by the sun and its pages smell of ink and leather and adventure.
“Consulting detective. Only one in the world, I invented the job.” Sherlock gnaws on the butt of an unlit cigarette. “Stamford got me the strip gig.”
is appropriate. Transient at first, a brief moment of acknowledgement. Then intensifying, blinding. No holds barred.
John wakes to Sherlock muttering what sounds like numbers at random. He’s lying flat on his back with his hands pressed together against his mouth, staring at the ceiling. Chest rising and falling rhythmically. Light pollution seeps through the curtains of Sherlock’s bedroom window, a blush of oranges and reds and yellows enliven the pale expanse of his torso. He’s unashamedly naked, one leg dangling off the side of his bed and the other lost under the covers.
“Sherlock Holmes!” Mike exclaims. Another clap on the back. “Best stripper in the biz! According to his website!”
Sherlock flexes his theatrical muscles, flinging the offending phalange in John’s lap the moment he sits on the coffee table.
Sherlock is ten. He tugs at the bowtie around his neck. Resents Mycroft for aging another year. Resents the guests invading their home to pay him unnecessary deference for achieving nothing except enduring the passage of time. Polite laughter, a mishmash of conversation orchestral tuning to Sherlock’s ears. Nowhere near as beautiful, but fascinating in its own right.
Sherlock raises his hands in the air coyly. Bucks his hips--hard--like he’s making a point, in spite of the debauched little whine he can’t curtail. “
Next preview: Dark, teen love, angst, kissing in the rain. John almost wonders if it’s the same movie aside from the fact that the actors are different.
Mycroft is unimpressed. Just as he’s unimpressed with most everything. The apathetic core of his character does not show on his face. No, he twists and bends and pinches his features to resemble that of a man who is pleased. Charmed. Delighted. Any and every variant. Mycroft offers the young woman his hand.
Sherlock retains valuable information from each case he solves. Bits and pieces here and there, whatever strikes him as largely pertinent. For John? Sherlock’s dedicated more space on his hard drive than is necessary for one person. And he periodically makes room for more.
Lestrade saves choking to death for another day. He briefs them in fifty words or less (still wheezing) and puts his knees to the breeze. Making excuses, leaves them alone in his office. Exactly as Sherlock planned. He pops up from his seat like a macabre jack-in-the-box and commences picking the lock on Lestrade’s filing cabinet.
Rather than say anything, he holds the picture in question for Sherlock to observe. An everyman wearing the same shirt, John believes, as the too-pretty-to-be-real male model loafing the entirety of a two-page spread.
Sherlock and John take a detour through the park. Because John has an insatiable desire to eat morning, noon, and night and Sherlock knows that if John isn’t fed in a timely manner, he’ll lapse into a stropy silence, wistful little noises in the back of this throat when they pass an establishment that may or may not resemble a restaurant. (
John holds him tight. Traces his thumbs against his hip bones. Feels Sherlock undulate beneath his reverent touch. And watching Sherlock fuck the air between them at the mere look on John’s face--while undeniably Sherlock in all its vanity--is stupidly sexy.
Banifacious monopolizes the Ferris Wheel. Very obvious and very dull, but what in the hell else is Sherlock supposed to do? Molly banned him from the mortuary at Bart’s due to his attempted theft of a dermoid ovarian cyst in the middle of (what she believed to be) a routine autopsy.
“Right.” John clears his throat. Raps his knuckles on the paneled window separating Mycroft and himself from the nameless/faceless chauffer. He climbs out of the car when it rolls to a stop, but before he slams the door in Mycroft’s face, he impresses upon him, “I love your brother. And I don’t give a damn if you approve or not because this…” He’s growling now. “…
John thinks, sneaking into Sherlock’s bedroom while Sherlock harangues Lestrade for cold case files at the Yard.
) It’s fine; braving Sherlock’s flights of fancy in the face of death and murder and gore of indeterminate sums, but flagging down a cab double-handcuffed to another human being is next to impossible, as it happens.
ness with a fiery passion that John will never discover because his face is blank and unreadable, thank you.
Pursue suggesting to follow. To catch. Sherlock touches John’s hand. Sliding his fingers around his wrist. Surreptitiously taking his pulse. Elevated.
Sherlock prods at the pizza on the kitchen table. Or what’s supposed to be a pizza. John’s not a betting man, but he wages their lunch is now considered a weapon of mass destruction.
Sherlock breathes out. Half drags, half carries John away from the fiery remains of Mr. Wilson’s pawnshop. Practically throws him to the ground on the opposite side of the road.
John unlocks the door to Reggie’s guesthouse. Frenzied movements, an aura of lust and love and they stumble through the threshold, narrowly avoiding their luggage, burning up, up, and up. The backs of Sherlock’s knees hit the chaise lounge. He pulls John down on top of him. The closest available surface with which to ravage each other that’s not the floor, because they’re not as young as they used to be.
While John searches his mind for applicable synonyms, Sherlock advances. Grabs John by his waist. Angles him against the shower wall. And then maneuvers beneath the water, sighing audibly. Twists the knob, boiling hot. "Mmm," he approves. Then, "My back, John."
Sherlock spends exactly ten minutes more than usual preening in his bedroom. Not a second more even though his hair refuses to cooperate, damn it. At twelve on the dot, he meets John on the landing. He’s irrationally pissy, surges of adrenaline causing his insides to squirm, his heart to palpitate, his palms to sweat. John is dressed to the nines. (
I apologize, yet again, for failing to update as planned. I will do my best to post chapters daily throughout Thanksgiving and Christmas. Thank you for your patience! Have some semi-angst!
Sherlock leans into John, pelvis first. Leaves his shoulder open for escape and how could John not love him with every fiber of his being?
Sherlock’s mind is whirring, his eyes darting from the livers to the ventilation to every nook and cranny, long legs carrying him from one end of the freezer to the other. Irritated. John imagines he’s quite warm, working himself up like that.
John squints. “Seriously?” Nudges Sherlock once he realizes Sherlock is having him on. “What do you really see?”
“Mhm.” From thumb to pointer, from pointer to middle. Circle, circle, stop. Sherlock’s ring finger touching the center, recognizable impression and apparent interest beginning to turn John on in more ways than one. “I’m brilliant, but not that brilliant.”
"So it would seem." Sherlock grabs his coat, switching his phone from one hand to the other so he can slide his arms into the sleeves. "You ran into him on your way to see Lestrade."
Sherlock fixes the cuff of his shirt. He will admit. Stumbling upon John’s unusually ticklish ears while hiding in the closet of an assassin returning home sooner than anticipated was unsavory at the time. But now Sherlock finds the revelation—he decides on the word
Dragging Sherlock to the theatre is like pulling teeth. Funny, that. Considering John covered for Sherlock while he nicked molars from a number of dead bodies at Bart’s while Molly was on coffee break. (Not her coffee break, technically. Sherlock’s coffee break, per his request. But that’s neither here nor there.) John made him a deal; if he must be party to Sherlock’s burglary, Sherlock has to accompany him to see
On the fifteenth of March, Sherlock grills steak. (Rather, he asks Angelo to grill him steak and Angelo grills him steak.) He waits for John in nothing but his robe.
Long years traversing Europe, the Americas. Hunting down and destroying the vestiges of Moriarty’s crime syndicate. And it’s always when he’s alone. Lying awake in a flea-ridden motel in the middle of East Jesus Nowhere at the crack of dawn. John thrumming though his body, his mind.
) John thinks Sherlock is full of shit, but he can’t prove Sherlock is or isn’t lying based on terrestrial albedo or the number of times Sherlock pops his damn collar within a span of twenty-four hours, can he?
John pins Sherlock against the bathroom door. “Jesus, forget the gloves. This would be next to impossible if—“
However. John appears warm and inviting, despite the way he's picking at his crotch. They really should have rinsed off first. Or toweled off. Or just stayed naked. Naked is good.
John takes Sherlock to Angelo’s. Not exactly creative. Sherlock keeps his mouth firmly shut, teeth aching. Sits in his usual spot. Tries to suss John out. Not his style. John prefers lavishing his dates with expensive, three course meals he can’t afford. Piano music, candlelight, and the susurrus of intimate conversation somewhere in the dark.
John smiles tightly. Blinks at the ceiling. “See, this is what I don’t understand. Maybe you can explain it to me.” He turns. Faces Sherlock, a vision of thunder. “You’re dying first. You’ve established your right to kick the bucket before I do. Fine. But where do you
“Is this the part where I invite you upstairs for coffee we have no intention of drinking?” Sherlock invades John’s personal space and John closes his eyes, titillating Sherlock with his blind trust. Breath mingling in the night. Streetlights and headlights like mandorlas in the accumulating fog, twinkling in Sherlock’s periphery.
Sherlock is in awe of John’s paradoxical bearing. So he does as he’s told. Only has one more comment. “God! How many sodding endings does this film have, John?”
is appropriate. Transient at first, a brief moment of acknowledgement. Then intensifying, blinding. No holds barred.
The room is neat. Orderly. Boring. Mistaken for Sherlock’s proclivity for sleepless nights. But then John realizes that there is nothing about Sherlock’s old bedroom that signifies he spent any amount of time experimenting on the neighbor’s cat—a tale with which Mummy regaled John over the course of the evening. The room is wanting, for lack of a better word. Baker Street has Sherlock’s fingerprints all over it. From the bullet holes in the wall to the creepy, blood-spatter shower curtains.
“Sherlock,” John tries his hand at an imitation of Greg, albeit a sleepy Greg. “Fancy divulging this week’s lottery numbers? Thanks, mate.”
“Twilight?” John hisses between his teeth. And it’s more than a little sad he’s familiar with the genre. “No. We’re here to see
John rolls over on his back. He clutches his stomach, laughter bubbling between his lips. “You tit!”
A hypnic jerk. A gasp. Opaque visions of tea lights and boiled shrimp dispersing as he wakes from a hellish nightmare. Sherlock stares at the ceiling from his supine position on the couch. The familiar
John is researching internet jargon. Trying to decipher some of the comments on his blog. What in the bloody hell are feels and why are some of Sherlock’s fans so intent on screaming casually? On the fence whether today’s youth are incredibly passionate or incredibly stupid.
“That’s bull in a china cabinet, I think.” Bottles of pills cascade from the kitchen counter to the kitchen floor, clattering like bloody maracas or rattlesnakes or—Sherlock trips. Catches himself on the arm of his chair. He needs to sit down. “Th’ hell they slip in our drinks?” John wonders aloud. Too loudly. Fumbles with two glasses of water he drops in the sink because he can’t see straight.
John closes the shower curtain on him. “You look nothing like those blokes,” he grumbles. Lathers soap across his chest.
Mrs. Hudson sets a plate of mozzarella sticks and marinara sauce in front of John, on top of the stack of e-mails. She offers him a wink and excuses herself with a quiet, “G’night.”
Sherlock feigns hurt feelings. Doesn’t take much. What he gets for jumping to conclusions. “You forgot. After all the trouble of—“
Sherlock pants across John’s cheek, the tip of his nose, his philtrum. Draws his upper lip between his teeth. Smiles when he feels John smile. Paints his gums with the tip of his tongue, a cartographic study of the bumps and the divots. It’s a bit messy. And slobbery. But John’s beginning to tremble and nothing, Sherlock thinks, will compel him to stop now that John’s lisping breathlessly, “Stherluck” and “Stherluck” and “
Sherlock is livid. “Out,” he says. To his credit, he addresses Mrs. Hudson calmly and with deference. “Please.”
. A pathetic argument. While it’s true they do not in fact date, their romantic relationship is subject to change. Just like everything else on the face of the Earth. Logic eases Sherlock’s mind, but not his respiratory system. So he nods.
He keeps them to remind himself that love—or what workaday people call love—is, at its core, deception. Flattery, sweet nothings.
“Shh.” John cradles Sherlock’s head. Squeezes him tighter when he trembles violently against John’s body.
Sherlock scoffs. Has he considered the repercussions? Ha! He’s considered and reconsidered to the point of razing his mind palace to the ground, insecurity imbued with hesitation and inexperience.
and Sherlock still hasn’t managed to re-zip his fly. “I’m crying! Sherlock!” Forehead to forehead, snorting the remnants of their giggle fits, wiping at each other’s faces. John kisses Sherlock soundly on the mouth. And on the teeth, because Sherlock can’t stop smiling. Neither can John.
John sighs. He’s tired. He’s sore. He wants to go home and forget tonight ever happened, but Sherlock will make sure he never forgets. “I was mugged. I’m sorry. But I swear I’m fine. No one’s dying first or second or—“ John licks his lips. His voice cracks a bit when he says, “I really,
It was worth a wound; it was worth many wounds; to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.
“I had an accident.” His jumper and his trousers are damp with what Sherlock hopes isn’t piss. “Oh, God. We’re so wasted. I haven’t been wasted since—“ John grimaces. Doesn’t finish his sentence. “Shou’ probably get Missus Hudson to keep ‘n eye on us tonight.” Sets the cup he salvaged from the sink on the coffee table.
. John holds Sherlock tight when he stands, kneading his meaty thighs. The drag of leather against John’s jumper, rucking it up bit by bit, John’s stomach rubbing against the supple, second skin of Sherlock’s trousers. And John is panting, tounging Sherlock’s belly button, his–
John approaches Sherlock from behind, somber and more than a little concerned. Sherlock submits to his brain on a regular basis. It probably shouldn’t bother him. Only it does. John wonders, some days, if Sherlock will visit his mind palace and never come back. He touches Sherlock’s arm, but doesn’t expect Sherlock to acknowledge him. Honestly surprises John when Sherlock turns, seeking him out like a flower bending toward sunlight. John rests his hand on Sherlock’s waist. Sways with him, hums a little under his breath.
smile. Sherlock has successfully nailed and butchered obscure and famous quotes alike. He finds this incredibly charming. “Second star,” John murmurs.
John slides his hand under his pillow. Grabs his gun, Sherlock knows. What he doesn’t know is John’s superficial contemplation of murder most foul.
Superfluous information gets stuck in Sherlock’s head. Stuck as in, literally, stuck. Sherlock cannot delete, reshuffle the deck of data piling high and creating an immense amount of pressure between his eyes.
John scours the usual places. And the unusual. Sherlock’s homeless network are real tight-lipped bastards when there’s nothing in it for them—John has a ten pound note on his person, which pales in comparison to Sherlock’s standard fifty quid—and Mycroft proves to be as insufferably vague as ever.
Sherlock stumbles into the living room, coat askew. “Shh!” he drunk-whispers to John, who drunk-shuts the door behind them, rattling the skull on the mantle.
“You made it painfully clear I was to never fake my death, under any circumstances, ever again.” Sherlock doesn’t fight his smile so much as suspend it. He’ll smile at John later. When he doesn’t feel so sticky. John will smile back because he’s John and he can’t help himself. “I learn from my mistakes.”
Sherlock’s mobile lands on top of John’s coat because Sherlock is kissing him again. Rattling the door on its hinges.
) who cradles her chin atop interwoven fingers. Imperturbably. Like she’s one up on him. Sherlock doesn’t have time to waste, to rejoinder with passive-aggressive body language. Undertones contending that John Watson his HIS. Belongs to HIM. And she—with her little, black dress and fuck-me slingbacks—will have no stake in John’s future if Sherlock has any say in the matter. “A rather bold assumption. We’ve only just met.”
. Customarily stern, sometimes stubborn. Ready and willing to bend the laws, break the rules. A nudge in the right direction. Follow Sherlock’s lead no matter the risk or the reward. He’s quintessential. So fucking quintessential, the thought of living without John is unbearable.
The girl—Amanda Vineyard is her name—is sitting on her knees. Steadily demolishing a bouquet of flowers. Buttercups, in particular. The complementary card reads:
To John’s credit, he neither chastises Sherlock nor removes himself from his lap. Merely says, “Lock the door on your way out.”
begin to play. Sherlock starts off with small, enticing movements, warming them up. Rocking his hips forward in a smooth, sinuous wave. Little gyrations that elicit pornographic
John brings home a pair of red stockings. Covered in glitter and paper stars and Sherlock’s name is spelled SHRLOCK and an E is magicmarkered at an angle between the H and the R. Sherlock has never seen anything so blatantly Christmas-y in his entire life. He stops playing his violin. Watches John hang them from the mantle, over the fire. Snowflakes and depth-deficient presents drawn in squiggly strands of glue.
have an announcement. To make.” Picks up his wine glass. “First, I’d like to thank Angelo. A fine man. A damn, fine man.”
Sherlock clutches John’s shirt in his hands. “Oh?” Strives for nonchalance. Misses by a mile. Breathless. Beguiled.
Sherlock paces back and forth, back and forth. Pushes Dr. Rei away and away and away again. Not manhandling. Never manhandling. Funneling. Sherlock’s manic energy an unconscious perimeter, circling John and edging the doctor’s intrusive presence from the room entirely. Sherlock’s eyes dart left and right and front and center, cataloguing and dismantling and deleting at mind-rending speed. John’s head throbs painfully just watching Sherlock’s eyes tremble in their sockets.
Sherlock and John walk through the park on their way home. Because John has an insatiable desire to eat morning, noon, and night and Sherlock knows that if John isn’t fed in a timely manner, he’ll lapse into a stropy silence. Wistful little noises in the back of this throat when they pass an establishment that barely resembles a restaurant. If his hunger reaches critical levels, John will moan like a cat in heat until Sherlock relents and carries his starving arse to the nearest vending machine.
They sneak out through John’s bedroom window. Down the fire escape, creeping through the alleyways. Sherlock’s pace is strident and eager. John relishes that warm and fuzzy feeling he gets when he’s doing something wrong for the right reasons. The clip-lap of Sherlock’s shoes on the pavement keeps time with his heart.
Those long, dexterous fingers trail down the buttons of his shirt, making them stretch and click. He gropes himself through his trousers . Fully captivating Deeze with the outline of his cock and distracting everyone else with his hips and arse. He tosses his head back with a moan and his curls bounce. The flex of his abs under that silky shirt.
Sherlock’s brow is pinched, as close to dumbstruck as is possible in his case. Cheeks flushed prettily. It wrenches John’s heart, his wonder. His disbelief. He wants to flatter Sherlock over and over until praise no longer renders him speechless. Renders him indolent, boneless, gasping under his hands, his tongue. Unmoored.
John scrolls through a collection of classical music. Typical. Obvious. There has to be something more! Something incriminating! Like Country or Rap or that Berber kid. John giggles to himself at the thought. He skims Sherlock’s assortment of Chopin and Beethoven.
Okay. This is…long and weird. I don’t even know. I apologize in advance for the strangeness. I also apologize if I've completely misrepresented the uses of butorphanol.
They lounge, John listening to Sherlock’s unencumbered brilliance and Sherlock listening to John breathe. They stare at the ceiling, chests rising and falling in perfect harmony, and John imagines they’re star-gazing.
Well. Not lost, John hopes. But definitely itinerant. It’s half one in the morning and Sherlock is staring at himself in the mirror over the fireplace. E-mails printed and taped to the mantelpiece. His eyes dart from one to another intermittently, hands pressed against his mouth. Otherwise, he doesn’t move. He hasn’t moved in so long, John begins to worry. Sherlock needs to move, if nothing else. Not because standing in one place is bad for him, necessarily, but because it is.
John’s hand wanders toward Sherlock. His fingers splay, almost as if he’s trying to reach him. Protect him. From bad dreams, from particularly painful memories that tend to raid his mind while his body is forced to recuperate.
He lifts a flute of wine to his mouth. Takes a sip. A grimace John adores in spite of himself. Sherlock watches the couples mingle with desultory curiosity. Reading every gesture, tick, wrinkle and word. Quicksilver eyes roaming from person to person. Indolent. Until he sees the one he’s been looking for.
Sherlock bristles. Fury threatens to overrule the schooled expression on his face, dictate his hands, but he’s already tapping the tabletop agitatedly. His dander is rising to critical levels. He has to speak. Unleash, lest hateful words wither and die in his chest and he’ll have to dig them out of his throat later, petrified insults sticking to his esophagus and a seven percent solution will ease his suffering, but he can’t. He can’t do that anymore. Sherlock opens his mouth, the muscles in his shoulders ape the ebb and flow of Violin Concerto #1. A string of deductions, rapid-fire and unforgiving. One after another. Legato. He doesn’t take a breath: “You’ve been engaged to marry twice before. You broke it off. Both times, if I’m not mistaken. The first unlucky bastard you seduced and dumped was a menial laborer, probably construction, and his job embarrassed you, yes, because you deserve better. Isn’t that what your mother always told you? That you deserve better? Shame she didn’t take her own advice. Father a sot, died of liver cancer three—no—four years ago. Irrelevant. You were in love with your second fiancé, but he cheated on you. Men are all the same. And your pride. Wounded because look at you. Nice figure, smart, sexy. All those praises your girlfriends have erroneously bestowed on you over the years. So now you’ve fixed your sights on John. A good man with a good job and relatively handsome by your standards, but he isn’t good enough, is he? He lives with a flatmate—an attractive flatmate, you think—and he’s at my beck and call. I am not the jealous one, Ms. Morstan. You are.”

“We could always switch places,” Sherlock says offhandedly. Like it’s an option. But no. No way in hell. Not only would Sherlock fail to protect his modesty, John would have to simultaneously pretend to paint Sherlock’s pale arse while deducing who in their right mind is plotting to lure Sherlock into a windowless van and
. The pad of his finger heavy against his bottom lip. Down his chin, his chest, muscles rippling in its wake. Directs John’s attention back to his crotch. John doesn’t remember the last time he was so turned on by so very little, and Sherlock Holmes is barely in a state of undress.
“Well, you’re doubly amazing.” John drags his nose through Sherlock’s hair, across his forehead. Plants a kiss on the bridge of his nose. Then down, down, returning to Sherlock’s lips and they welcome him back with languid enthusiasm. “God, your mouth,” John continues to lavish Sherlock with compliments. “Your eyes,” he says, pulling back far enough to look into them. “You’re beautiful.”
He steadies himself on the back of John’s chair. His half-open shirt falling around John’s face and John sees nothing but skin and smells nothing but the sweet tang of sweat and cologne. The minute twitch of Sherlock’s abdominals when he cocks his hips slowly, slowly. Then surging up, up, until John's chin catches on that elusive fourth button. And Sherlock moves impossibly closer, his pelvis pressing against John’s chest.
. John bites the bullet today of all days. While Sherlock gets his way ninety-nine percent of the time, twenty-four/seven and three-sixty-five, he’s earned a compliant bedfellow, John thinks.
Sherlock sighs in relief. “Thank God.” He hops to his feet readily. “Come on, John. We have work to do.” And off he goes.
John sighs. He had no idea Mummy’s birthday bash would be less ‘party’ and more ‘political’ in nature. Not that the woman herself isn’t a pleasure. Beautifully attentive of Sherlock’s needs, her smiles kind and doting. Wiping the corner of his mouth and straightening his bowtie. John does not question her love for Sherlock. He also no longer questions from which parent Mycroft received his preemptive-multitasking personality. Mummy is a schemer. More than one ulterior motive brewing beneath the façade of what had turned out to be a ball of the highest order rather than the ‘small gathering of friends’ she promised Sherlock over the phone a month ago.
“Serial killer. You’re the intended victim, by the way. You can thank me later for slapping your benzodiazepine laced drink out of your hand. Someone make yourself useful for once in your life and call the police. Tell them Sherlock Holmes has their man.” Snidely, “You’re going to prison, Carruthers.”
Sherlock does and doesn’t understand the compulsion to avoid a solitary life. He would say he empathizes, but empathy and he haven’t gotten on since Uni and damn it all to hell if he feels the need to try and rationalize the reasoning behind: “It’s not you, it’s me.”
John has to see this. He opens the shower curtain again to ask the name of his front so he can look up Sherlock’s ‘egregious profile’, but Sherlock already has the page loaded on his mobile, thrust under John’s nose.
John grabs the sleeve of his robe. “I’m sorry, Sherlock,” he titters. Actually titters. Sherlock has never heard a man giggle like John Watson. He’s never been known to find solace in what can arguably be described as annoying, either. But John isn’t annoying. He’s fascinating. Loyal. An enigma. (
Sherlock looks disgusted. “Far be it from me to correct you in your area of expertise, John, but let me assure you. I’m not a necrophiliac.”
John slides inside the black Sedan that’s been tailing him for the last three blocks. He’s prepared to undergo a rigorous Q and A and he wouldn’t be all that surprised if “Anthea” has been commissioned to obtain a sample of his urine, his blood, his hair follicles…
For the longest time, John doesn’t perceive the implications. Why would Sherlock resort to filling his head with nonsense like how John’s left ankle makes a grinding noise when he flexes his toes, how John received a pellet gun for his twelfth birthday, how Harry’s pet hamster died and John buried Pete in the backyard with the neighbor’s grilling utensils? Then it hits him like...something hitting something really hard. (John has
Now he understands. John scratches his head. Hides a smile behind his hand. Looks up at Sherlock bemusedly. “Alright, yes. The floor can be cashmere,” John says into his palm. The fondness Sherlock elicits is unmatched and John wonders, not for the first time, if Sherlock knows how charming he is when he’s not trying to gain someone’s confidence or favor. When it’s just the two of them. “Cashmere works.”
John kisses the corner of his mouth and Sherlock breathes him in. Doesn’t kiss him back, just breathes. Parting his lips. A taste. A little taste. An electrical shock. Ventricular fibrillation. Isn’t used to the cloying need of reassurance. Steals his breath even as John restores it. “I would let you go,” Sherlock admits, chest heaving. Doesn’t realize he’s told the truth until after he speaks the words on John’s tongue. Genuine surprise, a gasp of regret. Or delight. He’s not sure. Why would he do that? Why would he let John go if John wanted to leave?
It’s the first time Sherlock kisses him. His lips are cold and wet on John’s cheek. The smell of bananas and summer sweat.
Doesn’t intend to forget about the ring in his pocket, but war crimes and ferrets will do that to a man in his forties.
I know these chapter notes disrupt the flow of the story, but I want you all to know I'm trying very hard to update daily. Don't give up on me!
, but semantics is beside the point. Sherlock’s threshold for pain is impressive. (Impressively stupid.) Yet there are occasions when he indulges himself in a bit of a man cold. Or, in this case, unwarranted whinging.
A waiter approaches the table to refill Mary’s wine glass. He must feel the tension between them because he neither asks after John, who excused himself to use the facilities, nor inquires whether Sherlock will be joining their party of two.
“Which means that if one intends to predict the outcome of He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, one may cheat.” Pluck. “Monocot, dicot. Multiples of three, multiples of four or five.” Pluck. “As for buttercups: he loves me, he loves me not.” Pluck. “He loves me, he loves me not.” Pluck. “He loves me.” Pluck. “One, two, three, four, five. I rest my case.”
John wiggles his feet inside a pair of trainers, heel-counters to insoles, dismissing the laces altogether. His throat hurts. His body is wracked with chills. Overcomes the urge to hurl as he recalls Sherlock’s declaration:
head. Sherlock calls everything/everyone Billy he doesn’t have the energy to commit to memory, John has discovered. He feels sorry for Angelo’s busboy. He feels sorry for himself, sweating and discomfited and how in the hell is he supposed to reach for his gun? Not that he needs to. Not that he carried a loaded gun inside a classroom full of kids. But the urge to free his arms tingles at the base of his skull. Tickling, tickles. Full-body shiver he morphs into a little jig. “And take you to prison,” he sing-songs for good measure.
It’s a good choice, really. Because when they commit to a relationship, Sherlock loves to leave John keening (Loudly.) in the wake of a well-issued whisper.
John’s head is resting on Sherlock’s chest. He feels ridiculous, but incrementally warmer than before. He’s having a hard time caring about the heteronormative voice having a stroke somewhere in his hindbrain because it’s fine, really. It’s all fine. “Why would I’ve danced with a man?” A beat of silence. “Have y-you danced with a man?”
Sherlock doesn’t have the patience to sit still and watch anything exceeding the length of a YouTube video, let alone a film over two hours long. But, damn it, John’s tried to see a movie by himself and Sherlock always—
He does not expect Mycroft to laugh at him. “Oh, Sherlock. You believe yourself to be in love with him, don’t you?”
“No, it’s—“ The ability to speak a complete sentence seems to have abandoned them both. Sherlock is panting, John is panting, and they cling to one another like they’ll fly to pieces if they let go. Too warm and distinctly uncomfortable and love coils heavy in John’s chest, taut between his ribs. He wants he choke on it. Lose himself in it. Because something—

(Sally agreed to donate Anderson’s not-so-secret Valentine to the cause.) Amanda scatters a handful of petals across the table when Sherlock shuts the door behind him. She does not acknowledge his presence otherwise.
John mimes. Sherlock checks the reflection in the window. Table three, bald German with acute gingivitis. He either has a gun in his pocket or he’s very excited about his lasagna. John isn’t so much mouthing,
Sherlock is none the wiser. Mostly because his experiment has been invalidated. He’s pissy about the spattering of fetus on the kitchen ceiling and a man’s alibi is in jeopardy—
Sherlock highly doubts a lobster has the capacity for introspection. Or the ability to reconcile itself as an individual creature separate from the environment and other individual creatures, for that matter.
“Hi, Sherlock. It’s me. John. Your flatmate. Call me back if you don’t get this message.” John pockets his mobile and goes about his ten-steps-behind business. Takes comfort in the fact that the impracticality of his request is percolating on Sherlock’s answerphone like spoiled milk in direct sunlight.
Sherlock forgets about the receipts and the apparently not-so-subtle play for John’s affections. “Case related,” he lobs.
frown. “So we’ve got…” Prods at the plastic (might as well call them) pustules. Filled with more screws than he can shake a stick at. “Big ones. Small ones. Medium sized ones. Bigger ones. Washers. These…squiggly bits.”
John looks at his wristwatch. “Party’s in an hour. Shouldn’t you be getting dressed?” Smiles evilly. Evilly for John Watson, that is. Sherlock has taught himself to gauge the difference between John’s smiles based on the number and the profundity of his smile lines. He’s catalogued them somewhere and,
as he is pulling a face that speaks volumes and volumes of heroism and Sherlock stamps on his foot when the German reaches for his concealed weapon. (
Sherlock pushes himself over and on top of and looking down at John. He’s smiling that predatory smile John associates with serial killers or that one time Molly text Sherlock about a body in the morgue. Situs inversus. Sherlock’s jealousy, coveting the inversion of internal organs because then their hearts would beat against one another, wouldn’t they? Lying like this?
They stand together, conversing on a level interminable. Their love masquerades as an alleyway, winding strategically around Sherlock’s heart.
John steers Sherlock in the opposite direction. He scans the crowd for signs of their quarry. “This was your idea,” he reminds him. “I’m not even sure this qualifies as a three so you must be pretty damn desperate—“ Sherlock seethes and John swallows the unnecessary commentary. “Right.” Gestures with his chin, where the Miss Congeniality of the fairgrounds glitzes and glams, illustrious against the night sky. “That our culprit?”
“Wait. No, no, it isn’t working.” Sherlock’s arms bent awkwardly from the pull of his coat, and he looks like a fat scarecrow. Sherlock hisses. Unbuttons his coat, pulls his arms out of its sleeves, rebuttons, and pulls the Belstaff over their heads, which looks even sillier. Like a posh burrito wearing sensible shoes, but their heads are trapped inside and their breath is warming their faces so it could be worse.
Christ, he was better than good, he was sex in leather. A lap dance’s wet dream. The strip tease to end all strip teases. And he hadn’t even technically finished taking any of his clothes off. No, good wasn’t good enough. He was great. Better than great. He was mind-blowing.
“Oh.” John shuffles his feet. Pokes at some loose gravel on the pavement with the cane he doesn’t know what to do with. “You’re very, uh, good.” John cringes.
“Ohhh.” Wiggles his eyebrows at Sherlock. “You are a naughty girl.” A blush tinges his cheeks. “Oh. Boy. Sorry, mate.” Winces. “Ah. You know what? I—“ John bites his knuckles when he’s unable to dissuade the caller from continuing. “Horses, really? That’s—“ John mutes the phone against his neck. “Oh my God,” he whispers, “this man’s insane.”
Sherlock joins John in front of the painting. Sketches the mechanics of a murder in the picturesque field before capping the pen with a flourish. “Perfect.”
Slowly, Sherlock’s temper dissipates. He’s tired. Empty. He sits on the couch, rakes his hands through his curls. Tugs at his scalp. Keeps tugging until kind fingers encourage him to relinquish his hair, to lift his head. Once Sherlock meets John’s eyes, John drops a kiss on his brow.
One of the greatest minds of the twenty-first century is practically climbing the walls. He steps on and off the coffee table. Scatters sheets of music. His fingers wind tightly in his hair, pulling and pulling and whimpering at the strain and the stress of all the noise, noise, noise! Never, not once, has John found Sherlock’s masochistic quirks to be remotely funny; episodes cataclysmic to his manner as a functioning human being in his own right.
John Watson is angry. Not angry-angry. Mt. Vesuvius, AD 79, the destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum angry. Sherlock ditched him. Again. Hared off at a moment’s notice without so much as an explanation for his “Oh!”. Hailed a cab, leaving John stranded at the scene of the crime. So what else is new?
To pass the time Sherlock checked all the in- and outgoing numbers, latest text messages (a gratifying amount of them was from him), the email account that had been left logged in and all the tabs left open in the browser. Nothing particularly interesting or new (Harry had rang, he'd not rang back and there was a new number titled 'Lady at Deli', and he'd taken pictures of his breakfast and lunch and many other meals for some reason), except when he got to the news site and read the latest bulletin about a toddler going missing at a hospital. Not newsworthy in itself (to Sherlock), but the cause of his disappearance was suspected to be a man with slight mental retardation who could eat absolutely anything, and was presumed to have eaten the small child. And then walked out of the hospital. A picture had been added and anyone who saw him was requested to contact the police.
“I just wanted to say that was a crap kiss, earlier.” John prodded Sherlock in the arm, looking up at him. “And I'm going to show you how it's done. When you're healed.” The last was added when Sherlock almost smiled, and the words crumpled the smile right out of him.
Lack of John meant he couldn't dive into his mind like he wanted to. He needed to be able to navigate his way back into the city by himself and he was briefly annoyed at John for abandoning him there. Then he recalled the many occasions he'd done the same to John and struggled with that for a moment. But it was a responsibility he felt he was exempt from. In order for him to work he had to be allowed to work the way he wanted to.
“The more important question is why I would want to say either of those things.” Sherlock growled, though it was ever so slightly ineffectual because his tongue really wasn't properly healed yet. He wasn't about to wait for it to happen, though, he wasn't going to be denied. He grabbed the sides of John's face and kissed him again (and noted John didn't resist, so much for being the doctor).
“I've brought you here to make you an offer, Sherlock,” she replied. “If you say yes, I will share everything I know.” Her voice had taken on a strange quality as though the words were repeated a fraction of a second later on another sound channel.
It was unnervingly right, but Sherlock had to (grudgingly) admit that prolonged co-habitation usually led to some degree of intimacy between said co-habiters, in this case himself and John. Not to mention their shared interests in adrenaline-related activities. So naturally John would be able to deduce his motives on occasion, undoubtedly aided by his uncanny ability to
“What's the difference? You wouldn't be able to save them if they weren't wounded so it's all the same in the end.”
“Yes, AND he took the piece of wall-paper Mr Gosbeck gave me,” Sherlock huffed. “And the pieces I scraped from under the fingernails of the first corpse. He said he'd take me to the hospital to be checked over, but I refused. I knew you'd be here, after all, eager to fuss.”
John licked his lips, looking up at him with a slightly nervous frown. “Fine,” he said somewhat hoarsely. “I'm attracted to you.”
When they separated John gave him an altogether new sort of look. An expression unlike Sherlock had ever seen. He had caused it and it was the best thing in the world until John spoke.
The garden was very densely overgrown, its central feature of a fountain also covered in vine and cracked from the foundation up by the roots of the trees (European beech,
“Do you want to know how I do it?” She, like all of her kind, wanted people to know how clever she was. Sherlock had rather expected it, and he fully intended to take advantage of it.
John lifted his head, wearing the question on his face, then blinked. “Oh God, Sherlock. What did you do now?” He got up and walked across the rug (silent, he wore woollen socks when he felt ill) and came to stand in front of Sherlock, looking up at him with a frown. “Your eye's almost swollen shut.”
“First,” John held up a finger. “How did the killer manage to wall-paper the whole place and then get out? Second, if you're on a case, why did you just eat?”
“How do you know?” Sherlock asked. They'd come to a corner. They had two minutes until they had to turn back, according to his timer.
“Might surprise you to find out I've not been attracted to a man before,” John said then, shuffling to sit up a little because he was uncomfortable with the topic change and lying down made him feel vulnerable (or this was how Sherlock interpreted his change of position).
“Because you've already caught one of us.” Gibson looked up at him and smiled again. “You must remember, it wasn't that long ago. She was doing pattern research.”
There was no reply and when he looked up he only saw Lestrade looking at him with uncertainty and Donovan glaring at him with disdain. It hit him that John wasn't there so he turned on his heel and strode to the start of the path to measure for himself.
“I can catch a rat,” Sherlock huffed. “And a fish with my bare hands. It's just patience and sleight of hand.”
Sherlock smiled crookedly, returning to his text messages. “Nope,” he said. Lestrade had sent more photos for him to look at, but he hardly paid attention to any, just flipped through them, feeling smug. Though the kisses he'd shared with John had been what he felt was quality work, he was also ready to go further with the quantity and the temporal aspects. As in, he wanted more of it more often.
“Or cyclosporiasis,” John replied, voice a bit tighter again as the light disappeared (or that was the reason Sherlock assumed made John uncomfortable). “If sewage has leaked in.”
“For God's sake, John, take my phone and move out of the way before the floor gives out again.” He was reaching down with their only source of light (John's mobile was now useless as it was underwater). He'd determined passing it down was the best way to keep it from getting wet should his descent fail to be entirely graceful. The combined length of their arms was just enough for John to be able to grasp the bottom of the phone when Sherlock hung his arm straight down off the edge off the hole.
But in the downstairs bedroom John didn't put him to bed and instead caught his face between his hands and leaned up to kiss him again. It was not unpleasant. It was also borderline taking advantage of Sherlock's unguarded state but Sherlock didn't hold that against John. It's what he would've done too. His minimal response didn't seem to bother John either, so Sherlock concluded it was a show of affection. Curiously enough, when John kissed him Sherlock did feel more affectionate towards him. His brain, quite new to the feeling, rationalised it by saying he was just creating more oxytocin.
The man was rather polite. Sherlock had been invited to several battles of wit against killers and other criminals but so far no one had invited him along for the “process.” He also didn't explain that he didn't hand out punishments and he was only interested in guilt as it correlated with his deductions.
Ah, the indifference to the so-called human suffering. It was a conversation they'd had many times, and it was a habit Sherlock found difficult to lose. “Everyone needs a vice.”
“All of them?” Sherlock was looking into his pockets for lockpicks. This house, just like the iron gates, had a very old-fashioned lock. Easier to pick.
Once the long and quiet journey was over and they stood on another empty street, looking up at the building with its black windows, particularly the uppermost floor. John had his hands in his pockets, head craned to look up.
Branded on the inside of his skull. On the backs of his eyeballs. Searing, hot. Tears trickle down his face when a familiar presence offers him sweet, sweet relief. His mind, barreling, helter-skelter, off the tracks, off the map. Falling, plummeting into a ruinous abyss. Chartreuse and calm and quiet and he can’t resist the call of the void.
The shirt falls open. Framing Sherlock’s lean figure. Drawing John’s eye to the dark trail of hair disappearing into his impossibly tight leather trousers.
. Something that should have been hot and fiery and maybe a little hungry. Clumsy hands, shaky breaths, and trembling bodies. But Sherlock is petulant, foiled in a strange turn of events. He accepts John’s kiss, but declines to accommodate him by tilting his head to one side or opening his mouth when John licks his lips. He can’t
Admittedly, John does not have the best track record when it comes to responding to probing questions in an affable manner. He did his best, though. For Sherlock’s sake.
But the point. And it is sex. Sherlock doesn’t care, to put it mildly. John does. Sherlock cares about John. So he will care about their sexual encounters.
It wasn't long until the door opened again and Mycroft stepped in. One of the perhaps most annoying features about him was that he was quite difficult to read, even for Sherlock. He looked indifferent even now, perhaps mildly annoyed.
“They're not broken.” Sherlock looked away, at the deer skull. He knew insisting that he was all right wouldn't make John work any faster (as if he EVER did anything FAST) or stop altogether, so it was best to keep quiet, try not to wince and let him poke around until he was satisfied. After the ribs it was the foot, and then it was the distribution of cold packs and pain tablets, neither of which worked fast like the drugs Sherlock really wanted, but which John never let him have.
John was quiet. Perhaps the cold was already affecting his brain. But then he spoke: “The energy in a human being dissipates upon death, it doesn't stay in a human shape and keep human motivations and interests.”
“John!” Sherlock said as soon as he'd ended the call, grabbing the blanket off him to the sound of complaints. “We have to go!”
John squeezed Sherlock's knee sharply and sighed again, this time with displeasure. But at least that displeasure was mostly aimed at himself and only a little at Sherlock for stating the issue. “Yeah. You're right. Again.”
“No?” John seemed smug (why was he smug, what did he have to be smug about, he was absolutely wrong wrong WRONG, Sherlock liked being misunderstood). “Some people don't care about food is all I'm saying,” John looked at him. No, more than
While the thought that followed on the heels of those words was vastly intriguing and deserved a lot of study, but not until what needed to be said was said. “Are you even a real doctor? It wouldn't RUPTURE.”
John had another sip, sinking deeper into his chair. He propped his free fist under his chin. “I don't swear and I think I'm pretty honest.”
He cleared the desk by pushing all non-breakables off onto the floor and getting a clean sheet from John's closet to spread on it before put the books down. Then he got his surgical lamp and magnifier and some cotton gloves and started studying them.
“This took Lestrade by surprise because he hadn't been aware of how I got involved and instantly took it to mean I must be involved because I'd known where to go for a piece of the same wall-paper. It was obvious he was also entertaining an idea of Mr Gosbeck and me working together. As if I'd ever have a partner!” Sherlock scoffed only to receive silence from John who was frowning at him.
It was wonderful and perfect and Sherlock needed to do something about it. He grabbed John's chin and turned his head this way and that to make the light and shadows and wrinkles move around.
Sherlock was listening, even if only partially, but sometimes John could spot something interesting. Sherlock considered John something of a prism, light went in one way, a rainbow came out the other way (no homosexual implications meant), he was an array of options and viewpoints and now indelibly attached to Sherlock's methods.
“We're taking these, go pay the man,” Sherlock said, reaching into the locker to take one of the books.
He got up when his internal clock and bladder demanded it, had an awkward wash with his foot sticking out of the bath because of the cast (John's fault) and eventually progressed to gnawing on biscuits and leftover bacon on the sofa (ignoring the canned soups out of spite). He wore pyjamas and John's cardigan, determined to somehow stretch it out of shape (though it was too big for him, just the sleeves were too short).
“Nothing lasts forever, John,” Sherlock said, attempting to let John get to his point at his own pace.
“It literally perpetuates itself,” Sherlock snapped. “Is this all? I want to go home and have a shower. I spent thirty-seven minutes in what was essentially a sewer.”
And the key itself. Where did it lead? If it was for a storage unit, what was in it that needed to be hidden? To be eaten away? Was it something valuable or something dangerous? (Both?) Did the man who had eaten it have anything to do with it? It wasn't a coincidence, it rarely was. John was a great proponent of coincidence and undoubtedly he'd suggest that as soon as he woke up. Or as late as he woke up.
“Stop the cab!” Sherlock shoves John outside when the taxi screeches to a halt. Sherlock is a study in wounded pride, not-quite shame coloring his Hellenistic cheeks pink. John wishes he’d kept his mouth shut. Doesn’t stop him from thinking that Sherlock is kind of adorable when he’s trying to prove a point. If that’s what he has in mind. Points to prove, not John Watson’s to murder.
“Clear your schedule Monday next. We’ve been invited to attend the gallery of Lois Mozelle, whom I will woo with unrepentant charm. She will then attempt to murder me and disunite my genitals in the name of art.”
It occurs to Sherlock again—that makes three, a number Sherlock finds pleasing—that he doesn’t know how to be effectively comforting. Compromised, sure. Innocent, no problem. Charming, hell yes. He hasn’t had to resort to comforting in years. Not that he can remember, anyway. Must’ve deleted it. Nothing the internet can’t fix.
Sherlock has studied love for the purpose of navigating its convoluted justifications and breakable vows of monogamy. Love is a vicious motivator. The masses fall in and out of it, trying on new partners like trying on new outfits to wear. What he has with John isn’t love. It’s
Sherlock grins. “Don’t be so hard on yourself, John. I’m sure you can distract me for a day or two.”
“You’re the expert.” John brings a waxy paintbrush to Sherlock’s mouth. “Why aren’t you perfecting this disguise yourself?”
Sherlock’s arm grows heavy. He rests his elbow on his stomach. Watches John suck on the tip of his middle finger, nibble on his nail, while he adds perfunctory punctuation.
John cannot see Mycroft’s reaction, but he can envision he’s fighting tooth and nail not to leap to his feet in a hurry. John mouths to Sherlock:
John unbuttons Sherlock’s jacket. He watches Sherlock’s chest heave, completely entranced by the lithe rise and fall, rise and fall. John gulps, eyes darting to Sherlock’s face to gauge his reaction.
The turning point. The realization. The fourth movement of a symphony. Allegro, maybe? Hell if he knows. Sherlock would. He would know. John makes a mental note to ask him later and the very idea of
“But you know all about me, don’t you?” Painted lips. Polished nails. Eyeliner applied with a steady, practiced hand. She’s gutsy. Definitely a trait John would admire, along with her sizeable breasts. Mary Magdalene smiles at Sherlock without humor. He can see it in her eyes. That cold, calculating look oft referred to as woman’s intuition. A lioness on the prowl, preparing to pounce. “I’ve read John’s blog. Seen the papers.” Mary sizes him up, her evaluation of him rendering her most apathetic indeed. He is not a threat.
Sherlock transfers his grip from John’s shoulder to the back of John’s chair, picking up his routine from where he’d left off before. He arcs his neck, the pale column of his throat illuminated by the red and gold lights of the pub.
. (If he’s capitalizing willy-nilly, he might as well go whole hog.) Focuses on the fact that John is going to kiss him. (Or maybe punch him. John does surprise.) Sherlock is obtuse when it comes to sentiment and all its trappings he eschews, but he’s adept at interpreting a shift of the eyes, a nibble of the lip. Micro expressions. John wants him.
Sherlock is a loser. Because love is a chemical defect found on the losing side. Because John Watson has somehow, someway wormed himself not only inside Sherlock’s heart, but also inside Sherlock’s head—where it matters. He can feel him there behind his waking eyes. A visceral rhythm pounding and pounding in the environs of his sinus cavity. Bright. Beautiful. Loud. Sherlock, more than once, is confident he’s hallucinating. That he’s been drugged. Tripping on acid or cocaine. Jonesing for nicotine at the very least.
,” John punctuates the word of the day with a heaping helping of soldiery bite, “isn’t necessary. If this is some kind of, of
A young woman is presented to Mycroft. She has managed to squeeze into a size two when she should be wearing a size four. Face artfully painted, lipstick in rogue. Hair washed and styled and pinned. She’s beaming.
The sound of breaking glass and a woman’s cry yank John out of his lust-fueled trance. He stumbles out of his chair and into the pub where Sherlock is garroting a man twice his size with his gauzy shirt of sex.
John clenches his teeth. Like he can willfully subdue the blush tinging his cheeks. “Later,” he says, which is code for
Sherlock’s mind has always fascinated John, but there are times his mind terrifies the shit out of him. Like when John walked in on Sherlock navigating the rooms of his mind palace, for instance. Sherlock was unresponsive to any and every stimuli. Food (
He kisses Sherlock’s lips with all the palliative reverence he can muster. Warm. Chaste. He revels in the tentative breath shared between the two of them. A promise. A pledge. Short and sweet and more alluringly provocative than he could have imagined, fever dreams of passion incomparable to the titillation of naked affection. Their bodies thrum with the implications.
A ring. Gunmetal grey. Tungsten, so says the gold-embossed placard. Heavy. And tough, apparently. Next only to diamond on the Moh’s Hardness Scale. Virtually impossible to scratch. (Unlike Sherlock’s ring, which is already showing signs of wear.) Meant to be felt when worn, despite its elegant cut.
Must be written all over Sherlock’s face because Mycroft grins wryly. “He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to you. I’m afraid,” he says, picking lint from the arm of John’s recliner, “that if he were to sever ties during this particular juncture of your…”
Sherlock is not good at dating. Or dates. He finds them predictable. Tedious. Sherlock wouldn’t call himself a connoisseur, per se, but he’s disrupted enough of John’s half-arsed attempts to woo the fairer sex to have a good idea of what to expect. Dinner. A movie. Heinous.
“There is nothing more tedious,” Sherlock drones, reciting the oft-repeated anthem of his supposedly mind-numbing existence. “than knowing
Sherlock recognizes the signs that he’s hyperventilating. Can’t stop. Out of his control. Everything is out of his control and John can’t leave him. He isn’t allowed. Sherlock is dying first; they’ve already discussed this. (
John supposes. He let's Sherlock sprawl across his person, enjoying the warmth himself. Absently brushes his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
. So agonizing. Hanging in limbo because John needs Sherlock to be honest, open, and never to fake his death without John’s express permission.
“I will when you stop asking me to.” Sherlock’s fingers are gripping the pulse point of John’s wrist.
John swallows. He can feel heat rising in his face, pooling between his legs. His mouth is full of saliva at the thought of seeing even a hint of Sherlock’s naked body.
They stand together, conversing on a level unremitting. Their love masquerades as an alleyway, winding strategically around Sherlock’s heart.
He’s never prayed for anything so earnestly in his life. Not even when he was dying in the desert in Afghanistan.
. Because it's the size of a miniature Olympic swimming pool.  With two faucets, jets, and courtesy salts and bubbles John can’t even begin to pronounce. But oh God it feels nice. Slipping his body, worn from travel, into a piping hot mixture of eucalyptus and mint. His sinuses are singing.
Sherlock is hiding a smile. John can see it. Tucked in the left-hand corner of his mouth. “When?” He knows bloody well when, but John indulges him anyway.
all the bloody time. I let him hit me because I thought it would inspire a rebound. I was mistaken.” Leans forward. Breathes heavily into John’s shoulder. Like the world at large is unbearable and obvious and can’t John please make it better?
Sherlock has studied love for the purpose of navigating its convoluted justifications and breakable vows of monogamy. The masses fall in and out of it, trying on new partners like trying on new outfits to wear. What he has with John isn’t love. It’s
Sherlock sees his mother kiss his father on the cheek. He gauges his father’s reaction. The corners of his mouth tightening, his father does not divert his attention from the medical journal he’s reading.
John marshals the brainpower to ask, “Why not?” Laughs appreciatively when Sherlock settles in his lap.
John’s noblesse oblige waylays the common cold. Makes his eyes water and his ears roar. He does not force himself inside Mrs. Hudson’s home even though he wants to yank the landline off the wall. Does not chastise Sherlock for speaking with he whom John henceforth refers to as
Sorry for the delay! I should take this time to inform you all that for the next three months, I will be neck deep in work. I have a job in the formalwear industry and Prom and Wedding season is about as intense as Black Friday, but for weeks at a time. So be patient with me if I fail to update quickly. As a side note, if anyone reading this fic is getting married and/or going to prom this season, I ask that you please treat your formalwear provider with kindness and respect. I don't work in retail, but I know the stress must be out of this world. Thank you!
“Because we want to.” John’s hand finds its way under Sherlock’s robe, under his shirt. Rubs his thumb across the breadth of his ribcage. “You’ve been desperate for my attention all day.”
it pains him to listen to John think. Everything the Ferris Wheel incorporates, utter repugnance in Sherlock’s limited experience. Confined spaces. Repetition. Tedium. Comprehension, a frown on John’s face when he finally realises he’ll be accompanying the only grown man he knows who handles boredom about as well as a Attention Deficit Hyperactive two-year-old on the verge of a sugar-induced coma.
In Sherlock’s opinion, it is a mistake to theorize without all the facts. “John is characteristically romantic in his depiction of me and my work. And the papers? Oooh,” he purrs. “Must be true.”
His hands. Validating that which can’t be true, but is. It is tue. Sherlock, drinking him in, legitimate tenderness and honest affirmation. For the first time since John unwittingly/willingly devoted his life to his flatmate, he sees in Sherlock his consummate loyalty—his love—mirrored back at him. And suddenly, it was worth it. All of it. The agony. The despair. The months of despondency.
