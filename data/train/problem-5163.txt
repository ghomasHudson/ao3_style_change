And something inside the demon’s chest stirred.
“It’s fine,” Charlie whispered loudly to the only other sober one in the room, swallowing popcorn and cherishing the feel of salty butter in the crevices of her throat. “This is all the entertainment we need.”

Dean's gaze slowly moved over Cas from head to toe, and then back up to his stony expression like he wanted to crack it open. “Now, that’s not what we like to hear from Heaven’s eternal optimist," he chided. "I’m easy to please, y’know.” He grinned. “And just plain
“Because, see,” the demon continued, waving a hand and evening his expression back out to a faint smirk. “You’ve got nothing. You can chant in Latin, give smiting a go, maybe beat me senseless until I go down and whatever’s left in this burnt out shell comes back up. But you already know the truth, angelcakes.” His eyes flickered back and forth between green and black like a faulty lightbulb. “So why don’t we pick up where you and my dumber half left off, huh?” His voice sharpened into a glib, needling prod. “Seems like the two of you had a nice night all planned out.”
as he washed his hands and splashed some water on his face. He decided to just… try and calm the hell down. Or if he couldn’t do that, then maybe “not panicking anymore” was as good a goal as any.
But the desire came to nothing more than an unvoiced quiver in the back of his throat.
Cas’ eyes flashed. “You’re

for it. I can’t…” Dean trailed off, looking away. “I can’t just let you be the big spoon again, now that all the bullshit we’ve been through is behind us.”
Dean jerks away, dropping Cas’ tie. “Fuck, Cas, I’m— sorry, sorry, I’m drunk, I don’t—”
“He’s— the smoke, it’s— it’s not me, but I—” His head spun sickeningly, the demon’s voice the center of the storm. “I don’t know what I am without him,” Dean choked out, his back sliding down against the rough brick of the wall behind him.
“He’s actually part of the reason why I’m here today,” Cas adds.
cas tries not to think of his moment of total, ice-cold terrifying powerlessness (and isn’t that so odd, too, that his physical body feels things like coldness because of an emotion). it was—odd. that’s all. it was a strange fluctuation. it meant nothing.
Dean and Cas nod. “That’s perfect,” Cas says, and repeats when Ryan mixes the color and shows him it.
“i’m sorry,” cas says into dean’s chest. everything is soft and warm and fuzzy and his words probably slurred a bit. there is such a quietude to the two of them. cas is so used to feeling only power and greatness, heady and, frankly, probably a bit deranged, and now he feels—still. calm.
this time, when cas slumps, he’s caught, wrapped in strong, familiar arms. he doesn’t have the strength to fight it, to even pretend to himself he wants to fight it. he is so tired of all this. based on the subtle shake in dean’s shoulders (nothing compared the rapid tremors of cas’s body), dean is tired of all this as well.
he makes to get out of the shower, and cas can see him getting out and lashing out, breaking something in anger, coming back fuming with barely contained rage under his skin. cas doesn’t want him to leave. doesn’t want him to push out his sadness with anger and come back different. doesn’t want him to break this moment.
“No. It’s a good movie. Jack loves it and so do you.”
“Oh, I love Charlie! She’s great, she always brings snacks and she likes all my stuff on insta,” Ryan replies. She’d flipped with Dean to the other side of Cas’s chest a while ago, and she’s now just about finishing up on the outline of both sides. Cas isn’t talking much anymore, just squeezing Dean’s hand, so Ryan finishes up in silence, and then they’ll take a break.
“Yeah,” Sam says, his voice wry. “Part of me hates that you had to be the one to set them up, but…” he shrugs. “Hey. Getting a break from the drama is gonna be a fair tradeoff.”
want them. He’s an
Cas tried to dart behind him to pull the bear-hug move again, his hands snapping and crackling with whatever stolen grace was still flowing through his veins, but Dean wasn’t going to fall for that a second time. He dodged Cas’ grip and got a solid hit to his kidneys, pulling him around to send him stumbling back into the gap between the bed and the wall, gasping and clutching his side.
Dean tells himself sternly. It’s one goddamn shot. He can handle himself.

Nina stood from the divot that had formed around her in the beanbag, and held out a hand with a sly smile for Laur, who smiled and accepted it in kind. They linked fingers and began to sway, moving this way and that; prompting the coffee table to be pushed aside and their happy giggles to ascend that much higher towards the ceiling. “Come on!” Nina said, looking over her girlfriend’s shoulder at the other couple in the room, waving a wrist and motioning to the empty space on the floor beside them. “Dancing! It’s a party!”

oblivious. And, he despairs as he forces himself to look away from the now-visible dip of Cas’ throat, he has no idea which of those two options is the preferable one. He clears his throat. “What, you think you can beat me this time?”

Dean drives back to the bunker. The door shuts behind him loudly as he walks down the staircase. Sam and Cas are still in the same spots he left them. Dean grins to himself, preparing to surprise both of them with the cat.
Castiel manages to flicker his eyes open the first time when something warm touches his cheek.
"Mind filling me up about yesterday?"
"Dammit, Crowley," she punches his arm playfully. "It would have totally happened, if it weren't for your unworthiness of three pigs sorry ass," Charlie scowls at Crowley.
Grabbing a chair, Dean greets cheerfully as always, "Hey, Cas."
"Could have considered
He chuckles.
Castiel doesn't flinch at the small gesture, he lets Dean's thumb rub circles at the back of his hand. He hums in agreement. "I don't wanna talk about it, Dean, so please drop it, I've already told you what you need to know."
"You really don't have to do—" he gets cut off when Dean shoots a death glare at him, seeming in no mood to argue.
******
"You really don't remember?"
Castiel heard that and, surprisingly enough, he let the cat down cautiously, allowing it to roam freely. “Dean,” he calls back to the hunter.
If looks could kill. Dean knows he's got on Cas' nerves on making the toast comment, but he's managing quite well to not throw a toast right at Dean's face. It's Castiel freaking Novak, who is he kidding, he could do anything to make Dean go away and leave him at his peace. But the chatting part is just getting more fun. And if Castiel is not quitting, then Dean is not giving up either. He hesitates at first, looking at Cas' profile, savouring the image before he shuffles on his feet, he follows, crowding behind Cas, leaving a little gap in between them. He stares at Cas being engrossed, eyes lingering on the curve of his neck.
“Thank you, Dean. I love you.” Castiel hugs the cat, who keeps meowing at him.
"I don't know what joy you find in doing this, but this has to stop, I'm not your driver, I'm not your servant, I'm not-" he stops in between noticing Dean's been smiling all the time without paying attention to any word he just said, he searches his eyes breathing in the same air. "You have the smell of alcohol all over you."
"He is pissed, look, his hair is also standing in every direction, we pissed off his hair too," pointing at Cas' hair, Benny says.
Let me out!" Castiel bangs loudly on the metal door.
"Hey, you're back, I, uh, went grocery shopping," Dean, says, entering the living room and shrugging off his jacket as he places the grocery bags on the table. "I'll be out with Lisa tonight, got myself a date night, we've decided to take things slow," he says, flopping down on the couch next Castiel, who's not at all interested in any kind of chit-chat.
"Down the hall to the left," Castiel answers.
"You’ve lost your
He rushes towards Cas to separate them. "Get off him. You don't wanna do this," Dean tries pushing Castiel off Alastair.
As they are making their way out of the alley, the kitten meows again. This time, it is a cry for help and, of course, Cas heeds it. Unlike Dean, who is still ignoring the creature, the angel stops midway through the alley to look back, and Dean rolls his eyes thinking maybe Cas is taking one last look. The next time Dean halts when he hears the 'Meow' sound growing closer. He turns around to find that the cat has jumped out of the box and is following Cas. Dean almost gasps at the sight. That freaking animal is rubbing its head on Cas' leg!
After Sprinkles is fed and hydrated, Dean makes a bold move. According to his calculations, he has also given Cas enough time to pet the thing. So maybe Cas will let go of his obsession. “It's getting late, Cas, we should go.”
After last night, Castiel was really considering hanging out with Dean for a little while. Castiel has thought a lot about it since then. It doesn't have to be hours long conversations, they can start with small talk, maybe over dinner because they both do eat the whole meal in silence mostly and it would be a great time to share their likes and dislikes, plus, they could talk about what common interests they both share so they could talk around each other more often.
"Hello." He wonders who's calling this time of the night; there might be some kind of emergency.
(Are you guys trying that sexy silence thing on me? Because either you all are ghost readers or you all are a huge fan of Jensen long con Ackles. I hope you guys break your sexy silence when my favourite chapter comes.)
"Isn't that a leverage?"
getting as far as possible from that stupid couch and stupid Dean.
"Wait. Are you banging my brother? Because if you are, I am coming there to kick you in the ass if you ever try to hurt my lil’ bro or break his heart."
Once outside, the anger buried within Castiel from the past couple of days bubbles up, corrupting his soul. "You are insane!" slamming Dean against the wall, he sneered. Enough is enough. This wouldn't be a scenario if he hadn't had hold on for this long. He gave up everything just to pick Dean up from the damn bar and this is what he gets in return?
Dean pats him again.
Dean grins at the man leaning on him as Castiel stands frozen, embarrassed and flustered before he collects himself, casting his gaze to the side only to find Dean grinning wide at him. In an instinct, Cas' face goes pale, his blood runs cold, every part of him goes on pause as his mind catches up, falling into the abyss of reality. It hits him. He has fallen for another one of Dean's stupid pranks. His expression is one of shock and horror, it feels like he'll suffocate in himself.
But something about his luck is not quite cooperating since Winchester entered his life. He has already made the payment from his savings to the agent, who was supposed to meet him around the corner along with the spare key and help him move in, but, not only did he got stood up over a text, the owner also decided to change his decision at the last moment and rent the place to some family rather than a wicked lone some guy going through his college phase.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ignoring the call, he goes back to work. He sits there for some time, eyes on the book, index finger playing with the corner of the page, causing it to wrinkle around the edge as he reads the same sentence over and over again. His mind is not at its best, and it refuses to cooperate and process the words in front of it; maybe it's the call that distracted him, because what if something goes wrong? What if Dean gets himself in trouble? There are a lot of terrible things that could happen to him right now, he could even get injured, and all because Castiel is being selfish and ignoring a damn phone call.
"What do I want, seriously? You are the one hiding the secret boyfriend here," Dean complains, "You could at least allow me to meet your friends," he says, getting a little defensive, and soon regrets it.
Dean heaves a sigh, his thoughts drifting back to the staircase guy, and so began the inevitable ranting causing Crowley and Benny to roll eyes at him.
"As long as you plan on keeping it low." Castiel says.
In his defence. He is only being honest.
"Because a guy like you, Cas, should not stay single, go out there, explore the wonders of the world, get laid, kiss someone when the clock hits twelve," Dean states, educating Castiel.
Attention on the book, Cas begins, “Sam, please tell your brothe–”
Looking back at Castiel in a vague manner, Dean appears lost, processing the smirk he just gave, his eyes tracks over to Castiel's face briefly before he lets out a short chuckle making a mental note to himself;
He isn't thinking when he lets out his boiling hate and swings his fist too quickly into Dean's nose. The pain, blazing up his arm, surprises him incredibly, leading him to a conclusion: throwing a punch hurts just as much as receiving it. But wasn't it worth it?
"Hiya, Cas," Dean says, looking down with a smile on his face and a mix of wine and beer in his breath.
Castiel settles down, keeping his bag aside with some kind of book to do his research while Dean makes himself comfortable, resting his elbow on the table. “What are you doing, Dean?” Castiel lets out a sigh.
This is the most Castiel has enjoyed himself in weeks, watching Dean snarl while the librarian bans him from stepping a foot inside these halls as two people have to kick him out because he is giving a hard protest, earning a lot of glances from the students sitting around.
Somehow, he manages to get them inside but the real challenge in front of him is to get them upstairs. He literally has to push them from behind. Placing his hand to support their back hoping both men don't end up rolling down the staircase. "I can't do this," Dean gives up, sinking down on a step.
None of them responds; they are both busy giggling about something. Castiel, on the other hand, can't take their shit anymore; he is tired as hell, and this is not how he thought this night was going to be, this wasn't supposed to happen. He wants to go home and crawl into bed, not get stuck here in a damn bar with two drunks.
Dean runs in, rushing to the top. The door is still locked. Unlocking it, he barges in, realizing it is freezing out here.
This wait is eating him from inside, he was hoping Castiel would return after he cleared his head out but, as the sun goes down and darkness spreads across the city, his worries take a toll over his thoughts. He has to do something. After receiving a text from Charlie giving nada for all possible locations Cas might be, he leaves the house quickly in search of him, assuring Charlie it's not a big deal when she insists on tagging along, he convinces her about Castiel being temporarily upset but not revealing any further details.
“Damn it, Sam!” Dean grits with irritation before getting up and kicking the stupid chair back in the place as he walks away making the way to his own room.
Walking close, he notices his jacket which is still in the box. Dean takes a step forward, lifting one of the sleeves to find the monster huddled in the pool of his jacket, shivering from the cold.
See. This is why Castiel doesn't want to be best buddies with him or get to know Dean on a personal level. He is awful enough to know right now.
With his mind blacking out and giving up on escaping the situation, he meets the gaze of the man leaning above him. The stare he receives is strong, intense, yet so tender. Castiel studies him, realising his expressions are neutral as before, and he feels lost as he breathed in Dean's scent, the sharp jawline blessed with little stubble on the side of his cheeks, freckles dusted across his face like stars, not to forget his hazel green eyes. Castiel finds himself thinking why he has to be so gorgeous and so close.
"It's, It's just nightmares," he finally admits. He doesn't feel like elaborating it more, he doesn't have any more strength left to give details without breaking, and that's the last thing he wants to do: crying in the cafeteria and getting mocked for it for the rest of his life.
Of course Dean is gonna open the door but he is gonna have his fun first. It is funny that Castiel came back, after making snappy comments about moving away and being free from Dean for once and for all.
Dean stares down at him, looking for the damage caused, seeming distracted when he meets the glare of an amazingly blue pair of eyes.
"You were drunk, chief," Benny states, finding it hard to believe it's even a real person because Dean hasn't shut up since morning.
Castiel debates if he has made the right choice staying in the same place as Dean, for whatever reason he has come around to tolerate his little quirks, including their small arguments followed by sarcastic comments. For a long time, he lived alone in this place and, yes, it would get lonely sometimes, he would crash on the couch after long hours of work and, in  those days, dinner seemed off the table, he would get exhausted just by thinking about spending the next hour in the kitchen satisfying his stomach.
And now here he is, with no room to escape, sitting in front of the same Dean Winchester, being forced to tell him the truth. Well, after what Castiel has done to him, the only person actually trying to help him, he thinks Dean at least deserves some answers.
Staring at the closet, he literally has no idea what to wear. A little help from his brother, Gabriel, is satisfying after coming out fully dressed in his white shirt and black pants. After a long negotiation, Gabriel convinces him to lose the jacket of the three piece suit along with the tie at the end.
hours with no food on the cold roof.
Taking in a deep breath, Castiel demands, "You have to stop this now." He narrows his eyes, his patience wearing thin.
"It takes you 5 years to come out of the closet and just a month into college to get yourself a boyfriend!" Gabriel shouts.
"Is she hot?" Sam teases.
Several minutes pass and nothing changes. Dean thought Cas would be back to normal after seeing burgers and fries but, clearly, he was wrong. Cas' nose is still buried deep in the book and he hasn't touched the plate sitting right next to him.
Looking away, Dean lets his hands drop back to his sides before he removes his own leather jacket. He has plenty of them. What difference will it make? Cas, on the other hand, looks confused as Dean offers his own jacket for Sprinkles, laying it inside the small box cautiously so the creature stays warm.
"Save it," Dean shots back.
"Geez, Cas, we're just friends, gonna grab a beer or two and chill, you are welcome to join." He looks over Castiel, who is still rummaging through his book.
Castiel glares at him from the corner of his eye. "I do not know what they all see in you but I can say for sure they are falling for a facade. I pity them," Castiel says the last bit in empathy.
Losing track of his thoughts, his mind is lost in deep green eyes and admiring those freckles, that clenched and perfect jawline. No wonder he could pick a girl at the party that easily.
Opening the first book from the pile Sam begins reading; his mind is too disturbed to focus on the words in front of him. He reads the same line over and over again thinking of taking a vacation or running off to some crappy motel where he can have some time to himself and, finally, some peace.
Dean grunts in annoyance, “You know what? I am done! With both of you. I am going for a drive.”
So far, Dean has never seen him smile, and he wonders if he's always this angry, when he has such a beautiful smile, a smile that can make anyone's day; it really suits him. Placing it back where he found it, Dean positions himself comfortably before falling asleep.
Castiel gives the kitty a gentle push in the direction of the box but it clearly doesn't want to crawl back into its box. Soon it returns to Cas, meowing in protest.
. He sucks in a shocked gasp. Alastair is grinning at him.
Dean almost sprains his leg, losing balance when Cas shouts back.
"Shut it. And fill me up."
Cas pulls back just a little, his hands still resting on the hunter's neck as a soft smile plays along Dean's lips. They stand there like that, hands still lingering on each other under the soft light of the library, and Castiel whispers, “I love you.”
"Hey, Castiel." Lisa returns his gesture. "We're going out, would you like to join us?" she asks.
"Take these aspirins, my job as babysitting you is done, and, yes, you both fucked, live with it," Castiel spats, placing the bottle of aspirin on the nightstand with force.
"Come on, your bed is ready."
Moving a finger along the skin, he asks carefully, "This one hurts?"
"I'm sorry," Dean pleads over and over again. This is all his fault. "I am so sorry," he murmurs, low, almost inaudible, rubbing his thumb over Castiel's cheekbone.
. Strange name. Dean turns a few pages, going through the book. He finds a paper pressed between the pages in the process, folded in half, kept inside the book. Taking it out, he unfolds it. It's a polaroid picture. It's a photo of Castiel and some other mysterious guy. Castiel seems really happy. There's a garden or a playground in the background, his hair is messy and he's wearing a dark blue shirt, giving a bright smile, showing a glimpse of his front teeth, and there's this other innocent looking guy, almost Castiel's height, hugging him from sideways.
"Everyday, man. Your hair is always messed up, anyways. You don't need it." Dean states as a matter of fact.
Grumpily, Castiel returns with the same speed and struggles with the huge and heavy luggage, panting, "I'm gonna take these back then I will take a nap,"
Dean settles back quietly, noticing the slight hint of anger in Castiel’s voice. He’s thinking about another way to talk to Cas when someone on the other side of Castiel asks, “Are you okay?”
Yeah. That was Castiel who lectured him and took away his TV privileges for a stupid mistake.
"Hoping that you will combust."
Cas looks a little upset at that statement so Dean continues. “Come on, man, it's just a cat. It will be fine. But you know who's not gonna be fine?" Dean tries to change the subject. "Sam if we don't get back! He was already hungry when we left."
Hello! Lovely Hellers!
"Don't make it hard on yourself to find love, Cas."
Looking at Castiel and his honest, blue eyes, full of unspoken longing, Dean stares at him, not showing any sign of backing off, Dean tightens his grip, stopping Castiel from getting out. They stand there. No words spoken, stillness filling the atmosphere, with Dean's hand on Cas' waist, when his gaze flickers down to Cas' lips briefly and Castiel isn't surprised by what Dean does next.
"Looks like you've fallen for me," Dean smirks, looking down at him.
"He has been having nightmares ever since Michael died, little bro didn't take Michael's death well." There’s a little pause before he speaks again, "Michael was our brother, pretty close to Cassie. Just be there for him when he has one, don't leave him alone, I don't trust him on that."
"Yeah, a pretty bad one."
soon. He is so concerned about one word that his mind totally forgets the insult about his hair. "I'm too tired to have this conversation. I need a nap," he says, taking in a deep breath before walking past Dean.
Dean shook his head, not trusting any of the words that had the potential to leave his mouth.
He’d forced himself to adjust back to human vulnerability as fast as he could, into sleeping and eating and wrapping up his wounds. (Because he could get hurt again, now. Did it happen this often before? He couldn’t remember). So every time he caught himself thinking back to the feel of the Mark’s corruption running unbidden through his veins, to the

Dean looked up to meet his gaze, and his throat closed around a broken exhale, lips still parted in a silent, desperate plea.

moved to sit down at the edge of his bed, and after a moment Cas appeared to take that as a cue to do the same, sitting down about a foot to the Winchester’s right.

Dean and Cas had had an incredible dinner that Christmas night, and wonderful moment after wonderful moment with every one, big or small, that passed.

“Oh, definitely,” Charlie answered this time. “When I was reading Edlund’s stuff? You could see it. Humanity changed him.” She stopped, and made a visible face of thought, and Sam’s breath hitched slightly in anticipation. “Though, honestly?” she said next. “I think it might’ve been one human in particular.”
“...stars of hyacinth,” Dean murmured finally. He looked like he wanted to continue, but he shifted to the side, and began to yawn, looking as if he might fall asleep. “A flower. Beautiful. Just...like he is.”
But he hadn’t been pursuing anything for himself, aside from what pleasure he might get out of defiling this fallen monstrosity of an angel just that little bit further; or maybe some good ol’ R&R if he actually succeeded in getting the uptight feather duster into bed. He

or something. Which— Cas isn’t into him, that’s not—
Some time passed, and Dean never owned up to where he was getting the little gifts he'd present to Cas- the tie with minimalist bee sketches printed on it with distress inks (which Cas decided would be kept lovingly on his dresser, despite the fact that he didn't wear ties much anymore as a human); the blanket that was striped and lined with cotton so soft it felt like the down of angel feathers (big enough for the both of them to drape over their backs); or the small jars of grape jelly, each a different kind and carefully packaged with tissue paper and hand-scripted labels. Sam grew mildly suspicious, but he didn't say anything outright, given how much warmth he felt between the two of them.

But he knew he could never hurt a Led Zeppelin record, however much the owner might deserve it.
Dean shrugs, grinning. “Why not? It’s more fun when you’ve got somethin’ on the line.”

Finally, still fighting the looming feeling that this is going to end very,
“Sure, why the hell not,” the Winchester in question answered, meeting her conspiratorial smirk with one of his own. “Lay it on me.”
Dean’s head
More sketchbooks quickly found their way into the Bunker, ready and waiting to fill the need, and eventually watercolors, markers, and color pencils followed right behind.
Caleb gave a sound of disgust, and Dean laughed, reaching over to smack his shoulder. “Ignore the loopy crew of the Milano over there, Cay,” he said, aware of the exact moment that Nina’s combative fire was ignited anew. “Your engine parts are damn good, legally stocked or not.” he then broke off. “Maybe I should have a talk with those guys, though.”
I’m gonna waste it on a night in with a box of limp pizza, watching crappy reruns on a TV that doesn't go five minutes without static.”
what had he— he couldn’t stop thinking about the way it’d felt as his punches had rained down, skin breaking and bone grinding, a visceral grin lurking in the corners of his mouth the whole time.
once, even, as dean describes a recent fight with some croats, cas compares dean’s leadership to that of his older brother uriel in battle. dean freezes up at this, but doesn’t yell. both he and cas have brothers who have done terrible things. he can’t lash out at cas for missing the people he’d once loved, even if they’d hurt them both since then.
“You look like my smoking hot trans husband,” Dean answers with a laugh. “Oh hey, hey!” Dean pulls his phone out of his pocket and holds it up to take a picture. “Do a pose, flex or something, I wanna send this to the gang.”
“I understand. I am an… unconventional trans person,” Cas answers with a warm little smile.
when dean enters the cabin the next day, cas’s old clothes in hand and ready for at least another meal together, cas does not look up from his spot on the floor. he watches twinkie skitter off into the corner and makes no other movement. in the light from the open door, dean can see the shadows of cas’s wings, still as broken and shedding as they’ve been for days, weeks, months. cas doesn’t say a word the whole time dean is there.
Banter is good, Ryan notes. It means he’s not in too much pain. Honestly, his voice sounds pretty steady, so maybe Dean was right about that pain tolerance.
dean bumps his shoulder into cas’s. cas does not move.
he takes a long time, certainly longer than cas believes dean takes on his own face. cas does not mind, even though by the time they finish, the water has grown lukewarm and he is nearly fighting shivers. he got to be the subject of dean’s full attention, got to feel like something holy and precious by a being with consciousness again, and all for the simple virtue of being himself. he got to have dean’s hand on his face, gentle pressure pushing him here and there.
“How long have you two been together?” Ryan asks.
“What are you two whispering about over here?” Dean comes over and asks as Ryan finishes up and Cas is thoroughly wrapped.
“It’ll be quicker now,” Ryan promises as they get back into position for the colors. “You don’t have any big complicated shading or anything like that, so it’ll be easy.”
“Alright, Cas, you’re done,” Ryan announces, and steps out of the way to let him check in the mirror. “Take a look, but don’t touch them directly.”
cas can’t help but lean into it, just like dean always leaned into touch. he understands the appeal, now, in this moment. he wants to be wrapped in warmth and weight forever. he wants some way out of all this.
The sketches are pretty quick and easy, too, since she’s mostly just following the line of Cas’s muscles already. Plus, Dean stands above and reassures both her and Cas that she’s doing fine, and given that he drew the sketch, she trusts that he knows what Cas wants.
But first things first. “Okay, so, if I’m gonna do this, I’ll need your ID, and you’ll need to fill out this consent form.” Ryan trades the form for Cas’s ID, and takes a picture for the shop records. That’s the only reason she actually asks for it, all the legalities, because the guy is clearly middle-aged. According to his ID, his full name is Castiel Winchester.
“Dean, I have never once flexed in my life,” Cas replies, still smiling.
this time, though, dean walks in and sits right next to cas. he moves slowly, lets his footsteps announce to cas exactly what he’s doing, as if cas is a frightened animal that may lash out and not an angel and a god. besides, the only one of them that’s lashed out any time lately is dean.
“Yeah, well, they’ve gotta, it’s like written in the DNA of younger siblings or something,” Dean replies. “And she’ll love it anyway, we’re too adorable for her not to.”
dean’s thumb roves over to brush cas’s lower lip. cas looks up to find dean’s eyes on his own, intense. questioning. requesting.
In response, Ryan just holds out her left forearm, where she’s got the trans symbol tattooed in black on her brown skin, little blue and pink flowers growing around it.
“Buddy, that’s just a bonus, I’ll even wear them to get the tattoo. Hell, I’ll get you a matching pair!”
dean stands. he squeezes out the sponge and gives cas the flash of a smile. “now that wasn’t so bad, was it?”
the deal with these guys? “But yeah. Yeah, I guess they are pretty special.”
“Yeah, fine, I do.”
“We are pretty adorable,” Cas agrees with a smile and a nod.
“And having a great party,” Dean adds. “But yeah, we’ve been through so much together, so even when we weren’t ‘together’ together, we were something. Best friends, family, whatever. I mean, we were co-parenting before we were even actually a thing.” He laughs. “We’re all out of order.”
cas cannot imagine saying no.
cas doesn’t get into moods like dean and twinkie do. he is not particularly changeable from day to day anymore. he has all he needs, him and his creation in their endless cycle, contained in their cabin. with so little variation in his external life, it would make no sense for his internal life to change much either.
Cas nods and sits back down, looking at himself in the mirror until Ryan has to lower the chair back and Cas is laying mostly flat.
Ryan nods. She might not understand his whole deal, but she knows that concept Cas is talking about. “They call that body reclamation. It’s super popular in the tattoo community, people get all sorts of tattoos trying to make their bodies home.”
“Well, if anyone wants a tattoo and a body reclamation chat, you know who to refer them to,” Ryan jokes.
It’s been going pretty well. Cas’s pain tolerance is as promised, and he’s not swelling up or bleeding too much, so it’s been smooth sailing.
“You ready to get this show on the road?” Ryan asks.
When she turns back from getting her stuff in order, she finds Cas and Dean kissing, Cas now shirtless as well. It’s probably just a short peck, but Ryan looks away again to give them a bit of privacy, and realizes she should probably pull her braids back out of her face anyway. By the time she’s done, Cas is getting settled in the chair.
“Make sure you drink some water, and you might want to eat something,” Ryan tells Cas, but she largely directs it at Dean, who has the backpack that any snacks might be in. He pulls out some pop-tarts, and Ryan leaves them to their devices as she stretches and drinks her own water.
cas is supposed to eat too, now. supposed to eat and drink and maintain himself like a human. but he is not a human, yet. he is still an angel. to his creation, he is god.
but then, looking down at its crushed little body, cas is filled with the sudden and overwhelming terror that this will be the time where his grace has entirely run out, and it will be dead forever and cas wil have nothing. his stomach drops, and all the power he felt a moment ago, the power he has been feeling since he intwined his life with this cockroach, drains out of him until he is nothing. his position suddenly does feel like kneeling, but he refuses to pray. he has not prayed in a long time, and he does not see himself doing so again.
“I’ll consider it if you ever actually wear a pair of cowboy boots,” Cas replies.
“That would be nice,” Ryan says, and she means it. She’s glad these two wound up being fun and confusing weird instead of bad and uncomfortable weird. She’s gotten plenty of that in the past. “You keep saying you’re an odd trans person, but honestly, it’s just nice whenever I do get trans clients at all. Even at a queer tattoo shop, there’s no guarantee the cis people won’t be transphobic, even just casually. Plus, seeing older trans people is just nice.”
somebody who doesn’t have them,” Ryan explains hastily. She’s not doing a great job communicating right now, but to be fair to herself, this is a very weird situation. She’s, like, 80% sure this is an inappropriate tattoo for a cis person to get. “It seems, ya know, kinda in poor taste? Possibly transphobic?”
“Our friend Charlie referred us here already, but we’ll make sure to pay it forward,” Dean says.
Then, it’s time for them to head out, but not before they take her card and both thank her again. She hears Dean gushing to Cas as they get outside about how good he looks, and how cool their matching tattoos are gonna be. Cas softly rubs his chest through his shirt.
the worst things dean says when he’s mad like this (or what would be the worst if cas could care) is that it’s cas’s fault, along with all the other angels, for the shit they were in now and for taking his brother. cas would tell him that he tried his best, that even though he’d wanted the apocalypse to happen once, he’d long since changed his mind. that sam had still made a choice and dean had still made a choice and even though they never should have had to make those choices they still did. that he’d lost family, too, like lucifer and the angels. that he was losing his very essence along with all that.
Cas thinks for a bit, long enough that Ryan is about to apologize and try to move on. He keeps looking over to Dean too, having some silent discussion that Ryan couldn’t even begin to decipher. But, finally, he says, “My life has been pretty abnormal. And… I’ve felt that my body has not always truly been mine, in the sense that it is me. It feels- well, it feels like a body that I am possessing rather than my own, often. But it’s not. It is my body, it is
cas comes dimly to the awareness of a hand on his shoulder and a voice, softly, saying his name, saying, “hey cas, buddy, calm down, it’s okay, you just gotta breathe, yeah cas that’s it you’re hearing me? okay buddy just try to match my breaths, here we go. in… out… in…” and cas is breathing again. he hadn’t even noticed he wasn’t. he is so tired of all his bits of humanity.
“Have we come on too short a notice?” Cas asks. Then, turning to Dean, starts scolding, “I told you we should have made an appointment, Dean.”
“I mean, I’m fine with scar cover-up tattoos, if that’s what this is. I’m just not entirely comfortable tattooing top surgery scars
it’s not perfect. cas still has difficulty speaking much, or paying attention to dean for a long time. but after months of next to no interaction, this, conversation and contact and the kiss (the kiss which dean has been replaying over and over in his head, the one he’s been imagining since back before all this and things were still awful but not quite so), are monumental. there’s no happy ending anymore, of that dean’s pretty certain, but fuck, there might still be some more time for a happier middle.
“whatever you think is best,” cas says. he is being too revealing right now, he knows, but it is so hard not to when he is listening to his body for the first time in a long time, since he last acknowledged the passing of time. with it telling him “tired” and “hungry” and “cold” and “aching in a million places,” it is hard for himself to keep holding up his standards. his new self with his obsession with his creation and caring for nothing else. it takes a lot of energy to be so singularly devoted.
cas does not protest when dean sits, even though it means twinkie is less likely to come near again. that’s okay. he does not need it close at all times, he can be content to just watch it rove around.
“I am an angel,” Castiel says. “Not one of the most well-known ones. Angel of Thursday.”
Ryan had noticed their matching gold wedding bands, but she’s surprised at the time frame. “You guys seem like you’ve been together forever.”
already today he has felt, had his strange moment of gripping fear. and that, of course, didn’t mean anything because cas was fine and still had all the power he could feasibly need. until, of course, he runs out of grace. which he will, someday, down the line. even if it’s long down the line, going from a hypothetical eternity, the only death one in battle with your honor and power intact, to a guarantee of someday rotting away into nothing—it’s overwhelming. cas can’t face the feeling headon, like the sun. he’s avoiding eye contact with it.
“I can work with that.”
Ryan cuts in before they start to squabble for real. “No, it’s not that. I just personally feel uncomfortable with the content of the tattoo.”
Since he’s sounding alright, Ryan hazards a little conversation. “So, who’s Jack? Your kid?”
yet, sometimes, very rarely, he. well. he feels. he feels, still, like a stain in himself that for all his efforts he can’t wash out, left from where dean winchester touched him.
but. for a moment. he glances to where dean sits.
when he is in a good mood, dean calls it twinkie, a bitterly ironic twist to his mouth when he says it.
dean does this again as he finishes. he puts the hand holding the razor down at his side and tilts cas’s head this way and that to check his work.
“hey, cas, no, look at me,” dean says, voice tinged with desperation as he places his cups cas’s other cheek as well, so he is cradling cas’s face entirely. cas drags his eyes back to dean’s, which are filling with tears again, for some reason. “please, just let me clean you up and feed you, you don’t gotta go anywhere, we’ll be right here, we’ll use the shower in here and we can eat on the floor for all i care, just let me help you.”
“So, you mind if I ask; why Ryan?” Dean asks. “I mean, I’m assuming you picked it.”
He flexes for the picture.
Ryan shakes her head. The drawing, clearly of Cas, head-on from the torso up, is pretty good, honestly; it’s just the two overexaggerated lines on his pecs, labelled “tattoos :),” that’s giving Ryan some trouble. “The sketch is… fine, it’s pretty clear what it is, it’s just. Uh.”
then again, he is his creation’s whole world, too, is he not? they are each the grandest thing in the other’s life, the only thing in the other’s life. cas’s power may have dwindled, but he hasn’t felt this powerful, this huge since he was god. since the last time he was god.
“Well, we’ve known each other for thirteen years,” Cas says. “And we’ve been close for nearly that whole time. By the time we got married, it was really just making it official.”
“Okay, yeah, he’s adorable, we’re adorable, let’s get the show on the road,” Dean interjects at last, and Ryan nods.
“They ain’t the most special scars I’ve got,” Dean says with a significant look at Cas and seriously, what
so the two of them sit. cas is tucked between dean’s legs, back to chest again, his knees pulled up against his own chest, as dean lathers the shampoo into his hair. cas’s eyes are closed to keep it out of his eyes, and he just allows dean to do what he does.
He hesitates for a second and looks at Dean, who nods and tells him, “It’s good. They’re good.”
“This is something many people experience?” Cas asks.
“He’s got good pain tolerance,” Dean says, puffing out his chest like it’s his turn to be proud. Interesting time for that, but to each their own. Or something.
after a moment, he is able to find the sound of its heart from where it roams around the edges of the cabin. for the second time that day, he slumps in relief. he is not sure why he is experiencing so many emotions today, but he would truly like to stop.
sometimes, dean brings food. he just leaves it for cas, some of the time, but about an equal amount he’ll try to force cas to eat. cas knows he seems to eat dangerously little to dean, and maybe he does. cas wouldn’t know. he never had to eat before, but his sharp angles and the way a previously unnoticed fog seems to clear his mind every time he eats indicates he likely is, in fact, not having enough. these times, the moments when dean tries to get cas to eat, he seems sad. he tries to talk to cas, but cas rarely bothers to hear the words, only wants to listen to the soft patter of little feet on the floor.
it is understandable. cas gives his creation the best life he can, gives it the touch of grace and the personal favor of its god, like cas knows many humans strive for. but he knows his creation is not a human, and that living beings also want to have some purpose. he is not a wrathful or envious god like his father, so he understands why this life is not always enough for his creation. when cas sees that it has felt aimless for a long while, he will make it mazes from sticks and stones and hope that soon someone (dean) will bring around scraps of food he can give it. he wants it to be happy, to have purpose.
“Calling us old men, just like Claire,” Dean says, quiet, into Cas’s shoulder, and Cas laughs a little.
“cas,” dean whispers again, broken and soft and sweeter than anything he’s ever heard from dean. “let me- let me take care of you for a bit, cas.”
“Oh!” Dean says, realization dawning on his face, and then he grins a little sheepishly. “I- you- you know what, yeah, that’s, uh, that’s fair, but hey!” And now his grin turns charming as he winks and lifts up one side of his shirt to reveal soft love handles and his own authentic top surgery scars, “Don’t worry. Trans guy approved.” He drops his shirt. “Plus, my buddy here is actually trans, too.”
Cas does, but then continues what he was saying as she gets over with the wrap. “I mean it. I know it’s your job, but it made you uncomfortable at first. I’m glad you gave us a chance. And you were a good companion.”
cas feels his heart rate increase slightly with panic, but he’s let himself get too invested in his old life again today already. he cares too much about dean right now to be able to hurt him. he’ll still be here, can check on twinkie anytime. it will be okay.
“That’s… it’s complicated,” Dean answers, rubbing his neck a little sheepishly.
Cas, very tactfully, reminds Dean of the time earlier in the week he’d apparently stubbed his toe and cursed for two straight minutes, teaching someone named Jack several new words he’d insisted on repeating all day. So he’s not really one to talk.
She might ask about it a little, though. They need something to talk about during the tattoo, after all.
as they eat, cas, with great difficulty, talks a bit about his creation.
“alright,” dean says, “we’re gonna get you undressed so i can wash all this, alright?”
“It’s kind of a basic tattoo, but I still like it,” Ryan says. “It was my first one.”
cas was trying to not think about that kind of thing. right. he searches for his creation again, looks for its shining black back and listens for its little tapping feet, but there’s an odd rushing in his ears making it hard to hear anything else, and twinkie, his creation, could be dead, and his vision seems to be getting darker too, and oh no is he losing his grace even faster, has he lost his ability to see in the dark, has he lost his creation his whole world is he left only with his mortal self and his mortal loved ones (loved one) and nothing else, what will he do if he loses everything dear god dear father hated father-
Dean barks out a laugh at that. And then Ryan fills in the last spot on Cas’s chest with color, and the tattoo is done. She steps back to take a look from afar, then leans in again to double-check up close that she didn’t miss anything, but it all looks pretty even.
he pulls away from dean, as quickly as his weak, human body will let him. he wonders for a brief moment how claire and amelia novak are these days. dead, probably. and he’s still riding around in their loved one, letting the body of jimmy novak deteriorate in his control.
Cas looks back at Ryan again, expression still soft, but kind of smug and proud, too. Like he knows he got a real catch in Dean. Ryan smiles at him, too, like she agrees and like she gets it. Which she does. That’s how she looks whenever she gets her own partner all flustered.
cas stumbles, instantly, head spinning and legs like jello, but dean just holds him up against his body until cas can stand mostly still. dean still keeps a hand on cas, just in case.
whatever
Sam gave a knowing smile, and slipped away, leaving the two of them together.
“I meant the cash register,” the Winchester teasingly clarified. “I’m sure the people will understand.”
when the weights of the world weren’t on his shoulders, and that included the scents of peppermint and pine faintly saturating the air; the small-town vibes this place had that meant wreaths hung over storefronts, and a thin layer of snow dusted over the sidewalks. Dean watched from where he sat on his park bench, the space beneath his eyes bright for the first time in years.
Just like I was back in that barn
“Come on, then,” the WInchester, clapping Cas over the back, and then deciding to let his hand stay there. “I’ve got a whole day planned for us.”

“Dean,” Cas said, stepping closer, and Dean flinched reflexively.

When did
Cas pulled the Winchester back up in a single fluid motion and spun him from in front, positioning himself so he could sway with his back pressed against Dean’s stomach, and the audience members went still, more eyes wide than not and more than one hand delivering a pat on the shoulder to the man for whom their respect was more than doubled.
The screen faded, and Dean stared into the ghostly imprint of the final frame, his face blissfully frozen in the beginnings of a drunken coma.
He sank to his knees, half-leaned up against his bed, his hands clenched in his lap. They shook, a fine tremor that Dean couldn’t do a thing to stop.

“What did you do?”
“Silverware?” the young nephilim asked, questioning the first thing that met his gaze. He matched Castiel’s expression and looked up at Dean as well, both brows characteristically dipping in uncertainty. “Are these for you and Cas?”
I kissed you Cas, and I liked it
wouldn’t.”
Thank you so much for reading! I really hope you've enjoyed! <3
he thought.
“Thanks.”
Dean’s eyes glittered with excitement.
Crowley… he said he’d only give Dean a nudge. And Sam saw the way Dean checked Cas out earlier today, saw how much more touchy-feely he is with him tonight. A nudge is probably all he needs.
They looked at each other, eyes locked.
Dean thought.
“Cas…” Dean murmured. There were words catching at the edge of his lips, words that scared him, but felt so
“What, five hours of watching you make out with her in the corner while dated music plays on vinyl?” Dean grinned. “Wouldn’t miss it.”
"Dean?" Cas murmured from where the two of them were loosely pressed together in Dean's bed, the first hazy rays of sunlight outside beginning to paint their side of the Bunker a rich shade of gold.
“You know, if Cas were here, he’d get it,” Dean was saying, pulling the attention back to him with the wave of a hand.
“I said no,” Castiel replied, unyielding, despite how he nearly tripped over the instinct to end the sentence with Dean’s name. “And no matter how many times you ask me, my answer will remain the same.”
Charlie shook herself from the moment’s hold, and nodded, beginning to assemble the snacks and silently vowing to celebrate loudly the second she returned to her room. Meanwhile, Sam took up the half empty bottle of sunset, looking down at the receipt sitting next to it. He wasn’t looking for anything in particular, but then something caught his eye, something that made him look twice.
But when Cas had headed out on a quick errand, and Dean was alone again...he'd taken a breath, opened his browser back up, and vowed not to move until he'd figured this wormhole out.
Charlie said, shifting closer, but evidently taking care not to obscure the camera’s angle.
“Dean.”
the moments you spent so long teaching me bear the most meaning. Do you understand?” He lifted their wrists to the light, hands laced together so perfectly that they seemed indisputably made to be that way. “The little spoon is the one the big spoon gets to hold, and to the big spoon, that is everything.”
loverboy. All you’ve done is make me
“You did...say things, that I don’t believe you would have otherwise,” Cas responded after a moment, and immediately the Winchester’s eyes were on him, in want of an explanation. “Sam took a short video. I didn’t…” Cas trailed off, his heart fluttering slightly at the memory. “When did you learn Enochian, Dean?”
But he was completely frozen, his rage stalled and his fingers having stopped twitching like an addict’s for the first time in over a month.
But Cas didn’t need to know that.

And then the angel's lips found his, a feather-light touch so gentle it was like a kind of pain.
Charlie answered.

“Okay,” Sam says, and Dean is
Dean’s face scrunched up in thought, and he stared up at the ceiling, smiling as the alcohol’s buzz allowed his mind to shift the patterns in the uneven paint to the familiar folds of a beige-colored trench coat. “He’s...intense. But when he’s smiling, his eyes, just…” he thought for a second.
The trembling immediately collapsed down into tiny, furtive shivers, like Dean was a small animal curling into a tight, terrified ball. It made something sharp and painful pull behind Cas’ sternum.
Dean's eyes were consumed by shadow, his resolve hardening and sensation bleeding away.
“What do you mean

The angel flinched. But even if he had… missed something, before, that was not the paramount issue here. That could be dealt with later.
Cas is on his feet in a second, his sword dropping into his hand, and Sam and Dean follow suit, turning to stare at the newcomer in disbelief.
No. In nearly every sense of the metaphor, Dean wasn’t the one it fit.
“Okay,” she called back from the direction of the kitchen. “Watch out for any traps. Never know when a movie might spill into reality around here.”
The room went quiet, and then Dean was out cold in about a minute, his string of thoughts left off with no close to that chapter in sight. Sam stopped the recording, and then stood, looking over his screen before carefully returning it to his pocket. “We should clean up,” he said, somewhat quietly despite the knowledge that Dean probably wouldn’t wake up anytime soon.

“Finally.” The demon winked. “I thought he’d never leave.”
from here,” Dean told him, one last time. “Because either you go, or I do, and if I leave this room then I am going to hurt someone. You know I am.”
His voice sounded hollow in his ears. But Cas was still holding him, and the both of them were still breathing. Still there.
Because Cas isn’t kissing him back.
Crowley rolls his eyes. “Oh come now, Sam. You can be fairly intelligent when the occasion arises. Isn’t that somewhat of a surprise? Your red-blooded, all-American brother could’ve had that girl eating out of the palm of his hand by now. She was certainly willing, judging by the way she kept leaning over the table. And yet, he barely said two words to her. Barely looked at her.”
“Our love is worth letting you steal the blankets,” he responded, before pulling the warm black fabric over his head. “At least, out of guilt, you manage to find me more of them afterward.”
“Damn right. Castiel, a part of me will never forgive you for leaving us to deal with him,” she told him, “but my cash register gets the final say, and fortunately for you, she more than approves.” Nina extended a hand, and Cas shook it, before she turned towards her supplies and the milling customers waiting for their drinks. “I’ll be back with those hot chocolates in just a minute, guys. Don’t stray too far, or you might just end up under some mistletoe,” she said with a wink.

The plan is to take off his flannel, ball it up, and throw it so it hits Cas right smack in the face.

No need to worry about any of
“That’s it,” Cas murmured, hauling himself painfully up off the floor, stretching out a hand. “Come back to me, Dean.” He could see the darkness pushing out, the stifling ashes of anger being swept away. He’d repeat it as many times as it took.
“No,” the angel said. “You don’t want to feel my blood on your hands, or to hear my pain in your ears. You don’t want that.”
It was almost child’s play to trip Cas up, to send him sprawling down onto his back with blood beading along a split in his lip. Dean wanted to punch him again. He wanted to kiss him.

The rapt listener felt his breathing slightly hitch. Just where was this conversation intending to go?
Cas shrugs, holding Dean’s cue out to him. “You’re always telling me to ‘loosen up’. If you win, I’ll remove my jacket, and if I win, you can remove your flannel. That sounds fair, doesn’t it?”
because for the first time in so long, there was nothing stopping him. “I’m

to believe Cas that wouldn’t go away.
Dean was stunned, but slowly nodded, backing on his heels until the backs of his legs hit the table’s edge, and Cas stepped ever so slightly closer to dust his lips with a tender kiss.
“Harry and Marv, that’s the, uh, the two assholes harassing him, right?” Dean asked, setting up a shot glass and glancing up at the screen.
Sam remembered. Cas had been on the receiving end of a curse, having taken the hit for Dean, and his brother had been a twitchy wreck for days.
He frowned, just a little, but tapped to open it, the screen’s soft glow casting over his face once the video quietly began to play.
stab you right between the ribs. Are we clear?”
stud,
“Yes.” Cas smiled, just enough of it peering out across his features that Sam caught it and mirrored it with a laughing grin of his own. “He was insistent on remaining asleep, as per usual.”
Sam looks between the two of them, the upwards twitch at the corner of his mouth betraying him. With an obligatory eye roll, he closes his book and sets it aside. “Alright. Fine, you win. You’re thinking about that bar down the street, right?”
Ain't no big deal, it's innoce-e-e-ent… (right?)
The only thing standing between you and a good time is this nagging defeatism of yours. I’m sure you’d be able to make tonight
Not now that he’s in control again.
Sam typed out beneath it, hitting send, and once it was done he tucked the device away. He smiled.

“Hey, Cas!” he called, waving the angel - now human, he reminded himself, but happy and
“No.”
Dean clenched his fist hard enough to make the knuckles pop, and the Mark sang against his forearm; whispering to him that this was right, that if he did this he'd be able to cut out every last shred of his weakness for good.
And those were the words that echoed in Dean’s mind when he woke up.
you need to get out. He’s— I’m gonna hurt you, I
Cas blinked, somehow feeling every fiber of the threat described. “I...do not doubt that,” he replied. “I think I will pass, thank you.”
“What are you doing here?” Sam says sharply.
he watches Cas do the same.
Cas sets his cue down on the table, giving Dean a look. “I strongly contest that, especially in your case, but you did win.” He shrugs his jacket off, maintaining eye contact with Dean the whole time, and tosses it to him. “Your prize.”
As if it realized it had the time, he could almost hear his ghostly doppelganger’s lazy, criticizing laugh rising to prod at the back of his mind.

“But you see,” Crowley says smugly, “as long as
“You’ve got it. Hey, Nina,” Dean called, craning his neck so he could be heard through the home’s downstairs. “I’m gonna pop out your vinyl and get some tunes going, alright? I’d better not turn around to find you contemplating sticking a knife in my side.”
Dean would never admit it, but in his free time — which he
he corrected himself.
Laur smiled, turning toward Dean. “Hey,” she said quietly, winking (though on her face the gesture was soft and innocent, where on another’s it might not have been so). “You look so, so happy, Dean. I’m beyond ecstatic for you.”
It was because of the voice that he couldn’t forget all the way, what it’d felt like to return. (Only he couldn’t remember which event had been coming back for him: becoming human, or being kissed by Hell with the soft croon of the Blade flowing beneath his hands). Before people are born, all they know is ether and shadow, eddying pulses and simple wants that barely amount to want at all. They’re shielded from the burdens of emotion and real choice, and that’s what demonhood was like for Dean. Because when you’re born, when life —
Crowley raises his hands in a gesture of surrender that’s somewhat diminished by the easy smirk on his face. “What, you think the king of Hell doesn’t take a night off every now and then? Job-related stress is no laughing matter.”
He thinks it over as he finishes his food, Crowley waiting expectantly. On one hand, this is the kinda thing that could really get him in trouble with Dean. They’ve finally recovered from the latest batch of Apocalypse-driven betrayals and lying, and Sam
Sam opens his mouth to refute that, grinning mischievously, when a shadow falls over his shoulder.
“Ah, Samuel,” a voice greeted after only a couple rings, the lilting accent from the other side of the line sounding very pleased with herself. “And to what do I owe the pleasure?”
The room quieted, and an apology was murmured as Dean settled his arm back over Cas’s shoulders, tugging the man who would always be his angel that much closer to his side.
Cas squinted, processing that idea, and Dean realized that he was still sitting on his bed, a gaping, empty expanse of rumpled sheets and blankets open to his right. So vulnerable. He shot to his feet, ignoring the way his face began to heat uncomfortably.
been enough.
shot, not his first.
gift, the only one that mattered, was right beside him on the way toward the door.

Sam smiled thinly, and then went up to his room, pulling out his phone and dialing a certain witch’s number without delay.
They began to walk once more, their fingers slowly threading together as fresh flakes of snow began to fall, and the sound of ornaments distantly twinkling together was indistinguishable from the feeling of happiness.
“I don't know how to stop, Cas,” he found himself admitting, in a whimper that trickled from his ragged throat sounding just as broken as the rest of him felt. “Why are you making this so hard? I don’t… I don't know how not to love you back.”
and toothy, roguish grin that screamed nothing but
“Sam, we have more than earned ourselves a little taste of sunset,” Dean said, shrugging off his jacket and falling back against the pillows to Charlie’s right. “Ain’t that right?”
Nina’s eyes widened, as if she couldn’t believe she’d never thought of that before. “Kamala, you
“No,” Cas said, soft but firm. “No cuffs. I know you won’t hurt anyone. But I am afraid you’re in danger of hurting yourself.” Then, unsure whether or not this would backfire horribly, he stepped closer, lowered himself to Dean’s side, and slowly tucked him into his arms.
For a few seconds, all was still and quiet. But then Dean realized he was still holding onto Cas’ arm, and slowly, almost carefully, he let it go.
Something nestled deep in his ribcage that sang of longing, in all the exquisitely painful ways that had once made Dean Winchester so weak.
that little bit further apart. “Take me to
“Yeah,” Dean whispered back, at last. “Yeah, Cas, I did.”
Before Cas could open his mouth in question, she’d swept her back to them, beginning to stir peppermint and grind cocoa with an artistry all her own.
kind of a miracle, and he
They’ll have to stop kissing at some point, Dean thinks absently, if they ever wanna get out of this parking lot.
he thinks with a wince. Cas is still looking at Crowley like he’s systematically running through every possible way he could kill or maim the demon in his head, and he’s barely touched his burger. Okay. So it might be time for an intervention.
Until then, we hope to see your thoughts in the comments, whether they be on the story or the music!
He’d been burning for years, ever since he first saw hellfire at the end of the tunnel and dove toward it headfirst. But up until now it’d been a burn like whiskey in the back of his throat, like the flames that had deadened all his nerve endings as they forged him into their twisted weapon of choice. Into a manifestation of the void he feared he was nothing without.
Dean scowled. He had nothing to say.
Cas saw it, and he reached up to cradle Dean’s jaw in his fingers, his grace slowly, fitfully beginning to flow between his hand and the afflicted soul in his arms. Dean gasped when he felt it, the light that told his dark corners to retreat, and his eyes widened when he realized what it was. “Cas, no, you— you don’t have the juice for that.”
, and this is a way to show that.”
Ryan gives them the aftercare instructions--how long to keep on the wrap, how to wash it and moisturize, all that fun stuff. Cas nods along the whole time, and types out the instructions on his phone. He keeps smiling and rubbing his hand over the front of his trenchcoat the whole time.
“Yeah, he’s three and he’s a little devil.” Dean snickers, and Cas shoots him the glare of someone whose heard that joke a million times and never liked it. Dean sticks his tongue out at Cas, but then continues, “Nah, though, he’s a great kid. Sweetest, bubbliest little thing. I don’t think there’s anyone or anything he wouldn’t try to be friends with.”
dean nods, once, looks off for a moment, rubs his chin, then nods again and starts getting undressed.
“It means I’ll draw the design right on your skin,” Ryan answers as she pulls out one of her markers. “Normally, I’d have a stencil drawn out that I’d then copy onto you, like a super temporary tattoo, and then I’d make the actual tattoo. With freehand, I just draw and then go.”
reaches, ever so slowly, letting cas (or himself) back out of the touch at any time, toward cas’s face. neither back out. he cups cas’s cheek.
this time, when dean hugs him tight, he is not pulled into dean’s chest, but dean pulls into his own and pats his back, firm, but softer than he used to.
he leans in close to his creation and picks it up, cupping it in both palms. it is dwarfed by his hands. it is so large, too large to be so small there in cas’s hands. this, his whole world, finally cast off his back and made small and light and controllable, fitting in his tiny vessel’s tiny fingers.
for a moment, it seems content to just sit in cas’s palms, warm and safe. even if cas chose to close his hands into fists, crush it into a mere pulp, it would be safe. cas would always, always bring it back, no matter what, even though for a moment he had feared he wouldn’t be able to. cas sags, just slightly, in his relief, and ever so delicately cups his creation to his chest in an embrace.
“Well, he-” Cas winces and sucks in a breath when Ryan goes back in with the needle, “he asked why I didn’t have ‘lines on my chest’ like Dean has, and we explained top surgery. But when we explained it’s a surgery trans men often have, he pointed out that I’m trans as well and still didn’t have any. And I realized I wanted to have them, to look trans I guess. I know there’s no universal appearance for trans men, but I couldn’t get the thought out of my head.”
She doesn’t like to assume cisness, generally, but if he’s asking for top surgery scar tattoos, that at least means he hasn’t actually had that surgery. Probably. Maybe the ones he had faded or something? But Ryan can’t get over the thought that it’s something else, like maybe this guy is some super specific, weird kind of chaser or something.
“Alright, well, first time for everything,” Dean points out, and Cas fondly laughs and rolls his eyes.
“Oh, so you’re calling us old?” Dean asks, mock outrage in his voice.
“Yeah, right back at ya,” Dean says with a blush, and then Cas kisses him on the cheek before going to get his clothes back out of the backpack.
Ryan laughs softly. “You sound like my parents.”
Cas nods and reaches out to squeeze Dean’s hand.
he does choke up, though, when he says, “today’s sammy’s birthday.”
“Dude, Sam and I got our anti- uh… our matching shoulder tattoos at the same time at some random small town tattoo parlor, no prior notice. I didn’t think this would be that complicated in comparison,” Dean replies.
there is a short-lived moment of calm before the door opens, and the light of the outside sends his creation running to the corner. cas wishes he could tuck himself away in the corner with it, small and unseen. the light shows too much of him, his tattered trenchcoat and his unshaven face, removes the shadows he pathetically hides his wings in and shows them in all their sublime brokenness, his hundreds of transcendent, oil-slick dark and disgusting feathers littering the dusty floor. it is not a sight for mortal or holy eyes, the battered soul of an angel. it is not something cas himself wants to see.
“I am not getting nipple piercings,” Cas says firmly, like it’s a conversation they’ve had before.
“you ready to stand up? i got one more thing to do.” dean murmurs into cas’s hair. cas nods the affirmative, and together, they begin the delicate process of getting up without slipping.
“You’ll have to hold my hand a lot more than this as I get my tattoos. I’ll need something to hold onto in the pain,” Cas says matter-of-factly.
1 PM on a Thursday, after all. She always allows walk-ins at this time, but it’s much more often her time just to hang in the shop and work on sketching for upcoming appointments.
There’s comfortable silence for a bit. Or at least, a comfortable not talking, since the tattoo gun makes silence basically impossible. Also, comfortable is a relative term when one of them is getting a tattoo. Cas is still handling it pretty well, but he’s definitely been gripping Dean’s had a bit tighter.
not that dean’s an optimist or anything, but he might just have a little hope. just for this. just for cas, and maybe for cas and him, together as… something, again.
he had thought he knew what it was to feel powerless, when he’d been held at knife point, down on his knees, looking up at death. but he was wrong; he had felt cornered then.
He still checks himself in the mirror after, obviously. As he stares, he reaches up one hand to reverently brush the purple lines, long ovals Ryan will line and fill in, on his chest. He looks like he’s seeing himself for the first time, even just with the sketch, and Ryan sees in him every trans guy she’s ever seen post-op. She sees herself the first time she’d pulled on a dress, the cute little skater dress she’d gotten when she was 12.
his creation strays close to cas. he reaches out and traps it under one finger, watching as it tries to squirm away, little legs erratically reaching for purchase and the strength to push back against cas’s finger. its antennae wave in the air like two arms reaching for a knife in the dark, like darting eyes looking for a way out.
dean gives cas an old blue grey shirt and green pants to wear until his old clothes are clean. the shirt is too big on cas, but that’s nothing new for him with the way the trenchcoat has always drowned him.
“They are,” Cas both agrees and asserts. “I’ve always been very fond of them. And now I’ll finally have some, too.” He sounds pleased at that, and his hand, held out of the way for Ryan to get access to his chest, gives a little flutter.
“Sam is going to make fun of us,” Cas points out.
“You were a good client. And not just because you have good pain tolerance, though that’s a plus.” Ryan stretches the wrap across Cas’s chest. “People come here and hit on me sometimes, or get annoyed at how long it takes, or the fact that it hurts. I’ve had people almost getting sick cause they didn’t eat beforehand. People suck sometimes, but this was nice. Good conversation. You’re cool. And so is Dean.”
“What does freehanding it mean, exactly?” Cas asks. “This is my first tattoo, so I’m not familiar with the terms.”
“Yeah, there’s all sorts of reasons people might feel like they need to reclaim their bodies,” Ryan answers, and it’s nice having the conversation back in a place she’s familiar with. “Queer people feel that way a lot. People with trauma, especially certain kinds of trauma. Disabled people, marginalized people, there’s a lot of reasons someone might feel disconnected from their body and want to make it their own again.”
dean comes back. cas is not good with the passage of time, so he has no idea how long he was gone, only knows that he is now back, and that the creak of the door as he opens it and the sunlight he certainly allowed in with him drives twinkie into the corner again. and then he is coming into the bathroom with cas and he has two bags in his hand, presumably food and whatever he needs to clean cas up.
“I used to be. Nowadays, I have faith in other things. Humanity. Feelings. My family,” Cas answers. “People rarely call me Castiel anymore, anyway. I’m Cas or Dad or Mr. Winchester. One friend called me Clarence.”
cas sits on his knees but does not kneel as his eyes track the erratic running of his creation on the floor around him. the skittering little thing had not started as his creation, of course—had been one of his father’s, just like every other wretched thing around—but castiel believed that after so many changes, so many times he had taken it and broken it and restitched it from the inside out, each time forming a new exoskeleton new antennae new wings new miniscule brain and miniscule heart, that yes, he could call himself its creator.
“Hey, no prob. I mean, it’s the job, you’re paying me to do it. I’m glad you like it, but no need to thank me,” she say. “Anyway, you’re not fully done yet, I’ve gotta put the tattoo wrap on, so go sit back down.”
“hey, cas, buddy,” he says, soft, a grin spreading over his face and shoulders relaxing. he puts one bag somewhere on the ground outside the door of the bathroom, then comes in fully and puts the other bag on the ground. takes out bottles and a sponge and a razor, places them in the shower.
“Alright.” Ryan nods, then goes about getting the rest of her stuff together; stuff to clean off Cas’s skin, a razor to shave off any hair in the way, gloves, her tattoo gun and black ink for the outline. In the sketch, the scars are colored red, so she pulls out some reds, oranges, and pinks as well, so she can figure out a good color with him.
Not to play into stereotypes or anything, but that name is one of the most convincing bits of evidence she’s seen that this guy is, in fact, trans.
“They are special scars, though,” Cas points out. “We didn’t have to tell Jack any sooner, of course, but I am glad he understands now.”
“He’s right though,” Ryan says. “This tattoo is gonna hurt, chest ones can be pretty rough.”
“I’m just glad Jack has had both of us, and Sam too, for his whole life. He’s had a family, however ‘out of order’ we are,” Cas says.
cas always preserves its memories when he brings it back. sometimes, it’ll resume what it had been doing before, as if nothing had happened. sometimes, it’ll rush around the room, frightened from the ordeal and being contained in this room with cas. sometimes, it’ll just sit still for a long while, so still that anyone else who couldn’t hear its heartbeat, who didn’t know it so well, would assume it had died. those times, cas knows it feels tired. powerless. unable to handle its life. it is still out of not knowing anything else to be.
something was, but not like dean had thought.
“We wanted to get the gender talk preemptively,” Cas says. “We’d hardly even thought about the surgery scars talk until he asked.”
“We should get matching cowboy tattoos,” Dean says excitedly to Cas. “We could get two little cowboy hats, or boots with spurs.
“cas, man, talk to me. please. it’s been-” dean chokes back something, trying to swallow down the tears and emotion that are spilling out of him right now. he doesn’t let go of cas, but he does square up his shoulders, make himself melt into the hug a bit less. toughens up. always putting on a show. “it’s been a long time since you’ve talked to me.”
briefly, he listens again for twinkie, and hears it very close. likely examining the bag of food dean brought. it’s doing fine.
“We’ve all got a lot of scars, me and my sibling even more than Cas here, so scars have kinda been an excepted part of existence for Jack,” Dean continues. “Besides, more important to make sure he knows he doesn’t have to listen to the shit the rest of the world might try to tell him about gender than that he knows what two of my, like, hundreds of scars mean.”
he’s fine, he knows this logically. he can still feel the vestiges of his grace glowing dimly in him, he knows his current surge of fear is not true and he has enough to bring his creation back, but the fear is nauseating and makes his hands tremble, so he brings it back to life quickly.
