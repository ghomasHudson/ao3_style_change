Sherlock only managed to catch the first splash of semen with his mouth, as John's cock slipped from between his lips, as he gasped in pleasure, when John bent his finger inside him and rubbed his clit between two fingers, at the same time. Sherlock barely registered the warm fluid that painted his cheeks and forehead, as he shuddered through another orgasm.
"Calm down, Sherlock." A gentle, but insistent hand pushed him back, until he was leaning against the headboard with a pillow behind his back. "I know that you were drugged."
"Fuck! God!" John groaned loudly, as Sherlock rubbed the head of his cock with his index and forefinger. His swearing intensified, when Sherlock slipped his hand in John's pants and started to rub his cock. It was a tight fit, with the fabric in the way and Sherlock couldn't find a way to relief the pressure ,that was building between his own legs. It was frustrating, but somehow also exciting in its own way.
Sherlock blinked up from his menu. "But you do. When we entered the restaurant, your eyes found the list with the wines, on the cardboard behind the bar, right away. You skipped over the white ones and your eyes lingered on a dry, red wine, for approximately one second. Therefore I ordered it." Sherlock finished his deductions with a flourish and then his face fell. "Was that wrong?" He knew that his deductions were correct, but the way John had told him, that he hadn't asked for wine, made Sherlock doubt himself.
“My, that’s quite cute,” Mrs Miller cued with false enthusiasm. “How much time it must have taken you to draw that bee and I can just see the kind of challenge, drawing the honeycomb, posed to you. They aren’t usually that uneven, are they?”
"That I am transgender." Sherlock fixed his eyes on the surface of the water. "Everyone will know. Not only the judges and the police, but the media will learn of it as well. It will be all over the internet in minutes and whenever someone hears of Sherlock Holmes after this, the first thing that will come to their minds will be, that I am transgender. No matter if they hate me for it or celebrate me for it, my gender identity will define me from this moment forward and... I don't want that."
Sherlock frowned at that and forced his eyes to stay open, until he had solved that mystery. "You have found other ways in the past few weeks."
"I was sick," Sherlock informed Donovan, as he swept past her in the lobby of the hotel. On any other day he would have pointed out to her how hypocritical it was of her to criticise him for not solving a case for them. After all, she was usually the most outspoken against him helping them with their police work.
“Oh, Mrs Hudson, it’s horrible.” Mrs Miller’s hands clenched around a white handkerchief. “Mr Andrew, Mr Taylor and his wife, they are all… they are all dead.”
Sherlock tried to turn his head away, but he was too weak and disoriented, to prevent her lips from claiming his own. She tasted of champagne, smoke and lipstick. Sherlock almost wished, he would faint from the revolting sensations, but instead he retreated into his Mind Palace, to retrace his steps, to find where he had gone wrong.
"You love me?" Sherlock blinked at John in astonishment. Mycroft only sighed loudly in his Mind Palace and was probably wringing his hands, because Sherlock was focusing on the least important part of John's confession. Least important for someone like his brother, but not for Sherlock.
"Ahem," John coughed slightly and Sherlock averted his eyes, as he noticed that he was still staring. "You should probably confirm, that this man was actually the killer, we were after or I might be in a lot of trouble. Not that I still won't be. I am not sure how the police will react, to what happened here tonight."
"Do you want pants?" Sherlock shook his head as he sat on the edge of his bed. "No, pyjama bottoms would be welcome though."
John's arm came around his middle when Sherlock made to get out of bed and an involuntary shudder ran through his body at the contact.
"God, I’m sorry." John's worried face was in front of him and then a woollen blanket was thrown over his shoulders, even as he was drawn against a warm body. "I shouldn't have said that. Not when you are in such a state."
“Really? I wouldn’t venture there, if it wasn’t an emergency. And even then,” Mrs Miller shook her head in disgust, “I would think twice about it. In our youth, it might have been a nice destination for an outing, but nowadays it’s been overrun by rabble.”
"And you didn't know him well enough, to conclude that he would still do it?" John's eyes grew hard as steel. "But if he baited the killer, in his own free time, then Scotland Yard wouldn't be at fault, right? Nice way to get rid of any responsibility, you might otherwise have had."
"No," Sherlock grabbed John's arm harder, as his lover made to get up. "I mean... I want to continue. I want to have sex with you, but... I just don't." Sherlock sighed in frustration and reached with his free hand down towards the waistband of his pants. He was being stupid. There was no need to behave like a blushing virgin, who had to protect his dignity by staying covered up.
“Now, don’t be so dramatic.” Martha shook her head with a gentle smile. “Our village is far from becoming a ghost town – like the ones, they have in America.”
"Hi there, Freak. Have you come to abandon another case?"
Sherlock happily lay down on the bed and snuggled his head into the pillow. They had only ever used the massage oil once so far, but Sherlock had certainly enjoyed the experience. The changing of the sheets the next day had been a different matter altogether though.
"No." It was an easy answer. Sherlock had expected John to massage him, but he certainly didn't mind if his lover wanted to kiss him first. No matter where John intended to put his lips.
"And you were just drugged, not twenty-four hours ago. You need rest." Sherlock opened his mouth to argue, but all that came out was a loud yawn. Great, now his body was betraying him as well.
"Your head seems to feel better."
"You know," John whispered with a cheeky grin as he laid down next to Sherlock on his side, "I could spend hours just kissing you." He underlined his words with a sound smack to Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock took a shaking, but it didn't do anything to calm him down. If anything, his panic only rose as he felt his chest constrict painfully, when he inhaled. Cold sweat was trickling down his back and his hands started to shake, where they lay useless in his lap. He couldn't do anything to stop this man. There was nothing in his reach, that he could use to defend himself and even if he had a knife at hand, Sherlock doubted. that it would be of any use. Not when he was still in pain and slightly disoriented.
Anderson huffed behind him. "So you want us to believe, that they were having tea with their murderer, before he killed them?"
"And you invaded Afghanistan," Sherlock couldn't help, but point out and they both dissolved into laughter. It only lasted, until Sherlock winced in pain though and grabbed his head. Laughing while concussed apparently wasn't a good idea.
“And you don’t have to, love.” Martha sighed happily at the sight of her boys kissing each other gently. She couldn’t be happier for them.
“Oh, don’t worry about them.” Martha smiled brightly at him. “They are all dead.”
Over the next couple of hours, Martha listened to her boys’ recollection of the last month. Her heart swelled with pride when John told her, that he had been made head of department at the local hospital and she squeezed Sherlock’s hand in excitement, when he described an especially complicated case, he had solved. She might not be their biological mother, but Martha doubted that she could have loved them any more if she was.
A sad smile ghosted over John's lips. "Yes, but are they welcome now?"
"Great," Sherlock all but beamed at his lover, "Then we can finally drink our tea... or what remains of it."
“What’s new in the village, Mrs Hudson?” John looked curiously at her, while Sherlock – bless his heart – did his outmost best to appear uninterested in the answer. “Oh, nothing much. Mrs Miller is her old, charming self, my bees are especially diligent this year and have produced the sweetest honey, so far and… Oh yes, Mrs Brown has died.”
tea, if Sherlock's memory wasn't falling him.
Sherlock's eyes swept to the two bodies. Judging from the damage that had been done to the heads and from the distance the gun had been fired, the bullets had probably been about nine millimetre in diameter. There were a few guns that used that ammunition, including the army issued SIGs. And the killer might very well have been a soldier or someone ex-military. Only two bullets had been fired and both had hit their marks right away. They had also been fired in close succession, so that the second victim hadn't even had the chance to react, before the second bullet had found its target.
The water had just boiled and the tea set to brew, when the shower was shut off. John had taken ten minutes longer to shower than usual. Another difference to his routine. And if Sherlock added the fact, that John was home much earlier than usual - three hours earlier to be precise - then there were already three discrepancies. He didn't get the chance, to wonder what that meant - if it meant anything at all - when the door to the bathroom opened and John stepped into the kitchen, a few seconds later. He was clad in his favourite dressing gown and his hair was still wet and sticking up in all directions.
How had this all gone so wrong? The question ghosted through Sherlock's head, even as he stumbled against a sideboard and sent a vase falling to the ground. The door, to the hotel room, seemed miles away, as he took an unsteady step while holding onto the wall for support. He needed to get out of here, before the drug knocked him out. If it had at least been something opiate based, Sherlock doubted that it would have such an effect on him. In the years, he had used drugs, he had built up quite a bit of resistance to them, but his body didn't have any defence against... date rape drugs.
"I am aroused." The words were out, before Sherlock could think twice about them and he slapped himself inwardly for it. He waited for John to tease him lightly that this was the whole purpose of what they were doing. As if Sherlock didn't already know that. And it wasn't that he was ashamed of how his body reacted to John, but that it would mean that he had to take his pants off soon and...
"What?" The dumpling slipped from in between John's chopsticks and landed in a sea of soya sauce on his plate.
"It's alright."  Despite his words, there was a tight note to John’s voice and Sherlock didn't dare reply, as he shuffled slowly to the bathroom with his lover's help.
"Deal and now..." Sherlock would later deny that he yelped in surprise, as John reversed their positions and he found himself tumbled on top of his smirking lover a second later. "I could really need a front massage." John winked at Sherlock as he held the massage oil out to him.
"If you want to go back to sleep, you should probably stop thinking so hard." A gentle finger smoothed over Sherlock's forehead.
Light blue eyes only blinked at him in confusion. "Let's just imagine for one second, that I’m the killer - which I’m not - then why shouldn't you be my type? You said yourself that his victims are young and handsome. You’re certainly both."
"You are ex-military, invalided home from Afghanistan or Iran. You had trouble adjusting to civilian life and you looked for something to pass the time. You were unable to find a job, as a doctor, so you decided that you would focus on what else you were good at: Shooting people."
"I should have put a bucket next to the bed, but at least this time it was your own floor." John's voice sounded detached and it sent a shiver down Sherlock's spine. If he hadn't feared, that moving would worsen the pain in his head, he would have curled up in a tight ball. As it was, the only option left to him was to avert his eyes as John approached.
"We shouldn't giggle," John reminded them, with a grin in his voice, "It's a crime scene."
"Why?" At that John looked up at Sherlock with a sad, but tender smile on his face. "Because I didn't want to draw you into this mess. I was already falling for you at that point and I couldn't go on hunting rapists, when I wanted to build a life with you. Besides," John's lips twisted into a weird grimace. "I assumed that you could easily catch such men and make sure that they would be locked up forever."
“Yes, I do, sometimes. So what?” Sherlock shrugged. “It’s not like we can ever move back, there. They made it damn clear, what they thought of us living together and I, for my part, don’t intend to go back to hiding who I’m, to make some bigots happy.”
John's eyes softened to a tender blue. He reached his hand towards Sherlock, but aborted the movement at the last second and let it fall in the space between them. "Of course, I love you."
"Harry... she was raped at seventeen by one of her presumed best friends." John ground his teeth together.
"What," Sherlock started as John licked a strip from one ribcage to the other. "Just mapping my way. Do you mind?"
“To bees.”
The promised update. Enjoy! :)
"That's it, Love," Sherlock heard John whisper, as his orgasm ebbed away and his lover nipped playfully at his inner thigh. His fingers didn't leave Sherlock's pants though. Instead a third finger from John's other hand snuck underneath the fabric, from the side and started to tease his slick opening, while the others kept on rubbing his clit.
“I’m sorry, dear,” Martha apologized, before Sherlock got the chance to open his mouth, “I don’t have any honey left. I gave it all away.”
Sherlock could have spent hours just holding and being held by John and kissing him, until their lips were raw and dry, if it hadn't been for their difference in height. It was exhausting to bend down to meet John's lips and Sherlock was certain that his lover didn't fancy a stiff neck the next day. "Let's take this to the bed." Somehow they made it the last couple of steps to their destination without any major injuries - Sherlock didn't count the bruise on his shin - and tumbled onto the bed.
I had a lot of fun writing this chapter. I hope you enjoy it, too. ^^
Revisiting the events of yesterday evening hadn't helped at all, to bring Sherlock closer to figuring out what was going on with John. He only knew that it meant something, that John was spending so much time away from the flat and that he hadn't wanted to sleep with him when Sherlock had initiated it.  There was something... Something niggling at his mind. He often got that feeling when the answer to a problem was hidden somewhere in his Mind Palace, but without him finding the way to its location. It was frustrating.
Sherlock couldn't recall how often he had come last night, only that his legs had been wobbly, by the time they had made it back to the bed, to sleep. He was fairly certain though, that John had come at least two times. It might have been three times, but Sherlock didn't know if he had come in the shower. Maybe his erection had just flagged due to the former exertion. Usually Sherlock could tell the difference easily, but his mind had been a little overwhelmed, last night.
“Oh, hello Mrs Hudson. What draws you out, in such poor weather?” If it hadn’t been for the curious gleam in her neighbour’s eyes, Martha could have almost believed the concern, that Mrs Miller was trying to convey.
The bell rang, just after Martha had sat down with a nice glass of sherry for the evening. With a sigh, she got up to open the door.
“As I said, admirable. Just be careful,” Mrs Miller leaned closer, to whisper into Martha’s ear, when the cab pulled up at the kerb, “they have
"God, we shouldn't giggle," John managed to get out after he had sobered again, but the happy gleam remained in his eyes.
"Lestrade," Sherlock deduced, in a split-second, as his mind came completely awake. There had to be an interesting case, if the DI came to the flat, at this time in the morning. One could only hope, that it was at least an eight, to keep the boredom at bay, whilst John was away, applying for a boring job.
Sherlock almost retched, at seeing the understanding smile on Lestrade's face, not to mention that they were talking about him, as if he wasn't in the room. Time to get hold of the conversation again and direct it, to the most important topic again: the case. But first: "John is my partner though, you aren't."
Sherlock grabbed the armrests of his chair in fury at the memory of the incident at the hotel, ten days ago. After that
"Okay." A puzzled frown appeared on the man's face, but was then replaced by a smile. "That's fine. It's all fine."
“Nothing could keep me from seeing you, boys.” Martha regarded them fondly and signalled the waiter that they were ready to order. “Now tell me, what’s new?”
Sherlock gaped at John. He had known of course that his lover had been angry at the police for leaving him alone, when he had played bait for the killer, but he hadn't been aware of the depths of this anger.
John chuckled and the mattress dipped, as he sat down and stroked a hand through Sherlock's curls. "Admit it, you didn't believe that I could even come up with fourteen different pet names."
"Sally, that's enough." Lestrade glared at his subordinate and then gestured for Sherlock to follow him to the room.
His own grin spread to John's face, even as his lover tried to look serious. "Yes, it was amazing how much smoother everything went, after you took over the stalking and planning part of the job. You really are a genius." A quiet giggle escaped John. "Listen to us. Other couples recall their first date when they shower together and we talk about killing people."
"And this was just as good, if not better." John turned his head far enough to peck Sherlock's lips with his own. "Maybe next time though you would like to wear a G-string. I missed playing with your plush arse."
"Only for you." Sherlock sniffed at John's hair one last time, before he reached for the shampoo and splashed a generous amount on top of his lover's head.
"Hold still." John didn't move a muscle, as Sherlock arranged them both to his liking, until his head was bedded on his lover's chest and his arm was around his shoulders. It wasn't the most comfortable position, but it allowed Sherlock to listen to John's heartbeat and breathe in his unique scent, which calmed his nerves, because his mind associated it with the safety of home.
A snort sounded over the earpiece. "You mean, it's going to end with you in my bed? Sounds great to me. Can we just skip this whole stalking a killer thing then and move directly to the good part?"
Sherlock didn't even try to hide the hurt at the betrayal from his lover. He had worried that John wasn't interested in him anymore and was only working so much to spend as little time with him as necessary and here... his lover had been planning a murder.
Sherlock clenched his hands into the sheets, to stop them from trembling. It wasn't the first time that someone had insulted him like this. It wasn't even the first time, that the insult had been a result of someone finding out that he was transgender. And yet, it had affected him more than ever.
Sherlock's rhythm faltered for a second, as he tasted around for the bottle and threw it in John's general direction. He had only just managed to established another rhythm - with the added bonus of his formerly free hand on John's balls - when it was interrupted again. This time by two oily fingers that had found their way under the waistband of his pants and started to rub his clit.
Sherlock considered his words for a second. He could call Lestrade and present him the murder suspect, but that would mean losing John and that was the last thing Sherlock wanted to happen. They had only met a little more than a month ago, but already Sherlock couldn't imagine life without his lover anymore. He suspected he would even miss the stupid pet names, that John tried to stick to him if he were to send his lover to prison.
A few seconds ticked by, until Sherlock's tired mind managed to inform him of what John meant by his words. When it did, shame flushed Sherlock's cheeks crimson. His lover was afraid to kiss him and touch him, because of what had happened to him.
“Let’s talk about something more joyful.” Martha gave both their hands a squeeze. “How is that nice, young woman, you told me about? Molly, right? You told me on the phone, that she just had a daughter? Are they both well?”
Instead of the expected, pinched expression – at the reminder of her defeat – Mrs Miller’s eyes grew sad. “Our dear Lydia won’t compete in any contests, ever again. She passed away, last night.”
John, who had remained completely silent, while Sherlock had relieved part of the horrible evening, seemed to come back to himself at the words.  "That's not a good idea. You might lose your balance and fall down." The words were matter of fact, but when Sherlock met John's eyes he saw a world of worry and pain reflected in them. And behind all of that was a simmering anger, that was held in check by his other emotions.
Sherlock sneered at the words of his brother. That was exactly, what the real Mycroft would say. He wouldn't understand, why Sherlock was dreading this conversation with John. In his mind everyone of lesser intellect wasn't of more importance than a goldfish. He would probably laugh at Sherlock, if he learned that his little brother was afraid of losing John and tell him that he was exchangeable. But that wasn't true. There was no one like John, Sherlock was certain of it and if he was to lose him on top of everything else that had happened today, then...
John's behaviour towards him at changed. Sherlock hadn't noticed it at first. He had been too busy working through all the annoying feelings that the sexual assault had brought up, to pay much attention to anything else.
“Mrs Miller, I hadn’t expected you at this time.” Martha added a hint of disapproval to her voice, although she doubted that her neighbour even noticed it, as distraught as she seemed. Her hair was in disarray and her coat didn’t match her shoes, which clearly reflected on her state of mind. “What happened?”
"Let's have tea," Sherlock agreed and John's shoulders sagged in relief.
Aftermath of a sexual assault
As far as Sherlock was concerned, everything that had needed to be said was out in the open now and they could resume their life. The only question was if John agreed with this assessment. Sherlock truly hoped that John wouldn't insist on feeling guilty for what he had done. Yes, one should probably feel guilty for killing someone, but... these were very special circumstances and Sherlock didn't want his lover to beat himself up over it.
Sherlock merely rolled his eyes at the statement. They kept telling him that he was dramatic, but Lestrade was even worse. "You could reduce your risk of heart attacks by eating less donuts and cutting back on your coffee consumption. I also see that you have taken up smoking again. I assure you, that's putting you more at risk for heart attack than seeing me in a sheet."
"Sick?" Donovan sneered as he followed him to the lifts. "You probably met up with some of your posh friends to snort cocaine, like all the good Cambridge boys."
Sherlock grinned, as Lestrade clenched his teeth in obvious annoyance, but didn't bother to fire back an insult. Coupled with the dark rings under the DI's eyes, his crumpled shirt and the new strands of grey in his hair, it was easy to deduce that the Yard was desperate for Sherlock's help. It had to be a good case then and probably a high profile one as well or Lestrade would have asked for his help much sooner.
"God, Sherlock," John gasped after what could have been seconds or minutes, "Come up here. I need to hold you."
, from time to time, I wouldn't mind." It hadn't been what he had first intended to say, but it was the truth nonetheless. The other conversation could wait, until they were both susceptive once more. Sherlock wasn't even certain that John had noted his earlier words, when his lover snuggled back against him and mumbled: "Goodnight, Love."
"What can you tell us, Sherlock?" Right, Sherlock blinked to clear his head from the odd mixture of feelings that were swirling through his mind and took in the crime scene.
Pain flickered over John's features, but then he nodded. "Alright, but you will have to take a bath, instead of a shower. It will be safer and... I would like to stay in the bathroom with you, if that's alright."
"You always stalked your...
Sherlock conceded the point to Mycroft, as the woman kneeled down next to him and took his face between her disgustingly warm hands. "Oh yes, I will have you for myself."
"What happened, Sherlock?" John looked almost frightened to hear the answer, even as he soldiered on. "I don't know if you remember, but you came home with a taxi. You didn't have any money on you and the driver was threatening to call the police, when Mrs. Hudson heard the tumult and called for me. You were drugged out of your mind."
Where to start? Sherlock bought himself some time by stuffing a whole dumpling into his mouth. He didn't want John to pity him, if he told him that the situation was almost overwhelming, because he wasn't used to dating. The few men he had been with certainly hadn't been interested in going out with him or if they did, they didn't call it a date. Of course, who would be crazy enough to date someone like him?
. It was served at the InterContinental to the victims and... you." Sherlock searched John's face for any signs of panic or fear at having been found out, but there was only amusement mirrored in his eyes as he met Sherlock's gaze.
She grabbed the hem of his trousers and shorts to pull them down and Sherlock knew that something was going to happen. He wasn't exactly sure why anymore, since it was getting harder to focus with every second, but something would happen. Cold air hit his genitals.
Sherlock frowned as he repeated the words in his mind, to figure out why they appeared to hold some special meaning, even as he started to examine the body. It was easy to deduce that the man was in fact the killer, they had been looking for, although Sherlock knew that the signs weren't obvious to anyone else. The police would have never believed that the man was the serial killer - not enough evidence - nor that John had needed to kill him. The way the man had closed his hand around his gun, in the pocket of his jacket, was enough for Sherlock to go on, but not for the idiots from Scotland Yard. He only couldn't figure out, why the killer had been about to deviate from his usual pattern. Usually, he only shot his victims after he had been through with them. So why... had he recognized Sherlock and decided it would be better to get rid of him or had he only wanted to threaten him with the gun, to make him comply?
Now, I'm really curious what you think, after reading this chapter. *bounces on her feet* Let me know if the twist came as a surprise or not. ;)
"Really, that's all you can tell us?" Anderson stepped up behind Sherlock and Lestrade. "Everyone can see that they had tea. It's not had to figure out."
"There is nothing to be ashamed of, Buttercup." Sherlock snorted at the ridiculous pet name, but let it go in favour of disagreeing with John.
So, he wanted to play dumb? Or did he just want to hear, how Sherlock had figured it out? How cliché, but maybe this would buy Sherlock enough time, to come up with a plan for escape... or Mycroft would locate his phone and safe him. At least owning his brother a favour, would be better than the alternative.
Blue eyes snapped up to his and Sherlock almost flinched away at the anger, that was swirling around in their depths. "They were rapists." The word dripped with disgust as John spit it out. "They were disgusting monsters, that needed to be stopped. Besides," Something dark flashed in John's eyes, "She dared to assault you. I swore to myself, that I would never let anyone get away with hurting someone I love, ever again."
A warm hand took his wrist and another one touched his forehead. Sherlock stared straight ahead, at the wall opposite him, while John took his pulse and temperature. He didn't want to see the disappointment and anger in his lover's eyes. This time, no one needed to tell Sherlock that he had screwed up royally, he was already aware of that. There had been so many ways in which he could have acted differently, to prevent this outcome, but he had been too vain to even consider them. Even though he should know better, Sherlock had still believed that he was infallibly. And what was the result? He had been drugged and assaulted and would have been raped if it hadn't been... if the woman hadn't...
“Hello Mrs Miller. I’m waiting for my cab, but the driver appears to be running late.” Martha just hoped that the cab would arrive in the next few minutes. She had been looking forward to this outing and she didn’t want to give Mrs Miller the chance to ruin it for her.
Sherlock frowned as he licked into John's mouth and earned a moan from his lover. Indeed, John tasted like tea and not like the cheap stuff they served at his surgery, but like a much more expensive brew.
"You didn't even ask me, if I wanted to have wine,” John scolded him, with gentle amusement.
"Are you lost in your Mind Palace again?" A retort was ready on Sherlock's tongue, when he noticed the soft smile on John's face. He wasn't mocking Sherlock, but was truly interested in the answer. The realisation was unsettling.
"Sleep well, Cuddle Bug." Sherlock only managed to smile against John's shirt, when his voice rumbled in his ear ,before his eyes fell shut. Tomorrow, he would forbid John to call him every stupid pet name under the sun, but for now it was kind of... nice.
"It's stupid," Sherlock muttered, but turned his head towards John, to peek at his lover with one eye. "I don't want to... take off my pants. I know it's absolutely irrational and that you have seen me without them before and..."
"He was the killer," Sherlock announced and clambered, as elegantly as possible, back to his feet. "And of course, you won't go to prison."
"Lestrade."
It hurt. This was the first thought that flowed through Sherlock's mind, as he swam back to consciousness. His head was pounding. His throat felt raw and sore. There was an empty pain in his stomach and worst of all, his brain felt like it had been flooded with syrup. Every step he took in his Mind Palace appeared to take hours, as disconnected images were projected on the walls of it. The disapproving look on the face of a concierge. Moving images of London's streets. The irritated voice of a man. The knocker of 221 Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson's worried face. Angry blue eyes. The interior of their flat and then... nothing.
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully. When he had first got the idea to how they could work together, he hadn't even dared to dream, that it would be so... perfect. Especially not after John had at first refused to even consider it. Thankfully, it had only taken until reports about attacks at the park had made the rounds, for John to give in.
"Such a beautiful thing! I will ride you till you scream." Valentine's hands moved to his zipper. "Maybe I will use some of Michael's toys on you afterwards. I am sure, I can keep you for some time, before you are missed."
they!
Sherlock put his head back on the pillow and allowed his body to relax as John's mouth found its way down his spine, only to lick a long strip back up again. Goosebumps broke out all over Sherlock's body and a content sigh fell from his lips as John took a moment to suck on his earlobe before kissing his way back down. He pressed a kiss to each clothed cheek and then - to Sherlock's surprise - spent a long time exploring each of his legs with his lips as well.
"How?" Sherlock hated himself for his need to question John further, when the situation was playing out in his favour, but his curiosity had always been strong. He didn't doubt that John could recognize when someone was on drugs, but he somehow doubted that his lover could tell from merely looking at him, if they had been taken willingly or not. "You promised me you would stay clean."
"You didn't have him," John tipped a finger against his chest, "But he had you. If I hadn't been around, to drive him off, you would be dead by now... or maybe he would like you so much, that he would keep you around, to fuck a little longer."
“Oh good Lord,” Martha pressed a hand to her mouth to hide her expression, “I just saw her on Monday, for tea. She always enjoyed her cucumber sandwiches so much. How did it happen?”
"It will also be extremely hot." John smirked down at him. "You can of course touch me under my pants as well, if you like."
"I have an interview, at a nearby surgery today. I told you about it yesterday." Some snippets about such a conversation flickered through Sherlock's mind. He must have dismissed it as unimportant, at the time or he would have remembered it. Stupid, because it was very important, if John started to spend time at a dull job and wouldn't be able to help him out on all of his cases anymore.
“Speaking of the devil,” Martha muttered to herself, but plastered a smile on her face, before turning around to greet one of her neighbours. “Mrs Miller, what a pleasant surprise.”
Sherlock merely managed to nod, as his throat constricted painfully. When he had made his offer, he had assumed that they would share a bedroom. They were dating after all or... weren't they? Certainly John hadn't changed his mind so fast. Then again, he had said that they were dating, before Sherlock had put his foot into his mouth. Therefore, it would only be understandable, if John had re-considered.
"God, you're absolutely stunning." A light blush stained Sherlock's cheeks at John's praise, as the eyes of his lover roamed all over his body. Or at least, the parts that weren't covered by fabric.
"Hey, careful," John protested half-heartedly, as Sherlock swung him around and started to massage his scalp.
"Sorry." Sherlock ducked his head, his face flushed in shame. There was no reason for such a reaction when John touched him. John was his lover and he wouldn't hurt him. Never. Sherlock knew that and yet...
“Thankfully, it’s just a trip to the city.” There was no need to clarify which city, she meant. After all, there was only one bigger town nearby, that deserved that description.
"What?! No, Sherlock!" John looked utterly shocked and he finally reached over to put the mug on the table and then clasped Sherlock's hand in both of his. "I could never find you repulsive. You are the most amazing man, I have ever met. You are smart, witty, downright handsome and just the right amount of crazy, on top of it. Not taking you up on your offer to sleep with you the other day, was one of the hardest decisions I ever made. Please, believe me."
Martha ignored the jibe and smiled even more brightly at her neighbour. “Oh you know, one can’t pass up the chance of a walk in such nice weather. They say, it’ll stay so sunny for a few days, but we all know how unpredictable the weather can be.”
Mycroft pointed out to him.
"You are such a romantic." John stepped closer in the ring of Sherlock's arms, until their wet bodies were pressed together.
“It’s a blessing to have such vigilant neighbours,” Martha noted absently.
That sounded reasonable. Sherlock took a sip of his wine, but barely managed to place the glass back on the table, without accident, as he recalled where their conversation had left off. "Are we on a date?"
"You are very eager, aren't you?" Sherlock couldn't tell if Valentine really believed this nonsense or if she was merely mocking him. It didn't matter in the end, as she straddled him and tore at the buttons of his shirt. Time seemed to skip and her hands were caressing his bare chest a second later.
“Sherlock, John,” Martha threw the door open, before either of her boys had the chance to ring the bell, “come on in.” She ushered them into her house and into the living-room. “Tea will be ready in five.”
“It was time-sensitive,” Sherlock huffed, but his expression softened as he leaned down to kiss Martha’s cheek. “I’m glad you could make it, Mrs Hudson.”
Sherlock blinked in disbelief at his lover. He had been sure that John would be thrilled by the suggestion of rimming. After all, he loved it when Sherlock spent hours worshipping his arse, so why would he react like this now?
"I won't be," Sherlock assured John, with more certainty than he himself felt. There was no way he could tell, how his body was going to react to John's presence. Still, Sherlock would be damned if he allowed this woman to come between John and him. He had only just found his Watson and he wasn't going to lose him over something like that.
"Let's go to bed," he whispered against John's lips as they parted breathlessly. And if Sherlock's heart picked up its pace on their way to the bedroom, he attributed it to anticipation and arousal.
John snorted, but turned in Sherlock's arms to look up at him amusedly. "That's not what you said yesterday."
Sherlock's eyes were drawn to the outline of John's cock which was visible through the dark fabric of his pants. He wanted to ask his lover to take his pants off, so that he could touch him, but he refrained from it. John might ask the same of him then and Sherlock... just wasn't ready for that yet. He hated himself for feeling so insecure about a part of his body, that he had come to accept years ago, but... it couldn't be helped. Hopefully he would overcome said insecurity in the next hour, so as not to disappoint his lover.
Sherlock frowned and had to bit his cheek, to keep from wincing, as the movement sent a jolt of pain through his head.
"Sherlock?" John stroked the back of his hand gently with his finger. "Did I say something wrong? Oh God," John's eyes widened in panic, "I just assumed that you would want to kiss me. I didn't even ask if that's something you enjoy."
,” Sherlock corrected her, with an odd note to his voice and followed her into the living-room.
“Oh, I do. Don’t you worry about me, I know everything about it.” With one last, forced smile, Martha slammed the door of the cab shut, but only relaxed when they were out of Mrs Miller’s sight. Good Lord, but that woman was getting on her nerves.
"Like flatmates?" Even Sherlock recognized the disappointment in John's voice for what it was and hurried to reassure him. "No, more like friends or... partners." There was a hopeful note in his voice, that Sherlock doubted went unnoticed.
Long manicured fingers stroked his cheek and through his curls and Sherlock felt like gagging. Stupid. He had been so stupid, to stumble into this trap.
John's eyes widened comically at the announcement. "I just told you that I killed enough people to be considered a serial killer."
A blush crept into John's cheeks, but he held his head high as he met Sherlock's eyes. "I am not as good with words as you are, but I want to show you with my body how dear you are to me. I understand if you don't want to and I won't pressure you, but... it would mean a lot to me... that's to say I..."
“Ah, I envy you.” Mrs Miller straightened her hat, with a meaningful look at Martha’s bare head. “It must be nice to have time for a pleasure walk. I wish I could just walk aimlessly around town, without having to worry about the flower arrangements for our church or everyone’s contribution for the spring festival.”
"I had him," Sherlock snarled back and bit down on his tongue, when his head gave a painful throb.
The last of the tension, that Sherlock hadn't even been aware of, dissolved at John's words. His lover wouldn't hold it against him, if Sherlock needed some more time, until he was comfortable enough to let himself be seen completely naked by John, again. Hopefully though, John's consideration wouldn't be necessary, since Sherlock felt perfectly comfortable while cuddling naked with his lover. And if it was, then Sherlock was still positive that it wouldn't be necessary for long. As long as John and he worked together they could overcome every obstacle. That thought sparked another idea and Sherlock's eyes snapped open, when they had just been about to close. "John."
“Old people die,” Martha shrugged. “But don’t worry, I feel just fine, although I wouldn’t refuse some help in the kitchen.” Martha wasn’t surprised when Sherlock followed her into the kitchen, after he had convinced John to sit down. She would have been disappointed, if he hadn’t come.
John didn't deny the accusation. Neither did he pale or try to run, but he merely sighed and nodded in confirmation. "I should have known that you would figure it out. What gave me away?"
Mycroft pointed out, from behind his desk in his Mind Palace, before Sherlock could open his mouth,
"Are you still brooding, Sherlock?" Mrs. Hudson clicked her tongue in displeasure. "You know you will get wrinkles if you don't stop that." Sherlock refrained from informing their landlady that this wasn't how wrinkles came to be. He also didn't point out to her that he wasn't brooding but rather doing some heavy thinking here. Something that would be much easier if Mrs. Hudson would stop trying to clean their flat... or whatever it was that she deemed necessary to do.
"To The Intercontinental," Sherlock informed the driver, the second a taxi pulled up to the kerb and jumped in. Sherlock wasn't sure what all of this meant, but he was determined to figure it out.
"Better," Sherlock admitted to his own surprise. The throbbing in his head had been reduced to a manageable level and the gears in his mind started to turn again. "This wasn't just Ibuprofen you gave me."
"You freak! You fucking freak! You tempted me!" The shrieking tone of the voice tore through Sherlock's head. "Get out! You disgusting Thing! Get out!"
"What the fuck?"
"Next time," John promised with a peck to Sherlock's lips and then sat up on the bed to reach for the drawer.
It took a second for Sherlock to understand how exactly his lover meant that statement, but when he did he was all too eager to comply. Never mind, that his face flushed a crimson colour as he held his clothed crotch close to John's face and brought his own mouth up to the throbbing erection of his lover. Strong hands grabbed his thighs and drew him even further up. Warm breath hit his most private place and Sherlock bit down on his tongue, to suppress a surprised yelp as John's nose and mouth pressed against his pants. God, but John was all but mouthing him through the fabric. A shudder ran through Sherlock's body. This felt forbidden and thrilling. He spread his thighs wider, to allow his lover easier access, before he focused back on his own price. The head of John's penis was flushed red. The foreskin completely retraced. And even without touching it, Sherlock could see clearly from the outline in John's pants, just how hard he was. His mouth watered and he was fast to dribble some more oil onto his hands before he reached into John's pants and closed his fist around his cock. A groan from above sent a shiver through Sherlock's body, as John rubbed his nose against the damp fabric of his own pants.
Sherlock winced, as the words fell down between them. He waited for John to laugh at him, for such a stupid assumption. Or worse, for his newfound friend to get angry and proclaim, that he was straight and not interested in men. It would only be more hurtful, if John announced that while he was into men, he wasn't interested in Sherlock, because he was transgender. Not that John wouldn't find more reasons, that spoke against being with Sherlock, but this one sounded the most likeliest. After all, his friend hadn't heard him torturing on his violin, in the middle of the night yet.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose even as he leaned down to steal a kiss from John's wet lips. "Yesterday you smelled of vomit and sick people. Not a very attractive smell."
Seconds ticked by in silence, as Sherlock allowed himself to relax and the water to wash away the memory of unwelcome touches. Only the dripping of the tap interrupted the silence. The soothing rhythm lulled Sherlock and made his mind drift off. Later he blamed the words that fell from his lips on that sensation. "I won't continue to work on the case."
"I just got up," Sherlock protested, when John took a towel and started to rub his curls, to speed up their drying process.
, while they were both preparing for a long night of fantastic sex, after his lover had successfully killed another man. Life was strange, but Sherlock couldn't be happier with how it had turned out for him.
Sherlock almost asked why they were still working on that case, before he bit his tongue as he remembered that the police didn't know about the dead suspect. They couldn't close the case, because Mycroft had made sure that there was no evidence left of what had happened to the murderer. Obviously though, Sherlock had been wrong when he had deduced that one and the same man had been responsible for all the crimes committed. Either that or the forensics had made a mistake, which was too farfetched an assumption. Nevertheless, the case sounded intriguing if only for the weapon that had been used.
Sherlock groaned inwardly, when Lestrade's eyes snapped to him and narrowed. Great, now Lestrade would feel it necessary, to berate him for his behaviour and force him, to talk the police through his every step, when they were working on the next case, together. He should have told John, to keep their true first meeting a secret. At least he hadn't mentioned how Sherlock had believed, that John had been the killer. That would have been embarrassing.
“Oh, of course not, don’t be silly, my dear.” Martha patted his cheek fondly. “You can also look at some of the houses, here. The one across the street is for sale and I think it would be perfect for you.” Martha glanced critically at the sandwiches and wondered if she should make some more with cucumbers. “And I think the one down the street would be perfect for Molly, it has a large garden for her daughter to play in and Irene and her girlfriend could…”
"Right." John sounded sceptical and Sherlock sighed. "You don't have to stay, John. I understand, if you would rather go somewhere warm and..."
"Then that's settled." John took a sip of his wine and Sherlock found his gaze drawn to his lips. Would he get to kiss them tonight? They had agreed that they were on a date and kissing was an essential part of dating, as far as Sherlock knew.
Sherlock blinked slowly. John's summary of the events fit together with the images, that had flickered through his Mind Palace. The last part of John's statement rattled him though and it took him a second to understand why panic was rising anew in him. When he did though, Sherlock grabbed John's hand and almost fell out of bed, in his haste to lean towards his lover. "I didn't take drugs... not willingly, I mean. I am clean. I swear I..."
Sherlock snorted. "No, he is the Detective Inspector, I mostly work with." He looked at the phone again, to make sure that Lestrade had got his message, before he met the stranger's blue eyes. "I’m sorry."
Sherlock mumbled in protest at the pedestrian endearment and kept his eyes closed. He had told John right away, that he didn't like pet names, which obviously had been a mistake. Now it seemed as though his lover was set on finding the one endearment, that Sherlock wouldn't hate. It was a complete waste of time, as Sherlock had told him numerous times, but his words had fallen on deaf ears. Obviously John was as stubborn as Sherlock was brilliant, therefore he would have to endure a new pet name each day forever... or until John's vocabulary ran out.
"I don't think that your own marriage is a good example," Sherlock remarked drily. "And if there isn't anything else you wanted, I have to think." Mrs. Hudson shook her head at him in disapproval and muttered something about his parents having a lot to answer for but thankfully left the flat.
“That would be lovely, my dear.” Martha patted John’s hand and then turned towards Sherlock, who still looked equal parts shocked and impressed. She would ask him later, which flowers would be best to replace her rhododendrons. For now though, she would simply enjoy tea with her family.
“Would you like to order something else?” The young waiter smiled politely at Martha, who declined with a headshake. “Not yet, my boys will be here soon. We’ll order then.”
Mycroft sounded as annoyed as he would be in real. Sherlock sighed. He hadn't been able to answer this question completely until last night.
“Oh Sherlock, my dear boy.” Martha sniffed and squeezed his hand on top of the table. “Let’s just wait and see, some things have a way of resolving themselves.”
"I did cocaine for years."
God, but Sherlock really needed to find a way to lock the door to Mycroft's wing, in his Mind Palace. The manifestation of his brother always became more annoying, when Sherlock didn't have the strength to ignore him.
"Bloody hell!" The light caught in the silver strands of Lestrade's hair, when he shook his head. "You mean you really are together? Not just as flatmates or friends, I mean, but you are..."
“True, but you won’t either. What?” Sherlock threw an incredulous look at John, who had probably kicked him under the table. “It’s just the truth and it’s – statistically speaking – unlikely that Mrs Hudson will outlive all of them. As much as I love that village, it wouldn’t mean anything to live there again, if she wasn’t with us.”
“Oh dear!” Martha’s eyes widened at the news. “That’s horrible, but how… No, where are my manners? Please, come in and sit down.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest such an absurd statement but closed it again with a snap when he couldn't come up with a good counter. The truth was that even when John was at home he wasn't inclined to spend much time with Sherlock. Oh, they still ate dinner together and watched a movie afterwards but it still felt like something was between them all the time. It wasn't like it had been...
Sherlock wasn't sure how it happened, but he must have somehow managed to get to his feet and stumble out of the room, because he found himself back in the corridor. He glanced down at himself. His trousers were up again and his shirt was partly buttoned. There was no recollection of how he had got re-dressed. Considering the state Valentine had been in, Sherlock had probably dressed himself, but he wasn't sure. Frankly, he didn't even care. Not now, when all he wanted to do was to get to John. Sherlock only needed to make his way back to Baker Street. He clenched his teeth and took the first stumbling step, on his long way home.
"Why not?" Sherlock wiped his eyes with his free hand. "We have just discussed a serious topic and now everything is right between us again... right?"
at the pub." John didn't have to elaborate that he was referring to the rapist of his sister. "It was a school reunion and there he was... Laughing and joking around. Flirting with women, who didn't know what a monster he was."
"I am not sure that still qualifies as washing." Sherlock smirked at how breathless John sounded and pushed just the tip of his index finger inside, to provoke a moan from his lover. "It most certainly does. I have something planned after all." He crouched down behind John to press an open mouth kiss to his right cheek to make his intentions clear.
"How the fuck did you convince me, that this was a good idea?" The tiny voice of John complained, through his earpiece and Sherlock grinned. "I am just very persuasive." He leaned back, against the tree, he had decided was a good spot for tonight's work and pretended, that he was scrolling through his phone. For a casual observer, he would look like a bored young man, who wasn't paying attention to his surroundings. The perfect target for the killer.
They were seated in a secluded corner of the restaurant and Sherlock ordered them a bottle of wine and one of water, before they were left alone to study the menus.
A surprised chuckle fell from John's lips. "That's what's keeping you up? Three times, but don't expect this to become a habit. I am still exhausted from it."
A door started to rattle in his Mind Palace and before Sherlock could decide if he wanted to investigate what was behind it, it sprang open. There it was: John's room. For a second Sherlock couldn't see a difference, to the way it had looked before - the tapestry and the curtains still looked the same to him - but then he noticed all the tiny details, that had been added. His gun was no longer hidden between his jumpers, but lay prominently on top of his bed. Next to it were John's army fatigues and his dog tags. A cup of fine chinaware set on his nightstand. Sherlock didn't need to get closer, to know which tea it was filled with. Just like he didn't need to check the gun, to know that it was an army issued SIG. He had seen it before - of course - when John had shot the killer in the park, but somehow he hadn't made the connection back then. The truth had been hidden in his Mind Palace all along. Hidden away by himself from himself, until he was ready to face the truth. Honestly though, Sherlock didn't know if he was ready, but he was aware of it now and there was no way, that he would be able to delete that knowledge.
Mycroft's exasperated voice sounded in his head.
then," John murmured, from somewhere next to the bed, because he obviously believed that Sherlock had spoken to him. "What about..."
That was exactly, what had found its way into his body, although Sherlock couldn't say for sure, what drug it had been exactly. The options were numerous. He couldn't even tell from his symptoms - disorientation, nausea, trouble seeing clearly - what he had been given.
"Awake, I see."
"So, a woman..."
John snorted in amusement, at that. "I’m not sure, that you can decide that. Even if I won't be convicted, the police will certainly take me into custody. I just killed a man after all."
"Time to get you back to bed, Snuggle Bunny." John announced with mock cheerfulness.
Sherlock winced at the loud exclamation, but continued his explanations. "You have killed twelve men in total, four of which you raped before blowing their heads off. I just haven't figured out why you did that. Is it for sexual satisfaction? Wasn't killing them enough anymore? Is that why you switched from targeting totally average men to young and handsome ones? I would really like to know, before..." Sherlock stopped midsentence. He couldn't finish his own thoughts. He had always told everyone that his body was only transport for him, but it wasn't true. At least not when it came to
Mycroft informed him in a bored voice,
Sherlock took a carefully controlled breath. There was no way, that he was going to continue work on this case. If it had only been a matter of a suspect trying to murder him, he would have been eager to chase them down, but not this time. His whole body was still crawling from the touches of phantom fingers and he felt on the brink of freaking out, when he so much as thought about red lipstick. It wouldn't be too hard, to come up with an excuse for Lestrade, but Sherlock didn't know how he should explain this to John. His lover had so high morals that Sherlock doubted he would take kindly to Sherlock abandoning a case like this.
"It's either in the bathroom, because the killer cleaned it of any evidence or he took it with him to clean it somewhere else and dispose of it later. I assume the latter. Our man wouldn't risk leaving any evidence behind, just because he was in a hurry to get out."
Soon Sherlock found himself climbing rapidly to a new height. This time though he wanted John to come first. Sucking on the head of his cock, as hard as possible and pumping him as fast as he could, while pressing the tip of his finger inside him, did the trick. John bucked up into Sherlock's mouth. His balls drew up against his body. His cock hardened in Sherlock's hand and then... he was coming.
The annoying voice of his brother was probably right about that. Any sane person would worry about having their lover exposed as a murderer, but Sherlock... Well,
"Well," Lestrade's voice sounded subdued even over the phone, "It's the same weapon that was used to kill the first few guys, but not the ones that were raped. Our forensic team just figured that out."
"God yes," John moaned at the sensation and pressed closer to Sherlock's mouth. It had the added effect of rubbing his erection against Sherlock's crotch, as he bucked his hips upwards at the same time. Sherlock felt a new rush of arousal pulsing through his lower body at the obvious proof of John's desire for him. He kept on sucking first one and then the other nipple, while grinding down against his lover. The dampness in his own pants spread and when he glanced down the lengths of their bodies, he noticed a wet spot on the front of John's own underwear as well. John had been right it was rather exciting, continuing with parts of their clothing still on.
Sherlock blinked. "That's ridiculous."
"Hey there," John's gentle voice put an end to Sherlock's self-reproaches. "I am not blaming you, for not catching them. It's just," John sighed heavily. "When you told me why you didn't want to go to the police, I realised again why it was so hard to convict such people. It's not only that the victims are often too ashamed to go to the police, but also that most rapists don't get the sentence they deserve. They either go free or they get a couple of years, tops. It's damn rare to see them locked up behind bars for more than five years. And when you told me that these bastards were rich, I knew that they would never be convicted so I... shot them."
John's shoulders stiffened at the question, but when he turned around his eyes were bare of any accusations. "I am not angry at you, Sherlock." Blue eyes looked openly at Sherlock and their owner shook his head. "I am angry, that you are right that almost everyone would define you by your gender identity, if they learned that you are transgender. I hate this and I despise these monsters, that forced you in this corner." Something dangerous flashed in John's eyes, but it was gone a blink later. "I will never hold it against you, that you want to protect yourself first. Don't ever think that." A tension, that Sherlock hadn't even been aware of left his body, at John's sincere words and he almost slumped against the washbasin.
John shrugged. "Some people don't like kissing or sex or touching in general."
For a long second, Martha entertained the idea of pouring the contents of another jar directly onto Mrs Miller’s terrible, brown hat. The look of utter horror on her face would have almost made up for the waste of such perfectly made honey. Luckily for her neighbour though, Martha wasn’t one for such petty revenge. “If you use that honey for the next
“Where are you going, my dear? I hope it’s not another doctor’s appointment.” If Martha didn’t know her neighbour so well, she would have even bought her false concern.
"You shot him." John managed to nod and shake his head at the same time. "Not right away. I didn't have my gun with me. I met sure to meet him in the men's room and pretended to know him. He was drunk already and he didn't get suspicious when I invited him to come with me, to meet up with some
"Someone seems worried about you. Your lover?" Sherlock blinked up in confusion, even as he sent off a text to the DI, to locate his phone and collect him. "Who?"
Sherlock shook his head. Not that he could deny the logic behind such a statement, but he had believed that he had deleted all this psychological nonsense years ago. Obviously though, it was still hidden somewhere in his Mind Palace. He would have to take the time to search and delete the information but not now. Now, he needed something else. "I have to take a shower."
do it." Sherlock sprawled his hands over John's ribcage and nuzzled his wet hair with his nose. "I like how you smell when you get back home, after your work for the day is done."
Sherlock accepted the information with a nod, but didn't find it in him to say anything else and John continued.  "So I know that you were after a rapist and I know that you were drugged and," he gulped painfully, but carried on, "obviously someone undressed you... Touched you. Did... did he rape you?"
"Let's have some tea and I will explain everything to you... if you don't want to call the police right away, that's it." The first hint of insecurity and fear passed over John's features.
"I found your business cards, when I went through the pockets of your coat.
Sherlock met John's sincere eyes and relaxed when he couldn't detect any lie hidden in them. Still there was one other thing that needed questioning. "If you felt like you couldn't sleep with me, before you killed someone what would you have done if I hadn't figured out what you did today?"
"That's sick." John's words echoed Sherlock's own thoughts, but he still didn't look up and only mourned the loss of contact, when the hand fell from his shoulder. A second later the hand was back though. "Tip your head back and close your eyes. I am going to wash your hair, Muffin."
"Nothing to say to that, Freak. I am right, aren't I?" Sherlock huffed an annoyed breath, as he left the elevator with Donovan on his heels. "Firstly, I went to Oxford not Cambridge. Secondly, I prefer to administer drugs intravenously to destroying my nasal glands and thirdly," Sherlock smirked at the Sergeant, "Anderson has a date with his wife tonight. You could have left the condoms at home, if you don't intend to use them with someone else, that's it."
you found is of any worth whatsoever." Sherlock pushed himself away from the wall and walked into the room. It was helpful that it looked much different than the last time he had been here. The place wasn't only swarmed by forensic technicians and police officers, but there were also splatters of blood and brain tissues on the wall, the ceiling and the floor. At last Sherlock's eyes fell on the two bodies. They had obviously been sitting on the couch, when they had been shot. Michael's body was sprawled partly on the cushions, while Mary’s had fallen to the floor, after her brain had been blown out. Relief washed through Sherlock at the sight of her destroyed face and his body relaxed a little at the visual confirmation that she was truly dead. He didn't have to fear exposure from her anymore and he could also be sure that she would never get to assault anyone ever again. The same applied to her brother.
Mycroft pointed out the obvious and Sherlock scoffed at that. John was only here today, because he believed that Sherlock couldn't look after himself. He had even said so himself and not just right now.
He blinked rapidly. His mind was working as fast as possible, to figure out what had just happened, while he had been wandering through his Mind Palace. Absolutely stupid, Sherlock scolded himself, as he looked at the man lying on the ground, only a few feet away from him. Shot to the neck, still alive, but approximately dead in the next thirty seconds.
