“Halfway there.” Tony hummed, wondering why a group of flying dinosaurs were harder to take down than he’d imagined. He snorted, giving the offending creature a kick to the stomach.
“I’ve always thought he was a nice guy myself.” Steve said sarcastically, earning a laugh from Clint as he held out his arms to take one of the buckets.
“Damn it!” Steve cursed, trying his best to reach under the seat and retrieve it. Through all the movement and panic, Peter was on it too, but to no avail, the phone was lost.
“There he is, our born leader!” Tony grinned, firing at another Pterodactyl, and ducking as one flew right over him. “Bastard!”
Bruce rolled his eyes, tucking said clipboard under his arm. “Anyway, do you remember what you have to tell them?”
“You’re right,” Tony nodded, putting a supportive arm around Steve to keep him steady. “Yeah, you’re right. It has to go.”
“She won’t let you.” Steve said confidently. “She’s nothing like you, she takes her job seriously, and actually cares about the employees.”
“It’s not.” Steve said, surprising Tony by taking his hand. “It was their choice to go, not yours, don’t do this to yourself.”
Wade clapped his hands together and howled loudly. Passengers turned to look at him, Peter hid his face behind his hands whilst Wade gave them all a little wave and a big grin.
Steve put a hand to his heart, feeling his chest start to hurt. “I know that now.” Steve chuckled, turning his head to Bobby who was leaning against the cage looking like he’d seen a ghost. “You okay, Bobby?”
Everyone froze. From somewhere nearby a tree fell to the ground, followed by branches snapping, leaves rustling. There soon came a resounding bang once more, one after the other, trembling the ground underneath their feet like an earthquake. They didn’t need to see what it was, they knew exactly what it was, and they weren’t going to wait around to find out.
Bruce groaned, knowing exactly what he was going to say. “The cuttlefish can change colour of its skin.” He said to Tony, who by now was confused. All the dinosaur lingo was starting to make his head spin. “It can blend into its surroundings, be invisible if it wanted.”
Steve grinned. “Well, you were cranky, and I knew the only way to get you to cheer up was to have your favourite pretzels.”
“No.” Steve said firmly, turning fully to face the older man. “Nobody is going to go with your idea, and I won’t allow it.”
Peter couldn’t help but laugh, and nodded in agreement. He stopped abruptly when he noticed something in front of them, Wade too who pointed a finger in its direction. There stood a man in a green apron who seemed no older than thirty, with pitch black hair and a thin frame, looking like he’d been forced to stand there holding up the sign with Peter and Wade’s names on. Peter rolled his eyes, before yanking on Wade’s hand and leading him over to the stranger.
Peter wanted to throw something at his head, but instead refrained from doing so as Wade sauntered over and got into the driver’s side of the car. “Start her up.”
“Steve!” Tony breathed out a sigh in relief, hurriedly going to the other man and kneeling beside him. “Steve? Hey, are you okay? Are you hurt?”
Before Peter could answer, he was encased in a big, crushing hug, finding it a little difficult to breath. Tony quickly pulled away, checking over Peter to make sure he hadn’t been bitten by anything dinosaur like, or cut up by anything woodland like.
Tony gave him a punch on the arm before throwing his riffle in the back seat. “You ain’t driving, you’re shit. Move to the back.”
Once their bus had come to a stop at the docks, Wade grabbed their bags and practically ran excitedly onto the boat, Peter passing the other passengers with a mortified look on his face. It was bad enough Wade was wearing a kid’s hat with a green dinosaur on the front. Peter’s embarrassment soon died away when the boat took off and they were on their way to the island, standing at the front of the vessel looking out into the wide, open sea. Dolphins jumped up beside the boat as it sped through the water, as birds flew high above them, and in the distance a huge, green mountain grew even bigger the closer they got.
“Steven?” Thor called down the phone, as suddenly the line was cut off for some reason. “Steve, are you still there?”
“Oh, will we?” Jessica raised her brows in question, hands on hips. “It’s not exactly easy to fix, Stark.”
“What can I say, time got me.” Tony said as he tried to catch up with Luke, he could have sworn he was jogging because he was going way too fast. “Hey, when you said helipad does that mean we’re taking the helicopter?”
Peter snorted, grabbing the big handle and pushing the door as hard as he could muster. With one shove it gave way and Peter opened it wide enough so that they could both fit through. The younger of the two made his way inside first, closely followed by Wade, who clung to Peter’s arm like his life depended on it.
“I…” Tony inhaled deeply, yelling at himself in his head to just stop being a scaredy-cat and face it. “I just needed time to think, Steve.”
“There is nothing to exterminate at the moment, Butterfingers!” Tony snapped back, watching the coffee drip into the pot with hungry eyes.
Yinsen growled, pushing the Alpha back when he raised his hand again. They growled at each other, and Tony cowered in the background as they postured. The cave shook again, and dust fell to the floor. Then, as the Alpha snatched his gun, he growled back at them. He pointed the gun at Yinsen. Yinsen growled back, not budging, and Tony watched as the Alpha glared, finger hovering over the trigger.
his soulmate. Steve never thought that it would be the complete opposite, that his soulmate would fight him at every turn and decision.
“My room,” Tony said, guiding Steve to his bed. He gently pushed him down until Steve was laying freely on top of the bed covers. “I can’t wait to ravish you here. You’re so gorgeous baby. You’re always gorgeous, but you look especially gorgeous now. Your wings even, spread so gorgeously.”
Within seconds Steve felt the warm air of the dinosaur’s breath ghost across his skin, the foul smell of it making him want to heave. There came a low snuffle, a quiet sniff, then just as quickly as it had happened Steve heard her move around and back away. He opened his eyes, and let out a huge sigh of relief as the dinosaur’s footsteps walked away, heading into the trees at the side of her old arena.
Steve let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, as Clint fell onto his knees beside him cursing and mumbling. “You’re fucking insane!” Clint yelped, waving his arms in the air.
Peter smiled in relief as he walked over to the two jeeps that were parked inside the room, which had obviously been a garage at some point. The vehicles were almost identical to the ones they’d been travelling in on the ride earlier, minus the roof and the bright, ridiculous dinosaurs painted on the side. Peter didn’t waste any time in checking one out, finding the lock on the bonnet and popping it open.
As the phone began ringing, the Foniassaurus took that time to interrupt. With its powerful jaws the dinosaur bit down on the bark, its teeth piercing through right above the couple’s heads. The two cried out of fear as the dinosaur shook its head back and forth, moving the trunk along with it, making Peter and Wade wobble around on the inside.
“You’re in charge,” Tony began, waving a hand as Bruce was about to protest. “I’ve put you in charge before Bruce, you do a good job.” he said, as they entered the armoury, Steve going straight to the rifles they’d need. “Get Thor to keep track of the employees and the guests, make sure every single one of them are safely on Main Street and send them straight onto the boats when they arrive. Get Carol and her crew to keep an eye on the Foniassaurus, call us if it’s too close for comfort. And…” Tony sighed, feeling the stress build. “If you can find Peter on there that would a damn good help, send me his location.”
“WADE!” Peter Parker shouted across the room at his boyfriend, zipping his backpack shut with extreme difficulty. “Just choose which damn jacket you want and let’s go!”
Wade’s jaw dropped. “No?” he gasped, placing a hand on his heart. “What a selfish prick. Did you take the Ipad?”
“Tony.” Steve warned, earning a grin from the other man. He couldn’t help but smile back, although he shouldn’t have.
Thor led him to safety as quickly as he could. They walked past Shield security workers and Clint, shooting at the creatures still flying around them, shouting at patrons to take cover, to find somewhere safe as they took out the threat. That’s where Steve, Tony, Peter and Wade ran to the scene, not believing the sight that was before them.
So Steve rolled out from under the jeep, pushing past a few employers that had ran to him asking all sorts of questions, and demanded one of them take him to the laboratory. He was not going to take this laying down, he was going to get into that damn laboratory and find out what the hell that creature was made of, because frankly it had to be stopped before it reached the park. It had to be stopped before any more innocent lives were taken.
“Front seat.” She repeated as Peter sent Wade an apologetic smile whilst getting into the back of the car. “I don’t want you groping my nephew.”
Tony cursed in his mind. So much for playing it smooth. Tony tried not to let Steve’s stare faze him, being an expert in strutting Tony strolled on over to his ex-boyfriend with the biggest grin he could summon, noticing how Steve stood up, turned off his radio and gave him a not so friendly expression.
At least five minutes later Wade whooped in victory at finally being able to put on his shoe. Peter by this point had almost fallen into a deep sleep against a tree, but was rudely interrupted as Wade yanked him off the floor and got them on their way again.
The engineer broke out of his thoughts when he heard Steve’s low voice from behind him. He expected to see him upset, angry, anything that showed how he was feeling at that moment. Steve had lost his friends too, Natasha was like a sister to him. But what he got was a blank stare, Steve looked at him with wide, watery eyes like he’d just seen a ghost, the colour drained from his skin and hands visibly shaking by his sides.
“Charles!” Steve then called over to a Shield man as he thought of a plan, shooting down one of the creatures. The boy named Charles came running over, huffing and puffing in his haste. “Gather some of the team, you need to get these people out of here and to the docks, you understand? They’re our main priority, the ships should be here by now! Make sure you get the wounded aboard first.”
Matt didn’t answer them, neither did the rest, following their boss’s order to stay silent. As the occupants in the control room and his wife had bickered over the coms about infrared, Matt had stayed in place, flinching as some form of liquid had dropped straight onto his cheek. At first he’d thought it was just a drop of rain falling out of the leaves above, but after another had fallen in approximately the same place, he took his finger off the trigger of his gun and took a swipe at his face. His eyes widened as he looked down at the thick, red fluid that stained his glove.
“Mr. Bubblebutt will be thanking me one day, he has a nice, new fence now.” Wade said proudly, going from pulling on Peter’s sleeve to hugging his arm. “So can I sit in the driver’s seat? I promise not to fart in bed anymore if you let me!”
“Jesus fucking Christmas!” Wade wheezed, as Peter grabbed him and pushed him towards the embankment.
“What shall we do next, Mr. Stark?” she asked, willing to do anything that would have made Natasha proud.
“It’s fine,” Tony began. “We’ll find them, I’m sure Thor’s still busy trying to get over twenty thousand people into one place.” he sighed, hoping beyond hope that the plan was going well.
“No.” Steve was horrified, and he shook his head in denial. Any thought otherwise would mean something worse – he had ruined his friendship that day, and he couldn’t bear to hear this news because it meant so much more.. “There’s no way he could have loved me.”
“How does it all work?” Tony asked. “It’s so hard to imagine that there is a whole world out there than just Earth.”
“Good, because I can’t, but my flying has been shit, so that’s how I know that I have missing feathers. And I can’t reach that, so you’ll have to tuck them under the muscle.”
As an artist, he appreciated the beauty of everything, from the way the rickety kitchen table held steadfast to its duty despite it threatening to topple over on any given day, to the fallen curls of grey hair that his ma wore upon her head. But when his wings molded into their true colors, he couldn’t help but stare at them, mesmerized by the way they soaked up the sunlight that filtered through the window and glistened.
“Understood. Please, tell your people that we are grateful that you stood with us, and we are sorry that we could not prevent this tragedy from happening.”
But Steve stood there, his golden locks shining under the red glow of the room, merely a few steps away, and Tony only had to stretch his arm partially to feel the tangibility of the man in front of him. But he didn’t, not yet at least. He didn’t know whether it was that fragile, tentative hope he had within himself that he could still have him eventually, or self-punishment that he didn’t have him that stopped Tony from reaching out to the man in front of him. His throat burned, and his heart constricted tightly in his chest. He both loved and hated the man in front of him.
His eyes snapped open. The entire room was red, casting an eerie hue that coated even the air he breathed. He remained facing forward, breathing only shallowly because it seemed difficult to even draw a deeper breath. His eyes fixed upon the wall in front of him. This place was unfamiliar, but Tony couldn’t bring it within himself to be frightened – he was too exhausted to even be scared. Somehow, however, he also knew that there was nothing behind him…there was no possibility for escape in this God-forsaken area.
“Half,” Nebula replied. “Thanos is a firm believer of the natural balance of the universe, so there would be half of us left.”
“Nothing,” Tony said. Like he wasn’t trying to break into a place that he probably wasn’t supposed to go into, not at all.
Bundled up in swathes of heavy coats and a hat, the smaller man mumbled something incomprehensible through his scarf. As he moved past Stevens, he glanced up, and Stevens froze, staring at those familiar eyes that he also hadn’t seen in years.
Until Rhodey decided to continue., “Or remember that other time when you created Butterfingers out of a whisk and plunger because you were drunk engineering like usual?”
Tony shoved him against the wall with his shoulder. Rhodey was a horrible friend. “That’s bullshit. I hate their dumb faces – they don’t pay attention in class, and they always fail my exams. They don’t even deserve to be in MIT. Dumb, the entire lot of them.”
“I wasn’t ever going to, honest, I was just going to keep to myself and be over here making your uniforms look really good on your ass so that I could fantasize, goddammit I am still drunker than I want to be for this call, but I wasn’t going to say anything. I was just going to keep fucking people who weren’t you to see if I could get you out of my system. I mean, it hasn’t worked yet, but maybe I just need to keep testing the hypothesis. You deserve better than me, Steven. You always have and you always will and Carol is so great, so so great, so that’s it. I love you, you have a great ass, and I’m hanging up now.”
But for now, Steve fell over the edge as Tony pressed against the place that made lights spark behind his eyes. It was entirely too much for him, and he shook, flying, flying, flying.
,” he whispered, staring into Steve’s eyes. They were blown, the blue nearly swallowed entirely by his pupils, and Tony was sure that his looked similar.
You tweet like a twelve-year-old Wattpad romance writer. Let it go bro, Steve hasn’t been your date since the great coffee debacle of August.
“You keep saying that you’re a horrible lecturer, but you still carve out a large portion of your time to help your students, even when it isn’t convenient for you,” Rhodey said, fully grinning now.
“Shrapnel to the chest, poisoned with wolfsbane,” he answered. “The Ten Rings told me to patch you up and didn’t give me any tools. I had to make do with what I had. You didn’t heal properly, and I don’t think you
Yinsen was silent for a moment. Then he asked, “You know, the Ten Rings killed my mate and my children. They took them out into the village square, with all the others. Firing squad. I was spared because I was a doctor.” He pressed a shaking hand to his chest. He looked at Tony with tears in his eyes. “There’s a gaping hole in my chest where my mate bond was, but I’m still living because that’s what my mate would have wanted me to do. She was a doctor too, a doctor for the supernatural. She could have died many times over with the way that our race is hated, but she did her job anyway because that was what she needed to do. I’m carrying her legacy, no matter how much it hurts.”
A laser beam shot out from the robot, completely demolishing the foil. The ashes fluttered gently to the ground, and Tony watched as Butterfingers whirled around happily.
“Who’s the one with language problems now?” Tony asked, voice teasing and light. Steve didn’t rise to the bait, choosing instead to cautiously walk towards the desk.
He struggled to compose himself. “You know what she told me once? She said that every werewolf had a mate. I was lucky to have her. She made me very happy.”
“Thank you Widow,” Steve said, embarrassed. But he didn’t let go of Tony, because he realized he didn’t care if they found out that he was so desperately in love with the man he held in his arms, the man who saved him from himself and from the hatred he had for himself.
“He’s not worth it then,” Tony said. “If you don’t know what you did wrong and he’s not inclined to tell you, you should drop his ass to the curb.”
Tony bounded up the stairs, nearly slipping when his foot caught a patch of black ice. Only Stevens’s grip held him up and he smiled his thanks. “I just really hope my bots didn’t destroy anything while I was gone. They usually are pretty good about that. I’m home!”
The employers in the room all nodded, some piping up in agreement. Tony suddenly felt a whole lot better than he had seconds ago as his eyes travelled across the room, his workers looking at him with pure determination on their faces, Carol standing by her station with brows furrowed and hands fisted by her side like she was ready for war.
The young man sat back and tried his damn hardest to block out the annoying voices of all the guests, and at least take a five minute nap before he had his shift at the café. But apparently it wasn’t meant to be, as the next thing he knew, a loud, high-pitched hum was resounding across the park.
Tony looked at her, then at Thor, then to Steve, and nodded. “We start by putting up defences around the park and finding the Fon… whatever it’s called, everyone get a different camera angle up on your screens and find that damn dinosaur. Thor, you do the search through infrared. We can’t waste any more time.”
Tony groaned, rubbing a hand down his face. “Right, right,” he said, taking a deep breath. “We need to uh… we need to get those people as far away from the outskirts as we can, the Foni-…mabob is most probably still a way away from the main park right?”
Steve went straight into action, running around to the back of the cage where most of the employees were gathered. The trainer saw his close friend standing near the gate, shouting God only knew what to the others.
sorry for the late updates guys! I've been busy with work and going here and there (including to see infinity war... anyone else want to throw a punch at Thanos?)
Peter looked behind him to frown over at his boyfriend, who was trudging through the damp, slimy dirt like it was the most difficult task he’d ever taken on. “Having fun?” Peter smirked, just as Wade stepped in a deep, muddy puddle.
“I don’t understand it either.” Steve answered Jessica, walking over to them. “This doesn’t make any sense.”
The control room was located near the other end of the structure, right on the top floor, away from the hustle and bustle of the park. Tony always liked going there to get away from all the people on the outside, it was a lot quieter and the employees there were always either sitting noiselessly at their stations or communicating calmly through radios and intercoms.
Peter watched in amusement as he skipped about, failing perfectly. “At least I’m not bored.” He mumbled to himself.
“We need to kill this thing,” Matt said, putting an arm around Natasha. “If it gets bad out there, we’ll turn back. But we have to try before someone else gets hurt or worse.”
Jessica and Luke looked at each other as if they both thought Steve had lost it. Luke laughed out loud, shaking his head. “Don’t be ridiculous, the evidence is right there.” He said, as Steve pulled out his phone.
“Good.” Natasha fiddled with the tracker, tossing it to Matt as she zipped up her jacket. “We’ve got our coms on, we’ll be in contact the whole time.” She said as she turned to talk to the other workers.
Thor moved from camera to camera, everyone keeping their eyes peeled for a different kind of red figure amongst the people. But there was nothing. No sign at all of the gigantic dinosaur who had left behind her tracker.
“Precisely.” Thor nodded. “But now that the Foniassaurs is out there, we have no choice but to turn up the volts on every fence that covers the fields and outskirts of the park. Just another way of keeping her away from the main park.”
Tony nodded and hid a smile, as he heard his phone vibrate he was more focused on figuring out a way to get it out of his friend’s pocket than the so called sponsors waiting for them. He had no choice but to stand up straight when Bruce hit him on the arm to get his attention. The engineer straightened his tie and flattened his hair, turning to Bruce with a grin, extending his arms out so he could get a good look at him. Bruce just rolled his eyes, facing forward quickly as the elevator pinged and the doors opened.
Natasha gritted her teeth, slowly taking the gun into her hands. “I’m sorry guys.” She whispered into the com. “I can’t run.”
“It can do that remember,” Steve said calmly, trying his best to keep Tony from completely losing it. “At least we know Peter and Wade are okay, we’ll go to where they were last seen and we’ll bring them back. Okay?”
“Wade!” Peter groaned, the two getting some serious looks from the pair in front of them. “Sometimes I wonder why I take you out in public.”
“The Brachiosaurus.” Was all Steve said before he was practically diving out of the passenger’s seat and running out into the field.
“Well he’s pretty busy, Aunt May.” Peter shrugged. “Didn’t expect him to take time off work to spend time with his nephew that he hardly knows.”
It felt like hours before he got a reply from Thor, but in reality it only took a few minutes to get the dinosaur up on screen. By then he was five minutes from the building, but he needed to know now.
Tony didn’t need to be told twice. The two ran as fast as they could through the trees, dodging bushes and twigs that got in their way, calling out Peter and Wade. They could just about hear the quiet rumbling of the jeep’s engine, meaning they were so close behind.
“It’s just outside the Omnivore’s terrain.” Steve whispered beside the engineer. “Tony, one of the emergency exit gates has been opened, she’s gotten through the electric fence!”
“No.” Steve said certainly. “Look at their wounds, Tony. They haven’t had parts of them torn out like the other one, they’re just… just bite marks and claw marks.”
Tony gave a quick wave to Thor and the rest as he jumped out of his seat, adjusting his tie as he went. “Well hello to you too, Luke.” He said as the man glared. “You’re looking cheerful today.”
The toned man turned around and caught his gaze. “What are you waiting for, idiot?” Luke bawled, as the gate swung open to the side. “Get to the damn control room and track that thing!”
It all happened in a split second. As soon as Steve shouted three he was pushing a shaky Bobby towards the closing gate, the raptors giving out a piercing shriek as they chased after them. Steve could feel his chest sting as they ran for their lives, hearing the dinosaurs get closer, their heavy feet falling noisily against the dirt. His eyes glued to the gate that was slowly shutting, Steve pushed them forward with everything he had.
Tony rolled his eyes, here she goes using their mom against him again. “No, she wouldn’t.” he said, wishing he’d never picked up the damn phone.
“We have to get out of here!” Peter said, eyes widening in fear as the dinosaur took another big chunk of bark off the log. “Fuck, he’s getting closer!”
“Wade,” Peter sighed, tugging out the shoe and tossing it at the other man. Wade caught it with an oomph, mud splattering everywhere. “I said there is no dinosaur you idiot.”
In a flash every person in the room went straight to it, and the noise grew. As the workers got themselves prepared for Shield’s mission, Tony, feeling like he was about to get a dirty look, turned and was startled to see Steve sitting on the floor, staring up at the large screen at the front of the room. His eyes darted across it, watching as the Shield militias got their weapons ready at the back of their van as it sped through the wilderness.
So, being the sensible one of the two, Peter had found a ride that didn’t include a speed of over twenty miles per hour. They were currently in the queue for said ride, which included a dirt track, a jeep, and a lot of wandering dinosaurs. Peter was already having second thoughts the nearer they got to the front.
Since the Avengers Endgame release (which was incredible and perfect and I cried happy tears for Cap) I've been on Marvel mode. Sorry if this chapter seems rushed and crappy, I hope you like it anyway!
He had no idea how far behind the dinosaur was, but he didn’t take any chances and as he got to the tree Wade practically threw him inside. Peter landed painfully on his side inside the gigantic tree trunk, Wade falling not so gracefully beside him seconds later.
“Exactly!” He boomed, fingers skidding across the keyboard. “We may have different fences located around the park, but their all for the dinosaurs that are less… shall we say carnivorous.”
“Wade!” Peter shouted back at his boyfriend, who’d, not so surprisingly, wondered off ages ago. “Wade, get in here! I did it! Let’s get a move on!”
Steve’s eyes widened in shock as the new breed of dinosaur crashed through, roaring once more as if letting the whole park know that she was free, and she was ready to hunt. It was confirmed that those walls indubitably couldn’t hold her. Steve, hoping against all odds that she hadn’t seen him, hurriedly got down in the dirt and rolled under the jeep to lay on his back. And he waited.
The man tilted his head from side to side. “Of a sort. Time Lord. Name’s the Doctor, pleased to meet ya.”
The man waved his suggestion off. “Nah, I like it this way. She needs no fixing. A police box is her preferred state anyway. This is just a pit stop, got knocked off-course for a bit going to the 1600s to visit Pachelbel – Canon in D as it stands is utterly atrocious.”
“I won’t let you fall either,” Steve said, flapping his wings powerfully to keep them afloat. “Are you okay, Iron Man?”
Tony gave him a look. “You know what I mean. This damned fucking wall.” Tony banged his fist against it (strange that it made no noise), and then he leaned forward, pressing his forehead against the barrier. He sighed again, tired. And old. He sounded like he aged twenty years. “I miss you.”
Howard was probably talking about the only time when he showed his wings to the world, and his eyes burned again. “They—”
They fell into a comfortable silence, and Tony shivered hard as the chilly breeze blew by him. Without looking, Stevens put his arm around Tony and tucked him closer by his side. Tony couldn’t complain; the man was a radiator, and sitting next to him was comforting
The knowledge that Tony had given him certainly felt like rocket science (it probably was, considering that it was Tony), but at least Steve can repeat everything word for word to Bruce.
Jackass: Oh god you should try my puttanesca sauce, my friend who’s a chef says it’s even better than his
Steve whined and shuddered, knees almost buckling under him. Tony grabbed his hand again. “Relax,” he said again. “I’ll catch you.”
“Tony.” The expression on Natasha’s face looked so intense that it took all of Steve’s willpower not to wince under her gaze.
Tony nodded. He put a bounce to his step, dragging Stevens behind him. He was going to pretend that nothing was wrong, for his sake. Besides, he wasn’t privy to that conversation. Not yet, at least.
“My TARDIS doesn’t have issues, thank you very much.” The Doctor sounded so insulted by the notion of it, and Tony had to suppress a smile. “She is perfectly fine.”
“It was bad. I hurt Tony in the process. I had an inkling that Bucky killed his parents while he was still the Winter Soldier, but I didn’t know for sure, and Tony took it badly. He attacked both of us, but Bucky was my best friend! I couldn’t just let Tony kill him.”
Tony’s heart threatened to beat out of his chest as the car doors were ripped away one by one and the metallic tang of blood overwhelmed his senses. He was alone in the middle of dead American soldiers, surrounded by hostiles. He turned to one side, still aching from the whiplash. Red eyes stared back at him.
“Yes, it’s safe here. I live here, and so does the rest of the team. You’re not going to be an experiment if you don’t want to.” Steve glared at Tony when it looked like he was gonna say otherwise.
“Fury knows that if he presses that button – “ she pointed to the communicator, which was mysteriously turned off while they were focused on her, “ – it meant that help is critical.”
“His books are written for non-geniuses,” Steve pointed out. “So, I doubt they’re holier-than-thou to anyone else.”
Steve looked at Bucky with blind panic. Bucky stood there, stock-still, staring at the black feather with unreadable eyes. Then he looked up and eyes aimed at Steve.
“But Bucky brought out the reminder that you still had the past,” Natasha continued. Steve threw the wet rag into the used towel bin before he sat across from her. “You wanted the best for him. He was your best friend, and you would do anything to save him.”
When they were done with him, he was still twitching with the after effects of electrocution as they dumped him back into his prison. He couldn’t stop the small pained cries coming out of his mouth.
“If you can figure out how to stop shedding DNA around the world Steve, then we wouldn’t have to worry about this. In the meantime, however, all we can do is take down HYDRA as they come up and hope that they haven’t figured out how to weaponize any blood you’ve spilled during our fights.”
) as they watch Peter and MJ ride upon Bucky’s back. Peter is excitedly directing Bucky to go this way and that while MJ sits behind Peter, feigning disinterest. Slightly further away, Clint is barking up a tree where a cat is settled upon its lowest branch, and the cat is looking down at the dog with haughtily amused eyes.
Okoye spoke then. “Wakanda cannot spare resources right now. We must first grieve for our dead, and then we must rebuild ourselves.”
“Hi, Steve, it’s me,” Tony sighed, “which you know because I invented the fucking phone and you’ll have caller ID and Jesus, I’m rambling, but right, so about that text, I’m sorry. That wasn’t how I was going to tell you, but I’m too tired to lie any more, so I meant the text. Both parts. I’m sorry, though, about telling you.
With those wide chocolate brown eyes giving him those puppy eyes, Steve couldn’t help but cave. Under no conditions could he ever resist those orbs, and Steve gave a slight nod of approval just so that he could see Tony grin happily. He turned back to Tiny Steve. “Is it alright if we take you home?”
“Black wings are bad luck,” she said into his ear. “They remind people of death. Don’t ever show anybody your wings.”
Steve bit his lip. “What about his family?” he asked. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to know the answer because, even if he had only met them once, he still considered them as part of the Avenger’s family. And they took care of each other. But if they were gone, that was three more people dead because of the snap.
Steve was bigger, stronger, healthier when the chamber opened, and he opened his eyes, awed by the clarity of everything.
His wings...they were finally molting, shedding all the translucent feathers off his back to replace them with new feathers...colored ones, as a signal of the coming of age.
Dreams. That were all they were. Yet, Tony craved them every time he closed his eyes because those were the only times that it felt like home. When he stood there in front of him in his dreams, Tony could breathe more easily because it was
“No, you can’t,” the man confirmed. “Not with all the wolfsbane in your body.” He looked regretful, and he brought over a cup of water. He helped Tony up slightly, and Tony struggled not to let out a sound of pain, but a slight strangled noise made it past his lips anyway when a flare of pain in his chest radiated up and down his body. The man gave him a pitying look. “Here, drink. Slowly now. You’re still very weak.”
Tony hummed. “I do know is that the Infinity Stones emit a wavelength no matter where they are, separated or together. The stones being together would create a much more concentrated pulse. If you can create something that would hone the signal, you would get Thanos too.”
The thought of Vision hit him. With the knowledge that Thanos had taken all the stones, it was inevitable that Vision was dead or severely disabled – the Mind Stone had created him.  His heart constricted – yet another one was gone.
Because if he did look up, Tony would see how red his face is. No, it was better to duck down and pretend nothing was happening, even as Tony leaned more heavily on top of Steve.
Oh gee, I don’t know, maybe I lead a Fortune 500 company, I’ve been in the Times 100 every year since I was 21.
“We didn’t even have a coffee date.” He glared at Rhodey when he scoffed and said a little louder, “There’s nothing to it. Besides, he has a girl.”
those hacks for the past few years - even though he was no longer an undergraduate student but a graduate on his third degree.
“That’s a very bold statement there, Doc. We don’t have enough time to learn everything, especially not at the Doctorate level.”
“Hey, it’s just you and me. No one else is watching.” Tony pecked him on the lips again, a quick one, but one filled with the unwavering passion Tony had for Steve. “I’m going to take your brace off.”
Steve pulled his collar down so that the top of the numbers peeked through. “Found it a few days ago after I showered. Must’ve gotten it while we were out burying Ma.”
There’s also another feeling in his chest that he only realized now. It’s…a flutter of his heart when Steve recalled the outline of Tony’s face, the crease of sadness in his eyes, and the downturn of his lips. He…
Stevens gave a weak laugh, smiling at him but not giving him an answer. Then, he turned to Butterfingers and said, “Hello Butterfingers. It’s very nice to meet you.”
Tony itched to go home as soon as possible. He felt untethered while he was out in the middle of nowhere, alone, with no friends to lean upon. It was like Afghanistan, but worse, because there was no guarantee that he could escape from this like he did back then.
instead of boots. It was as if he couldn’t feel the cold at all, and Tony was freezing looking at him.
As you have started 10 fires this month, you have earned 1 trip to the FDNY’s 15th annual firefighter ball.
“You’re going to tell me what’s on your mind?” Natasha finally asked. She passed him a rag before she took the spray bottle and sprayed the disinfectant on the mats.
There was a crunching of boots upon the gravel, and Yinsen growled. He shifted into his werewolf body, leaping forward out of his vision. There was another crunch of gravel, a
Tony slithered down, unbuttoning Steve’s pants and taking his pants and his underwear off in one smooth motion. Steve canted his hips up to make the slide easier. With his cock freed, it slapped up against belly, dripping copious pre-come. It was so hard and red, and Tony leaned down to press a kiss upon the underside of his cock. Steve whined, bucking his hips slightly when Tony licked a heated stripe from his balls to the tip, licking up the precome that had dribbled onto his stomach.
The two shared a look of horror, coming to the realisation that this was going to be as hard and dangerous as Steve had predicted. Tony turned to Thor. “How long will it take for all those people to get to Main Street?”
Tony laughed at his own joke, waiting for a hint of a smile on Steve’s face. The blonde stood there, face still inexpressive, making Tony fidget with uncomfortableness.
“She’s not here.” Matt said to the others, keeping his voice down. There was no way the tracker would be wrong.
“I know, I know.” She sniffed, grabbing a hold of his arms to take a good look at him. “But I’m going to miss you, the house will be so quiet without you.”
“No!” Tony said quickly, knowing Aunt May would already be planning the wedding in her head. “No, we’re not, I’m just uh… I need to ask him for some help with this new dinosaur.”
“Exactly.” Steve said, noticing it was Tony who was calling. “We need to get out of here.” He said, backing up a little, hoping the other two would get the hint and follow. “Now.”
“Bruce did.” Tony shrugged, suddenly interested in the dinosaur at the other’s words, putting aside their awkwardness for a moment. “How is it so stupid?”
Steve shook his head, feeling his heart break at the sight of the dying animal. “It must have been the Foniassaurus.” He said. “There’s no other meat eaters around here, Tony. She’s just left this poor thing for dead.”
“Tony,” Steve said calmly, shifting forward in his seat to lean across, putting a hand on Tony’s arm. “The Foniassaurus is heading for the Pterodactyl house.”
“Because nobody knows how it’ll behave.” Steve said, he picked up his tool box and began heading towards his cabin, Tony having no choice but to follow through the muddy grass in his expensive shoes. “I don’t know which dinosaur’s genes they used, I wish I did to get a better understanding of it, but no matter what, nobody can tell what this thing could do.”
Hearing all this Bruce put his head in his hands. “I can’t believe this is happening.” He mumbled into his lap. “God, this is all my fault.”
When Tony did turn into the property, he suddenly felt stupidly nostalgic. He’d spent a bit of time in Steve’s small cabin, every time he’d go there to be with Steve he always felt like a weight was lifted off his shoulders, and Steve would always be there to make his stressful, crappy day a whole lot better with his big dinners, old fashioned movies and not to mention the long, hot baths. He sighed, he’d spent time in there with Steve, but not enough.
Before he could even think what he was doing, Tony was stepping towards the blonde and wrapping his arms around him. He held Steve tight to him, closing his eyes and relishing in the fact that he was there, breathing, still alive. Steve was filthy, his clothes were soaked right through and he stank of petrol, Tony couldn’t imagine what he’d been through to get out of the dinosaur’s clutches.
The blonde blinked in astonishment as Tony caught him, looking over at the older man in confusion. “What?” he asked, noticing how the engineer’s face looked serious enough that he wasn’t about to pop out another joke. “What is it, Tony?”
“That’s the problem,” Steve said, lowering his voice. “She’s been cooped up behind walls since the day she was born, now she’s free, she’s out there exploring and hunting and nothing’s stopping her from doing what she wants.” Steve looked between Matt and Natasha, a pleading look in his eyes. “She will kill
Steve’s insides hurt, they hurt so bad he’d felt like he’d been booted in the gut. His head began to spin from the whole situation, and all he could think about was his two dead friends behind those grey walls. He didn’t have much time to think before he heard the Foniassaurus give out another ear-piercing growl, and that’s when the ground began to shake from its heavy footsteps.
But Tony just laughed, as Clint ran past him and jokingly punched his arm, before finding a new position on top of a wall of all places. Tony and Steve shared a smile, knowing Clint was right at home.
The long, deafening ring kept on going. It rang and rang, and the more it rang the more Tony felt like he was going to throw up.
“It’ll be distracted, Wade!” Peter growled in frustration as the dinosaur ripped away some more of the sapling. “You ready?”
“Jesus,” Tony said with a grin as he stopped in front of his nephew. “You’ve grown, how old are you now? Thirteen? Fourteen?”
“Oh, come on, sugar dumpling!” Wade whined at the top of his voice, earning quite a few funny looks from the other tourists. “I swear I won’t touch any big red buttons.”
Just like that the peace was broken. Steve and his group of friends looked up and found chaos across the metal bridge that Steve had been on minutes ago, workers running across it and around the enclosure, some yelling whilst some stood there staring into the cage looking deathly pale.
And now, now he had to go and drive straight up to Steve’s doorstep and ask him for some help. Six months of side-stepping him and it takes an escape artist of a dinosaur and an anxious Luke Cage to push him right back into Steve’s space. He didn’t even know how Steve would react, and that’s what made his heart beat faster than what was normal.
“Whilst you two were making out in the middle of Main Street,” Peter said, with a hint of hilarity in his voice. “The Shield dudes and Clint took out the rest of the birds, and are wondering what the fuck we do now.”
tempting.” He said with a grin, and Wade knew he’d totally just won him over from the cheeky smirk etched across his face. “Damn it, Wade. Fine, fine, you can get in the driver’s seat, just don’t you
“Oh, shit.” Tony whispered, as the next thing they knew the dinosaur smashed through the glass like it were made of paper, roaring loudly as it entered.
“As soon as every guest and employee is together, we need to make an announcement over the speakers.” Tony began, starting to pace. “We do not tell them there’s an escaped dinosaur or like Steve said there’ll be mass panic, we have to stick to the electrical fault story.”
“Our team are outside waiting, we just need your order and we’ll get out there stat.” Natasha said, calling some employees over. “We need to grab a tracker.”
Wade looked over not so discretely. “Mr. don’t touch my hair is currently talking on the phone, I wonder if it’s his boss from the robot clang.”
“She may be smart, but she’s never been out of her cage before,” Natasha said. “We have an advantage, she’ll have no idea how to survive out in the wild.”
“No,” Steve gasped, as there came another crash from the enclosure. All four members of the jeep held their breath, as out of a newly formed breach in the globe, a group of Pterodactyls flew out. “Oh, God.”
The two sent her a small wave as they made their way to the security check, tickets in hand and backpacks ready to put through the machine. Peter turned once more to send his Aunt another wave, her hand waving back frantically.
Steve didn’t have to say anything, as he reached out a hand and pointed down at the muddy ground. Tony gazed at the spot where he was pointing, and he felt his blood run cold. Laying in the mud was a torn up, enormous tree trunk, bits and pieces of the wood strewn all around the path, and right alongside it was a phone. Tony bent down to retrieve it, and knew immediately that it belonged to his nephew.
“Ready when you are,” Natasha told them, yanking the small camera that was stuck to her suit, holding it outwards. “Scan through all of them, we’ll each hold the cameras up at different angles.”
Matt just laughed quietly to himself as he gave Steve a pat on the back, disappearing through the double doors. Natasha stopped in front of the blonde, putting a hand on his shoulder and giving him a slight shake.
“Oh, come on, don’t be like that.” Tony said as he put his phone back in his pocket. “We’ll have fun later, right? Say six o’clock?” he tapped a finger to his lips. “No wait, I’ve got another Skype thing, say eight? When’s your bed time?”
“Wait, what?” Tony didn’t have time to stop him before Steve was out the door again, it was starting to become a habit of his. “Steve, be careful!” Tony called as he grabbed his own gun and got out of the car. “I swear you have a death wish!”
“Tony,” Steve said, slipping the last of the bullets into his pocket. “Everything will be fine. We’ll get Peter back, we’ll get everyone off this island, and kill the Foniassaurus. Don’t worry.”
“Kill the dinosaur, right?” Matt asked as he typed into his phone, looking up as he stuffed it into his back pocket. “We’re on it.”
“Nope,” Tony chuckled, slinging his rifle over his shoulder. “But you were looking for those pretzels, and were pretty adamant that we’d find them.”
As his gaze travelled to his right, scanning the impenetrable walls, his eyes widened as he took in what was on the other side of the glass. Steve took a few small steps forward, breathing growing heavy, and heart beating loudly against his chest. He gasped, this was not good.
“Good.” Tony sighed, eyes never leaving the shape on screen. “I think it’s about time we evacuated.”
“Luke?” Steve turned to the man, who seemed as baffled as his wife. “Was there any time of the day when nobody was around? Maybe for dinner, or for a break of some sort?”
Tony felt his stomach drop. He suddenly felt awfully sick, his heart was virtually beating out of his chest by now. How the hell did the dinosaur make those marks? It must have tricked them, but, could dinosaurs be that smart? She made them think it had escaped, when in reality she was still inside. And then it hit him. Luke and Jessica were going inside.
“You’re braver than most, Rogers.” Another worker named Logan patted him on the shoulder as three of them crowded around him, shaking his hand and their heads in disbelief. “Don’t think any of these men would have the balls to do what you do you crazy fucker!”
Bruce and Clint jumped out of their skin as Thor loudly broadcasted, typing away on his keyboard with his fingers dancing so quickly across it they were like a blur.
“My name is Yinsen.” When he was sure Tony wasn’t going to move any further and hurt himself, he stood up, knees cracking. He looked old, tired, broken, but still, there was some strength in him as well. He moved closer to the fire, taking a bucket with him. “We’ve met before, once.”
“Oh, is that why you chased Bucky down all these years? Because you live in the present? Grow a pair, Rogers. You’re stuck chasing the past, and you know it– “
Tony rarely blushed anymore; he was usually the suave and confident one, but with Steve there and complimenting him at every turn, he couldn’t help but be flat-footed. “Fuck, and you’re so beautiful too,” Tony said, giving him his best even as his brain was leaking out of his ears.
“It’s probably your own fault,” Bucky replies as he walks past him, padding after Natasha. Peter and MJ has not slipped down like before when the dogs (and cat) prepared to leave, and they don't seem inclined to leave their positions either.
“Okay, sweetheart,” Tony said, and there was a deeper pressure in his ass where Tony was fucking him with two fingers, and Steve moaned through his tears. He felt full as Tony stretched his ass, and his entire being felt raw as his tears continued to leak out of his eyes.
Ugh, this is taking forever, I wonder if there is a way to up the temperature and decrease the time.
Tony nodded. Yinsen pushed him gently towards the armor. “You won’t be able to move until the systems come online. Even your werewolf strength wouldn’t be able to carry this.”
They chuckled awkwardly for a second before Tony broke it. “Pep wants a PR photo in our penguin suits before the clock strikes midnight and I turn back into a pumpkin.”
“You better,” Bucky called back as his steps thumped down the staircase, “Else I’ll kill you myself.”
“We’re home,” Steve told Tiny Steve. He stepped off the Quinjet and took a moment to let his mini counterpart take in his surroundings. It wouldn’t be home, not yet, just like the way it took a while for Steve himself to get used to the new world. But Steve was confident that he would get used to it.
“Put us down?” Tony asked. Steve nodded, and he floated them gently to the ground. Steve clung to Tony, breathing hard. Tony stroked his back, stroking his wings. “I’m so proud of you.”
It was a good deal, because if the ship really had mechanical issues, Tony would be the man to fix it. He was a genius after all, and fixing things was his specialty. That, and inventing things, but Tony loved making broken things better. And if this ship was broken, Tony was interested in fixing it, learning about it, and making it better.
when he wasn’t looking, and one Anthony Stark looked at him with veiled distaste. He thought that having a soulmate would complete his life, would be happy to
Tony shrugged. “Electricity went out for a good thirty seconds in the middle of lab before the generators kicked in, and the kids were idiots. One even dropped acid on himself because he was too busy staring at his classmate. I’m running a
“Oh,” Steve said, looking down at his plate. But he wasn’t flightless, but he could essentially be one, with the way he tucked his wings into their brace every day. He hadn’t stretched his flight muscles in months.
Tony’s back were marred with old scars, indented slightly from the healing process. But where Steve expected wing muscles protruding out from his back, or at least a scar of it, there was nothing.
“We…couldn’t beat Thanos.” Steve loathed to admit it, because it was a weakness to show the crippling failure of them not doing their job. But they needed help, whatever help they could get.
He was completely naked and anyone could see anything. Yet, he found that he couldn’t care less. He wanted everyone to know that Captain America was claiming him, owning him heart, mind, and soul, and no one could take that away from him. He saw himself in the darkened glass, mouth gaping open and breathing harshly like he couldn’t get enough breath, eyes wide and blown and dazed and happy, and his cock was leaking profusely, sending trails of pre-come to the floor.
His eyes slipped shut, his mind whirling at a thousand miles per hour, reminiscing moment by moment of everything that came to head in this apocalyptic event, revisiting every decision that could have been changed so that the tragedy could have been avoided.
“On another Kindle Unlimited binge, James?” Pepper quirked an eyebrow, but her eyes only held warmth for her friend.
Tomorrow became today, and his death was imminent. Dropping the plane into the Atlantic was America’s only hope, and he had one week left on his soulmate timer. Pity.
“Well, that’s a charming fiction,” Tony smiled slightly as he collapsed into the co-captain seat clad in his under suit. Steve’s eyes flickered over Tony and returned to the skyline before Tony could think anything of it.
Then the man dropped his hand from the surface of the TARDIS and stepped away. “Good luck getting in. She likes you, but she also likes having fun. Try asking her, it’s as simple as that.”
Tony bared his painfully human teeth at the Alpha. “Over my dead body,” he said slowly. With his recalcitrant tone, there was no question what he said.
as he got up and stretched, snatching his sadly empty mug from his desk. He followed the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee once he exited his workshop, and he grinned tiredly.
“I thought you lost your wings in Afghanistan. I read your file,” Steve said. “I never thought to question it.”
This time, there was a man standing there placidly behind him, staring directly at him with a bemused look on his face. Tony yelped and nearly brained himself against the blue box, barely stopping himself from crashing into them with a flailing hand. Then he whirled around and stared.
The cave shook again, and the explosion was much louder, echoing loudly inside their prison. Tony was limited in sight by the metal eye pieces he had, and he hated the selective blindness. Yinsen snapped his head towards the door, scowling.
Going back into the old and familiar routine of creating helped keep his mind off the fact that he was still in the middle of nowhere and creating a sensor that could help the search drew his attention away from his dire situation and into something he could control. Tony rolled the pen between the fingers of one hand and absently drummed his other hand against his thigh. Both legs were on the seat crisscrossed, and blank pieces of paper were strewn about at the base of the chair. The pages were blank – they would be for a while yet because paper on the ship were spare and Tony had to conserve for the final product – but already Tony had an idea in his mind, not only to use the sensor on the ship, but also improve it to extend its range as far as possible. He built upon the idea, bringing the pieces together. Finally, he grasped the idea and blankly reached for a sheet of paper, drafting his design by hand.
The slide of Steve’s cock was wet and lewd, messy and uncoordinated, but it felt so good. Tony wanted this and more, forever, accepting whatever Steve would give him, possessive holds of his chest and his cock, stroking firmly with the pre-come that continued to leak out of his cock, ducking even further under to hold his balls and massage it, all the while Steve sped up his pace and fucked his ass, sounds of slick and lube filling the otherwise silent room.
His wings were white, finally, and Steve gave a tired grin when he saw them. Maybe, it’ll all be okay.
“Oh, you know, just decided to take a stroll.” He said in his mocking tone. “I’m a lucky man to have seen what you just did, Steven. Very impressive, like I’ve said before, those raptors would make a good weapon with you at the reins.”
“You wait until I get my hands on Hank!” Tony growled. “When he gets back from vacation I’ll ring his freaking-,”
“What if it’s dangerous?” Peter said, thinking about all the different things that could be behind the door. “Could be the electrics room or something.”
“You can’t!” Steve said hard-heartedly, the room going silent and all eyes turning to listen to the dinosaur expert. “Did you not see what that thing did?”
Bruce just stood there like he’d been stunned. His eyes flickered from Tony to Steve, mouth agape, not quite able to speak. Tony’s words repeated in his head over and over, and out of the blue he just began to laugh. Tony and Steve shared a look of confusion.
“Are you okay?” he began babbling. “What happened? How long have you been here? I don’t even want to know how you’re here, you’re here and that’s all that matters! You’ve lessened my life by at least ten years, Peter!”
“My god.” Tony hurriedly took out his phone and dialled Thor’s number. “We need to get everyone off this damned island.”
“Sorry, Aunt May, Wade just did something crazy.” He said with a grin, sending Wade a wave as he ran past, Loki hot on his tail.
“Come on!” Steve wasn’t giving up that easily, and noticing the tyre tracks on the ground he pushed Tony forward the same way. “Let’s go!”
“Hiding.” Tony breathed in deeply, starting to put the puzzle together. “Holy shit, she was blending in and watching the fucking team!”
“Hi, how’s it going?” he asked the couple in front. “If you could get eaten by a dinosaur which one would it be?”
Steve grabbed her palm, heated and sweaty with fever, and she looked at him with her eyes at half-mast, shiny with unshed tears. “Don’t blame yourself for this. This would have happened anyway,” she insisted.
“He’s only summoned by my safeword. I’ll add yours, too. Wait, do you have a safe word? Are you into things that require safewords? I have so many questions, and I-”
Steve returned desperately, bucking into Tony’s grip. Tony looked at him, eyes darkened with lust and heat.
They stopped for a late lunch, and Stevens somehow made a killer spaghetti and meatballs with the items he found around the kitchen. Tony didn’t even know that he owned half the things that Stevens collected from his various cupboards, but once he put his fork into his mouth, all thoughts flew out of his head.
Tony chuckled and graciously accepted the replacement drink from the waiter, who swirled up as soon as Pepper left.
Tony looks behind him and he bristles at the sight. Well, he bristles as much as he can with his already puffed-up fur.
There was a press of lips against his. Steve gasped, but Tony took that as an invitation to lick into his mouth, pressing forward so that Steve lost control of his reality. There were sparks behind his eyes as Tony ravaged his mouth.
Steve turned. Even in the dark, Tony’s eyes still shone and glittered. Steve reached up to caress Tony’s face softly, and he said, “You’re perfect. You may be completely flightless, but you made yourself wings. You didn’t let not being able to fly stop you. You’re amazing, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Only the new kid, Bucky, stayed. “Mean punch you packed there,” he remarked, staring down at Steve’s split knuckles.
Tony huffed in resignation. “I can never win with you. But since you were so kind to mention it, please pull it up.”
Tony fall into pure bliss while Steve grooms him, dozing and cuddling the larger dog as Steve cleans his fur.
Tony turned and stomped away, anger boiling within him. But he didn’t go far; he couldn’t really walk away – he just had to know the truth. “I cared about you, Steve!” Tony burst out, still facing away. He couldn’t bear to see the man who had hurt him so much. “Friends don’t do this! I would have liked to know about this!”
that this scene was true, that he could have all of that and more. His throat constricted because this…this could never happen, not with the way Tony and Steve were separated after the Civil War, and now they’re literally a universe apart. The feeling hurt more than it should, and he
Natasha and Clint were off doing a SHIELD mission, Bruce was in his lab, and Thor was back at Asgard. Tony was thankfully in the middle of meetings, last Steve checked.
to. Obie was still riding his ass about his unfinished project Tony needed to work on for Stark Industries, and he was two weeks behind on his thesis.
He found his paper but also found a box of old electronics, mostly burnt out and long-obsolete stored in a corner of the ship. He rifted through it, noting the broken wiring and cracks of monitors. They were not ideal scraps, but with time, Tony could probably reuse them for something.
Steve walked away, the cadence of his footsteps carrying him away from Tony because he will do what Tony has requested. Tony deserved that and more.
“Fu-fuck me,” Steve moaned back, clutching onto Tony’s arms desperately. Because if he didn’t do so, he would have fallen to his knees in a prayer to him.
The man was gorgeous, to put it lightly. In reality, he looked like a Greek statue, with blond hair slicked back without a strand out of place and a well-groomed beard that made him look older and wise. His chest stretched the red sweater he wore, hugging every inch of muscle that was not covered by the well-worn black leather jacket. Tony had to stop himself from undressing the man after he reached the waistband of his pants and drag his eyes back up to see his blue eyes twinkling with curiosity and then with amusement. Tony blushed; the man looked like he knew what Tony was doing to him.
An hour later the three entered JFK international airport, Peter and Wade sending off their small, shared suitcase at the desk, before making their way to their gate. It wouldn’t take long for their flight to board as Wade had decided he needed to pee halfway through their car journey, which took him a lot longer than normal, and then he’d stopped for a bagel which took up more time, making them closer and closer to being late for their flight.
“What is this place?” Wade asked, giving the door a knock. “Anyone home?” he called in a high pitched voice.
“Well done,” Steve said as he held up two hands, the creatures not moving an inch at his command. “Hold… that’s it.”
“Are you sure?” Wade shrieked as Aunt May avoided a cone at the side of the road. “Because you’re a terrible driver.”
“Dugan, back up!” Steve shouted again, noticing the biggest Raptor creeping forward. “Stay right where you are.”
Tony nodded, earning an annoyed look from the blonde. “Jesus, Tony.” He shook his head in disbelief. “Your nephew is here and you’re not spending your time with him?”
“We have to stop all the rides.” He said before storming into the control centre, Bruce and Steve hot on his tail. “Thor!” Tony yelled, making everyone in the room look around. “Stop the rides and get everyone to the Information Centre, now!”
When he turned up to that part of building he immediately felt calmer, like he’d completely left the world behind. As he stepped through the double doors into the control room he let out a sigh, taking in the brightly lit panels, bright computer screens, and the soft hum of the electrics. He definitely preferred this part of the park to the others, it was a bonus that nothing in here would eat them too.
“Peter,” Tony turned to his nephew, as he heard Steve load his riffle. “You and Wade need to find somewhere to hide, stay undercover.”
Peter had dragged Wade off to the baby dinosaurs straight after, where they got to pet a one month old triceratops and see some eggs hatch through the laboratory’s windows. They had a go on some of the rides which were way too few, watched a Tyrannosaurus Rex eat a goat (which had Wade giggling at the thought of the creature giving out a loud belch), and after some food of their own at the Dino Café they reached the Mosasaurus show. Safe to say it was Wade’s favourite part of the day by far.
“Clint?” Steve called calmly to his friend, who he knew was still standing close by. “When I get to three you shut that gate.”
Luke didn’t answer him, but seconds later he found out for himself when the hulking man slammed the metal doors open to the roof and there stood the companies helicopter, its engine roaring into life as they stepped inside. Tony climbed in not so gracefully and tugged on the headphones, watching in disbelief as Luke got into the driver’s seat next to the usual helicopter driver, Danny.
“Steve?” Tony swallowed the growing lump in his throat, suddenly feeling sick to the stomach. “Please, tell me that’s not what I think it is.”
Steve didn’t blame him, after everything they’d been through that day, it was easier just to let Peter get his own way. “Did you really say May has hair like a birds nest?”
Steve tried to smile, but failed terribly. “Stay safe.” Was all he could say, knowing nobody would heed his words no matter how hard he tried.
“What’s the plan?” Carol pipped in, crossing her arms over her chest and looking like she was ready for a fight.
“Shit!” Peter shrieked as he realised they hadn’t outsmarted the creature after all, as he heard its heavy footsteps getting closer and closer behind them.
Peter dove out of the front seat so Tony could take over, the teenager being pulled into the back seat by Steve who’d already climbed inside. The four were safely in the jeep before another thunderous thud made the vehicle jolt tremendously.
Wade didn’t need to be told twice. The couple spun around and were running for their lives before the dinosaur took its first step towards them, hot on their tails. Peter’s heart thumped wildly against his chest as they ran like the wind deeper into the forest, having no clue as to where they were going, only knowing they had to find somewhere, anywhere where the dinosaur couldn’t get them.
Tony stopped the car then. He pulled onto the side and stared down at his phone, rubbing his thumbs in circles across the side of his head. This was not a good time for this conversation.
Ten minutes later the two were seated in a glass top jeep that was so brightly painted with dinosaurs that it made their eyes hurt, Peter sat himself down in the passenger’s side, and Wade excitedly got behind the wheel. He was just a tad disappointed when he found that the steering wheel was being controlled and he had no way of moving it by himself.
Tony felt numb as he walked through the white hallways, hand clutching his phone tight, legs shaking and heart beating at full volume. People that were running around with phones glued to their ears, yelling things at each other, stopped in mid step as their boss passed them, staring with wide eyes and knowing looks. He didn’t notice, didn’t want to pay them any attention, blocking out their voices and sad faces entirely. Tony just wanted to get to the control room, he needed to know what had happened.
“Oh yeah,” Wade sing-songed, lifting his foot up to reveal his wet, dirty socked foot. “Especially when my shoe decides to drown in the mud!”
“Monty, Frenchie, Gabe!” Steve called to each Raptor as he threw them all a rat in turn, every single one gobbling down the treat like it was their last. “Good boys.” Steve smiled, watching as the four animals gazed up at him as they finished.
Steve slowly lowered his arms, trusting that his friend had their backs. “One, two,” the raptors growled. “THREE!”
Tony hummed, looking over at Peter who knew exactly what he was about to do. “Bit old for you isn’t he Peter?”
“So, we’re not going bye bye?” Wade asked, looking like he was contemplating whether to pick Peter up and run, or get into the foetal position and cry.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony agreed, noticing that Thor was already writing up a speech on his computer. “Carol could you ring the boats? Get every single one to come into the port for pickups.”
Unfortunately for Tony, his plan got a little side tracked when his phone began to ring. He took a peep at the screen and Peter’s name flashed across it. Tony felt relief flood him before he swiped his thumb across his phone and answered the call, full on bawling down the receiver.
A grey haired woman named Aunt May yelled from the front door of a two storey house, fiddling through her bottomless handbag to try and find her car keys. Meanwhile, as she stepped down onto her drive, in the front bedroom of the house said boys were busy scattering about the room in a mad dash. More like: one was scattering whilst the other decided on what to wear.
“We’re with you!” Thor suddenly said, face contorted in complete rage at what he’d just witnessed, he got up from his chair to stand beside them. “Steve’s right, whatever it is you need us to do, boss, we’ll do it.”
Wade wasn’t going to argue with that. They were more than relieved when they reached the strange rock, which turned out to be a huge one storey building, decorated in plants, vines and anything the jungle could wrap around it. It didn’t take long to find the giant, wooden door at the front, which thankfully had no locks to stop them from getting in.
“No,” Steve bit his lip, thinking back to the incident with Shield, replaying every step in his mind from the conversations to the camera angles. “It inherited something a lot more dangerous.” He said surely.
Jessica crossed her arms over her chest, annoyed as hell at what had happened. The three had checked out the scuffs on the wall up close, surely enough it was unquestionably the Foniassaurus’s claw marks, dug deep into the stone.
By this point Bruce had realised that the other two weren’t laughing. In fact, Steve looked even gloomier than he had minutes before, and Tony, well, by now he’d have been laughing along at the ridiculous joke, but his face was more serious than it had ever been.
Ever since he was a kid Steve’s only wish was to work at Jurassic Island. Being the biggest fan of dinosaurs he’d begged his mother to take him to the park just once, and that had him determined to do anything to make his wish come true. When his mother had passed away she’d left him enough money to get into university, meaning he could study dinosaurs and learn all about their behaviour and the world they lived in. Four years of studying hard and passing all his exams with flying colours had paid off as he’d been snatched up by Jurassic Island, who wanted him to start as soon as he’d left his school.
Steve smiled softly, placing his own hand atop of Tony’s giving it a gentle squeeze. “I’m fine, Tony. Let’s just get this day over with, yeah?”
Tony whipped his head around so fast he felt it click. Thankfully he wasn’t met with a ginormous, scary looking lizard with sharp teeth and red eyes, but what he saw was just as bad. There, amongst the trees, he could just about see two big, black eyes staring right at him. Tony froze as the dinosaur blinked, its eyes not leaving him as it stood there stock still, probably imagining how tasty he’d look on a platter with French dressing and a salad.
Steve looked in at what everyone else was gazing at, and his heart stopped. There, on his back inside the enclosure was their newest recruit Bobby, and in front of him the four Raptors lined up and slowly crept towards him with hunger in their eyes. Steve knew those movements, they were preparing to attack and eat the man alive.
Peter glared at him, wishing he hadn’t pointed out the glass building between the trees. “I hate you.” Peter mumbled as the crowd began disembarking.
“Erm…” Thor hummed, hanging up his phone and tossing it on his desk. He gazed up at the screen in front of the room, looking from one camera shot to the other, trying to figure out exactly what Steve was talking about over the phone. “Steve, he-,”
Steve frowned. “You’re right.” Even though they’d had her tracker, she was nowhere to be found through infrared, the one thing that could have told them where she was. Steve had a bad feeling sitting in the pit of his stomach. “Bruce?”
