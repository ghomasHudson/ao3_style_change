Sherlock welcomed the distraction of chess. He tried to zone in on the game, content in the knowledge that his mother was an excellent player and he didn’t need to pull his punches as when he’d played against John. On the other side of the living room, Father pulled out an old battered copy of Scrabble, wriggling his eyebrows at John. “You’re a writer, John,” he said. “Care to see how you do against the king of crosswords?” John laughed – again, that carefree chuckle that Sherlock had missed so much – and they settled down for a rather silly, slightly inebriated game. As it turned out, it was rather difficult to play chess successfully and catalogue the exact number of John’s giggles at the same time. Sherlock realised that his mother was wiping the floor with him. After a while, Sherlock became so distracted by the casual banter by the table that he basically stopped moving his pieces altogether. She let him, watching her husband and John as well with an amused smile.
They hesitated for a moment. “Sherlock… are you all right?”
He saw Sherlock wavering. He swallowed and lowered the gun a fraction. “That’s it,” John whispered. “We can discuss this all once we’re home, okay?”
After they had exchanged all of the boring pleasantries, Lestrade began to conclude the conversation. A chair was pushed back with a scraping noise. Sherlock stepped into the doorway.
“Oh, state secrets, I’m afraid,” Sherlock rolled his eyes for effect.
Lestrade’s eyebrows disappeared completely under his short fringe. This was unheard of.
“Lovely,” she grinned. “We can talk about it tomorrow.”
“Yes.” Sherlock steepled his fingers and stood in front of them, ready to impress. “I believed that our dear ‘Love’ was responsible because all of the relevant messages contained her personal communications code.” Mycroft frowned; clearly disgruntled that Sherlock would simply throw around people’s secret codenames like that. But then he glanced at Mary, who shrugged, and he dramatically rolled his eyes as Sherlock continued.
When he had been younger, Mycroft had always felt overwhelmed by the whirlwind that was Sherlock, the uncontainable bursts of emotion in the boy shocking the shy young man Mycroft had been. He didn’t know what to do with him back then, and he still didn’t, not really. He was a force of nature and in many respects, still a bit of a child. So if someone injured or threatened the people he loved, he simply tore through them with a vengeance. Perhaps it was this strange relentlessness that made people like John feel so drawn to him – to a romantic mind that could seem very enthralling. Mycroft, however, thought it was volatile and dangerous.
They sat in the cab, and John was texting back and forth with Lestrade, informing him about Helen. “There’s no proof it’s Moriarty,” he merely commented at some point. Sherlock scoffed and John said nothing. They were quiet for the rest of the ride, both unsure what would await them. Sherlock hoped that the police wouldn’t show up at Frederick’s before them, because they usually messed things up. He was suddenly very glad he had John with him.
Sherlock quickly stepped forward, interrupting his barrage of shouting. He placed a hand on John’s good arm. “John.”
“I’m not so sure,” he said thoughtfully, not even bothering to deny anything Mrs Hudson had said. “She’s different.”
something, Sherlock?”
! Also, if you’d given any
“Dhon! I have foung another lisht of purchashesh to check,” he exclaimed with enthusiasm, toothbrush dangling from his mouth.
“No. I would…” he stopped himself, quickly glancing at John’s eyes.
There was a long silence on the other side of the door. Finally, he heard the quiet voice again. “I know,” she said.
John moaned as he tried to sit up. It was over. Norbury was by his side in an instant, pointing her gun at his temple. She’d taken a nasty bruise away from her fall and looked decidedly less composed than before.
Lestrade merely leaned forward expectantly. Sherlock took a deep breath. “It was an accident,” he stated confidently.
He had to say something to clear his conscience, at least. “Sherlock… I’m sorry for prying like I did earlier. That wasn’t on.”
She smiled. “Hey. Don’t worry so much. Yesterday morning he was so jealous I thought he’d throw me out on the spot.”
“Thanks,” John said, quite innocently. He didn’t want a fight with her, and he genuinely thought that there was something that must have changed her mind about them. Perhaps she guessed it already?
“Sherlock,” he managed, his lips dry. And then he smiled and gripped his hand tighter and Sherlock felt like his feet had suddenly lifted several inches of the floor. It was a most peculiar sensation, one that he fully intended to investigate further in future.
“Thank you.” John, clearly done standing attention, slumped over and fell against Sherlock’s shoulder.
Suddenly, he heard noises. Cars were pulling up out front, and the siren of an ambulance was coming closer, then was switched off. He thought quickly and looked around. There was nothing to attract attention with, so he opted to shout as loudly as he could instead. His bellowing was made difficult by his sore throat, but finally, a yellow-vested policeman saw him through the rubble and quickly pulled out his walkie talkie.
She seemed to be calling his name. Perhaps something was the matter? He vaguely tried to assess his bodily functions. Was he injured or something? With another stabbed reminder he noted he had a headache. Also his back was killing him. His arms and legs were at unusual angles… well, one arm, that was; he couldn’t feel the other one at all. Also, his bed seemed to have suddenly turned into wood and felt suspiciously like a flight of stairs.
“Yes. I need to work without Mycroft breathing down my neck. Don’t think I’ll sleep,” Sherlock told the laptop, still not looking up.
“He’s out with Mary, then?” she asked almost too casually.
“John. Sherlock,” Donovan said with a nod and turned around to follow Lestrade across the hall. John’s eyebrows rose dramatically and he shared a bewildered look with Sherlock, who looked equally amused.
“No,” Sherlock said. He felt an uncomfortable twist in his stomach. John hadn’t so much as mentioned Mary all day, and he knew that if she’d suddenly contacted him, he would have said something. It was strange – in the past, John had behaved differently with his girlfriends. Added to that there was John’s odd behaviour in general, and then that moment earlier… but this was the only area where Sherlock felt curiously out of his depths.
“You know, if you keep doing things like this to prank people, it’s no wonder they dislike you or call you names,” he pointed out quietly whilst watching the spectacle.
Mrs Hudson looked like she was about to laugh, but thankfully kept herself in check, smirking at John’s expression. She pointed at the pills she’d put on the bedside table. “I’ll just get you some water,” she whispered and went back in the direction of the kitchen. John took a deep breath. Then another one. He glanced over at Sherlock, who still seemed oblivious to the world and their current predicament. He tried to wriggle free, but either Sherlock was a lot stronger than he looked or John was simply too hungover to coordinate his muscle movement. John’s hand hovered over Sherlock’s shoulder for a moment, then his waist, then his hips, unable to decide what to do. It was impossible to move them both into a more comfortable position without manhandling Sherlock again, but John was incredibly reluctant all of a sudden. Touching Sherlock had never been an issue until now – the man wasn’t exactly big on the concept of personal space – but suddenly it seemed like he was taking advantage of it.
They entered a dingy little hut nestled between barren hills somewhere along the Russian-Belarusian border. The last leg of Sherlock’s forced trip had made short work of a rather vicious criminal network that smuggled state secrets from the East to the West and vice versa. Sherlock had been instrumental in discovering the right people to arrest, the correct bank accounts to freeze and which employees to interrogate back home in England. Moriarty’s remaining network was crumbling beneath the combined power of the Holmes brothers, and Mycroft bemoaned the fact that he and Sherlock did not usually cooperate so well. Nothing about the situation was ‘usual’, of course.
and said that they’d look into it. Frederick snorted, clearly quite upset as he recounted the story. “The sergeant even had the guts to say that ‘
“Tuesday,” John said. “After the art gallery we went to a pub and… she just went home,” he explained. He noticed Sherlock’s eyes narrowing at him.
John smiled wistfully across the room. Sherlock was sitting in his
“Jesus, so she was right?!”
“Uh, yes, absolutely.”
While he was writing, he noticed that Sherlock was becoming more and more agitated. He paced for a while, then began haphazardly pinning notes to the wall, creating a tableau of what they knew about the assassinations so far. He stared at it for long stretches of time, then went back to his phone. He went into his bedroom to make a couple of calls, and by the end of about an hour of this, John couldn’t concentrate on his draft any longer.
“You have good medical knowledge –“
Sherlock to do and he quickly averted his face. Sherlock gave him an amused smile and stole another chip.
Sherlock took a drag of his cigarette, looking at the picture. He remembered the exact moment it was taken. John had cracked a joke to dissolve some of the tension between them. “I thought there were no photographs allowed beyond the official releases?” he asked casually.
She was an accomplished actress. But he found he liked her better when she was like this, more herself, new laugh and all. Perhaps, if she’d simply been who she really was, things might have worked out between them. But he knew her now, and felt only a growing friendship towards her. That was nice, but it was nothing compared to the torture he now endured every time Sherlock glanced his way.
Behind them, Mary was already on her feet. She’d grabbed her gun and in two long strides she was at the large French windows, yanking at the handles.
John couldn’t look away. “What is?”
Sherlock seemed to sense his sincerity. He merely nodded.
“So what happens now?” Sherlock asked.
John’s muddled brain (which suggested that this was not appropriate at all) fought for dominance over the rest of his body (which suggested that no man had the right to sound so sexy when drunk). He wasn’t sure yet who’d won.
John finally shook himself and broke the stare. He’d thought he could somehow use the excuse of alcohol and a relaxed atmosphere to finally broach the subject of their mutual (or not mutual) feelings. If Sherlock even had them or considered them important enough to warrant attention. Perhaps tonight would be a good opportunity to finally find out.
John took a shaky breath and reached for his tea; and hesitated when he saw Sherlock’s face. Now there was no question about what he felt. He looked heartbroken. Another thing John had thought to be impossible.
“Yeah but he’s…”
The water was churning and a feeling of being dragged told John that the explosion had ripped open the pool, slowly draining their precious shield  from them. He gripped onto Sherlock’s arm to steady them, keeping them anchored in the somewhat safe corner.
. He stepped onto the landing and heard John exclaim, “Mary! Oh my God!”
-	“weird names for body parts”
He shifted a little to regain the feeling in his legs and involuntarily leaned more into Sherlock kneeling next to him. He looked up and into Sherlock’s face, half cast in shadows. His heart beat a little faster when he saw the look in his eyes. Sherlock blinked once, his eyes lit only by the glow of the low lights outside on the jetty. A small smile tugged at his lips and he regarded John with a pensive look.
“So you actually have to feed the bees their own honey?” John had his hands clasped behind his back and looked a bit like the Captain inspecting his troops.
He stood in the hallway and, closing his eyes, let his head hang forward a moment. He took a deep breath. Suddenly, he felt someone come closer and he recognized Sherlock’s steps. He was surprised to feel arms around him, but didn’t have the presence of mind to really question it at this moment. John let himself be drawn into a comforting hug. He placed his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and breathed.
John let out a chuckle. “I see. And the key card?”
Sherlock pulled his phone from his pocket and twirled it around as he walked back into the sitting room. “It seems my brother has lost our assassins,” he said, enunciating each syllable with glee.
“Of course,” Greg said, “fine. Whatever. Send me a memo,” he grumbled.
Lestrade eyed Sherlock thoughtfully and was about to say something when a startled sound came from next to them. A door closed and a nurse came out of the ladies’ restrooms. “What are you doing?!” she asked, quite angrily. “You can’t just help yourselves, this is a hospital!” She took the roll of plaster from Lestrade and gave them both a glare.
Of course he’d realised John’s feelings, purely from observation. Just because he didn’t usually indulge, didn’t mean he was blind. But it was definitely something else to hear it confessed so earnestly.
John gave a huff of a laugh. “But what if Freddy doesn’t want normal?”
Sherlock quickly stepped away from the beds and strolled over to the window. The nurse prattled on in the background, checking John’s vital signs and asking whether he was in pain and about the feeling in his shoulder. She busied herself with gently removing the taped needle from his arm, dabbing on the pinprick with a cotton piece and placing a plaster on top of it.
He didn’t kid himself; the Work would go on. Sherlock had a good idea already where Vivian Norbury had buggered off to, it was simply a matter of narrowing it down enough before he went after her and Moran. Mycroft’s people had been dismayed to find all traces of her, her cottage or her accounts vanished from their systems. Sherlock wondered just how many of Moriarty’s old strings were still being pulled by people in his former spider’s web to make things like that possible. So now Mycroft expected him and John to just hide out in the middle of nowhere, enjoying
John felt his heart hammer in his chest and the blood rushing through his ears. He wasn’t entirely sure what he was doing, but he tugged a little on Sherlock’s hand, freeing his wrist. He slowly inched his hand up so their palms were touching. He had been going to remove his hand. But something in his brain must have short-circuited and he interlaced their fingers instead. And time seemed to stand still all of a sudden.
Sherlock waited a moment before he spoke. “Yes,” he said. “You were under close surveillance for at least a month, probably longer.”
“No, I don’t suppose you would,” Mycroft said, seemingly considering it. “But please, you are visiting,” he said and took a step into the hospital room, opening the door further. Something in his voice sounded incredibly amused.
talk to, and no children.”
“I would have gotten to him, John.”
“What.”
. He looked as if this was just another ordinary day – after nearly drowning, being shot at, and severely stretching the definition of the word ‘flatmate’. Sherlock let his eyes roam John’s bare chest for a second, remembering how he’d looked at him on the boat when he said he wouldn’t be able to stop. John was really a man of very intense feeling. And who knew – apparently, so was he.
John thought of something. “It didn’t make any sense. You couldn’t be dead, because there was no logical reason for you to be dead. Isn’t that what you always say? ‘Eliminate the impossible and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’ And that was the solution all along. You couldn’t be dead, so the truth was—
about John, with his comfy jumpers and tea and his pragmatic doctor’s attitude.
Sherlock to the rescue!
“Apparently, they’re just a regular old retired couple,” he shrugged at Mary’s disbelieving look. “I’ll text you as soon as I dig up any juicy details.”
Sherlock’s head snapped up and he became still.
– and gave her husband a fond look. “That was too easy and you know it,” she chided. Richard merely kissed her in response and John’s heart melted a little for the two of them. He leaned a little closer towards Sherlock and looked over. His hair was mussed and his cheeks pink from drinking the entirety of the sherry by himself. He had undone the top buttons of his shirt and John now found it hard to tear his eyes away.
“It’s not just
He wasn’t sure how long they sat like this. John seemed to nod off at some point, and Sherlock let him, his thumb rubbing slow circles on John’s shoulder. After brushing him off on Christmas Eve, he hadn’t been sure John would allow his advances until he made some bold declarations or explained himself. And he really wasn’t in the mood for long explanations at the moment. All in all, this was
It was not only a matter he had to resolve for himself.
“Yes.” His voice was low and gravelly. “Are
“Lady Smallwood had a communications chief for long range messages; trained in Morse code, shorthand and at least a dozen languages.”
“No,” Freddy sighed. “She apparently took sick leave. But she never told me she was sick, and the last time I saw her she didn’t seem ill at all.”
John sighed. Of course the one bloody criminal they met who really thought of everything was the kindly old lady from next door. Obviously. “What then?”
,” Sherlock managed between gritted teeth. John snorted into his scarf.
Sherlock stilled his movements and John thought he felt him sigh a little. He was afraid that Sherlock would draw back, but the arms remained around him and finally, Sherlock gave a rumbled “hmm” to encourage him.
John glanced up to see Sherlock give her a fond smile. He knew that look now. For all his protests earlier, to Sherlock, Mrs Hudson was family, so of course if she was showering their new relationship with her blessings, that was certainly okay.
Finally, after settling everything with John, the doctor turned to Sherlock. She gave him a quick check-up. When he protested, she quickly silenced him with a certain natural authority. John had to force himself not to laugh at Sherlock’s indignant frown and the doctor’s calm attitude. It wasn’t every day you met someone who was impervious to Sherlock Holmes. She was perhaps a little bit more thorough than she needed to be, enjoying her patient’s consternation. Finally, with a twinkle in her eye, she declared that he was fit to leave as well. John knew from experience that he could have well been out of here the day before; he imagined someone trying to get Sherlock to leave when he obviously had wanted to stay.
And he enjoyed it. He didn’t feel the need to do anything about it right now. He could enjoy that delicious tugging in his chest a little longer and just see how things went from there. But he felt safe, finally, in the knowledge that everything was fine and all right and that he wasn’t alone.
John was still trying to catalogue if he’d injured anything when he was heaved to his feet unceremoniously. Moran pushed him forward and then darted after Mary, into the garden. Norbury took him by the collar and nodded at Sherlock to walk in front of her. There was no more sneering or gloating. They were pushed through the house as quickly as possible, and any resistance John might have thought about was snuffed out when he felt the barrel of Norbury’s gun dig into the small of his back.
“Right. Sure,” John said, trying not to sound too nervous. He felt like a bumbling idiot, not even knowing how to properly put on a bloody dinner suit; and here was Mr Suit God himself, having to teach him. He resolutely turned to the mirror, trying not to be distracted by Sherlock’s stare, and undid his bow-tie, letting the ends hang down. He opened the buttons and began inserting the first stud. He got the hang of that easily enough, so there was no need for Sherlock to interfere.
but what he really said was …
The other people around him were a blur. Sherlock vaguely noticed being checked through and provided with a blanket. Someone led him over to the ambulance and maneuvred him inside, to sit with his friend. His head was feeling feverish and he stared unblinking at the paramedics hooking John up to an IV.
What exploded?
“Yes,” John mumbled. “Well done.” His eyes started drooping closed. “You’d make a great... assistant.”
And then there was nothing left to say. Sherlock placed his hands on John’s shoulders, slowly, deliberately pulling the rescue blanket off them. He stepped forward, his hands and chest and leg gently pushing him against the closed door until there was no space left between them. For the first time, John really noticed how tall Sherlock was in comparison to him. He lifted his head a little to keep eye-contact and what he saw made more heat pool in his abdomen. Sherlock’s eyes were blazing with pale fire. He wore an expression of utter want and complete focus at the same time. He looked as if he was handling the most valuable piece of evidence in a case, stripping it to its core, revealing its secrets. John had never felt so naked before someone. His eyes began taking in everything, burning each feature into his memory forever; the dark curls tumbling over Sherlock’s forehead, the mesmerising eyes with their never definable colours, the flushed skin on his pale cheeks, the slightly parted lips. He felt the hot breath on his skin, mingling with his own.
at him? Enough to catalogue his size and everything? Did that mean something? Or was it just the normal Sherlock x-ray he turned on everyone?
, John said, and his eyes were full of that strange fondness; and how could he still be looking at Sherlock like that when they were dying?
John chuckled, feeling his chest swell with fondness and his body relax a little. “So that’s the reason you’re taking my trousers off, is it?”
. Not only was that terrifying in itself, but he was
type, more of the
that he couldn’t quite define. Some part of his busy brain suggested that after last night this was, perhaps, not the best way to tackle the elephant in the room. John would probably want to talk. But
“Don’t say.. that,” John said, frowning. All the same, there was something in the detective’s voice that arrested his thoughts. His light-headedness was becoming more pronounced every second. He was running out of time. Somewhere in his mind he felt something slot into place. That warm, pleasant feeling in his stomach suddenly turned into a jolt of panic. He realized he didn’t mind dying in Sherlock’s arms, strangely enough, but there was something he needed to say, something he’d been meaning to say, but he’d never found the right time. Suddenly, it
thought and felt and did; he hadn’t accounted for the well of …
John’s eyebrows rose. “Hang on how do you know…? Oh, never mind.” John stared out of the back door again, a gloom settling on his shoulders. He sighed. “It’s just… what are we going to do? Are we just going to stay cooped up in here until they catch him? What if it takes weeks?”
“Oh get a room, you two,” Greg exclaimed and noisily threw his empty cup into the bin.
Greg looked at him, once again trying to decide if the man with the posh accent was being sarcastic or not. “Huh,” he said.
Sherlock pulled John a little away from her, to put some distance between targets. Mary’s form disappeared into the mist and now all they could do was run. They dashed across the beautiful winter lawn, the bird bath and the stupid ornaments appearing one moment and disappearing the next, their feet crunching in the frozen grass. They made it to the first tied-up bush when they heard another shot from their left. Mary must have spotted Moran and fired a warning shot towards the house, not to hit, but to keep him away long enough.
and I never told you how I felt—“ John choked on his words. “And then—you were gone. And I regretted it so much. You were—“
He took a few more steps and fell to his knees. “Sherlock—“ His hands grasped for the coat, his head, his arms, trying to reassure himself that he was fine— “I thought—“
. That you, of all people, couldn’t see what was right in front of your eyes for once. I was concerned about what people thought of you – not because I doubted you, but because you’re important to me and I felt… protective. How did you not see that?”
. Now he was looking and his brain refused to figure anything out. It seemed to actually have left the conversation some minutes ago. He swallowed again, trying to calm himself. “And this is similar for you, then? To… back then?” He tried to keep up the train of the dialogue because he was not at all sure what he would do if he stopped and that scared him.
He slowly disentangled his arm and his body from John, trying very much to ignore the insistent signals from his body that told him to stay right there and, even better, wake up John in a decidedly unambiguous manner.
“You still fell for it, though,” the DI said. “So that means I actually got you for once! Cheers to that!” A satisfied grin spread on Greg’s face and John felt himself joining in.
John was glad to stretch his legs again, and he breathed the clean air with weighty relief. He waited until Sherlock joined him and finally looked him in the eyes for the first time in what seemed like hours. “You can still back out.” There was something vaguely worried in his eyes.
. He had to pull himself out of this madness. He had to remove the cloying sentimentality choking his brain and heart. It was the only way for him to stay sane.
“Can you pick the lock like this?”
John was surprised. He felt reminded of the conversation about ‘that nurse’ who had also been ‘all over him’. However, that memory led him in the complete opposite direction of where he wanted this conversation to go, so he bit his tongue from letting slip a remark in the vein of ‘are we jealous of dogs now?’. It wouldn’t do to start this kind of banter all over again; it would only make Sherlock uncomfortable. He allowed himself a chuckle and looked out of the other window. A small voice in the back of his mind said,
running amok in his mind.
What was even worse though was that he now had something else to occupy his brain during sleepless nights.
“Well,” Sherlock murmured, running out of witty things to say. John’s large, dark blue eyes became his field of vision, the beating of his heart an electrified rush of blood in his ears; he leaned closer so that their foreheads were touching, his eyes falling shut. He took a breath, tasting John’s breath on it; and as their noses brushed, he heard only the steady beat in his ears and—
John hated it. He hated that Mycroft was right, that if John himself had been involved, he would probably have advised them to do the same thing.
the embarrassment.”
“I’m not Mary’s secretary,” John scoffed. “Why don’t you just send a car round to kidnap her? Or is that no longer your
The steps passed the door. The light of a torch shone briefly through the door; then the steps receded and continued on through the corridor. Sherlock waited until the sound had completely faded before he moved. He slowly let out a breath and relaxed. He felt John’s grip ease, but he didn’t let go. Sherlock looked down at their joined hands, only faintly visible.
Sherlock’s face was not an inch away, and something passed between their eyes. John’s heart beat faster at what he saw: unguarded fear. Sherlock was struggling much more than John, and was beginning to suspect he wouldn’t last until they reached the surface. Unfortunately, Sherlock’s deductions of the kind were usually correct. Fighting the dizziness, John hoped that his army training had somewhat provided for situations such as these.
Sherlock smirked. “Idiot maybe, but a very sufferable one.”
talking about his time working cases with Sherlock. And when he did talk about them, he was slowly, gradually coming to terms with it as the
A distraction seemed like a good idea so he answered truthfully. “Yes, I suppose I do. I never had one, though. Abby was pretty friendly, so that helps I suppose,” he said.
She was short and to the point. Sherlock appreciated it. This would have been a lot more tedious otherwise. “If that’s how you think of it,” he said. “Most people fill an entire room with all the chattering going on inside their skulls; and there’s the twitching, the scratching, the little noises people make because they think they have to make them to remind themselves that they’re
“Oh? Why’s that?” John smirked through a definite blur of drunkenness.
but then he finally stepped aside and led them up to the house. “Well, anyway, deceased was 53 years of age, in early retirement. Left behind a widow, whom you will absolutely
It was one of those comfortable silent evenings. They were just on the couch together, reading. Sherlock spent most of the time sprawled half on top of John or leaned against him, mumbling that he couldn’t help it with being so tall. John conveniently did not point out his empty chair to him, because he didn’t want him to leave. He guessed that somehow Sherlock didn’t want to leave either. In fact, John found Sherlock’s presence so distracting that he ended up not reading a single word of the book in his hands. All in all, a very happy evening indeed.
Cries of
John was hastily getting to his feet and brushed crumbs off his lap. Mary snickered a little. John held out a hand as Mycroft introduced them. “Ah, Doctor Watson,” Lady Smallwood said. “Nice to finally meet you. Love the blog.”
Suddenly, instead of the usual fear of losing control, Sherlock felt only intoxicated with the sensation of
“However, under similar circumstances with no other options… I would have done the same.”
“Oh—“ John said, taking in the coat. “Are you… leaving?” A flash of hurt crossed his eyes.
Instead, Sherlock slid down as well and stretched out his legs next to John. He rearranged the blanket so it was covering him as well and then dragged a pillow under his head. And with John’s body snug against his, he fell asleep in minutes.
“Oh, and one more thing,” Sherlock added. “It’s still under wraps at the moment, according to my obnoxious brother. So… no police gossip, as hard as that may be.”
“We’re just dancing, John,” Sherlock scoffed, but it sounded a bit forced. He would not meet his eyes. John felt minute tremors in the hand that clasped his.
A few hours later, the landscape around them had changed. They pulled off the motorway and into smaller roads and finally country lanes, following the GPS Sherlock had set up. Soon, there was only darkness around them, and the ride became so bumpy that John wasn’t sure they were even on a proper road any more.
Mary actually hadn’t known about the blog, the tabloids, the scandal—she’d read somewhere that the famous detective Sherlock Holmes had committed suicide, but that was it. John was astonished how, after
“I never say this, because I’m… bad with saying things and, and—you know. But you really do help. And you’re good with suspects and children and old ladies and the bereaved and managed to clear my name and—“ Sherlock realised he was rambling a mile a minute. “And you once shot a man for me, nobody’s ever done
Sherlock pressed his lips together tightly, still staring down Mary in a silent battle of wills. Yet slowly, he was coming back to himself, his eyes narrowing, flickering over Mary’s poker face.
Sherlock fixed him with a glare that didn’t bode well. It was his I’m-going-to-find-out-everything glare, the one that made John feel like a deer in the headlights, knowing any kind of concealment whatsoever was pointless.
“You don’t seem surprised.”
When he awoke the next morning, his neck was stiff and he felt uncomfortable from sleeping in his clothes. He disentangled himself from the blanket and groggily padded over to the window. In the pale morning light, he glanced down at the street, waiting for his brain to wake up. He watched the first commuters fill the streets and listened to the silence of 221B Baker Street. After a few minutes, he realised that something was missing.
“I doubt it.”
late, he was relieved to find. He also saw that he had two missed calls and then a text message – from Mycroft, of all people.
He went shopping for groceries, enjoying the brief walk, and when he returned, he found a large garment bag hanging on the sitting room door.
Sherlock’s eyes remained unblinkingly fixed on him. “Might be Mary,” he said quietly.
“Where’s Mary? Huh, I guess you met her, then?”
“He—he killed my mother. I mean—he must have known we weren’t close, and she kidnapped me, even after everything we—and, but, he doesn’t care, does he! He sent me—oh God,” Helen sobbed again.
Sherlock struggled, the water frothing all around him, churning and blinding. He kept a death grip on John’s body; it was dragging him down,
all by himself in his brain to get them over with, predicting what you would say and informing you of the result minutes before you even opened your mouth. The kettle boiled and John took a deep breath. He turned on his heel to get to it, but instead walked straight into six solid feet of Sherlock Holmes.
There was a rustle of fabric. “Mary, you got shot,” John said, sounding stunned.
John huffed a laugh. Then cleared his throat. “Well,” he said. “I guess, yeah. We talked.”
“What?” The detective looked over suspiciously.
“Betting Pool?!”
You’re...”
“What, just… retirement?”
“Your face—“
. No, that wasn’t right.
“Any chance I’ll get to see those?” Lestrade asked him wryly.
“Is that all? I have a fundraiser to attend.”
, by staying when everyone else would have left, by being so unprecedented that it hurt, by being so suddenly and inexplicably indispensable, he had turned Sherlock’s view of people somewhat upside down. Yes, people were still idiots, but John wasn’t people, he was
John chuckled as he slowly sat up to pull his jumper over his head. “Oh,
Sherlock sounded amused. “Probably not.”
Mycroft grinned that creepy knowing smile again. “I know,” he said in that same conspiring tone of voice again. He seemed to be enjoying himself, as if he and Lestrade shared a juicy secret. He supposed they now did.
“People might talk. I don’t care,” he brought out between small gasps, and gave Sherlock a gentle smile. It felt nice, what he was doing with his hand. Perhaps it would have been nice to feel that again. The rumbling in the chest and the warmth was also something he’d miss. The last thing he saw before the blackness took him were two bright eyes staring down into him with shock and worry.
The kiss was sweet and simple and John hoped it conveyed something of what was going on inside him before he broke away. He stayed close to Sherlock for a moment, their noses almost touching.
Sherlock gave him a quick grin and John looked across the aisles of seats again. “Come on,” he muttered and moved forward quickly towards the police’s end of the boat. Time to get out of here. They’d done their detecting and made sure Helen was all right, the rest of it was better left to actual professionals. And he and Sherlock had unfinished business back at Baker Street to take care of.
“I just saved you from their advances, actually.”
“I’ll carry her.” Sherlock nodded at John’s ankle.
“Yeah, yeah, don’t feel bad,” he said quickly, running a hand through his hair. “You’re right, I think.”
“Not quite the view you were hoping for?” The velvety voice roused John from his musings.
He looked at John again, who finally managed to get back to normal breathing and relaxed a little into their situation. “Once the boat is here, we can board it and text Lestrade,” Sherlock said.
“For once, they seem to have gotten it right,” Sherlock replied evenly. He was curiously aware of her way of putting things. Of course Moran had been an

"Yephf, I am!" John managed.
? Because, as far as he could tell, he and John were definitely not
strangulation.” He saw Sherlock practically beaming at him over the corpse and it was more than a little disturbing how proud that made him feel. “My guess is some sort of wire or cable, probably a professional garrotte, though,” John concluded, trying to sound practised, even as he realised he hadn’t done anything like this in months.
John’s eyebrows shot up in surprise and he huffed a little laugh. “No?”
John gaped at the non-sequitur. “Uh… well, yes, like I said: I was worried.”
“Be a dear and take these to your rooms, Sherlock.” Mummy appeared in the hallway, snapping John out of it as she indicated the bags the two of them had just dropped. She wrapped an arm around John and before he could protest or help, he was ushered into a comfortable kitchen. “Tell Father to put the kettle on, will you?”
“You could have escaped already,” Sherlock replied, his voice subdued.
or if it was just a coincidence, running into Moriarty again.
Sherlock talked a little about his family, mostly regaling John with horrible childhood stories about Mycroft. He told him about old cases. He asked about John’s experiences in the army. He asked him about interesting medical stories. One night, over glasses of Scotch, they discussed the psychology of crime, which ended in a heated argument.
Sherlock quirked his eyebrows and gave her an appreciative look. “Mr Blanchard was a civil servant for many years, I take it?”
John nodded.
“What, at spilling your secrets?” John’s eyes danced with laughter now and Sherlock was beginning to really enjoy himself.
Sherlock remained quiet for a moment. He raised his head and rested his chin on John’s head for a moment, still hugging him, and then placed an absent-minded kiss on John’s hair. The gesture was so natural and unexpected that it made John’s heart swell with affection.
“Has your
“Hm?” John was blinking. He’d been staring, fixated on an errant curl resting on Sherlock’s nape. He quickly looked away.
“Why would I be nervous, I’m just making tea,” John replied quickly. “I, uh, the kettle did just... can I...” He looked to the counter past Sherlock, who raised his hand out of the way immediately with an innocent expression. “Oh, yes of course.”
Mummy went back to talk to John. “Oh you’re a dear. Myc’ will take his old room of course and we’re going to have to put Mary in the guest room. That means you’ll have to shack up with Sherlock for a few nights, I’m afraid.” Sherlock felt a jolt go down his spine and he saw a quick glint in Mycroft’s eyes as he noticed it. He wondered whether Mummy, much like everyone else, had given John a suggestive look at that.
The reporters were immediately surrounding the taxi, snapping pictures, shouting questions. John closed his eyes a moment and sighed. His heart was beating faster and faster. A panic he hadn’t known he’d been waiting for was slowly building in him. He took a deep breath to steady himself, but it didn’t work. Sherlock’s hand paused on the door handle. He was watching him closely again. “You’re not okay with this,” he noted.
Sherlock tried the front door; it was unlocked. Before John could stop him, he simply shrugged and went in. John cursed rather colourfully in his head and followed, gently pulling the door closed again behind him. “Sherlock,” he hissed, but the dark form in front of him simply moved down the small corridor without heeding him. Thankfully, the carpeted hallway muffled the sounds of their feet.
They were back in the small office before long, equipped with tea and some croissants which John was devouring gratefully. Mary was also up, her arm professionally bandaged. She shared a reassuring smile with John, also munching on the meagre breakfast. To John, the situation was surreal. The feel of being in this place without really being allowed to leave made it all seem curiously detached. The only real thing, strangely enough, was Sherlock. He was pacing the room, impatiently waiting for his brother. Somehow, his presence grounded John, allowed him to relax slightly. Having been up all night, he was muttering a stream of insults against such regular mortals who thought a good night’s sleep was an excuse not to be working on the case, and John felt a smile ghost over his lips.
someone. John was in a relationship. What the hell had he been thinking all evening? How had he simply forgotten about that very major impediment? He, of all people, had become proof of what he’d known all along: romantic entanglements clouded the mind, they were nothing more than distractions. He had certainly been
“Oh yes?” They stumbled on side by side down the deserted street.
, probably in plain sight. Perhaps disguised? It was obvious that they had substantial outside help, as he feared. He quickly decided that another chat with Miss Morstan might be in order. Perhaps she hadn’t told them everything she knew.
“What?”
“Pretty confident of you,” Sherlock observed.
Sherlock smiled at her. There was something so motherly about her unshakeable belief in him – and John – that actually reassured him. Perhaps she was right about Mary, perhaps it would pass. Perhaps the fact that she was an
Sherlock chose this moment to come in and flung his arms around John’s shoulders from behind, pressing a kiss into his hair. John felt a flush creeping up his cheeks. He was still completely unused to the kind of random affection he was suddenly getting, still only beginning to understand the slow transformation the cold, distant Sherlock Holmes had undergone; so a public display of their relationship was another cause for amazement.
John narrowed his eyes at him but decided he wouldn’t go there. “If there’s something she wants to keep secret,” he began, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, finishing his sentence, “—she’ll tell you when she’s ready, I know.” He sighed dramatically and let himself flop down into the chair, long legs sprawled outwards.
John flinched under the sudden scrutiny. “No. Because what matters is not what I or Freddy wish for - but what’s the truth. And you always get to the truth.” He looked straight ahead of him again, unable to say another word to Sherlock’s face. “It wouldn’t do for him to live a lie, would it?”
“I see,” Mycroft said, and seemed to be saying much more. As usual.
“BECAUSE YOU DIED!” The words burst from John’s lips like a gunshot. He could feel the recoil reverberate through his teeth and tongue and throat all the way down to the pit of his stomach. The aftershock settled in his bones, his fingers gripping the chair.  He slowly turned around and stared at Sherlock, feeling tears threatening to rise.
"What's the matter?" Mycroft smiled politely, face innocent.
“Sebastian Moran,” Sherlock enunciated every syllable with distaste. “He was the one who picked up the pieces after Moriarty was gone. We saw glimpses of him all over Europe. I… ran into him in Serbia,” he added with a dark look at Mycroft.
, John realised, he must have been such a mess. And
Sherlock heaved his body over to his front, but before he could position himself, Moran had picked him up by his coat collar and pulled him upright. “Bunch of whiny faggots,” he mumbled.
“I know what you mean,” Mary chuckled. “I wonder what they’re like.”
. The walk did help. For the first time in days he felt truly clear-headed and so profoundly relieved that he almost whistled. They were safe and a pretty amazing Christmas dinner would be waiting for them when he came back. As Christmases went, he’d had worse.
Sherlock felt a rush of adrenaline course through him. He’d always been able to manipulate people quite well, but this was something entirely different. This was pleasant, and he was doing it because he
It was late. Dinner had come and gone and the five remaining occupants of the Holmes household were draped over various sofas and chairs in the living room, tired and exhausted from a sumptuous meal. Sherlock had to fight the urge to jump up and pace. But he didn’t want to clue the others in that he had solved it. That he was ready to go. So he sat and waited. He wanted to tell John – wanted to hear him say ‘
“Dead. Garden shed,” she said cooly. “Along with his friend from date night,” she added with a nod to John.
John sighed. “Yeah, I think I understand now why Mycroft wanted to get in touch with you. He probably wanted to take you to a safe house.”
and while that was fine by him, he knew he wouldn’t be able to (nor want to) conform to normal expected relationship parameters. Oh, he could sham it, of course – but John would know. And then he’d leave. Despite John’s devotion, Sherlock still believed that to be the most likely outcome.
“What—?“ John let out a startled laugh and looked outside again. And yes, the old woman in the other house seemed to peer up from her knitting only to glance right at them.
Lestrade shifted his coffee cup to the other hand and shook. Sherlock’s brother. That certainly explained the faint resemblance and the instant unwelcome deductions. “Pleasure,” he muttered, and then remembered. “Gregory Lestrade, Scotland Yard,” he said, out of habit.
“You think this… Moran got to Ajay?”
She raised her eyebrows. “Quite.”
“John! I need your medical opinion,” he demanded without preamble. “If you remove someone’s gall bladder, could they, theoretically speaking, still—“ he paused in his speech. One gloved hand was raised to remove the goggles, and he blinked at John, who had turned on his side, leaning on his elbow, regarding Sherlock with a bemused and sleepy smile.
He never thought that John would become his most difficult case to date. He needed to think clearly, and having this soft, warm body sleeping half on top of him, a body that smelled so familiar and so...
been the one to complain about the nurse and the bloody Labrador of all things and, okay, perhaps he was
John thought of himself, standing by the grave, imagining Sherlock only meters away. He thought of his little speech.
After some time, their kiss slowed and they just touched, running fingers over arms and hips and necks, and pressing occasional caresses against a jawline, a nose, a forehead.
. John yearned to go back to that moment in the half-dark corridor, to replay the scene and to take in every sensation the feel of Sherlock’s body pressed against his, the feel of those lips on his, to catalogue it all for future reference, in case this was the only...
,” her friend insisted and took another draught of her cocktail.
“Sherlock,” John said as quietly and soothingly as possible. “Please lower the gun. Look at me. She’s not going to shoot you,” he added with a warning look at Mary. “She’s just worried you might do something stupid. As am I. Please, listen to me, just this once.”
said shirt against soft skin…
John took a sip of his tea. “But hang on a minute... the dog toys and the bed and everything looked so new! Yet her sister said they’d had the dog for years. Have you considered that...” John looked at Sherlock with dawning understanding. “Oh of course you have. There were two dogs.”
) ago when a man he’d barely met killed to save his life. But not from a gunshot or a stabbing or some other nefarious act; no, John had saved him from himself.
She nodded, keeping her eyes locked with his, confirming, knowing he was somewhat on the same page as her.
Sherlock leaned back against the wooden wall and dropped the file on the bed. “So what about her, then? She’s undercover? Sleeper agent? Foreign intelligence? Just bring her in and get her away from John.”
to me.”
The smile grew on John’s lips. He took Sherlock’s hand, carefully. John’s skin felt warm, his hand a bit rough. He slowly ran his thumb over the knuckles and John’s eyelids fluttered nervously in response.
“I bought you an entire suit. You wouldn’t have had matching trousers. Your black shoes will do, however.” His voice was unaffected and casual. John swallowed.
After a while, though, biology invariably interfered. John awkwardly excused himself to the bathroom, leaving Sherlock feeling bereft at the lack of body warmth. He debated with himself whether he should just get up and escape; or if he should wait. The anticipation tingled in his fingers and toes; he was itching to jump up and
But he was tired, so he just let himself be held. A little uncertainly, Sherlock began rubbing circles on his back. John sighed, content. He hadn’t known how reassuring touching Sherlock could be; how much it helped to convince him that he was really alive.
“Who’s there?” the voice sobbed. Sherlock felt John and Frederick move up beside him. “It’s Sherlock Holmes, I was there on the boat, remember?”
After passing what felt like a hundred different offices, Sherlock finally stopped. “This one,” he said, and John stood watch as Sherlock opened the door with the card. There were no guards around, but John had seen a few cameras. “Won’t we be picked up by the surveillance?”
“We’re here, Sherlock.”
. He locked eyes with John, who nodded, his jaw set.
Sherlock watched the grey morning landscape around them speed away into the fog. He felt cold and tired and not at all triumphant at finishing the case. People had died unnecessarily – not something he relished. It made for such messy endings.
“Jealous?” Something akin to hope rose within John’s chest.
It had something to do with bodies, Sherlock thought. The unblemished, sober morning air was clearing up some of the fog in his head and he looked at John. Really looked. And he realised that having felt that body so close to him, so intimately entangled, changed his perception of it forever. He had studied and analysed it in the time that John had lived with him to the point that he’d already felt more at home with John than with any other person’s body. But having felt it wrapped around him, focussed on him… pliant in that hazy morning softness, less controlled than John normally stood or sat or walked… it was new. It merited further study, probably.
, that was definitely a terrifying thought. To have been allowed to snog Sherlock Holmes, to find out that it was everything he never dared imagine and more... and
“Oh! I read that one,” Mary said. “It was one of the early ones, wasn’t it?”
To his shock, Mary didn’t run. She squared her jaw and flattened herself against the wall on the other side of the stairs. John had no time to argue and held his breath when the steps came closer. Mary gave him the faintest of nods and a look that he interpreted as ‘go first’.
Sherlock pointed to the various containers he had assembled in turn. “Fibre from a hospital bedsheet,” he began. “Traces of linoleum cleaned with that cheap bulk-order chemical they use to clean here; traces of disinfectant they use on the equipment.”
“So. Seeing as you’ve come explicitly to alleviate my boredom, let’s get to it,” he drawled. Lestrade grinned and slid the folder over.
He, again, wasn’t entirely sure how, but he had surprised the hell out of DI Lestrade, who had shown up some hours after the incident. Lestrade apparently had been woken up in the middle of the night because of the emergency, and some part of Sherlock deduced that it wasn’t because he was investigating it, but because there was a standing order to inform him of any and all trouble concerning Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.
Sherlock’s hand had stilled and he felt as if he was suspended in time behind John. He had stopped breathing for a moment, which made John turn around slowly. He locked eyes with Sherlock, both of them half-asleep and way too drunk to really think about
John smiled and caught the hand; he pressed a sleepy kiss to it and then let Sherlock lead him to bed.
He remembered the last time he’d gotten shot in that very place and quickly considered the possible complications due to the previous scars. He was, simply put, worried. Realization set in that if they weren’t found soon, he would not survive this.
Sherlock was still stubbornly sitting at the other end of the room, staring at his laptop, an untouched glass of sherry by his side. John glanced over a few times but decided to leave him alone for now. He was obviously working on the case, and whatever he did, he wasn’t exactly discussing it with John.
“Yes, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock said and gave her a quick peck on the cheek. “Finally back in the game,” he added with a wink.
Surely, if Sherlock did not understand this… then how could he ever feel as John felt? Or understand how anyone could feel that way about him?
At St. Bart’s, Mycroft checked in with the team and got an idea of the situation. One of the men from the attack had a broken wrist and dislocated shoulder; Sherlock had not taken kindly to him choking John. Mycroft was reminded of the CIA man he had worked with during the whole Irene Adler crisis, who, as far as he was able to find out, had literally been thrown out of the window at Baker Street after holding Sherlock’s landlady hostage. He marvelled once again at the extreme emotions Sherlock’s close friends could provoke in him. Everyone always thought he was cold or restrained, but he was the exact opposite.
Mrs Hudson returned and smiled at John. “Well, that’s better, dear. Care to give me a hand with this one?” She gestured at Sherlock, who seemed to have trouble focussing on anything or anyone.
They stood on the kerb for a moment, regarding each other. John drew his jacket closer around him and stuck his hands in his pockets to stay warm.
“Didn’t you want to leave those here?” Mycroft’s umbrella was pointed at the folders under Lestrade’s arm. “If you’d like, I can keep an eye on them. Make sure nobody unauthorized gets their hands on them.”
Sherlock smiled rather genuinely and John wondered what they’d talked about at the docks. “Yes, you were,” he said and sounded, for the first time, actually grateful. Always full of surprises.
He felt hot under his collar and the irrational urge to hold John again bubbled traitorously in his chest. He valiantly swallowed and tried to keep up. Father kept explaining the intricacies of beekeeping, but Sherlock was only half-listening; half of his attention was focussed on watching John, cataloguing the fact that they were, apparently, not only best friends, but
promising to buy me ‘all the drinks’?”
John smiled and with a quick movement, flipped Sherlock on his back, angling himself over him. “Because, my dear Holmes, as you well know, I care what people think. And they think you’re some unfeeling sociopath – as you keep reminding them.” He tangled his fingers in Sherlock’s hair and gently brushed his thumb over his forehead. Sherlock was still frowning in confusion.
From the sound and distance and velocity…
John held Mary’s hand as they wandered around the art gallery. They looked at the different pieces, read some leaflets and listened in on one of the guided tours. It was… nice.
Sherlock studied Mary’s face. “Indeed. Dull,” he said, but he sounded thoughtful, rather than insulting. Mary’s eyes snapped to his, her eyes burning.
“How long are you on sick leave?”

John looked at Sherlock, who was busy texting. “Sherlock!” he chided, exasperated. “Did you see the… that
She left him to it and disappeared to the kitchen. Finally, he dragged himself inside as well and helped make breakfast, something that seemed to amuse John to no end. For some reason, he kept mumbling something that sounded like ‘lazy git’ a lot, but refused to meet Sherlock’s eyes. Father got out one of last summer’s honey pots for breakfast. John was delighted.
“Yes, fine,” John breathed, his chest heaving with a small measure of relief. Finally they were alone and no longer in the firing line of that madwoman. He just wished he had his hands free so he could check Sherlock over for injuries. “You?”
John had absolutely no clue who he was supposed to be; so far he knew he was still alive and probably a woman, even though the question whether or not he was
,” he added with an exasperated glance at Sherlock, who’d been about to interject, “—have to do with Mr Blanchard? Or are they just catching up on their to-do list while they’re in town?” It still made more sense to him that someone wanted to murder him rather than Mary. However, there was something she wasn’t telling them. And the image of the red dot on her forehead kept cropping up despite his best wishes to bury it.
Sherlock suddenly twisted out of his grasp and took a step away. He ran his hand down his neck, the nervous energy that had filled him all day overflowing. “It’s got nothing to do with honesty, don’t be so melodramatic,” he pressed out. “It’s
Suddenly, he tensed. There was a change in Sherlock’s breathing and then a rustle of fabric. The covers moved and Sherlock sat up with a start, calling his name.
Sherlock groaned at the pain that spread through his body from the impact. He scrambled off of Mycroft and crawled over to where he thought John lay. “John…” he muttered. His thoughts were haphazardly pinballing through his mind.
Sudden sounds made him freeze. Steps. Someone walking. Someone moving something heavy. Low fragments of speech drifted up towards the roof.
John stumbled forwards before he even knew what he was doing. He let his eyes drop to Moran for a moment, but the man’s eyes were open and unseeing, his blood quickly darkening the frozen ground.
He barely noticed that he had stepped closer. Suddenly, he was almost chest to chest with John, who glanced up with a worried look. He saw his tongue poking out briefly, licking his lips. An unfamiliar heat grew in Sherlock, working its way up from his stomach through his throat, catching his breath; his heart beat faster and his skin felt flushed. Some still sober part of his brain catalogued all of these sensations for later examination, but otherwise… there was something inescapable about his body taking over from here. Somewhere in the recesses of his mind palace, a certain shelf cracked and tumbled to the ground, evaporating into simplicity.
“Pardon?”
, he reminded himself and kept quiet.
Sherlock and Mycroft combine notes on the case.
. Oh, and if the two of you are ever looking for,” she winked again, “a bit of fun, you know how to reach me.” She brushed her hand over John’s arm, lingering. “Merry Christmas,” she breathed and blew kisses at them both before she dragged her unwilling date back through the crowd.
Sherlock looked a bit surprised. “Do you know, I actually never bothered to find out. Probably
“Good night, Margaret. Thanks again for the lovely dinner.”
A smile curled on Sherlock’s lips as he made a guess. “What, did you think I sprang from my father’s brow, fully formed?”
“Yes,” Sherlock managed, blinking. “Good. How was your date?” he asked.
“They were clearly either intended for her or for someone who used her clearance. But anyone who would do that more than once or twice would surely trigger alarms or raise questions.”
Sherlock chuckled, rolling onto his side to look at John. “I agree.” He glanced at the muscles in John’s arm, how they were stretched taut and strong. He took in the scrubbed skin and the clean scent.
meant to you. And I couldn’t allow myself to be wrong about that. Anything but that. So you had to be dead.”
John narrowed his eyes. “Naturally,” he said drily and saw Sherlock’s mouth twitch again.
"Them? John is with her?"
When John returned to the sitting room, dressed and furnished with a cup of tea, Sherlock was still at his laptop, completely immersed. He looked like he hadn’t even moved, except that he was also using his own laptop to run some sort of analysis or search.
; he supposed that was an accurate description. It raised another question. He frowned. “Only two missed calls and one text after what she must have realised were the two of us in hospital together… she can’t have been very serious either, John.”
John glanced over at him. “As far as I know,” he said.
Sherlock turned to John, looking a bit lost. “John—“ he began, but then stopped. John suddenly stood completely still, frozen to the spot.
He tried what he thought was his best ‘
John wanted to snap at him, to tell him that his faith in Sherlock should have never wavered in the first place, but he knew how officials and rules and regulations could get in the way of honest gut feeling. He blamed Sergeant Donovan a great deal, but he had forgiven Greg.
Sherlock propped him up as best he could, shaking him gently in his arms. “Hey. John. Hey. Don’t sleep here. I’m not carrying you.” Oh, who was he kidding, he’d probably try if he had to.
He pulled on some pyjama bottoms and a t-shirt and padded sleepily into the bathroom. After a quick morning ritual he continued into the kitchen, yawning. He blinked in surprise at the two cups of tea on the kitchen table. Sherlock never made tea for him – or for anyone. At that moment, Sherlock walked in from the sitting room and his eyes met John's with a mild expression of pleasant surprise. He generally seemed completely bemused as to how much John slept, and whenever John tried to tell him that six to seven hours was not above average, all he received was an indulgent smile. It seemed that Sherlock would forever believe that John must surely be having him on, and was therefore always pleasantly surprised when John eventually
“But wouldn’t it be better if I was—out of the way, it would all be over and Freddy would be free,” she reasoned, sounding hopeful. Grasping at straws. And that wasn’t a good sign.
John frowned. “That seems a bit unlikely.”
It was becoming late now. John stood by the window, watching the street like a hawk for taxis or greatcoats to come swirling around the next corner. Nothing.
“Whatever you need—” John mumbled. He felt himself being gently leaned against the wall. Sherlock’s other arm rested on his shoulder now, and he dipped his head. John angled himself so that he could look up. His breath caught again as he became completely overwhelmed with the sight. Dark lashes moved slowly closer and John felt the gentle press of Sherlock’s nose against his skin before finally, soft lips met his.
in it, ever since he came back.
Mycroft acknowledged him with a brief nod. His eyes skipped over his appearance, and Sherlock knew he knew exactly what the sleeping arrangements had been the previous night. He pressed his lips together and looked away from John.
If John had thought that everything would just magically dissolve into perfection, he’d have been wrong. As it were, he didn’t think that at all. The cab ride home was quiet, except for a calm discussion of the case and where they stood with Moriaty still on the loose. Sherlock, who had done nothing but surprise John in the last forty-eight hours, surprised him once more.
“She’s being seen to. Nothing major,” the man nodded at Sherlock. “She was on the other side of the building, it seems.”
John sighed, feeling a heavy weariness drape around his back. “This is good,” he murmured.
“Somewhere we can keep under surveillance, with a bit of countryside around it.” Mycroft continued, pretending to be oblivious to Sherlock’s change in posture.
Sherlock straightened up again slowly. Avoid sudden movements. Don’t give the man an excuse to shoot. When he stood, he noted John had moved a little closer. A warm hand stealthily found its way into his. He held it tight and squeezed reassuringly.
John felt that his words had once more strayed into
Fun Fact: Whilst I can't find a reference to this cocktail on the internet, this is actually something I've seen IRL, albeit in a German cocktail bar. So it may seem contrived, but... XD
“You never struck me as someone who wanted
“Anthea? Ferguson?” Mycroft stood, wincing. He gently shifted his weight so he favoured one leg.
“At around 4:30 this morning.” He quickly held up his hands and rolled his eyes. “Don’t worry, I knew she would be awake. Just confirming a few things.”
“Oh, she’s very resourceful,” Sherlock said. “And it’s dark. I think she’ll manage to avoid Moran, yes. But Mycroft already knows where we are and the cavalry is surely on its way.”
He felt her shoulder press against his. He could smell her perfume. Her hand was soft and warm. She was pleasant, in every way. Sherlock, on the other hand, was pretty unpleasant most of the time. Harsh and angular and contrary and different and practically mad—
Sherlock waved an arm and banged it sloppily into the backrest of the sofa. He rumbled something about sleeping wherever one wished and abruptly sat up. He swung his long legs off the sofa, overshot his balance and nearly fell over the other way. John caught his hand and helped him to sit up, kneeling by his legs. It was such an intimate position, and everything was still pleasantly blurry and nice and he ran his hands over the long thighs…
“I never thought about your parents before. You never mentioned them. Oh God, are they… still alive?” John asked, tempering his laughter.
“Oh, and I suppose you weren’t just waiting for me to make stupid mistakes so you could point them out?” John laughed, and Sherlock found himself joining in.
When John awoke, he was alone, in Sherlock’s bed. Unfortunately, he was also utterly sober by now. The drunk abandon of the night before had faded completely, as had the soft, hungover sentimentality of the early morning. He sat up, holding a hand to his head. Intense embarrassment swept through him. A million thoughts pushed through his aching head. He looked around. Through the drawn curtains he saw dull light and heard the noise of the street. It was probably sometime in the afternoon. He hadn’t slept this long in ages. Not that he felt exactly refreshed or rested.
Mr Blanchard’s body was draped at an unnatural angle over one of the sofas. “Nobody touched anything,” Lestrade said as they came in. “We did preliminary evidence and DNA swipes, but so far there’s not much to be found.” He nodded to a single forensics team member who was carefully scratching a few fibres of the rug into a plastic bag, looking a little forlorn without the rest of the team.
“Well,” she said, as if weighing how to tell him. “I wouldn’t mind the boyfriend bit, in fact, that could have been lovely. But I don’t think that is what you can really give me right now. I also think it’s not really what you want anymore.”
. – SH
Sherlock sighed. “I did not think you’d be so concerned. I just needed some space to think and ignored my phone. I didn’t mean to worry you. I thought you’d appreciate the solitude.”
Sherlock stood very still in the middle of the sitting room. Somehow, they had gone from dancing (actually very pleasant) to fighting (not pleasant), if that’s what it was, to… this (gut-wrenching). Sherlock blinked, staring after John. He hadn’t meant to brush him off like that at all. Had he? Did that mean that their…
He gently nuzzled Sherlock’s hair with his nose and allowed himself to press a chaste kiss on the detective’s head. And with several new realizations in his mind, he went back to sleep.
. He was reminded of. So this meant… Did it? Sherlock’s thoughts sluggishly connected the dots and finally completed the picture. “
… that ‘Richard Brooke’ was
Suddenly, John tensed, unsure of what was happening. The blanket seemed too small, the bed too confined; Sherlock was too close, and John was too tired to deal with it.
on the matter. He cringed at the word.
Everything was suddenly so much more complicated than before. He couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment when things had changed, but… if he was honest with himself, it must have started before the Fall. But that was just him. Right? Sherlock was sure that John… well, John felt things for him. Strongly. But
Sherlock’s lips quirked up in a smile. “Yes, I suppose I will,” he said, and walked off, ignoring Lestrade’s wry grin.
When he started to hail a cab, John grabbed his arm and pulled it back down. “Wait,” he suddenly sobered. “Are we—I mean, can we just go out like this now? People will see you! Isn’t this all still under wraps?” John looked around, eyeing the people in Baker Street suspiciously.
His steadfast conviction to leave things as they were began breaking down just as John was waking up. For a second, he panicked, and tried to scramble away, but the other man had already opened his eyes. Blinking in the light and shifting a little, John fully noticed Sherlock reclined next to him. He was bent over him still, leaning on one elbow, the other hand resting on John’s chest. Too late to run.
And jumped after her.
He grabbed his clothes. “Yeah. Okay.”
Sherlock’s mouth twitched and stifled a laugh. “I was simply conveying my impatience. She was clearly taking too long to remove your needle. It literally takes a minute, I did it myself last night,” he added, for good measure.
, after all?
“Jesus, this looks like out of a magazine,” John whispered.
“Yes?”
For a second, he saw a murderous gleam in her eye. He’d gotten under her skin all right, but it wasn’t enough. She wasn’t one to make a mistake this far down the line. She swallowed and straightened her shoulders. His heart sank.
Sherlock finally smiled. A brilliant, satisfied grin spread over his face, and he nodded. “Sounds good to me,” he said.
“What?” Sherlock looked irritated now.
After them, Margaret stepped on board and closed the hatch. She made her way up the small steps in the back towards the captain’s cabin. John wished he’d taken his gun that morning, but at the time he thought they were only visiting with a client. He made a mental note not to leave it at home in the future, even if they only went grocery shopping. When you were with Sherlock Holmes, cases had a way of dropping on you unexpectedly.
The only thing that registered outside of them was the woman, gently placing a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “He’s gonna make it,” she said. Sherlock’s eyes snapped to hers and he glanced her up and down quickly.
Sherlock could count his eyelashes. John’s head was still tilted up invitingly. Their hands had become entwined somehow, and Sherlock didn’t care when or how.
“Why let me do it now? Why didn’t you just send me regular updates each week to torment me?”
, for not seeing you properly.”
John nodded and glanced around the bench towards the main hatch of the ship, waiting for the thieves to cart in their load.
“Right,” John got up. “I’m sorry I—“ He looked at Sherlock, and Sherlock wondered whether he could see the rising panic beneath the calm exterior. “No scratch that, I’m not sorry I barged in. I’m glad I know now.” His fist clenched a couple of times. “I’ll let you get on. Good night, Sherlock.”
“Well,” Lestrade said after a moment. He had eyes, of course. He’d seen the two of them together on crime scenes. He’d heard the occasional rumour. This was dangerous territory.
Immediately, Sherlock’s head snapped up, his piercing eyes searching Mycroft’s face. "Why?"
– we always agreed on this!
Twenty minutes later, Mycroft stepped out of the bathroom, dressed in immaculate pyjamas and a dressing gown. He took one step and then halted when he locked eyes with Sherlock, sitting on the leather sofa in the sitting room. He still hadn’t been bothered to put on more clothes, but he sat as straight as if he was wearing a three-piece suit, his elbows resting on his legs, his hands steepled before his chin. He was regarding Mycroft coldly, his eyes narrowed.
“Still... here,” John muttered, pulling a faint smile despite the throbbing in his arm. “Cold though.”
“Never mind the rent,” he interrupted. “You took a leave of absence?”
“You lied to me once like this.” His voice was hard, now, nearly breaking. “You made me believe you were cold and uncaring and that you loved nothing and nobody in the world. I know better now, Sherlock. I won’t fall for it again. So you can stuff your excuses—“ John realised he was gripping Sherlock’s arms and had walked him towards the bookshelf. He took a deep breath and let go. He turned and walked a few paces, then rested his hands on the back of an armchair. A deep sigh heaved through him.
“Ah! Good, you’re back,” Sherlock said as John put away the food and milk. “You should try this on.”
Sherlock looked at him. That was... entirely unnecessary, intrusive and sentimental and... “Thanks,” he managed.
“Ah, yes, thank you,” Sherlock said happily, and as he handed John a glass, he murmured in a low voice, “John – Ricardo. One of Mycroft’s.”
“We need to get out,” he managed. He went to his knees and slipped an arm under John’s good shoulder. John winced with the effort, but with Sherlock’s help managed to get himself on his feet. Slipping on the wet and bloodied floor, they stumbled together towards the nearest intact looking door, both coughing and gasping for air. They both pulled their sodden shirts over their mouths and noses against the thick smoke and tried to keep low, Sherlock supporting John as they made their way through piles of sizzling debris towards a corridor with an exit sign. Thankfully, the fire escape at the back of the pool was not blocked. The door had been blown clean from its hinges and the air was pulling at the smoke inside, drawing it out.
Suddenly, that wasn’t just a random comfort anymore, it became an interesting fact. “This is something you perfected, isn’t it. For your job,” Sherlock said to the window. He didn’t specify
“No, shut up, it’s fine,” she waved off his excuse. “I mean, seriously, are you all right? You’re…
these things after your ‘death’, trying to figure it all out? I couldn’t find an explanation.”
Sherlock moved his head a bit closer, resting it against John’s hair.
“You’re going to be disappointed.”
John licked his lips. “I’m sorry for shouting at you, earlier.”
Mrs Hudson scoffed. “So? She’s not you,” she said, pointedly taking a sip of her tea.
He glanced up to see Detective Inspector Lestrade come towards him, grinning. He pulled a face and the detective laughed. “No, just something to get my hand back,” Sherlock muttered, and Lestrade took a look at his arm.
Sherlock leaned in closer, close enough that John could feel the warmth radiating off him. “Look who it is,” he smirked.
John’s eyes darkened. “If I had finished my job there, none of this would have happened.”
A happy little family hideout.
“Hmm. It seems I have underestimated the importance of these men. Somebody clearly needs them for something, or they wouldn’t have bothered getting them whilst they are still injured.”
“Oh my God.”
There was perhaps a tension in the elevator at Danby’s that might not have been there before. Perhaps it was all in John’s addled mind. The problem was that he was fairly sure Sherlock could actually, truly, hear him think. And he was thinking a lot, and loudly, especially stuck in a small box with Sherlock for fifteen floors, imagining being pressed against the wall by his body again.
, of course,” he explained, and when he spotted John’s clueless look, he added with an eye roll, “black tie, John.”
Harry was nursing her fourth drink that night, whilst John was still cradling his first pint. It slowly grew warm and stale under his palms. His arm was still in bandages from where he had broken it the month before, chasing someone through the streets. A lead. A criminal. It didn’t really matter. And on some subconscious level that he tried not to think about, John knew that had Sherlock been with him, he would not have been injured. He would have paid more attention, been more alert, and most importantly, been too busy watching Sherlock’s back. The irony of the situation left a bitter taste in his mouth. He had tried to do it all again, but it wasn’t the same on his own. Obviously.
“I, um— no. Sometimes, uh, on cases, it’s these little things that make a difference…” John hesitated. He had grown used to
John could just about see him smirk faintly as he strode up the stairs with his impossibly long legs in front of him, often taking two at a time. “I thought he was a waiter,” John said, hurrying after him.
Mary scoffed, and John had an errant thought that she and Sherlock had a disturbing amount of things in common.
“Mr. Rodney, my name is—“
“Plenty of space,” Sherlock muttered absent-mindedly, gesturing to the bed, but John could see a slight pink tinge to his cheeks.
The next few hours after they reached their destination were spent with the painstaking gathering of
John leaned back and sighed again. He wasn’t a clever detective, but he knew people. He understood why Sherlock lashed out and wasn’t angry with him. Well, perhaps it was better to give him some time to figure it out. John tidied away the dinner cartons and then went up to bed.
from earlier faded into grey, a strange white noise he hardly thought of now. All he knew was that suddenly, Sherlock shifted and let his hand rest on John’s head, clumsily rubbing his fingers across his scalp. The sensation sent warmth through him and he leaned back, sighing contentedly. He felt his eyes close and everything spun a little in the darkness.
“You’re too romantic. And Freddy is old-fashioned.” The tapping resumed.
“Yes,
Sherlock’s head snapped around and he regarded Lestrade with a small frown. He didn’t appreciate other people getting nosey and involved. Especially when it came to things he didn’t like being honest about.
“Why?” He valiantly tried to cling to whatever he considered ‘normal’, hoping to not lose the last shred of his dignity by chickening out of a promising date with a wonderful woman.
Suddenly, the knowledge that nothing would stop them shot through him. The promise of how far they could go was threatening to overwhelm him with a need he didn’t know he was capable of experiencing. Sherlock did not pause. His nimble fingers impatiently took over for John. He began trailing kisses down his neck as he unbuttoned his own shirt, and John couldn’t help another small moan escaping his swollen lips. He felt Sherlock grin on his skin, and when the shirt finally was worked free of Sherlock’s trousers, hanging open, John found that his hands automatically slipped under it and were now touching the bare skin on his back, soft under his fingertips. It was enough to undo him completely. Sherlock began working his way back from his neck across his face back to his lips.
“Right. Chinese?” John nodded. “Right,” Sherlock said again and dug his phone out of his pocket.
After a few minutes of silence and quiet breathing, John finally spoke. “I feel like a bloody teenager again,” he muttered.
“Yes?” Sherlock said in greeting and stood up beside John, straightening his creased jacket.
John turned to face her. In the dim light from the street he could see a soft sheen of sweat on her face. Her eyes were wide and her jaw set. She grabbed both his arms and her gaze swivelled back towards the entrance of the alley every few seconds. "I'm so sorry," she said, and regret flitted across her face.
Sherlock’s face was becoming grim. “Perhaps her phone ran out of battery?” he suggested completely unconvincingly.
“It’s good to meet the man who’s keeping an eye on our boy.”
The doctor nodded. “And to you,” he said, looking genuinely pleased and then quickly left before things became awkward.
Sherlock walked over to him and wordlessly took up post by his side. He wondered when Mycroft would finally take him aside and tell him what he was here to tell. He was clearly waiting for something. They both stared over the wintery landscape for a little while. Mycroft wasn’t wearing a coat, but then again his three-piece suits were probably all especially insulated anyway. Sherlock held out his hand, which contained some of the biscuits he’d grabbed.
John’s eyes widened. Sherlock let out a breath. He couldn’t tell him how he felt, because he hadn’t quite figured that out himself or, for that matter, what words applied to it. Not yet. But whatever John’s feelings, Sherlock, whether he wanted to or not, returned them. Without thinking about it, he had accidentally proven it beyond a doubt.
Sherlock waved his phone to indicate some research he’d done online. “The auction house, Earnsfield’s, was not involved on the surface of things. However, I remembered reading a name in conjunction with the case, so I looked it up. The stolen goods were antiques, mostly decorative items or furniture. They had been appraised and were ready to be sold by a rival auction house, Danby’s. The woman running Danby’s is called Margaret Fletcher.”
It did. Images of John on their first day together flitted through Sherlock’s mind. He had them all neatly catalogued and stored away; in the months he was gone he had to force himself not to dwell on them too much, lest he lose his focus.
“Stand up,” Moran growled, pushing him backwards against a tree.
"I've been keeping tabs on Dr Watson," was the first thing Mycroft said as soon as he and Sherlock were alone.
Mary had rolled sideways off of Sherlock. She was holding her side with both hands, panting rapidly, shivering. Her face had gone deathly pale, sweat sticking strands of her hair to her forehead. John quickly assessed the angle, guessed where she’d been shot and knew that it wasn’t good. His battlefield training kicked in and he patted his jacket for anything—
John quickly stopped himself when he glanced over. He sobered a little when he saw Sherlock’s sour expression. “What?” he said.
“I’ve never seen him before. Really. And I don’t know who the sniper could be, either. Perhaps Ajay hired them.”
Sherlock asked.
Greg took a breath. “With you. There was something in your statement you... omitted this morning. Something irrelevant to the case, but I noticed you editing the story while you told it to me.”
“Oh! Definitely,” Mycroft said smoothly.
“It is,” Sherlock replied calmly.
about this?” He pulled back a little to look into Sherlock’s eyes. He put a hand on Sherlock’s chest, willing him to understand, and felt a thundering heartbeat under his palm.
“Oh, hello!” She gave him a smile. “Happy New Year and all that,” she said and chinked their glasses. “Enjoying yourself?”
“You’re still in bed,” Sherlock managed, taken aback.
“Well,” John chuckled and he poked Sherlock in the shoulder. “That, my dear detective, might be because I actually do care and empathise.”
Mycroft gave Sherlock a nod that actually approached respect and turned to stride down the path toward John.
Lestrade laughed but didn’t relent. “I’ve never seen you cling to someone so desperately before. And I’ve seen you when you were high, mind you,” he mused.
Her footsteps receded again before either of them could answer. John felt his shoulders slump.
they’d shared had finally kicked all of the physical sensations into overdrive that had been biding their time for the past weeks. These feelings had been growing ever since the pool. Or perhaps ever since John shot the cabbie. It didn’t matter. They were
hovering in the air at 221b Baker Street before.
Sherlock hesitated a moment. “Not yet,” he said.

John’s heart stuttered in his chest, questions swirling in his head.
He grabbed the last bit of courage his brain allowed him and leaned forward. He gently pressed a kiss to the tip of Sherlock’s nose. Sherlock’s face twitched briefly, and then, to John’s intense satisfaction, his lips relaxed into a small content smile. He pulled John a fraction closer and John let him, holding him tightly and dropping gradually back to sleep.
an ordinary living room. Mary was being seen to somewhere in the small, nondescript house, by someone who
It was later than late now. Of the NSY group, only a lightly snoring Lestrade remained leaning back against the wall in their corner. Sherlock was silently pleased to finally have his blogger to himself again. Whilst it had been a surprisingly entertaining evening, he itched to be alone again. Alone at Baker Street. With John. Somehow, he didn’t count as ‘other people’ any more.
“…he did not know exactly
John felt anger rising, his cheeks flushing. “Yes, I know. But I’d have to start somewhere, wouldn’t I?”
. But if Sherlock wasn’t going to
“I thought,” Sherlock began, then paused again in thought. “I thought there was something more to it, that’s all. Something more complicated. But as you say, it would certainly explain his foolish actions.” Despite his words, Greg heard a fondness in his voice.
about it! It had never crossed Sherlock’s mind that anyone could feel so attached to him; moreover he had never thought he’d meet someone as fundamentally crazy as he was. The only difference was, thought Sherlock, was that John was polite and better at hiding it. Also, somehow, John tolerated him.
Just as he was drifting off, a hand brushed gently over his hair, and he heard Sherlock’s whispered voice. “I’m yours, too.”
John and Mary made it to the second floor before they were forced to make their stand. The only doors around them seemed to be locked offices. Mary grabbed his arm. “There!” she hissed frantically, pointing to a fire escape at the end of the corridor. The steps below them came closer, were already on the first floor, and John knew they weren’t going to make it. “Go,” he urged her. “Run, I’ll hold them off.” He stepped aside, pressing himself against the wall to get the jump on whoever came up the stairs.
“Come on,” he urged, and guided John to a chair. He pulled one of the opposite chairs towards them and helped John to put his feet up before he lowered himself in the chair next to him. Before Sherlock could think too much about it, he placed his arm around John’s shoulders and drew him a little closer. For a second, Sherlock was afraid John would want to talk again, but to his intense relief, John merely let out a contented sigh and rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“I’m glad we got you out okay,” John said, unsure when he should broach the subject of the gun she currently held.
“Oh.”
“I just—“ Sherlock stared at him intently and stalled. He didn’t even know what he wanted to say, exactly. He saw the lost expression on John’s face and decided to go with his guts, for once. He gently touched John’s shoulder and looked him in the eyes.
. Because this is a dangerous business we’re in, especially right now, and—if you
was, and Sherlock found himself hanging on the end of that sentence, begging John to continue, to define what it was that was
“Also there were several possibilities in that moment that would have occurred to me, such as saving ourselves without
“What’s wrong with my face?!” He felt a happiness bubbling up inside him and he was unable to reign it in.
Mycroft glanced at his mobile again.
“He does, doesn’t he?”
“Naturally,” she said. “He guessed from the way the investigation was held, that something had gone wrong during the raid on the embassy.”
It was the plea in his voice that made Sherlock move. His legs carried him forward, his chest painfully tightening. Mary took a step backwards and made space for Sherlock. And then she became invisible once again as everything else faded from view except…
“You really shouldn’t...” He broke off, glaring at his friend. He felt at a loss how to explain to John how incredibly stupid he was for not understanding.
and Sherlock knew he wasn’t going to be fast enough—
isn’t exactly my top priority,” he brought out. Then he blinked rapidly and looked away again. He looked like he was about ready to bolt.
He dusted himself off as best he could, then dressed methodically, occasionally plucking more glass from his hair. He grabbed his and John’s toiletries from the bathroom, then returned to what was left of the living room to look for his phone.
John closed his eyes briefly and winced. “Well… Getting shot wasn’t fun.”
Mary narrowed her eyes at him. “You’re trying to think like him, aren’t you?”
John felt like an icy fist clenched around his heart. There was really only one explanation. He risked it. He leaned around the tree to glance briefly back from where he’d come, and the sight nearly stopped his heart then and there. In the swirling mist, he saw Sherlock, on his back on the frozen ground, lifeless; a flash of red on his chest. Mary lay half on top of him, also very still.
Sherlock ignored everything and went straight to the body, giving it the once over with his falcon’s stare. He was clearly in his element. John stood by and felt a familiar rush of horror mixed with adrenaline course through him. The body brought their bantering into sharp perspective. He felt his own inappropriate elation and, confronted with death again, couldn’t deny how extremely alive he felt. The reality of the dead man’s pale skin, unnatural pose and swollen face starkly reminded John that they were finally back among the living and that he had a job to do.
It was already their fifth date. John and Mary had been to the cinema, several restaurants and some bars over the course of the past few weeks. Once, they’d even gone out twice in one week, which John thought meant good things. After the fourth date, he’d finally kissed her, and it had been nice. In fact, it was all very nice, distracting and pleasant. Mary was lovely, had a great sense of humour and was uncomplicated to go out with.
erupted from the sitting room, but all sounds were momentarily blocked from John’s mind except the small, needy noise he swallowed from Sherlock’s mouth. He felt the soft lips under his, breath tickle his skin, the solid chest pressed against his, and everything else simply evaporated. Despite their heated explorations in the last few days, this still was new and exciting and wonderful in all the right ways.
John reached the top, and Sherlock was already up the concrete wall. It led to a rooftop of what was probably a warehouse. There were some large, convenient air con units and a rooftop exit for cover and you could basically overlook the entire jetty area from up here. When John walked to the other side, he saw the entrance to the container area as well as the street. It was the perfect vantage point.
Sherlock’s lips twitched in a smile. “If it’s the right boat,” he said, trying to sound humble and failing miserably.
“Good for her,” Sherlock smirked a little.
The next morning, John woke up alone. At first, he wondered why that felt odd, until he remembered his midnight visitor. He blinked in the pale motrning light and looked around. He could still see where there had been another head on a pillow next to him, and Sherlock’s scent lingered ever so gently in the bed. So it had definitely not been a dream and he couldn’t have been gone long. John swallowed and brushed a hand through his hair. He was pretty sure he’d been holding on to Sherlock before he fell asleep. He let out a slow breath. Blimey.
“Some people would disagree,” Sherlock said thoughtfully and got his phone out, beginning to type on it quickly. “Some people would prefer to be happy, even if it’s false. Most relationships are built upon it, I believe,” he sneered.
John frowned a little in confusion. “You’re being awfully understanding about this, aren’t you?”
“I love you,” Sherlock said, looking impressed and amazed all at once. Whether he was amazed at John or his own admission, John had no intention of pondering at this time.
He felt Sherlock breathe in and sigh slowly. “I’m not sure,” he said thoughtfully.
When John stepped over and the cab was on its way, Sherlock had to ask. “What did you do?”
“I will tell you everything, but… I am sorry for what you had to go through because of me. I am so sorry. I will explain, I promise.”
Lestrade raised his hands in defeat. “Oh I see, all right – believe you me, I tried getting something out of that brother of yours, but he’s just as nuts as you are. You keep your secrets. As long as it doesn’t get me into trouble again!”
“That’s good,” Lestrade said with feeling. “Say, I know it’s still early, but fancy going for a pint?”
She grinned. “Perhaps we will come to some kind of arrangement, who knows.” She hesitated a little again and sipped her tea. “What about the parents – have you met them yet?”
John smiled, watching them go. He thought back to the conversation he and Sherlock had had in the cab not too long ago. Never in a million years would he have been able to picture Sherlock’s parents; and if he’d tried to guess, this was very far from what he’d expected. A very welcome surprise, indeed. On the other hand, it shouldn’t really surprise him that much; Sherlock could be kind and even gentle in his own way. This was even more noticeable now, since he’d come back.
—“ John broke off and swallowed, his breathing becoming erratic. He twitched his head once, closing his eyes as if he was in pain. His other fist was raised, punched ineffectually against Sherlock’s chest and then curled tightly into his shirt.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “No, I am not. I don’t know what Mycroft is doing, exactly, but I believe he is trying to retrieve them without letting it get that far. But they’re bound to do something now that they’re out, it’s only logical.”
“No.”
John huffed a laugh. “I guess you’re right.” He thought for a moment. “It’s my own fault, really,” he sighed and sat down on the bed. “I always described how brilliant you are and never mentioned the actual medical aspects of the cases. It just kind of seemed…
Sherlock hummed in agreement, knowing the conversation was still not over. Finally, he blew out a long plume of smoke and asked, “well?”
He looked around the flat and took a deep breath. The burning, choking sensation in his throat was gone. It felt as if someone had lifted a heavy load from him and replaced it instead with a softer, keener sense of loss. He looked at the empty chair. “You’re gone,” he said, his voice hoarse. “You’re dead and I… I never told you,” he brought out haltingly. “And now I never will.” This was moving on. And this was also what he’d take with him, a thread that had been woven into his bones and muscle. It was no longer suffocating him, but would be an aching companion with every movement he made from this day onwards. When the tears began to spill again he didn’t stop them.
“Why not? I thought you’d like a holiday.”
During dinner, John coaxed story after story about Sherlock and Mycroft’s childhood from his parents – mostly Father – and was delighted and amused by everything he heard. Sherlock, despite his grumbling, couldn’t help but shoot subtle glances his way, mapping the small wrinkles at John’s eyes and the exact tilt of his head when he laughed. At some point, he caught Mummy’s gaze and quickly looked away as she gave him a fond, knowing look. Oh, it was bad enough with Mycroft dissecting him so easily, but of course she was in on it, too. Thankfully, she refrained from any sneering comments.
happening between them.
John sighed. “I don’t think she was that important to him. I think he just wanted to mess with us,” he said quietly, finally voicing his fears. It sounded conceited in his ears.
He sipped his wine and felt entertained enough by his various musings on his brother and his guests. However, glancing around he spotted the only person he found actually interesting to talk to standing alone by the window. He made his way over to her, greeting her with a smile.
Sherlock glanced up and caught John’s eye. John smiled at him, clearly hoping to relieve him from this tediousness. Well, then.
“It was regarded as an accident at the time,” Mycroft observed.
Sherlock made a noise in the back of his throat. He desperately pressed himself against John as much as he could, deepening the kiss. It was passionate, but also something a little closer to the heart, something that made John’s eyes prickle. It hurt, but in a way he wouldn’t have traded that hurt for anything in the world in that moment.
“Oh, don’t say that,” John grinned. “You never know with people. For all their talk, it’s something else to be confronted with it.”
Suddenly, he had to go. He couldn’t stay in here one minute longer. He felt mortified at having invaded Sherlock’s privacy like this. What had gotten
“A crack shot.” Sherlock’s voice tasted bitter on his own tongue. “As good as you, probably better with a rifle.” At that, he saw Mary’s eyes snap up to look at John in surprise. There was probably a lot she didn’t know about him.
John laughed. “Is that so? And how do you know that?”
“Mycroft?”
Sherlock swallowed as he felt the breath on his cheek. “Yes.”
All he got in response to that was a grumble and a tug, and suddenly, he was just in his boxers. Sherlock let go of him and crawled into bed. John quickly followed, not taking his eyes off Sherlock.
And Sherlock moved and his hand slipped around John’s neck, cool and firm. He pressed his forehead against John’s again. His voice was quiet and calming. “John. Calm down. Breathe. The police are up there, we’re fine.
, and then hobbled outside. Sherlock’s eyes followed him. He could be halfway back to the room by now, starting on undressing John in the elevator. Instead, he had to spend more tedious minutes talking to Mycroft.
? How did you not anticipate that I would
John’s eyes widened in understanding at the name. “Oh.”
, really. I don’t see what her problem is.” He gave John a pleading look and John tried to look as commiserating and understanding as he managed. Sherlock was still watching him, for some reason.
. Lust, desire and intimacy weren’t exactly his area but for crying out loud, he knew a thing or two, right? Theoretically? It was all just simple chemistry, really. He flung himself onto his back again. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he huffed, his breath still heaving as he tried to calm himself.
“Well, if you’re incapable of having a normal conversation like grown-ups, please, indulge in your childish fits whenever you like.” Sherlock grabbed another prawn cracker and crunched on it sullenly, staring at the silent telly.
They came upon a first guard standing by the stairs, lighting a cigarette. John snuck behind him and actually managed to get him in a choke hold before he could make a sound. He dragged him backwards behind the small drinks bar, and Sherlock gave him a somewhat impressed look, eyebrows raised. John couldn’t help it, he felt momentarily smug. However, that also made him careless for a crucial second, and he missed the steps behind him until he saw Sherlock’s eyes widen and large arms gripped his torso.
. His gaze dropped to John’s lips and found a definite smirk there. He quickly focussed on his eyes again, levelling a half-grin at John. “Well, that was not an outcome I’d predicted, but the history of science is full of unexpected results.”
However, John barely took note of this as he processed the scene. His breath hitched a little. Sherlock had taken off his coat and spread it on the concrete roof. He was sitting relaxed, his long legs stretched out, crossed at the ankles, his back leaned against one of the metal structures. The only sound was the vibrating hum of the air cons around them. The only space for John to sit was right there, next to Sherlock, on his coat.
man,” Father added appreciatively and not at all suggestively. (That was more Mummy’s terrain.) Yet that didn’t make it any better, perhaps especially because of his father’s sincerity.
However, there was the matter of his parents to consider. And John. Sherlock did not wish to upset his mother, knowing full well how the whole ordeal of his fake death had taxed her. He also realised that John had truly looked happy to be here, relaxing for the first time in days. And John’s wellbeing was suddenly important, paramount even. Anything was worth doing if it meant John looked a little more alive than he did before. And it was doing things to Sherlock, seeing him like that, realising he was the reason John was smiling again.
Sherlock moved closer to the bed. He wished, once again, that his friend were awake so he could question him about this. Not with words as such, but he wished to look into the puzzling eyes until he found out what he needed to know goddammit.
,” he said quietly.
Greg Lestrade walked down the now busy hospital corridor towards John Watson’s room. He was carrying a paper cup of coffee and a bundle of folders under his arm. Last night had been... interesting. Working with Sherlock was not a very verbose affair. Yet it was fascinating to watch the consulting detective do, what Greg dubbed, ‘his thing’, whilst not distracted by an actual crime scene. He found to his surprise that under these circumstances he quite liked the company of the weird genius. It certainly was an improvement over some of the suck-ups and morons he faced every day at the Yard. Sherlock did have a point about some of them.
“Like somebody who knows they’re getting a promotion,” Sherlock supplied smoothly.
A moment stretched between them, filled only with the soft notes of jazz. John felt the heaviness of his words, the demand, like a weight on his heart. Why did this feel so complicated? Couldn’t they just…?
Sherlock leaned over again, pressing his shoulder into John to see. “His signature move: a self-deprecating forensics joke that is really only covert bragging. Used it on three sergeants already, I heard one commenting on it at a crime scene once,” Sherlock hissed with utter disdain.
“Oh, and he loved that dog, he wouldn’t be parted from him after that, do you remember?”
He thought back to all the times that he had to deny that they were a couple, and the many times he just couldn’t be bothered to any more. It wasn’t like Sherlock ever denied it – but that was simply because he didn’t care what people thought in general. Yes, Sherlock had actually come to stay in his bed in the night to fend off the nightmares, but… surely, a man who had no concept of normal personal relationships had not done that deliberately? Sherlock was an extreme pragmatist, and his behaviour was unusual
. I didn’t think of that one possibility. Because… how could you not tell me, of all people? Because if you didn’t tell me, then I was wrong about the most important thing. About how you… about what I—what
John realised then that nobody he was close to – Mike, Greg or even Mrs Hudson – ever needed to talk to him about it, nor did they seem to want to. They all
, and
Mycroft studied her face. “No, I’m afraid I cannot quite imagine,” he said quietly.
“Come on,” Sherlock said, and let his arm drop back. John turned and saw that his other hand was busy on his phone again. He grabbed his coat and put it on, then grabbed the crutch again to steady himself.
Sherlock filled Lestrade in on the case, and between them, they managed to get a much clearer picture of the situation. They hadn’t known about the apparently personal debt between mother and daughter, but Helen’s ‘disappearance’ coincided with the disappearance of a large number of valuable items. Lestrade assumed this was the last big shipment before Danby’s would close down.
John felt the embers in his veins leap into blazing flames at the touch. He heard Sherlock whisper his name, the exhalation making his skin heat, his fingers flexing where they still rested on Sherlock’s legs. He blinked, trying to calm his racing heart. “Sherlock, come on.” With a creak in his knees, he heaved himself to his feet, holding on to what remained of his self-control. “We’re not sleeping here; Mycroft will never let us hear the end of it.”
“I am not going to be in the clinic for a while. I am... on an extended leave of absence, so to speak.” John looked a little worried. “I’m sure I’ll find a way to cover the rent, I’ve saved some money—“ he began, before Sherlock brushed it away with a wave.
He looked at Mary again. “But why did Ajay think you betrayed the team? When did you stop being… well,
Sherlock huffed a small laugh as if to say,
John pressed his finger into the flat space between his eyebrows. “This!” He laughed and took the scoring sheet. “That’s… 89 points, bloody hell. Totally worth two years of memorising Latin names in medical school, of course,” he added with a flourish and took another sip of Scotch.
“Mary,” Sherlock said.
,” he mocked, spitting out the word. “Bloody tedious, that was. And useless. All so I can find out this son of a bitch is alive from the bloody newsagent’s.”
“Uh, no, I don’t…” Freddy hesitated. “Actually, she did seem rather pleased about something. I didn’t mention it, and she didn’t tell me anything, but she seemed excited or happy, like… like…”
"So what are we going to do about it?"
“Same thing,” Sherlock shrugged as he reached the second floor landing.
John blinked. Then he looked up.
He felt John shift, his breathing becoming more alert. He raised his head from John’s neck to look at two dark blue eyes, heavy with sleep, blinking at him. Sherlock’s lips quirked up in a soft smile. If he could wake up every day like this – perhaps on a bed instead of on the floor, but still – he’d consider it a marked improvement, he decided. He might even sleep a bit more if it meant that he got to feel this strange mixture of contentment and elation simply from waking John. He was being far less strict with himself on account of just having woken up, and... that was surprisingly acceptable. Once again, he marvelled at what John had done to change his mind on things he considered
"I didn't," Mycroft admitted with a sigh, but Sherlock wasn’t able to focus on the strange admission at the moment. All he could think about was that he’d never felt as much as if somebody literally had pulled a rug out from under his feet than he did now.
Sherlock gaped. Never in his entire life, including some very awkward teenage years, had Mycroft ever made any allusion to… Sherlock’s mind whirled before he finally registered the other thing Mycroft had spewed forth.
“A car’s waiting downstairs,” the other man confirmed, and Mycroft turned to John.
“Goodnight Harry.” He nodded at her and then simply turned around and left.
John lowered the paper slowly and waited.
that John hoped very intently wasn’t regret. John usually made jokes when he was with a girl who seemed self-conscious or shy; he knew it would be better if he made them giggle, make them feel at ease. He liked for things to be relaxed and fun after sex, and he knew he wasn’t a half-bad lover, experience being a dependable teacher. But that had been the previous John, who took normal girls on predictable dates and who was
“This from the man who thinks ‘breathing is boring’.” John grinned.
Predictably, Mummy choked up at that, and even Father’s eyes became moist, and that made John’s already faltering voice stop so he could collect himself. Sherlock stared at all of them, simultaneously annoyed and overwhelmed by three people obviously caring so much about something he himself cared so little about. He had wanted to say something scathing, and it lay already on his tongue; but when he caught sight of John’s eyes something in his heart melted a little, shutting him up.
. Realisation settled, coloured with pain once more. “No scars. Because you didn’t actually fall off that roof, did you
spending Christmas with the family
Thankfully, Sherlock was not heavy, and something in John’s panic seemed to give him strength. He felt the weight of the body rolling onto the poolside floor, and wasted no time to heave himself out of the water before his arm gave in completely. He registered the trail of watered down blood he left as he dragged himself next to Sherlock’s body.
Finally, the tension went out of Sherlock’s shoulders and he lowered his gun as well. “Sounds like him,” he conceded sulkily.
, he thought fondly.
“Ammo?” John asked. “What, like munition? Weapons exports or something?”
“I realise…” Mycroft began, but then stopped himself.
Sherlock smiled and thought how nice it was to see John get along with his parents. Him calling them by their first names was charming, he had to admit.
“Standing up, eyes open. Like a soldier, Doctor Watson,” Moran said, and there was almost a hint of grim respect in his voice. His finger tightened around the trigger.
Sherlock startled out of his gloomy reverie. “What?”
Moran dove forward to seize a squirming John. Unfortunately, John had used all his leverage in that kick and now he was rather helpless. Moran grabbed him almost effortlessly by the throat, heaved him up and tossed him aside like a rag doll. He hit a shelf and went down in a shower of books and knickknacks.
Mycroft raised both eyebrows and blinked in genuine surprise. Sherlock smirked. “Indeed I do,” Mycroft stated, overly polite now. “And here I thought I was going to have to give you the old ‘leave this matter to me’ routine.” He frowned. “Apparently you’ve changed your mind about confronting him. Why?”
“What about the other man?” Sherlock’s voice was eerily controlled.
and it didn’t bother him in the slightest. And John laughed next to him and they kept up the banter all the way to the docks and he was happy.
John took another deep breath. He finally threw his other arm around Sherlock and with the leverage, heaved them both higher up on the bed. At least now his legs weren’t dangling uncomfortably over the edge any longer. Unfortunately, he was now even closer to the man in his arms. John swallowed. A soft feeling crept slowly into his heart. He knew it well; in fact he was so familiar with it he’d almost learned to ignore it. But now, with John’s guard down, the long suppressed emotion saw its chance to return with a vengeance. It gripped his breath with a sudden force, stopping it in his throat. His arm felt heavy on Sherlock’s waist, his face inching closer. John’s chest felt like it was going to burst and his eyes were burning with a strange fierceness, watching the man he...
For the rest of the ride, he stayed where he was, and suddenly, speaking seemed entirely superfluous. It wasn’t as if anything had been magically sorted, John thought. But for now, and perhaps when they got home, they could give each other what they wanted, what they needed, and worry about everything else later. A warm anticipation settled in his stomach, slowly turning into heat with every move of Sherlock’s body next to his.
He only sat for a few minutes before his ears were completely frozen and his backside ached from sitting on the cold, hard wood. Yet going inside seemed unacceptable at this point. Luckily, help arrived in the form of his father.
He admitted that he scrubbed up fairly nicely, all things considered. Suits just kind of worked on him, and he was suddenly very glad he was spared the annoying job of having to go out and buy one. The only suit he owned before this was one he’d worn to court dates and the like. This was certainly an improvement. Now he only had to act like he
Sherlock winced. “You are in quite a violent temper tonight, John.”
.” John had expected more annoyance, but Mary simply looked at him, genuinely concerned.
John turned and saw him standing in the door, watching him again. The hair on the back of his neck stood up. “Why?”
, for crying out loud, John stopped him in his tracks. “Okay, but let’s be on the same page here. There are people who saw you already, at home or… in the street just now… you were more than a bit famous not too long ago, you know? Somebody will have noticed.”
,” he mused, and John snorted.
“We are?” John laughed nervously.
, he wanted this so badly, yet—
His chest constricted painfully with the lack of breathing, and a few bubbles of air escaped his mouth before he could stop it. Sherlock had his eyes fixed on John’s face, then on the bubbles. John knew he was thinking hard.
Another silence. “You punched him. And then you kissed that other guy.” She sounded a little bewildered, as if she was sure she must be remembering that wrong.
questions. My husband had no enemies or recent trouble. No mistresses, gambling debts or illicit children that I am aware of.” She enunciated each of these points with clear distaste dripping from every syllable. John felt sure that if there
“We couldn’t have done it without you, John,” he said with a small smile. “Your evidence, the people you dug up, the blog, no less… it all helped a great deal to exonerate him.”
John raised his eyebrows and looked at Sherlock, who rolled his eyes, but nodded his assent. John gave them both a
They brought a coffee for Sherlock, too, and he acknowledged it with a brief nod, before he went back to looking up things on his phone. Molly, being one of the unfortunate people who looked a total mess even after just a few tears, excused herself after that, probably to process things. So John ended up standing next to Sherlock, watching him work.
“Sir!” A handful of men and women in military garb darted around them, helping Mycroft up and checking the windows and exits.
“Can’t it wait until tomorrow?” John yawned. He was finally without a sling and off the painkillers and antibiotics for his rapidly healing wound but still felt tired a lot.
Sherlock finally realised what he’d said. He rolled his eyes. “Really, John?”
”. She must have been aware about some of the scrapes Sherlock had gotten himself into. John wasn’t sure he wanted to know. Despite the numerous attempts on their lives, they were still here, spending the evening with tedious fact-checking. Somehow, even the most boring task suddenly seemed enjoyable, as long as they were together.
On the way back, an older couple greeted Sherlock warmly and John, being John, of course, forced him to stop and make small talk.
Instead of making Sherlock spell it out, Lestrade leaned forwards on his elbows, looking at his friend intently. “You’re puzzled as to why John did it. Why he’d have sacrificed himself for you,” he said bluntly.
John faintly noticed that Sherlock had unbuttoned his shirt and was taking it off quickly. The firelight danced on the slender body next to him. Gently elevating John’s torso in his arms, Sherlock bunched up the shirt and pressed it onto the wound in the back of his shoulder. “There,” he said, before his eyes darted around the parking lot, no doubt looking for anything that might help or a way to attract attention. John knew his friend couldn’t carry or drag him for long, so staying here, keeping him still and avoiding some of the blood loss was their best option. The explosion must have attracted attention, so their hope was in waiting.
John snorted. “Yeah. Probably,” he shrugged with mock-nonchalance, which made Mary choke on her wine. Sherlock glared some more, but John saw the corner of his mouth twitch and he relaxed a bit more into the cushions and joined the game.
True, he was still snappy and to the point, but he didn’t put on an act nor did he actively gallop all over the poor widow’s feelings just because it would speed things up. John was in a constant state of apprehension about his behaviour, so much so that he was easily the most worried person in the room. Mrs Blanchard, by contrast, was a woman of enormous composure; she was in her early fifties and carried herself with dignity that spoke volumes about
Mrs Blanchard swallowed, and John saw that Sherlock was right in all points; particularly about it having been a happy marriage. Despite her impassive demeanour, she was definitely heartbroken about her husband’s death. She took a sip of her tea and then gently placed it back on the table.
Moreover, did he want John to look at him like that again? That look had made Sherlock very aware of certain… indications. He wasn’t an idiot, he knew exactly what was happening, he’d just been successfully ignoring it so far. John was suffering from the same effects – pulse quickened, pupils dilated, shortness of breath and a general... whimsical
Was that only talk? Would John really resign himself to no other companionship, pining after a man he couldn’t have? That thought suddenly produced a certain sense of melancholy. John was a good man, a man who should be loved and cared for. He deserved no less.
, not
But John stepped in and cut him off. “Oh, no. No, absolutely not. I am stopping you right there before you’re going to say something you will regret.”
The girls behind John squealed in delight. “
“Thank you, but it’s fine. Really.” John nodded for emphasis, then took a sip of his tea. He took a deep breath and leaned back. It was the early afternoon and they were back at Baker Street. He hadn’t been surprised to find a black car waiting for all of them as soon as they left the building.
Lestrade laughed and held up his phone. “Don’t worry, these are gift enough for me. Come on, first round’s on me.”
John hummed contentedly and he felt another pang in his chest. Perhaps he should say
He shivered in anticipation, but one last shred of
Sherlock’s mouth tightened into a thin line. “She’s gone,” he said. “She must have known it was only a matter of time. But they’re confident there’s not many places she can go.”

. Was that part of the friendship?
She looked around, grabbed a chair, dragged it over to the bed and sat down. Together, they watched John for a little while, and Sherlock got the strangest sense of calm from her. Her presence didn't bother him as John's previous girlfriends had. She didn't feel the need to fill the silence with empty chatter. She wasn't weeping or near fainting or putting on a bloody show just because people might expect a girlfriend to panic when their boyfriend had a concussion. He vaguely remembered other women in John’s life – Sandra, or something, was it? – that had reacted a lot less understanding when drama inevitably found a way to them.
“Ow! Very well, excellent medical skills and knowledge,” Sherlock smirked. “You ask good questions –“
They remained silent for a few minutes, both quietly observing. Mary had a way of being quiet and unnoticed if she chose, and Mycroft felt that he didn’t want to make anybody nervous today. He enjoyed simply watching.
Mary laughed and suddenly John relaxed. This was actually working, he thought. There was no more awkwardness between them, and he didn’t feel the need to constantly look away or hold himself back, lest she thought he was still trying to flirt with her. But things felt okay and settled all of a sudden, and he was glad to actually have someone else to talk to besides Sherlock – that tended to skew his perspective at times.
Sherlock sat back and glanced at his friend sideways. He must have done something wrong, because John looked completely exasperated. “Wh—“
John eyed them with some trepidation, but there was nothing to it. He zipped up his jacket against the cold, put on his gloves and steadied the torch. He nodded once. Sherlock turned and they carefully made their way onwards.
Whatever else John may have needed to hear at that point was lost in incoherent sounds of pleasure and sweet pain and longing as they stumbled their way out of the rest of their clothes and towards the bathroom.
John paused a moment, then let out a sigh. It was the middle of the night and Sherlock was in his bed, being honest and strangely vulnerable; there was no way he could lie.
Freddy looked around and his comfortable living room. He sighed. “I offered. I’ll be honest, Dr Watson—“
She was interrupted by John and Sherlock sitting up abruptly, sharing a look. “Tbilisi!” John exclaimed.
He looked so worried and concerned and he wasn’t dead… and then John felt himself giving in, and his anger was gone, replaced by something much more fragile. His body was pressed flush against Sherlock underneath as long arms wrapped around his neck, and Sherlock apologized, promising never to leave again. John ran his fingers into Sherlock’s curls and then they were kissing, and Sherlock was kissing him back, mumbling John’s name like a mantra.
John thought over this for a moment before he realised. “
“No,” Mycroft said, sounding put out. “I would love to talk to her about it, but she has practically vanished.”
There was a short silence. “Who are you?”
So he had finally acknowledged the futility of trying to pick up where Sherlock had left off – even though, after the famous consulting detective had been publicly exonerated, the requests for John’s attention increased for a time. Most of them had been newspapers trying to get the exclusive interview with the ‘faithful sidekick’, but John had ignored them all. He solved a few minor cases, if you could call them that. They were things Sherlock would never have bothered with. Boring, simple, uninteresting. But it had been a good distraction, brought in a little money, and John had gotten his arse kicked a few times; so that made him feel a little better. It felt right that he was being punished for letting Sherlock die on him without doing anything to prevent it.
John sighed. “Well, you know…” he waved his head in Sherlock’s direction and gestured aimlessly.
There were some five or six people moving boxes. One woman stood out; she was by the side, coordinating everything. Margaret, no doubt. Sherlock and John used the cover of darkness to make their way to the boat and clambered over the side. As Sherlock had predicted, it wasn’t a cargo ship at all, but one of the city cruisers for tourists. They weren’t sure at this point whether Margaret had bought up a tourist company of some kind previously or if it was simply stolen, but it amounted to Sherlock hitting the nail on the head, as usual. They were pressed against the side of the ship on a small ledge next to the row of sightseeing windows and John grinned over to his friend. “You were right,” he mouthed.
, he thought as the kettle boiled. He brought Sherlock his tea and sat down again. Sherlock put some more wood on the embers and stoked the fire back to life.
John had evidently dressed and gone downstairs when Sherlock returned, so he made his way down to the kitchen as well. He found Father sitting in his usual chair, reading the newspaper. John was leaning against the counter, cradling a mug of tea. A half-eaten croissant lay on a plate before him. He was staring out of the window into the frosty morning, a small smile playing around his lips. And as much as Sherlock didn’t want things to be different, he realised that they invariably were
“He acted out of fear that it may appear like he’d pushed her. So he made it look like she was surprised and killed by a burglar instead, but there is no evidence to support forced intrusion. Also, a burglar wouldn’t hit someone like that in the front of the head. They’d cosh her on the back. Naturally, as he predicted, he’s the prime suspect, having motive, opportunity and,” Sherlock flicked to a specific sheet of paper, pointing, “no alibi. The fitness instructor is lying about him being with her, probably because she suspects he murdered his wife to be with her. I expect the affair will not continue for much longer,” Sherlock added almost as an afterthought. He gathered the papers together and folded them neatly together again.
“Oh please,” Sherlock scoffed. “He wishes. Also that’s MI6. And fictional.
The words were out of John’s mouth before he could stop them. “You can have more than my mere presence, if you like.” His voice was heavy and quiet in the air between them, and Sherlock’s eyes widened another fraction and John was pretty sure he stopped breathing.
“Oh, Sherlock, you need one, too,” Margaret grinned and pointed at the post-it pad. “John, come on.” She got up and fetched the sherry bottle from the cabinet and poured her son a new glass.
John’s heart nearly bolted from his chest. Sherlock stood right in front of him, clad in his coat, looking ready to go out. His phone was in his hand.
Sherlock dropped his still numb hand heavily onto his face where it landed with a satisfyingly painful
But he didn’t. At the sound of John’s voice, Sherlock’s eyes widened a little, and he looked even more anguished than before. A sad, lonely, angry part inside John felt a stab of vindictive pleasure at this.
He wound his way through the pub back to their corner and balanced the pints on the table. Lestrade picked up his. “Cheers, mate,” he nodded and had a drink.
,” he added.
….he was suddenly distracted by Sherlock leaning forward, running a hand up his neck and tangling it in his hair. His forehead rested against John’s and he breathed. Then he murmured, “I know.”
Sherlock smiled contentedly, no doubt realising where he was. Doctor Watson seemed to still be very much asleep. Sherlock blinked and a frown appeared on his face. Now he knows someone else is in the room, Mycroft counted the seconds silently, and now he’s seen me. He chuckled inwards at his little brother’s predictable mood change. Sherlock looked annoyed, his eyes flashing into Mycroft’s direction. Then, he glanced back up at the sleeping John and slowly raised himself on his elbow, careful not to jostle the bed.
Sherlock’s face fell just a fraction, but it was enough for Mycroft.
Sherlock looked back after the cab. “He will do that?”
The elevator arrived and, fortunately for Sherlock, contained a doctor, which effectively killed their conversation.
“You’re in pain. You shouldn’t have tried to go out,” Sherlock said, his voice quiet.
sitting now like a statue next to him as surely as it had through his own; had told Sherlock in no uncertain terms how things could continue if he wanted them to.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Don’t worry, I know your measurements. But you should try it on just in case the man’s an idiot. It was a bit short notice.”
“Definitely Mycroft’s,” Sherlock hissed. “Very convincing, I’ll admit, but I’ve never seen these people before in my life.”
, he scolded himself. He realised he was going to be insufferable to himself for the next few days, rediscovering all the annoying traits of his flatmate and swooning over how much he had missed every single one. He scoffed and tried to focus on his paper.
“ – excellent questions –“ John muttered.
“A crutch.”
Mary gave a satisfied nod. “I won’t lie; I am relieved. I don’t think I would have made it on my own.” Her eyes became harder now, determined. “But if you think I’m going to throw John under the bus, you haven’t bloody
“Apologize? Apologize for what?” Sherlock cursed inwardly. John was too perceptive. He must have rubbed off on him.
Finally, Mycroft sighed. He pulled out a thrice-folded newspaper article from his inside pocket and handed it to Sherlock. It looked like he’d taken it from a London tabloid. Sherlock frowned in apprehension as he unfolded it and the picture came into view.
John shook his head and began walking down the pavement. “Because I want him to make sure our friend actually gets
John nodded mutely. He felt his anger slowly seep out of him. He’d weathered months without Sherlock when they’d been pestering him before. He could weather them now.
John hadn't made a decision this fast since when he shot the murderous cabbie for Sherlock. He didn't even know he could move this quickly. In what seemed like slow motion, he wrapped his arms around Mary and lunged to the side, pulling their heads down. They collided heavily with a building wall, and Mary's protesting squeal was followed by the sharp sound of a bullet impacting into plaster.
“Oh! But he did solve the mystery of Mr. Stephens’ missing dog, didn’t you William?”
Soon, their awful drinks left abandoned on the bar, they found themselves dragging and half-carrying a barely conscious Lestrade out of the pub.
John took a deep breath. “Okay. I see.”
John sighed again. Of course he’d seen this coming. “I know.”
, on a case.” He gestured to Sherlock, who was currently at the bar for the next round.
John grimaced. “I’ve been out that long, huh? Must have been pretty bad,” he mused, with his doctor’s mind beginning to analyse the gravity of the situation. “Hand me my chart?”
“It certainly looked like it.” He could practically
Moran grabbed them and pushed them forward at gunpoint. “God, the pair of you,” he sneered as he drove them on towards the stairs.  His voice was dark and full of annoyance. “Due respect to Jim, he was a genius, but I never knew what he saw in you. And
He saw Sherlock’s cheek twitch with a smile. “I know,” he replied softly, fondness lingering in his eyes. The Sherlock way of saying
John felt Sherlock’s breath against the side of his face. He couldn’t see a thing, but they had to be close. “Good,” he murmured, a bit taken aback. He hadn’t outright said it but the implication was clear. They’d been in tough scrapes before, but there had never been a need to bring it up like this. That alone made it seem oddly real: They might not make it out of this alive.
“I can tell,” John said and smiled back.
“I take that as a compliment,” he said, with a slight incline of his head. They sipped their wine in silence for a moment. Mary was someone next to whom one could stand quietly without it feeling uncomfortable – yet Mycroft remembered that he did have a reason he’d been meaning to talk to her again. There was something he’d been wondering about, throughout this entire case.
“What?” He turned to her. “What’s wrong?”
John twisted his head a little and caught Sherlock’s eye. This was it, he knew. Once they were on the road, it would be harder to find them, harder to escape. If they stayed here, Mycroft knew at least where to look. They had to get away now.
Sherlock pressed his lips together a moment. “My parents. They were out of the way enough at the time,
Sherlock heard John swallow. He sat down on the sofa. “Oh God,” he murmured.
Mary came up the stairs and knocked politely on the open sitting room door. “Hello boys,” she greeted cheerfully and came over to John. She sat on the armrest of his chair and leaned down for a quick peck on his head. John smiled at her. He liked the atmosphere of brisk optimism she brought to a room – it was also a reason she made a good nurse, he thought. He felt Sherlock’s brooding eyes on him and wondered how he had ended up with two so different people in his life. He tried to brush the thought away, placing an arm around Mary’s waist.
. Nobody ever looked at him like that.
Sherlock sighed. “I’m not, though, am I?”
as you’d say. She thought she had to put on a spectacle for them I think. There was some resentment over her marrying my father, who was too
