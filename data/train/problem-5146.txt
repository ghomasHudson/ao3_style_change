Tony shifts under the omega’s gaze and quickly turns away. “I’m fine. Maybe a little tired, but fine.”
“Steve, I can’t-” Tony stops himself when worry flashes across his husband’s face. Damn it. He couldn’t stand upsetting Steve. Not when he was so happy about the baby. Tony sighs and says, “I can’t wait.”
The time appears to be passing slowly. Every second that goes by only drives Steve near insanity. All he wants to do is be by Tony’s side.
Fingers brush through his hair, just like they always did when Peter was upset. Peter holds onto Steve tighter, small whimpers escaping him.
It takes a little longer than five minutes but soon the toys are picked up. Harley gathers the last bit of toys and rushes to his room to put them away. They’re probably scattered around his bedroom floor now but that was a problem for another day.
He keeps his fingers crossed just in case. The tower would be less lonely if Peter was only just down the hall.
This chapter and title was actually inspired by the song The Night We Met by Lord Huron. Here's the link if anyone is interested. I swear I listened to it on repeat while writing this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQh9eDcS1-0
Tony never did come by again. And Steve never called. They weren’t meant to be and there was no point in holding onto something Steve was never going to have. Peter didn’t need Tony in his life. He had Steve and the Avengers. And that was enough.
She lacked superhuman strength like her papa and brother, but she wasn’t about to complain about drawing the shortest stick. She had the brains like her dad, and maybe one day she would be wearing a suit of armor like him.
She transformed the communal area for the party. The theme wasn’t the typical blue like Tony had inspected. She surprised him by taking his theme idea into consideration and following through. The space was decorated like it had come out from a page of a comic book. Tony’s plan had been to have a superhero themed shower. It made sense since they were heroes and his son was going to be no different.
“I’m kidding!” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “I’m happy. Honest. But the puking sucks.”
It wasn’t a complete lie. Peter did spend most of the night tossing and turning, his mind racing with thoughts he’d never in a million years think to have. He had thrown up too. The nausea was bad and he had made himself feel worse by peeking into the plastic CVS bag and finding the pregnancy test he had bought after school.
I hope you all enjoyed this story as much as I enjoyed writing it. These two really went on a journey, but don’t worry I have more in store for them. I’m thinking sequel and prequel 🤔
“I don’t want to know.” The omega holds up a hand to stop him from going any further. “Have you seen Tony? I’ve been trying to get a hold of him all morning and-”
“I know,” Peter smiles and he glances back at the photo, “it was one of his favorite places. I think that’s why we went so much. Did you guys ever go?”
“Daddy’s home!” Tony exclaims, finding delight in the way his son reacts to his presence. It was always going to make his heart burst with joy.
Peter giggles and lifts up the block he had put in his mouth, not caring that it had been slobbered on. “Bock!”
He forces his eyes open, regretting it the moment he does. Peter is lying over Steve’s lifeless body. Tony wants to rush toward his son and console him, to tell him everything is going to be okay.
“I think we know how to make up...right?” Steve’s face heats up again and he quickly reaches for his glass to hide the forming blush.
It’s just a matter of minutes, Pepper and Happy arrive to take the pups and distract them for a few minutes.
“Tony, it’s me. But I guess you knew that already,” Steve’s voice fills the room, “I know I call a lot, but I figured another try wouldn’t hurt. I don’t know if you’ve heard my other messages. I’m hoping you have. This one is different. I’m not going to beg you to come back. You chose to leave and I respect your choice.”
“Oh trust me, darling, you are. Best foot massage of my life. And the sex was good too, not gonna lie. Or maybe I’m just that fucking horny. Is that a thing?”
“Welcome to my humble home.” Tony stretches out his arms to present his living space. Steve remains silent, eyes taking in the vast living room and expensive furnishings.
“I know, but you’re going to need that and the balm. Oh and the pillow!” Steve rushes across the room to get the items Tony has refused to put away. Ever since he received them from the shower, they’ve been piled up and left in the corner.
“I can’t. I know it’s my pup but I can’t. Tony, it’s from him and-and I can’t do that again. I can’t. I’m sorry.”
Tony swallows every moan and whimper Steve makes while his hand trails between them, stroking the omega’s cock and smearing the precome at the tip. He eases off Steve’s cock, his questing fingers traveling lower until he meets wetness. Tony rubs one finger along the tight ring of muscle, teasing the area before pressing the tip of his finger against it and dipping inside. He drags his finger out and then slowly thrusts it back in. Steve moans, his head tipping back against the pillow.
Their eyes meet and Harley curiously stretches one small hand out, tiny fingers brushing against Steve’s cheek. Steve whines softly from the contact, his heart fluttering. Harley takes a moment to scent Steve properly and explore his face, then once he’s comfortable enough, he leans forward and nuzzles his nose against Steve’s neck. Harley starts purring.
Tony is content with that response. He knew how stubborn his husband could be. Getting Steve to admit that something was wrong and to get checked out by a medical professional was usually difficult.
Peter claps his hands happily and babbles something Steve doesn’t quite understand. Peter has been saying a few words, but none of them had been what Steve was expecting. He was sure papa would have been his son’s first word.
A fiery pain shoots through Steve’s shoulder but he ignores it. Rumlow fights back, struggling to break free and push the omega off. But Steve holds his ground, not giving the alpha a chance to escape.
“Idiot,” Peter mutters to himself and exits the bathroom. He doesn’t bother tidying up his room or trying to make the space comfortable. Flash was still a bully, and they were far from friends.
“But you didn’t tell them I’m here, right? Pep, it’s important that you keep my location private. Just until I can figure this out.”
Tony sighs and pulls away. “That’s just it. Peter is the reason why we got closer. What if down the road...something shifts and we’re back to the way things used to be?”
Tony grabs his phone again and calls Steve back. He gets his voicemail again. “Dammit, Steve, answer me! I’m sorry! I’m sorry I screwed up but I want to talk. I want to fix this. Call me back...please call me back. I’m sorry.”
In just a few weeks they’d be welcoming their baby boy and starting the next chapter: parenthood. It’s a terrifying thought, him as a father, but it’s been Steve’s assurance that made him consider that maybe he wouldn’t be so bad. He could love their son-that would never be an issue. He’d try not to spoil Peter so much with material items. Tony had vivid memories of having whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. But deep down he just wanted his father to love him.
It’s the strange scent that Steve picks up first. The aroma of leather wafts through the air. Steve wrinkles his nose and his stomach coils tightly from the smell. It clicks in his brain instantly. Only one alpha had this scent.
Peter nods and continues to gather his things for school. He could be a terrible liar and she would easily see through whatever lie he tries to string together. Eventually he’s forced to look up at her, hating how unsure she appears.
It’s 7 A.M. when Peter’s alarm blares. He wakes with a groan and rolls over, stretching out his arm to grab his phone off the bedside table and shut off his alarm. With his room silent again, Peter shuts his eyes and tries to go back to sleep.
I’m so sorry this chapter took me forever! I struggled with it for a while but now I finally got to it and it actually ended up being one of my favorites! Steve gets to kick butt! I’m so proud of him 🥲
“Go easy on me, big guy,” Tony looks over his shoulder when he hears the familiar pop of a lid. Steve nods and pours the lube over his fingers. Tony faces forward again, taking deep breaths to calm himself. He can’t help but jerk when Steve rubs at his entrance.
Tony’s eyes drop down to Steve’s belly when he places a hand over it. Just knowing that life was beginning to start just underneath Steve’s fingers makes Tony’s stomach churn. It was a life he didn’t want.
“Watch it, dork,” Flash sneers and his group of followers laugh. They mimic him and bump into Peter too, giggling as if it was the funniest thing in the world.
He lunges at Steve again and presses him up against the wall. He wraps both hands around the omega’s neck, smirking at the sharp intake of air Steve takes.
Bruce presses the transducer to Peter’s belly and the screen of the ultrasound machine lights up. Peter’s eyes are on the screen again, brows furrowing as he searches for the tiny human that now inhabits his body. He doesn’t see it at first; everything looks gray and unrecognizable.
“Thanks for picking this up,” Steve gestures to the second car seat. Natasha peers up at him and smiles, then she directs her gaze back on Peter’s curious face.
Luckily Peter hadn’t asked where his daddy was or why other kids in his class have two parents and he only has one. Steve was dreading for that day to happen. He didn’t know what he was supposed to say if and when he was asked about Tony. Hopefully that time wasn’t any time soon.
I feel so bad for these two. All Tony wants to do is help Steve because he hates seeing him in so much pain, and poor Steve just sees himself as a risk. They will definitely get their happy ending with their beautiful baby girl! They deserve it!
“Nothing.” Tony’s smile grows brighter. “I love seeing you like this. You’re so good with our son and I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better person to have a family with. You’re the right partner for me too.”
“Me?” Tony asks, one brow raising up. “Okay. I mean I think I can build a smaller version of my suit. Which one do you like better Mark XLII or-”
Steve is discharged from the hospital the next day. A part of him is relieved to return to the comfort of his own home, but the other half is guilty for having to leave his son behind. If everything had gone normal and smooth, then he would be going home with Peter. But luck wasn’t on his side and instead he’s forced to leave the hospital without his son.
With Steve leaving the house every Wednesday and Friday, Tony is left in charge of their four pups. It’s difficult at first to manage them, especially when one of them loves to get into everything.
He ignores the tainted water and gently scrubs Steve’s body clean. Steve is still sobbing, the painful sounds echoing in the showers walls. Tony works quickly to get him clean, not wanting him to remain any longer than he needs to in this room.
“Wow,” Tony can’t help the word that slips out. Steve glances up at him, his lips curving into a small smile. Steve gently brushes his hand against Tony's and Tony flinches, eyes darting down to lock on their hands. He doesn’t pull away.
Yay they made up and Peter has his suit. I have one more chapter planned for this story so I’ll be working on that and getting it up as soon as I can. It’s been a journey!
Tony steps into the room, a bright smile on his face and a sleeping Peter in his arms. Steve’s face immediately lights up at the sight of them. He had his whole family surrounding him now.
“I’m not...not really. I’m disappointed, but more so because he lied to us and thought he could hide it. I thought we made it clear we’d be there if he ever needed us.”
“N-no.” This time Peter steals a glance in his papa’s direction and he’s met with a look of relief. He quickly turns away when the doctor asks the next question.
“You okay?” Comes Bucky’s voice and Steve opens his eyes, finding a pair of blue concerned ones staring back at him. He shouldn’t be surprised that it would be his best friend coming over to check on him.
Yay they’re saved! There was a lot in this chapter and poor babies still got hurt, but Pierce and his goons are gone! *happy dance*
Tony’s words are lost when Steve just shoots him a smile and leaves. Tony huffs and sags in his seat.
Steve looks happy with Bucky. He’s smiling, something Tony hadn’t seen in sometime. Even when they were still together.
“Not right away. I was scared too and didn’t know how he would react. We didn’t really hang out much. I had a huge crush on him and that’s when Nat decided to play matchmaker.”
His attention is stolen when the sound of feet padding against the floor reaches his ears. Tony shuffles into the kitchen, a look of discomfort written on his face. Steve’s question is answered when Tony rubs at the small of his back, wincing from what Steve can only assume is another back ache.
There’s a moment of silence before the lock clicks and the door opens. Sad, brown eyes are staring up at Tony. It’s a heartbreaking sight.
“I give up.” Tony rolls over with a huff and shuts his eyes. He does his best to tune out the soft barks the dog produces every time Steve plays with him.
Steve remains silent. He doesn’t tell Tony that he’s terrified of bringing their baby home. He doesn’t tell him how unsure and worried he is.
He’s currently curled up around his favorite pillow and fast asleep. Steve is still where he has been for the past few hours, slumped in the chair and eyes only for Tony. He promised he’d be there if his husband needed him. Leaving the chair wasn’t an option.
Tony made sure to let everyone know where he stood. It was a boy and no one was going to change his mind. He wanted a mini Steve.
Then an idea comes to mind. He ponders it for a moment, a part of him torn but the other half urging him to make another phone call.
Tony reaches over the older pup to take Steve’s hand. The omega flinches slightly and tears his eyes away from the window to lock them with Tony’s. Steve smiles softly, but Tony can see right through it. Something was wrong.
“Yep.” Tony takes another drink. He’s starting to feel the effects of the alcohol. Any tension he felt was starting to diminish. He’s never felt more relaxed.
“I can’t even begin to imagine what you went through, and I’m sorry life had to fuck you this hard. Sorry. I’m not so great at talking about this sort of stuff. When my life was flipped upside down I found ways to distract myself. Not good ways but...I needed something.”
He kisses them both before returning back to the room to join his mate and daughter. Tony is already in bed with Sarah cuddled up close beside him. He’s softly stroking her hair.
The rest of the team join them to eat the cake and reminisce. Sam disappears for a moment before coming back and handing Peter a small boxed wrapped in blue paper.
It only takes half a second for Steve to realize what he’s done. He grows frightened, terrified of what kind of punishment awaits him. He does the only thing he knows how to do.
Soft lips are on his again and Steve hums into the kiss, glad to have Tony so close. He’d give anything to touch him. Tony’s hands are on him again, exploring his chest and trailing down until they’re hovering over his belt, fingers playing with the leather teasingly. Steve bucks his hips impatiently, urging Tony to stop teasing.
The room only consists of the interviewer; a nice omega woman with a warm smile. The rest is the camera crew and a producer. It may not seem like a lot, but to Steve it was too much.
“Good morning, darling,” Tony murmurs and presses a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck. Steve sighs softly and leans back against the alpha.
The omega reaches for the band of his pants and lowers them down to his ankles, spreading his legs as wide as he can. The next contraction hits, punching a pained gasp from Steve’s lips. He slips a hand between his legs, feeling around his opening and brushing against wet hair. His pup was right there.
“I don’t know. It’s been...a long time and after the baby I wasn’t sure if you’d-if you’d ever look at me like-”
Steve directs his attention back to the bear, using it as a form of distraction and to hide his tears from his friends. He traces one finger along the stitched letters on the bear’s belly, squeezing his eyes shut when the tears threaten to fall.
The rest of their conversation consists of Tony rambling about his exhausting day and Steve talking about his new favorite show. Tony promises they will watch more of it when he gets back.
Tony releases a sob and brings Steve closer, pressing his lips against his soft hair and inhaling the familiar scent. Tears are flooding his eyes and the dam breaks, those tears free and flowing down his face.
“Like it or not Steve left us in charge,” Sam says, his tone shifting into one Tony’s heard the other team members use with him.
Returning to his apartment is difficult. The moment he opens the door, a wave of sadness washes over him. Everything is exactly the same, nothing has been touched, just the way he wanted it.
“It’s okay,” the omega says. He thrusts his hips up, urging Tony to touch him again. Tony groans and both hands grip the omega’s hips. “Do it. You have to.”
Peter was tiny, defenseless; relying strictly on Steve and Steve alone to care for his every need. It was going to be up to Steve to make sure he was dressed, fed, bathed. It was Steve’s job to be there when Peter had a nightmare or fell down.
Tony was used to having people recognize him. Everyday he was meeting someone off the street that knew his name. And usually it didn’t affect him. But this omega was different.
With Steve still wanting to play, Tony moves on and climbs off the bed to grab the bottle of lube they keep in the nightstand drawer. It was running low but had just enough for one more night.
Besides that one incident, everything else appears normal. Tony is still his same, snarky self. He hasn’t complained about anything. That’s when Steve decides to quit looking for any indication of pregnancy. The last thing he needed was to feel disappointment.
“Yes!” Flash hisses and rolls his eyes in annoyance. “That thing! Obviously it’s not safe here and my place is off limits until I can break the news.”
Peter jumps at the disembodied voice and glances around the room, eyes wide and full of confusion. “What the hell…”
His body was supposed to change to accommodate the life that took nearly nine months to grow. He knew that the pregnancy was going to bring forth a lot of new changes and adjustments. He wasn’t even upset about the fact that he’s been running on little sleep. No, he was upset about his appearance.
They don’t race back. With his stomach acting up again, the idea of running back to the compound isn’t appeasing. Steve can’t help but wince when his stomach tightens and a wave of nausea crashes over him. He does his best to hide his discomfort, only to fail miserably.
“You don’t like being the center of attention? Dude, you’re Captain America. The spotlight is always going to be on you.”
Tony doesn’t press for any more details of Steve’s death. Peter wasn’t a hundred percent healed and it was going to take more time for him to become comfortable enough to talk about that terrible day.
“Fuck.” Tony groans and buries his face in Steve's neck, inhaling the sweet scent only Steve can give off. He licks at the mating gland and fucks Steve harder. “I’m so close.”
“I know, Sarah. But brothers aren’t that bad,” Steve tries to assure, but he’s failing miserably when his daughter continues to cry into his neck.
“It means...what if...what if we had the baby and then something happened? What if they got hurt or we got hurt? I could never live with myself if our child suffered because of us.”
“It’s-it’s you. You’re-” The omega stops, cutting himself off when the front door of the car opens and Happy steps out.
Peter nods and chews slowly, then once his mouth is clear, he goes back to eating. With his son fed, Tony moves on to cleaning up the kitchen, not wanting Steve to wake up to it and scold him for it.
But Steve still struggles to relax and enjoy his evening. Tony had chosen a restaurant that was familiar to them. It had been too fancy for Steve back when they dated, and it still was now. He ignores the extravagant centerpieces and the tuxedo waiters. All he can think about is being alone with Tony.
Steve sits with his younger pups on the floor, holding Sarah up by her hands to help steady her on her little legs. He’s almost certain she should’ve taken her first steps by now, but given the life she’s had, she was probably behind on a lot of milestones. She’s barely said a word since he’s met her.
A pent up rage ignites and burns inside Tony. He struggles against the firm grip Bucky has on him. Bucky doesn’t even fight back, his hold still strong.
“Can I feel?” Steve finds himself asking and he trails a hand between his legs, gasping when he’s met with a hard mass.
“P-please?” The omega’s voice snaps Tony out of his thoughts. Tony’s not sure if the omega is begging to be touched again or for Tony to leave him alone. The alpha in him decides and Tony finds himself reaching for the omega again, this time placing his hand directly over the omega’s leaking cock. Another gasp and a jerk of his hips has Tony pulling away.
Peter returns his gaze back on his dad, new tears forming in his eyes. He can see the genuine hurt in his dad’s eyes. It’s a look he’s never seen before. He thought he had seen pain when they talked about his papa, but this pain was different.
“Okay. We can stay in. I just don’t want you getting bored locked away here. We haven’t gone out in weeks.”
“Peter’s a year old now. He’s doing good.He took his first step today. I wish you could’ve been there for it. He was so happy and proud of himself.”
“I didn’t have a choice. If I didn’t comply then he’d hurt me. I couldn’t go back in that room, Tony, I couldn’t. Letting you-I had to. Please understand.”
Peter watches with amusement as his uncles bicker back and forth. He glances down at the cat still cradled in his arms and leaves down the hall with her.
“Can it wait?” Steve decides to ask, hoping Tony thinks he’s just making an excuse because he’s exhausted. It’s not a complete lie. He just got home from the hospital. There was no way he had the energy to build a nursery right now.
Tony sighs harshly. “Will you stop? I may not have dealt with the pregnancy the way you had but it affected me too.”
Tony grins to himself and finally does what his boyfriend is begging him to do. He works Steve’s pants open and slides them down his legs along with his underwear. His cock springs free, hard and already leaking at the tip.
Tony squeezes his eyes shut, fighting back his own tears. This wasn’t supposed to have happened. They were supposed to be welcoming their second child in a few months. They were supposed to be one big happy family. But all of that was stolen from them.
Steve shakes his head again. “He doesn’t want to. I tried. Tony, I tried everything. I don’t know what to do.”
“Steve?” Tony gently shakes the omega until he’s stirring and blue eyes are fluttering open. “Hey, sleepyhead. Bruce is on his way.”
The first thing he does is rush down to the lab to tell Tony the good news. He tries the code he remembers Tony giving him, only for his access to be denied. He figures he mixed up some of the digits and enters the code again, this time a little slower. He was excited.
He glances at the car radio, fingers wrapping around the wheel tightly when he notices the time. Peter never did say when he’d show up and Tony had no idea if the kid was in school. He must be. Steve had probably been strict.
Tony places another kiss to the sensitive area before backing away to kiss Steve’s lips again. His hands explore Steve’s body, feeling every ripple from the firm muscle underneath. Steve’s chest is softer and more sensitive; just a small touch is enough to have him moaning and his back arching.
“Yep. Fine. Back still hurts like a bi-” One stern look from Steve has Tony pausing and rethinking his last word. “I’m good. Real good.”
Steve’s eyes glisten with tears and he reaches out for the compass. He tries to speak, his lips moving but no words come out, almost as if it’s too painful to mutter another word.
“Hey,” Tony soothes and squeezes Steve’s hand when he releases a small sob. “Honey, I’m sorry. I know that’s not going to make it better, but I’m so sorry. They’re in a better place. They’re free from him and Hydra.”
Tony doesn’t hesitate to comply. He’s gentle when he prepares Steve, more so than he’s ever been. He takes his time, making sure Steve is properly stretched before sliding the condom on and positioning himself at Steve’s entrance.
“You deserve a lot more. It’s a shame we couldn’t see eye to eye. Hydra needs someone like you on our side.”
“But what if it is? We may have escaped with our lives when fighting against Hydra, but we didn’t come back the same. I still have nightmares. I think Tony hasn’t healed.”
The comment Peter had made replays in his head. Steve’s death was affecting him too. He didn’t show it to a lot of people, but he was dealing with the same pain and grief. Maybe not the same. Steve hadn’t been his parent. Steve was barely a friend. But Tony loved him. Tony loved him so much it hurt.
“Okay,” Sam tries to defuse the situation. He comes closer until the teenager allows him to pull him into a tender embrace. “We won’t mess anything up.”
“So you’re saying…” Tony trails off and his eyes land on Steve’s middle. It finally dawns on him what Steve is trying to say. “No,” Tony shakes his head and rises to his feet. “No. No. That is not mine. That is not-no. No. I didn’t. I wouldn’t-”
Yikes their interaction probably could’ve gone a lot better. Poor Peter just wants to know who his dad is and Tony just...yeah. ugh he’s a pain in the butt.
He eases back on the tea and crushes the pills up and slips them into Steve’s food instead. Steve doesn’t notice, or if he does complain that something seems off, Tony is quick to assure him that it was all in his head. The food was fine.
“I’m sure your time at Stark Industries was more important. Maybe you should just stay there instead,” Steve says coolly, and he yanks himself free from Tony’s grasp.
Natasha doesn’t respond, too busy attending to Morgan. She speaks softly to her, cooing and smiling until Morgan grows quiet. Tony can’t help but wish his husband acted this way toward their daughter.
Steve smiles as he accepts the blue gift bag. He had already opened a few from Clint’s family. They had gifted him with a few baby outfits, a bottle set, crib sheets, and a couple of boxes of diapers. Bruce’s gift was a baby swing, Sam’s was more clothes and diapers, Bucky was simple and gave pacifiers and a shirt that said: Cool Like My Uncle.
“What he did to you wasn’t your fault. You didn’t say it out loud but I know inside you’re blaming yourself and asking why this happened to you. I wish I could tell you why but unfortunately I don’t have the answers. What I can tell you is that you’re innocent. You’re not at fault here, Steve. And I know right now it doesn’t feel that way, but one day it will. He didn’t rob you completely okay? You’re still you. Maybe even better than before. Definitely stronger. You can overcome this. I promise.”
“Just give him a chance,” Peter says. “I did. He’s not...he’s not perfect but he’s still my dad. He’s the only parent I have left.”
“I have an idea,” Tony starts. The reaction he receives is one he’s seen countless times before. It was a well known fact that a lot of his ideas were shitty. Happy and Pepper have both been witnesses and sometimes victims to them.
Tony eases Steve’s hand away and steps away to shed the rest of his clothing. Steve follows, quickly removing his own until it’s a messy pile near his feet. Tony takes his hand and leads him to the bed, gently pushing him back until Steve’s lying flat on his back. Tony joins and hovers over him, ducking his head down to connect their lips.
Peter doesn’t dare tell his best friend that it was a little late for that. He was already growing attached. He doesn’t want to, especially since he’s still indecisive about keeping the baby or giving it up. But he can’t help the new feelings he has now.
“We’ll talk about this later,” Sam decides, knowing if he didn’t get his husband and nephew calm that one would lose their cool and the other would disappear from their lives. He couldn’t have that. Not after everything they’ve been through.
A soft sniffle captures Tony’s attention and he turns in its direction, finding Steve hunched over with his face buried in his hands. His body wracks with sobs. It’s painful to witness.
“We should let Peter decide.” Natasha knows she’s not on the same page as everyone else, but truth be told, it was Peter’s decision. “Steve always said if Peter wanted to meet him then he should.”
Steve sniffs the air, growing more and more uncomfortable by the second. It wasn’t just the three new people that were throwing him off. The whole room was filled with a team. A mixture of alphas, betas, and omegas.
Steve remains locked in his room for a majority of his day. It’s better for everyone in the long run. He came close to hurting his friends because he couldn’t get his own emotions under control. He wonders if the rollercoaster of emotions was another pregnancy symptom, or Tony was just digging that deep under his skin.
It’s nice having Steve this close. Tony wraps one arm around him, enjoying holding him in his arms. They’re surrounded in silence, and for a moment Tony wonders if Steve has finally drifted off.
Steve sighs and tips his head back, letting it rest on the edge of the bed. “You’re not talking about my hand, are you?”
The nausea crashes over him like a strong wave, sending Peter out of his seat and rushing toward the closest bathroom. He can hear Ned calling out for him and a few snickers from the occupied tables he passes by.
But the little voice in the back of his head starts whispering, urging him to get up and fight. He tries to tune it out, too fearful to fight back and risk losing. But the voice gets louder, yelling at him to pick himself back up and stand against the bullies. Hydra may not be punks in Brooklyn alleys, but they were still bullies, picking on Steve until he eventually succumbed to their abuse.
“I’m not giving up. I’ve tried everything and it didn’t work. Something needs to be done, and you know it, too.”
Steve whimpers and hangs his head. He’s not in the mood for any of Tony’s jokes. It’s not like he gets them half of the time anyway.
“A dad? Wait, are you-wait, wait. Are you telling me what I think you’re telling me because it sounds like you’re telling me that you’re-”
A lump forms in Tony’s throat and fresh tears gather in his eyes. “Y-yeah. He needs to stay in bed okay? Just stay out here and I’ll be right back.”
Tony is snapped from his thoughts and his eyes flicker up to meet Steve’s gaze. “I was just picturing you carrying our baby. I never imagined it before but now I can’t stop,” he says and he reaches out to splay his palm over Steve’s stomach. “Our baby would be right here. It’s crazy.”
Breakfast is quiet. Peter picks at his food, moving around the eggs with his fork until they’re on the opposite side of the plate. One glance around shows that he wasn’t the only one not hungry this morning. The only thing his uncle Sam had consumed was the coffee; his uncle Bucky hadn’t touched anything.
Steve looks over his shoulder to shoot Tony a smile. “It’s for both of you. You are his...we agreed dad, right?”
Tony silences Steve with another kiss. “I want to,” he says once they break apart. He cups Steve’s face in his hands, smoothing his thumb over the soft skin of Steve’s cheek. “I want to make you happy. I love you so much and if a baby is what you want, then we’ll do it.”
The first thing Tony does when he gets inside the tower is make his way toward his private office. He ignores the questions Happy throws at him, unable to fully answer them. To be honest he doesn’t know what the hell just happened. All he knows is he had disappeared off the grid for a while and now he was being forced back into this life.
Nothing. Not a single word. There’s no missed calls, voicemails, emails. Nothing from Tony. He didn’t even have the decency to reply to the letter.
Tony grunts and his body grows taut. His cock spills inside Steve’s mouth and the omega swallows the load. Steve pulls away and licks the bit of Tony’s release off his lips.
“I think so. I mean, we’ve kinda done it before. We can still save the world together. Just not…” Tony trails off. He knew breakups could be hard, but theirs was like nothing he’s ever experienced. It didn’t compare to the countless others he’s gone through in the past.
Tony sighs and forces himself to glance in Steve’s direction. Steve was starting to resemble himself again. He didn't appear very drunk anymore, a little buzzed maybe, but not shitfaced. The serum probably took care of that.
Steve nods and lies back, scooting up on the bed until his head is resting on the pillows, and spreading his legs invitingly. Tony crawls over to him, situating himself between Steve’s spread legs and ducking his head down to capture his lips in a kiss. Steve moans softly, and wraps his arms around Tony’s neck, bringing him closer to deepen the kiss.
Steve releases another chuckle and glances over his shoulder, his eyes scanning over the festive streamers Tony has just finished putting up.
“Yeah,” Tony answers quickly and slips the document back inside the envelope. “It’s fine. Perfectly fine.”
He kept the name regardless of her teasing and soon he was training alongside their parents. If he wanted to go out and save the world then that was fine, but just like everything else, their parents made a rule for that too. Morgan almost felt bad for him and the extra rules he needed to follow. All she had to worry about was keeping her room clean, making sure she brushed her teeth, and went to bed on time. Okay so maybe those weren’t all the rules, but those were the ones she followed the most.
“It’s okay. The good thing is your son is healthy. Now I want you to go home and bond with your sons. If you need me for anything please don’t hesitate to call me.”
Tony slams on the breaks and the tires squeal. Peter looks up, expecting to find them at a red light. But instead they’re stopped in the middle of the road. Cars are beginning to pull up behind them; a few honking their horns.
He should be jumping joy. And maybe he would be if he wasn’t eight months pregnant. No, that wasn’t entirely true. Even if he was capable of jumping, he wouldn’t give Tony that satisfaction.
He needed to stop feeling sorry for himself and fight the grief. All his life he was taught to get back up and keep fighting. It was easier said than done. Most days Peter wanted to stay on the ground. But that made him an easy target for life’s kicking and punching. He had to rise up and stay strong.
Steve’s eyes flicker down toward the drink in Tony’s hand before settling back on Tony’s face. “You’re ignoring me. If the sex was bad-”
Steve hums as he thinks back to the night he let his son go to his first party. He can’t help but feel regret. Maybe if he had kept Peter home none of this would have happened. But Peter would have found a way to sneak out and get to that party.
There’s still something off about the situation that Tony can’t place. It didn’t make sense for him to accept Alexander’s help when he barely even knew the man. Happy and Pepper was his go to people. He trusted them before anyone else.
“Hmm…” Steve hums and reads the name over in his head, then announces it out loud. “Peter? Huh. That’s cute, right?”
Tony seemed hopeful this year. Steve had to remind him before the holiday to keep it simple. Steve was perfectly content staying in, avoiding the cold New York weather and curling up with Tony on the sofa. They could do takeout-Steve was dying to try the new Thai place that opened up-and enjoy being with each other instead of a fancy dinner and gifts that cost probably more than they should.
“Hey, kiddo you’re okay. I don’t know what you’re making a big fuss for,” Tony speaks softly to his son. He brings his son closer to his chest, hoping the closeness would ease Peter’s discomfort. Peter responds by turning his head, mouth opening and closing as he searches for something Tony can’t give.
“Hey, buddy, are you okay?” Tony asks, taking small steps toward the man. He stops when the man moves away.
For the most part Steve understood. Tony’s hormones were changing and he was getting more agitated than usual. His feet were still bothering him and now his lower back decided to flare up with pain. Steve would massage him every time Tony complained, but sometimes that wasn’t enough.
And now these two are fighting 🤦♀️ Don’t worry they’ll make up and everyone will be happy again. I teased a baby shower before but now it’s happening and then we’re getting closer to the birth!
“Mine,” Steve whispers, his hand moving lower, following the trail of dark hair until his fingers brush against Tony’s slacks.
“They’re still calling?” Tony asks and Pepper nods. Steve doesn’t bother to ask what the hell they’re talking about.
“Now about what I was saying,” Steve says. His son refuses to acknowledge him, too engrossed in the blocks. “Walking is terrifying but you’ll love it. Pretty soon you’ll be wandering all over the place and..."
The rest of the evening passes by with ease. For the first time in a long time, the Steve Tony knew was making an appearance. Steve smiled more; he laughed. He was starting to feel like himself again. Tony was sure of it.
Tony hits that spot inside Steve again, and the omega cries out, his hands gripping Tony tightly. Tony steadies himself on his forearms and ducks his head down, placing a quick kiss to Steve’s lips before attaching his mouth to Steve’s neck. The omega whimpers when his mating gland is stimulated again.
“Good morning, birthday boy!” Tony beams and comes over. He sets the tray down on the nightstand and turns back to Steve. “Before you say anything, there’s nothing wrong with a little breakfast in bed.”
“Yeah. Didn’t you hear? Steve and I have a kid. A kid he didn’t tell me about. And yeah maybe I should’ve picked up the fucking phone and called him back. I regret that, I do, but he should’ve done more. I’m done blaming myself for all this shit.”
He waits for the right moment, eyes trained on the two alphas. Rumlow hands over the baby and Peter is tucked tightly in Pierce’s arms.
“You’ll be okay,” Bruce assures, having sensed Peter’s hesitation. “Go ahead and make yourself comfortable. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
“Yeah.” Steve agrees with another yawn. His eyes shut again and he mumbles sleepily, “He’s a good dog.”
“We’ll get back to what we had,” Tony promises as he softy threads his fingers through Steve’s hair.
There was no point in denying it. Tony shrugs his shoulders. “Didn’t you say you wanted us to be friends?”
“You have. Tony, look at what you’ve done for me and our son. You gave us a home. That’s better than cake and presents.”
Those had been the only words Peter finds himself repeating over and over again in his head. He glances over at the bed where his Uncle Sam is lying, hoping and praying that he wakes up. His aunt assured him that he would, but Peter needed to be there to see it for himself. The last person he hoped would get up never did.
Peter does his best to stay calm and hide behind a mask, but his mask has cracks and he knows his papa can see right through it.
Tony sighs and lays his utensils down. “Honey, I’m so sorry. I tried to get home sooner and then your brother met me-”
Steve appears beside him and orders a beer. He thanks the man and leans against the counter, his gaze landing on Tony.
“Hey.”Steve places both hands over Peter’s shoulders. “I’m coming back. I promised. Do I ever break my promises?”
When Tony doesn’t get an immediate response he snaps his head up and glances at his son. He doesn’t miss the hurt expression on his son’s face and the tears that have gathered in his eyes.
Peter is laid back in the bassinet and drifting to sleep. Tony decides to do the same, knowing his son will be up in a few hours to do this all over again. Only sleep never comes. He lies awake, eyes transfixed on his son’s sleeping form. He still hasn’t fully comprehended the fact that he was a father.
“She’s not yours to keep, Omega. Haven’t you learned by now? They don’t belong to you.” The alpha directs his gaze back on the newborn in his arms, a sad sigh escaping him. “It’s a real shame this one didn’t work out.”
Tony groans from the tight heat surrounding him. He takes a moment for Steve to adjust, but it’s becoming difficult to hold back and fuck Steve hard. He waits as patiently as he can until the omega grants him permission to move.
The image of their son appears on the screen and Tony leans closer in his seat to get a good look. The baby is curled up around itself. There’s no fluttering in the center or movement of any kind. Tony hadn’t felt the baby move yet like Steve had. He’s glad.
He had already risked too much when he tried to escape the first time. He hadn’t made it very far, only making it outside of the stone walls and into the dark, thick woods that surround the grounds. He wishes he was there now. Anywhere was safer than here.
The reason for revising his old apartment is to clean it out. Peter can’t even imagine touching his papa’s things. No one had gone in there since the funeral.
“He’s a computer,” Tony cuts in, “you know like...like…” Tony trails off and turns around in his seat and gestures toward his array of monitors. “Like this. Only he likes to talk back.”
“Because this is when I run. Now come on.” Steve pats his son’s leg and gets up, shaking his head on his way out when Peter groans again.
“You already are,” Steve chuckles and places a kiss on Tony's head. Tony hums in response and snuggles closer to Steve, a sigh of content leaving him.
Tony grows curious and rounds the bench until he’s standing on the side of the omega. Tony doesn’t know where the urge comes from, but he finds himself stretching his fingers out and running them over the black cloth shielding the omega’s eye. He rips the blindfold away.
“I don’t get it. You wanted to get to know him and-and have a relationship and you didn’t. Why? I know you said you were scared but...that’s not good enough.”
It’s not the guests that are making Steve feel overwhelmed. The pile of presents waiting for him is what’s throwing him off. He had never seen so many neatly wrapped gifts before. It was obvious that a majority of the boxes and bags were for his son and maybe that was worse. Did Peter really need all of this stuff? How much did a pup require?
“Shirts? What’s wrong with my shirts?” Tony gestures to the black band tee he has on. Steve knew how much Tony loved those types of shirts but they were getting tighter around the middle. Steve wonders how they’re even comfortable any more.
He’s reminded of the family he still has, but sometimes they weren’t enough. He wanted his parents to be together, and for the team to be reunited. But it would never be reality. His parents were gone and his family would always be broken. No matter how hard he tried he could never put the pieces back together.
Steve smiles again and glances down, using the pup as a distraction from the conversation. He continues to play with the dark hair, finding comfort in it. Tony lets the issue go for now.
“Tony, please.” Steve is pleading now. Damn him. Tony can’t deny him anything and he knows it. “I want to keep him. I know what it’s like to feel lost and displaced in the world. I didn’t have a home until you and the team. He needs a home, too.”
Pepper rolls her eyes and takes the gift to place with the others. The next one-Steve makes sure they read the tag before tearing into the gift-is from Clint and Laura. They gave them a nursing pillow and a breast pump, something Clint made sure to joke about. It wasn’t amusing in the slightest and earned him a punch in the shoulder from Nat.
“Kiddo, it’s a little too hot-” Tony starts to say, only to shut his mouth when Peter glares at him.
Happy is the one who cups her head and he huffs out a small laugh. He peers up at Steve. “She’s almost here. Come on, just a little more.”
Peter smiles and nods his head, then he follows Sam down the hall and toward the extra bedroom. He hadn’t been over in some time, but the room still looked the same. The only difference was that it was a bit messier than the last time.
“What are you gonna be Papa?” Peter asks, and now there are suddenly two pairs of brown eyes on Steve.
They always took it upon themselves to abuse him, even if he had complied. They found some kind of sick joy in hurting him.
The elevator arrives at its destination and Tony leads the way. He glances over his shoulder every now and then, watching the omega closely. He wasn’t expecting Steve to turn on him, but he wasn’t about to let his guard down. Steve was a complete stranger.
Flash turns and leaves, and that’s when Peter lets the tears fall. He turns toward the sink and grips the edge tightly, his eyes flooding with tears and streaming down his face. He sobs quietly, his body trembling with each sob that escapes him. His stomach churns and he rushes into the nearest stall, emptying his stomach of the little content it has.
The depression. It’s always going to be depression. It was always going to hang over Steve like a rain cloud. Tony wasn’t going to let that cloud downpour over Steve. The storm don’t last forever. it will eventually run out of rain.
He doesn’t know how long he sits in the rain and cries. It feels like hours have passed, but it could only have been a few minutes. He doesn’t care that he’s soaked from head to toe or that his teeth are beginning to chatter. All he cares about is being near his papa.
It was relieving to continue to hear those words. His pup was healthy and safe. That was all Steve cared about.
“I think he had a bad dream,” Steve carefully places his son in the middle of the bed and pulls the duvet over him. Peter snuggles with his puppy and his dark eyes flutter.
Tony nods and watches as Steve disappears from the room. He returns his attention back to the movie, but every now and then his eyes travel toward the stairs, waiting for his husband to come back.
Steve flinches at the harsh tone and scrubs his body quickly, but it’s not good enough. The alpha growls and grabs the wash cloth from Steve’s hand, then forces him around and into the wall again. Steve grits his teeth when the alpha washes him.
“Let him go!” Tony yells, his anger boiling. He struggles again to break free, but again his attempts fail and he’s left to watch as his mate is dragged away and tossed onto the mattress. “Don’t hurt him! Don’t you fucking hurt him!”
Sam and Bucky were also in a disagreement...with each other. No surprise there. Sam was sure the baby was a boy whereas Bucky was siding with Natasha. The bickering they had over the topic only increased Tony’s headache.
“I want to feel if he moves. I think it’s my favorite part about you being pregnant. Oh and not to mention no more rock hard abs. You’re finally normal. Captain America is just like us,” Natasha teases.
Steve steals a glance in Sam’s direction and when he gets a smirk from his friend, he knows ignoring the question isn’t going to be enough. Steve turns to his right, only to find the exact same look on Bucky’s face. He was cornered.
Alexander is an older alpha. His hair is golden and thinning in some parts. The suit he’s chosen for the occasion is nothing short of expensive, though Tony can’t help but compare it to his own. Tony wins that one.
It’s meant as a joke, but Steve can’t bring himself to laugh. “Actually…” he pauses, one hand falling to his stomach. The queasiness returns and Steve has to bite back the urge to vomit.
Peter shrugs. “I’m used to it I guess. He’d let me go on runs with him. It was part of the training.”
“Dad?” Peter peers up at Tony. “Do you want to…I mean if you’re busy then I understand but Auntie Nat always makes the best cakes and I don’t know…maybe…”
He grows braver and runs his hand along the front of Tony’s pants, feeling the effect he has on the alpha through the expensive material. Tony growls low in his throat, his eyes growing darker and scent stronger than ever. Steve inhales deeply, his own body reacting to the enticing scent. He’s already wet, and judging by the way Tony’s nostrils flare, he must smell it.
“I just want things to be normal. I know they never will be because he’s gone but he wanted us to have a relationship and I owe that to him.”
A deep rumble forms in Tony’s chest and makes its way up his throat. Steve spreads his legs invitingly, encouraging the alpha to take what was his. Alphas always came first.
“Forget it.” Sam waves a dismissive hand. “Have dinner with your dad. You might as well get used to it.”
They’re not alone. Two more alphas dressed in black tactical gear linger near the doorway. One is a bigger man with jet black hair slicked back. The other is a few inches shorter, but makes up with it in muscle. They’re intimidating, nothing at all like the bodyguard Tony wishes he had brought with him.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, a hint of worry in his tone. Peter doesn’t want him to worry and fret. It was overbearing at times.
“Stop,” Tony cups Steve’s face. “You can do this. Don’t listen to what that voice says. Just listen to me.”
He doesn’t mention the feelings he may or may not have for Tony. The point of the letter isn’t to confess that he misses Tony or wishes for them to start over and mend what’s broken. All he has to do is confess about the life currently growing in his belly.
The moment the bottle is pressed to her lips, Morgan accepts it and eagerly begins nursing, filling the room with her suckling. Steve keeps his eyes locked on her face and their eyes meet again. He smiles down at her, but it’s not as bright as it was before. There’s sadness behind it.
“Yeah, me.” Tony reaches out to pull Steve back when his boyfriend makes an attempt to get up. “Just ignore him. Or better yet, kick him out.”
“Keep it down,” Tony hisses and his voice drops lower. “I’m working on it okay? I didn’t know how to tell him.”
Thank you guys for a wonderful response to the first chapter! I hope you all are liking this so far!
Tony loved waking up to Steve each day. He loved how tousled his hair got; he loved how thick and deep his voice was first thing in the morning. In Tony’s opinion, this was when Steve looked his best.
“Yeah,” Sam nods and he folds his arms over his chest. He smiles again. “I wanted to honor him. And I like helping people. Especially the type of people that come in here. I’ve seen and helped a lot of broken omegas.”
Their eyes meet for a second before Steve’s gaze falls on their daughter still nestled in Natasha’s arms. Tony expects Steve to smile and come over to swoop their daughter up and coo over her, but instead he does the opposite and heads toward the kitchen.
Tony lets out a sigh and leans forward, twiddling his fingers nervously. He doesn’t even know where to begin. “I have a few questions about that night we first met. I’m gonna be honest with you here, but I don’t remember a damn thing. I tend to...act out when I’m drinking.”
The blaring of an alarm is what jolts Tony awake. His eyes shoot open, immediately landing on the ceiling above him. With a groan he rolls over and buries his head under the pillow, trying to drown out the sound responsible for disturbing his sleep. He pokes his head out, expecting to find his mate nestled beside him, only to be met with nothing.
“Buck, stop,” Sam pauses his current task and faces his husband again. Bucky frowns and leans against the counter, arms folded across his chest. “He’s okay. You can’t worry about everything he does.”
“You’re overthinking again. I already told Steve not to worry. Do I need to have that talk with you, too?”
I'm so sorry that it's taken me this long to update this one. I got stuck and wasn't sure what to do, but I'm starting to plan it out and will hopefully have this one updated frequently. Thank you for being so patient with me!
With another break given, Steve works on getting air into his lungs. He’s exhausted and wants the pain to end. He wants to meet the new baby. He wants to meet Peter.
Steve shuts the door behind him, pausing to take a breath and plan his next move. From behind he didn’t look pregnant, but he knew once he turned around, Tony would know.
Steve nods his head and lets out a small groan. “I swear his favorite time to kick me is right before bed.”
Steve shakes his head. He doesn’t want to talk about it when he’s sharing this moment with an alpha that truly cares about him. But Tony asks again and Steve gives in.
“Sorry,” Steve apologizes. He ducks his head down to place soft kisses along Tony’s back. “Just relax. It’ll feel good.”
If it meant making Steve happy, then Tony would do it. He wouldn’t hurt him or their unborn baby this time.
Steve sniffs. “But the others. I should’ve done something. I was their mother and I just let them...I hurt them.”
“What? What’s wrong?” Happy’s tone is full of worry. “Is it the kid? Please tell me you’re not having this baby. Tony specifically said-”
The rest of the team provides comfort when they can. They come by more than usual just to check up on Steve and make sure he was okay. Tony doesn’t bother lying. They could obviously see how distraught their captain was. They were too.
The door shuts behind him and that’s when Steve snaps his head up, revealing the excruciating pain in his eyes. Tony hates seeing the pain again. He hopes this will be the last time.
“True. Okay, okay what about crying? I can’t deal with a crying kid. All they do is whine and complain.”
Tony gets back to work...until another distraction comes along. A video call from Pepper comes through. Tony sighs again and accepts the incoming message.
Months go by. Or maybe it’s just been a few weeks. It sure feels longer to Peter. Everyday he’s thinking about his dad and the last conversation they had.
“I wasn’t sure, but now...now I’m okay with it. I’m terrified but at the same time I’m happy. I want to make him comfortable and keep him safe at all times. Just him being alone right now is making me anxious.”
Bucky wipes his mouth with the back of his hand before peering up at Sam and frowns. “I have no idea.”
Peter sighs sadly. “Okay,” he says. Before he can give his brother back, he gives him another kiss. “I love you.”
“But it’s fine now. He’s a good guy and he loves me. For years I wondered about him, and though papa was enough, I wanted both my parents. I know I can’t have that now, but at least one parent is better than none.”
Steve stumbles for a moment, quickly catching himself and moving toward the door where the other alpha is waiting.
Steve takes a shaky breath. “He was the first one to test me out. After they thawed me from the ice, he wanted to see if I was still fertile. I was.”
Just like Tony feared, the question is difficult to answer. He could probably go on for hours about what he thought of Steve. For years he had been crazy about him.
When Peter starts walking, Dodger becomes Peter’s support. And when Peter starts talking, Dodger’s name pops up in most of his conversations.
Steve’s curiosity and confusion only grows as they follow the trail and stop in the middle of a clearing. It’s not too far from the lake and surrounded by tall trees and luscious grass. Tony lets go of Steve’s hand and takes a few steps until he’s right in the center of the clearing.
Tony shifts under Bruce’s uncomfortable gaze. “Uh.” Tony rubs the back of his neck. “He mentioned doing this before.”
Finding a name for their son shouldn’t be this difficult. And maybe for some it wasn’t. Maybe for others they’ve already picked out the names they’d want for their future children. Steve’s wishing they would’ve done that. At least then it wouldn’t be so hard for them to find one for their son.
Tony isn’t in bed yet and Steve frowns when he finds him sitting on the edge and playing on his Stark pad.
“Not yet. But with a little training, he’ll be exactly who we need him to be.” The alpha turns and walks toward the incubator, then reaches out to touch the pup’s head. Tony growls in warning. “Easy there, Stark. I don’t want to hurt you. I need you.”
“Go upstairs,” Steve tells him, his tone still calm. Peter nods and runs up the stairs, not bothering to look back. Steve sighs sadly and leans forward in his seat, clasping his hands together and rubbing them for a moment before looking up at his husband. “That went well.”
Peter smiles widely and rushes over to hug his uncle as tight as he can. “Thank you! I promise no more sneaking out and I won’t skip school anymore!”
“Sorry, man, but I have to go…” Peter says lamely and adjusts the strap of his backpack around his shoulder.
With his son down for the night, Steve is able to get some time for himself. His body demands he rest now that Peter is sleeping, but he can’t bring himself to sleep.
“I know, I know. Just give me a minute okay? Geez, I can’t even remember the last time you fucked me.”
It’s a little after four when his last session finishes. A few group members stick around to chat or to express their excitement for the next meeting. Steve enjoyed his group’s enthusiasm. He remembered being nervous and unsure of himself for his first meeting. He’s come a long way since then.
“Something like that,” Peter replies nervously. He shifts from foot to foot, his fingers fiddling with the strings of his hoodie.
Tony tries to keep himself occupied with the designs for the nursery, but all he can think about is the overwhelming urge to be with Steve and take their relationship to the next level. They’ve mated before, but Tony didn’t want a repeat of that night. He wanted it to be special.
It was difficult to juggle their superhero life and their family, but somehow it all came together. Morgan never missed out on any kisses and hugs or stories before bed. Her parents made time for her despite their crazy jobs.
To Steve it was just another day. His birthday was something he had stopped caring about a long time ago. When he was a child it had been more exciting, and that was even when he and his mother were struggling to get by. She always managed to scrape together just enough to get him something every year. They’d spend the evening watching the fireworks illuminate the sky. The celebration had been for their country, but his mother never let him forget that those fireworks were for him too.
Steve chuckles and sets the bag aside with the other gifts. There’s one left for him to open. The note says it’s from both Maria Hill and Nick, but Steve knows Nick probably added his name. He’s grateful anyway when he unwraps a car seat. He wishes they had showed up to the party, but being head of SHIELD was demanding. Steve makes a mental note to send a thank you card.
Blue eyes are staring back at him. There’s a hint of arousal still in them, but Tony is able to make out something else. Fear.
Tony eyes him closely. “Yeah? Well then in that case grab blondie and let’s bounce. I miss my bed. And coffee.”
Steve Steve Steve. Why are you so stubborn! He’s being a butt but I guess he just doesn’t believe a baby could be responsible for his body’s changes. He’s convinced he can’t have a baby. Oh man is he in for a surprise 😆
Natasha seems to agree while Bruce remains silent. Then everyone’s gaze is falling on Sam and he sighs heavily. The decision should be any easy one, but Sam can’t help but feel that the team should accept Tony back.
“I’m sorry.” Tony squeezes his eyes shut. He doesn’t want to be here. He should be back in his tower, drinking his eighth cup of coffee and tinkering with his inventions. But instead he’s here. He doesn’t even know where he is.
The first thing he notices is how small the pup is. It’s not until he properly inspects the newborn does he realize it’s a girl. An omega girl.
Tony has to fight back the urge to do anything other than stand still and watch. He wants to turn and run. He wants to make the scene disappear from his mind forever. But the other half wants to help. He could help Steve and everything would be fine. Steve would be alive and they could be a family.
Steve accidentally releases a sad whine. He nods and peers up at the alpha with glistening eyes. “Yes,” he whispers.
“And there’s so much for you and the kids to see. Steve, the world is different now and you deserve to see what you and the kids have missed. I want you to stop hiding and find your place.”
He rests his head against the wall, eyes blurring with tears. The break he’s given is over quicker than when it started, and he’s forced to bear down. He grunts with each push, face growing red from the strain.
“Nope. I promised. But to be honest that was my first plan until you shot it down. No, there is nothing waiting for you downstairs. This is Pete’s day, baby shower stuff only.”
The hug catches Tony off guard, but the second he rids himself of the shock, he embraces his son tightly, his own eyes filling with tears.
“She’ll get it. She’s a smart kid. I got the keys.” Tony holds up the set of keys and they jingle in his hand. Morgan’s eyes are immediately drawn to the shiny new object.
Peter whimpers and Steve’s eyes land on him, whining softly for his pup. Pierce points the gun at Steve, pressing the cold metal into his forehead.
The elevator arrives and the doors open. Tony’s hope of being alone is crushed and he aims at the gun at the three alpha’s inside. They do the same.
Steve fights again when his sweatpants are tugged down his legs. Another punch to the face has him crying out and falling still. He sucks in a harsh breath when he’s touched. He thought he’d never have to experience this again.
“Peter should,” Sam finally responds to the question. “I don’t want to take that away from him too. Steve would’ve given it to him.”
At the sight of another alpha, Tony stands up straighter and puffs his chest out to make himself appear more intimidating. Though it was hard to say if it was working when he was pushing a stroller, and had a fruit loop stuck to his pants. Steve chuckles softly and swoops in to help, picking off the dried cereal and kissing his mate on the cheek.
Omega’s were the loving and caring ones of the pack, nurturing the pups and supporting the alpha. Steve had never wanted to be the stereotypical omega. He had the freedom to be his own person and have a life outside of raising pups. The times were different now, but Steve still felt he needed to be a good omega for his family.
“I met my dad…” Peter decides to try and change the subject. Now he’s not sure if that was even a good idea. Talking about his dad wasn’t any better.
When the nightmares did occur, they were never the same. The setting was always the most consistent; Steve would be in the base, locked away in his cell and begging for someone to help him. Sometimes he’d dream about Rumlow and Rollins, and the abuse they put him through. But mostly it had been Pierce haunting his dreams. Steve would always be reminded of the terrible things the alpha did.
Nothing. Not a single appearance from Alexander Pierce. It was both relieving and uneasy at the same time. Steve warned not to underestimate him, and though Tony promised he wouldn’t, a part of him can’t help but wonder if they’ve won.
The team is gathered in the communal living area, filling the space with laughter and an array of conversations. For once, they’re not needed on any assignments. They’re able to spend the morning together as a team; as a family.
Tony smiles. “It is. I was thinking once Pete is older he could play in the lake. He’d like that. The city is huge and loud and God the drivers...he’d be safe here I think. He could be a kid.”
“Don’t move,” says the gruff voice. Steve complies, knowing better than to fight back when he held something so precious in his arms. Brock Rumlow steps to the side of Steve, not once removing the gun he has placed to the omega’s head. “Give me the kid.”
“J, ‘m sleeping,” Tony mumbles and pulls the blankets over his head. He lets out a pleased sigh and relaxes, ready to drift off to dreamland again.
Tony rolls his eyes and playfully slaps Steve on the arm. “I still hate you by the way. Taking my coffee like some kind of monster.”
Peter rushes into the elevator and presses the button for the first floor. The doors close and the car begins to descend to its destination. Peter leans back against the wall and runs a hand through his hair, tugging on it harshly when his eyes burn with tears.
The moment he knew about his son, Peter was his top priority. Peter would always be the most important part of Steve’s life. Being Captain America didn’t matter anymore.
Muffled voices fill his ears and he stops what he’s doing, straining to pick up on the conversation that’s currently going on outside. Peter opens the door to his room and pokes his head out, the voices clearer now.
Peter doesn’t rush to get ready to be downstairs for breakfast. He’s exhausted and sluggish, desperately wanting to do nothing but sleep all day. He’s been tired before, back when he was staying up late to finish assignments or playing video games with Ned, but never has he felt this drained.
“You’re not. I know that face, Steve. If this is about being alone, remember that you’re not. I’m here.”
I really wanted to update this today and I'm so glad I did! I'm sorry it's an okay chapter but I promise this story is going somewhere. These two are just dealing with a lot and have a long road ahead of them. I have plenty of time to update now since I can't return to work for a while for showing Covid symptoms. I'm getting tested tomorrow and go from there I guess.
Tony rolls his eyes and goes in search of the first aid kit. He returns to find Steve already drifting off to sleep.
Harley kicks again and rolls, no doubt searching for a more comfortable position. Tony pulls back, chuckling at the way Steve’s stomach morphes with each movement from their son.
“Pete!” Steve calls out. The scream he heard had belonged to Harley but it was usually Peter behind the screams. He loved crawling the walls and hanging down to scare his older brother. Raising a son with enhanced powers wasn’t easy but they were managing. Harley hadn’t shown any signs of the serum affecting him but that didn’t mean a watchful eye wasn’t on him. It took two years for Peter’s powers to become noticeable.
A mission was the last thing Steve wanted to deal with, but it was his duty as both an Avenger and Captain to take part in it. If he could have it his way he would stay behind and suggest someone else take over, but leading the team was his responsibility.
His head snaps up when a knock on the door fills his ears. The doctor is entering the room, a warm smile on her face.
Peter tries to imagine what response his papa would give him if he were standing right in front of him. He wonders if his papa would tell him to continue trying to create a relationship or to forget it and move on. But Peter couldn’t move on. He couldn’t even move on from the loss of his father.
Steve cowers and forms himself into a ball, whimpering when Pierce gets too close. “No. No! No please!” Steve pleads when he’s yanked by the ankle and dragged closer. He scrambles, kicking out and successfully hitting the alpha in the stomach.
“Stop,” Sam says again, this time a little firmer. “You’re upset and I get that, but threatening to kill the kid’s last parent is wrong.”
“Who’s it from?” Steve asks, brows furrowing slightly. Leave it to Tony to ignore the name printed on the tag and go straight for the contents inside the bag. Tony doesn’t respond, too busy taking out a package of bottles and a bottle cleaning kit.
He breathes through the pain until the contraction ends and he’s able to relax again. He stands up straight, one hand finding his belly and rubbing the spot where his daughter was currently positioned.
Eventually Peter is latching on and nursing, the sound of his greedy sucking filling the room. Steve watches his son eat for a moment before he’s letting his head tip back. His eyes flutter and he quickly catches himself. He can’t fall asleep now. But his body demands that he do. Steve’s eyes flutter again until they’re falling shut.
Tony frowns. The event was still fuzzy in his mind. He remembered bits and pieces, but for the life of him he couldn’t remember how he had gotten home. It hadn’t been the first time, but there was something off about this time.
“Is he? Tony, I’m still scared,” Steve admits. “I swear I’m trying not to be but I am. I belonged to him and he’s not going to give up so easily. He wants me. He wants our baby.”
All Tony can do is awkwardly watch as Natasha comforts his son. He wants to swoop in and console Peter too but he stays back, deciding to let Natasha take this one.
“Uh…” Flash turns to Peter, silently begging him to do something. Peter only shrugs. “I just found out so…I-I don’t know.”
She turns her head in Steve’s direction when he doesn’t respond, finding him already asleep. She smiles and adjusts the blankets around him.
“Dammit!” Tony curses suddenly, the sound of his outburst grabbing Steve’s attention. Steve whips his head around, frowning at the disgruntled expression on Tony’s face.
There’s a moment of silence between them before Steve continues. “Do you think...do you think we have him for a reason?”
Hello! This is it, guys! Baby Peter is coming! I can't wait to introduce him and for Steve to meet his baby. Hope you all are doing well!
Steve is helped into a gown and his clothes are placed into a large plastic bag before being set aside. He’s carefully helped onto the bed and positioned to lie back with his head resting against the pillows.
Peter is obviously nervous when Morgan is placed in his arms, but he’s calming down when she doesn’t fuss like he expected her to.
The alpha above him keeps him pinned tight while he works his slacks open to free himself. Steve’s stomach twists painfully and he squirms, trying to get away from the man. But then the same warning is being said back into his ear and Steve has no choice but to comply.
He flinches when Tony reaches out for him. Steve whimpers when Tony’s hand brushes against his cheek.
Maybe this was his chance to be different, to have something he’s thought about for the longest time. He could finally have a family.
Happy honks the horn again and the man jumps away. Tony cranes his neck to get a better look, his curiosity getting the best of him. He was used to having pedestrians jumping in front of the vehicle, but there was something different about this one.
“He’s fine, Tony. He just wants love too.” Steve props himself up on his elbows and calls the dog over, earning another groan from his boyfriend.
His begging goes ignored and Steve tries to focus on his mate, but it’s painful to see him in so much pain. It was Steve’s fault. He got them into this mess.
“You know it’s not always about you.” Tony sits up quickly and turns to face Steve. “I get that you’re tired or you’re annoyed or whatever, but I’m just as tired as you are. I’m fucking pregnant!”
“Doesn’t feel good.” Tony grunts and pushes again, listening to the instructions to bear down a little harder. He’s offered a chance to feel his son’s exposed head, but he holds off, deciding to not waste any time and just get the baby out. He wanted to be rid of the excruciating pain.
Just thinking about his last night with Alpha makes him almost lose his appetite. He shuts his eyes, a shaky breath leaving him when he’s forced to endure that night. He can almost smell him, can almost feel his touch. Steve shudders at the memory and he wraps both arms around himself. He never wants to think about that night again. And maybe he’ll never have to. He was a free omega now.
Peter eventually comes down to the kitchen to join his father, still groggy and struggling to wake up. Steve shoots him a smile, getting a tired one in return.
Much to Tony’s disappointment and Steve’s relief, Peter doesn’t wake. Tony keeps his head on Steve’s belly anyway, softly speaking to his son.
The drive is one of the most awkward drives Tony has ever been on. He was used to driving alone and blasting music or being in the backseat and having a conversation with Happy. For a moment he regrets not bringing Happy along, but then he remembers how he had acted yesterday and Tony did not need Happy grilling him right now.
Peter mentally screams at himself as he waits outside the occupied classroom. Any minute now the class would be released and Flash would be among the group of free students. It was also the only class where Flash’s entourage wouldn’t be around.
“Hey.” Tony comes over the second a sob tears from Steve’s throat. He drops down to his knees in front of his mate and reaches for his hands. “Honey, you’re not a bad mom. You can never be one. He’s not even here yet and I can see how much you love and care for him.”
A small sob rips from Bucky’s throat and Sam holds him tighter, comforting him with soft words and gently threading his fingers through his hair.
“I know, I know.” Tony presses his lips against Peter’s messy hair. “Have you thought about a costume yet?”
Tony nods and smooths his thumbs over Steve’s knuckles. “I can keep it simple. Whatever you want to do today we’ll do it.”
It’s difficult being back and trying to go on like everything was normal when it clearly wasn’t. Peter can’t help but look at everyone differently. He wonders if his classmates are struggling too. They had hardships too. Worrying about tests, finding time to get the pile of homework done, and wondering what college to apply to weren’t the only things that made being a highschooler hard.
“You’re okay,” Tony whispers when Steve emits a small whimper and curls up against Tony’s side. “It’ll all be over soon.”
It finally registers that he is probably breaking bones and Steve releases Happy’s hand. “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean-”
Steve pokes his head out of the connecting bathroom, failing to hide his amusement at the sight. “He looks comfy,” he says with a small shrug, then he’s disappearing to the bathroom again.
Peter shakes his head and slips the photo back into his pocket. “I don’t know. He’s...I don’t think he cares. I can do this alone.”
Bucky answers instead. “Obviously not. He’s been going behind our backs and then lying to us. Did you think we wouldn’t find out? Did you think we were stupid?”
Someone is approaching him, but Peter can’t bring himself to look. A part of him wants to tell them to go away, but the words never form.
Tony frowns at the defensive tone his son was using. Peter was usually calm and collected; he didn’t have outbursts. Or maybe he did and Tony was starting to learn about it. There was still more he needed to learn about his son.
Pepper’s eyes widen and Tony prepares himself for the next round of yelling. She doesn’t scream or yell like Tony thought she would. She collapses into the empty chair, a shocked look appearing over her face.
Sleep doesn’t come, not that he was expecting it to. Going to bed angry with Steve made it impossible to get any sleep. Tony let his mind wander, wondering if Steve was struggling just as much as if he was or if he was perfectly content sharing the bed with the dog.
I got some new ideas for this story and I can’t wait to write it! Some is angsty and sad but this whole story has been this way so 🤷♀️
Dodger barks again and licks along Tony’s hand, then he’s running toward the opposite side of the room and trotting back over with a stuffed lion in his mouth. He stops beside Steve, dropping the toy in Steve’s lap.
Anyway! Peter could be on the way...maybe...I don't know. But at least Steve has Happy and they're getting along.
At the sound of his name, Steve turns to glance over his shoulder, finding Sam standing at the top of the stairs. Steve sniffs and quickly wipes at his eyes, doing everything he can to hide the fact that he had been crying.
and whatever else the kid liked to talk about, but Peter remained silent, refusing to mutter a single word.
“I wasn’t there when it happened. The explosion came out of nowhere; caught everyone off guard. Sam found Tony first-”
“It’s going to be okay.” Natasha applies more pressure, hating the cries of pain Steve makes. “You’re getting out of this.”
“Yeah.” Bruce nods again and leans back in his seat with a tired sigh. “To tell you the truth it gets a little tiring. That’s not me saying I don’t like helping you because I do,” he adds quickly.
Tony returns a few minutes later with a beta man with dark, curly hair and glasses. Steve sniffs the air, finding comfort in the beta scent. He instantly relaxes.
“How’s Tony Junior?” Tony’s hands find their way to the spot where their son was growing and currently stretching. Tony smiles from the movement and rubs his hand over the bump. “He’s gonna be a stinker.”
“Yeah.” Steve nods and he picks at the top of the muffin. “I know. Your scent...coffee is the first thing I smell.”
“He really didn’t,” Tony adds, his brows still furrowed as he looks over the picture again. He finally hands it back to his son. “So how do you feel?”
Steve finds the strength to break free from Tony’s grasp and he shoves him off. Tony stumbles backwards, quickly catching himself.
Tony pulls out and rolls over to lie beside Steve, completely spent from their round of fucking. “Fuck,” Tony pants, running his fingers through his already disheveled hair. “That was-remind me why we’re ending this?”
“N-no,” Steve stammers. He lifts his head from where it’s been resting on Bucky’s shoulder, showing off more of the purple and black bruises. “I’m fine. I don’t need-”
I still feel so bad for Peter. He’s hurting and all he wants is for Tony to step up and be there for him. Tony’s trying...I guess. He needs to work harder though!
Sam smirks and leans in close to connect their lips. The distraction they desperately need is interrupted by a loud meow. Sam huffs in annoyance and glances down at the white cat that purrs and rubs against Bucky’s leg. Bucky smiles and scoops her up, cradling her like a baby and kissing her head.
Peter stops swinging when something catches his eye. He lands on the rooftop of a building to investigate, his heart clenching painfully at what he finds. On the wall of the building beside the one he’s on is a painted image of his papa. The artist had captured the famous captain perfectly. For a moment Peter believes he’s looking at the real thing.
Sunday morning proves to be the best time to get work done. Usually it was the day of the week where everyone barely lifted a finger, and instead spent the day relaxing before the start of another workweek. Morgan’s household was no different. Her parents didn’t have to train her brother and their jobs weren’t stealing them away. Even Harley decided to sleep in.
Tony leans back in his chair and folds his arms over his chest. “We met?” He asks, gesturing between the two of them. “Can you be more specific? I meet a lot of people and I think I’d remember you. I mean, you do seem very familiar.”
“I can’t do this,” he says to himself. He means the party, but deep down those words mean so much more. He can’t raise this baby alone. He can’t do it without Tony.
Tony groans in annoyance and with Steve’s help, rolls over onto his back. He keeps his eyes on the ceiling, face heating up when gloved fingers investigate his entrance. He’s glad he can’t feel her probing fingers.
“It’s a little different,” Sam says. “What he’s going through and what your group is going through aren’t going to be the same.”
Steve nods and chokes back another sob. “I know. I hope they didn’t suffer. They didn’t deserve that, Tony. They should’ve lived. I should’ve been a better mother to them.”
“No,” Steve shakes his head. He knows exactly what Tony’s referring to. “We haven’t had sex and the last test I took was negative. I can’t get pregnant.”
Tony responds with a small grunt. He’s close too, just a little more and he’d be spilling inside. His thrusts become harder, faster. Steve is crying out his name and his back lifts off the bed. Tony groans when his cock is squeezed by Steve’s tight heat.
Bruce sighs again. “I can’t be here all the time. If something happens you’ll need to call a doctor here-” Tony rolls his eyes and Bruce frowns. “This is serious!”
Silence passes between them. Flash doesn’t even look at him, and instead he keeps his gaze down at the floor.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says and presses a kiss to the side of Tony’s head. “I guess I ruined the mood, huh?”
Steve huffs out a small laugh. “I didn’t. The book was helpful to me so maybe it will be helpful for you.”
Steve sighs heavily and lays the test on the bathroom sink, eyes filling with tears that threaten to fall. Just outside the closed door is his husband, anxiously waiting for the results. Steve doesn’t have the heart to tell him that his body was incapable of conceiving a child.
The party was meant to celebrate them winning and saving an innocent man from the torture Hydra put him through.
“And it’s not because of her,” Steve says. He answers the question Tony had been wanting to ask. “I swear I’m happy we have her. I just...God, Tony I don’t know how to explain it. I’m sorry.”
Steve’s not sure how long they stay like this. He enjoys the warmth and comfort Tony brings. For the first time he feels content, he feels safe.
“Damn you, Rogers.” Steve is grinning now and Tony quickly points a threatening finger in his direction. “Wait, don’t get excited just yet. We can keep him but I swear to God if that dog-”
Instead of brewing a pot of coffee in the comfort of his own home, he snuck out of his tower to visit a local cafe just a few blocks from SI. Pepper was going to kill him.
Steve nods again. He liked the idea of his pups being out of the spotlight. Tony might be used to that sort of lifestyle but Steve and their children were not. Unfortunately, being mated to Tony meant having his face show up in a tabloid every now and then. But if he could keep the pups out of the media, at least for a while, then he’ll do it.
“Let’s just say I've seen this before.” Sam grins and sits down beside his friend. He gets a glimpse of the sketch Steve is working on. “So you’re designing suits now? In that case I need an upgrade.”
Steve carefully removes his fingers and adds more lube to his cock, then he’s leading it to Tony’s stretched and prepared hole. He presses in slowly, eyes flickering up when Tony grunts in response.
“Hmm.” Steve pretends to think it over, earning another dirty look. “I guess I could help you out. Oh wait I did. Remember when I said it was time to buy new clothes?”
Of course it was the party thrown for him that Peter enjoyed the most. That wasn’t saying his uncle’s breakfast wasn’t good, in fact, it was the best thing to to wake up to. And Peter couldn’t wait to wake up every morning to his uncle’s cooking.
After that they decorate for the party. Steve had done most of the work for Tony’s birthday and now it was the alpha’s turn. Steve refused to let Tony take on the decorating alone and assisted in anything that didn’t require heavy lifting or climbing a ladder.
Jarvis has already allowed Happy entry and the beta is lingering around the foyer. Steve sniffs the air, finding that Happy’s scent is pleasant. Maybe they’d be able to share a few words.
Steve hugs himself and cries, the sound shattering Tony’s heart into a million little pieces. Unable to break free and comfort his mate, Tony is forced to listen to his sobs.
“I don’t know. You are eating more, but your metabolism isn’t normal. You’re always needing the calories,” Tony argues.
Tony’s mood immediately shifts the moment he sees how happy Steve is. It’s almost like Steve’s attitude was infectious.
Steve takes a deep breath and glances up at the doctor, meeting his gaze for a moment before looking back down and fiddling with his hands.
Steve groans and twists his fingers into the cotton sheets again. He’s not expecting the beta to touch him and when he feels Happy take his hand, he jumps.
“Hear you.” Comes Steve’s voice and both the alpha and beta jump. Tony spins around to find Steve standing behind him. He didn’t even realize Steve had come into the kitchen; he’s so quiet.
“Steve wouldn’t have tolerated this,” Bucky grumbles and storms off toward the kitchen to get Alpine her dinner. She was now the spoiled one and getting whatever she wanted. Sam didn’t mind too much. He was just glad Bucky had a distraction.
Tony hums and he pulls away slightly so that their eyes can meet. “Why do I have the feeling this party was for you?”
They gather back into the living room to eat. It’s not surprising when the space is filled with their laughter and playful bantering. It reminds Peter of all the times when they’d gather like this. He misses it.
“I’m sure Pete won’t mind. Do we know if he even likes this guy? I thought Flash was that punk that constantly picked on him?”
Peter is cleaned up and dressed, then wrapped in a fluffy blanket and back in his mother’s arms. Tony makes sure to not interrupt the bond currently being formed between his son and mate. The smile on Steve’s face is unlike one Tony has ever seen. Steve looked happy. He was finally at peace.
It wasn’t just the fatigue and physical changes that were getting to him. He should be happy about the son he was given, and though a part of him is overjoyed with the idea of being a father, the other half is terrified and worried.
Tony complies and teases the tight ring of muscle. His fingers slide in easily, the abundance of slick Steve produces easing the way. Steve moans and throws his head back, panting heavily with every thrust of Tony’s fingers.
Tony frowns and decides he’s had enough of arguing with the A.I. He goes to check on Steve instead, hoping to find him in high spirits. It’s wishful thinking. There was no reason for Steve to be at ease, not with his captor on the loose and searching for him. Tony’s not surprised that Steve has locked himself away. It’s how he felt safe.
Steve sighs sadly and gives up on setting the table to comfort his mate. He wraps his arms around Tony, bringing the alpha close and allowing him access to the mark on his neck. Tony inhales the moment his nose brushes against Steve’s neck.
Tony purses his lips. He doesn’t want to respond because he’s lost count of how many times Steve has come back looking like he got the beating of a lifetime. This wasn’t the first time and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be the last. Steve of course walked all of those instances off. He’d probably do it all again.
Tony chuckles. He could only imagine Steve’s reaction to find the kid crawling around the ceiling and walls like some kind of arachnid.
“-how do you feel about the baby?” Tony continues, trying to hide his smirk when the teenager stares up at him with wide eyes.
“Shh. I’ll do it, sweetheart. I promise.” Tony places another kiss over the sensitive area before trailing lower until the collar of Steve’s shirt prevents him from going any further. Tony leans back and runs his hands down Steve’s chest and torso, a smile forming over his face when he touches the bump. “I won’t hurt you,” he makes a promise to his son. His eyes flicker up to meet Steve’s. “Or you.”
The task of birthing their son comes easier now that Tony has Steve by his side. He relies on his husband’s soothing words and gentle touches to help him get through the painful experience. It’s still difficult to fathom that Steve had been in the same position.
The last person Tony expected to see was Alexander Pierce. It had been weeks since their last encounter, and honestly, Tony thought they’d never cross paths again. It wasn’t that he didn’t like the man, but he wouldn’t consider them best friends. Even acquaintances wasn’t the right word to describe their relationship.
The elevator stops and the metal doors open. Steve’s stomach clenches at the two familiar faces that greet him. It’s not just Rumlow and Rollins; a few more of Hydra’s men are with them.
“Shut up,” Bucky mumbles and comes over to lean down to kiss Sam on the lips. “I fucking hate you sometimes.”
“It’s amazing. Wow.” Tony lowers himself until he’s at eye level with Steve’s belly. He carefully lifts up Steve's shirt until smooth skin is revealed. His hands roam over the bump, his smile growing when the pup moves around. “Hey, kiddo. Guess you’re awake too, huh? I’m uh...I’m not really good at this, but...I’m trying. I want to be a good dad.”
The door opens and all eyes fall on the red-haired alpha. She keeps her distance to avoid frightening the small pups.
They stay wrapped in each other’s arms, relishing in the comfort that only being with each other brings. For a moment the party is forgotten, all Tony cares about is making sure his mate is content. Steve was always going to come first.
Morgan is still crying when Tony steps through the front door of the apartment. Her cries have gotten louder, more painful to hear.
“Hey,” Tony says and he cups Steve’s face with both hands. “I’m not him. I’m not going to hurt you.”
Peter sighs and gets up from the bed to look for something to wear before he’s late for school. “No,” he says as he rummages through his dresser, tossing clothes over his shoulder as he searches for something that is both appropriate for school and his protruding middle.
The door is opening again and Tony is returning, an ice pack in hand and another can of pain relieving spray. “I got more,” Tony explains, giving the can a little shake before setting it down on the small table near Steve’s bed. “Oh and these guys,” Tony gestures toward the still open door.
But now it was like all of the progress he made had been erased. He’s no longer taking steps forward, and instead it feels like he’s taken ten back.
All of the hardships and pain that it took to get to this moment had been worth it. His family had been worth the struggle and the fight. He would continue to fight for them.
Tony is locked up in his workshop when he gets the alert that Steve has returned home. He allows him access and pauses his work. It was about time they talked.
“I know a doctor and I can set up an appointment okay? Bruce is really nice. You’ll like him,” Steve says.
He’s only able to pull up the designs for Sam’s suit when Peter stirs and whimpers. Tony glances in his direction, waiting to see if his son would fall back asleep on his own or require assistance. Peter decides he needs help and he begins to cry.
The response had been so low that Tony was almost sure he had missed it. “Steve?” He asks, getting a nod in response. “Okay. Listen, I’m sorry about Happy almost hitting you back there.”
But he’s not that lucky and the pain returns again. He breathes steadily through it, doing everything in his power not to give himself away. His teammates didn’t need to worry about him now when they had a mission to take care of.
Tony sniffs and straightens up, forcing Steve to pull back. He turns so that he can face Steve. “It’s not your fault. You can’t blame yourself for this.”
Brock chuckles darkly. “You’re not going anywhere. Mr. Pierce won’t like his prized omega running away again.”
Tony huffs and runs a hand through his damp hair. He hated himself for what he had done. Hurting Steve wasn’t going to solve the problem and make it all go away. He loved Steve. He could never hurt him like the way he just did.
Steve is snapped from his thoughts when Tony touches him. The omega flinches and tries to pull his hand away, only to stop himself when he realizes there was no threat. It was just Tony. He was safe with him.
“Um.” Peter glances down at himself and frowns at the wrinkled state his t-shirt was in. He could easily hide it with his hoodie if had to.
The coffee is finished a few minutes later and Tony is filling the two mugs when Steve shuffles into the kitchen. Tony shoots him a smile, and this time he gets on in return.
“Are you gonna tell him?” Sam is the first to ask the question that’s been on everyone’s mind; Steve’s included.
“Fine,” Tony pouts. He comes over to join his son, doing what Peter had done and sneaking a piece of candy from the bowl. They both laugh from the fake hand. “Where’s papa?” Tony asks and he takes a bite from the mini Snickers bar.
Tony doesn’t appear to notice at first. He steps in, eyes everywhere else than where Steve would like them. Tony must be nervous. At least that’s Steve’s assumption.
Those words do little to offer assurance. He wasn’t fine. He was in labor and his husband was in another country. Nothing about his situation was fine.
“Did you...love him?” Peter asks. He’s ready to backpedal and ask about something else. It was already difficult for his dad to talk about his papa. “Sorry...you don’t have to say.”
Their hands are on each other again and their lips are moving at a much faster pace. The soft, gentle kisses they previously shared was replaced with a more harsher, desperate version.
When he enters the room, Steve immediately snaps his head up. He doesn’t appear any different from when Tony last saw him. But of course he had only been gone a few minutes. It wouldn’t be possible for Steve’s attitude to lift in such a short duration.
Sam sighs again and sits down beside his nephew. “I wish I could. I’d give anything to go back and change the way things went down that night.”
She’s wide awake and fussing in her crib, kicking her legs and flailing her arms. Her face is red and scrunched up, her cheeks already stained with tears.
“Papa, it’s okay,” Morgan tries to defuse the situation. She didn’t want her parents to fight again.
Natasha’s eyes well with tears and she lets out a shaky breath. Clint squeezes her shoulder again, reminding her that he was still there. She smiles sadly up at him.
Tony turns in his chair and takes Steve’s hands, pulling him close and between his legs. “I’ll be up in a minute. Are the kids asleep?”
“Papa,” he whispers into the darkness again. “should I...it’s dumb and...I don’t know. Should I find him?”
Hi! It's my birthday today and before it ends I wanted to post another chapter. I'm sorry I haven't been updating as much, but I'm trying to come up with a schedule. I hope this makes up for it!
Steve can’t help but flinch when Bruce begins the exam. Tony immediately senses his nervous energy and reaches for his hand, interlacing their fingers and offering a reassuring smile.
Steve smiles down at his son and runs his fingers through the messy brown hair. “I know. Jarvis isn’t...human.”
“He’s fine,” Steve assures, though he doesn’t entirely believe his own words. He gets up from his seat. “Let’s get started.”
He tries to forget about Tony during the visit with the doctor, but forgetting about Tony is harder than Steve ever thought it would be. It’s not until the doctor begins the ultrasound does Steve devote his full attention to the monitor.
Peter pulls away, whimpering softly for a moment before calming down. Steve adjusts him into an upright position, carefully following the instructions he had been given to burp his son. The nurse is nearby if he needs help, but he wants to do this on his own. Eventually, it’s going to be just him.
“Don’t. Don’t say stuff like that. He loves you.” Steve comes over to offer reassurance. He places a hand over Tony’s shoulder and rubs the area soothingly. “You’re an amazing father. I know how much you love him.”
“I didn’t even know there was a potential mission,” Tony can’t help the irritation that seeps into his tone when he talks to her over the phone. Natasha sighs on the other end. He knows she’s going to apologize.
Ned sighs, obviously not agreeing with Peter’s decision, but he doesn’t judge him for it. Ned was a loyal friend.
Now Tony knew who this man was. Alexander Pierce was the founder of the organization. It was his vision to see the world change and become better than what it was, what it has been. Tony’s heard it all before, but he allows himself to meet the man.
“Did you say-wait, how are you from-this doesn’t make any sense. You told me you were a breeder and now you’re telling me that back in the forties you were some kind of experiment?” Tony asks in disbelief.
The man points his gun, but Steve doesn’t give him a chance to pull the trigger. He grips the man’s wrist and twists, breaking the bones and forcing the gun from the damaged hand and onto the floor. Steve brings him down to the ground hard, the man’s head hitting the hard surface with an audible crack.
“Steve, wait,” Tony’s hand flies out to stop him from leaving. Steve stops and stares down at the spot where Tony’s hand is. Tony retracts his hand quickly. “Don’t go. Please. If you’re still upset with me-”
When it’s Steve’s turn to speak he finds himself shutting down. He peers up at the faces of the omegas who had already told their stories and the struggles they’re still facing. If they could do it then so could he. He could be strong.
Even if the pup didn’t belong to him he’d help Steve care for it. They weren’t mates, but things could change. Something was manifesting between them. Only time would tell.
“No. Don’t apologize. Don’t you ever apologize. I screwed up. You did nothing wrong, honey. It was me and I’m sorry. I don’t ever want to hurt you again. I’d never forgive myself if I let you slip away. I promised to protect you and Pete and I’m keeping my word. Please forgive me, Steve. Please.”
