, but Dean couldn’t complain. Apparently, his brother and sister-in-law didn’t cook. Dean thought it was a waste to have a kitchen this awesome and not use it, so he vowed to earn his keep by cooking for them.
. That was rich. The plan – Sam's plan – was to have Dean stay with him and Eileen, a woman he’d never met even though she and Sammy had been married for eight years.
“I’m fine, and it’s nice to see you too,” Ruby said, grinning. They took their seats and Dean strapped Claire into the high chair Kevin brought over. When he finally sat next to Castiel, he looked flushed, but he led the conversation by asking about Gabriel and Ruby’s flight. Castiel sat silent, still trying to piece together the puzzle.
Once more in the truck, Dean spoke again. “Look, Cas... I know you think...”
In the truck, Dean turned on his lights and siren and sped through traffic. Since they were dragging a boat trailer, people gave them a wide berth. While Dean did the driving, Castiel called Stefany. She didn’t ask him many questions. All he had to do was give her the facts as he knew them and she was catching the first flight to Houston.
“Animals, huh? You a vet?” He seemed genuinely interested and Castiel felt a kaleidoscope of butterflies in his stomach.
“I’m not from the south originally.” Castiel took a sip of his drink and the bartender turned to catch the ringing phone. Relieved he didn’t have to make more small talk, he took the time to send a text to Dean.
. Had it been his imagination?
He drove down Main Street and turned onto Livingston. There was a car parked in front of old Missus Howell’s house. Alabama tags. One of those fancy-assed hybrids. Dean wondered if the woman’s son was down to go through his mom’s stuff and sell the place. He’d only met the guy once. A real douche. Treated his mother like crap.
“Director Cain is going to flay you alive. This was a simple in and out mission, Novak.”
Castiel shook hands with Benny, received a hug from Charlie, and after a moment’s hesitation, shook Dean’s hand. He left the studio and wandered back to the green room. His handler never did make an appearance. Should he call a cab? He needed to find wardrobe and locate his own clothes. He just wanted to get back to his hotel for some peace and quiet. His big plan for his night in New York City was to have room service deliver his dinner, watch a movie, or perhaps find an interesting documentary.
“Not too young for you though.” She gave him a stern look. “When was the last time you went on a date?”
Dean followed them over to Claire’s crib. She’d be needing a toddler bed soon, but it would have to wait. The new furniture had put a severe strain on his credit cards. He settled the sleepy child under her quilt and then wound up the musical mobile over the crib. Soon, Brahm’s Lullaby began to play and little unicorns twirled slowly. They stood side by side, as Claire held onto her toes and watched the circling creatures. Her eyes eventually closed and Castiel took Dean’s hand and backed away.
Dean rattled off their order to Kevin and he disappeared. “May I?” Dean gestured for Cas’ glass.
,” she said looking angrily at Cas. “Both of you need an ass whipping. In my day...”
“We shall work on housetraining them right away,” Castiel said as he removed the silicone milking cups. He disposed of the liners and applied fresh ones for the morning milking.
“Just dinner?”
He watched Frank clomp up the steps in his orthopedic shoes and a few seconds later, Mildred came out. She gave Dean a critical look and then they both got in her ancient Oldsmobile. It was now or never. Dean knocked once and pushed the door open. “Cas?”
Hindsight is twenty-twenty, or so the saying goes, and in retrospect, Castiel should have taken the time to put on some clothes. He wasn’t prepared to greet an Adonis at his front door in Po-dunk, Alabama. He wasn’t a sucker for a uniform, not in his line of work, but damn, the man sure could fill one out in all the right places.
“You got that right,” Jody replied. Dean turned to see both women staring at him, pity could be easily read in their matching expressions.
“You built that?” Dean looked at the structure with professional eyes and Castiel tried not to cringe. He may have gone overboard with the design and the structure had taken up half the moving van, but he liked it. It resembled a hobbit house, complete with a rounded doorway and a glass-paned window. “That’s great, Cas.” Other than his family, no one ever shortened his name, but it rolling off Dean’s tongue so easily gave Castiel a thrill.
“Oh, I asked Luke to join us for a cocktail,” Becky said, patting his cheek as she rose from the couch.
“Yeah, just got in a few minutes ago.” Cas reached out to touch his wet hair.
. Please don’t hug me became a silent mantra. Sam must have picked up on his vibe and he patted Dean on the shoulder instead.
Ruby stood up and began picking up the toys and putting them in a large rattan hamper. "Gabe said you won the competition. We knew you would," she said proudly.
Castiel looked at the camera, something he was more comfortable with after eight months. “Dean is correct, you will have to find room in your refrigerator. Please don’t use a cooler unless you live where it is less than forty degrees outside. Then you can put it out on your back porch or tuck it in your garage. You never want your bird to get below that temperature.”
“Not interested,” Sam said, walking fast. Dean hurried to catch up. He slid to a stop at Old Navy.
“The best ribs this side of the Mason-Dixon line,” Frank said, getting up hand Castiel his mug to wash. “I’ll be here when y’all get back. It’s too hot for this old man to be wondering around looking at lions and tigers.”
“Doubt that. When is the funeral?”
Charlie laughed and Dean found that he liked the sound. “You’ll catch on to the terminology, don’t worry. Besides, you don’t have to know it all. The crew will love you as long as you feed them.”
The mother had been brought to the Doctors Without Borders base camp before dawn, a victim of local violence in the port city of Tumaco. Cas and Dean had done their best to save the young teen, but the three gunshots did too much damage. She had no identification and there was no wedding band on her finger. She’d been almost a child herself. They’d delivered the child and while the infant was small, she seemed healthy.
“You ever see Adam?” Dean asked to draw the attention away from himself.
“Then how can you be so fucking calm? If what you say is true, there’s a giant alligator out there that gets his jollies by killing... things.” Dean didn’t want to imagine if those cattle turned into people.
“You have the right to remain silent…” Cas said, his voice husky with want and need. Dean felt the cool metal and then heard the clink of the cuffs as they snapped around his left wrist.
The heebie jeebies set in. That thing was on him. That eight-legged freak was on his arm. He screamed again and did the icky dance, not caring how he looked. Cas was staring at him, eyes holding a gentle fondness and a touch of humor. “Dean... Dean... it’s okay. I’ve got him.”
“At Castiel’s farm,” she said, looking at him like he was a few French fries short of a Happy Meal.
Castiel huffed out a laugh. “Not me. I’m way down on the totem pole. In the world of Novak Oil, I’m just a scientist, and the baby brother.”
Castiel worked himself into a rage in the elevator, but once he was in his hotel room, he did his best to calm down. Over dinner, he'd started liking the handsome chef, but the stunt in the SUV pissed him off. He supposed things came easy for the Dean Winchesters of the world. Well, he wasn't easy. He stopped having one-night stands when Anna died leaving him to raise his newborn niece. At eighteen months, Claire was his life now. He didn't have time for a roll in the hay with the likes of the celebrity chef, as tempting as it was.
“Five minutes, Dean. Besides, I have news.”
“If Cas says it will work, it’ll work,” Dean said, lifting the cooler. He left the explosives for Ketch to handle. He’d given brief introductions. Names only. If anyone was curious about Ketch, they kept it to themselves.
“I won’t keep you...”
“Yes, well, when Jack was younger, we spent a lot of time hiking and I’d hoped he would become a rock-hound like me, but he was more interested in drawing pictures.”
“This isn’t about… just… fuck you, Cas.” He wouldn’t be the first to look away. He waited and then saw the moment Cas got it.
“This music. I can handle show tunes, Mozart, and golden oldies just as much as the next guy, but when I’m driving, I need something that will keep me awake.”
The trip to Edinburgh and the surrounding towns had proven lucrative. Inside this crate was a stunning tea service, sterling silver and all the pieces were there. He’d also found several items of costume jewelry dating back to the seventeenth century and various other small treasures. The screech of the nails leaving the wood gave him goosebumps, but they were forgotten when he looked down into the packing material. The shipping company had done a wonderful job of protecting his investment.
“Fine,” she snapped and ran down the hall. He winced as her bedroom door slammed.
“This is the best omelet I’ve ever tasted. What is your secret?”
“No, you said Wally World. You said it had everything I’d need,” Castiel informed her, confusion marring his brow.
Pretty Boy… he really needed to stop calling him that since he’d almost slipped up a second ago… was frowning at the poor girl.
“He’s a homophobe,” Castiel said matter-of-factly.
“Since last night?” Castiel muttered, closing the door behind them. Mildred had cooked something called chicken and dumplings for dinner. It was good, but he’d definitely have to beef up his exercise regime with the calorie bombs that were constantly being thrown at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is it commonplace for people to… slap your… butt?”
Dean put Claire down with her toys and was in Castiel's personal space within seconds.  When he took Castiel's hand in his, he tried to pull away. "I'm okay...just wasn't paying attention." His train of thought derailed when Dean wrapped his hand around his wrist and held a paper towel to the cut. Castiel knew Dean could feel his pulse rate increase.
Cas released his now flaccid cock and sat back on his haunches, looking even more satisfied than Dean if that was possible. He stood up with all the grace of a dancer in the Royal Ballet. Dean’s eyes drifted down to the bulge straining against the orange material. Dean, his heart still pounding from that mind-blowing orgasm, pushed him backward until he was sprawled on the bed, legs slightly spread. Cas’ smile was wry, but his gaze was warm.
“Tell him it’s Dean Winchester.”
“Because he’s an expert in reptiles.” Sam was giving him Bitch Face Number Thirty-Two, which translated to ‘
Castiel hugged her and whispered, “I have a good feeling too.”
He tapped his fingertip on the steering wheel, all the while, staring at the phone. On a whim, he touched zero, one, two, and four. The screen opened to a photo of a flower. Dean smirked. Leave it to Cas…
“I did,” she said, holding up a latex glove. “The oldies channel out of Montgomery.” Dean nodded, knowing it was probably irrelevant, but needed to check all the boxes.
? The guy's bio said he was looking for Mr. Right. Was there a Mrs. Right out there somewhere?
“Huh?”
He cocked his head to the side, grinned, and with a ‘come hither’ look over his shoulder, he strolled into his bedroom. Castiel was quick to follow, already unbuttoning his shirt. Disrobing didn’t take long. They didn’t make a romantic game of it. Each quickly stripped out of their own clothing, but their eyes didn’t stray from their partner’s.
“Finally,” Castiel muttered under his breath. He stood and followed the PA who herded them toward the back of the set.
Cas’ sharp voice rang out. “That spider is one of the most venomous in the entire world. I would have acted the same had it been on me. Ridiculing someone for being scared of a real threat is reprehensible. This man serves the public. He is one of the men and women who keep your homes safe from those that wish you harm. How dare you...”
“Yeah, I guess.” His voice didn’t sound convincing.
Dean shook his head. “No. I couldn’t do that to you, Cas. You had to know that, right?” Castiel heard the pain in Dean’s voice and the vice that had been gripping his heart since he’d read Anna’s journal released its hold.
What had he done? He went over their last conversation and texts. Cas had been fine. Fine. In a fit of anger, he swept his arm across his desk, sending paperwork everywhere. “Fuck,” he shouted. “Fuck.” Again, but louder.
“Drunk enough that you didn’t use a condom.”
Castiel sat down and was surprised that Dean sat across from him. “You’re eating with me?”
for me.”
Dean reached out and grabbed his hand, leading him to the large bed, now drenched in sunlight streaming through the windows. Castiel paused long enough to open the nightstand and when he found what he was looking for, he tossed them onto the bed. Dean watched and then licked his lips. “You plan on fucking me, Cas?”
“This guy is fuckin’ great,” Dean said to himself while he typed out a response. Dean was shaking his head after his last response when he decided to leave a little early. Dean got into the elevator and waited for the doors to open in the garage. Dean’s loft came with a garage under the building. It made the cost of the apartment over two million, but for a guaranteed parking spot in the city, it was worth it.  He didn’t drive his baby very often, but he kept her clean and purring like a…
“She will have her own room, Dean.” What was his problem? “Did you think an adult woman would want to share a room with her former teacher?”
“And I always will, Jack,” Castiel said, not wanting to let on how Jack’s words were affecting him. He was
. That was his mantra as he walked out of the prison that had been his home for the last fifteen years.
“I don’t know what was written in her grimoire, Dean. Madame Tran will tell us together.”
“The zoo?”
Five burly men, all in the typical blue polos of the zoo staff entered the room. John’s eyes were huge as he watched them wheel the croc out through the double-swinging doors. “She should be awake in about ten minutes,” Castiel informed them as he removed his latex gloves. To his three visitors, he motioned toward them to follow him. “This room is just one of the exam rooms. I do small procedures here. We have a large surgery suite we all share for bigger cases.”
Dean was slow and easy for a time, enjoying the slide of their bodies. The pace picked up after a few minutes and they fucked fast and hard with Dean on top thrusting into Cas, bending down to share a kiss or a whispered word. Then they moved onto their sides, Dean pounding into Cas from behind, his thighs tangled with the older man’s. Another move and both men were on their knees, Cas holding onto the headboard, Dean taking him rough, Cas’ screams of ‘fuck me’ echoing off the walls. Dean didn’t think he could make it last as long as it did, but when his muscles began to constrict… his balls tightening… he knew he was close. He reached around and grasped Cas’ cock. It was slick with his arousal. Dean’s hand slid up and then down, and Cas’ body seized… he grunted once… twice and Dean felt hot cum coating his hand. He threw back his head and chased his own orgasm, thrusting again and again.
“No, please, give me another chance. We were good together, weren’t we?” Castiel caught the trapped look in Dean’s expression. It might not have been his smartest decision, but he was making it on the fly. Dean could get mad at him later.
“Dean has class. It was a joke and I took it wrong. I’m the one without social skills. Dean has class,” he repeated. Without turning his head, he knew his brother and sister-in-law were both staring at him in shocked amazement.
Dean stared at him and Cas could almost hear the wheels turning in Dean’s mind. “So… what… you want to adopt her?”
That’s when he felt it. Something was crawling on his arm. He looked down and screamed. Flailing his arms. The spider was sent airborne, landing near Benny, who scrambled away like a crab. Cas raced forward and plopped a specimen jar over the things. It was fucking huge.
“I’ll be ready,” Dean said and walked away. He was shocked that Cas didn’t try to follow him. He found himself in the middle of the rotunda and Lydia was instantly at his side. “I’m going back to my room and change out of this monkey suit.”
“Fuck... look, if she gets hurt or causes one of my people to get hurt...”
“Food allergies?” Castiel leaned back in his chair and Dean did the same.
The film crew was to meet him at the chocolatier at nine the next morning and he was supposed to catch at three o'clock flight back to New York. He changed the flight time to eleven, so he'd have plenty of time to spend time with Cas. He could sleep on the airplane with a little help from Jack Daniels.
“Well, fuck,” Bobby said, pouring himself another shot.
“Who are you?”
“There’s my princess,” Dean cooed and she held out her arms. Cas looked a little rumpled. “You okay there, Cas?”
“Why?”
“You never catch these vandals. The mayor said we needed to recruit some law enforcement officers coming out of the academy. Not that you’re washed up or anything...” He let the sentence hang, wanting Dean to take the bait.
“Cas...” They both spoke at the same time.
Cas saved him from having to let the kid down by coming out of the barn with his stupid tablet. “I think you mentioned coming up with a menu before we go shopping.” So, he was going to be cool about the whole incident with his boyfriend. Dean could get behind that.
“Slow down. Meg just said yes today. There are procedures and...”
As Castiel washed up in the milking shed sink, Dean stood by waiting his turn. “Please don’t feel that you have to participate in the farm’s day-to-day running. You are more than welcome to remain in the house and watch television or... whatever.” Castiel had no idea what Dean would want to do to keep himself from being bored.
“Good, thank you for gracing us with your presence, Dean,” Crowley said snidely. Dean was only five minutes late and the roll of his eyes told Crowley he didn’t care about his bullshit. He took his normal seat next to Benny. “Castiel, you will fly in Tuesday night and be at the tapings Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. I emailed the segment schedule to you. Do you have it?” Crowley asked as he passed out the schedule to the others in the room.
man. If you want to prove your dick is bigger than mine, I suggest we do it after my work is done.”
Breath
"Nope, me? never..." Castiel chuckled, his eyes then traveled on the menu.
, he was already hard.
"Where are your packmates?" he muttered to himself as he continued feeding the predator, who hungrily lapped at the canned meat.
person.
, he hadn’t the right to look at Castiel like he was the only one in the whole universe or calling him
A few moments later Dean folded the draft and pushed it under the chair, then his bulky biceps wrapped around Castiel's chest and shoulder, traveling on every inch of his tanned skin.
don't be afraid..." Green-eyes said lifting his hands up in surrender, "I can explain..."
He sat alone.
"These look yummy," he agreed, looking at the deliciousness in front of him.
Yet, he’s still with
The wolf unexpectedly perked its ears, his muzzle morphing into an angry hiss with sharp teeth showing, eyes once again turning red shiny rings.
A wide grin from the man answers him positively.
, the wolf’s eyes were so familiar.
Castiel woke when he heard whispers all over him. He slowly opened his eyes, his head hurt a bit but his back burned.
Wrapping his one arm around Dean's chest, gluing his back onto his chest, Castiel traveled where his hand ached to do all this time after he first faced him.
"You ain't getting me rid that easily, you're stuck with me, Castiel Winchester..."
"Cas?"
Cas didn't sleep for long, jolting awake every hour or so. Once, he jerked out of the cold grip of a nightmare, it was already morning.
“Cas has feelings for me…” he chokes.
Dean furrowed his eyebrows confused, "
Cas doesn’t get the chance to say more before Dean pins him down into the nearest wall.
"Gonna make you mine
Dean was caring and he said he loved Castiel, which was the painful part, who loves someone and quits them without doing something wrong?
"Show me..." Castiel offered his neck to his Vampire.
"Bye, Dean."
"Mm..." Cas purred, he might be sore as hell but there's a warm spark encircling his chest, he pulled Dean impossibly closer. He buried his face in Dean's hair and breathed in deeply.
They stayed some moments tangled, Castiel nuzzling Dean's jaw and Dean nosing his now almost dry hair. It was comfortable if you exclude the chilly sand of course
"Thanks to you, I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have you..." The green-eyed man pulled him even closer as he kissed his temple with warm and soft lips.
, blah blah...It's fucking annoying, he hasn't shut up about you! I'm starting to think he is in love with you like you are with him..."
"Cause you're
And Cas knows it, it's
Closing it, he smirked once again devilishly and watched the men inside the cell scream from pain, hissing at the storm Castiel created inside their minds.
Especially when Dean started to look at him like a hungry wolf,
Dean started walking towards him, eyes dark, expression hard and pissed. Cas' face fell from fear,
Cas groaned so sexily Dean thought he could cum from it.
It doesn’t matter anyway.
He didn’t believe shit,
Cas looks at him with wide eyes and a confused frown.
"Fuck." Dean moaned resting his head on Castiel's shoulder, his own cock already painfully hard pressing against Dean's hip.
After taking a breath, he felt Cas’ hand caressing his cheek softly, he didn’t even realize it, but he could see his eyes still shining red from the reflection of Cas’ ocean blue eyes.
Dean took his hand and pulled him into his chest.
His best friend's hand caressed his cheek softly and gently,
. Castiel would appreciate it so much more if his mind wasn’t running through how much danger Gabriel was.
Castiel gulped, his blood freezing at the sight of the vampire. His lustful dreams starting playing inside his mind.
“Good.”
After a long-ass day, —
Then wrapping his plump lips around the large tip, Castiel gave him a long hard suck, hollowing his cheeks before getting up and pushing Dean with a bit of magic towards the bed. The Barbar was a whimpering mess, his cock red, needing attention. Castiel smiled devilishly and then glanced at his own leaking length.
After going to the bar and drinking his ass off, trying to forget a certain someone Dean returned to his loft. He wasn't drunk but tipsy, and those blue eyes were still curved in his damn brain. It felt deja-vu, last night was similar to tonight, don't let him start about every time Cas goes on a date.
Okay, Cas. It's okay. You're fine,
"Reserare."
Castiel felt like he was in heaven. Dean always made him feel like that, the pleasure this man was giving him was out of this world. He couldn’t imagine anyone else doing this to him.
They started chatting again about everything and nothing, what Cas' favorite AC/DC song was and how he became an accountant and generally the stupidest things, apparently, they were both such dorks.
Castiel tightened his hold on Dean's hips, slotting their bodies together while one of Dean's hands came up to cup his clothed dick.
Dean gasped, bringing his hand on top of Cas' head, running his thick fingers in Cas' dark hair.
"You really want a divorce? " Castiel choked hoarsely, the first tears after that nightmarish night finally rolled down his cheeks.
.  It was probably dead, completely still, it's golden-green eyes open and glassy and its tongue lolling out.
"We're gonna have so much fun..."
Cas' blue eyes sparkled as he waited for Dean's next sentence and fuck, the green-eyed man, gulped.
Dean choked as he came, Castiel’s eyes rolling into his brain from the pleasure. Seconds later he was coming as well, orgasm erupting out of his cock, literally untouched.
If Castiel hadn't tutored Sam on an art project, for one of his High School courses last year, he would never have met Dean, or some of his best friends today.
Cas tries to hold the tears as his heart breaks piece by piece, this isn't happening, this was never supposed to be this serious.
A warm feeling blossoms into his chest but Castiel quickly pushes it aside. This man will drive him fucking insane. Inhaling a shaky breath, he feels his knees shaking.
Cas' lip disappeared between his teeth, as he put his hands behind his head, moaning groaning as he watched Dean thrusting into him fast and deep as his cock was hard and leaking,
, think about it." Cas' eyes never left Dean's and Dean's never left Cas' as he finished his last sentence.
"No, no," Dean reassured him, giving him a gorgeous smile, " You haven't mentioned the miniature thing though, that is nice...I love to build things too. My things are just a bit different, but, same. Love cars, made my 'baby' all by myself. Took some years but she's here and she's gorgeous."
Dean growled pissed, body shaking angrily. "I'm gonna kill you..."
Two hunters were dead though, Jody the leader, smiled at him after he threw his gun in the trunk, and said he was born to do this, Castiel felt a bit awkward but smiled, his wolfs were the best, and he knew they’ll never hurt anyone, Dean will make sure anyway.
He didn't have a chance with the green-eyed jock anyway. It was just a small dream.
He nuzzled Cas’ cheek and stole a kiss on his jaw.
“What the fuck did you do again?” Benny asks not surprised at all. It makes Castiel think that Dean always does dangerous shit that no one is impressed anymore.
He hadn't slept that night, crying himself awake, one part of him was relieved that he ended this arrangement they had, the sex was amazing, but the feelings were not.
everything went well after that. (expect his Xanax poisoning overdose) He and Dean were now closer than ever, and every doubt he ever had disappeared from Dean's love and how amazingly his handsome green-eyed man treated him.
When the kids took Hazel to play they both stared at each other, Dean felt courage swell in his chest, Cas was perfect, and he was kinda falling for him, even knowing him for almost two days, he felt he knew him longer, he also craved for his touch.
The taller man was already in front of Cas, their chests touching as Dean still watched him with shiny red eyes. Cas felt relaxed when the werewolf placed his hands on his hips and leaned in.
Cas is his.
Castiel moaned when he felt the Alpha’s tongue traveling his whole mouth, he almost forgot how talented Dean was.
Before he could apologize Dean spoke.
Dean almost bit his tongue not to blurt how hot he was, sure bros complement each other, but bros also don’t want to take their bro and push him against a wall and
After knocking nervously on the door of Dean's and Sam's small flat, Castiel tried to ignore his shaky hands. Dean's loud cries echoing in his ears.
His green-eyed fool friend is too blind to notice.
Cas." Dean then said growling possessively as he lifted the smaller man into his arms, Castiel immediately wrapped his legs around Dean's waist and then around his shoulders having a huge grin as he let the bigger man slip wet kisses on his neck.
Cas coughed awkwardly blushing even more, “Um, maybe you should wear something…” his tone was playful.
He doesn’t think when he grabs the blue-eyed man’s arm, yanking him off the British jerk.
“Hey, hey… don’t move…You are fine, he’s here, with Benny, Charlie, and Bobby...you scared us.” Castiel assures getting up to stop Dean from moving.
? A guilty feeling encircled him in an instant.
Dean pressed a feather kiss to his neck right over his pounding pulse point. He licked his lips and groaned out a warm puff of air that made Castiel shiver, then sharp fangs plunged into Castiel's skin.
He ran as quickly as he could, stumbling down to the wolf who protected him. The poor animal was breathing heavily, eyes back to their beautiful natural color.
A dull pain throbs in his chest, Dean is frozen, and he feels his heart breaking into million pieces.
Castiel got close to the counter, his hands in fists clenching hard as he waited patiently for the woman to tell him the information to where to go.
Then their lips met once again into a filthy kiss.
But he needed more, he was hungry for the older man’s lips.
"Thanks, Cas, glad you like it."
The music artist felt his heartbeat quicken, and then he stopped when he noticed a head resting in his lap groaning and moving.
but that doesn't change the way I feel about you..." Dean said almost sober, wrapping his arms around Cas' waist.
Cas gulped.
Castiel watched as the smaller animals ran away, disappearing from the scenery, the one limping slightly and the other blindly moving its head here and there.
..." Dean kissed him down into a soft, warm kiss, gentle and full of promise and hunger. Cas moaned tiredly, lazily wrapping his arms around Dean's neck.
When the sun fully rose and the birds' screaming had slightly softened, Cas decided to head back. He still had to make a small diner for tonight, nothing fancy but something to bring back some old good memories.
Castiel felt sick, his stomach in a hundred knots.
Cas' head jerked when he heard Dean's voice, laced with panic and stutter.  The green-eyed man was looking down at his shoes as he loosely held Carmen's hands, Dean was pale as paper, avoiding everybody's eyes.
The crowd went wild when he jumped on stage with a huge smile, the lights were blinding and they were some fireworks welcoming him that went with the beat of the song. Castiel glanced at his band and smiled again, putting an act that obviously no one would notice.
Dean chuckled, but his eyes darkened. He crawled forward, and Cas reached out and slipped his fingers around Dean's cock, a soft, desperate noise leaking out. The green-eyed man's cock was beautiful, nestled in light brown curls and long and thick, it hung heavy between Dean's legs, the slit already shiny with precome. Cas slid his hand down its mouth-watering length, reveling in the smooth slide of the skin over the full hardness underneath.
“Hey, I’m here…” he said, smiling sheepishly.
Castiel smirked when Dean’s green eyes met his. He looked at him stunned and very intensely. Castiel could see the lust and hunger in the older lad’s handsome face.
It has been 1 month since he saw the man he fell accidentally. The man he made the mistake of loving, even with no return of those feelings back.
The younger artist pushed the trembling feeling of how he missed the older lad. They hadn't spoken for a month and a half. He itched to step even closer and touch Dean.
“What happened?” Cas asked puzzled, deep down though, he knew what he might did. He wants to freaking scream from frustration.
“Is he watching?” she yell-whispered in his earl as the music was loud as hell.
“Guys, stop! We all know there’s one way, I understand some of you don’t agree but we have no time, we need them…” Sam said sighing.
Turning around, Dean met the bluest eyes ever. The man in front of him was gorgeous--even if he looked panicked--his hair was dark and messy and he wore a size bigger black trenchcoat. He looked like he was in Dean's age, with a dark  9 o'clock shadow decorating his jaw.
He should have ended things when it was still early to catch these
Dean cut himself off and his eyes dropped to where Cas' lips were.
“They won’t Benny, you know that,” Dean assured him, giving him a knowing wink.
“Nice to see you too, Jody,” Bobby said easily.
"I don't need to date. I've got Claire and friends...and the restaurant. I don't want or need a man in my life, especially one as cocky as Dean Winchester." Castiel realized his mistake as soon as the words left his mouth.
“I thought we’d start out at Bees Branch and work our way around the northern shore of Lake Houston. I’d like to start out in areas with recent sightings.” He pulled up his report on his laptop and showed Winchester the map with red pins where alligators have been reported.
He’d got through the first chapter of the book, but the past two days with little to no sleep, combined with
“No one is chasing me from my home,” Bobby said. “You take those boys and Sam’s wife somewhere safe. I’ll be alright.” He took the phone receiver off the wall and dialed. Castiel raised a brow, he hadn’t seen a phone like that since the eighties. “Dean, pack a bag, don’t say shit to anyone, and come here. No time for explanations. Just hurry, boy... Yeah, I’m calling Sam.”
“I needed rescuing?” Dean said, his head bowed.
“Scary Spice?” He looked perplexed for a few seconds and then he chuckled. “Meg. She doesn’t hate you, Dean. She’s just... protective.”
He pulled into the driveway of Bobby’s house. A light was on in the garage. He found him under the hood of a ‘79 Trans Am. “You’re working late.” It was close to two.
“If you say so, brotha’.” Benny stepped away and made his way back to the helm, where a dark-skinned man was steering them further and further away from civilization.
“And you are so lucky I do,” Cas called out sweetly.
“Shit... I’m sorry. I didn’t... I wasn’t thinking.” He eyed the bottle with longing. Cas put him out of his misery.
“I did this morning. I got up at six,” Dean said cheekily. Sam rolled his eyes and settled back against the counter.
“Oh,” Castiel mumbled. “Okay.” He wanted to kick himself. This was why he didn’t have many friends and he could count his past lovers on one hand.
“Well, sure, but the episodes don’t run as smooth,” Dean lied again.
“Yeah, sure. We’ll be back from the fair around three or four. I’ll just have Claire call you when we get home... if that’s okay.”
“Like I said, we haven’t been close since the twelfth grade. I don’t know what to tell you.” She shrugged her shapely shoulders and hitched the kid higher on her hip.
Dean managed to get everyone calmed down and separated the two parties. He left Lilith inside the library to cool her heels, while he took Milton outside. He tried to keep it professional, even asking for the man’s ID. He gave it a scan, noting the guy’s vital statistics, then handing it back. In the light of day, those eyes were bluer than blue. He was well on his way of turning on the charm when Mandy made her appearance and showed Milton how bad of a father he really was. Skank... boinked... Jesus H. Christ.
“I need to find wardrobe and change. Do you know how I’m supposed to get to my hotel? I believe my handler is MIA.”
“Fuck that,” Cain snapped. He reached forward and removed the brass nameplate that boasted his title from his desk. “Castiel, talk to me.” Castiel knew what that symbolized. Cain wanted candid conversation between friends and not between a boss and subordinate.
He would have a child. No,
“You don’t have anything to be worried about. Cas wouldn’t touch that with someone else’s ten-foot pole.”
Cas looked around and Benny said, “Outside the Greens Port Industrial Park. West side.”
was stenciled on the dark gray door. The announcer, Balthazar, was leaning against the desk of an attractive blonde woman. He looked up at Dean and smiled. “Dean,
“Uh, yeah, so... dinner.” Dean held up a familiar red and white bucket of chicken. In his other hand was a brown paper bag. Castiel couldn’t help but notice how Dean’s eyes stayed fixed on his face.
She bumped his arm with her shoulder. “Dumbass.”
“I’m sure it was great if Dean picked your recipe.” She smiled warmly and said, “I’ll leave you two alone now.”
“Threatened you? Are you kidding me? Honey, you aren’t worth my time.” Dean had to hand it to Milton, he wasn’t backing down.
The one thing he’d left unplanned in his hurry to get out of DC was a place to stay the night. Coosa Falls didn’t have hotels, motels, or even a bed and breakfast. He turned onto Oak. There was only one place he knew that he’d be welcomed tonight without explanation.
“Is that burning?” The man, Dean, turned, took the handle of the skillet and tossed the lightly browned bits of onion and garlic.
For Dean, lunch was usually spent at one of the outside tables alone. They staggered their breaks so someone was always available at the register. Even though Dean had been trained to be up front with the customers, he was still apprehensive and Cas seemed to know it, so for now, Kevin and Jack did that job. He hadn’t seen Meg since that first day. Dean knew she wasn’t his biggest fan and from what he’d heard from Kevin, Jack, and Cas, she ran the website and their social media from her home. She was some woman who was living off her dead husband’s money as far as Dean could tell. As long as she stayed out of his way, Dean was happy.
Ketch looked away, nodded, and pursed his lips before speaking again. “The one from the news?”
“Hey, Cas.” Dean went to his bin and dumped his lunch and car keys inside. He checked the clipboard on the wall to check out any new orders. “We got three dozen cupcakes going out today?”
“Is this the new boy?” The woman, Meg, came and stood across the table from him. Dean looked up, his piping bag held aloft.
“Yes? Was I supposed to guess?”
not think of sex with Dean.
“Empty nest already getting to you?” His mother asked, patting his leg.
Claire, lifted her arms and leaned forward, and Castiel passed her over. “I have a feeling I’m missing something.”
“Maybe I’m reading more into it...” Castiel let his words trail off. And maybe he was blowing it out of proportion. Gabriel stared at him over Pat Benatar's back. “I’ll be fine,” he assured his somewhat overprotective brother. “Please don’t say anything.”
“Wait…you seriously grind up kielbasa?”
“As long as you’re okay with it,” Dean shrugged and grabbed his jacket. “Let’s go.”
He felt Dean sit on the bed beside him, their hips touching. It shouldn’t have felt as pleasant as it did. It wasn’t skin on skin. It was platonic and not intimate at all.
“Dean, we need to track its movement...”
Cas’ words replayed in his head and he sat up, yanking Cas’ arm up and sideways. “God damn it, Dean. Did you forget we are cuffed?”
“I said no, Frank.” It was for the best. Not that Cas would have given him a sappy goodbye. Or even promised to call. Dean wanted to laugh. No, it was better this way.
“Yeah.” He knew, but if felt good to hear anyway. They ate in silence for a while, but it was comfortable. They were both loading the dishwasher when Sam let himself in. He kissed his wife and sniffed the air.
Dean swung the long chef’s knife around. “No, this is yours and your wife’s. I don’t fit in here.”
“You do not understand. If the demons or a rogue coven of witches take Sam or Eileen, they will use them to draw you out. They will take your blood. Oh, you will be kept alive, somewhere safe, in a hell you can’t even imagine. They will drain you day by day, gaining your power and when you are of no use anymore, you will be left to rot. And your brother and his lovely wife... they will die long before you. Swiftly, if they are
“I wrote and ran some tests. Nothing exciting. How did you spend your time on the mainland?”
“Wouldn’t it be weird for you to have one of your employees living with you?” Cas had offered him a job and now, a home. It was beginning to seem like Cas was one of those guys that people took advantage of. He was just way too nice. “It would seem kind of like I was mooching.”
“Yes,” Mildred responded, fussing around with the old coffeemaker. “Good God, this thing is an antique.”
“It’s not... Fuck, Cas, listen to me. To her.” He turned to Tina. “Tell my husband that we never slept together.”
“It’s romantic...” Charlie started, but Crowley held up five fingers and counted down.
“Just his pride, I would imagine,” Castiel said softly, unable to stop the smile.
Guests to the farm were encouraged, but they usually didn’t come so early. He was about to go greet the newcomer, but Gabriel beat him to it. Then the driver got out and Castiel’s frown deepened. Dean Winchester. The man took metrosexual to another level. Yesterday, he’d been dressed in stiff jeans, loafers, and a button-down dress shirt. He’d looked out of place on the farm. Curious, Castiel moved closer as the man spoke with his brother and opened the trunk of his car.
Today’s lunch was boxed macaroni and cheese, a small salad made with iceberg lettuce and grated carrots, and a half of an apple. Mildred promised to make bread that afternoon so they could add sandwiches to their meal plan.
“What were your duties?” Duties? It took a couple of seconds before Dean caught up with the conversation.
“And non-furry ones?” Dean asked, still frozen in place by the elaborate habitat he’d built their pets.
“Isn’t that his decision?” Castiel took a sip of the warm blood. It was good, but the smell of cooked meat and vegetables whiffed through the air and he found himself wanting more than his usual sustenance.
“I have a cooler in the back with drinks, sandwiches and a couple of apples.” Castiel was surprised. So surprised, he didn’t respond for a few seconds. “It’s not much and if you don’t like it, we can swing through a drive-thru.”
Castiel regarded the warden for a moment before replying coldly. “That is
“Hey, you ready to go?” Casual.
“I guess so,” he said, smiling. “Try going to a gay club in DC, there are plenty of bitches there.”
“Yeah, thanks, I might tag along.” He filled his water bottles from the large purification tank and tucked them inside his much smaller pack.
,” he muttered and started cleaning off the table. Cas changed alright. One day he’s telling Dean he loves him and the next he stops answering phone calls. No texts, no emails, nothing. Jack shit. Even when Mary up and dies, he’s told by some uppity dude that Cas is too busy to come to the phone. Fuck him.
“No... no allergies.
“Oh, that’s all. Well, we sat here on the porch until dark and the mosquitos started biting. Maybe... what... eight or so?” Mildred turned to Frank and he nodded. “Then...”
“Okay. I’ll pick, but you better not complain about the food,” Dean teased.
Offering her a grateful smile, he continued, “Next thing I knew, I had a manager and was signing a record deal. When the tours started, I wasn’t prepared physically or emotionally. The person who I was supposed to trust the most started giving me drugs to ‘help’ me get through.”
Knowing in his heart that one night would never be enough and this would probably cause his heart to shatter beyond repair, Castiel nodded once. “Okay.”
“Thank you for the ride…uhm…Ash.”
“Sure, Sammy,” he said, still taking in the view on his side of the vehicle. He reached over to turn on the radio, but all he saw was a screen. “What the fuck is this?”
The coven raised their heads and all spoke at once. “Help in Missouri’s journey into Summerland."
“No... no, that was very kind of you. Thank you.”
He held up his hand. “You best not tell her it’s too much, or else she’ll hurt you.”
“Well, ain’t that a fine mess,” Bobby snarled. “What are we going to do about it?”
. This day would be no different.
. Now, he was going to die in a sweltering compound outside of Caracas, a smear on his perfect record with the Agency.
After the Con, life hit me full force - unpacking, laundry, work, work, work, family visits, classes to teach, work.... UGH. But I'm hoping I'm back on track now.
“They use their camouflage to keep from being preyed upon.” Was there supposed to be some hidden meaning there? Dean watched the turtle until they turned a bend in the river.
“How are you going to explain this?” Castiel asked, his fingers gently brushing at the bandage on Dean’s temple.
Cas sauntered, there was no other word for it, to his backpack and Dean’s brain went completely offline when he dropped his towel to bend over to put on a pair of orange boxer briefs.
“Oh, now that you’ve peaked my interest, you want to back out. Are you always a pricktease?”
“Seriously? That’s awesome.”
After he spent the next morning making desserts for the dinner service, Castiel and Ruby set out for a day of shopping. Five hours and three rooms of furniture later, Claire was whiny and Castiel felt like joining her. The bed was to be delivered that afternoon, but the rest of the things would be arriving on Wednesday. He’d have two days to make the condo livable again before Dean flew in.
The next day, he woke up early, the woods exploded with bird noises as the sun came up. Cas dressed up quickly-
He turned once again and met those gorgeous eyes. Dean looked at him so intensely he swore he blushed like a teenage girl.
Dean pulled him into his chest and kissed his hair, "That's why you didn't pick up the phone? That's why you avoided me in the last few weeks?"
Moaning, Castiel shut his eyes as Dean smeared some lube on his fingers before his hand disappeared into the heat of Castiel's ass again.
call you Cas?" Dean asked amused. Castiel stood up and gave an equal shy smile to Ben's father,
"Sam is fine, he's at my apartment...
Dean chuckled, his heart warming. He hugged Ben back tightly, " I know buddy, it's nothing, just wedding stress."
Pushing their erections together, they groaned in unison and pulled away a bit so they could pull their swim trucks away. Castiel slid off his short turquoise shorts, his erection bobbing, he then glanced at Dean who took his time, pulling off his dark red trucks, his thick cock slapping onto his stomach.
their lips were inches apart.
Dean sighed, “Listen Cas, about all that—”
"Rowena agreed to go out with me!" he said and ordered a soda.
Both smaller wolfs growled and pounced right over the bigger one, these ones seemed not to care about the loud Alpha growl.
Dean smiled gorgeously and their lips met, "man, you have no idea how glad I am that you were around when they said
"Mmm, baby, you have no idea how I missed you..."
Cas' eyes widened and he blushed harder. Did Charlie told Dean about him crushing the jock super hard?
Dean grinned and Castiel blushed, was this really happening?
The thing was, they never felt awkward around each other.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel’s heart fluttered, Dean may be a 36-year-old man but sometimes he looks like a little boy with his cute pout and toothy grins.
Castiel felt Dean's intense eyes follow his every move and he could tell that the older lad was groaning softly as Castiel pushed himself back and took the jeans off completely.
Castiel suppressed a painful gulp.
the man was an event planner so it was probably easy for him, but he's still grateful, if it wasn't for him this place wouldn't even be a choice as they both couldn't even afford it.
Gabriel: 22
A few moments later, the blonde kid entered the library sheepishly. His blue eyes fell on Castiel, and he could swear the shade was identically with his own.
"I-I don't understand..."
"Oh, you
“W-What?”
As for him and Gabe, they did the grocery shopping and went for firewood, one time, his younger brother brought a squirrel and begged their father to keep him.
After pouring his tea into his mug, Cas wore his coat and got out to the porch, there stood a wooden chair with a small table along with it. The dark-haired man clutched his hot mug to his chest and breathed in the scent of bergamot, pine needles, and brisk winter air.
familiar like he saw them once before somewhere...
It had been over a week since he saw Dean, but they texted non-stop, Dean was the sweetest guy ever. He still couldn't believe Dean was so perfect, handsome and so, so lovely. It felt like a dream to having this date with him. Apparently, the green-eyed mechanic was bisexual and he couldn't stop complimenting Castiel at how sexy he is.
He still couldn’t believe he agreed to all this.
Placing his fingers on each hip, Cas pulled slowly the black briefs, until they're were on Dean's knees. The cock bobbed heavily in front of him nice and thick and Cas couldn't help but lick the wet cock head in front of his mouth.
Castiel sighed and got up, face falling when he saw Michael slipping into his jacket.
Dean let out a lungful of bitter smoke, his cigarette almost finished, the whiskey bottle half-finished too. His mind was blurry, the only thing he pictured was ocean blue eyes, dark hair, and a gorgeous velvety deep voice.
Castiel's mouth watered and he needed a taste.
When the other male let his wrists free, Castiel wrapped them around his neck and ran his fingers on the soft dark hair.
Ben smiled shyly and nodded a: "Hi, Mr. Claire's dad..."
The thing was, Dean’s Alpha already felt the heartbeat of the hunters getting nearer, if he didn’t hold the mutants for just a few more minutes, he and Gabe probably will be dinner.
Dean then rubbed his clothed cock on his own really slow, Castiel gasped as he felt himself twitching.
Castiel drops his head, looking at his lap like a child failing their parents. Well, what a coincidence he indeed failed his boyfriend.
A pile of soggy-looking fur.
They stayed silent for a moment before Dean sighed and hugged his face with his big palms.
“Damn, you look amazing, my skills are amazing actually!” Dean huffed a laugh as he got up from the stool and checked himself out, it wasn’t that bad.
who pushed him deeper into knowing him better.
"Can I have a dance?"
and his grip was just tight enough to make his head spin.
What the hell was he thinking? Dean could never agree. He was the captain! He was everything. Castiel was literally the gay kid who was bullied 2 years ago. A nothing,
The wolf closed his eyes melting on Castiel’s touch, nuzzling his muzzle on the palm of the man’s hand.
After what it seemed like forever, the larger, light-haired wolf dismissed the smaller one. It ran incredibly fast as it disappeared from the dark garage.
“Gonna get some booze” He announced, he dared to look at Cas once again and gulped when he saw that the blue-eyed man took off his jacket and wrapped it around his hips.
"Oh fuck," Cas said, pulling him closer, groaning as that made Dean shift deeper. His voice was breathless when he murmured, "
..." the smaller man moans hungrily as he pushes himself even more on the green-eyed man's finger.
The couple decided to take some time off, Castiel finally ending his worldwide tour and Dean finishing his filming for the next Supernatural saga movie. They
"So, you must be Claire's dad, I'm Dean, Ben's dad..." Dean smiled, and wow, his voice was deep and hoarse and so, so sexy. Castiel smiled back when Dean offered a hand. His grip was firm and his hand rough but warm and big.
“Hey, hey I know I’m a dumb sonuvabitch.” Dean grabbed his hands into his warm ones.
. It was a couple of months ago, when he and Mick, his best friend, took a walk to
"Don't worry Claire, you'll meet with Ben really soon, probably tomorrow" Dean reassured his girl and Castiel nodded.
Some sitting on the big map desk, searching for something, books spread out everywhere, the blue-eyed man recognized Bobby, oh, and the lady—
Castiel felt satisfied hearing that from Dean.
A few moments passed as they both panted breathlessly to each other's mouths before Dean rolled them into the mattress, Castiel winced a bit when the hot softening cock left his puffy rim.
Cas shouted, and stepped forward to attack Dean, trying to aim a punch.
Castiel had fallen
"Stand." he ordered.
Cas wrapped a towel around the base of the bloody wound, pressed down hard, then tugged. The bullet didn't want to come out, and he had to pull harder, twisting a little. He felt it rip through skin and muscle and the wolf started to struggle as he cried out.
“I feel like we need to talk about all this…” he chuckled breathlessly when Cas lowered a hand into his hard crotch bulge.
"He had too many antidepressants and some other shit to keep him up to perform! It's your fucking fault asshole! How could you text him about a divorce seconds before his grand opening!"
The blue-eyed man stands up with shaky hands as he shouts at the quiet hall, his voice strangely steady.
Dean gave him a long look before Jo came back with the most amazing-looking burgers he ever seen, accompanied with big french fries. They both smiled then.
Castiel didn’t want to admit it, but he watched the green-eyed lad over the years, from year 1 when Dean was the best to handle a broomstick to year 7 being Captain and having everyone adore him.
Growling he got up with weak knees and pushed himself forward to attack the Pharaoh. The king just grinned like a cat. Making his hands fists, he growled once again like an animal and threw himself to the young Emperor. As gorgeous and erotic he was, he messed with the wrong Barbarian.
"Are you out of your damn mind?" His husband almost yelled, his furious expression made Castiel wince and trail his eyes towards his lap, where their hands were still intertwined.
or forever hold your
Cas' and Dean's first date goes quite well...
Dean is made for Cas, he needs him so much, he’s so thirsty for his blue-eyed angel, with his dorky sweaters and that fluffy raven hair that is always messy.
Castiel’s face fell when he winced from the pain, and Dean’s heart melted, Cas still cared, his emotions were intense, Dean could feel the aura the blue-eyed man radiated.
“Absolutely!” the accountant grinned.
, he’s about to kill some bad motherfuckers.
, where are you?" he called, his voice breaking.
Charlie, looked at him stunned but she was nodding her head, standing with him, already processing what they would do.
, he couldn't believe how fate actually worked, the way they met each other was so random yet so destinated. Dean made Cas forget every little dark thought he ever had. The thing was, how this all will work?
After 10 minutes, he was in a conversation with Balth, Jo, and Benny, they laughed as Cas was telling them how mad Zachariah was when he ate the last piece of cake leftovers at the office he worked.
The bar-restaurant was as nice as he expected. Castiel stopped just inside the door and looked around at the nice, cozy western-like decor.
Satisfied Cas took courage to feed the wild animal too. Careful not to sneak up and scare him, the blue-eyed man took some meat in his hand and slowly brought it to the animal's nose. The wolf sniffed the treat and opened his mouth, Cas took it as a cue to feed him.
“It actually was kinda…
“Dean…” Castiel whispers as his eyes run all over the naked body.
"Ah, Cas!" Dean begged, his hands trying to move, but the spell holding them behind his head. Castiel didn’t back off, he pushed and pushed, grinding down so Dean pressed as deep as he could, then pulling back until the head of Dean's cock caught on his rim.
Anyway, who is he to judge? She can do whatever she wants.
The music and all the dancing sweaty bodies in the frat house fade and Castiel’s only sensation is Dean’s lips sucking his neck. And father forgive him, he wants marks for everyone to know that he belongs to Dean, that he left his girlfriend for him.
Dean just ignored, his eyes and mind were elsewhere. A pang of jealousy shivered in all his body as he watched with a tight jaw Cas and Balthazar giggling together and generally being very close.
Castiel tries to hold his new tears that are threatening his eyes to roll,
Brushing his teeth after and grabbing a new clean boxer briefs he stumbles on the bed, setting the alarm on 7 a.m. dreadfully.
“I love you, like love you
Gulping, Dean smiled as he looked at his gorgeous another half, he then started:
"Cas, I'm so sorry..." he whispered, his eyes sparkling.
The green-eyed werewolf smiled so wide, Castiel rolled his eyes and pushed Dean’s face to his lips. They both groaned with pleasure, their hands all over each other.
“Sammy,
Dean reveals the truth to Cas, emotional moments follow.
They didn't drove long before they were outside a bar-restaurant called 'Roadhouse' Dean turned to him and grinned even though Castiel could see there was nervousness in his eyes. He smiled trying to reassure Dean anything with him will be amazing.
Everyone knows that silver is a weapon against werewolves. Or whatever the fuck these things were.
“Yes, I’m fucking in love with Cas alright!” Dean admitted growling harshly, the words painful.
And then it hit, everything that happened that night, his almost overdose, and then
There wasn't long before a blonde young woman came with two menus and two beers.
Which was very likely a lot of years ago, he heard rumors that Dean was one of the oldest ones.
They lay in an awkward silence panting before Dean speaks.
After Cas found the hallway clear he ran to his locker, pushing his dark hair from his eyes, the blue-eyed boy quickly unlocked it and grabbed his needed books.
"I hate you..."
This son of a bitch is lucky Dean didn’t punch him.
“Benny!” he said smiling recognizing Dean’s best friend.
He had fallen for Cas in their 11
Balthazar from Drama club flirted with him and Inias found him cute and funny.
"Who was that? Your boyfriend?" Dean pushed his face inside the crook of Cas' neck, the blue-eyed man almost moaned when he felt Dean's tongue trailing on his soft skin. He closed his eyes and breathed in Dean's scent as the green-eyed man traced up his neck with nips and bites.
Whoever did this should rot in hell, however, it was odd, if a hunter shot it, they should've probably taken the dying prey.
Cas groaned when his eyes open,
“So,” Dean pecks Castiel’s nose, “are we,” another peck on his eye, “good?” the last was on his lips.
Both kids giggled and Castiel smiled softly.
Dean's breath quickened, and he started changing the pace of his thrusting, the slow steady movements were now quick and hard, his hand still rough stroking his cock.
, more like a paralyzed man. Everything internally was active but he couldn't even stir his little finger.
. In contrast to a normal club,  Vampire clubs were wild and were like you entered an orgy meeting,
." Cas groaned nuzzling Dean's thick beard, it was soft and the best feeling he ever felt, Cas could come for thinking about Dean's face between his asscheeks.
Something like hurt and more anger flushed into Cas’ eyes.
"That was," Dean breathed, "
, he wanted sandwiches, Dean was the king of Sandwiches, his boy loved them.
"Dean is
Castiel found the music classroom, which was empty and locked himself in. Today he was supposed to be confident and relaxed. He wore his favorite outfit and fixed his hair, all for Dean! Charlie and Gabe said he looked good. (Obviously they've said it!
No one deserves to be hunted. Especially innocent animals. Wolves might be feral but they won't hurt you if you don't hurt them. He stepped back and the wolf wheezed again, finishing with a pained little pant
It wasn't long before both, he and Dean came, the Barbarian exploded into his heat, filling him with hot seed. One moment later his own cock flooding come onto Dean's chest and chin.
"I married young, my parent's request, they were very church people, made me go every Sunday and named me after an angel," he chuckled sadly, he felt Dean's eyes glued on him.  "I always knew I was gay, but I could never come out, not with the family I had. They would disown me..."
There was blood on the corner of the window, red splashes inking the glass.
The night they slept together, Dean didn't believe he would have that again, it was hard to compare or find someone better than Cas.
Before he could knock once again, the door opened a tired-looking Sam, his eyes had dark circles and his face was pale, floppy hair falling into his eyes.
Castiel worked his way down Dean's length, sliding back to let his spit ease his path, then pushing forward another inch. The green-eyed's cock pushed his lips wide, and he had to take a breath and urge his jaw to relax to allow him to take more of Dean in. When his cock hit the back of his throat, he swallowed hard.
Castiel almost whines as the warm heat of Dean leaves his naked body, he walks towards the cellphone which is placed on the Alpha’s desk.
" Dean kissed Cas hard and so passionately.
. Anyways, Cas always was shy, but now he was confident enough to ask Dean out. The green-eyed jock always smiled at him and waved at him almost every time he saw Cas. That's a sign. Right? Right? If Dean says no, or laughs and humiliates Castiel, he isn't sure he'll ever ask anyone ever again.
Cas was looking
But the doubts on the back of his head made him think it twice about asking Cas out for a dinner, the man could be straight or still hadn't get over his wife, maybe Cas will feel awkward and never come back to the park, and Ben will lose Claire and his boy will be sad.
Dean smiled wider, his pink lips looking delicious, he also had unbuttoned a button from his shirt, his toned collar bones showing.
“You idiot, throwing yourself to the wolfs,” Dean growled, starting to check him if he was injured, Castiel smiled kissing his Alpha’s cheek lovingly, melting into his embrace.
"Cas babe, what's wrong? stay with me!" It was kinda funny, and if he didn't feel like was about to pass out, Castiel would have laughed super hard. It was unbelievable!
Castiel grabs his face and kisses him shutting him up.
They went downstairs, into a dark booth, Castiel guessed this is the so-called ground basement, but it was no basement or a garage, it was like a secret exit hallway with doors hell knows who lead.
So, he left a heartbroken Dean, who begged Castiel to stay to find a way…
“Dean…”
They layed like this for a while, Dean on top of him, breathing hard, his cock still inside of him. Castiel closed his eyes, praying Dean would stay tonight with him. He knew Dean didn’t cuddle but his warm solid weight in his bed could just make him happy as well.
“Good.”
The lawyer ignores him as the blonde man seems not to realize the tension between them. He smiles dumbly and accepts Dean's hand.
“Dean—Mmm…”
“You still love me?” Cas’ voice was deep and small.
"Okay, daddy!" Ben gave him a toothy smile, his first two tooths were still missing and he looked freaking adorable, Dean's heart melted.
Castiel blurted so fastly Dean looked at him puzzled and confused. The blue-eyed teen blushed harder, the jock probably thought he's insane.
And then the cute young girl, with the blonde hair—the waitress—Ellen’s daughter, that always glared at him for no reason, every
"Be careful and stay close." he warmed.
Today is sunny as yesterday was and the park is packed even more. Dean gets out of the driver's seat and goes to get Ben out of the toddler seat, when both Winchester's are walking towards their usual spot, the green-eyed man locates Cas fixing Claire's hair into a ponytail, their golden retriever sitting patiently next to them.
“Ah, s-shit, Dean I-I’m c-close,” Castiel’s cock was licking between their stomachs, he still couldn’t believe Dean could make him come untouched.
“Everyone’s probably wondering where you are…” Castiel whispered as he realized both of them were all night in Dean’s bedroom. The blue-eyed man didn’t even have the chance to meet the other members of his Alpha’s pack except Bobby, well and Sam but he doesn’t count. He didn’t even have the chance to check the bunker they were in, they hurried immediately into Dean’s room. Bobby giving him some painkillers and an antidote injection. It is big and underground, that’s for sure.
Dean shared a glance with Ellen, she was surprisingly quiet. Alright, yeah, this
He hadn’t lost his faith, Castiel still believed it was faith that brought him Dean back, that made him be an important person in this world, Castiel finally didn’t find himself boring or his life. He didn’t feel lonely anymore, everything he needed was right here.
When he wore them, he grabbed his jeans, which were hanging on top of his desk’s chair.
"It's okay dude relax, Ben and Claire, seem to become good friends...I haven't seen you guys before though, first time here?"
After starting the engine, he passed the dark underground road, he was almost at the exit, but he couldn’t see Tomas sitting in the booth, checking who exits and who enters the garage.
Castiel flinched when she on purpose pushed her way out of the apartment.
Once again, he takes a deep breath and tells himself not to panic.
"No, no, don't blame yourself, I myself probably would react worse..."
"Thanks, Cas...for everything..." the giant 17-year old teen gave him a bear hug. Castiel squished him and pulled away, pushing Sam out.
She might be horrible but it was a bit sad.
"I-I'm sorry...I'll jut-" He was about to turn around and disappear from human sight and cry himself asleep with his body having 70% alcohol in it.
He was 34 for God's sake, he didn't blush.
Castiel’s heart was beating incredibly fast when Dean got out of the bathroom. His
normal drinks too.
..." It was the only thing he said, and Dean held his hand tighter.
Dean opened his mouth and closed his eyes, thrusting shallowly he came. Castiel wrapped his legs around his back and held him close, one hand finding the back of his neck and the other cupping his jaw. He nuzzled inside his sweaty neck, warm satisfaction flushing through his veins.
Benny, Charlie, Jo, Ash, and Garth were standing from their chairs and whistling and shouting
He knew Dean wanted him, needed him.
“Fuck me, please…I need you so much…” Castiel pleaded.
Dean gulped, his muscles still, he still couldn't move yet he felt his body adoring the closeness of Castiel.
you know what I mean…” Sam smiled.
he could actually cry.
"I'll go out with you if you let me kiss you," Dean said and leaned closer.
he missed Dean's cock.
. Leave the boy alone or I swear to God, I kill every single one of you.” The growl made Castiel wince, his heart almost ripped out of his chest.
" Cas couldn't help himself but blurt out the last sentence, maybe this was the man that shot the wild animal and left it there to die...
this is probably just a coincidence. Even if it feels like a freaking
Dean, wasn't he supposed to be somewhere else? Why was he here? It pained him so much to see his husband like this though.
Dean glares at him and kisses his palms gently. “Bullshit.”
"What the fuck does that mean?" he growled.
Castiel smiled at him adoringly, the timing was a mess but at least they were together, and he also was really, really hungry.
"Don't forget your meeting with Adler..." Castiel gave him a small smile before closing the door.
"Let's go deeper," he whispered pushing them inside the cool water.
“Come here, little guy!” The bigger man chuckled.
“You gonna need something to attack.” Sam gave him a small smile.
Cas jerks Dean’s grip from his arm and stomps away, running downstairs.
Dean…
Dean frowned, "You don't have to--"
Not like Cas though.
"Let me..."
those biceps. Castiel finally has time to appreciate Dean’s naked body, now that they’re not in freaking danger, or the Alpha’s about to pass out.
Dean nudged Cas away from the metal crib and they exited the tent, leaving the baby in the care of one of their nurses. Cas glanced at the activity around them. A new shipment of medical supplies had arrived that morning. He knew vaccines for the Colombian children would be in one of the crates.
“Mr. Novak, nice to finally see you around. I made for you a blackened drum, on a bed of haricot verts and brandied carrots, served with a three-herb butter.”
“You were a Boy Scout?”
I haven't had the time to write much because work has been so busy, but here it is, better late than never, huh?  Hope you enjoy.
“Just another thirty minutes or so and we’ll be at the hotel.”
Cas nodded while he fastened his seat belt. “It wasn’t as easy as that. I hired an attorney and he got me out of the contract. It cost me a bundle, but it was worth it. My label stood by me thankfully, and helped me find Gabe... Gabriel. He’s been my savior.” It was true. His new manager saw him through his rehab stay. Besides leaving Dean, it was the hardest thing he’s ever done.
“It’s beautiful, baby girl.” He wasn’t looking at the butterfly. He was gazing adoringly at Audrey. She’d called him ‘daddy’. She hadn’t called him that in... well, since her mother died.
“A baby doll,” Jody piped up. All eyes turned to her quizzically. “The outfit she was wearing, it’s called a baby doll.”
“And no one can back up your story?” Castiel was good at reading people. And his intuition told him that Winchester wasn’t placing him on the suspect list.
Castiel nodded and took another drink. They ate quietly and then Madame Tran reached for the pitcher of water at the same time Castiel did. At the touch of his skin, her eyes flew to his. “Come, Castiel, walk me to my chambers.” If the djinn noted her odd behavior, he didn’t mention it as he bade them goodnight.
“So, just like that, you plan on pulling in another civilian? You should have cleared it with me first, Cas. I’m not risking some girl’s life because she was a teacher’s pet.”
“I could let this one go, with the specialty framing for three hundred.” The price tag was well over that, but he could lose his profit margin for a handsome man. An overly dramatic sigh came from the back room and he wanted Rowena to disappear.
The next day, he let Gabriel read the contract before contacting one of Ruby’s friends, an attorney over on Peachtree. His brother thought it was a good thing and the lawyer gave it his seal of approval. All he had to do was find out if Dean was behind it or not. He knew Dean was finished with the taping, so he chanced a call.
“Guess we’re heading in.”
An hour later, Chuck realized that he married a shark and there was blood in the water. Luke stood by the window watching the sun set, a glass of red wine in his hand. Becky was pacing the room. “We can use social media,” she said.
Fuck, was he trying to be a dick? Dean grunted in response. So much for starting over.
He tilted his head in thought. Had he? Not since he’d drank from Dean. “It hasn’t been that long,” he said honestly. “It hasn’t been a constant with me in a long, long time.”
“I want to live aboard one of the rigs for a few weeks, maybe longer, to do some studies and a few dives.”
“Thanks,” Dean said, smiling and picking at his meal. The pork tenderloin was served with a thick apricot sauce and he’d served it with wild rice and roasted cauliflower. “So, uh, Sam says you’re a reporter for the Herald.”
“That bread is unacceptable. It has no nutritional value and is filled with chemicals to add shelf life.”
“I...yes...” Castiel looked to his son for assistance, but Jack was nodding toward... Dean.
“She is.” Cas carefully rolled over and Dean caught his hand, holding him still.
“She’ll get over it,” Cas said. Dean shook his head in denial. When had Cas snuck up on him. He was a cop, he should be more aware of his surroundings.
Castiel peered around and saw Dean was drinking a Coke. “That’s right, Claire. Dean has juice.”
“Easy...” Dean immediately slowed his movements. Cas opened the box one-handedly and tore off one of the condoms with his teeth. He held it out to Dean. His fingers never stopped moving inside of Dean, pressing and rubbing to give him pleasure. With fumbling fingers, Dean ripped the foil packet open and pulled it out. He took Cas’ cock in his hand and stroked it until Cas growled for him to hurry. He rolled the latex down and then slicked it with lube. Past caring about anything, he wiped his hand on the sheets and lift his hips. Cas eased his fingers from Dean’s body and gripped the base of his cock.
“Huh?” She stared at Dean in confusion. Did she have a brain cell in that head of hers?
My own blood must be let and as my soul leaves this world, the spell will be done.
“As long as he doesn’t start anything, I’ll be fine.”
The water shut off and he bolted upright. He didn’t even have condoms or lube. It was a moot point then. Right? The door opened and Cas came out in a towel. Just a fucking towel. If there was a God, he hated Dean Winchester.
Dean opened his mouth and closed it again.
“Welcome aboard.” She gestured him to follow her to a gangway. “I’ll show you to your quarters first and then give you the nickel tour. You’re on nights. Six p.m. to six in the morning. Guess they told you that you’ll plan all four meals, but only be in charge of three. Benny or Cesar will take your plan for the fourth and run with it. They are fabulous. You will love them.”
“I don’t know. I liked the ribs. They were undercooked but the sauce was pretty darn good,” Benny piped in after taking a bit of the sauce on his finger and tasting again.
hit the top of the charts and earned them both a CMA award for songwriting. He’d won Single of the Year and Best Male Vocalist.
“Castiel?”
“I’m Meg and part
“Fine,” Dean said, laughing. “Anything you want. See you at six. I’ll send Ash.”
“Okay. Okay, I think I’ve got it. Now, for the menu.”
The last to arrive, Dean joined the group in the lobby. Benny winked at him and Inias gave him a dirty look. Did they know? Surely to God, Cas didn’t tell them they shared blowjobs over coffee? He avoided eye contact with Cas until after they’d finished breakfast at this small restaurant across the street. His eyes widened at the hickey on Cas’ throat, right by his Adam’s apple. No wonder he’d gotten the looks. His gaze went to Audrey’s and his daughter seemed oblivious. He was in the clear with the teens anyway.
“Dean, I...” What could he say? Dean was right. His life wasn’t here anymore.
“He rubs me the wrong way,” Castiel said shortly. “How are the girls?”
“No.”
“What? What do you mean no?”
“No,” Dean screamed, reaching for her instinctively, already knowing it was too late. Blood gushed out of her mouth and her eyes.
On the sidewalk, Dean balked. “Jesus Fucking Christ, Sam. Nine hundred dollars...
He looked up. Dean held an unopened toothbrush. “I have two sinks.”
“She started a spell, but I... I was angry. Madder than I’d ever been because she told me the fire wasn’t an accident. I wasn’t consciously...” Dean let the sentence die.
Happy Valentines Day, everyone. Married, single, or involved, I hope it is a good day.
When it was finally over and the crowd left the studio, Crowley appeared on the set and crossed his arms, a sneer affixed to his face. “Winchester, did someone shit in your Wheaties this morning? Did you go out last night and party too hard?”
“I’m prepared to offer you the position as a guest host. Just once or twice a month when one of the regular hosts is out. Obviously, you wouldn’t be making as much as the three main stars, but the network is prepared to give you thirty thousand for each episode.” Castiel stared in stunned silence at the sheets of puff pastry on his work station. Thirty thousand? A guest host? “Of course, we would pick up any expenses, air fare, hotels, blah, blah, blah, you get my drift, I’m sure.”
“Cool. Where are they?” The boy took it upon himself to go deeper into Castiel’s home. Castiel followed.
Cas watched Dean jog up the stairs to their bedroom. Dean was on call tonight. This was their life now. Juggling two stressful careers in medicine, a baby, and unpacking boxes in their new home.
Then Novak leaned over the console and turned his laptop. He caught a whiff of the guy’s aftershave. Woodsy. Citrusy. Sexy. Dean barely comprehended what Novak was showing him. Something about bees and sightings.
“You’re late,” Dean chided.
For those of you that called me and sent me private messages, thank you. It means a lot to have friends who worry about me. I'm doing better. Life goes on. I've got another story in the works, plus the FicFacers.com auction coming up for Random Acts, plus DCBB. UGH....
“Sweet?”
“I haven’t been a boy in a long time, Sweetheart,” he said smoothly. Since his hands were covered in frosting, he didn’t offer to shake.  “The name’s Dean.”
The clerk looked at him for a few seconds and then slowly shock his head. “No, Sir. Would you like me to ring Mr. Novak’s room?”
. N. O. Negative. Negatory. Nope,” he popped the ‘p’. “What we do is dangerous, Sam.”
“I was scared, Dean,” Castiel whispered. “So scared.”
“And your point?” Dean wasn’t letting her go off to the rain forests of Brazil without a chaperone he could trust. A chaperone named Dean Winchester.
’ Score. His gaydar never failed him...okay, there was that one time...
“He liked it,” Dean said shortly. He didn’t want to talk about Cas right now. Cas was persona non grata at this point in time.
“Coming.” She skidded to a stop in the kitchen, her backpack slung over one shoulder. Dean took a moment to look at her. She had his features, the eyes, the freckles, but she was growing into a beautiful young woman. He wanted to grab her and lock her away from the rest of the world. She plopped down on the bar stool and picked up the glass of orange juice he’d poured her.
Several framed photographs set on one of the shelves. He recognized Sam in quite a few. An older black and white picture depicted a young couple with a toddler and an infant.  Dean’s parents? He looked closer. Yes, that was John Winchester. Dean had told him in passing that his mother was deceased and John had remarried. Moving on, he found a casual wedding picture of Dean’s father and a dark blonde woman. She was smiling adoringly at the elder Winchester. Castiel licked his lips and set the picture down. He would love to find a person to share his life with one day. Someone that would look at him like that.
It took a few seconds for Dean to realize what he was talking about. “Me. The restaurant will remain open and I have complete trust in my crew to handle the dinner service.
“Hell, yeah, they can
“He is a snake. A ruthless rapist. A blackmailer. A... a bad person.”
Castiel touched Ruby’s shoulder and then pulled her into a hug. He spoke into her hair. “Thank you for everything you do. For being there for me... and for Claire. We are going to be fine.”
Sam was leaning against a full-size SUV. He straightened as Dean crossed the grass, ignoring the sidewalk. His brother was grinning. "Dean, I can’t believe this day has finally come." Sam had always believed him, even when their own father had pointed to him in the courtroom and said that Dean killed Kate Milligan. Sam was the one who never missed a visit on Sundays, even when he was in medical school. John visited once. It was only to belittle him and ask if he had left any money in the house.
Castiel raised his chin and stared at the two grown men. The years had made them into beautiful men, tall and strong. Mary and John would have been proud.
“Anyone would be lucky to have you, Dean. You were innocent.” He felt Sam move closer.
After his brothers left for their homes, Max made his way to his quarters above the barn, and Jack went upstairs to finish his homework, Castiel handed Dean the remote to the television. “You can watch whatever you want.” He moved to leave the room, but Dean stopped him.
“Okay... Cas, remember... closure. Or not.” He slid his thumb across the screen, ending the call.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Dean, if you still want to…”
Sam ambled into the kitchen, hair standing on end. He reached for the coffee pot before muttering good morning. Dean smirked and flipped another pancake. “Don’t you ever sleep in?”
His daughter was on the floor of Gabriel's massive living room, surrounded by enough toys to stock a department store. He only recognized a few of them as hers. He swung the giggling child up into his arms. "Da-da," she chortled.
The producer stood and called out, “That’s a wrap.”
“As I’ll ever get,” Dean answered and squared his shoulders.
“I’m not sure.” Was he still dreaming? His cock was throbbing and he could feel Dean touching him. Was he putting on a condom? Yes. Castiel could feel the latex being rolled down his shaft. “Dean, what are you…”
“No, the mistake was thinking you wanted the same things I did. I’ve got to go.” Dean slid his thumb over the screen to end the call. Michael would go down as
Dean arched his back and shoved back onto Cas’ fingers. “More.” He did need to stop analyzing everything. Cas had to
“I caught the diving bug when my parents took us to Key West for vacation. A local dive shop advertised that you could be certified as a diver in just one day's time. I pleaded with my parents, and they let me. Michael and Luke signed up too. I fell in love with that feeling of entering a whole new world. Once we got home, Dad made sure I got an extensive course.”
Claire, wrapped in a pink quilt patterned with the characters from the movie Frozen, smiled when she saw him. “Daddy.” She crawled off the couch and ran toward him, the tears from earlier forgotten. He reached down and scooped her up.
. What in God’s name was that? It sounded vile.
The rest of the afternoon wasn’t nearly as dramatic. Novak seemed to include him more and while the snide comments had ceased, the truce wasn’t an easy one. It wasn’t until Dean was turning the boat to head back in that Novak got testy again. “Where are you going? We still have all that shoreline over there,” he said, pointing to the northern side of the lake.
“I’m not stupid. I didn’t get this far in my career by shitting where I eat,” Crowley responded tensely. The Novak Oil policy manual did not forbid relationships between their employees, but there was potential for problems if it didn’t end well.
The door to Dean’s room opened and he peered out, hair ruffled and a crease from the pillow on one cheek. He looked at Cas questioningly.
The funeral wasn’t long, but Dean found himself captivated by the ritual. Had his own parents been given this sendoff? He wouldn’t have known. After Cas had whisked them away to Bobby’s place, he’d been afraid to ask questions. As the years passed, he’d pushed his childhood memories further and further into a neatly packed box. The tape on that box was dry and torn now. He had questions.
“You aren’t canceling your flight, are you?”
In lieu of answering, Novak shrugged and took out a tape measure. Dean eyed the gator with trepidation. He’d heard about alligator attacks, but thankfully, he’d never seen one in person. Now was not the time he wanted to make the news. With the grace of a gymnast, Novak jumped off, scooped up his bag, and grinned at Dean, like it was all a big joke to him.
“Don’t move,” he commanded and hastily walked toward the front. His hands were shaking. It was crazy. She couldn’t be a witch. It... wasn’t real.
He stopped talking when Dean ran his hand over his flaccid cock. “We could catch a nap and then…”  Dean let his sentence go unfinished. Castiel’s hands trembled as he pushed the boxers back down his legs. This was a mistake. Then again, if he went back to his hotel either Dean would have to dress and take him or he’d have to call a cab. It would be
“Jack can train you on the register and you might be called upon to work up front with the customers.”
“Oh, no, I... excuse me... I’m Claire’s father. Claire Novak... I’m Castiel. Castiel Novak.” Good God, the man probably thought he was a complete moron.
He’d been bold enough to tell Dean how he felt last night, and though Dean didn’t say the words, Cas could see it in his eyes. Dean loved him. Of that, he was sure.
Novak opened his mouth like he wanted to speak, but snapped it shut quickly. “Very well.”
“Samuel, would he be willing to leave his current position? We would pay him accordingly,” Luke Novak, Chuck’s oldest son and second in command, asked.
“What? The tagging?”
“So, when is he supposed to get here?”
“Why?”
“Okay. Spill,” Gabriel said in a normal tone, arms crossed over his chest.
“Where? What time will she be home?” He crossed his arms over his chest and tried to look imposing.
“I’m not going away.”
She strutted toward him, her heels making a tap-tapping sound on the asphalt. He instinctively moved behind the open door. “You don’t look powerful,” she said, her voice husky.
Well, this put him in an awkward situation. He sat on the sofa provided for guests, then stood and paced the room. He looked at the television mounted on the wall and at the remote control on the table in front of him and clicked it on. It was a live feed from the studio. He watched Benny pouring leftover chili into a casserole dish lined with corn tortillas. Dean was standing beside him smiling into the lens of the camera.
One shove had him falling onto the bed, and Cas was on him, kissing and biting. Pleasure and pain fought for dominance in Dean’s idled brain. He wanted more. He pushed at the waistband of his underwear, needing to feel the heat of Cas’ skin against him. Muscular legs pushed Dean’s thighs apart and his hand was cupping Dean’s balls. Pressure... just enough. “God... fuck... need you...”
Before he could second guess himself, he strode out to the dining room. Castiel looked around and didn't see the chef. Their hostess, Ute, and two of the wait staff were looking out of the front window. He saw Dean standing out on the sidewalk, cell phone pressed to his ear.
He put Claire on the living room floor with her toys. Instead of playing with them like she usually did, she chose to toddle toward Dean who stood next to the breakfast bar. She grabbed the leg of his jeans, holding tight with her chubby fist. The chef smiled down at her, something Castiel didn't expect.
He came back, his hands carrying a first aid kit and a damp cloth. Curious, Dean reached up to touch his face. His fingers came away red. “Fuck... shit... sorry.”
Dean stared at him indignantly, and then saw the slight smirk on the man’s face. “Whoa, was that a joke, Cas?”
He moved up the bank and hauled himself out of the muck with the use of a sapling. The reeds and marsh grass made it easy to follow the trail.
It only took Cas about ten minutes to get ready, but after a stop for coffee and a breakfast biscuit, they were running behind, so once again, Dean used his siren and lights to get through the heavy Houston traffic. It was dodgy pulling a boat, but people moved out of their way.
“Whose hand,” Sam asked.
Castiel smiled and settled on the old Victorian sofa. The house smelled like Mildred. Lavender and home.
Dean made the short trek to stand at the bottom steps. “You and Mildred recover from your exciting morning?”
“It means they like imagining us having sex,” Castiel said dryly. Charlie had shown him a website where he could read fictional stories about him and Dean. It was strange. Dean rolled his eyes.
As they swept into the dining room, Castiel at Madame Tran’s left, Nazari on her right, his eyes scanned the vast room. Dean sat with the Amazon. Castiel cocked his head to the side, wanting Dean to look up at him, but Dean’s gaze remained stubbornly on his plate. Damn the obstinate witch.
“Ah, Milton. I was asked if I was related,” Castiel replied, shortening his stride to their pace.
“I can’t stand the man,” Castiel muttered to his brother as the two of them hooked up their small dairy herd to the milking machine. He patted Joan Jett’s hindquarters and moved to the next cow. It was early, just after six and the sun was barely cresting the horizon.
Missouri addressed Tran. “Madam Tran, if this is true, they must be protected at all costs. I would like to offer them the sanctuary of my coven.”
“Let’s face it, Winchester has us spoiled.” Crowley frowned and put his elbows on the table. “Damned handsome bloke. These next two weeks are going to be miserable.” Castiel nodded. It was for the best though. Out of sight, out of mind. Wasn’t that how the saying went? It wasn’t working for Castiel. The image of Dean dropping to his knees played on a constant loop in his mind.
“Dean. Call me Dean,” he said. She smiled and held up her fist for a bump. He returned it, noting how small her hand was.
Dean was buckling his shoulder holster when Cas headed back downstairs. He put his cup in the dishwasher and set Dean’s travel mug on the counter. He seasoned the roast and dropped it into the crockpot and then wiped down the counters. He was waiting by the door, car keys in hand, when Dean came down the stairs. “Have a good day, babe. I’ll call you later.”
“No, Daddy. Her dad is taking us to the fair tomorrow. Don’t ruin this for me,” she whined with all the drama a ten-year-old could muster.
The Gamayun’s representative, seated to Castiel’s left, nodded her head regally, her black feathers gleaming under the crystal chandeliers hanging above.
Three sets of eyes were looking at Dean and Castiel suddenly felt sorry for him. He was out of his element. Unwilling to embarrass him, Castiel settled the boa back into her glass enclosure. “It’s okay, Dean. We all have different levels of comfort. I cannot touch spiders. Even the smaller specimens terrify me.” It was true. Other than his initial walkthrough during his orientation, he never set foot in Discovery House where the arachnids and insects lived.
He wasn’t going to sleep, so he got out of bed and walked the three feet that got him into the kitchen area. The papers were on the banquet table. He unfolded them and read the first like.
Jack’s decision, but Castiel had been pushing for the LCI ever since Jack told him he wanted to become a chef.
In the hallway, Dean pressed Castiel against the wall. “I did miss you, Cas.”
“So, you won the contest with your burger. Can you walk me through it?” Dean, being the television professional that he was, kept a straight face.
beg for Cas’ cock.
"I feel like I should tell you up front that I am not going to...sleep with you. Claire is the most important person in my life and I can't,
“Not quite,” Castiel said, hefting one of the gallon bags into his arms. “We need to move closer and begin pouring small portions of the blood into the water near the edge of the pond. Essentially leaving a trail to the cow. Once she is visible, we will start moving away from the bait, dragging it behind us until we are clear of any buildings.” He pointed to a large open area. “There.”
He reached up and without looking, locked the remaining cuff around Cas’ right wrist. He grinned. “Now, you’re going down with me, Officer.” Only Cas wasn’t smiling back. “What?”
“I got all night, Babe.” Dean’s slick hands began to rub circles on Cas’ thighs. Cas’ body had him in a vice-like grip. He caught the brief nod and he slid in another inch or two, his hands never stopping the soft massage of Cas’ legs. When Cas rolled his hips forward, Dean matched it with movement of his own, sinking deeper into Cas’ heat.
“I’d love to take her up on her offer,” muttered Benny.
Not seeing another option, Castiel took the note. He opened his mouth to tell the producer there was nothing between him and Dean, but the guy was out the door before he could get a word out. He opened the paper and read Dean’s words.
“Nope,” Castiel popped the ‘p’. He straightened when Dean started walking toward him.
“His daddy won’t buy him a girlfriend because we do not want to have babies. Not furry ones anyway.” Dean froze and turned around. The talk of children had come up several times over the last couple of years, but Cas had held out. He worried about their careers getting in the way, but with the firm doing so well, he could afford to cut back his hours, especially since they’d hired two more young architects over the summer.
“Jannie,” she whimpered.
He dumped his bag into his dressing room, picked up another cup of coffee from the cafeteria and made his way to hair and makeup. Charlie was already there. She raised an eyebrow. “You look like you’ve been rode hard and put up wet.” At his glare, she grinned. “Oh…so you have been rode hard…”
All in all, the chamber held two hundred seats, set up like Parliament’s own House of Commons. Elders from all nations sat waiting for any news that would affect them or their brethren. Tran looked down at her notes. “A werewolf in Romania has mated with a Gamayun. The offspring and parents were put to death. We, as the reigning Council, must keep the lines pure, so says the law. Crossbreeding will not be tolerated.” She looked up and met the eyes of the Alpha werewolf. “Report.”
He blinked back the moisture gathering at the corners of his eyes. “Goodbye,” he said to himself and let his hand fall to his side.
“Wow... okay then.” Gabe leaned back in his chair and Dean realized he’d spoken out loud.
The chef entered the dressing room which was approximately the size of the living room in his apartment in Atlanta. Castiel stood in the doorway, not daring to enter the man’s private sanctum. Dean went to the dressing table and picked up a few items, tossing them in a gym bag. He pulled the polo shirt he was wearing over his head and Castiel gawked. The man was truly a work of art.  Castiel turned away, suddenly fascinated with the Daytime Emmy statue on the bookcase next to the door. He wasn’t fast enough to miss the way Dean’s muscles rippled as he moved.
“Sorry about that, Miss Carrigan.” Dean sat across from her and clasped his hands together. “I interviewed Mr. Milton, now, let me hear your side of the story.”
What started as a bad day ended on a somewhat peaceful note. The ride across the lake was an experience. He’d seen Dean’s smile for the first time. A genuine smile that lit the universe. He couldn’t help staring at Dean -- because in his mind, he was Dean now, not the game warden, not Winchester. Dean had caught him staring once, but Castiel had blown it off, using the sound of the engines to deter conversation. An attraction wasn’t in the plans. Three weeks in and out. No attachments of any kind.
“He is friends with Ruby Cortese, the leader of a coven in the States. She’s been warned about using dark magic, but I do not trust her,” Missouri offered. She turned to Castiel. “You must go to them, Castiel. Take them somewhere safe.”
He’d called Crowley and reinstated his original contract. The surly producer had been sarcastic and told him next time he and Dean had a ‘falling out’ that he’d personally castrate both of them. Castiel figured Crowley was all bark and no bite, but he found himself promising there would be no next time. He meant it. If he and Dean could get past the truth about Claire, then they could get past anything.
Dean pulled out his phone and scrolled down the screen. “Hey, Ash, I’m ready,” he spoke into the phone before hanging up and slid it back into the pocket of his jeans. Castiel followed the man through a series of hallways to a large metal door.
In the dim light, he saw Dean rise over him. Dean was holding the base of Castiel’s cock steady and then slick heat engulfed him. Dean must have prepped himself earlier and the thought of that made Castiel’s heart beat faster. He felt the blood pumping through his veins. Desire coiled inside his belly.
She laughed and then cut it off abruptly, her lips forming a tight line. “I
Castiel couldn’t help but laugh softly at Dean’s anecdote. “And now, you’ve presented
They got out and again, Dean took his hand, leading him inside the open bay door. “Hey, Benny, anyone home?”
“Playing house. Good for you, little bromyster. Have you said the ‘L’ word to each other yet?”
“Not just Claire. Her dad has come to mean a lot to me.”
“Come here and let’s see what’s in the bag, huh?” He reached out his hands and she lifted her arms. He scooped her up with one arm and carried her back into the dining room. Gabe trailed after him, still holding the forgotten toy.
He pulled on his robe and yawning widely, went downstairs. He stopped at the doorway and smiled at his husband’s antics. Music was playing softly and Dean was talking to the guinea pigs. “Jaba, you need to take care of yourself, man. Look at Mooch. His fur is all long and flowing like your Uncle Sam’s and yours… well, let’s face it, your butt is a mess. Did you try to pee on yourself? Or is it truly an accident? This is why your daddy won’t get you a girlfriend. What self-respecting female wants a guy that pisses on himself?”
Eyes returning to the road, he flipped his turn signal and took a right onto Anthony Street “I know you’re kind of bummed I chose Whitman...” Castiel opened his mouth to disagree, but Jack kept going. “and I just wanted to tell you that I love you, Dad.” He tapped the brakes, knowing he needed to slow down and possibly pull over for this conversation. “You’ve always been there for me and you’ve always supported me.”
? He studied the map and saw Bees Branch with a red pin next to it. Everything clicked and he showed Novak the boat ramp they’d use.
Claire beat him to the porch and rang the doorbell. It was Emma that answered and both girls squealed. Castiel thought that every dog in a two mile radius was going to start howling at the high-pitched sound. How did something so small and cute make that kind of ear-piercing noise?
His husband opened the door wider. “Lola, go get your daddy.” The huge dog bounded out of the apartment. Beside him, Tina screamed and hid behind him as a hundred and thirty pounds of solid muscle bared down on them.
happy to be named the winner of this stupid competition. He was going to kill his older brother, Gabriel. This was all his fault. He’d entered the contest, forging Castiel’s signature, and taking video without his knowledge.
"I missed her." He kissed her downy hair and breathed in her baby scent. He never tired of it.
“I live in Atlanta.”
“Uh, huh,” Benny said disbelievingly.
“Get to work, boy.” She strode purposefully down the short hall, but he saw the soft smile she tried to hide from him.
want to be tongued open... he
“The Council won’t reconvene until next month, so we can depart tonight.” He knew Madame Tran would want to see him about Missouri’s grimoire. She would probably summon him once she was finished
“She’s leading a choir with the angels now,” Selma Louise called from across the kitchen.
Dean grabbed one of the crates and Jo took the other, setting them carefully on the asphalt. The bleating really was breaking Dean’s heart, so he released the clasp and gently took the babies out. They stood on trembling legs beside him. They must have smelled their mother on him, because they stayed with him while Jo headed inside the back door to get one of the staff.
“What do you want to do?” His voice sounded tired and Castiel put aside his anger to face him. He had dark circles under his eyes and his lips were drawn in a pinched line.
“For a birthday party.”
He sounded so earnest that Castiel couldn’t refuse, though he knew he’d second guess himself later. He nodded.
“I’m listening.”
He looked down at his blue tie and black suit. “Yes.”
Cas’ teeth dug into his lower lip and he eased out only to thrust back forcefully. Both men grunted. “You’re sure...” Cas asked, looking down at him, elbows locked, holding himself steady.
“You sure did, buddy.” Dean stood up and picked up his and his son’s plates. Castiel jumped up to help clear the table. “Hey, no, man. Sit back down. You’re our guest.”
“If I was mistaken, I humbly apologize, and I can go back and tell your ‘friend’ I was joking around.” Castiel stopped, ready to do whatever Dean needed him to do.
“Do your parents know you’re here?”
He gave her a smile and settled down to catch up on the news. He was reading an article about Pete Buttigieg, when he caught a whiff of cloying perfume. A manicured hand pointed to the picture of the presidential candidate. “He doesn’t stand a chance.” A female body was pressed against his side and he looked up. The woman was striking, slim and blonde.
Alistair’s  smile was cold and Dean instantly thought of a barracuda he’d seen at the New Orleans Aquarium a few years back. “You
“Yeah,” he muttered.
“No, you don’t have to make a decision until the next time the Council convenes. This... this is about Missouri’s final spell.”
Henriksen slid two cell phones toward him. “These are your phones.” He tapped one of them. A late model iPhone. “Never call me on this one. Ever. We will mostly communicate via email. If it is urgent, I will call
Dean nodded and tried to hand him the application, but he was off again. “We average about ten wedding cakes a month. I’m usually doing those myself, but I’d love to see your piping skills. All of our special orders come through me or Meg. She mans the website for me. Let’s go have a cup of coffee and talk.”
“This place sells healthier choices, Dean. You’re forty, man.”
that a rogue alligator is out there somewhere and we’ve just seen the tip of the iceberg.”
At the top of the stairs, his eyes fell on the picture of the three of them outside an office building in Bogota after signing the final papers making Calliope theirs. He kissed the downy hair on her head. His life was complete.
Castiel liked seeing this side of Dean. Gone was the cocky celebrity chef. This Dean was more...human.
She smiled up at him. “I’m going to walk you through a quick tutorial, but this one is just like any other smart phone on the market. We can set your security code...” She brought up a screen and turned it toward Dean. “Just enter the pin number you want to use.”
I apologize for how long it's taken to get another chapter up. The COVID-19 epidemic has made me crazy. It has sucked the creativity right out of me and so I had to distance myself from social and mainstream media to get my sanity back. After four seasons of Rupaul's Drag Race, I'm finally feeling it again. Thank you for your patience.
“That’s cool, man. Like with snakes and stuff?” He looked a bit squeamish when he said snakes, but most people often misunderstood the amazing creatures.
“Yeah, Mandy’s a great kid. She damn sure keeps me on my toes.” Dean watched as a smile transformed the handsome face in front of him and he forgot how to breathe. A voice in his head kept telling him to look away before Milton thought he was a perv. That other one, the devil or angel, he didn’t know which, was telling him to see if those lips tasted as good as they looked.
“Shut the fuck up, Abby,” she yelled down at the mutt and it was like she flipped a switch. It tucked its tail between its legs and scuttled inside the house. “Look, Lilith and I were friends in high school, but since she’s been back... well, let’s just say we didn’t run in the same social circles.”
Castiel expected Dean to bolt after this announcement. Most men would. He didn't date because dating when you were a single father was disastrous. He'd tried it once, right after he got the adoption papers signed, making Claire his. He was asked out by a man he'd met at a coffee shop. He’d found a babysitter and met the man for a drink. The date seemed to be going great until the sitter called to say Claire was running a fever. When his date found out he had a child, he freaked. Life was easier without those kinds of complications.
“I don’t plan on bringing Claire here. Her home is in Atlanta... with me.”
Dean remained stoic as he and Benny brought the cooler up onto dry land and then loaded it into the chopper. Castiel knew the funeral would have to wait until the city was safe from the aftereffects of the storm. He would most likely be back in Florida. They returned to the boat and Benny carried the woman’s remains to the waiting crew.
Dean laughed softly. “Dude, Big Tex is only thirteen feet long and he holds the record for Texas. I know you’re an expert and all, but seriously? Twenty-five feet? I’m not buying it. I’m leaning toward a...”
Naptime didn’t go as planned. Claire was over stimulated by having Dean with them and she fell asleep in the stroller coming back from the park. When he tried to get her unbuckled without waking her, she opened her eyes. “Da,” she mumbled and then saw the new tea set that Dean had bought her. She squealed and was very much awake. He mouthed, “I’m sorry.” Dean took it well. He got down on the floor and pulled Castiel down with him. The three played until lunch. Dean whipped up a couple of grilled cheese made with asiago and smoked gouda. When Claire tired herself out again, Castiel lifted her and deposited the sleeping child into her crib.
“This is The Cowboy, signing off with one of my favorites,
Dean flipped through Cas’ FBI badge, his fake driver’s license listing him as Angus Young, and a credit card for emergencies.
"Jack, is everything okay?” They usually spoke twice a week and Jack always waited for Castiel to call him.
“Just thought you’d be digging the new food he’s putting out. Word has it you’re somewhat of a foodie.”
“Gabriel and I stole a rival high school’s mascot before homecoming.”
Truly smiling for the first time since he got the call about his mother’s heart attack and subsequent death, he rolled his eyes. “I can do scrambled eggs. Anything else will require a trip to Ellen’s.” The memories kept coming. Ellen was one of his biggest supporters. He and Dean could hold hands and act like a real couple in the small diner attached to Harvelle’s Roadhouse. He missed her. She was probably lost to him too. Local boy becomes junkie... he figured it made the headlines here as well.
Dean chuckled tiredly, “baby…”
“Ow! What the fuck!?”
Dean’s phone started ringing and Castiel was about to slap Dean into his handsome face.
"Come on, Dean surrender to me, I'll make feel
“Come on, let’s have fun.” Dean said, to lose the tension and to stop the awkward silence that wrapped them the moment they saw each other.
Okay, he's close enough. He has this. He'll just casually gonna sit and ask him out, what could possibly go wrong? It's easy peasy.
Ready to be slaughtered to pieces, Castiel closed his eyes. The prayer still on his lips, whispering panicked. The sudden sound of broken bones made him open his eyes dreadfully.
He also noticed that Dean's friends didn't find the wedding so appealing, Charlie is still shocked and Benny's still tries to not sound mean when he speaks with Carmen.
When they were standing close to each other, Dean took out the apple juices and bent down to the kids' level, Ben grabbed the bottles and gave the one to Claire.
This time Castiel yells, eyes filled with tears.
The older man gave him a smirk, his toned body was glistering in sweat,
"Sorry about earlier, work..." Dean smiled apologetically, Cas returned the smile understanding. Obviously, a man like him would be busy as hell.
body washing.
"W-What?" Cas almost moaned.
Cas can't blame them though, people are quite shocked when he says he's gay, everyone thinks he's straight as hell.
“I get it, Castiel is cute and I have seen the way you look at him…” Lisa shakes her head, pointing to Cas and Balthazar laughing at each other.
“Is something wrong?” she asked leaning again.
Dean pushed him a little as they started walking towards the king-size bed, Castiel stepping back as Dean led him to the bed.
"Dean..."
Trying not to clench his jaw, Dean relaxed his face.
“Cas…” Dean moaned out before slumping down onto Castiel’s back, his hot breath making Castiel feel even sweatier and heated.
"I'm good, left Claire with my brother, how about you?"
Gabriel turned, his eyes still wide, but his expression was calmer.
He tries to keep his eyes steady to the road as he got closer to the hospital. He fights the tears that are threatening to roll down his cheeks.
Burying his nose into Dean's crook of the neck he inhaled his sweaty but so intoxicating aroma, he smelled so manly yet so sweet. They weren't words to describe how perfect he was.
Castiel turned his head to the side, humiliation encircling his whole body, for a second, he felt special.
"Is this because of Cas?" Sam almost choked a laugh.
Then everything happened too fast.
"No! Make one more step and you'll regret it, man..." Dean snapped angrily pointing at the guard who stopped immediately when he saw that death glare.
Castiel blushed but it did not reach his whole face, he still was nervous and so scared about his brother.
, at least Cas still is. But the anger and the hurt make him hate every single inch of that piece of garbage he called a husband, especially today.
“Now, that I see you, so much better…”
Castiel is dreading to go to work tomorrow, he can’t spend 12 hours again cause Michael can’t do his own paperwork, he already earns little, working four extra hours without wage will kill him.
Castiel ended things before he hurt himself even more. Dean didn’t love him. Sure, he found him sexy and cute, but he probably could never imagine them together.
blame yourself…” Castiel hisses letting a frustrated sigh. “You’re too good for me, Dean I-I don’t
Dean rested his cock on his entrance, placing his big hands on each side of his hips.
He felt Cas’ heart speed up a little, but calming down immediately, lacing their fingers together.
Time. He needs
Cas sighed.
"I wanted to..."
When he stands up and finally opens the door, his eyes wide, and his lips part from the surprise.
Then another image got into his mind. Something that made his whole body shiver with lust.
"That's my good boy," Castiel crooned when Dean relaxed into his body. "You're going to wait as long as I want. I want to take my time and
What if they do not like Castiel? Bobby wasn’t thrilled having him here.
Dean moved over so Cas could sit next to him, he heard Bobby sigh, the older man hated when strangers were in their secret bunker.
And never will be. Cause Dean isn’t boyfriend material, he’s fucked up and Cas deserves someone better. Not that Dean cares. He and Cas are just fuck-buddies,
"Mmm...
All the eyes of the room were on him.
“How are you feeling?”
"Hello, Dean, nice to meet you," the dark-haired father kneeled  to greet the boy, "hello, Ben...you and Claire having fun?"
Dean felt Cas' body shiver in the best way possible, especially when he ran his fingertip around his rim, getting him slick, easing him open.
Castiel leaned in and licked the head of Dean's cock that was peeking out the foreskin. Dean released a breathy growl at the feeling making the king grin satisfied.
Charlie’s immediately by his side and trying to get him up, some other students help too, Gabriel is next to him a few seconds later.
Two strong arms slipped around Cas and pulled onto his chest until their bodies were twined together. Cas' eyes were hot and his heart felt too big for his ribcage.
. Like Cas sensed his intense stare, he met Dean's eyes.
“O-okay…” the white make-up and the loud music were saving him from being seen blushy and stuttery, like a freaking horny virgin.
Dean sighed but smiled at the two of them, his face though got serious in a second. He cleared his throat and everyone’s attention was on him. There were still some people Castiel didn’t recognize but he put the thought to the back of his mind, right now they needed to find his brother.
Guilt started wrapping around his body, he didn’t know what he did, but Cas avoided looking at him a couple of minutes earlier. He never was like that with him.
"Are you drunk?"
The blue-eyed superstar, Gay icon, and heartthrob of the Music Industry, Bisexual, and married to one of the most famous and hottest action movie actors in Hollywood. Dean Winchester.
Dean continued to suck kisses all over his neck and collarbone as he started pulling his jeans and boxers down incredibly slowly. Castiel groaned and pushed him away, this was taking him too much, he needed Dean naked
Castiel sat down the chair Sam was seconds ago; he bites down on his lips to refrain himself from crying again.
Dean was on top of him now, his solid weight enveloping his body so
“Dean?”
How can you be so irresponsible?! For God,s sake Dean, how could you do this to Sam? You are the only one he has..."
Castiel pulls away for a second and smirks when Dean chases his lips like a hungry dog. Playfully he pecks him, once, twice, and then Dean has enough. He grabs his chin with one hand and pulls him in, kissing more fiercely.
Carmen was about to pass out, her face pale and red from anger at the same time.
Cas smiled as Dean nuzzled his jawline,
Feeling Dean's balls tightening he licked the sac hearing Dean swearing and breathing hard on his hole, he returned to the cock and started to bob his head up and down, he matched it with the long, fast thrusts of Dean's tongue inside his hole.
Dean didn't need to be told twice, he spread some more lube over his throbbing cock and pressed into Castiel's ass. They both groaned in sync, the green-eyed man did not lose time to press their lips into a heated sloppy kiss.
Castiel sighed and pushed his chair closer to the bed, after a small fight with himself to touch Dean he carefully brushed his long fingers on the green-eyed man’s cheek gently, feeling the rough stubble.
“It looks beautiful, Chef Winchester,” Castiel said, placing his napkin on his lap. “I’m sure it will taste amazing.”
“Yes and no. It was more of a transfer.” Dean gave him the universal
He let himself in with his key, the sense of pride still feeling new. Cas, always early, smiled at him. “Good morning, Dean.”
Chuck sighed. “What do you need from me?”
“He’s with me, Jo.” Dean appeared at his left. Where had he come from?
“Guess so.” Dean knew he sounded like a spoilt child, but he didn’t really care. He was about to wind his way around Cas to get inside, but a strong hand gripped his bicep. He was unceremoniously dragged behind the heavy doors where no one could see them.
“Ma’am, you will have to leave. I insist, or I’ll have to call the police.” He gingerly made his way around her and pulled back the curtain. The showroom was still dark and there was no sign of Meg. The various clocks began to toll the hour. His appointment would be here in fifteen minutes and he had a strange woman to get rid of.
Everyone around them cheered and clapped happily, Sam was wiping his eyes and had an arm around Gabriel's shoulder who grinned like crazy. His mother was smiling with happy tears and everyone was happy as hell which made Dean's heart full. It wasn't long before two pairs of small hands wrapped around his and Cas' legs.
Michael and he started dating a few weeks ago, he was in Castiel’s finance class and he flirted with him quite a lot now.
Opening the door, Dean's heart drops.
When the door closes, Dean draws in an exasperated breath, eyes blinking open as he glares at his reflection in it.
He knew things were a little off lately but they always found ways to get through this. They always found each other, they were in love.
" he almost grimaced at how fake-interested his voice sounded.
Castiel smirked and carefully pulled the briefs down, springing the cock free, Dean growled lifting his hips so it would go off easily.
Balth snorts next to him and Cas wants to glare at him.
“What can I say, some things don’t work out…”
Once again,
Castiel didn’t say anything, he just crushed his lips against Dean’s wrapping his arms around his neck, pulling him incredibly close.
He finally lets the tears fall; a heavy sob lets out his throat as Dean’s lifeless body is all he could think.
It didn't take long before he started licking the heated skin. Dean growled and Cas felt the vibration of it in his cheek and the nice feeling of the soft beard.
Kissing Dean's inner thighs and making the green-eyed man gasp and groan he took mercy and hooked his fingers on the elastic of the black tight boxers. Sliding them down, Dean's cock spread out thick and proud.
Cas blushed when Dean gave him one more look, his hair was messy, dyed in half blue and half red,
“I needed to keep you safe.” Dean tries to get up, wincing.
, can I call you later? I'm kinda in the middle of," Cas saw Dean's eyes turn red, his irises sparkling in a shiny crimson shade, "...
, even though his plan was stupid, its obviously a trap, Gabriel could already be…
Dean returned the smile adoringly and captured Cas' lips into another kiss, biting softly his bottom lip and licking into his mouth.
“Glad you made it boy.” He says as he pats his back, Bobby gave him a small smile, but he could see the red eyes the older man had.
He snaps his head to look at Dean, when their eyes meet, Castiel’s heart stops and then starts beating even faster.
Castiel gives him a small smile, as he watches Dean’s frustrated frown. Only Dean Winchester would be lying in a hospital bed with a broken leg and thinking about his car.
. Castiel looked him with wide eyes.
maybe he's a bit overdramatic, nevertheless, it was mean. Whoever did it, didn't know the backstory and how literally he took things seriously.
Castiel freezes when his eyes meet with those green he so much missed, suddenly his throat tightens into a knot, lips parting when he travels his stare at Dean.
He is probably doesn't want to have to do anything with Dean.
Cas gripped harder the chair in front of him, his knuckles turning white, every emotion he has inside his chest about to explode.
it was a
Lisa Braeden was sitting on Dean's lap, her arms around his neck as she started to blurt some things he couldn't understand. Castiel's frowned, a hurt expression flushing all over his face.
Put on a happy face.
Back at the cabin, Cas cleared a spot on the front porch that was well lit and would stay lit until the early afternoon.
“Cas I—”
"No, you don't."
Now he was here, alone, in a cell and a space that was circled inside an underground area. Dean hoped Sam and his other men were alright. He couldn't protect them, what kind of leader would he be if he didn't have any men,
They stayed like this for almost an hour, lazily making out and smiling like idiots at each other. Dean wrapped him in his arms, and it was all too easy for Castiel to fall asleep.
He was about to thank the handsome Gryffindor Captain and say that he’s tired before those dark and ugly thoughts that no one needs him or wants to be with him come back.
Castiel’s heart fluttered and melted at the same time. Dean was actually asking him out. On a date! A real date.
…” Castiel fights again with tears—fuck why he’s so emotional? well more like a crybaby.
"Hey man, come sit with me." Dean offered and sat on the bench, Castiel followed and checked around if Dean had other company as much like his wife or girlfriend.
Bobby pulls him into a hug and Castiel missed the older man so much, as much as Charlie and Benny, they all been like family to Castiel.
The dark haired teen was bullied a lot about his easy crying. They always were calling him 'sissy' or 'little girl' and the worse 'faggot'. But Cas got confident.
Fucking Dean Winchester,
Castiel sighed as he closed the door of his apartment shut. His trench coat felt absolutely heavy and he couldn’t keep his eyes from shutting.
“Hey, sweetheart.” Castiel gave him a tired smile as he picked the golden furred cat into his chest.
"Come on daddd!" Ben clutched his leg and looked at him with big dark eyes.
