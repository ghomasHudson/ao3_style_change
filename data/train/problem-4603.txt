As Dean headed for his locker, the congratulatory claps to his shoulders and teasing towel whips to the ass were enough to coerce a reactionary grimace and a head shake out of him as he removed the helmet sticking to his head.  That game took a lot out of him.  More than usual.  He recounted all the trivial ways he could have done better as he removed his heavy shoulder pads and was already mentally preparing to hear backseat coaching notes from his Dad tomorrow morning over breakfast.  But for the moment, he was lost in thought.  So much so that he almost missed it when his best friend Benny sidled up to the locker beside him and started trying to shoot the shit with him too.
“Like a baby,” Dean replies with as much enthusiasm as his sleep deprived, sore body can muster.  He clearly isn’t above a good, old-fashioned white lie.
Castiel scanned the bedroom they were standing in and thought back to the layout of the apartment in the dark.  There was only the one bedroom.  He was sure of it.
After a moment's hesitation, she trudged over to prop herself under Castiel’s other arm, leading him towards the front door.
This too seemed as trivial as small talk at work.  He wasn’t home, not really.  He didn’t have much of one, physical or otherwise.  And all he did was work.  Dean scoffed at the thought as he stared at the blank page in front of him.  He didn’t want to think anymore tonight.  It would make sense eventually, he convinced himself.
Castiel groaned as he twisted his wrist.  “You know, I’m older than you.  What makes you think I can even get it up again?”
A few turns go by before Cas whips out one of those godforsaken blank tiles. “It’s a ‘Z’,” he decides, placing it off the other ‘Z’. ‘JI_Z’. JIZZ. Of course, the ‘J’ is on a triple letter.
“We saved you a seat!”  Charlie was all smiles and sunny disposition most of the time, with little exception.  This wasn’t one either.  She was smiling up at him, expectantly waiting for him to make a move one way or another.  The stop for the museum wasn’t for at least another ten minutes.
“Cas—” he started, but the word broke in his mouth.  Fat tears welled up in his eyes and he closed them to keep the tears inside longer.  “Cas, is this real?”
“Ugh, fuck, should we talk about this?”  Castiel groaned deep in his chest at the loss of Dean’s mouth, thrusting his hips up into Dean’s.    “Are we goin’ too fast?”
Castiel squinted and tilted his head in confusion.  He didn’t even own a phone.  The other boy looked like he was fighting back another laugh.  The first question was one he could answer though.
“Just the two of you?”  Not that it matters, but Cas is feeling kind of left out.  And if Sam and Jack leave it could get awkward.  Well, more so than it already has been at least.
Dean angled his head to search the desk.  Grabbing for the nearest folder, he held it up and pressed it into his chest, going right back to kissing his neck.  Of course.  His paper.  “We’ll see,” he quoted back between open-mouthed kisses.
Finally Sam stops, one hand on the trunk hood,  face ever concerned.  “It’s just… I'm worried about him.”  Sam says it with a sigh, keeping his voice steady.  He cards a hand through his long hair, leaning his weight against the fender of the Impala, while he waits for Jack to bring his luggage to the car.  “I mean, I know he has his usual routine of bottling himself up, but I don't know, Cas, I just don't feel right about not having any answers.  And if Dean won't give me any, and you don’t have any then maybe Wendy will.  Besides, someone should keep an eye on him and you're the best choice we've got.”
The door on the other side of the room creaked open and clicked shut and the muted sound of bare feet padding across the carpet was the only sound Castiel could focus on.
Catching himself fixating on the sliver of skin peeking through the torn fabric of Dean’s jeans, Castiel averted his eyes.  He settled them instead on the blurred images breezing past the window.   Except the old woman with the shakily-applied lipstick seated across from him thought he was making eyes and started making them back.  Color rushed to his cheeks.  Awkwardly scratching the hairs at the back of his neck, Castiel decided the safest option would have been to close his eyes altogether .
Following his gaze, Castiel pondered for a moment, lips turning down in the corners.  Balthazar had ordered this drink for him before he disappeared twenty minutes ago.  “I- I don’t actually know what this is...” he offered, futilely. His cheeks were pink, but that could’ve been the drink.
Dean’s lips quirked as he considered it.  “Right.”  He gave an easy nod, seemingly gaining confidence, as he slowly stalked across the carpet, allowing his eyes to roam freely over Castiel for the first time tonight, inserting himself into Castiel’s space.  “Prove it,” he challenged, hotly, in the dense air still left hanging between them.  It was thick like the heat in summer, crackling with electricity.
Just as he was finishing up folding and putting the clean clothes back into his laundry basket his phone buzzed again.
“Did you know that oysters are considered an aphrodisiac, Dean?” His eyes were lingering on Dean’s lips, wet with oyster juice and whatever else was on them.
Charlie, for her part, turns back to face him with a smile plastered tightly across her face.  “Why, yes, Dean.  What gave it away?  Was it the flannel shirt?  The combat boots?  Problematic fave, Scar Jo, being listed as my wife in my old MySpace bio?  Or the fact that you’ve met my real live girlfriend more times than I can count?”
“Hey, Cas…” Dean rests a hand against the door frame and stares at Cas staring at his dress shoes, willing him to get on with it.  He tries his best to avoid direct eye contact as well.
“Well, it would potentially involve bringing future sexual partners back to the apartment and I don’t want you to feel, um, like a stranger in your own home, or however the saying goes.”
“If you untie me, you could have it, you know,” he offered when it became apparent that Castiel wasn’t listening to him.  “Everything you’ve prayed for when you should have been praying to God.  I could give it you,” he said simply.  Words emphasized by an upwards thrust of his groin.  “Or, you could take it,” he wantonly suggested when Castiel didn’t stop, opening to him on the dirty mattress like a twisted blossom.  His eyes were searching for Castiel’s weakness.
“You’re picking... that up... later,” Castiel muttered between kisses and Dean hummed his agreement, but it only made Dean kiss him more adamantly just to shut him up.
Dean shook his head with a chuckle.  “Yeah, y’know you’re not as dumb as you look sometimes.  ‘M proud of you, kid.  Just wish you’d get a haircut one of these days.”
About half a block down from the laundromat, Dean had to stop for the crosswalk.  He pushed the walk button and waited for the traffic to clear.  Standing there on the sidewalk, he tried his best to mind his own goddamn business, but apparently, he had no such luck.
“Yeah?  You thinkin’ about switchin’ teams?”  Dean chuckled.  “Cuz you know, you gotta sign up just like all the other schmucks.”  He reached around to get the backs of his thighs.
“Um… What- What is it?  How long?”  He asked, mind and body still in shock.  How was this possible was a more apt question.
Dean nodded back.  “Awesome.”  He handed him over a couple bucks in quarters and if he threw in a few extra for something to eat, nobody else really had to know.  Not that Ronald was a life lesson or anything, but seeing him always reminded Dean his life could be way worse.
was more like it.  School never really came naturally to Dean and he had to work twice as hard to maintain his grades as most of the other guys on the team, but even if he didn’t really care about football as much as his Dad did, Dean could admit, just in this moment, maybe he was a little proud of himself too.
Sam smiles back, patting him on the arm.  “Great,” he says, before his eyes trail down to the armful of snacks Jack managed to pick out.  He sighs again, resigning himself to never let Jack go grocery shopping with Dean ever again.  “Let’s find some better options, huh?”
He laughed.  “What, and you're not?”  Dean had a hard time believing that most people weren’t above all this.
Gesturing to the first slide with his clicker, he spoke again, louder, “As you might have guessed by my screen-saver hiccup, and more importantly, the Michelangelo exhibit you should have all seen during our museum trip last week…” he wordlessly scolded whoever might not have gone with a quick finger wag, “This week’s lectures will be dedicated to Michelangelo Buonarroti, but today in particular, I want to discuss with you the effect David had on Renaissance sculpture.”
Dean’s mouth parted to speak, but nothing came out. Nothing sounded right. He was just grateful the impact of his stare wasn’t on him at the moment. What was he supposed to say to that anyway? He couldn’t think of one damn thing good enough, so he stared at Castiel’s downturned face, at his chewed fingernails peeling at the label, then to the muddy soles of his own sneakers against the floorboards, without saying anything at all.
His eyebrows inched towards his hairline, stunned at his flippant tone.  “Or whatever?  What does that even mean?”
“I’m starting to think this assignment is some form of punishment, but I can’t figure out what we did to deserve it,” she said, flipping through her lined notebook pages.  Charlie took organized notes.  More organized than Dean, at least.  She was the kind of person that brought different colored highlighters to class and that said all it needed to.
"You two seem mighty friendly," he noted around a particularly sloppy bite.  The brown milk ran down into his bristly beard and he wiped it with the back of his sleeve.  He pointed his spoon to the jacket clutched between Dean’s hands.  “Daddy give you a present?  You a kept man now?”
Behind the wheel, Crowley grinned back once he spotted the outline of him in the dark and cranked his window down lower.  “Get in loser, we’re going shopping!”
“You, mostly.  My… desires.”  Castiel hung his head and stared at the spot on the carpet between his boots, slipping his hands into the pockets of his jeans.   “I don’t know what I can say to you now because the way I’ve behaved is inexcusable, and I wouldn’t fault you in the slightest for not believing anything that I’ve said, but I’m here and I want to give you the choice.  So if you want me, I want to give you whatever it is that you want.”
Heading for the door, he pulled it open, nodding a curt greeting to Aaron entering behind him covered in clay sediments and leaving Dean to stew in his own inebriated juices.
The sudden headrush is intoxicating like a sweet poison coursing through Dean’s bloodstream.  His eyes roll back, skull knocking against the headboard.  His fingers claw at Castiel’s arched back as he licks at the wound,  but the distinct moment he catches the scent Dean’s latches onto Castiel’s throat once more.  They moan in unison, coaxing the other out, intoxicated on the others essence alone.  And this feeling of absolute ecstasy is enough to remember the sheer gravity of just how long his soul has been tethered to Castiel’s.
Mulling it over on his cold walk back to his dump of an apartment, Dean decided if there really were only two options currently on the table, he was just going to have to make room for a third.
Castiel reluctantly tears himself away, lips lingering on his throat a moment longer, before he meets his gaze.  “You never had to,” he utters, “I’ve always been yours.”
Castiel’s eyes flew open wide to take in the people crowding around him like a caged animal and Michael was there in his face to hunt him down.  He looked overwhelmed to say the absolute least.  He shrunk back against the wall behind him, whimpering, but Michael didn’t let up.
She shook her head as she took a seat in her fancy, swivelling desk chair.  “You know, that’s what I like about you,” she mused.
Dean’s playfully rolled his eyes, but his smile widened just that much more.  “I know, Mom.  Love you too.”
“Not sure,” he said with a sniff.  “Didn’t find her till about a week ago.  Wasn’t paying her rent checks, or something.  Landlord came to check first thing.  Can you imagine finding that?  What a way to go.”
Castiel rolled his eyes again.  “Fuck you,” he said, suppressing a smile.  It hadn’t been that long, had it?
He wasn’t in a hurry.  The museum stayed open a bit later than usual on Tuesdays and he wanted to make the most of the day to help clear his head.  The train ride there didn’t exactly help, but taking the leisurely route to the exhibition gallery certainly did.  Winding his way through a maze of Renaissance and Baroque, Folk and Americana.  Taking a brief sequester through the hall of Sargent portraits, until he reached his awaited destination.
In his stupor, Dean hastily stumbles for the door again, closer now this time, but within seconds he’s being thrown against it with a firm hand gripping him tightly by the jaw.
Next, he made his own bed then he plodded over to Dean’s after to make it properly.  He straightened out the sheets, tucked the comforter back into the foot of the bed, and then reached for the pillows to fluff them up too.
Aaron hesitated a moment by the door before entering the office.  Cautiously, he took a seat in the ripped chair across from Castiel.  The one Balthazar hadn’t bothered to grace all week, Castiel absently noted.
“There’s an entire room full of desks,” Dean gritted out, forcefully staring at his textbook.  “Sit somewhere else.”
Covering her hand with his own, he pushed it away.  With a gulp, he stammered, “Lisa, I can’t tonight, okay?  It’s late.  I gotta get home.”
On one particular jolt of his hips, their cocks aligned, causing Castiel to suck in a sharp breath.  When it happened again, he let it out in pleasured agony.  He needed more.  He must have pleaded for it because Damien circled his hips faster than before, letting out a few restrained whimpers of his own.  They weren't following the music anymore and Castiel couldn't place when the song changed, when this dance changed.  But there were still rules, Castiel learned.  His hands found their way to Damien’s thighs, sliding up and over the hairless, slick skin there as they made their way to grope and tease along the cleft of his ass.  Damien immediately managed to turn himself around.  He pinned Castiel in with his forearms and leaned forward, ghosting his lips over the shell of Castiel’s ear.
When he finally slowed, Dean craned his neck back to lock their lips in a deep, hungry kiss like he was still searching for any salty bitter trace of himself on Castiel’s tongue.  For him, the only thing he wanted to taste was Dean, whatever form that came in.  Not wanting to exit him yet, Castiel clung to him, holding his back against his chest as he departed from Dean’s lips and kissed along the hinge of his jaw, down the line of his traps, and licked the sweat beading on the nape of his neck.  He nibbled the skin there and lazily smirked when Dean sighed into it.
Rolling his eyes, Castiel gently lowered the chair back to the floor and released his grip, pointedly not thinking about the fact Dean called him hot.  Almost as quickly, Dean reached out for Castiel’s wrist and forcibly pulled him in by it until they were eye level.  Pressing his hand against the welcoming bulge in his lap, Dean’s cock was already hardening in his jeans.
“Hasn’t she ever heard of a voicemail,” he muttered to the cat as he reached over to scruff the fur of his cheek again.  He purred his undoubted agreement.
Castiel wasn’t expecting the blatant affront or the conviction in which it was delivered, but given the nature of their meeting, he supposed insulting a professor wasn’t really crossing a line.  They had crossed most of those lines weeks ago.  What was one more?  That didn’t mean it didn’t affect Castiel.  “You’re different too,” he accused in a knee-jerk reaction, holding his gaze over the desk.
“Probably.”  Balthazar finished his glass quickly and reached for the bottle again.  Castiel wasn’t even half way finished with his own.  “Honestly, you should just confront him head on.  Rip the bandaid off, so to speak.  Tell him where you’re coming from and that whatever he’s fishing for isn’t going to happen.”
“Nice.”  Dean offered a wry twitch of his lips to the floor.  “So, what, is this like a routine thing for you or somethin’?”
Balthazar raised an eyebrow, obviously not believing that was the entire issue.  “Go on...” he prodded.
Thrusting out his hand, Dean palmed Cas’ cock, still strapped down in his suit pants, but Cas remained stoic and unreadable even as he stroked him through it. He dragged a thumb over Dean’s pouty, pink lips and suppressed a quiet groan when Dean welcomed it readily into his mouth.
He wouldn’t allow himself the thought that he could never take Dean’s hand in his own simply to hold it.
“This place looks haunted,” Sam said, appraising the place warily.  Which seemed fitting, being Halloween and all.
The reservations had been set for 9pm.  Castiel made quick work of getting dressed this time, leaving plenty of room for any train mishaps with enough left over to eat a light snack when all was said and done.  He never knew with Balthazar; Castiel’s mind flitting ever so briefly back to that one night during the last week of summer that seemingly preoccupied most of his thoughts as of late.
Dean pulls the lighter out of his pocket and flicks it. “Dean, wait--” Holding the flame to the bag, he attempts to recite the Latin incantation they’d found in the bunker library, but instead of destroying the hex, it causes the bag to erupt in a burst of purple light throwing Jack backwards through the thinly constructed office wall. “Dean, no!” shouts Jack between dusty coughs, but Dean is nowhere to be found. He clambers back through the hole in the wall to be sure, but sure enough, Dean’s gone. He can hear the loud booted footsteps ascending the iron stairwell and he knows it’s Sam and Cas by the footfalls.
With a soft moan on his lips, Dean’s fought to keep his hips from canting backward to meet him. “Harder,” he whimpered, letting himself turn his head. He met his eyes again through half lids and asked, “Please?”
“Yeah, actually, I kinda am,” he reluctantly admitted.  Come to think of it, he was starving.  As soon as he said it, Castiel let him go.
A devilish grin split Dean’s face into something menacing.  “That’s too easy.  Think harder, Father,” he said.  Like driving a hot spike just a few millimeters too close, he was clearly amused now.  “Before.”
Rounding the center island, he came to stand beside him, resting a reassuring hand to Cas’ shoulder as he surveyed the mess of burnt and bubbling pots on the stove.  The silence from him now was deafening even to his own ears.
“Then he just kept drinking more.  And then he was going on about you ‘abandoning the family’ again or something like that.  I honestly stopped listening at a certain point.  Eventually, he knocked himself out.  I grabbed the cash, put some stuff in a bag, and started walking.  But it... It wasn’t just tonight,” Sam admitted rather meekly and Dean’s blood boiled.
The other two make their way into the hall as well just to escape the pervading stench.  “We’re running out of time,” Cas tells Sam, noticeably frustrated.  “She obviously doesn’t know how she got here, so there may not even be a link between the hexbag and this location.”
Without even thinking, Castiel found himself speaking.  “Did you really come here to hang out with me?”  His throat felt rough and thick and it bobbed as he swallowed desperately for moisture.
Dean cast him an intentioned stare, dripping with implication.  “Beats me,” he said with a phony sense of casualness.  At Castiel’s still pissy face, he sighed.  “He was just asking me about the paper, dude.  Relax.  After everything, you really think I’d do that again?  Y’know I meant what I said too.”
The changing room was overrun with the other dancers crowding around the mirror, applying the last touches to their looks.  Dean stripped off his street clothes fast, and went for the bottles of body oil and glitter.  Hastily applying the scented oil, he rubbed the body glitter over his shoulders, chest and thighs, before using the remnants coating his palms over the peaks of his face.  Dean hated the smell of the oil.  It was the most artificially-scented attempt at a strawberry he’d ever smelled, but the customers loved it.  Castiel seemed to anyway.  People love a theme, good or not.
The three of them nod to each other, willfully ignoring the idea of what condition he might be in when they do. If they can even find him at all.
“Well, good, then you won’t mind hearin’ ‘em all a second time.”  He listed things off, voice droning on and on, and all Castiel heard again was ‘no touching, no touching no touching’.  He wasn’t here to touch anyway, he was here to talk.  “You got that?”  The man asked at the end of his tirade, eyebrows pointing towards the ceiling as he waited for an answer.
Reluctantly, Castiel made an unimpressed acknowledgment in his throat.  He really didn’t need to be reminded of that.  “You know, you also could’ve fucking told me you assholes were going to be late again, by the way,” he muttered, once Crowley had gotten onto the main road.  “I was crawling out of my skin back there.”
Dean beamed.  “Of course not!  Just give me a sec to take care of a couple things!  You can go wait in the car.”
“But, uh, your date, huh?”  Dean scratched his chin, faux-deep in thought.  “I think that could be arranged.  How about you come home with me for Thanksgiving first though,” he said, but his teasing face shifted into something more earnestly unsure when he looked Castiel in the eye.  “If you want to, that is.  I know you said you were gonna stay here and all, but mine’s been hounding me about meeting you for months.  I’ve been wanting to ask you, I just— It doesn’t have to be a big deal.  You don’t have to— Ugh, why did I—”
Castiel’s breath caught in his throat, but he absently shook his head in answer.  He wasn’t funny at all, but he was willing himself to listen.  To memorize the way Dean’s fingers felt tickling the back of his knuckles across the seat and the way his teeth dragged over his full lower lip as he shook his head.
Reaching over to the knob on the radio, Sam adjusts the station to some light indie music that Dean would most decidedly hate, having once referred to it as “pussy rock”, but Jack seems content enough to eat his candy bar and listen to it and, for that, Sam is grateful.
“Hey, Sam...”  Dean’s voice came out different than before.  He cleared his throat, but wasn’t sure how to continue.
.  If you wanted.  Be your knight in dirty leather and save you from this hell hole.  Whaddya say, Doc?  You wanna come with?”
It shouldn’t be this good. He shouldn’t crave the taste of him as often as he did, but he could spend hours not thinking of anything else but this. The rug burn on his knees and the old, familiar ache in his jaw. He wet his shaft good and hard, sucking him in shallowly at first, just to get used to the sheer girth all over again. He still shrank at that first nudge against the back of his throat. Cas’ hand was pressing down sternly on the nape of his neck and Dean’s eyes darted up to meet his as he stretched his mouth wider at the corners to take him, but Cas wasn’t looking at his eyes. Cas was admiring at the sight of Dean kneeling for him before he closed his eyes in anticipation. Dean quickly inhaled through his nose before Cas slammed hard into the back of his throat. Dean did his best to swallow around the intrusion. He slid his tongue around his length as Cas slammed in again so roughly Dean wondered if it were possible to bruise the back of your throat.
Castiel shrugged with a grimace.  “I’m not sure.  It seemed like a good idea at the time, I suppose.”
Well, wasn’t he just full of surprises.  “A guy after my own heart,” quipped Dean with a wide grin, grabbing his own beer.
Sam and Jess shared a silent look at their expense and grinned to each other like the shits that they were.  “We’re actually thinking about going to grab some food after this and we were wondering if you wanted to join us, Cassie?”  Jess asked, entirely too obvious given the context.
Dean let out a guttural moan as that same strong hand came to rest at the top of Castiel’s head.  Grabbing the base of his cock, Castiel suckled at the tip to lap up more and Dean couldn’t contain himself.  His head fell back against the driver side window with a thud and he pushed at the back of Castiel’s head, fingers curling to grip his dark hair, as a not so subtle suggestion.
Castiel sat at the bar nursing a warm beer during the lulls in conversation, until everyone decided to start in on the harder stuff.  It wasn’t like he was an expert or anything on the matter, but he didn’t think that was the wisest idea.  Not wanting to be a buzzkill though, Castiel accepted his first shot with about as much grace and enthusiasm as could be imagined, which was to say not very much at all.
“I’m sorry, I don’t think I heard you correctly,” Castiel said, anger rising.  “You ‘didn’t like him’?”  Balthazar simply stared like he wasn’t impressed by Castiel’s sudden bout of anger.  “I’m failing to see what your opinion’s got to do with any of this!”
The unquietable rage that threatened to consume him was only quelled by Sam removing his hand and gently placating him like he was the child here.  “It’s okay, Dean.  I’m okay.”  But it was very far from okay.  It felt like a knife to the heart.
With a quiet huff, he sat back in the chair and pulled the phone into his lap, subconsciously scanning the room before sliding his finger across the screen again, rereading the brief conversation with Balthazar over again.  Reaching out.  What more could he lose?  He decided fuck it and sent the message.
When Dean turned back around, his face was practically scarlet and the muscles in his jaw were working overtime.
Castiel couldn’t have asked for anything more in that moment, but Dean needed to be taken care of too, so he clumsily maneuvered himself lower in the bed and reached for Dean’s neglected cock.   The head was flushed a slick red and it twitched for him when Castiel wet his lips at the sight.  Without preamble, Castiel lowered his head to take Dean into his mouth and Dean let out an unexpecting gasp, fingers finding their way to tangle into Castiel’s already unruly locks of hair.  Dean’s eyebrows bunched in the middle and his spit shined lips parted as he watched Castiel bob and suck him into his mouth, inch by inch, until he hit the back of his throat.
“Hey!” Crowley barked from the front, eyes flitting between the road and the rearview.  “I just cleaned the upholstery from the last time!  This isn’t your own personal fuck-mobile so keep your bloody hands to yourselves!”
If you'd asked him a year ago if Dean Winchester entering his life was the worst thing to ever happen to him, Castiel would have been inclined to agree.  Nearly everything the younger man did irritated him; between asking Castiel to get his coffee on the first day like he was a handmaiden at his beck and call, referring to him as every other name besides his own, stepping on his toes with the weekly spreadsheets, and every other thing Dean had ordered him to do since, he was fairly certain hate wouldn’t have been a strong enough word.
“I know you need to feed, Dean.  Don’t withhold on my account.”  Lifting a finger to his own throat, Castiel punctures himself with the tip of his taloned finger and it’s like watching a rosebud bloom in the snow.
.  The posterboy of the Renaissance.  The iconic symbol of virility and youthful beauty.  No doubt, the most alluring depiction of David.  At least, in Castiel’s opinion.  Contrapposto carved in marble, begging the eyes to dance along the subtle curvature of the defined musculature.
He began to jerkily gather his things from the podium as his students began packing up theirs, but then someone was attempting to get his attention, waving their hands rapidly over their head.
“You never answered the question,” she helpfully supplied after a few minutes, obviously not letting this topic go for whatever reason.
Sam rolls his eyes and comes into the room anyway, closing the door behind him.  He waits by the door, but his eyes are still pleading a little bit.  His throat clicks as he carefully sorts through his words.  “Look, about earlier,” he starts, hand carding through his hair with a huff, “I know it's personal, but you're all we have to go off.  I think there's more to this thing.  Something we’re missing.”
Yet against all of his better judgment, he found himself feeling the small, bitter pangs of jealousy anyway.  Which was preposterous, really.  He mentally scolded himself for being the type of person to develop a crush on his straight roommate,  but here he was… a walking cliche.  A complete disaster.  And then Dean just had to go and start undressing.  He was
Castiel hummed to himself.  “This place feels so fucking good.  Like, just right here,” he said, sinking his fingers into the soft grass like strands of hair.  Sweeping his arms wide, he started making a snow angel, but there was no snow and the soft blades of grass between his fingers tickled more than anything.  Castiel outright giggled at the sensation.  Like tiny feathers stroking the backs of his hands.  “I’m fucking flying, you guys!”  His tongue tripped over the words in his mouth.  “Can you see my wings yet?  They're beautiful,” he said in awe, dragging the word out.
When Dean refused to answer this too, the back of his hand landed against the high ridge of his cheekbone. Dean flinched; it hurt, but he held firm. He wanted more. Wanted it harder. Wanted it to hurt. He wanted to be punished for what he did tonight. For what he did last week, for what he hadn’t even done yet. He wanted to feel it even when Cas wasn’t around.
“That’s up to you,” she said, grabbing his hips by the belt loops and pressing them together.  “How badly do you want it?”
Dean snorted.  “Y’know, never really been on this end of a striptease.  Startin’ to see the appeal.”
The rest of the words seemed to catch up with him as he looked mildly impressed.  Leaning back on his elbows, he asked, “How many girls we talkin’ here, Doc?”
“Later,” Meg said with a breathless laugh.  She removed her hand from the front of his jeans and pushed at his shoulder to put distance between them.
“Not really,” Castiel said.  “Not enough,” he corrected with a laugh.  Standing himself up, he brought his plate around to stack in the sink on top of Dean’s.  Though, if Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say it was just to force Dean to look him in the eye.  “This wasn’t just because I was drinking.  It’s important you know that.”
Sam and Jack make it to the halfway point a little after lunch time and as they drive they come upon a lonely Gas’n’Sip off the side of the beaten road.  Now being as good a time as any, Sam decides to pull over to fill up on gas and allow for something to carry them over till they can stop somewhere to get real food later.
Dean huffed a feeble laugh and wiped the tear track from his cheek.  “If it was that easy I’d have already tried it years ago,” he admitted.
And he couldn’t because he wasn’t.  Maybe Aaron should have asked who he’d like to be seeing, but then they wouldn’t have ended up there at all because the answer wasn’t ‘Aaron’.
It's close to midnight so there's really only one person it could actually be, who actually isn’t even a person at all really.  The door pushes open silently on its hinges, but Cas is rooted in the doorway like he needs a personal, engraved invitation.  Maybe he does, given the odd timing.  “Hello, Dean,” he rasps.  He's not wearing his trench coat and damn he really does look like he's been working out.  Do angels need to work out?
A short time later, Dean got to his feet as well.  He set his sights on the podium and lingered for a moment, trying to communicate something unintelligible with his eyes alone.  Castiel simply quirked his head and frowned, and to that, Dean rolled his eyes and left the classroom.
“Yeah, thanks.  You must be the guy who can’t take a hint.”  Turning his attention to Castiel, he lightly asked, “What d’ya say, Molly Ringwald, you ready to leave the party yet?”
Dean hummed in his ear.  “Well, when you put it like that, looks like your stuck with me.  So, what’s it gonna be?”  Inclining his head, Dean leaned in close, closing his eyes to revel in the scents of sex hanging in the air and clinging like sweat to Castiel’s skin.
Dean didn't know whether to laugh at it or cry because they had something in common, so he just gave the TV his half-assed attention and pulled out his phone again.
“Can’t I?”  Castiel replaced his reading glasses and pulled himself back into the desk.  Picking up Becky Rosen’s paper off the top of the stack, he flipped to what he supposed was his previous spot and pretended to resume reading.  When Aaron made no move to get up, he asked, “I’m sorry, was there anything else you needed?”
The art symbolism in this chapter is my favorite, just saying.  It's only fitting that our own posterboy stirs a rebirth in our oblivious professor lol.
Without any warning, Castiel suckerpunched Michael in the nose with a sickening crunch and launched himself off the kitchen stool, making a desperate beeline for the sliding glass door.  The room erupted in shock and awe and laughter as Michael clutched his bloodied face.  Some people whooped and hollered their support, and internally, so did Dean as he stared in disbelief at the blood dropping down the front of Michael’s polo shirt.
He bristled, feeling slightly irritated and willing himself not to turn an embarrassing shade of pink.  “Yes, Dean?”
“Then, please, tell me, because I’d really love to know:  Why do you think you deserve an extension?”
He pulled up the next slide with a quick press of his thumb and let the students absorb the image before beginning to speak.  It was Donatello’s rendition of David, cast entirely in bronze.  One hand hefted on his hip, while he placed a triumphant, sandalled foot upon the hulking, bearded head of Goliath.  It wasn’t without its flamboyant charms, of course.  The long, sweeping feather of Goliath’s helmet inching its way up David’s bare thigh.  Notedly, this David was just a boy, never attempted to be depicted as strong or virile.  This David won his fight against the giant through the grace of God and God alone.  Sans, perhaps, the long sword at his side.
Castiel narrowed his eyes and tilted his head curiously at his choice of phrasing.  Especially given he was apparently wearing his straight friend’s t-shirt.  “Keeping a jacket?  No, I don’t think so.  The anal sex on the other hand…”
Some part of Cas knocks against the wall, over and over again.  “Oh, fuck! Yeah, right there! Right there! Oh, fuck me— Fuck!”
Seeing Benny’s face while he was mid-orgasm wasn’t really something Dean ever wanted to experience once, let alone twice.  Definitely wasn’t trying to see it again if he could help it and he was beyond grateful that he’d only shown up afterwards this time.
With a shaking exhale, Dean relented.  He blinked three times and focused his attention on the eyes of the man gazing back at him showcasing an utterly mystified expression.  Dean felt small, but in this light, with the blood red staining both their faces, Castiel’s blue eyes appeared just as black with want as Dean’s.
“Unfortunately, I don’t have much in the way of groceries,” Castiel lamented.  “But there is a diner about a few blocks away.  I could offer you money for breakfast if you need it?”  His voice trailed off at the end, and he looked to Dean then, unsure if the offer was presumptuous.
Reaching for something, anything to talk about that wasn’t his shit life, Dean remembered the book sat beside him on the couch and stared at the cover.  At the sun and the web of string joining these hands together.  He’d never read Vonnegut before.  Based on the state of it, Castiel had read it a lot.
The next time he awoke, the orange sun was bleeding through the blinds.  The backdrop of it illuminated Dean’s profile as he propped himself up to drink from the tepid glass of water on the nightstand.  Castiel peered at him through squinted lids, fighting against the light, just to watch his throat work as he swallowed, but Dean caught him peeking out the corner of his eye.  A shy smile spread across his face at being watched.
Cas flickers his eyes between Sam’s and the closed bathroom door.  The only sound in the room is the muffled stream of water on the other side of it.  But he can’t tell Sam what he saw.  He feels like a pinned insect put on the spot, but had he actually even seen it?  He can’t really remember what the creature had looked like prior to shooting it.  He remembers what it’s brain looked like splashed across the imaginary wall of Dean’s bedroom.  Thick and Red.  Chunky.  He remembers that it had been wearing his exact cut and style of tasteful suit pants.  Black with a pressed crease.  The leather belt, the blue tie, the white shirt on the floor.  These are the concrete details that keep kicking him into silence.  Most prominently, he remembers the fact that it was on top of Dean.  An absolutely half-naked Dean.  And even more prominent still: That Dean had wanted it.  Wanted him.  Well, the mystery monster version at least.  But Dean hadn’t known it was a monster until Cas himself came barging through the door.  What would have happened if Cas hadn’t been able to get through?  What the hell was that thing?
The process goes twice as fast thanks to Cas drying and Dean almost looks like he wants to smile at him, but he doesn’t.  Resignation creeps back onto Cas’ face now that he realizes dinner is over with and Dean will probably want to head back to his room.  Back to avoiding him.  He’s about to ditch Dean altogether, walk his way over to sit in the library by himself, minding his own business, until an arbitrarily acceptable time has been reached for him to return to his own room and feign a human routine.  It’s all very tiresome, Cas thinks, as he heads for the door.  But then Dean clears his throat and Cas pauses just short of it and turns back to look at him.
Dean snorted with a shrug.  That was a toss up depending who you asked, Dean figured.  “Well, I gotta get goin’,” he said, hooking a thumb over his shoulder.
At some point, there were a couple of angry soccer moms duking it out over who got the next washing machine, but Dean didn’t tell them he was finished.  He wasn’t about to get his eyes scratched out by whoever didn’t win.  They both had tacky acrylic nails too.  No thank you.
The wood floor was digging in against his spine as they laid shoulder to shoulder, but it barely registered. Against the fading light of the sky, Castiel’s blue eyes were practically glowing, and not for the first time in his relatively short life, Dean got lost in them a moment too long. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he thought Polaris looked pretty dim in comparison. But then Castiel’s head lolled to the side, catching him in the act, and his mouth quirked in fond confusion at whatever dumb expression was showing on Dean’s face.
“You put on quite the show, Castiel!  Swallowing him down on your knees like a cocksucking whore!  I guess some things never do change.  If the priesthood couldn’t save you, what could?”  He laughed a maniacal thing, head lolling back.  “What would your father say to you now?  Why, he’s down here with us, wouldn’t you like to know?”
Castiel didn’t retract his hand.  Instead, he pressed his fingers in and squeezed the muscle flexing under his palm.  Dean had a sort of delicate strength about him, but his arms were firm, muscles sculpted.  He let out a small gasp at the touch.  The gentle noise sparked an ember low in his belly and the faint feeling of confidence crept back into his body.  If this is what Dean wanted then this is what Dean was going to get.
Coming up to stand over her, he grabbed her by the shoulders, shaking.  “NANCY.”  He practically shouted it at her, loud and even, but she didn’t react.  Reaching his hand up to her face, he tapped her cheek, lightly at first, but progressively harder, and when that did nothing, he hovered his palm over her parted lips just to make sure she wasn’t actually dead.
“Oh yeah!”  Her eyes were alight with excitement.  “Dorothy told me about a party off campus this weekend.  Do you want to come with?”
Looking himself in the mirror one last time, Dean touched up the makeup around his eye, sucking in a hiss every time the puff bounced on his cheek.  He washed the red from his knuckles too and waited for Ash to come get him again.  Dean would probably get shit for this from Crowley, but right now he still had a job to finish, so he knew it would wait till sometime later.  Sometime when it served Crowley best.  And within the next few minutes, Dean heard that little knock again.
“Fucking great,” Crowley muttered into the palm of his hand.  “You called me out in the middle of a deal and now I’m supposed to play babysitter to a bloody snow angel all night!?  I hope you’re happy.  Your favorite plaything has officially ruined my evening yet again!”
Setting his sights on the Impala, he shook his head and chuckled at the thought.  “I think I’ll go for a drive.”
A note of recognition passed over Professor Roche’s face as he watched Castiel watching Dean.  “Enjoy your food,” said Dean with a layer of phony politeness.
"I really enjoyed your lecture today," started Dean, thumbing the strap of his bag over his shoulder.
Dean wanted to scoff at the simple phrase.  “I wouldn’t do that, y’know.  I wouldn’t blackmail you.  I was just angry.”
Raising his hand out in Dean’s general direction, Castiel flipped him the bird and Dean burst into an unexpected laugh.
Dean wet his lips and looked up at him then.  Castiel seemed sure of himself, but Dean couldn’t help feeling like this couldn’t possibly be right.  “I wrote this the night before it was due,” he admitted.  “There’s no way.”  Shaking his head, Dean set the paper down and scrubbed a hand over his face.  It wasn’t like a B- was the best grade in the world, but he still felt himself getting worked up about it anyway.  “I told you I didn’t want special treatment.”
“Since my best friend would rather pluck his eyes out than get over himself,” he sassed, locking his gaze, before he uselessly sagged against his chair.  He drank from his mug, the very same one Balthazar had given him, and questioned himself.  Since when did Castiel Novak not care about obtaining tenure?  “You deserve the project more than I do,” Castiel concluded meagerly.  “I… I have too much going on, I wouldn’t be of much help to you.”
“Dad used to be okay,” he defended to no one.  “He wasn’t winning any father of the year awards or anything, but he was around at least.  I try to remember that guy sometimes when he drinks, but I dunno, growing up, for whatever reason, I was like his own personal punching bag.  When I came out here I thought he’d stop, but, um, guess I was wrong.”
“Oh, actually…”  Cas’ voice trails off into uncertainty, but it’s enough to stop him, prompting Dean to turn around and really look at him.
Suddenly, Dean reached his hand out for the knob on the radio to lower the volume and Castiel’s gaze flitted from his thick fingers to his twisted profile watching the road.  Something was eating at Dean too, it seemed, his eyebrows contorting in strange ways.  His lips parted as if to speak, but he didn’t say anything, he just pressed his mouth into a thin line.
The door buzzer whined and Dean caught it just in time, gesturing his chin for Sam to go ahead first.  The musty carpet in the hallway was old and stained under his feet and there was a lingering smell hanging in the air that Dean faintly recognized, but couldn’t quite place.
Lisa pulled at his arm to get his attention.  “Dean, baby, maybe we should just leave him alone.”  She sounded scared.
“Turn around,” Cas ordered, forcibly turning Dean himself when it didn’t register.  And really, who was Dean to argue?
"You're all spoon-fed, trust-fund, know-it-alls living the life daddy built for you and other people don't matter to you, they just get in the way.  You think of people like things instead of like people,” he clumsily accused.  Dean slid off the wall and plunked his heavy boots against the tile, planting himself squarely in front of Castiel, but Castiel held his ground.
He sniffed back tears, searching for the right words.  “You know, my whole life I always felt like I was running from something; from the monsters, the bad shit, the next apocalypse, even from myself, but I never- I never stopped long enough to realize I was running from you too because— cuz it was easier than facing you.”
“Right, anyway, you wanted to have a friggin’ game night of all things and I wanted to sit in my damn La-Z-Boy.  We ended up playing Dirty Words, which somehow in my own subconscious, I lost to Boy Wonder over there, but that’s beside the point, and that’s basically it.  So there you go, the more you know.”
Oh, god.  Dean scrubbed a palm over his face and pinched his eyes shut.  Blinking wide eyes at him, Dean let his hand drop to grip his laundry basket handles and feigned a small smile of feigned polite interest.  “...Mandroids?”  He was kicking himself already for asking.  He had to hold his breath at the overwhelming smell of piss and halitosis while Ronald went on some incomprehensible, nonsensical tangent.
Dean huffed a laugh and shook his head before continuing to pick up.  “Only the dick ones.”  Once it dawned on him there were no more clothes left to tidy, he set his hands on his hips and stared at Castiel as he shrugged into his blue dress shirt.  “So why me, then?”
“Yeah,” said Sam, sensing Dean’s guard going up, “Alright, Dean, but I still want to visit you sometime.”
He started up the shower then and let the water warm up between his fingers as he waited for it to reach scalding.  Stepping under the spray, he lathered up the soap and slipped his eyes shut as he washed away the sweat and the grime. He was hardly under for more than a few minutes before the solid weight of Cas’ naked body was crowding up against him.
Halfheartedly, Castiel flashed his driver’s license to the woman seated on a stool by the door.  She offered an impassive glance between the calm, reserved photo and Castiel’s agitated face before giving a nonchalant shrug and handing the license back to him.
Dragging himself to his feet, he trudged across the living room towards the fridge and opened it so harshly it jostled the contents on the door.  He grabbed the first container of drinkable liquid and drank it straight out of the container as he scoured for something edible as well, though that endeavor proved fruitless.  With a put-upon sigh, he slammed the door and took another swig of orange juice, though he had to wipe it from the front of his shirt when he saw the date on the calendar.
“True, but it doesn't matter.  You're coming out with me and I won't take no for an answer.”  He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a miniscule, plastic zip-lock bag containing a few little, white pills.  “Now, let’s get you closer to my level, shall we?”  He held the bag out between them.
Though, when the movie ended, Castiel couldn’t help feeling like the Duckie to Dean’s Andie and thinking that Molly Ringwald was actually kind of a bitch.
Dean wet his lips and waited for a sign of life.  “C’mon, Cas, please,” he murmured to the damp cement between his shoes, “Pick up.”
Dean squinted against the bright light reflecting off the garage door for any reaction.  The man, for his part, seemed confused.  Slowly, he turned around, holding a hand up to shield his own eyes.
Dean paused with his shirt half off and looked to the pathetic lump of blankets that was Castiel.  He cleared his throat before he spoke.  “You awake?”
Protectively, he shuffled over to his desk, full mug in hand, and settled back in his desk chair to scan over all the work he’d already completed during the exam period when a new email popped up in his inbox.  It was from Naomi.  Of course it was.  Castiel rolled his eyes and hovered his cursor over the name, but before he could click there was a light rapping on his door frame.
“Ahh, gotcha,” Dean said, sarcastically solemn.  “Well, if it makes you feel better, she was supposed to choose Duckie, but Molly Ringwald thought the other guy was cuter.  Never forgave her for that one.  Guess I’m doing it the right way this time.”
Tilting his head back to rest against the concrete slabbed wall, Dean lolled his head to meet Castiel’s haunted eyes.  In the light, Castiel could see three ghastly gashes scratched across Dean’s gaunt eye socket.  Blood encrusted scab wounds starting and ending in crescent moons.  Lisa’s blood red fingernails like claws.
He nuzzled himself back into the chair in a vain attempt to cling to the dregs of his own serenity.  He was just beginning to drift out to sea again when he heard it; the noise that had ripped him out of his rhapsodic dreamscape: The dull, repetitive thwack of carpentry work that started from the floor above.
Dean scoffs.  “Thanks, Sammy,” he says, lazily lifting his mug in cheers and swallows a large gulp.  “Could say the same about you.”
Abruptly, Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist in an awkward hug.  “I missed you,” he mumbled into Dean’s stomach.
But Castiel looked far from chastised, if not a little bored.  He lazily held his hands up to his shoulders and dribbled out an apology as insincere and scathing as ever.
To his misfortune, he could only manage to find a Chinese takeout menu in the kitchen, but it served the same purpose.
“But if all of the missing victims were in the factory, where else would the witch have wanted to send the next one?”
Scooting forward on his knees, Castiel teased the head of his slick cock against Dean’s rim just to watch him squirm impatiently in the sheets. He often wondered if Dean was like this with all his lovers or if it was something they shared together because Castiel knew for a fact he’d never felt this way with anyone else before Dean.  This addictive thrill of just... being present.  Being alive.
And then there was Dean.  Standing before him with that genuine look of concern, like he deserved that kind of affection from the young man at all.  And for what?  Providing him with the bare minimum in terms of human decency?
“No, I can’t say that I have.  My family didn’t own a television when I was a child.  Something about brainwashing, I can’t seem to remember the real reason.”
“What?”  Dean seemed caught off guard by the blatant redirection.  “No, she, uh, she’s in the bathroom.  Said she would meet me in here after.”
He swallowed his wine with an audible gulp and rested the glass down.  Turning his head, he gave her a weak smile.  “Yeah, course, Lis.  Things are going real swell for us.  No complaints here.”
They’d taken out a small vamps nest up in Ames, Iowa who’d thought they were the next Manson girls and made a hobby out of juicing kids for fun. It was a cut and dry thing: a milk run, really. Easy, bordering on stupid, but they saved the kids with little fanfare and now there were a few less vamps in party city masks running around loose in the world.  In the midst of it all, Dean came out of it in one piece, if not a little worse for wear, and Cas was virtually unscathed save for the new tatters and stains in his jeans.  If anything it just served to hammer the final nail in the coffin of Dean’s hunting career and the aches in his bones were in firm agreement.  It was time to hang it up and Dean, for one, couldn’t be more thrilled.  Afterall, he wasn’t getting any younger and Cas was human now; it was the best choice for everyone, but hell if he wasn’t grinning to himself.  He couldn’t really help it when he tossed a look over to Cas and found the other man was watching him serenely as the passing lights illuminated his worn out face.
“Sorry,” Dean muttered, his cheeks warming.  “Well, lucky for you, you get to see my ass practically every other day now,” he said, lips pulling into a thin smile.  “I dunno who you pissed off to deserve that.”
The words hung heavy in the air.  Castiel faltered where he stood, ground slipping.  “What do you mean?”
In case anyone was curious, I update the tags and characters as they come up in the story.  Since I am writing this by the chapter, I don't know far ahead of time what things will come up, but I will always tag them. I have tagged all appropriate tags for the latest chapter. Non-con touching/threats of rape.
At the end of one of their lectures, Dean even went so far as to drop his textbook on the floor.  Whether it was done with intent or not, remained a mystery, but upon bending over to retrieve it the sheer band of a lacy, black thong creeped well beyond the waist of his jeans.  Fingernails digging into the wood grain of the podium, it took every fiber in Castiel’s being to pretend that never happened.
Dean undid Castiel’s belt buckle easily, letting the leather straps hang loosely in their loops, and popped the button.  The whispering hiss of the zipper sounded in the air between them.
“You been listening to Hotel California out there again?”  Dean closed the oil with a snap and tossed it into his bag.  He zipped it and threw it under the table before turning back to face Ash.
“She’s old, Dean,”  Charlie always argued, like that made any difference.  “And she’s a horrible actress!”
“Ooo-kay.” Castiel rolled his eyes and went back to carving his initials into the lab table with his pocket knife.
Charlie was listening to something on Dean’s headphones.  Head bouncing along and clearly oblivious to the rest of the world.  What could he even say?  “Thank you” would imply it was acceptable for Dean to say it in the first place, but anything else would imply that Castiel wasn’t slowly becoming addicted to that rush of nervous energy he got whenever Dean was around at all.  Regardless, it wasn’t appropriate and he needed to tell him.  His lips parted, full of intention, but apparently Charlie’s song had ended abruptly and she was now handing Dean back his headphones, excitedly sharing her thoughts at a mile per minute.
“Nothin’,” he said with a shrug.  “She was the first person I came out to on campus way back when and you two spend a lot of time together.  I asked her about you not too long after the semester started.  Hate to break it to you, but I think the cat’s been out of the bag for a while now, man.”
So Castiel, gave it to him.  “No, Sam.  I think it best to do this alone.”  It probably wasn’t true, but no sense in having anyone else getting hurt.
When Castiel pulled away, Dean had that same look on his face.  Like Castiel apparated out of thin air to grant his every wish.  But before he could say anything meaningful back there was the distant jangling of keys and the front door of the apartment was clicking shut.
“Oh, I’m the one that owes an apology, is it?  Are you absolutely positive you’re not projecting?”  Balthazar was never good at discerning when his input was unnecessary and he really never knew when to stop talking.
Tugging his shirt back on over his head, Dean went over to the door to collect his bag and his denim jacket.
“Rowena,” Cas repeats in affirmation, scuffing his shoes on the cement floor.  “It’s a plan at least.”
“You’re not here to think,” Cas ground out and released him with a shove to the head. “Now, put it on.”
“I want to talk to you.”  Raising a hand, he pointed to the stairs.  “Outside,” he repeated, voice stern.
Dean managed to take it all in stride.  He swallowed what he could and continued drinking him through the aftershocks as Castiel opened his eyes to watch the rest.  Once he finally came down from it, Dean slowly slid his cock out of his shiny mouth with a wet pop, aching jaw hung open as he fought to catch his breath.
Dean looks around like any moment now Ashton Kutcher is going to jump out from under the bed or something.  This can't be real life.  More importantly, this can't be Cas.  Cas doesn't know how to be sexy -- not on purpose.  And god, Dean’s wanted this exact thing for longer than he could admit to himself, but just maybe it feels like they're skipping a few crucial steps?   Cas strips his tie out from his collar in one long pull and his hands move for the buttons of his shirt, deftly going through the row, before shrugging it off where it lands on the concrete next to his feet.
“Look, I know things are pretty messed up right now.  With Dad, and with- with me.  And I regret not being there for you all this time—“
Dean shook his head and let out a light, fake laugh.  “No, sorry, Charlie,” he said, bringing his own coffee to his lips.  It was too hot, so he blew the steam from it a few times.  “I kinda snapped at her in class earlier, just wanted to apologize.”
The descriptor did nothing to clue Dean in to the conversation they weren’t having.  “Uh… What about him?”
Dean was noticeably more alert now and after he replaced the glass on the nightstand he paused a moment then he was timidly nudging himself back under Castiel’s sleep-heavy arms.  Dean chanced a hesitant glance at him, green eyes glowing in the early morning light, almost as if he weren’t sure he was allowed to do this in the light of day.  Castiel sleepily draping an arm around his back encouraged him to relax into it.  “I, uh-- wasn’t really expectin’ you to be here when I woke up.”  His lower lip caught between his teeth.  “Glad you stayed.”
Dean exhales another exasperated breath.  He’s getting too old for this crap.  “It’s like the factory and the bunker animorphed in my mind or some shit, I dunno.  It just wasn’t right.  And then I found you guys in the basement digging around in a bunch of crap--”
“Got it.  No enjoyment necessary.”  Sam headed for the door and paused just shy of it when Dean started heading towards his bedroom.  “You should definitely shower first by the way.   You smell like shit,” he added before slipping out.
Dean swallowed one of his moans with another smothering kiss as Aaron gripped one hand on Dean’s rocking hips, the other trailing a line between the heat of their bare stomachs.  He was reaching, attempting to fiddle with the buckle of Dean’s belt.  And Dean let him, thinking how relieving it might feel to have a warm hand finally wrapped around his aching cock.  But he wasn’t prepared to see red the instant that warm hand gripped tight around his balls.
The three of them bantered between each other about the game and other stupid shit while Dean just sat and watched the party unfold.  Taking in the sounds.  Taking in the occasional sip from his flask and convincing himself he was still searching for his girlfriend of all people.  Maybe he was, but he was searching for something else too.
Balthazar released an overly dramatic sigh.  “Alright, if you insist.  I buzzed up to Mrs. Birdbrain and she got so excited at the prospect of a visitor she buzzed me in.”
Castiel tossed his head back and forth, weighing his words.  “I call it making the most of an unfortunate situation.”
Balthazar let out a sharp laugh and gripped onto the back of his jacket.  “No, we’re going to have fun tonight, I promise.  Just you wait!”
It worked, marginally, but Castiel wouldn’t allow himself to be so easily swayed.  “Dean.”  He meant it to be disapproving, but it came out sounding much the opposite, so Dean kept right on going, sucking wet circles along the ridge of his collarbone.  Castiel breathed in through his nose and released it past his lips with a wanting noise, but he cut it off himself.  He couldn't get hard again that fast anyway. Cradling Dean’s face in his hands, he lifted his chin and forced him to meet his eyes.  Castiel’s gaze was imploring.
“What’re you doin’ out here?”  Dean’s voice was thick with sleep and confusion as he rubbed at his eyes, trying to discern Castiel in the dark.
They joined hands around the table in a circle and Castiel recited the words of grace, to which they said in unison, “Amen.”  He adamantly ignored the notion that Dean’s hand lingered on his before he pulled it back into his lap.  Castiel served himself a modest portion, despite Lisa’s insistence he take more, and he told her “Everything looks delicious, Lisa,” as usual, while he tried to remember which was the dinner fork from the unnecessary line of silverware and cutlery.
When Castiel awoke the next morning, it was to an empty room.  He blinked hard to refocus his vision and looked to his right to see Dean’s bed was untouched from the night before.  He checked the alarm clock next to his bed and noted the time.  Just before 8am.  But it was Saturday and he didn’t have anywhere to be.
“He’s not wrong there.”  Balthazar was obviously very drunk.  His breath smelled like vodka when he reached to wrap his arms around Castiel’s neck.  “But you wouldn’t have me any other way, would you, Cassie?”  His voice was saccharine sweet, sickeningly so.
“We gotta find Meg then,” he said into the wind, still agitatedly rubbing at Castiel’s back to warm him up.  “Someone should bring him home at least-- be there for him when he wakes up.”  But when he turned to look at Lisa and Benny again everyone else had fled the scene, suddenly disinterested when it seemed like the junkie was actually going to make it.
“I made coffee,” he announces as he enters the room in the hopes his words would carry Dean into consciousness like they usually did.
Dawdling, Sam picked at his pancakes more than ate them.  “I didn’t want to go back,” he said, “I still don’t.  Whether you had let me stay with you or not, I just needed to get out of there and I wanted to feel like I was the one making the choice.  So I packed,” he finished with a lame shrug.   “I don’t know why we’re talking about me when you won’t even tell me about you.  You used to tell me about stuff all the time back home.”
The backs of his eyes feel like they are straining to keep his eyes in the sockets.  He could have swore he fell asleep at one point, but he honestly can’t remember if that was real or not.  It doesn’t feel like it; he doesn’t feel any better.  Either that, or the alarm clock blinking put him into some sort of trance.  With a heavy sigh, he sits up in the dark and scrubs over his face, rubbing at his sore eyes.  Normally in a situation like this, Dean would masturbate, but the idea of that is on the subtle verge of terrifying.
Each individual part of Damien was beautiful, including his face, but as if it were too perfect or too beautiful or too much of everything, Castiel couldn't piece it together.  It was like looking at the sun during an eclipse.
He’d cancelled his Figure Drawing lesson the previous day to entertain the notion of a personal day.  It seemed appropriate, all things considered.  To pay his respects to Moira Birdell.  What that really entailed was drinking copious quantities of chamomile tea and hiding under the covers.  But he didn’t sleep a wink.  He couldn’t, what with the weight of all the ignored calls from Anna on his cellphone and the old water stains long since bloomed and wilted above his head.  What was worse, the stack of papers remained untouched on his bedside table.  He couldn’t even force himself to work through them.
“What about you?”  The guy raised his eyebrows, signalling for Castiel to fill in the blanks, meanwhile his gaze roved lower to appraise Castiel in his one-size-too-small t-shirt.
The room swims lazily in and out of focus as he detects the silhouette of a man through the firelight.  On instinct, Dean fumbles for the shearing dagger he keeps in his trousers in some semblance of protection, but it’s nowhere to be found.
“You’ll text m--” Dean felt his legs shaking, but he could breathe fully again for the first time today.  “Awesome,” he exhaled, “You’re fucking awesome, Cas, you know that?”
Before they’d left the dorm room together, Dean managed to convince Castiel to change into one of his jackets and a t-shirt that was what Castiel considered a size too small.  A blue one.  It brought out his eyes, or so Dean had said, which was just another thing that Castiel forced himself to ignore about his roommate.  Right now though, he couldn’t really ignore the way his stomach was fluttering with the impish way Dean was smiling over at him.
Cas merely chuckled at him, deep and rough, before finally spreading Dean’s cheeks apart with his palms.  Dean watched then as a hot line of spit dangled over his hole and sucked in a sharp sound as Cas worked in the first finger.
Aaron was barely flipping through the pages while they half-heartedly attempted to discuss a few of the sculptures from the Sistine Chapel they'd reviewed in class earlier.  Dean hadn't missed the spark of indignation that flashed behind Castiel’s eyes when he'd seen the two of them together; it fanned Dean’s own flames.  That look was spurning him on even now.
“Oh, yeah. I’ll remember to save that for our next heart to heart,” he intoned. “Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me.” With a snort, Castiel sat up and reached for his backpack, unzipping it to reveal a nearly depleted bottle of Dean didn't even know what. He regarded the bottle warily, glass glinting in the silver light.
Her voice kept playing, but all Castiel heard was the faint buzzing of static from the television set.  He registered her staring again when her voice cut out.  That same familiar stare, the one that made him feel all the guilt he never felt at Dean’s, and he looked up from his lap to meet it.  With as much enthusiasm as he could muster, he smiled a watery smile at her.  The corners of his eyes prickled with moisture, but he wasn’t sure what this feeling was.
“What do you say?  What’s a little ménage à trois action between friends? I brought poppers,” he adds with a suggestive eyebrow waggle.
Setting his half-drunk tea down on the nightstand, Castiel slipped his warm hand down the front of his boxers and cupped himself with a relieved sigh.  These days it seemed as though Dean was never around; he figured he had all night.  He palmed himself loosely as he browsed, but nothing was catching his interest, he just didn’t want to contemplate on the ‘why’.  Laying there with his dick in his hand, his eyes inevitably wandered to Dean’s side of the room, and his mind wandered with it, supplying him with the image of Dean straining against the confines of a pair of small, pink, satin panties.  The thought surprised him, but it was a good path if his laboured breathing was any indication.  Yet as if by some demented sense of cosmic karma, the sound of the door being unlocked had him rushing to close the porn tab and switching back to his sappy rom-com with lightning speed.  When Dean waltzed in moments later, he was none the wiser.
If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say Chuck were on something, but he did know better, and he knew that Ellen would never allow that.  Maybe he might have had some trouble in the past that made him fidget so much.  Who was Dean to judge anyway?  So, he chose to ignore it.
Castiel stared back at him blankly and, for a moment, Dean was afraid he overstepped.  Was afraid he just blew whatever this whole thing was they had going on.  And he wasn’t going to lie, he was a big fan of whatever this whole thing was turning out to be so the prospect of it made him freeze.
Castiel’s fingers snaked around his forearm on primal instinct, but Dean’s pressure was unrelenting.  “Get the fuck off me,” he gritted out, “Or else—”
If he thought he could just cut himself into Dean’s life whenever and wherever it suited him, he had another thing coming.
After what felt like a lifetime, Dean softly spoke above the rumble. “I remember.”  He peered at Castiel out the corner of his eye, but maintained his sight line on the sea of dead grass ahead.
When the weekend came, Dean was preening himself in front of their floor length mirror for his date as Castiel was slumped over his desk working on a Comparative Literature essay. Castiel made it a point to turn his desk and chair away from Dean’s side of the room at the beginning of the semester to avoid, uh, distractions... But it didn’t help.  The scent of his fresh cologne was more of a distraction than the way his fingers were tugging at his hair.  His last roommate certainly wasn’t this big of a distraction, that was for sure.
The bartender came back with two very full glasses of beer, foam sloshing over the edge when he placed them on the bartop and as quickly as it had the bartender was there with a new rag wiping the counter off.
“Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.”  He pumped his thumb, cuing Castiel in that it was supposedly his turn to speak.
“Sammy,” John called, tinny and muffled as he held the phone away from his face.  “Sammy, c’mere for a second!”
Dean was watching him through drooping eyelids.  Amusement clear on his face.  "I know you, though,” he said, pointing a finger, “Your type. You're all the same."
And maybe Dean didn’t realize that Castiel kept hanging out in the library just to avoid facing him after.  Or maybe he just didn’t care that they were interrupting Castiel’s schedule, but he was feeling fed up and he didn’t know what to do about it.  He was willing to put up with it, just for the fact that Dean seemed content fucking instead of eating lunch or doing his coursework, but when he found himself in the dormitory basement sorting through his laundry, the last straw came in the form of a skimpy pair of pink, satin panties.
Sheepishly, he shrugged again and took another sip, mulling it over for an inordinately long time. So long Dean almost thought he forgot the question. “Cas,” he nudged him with the sole of his shoe to get his attention, “What’s weird?”
He gave an almost imperceptible nod, though his eyes were still pinched shut, and Castiel could barely hear him when he all but whispered, voice ragged against his ear, “I want you to fuck me.”
Mr. Adler gave them both a blank stare like he almost bought the bullshit story they were trying to weave, but instead he gave them a patronizing smile.  “I don’t care.  You’ve both earned yourselves a weeks detention.”
The clock hand on the other side of the room twitched and the intermittent ticking was starting to get under his skin a little bit.  He let his solid boot drop to the floor and grunted in the affirmative.  He knew where this conversation was headed, it wasn’t even the first time they’d had it, but he’d honestly rather dive headfirst off a cliff than participate in it again.
With a long huff, Sam sits down at the desk against the far wall.  He pulls out his cellphone and scrolls his recent contacts for the local sheriff’s office before hitting the ‘call’ button.  The sheriff doesn’t answer, only her secretary, so Sam leaves them a tip off about the bodies found in the basement of the factory.  A few nods and hums.  Some thank yous.  Once that’s taken care of, Sam hangs up, elbows on his knees, and scrubs his hands over his eyes.  He needs some more answers because nothing about this case is making sense yet, despite the fact it’s technically solved.
Sam looks as though he wants to put up an argument, but he inevitably caves with an overdramatic huff.  “Fine,” he says, getting back to his feet, “but I’m not just going to let this drop.  I still want to know what you saw so we can figure this out, but I guess we can figure it out once we get home.”
Later, when Dean returned to Table 4 to hand them the bill, Castiel and Professor Roche were already gone.  They left more than enough money sat on the table, though, practically tipping Dean the same amount as the bill.  Most servers would be ecstatic probably.  Jo would have been.  She would have came skipping into the kitchen shoving it in Dean’s face if she’d ever been tipped that much.  But taking the folded bills in his hand, Dean just felt cheap.  Like Castiel got one good look at Dean behind the curtain and suddenly he was the human tragedy again instead of some glorified piece of ass.  Neither option were particularly good, but one was certainly better than the other.  He didn’t want Castiel’s money.  He gave it back at the club for this exact reason and maybe another that Dean wasn’t allowing to come to the surface right now.  What did it matter anyway?  He was obviously taken.  But he had missed a couple shifts at the club over the weekend and he couldn’t afford not to take it, so as much as he hated himself for doing it, he pocketed the money and bit back the bitter taste staining the back of his throat.
Huh, straight to the point.  “Not interested.”  Dean makes to put his headphones back onto his ears when the door creaks open anyway: Sam standing there looking like a child waiting for permission.  If Dean didn't know better, he'd say Sam opened the door just to show off his puppy dog face.  Lifting his arm, “I said ‘no’, Sam.  No means no.”
“We’re at the end of the hall,” replies Jack.  When Sam sees the sight of Cas he stops in the doorway.  “He’s attempting to wake her up by entering her thoughts.  We tried everything else we could think of,” explains Jack.  Sam nods his acknowledgment and edges his way into the room, grimacing at the smell of decomposition surrounding them.  “We found the missing couple,” adds Jack, gesturing towards the window on the other side of the room.
The streetlights smeared across the windshield and the radio had been turned down low. Just a murmur to fill the peaceful quiet as they rolled on down the I-35 towards Lebanon.
Bringing his hands around to fumble with Dean’s belt buckle, Castiel brought his hungry mouth to Dean’s in some semblance of a kiss, panting against each other’s flushed skin, breathing the same humid air between their messy exchange of saliva.  Their fat tongues slid together as Castiel unzipped the fly of Dean’s khaki slacks and he sucked Castiel’s tongue into his own mouth.  He clutched at the hinge of Castiel’s stubbled jaw with both hands, not ready to stop kissing him yet, but Castiel pulled away.
Castiel eyed it and then Dean.  He thought of the ragged denim jacket Dean tended to wear to class and the steadily declining temperatures.  Also, somewhere in the back of his mind, the fact Balthazar had forced him to buy it despite all his protests tipped the scales.  Without further thought, he simply said, “Keep it.”
The pulsing sound of the music over the sound system and the thrum of the entering crowd above alerted Dean that he needed to pick up the pace.  He slid on the metallic gold, latex booty shorts and appraised himself in the mirror for a second, turning to get a glimpse from all sides.  He missed a spot shaving on the back of his thigh, but he looked good, for all intents and purposes.  Good enough to get one private dance on the books at least.  He could hear the emcee asking questions to the crowd over the loudspeaker trying to get them excited or whatever his job was.  They had booze and the prospect of practically naked men parading themselves around for their entertainment, how much more excited did they need to be?
“I am relaxed,” Cas snaps, though the tightness in his closed eyes begs to differ. His breathing is coming out in spurts.
Taking the first momentous bite of his mile-high sandwich, Dean groans as half of it falls out the ass end onto the table.  It earns him a disapproving glower from that dork Kevin in the corner and when Charlie pokes her head up from disentangling a mess of wires under the desk, the look on her face isn’t much different.
“Hey, so what ever happened with Aaron?  Seemed like you guys hit it off, but now…” asked Charlie, taking a breather to come down from her brain freeze.
“Dean,” he spoke, eyes pinching and fingers gripping tighter when Dean interpreted the action to mouth along the tendon in Castiel’s neck that was peaking above his clerical collar.  “Dean, we shouldn’t be here.”  His voice was wavering.  Unconvincing even to his own ears.
They'd been stuck on the train for almost twenty minutes already.  There was a hold up further down the line, or so the voice over the intercom said.  To make matters worse, they were apparently old enough to be offered seats by a small group of teenagers while they waited.  Because that made Castiel feel so much better about all of this.  Two old men sitting on a train, wearing low v-necks, supposedly high on completely different substances, and on their way to drink all of the above away.  Castiel found the whole scenario rather pathetic.
Charlie scowled, but she slowly closed her laptop anyway.  “Fine,” she conceded.  “But only because I love froyo more than you.”
Dean tried to keep his breathing even, unaffected, even if they both knew that much was a lie. The way the name sat on his tongue, taken in that tone, was enough to pull him out of his head and plant him firmly on the ground.
They sat like that in silence for a few minutes.  Castiel half-heartedly pretending to sketch a hand and Dean plucking at a loose string on his frayed jeans.  The simple action was almost shy, which was entirely dissimilar to what Castiel had come to understand as Dean in these few short weeks.  The awkwardness was smothering without the safety of a buffer.  Something was bound to break it.
Feeling his embarrassment radiate out to his ears, Dean straightens. “Oh.” He clears his throat then. “Sorry.”
Castiel thought maybe this was a form of punishment he simply didn't deserve.  Or it was a sign that he was meant to stay.  So without further adieu, he brought Dean the glass of water and set it down on the nightstand by the edge of the bed.
Tossing Castiel’s clothes at him, Dean waited for a good answer.  Castiel just didn’t have one for him.  His head was still reeling from emotional and hormonal whiplash, but he wanted to try this new thing out: transparency.  He’d heard good things about it.
“Just kind of embarrassing is all,” he offered, pathetically.  Seemed like a good enough excuse.  Aaron seemed to believe it anyway.
To his own surprise, Castiel found the corners of his lips lifting to match.  As Dean walked on ahead, Castiel stuck behind to grab a handful of sugar packets and the girl behind the counter smiled at him.
Castiel groaned again, but resolutely sat up to reach for his wine glass.  He took a few moments to savor the full-bodied taste of the wine before choosing where to begin.  Straight to the point probably worked best in this case.  “He confronted me during the museum trip and, for whatever reason, I decided to feign ignorance.”  Confrontation was never at the top of Castiel’s wheelhouse.  He could admit that to himself, at least.  If only he had cut straight to the point with Dean, then he would never have had to worry about this.
The Impala pulled up along the curb across the street from the Braeden residence.  It was a modest house, not too different from his own, with a porch and a fence and a yard.  The engine was idling almost as much as Dean was.  Idly, he tapped his thumb against the leather steering wheel and cleared his throat.
Dean lazily thumped his head against the wall and laughed.  "What I'm trying to do?  You don't know the first thing about me."
Dean blinks at her and scopes their surroundings.  “Uh, yeah, it’s the computer lab,” he says like it’s a no-brainer. “I need somewhere to do my homework and it has CAD.  Plus, you’re here. Win, win.”
After a dithering moment, Castiel slid his chair out from the desk with a treacherous screech and waited a few beats to see if it garnered any attention from ‘Marv’.  When it didn’t,  Castiel decided maybe whatever ‘Marv’ didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him.  Confidently, he flung his bag over his shoulder and strolled towards the door when Winchester peeled himself away from his book to shoot Castiel an insidious glare.
“Course,” Dean rasped, balling up a paper napkin in his fist.  He swallowed the last bite of his pizza, but he couldn’t help the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.  As it turned out, he wasn’t that hungry anymore.
“Well, this ‘music’ is awful.  And… Because a few girls wanted me to perform sexual acts with them and I… suppose I needed some air.”  He found himself taking another small, experimental sip from the bottle, just because it seemed like the appropriate thing to do, and he noted the way those green eyes lingered on his lips, now shining wet with beer.
Cas shoulders sagged as he took the seat across from him. “Please, don’t patronize me, Dean.  If you hate it I’d rather you just tell me.”
Out of instinct, his thumb tapped out of the messages and hovered over the call button.  He wanted comfort right about now and had no where to get it, so he hit call anyway because it would have to do, even if he couldn't tell him anything.
“Sounds like him, but he won’t find it.  I took it with me.”  Sam hooked a thumb over his shoulder where his backpack was hanging.  His very full backpack.
Dean chuckled as he walked down the bricked front path, keys jingling in his fist.  “Thought I told you to wait in the car.”
“I thoroughly enjoy your freckles,” he murmured as he cleaned his shoulders, and Dean could feel himself blushing.  Thankfully, Castiel couldn’t see it.  Carefully, he cleansed between Dean’s ass cheeks, gingerly brushing suds over his oversensitive hole as Dean tried not to wince.  “This whole side, really.”  And then he wrapped his hands around him to wash over Dean’s stomach. “This side is good too,” he added playfully, placing another lingering kiss to the side of Dean’s neck.  “You’re a work of art, Dean.”
Dean wades through the foggy mire of his mind for the ghost of understanding.  He remembers going to the wharf the night before and drinking his friend Benny under the table on a lark, but this- this wasn’t from inebriation.  He remembers the man at the saloon who’d been quicker with a dagger and the mental turmoil he’d been trying so desperately to erase with liquor before it fully dawned on him that perhaps he’s always had a death wish, only now, without Sam, there wasn’t any reason to fight it.
These were a few of the things Castiel felt as his eyelids opened slits in the dark.  The harsh dark surrounding him made it hard to see despite the light creeping through the cracked blinds.  For a moment he forgot where he was until the subtle smell of bar soap and clean skin tickled his nose.
“Oh, I almost forgot,” he said, an honest to God grin splitting his face now, as he made a dash towards the refrigerator.
Dean’s face slowly morphed into something soft around the edges.  Sympathetic.  He’d forgotten all about the holiday, if he were being honest, but the sight before him now was tugging on his heartstrings.  Nobody ever made him dinner before.
Following directions, Dean enters the third door on the left. It's a dusty, old store room, just like most of the underused rooms in the bunker. “Thanks, Magellan,” he says, clapping Cas on the shoulder with an added bicep squeeze, just because, but man, Cas feels firm.
Dean steeled himself, jaw muscles clenching as tight as his eyes.  “You called me,” he helpfully supplied through gritted teeth.
.  I think it was just wishful thinking on my part.”  That seemed like a far more rational explanation than the two of them sharing some kind of mutual hallucination.
think of this as a stripper 5k nestled ever so lovingly into a professor/student au. dubious consent only for the fact Castiel is under the influence.
It was dark.  The sky was pitch black and the moon was hidden behind the feathered clouds.  No stars in sight.  Outside, Crowley and Meg were waiting for him in that rusted-up, piece of shit car as the gravel crunched under the soles of his boots.
It didn't take long and were he sober he might have cared, but a few deft pulls, exchanged moans, carefully chosen affections, warm lips suckling his earlobe and he was pouring hot cum into the front of his boxers with a silent shout.  When he opened his eyes, he was greeted by the sight of Damien chasing his own ecstasy.  Shoulders slumping, eyes half-lidded, hips stuttering, and thick ropes of semen coating the front of Castiel’s jeans.
He ducked back in to grab the bag of change off the kitchen counter, but stilled upon seeing the greasy Jade Garden menu riddled with familiar scratched out scribbles.  Taking it in hand, the only legible piece of information he could discern through the scratched out ink was a cellphone number.  Dean snorted to himself as he considered the menu.
Castiel rounded the edge of the desk, pinning Dean in as he gripped the curved arms of his chair.  Dean’s even breathing faltered at the close proximity and Castiel’s equally challenging glare hovering over him.  Surprisingly, he lifted the chair with ease.
The community was quiet too and the rumbling growl of the Impala’s engine cut through the silence like a jagged knife.  As soon as he pulled up to the Novak’s old trailer home, he killed the engine and heaved a heavy, grounding breath.
Making his way over to plop himself down on the opposite side of the couch, Dean tried his best not to flinch when his ass made contact with the seat cushion.  Benny didn’t say anything about it so he hoped that meant he was in the clear at least.  They sat in relatively companionable silence save for Benny returning to noisily slurp the remaining sugar flavored milk from his bowl.
“We decided it might be a good idea to have a game night… we just were missing the games,” adds Sam, digging around with his head in the box.
“You know that's not her name.”  Her name was Mrs. Birdell and she just happened to be a little eccentric.  “That also doesn't explain why you're on top of me.”
Castiel awoke feeling like he'd been hit by a freight train.  His head was pounding; his eyes hurt; his chest was sore; and his knuckles were bruised.  Upon peeling his eyes open, he found himself curled up in his own bed in a sweat-drenched t-shirt and boxers with no recollection of how he got there.  Light crept in through the blinds making him squint and given the state he was in he wasn't entirely convinced that the freight theory was too far off.  The incessant ringing in his ears needled its way into his skull so much that the prospect of falling asleep again was near impossible.
“Yeah! Yeah, I just— Shit, hang on.” Dean sucks up the last of his drink, wiping the perspiration on his swim shorts, as he hastily shakes the sand from between his toes and slips on his sandals.
He was cut off by a fist punching him directly in the solar plexus.  The air left his lungs and he crashed against the lockers with another reverberating clang as the two buffoons pinned him in place.  Blinking hard, he shook his head to clear his vision and looked Michael squarely in one of his two faces, his own contorting with unconcealed rage.  “What the fuck was that for!”
.  Let me speak.”  Dean’s conflicted expression settled into a cautious glower as Castiel approached him and gently laid a hand upon his shoulder.  “I’ve had an embarrassingly large crush on you since the day you came walking through that door, I just never dreamed you’d be into someone like me so I did my best to keep it to myself.”
Dean stared at him trying to puzzle out what that meant for them when Cas was so obviously standing in front of him in the buff.  “Am I dreaming again?”  He desperately wondered aloud.  “Please, tell me this is real, Cas.  I’ve been praying to you for so friggin’ long, I can’t take it if it’s not.”
Dean’s body fell still, slumping his straining neck against the embroidered mattress.  Castiel waited a minute for movement, though there was none, and panic began to overtake him at the thought of anything happening to Dean down here in this dank basement.  Because of him.
“You’re just jealous Mrs. B makes me rice krispy treats on Fridays for being a ‘good little worker’, and all you ever get is gum under the table.”
“I ignore you all the time, you just don't realize it,” snarked Castiel, ignoring the question.  He didn't want to discuss it at all.  Especially not with Balthazar because despite claiming he was fine with the arrangement of ‘just friends’, he still acted jealous on occasion.  Besides, discussing it was the exact opposite of forgetting it.  Balthazar wasn't buying that, though.
“Distractions?  What distractions?”  Cas opens his mouth to evade the question, but Sam puts his foot down.  “No excuses this time.  If you have information, you have to share it, Cas!  We’re supposed to be in this together and now Dean’s in danger!”
Dean furrowed his brows.  He didn’t want to be reminded, but he could tell Ash meant every word, so he swallowed, throat clicking, and gave a lazy nod.  “Message received.  Now you wanna tell me why you knocked?”
The cage was so tight now it hurt. He didn’t care what came next; he’d do anything. Cas leaned down, tugging at the restraints around Dean’s thighs as he placed a savoring kiss to Dean’s lips. He found himself there and smiled before he straightened again. Kicking off the pants wrapped around his ankles, Cas eye’s danced over him.
“Yeah, but either way it’s your crap,” she countered, “So be proud of it!  Or I’ll have to be proud enough for the both of us and you probably don’t want that.”
Fuck, what were they doing?  He was about to open his mouth again and invite him inside, but the notion seemed to transfer all on its own, because without even uttering the thought, Castiel was coming through the doorway, crashing into Dean mouth first and throwing his hand back to close the door only as an afterthought.
Dean almost forgets to move, but once his brain catches up he's running his hands over any and all available skin, fully appreciating just how muscular Cas’ body really is under all those layers.  Abandoning Dean’s lips, Cas ghosts a hot breath across Dean’s stubbled jaw and pins Dean’s wrists above his head with one strong hand.  Tugging fingers snake through the short hairs on the top of his head to expose his neck as he works his mouth along Dean’s pulse point.
Cas hovers by the door of Dean’s room for a few moments, unwilling or unable to face Dean just on the off chance his condition has changed since the last time he was in there, but the silence is unsettling.  Reluctantly, he makes his way towards the edge of the bed, but he hesitates before deciding to sit down on it.  He can’t help but think how beautifully easy it had been for one fleeting moment the night before.  That alone should have tipped him off. Them and easy didn’t belong in the same sentence let alone the same room.
Dean nods as if that makes any semblance of sense to him.  He takes another drink to wash down the last one.  He frowns.  “But what about Meg? Or-or April? Or Daphne?  You helped me pick up chicks at the bar that time.”  Come to think of it, all of Cas’ exes were certifiable, stage five clingers, but apparently that isn’t going to be a problem anymore now that Cas is switching teams.
Charlie stumbled through the glass doors just then, fumbling around with a museum map as she pushed her squared, blue frames up her nose.  “There you are!  I’ve been wandering around this place for the last ten minutes!  I told you to wait outside the bathroom!”  She shoved the map back into her messenger bag before acknowledging that Castiel was seated next to Dean too.  “Oh hi, Professor Novak, didn’t see you there.”
Strong people didn’t need to.  The voice that kept telling  him that sounded suspiciously like his father’s.
He wanders down the corridor towards Sam’s room, but the bed is made and he's long been up.  He tries the kitchen next.  The only signs of life are the bread crumbs left on the table and the unwashed coffee mugs and cereal bowls in the sink.  Cas sighs.  Dean won't be happy when he finds those.  Making a mental note to clean the kitchen before Dean gets up, he exits the room and heads further towards the garage.  The sight of Sam’s large frame hunched over the trunk of the impala fills him with relief and concern.
Chapters 1,2, and 9 now have accompanying artwork. Ideally, I'm hoping to make art for each chapter. Xo
Castiel stayed later than usual, passing the time during his office hours grading the artwork from his Figure Drawing course.  The chiaroscuro assignment.  Of which, he ended up making copies of examples found in one of his drawing textbooks instead of using the drawing he had made.  He couldn't exactly hang up a drawing of Dean Winchester’s face, just on the odd chance Dean had a friend in the class.  Dean obviously made friends easily, so Castiel didn't doubt he would.  Castiel wasn't the best artist around either, but he was proficient enough that without reference the drawing was unmistakably Dean.  As were most things regarding Dean, he would later discover.
At his stubborn, resilient silence, she filled in the blanks for him.  “You told me you wanted to go to college.  You told me you wanted to get a degree in Astrophysics and become a scientist.  You can still do that.”
It didn't escape Castiel how unfair the dynamics of this situation were either.  He wasn't allowed to touch, but Damien could touch whatever he wanted.  Castiel only had so much to give while fully clothed anyway, but Damien found a weakness in his armor.  Castiel’s head met the back of the sofa when nimble hands met his zipper and slowly tugged it down just enough to reach inside.  Damien took him in his warm hand and languidly stroked, smearing precum around the head with his fingers while occasionally thumbing at the slit.  He was rubbing his own length through the lace and what Castiel would have paid for them to meet in the middle right then, he couldn't say.
“Well, then you have a problem with something else, but whatever you have a problem with it’s your own. I’ve had to hide parts of who I am for too long, Dean.  I’m not going to hide anymore.  I shouldn’t have to, especially not around you, and I’m not going to feel responsible for your feelings on this, so you either need to ‘stow your crap’ or, or—”
“Um, Art History, actually,” Castiel managed to say around swallowing his beer.  “Mostly Mediterranean sculpture.  And as it turns out, an intro course to Figure Drawing as well, due to unforeseen circumstances.”
There’s a pun in there somewhere and Dean wants to laugh at it, but he can’t.  His heart starts thumping against his ribs without his permission, but he resolves to keep his mouth closed.
“Yeah, I am.  No need to be a fucking dick about it.  Maybe if you pulled your head out of your ass for two seconds you’d realize I’m trying to fucking help you!”
Hedging his bets, Dean sidled up next to him as he noisily slurped on his wine.  He contemplated tapping him on the shoulder to get his attention, but his hands were full of hors d’oeuvres.  He decided to try to flirt instead.
Castiel just shrugged.  He didn't really care where they went, he was fine with just going out to dinner.  Food sounded good right about then and his stomach growled in agreement.  He was regretting not having eaten before all this.  “I don't know what you expect me to do about it.  We could always just try walking.  It's a nice night.”  It really was.  There was a slight breeze coming in off the water that only served to make him appreciate his jacket, but otherwise it was pleasant.
“I’m done talking tonight. I have an early shift at the coffee shop.” He backs away and starts down the hall before he stalls in his doorway one last time. “Good luck on your exam tomorrow,” he says, before his door slams shut.
Balthazar seemed to be considering the options, of which there weren't many, as he hummed into his mimosa.  “I suppose all you can really do is ignore it and hope it goes away.  According to you, you're quite good at that.”  Lifting his drink, he clinked their glasses together, looking all too pleased with himself per usual.  “Cheers.”
“So you don’t think less of me for it?”  He asked without thinking and braced himself for the answer, but Castiel didn’t have to think about it at all.
Dean furrows his brow and tries to remember what the ugly fucker looked like.  It had looked human enough, though all the best monsters do.  That is, until Cas blew its brains out.  That was actually kind of hot.  Dean doesn’t let his mind go down that path, but he knows he’s never seen whatever that thing was before.  “Not a djinn,” he affirms, “I don’t think… Actually, have no clue what it was.  Never seen it before in my life.  It was an ugly son of bitch though, once it showed itself.  Horny as hell too.”  Dean cringes at the thought.
Cas had come home earlier than he should’ve. He was still partially dressed in his business attire; dark suit pants and a half unbuttoned shirt. He’d run an errand after work, picking up brussel sprouts or some other green crap for dinner, or so he’d said on the phone, but Dean hadn’t been listening then; he was too busy. Dean had only been freed from chastity that morning after a week of punishment and maybe a part of him thought Cas kept coming home late this week to prolong that punishment further, but he couldn’t wait any longer to touch himself; he’d waited long enough. He couldn’t help it if Cas saw. He wanted him to see. The ropes binding his ankles to his thighs right now were warranted.
Balthazar shrugged.  A weird, jerky thing, like he was holding himself back, while simultaneously pressing himself to turn away.  Apparently, Balthazar meant what he said too.  “Just remember, come Monday morning, you asked for this, alright?  Because I don’t want any more pathetic updates about Winchester or your weird crush or how hopeless you are.”  He got a few feet down the alley, Castiel’s eyes wide and blank and searching, willing him to turn around again because if he didn’t have Balthazar as his friend then what did he even really have?
“It’s not about that!  Have you seen the way he looks at you in class?  Dude’s totally harboring a serious crush and, I mean, what’s the harm in it?”
“Not so much,” he replied, “Slow night.  Just wanted to see how you make the burgers so good, I guess.”
The only thing on his mind then was going after him, pinning him to the nearest surface, and ripping that jacket off of him the proper way, but he would never have the gall.  Besides, Dean wasn’t interested in him anymore if his lack of contact was anything to go by.  Maybe he really was lousy in bed just like Balthazar had said.  Castiel scoffed at the notion and then coughed to cover for the noise, subsequently dropping his phone on the carpet in the process.  A few students in the front were staring concernedly at him as he scrambled to get it underneath the table, face a few degrees warmer.
At the admission, Castiel surges forward to capture him in a delirious kiss, thrusting his tongue between slick lips. Forgetting himself fully, he coerces Dean towards the bed until he falls onto the mattress, nearly breathless.  Castiel’s cock is flushed full and red as he crawls over him.  He hovers there, littering soft, reverent kisses to Dean’s freckled skin and the delicacy of it is such a stark contrast to the brutality he craves, Dean lets out a choked sob.
Dean propped himself up on his elbows to watch as Castiel kicked his boots off onto the braided rug.  He struggled with his leather jacket before flinging it to some forgotten corner and then he reached for the hem of his dress shirt in an attempt to yank it off without having to undo any of the buttons.  Inevitably, it got stuck over his head.
Castiel inhaled a shuddering thing and deleted the message, pocketing the phone.  Erased like it never happened.  With an unsteady hand, he brought the tea to his lips and sipped to ground himself.  Afterall, he’d expected this call eventually.
Everything was verging on entirely too sterile, which Castiel appreciated, but it stood out enough for him to notice.  Glittering white floor tiles.  White walls.  Floor to ceiling glass.  Aesthetically industrial pipes running across the ceiling and down the walls.  The bar top wasn’t even sticky.
The urge to clean this place head-to-toe was overwhelming, but at least it smelled relatively clean.  Like Castiel’s cologne, warm and comforting, And… Suddenly, a powerful sneeze ripped through him.
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline, but he can’t really argue.  It was actually pretty good that time he tried it, even if he doesn’t usually like admitting when Cas is right.
“I’m going to stretch you so good you’ll be ruined for weeks,” Cas whispered in his ear. It was then the blunt head of a dildo started pressing in alongside him.
Though, the longer he laid there trying to distract himself from the dinner he never ate, the more it occurred to him how long he’d been neglecting his sexual appetite too.  It wasn’t like he was abstaining specifically because of Dean’s teasing.  It was more like, ever since meeting Dean, his mind inevitably wandered to his side of the room and seeing him touching himself the other night didn’t help matters any, only now he felt like he was crossing some invisible boundary.  It was normal to have a crush— that was what Charlie kept telling him anyway— but was it normal to jerk off thinking about your friend?  Probably not.  And yet, Castiel hovered between distractedly watching Netflix and an empty browser window daring him to go down the darker path.
“No, Dean.  It’s, um, it’s nothing like that,” Cas sighs, “You didn’t do anything wrong.  This is just me, trying to figure out how to articulate what I’m feeling and failing miserably.  I didn’t mean to make you anxious too.”
Leaning down over him, Castiel murmured next to his ear, “This isn’t going to happen if you don’t trust me, Dean,” he said it as if his dick wasn’t buried deep in Dean’s ass already.  “Do you understand?”  He nibbled on the lobe while he waited for an answer.
Just as Dean turned to head to the basement, his boss, Crowley, seemingly appeared out of thin air blocking the stairwell.  “I thought I heard your voice.  And what, pray tell, might I be eating?”
"Mr. Winchester," he acknowledged with a curt nod, resolutely staring at the chipped blue tile in front of him as he pulled himself out of his pants.
There were so many things he wanted to talk about with Dean that he didn’t know where to start, but he also knew he shouldn’t be talking to Dean about anything in actuality, and he sincerely doubted Dean wanted to hear anything that he had to say right now anyway.
Dean faltered at the deliberate obtuseness.  He looked almost affronted.  Knitting his brows together, he scoured the room, almost as if he were looking for whoever Castiel could possibly be referring to while Castiel tried to will them into existence.  Dean narrowed his stare briefly at Castiel’s perfectly stoic profile before releasing a singular, bitter laugh.  “Right, ok... my bad.  Musta been somebody else.”
The bathroom, he figured.  It was the only room he hadn’t checked.  “Who else would it be,” he called back as he made his way towards the bathroom.
“Yeah, like I said.  Busy.  Now c’mon, I’m fucking starving,” he said, stalking his way towards the cafeteria.
“Mmm, I might have an idea,” Castiel purred against his bobbing throat, “But I want to hear you say it.”
“Could… If that’s all I were doing.”  Crowley flicked his directional and made a turn.  “Need I remind you, you're still in high school then?”
Benny laughed outright at that.  “Yeah, right.  Surefire way to become single if I’ve ever heard it.”
They parted, Dean wanting answers, Sam gasping for air, but upon closer inspection the reason for Sam’s untimely presence in his life became abundantly, sickeningly clear.  The entirety of the left side of his face was a palette of reds, violets, and blues, some old and faded, some recent, hidden behind his overgrown mop of brown hair.  And once again the urge to hit something folded Dean in half.
He was grateful to work here no doubt, but the back alley was disgusting and he hated taking out the trash just as much as the rest of them.  Why not make the newbie do it? Of course the bins were overflowing too, but he figured while he was at it, he might as well check the bathrooms and behind the bar.  Two birds one stone.
The words tumbled out of Castiel’s mouth, blue eyes open wide like saucers reflecting the moonlight, as Dean’s face crumpled in on itself with rage.  Fishing around in his pocket, Castiel clutched onto his crucifix.
Dean would recognize that Zeppelin sweatshirt anywhere.  The one with the thumb holes and the broken zipper, and just the slightest bit of fraying around the edges.  Afterall, it used to be his.  It had the Icarus logo printed on the back, and for some odd reason he was seeing the back of Castiel instead of the front, but Dean would know him anywhere too.  He was crowding against the far wall like it was the only thing keeping him from blowing away in the breeze.
The door to the confessional closed.  With a rustling from the other side of the screen, the occupant sat and the weathered bench groaned under their weight as they shuffled to get comfortable.  They cleared their throat.  They took a deep breath.  After a few more, they finally choked out, “Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned,” in a mumbled rush of breath.
Steeling himself against it, Castiel snatched the phone back and contemplated, thumb hovering over the button.  Should he continue the message?  He could probably guess the rest.  He chewed the chapped skin on his lower lip until it tore, running his tongue along the prick of blood.
Castiel cast a furrowed glance to Dean as he shook himself off.  Dean was still watching him, though his eyes had markedly slid down to appraise Castiel's loose grip around his dick, sizing him up.
“Wherever the fuck I want,” Dean reproaches, but he doesn’t get further than a few feet before he determines the source of the oppressive stench.  He can’t tear his eyes away from the inelegant shape of a man draped over the settee in the corner.  He stumbles back, wide eyes unflinching, as his empty stomach threatens to revolt.  “Who the hell is that!?” he demands through another bout.
“Sure thing.”  Benny directed his attention back to his phone again, but didn’t immediately hit play.  Instead, he looked back up to Dean who was sliding his bare feet into a pair of ugly slip-on sandals.  As he was pocketing his phone and wallet, Benny said, “Hey, wait a minute... you said ‘fucked’.”
Dean didn’t, actually.  Not even a little.  “I couldn’t find a band-aid,” he stated with a noncommittal shrug and resumed washing.
!”  He emphasized it with a hard shove to Castiel’s shoulder and Castiel stumbled back.  “You're the one that latched onto me like a leech in the middle of Gallagher’s kitchen asking me for help!  So don't even go there either, you stupid jackass!”
Dean gently prodded the seam of Castiel’s lips for permission and Castiel opened for him with an appreciative hum, gently caressing his tongue over Dean’s to taste him again.  Morning breath didn’t seem so bad now and he smiled into the kiss when it seemed like Dean was doing the same.  The short hairs on the back of Dean’s head tickled between his fingers as Castiel laid a grounding hand to the nape of his neck.  There was no rush to it, and if it were left up to him, Castiel might have thought they’d all the time in the world to do this.
“Atmosphere, obviously.”  Dean gestured to the peeling wallpaper and string lights beside their booth and laughed.  “I really hope you’re not one of those guys that orders the side salad because the side salad here doesn’t exist.”
Dean was breathless when he came to a halt, hands falling to rest on his knees as he gulped in air, but Castiel kept right on running.
“You too, Bobby.  Uh, Dad’s in the garage.  Sam’s glued to his Gameboy, per usual.  Mom’s just finishing up the roast,” he explained, closing the door.  “I’d offered to help, but I was shooed away, so.”
Dean had with him his regular backpack with the addition of a smaller black duffle again.  He carried it with him to both Friday lectures thus far, so it must have been for work, and Castiel tried not to imagine the sorts of things contained within it.  To prevent his mind from conjuring up inappropriate illusions, he usually went with the safer alternative of deciding the bag was simply filled to the brim with glitter or dirty gym socks.  That was rational, right?  Completely believable.  He watched as Dean and Charlie exited the auditorium together, linking arms like school children on the playground.  The sight tugged at the corners of Castiel’s lips.
His hand snaked below his waistband, brushing his fingers down the trail of hair from his navel to the base of his cock, as his head dropped off to the side.  He planted wet kisses under Castiel’s ear, just above his shirt collar, and Castiel inclined his head to allow him access without even thinking about it.  “
Eventually when he snagged another dryer, Dean spent the rest of the wait biding time precariously perched in his seat to take the pressure off his ass and offhandedly watching the staticy television set hung in the corner.  He couldn't remember the last time he watched a TV that wasn't at this pisspoor laundromat.  The intermittent sounds of the afternoon news report crackled and hissed through the speakers.  The news anchor was droning on now about a local business getting shut down.  A Korean nail salon on the other side of town handing out happy endings on the side, apparently.
” he hummed the rest of the chorus and clapped his bound hands along, seemingly oblivious to Castiel’s question.  “Boy, I just love that song.  Don’t you?” He laughed at Castiel’s bemused expression.
“Hmmm. We can do whatever you want.  We could start with shower sex and then eat the leftover pie in the fridge.  Maybe watch a western film and consider which diner we should get breakfast at in the morning…” Cas’ hands edged towards the center, fingers dipping playfully into his crack to brush against his hole and Dean sucked in a sharp breath.  “Or we could just go to sleep,” he added just as he slyly pulled away, “you’ve had a very long day.”
“We’re going out.  I made reservations at that fancy French place downtown. So, you know... might be out late.”  His eyebrows raised suggestively, but Cas wasn’t totally sure what he was suggesting.
He wouldn’t actually learn any valuable lesson from spending an extra two hours sitting in a classroom and staring at a wall; Castiel did that enough during regular school hours to know.  Truth be told, he wasn’t even sure why he bothered showing up again. Theoretically, he was supposed to be doing his homework and reflecting on his actions, vowing to never fuck up again, but if that method worked he wouldn’t have gotten detention again in the first place.  But he was bored.  Spiritually, so.  No amount of consequences were going to change the fact he was a born fuck up, but there was only so many times he could flick a paper football into the wastebasket before it got old.
