“That was me.” He said apologetically. “I don’t mean to cause trouble at such a nice restaurant, but some of these foods are just too much for me.”
The merchant puffed up at this and strode over to the table, sitting across from Sherlock and pulling his girl into his lap. She freed a few coins from his pocket when he wasn't looking and gave Sherlock a wink.
“Yes.” John growled. He set it on the bedside table and crawled between the sheets, keeping himself between Sherlock and the doorway. Sherlock snuggled up to him, careful of his cuts, resting his head on John’s shoulder.
Greg blinked. “Did he…?” He was going to say some variation of “dump your deducing arse” but refrained.
John wandered around the park just outside the tent, ignoring the festivities around him and trying not to be nervous. It was the day of the final, and the remaining three‒Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and Sherlock‒were cooking their last bakes in the big white tent. All of the former contestants were here with a family member or two. The remaining competitors had their families here to greet them and John was trying to steer clear of the Holmes clan. Not that he knew what they looked like. He paused in front of some kind of ring toss game and stared blankly as a few children threw plastic hoops at bottles.
on his knees, staring up at him. He opened his mouth and took his hard cock into his hot wet mouth. Sherlock gasped and fell back against the mantle. The skin on his back screeched in pain but it only made him feel better. John was blowing him?! Doms didn’t blow their subs. It just didn’t happen—doms…oh…John swirled his tongue over the trembling head of his cock and flicked his tongue at the slit. Sherlock stared down at him as the man sucked and licked, rubbing his tongue over the sensitive shaft. Sherlock’s knees quivered and in a few seconds he was spilling into his dom’s mouth. He humped languidly into the pliant heat, reaching down to grasp John’s hair as every drop hit his tongue.
“You’re not an officer, you can’t serve a warrant.” Dimmock got up, smoothing his tie, trying to figure out the best course of action. “I’ll send officers to her house and we’ll check her workplace.”
“I’ll just, put these away.” John went to the bedroom as Mrs. Hudson made noises at Sherlock about the nose in the toaster oven. John opened the wardrobe and put Sherlock’s trousers away on the shelf. He grabbed a few rolled pairs of socks from the basket and pulled open the sock drawer—all color coded and arranged according to weight and material.
The doctor blinked and John patted him on the shoulder before following his sub into the hospital room.
“Get out of my head!” He growled. He ruffled his hands through his hair as if trying to scatter the memories.
“Well, we’d just shoved off and one of my crew, Bert over there,” he gestured with his hand behind himself at a gathered group of sailors, “seen a…a, lump of some kind floatin’ in the water. There’s all kinds of things floatin’ in the water, but this was different.”
“Owen Allsopp.” Lestrade read aloud. He glanced over the details on the card—birth date, card expiration date. “He’s a sub.”
The vertigo slowed, his stomach quieted, and he glanced up again. Everything stayed where it was supposed to. It's not that high and I've done it hundreds of times, he reasoned logically. Before he could think anymore about it he started climbing the trellis like a ladder, nimbly skimming up over the thick emerald vegetation, his feet automatically finding the same spots he'd discovered years ago. At the top of the trellis was a window that he'd unlocked earlier tonight and pushed ever so slightly open. Now he pulled the panel of clear mullioned glass all the way open and shimmied inside. This was the tricky part. There was no way to tell from the ground who was walking past the window. He'd once given a maid the fright of her life, crawling up through the leaves and landing on the carpeted corridor floor inside.
“That was so good. Are you alright, love? Let me see.” He slipped his hand under his chin and tilted Sherlock’s face towards his. His cheeks were damp with tears and his eyes were daubed pink, even as they were still black and wide and glassy. Oh yes, he was in subspace.
contact him again!” His thumb banged the ‘end’ button and then he threw the phone at the chair—it missed the cushion and bounced under the desk—and threw himself onto the sofa, curling up and facing away from the room. John stood in the sudden silence and smiled humorlessly at Sherlock’s back.
At John's silent signal, they fell into line and trotted through the brush of the forest to the curve in the road Bill had indicated. No one spoke. John didn't have to tell them to stay silent or risk blowing the whole operation. Jake and Peggy stowed their horses and crawled up the ridge, armed with knives and blades. John and Bill waited on either side of the road and the others moved up ahead. Stopping the carriage was the hardest part and if the people in it were armed, they had to act quickly.
Fifteen minutes later, pasta was boiling and the flat smelled of garlic and sizzling meat. Sherlock piled an armful of chemistry glassware behind the green chair and then carefully set his microscope beside it. John had despaired of his tidying methods but Sherlock didn’t see anything wrong with it. Mike and Betsy were going to be in the kitchen, after all, and they were hardly going to go poking around behind the chairs.
She immediately burst into tears and ran out the door. Growling, he fell back into bed and grizzled into his pillow. What was the point of fireplaces? What was the point of anything? He would never see John again and Jim, that odious little fuck, would continue to do horrible things to John‒
"‒can't you look at me at your surgery?" He blurted. "It'll go faster and we can go home faster and I don't want
The others had the grace to at least appear sympathetic. Seb on the other hand, asked, "did the horse toss you?"
“Oh, John!” Sherlock scrabbled at the sheets, lifting his arse and enjoying the feel of a warm familiar hand on his his bum as much as John enjoyed smacking him. When he was rosy red again, John smoothed lotion onto the skin. They weren’t speaking much at all, but somehow it was fine. John was able to lose himself in his domming in a way he often wished he could have with past subs—and it wasn’t even that difficult of a place to get to. Sherlock was willing and trusting, knowing that John wouldn’t do anything cruel or sudden to him.
"A king has many priorities, yes." Mycroft said, trying to shift the subject away from Jim's sick fixations. "Do you keep as close an eye over Hibern's economy as you do your pets in the herana? Are your people content? Fed? Employed?" Mycroft’s emotions were clouding his judgment. He reined himself in with a quiet, deep breath. Mycroft had seen the starving people and barren lands on route to the west coast. Farms were patchy and many homes ramshackle and run down. Roads were in disrepair and Gregory had reported sightings of bandits and thieves—likely Hibern’s infamous highwaymen gang—trailing their carriages. They’d stayed in the manor home of one of Jim’s lords. The poor man and his wife were on edge the whole time, terrified that they’d offend their King or his guest and be sent to the gallows. Mycroft had seen at once the lord’s threadbare waistcoat, the skillfully repaired holes in the lady’s dress.
of hands grabbing onto a body before Logan was ripped off of him. The knife clattered to the floor and John bashed Logan’s face into the table beside him with a loud crunching
Sherlock opened his eyes in the late afternoon, the light pale and soft on the curtains closed over his windows. His body
"I was." John said, leaning on the counter. The waiting room was crowded but no one looked up when they entered. The surgery had limited hours on Sunday, and the people who couldn't make evening appointments filled up Sundays. "Hi, Luann." He smiled at the nurse/receptionist decked out in cheery pink scrubs. She was clacking fast across the keyboard.
John clenched his hands into fists. He knew this would happen. He knew one of these meat heads would try something. He’d dealt with this all his life. He was small, he knew, and people were always testing him, thinking he was easy prey. Good thing he’d had a lot of practice putting idiots like Buck in their places. He thought it would take a few days at least for a confrontation. This was a relief.
John paused. He liked Molly and Greg, he did, but this was supposed to be just him and Sherlock, dammit. Molly, though kind as could be, wasn't known for her ability to gracefully pick up on social cues....like how John didn't actually want other people in the flat tonight.
John extended his hand with a smile. Sherlock finished with his phone and looked up at him. He gave John the once-over, his face devoid of emotion, before blinking languidly and looking back at the screen.
John gasped and humped up into his sub’s warm mouth and Sherlock slid his hands between his arse and the sofa, grabbing John’s bum and squeezing.
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock, I don’t even know the words I need to express how much I feel like a giant bastard right now.”
Sherlock glanced around the room. Everything was sleek and clean and furnished in such a way that was clearly designed to be as home-like as possible. Light woods and framed abstract paintings. Some kind of geometric wallpaper detail graced the walls and there was a padded rocking chair near the window. Sherlock would bet that the sofa folded out into a bed.
Sherlock’s neck was red with embarrassment. “Love y’too.” He muttered. John kissed his nose and reached up to touch and tug on the collar in a teasing way. “What do you want for breakfast?”
He shrugged. “A better outlook. Yeah.” He clasped his hands in his lap and stared at her. She was a switch like him. It suited her well in her profession. A dom’s pride might get in the way of opening up to a strange submissive, and a sub could possibly get intimidated by her. As a switch, that wouldn’t happen.
“Whenever you’re ready.” Greg murmured, turning the machine on. A little red light popped on. “If you need to take a break or anything, just say so.”
“Sherlock!” John snapped his Captain voice into place and his sub shot up into a sitting position, staring at him with wide eyes.
“What are you looking for?” John asked, sneaking a glance at Sherlock’s phone screen. They were on the Tube heading for Scotland Yard to see what Lestrade had to say about Coel, and Sherlock’d had his face to his phone for ten minutes, thumbing the screen as the train car rocked gently, racing along the tracks.
“Dunno.” He said. “Didn’t see.” He’d been in the corner of the baths, shaking off a panic attack, though he didn’t tell her that.
People were going in and out and beyond he could see a little gang of tents and colorful lights. The smell of roasted nuts, pine, and sugar was in the air and he licked his lips. A sign on the gate said "Christkindlmarkt" and John headed inside. As he approached, what was left of his anger dissipated in the warmth of the stalls and vendors. A small bonfire was burning bright and people were walking around with cups of steaming drinks and paper cones of nuts and popcorn. The vendors were selling sparkling ornaments, candles, trees, clocks, and other cheerful bits and bobs. There were carolers and even a guitar player, singing joyful holiday songs.
“I think you need some help staying still, Holmes.” John reached around and grabbed his hard cock and balls in his hand.
Sherlock watched him come into the room, his gaze landing on the new items in John’s hand. He blinked a few times and John crouched beside him, setting the cuffs and chain on the ground. Sherlock watched as John untied one of his shoes.
Sherlock called for food to be brought to the room and they spent the evening eating and chatting. Once the meal was finished (which Sherlock insisted John eat most of), they retreated to the bed, each man leaning against the headboard. John had a blanket draped around his bare shoulders and he felt much better being covered up.
“Nah.” Sherlock said. “We’ll be fine. Not much to do, really. Take some food and Jaffa cakes home.” They left 221 to a chorus of ‘thank you’ and ‘good night’ and when John closed the door behind them, it was pushing 1:30 in the morning.
They finished their food and paid and left, strolling up the pavement back towards the surgery. Sherlock was still talking—this time about an old case—and John slipped his hand into his. The detective faltered and glanced down, blinking at their hands.
"With you two in his life I'm sure he'll be fine." John said, putting the remains of the meal next to the sink. Betsy squeezed his good shoulder affectionately.
Sherlock nodded and leaned back on the headboard, looking up at John with adoring eyes. His knees were splayed apart and his cock was red and hard. The blush of pink on his bum matched his flushed neck and ears and he watched John put the paddle away in the box and take a little bottle of lube out before closing the lid. He opened and closed his mouth a few times to stretch his jaw, then rolled his sleeves up. He crawled onto the bed and Sherlock watched him with bright eyes.
“Certainly, sir.” The waiter took John’s order and left their menus at the table, probably for reference later on. “I’ll have the chef come out to speak with you.” He said.
The dom set another mug beside his own laptop. He unpacked the flowers and put them on the mantle, in the kitchen, wherever there was space. He locked the flat’s door and opened his gun safe, checking that there were bullets.
One of Sherlock’s eyes cracked open and he glanced at John, grinning at his dom’s awed face. He finished up the piece with a long slow pull of the bow and set it on the chair.
“Oh!” He stopped abruptly in front of the outstretched mug. “Thank you.” He took it and sipped. “Lovely. I got the sling and a real ice bag too. C’mere so I can put it on.”
John leaned over and took a sip from Sherlock’s tea mug. “I don’t believe that for a second.” He said fondly. “How’s your back?” He gently felt between Sherlock’s shoulder blades.
“Give me—give us a chance.” John said. He licked his lips. “I know you just left a bad dom and if it’s too soon, I get it, but…I think this is worth trying.”
“I’m afraid I can’t say. You’ll find out soon though. John.” She sounded amused and he looked out the window, stealing himself. It was exciting, in a giddy, odd, dangerous way. The man on the phone had mentioned Sherlock, so he wasn’t too freaked out….though given Sherlock’s line of work, he could have some seriously unsavory people in his past who would like nothing more than kidnap the detective’s dom. He wished he had the gun.
Sherlock didn’t say anything. He stood there in his his dressing gown looking like he was either about to cry or break everything in the flat. John nodded once and left, jogging down the stairs.
“Good boy.” He mumbled. Sherlock was staring down at a spot on his shoulder. “Let me undress you?” John asked.
As John said, “not a very good man.” Sherlock found he was completely fine with the fact that the man in his kitchen pulling a carton of beef lo mein out of the bag had murdered someone not three hours ago. Not just murdered someone, but killed the cabbie to
Sherlock looked up and drew himself to his full height. He took a breath. “I’m do not ‘play copper.’ I solve cases. That’s my livelihood, John.” His voice was stubborn and strong. “I take what I do seriously.”
“If you’re good and hold still for all this, I’ll talk to your doctor and work on getting you back to B. But only if you’re good.”
“Do you…” John rubbed Sherlock’s neck, staring at a spot on the ceiling as he thought, “want to kneel and settle?”
John stared. This had been the last thing he was expecting. He was expecting to be told to get on the bed and into some sort of creative position. Asking for help on an assassination attempt, well, that was a new one.
For the second time that night, it was John to the rescue. He smiled into the kiss and gently took Sherlock’s wrists, guiding his hands to his own hips before reaching to undo the buttons on the sub’s shirt. Hips, then. Sherlock squeezed, the denim of John’s jeans rough and warm, encouraged when the dom leaned back into the touch. He slid around and groped John’s arse and the doctor made a happy growly sound in his throat, breaking the kiss. “There y’go, love,” his voice was a gruff whisper as he mouthed down Sherlock’s neck, licking and nipping and breathing hot over his chest. It felt exquisite. Sherlock dropped his head back on the cushion, clutching John’s arse and staring at the ceiling, panting as his nipples were found and rubbed over. A huffy noise rasped out of his throat and John palmed his cock, making him gasp.
Sherlock glanced over, staring at John’s thick stiff cock. His own reared up a little higher and the dom’s pride swelled. It took Sherlock a long time to get erect, and he was pleased that just the mere sight of his cock was enough to get the detective’s body interested. John got up on the bed and wound the silky black ropes around his sub’s chest. He brushed his hands in long strokes over his smooth skin as he bound him up underneath his arms and criss crossing his sternum. He wound one end up around his neck, mimicking a collar and gulped at the sight of the dark band around his pale throat. He slipped two fingers underneath and gently tugged. “Alright? Not too tight?”
He looked up the trellis and vertigo tilted his vision crazily to the left. He blinked and looked down, staring at a pile of pebbles on the dirt and resting his hand on the wooden slats. His stomach flopped dangerously and he groaned low in his throat. A night of cheap alcohol, opium, and not much food would do this, he reasoned. Scaling the trellis in his current state was unwise. However, knocking on the front door would alert everyone to his presence. It was paramount that Mycroft not discover him in this state. He would lecture and shout and it would be so unbearably tedious.
“He also was saying how I wasn’t supposed to wake up. How next time he needed a stronger dose. ‘I don’t have the big one.’ He said that too. I don’t know what he was talking about. He was wearing these weird trousers.” Michael made a face. “They were plaid and bizarre—like the Norwegian Olympic curling team, kind of. But not colored.” He rubbed his face, careful of his hand. “I may have made that up too. I lost a lot of blood.”
…Sherlock peered up from his microscope when his phone chimed. John was across the display. His heart fluttered like a little butterfly in his chest and he picked it up, reading the message. Free tonight? He was. There were no cases on. Why did John want to come over? Maybe he wanted to kiss some more. He typed out:
“The point is,” Sherlock continued, “that Owen’s body is too recently dead, therefore, Ms. Olivier,” he waved his phone, “couldn’t have done it if she’s been in—” he glanced at the screen, “—New York for two months.”
Sherlock pouted, his lips pursing minutely as he thought over what John said. "I don't like rules imposed on me." He grumbled.
"Sherlock was hurt." John said to Sarah. He scraped his hand across his unwashed hair. "In a case. I want to x-ray him." His voice was touched with annoyance and Sherlock knew A Conversation was going to happen in the very near future.
John licked his lips. “You’re swollen and red, but there’s no blood. Did you have any bleeding yesterday, love?”
John lifted off his body and grabbed the rope. He wrapped it around his balls a few times, pulling them away from his cock. He then squeezed some lube onto two fingers and slid them right up his arse.
John eyed his bottom. It was a lush splotchy crimson and John was sure it felt as painful as it looked.
John walked into the room ten minutes later, sporting only the mildest limp. He was wearing fresh trousers and blue striped long-sleeved shirt and holding a duffel bag with an old comfy pair of sweats for Sherlock and one of his own black undershirts. He purposely had worn it and not washed it, knowing that Sherlock would enjoy wearing his clothes. A few tired lines were carved around his eyes.
“No.” Sherlock murmured. “And compared to how you type, five words a minute would be ‘clattering up a storm.’
"Perfectly fine. I was wrong to have let it escalate so. I apologize." He sipped and hummed in delight.
“Good.” Sherlock said. “Good lad.” He felt like an idiot, but John seemed to be responding. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
That night, at approximately three am, Sherlock was startled awake by a desperate keening cry. He blinked a few times and lifted his head, looking in the dark bedroom for the source of the sound. The windows were closed and everything looked fine at first glance. It happened again, to his right, and he knew instantly that John was having a nightmare. His dom was once again crying in his sleep, thrashing at the sheets. His face and neck were sparkling with sweat and Sherlock’s heart crumpled at the horrible, desperate sounds.
“Sh, sh. Hold still, good boy, hush.” John murmured nice things to him as he smoothed the cream over both cheeks, getting a generous amount on there. “Your bottom has taken a lot lately.” John noted, rubbing circles over the skin.
John was tossed into a dank, moldy cell and the door clanged shut behind him. The guards hauled the rest of his team past his cell, deeper into the dungeon. He met the eyes of each one of his team, trying to silently communicate to them to be brave and strong, that he had a plan. Bill Murray was last and John saw a resigned sort of hopeless bravery in his eyes. He'd been in the highwaymen nearly as long as John. He understood the severity of their situation. John had a horrible feeling he'd never see any of these people again. Bill nodded to him. John nodded back. Then he was gone. John listened as the guards hauled his people deep into the lock-up. A door squealed open, then banged shut, and then— silence.
“Some. Though the amnesiac effects of the drug worked well. The killer’s getting smarter.” Sherlock said. “What about the blood?”
“He looks stunning.” She said, glancing up at Sherlock admiring himself in the reflection of a display case. “You both seem so happy.”
Mike closed his office door and laughed, shaking his head. Prince Holmes was in love. He never thought he'd see the day.
“So what are you doing now? You've got some pretty young thing waiting for you at your flat?" Mike and John started walking again. Mike looked like he was on his way to work, if his suit and tie were any indication, but he didn’t seem to be in any hurry.
“BDSM provides a certain amount of leeway for someone who would want to abuse. A certain amount of coverage, if you will.”
Sherlock's heart sagged so low he thought he was going to fall through the floor. "Booked?" He asked.
He took a step forward, intending on walking through the door and buying a bag when the image of the other switch doctor from tonight swam in front of his mind's eye. What was his name again? Jack? No, John. John Watson. Sherlock had absolutely zero interest, but there was a pleasing softness about his eyes and mouth that a tiny part of the detective didn't find unappealing. He was military though. That meant when he did dom, he was probably utterly insufferable, a hopped up shouty drill sergeant type. No doubt John was a rude bastard in the bedroom too. Probably got off on making his subs do pushups. He shoved the images of his friends away and went into the building, knowing that he would hate himself in the morning but not caring at all right now.
John gradually relaxed as the stream of facts stamped out his panic and he gradually, horribly realized where he was and what he was doing.
“There we are.” John pulled it out, carefully. “Nice and loose for me now.” He unzipped and pushed his jeans down and Sherlock blinked when his dom grabbed his hips and eased his slick cock into his bum. John groaned in pleasure but Sherlock chewed on the rubber ball in his mouth. He own cock was flaccid and uninterested. He wasn’t getting anywhere near subspace and he found himself distracted. John’s cock inside of him felt intrusive and big and his arms were starting to get stiff. John hummed in pleasure and humped into him, then reached around and found his nipples. “Alright, love?” He asked.
They heard a cough and stepped apart like teens caught making out between classes. John’s face flamed up pink and Sherlock beamed at Nina.
“Mm, hello.” Sherlock continued to look at his wall and John went into the kitchen, stood there for a moment, then poured water into the kettle. He was making tea. Good. Sherlock wanted tea but was too lazy to go over there and make some himself.
Sherlock passed it over and John dripped some of the clear oil into the water. The scent of sandalwood and something spicy and floral filled the air and John soaped up the cloth, rubbing it up Sherlock’s arms and down his chest.
"Nah. This is a 'thank you' breakfast. Sit." John pointed at the table with the spatula and Greg obeyed, settling down and enjoying his coffee. "Does this bother you?" John asked suddenly. "Him kneeling on your floor?"
“Because Seb is an idiot. Look, I’ve been in a lot of, well, a few relationships, and I know how messy things can get. You said yourself we had just started dating when he began to text you and you didn’t want me to leave. Hell, I wouldn’t have told me either if I was in your position.”
Nina stepped in. “Most of our collars can be customized. If you’d like two colors, that would certainly be an option.”
“Really?” John looked surprised. “I’ll go with you.” He put his napkin on the table and started to stand.
“That doesn’t mean he wasn’t given anything.” Sherlock memorized the contents of the sheet and gave it back to Molly.
Sherlock shrugged, sifting through trousers. “I’m a naughty student. You’re Headmaster Watson. Punish me for some ridiculous transgression.”
"Christmas Vacation." John said, finishing his eggnog. "You know, Clark tries to have the perfect Christmas and fails at every turn." He watched the movie every season. He and Harry could quote entire chunks of it back and forth to each other.
The tarts came out and each baker carried theirs up to the front of the tent and placed their creations behind their pictures. Some looked good. Others…not so much. An older lady named Elizabeth Hudson placed a beautiful tart that looked prettier than a picture. She was stationed near the front of the tent and John decided she'd be competition. She seemed friendly and warm though, and she reminded John a bit of his grandmother.
“April.” Logan tightened his fist around the knife handle. “They took me out of the will. They took our cabin. Now I’m taking you.”
“Would you rather be dismissed?” Sherlock’s tone was neutral. "If you'd prefer the herana, you can go.”
"‒Wait." Sherlock said. He looked up at his dom. "I want to shower first. I imagine you do to. Let's go home and then you can finish."
“What do you want, Seb?” Sherlock hissed, stepping into his space. He would have never spoken like that or made such a threatening gesture when they were dating.
John slid his foot forward under the table, nudging it up against Sherlock’s. The detective responded, nudging his toe along the ground until their legs were brushing, the heat between them a bright distraction that was slowly driving John insane.
"You." The bald woman poked John's arm. "Don’t you dare try anything funny or you'll wish you'd never been born."
Sherlock was curled on top of the covers, hugging Greg's pillow. His trousers had been tossed on the floor and he'd brought his bare knees towards his chest. He was already almost asleep.
, he reminded himself. It was possible he needed to get more blatant. Doms liked when their subs were needy, and John was certainly no exception.
A laugh shot out of Sally’s mouth, but she quickly sobered when she saw neither John nor Sherlock laughing. “Is he serious?” She said to John. “What, did you lose a bet?”
"Go." Sherlock stopped the mixer and took the bowl back, dripping more of something into it. John went to the fridge and grabbed his basil and two cheeses.
Jim did. John bit his own forearm to stop himself from screaming. He grunted, hoarse and raw into his skin as Jim pulled back and shoved forward. It felt like he was being split in half. He was grateful for the medicine he took but it did little to mitigate Jim’s anger. He fucked John hard into the floor, slamming him fast. Jim’s fingers dug into his hip and thigh, holding him in place. Jim grunted and groaned and John wanted to vomit when he spilled deep inside his body.
“Fine.” Sherlock went back down the hall to get washed and dressed and John stared moodily back at his screen. He had sort of hoped Sherlock would insist on staying with him, but John was hardly going to beg. He wanted to keep what little pride he had left.
Gregory Lestrade was on his way home from work. He was in his own vehicle, which was rare, but it had needed some work done and he’d taken the Tube to the mechanic’s after his shift. He’d forgotten how awful London traffic was. His preferred route was congested as hell, so he’d decided to take a few less direct roads to avoid time in traffic. It was nearing the end of the rush, so hopefully he could get to his flat at a semi decent hour. He was cooking dinner for Molly Hooper tonight as a sort of semi-date thing and he wanted everything at his flat to be perfect. He sipped his coffee, hot and delicious and decaf.
"Come on, up now." Lestrade's voice was gruff, his 'commanding' tone that he used with submissive witnesses to put them at ease and get them to open up. Sherlock gingerly got to his feet and Greg steadied him with a hand on his shoulder. Sherlock's suit coat was ripped on the left side, the fine fabric coated with bits of debris. The grey shirt underneath was intact but marred and scratched. Greg could see dark spots of blood staining the cloth.
“Come with me.” John pulled him into the bedroom and untied his gown. “Take that off. Get on your knees.”
“Two tours in Afghanistan, med school, and years spent as a full-time emergency doctor?” He patted his hip. “I think I can handle
had been…interesting. Definitely a journal entry. Sherlock had been fine inside with Coel, even bordering on the more dominant edge of his submission as he maintained control of the situation. But John storming inside and slamming Coel around, his red hot anger and boiling blood had dropped Sherlock’s control in an instant and made him tremble. He crouched down, hugging himself. What he really wanted was to roll onto his back and show his belly. He’d upset his dom, and his natural submission was roaring loud, telling him to do whatever John wanted. He’d let the man fuck him right here in the street and then piss all over him if that’s what he demanded.
"Yes." John turned to him. "I want to get your collar on you." He stepped closer and gave him a kiss on the stubbly jaw. He ran his arm up and down Sherlock's and licked his lips. "Get your leash on you. Remind you of who you belong to."
A bubbly girl named Molly was beside John and she was chatting enthusiastically about a strawberry chocolate something or other she was making. John liked her. She seemed kind. Greg, stationed in front of her and directly across the main aisle from Sherlock, was listening and nodding as he cracked eggs and whisked them up. He smiled a lot and John nodded to himself, pleased with his neighbors. Sherlock went to the refrigerator that they shared and John peered up, admiring his lovely profile and they way the lush dark curls on his head bobbed and bounced. He pushed the thoughts away and focused on zesting his lime rinds, listening as Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry wandered over and spoke to Sherlock about himself and what he was making (an apple and strawberry tart). Apparently the man was a chemist and was hoping to one day run his own baking business from home.
Sally Donovan, soldier of the royal guard, crouched before him and put a hand on his shoulder. He saw the single shot pistol nestled in a hard leather holster on her belt. A wicked silver dagger was sheathed just in front of it. A hard red leather chest plate was buckled around her torso and she smelled like gun oil and hide as she drew nearer to him.
on the floor and he swore at it, reaching blindly under the bed until he found it. 8:04 am. The light was grey and cold through the curtains and John looked at the empty space on the mattress the detective usually occupied. It was colder without his sub. The sheets seemed to have a gritty texture to them, bland and industrial. When Sherlock was here they were soft and sumptuous, warm and inviting. John sat up, resting his bare feet on the icy floor. The chill shocked him into wakefulness and he tried to pile his thoughts in order. That had been a bad one. It was short, as nightmares tended to go, but it was always Walker. Soldiers and civilians had lived and died under his hands, but his subconscious liked to dwell on the sandy-haired young medic. Maybe because he was there when John was shot. Maybe because John had been completely unable to save him. He knew there was nothing he could have done. Sholto had convinced him of that and Ella had confirmed it. But still, he couldn’t help the grain of guilt that still irritated, an itch forever under his skin.
John paced in his cell. It was tiny. There was a bucket in the corner that stank horribly. A torch in the wall outside the cell flickered and crackled and gave off an oily smell and weak light. His jaw and hands were aching badly and he wished they'd have unbound him before throwing him in here.
John grinned. Sherlock hardly used pet names and it was adorable when he did. The faintest edge of submission crept in on John’s consciousness, interested in the kneeling and the sucking, and he allowed it to linger. Sherlock was willing to ‘dom’ now and then and John wanted to prove to Sherlock that they could both be satisfied with that. Sherlock was his, tonight and tomorrow and every single day. The detective gave a shallow thrust and John pushed further into his arse, nudging his prostate again. Sherlock panted, rolling his hips faster and faster until he was good and hard and ready to spill. John slipped out of his bottom and stood up, wiping his hand over his mouth. He loved Sherlock more than life itself, but giving blowjobs was not his favorite activity. The expression of bright lust in his boy’s eyes was enough to make it worth it though.
The phone beeped again. Another text from Mycroft containing an address for a house just up the road. John bit the inside of his cheek and slid his phone into his pocket. He strode out into the foyer and grabbed his jacket.
The doorbell rang downstairs for the fifth time in an hour. John heard the faint tinkle of Mrs. Hudson's laughter as she opened the door and greeted her friend.
"I already do." John teased. Sherlock stared at him for a moment and John blinked. Uh oh. That might have been too much. Sherlock bit his lip and looked away, his face pink and his mouth smiling. John, feeling both smug and giddy, read his recipe again. He'd brought out enough yeast for about four loaves of bread, figuring that in case three loaves went wrong he still had a fourth to fall back on.
The doctor grinned and slid his tongue over to the other side, laving that one. He squeezed Sherlock’s waist and dipped his hands lower, caressing his bottom with one hand and cupping his crotch with the other as he bit the skin and licked it hard. Sherlock shivered. His cock woke up more. John thumbed his balls and swirled his tongue around the nipple, making Sherlock squeal.
"Yes." John reached into his bag and pulled out a little bundle of thick dark green leaves veined with purple. He gave her two of the leaves, each one half the size of his palm. "Chew one leaf until you taste the bitter juices. Swallow the juice but
“You’re going to feel like a tit once you come out of this.” Sherlock told him. John stood there breathing hard, riled from both Greg’s and Mycroft’s presences today in their flat.
He sank down onto his green chair, stricken with grief even though John was fine and very much alive in the loo not thirty feet away. Was this at all how that distraught sub at the crime scene a few weeks ago had felt, seeing her dom dead on the floor? The image of John, dead, tied to a chair with an iron spear piercing his bleeding chest and his dark eyes lifeless and cold made Sherlock pop to his feet again and pace for the loo. Subs didn’t go in Defense the way doms did, but Sherlock felt the overwhelming dark urge to hunt Shan down and kill her slowly and painfully. No one hurt his dom.
I apologize for the long delay with this chapter. Been having computer issues. TW in this chapter for discussion of abortion and medical exams.
He walked in and turned on the light beside the bed. Sherlock strolled in after him and stood in the doorway, glancing around and taking it all in. “Not much, I know.” John told him. He went to the fridge, almost afraid at what he’d find growing in there.
That was definitely the wrong thing to say. Hissing and spitting, Jamie leaped at him, pinning him to the floor face down with a knee in his back. It was tempting as hell to fight back, but a dom in Defense was a force to be reckoned with. There was a story in the news just last month about a petite 5’3” Chinese dom who had gone into Defense when her sub was sent to Iraq. She’d put a burly Uni-aged rugby player in hospital before the police managed to subdue her. From a scientific standpoint, the biology of Defense was fascinating, but not so much at this moment. No, fighting back would just make Jamie see him as more of a threat.
The cameras were getting every second and John vaguely wondered where the medic had gone. The loo, maybe? He should have been up here by now. Another, more cynical thought popped into his head.
John slowly raised his hands in the air and stamped down his body's desire to quake. Peggy's body was sprawled awkwardly on the dirt at unnatural angles. Her face was turned away and her red hair fanned out behind her head. Two guards grabbed John and wrenched his arms behind him hard. John bit back a groan as his bad shoulder twisted. He gulped and he took a deep breath, his insides jumping around in fear. He couldn't show that he was afraid. His people needed him to be brave.
Sally came up to him then, looking to be at the end of her patience. “She doesn’t know anything either. We’ve got nothing else to go on.” Sally said. “No prints on the limbs of the first victim, and Owen’s corpse was most certainly too bloated to retain any usable evidence.” She left the shop in a huff and John watched her go.
He may as well have not even been speaking. He had his gun drawn and glanced frantically between John and Sherlock. If he went near the sub to help, John would probably attack. But if he did nothing, John would probably kill Logan.
collar for him to wear all the time would be amazing. He’d have it on at crime scenes under that posh scarf. When he was in Bart’s lab at the microscope it would peek out under his shirt. Everyone would see it and everyone would know who put it there. He would love nothing more.
John's face must have shown his sad disappointment like a beacon, because Molly let out a little gasp. "There was some emergency back at their palace. Some visitors or something are showing up suddenly and Myc—er, the King sent Sherlock back to meet with them. It was really last minute."
John stood still and tried to stay composed and mentally prepare himself for a long and unpleasant night. He was still remembering two lords from three nights ago, fucking him from both ends. He shifted on the cold stone floor and pushed the thoughts away. Not now. Not ever.
“I told you that this,” he held it up, “would be for the worst offenses. What happened tonight was a bad offense.”
“Thank you.” He said quietly. It was small, and John had seemed to get it with relative ease, but no one had ever given him a more perfect gift. Not since his grandmother had brought them a red furry puppy one year for Christmas when he was very young. Seb certainly hadn’t encouraged his experiments much, getting him expensive tie pins and cuff links instead. He didn’t even wear tie pins. He and Mycroft didn’t usually exchange gifts. He admitted to himself that he was moved with something very close to emotion.
did this?! You can’t just chuck people into the road! What the hell are you thinking? You’re a doctor for fuck’s sake!”
“Put that on your elbow.” John dropped the carrots on the table. Sherlock wrapped them in a paper towel and held it to his arm as behind him, the kettle bubbled and John found a mug in the drainer. It was weird to have someone else in his flat, in his space, doing something as mundane as making tea. He didn’t have much company, save Mike, clients, and unwanted visits from Mycroft.
The chair scraped the floor in the kitchen and Sherlock, decked out in his usual loafing-around-the-flat attire of pajamas and dressing gown, appeared in the room and stared at the screen, brow furrowed as if identifying clues on a case. John rolled his eyes. "C'mere and sit." He patted the sofa cushion. "Grab the blanket and let's cuddle."
Silence filled the kitchen. Sherlock was scowling at John's knees and rubbing the back of his head awkwardly. Lestrade paused mid-chew, glancing between them both. John sighed.
John had given out countless spankings with this paddle and had endured a few himself. He wasn’t going to make Sherlock cry though—only a few swats would make even the most stubborn sub respectful and sorry. This was only a taste.
"Hey, stranger." John approached the extremely handsome man at the bar. "Can I buy you another?" He nodded at the glass, nearly empty of the amber beer he'd been drinking.
The day after Jim’s attack, John limped into one of Chilgrave’s many parlors, taking care not to upset his tray holding a gold and white steaming teapot, two matching cups and saucers, a little glass jug of milk, and a bowl of sugar with a silver spoon dipped in. Everything hurt: his thighs, his arse, his face, and his very soul. He stepped deliberately and slowly, taking care not to upset anything on the tray. He didn't even want to imagine what Moriarty would do if he spilled the tea everywhere. There wasn't much else he could take.
John licked his lips. Oh boy, they were going to have sex—penetrative sex. He’d wondered now and then about bringing it up to his sub, but he was honestly happy with where their relationship was now. One day in the future he knew he’d like to fuck his submissive, but the tying and the spanking and the fingering and all the rest of it was pretty great too. He grabbed the lubricant from the side table and clambered onto the bed, leaning over him and delighting in the way Sherlock shivered.
Sherlock looked down at his cock, running fingers over the knot work. He couldn’t stop staring. The dark rope looked fantastic against his pink cock and he walked around the bedroom, feeling the soft rope around his hips. He could just barely feel it on his back and belly and he smiled. He crouched. It pulled at bit on his bum but it was fine. He stood up and touched his front again. “It’s good.” He said.
Mycroft stared at him and Sherlock smiled. "Nothing of note happened. No one tried to invade. No one tried to kill anyone. Sherrinford still stands.”
When the bag was empty and everything was folded or draped or put in the basket, John opened a side pocket outside the bag and pulled out a little clay tub containing a hard chunk of what looked like clear green stone. Wondering what it was, John put it on the desk.
He and Sherlock left and John promised himself he'd start reading tonight. He wasn't one of those super-reader people who could read a whole book in a sitting. He needed all the time he could get.
“Stand under the water.” Sherlock said, turning the temperature up a bit. He rubbed the soap over his own skin.
Sherlock thought of John slamming Coel up against the wall. Seb flying into traffic was an image he wasn’t likely to forget anytime soon.
Dimmock stared at him for a moment. “Doms go into Defense if the emotional bond between them and their sub is extremely strong. Haven’t you ever taken a basic biology course? It’s—”
Sherlock obeyed, picking a folded blanket up by the corner and dragging it to the sofa. He curled up, leaning into John's side. They arranged the thick sherpa throw over themselves and John put his arm around Sherlock's shoulders. They watched the various bickering family members and minor disasters and by the time cousin Eddie showed up, Sherlock had snickered three times and nuzzled into John's neck twice.
She spoke so matter of factly, like any of this was normal. John licked his lips, suddenly feeling exhausted. He had so many more questions but lacked the strength to ask them.
He set his quill down and mentally shifted into Healer Mode. Rain lashed the window above the desk and thunder rumbled far off over the Iron Sea. People could get into all sorts of pickles on nights like these. He opened the door, expecting the worst.
"Of course I'm here." He said after a moment. He returned her hug quickly and they pulled apart. "Why wouldn't I be? I'm still on sick leave."
"You were young when you had your accident." Sherlock said. John startled, nearly dropping the pair of brown boots he now held.
“Excellent, Mr. Holmes.” The nurse wrote something on the chart. “If you or Doctor Watson get hungry at any point, don’t hesitate to ring the kitchen. You don’t have any diet restrictions and they operate twenty four hours.”
“I doubt it.” Mike snorted. “He can barely be arsed to come to dinner when I invite him. I can’t see him subbing for a certified stranger in a doctor’s office. You worried about him?”
An employee appeared from a back room and spied them giggling over the case. She wandered over. “Do you two need help?” She was short and curvy and her smile was friendly. Her short hair was a warm bright pink. Her gold name tag read ‘Nina.’
John wandered into the room and looked everything over. Gory photos of the dead subs, what was left of them, anyway, caught his eye and he frowned. It was just too easy for that pale, ragged skin to be Sherlock. He clenched his fist and looked at the jotted words: knives, dismembered, decayed. Instantly he was in a bad mood. He turned away from the wall and went back to the kitchen, slamming cabinet doors and banging dishes together.
“Yes you do. You’re getting punished and that’s final. Come on, now.” John turned and went back to the box, picking it up and setting it on the desk. He rooted around and took out two cuffs and a short length of chain with a clip on each end. “Get your clothes off. All of them.” John snapped out. Sherlock did, stripping out of his coat. His shirt and trousers followed and he was soon naked. His whole body was flushed and warm with arousal and excitement zinged through his stomach. Surely John could see it and even smell it, but the dom paid it no mind. He patted his thigh and Sherlock came to him, allowing his wrists to be cuffed and clipped together in front. He could barely move them apart.
“John?” He mumbled. He stared down at his dom, then looked blearily around the flat. It was like the world had been tilted very slightly on it’s side. He was seeing the sofa and table and loud wallpaper, but nothing was registering in his brain as being anything familiar. It was bizarre to hear the silence in his own brain, like it had been put in sleep mode.
He sniffed the length of the dark wood shaft. His nostrils flared and he examined the wood grain, scraping a bit of dirt off with his gloved thumb. Oak. He delicately traced his thumb over the soft fletching, eying the black variegation in the brown veins. Pheasant. Common. The tip was the most interesting part of the arrow. Stone, or possibly very hard wood. It was shiny and was coated in some kind of resin or sap. Poison? It was fixed tight to the oak shaft.
“Yes.” Lestrade shuffled the papers together into some semblance of order and turned into his office, shoving aside a half donut on a foam plate to make room for the new papers.
After that, Sherlock spent more time in the infirmary. He liked to sit in the corner near the crackling brazier, reading the stacks of textbooks in Mike’s library. Between the medical books and the violin lessons he started that year, he was rarely so bored. He did, however, continue to suffer from an overabundance of nerves and anxiety.
John strode to the window and looked down at the pavement. “Lestrade.” He said. An alarm bell went off in his head. First Mycroft intruded and now Lestrade? What was with these damn doms coming onto their territory? John heard Mrs. Hudson’s voice, then Lestrade was coming in downstairs.
They walked hand-in-hand up the wide corridor, under cheerful, stately decorations to settle in for a long cuddly night.
"Measuring out my circles…" He drew one onto the paper. "It's a bit obsessive, but they need to be the same size."
. I was captured by an arsehole, I lost my whole team," his voice broke but he pressed on, "Jim, that bastard, put me in this…this shit hole filled with whores, and I'm not going to let anyone fucking touch me." He sank onto the chest again, hugging his arms around his bare stomach.
They were at Angelo’s for lunch the next day. John had returned a few hours after he left, cold and tired, and dragged Sherlock to the bedroom. John had slipped under the covers and pulled Sherlock close, simply holding his sub until he fell asleep. He’d made an eleven am appointment with Ella and Sherlock had waited not very patiently outside the office for the full sixty minutes. Finally John walked outside and Sherlock strode up to him.
“Sherlock.” John squeezed his hand and gave him his best ‘I’m smiling but you’re toeing the line’ smile. “Are you terrorizing the staff while I’m not here, sweetheart?”
Sherlock paused and looked out the window. He bit his lip and nodded confidently. “Of course. I’ve barely left this flat since coming back from hospital.” He stood and sent a text assuring Lestrade John would be fine. He reached for his coat.
John glanced down at the basket. His stack of clothes was much shorter than the detective’s pile of pressed and folded dark trousers and some of his less expensive, non-dry clean shirts. A couple pairs of his pants were neatly folded at the top and John took a deep breath, clenching his hand around the rim of wicker. He wasn’t exactly thrilled with the idea of Mrs. Hudson seeing and touching his used underwear. She liked to dote on them though, either through tidying their flat or keeping them in food, and she seemed so very pleased that Sherlock had gotten himself a dom. She didn’t see her own sons very much, and John was reluctant to forbid her from rinsing out his socks—even though she
The boys recover from the Sebastian scare. Another victim is found in the serial killer case and this one is a little different.
Sherlock stepped back. John had never shouted at him like this. He didn’t like it one bit even if a part of him kind of thought he deserved it.
Cars droned on outside and faint voices from the other tenants sounded through the old walls. Sherlock’s experiment detritus littered the table and John poured himself a mug of steaming coffee. He opened the cabinet to reach for the package of Hob Nobs he’d taken from his bedsit yesterday evening. Gone. Not even a crumb. First his under shirt, now his biscuits. It looked like there was a thief about. He was willing to bet every quid in his wallet the culprit was a lanky git with curly hair and a too-big brain. His mouth quirked and he drank his coffee, sadly Hob Nob-less. Hell it was quiet here. There were no background noises of bubbling liquids or hissing chemicals. No dead pigeons. No silver Macbook on the desk beside his own red laptop. Sherlock had taken it with, then. He must anticipate being there a while.
“Yes. You’ll get used to it. On your knees, right here.” He pushed Sherlock to his knees in front of him and then grabbed the crop. He scooted up to the very edge of the chair and spread his legs. “Suck me.”
Sherlock nodded. This was nice. They were both mellow and comfortable again and it was clear John didn’t harbor any bad feelings about last night. Sherlock had wondered if he would get some sort of silent treatment today but that was clearly not the case.
John leaned up, looking down at his sub. He was delighted at how pliant he had become and his inner dom swelled in pride. He had reduced this glorious, genius man to a mewling, spacing wreck. It felt pretty good. His erect cock jerked in agreement. His Defense was still simmering low and he grabbed the lube, slicking himself up with a growl.
“This came out of the printer once you’d gone.” John held a piece of paper out to him. “It’s probably nothing, just the ‘page two of two’ of whatever it was that had you running out of here before. Did you want dessert?”
They finished off the ravioli and John put away half of the lasagna and salad into the fridge for later and sighed patting his sated belly. “That’s much better. Now where were we?”
Sherlock looked back at his feet, then grinned devilishly. He slipped to the floor and shuffled between his dom’s legs, pushing his knees apart. John peered around the edge of the page, watching Sherlock scoot closer to the sofa and then reach for his fly. He tossed the magazine aside and lifted his hips as Sherlock pulled his button and zipper, shucking his trousers and pants to the floor. Sherlock knelt up and wrapped his mouth around John’s cock. One hand was braced on his bare thigh as he bobbed and sucked.
Sherlock snuggled closer, wondering vaguely how the hell he’d gotten so lucky. “Do you sub more often than you dom?”
"You can't keep doing this." Mycroft's voice was tired. "You cannot continue to take opium, Sherlock. It's terrible for your health and it makes the family look awful."
Mrs. Hudson gave him a final squeeze and he jogged up the stairs, manfully drawing himself up to face his angry dom.
Sherlock cranked on the tears. “I would, I really would, I just miss Owen so much!” He sobbed. It sounded a little forced, but he was desperate now. He didn’t think Vincent would really try anything, but Sherlock was more concerned about getting his cover blown.
"No you're not. You'll be there four nights. Janine will be in attendance. You two can mingle, chat. Start looking like the couple you're going to be."
John continued speaking in that no nonsense dominant tone. “We still need to sign some paperwork and then I’m taking you home and I’m going to look at that arm that you’re favoring.”
Sherlock closed his eyes. He was being so forceful and dominant. It was hot as hell…yet he thought about protesting, he really did.
“Take paracetemol for your elbow and try not to use it. Avoid alcohol and exercise for the first 48 hours.”
It was short. Too short? Sherlock didn’t appreciate small talk, so he was hardly going to add a ‘how is it going?’ No, a greeting, and then straight to the point seemed to be the best way. He stared at the message a moment longer. Should he add a smiley face? No, definitely not. He thumbed the ‘send’ key before he could dwell on it any longer and the message shot off. John drummed his fingers on the cooler. It had a been a couple weeks since he’d last heard from Sherlock, but maybe he was just busy. Well, busy or not, that kiss had been one of the best ones of his life, and he sure as hell wasn’t going to give
Sherlock glanced back at John and said in a clear voice, “he’s my dominant, Sally. Did you not notice the last case we worked?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and John ducked into the closet, opening his box and pulling free the sharp little scissors. He neatly sliced the white ropes away.
dom. John took a deep breath as his angry protective side roared. Yes, Sherlock had been abused, but he was away from that relationship and he had Mike and Betsy now. He poured a mug and added a splash of milk, stirring. John sincerely hoped the younger man would be alright.
Sherlock didn’t need any urging. He straddled John and they snogged hard, their hands rubbing up and down each other’s back and chests. John broke the kiss and hugged him close. “Sore still?” He asked, touching his thighs and bum.
John was doing so well during the course of his shift the next Tuesday, not thinking of Sherlock at all until his last patient came in, a dom woman with the surname ‘Holmes.’ She’d been feeling peaky for a few weeks and when John asked her when she’d last dommed, she’d startled and told him she hadn’t for a couple months. He had sighed to himself and launched into his lecture about the importance of the ‘DS chemical cocktail’ (as he termed it) that dominants and submissives needed regularly in order to be at their healthiest.
An hour later, the credits were rolling on the mold spore documentary and the sun was starting to set. Sherlock was starting to wonder how long John would want to be here. One of them was bound to get hungry soon, or need the toilet. John seemed to be thinking the same thing. He stirred and shifted and lifted his head, taking a moment to acclimate.
The crowd hollered for more but Sherlock shook his head and stood. Noises of dismay echoed in his ears.
the hell it is, I’m going to fucking shoot them!” He snapped, staring down the steps. His hands clenched into fists and he was breathing hard.
"How much you say?" Sherlock asked, fidgeting a little as he eyed the shining stones. Joel lurked in the background, listening but not participating.
He worked a bit longer on the arrow before giving it up. He just didn't have the tools necessary to explore this the way he wanted to. And anyway, the deep, heavy breathing from the bed was a bit of a distraction. Sherlock found himself smiling as he rose. He moved for his violin case and carefully unpacked the instrument. The strings twanged softly as Sherlock fitted it to his shoulder and slid the bow evenly down the D string. John didn't stir and Sherlock began a slow, quiet piece. John snuffled into the pillow and took a deep inhale. He sighed, looking content, and smiled in his sleep.
There was applause all around for Sherlock's win of Star Baker that week, and then Mel stepped forward. "That means that I have the sad duty of announcing who is going home today."
There was a new email—a Mr. Berwick was apparently incarcerated in Belarus. He claimed he hadn’t stabbed his girlfriend to death, yet there he was in prison. Sherlock frowned and shrugged to himself. He was in a good mood and he hadn’t had a case in an age. Maybe this would be interesting. He scanned through the rest of the email.
“There’s other places I can stick this thing, you know.” John pushed his hair aside and slid the nub into his ear.
His horse had other ideas. It had just about enough of all this business of walking in the woods and decided to show Sherlock the exit. It bucked up, lashing out with its back feet.
John grunted as Sherlock’s nails scraped over his skin. His lower back would pay for this tomorrow but the expression of pure golden joy on his sub’s face made him keep going. He smiled at Sherlock’s pleasure and felt a surge of love for his boy. They had a heating pad somewhere, his back would be fine.
Jim saw the tears and pleasure lit his eyes. He slipped his hand into the folds of his gown and rubbed himself. John wanted to flee. Every instinct was telling him to run but there was no escape from this. He could run and get caught by the guards. There was no escape. He startled when Jim grabbed his sore arm and hauled him off to a different room.
Mel had already made him promise to save her one (or five). They just had to cool first. He eyed the clock. He had plenty of time.
“A case.” He swung off John’s knees, the dom succinctly forgotten, as he texted Lestrade back. John sighed down at his half erect cock. “Not yet, buddy.” He muttered at it.
Sherlock opened his eyes. The room was pitch black and quiet. The rain had stopped. Judging by John’s steady breathing beside him, he was still asleep. The doctor’s arm was around his shoulders, strong and protective, and Sherlock glanced up at his face and saw nothing but dark and the faint outline of his hair in the very dim light coming from down the hall. Carefully, he pulled away from John, easing his arm to the mattress. He tiptoed to his wardrobe and pulled a dressing gown off the hanger. He wrapped it around his nude body, shivering when the cool silk-cotton settled on his skin. He slipped out of the room on silent feet and closed the door behind, relaxing only once he was in the hall. He’d had lots of practice extracting himself from a dom’s bed. Seb often dragged him to sleep with him, only for Sherlock to slink off later and head for the corner of the kitchen where he kept his experiments. Seb hated him experimenting, and the dead of night was the perfect time to tend them without the man’s rude commentary.
"Preferably, down to the inch" said Sue. "Today, you are making petit fours. We need three different types."
“We can look for something that’s not a play collar.” John said. “A more permanent option. If you, you know, want that.” John looked down at the plate, examining a chip in the glass.
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed, five minutes or thirty-five, when a soft knock sounded on the door.
John sighed and laced their fingers together before he crawled back under the covers. He scooted close to his sub and kissed the back of his hand, then he snuggled close to his chest. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him, holding tight. John took a deep and tucked his face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck and sighed happily when long familiar hands stroked up and down his back, soothing and reassuring. John had no idea what he’d been saying in his sleep but Sherlock seemed to understand that he simply needed to be held. He was grateful for the lack of conversation and after his sub fell asleep, he lay awake until the room grew grey-pink with dawn, listening to Sherlock breathe and taking comfort from it.
The merchant looked at Sherlock and his clothes in disdain. A dark brown hessian traveling cloak, stained with dirt and street filth hung over the back of Sherlock’s chair. His shirt and trousers were made of coarse linen fabric in shades of grey and tan. A plain black belt was tight around his waist. These clothes were a far cry from what Prince Sherlock Holmes of Britannia normally wore but today he wasn't Sherlock, he was his scruffy street persona Shezza.
“He wanted it!” Seb yelled. A livid bruise was rising around his eyebrow. “I was coming to see why he didn’t text me back!”
“I’m right, aren’t I? That’s partly why you’ve been giving me so much space. I was abused, yes, but you worried about yourself too.”
John was nervous as Mary admired his tart and Paul cut a piece and bit into it. "Mm." He blinked. "That's excellent. It's easy for the lime to overpower the coconut flavor, but you've got them perfect."
"I know‒believe me. You're used to your independence now and Seb didn't give you much room to breathe, did he?"
"No X-rays." Sherlock stood up. "I've been prodded and abused enough for one night." He stood up and wished airplanes could fly faster as he strode towards Lestrade's car, trying and failing to feel like nothing at all was wrong.
He didn’t see much of Sherlock for the rest of the day, but there were lots of strange sounds coming from outside. John really hoped the pigeon was completely dead when his sub had found it. For the poor bird’s sake. He wandered the flat, tidying up odds and ends and also glancing around at Sherlock’s things. He hadn’t had time to properly investigate the flat and all its weird and unique contents. There was the bison head. A knife jammed in the mantle. A dog paperweight. A board of pinned bugs. John went to the bookshelf. Lots of leatherbound volumes with Latin titles. A few reference guides. A little book on different types of blood spatter. There were a few paperbacks tucked among the references, and their titles made John freeze.
“Sure.” Her voice was thick and hoarse from crying. “They said someone would be coming by.” She stepped aside and they both went in. The house was modest, cozy rather than flashy with lots of dark wood accents and comfortable furniture. There weren’t many walls, giving the whole space an open feel. A pile of heaped laundry was on the floral print sofa and some children’s toys were strewn by the television. The floor needed washing and a good scrub over the windows wouldn’t be amiss.
…” He lay there panting and grinning and John rubbed the lacey edge of the glove up the underside of his cock. Again he swore and jerked up. John countered the sensation with the silk and Sherlock moaned. He teased him with the tip of a silky finger, rubbing the glans softly and using his lacey thumb to rub the base of his cock.
"Your Highness?" She said again. A hint of respect for his position touched the edge of her surprised voice.
They both looked down at the limbs. Caucasian. Most likely male, from what he could tell. “What do we know?” John asked.
John stood up and grabbed a tissue, spitting out the mess. Sherlock stared at him in wonder, realizing with a belated sort of embarrassment that he hadn’t shaved down there in a while. John grinned at him. “Blew you silent huh? I’ll have to remember that.”
"Thank you much, sir!" She did a little curtsy, eyes on the shining coin, and bit the silver to check if it was real. Sherlock mounted up and clucked the horse into a canter and cruised up the winding dirt path. There were few people out. A couple of the small homes had candles in the windows and Sherlock noted a few of the palace guards doing rounds. The Barrens used to be the worst sort of slum, rife with violence and homeless, hungry citizens. Sherlock's grandfather had done a load of work to make the Barrens safer and least relatively habitable before he died. Sherlock’s mother had taken up the project, creating more housing, jobs, and schools. She'd done much to improve the place before she died, but there were still pockets of homelessness, poverty and filth. Crime wasn't nearly the problem it had been in generations past. Boring.
Good lord, this was getting odder and odder. Sherlock had stimulating conversation with a concubine? Was this a dream?
Twenty minutes later, John was taking his jacket off in Sherlock’s sitting room, the cooler on the floor by the door. “What’s that?” Sherlock asked, taking his coat and eying the little box. He didn’t have time to hear an answer though, as his phone rang and he lunged for it.
“I stick by what I said.” John stuck a forkful of noodles into his mouth. “He was a bad man and a bloody awful cabbie.”
He peeled his breeches off and unclasped the leather bracers. He slipped the broken arrow shaft free of his vest and set it aside for further inspection. He threw the rest of his clothes down, retrieved the shaft and arrow head , and went out into the bedroom. He grabbed a grey wool blanket off the bed and wrapped it around his bare body, shivering as he stepped up to the fire. He closed his eyes, taking a moment to enjoy the the heat chasing away the damp chill on his skin and curling his toes in the soft fur rug.
John hung up and Molly winced. “Oh Sherlock,” she murmured to the blinking display. “What have you done?”
“You were awful to Lestrade.” John sat beside him, his tone marginally softer. “What did we talk about before? About you being rude?”
on the tall windows, drowning out all the traffic and city noises, the sound enclosing the flat like a cocoon.
He certainly had. He'd agreed to take the case, promising John he would do nothing dangerous until his doctor got back from visiting Harry in Paris, France.
Three more minutes went by. Sherlock twisted his head to crack his neck and John ignored it. This was turning into an ordeal. For
“Dominants have a rough adolescence. We have the normal growing pains like subs have along with the floods of extra hormones that eventually even out into Defense.” He grinned. “I once ripped my bedroom door clean off the hinges when my mum tried to ground me. She didn’t let me have a door for two weeks after that.”
“He seemed really tense.” John mused. “Has he, do you know if he’s subbed at all since breaking up with his dom?”
Sherlock pulled the blindfold off and a pair of warm dark eyes blinked at him. John smiled and kissed him again and Sherlock tugged the knot on the rope, freeing his hands.
Sherlock found himself laughing, genuinely laughing with John. Good Christ, when was the last time he’d really laughed at anything? They mutually decided to eat on the sofa, as there were several cultures growing in petri dishes on the kitchen table (John didn’t even make any disgusted faces). They sank into the leather and Sherlock propped his foot up on the edge of the table. John kicked off his shoes and crossed his socked feet on top of a quarterly journal. It was nice, this. Sherlock found he felt completely comfortable around John. He’d never once felt this way around Seb. Never this…relaxed.
“Going out, love?” Mrs. Hudson’s door was open and she looked to be in the midst of cleaning. A kerchief was tied around her hair and she had yellow rubber gloves on.
The victim had been the recipient of a rather amorous sub interested in cheating on his own deadbeat partner. That partner had possessed quite a jealous streak, and didn’t like the idea of the victim wearing his sub’s wedding band—hence the poisoning.
“No. Nothing can be done tonight. Unfortunately.” No point in telling the police. A group of officers flashing badges would scare the murderer off for sure. It would be odd for the two of them to pop into the restaurant solely for a dessert or such. It wasn’t that kind of place and he didn’t want to draw unusual attention to themselves. He knew John wouldn’t want to go out for something sweet. Not after all that cake.
The bathing room was one large space containing a water pump and a plethora of buckets. There were benches for people to sit on and containers of
John was quiet for a moment. His first instinct was to refuse, to back him into the wall and tell him damn well why he was going to hospital and that he was going to get examined whether he bloody liked it or not.
“Good.” John stroked his hand over Sherlock’s chest, rubbing a nipple and then squeezing his arse. “I think we can find a way to spend tonight. I have a genius to congratulate.”
"Herana." He blurted. His voice was scratchy and he coughed a few times. Molly reached for the metal pitcher on the table and poured him a cup of water. “You can sit.” She gestured to the other chair.
"Regret what?" John said. He'd taken a moment to admire the skull more closely and he frowned at Sherlock, confused. He was rather adorable when he frowned like that.
Though Sherlock did like seeing John all gruff and bothered, tonight it was just going to be an unfortunate side effect. The waiter came by with the wine.
The toaster popped and Sherlock wormed away. John watched with a predatory gaze as he fixed two pieces of toast and offered one to him with a teasing little smile.
Mycroft leaned back in his chair and dabbed daintily at his mouth. "Stealing money away from merchants who hope to make a living in London?" Mycroft asked, shrugging. "What are you thinking?"
“Logan wanted to be sure I was comfortable.” Sherlock said. “I was cold, towards the end, and he saw me shivering and added kindling to the fire. He brought me water too. It was at odds with the fact that he’d been using me as a whetstone since I’d arrived. Maybe he thought he’d been remiss in his hospitality,” he added dryly, sipping the water. “I awoke in hospital with John and Mycroft.”
“Jesus Christ!” Lestrade pounded the brakes. The paper cup in his hand crumpled as he reflexively grabbed the wheel. Delicious coffee flew everywhere, soaking him and the seat and windows. He pulled over with a screech of tires and the body rolled off and into the gutter. He sat there for a moment, stunned, before he got out only a few yards up from 221. He crouched beside the man in the gutter and took a pulse, horrified and praying the guy wasn’t dead. There was a pulse, though faint. He needed a doctor. Lestrade stood up. He was right outside B. If John was in, he could pop down and examine him. Lestrade turned to walk to the door and stopped in his tracks. John was standing, fists clenched and feet planted shoulder width apart. He was smiling in a sort of grim, satisfied way at the man in the road.
in a tea towel for hell’s sake. Who the hell kept severed fingers in a tea towel? Or anywhere for that matter. He was hardly better though, feeding Sherlock’s desire for experimentation and giving him gifts that would make Hannibal Lector jealous.
John grunted and tried to move again, tried to fight. John grabbed his balls and twisted once more. John shouted out and Jim fell across his back, planting him to the floor with one forearm. Jim fumbled his gown open to free his cock and he rolled his hips over John’s arse.
by Jennifer Chiaverini. He stopped by the library to grab it and they fortunately had several copies on the festive 'happy holidays' shelf. He stared at the other copies and thought. Would anyone else want to join? He felt a bit badly that he was mainly showing up for the food and wondered if by bringing a fellow reader, he would be more welcomed. Who could he ask? His coworkers were all busy with holiday things, family, and work. He honestly didn't know if many of them were readers. He couldn't see Sarah reading a book like this. He eyed the cover and it's Christmas tree and general warmth. She was more into spy thrillers. To be fair, so was he, but it was healthy to broaden one's horizons. Sherlock would not do it. Greg....? Maybe? Mike. He doubted it, but maybe. He thought of Mycroft and laughed. Molly? Hm, Molly might just be willing. He checked out two copies of the book and went home.
“Well, then I dunno how it happened, but suddenly there’s a knife in my hands. And, you know, me old man was a butcher, so I know how to handle knives.”
His opponent didn’t look nearly as confident or cocky. In fact, he looked spitting angry. John watched, smiling, as Sherlock moved around the table and soundly beat the man. Based on the reaction of the audience when he won, this wasn't the first round Sherlock had played. A few notes went to Sherlock and John laughed. Sherlock gave a little bow to the applauding crowd and peered up when John wolf-whistled. His face lit up and he walked over to John, pushing his pool stick at a spectator. "How's the party?" He asked, smug.
Sherlock jumped in, telling him about the texts. He pulled the collage out of his coat and showed him. Greg opened the envelope and looked blankly at the pictures.
Sherlock hailed a cab, sliding into the leather seat and directing the driver to Baker Street. He pulled out his phone and, against his better judgment, texted Mycroft.
For an hour John licked and sucked and teased and nibbled and kissed every inch of Sherlock’s naked body. He knew how to nibble his nipples
Jim staggered, growled, and pounced. He was shoving John to the bed but John twisted and they ended up in a heap on the floor.
the bloody case. The killer would want him out of the way for sure. He wanted to drag Sherlock home, lock the door, and hunker down in the flat protecting him until this all passed and the murderers were behind bars. He shook his head to himself. He didn’t want him on the case. If that made him selfish, then so be it. If that made him domineering and overprotective, he didn’t care. He finally had someone he loved
"Almost done." John wiped his fingers on a tea towel and tossed it over his shoulder. He piled sausages and beans and eggs and tomatoes and toast in a plate and put it on the table in front of Greg.
This made them laugh harder. John rubbed the back of his neck, feeling awkward for having been shouted at by the officer.
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded confidently. He sat on the edge of the bed, holding the base of the glass plug in his fingertips. John got over his thighs and Sherlock licked his lips. He petted John’s back and bum, rubbing and stroking just like John did. He set the plug carefully on the side table and squeezed some lube onto his fingers, then smeared them gently through his dom’s cheeks. He squirmed and unsurprisingly, he was tight. Sherlock rubbed his back and rubbed his hole, delightfully anticipating what was to come. He was going to penetrate his dom! Finally—for the first time. John hummed and Sherlock wriggled a finger inside, slipping it in and out. John relaxed after that and he pushed another one in, sliding deeper. He found the sweet spot and pushed. John hummed again. “Excellent, love.”
He realized that if he wanted to, he could see John again. He was imprisoned in this horrible castle and as a guest all Sherlock would have to do was summon him. The thought pleased him and he decided to request John again tonight. He stood up and slipped his favorite dagger into his belt. Mycroft had gifted it to him years ago. The silver blade curved up at the tip and the handle was a lovely cherry wood wrapped in black leather. He liked the weight and length of it. It wasn't too flashy and it didn't draw attention, unlike some of the gem encrusted knife hilts he'd seen. Garish and likely to be stolen, not to mention a right pain in the arse to scrub free of blood.
"Good." Greg nodded and John cut a slice off the cooked sausage. He blew on it to cool it down and held it out to his sub. Sherlock tilted his head and picked it delicately off John's hand and chewed, chasing it with more coffee. He shivered and John rested his clean hand in his hair, shushing him softly.
“Well, you’re wrong.” He pulled a plug out of the box, smallish, and lube. He coated the plug liberally. “I’m going to prove that you’re wrong.” To Sherlock’s surprise, he handed the plug over. “Hold this, please.” He unbuckled his own belt and pushed everything down and off. He unbuttoned his shirt and threw it on the chair in the corner.
"So," Harry came up next to him and nudged him. "Who here belongs with Mr. Tall and Handsome? Besides you?"
She nodded and wiped her nose and Greg stood up, pacing over to Sherlock and grabbing his elbow, striding with him down the hallway. “Outside.” He said firmly.
“I’m full of surprises.” Sherlock said. “There’s not much to massage, really. It’s mostly anatomy and memorizing steps.”
Sherlock extracted the toy from his mouth and wiped his chin. John crouched in front of him and cupped his nape, pulling him into a rough, welcoming kiss. Sherlock grunted in surprise and melted into him, resting his fingers on John’s cheek, enjoying and returning the affection. Sherlock pulled back after a moment and shoved John to the floor.
He closed his eyes. His brain was buzzing and nausea roiled through his stomach from the adrenaline of the chase and roll down the concrete corners. A cool breeze chilled him and he wished for his Belstaff, hanging in the flat. He didn't anticipate that this venture would take so long. He crouched on the ground, wanting John's warm capable fingers and soothing voice. He pulled out his phone and tapped the button. The screen remained blank. Dead. He swore and shoved it back in his pocket
“Oh good. I didn’t want to antagonize him, you know? But I’ve got a gift for you both.” She passed him a basket with the words Fortnum and Mason stamped across the weave. Surprised, Sherlock set it on the table and opened it up. There were some cheeses and truffles, also some elegantly iced biscuits and fancy Indian teas.
"Here." He gave her a little clay tub of yellowish cream. "Dab this on your sore spots. It'll keep it clean and help with the pain." She nodded and took it eagerly. "Apply it after bathing, and morning and night. You can do it yourself or I or one of the girls can help you."
John stared up at the heavens and took a deep breath. They were drawing a bloody crowd. “Okay,” he said in a low voice, “here’s what we’ll do. You can take that back to Baker Street,”
He gradually became aware of several things at once. He was on his back. He was wearing pants and nothing else. He was indoors and the room was warm but the scent of crackling woodsmoke blinded his nose to every other scent. He went to lift his arm and it was then he realized he was tied down at the wrists and ankles.
The printer crunched and warbled loudly, breaking his thoughts. A few pages spat out. He listened to John get up and take the pages. Sherlock looked over his shoulder, watching John press some buttons. Nothing happened.
“Alicia.” She said, clearing her throat. She poured herself a glass of water and tucked some loose hair behind her ear, curling up on a wooden kitchen chair across from Greg. Sherlock elected to stand, and he glanced around the kitchen. Some photos were on the fridge and he peered at them. Someone’s dog in a park. A man who looked a lot like Alicia with a couple children. A few shots of Alicia smiling with a dark-haired white male partner. He had a collar on his neck and grease under his fingernails in the photo and Sherlock knew instantly that it was Jeff.
John inclined his head, unable to look him in the eye. Any resemblance to Sherlock would shatter him. "You're welcome, your Majesty."
Last year after he'd tallied everything he'd concluded that 221's sense of Christmas spirit was at 84.78% out of a possible one hundred. He thought that was pretty good for a structure containing three people, one of which was simply observing. He was mildly curious to see how this year would measure up.
“Good boy.” He kissed his cheek and they went to the door. “Carry that.” John pointed at the bag and Sherlock happily picked it up.
"How long?" Sherlock asked him. He was leaning over his counter, his hair haloed in the light. John looked up into silver blue eyes.
It was on a busy afternoon shift that he saw a tall, lanky figure with dark curly hair and a long dark coat in the waiting room. A sort of leaping lion sensation roared happily in his chest as his brain yelled “Sherlock!” He was about to walk over there when the man turned around. John froze. Not Sherlock. He rolled his eyes and his heart sank, and he was completely humiliated with himself even though no one had any idea what had just stampeded through his brain.
“Alright, alright.” John managed to slip in behind him and pull him close without sloshing much water over the sides of the tub. His warm back pressed again his chest and John reached for his stiff cock. Sherlock lifted a leg and leaned his head back as John worked his hard dick. It didn’t take long, and with a soft “oh!” he came, spurting all over John’s hand in the warm water.
Sherlock got up and John hid a smile. He strolled out to the kitchen. As he expected, Sherlock followed very close behind, nearly walking into him. Subs liked to be close to their doms after punishment. John saw it every time he either punished a sub or had a particularly intense scene with someone. He did it himself too, the rare times he earned punishment from a dom. He enjoyed the proximity and he liked watching over his sub.
Mycroft tutted and the condescending sound pierced right into John’s chest. “You don’t always play safe.” He said. “This young woman would agree with me. Hospital,
"You love looking me over like this." Sherlock licked his lips and tilted his head down, looking up at John. He swung his legs back and forth. John raised a brow at him and Sherlock giggled, feeling submissive and playful now despite his aching back. "You love touching me and checking me and being all doctor-y."
Sherlock’s grin faded as he lowered the vial, placing it and the others in a test tube rack and putting it in the fridge.
“These are expensive restaurants.” Donovan noted, looking at the wad of wet receipts. “I’m not saying he couldn’t afford it, but not many students would choose to go to
Mrs. Hudson paced back and forth in her rooms, wringing her hands and listening to the rain beat at the windows. This wouldn't do. Sherlock was a moody lad at the best of times, but Sally‒unflappable, stoic Sally‒usually brushed his snide comments aside. Water off a duck's back. That she spoke up at all about Sherlock's moods was indicative that something was very wrong. Mrs. Hudson had expected Sherlock to be thrilled to be back at Sherrinford, surrounded by his books and science contraptions and his falcons. His bird, Beatrix, was brooding. Sherlock had been waiting for the bird to lay an egg for some time now and Mrs. Hudson had noticed the round egg when she'd gone up to the falconry to check on her own bird, Leopold. She wondered if Sherlock knew yet.
Sherlock was seriously glad he wasn’t high.Greg’s unique method of ‘sobering him up’ wasn’t something he needed to be acquainted with yet again. Twice had been plenty…
“He was being an arse. He tried to force himself on me. I pushed him away and he was unhappy. He spread silly rumors about me. So I spiked his water bottle one day.”
They stumbled into the bedroom and Sherlock laid down naked and warm in the sheets. His bruises looked darker now after the shower. John applied the ointment and bandages and arnica to his back. They curled up under the sheets and Sherlock plastered himself to John's front, hugging him and clinging to him almost desperately. John kissed his forehead and rubbed his hand up and down his back in broad, even strokes.
The doorbell sounded. Sherlock looked up. Client? John put his book down and got up and looked out the window.
“Oohhh….” John slid closer to his sub, his hands finding their way to his dark curly head. “Sherlock, that’s….”
The big man nodded and waded into the fray, yelling, telling everyone to shut up and take it outside. Sherlock laughed and darted out the front door into the pungent night air.
"My pleasure." Mike said. "I'll be up later to check on you, your Highness." Mike grabbed his bag and headed for the door. Sherlock wanted him to stay and act as witness to Mycroft's imminent committal of fratricide. Mike left and the door shut with a quiet thud. Mycroft stared down at him and Sherlock fidgeted under his blankets, hating the scrutiny.
Sherlock internally rolled his eyes at his own cringing stupidity. What did he care whether John lived or died? He was just one of dozens of criminal whores at Jim's castle. In theory John's existence should mean nothing at all to Sherlock. But John had told him his whole life story and Sherlock wasn't bored to tears. That alone set John apart. Well, that and his lovely handsome face.
Sherlock scowled and glared at the biscuits as if they'd personally offended him. They loved John's gingersnaps and Sherlock watched them gush with praise. It wasn't a surprise when John won Star Baker that week. John was beaming and Sherlock smiled with pride when everyone clapped. His applause was loudest of all.
“So he calls me over and I think—it’s a bloke!—a, a person in the water! Maybe he’s alive! So we pulls him up an’ here he is. Didn’t think he was a person up close, to be honest.” Captain Rose glanced down again at the body. “Wasn’t sure what it was or if it was even real, he’s so wet and fucked up. We called the police anyway. I don’t want no trouble, y’know?” Despite the Captain’s reluctance to even look at the body, John got the impression this story would be told in pubs for years to come.
"Good." Sherlock slipped his hand into John's and smoothed his thumb up and down over the back of his palm. He slid his hand down to John’s wrist, pressed a fingertip into his pulse. "You're nervous." Sherlock's voice was soft.
"They would explode from the force and speed of the movement! The energy required to move at those speeds would cause sonic booms‒not to mention Father Christmas would be subjected to centrifugal forces over seventeen thousand times greater than gravity‒"
Sorry this update is so late (but this chapter's long and fluffy, so there's that)! RL was very busy these last few days.
“Um, uh…” John looked at the five chain and leather leashes dangling from her hands. One stood out. It was the same grey color, a good length, and studded in the center every eight inches or so with a silver circle. The lining of the adjustable handle was the same silk as the collar lining.
“How are you?” John wandered into the room with his own half full tea mug. He was in his clothes from yesterday, his shirt wrinkled and untucked, his feet bare on the floor and his hair ruffled and adorably unkempt. He poured more water from the kettle in his mug and drank. Sherlock made a face. That couldn’t taste good—it would be watered down at best. “You can get used to anything in the army.” John answered to his disgusted face, taking another sip.
"A kiss would be lovely." He lied. Sherlock rested fingertips on the side of John's face and leaned in.
“Mm…” Sherlock continued to type one-handed. John found this endearing and he couldn’t help the goofy grin that crossed his face, which he stuffed away before Sherlock could see. He rubbed his fingers gently over the joint. “Do you know your anatomy, Sherlock?” John asked, avoiding the gauze.
“So you’re saying,” he stared at said loose cannon, who was watching him with an intelligent hawkish gaze from the other side of his desk, “that the suspected murderer, the one who killed the sub Sandra Llwellyn, has…just…vanished?”
"I am." He said. He was a bit wobbly but his stomach was grumbling. He wrapped a blanket around his shoulders and shuffled to the table. Brown rice and vegetables weren't his favorite. He would have preferred a curry, but this smelled divine. He sat and tucked in.
“I love you too, sweetheart.” John kissed the top of his head. Tonight. He would ask tonight. If they had survived this case they could survive anything together. And when times got tough, well, they had an armada of people on their side to help them through it. Mike, Betsy, Mycroft, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson. Subs and doms, old friends and new. John nodded to himself. Tonight.
When the attendant saw John tiptoe gingerly into the room he lifted a brow and ordered three days of medical leave before John could even open his mouth. He laid on his pallet which was near the fire now beside Molly’s, thank Christ. He dozed all day. Molly brought him tea and tinctures and food and put ointment on his sore spots. He kind of loved her for it. By evening he was alone again. He sat up. The fire was banked and glowing. He stood carefully and stretched his back, his spine popping. His arse muscles throbbed and he took a few steps forward, grimacing as his knee cracked and his back protested the movement. He had to move around or he’d turn to stone. He went to the baths and rinsed off the previous night. Molly had doctored him a bit so he was mostly clean. He was glad he wasn’t too tired.
"Based on my calculations, Father Christmas, or 'Santa' if you prefer, has roughly thirty-one hours to 'round the globe, taking time zones into account."
“Hold still.” John grunted. His bum was slapped and John shoved the thing in. It was tight and a little sore, and the entry had left something to be desired. Sherlock exhaled. John went back to the table and picked up the gag. “You won’t be able to speak, so if you need to safeword, snap your fingers.”
Mycroft looked away briefly before looking into his brother's eyes. "I'm grounding you. Consider yourself cut off." He said.
Sherlock lounged back in his rickety chair and raised a brow at the merchant standing at Angelo's bar. The merchant was tanned and, stupidly, wearing a jangling coin pouch and a very expensive, finely embroidered red and purple silk coat. He'd attracted the eye of every pickpocket and opportunistic whore within Angelo's fine public house, The Salty Swine, when he loudly called for a pint of the most expensive drink on the menu before berating the serving girl, Angelo's niece, for being too slow. The man was here to visit his favorite prostitute despite having a wife and three, no, four, young children at home. A wealthy man like this would never otherwise set foot in a place like the 'Swine.
He was already naked by the fire and clutching a pillow when John came in, his clothes flung all over the floor. He stared at the ring, amazed. He never would have ever dreamed that
Christ. He laid back on the carpet and clutched his head, half expecting the spinning castle to throw him into the ceiling. A breeze fluttered over him and the candles in the corridor flickered. He listened. Silence. Not a soul stirred. Sherlock got up, fell into the wall, and slid down to hands and knees. Fine. This was fine. He could just crawl to his rooms. Easy.
The longer John stayed in the room, the more interesting he became. Sherlock had already deduced broad strokes of his life and now he had a chance to focus on the physical. John's eyes were a rich, dark blue. His hair was a bit shaggy, the color of sand and honey with grey washed throughout. His expression, tight and neutral when Sherlock had first laid eyes on him, was softer now. An echo of
"There was no reason to believe there would be any violence." Sherlock said, exasperated. "I just wanted to get a look at Dee and make absolutely sure before I told Mel anything."
He jogged back upstairs with the food and found Sherlock in the kitchen. He was wearing his sleep trousers and his dressing gown, standing in front of the near-boiling kettle. His thumbs were flying over his phone.
He hadn't seriously fantasized about collaring a complete stranger since before he went into the army. He wasn't some naïve novice dom, drooling over the first hot sub he'd ever seen! There were plenty of hot subs out there. John should know, he'd had several while on tour. A few young sub lads in his platoon had given him longing looks and there was an elegant bar owner with long ebony plaited hair he’d subbed for beautifully in Bombay. He smiled at the memory. That was some fun furlough.
"Where's Sherlock?" Lestrade asked some time later. John, warm and full of food, hadn't noticed the detective slip off. "Could be in the loo." John said. Privately he thought Sherlock might have gone home. At that moment, Dimmock and Sally came back into the room.
"Yes." She said again. “It’s not all sex. I had a guest once just wanted me to unpack her things, keep her company. Another time I was assigned to a couple of guys, married. They let me hang out in their rooms, eat their food. I tidied after them. They were nice.” She licked her lips.
"Look up." Sherlock grinned and John glanced up at the little bundle of greenery dangling above the door.
, he reasoned. He didn’t share his feelings easily with strangers. Sure, he’d been seeing her since he came back to London, but he could never open up fully. Maybe he just didn’t want to.
With Sherlock’s recruitment, the meal was prepared faster and they were soon seated and eating a fantastic lamb roast. John was beside Mike and across from Sherlock, who was next to Betsy.
The leather slackened and then John was unbuckling the gag. He slid it slowly out of his mouth, wiping the saliva away again.
The attendant left John outside the Prince’s guest room. A Britannian guard from Sherrinford palace stood sentry beside the door. She glanced at John as the attendant walked away. John looked at her textured hair, her reddish armor and the blades and pistols tucked away at her hip. No doubt she had a knife or two in her boots as well. She glanced him over, taking in his loincloth and bare chest. She made a small "hm" noise in her throat and faced forward as John raised his hand to knock on the door.
Sherlock took it off the bar and shrugged it on his shoulders. He tugged the servant's bell to summon someone to tidy the room and strode past John back to the bedroom. "With me." His warm hand brushed John's hip as he passed to the other room. Frisson sparked up John’s body, emanating from that brief touch. He took a deep, slow breath and followed.
would want to date him, much less propose. But John had and the Gordian Knot of confused feelings was gone for good. John had unraveled it. God, he needed to make an entry about this…
Sherlock hummed and yelled for Lestrade. He already felt a bit better. John was coming home and he wasn't going to be alone tonight. Good. Yes.
They took a long time, soaping and rinsing and kissing. John massaged shampoo into his sub’s hair and Sherlock gently washed every inch of his dom’s body, lost in thought as he did. Was now a good time to ask him to move in? They were in the shower, but did it matter? Would John say no? It would be fine if he did. Sherlock understood the desire to have one’s own space. Better to do so now, he decided, while he had the courage and the oxytocin whizzing through his veins made his brain hum a little quieter.
John had been pleasantly agreeable to him going off to Minsk for this case. He had given him the crop just because he knew Sherlock liked it—and this was
“On the fridge.” Sherlock winced and unbuttoned his shirt cuff and rolled the sleeve up his arm, peeling it away from the blood. His pride was telling him to throw this pushy dom out of his flat and out of his life, but his arm was suggesting he let the doctor stay and help. His arm was winning by a mile. John grabbed the kit down and wiped his sleeve over the dust that had accumulated on the plastic box. He found a towel folded on the counter and took a clean bowl from the dish drainer, filling it with warm water.
“Alim, Georgia, fucking Ridgewell Brimble—all of them are supposed to be fucking dead! Damn that assassin to hell!”
to tell him when he could and couldn’t lay on the floor? What did he care? Sherlock dragged himself into the green chair. There. He was upright. More than he had been anyway.
Jamie lunged at him with a feral snarl, snatching a blue and white flowered vase from the sideboard and raising it overhead. He had just enough time to drop the mail and lift his arm to protect himself before the vase shattered against his left elbow. He winced as pain shot up his humerus and hot blood poured onto his silky shirt under his coat.
The doctor paused. From what Mike had said, Sherlock managed to push away everyone that came near him. The fact that he was this relaxed in John’s—a dom’s—presence spoke volumes. He hadn’t been this content at the dinner party but he was perfectly alright having this strange dom in his home touching his injured arm. John felt there was something to that, but he didn’t know what.
"I hope so." Mycroft said without waiting for a response. "Because you’re not going back to the Barrens for a long, long time."
“I see you smiling.” John said in a gruff voice. Sherlock rubbed his face into the Tshirt and inhaled his dom’s scent and sighed in contentment. John rolled his eyes fondly and freed his other arm, mashed as it was into the pillow. He squeezed some goop onto his fingers and reached down, smearing it over his red skin.
Sherlock grinned, feeling warmed in a way that had nothing to do with the fire or alcohol or the kissing. John thought he was a genius!
Sherlock sighed and sank to the cot as he strode away. John. Mike’s hot blonde friend who he had an aching crush on despite his swearing off doms forever. Dammit.
Sherlock rolled up into a sitting position, absently rubbing his thigh for a moment, gaining his bearings. He wobbled a bit when he stood.
“No, our landlady Mrs. Hudson did. You two should meet.” John added. “She’s not in now, but someday…”
future up without a fight. If he thought about it, he could still feel Sherlock’s warm lips under his and his broad hands, clammy with sweat from the fire and the alcohol and arousal, squeezing his bum. The breathy little noises he’d made when he’d tongued his nipples. John rolled his eyes. He
There was a grumbling noise before he popped up‒his blue dressing gown falling off one shoulder‒ and stomped over to the table. "Good boy." She said as he dropped into the chair like a sack of potatoes. She didn't know if it was the threat or the cake that got him out of bed but she wasn't going to ask.
He paused, then lifted the mask. No point now if Sherlock knew who he was. “Because you’re going to hurt your dom.”
"What?" He poked it, his heart falling into his shoes. "No, no…." He pulled it out of the drawer and tossed the tea towel aside. "It should be nearly done! Why didn't it rise?" The camera people nearby were quick to get a good shot of the flat dough.
“Better. Now come in, Mr. Holmes.” John glanced over Sherlock’s unkempt uniform, the dangling tails of his shirt and his ripped trousers. He hummed in disapproval.
"Coward!" The merchant sneered. He staggered upright and pointed a finger at Sherlock. "You're a coward and cheat!"
John looked down at his coffee and fiddled with the cardboard sleeve, a sort of excited thrill darting through his veins. Would Sherlock ever kneel for him outside?
"Your Highness?" Sally tipped her heard through the doorway to Sherlock's cabin. He was laying on the bed, staring at the ceiling. He didn't respond. "We should be arriving at Sherrinford before tomorrow evening."
“The kinds of play that we talked about.” Ella prompted gently. “The kind you described as ‘the darker stuff.’”
He tossed and turned and sweat all night, throwing up into hastily provided bowls. If his nausea subsided, he couldn't get comfortable. If he was sweating, he was exhausted. If he slept, nightmares plagued him every moment.
“A wealthy dom, perhaps?” Sherlock looked at one of the receipts. “Ah, a Vincent Coel paid with a credit card at
. A normal person would have turned him over to the police, but of all the names Sherlock had been called over the years, ‘normal’ was never on the list. A few more knots were tied in the Gordian Ball of nebulous feelings that was taking shape in his palace.
"Didn't use warm water…" Sherlock muttered. He walked back to his sourdough/chemistry concoction. The cameras wandered off. John threw his recipe together again at lightning speed and flung it back in the oven. He looked at the time. It would be a miracle if this wasn't raw.
Sherlock moved the skull and sank into the armchair by the fire. He steepled his fingers in front of his mouth as he watched John move around the room. His thighs flexed and bulged and his shoulders were toned with muscles used to hauling nets and hoisting sails. How did a fisherman, the son of an adept healer, end up in Jim's herana? What could he have done to end up a prisoner like he was?
“Think you’ll be able to handle me?” His tone was light and playful but veined with a vulnerable chord. How long would the doctor last before he decided that all the kitchen sink experiments and mad dashes to Belarus in the wee hours and the cases were all just too much?
Sherlock rolled his eyes and his dom left, closing the door behind. “What?” Sherlock asked. “Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably wrong.” He shifted in his chair and the ropes rubbed up against his hip. He hid a grin.
He'd pulled on dark chocolate brown breeches, treated to resist water. He wore a forest green tunic and on top of that, a thick leather sleeveless vest that he could wrap on tight and button in place. It was flexible and light and it was similar to what Britannian soldiers wore. It was a sort of armor and it could slow the path of knife stabbing into flesh. He didn't suspect anyone would try to off him, but he preferred to err on the side of caution. He was worth a lot of money and he had no idea who else was going on this hunt. He buckled a pair of brown and black bracers around his forearms.
Sherlock woke up, groggy and with a headache splitting his skull. He opened his eyes. Bright light blasted his retinas and he slammed them shut. His brain struggled to snap to conclusions.
He did, and kissed John right on the mouth before hunching and resting his chin on the doctor’s shoulder with a long contented sigh. John grinned and soaped his belly and gently, very gently lathered his dick and balls. “And that blow job was excellent. I’m so glad you wanted to.”
"Apply pressure." He pressed the towel in place and slid instantly into 'doctor mode'. He glanced at Sherlock's work space and saw the sharp chef knife. The razor edge was grazed with blood. John looked up at Sherlock's face. He looked grim but not woozy.
John looked pissed off as he tapped a few more buttons on the panel. The machine powered off. Sherlock watched his dom closely. John was going to start scolding him in three…two…one…
“Fun fact of the day,” John managed, “but maybe…something a little shorter? How about just, like a noun? A simple noun, everyday common noun. I just don’t want you to forget.”
“I hope he says yes.” Mike added, glancing at the phone. “He’s about as social as a rock, but he’s been at our flat a few times and he’s always at the hospital.”
.” John snapped his fingers and pointed at the floor. Sherlock stared at him, bristling and riled. The part of him that loved his partner was cautiously curious, and the part that was a submissive was
Sherlock replayed it from the beginning and watched it through again. “We know Dixon left Whistler’s with his coworkers. We can also see that they split apart at some point.”
They crossed a little stream rushing over some rocks and it was here that they broke off into smaller groups. Sherlock wanted to go off on his own, but as long as he didn't end up with Seb he didn't care who he was partnered with. Violet asked him if like to pair up and he accepted immediately. They ignored the attendants and dogs and trotted off alone along a path that lead up a ridge bristling with young green pine trees.
“Time is of the essence here, Sherlock.” Greg snapped out, slapping the rest of the papers into a different pile. “You talked to the barista while I spoke with Vincent. If,
He couldn't tell how much time had passed before the dungeon door opened again. A different guard bearing several blades at her waist appeared holding a lit lantern. Another guard appeared before John let out a hiss.
"Because! Otherwise it'll all come out runny. Obviously it goes on top at the end. You've probably blown your whole technical challenge by mixing it in!"
"You're hurt." John countered, his face softening. "That's why I'm Defensive. The French shite suppressant wore off an age ago."
“And you will have a smarting red bottom by the time I’m finished with you.” Swat, smack, smack. He paused again and smoothed his hand over the red cheeks on his knee. He rubbed up and down his back, chuckling as Sherlock humped languidly into his jeans. “None of that.” He patted his thigh.
John left and Greg came into the room with a mug. "Here y'go. I added a little something to chase the pain away." He winked and Sherlock smiled, taking it from. He sniffed the surface, able to smell the alcohol. He took a few sips and sighed. John came back in the room with his medical bag. Greg lingered, watching, as John numbed his arm and slipped three stitches into the skin.
Sherlock pulled everything back on. His pants irritated his tender skin and his bottom tingled once he was fully dressed. He slid his coat on and pushed his hands into his pockets.
He let go of the bars in the cuffs and snapped both hands repeatedly and was then instantly glad that he did. For the briefest of moments, nothing happened. The flogger stopped and then he heard John’s, “oh shit.” A second later, the chain was lowered and his feet flattened on the ground. The chain slipped off the hook and jangled to the floor and Sherlock reached for the gag. He pulled it off his face, dropping it, and took a deep breath. He unclipped the nipple clamps and growled as the pain ratcheted up. His chest hurt. His back and bottom hurt. He was dripping John’s spunk and he sort of felt like crying.
John looked at him for a moment and then looked away, prowling over to the drawer and grabbing bandages and ointment.
“I know.” His voice was marginally softer. “I didn’t mean to imply that you don’t. But there’s better ways to do it!” He snapped. Neither man said anything and John rubbed his forehead. He sat on the edge of the bed, preparing himself. It was for Sherlock’s own good that he was going to spanked, but it would still be hard.
He was hustled along like a dead thing. He didn't even try to fight. There was no point and the only thing he had energy for anyway was to crawl into a corner and weep. He stumbled along with the guards as they traversed narrow stone corridors. John couldn't stop shivering, whether from cold, sadness, or hunger he couldn't tell.
“Sure, that sounds good.” John thought of hot fresh garlic naan and his mouth watered. “I was looking at collars on my lunch break. Leashes too.” John tugged up his pants and Sherlock stood, fixing his trousers.
John tiptoed into the sitting room with two mugs full of apology. He held one out to his sub and Sherlock took it and sipped.
the Michelin star restaurant so many of the dead subs enjoyed going to. “I’d like to make a reservation for tonight.” He said to the hostess. “Preferably for six o’clock, would that be possible…? Excellent. Thank you.”
"Leave those." Greg said. He pushed the chair back, scraping along the linoleum, and wiped his mouth. He waved John away.
Greg gave him a few more facts before they pulled up to a brick two story home south of the river. Sherlock stepped out into the air tinged with the scent of brine and walked around the front of the car. “Now remember,” Greg said, slamming his door closed, “she just lost her fiance, so be nice.”
“He was domming Owen Allsopp.” Lestrade said. “He’d been worried since he hadn’t heard from him in a few weeks. It sounds like Coel had a few subs he liked to see so when he thought Owen was playing hard to get, he just switched to a different flavor. The guy’s loaded with money and seems to be doing just fine.”
“I may have…” John shifted sheepishly beside him, “punched one of Mycroft’s people too. And maybe shoved a paramedic…they were touching you.”
John took him by the hand and brought him to the bed. He pulled back the blankets and Sherlock got in, burrowing under the covers. John sat on the edge of the bed and propped his ankle up on his knee, untying shoelaces. Sherlock reached out to touch his back, rubbing his hand up and down John’s checkered shirt as he pulled off one shoe, then the other and placed them together neatly on the floor. He slid into bed and Sherlock snuggled into his side, pushing his face against his neck and wrapping an arm around his chest. John slid his arm under him and pulled him closer in a half hug. Sherlock draped one leg over John’s and the doctor grinned in the dark. Lightning flashed and Sherlock sighed, content, his warm tea and mint breath tickling humid on his ear and neck. John stroked idly up and down his shoulder, just enjoying the closeness and the living, breathing warmth of being so near another person in bed again. It was nice having a sub in subspace so nearby again. He’d played in the army with some of the other medics or while on furlough, but it had never gotten as far as one of them being in subspace. It wasn’t allowed. There was even medication to prevent it. It would have been dangerous as hell if someone was far under and they came under attack. By his count, it had been at least eight years since he’d had a spacing sub under his watch. Jesus. He took a deep breath, tilting his head and kissing his forehead. Eight years in the army. Goodness.
John nodded. “Okay. I write up the cases he solves. I’ve spend most of my time with him. Or at the clinic...”
The palace was abuzz with butlers, footmen, maids, and miscellaneous servants whose jobs and titles he didn't care to know. He saw young workers bustling about with piles of linens and attendants doing whatever tasks they'd been assigned. He walked past the endless parlors and receiving rooms, guest rooms, spare rooms and rooms that had no purpose at all. He came to a hub where two hallways intersected. Turning right would take him to the main library and its high arched ceilings and squashy chairs. If he turned left, he would come across the herana and beyond that, Sherrinford’s huge main kitchen. He kept moving forward in a straight line, dodging maids. He didn't really pay attention to the servants and no one acknowledged him except to pause and incline their heads. They feared him, he suspected. He knew among some circles that he was known as "The Mad Prince."
"We can ambush it just there." Bill Murray pointed at a spot just beyond a curve in the road that wended through Avondale Forest. "The road's narrow. They'll have to walk the horses. There's that huge boulder the road goes 'round. You can hunker down there, keep watch, pull a gun."
“Such a lucky sub.” The smile was obvious in John’s voice. “Your dom soothes you after punishment with lotion in bed.”
Sherlock leaned forward again and sucked harder, using his tongue and the tiniest amount of teeth in a way that he knew would drive John nuts.
A baker named Philip Anderson was eliminated and John gratefully boarded the bus to go back home at the end of the day. The next weeks' theme was going to be pastries and John had all week to come up with something good. He was glad he worked part-time. He'd have plenty of time to bake this week. He just hoped his kitchen was equipped for the more complicated things he was thinking of. If not, he would simply have to make it work.
John licked his lips. It had to be him. His signature was decent, but his technical had been meh and his showstopper was crap. Sherlock was beside John, literally on the edge of his seat as Mel spoke.
That year, passersby 221 were treated to the sight of a beach ball-sized tangled lump of fairy lights glinting in the upstairs window beside a small pine tree decorated with sparkling skulls and red and gold globes.
John turned on his heel and marched to the bedroom. He opened his toy box and extracted the little black velvet jewelry case he’d hidden in there. He opened it, staring at the platinum band set in the dark velvet. Shining, chrome-like silver was offset by a more matte, brushed silver. John quite liked it. It had a tiny bit of flash but was understated and masculine. He pulled his own out of his pocket. The rings were identical. Some doms and subs had differing rings, perhaps a thinner or wider band, or maybe a gemstone or two. John wanted theirs to be the same. Equal. He stood up and slipped his ring into his pocket with shaking fingers. He dropped the box and it tumbled over the bedsheets. He swore and snatched it up.
commenting on how Ramsay was a“mean fuckin’ bastard” before he’d light up. Sherlock drew his coat tighter. He hadn’t had any in ages, but he wasn’t totally clean by any means. He just didn’t use when it suited him. He liked to think he had complete control over his addiction, and anyway, he hadn’t had a case big enough to warrant cocaine in ages. Seb had made him want to use. Seb and his…mannerisms. It had been months since he'd laid eyes on his old dom but he was a slow healer, and the years of Seb's wounding had gone deep. Sherlock remembered the last thing the man had said to him.
“I’m not proud of that.” John muttered. “He, he was trying to calm me down. The paramedic was threatening a tranquilizer and Greg had to slap me across the face. He said if I didn’t stop acting like a lunatic that he’d cuff me and keep me from seeing you.” He hugged his sub tighter. “I calmed down enough for them to give me a suppressant and I rode in the ambulance.”
"D'you want to try this?" John picked up the red and white bottle. "Got it at work from the gift-raffle thing."
As soon as Sherlock snapped his fingers and tore everything off, John could see how much he wasn’t enjoying any of it. He wasn’t in subspace. He was hurt and frightened and the bitch of it all was that John had no one but himself to blame.
"Yes, well, in my line of work I am my own master." He threw a flirty look to John across his shoulder and John hummed, delighted. The man smiled and picked up a fresh glass of ale that was placed before them.
For a horrible moment, Sherlock thought Mycroft was disowning him, cutting him off of the family name all the privileges it provided. "W-what?" He asked.
Sherlock brought in two cups of tea and eyed the wad of lights. "The longer the length of a cable, the more likely it is to tangle. The rigidity and diameter of the cable‒or in this case, the string of fairy lights‒also affect whether or not it tangles, as well as how much the disturbance the cable experiences." Sherlock sipped his tea. "Of course in this case the tangling probability is compounded by the fact that there are bits of glass sticking off the cable every eight or so inches."
Sherlock gulped again. Sparks shot up his cock. What? What was this? John scolding him was turning him on?!
“Want to go again?” John suggested, glancing at the lube and crop. They were both shoveling the food like it would disappear and Sherlock put his empty plate down.
“Oh, something that I should have done a while ago, I think.” John picked up the cuffs and turned to him and Sherlock held his hands out. John cinched them on his wrists and the sub examined the new cuffs. They covered more of his wrist, and each one had a little bar he could comfortably wrap his fingers around. Hm. He wondered what John had planned. “Stand.” John said. He got on a chair and threw the chain up on the hook, then got down and clipped the dangling ends to his sub’s wrists.
"Yes, yes he is." His dark curls bounced as he nodded. "Like that time last week when the bloke in the park looked at me and you pulled me really close against you?"
“—Don’t tell me, ta. No,” his voice got quiet. “It was some blood play and cutting. Some asphyxiation. Some whipping—pretty hard whipping. It was all legal though. I was a member of some certain clubs that catered to…specific tastes…but not anymore. Not for a long, long time.”
“Sh, relax.” John’s hand was on his nape. “Take deep breaths.” His voice was commanding and gentle and instead of relaxing, Sherlock found he was getting even more keyed up and aroused. They were
“As long as it takes.” Sherlock shrugged. He was annoyed, John could tell from the set of his shoulders and the quick, jerky movements of his hands. He pulled his coat on and John stood up, coming to him and hugging him. He breathed in the scent of his neck, the smell dizzyingly relaxing. “Be careful.” John whispered.
“You say it’s not supposed to happen. But why shouldn’t it? You’re suffering the effects of the nightmare and PTSD. What makes you think that however it manifests itself isn’t correct?” Sherlock was glad he’d just been reading about all this. The words were still fresh in his head and far more sentimental than he was used to. “What’s the logic behind what you’re thinking?”
I’m a switch. I didn’t realize at the time that I was a switch. I thought it was my submission coming to light, or just the hormones affecting my body. My parents were both subs, they didn’t catch it. Harry is a dom but we didn’t want much to do with each other so it’s not like I could get advice. It turned out fine in the end.” John gave him the last forkful of egg and then finished off the toast. “Full?” He asked, putting the plate aside.
A sense of loneliness washed over him like a tide. Sherlock wasn’t here and Walker was dead. That’s all there was to it. He had no idea when he’d see his boy again, but he’d never wanted to hug him as badly as he did now.
They went quiet and scanned for game, looking for the low, horizontal shapes of deer among the vertical trees. They didn’t see much of anything for a long time.
They regarded the Mills board. Mills was like chess but easier. Each player had twelve pieces, either black or white. Once all the pieces were down, the point of the game was to create lines three pieces long, called "mills," while simultaneously attempting to eliminate the opponent's pieces from the board.
“Not yet.” He muttered, scribbling notes. “Though we’re not ruling it out.” He glanced up. “Sherlock, stop.”
Jim had a child. He had no idea. He’d heard rumors once of a wedding and a wife but little more than that. Did Jim’s wife—Hibern’s Queen—still live or had she been lost to some savage whim? John swallowed down the last of the water. Jim’s daughter.
The doctor grinned. Sherlock’s hard cock was pressing his thigh and his voice was breathy and filled with lust. He set the paddle aside for now and and smoothed his hand over Sherlock’s bum, feeling the warm skin and groping his round cheeks. He’d make this fun and make his sub feel good. It would be nice to infuse the room with some good memories for a change.
“Yes.” John shot up, nearly tipping the chair over. “I’ll join you. Take some painkillers first because it’ll probably hurt after.”
He took Sherlock’s cock firmly in his hand and jacked it slowly. He rubbed his sub’s balls and slid one finger up his crack.
Sherlock sniffed and looked away. “That was for an experiment. I needed to measure the rate of bruising.”
“I just, I was friends with Owen, and he used to talk about you all the time—what a great dom you were and all, and,” fresh tears sprang down his cheeks and Coel’s face softened.
and the loo, then waking up in the cabin. Sally jotted notes and Lestrade simply listened. Sherlock cracked open his water once he got to the bit about the knives. He detailed every word that Logan had said to him about his dead sub and the cancer. John took his hand, wanting to kill Logan all over again as Sherlock spoke in clinical terms about how the incisions were made to bleed a lot rather than cause pain. To weaken but not kill. Yet.
John bristled at the words. What the hell did this damn dom care? Sherlock was his and his alone. He owed the DI nothing at all, he was just a threat, sniffing around to try and take what was his.
Sherlock smiled. He wasn’t in pain, finally, and if John was here then he was safe. He opened his eyes. The room was dim and smelled of latex and frigid air con. A window on the far wall showed a dark square of night sky, the city lights in points of yellow and white. Half a florist’s shop was arranged on the table on the other side of the room. A brown sofa was beside the table and on it sat Mycroft, doing paperwork by the pooled light of a lamp pulled close beside him. His suit coat was draped over a chair and his dark tie loosened. He looked up and when he saw Sherlock was awake, he put his papers aside and came to him.
Sherlock did, hiding smile, then went out to the kitchen naked to boil water. John padded after him, dressed in his own gown, watching with a smile as his sub got a mug and a bag, then poured the water and added sugar and milk.
“And we’ll find whoever did that.” Greg jumped in and rested his hand on hers on the table. “We will find who did this.”
The table was silent, save for the sound of clinking silverware and chewing, as they all tucked in to their baked salmon portions and crispy herbed potatoes.
Soon Mike was on the sofa with a fine China cup of tea in his hand, watching Sherlock pace frantically back and forth in front of the fireplace.
“We’ll need new bathwater now.” John murmured, amused as Sherlock blushed. They stood up to shower and finish washing and John dried him thoroughly before taking him back to the bedroom. Unable to resist, he pushed him over the bed and peppered his arse with light spanks.
“You lot never do.” Sherlock murmured, staring gleefully down at the body. John cleared his throat pointedly and caught his sub’s eye with one brow raised. He didn’t like this, not one bit. The first victim that looked like Sherlock was bad enough, but two? Serial killer or not, two men had been killed and both looked a lot like Sherlock.
He went to the bathing area and did a quick rub down with cold water and a rag. Maybe he was mistaken. Sherlock had told him he didn't partake in the herana at Sherrinford. John blinked a few times, marveling at this information. Sherlock was an attractive man and rich and royal to boot. Why would he not indulge? John shook his head. What did he care of the Prince's social life? He was here to serve the guests and not gossip. Sherlock would be gone in a few days and that would be that. So why did his heart ache at the thought?
“I’ll talk to his coworkers at the garage tomorrow.” Sherlock said, remembering the address from the paycheck. He glanced at the clock on the wall. It was well past quitting time, they’d be gone for the day now. Bugger. “They might know more.” He said.
They walked over to the ambulance and Lestrade asked for a submissive medic. A man and woman came forward and helped Sherlock clamber up into the ambulance. He sat stiff on a gurney, his face pinched in discomfort as the medics efficiently peeled his coat and shirt away. One of them closed the door for privacy and Greg stood there waiting with his arms crossed. John was probably in a right state. His husband was hurt and bleeding with potentially broken bones and he wasn't even in the country. Greg thought of John telling him to take charge and keep it and the officer hoped John would have the foresight to take a suppressant before coming into his flat. He hoped Sherlock wasn't too badly hurt.
The warehouse roof was caved in at random spots throughout. A spidery string of catwalks criss-crossed the shadows above them. This place had probably once been a bustling factory. There was a second story overhang area that had a wall of broken windows facing the main floor of the factory. Big bosses likely stood up there in their cushioned offices and surveyed the scurrying workers below. No more. This place had been abandoned by humans for ages and now housed rats, cats, and strays. He stood beside a patch of dying evening sun shining through to the floor like a spotlight. Dee, also dressed in dark clothes, pulled open a purple velvet bag with gloved hands. She extracted the emerald and gold necklace and held it into the light. It sparkled.
or, goat weed. Most of the concubines used it and John figured they were fortunate to get a steady supply of the ingredients they needed to make whatever elixirs, teas, tinctures, and ointments they could imagine. Jim’s herana was a weird mix of easy access to food and medicine but access to little else. John hated it but reckoned the worst was over. He’d adjusted as well as he could to this and for the future….? Who knew? Maybe he’d get out. Maybe he’d die here. One day at a time.
What could he do for John? He did another search for different ways to please dominants and rolled his eyes at half the results. He didn’t think John would care about fluffy handcuffs and rose petals on the bed.
Greg grabbed a week old newspaper and unfolded it. He felt like he was intruding on them, even though this was his place. Sherlock was always so holier-than-thou in front of all the yarders. It was like a different person was kneeling here on the rug, looking up at John like the sun rose and set on him. Greg glanced at John. It appeared the feeling was mutual. If he could find someone that would look at him even half as sweetly as Sherlock was staring at John, he could die happy.
“Beautiful.” John breathed. They kissed and Sherlock buried his nose in the side of John’s neck, breathing in his warmth and the familiar smell of his shampoo and the bit of cologne he sometimes wore. He felt at peace in these arms and even his brain slowed to a pleasant hum in John’s presence. John found his hunch and hug thing charmingly endearing and he simply held him, enjoying the connection.
“Hold still!” John barked. He pushed him back into place and held him down and continued with the hard blows. Left side, right side, repeat. John had found that for punishment, standing up to use the paddle was far more effective. He got a stronger swing and it was much easier to control a wriggling submissive that was laying down while he stood.
Sherlock went utterly still at the horribly familiar voice. He shivered, a tide of memories drowning the happy feeling away.
Greg kicked off his shoes and hung his coat on a hook by the door. "Take my bed. I insist," he added before Sherlock could protest. "You had a gun pointed in your face, fell down a concrete staircase, and are bruised to hell. C'mon, with me. I'm not going to argue with you." He went down to the hallway to his small bedroom. Sherlock followed behind on tired feet. He hadn't even bothered to remove his suit jacket or shoes. The officer flipped a wall switch, making a little white lamp at the bedside cast a pool of beige light across the double bed. He hastily drew the cocoa colored duvet up over sheets that had last been washed at I-can't-remember-when o'clock. A few mismatched socks and some pants littered the floor and he kicked several aside. Lestrade opened a drawer and found a clean Tshirt. He tossed it on the bed. He picked a black and red plaid blanket off the floor and shook it out, then laid it across the foot of the bed.
It was nearing midnight in the palace. All the servants had gone to bed. John had woken up from one of his nightmares and he and Sherlock were now strolling the corridors, admiring the decorations: sweetly-scented pine branches, red and gold ribbons and shiny baubles sparkled in the faint candlelight.
.” There was no heat behind his words. He sounded blissed out on the pleasure of the massage. Sherlock smiled and John continued. “First the school kink and now you know massage?”
Molly paused, then sat down beside him. "I'm sorry, John." She said. She sounded sincere. "This is a hard place to be. It's not something anyone should have to get used to. Jim, what he does…he puts criminals down here, people he finds, people he buys. We're forced to have sex with strangers or be killed. We don't get paid. Sometimes people here off themselves as a way out. The place is bad and the work is mostly bad, but some of the other concubines are actually kind of nice. Kate was a prostitute Jim took off the street. She's funny. She's traveled. Has lots of stories. Danny’s a big guy, quiet, but he can sing really well. Also, some of the guests, they’re not terrible. There’s a man who comes from Britannia that I see. He’s a guard. He’s sweet, and so handsome!" She actually giggled when she mentioned him before trailing off. and John scrubbed furiously at his eyes. He was
Sherlock stood, still feeling small and wrong footed. John was going to punish him for sure. There was no way he wouldn’t.
“Dear Christ, is that an eyeball?” John squinted down at the brown iris staring up at him from a powder blue egg cup.
They got to the docks without any incident and Greg departed the carriage first. A blast of cold air hit them all in the face as the door swung open before Sally followed Greg and closed it. They did a quick visual check of the docks and personnel, each glancing an expert eye over the area for any obvious signs of disquiet. The two ships, Mycroft’s
"I didn't plan on falling down a concrete flight of steps!" Sherlock snipped back. "I didn't anticipate stairs or, or a bloody lookout."
The place had a quiet mood about it. Each table was semi sectioned off to encourage privacy among diners. The room was done up in tones of deep purple and white and little silver artsy lamps dangled over each table, illuminating them in soft light. Tiny candles flickered on each cloth-covered table and John knew instantly he was out of his depth in here. Sherlock had probably dined in a place like this before either for a case or through Mycroft or such but he was more of a ‘pub food’ kind of guy. The waiter handed them menus and John thanked him, glancing it over. Sherlock watched him retreat and dismissed him as well.
“We went to that fancy place—Page Two.” Michael looked up at Blair and they smiled. “The food was so good.”
“Blood play? Erotic asphyxiation? Worse? Knives or cutting—blood and semen—deeper down the rabbit hole? Anthropophagy? Oculolinctus?”
Still no verbal response. John dropped a bag in the water and went into the sitting room. Sherlock’s back was to the room and he was still kicking moodily at the furniture.
“The first thing I’m doing is kissing you.” John took the list and did just that. Sherlock cupped his neck and John squeezed his scruff. Sherlock kept talking when they broke. “None of them are far from the flat. I saw a couple different collar styles online that I like too.”
“Alright mate.” John pulled up another chair and put his items on the table. He opened the kit and pulled on the gloves that were inside. “Let’s have a look.” He slid into doctor mode and gently pulled at the skin around the scabbing cut on his forearm. “Not too deep. It’s a bad scrape, but you don’t need stitches.” He took the paper towel and got it wet with the water before he wiped the extra blood away. He popped the bottle of antiseptic out of the case and opened it up. “This might sting.” He said.
He made another little whiny sound and stuck his face back in his arm. “No more!” He said at the bed.
Of course he loved the crop, always had. It had been an age since he’d had it though. When he was first dating Seb, he indulged his sub now and then, but after they had got back together for the third time the indulgences had dried up. And tempting as it had had been at times, he’d never taken the option of paying someone to smack him. The thought of going back home to Seb after paying a dom at one of those clinics to give him what he wanted wasn’t appealing in the slightest, and if Seb found out, he’d never live it down. He could’ve asked his drug dealer, Lotto. He was a dom and would probably accept the opportunity to whip him in lieu of a cash payment. Stripping naked in his dingy little flat and getting whipped by the flickering blue light of the television while they were both half high on coke was a grim, depressing thought. Mycroft was a dom, but…he never let the rest of
He hummed and reached for the tea and she departed, heading straight from his room to hers to pick up paper and a pencil. She sat at her wide desk and began jotting a note for her falcon, Leopold, to deliver.
"Use that bottle." Sherlock pointed to a black clay container. John picked it up and poured some ruby red liquid into his hand.
“Get up.” John strode over to him and Sherlock rolled up to his feet, his eyes eager and bright. “Get in the corner.” John pointed. Sherlock obeyed with the merest sigh, walking to the corner and clasping his hands behind.
John gave it another dubious sniff and sipped. Apple-cherry flavored fire burned a hot line down his throat and puffed up behind his eyes. He huffed.
“The police were here just two days ago talking to me about it.” He said in a sympathetic voice. “It was alarming to have Scotland Yard’s finest show up on my doorstep,”
Sherlock had a small bow and quiver of arrows slung across his back in addition to the pistol. He was the only one who did so. These pistols were heavy and he found loading them after each shot to be cumbersome. He preferred the elegance and skill required for the bow and arrow. It was lighter and he could quickly fire one shot after another. He'd first learned to hunt with a bow and arrow and learning to aim and shoot was one royal duty he'd tolerated as a child.
Sherlock kept to himself, usually. Any diplomatic duties he did with a sense of obligation and though he excelled in strategy and diplomacy (not as much as his brother, but still), he sought out his own company not because he detested others, despite what he said. She knew that it was because it was too easy for him to care too much. He locked himself away in that fortress inside his head and kept everyone at bay. He never wanted anyone to get too close so he'd never get hurt. He'd allowed Victor to stick his foot in the door. And that stable lad he thought he had been secretive  about…
Sherlock's tone was low and depressed and John glanced at the time again. They only had a few minutes left. He eyed his bowl of white icing, ready for the gingersnaps. He bit his lip and wandered back to his counter. The snaps were cool and he smeared them with filling, creating little sandwiches and drizzling his icing on top of each before placing them on a cheerful yellow plate. He put his bowl down and admired his work, enjoying the five minutes they had left. Sherlock swore again and violently stirred his dark frosting. John looked at his bowl. He had plenty of white icing. He'd accidentally doubled his batch. A few drops of food coloring and it would be so easy to turn the white icing a perfect bee shade of yellow…
“To see what you’d do. Where are they, Sherlock? If you don’t tell me, I’m afraid I’ll have to punish you.” John raised a brow at him. “Hm?” Sherlock’s cheeks colored and he looked away. John was tickled. “All trussed up like this, I could do anything to you. Anything at all.”
Sherlock closed his mouth, his neck going pink as he remembered. John grinned to himself and handed the money over.
It was Sherlock's choice. The injuries were his own, not John's, and even though if it was up to him he would force Sherlock to go to the finest hospital in the world, in reality there was absolutely nothing he could make his sub do.
"I see." They held out their hand and John's chain was passed over. The guards left and John was drawn through the thick doors and into a grey stone entranceway some eight feet high and ten wide. He glanced about, seeing not much more than a ragged rug on the floor and another doorway to his left that lead to a little alcove with a table and a brazier in the corner. He was pulled along past this and tugged through a thick curtain draped like a doorway.
