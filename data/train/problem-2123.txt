Surprised into laughter, Sherlock felt a rush of gratitude for this kindness but took care not to let it appear as encouraging warmth. He showed Julian down the stairs to the street door and forgot about him before he’d got back upstairs to 221B, texting John and then ordering takeaway from the Thai round the corner.
sense at all?”
We might sleep, or we might not; either way, the sky wasn’t yet lightening above us and we had hours yet before it would.
I didn’t contact Sherlock again that evening, not even to explain why we hadn’t come. Day after day I got Rosie up and fed and dressed, and got her to daycare. I went to work, practised the dullest kind of medicine as conscientiously as my fractured concentration would allow, picked Rosie up, took her home. And thought about what I’d seen.
in my hand. He was loosening the bow, putting away the instrument, looking as I’d imagined him, though the shirt that framed his throat was white, not the aubergine colour of my erotic vision. He looked passive, expectant but not particularly energised by my arrival, and suddenly I decided that I was going to take him out after all. I didn’t want him to feel like a live-in convenience, waiting for me to finish my real life and come home to take possession of him, whether he would or no. I was going to show him Rome after all. By an almost full moon.
In all honesty, I was relieved. What my parents were going to say to this otherworldly siren I had no idea. Let alone what my children would say. I took Sherlock by the wrist as I rose, pulling him along into the shower.
I seemed to chronically undervalue his therapy, despite having a much improved opinion of Ella herself, and even having benefited measurably from his work with her. I resolved to listen extra attentively.
On his way back to the flat he veers into a
An indignant yelp from the mobile. “Sorry, Mummy.” Eyeroll. “I didn’t mean to curse, Mummy.” Further squawking and squeaking. “Yes, Mummy. Yes. Yes, we’ll be there.”
He chuckled extra low, and was rewarded by John’s hips rolling again over his own, slow and easy like the surf. “That’ll take a while.”
The next forty-eight hours were unutterably precious. Although Mrs Hudson was away—thankfully, since her presence would have been an immense complication—I had to be non-existent in the flat. No violin, no audible conversation, no crack in the window-curtains. John went out for his morning run as usual, and stopped by the shops on the way back, but brought back nothing more or different than he ever did, living on his own.
Once I’d have winced, thinking that was a mark that John was embarrassed about being seen to be involved with a man. Those days were long gone. He was more uninhibited, more demonstrative, with me than I’d ever seen him with any woman he’d ever dated. (And I’d seen him when he didn’t know I was looking.)
But he drew me into the guest room—should have known he’d be sensitive to my reluctance to go anywhere near their bed. He’d already laid out towels (birch) for me; he showed me to the shower, then went in to undress and get into bed. I hadn’t showered alone from the morning after he got to Bologna. I wondered whether this meant that we were going to be more circumspect, in this house and with Watson asleep next door.

“As though
My long months of being dead drew to a close more abruptly than I’d thought possible. With some delay I found Mycroft’s secure messages informing me that John was not only being followed, but had been surveilled for some time by someone in his own workplace. I left Serbia at speed and spent two days and three sleepless nights getting to London by surface transport, invisible and untraceable.
of 21 October. If he didn’t contact me, how could I know he was still alive at all? What if whoever was following me, had found him?
As I slammed the door I shouted
He was taking off his socks with a kind of sheepish smile and looking down at my legs, seemingly uncertain. Below the waist I was still completely clothed, and went into the bathroom to take care of that in short order. When I came back out he was holding a box of condoms. I was a little surprised, but didn’t say anything.
Never the same person twice. Who besides Sherlock had an anonymous army to deploy? Who would bother following me unless it had to do with him? He might actually be behind it, but I had no way to ask. I’d have to get word to him in my next song line. If he was behind it, he wouldn’t be alarmed. And if he wasn’t, he could avoid walking into a trap.
Met Gala.
Upon the whole, I prefer warmth. The only real payoff to being cold is warming up after, preferably with my icy hands and feet in John’s care. Or in a jacuzzi, or a sauna. Anywhere the heat sinks deep into the bone marrow.
Sherlock looked apprehensive, then said in a rush, “I know. I was there.”
— What? When you see me what? JW
my body.”
At this John tightened his hold and he actually laughed, loud and easy. “I don’t imagine anything of the sort. You didn’t see your face, Sherlock, or his. I did. You were as taken aback as I was, and so was he. It’s just an embarrassing coincidence. Don’t give it another thought; I’m not going to. Bloke has a right to be doing his job somewhere else besides Rome, after all.”
He was clearly excellent at prior planning, as he’d come into the bedroom equipped with everything needed for rigorously hygienic and indescribably pleasurable rimming.
He’s up there alone, I’m down here alone. What if this is it. I look back over every time I’ve fallen asleep with him, woken up with him. It’s all in the Mind Palace, every delicious habit, every variant. The morning I was sleeping with my hand palm up on the pillow between us and woke up to the sensation of his cheek, the weight of his head, settling into my palm. The first time I discovered that John tastes even better in the morning than at any other time of the day. The middle of the night when he accidentally woke me by pushing gently, then thrusting, between my thighs and even sleeping, the smooth slide of him against my bollocks was enough to make us both come. What if none of that ever happened again?
In bed they settle into one of their usual positions with Sherlock staring at the ceiling and Roberto curled around him. They say nothing at all, the silence louder than the uproar in the restaurant. Roberto caresses Sherlock’s shoulder and neck with a tentativeness that makes Sherlock feel guilty, and then irritable; to cover this he makes a distracted, appreciative humming sound, but turns to face the wall. Eventually they fall asleep.
Needless to say, reading the detailed report listing the visual inventory of the injuries was a surreal experience that flattened me again. Stomach-turning and soul-destroying. What hadn’t been broken in Sherlock’s fall would make a shorter list than what had.
. I should have shut down those questions altogether.
“Do I know them?”
What he knows without my saying is that sometimes I just want to concentrate on this, only doing, only feeling, watching, hearing, smelling him. He understands and lets me have my way, arouse and adore and admire him, my hands everywhere I can get them, stroking a nipple so lightly he thrusts upward for more pressure, or brushing along his perineum until he groans, or slipping a thumb into his beautiful mouth, or cupping his luscious buttocks to pull more of his cock into my mouth, or pushing a finger so slowly, so tenderly into him that he loses his breath and his words. And by the time he comes I am as aroused as he, as eager to receive caresses as I had been to give them, my skin as flooded with sensation as if he had been touching me all along.
Why was Sherlock seeing his old dealer, enabler, at Baker Street? What was he handing over to that bastard? Money? What the
But the awful cases—the crimes against children, the crimes against humanity, the murders so brutal they made even Sherlock go still—those, we kept on the other side of that membrane. Impermeable, we thought, until the day it wasn’t, the year Rosie turned eight. But in her babyhood, her little-girlhood, we mostly succeeded in preserving her innocence about all that.
, and Sherlock was groaning “Perfect, you’re perfect,” as he began to stroke their cocks together hard but slow.
I nodded, knowing we’d be talking about Rosie sooner or later, and for now I had just one more question about Zanardi. “What did you tell him, the night you read my letter?”

In the event Sherlock didn’t seem to want to discuss his reading. Or to talk. Or to look at me. When he did look up, he wasn’t there. At all. He’d retreated behind a thin but impenetrable film of ice. Subtle, but unmistakable.

“That’s enough, Mycroft.” I had no intention of letting Mycroft put Sherlock out of countenance by publicly dotting every
I slide under the covers where John’s been sleeping since we got back, so I can be on his side and smell his scent on his pillow. I take the lube from the drawer and put some on my hand to warm, then smooth some on my arsehole, pushing a finger inside, startled that it feels that good. But I detest the sticky, tacky feeling of the product on my hand, especially for what’s coming next, so I wipe it clean with a damp flannel.
Greg’s kind face creases into smiles and he says, encouragingly, “Good man. Sometimes you just have to dare, don’t you? Sometimes you just have to take a chance.”
My voice was unsteady. “He’s keeping it secret.”

I got up to pull him over to the bed. I had to be touching him when I said this next bit. Got him to stretch out, propped against the headboard, so I could huddle in and finally, after all this time, put my arm around his waist.
“Where were you? What were you up to?” Again with the nonchalance. I should just have admitted I was curious: he almost always told me where he was going.

All in all it was more like a group effort this time, which was all to the good: more buy-in, more enthusiasm; more likely that August would come, and that everyone would donate.
For a long time, that is. There were ups and downs, of course. A clamorous argument the very month we moved in together, that I thought would break us. An episode or two of quite unjustified jealousy. The occasional fallout or backlash from John’s (I thought excessive) determination to probe every psychic wound he’d brought with him into our present. (He did therapy in earnest; I did not.) But for the most part, nothing above the trivial. We were solid. Until the day we weren’t.

Though his words were ferocious, his voice was almost flat. And here I’d been about to say the same thing to him: to ask him not to leave, at least; I hadn’t planned any threats.
The puppies were a surprise gift from our daughter.
I was pulling his shirt out from his pants, leaning down to kiss my way down his throat, licking into the hollow and along those glorious collarbones. He was opening my belt and trousers, pulling out my cock,
“You’re the one, all right. You’re the one for me. You’re the one I’ve been dying to do this with, wake up next to. And now I am. That’s me ecstatic, then.”
Sherlock’s right hand still hangs at his side, his head still bent, eyes fixed on the floor. An uncomfortable minute passes, then he sighs and lifts his head. John catches his pale stare and his stomach clenches, seeing this silent, motionless turmoil, and he tries again.
Mine was never a theological faith, in any case. I placed my faith in reason; in empirical science; in a rule-governed universe. Never in a god, and only occasionally, and selectively, in a human being.
“What?” She looked both wary and game. It was Donovan’s best face yet. I was surprised to find myself pleased that she was back to her old self again after this conversation, which couldn’t have been an easy one for her.
He smiled politely at John. “I’m glad to see that violence was not necessary, Doctor Watson.”
That second Lucinda Williams song was an inversion of the first. Instead of surveying what the dead man had lost, it recalled everything he’d taken away with him, taken away from the world.
He wondered why there were no signs of a busy workday spent at home with microscope or petri dishes or tissue samples.

John hung back discreetly since there was what he thought of as “band-stuff” to do, set-up and sound-check. He was much nearer the dais this time, so he’d have a fine view.
“After the big trafficking case wrapped up in 2016, I was reassigned. I had my pick of cases, in intellectual property piracy, tax evasion, and money-laundering. I’ve been concentrating on cases connected with big money, high social status, high visibility. Last night was a very high-profile arrest. It required a glare of publicity, lots of Finanza in uniform, media coverage, and resulting public humiliation for a prominent drug manufacturer.”
The first evening we put her in her cot, though, I found her toy box full of primary and princess colours. She’d had her elephant with her, but she was pathetically cheered to be reunited with her purple dinosaur, and yellow duckling, and the rest of the plushy menagerie. She spent an hour cuddling with John, and even with me. When I held her again I was too moved to say much but “Watson,” and “there you are,” over and over as though I’d been searching for her for months. After John bathed her she settled down into a dozy kind of haze, looking at him and saying “Da,” and at me, saying “Ba.” Which was a little eerie, when I thought about it.
Meaning:
“Regrets. The ... nothing, just, regrets.” I am trying to learn candour, but honesty may not always be the best policy.
That was the most painful part. I knew I was right for Sherlock, that I could make him happy. I could remember when we were happy, though never in any romantic or sexual sense. I’d no right to object to his new lover, but by God it was agony to imagine them together—and I couldn’t stop myself doing it. The images flooded over me like a choking tide. Sherlock was

He gave me that sharp-focused stare that means I do indeed have his full attention. Raised his eyebrow. Waited.

“Of course, John. Senior officers always get taken care of in accordance with their rank.”
Although at the moment thinking of any kind wasn’t much in evidence. Somehow we got through the door and over to the bed; taking stock, I discovered that Sherlock’s jacket was already gone, his shirt buttons undone, his belt hanging open; my jumper last seen on the kitchen floor. Wait. Shoes. Fuck, socks. Skin—fuck,

I hadn’t asked him. I was seconds away from begging him
What we were to each other was instantaneous and non-negotiable, but that didn’t keep it from also being painful, precarious, and at times utterly terrifying. How much misery did we inflict on ourselves and each other by trying to deny what was obvious to everyone in our orbit? Neither of us had the courage to risk losing any part of the other by caring
I never wanted to leave him behind, to think me dead. It was, however, the only way to guarantee his life, and fortunately he’s not suspicious enough to doubt the truth of that particular magic trick. Doubting me was a reflex he had never acquired, though for his own sake he should have done.
Next up--thanks to the fic writers who helped me think this fic through at the summer 2019 retreat--John's take on all this.
He hummed an emphatic affirmative. “I’d have gone mad without it. I knew that the first morning. So Roberto sent me to an instrument maker who loaned me a very fine violin, from 1700 or so. I played so much I got decent calluses back, and I played music I didn’t, couldn’t, associate with you.”

I wondered what in the world he meant. In what way had he felt he was mistreating Zanardi? It didn’t seem as though I could ask, though. He’d shut me down. I let my hand wander down to his navel, the lovely soft hair trailing down from it. Diverted, at the last centimetre, to his sharp hipbone.
We did have a very pleasant three days, with Sherlock doing the cooking and John keeping the fires burning. (I may never get the smell of woodsmoke out of my favourite tweed jacket now, and I have left it in the country.) I merely contributed some bickering, a few childhood memories John had not yet heard, and the occasional intervention to preserve “order” in some hard-pressed part of the world. My retirement is proving very difficult to preserve; I appear to figure as the mandarin on call to the current generation of functionaries. I was, nonetheless, able to write quite a few pages on my History, to complete the notoriously difficult year 2020.
When he began to weep, choking on these words, Sherlock gave Donovan a glance and took over.
I balked at that. “First,
of it late on February 22nd. It was in a cover envelope with Mycroft’s writing on it.

Just the words ‘eyes only’ irked me to the point that I buried it under my socks and went back to playing.”
He’s always loved snowflakes. The idea of them: intricate, symmetrical, each one utterly unique. The shape of them: not square, solid, sturdy—but elongated, elegant, exquisite. The color of them: only apparently white, because crystals are prisms and will release all the colors of the world when the light hits them right, when the light is properly
But the hard fact was that Wiggins was a symptom, not the problem. Sherlock was alone and under-occupied, and that was always a dangerous combination. Boredom and isolation. He claimed it threw his brain into frantic overdrive, though I had my own theories. If this hadn’t come up I’d have moved back into 221B with Rosie in a heartbeat, if he’d asked us; but now I couldn’t move in with her for the very reason that Sherlock needed me to: the danger of relapse.
” My voice now was much less neutral.
“Yes, you are.” I kept my voice even, with just a hint of steel.
A heightened sexual energy was building as well. John became aware of the bare feet beneath his thigh and lightly raised a hand to Sherlock’s knee and left it there, waiting. He thought he heard an intake of breath.
In the weeks before Christmas John stopped by Baker Street once or twice with Watson, and on Christmas Eve Sherlock was invited over to John’s flat along with several other people. He decided to go to his parents in the country instead. He’d already given John and Watson his gifts, to be opened on Christmas morning, and he doubted that watching one of John’s female neighbors flirt with him over eggnog and baby toys would contribute significantly to his happiness. When he’d finally declined, John had seemed disappointed but hadn’t pressed, which in turn had disappointed Sherlock.
“He’s a missing person. David Strong. Works for a Toyota plant up in Durham assembling cars, didn’t come home three nights ago. The tattoos were part of the description his girlfriend gave the police, so when the local bobby called it in to the Met, he turned up in the database right away. Thirty-eight years old, formerly in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.”

The light increased exponentially inside the temple as the moon sailed slowly into the oculus and illuminated the faces below. It was solemn, this combination of the timeless and the natural on the one hand, of the ancient and the architectural on the other. Our ancestors built a receptacle for the gifts of their gods—water, light, air—and eighteen hundred years later a thousand fortunate descendants gathered them in. I memorised the flawless arc of the moonlight moving around the coffered ceiling of the dome, to keep it in my mind palace for permanent recall.
“I want to hear you say it. Please. I’ve wanted to hear you say it ... for so long.” His words are pleading, but his tone is commanding. Git. He knows I’ll always do what he wants when he says it in that low rumble.
— Posh?
“Sure, just need to get my fiddle.” When had it become natural to call it that?
“You weren’t?” Honest perplexity and relief competed on Sherlock’s face.
It was certainly a surprise—well, a shock—when Sherlock took up with that Italian officer on secondment from Rome. It did sting, a bit, since I’d figured that Sherlock loved one person only, someone I couldn’t replace no matter how hard I might try. But once I saw that particular light come into his eyes, over someone who wasn’t John—that shattered my illusion that it was only one person, one man, I couldn’t compete with. And when I saw Sherlock’s eyes narrow and drop to this Roberto like he was walking cocaine, I had to admit that it wasn’t only one person,
John read the card, large and creamy and deluxe as Italian business cards could be, turned it over to read the scrawl on the back, then handed it to me.
“Well, could be worse. It’s not Tristan, after all. Or Terence.” Sherlock’s voice was vague, though, as though his mind was elsewhere.
clear as mud.
“You’re welcome. Thanks for the hospitality.” I made my tone amused, but low. John gave the kind of start that pitch almost always provokes.
I consider answers like “make me,” “Very well, Your Majesty,” or “All Ye Faithful.” But perhaps it isn’t the moment for levity. He might want soothing, or he might want stimulating, and sarcasm wouldn’t promote either.

Outrageous. He knows
But his body was tense, growing tenser even, and I wanted to see his face, kiss his mouth. I wanted the rigidity to melt away again, back into the fluid conformity of the two of us touching everywhere, our limbs in easy interlock. I lifted my right hand to his face, ran it over his jaw and throat, felt the slight stubble I knew he was going to shave the second he got up. Best feel it now, then. I was running my fingertips slowly over his right ear and into his hair when I heard him gasp.
John is trying much less hard to keep his voice down, so I stop pretending I don’t hear him, and turn and smile.
And his large hand settled over John’s, and tightened on it.

When I got to the morgue, I found, along with Molly and Sherlock, this eerily Sherlock-like shadow. An Italian copper had been seconded to the Met, and was seemingly joined to Sherlock at the hip. Taller than he was, dark hair shorter than his and shot through with grey, a trim beard, on the slender side like Sherlock, and very poshly dressed. I hated him on sight.
) affirmative and was surprised to receive a cordial invitation to lunch for the following Wednesday. Before confirming, he googled Julian St John Ashford-Warrington, and was surprised to find him quite young for such a prestigious position, no more than thirty-five.
I could hear the smile in his voice, but what he was saying wasn’t a joke—it was a revelation. It would take some thinking about, too. So John wasn’t jealous, because he knew that I loved him and only him. Therefore, if John became jealous, it would be because of how I was behaving, not someone else, some imagined rival. Did that mean that I was responsible when he was jealous, and he when I was?
“Only a dozen?” He gave a small smile. “You underestimate yourself.”
I assumed he was projecting, and said so. “Is that how you felt about it yourself? That losing me was worse than never having known me?”
Sherlock looked my way, and something in my expression made him flush and look away again. What he saw, I was sure, was precisely what I was feeling: desperate love.
John can see Sherlock turn to look at them, as Donovan’s voice has risen and sharpened in her sarcasm. He says hastily, “No, no, of course not. Here, let’s go have a sip of something, toast your conversion.”
But that was a persuasive strategy, not an analytical one. It would be a good argument if I were trying to convince someone else that all was not as it appeared in Sherlock’s death. But I wasn’t. I was trying to find out for myself.
Confusion about the will meant it was time to recap, see where things stood. Before pulling out the nuclear option.
“Yep.”
Six months after I jumped, Mycroft contacted me about John.

The following Tuesday I got home late, absolutely flattened by a day of GP-ing: half the staff out ill and twice the usual number of patients, all apparently stricken with the same flu. My dearest hope was for an evening in with Sherlock, an order of Indian takeaway, and the lamest action film I could find to watch with him. I was

The line was, alas, prophetic. In early October I arrived in London and reclaimed one of my bolt-holes (grown excessively dusty in my absence). I tuned the radio to “Sunday Evening 6 p.m.” to hear John’s message.
“Hey, hey, slow down there, you’re frozen right through. Why don’t you have a hot shower: it’ll warm you up.”
“Okay, good, because I can’t... we can’t go back from that. You’re stuck with me now. —But listen: explain something to me. Last night you said you’re attracted to people you care about, and I care about people if I find them attractive. Right? Well, close enough, anyway. But if you found me attractive the day we met, then it

Sherlock knew he wasn’t really needed for the sting at all. After he’d solved the copycat murder, and Roberto had been called in because of the ongoing Interpol investigation, he’d expected to back out of the case and stay out. The players in the ring had been identified, and sweeping them up in the net had required not Sherlock’s skill set but rather three weeks of massive surveillance and coordination among a set of agencies with different stakes in the outcome. But Roberto, his motive all too clear, had asked him to be there at the dénouement.
immediately, damn him, and the object of my affection wasn’t even on the scene. He looked me up and down and said under his breath, “Eye make-up, Sally? And those stockings? Who is it? You didn’t dress up for the victim.”
Sherlock nodded. He looked pale again, under the, well, stubble burn.
His mouth twisted as he said, “I didn’t think you’d want me teaching her Italian.”

“Sex,” I mumbled into his neck. “I don’t have vows for you.”
We turned in early, a bit disconcerted by it all. Until Sherlock turned on the music low and undressed me to the lilt of Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong singing “I’ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.” And indeed, with him beside me, “what did I care, how much it may storm?”
“Thanks,” John said, rising. “Thanks.” He took her hand and shook it. “You’ve been great to talk to.”

“Dull,” Sherlock had said. He was never going to forgive her for abandoning me and Rosie. “Who’d have thought a top-flight assassin would die from eating

Bombastic? Paternalistic? Benevolent? That’s our boy. But appreciative, too: Rosie won’t have to beat him about the head and shoulders with a cheap umbrella, at least. And verbose? His History is going to make Edward Gibbon look laconic.
“I understand that. I do. After she shot you the first time. But the weeks and weeks of being high off your tits last summer—that was after Mary died, and that’s not on her.”
That was unacceptable, so Sherlock reached out to touch John’s shoulder, cup his neck. “It’s just that I don’t want to hurry.”
He usually has a physical map of Rome spread out on the kitchen table. His knowledge of the city is thus determined by what is contained in that image and in his memory. What lies beyond the map’s area—the exurbs, the countryside—may as well not exist. He doesn’t go there (hic dracones).
Those glass-green eyes, the wounded stare—then Sherlock was shaking his head vigorously. “Again, no, John. I wasn’t … laughing out of anything but nerves, and embarrassment at interrupting, and not knowing what to say to you, and realising …

Mrs Hudson’s absence was well-timed; the sitting room in Baker Street would be their rehearsal space for the week, and there was only John to be driven spare by the intricate, intermittent surgery of suturing Will back into Caherdaniel’s songs and sound.

“Got it in one. This is the outermost of what I am reliably informed is a system of planets orbiting the star
They reach the house after ten, too late to light a fire, and it’s cold and damp enough that the sitting-room is unwelcoming. They turn on heat in the bedrooms, using electric mattress-warmers to dry and warm the beds, and have a last
The gorilla looks stunned. He wipes blood off of his face and shakes his head as if to clear it. He finally seems to come to his senses and notices Lestrade’s ID. “Hey! You copper!” He points at John. “This man just assaulted me!” John is making no effort to hide the fact that he is rubbing his knuckles. Sherlock looks nervously between John and Lestrade. The last thing he wants is for John to get an ASBO because of him.
“I’ve got you, I’ve got you. Oh look at you, God, if I could come again I would just looking at you now.” John’s arms are still around him and he shifts both of them, gently rolling Sherlock onto his side. But Sherlock is still shaking, overwhelmed, trembling with the enormity of what has just happened. He doesn’t realize that he is crying until he sucks in his breath in a ragged sob.
The noise and chatter of the bar abruptly fades and Lestrade and several other of the Yarders step forward. Chief rowdy gorilla’s buddies hightail it out of the bar.
Sherlock lets himself be drawn down again so his face is tucked against John’s neck. John is absentmindedly stroking his hair. Everything he has ever wanted had been handed to him, but he can’t quite believe that it’s all real.
Angelo helped Sherlock out of his coat and whispered, “It’s more romantic this way.”
Sherlock nods but avoids John’s eyes. He’s not sure that John knows that his relapse had more to do with his despair over John’s wedding, than trying to get Magnussen’s attention.
John tucks the blankets around them, and lets Sherlock tuck his face under his chin. He strokes Sherlock’s back soothingly, murmuring gently until Sherlock’s breathing steadies and calms. John shifts back to peer at Sherlock and softly wipes the tears from Sherlock’s cheeks.
It’s the chief rowdy from the bar. Behind him his buddies are looking nervously at each other. Sherlock gets to his feet slowly and carefully; he is aware, that with as many of the Yard present as witnesses, he will have to take a punch before he can defend himself. He’s about to open his mouth with a string of vicious deductions about the man, when suddenly John is at his side, looking at him with concern. In a glance, John assesses that Sherlock is unharmed; he turns the full force of his gaze on the man who assaulted Sherlock.
The sky opens up with a roar of thunder. It goes from nothing to torrential in seconds; both Sherlock and John are soaked to the skin and suddenly whooping with deranged laughter. They both slow, the urgency of the run lost now that they are both drenched. The rain is gloriously cool and refreshing and John’s clothing clings wetly to him. His black t-shirt is so wet; it looks like he is dipped in oil. His laughter is genuine and unabashed. He looks more happy and relaxed than Sherlock has seen him in years.
Angelo’s? 8pm? JW
“For what? Another night of pining? A night of staring at an empty chair? Oh god …” Sherlock covered his face with his hands and took a deep shuddering breath. Had he ruined everything? Could he hope that John might just pretend he had never heard Sherlock’s confession?
Sherlock considers his answer. He could lie of course, and in the past he might have, but he knows now that he can count on John, and if they are to go forward in this he must hold nothing back.
“Kate and I are just tying up a few loose ends and then we’ll be heading back to South America. We’ve gotten into the business of helping people disappear; it’s proven to be rather lucrative. We have a lovely safe house in Punto Del Diablo, if you should ever have need of it.”
“Look at you,” John murmurers heatedly. “God, you’re gorgeous.” His eyes roam hungrily over Sherlock’s body and the look on his face makes Sherlock shiver deliciously. John is smiling as he guides Sherlock towards the bed. The soft flickering candlelight seems to make johns skin glow warmly and catches the golden highlights in john’s still wet hair. He lies back, and pulls Sherlock on top of himself, guiding Sherlock to crawl between his open legs.
“You ok?”
“He’s not my colleague,” John said. “He’s my date.”
“Oh for God's sake, Irene!”
He starts backing up towards the bedroom drawing Sherlock along with him. Along the way they begin to pluck at each other’s wet clothing, snatching increasingly heated kisses as they stumble down the hallway. John slows them as they reach the door, easing heated frantic kisses to slow soft ones. With feather light fingertips he takes Sherlock’s face in his hands. He take slow deep deliberate breaths until Sherlock begins to match his breathing.
“You wanted to be a good father, a better father than yours was.”
Donovan is the one to deliver Lestrade's round of drinks. As she passes Sherlock his gin and tonic she catches his eye and smiles at him, flicking her eyes to where John is still absentmindedly rubbing Sherlock’s back. Sherlock wonders if it is possible for his face to get any more red. He somehow manages to avoid her gaze and school his face into a neutral mask.
Sherlock scowls fiercely. Donovan cannot possibly be serious. He snatches up the rest of his drink and gulps it down in one swig. “He married a woman. ‘Not gay,’ remember?” He’s just starting to get drunk enough to not care what he has just revealed to Donovan. She looks like she’s about to say something else, but Sherlock ignores her and catches John’s eye. He lifts his empty glass and mimes getting John another drink. John grins at him and nods and Sherlock slides carefully off his stool.
“You still haven’t told me what it is that I’m getting ready for.” Sherlock retrieved his shaving kit from the bathroom cabinet and began to lather up his face. At that moment his phone pinged.
… because he has no idea how long he will have these moments with John, and he wants to savor every one that he has left.
This is exactly the kind of tedious social event that, at one time, Sherlock would have avoided like the plague. He drains his glass and considers going to the bar to get another when a fresh gin and tonic is placed at his elbow. Sherlock glances up and frowns at Donovan.
“Your Army doctor is out having his mild sexual identity crisis, but it is a mild crisis, Sherlock. He’s been thinking about the two of you as a couple since our conversation at Battersea.”
“Hey, hey, what is it? Are you alright? Sherlock?”
“I’m going to thank you?” he cried incredulously.
They both drink.
"I wanted to meet her," Sherlock breathes. "I wanted to meet John's daughter."
“I’ll keep that in mind, but I have no intention of faking my own death again,” Sherlock grumbled into his tea cup.
Sherlock let the towel drop and slid on the black briefs, he looked at himself in the mirror. The shower and shave had made him feel better and Irene had done a proficient job. It was a good thing that she was there to help him shave because his hands had been shaking so badly that he surely would have cut himself.
“I did.” John swallows thickly and takes a breath before continuing. “And then she shot you. I wanted to leave her—but I wanted to do what was right for the child. But I couldn’t do it. I couldn't keep faking it. Sherlock, the week before Moriarty came back I saw a lawyer. I was going to ask her for a divorce, and I was going to beg you to let me come home. So no,” John shifts back so he can look Sherlock in the eyes. “I don’t miss her. I felt awful after she died, not because I lost her, but because I was so relieved.” John’s voice begins to crack, He sucks in a ragged breath. “My only regret…” Sherlock’s throat closes watching him; the pain on John’s face makes Sherlock’s chest ache. “The baby… My daughter.” John takes a ragged breath, swallows thickly as he blinks back tears. They curl close together, seeking comfort in each other’s touch. Sherlock strokes John’s back and hair and listens quietly as John slowly gets his ragged breathing under control. They lay together, the flickering candlelight painting artful shadows on their skin. As their breathing calms and slows, Sherlock hears the continuing rain outside.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Irene. She did know what people liked, but she couldn’t possibly be right about this.
Sherlock’s head snapped up and he stared at the open door to the flat. He bolted to the staircase, and raced down to the landing just in time to see the front door close. He gripped the handrail to steady his shaking.
“I suppose I should.” John says. “But I don’t. Even before she shot you, the cracks were showing. Do you remember the morning we found you in the drug den?”
I’ll see you at eight. SH
“I…no. No one seemed worth the effort.” Sherlock’s face flushes with embarrassment and finds himself cringing away from John.
There is a brief discussion about the ignorance of the gorilla while more drinks are consumed and another game of darts is played. The evening winds down without further incident and John and Sherlock leave the pub to find their way back to 221B.
“He’s waiting for you,” Angelo said conspiratorially. He held the door open and Sherlock took a deep breath and stepped into the restaurant.
“He’s doing well.” Donovan says, nodding toward John. John takes his shot and laughs. His score is woefully below Lestrade’s.
“I love you, I love you, I think I have always loved you,” Sherlock whispers against John’s mouth. Their foreheads press together, breath mingling as they trade gentle kisses back and forth.
“Are you quite done with your strop?” she asked.
“Yeah, I’m here, I’m not going anywhere, I’ve got you.”
Of course John would pick that moment to arrive.
John didn’t feel that way about him and he would hardly notice the extra care that he had gone through to get ready, he would never notice that Sherlock had chosen his favourite aftershave, and he certainly would never see the damn silk pants.
Despite the storm and the power outage, Sherlock feels warm and utterly safe.The warm glow of the candles is briefly interrupted by a flicker of lightning and in the distance there is a low rumble of thunder. John’s breathing slows into the rhythm of sleep. Wrapped in their comfortable nest, Sherlock lets the steady sound of John’s breath draw him down into slumber.
Sherlock is startled by John’s hand on the small of his back. “You alright?” John asks. Sherlock can only nod. It’s still hot in the pub and he hopes fervently that John will blame the temperature and the liquor for the flush that Sherlock knows is painting his cheeks.
Sherlock blinked at Angelo for a moment.
“Oh yes of course!” Sherlock barked. His voice steadily rose as he spoke and his words came faster. “That will just go over swimmingly! Yes Irene, how do you think that my friend, my straight male best friend, will deal me blurting out, ‘Oh by the way John I am in love with you, always have been actually’. Everything I’ve suffered for the past five years had been for you. Jumped off a building? Got tortured in Serbia? Killed a man in cold blood? Got on a plane to head to my certain death? Yes! All of it for you! I’m gay, by the way, I don’t think that ever came up in conversation! How exactly do you think that would go over, Irene?”
There is another flash of lightning and the thunder this time is so loud that Sherlock can feel it in his chest. His laughter dies abruptly and he stops in his tracks.
“That would be boring. Besides I’m here to help you get ready.”
John’s hips buck up to meet Sherlock’s thrusts and suddenly Sherlock cannot help but writhe against John’s slick belly, grind against his hard cock. John groans, his head thrown back exposing his neck, his hands vice-like on his hips urging Sherlock’s movements. He meets Sherlock’s every thrust with his own.
Angelo stood in front of him with a knowing smile on his lips.
A small treacherous part of Sherlock’s heart leaps at John’s comment. He was fully expecting John’s usual ‘Not gay.’
“Yes, Sherlock Holmes. I think the love of your life has just asked you out to a romantic dinner and I think it’s about bloody time. If you play your cards right, by the end of tonight none of your arch enemies can ever refer to you as ‘The Virgin’ again.”
“Anything you want, for you and your colleague on the house!” Angelo beamed.
Sherlock pulls back enough that he can see John’s face. There is pain and regret there, but it is not directed at Sherlock.
“I believe that is what you are getting ready for,” Irene said, smiling. Sherlock sighed and picked up the phone.
The sight that greeted him took his breath away. John, dressed in an impeccable dark grey suit and a royal blue shirt, was just standing from a table for two in the center of the room. The shirt brought out the deep indigo blue of John’s eyes and Sherlock was so mesmerized by the sight of him that it took him a moment to notice the rest of his surroundings.
It never comes.
John, lovely John, draws him closer sweeps his fingers along Sherlock’s ribs trailing along the edge of Sherlock’s wet trousers.“Let me,” John murmurs.
After a long silence, John speaks one more time. His voice is growing muzzy with sleep.
“Do you want this Sherlock?” he asks. “We don’t have to do anything tonight...”
Sherlock can feel the build, the fire gathering low in his pelvis, spreading up his spine. Beneath him John’s movements become erratic.
Sherlock brought the tea tray into the sitting room and placed it on the small table in between the two chairs in 221b. He folded himself elegantly into his chair and slid forward so that he could serve his guest tea.
— I do not. You're the one who craves excitement. SH
And so it began. John, who’d never been able to keep up with the world’s only consulting detective (“
He kneels and dries Sherlock’s ankles, lifting first one foot and then the other, taking his time because the view from here is really quite breathtaking. The soft skin over what’s sure to be an achingly hard erection. The elegant tracery of blood vessels just beneath the taut, shiny skin. He presses a kiss into each inner thigh, and Sherlock suddenly comes to life, tugging at John to bring him to standing, hauling him still damp back into the bedroom, onto the bed.
for commenting! If comment-grubbing sounds ... grubby, let me just say that I learn more about writing and about each fic from reader comments than you would even believe. I realized after posting that the murder-suicide pact comes straight from apliddell’s unforgettable The Only One in the World; I Invented the Job (https://archiveofourown.org/works/691284/chapters/1270251).
He sensed Sherlock closing in slowly, putting out a cautious hand. That was all it took to finally break, to pull him in close through the explosion of old grief, and convulse in laboured tears.
“So on Thursday evenings he just comes home late and sweaty?”
Mycroft announced that on the second floor of the building opposite his agents had found a body with two bullet wounds, one in the back of his neck, the other in his right temple. He turned his phone screen in my direction. I leaned in to see, and breathed again.
“Never been happier to be outclassed,” says Greg, grinning at John. “Sherlock never fails to surprise me, but Donovan—who ever knew? And Sherlock and Donovan
So Sherlock bent down, slowly, giving John a chance to move away if he wanted to. Though really there wasn’t any reason to hesitate now; if John wasn’t of the same mind, well, the worst had already happened, they’d lost each other. It would make for an uncomfortable thirty-six hours and then they’d never see each other again, or not for years, which was ... exactly what would have happened had John never come.
That worked so well that I started doing it most mornings, and we had a dance or two most evenings. A week later I picked out another Conte, one I was fairly sure he’d know: “Sotto le stelle del jazz.” When it got warmer we could dance outside, under the jazz stars; for now the sitting-room would do.
— If you think of something later, do text me. Thank you. SH
He should try. Obviously.
As if Sherlock sensed it, he pushed me over, gently, onto my back, pulling himself over me and making me look him straight in the eye. “I don’t mind,” he said. “Whatever we do, however we live. Under a bridge, as you said. Surrounded by pink and purple plastic baby toys. I don’t care, as long as it’s with you, and Watson. —I’ve missed her. More than I let myself realise. I may not be able to be a full-time parent proxy, but I don’t want to do without her, either.”
But as he talked through his thinking, I realised he had really foreseen most of the potential problems, and had kind of pre-solved them, if he could get the right help. Which was where I came in. I was what he needed: a flashy partner who could deliver a show-starting display that would make everyone else relax about their own dancing.
“Whatever. You sound rattled. I prescribe a session with the scalp massager.”
seeing him again, and on our honeymoon, no less. I knew we should have gone to Sicily.”
Tried to compose in his head. Surely he could do that, in silence and stillness. But the sounds pulsed through his body, through his veins, pushing against his bones, his joints. He couldn’t stop the pain, no it was just an itch, no it was agony.
“No, no, I know. It’s dicey. Smartest man in London did the stupidest thing in the world with the Culverton Smith case. Don’t want to make him feel like the idiot he is, right?”
That ought to teach me not to pigeonhole John. He'd managed to find a line so dark it made me laugh out loud in a seedy coffee shop, drawing attention to myself when I really should not have done.
He’d probably met up with someone. Met someone. Chatted someone up.
“And how are you so ... um ... sure that it’s the same with me? You were disconcerted to see Roberto, and displeased, but you weren’t for a moment ... jealous.”
happy.”

It worked, at least it’s worked so far. Clara isn’t living with Harry, but they’re trying to rebuild their marriage. Harry’s been mostly successful with sobriety, and I’ve never seen her this motivated before.
In your letter you wrote that you only realised you'd been hoping I would stay, when I left you to go back to Mary. Just a few hours afterwards you shot Magnussen in the head. Is that why you shot him? I wonder now if it was. What you said that night always sounded so stilted to me. “Give Mary my love. Tell her she’s safe now.” Rehearsed. God knows I’ve heard your voice saying those words in my head a thousand times, no matter what the doctored recordings say now. Did you commit murder (suicide?) because I went back to her?
This is a hermetic universe, which for a few minutes a day has only two inhabitants. They don’t even need names.
His tone was challenging; meanwhile Sherlock was deliberately absenting himself from the conversation, looking ostentatiously through the autopsy files fanned out on the counter, and I felt wrong-footed.
“Thanks to your excellent teamwork, Sergeant Donovan, Sherlock, the CPO now has what they need. The security breach which resulted in Heather Simpson’s death has been sealed and Mister Simpson is safe. We have new information about the
— Oh yes it was.
“That’s what John thought you would say.”
I knew he’d want his turn but I couldn’t wait, I was too close, I pushed my cock between his thighs, trying to avoid his oversensitised bollocks (shame, I loved their texture against my erection). I pushed the eager head of my cock up to surface between his inner thighs, felt the hot water pulse over it, and pulled back into the delicious pressure as he squeezed his legs.
bedroom) to pack up his grip. Three to four minutes later he’d stride past the door to the sitting room, pound down the stairs calling “bye” or “later” or some equally off-putting farewell that fairly shouted “don’t ask me anything.”
“It’s amazing how the right undergarment can give you confidence. Besides, with any luck your date might have chance to admire your undergarments.” She triumphantly pulled out a black silky pair of snug fitting briefs and waved them at Sherlock.
Sherlock sucks in a ragged gasp, surging up to capture John’s mouth in a kiss.
Sherlock lets John help him out of his trousers and pants and peels John out of his soaked jeans. John’s body is firm and compact, his generous cock curves up towards his belly and Sherlock longs to touch it but he’s not sure what is allowed. He struggles not to cover himself self-consciously. He’s too thin, too scarred, standing in the middle of his bedroom with a ridiculous hard-on in front of a perfect golden god.
“Go get him tiger,” Irene grinned at him.
"Take your time Sherlock, and be thorough,” she purred.
“Oh, don’t look at me that way, I didn’t poison it,” she snarls.
“So what brings you back to London?” he asked.
Sherlock slowly comes back to himself with John crooning gently in his ear.
“Am I?” Sherlock tucks his nose against John’s neck. He smells John’s soap, the rain, and the tang of sweat from their earlier exertions.
Donavan’s lips quirk in a not-quite smile. “I’m not talking about the game.” She pauses, and glances at Sherlock. “It’s been what? Four months?”
With a grin, Lestrade and Donovan drag the sputtering man away.
“We’re not a couple.”
He looked at her skeptically, but he remembered that day with startling clarity.
"Sherlock!"
“John! John! John!...”
Donovan smiles. “No sir. I didn’t see a damn thing.”
When had John wrapped his small strong hands around Sherlock's biceps?
“Sherlock Holmes. I know what people like, and your army doctor likes consulting detectives.”
“I didn’t say you were.” Donovan says. Her tone is gentler than he would have expected. “I’m just… I know what you went through. The two of you saved London from a bloody madman… and I know you suffered for it, both of you.” She fidgets nervously with her glass.
With a sinking heart, Sherlock approached the door and saw the small hand written sign taped to it.
“Oh yes, you wouldn’t want to upset him, would you,” Irene said smugly.
“Humm... yes. Tell me, what’s going on in that big brain of yours?” John asks.
"You know I didn't see you at first, at the funeral," Donovan says. "I saw them bringing in Mary’s coffin and I wondered where the fuck you were." She swallows thickly and continues. "I thought to myself 'how dare the freak be John's best man, but not stand by his side at his wife’s funeral. And then I saw you carrying that tiny coffin." Her voice breaks and she looks away momentarily to compose herself. "I have no idea how you could see through your tears."
“You would have made a good father, Sherlock.”
This wasn’t a date.
“Are you so sure?” Irene said looking at him evenly. “Have you even spoken to him?”
Sherlock shudders at the feeling of the John under him. Warm, firm body, so much skin to touch, and then John’s mouth is on him again, kissing his neck and jaw. Their mouths meet in gentle pecks and deeper sips. John’s hands drift down his back and he draws his knees up to frame Sherlock’s slim hips between his thighs.
“You’re looking well,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock sighed. Good lord, did the woman never give up? “I have no interest in having an ‘impolite’ conversation with you Irene, you know that.”
“I’m not going anywhere,” John murmurs. He’s smiling again, that same warm smile that John gave him in the pub. That smile, Sherlock realizes, is reserved just for him.
Sherlock nods takes a deep breath. “So long, John… So long I’ve wanted this. I never… I never thought you felt the same way.”
Aside from him and John, there were no other customers in the restaurant and every other table had at least half a dozen flickering candles of various sizes scattered across their surfaces.
“You’re thinking too hard,” John rumbles.
“Well I am. Look at us both.”
Before they have traveled far, there is a flash and the ominous rumble of thunder. Fat cool drops of rain begin to pelt them. They look at each other, realising that it’s unlikely they’ll get home before the rain starts in earnest. Foolish grins break out on their faces; they start to run, hoping to make it to 221B before they are completely drenched.
“You’re going to thank me for this, Sherlock.”
“Yes. Yes, John, you have no idea.” Sherlock is still shaking, and he feels like he might just rattle apart when John takes his still wet hands into his own, somehow warming him, thrilling him, and calming him at the same time.
“You heard me,” the man answers casually. “What? Are you the fucking poofter’s boyfriend?”
Sherlock blinked at his phone for a moment.
“I’m not gay.”
“Sherlock, I’m not going anywhere…What is it? What’s…”
No plans. SH
Sherlock stomped up the stairs, muttering darkly to himself as he pushed past Irene. “Of course not. Why panic? Why would I possibly panic? It’s not like the only friend I have ever had has just heard my utterly pathetic love confession and is, as we speak, running for the hills. No, why on earth would I bloody well panic?” He walked across the sitting room and threw himself dramatically into his chair.
“Sherlock, what is it?”
“You thought what was going to come out then?” Sherlock asks, his face is nuzzled against John’s neck.
It was eight o’clock. Compulsively punctual, John would have arrived at least ten minutes ago, and Sherlock had not received a text or call telling him that Angelo’s was closed.
“You’ll go.” Sherlock interrupts. “You’ll find another girlfriend and leave me and I can’t…I can’t-”
“What on earth are you talking about, Sally?” Sherlock snaps. “He might as well forfeit the game; he’ll never catch up to Lestrade.”
“Yes you are.”
“Yes… I mean no, I… I’m fine. That, that thing that you did…that was um. Good.”
The entire way that the evening has turned has left Sherlock reeling and he knows that he is blinking stupidly and trying to process, but he just can’t seem to stop himself.
“And two sugars please.”
“Fucking poof.”
Irene helped him into the Belstaff and walked with him down the stairs to the pavement. She adjusted his scarf and he grumbled and half-heartedly brushed her off of him.
“I’ve had too much to drink.”
“Do you miss her?” he asks.
“Oh, I’d almost forgotten,” Lestrade says, “I brought a cold case file if you want to have a look at it Sherlock.”
Oddly, a curtain was drawn across the large window. There were dim lights within, but there was something too quiet about the popular restaurant that should have been packed with diners at this time of night.
Sherlock looks at him blankly for a moment. He feels like his brain is still offline.
Not Mrs. Hudson.
He dressed carefully and opened the door. Irene was waiting for him in the hallway. He gave up trying to discourage her and let her lead him back to the bathroom where she applied just the right amount of product to his still damp hair and teased it into luscious curls. When she was done, he stood in front of his wardrobe mirror and admired her handiwork. The deep red of the shirt made his skin look luminescent and brought out the contrast of his dark hair. All of his suits were expertly tailored and this one was no exception.
Sherlock scowled at her darkly. A bloody shower was not going to fix this. However, it was gone past five and he hadn’t showered yet. Irene stood and made her way back to John’s chair.
“What the hell are you grinning at?!” he snarled.
John’s hands slide down Sherlock’s back until they rest on Sherlock’s hips, guiding him, urging him to move. Sherlock swoops down to capture John’s mouth in a searing kiss. Their kisses deepen as they explore each other’s mouths. His hands are in John’s hair. Heat builds between them and sweat breaks out across their bodies adding to the slickness between them.
Sherlock’s silence makes John turn to face him. He can feel the rain plastering his hair to his skull, and the cold clinging of his shirt against his skin. He knows his eyes are wide but he can't stop himself from staring. He has no idea what John will read in his expression.
Sherlock is mortified by his own stammering, his face is flaming but John just smiles and pats Sherlock’s back. It makes Sherlock feel warm and cherished and he knows he would endure the wrath of a hundred bigots if it meant that John was there to smile at him like that.
It’s an unusually hot day for London and the air conditioner in the pub is having a hard time keeping up.
Sherlock opens his mouth and tries to speak, but nothing comes out. Concerned, John steps closer. “Sherlock?”
He doesn’t quite know what to make of the look that Lestrade and John share. “I don’t think you’ve had nearly enough, not after that bit of nonsense. I’m getting you both another round.” Greg is already heading for the bar.
“Now let’s pick out an outfit,” she said breezily and walked into his bedroom. When Sherlock had caught up to her, she had his wardrobe flung open and was rifling through his clothing. She pulled out his newest silk shirt. It was a deep blood red undershot with black and he hadn’t had a chance to wear it yet. He knew that it contrasted well with his pale skin. He pulled out his current favourite black suit and turned to see that Irene was rummaging through his pants drawer.
"You have no idea, do you?" Despite the sound of traffic around them and the ongoing rain Sherlock clearly hears John’s low voice. His confusion must show on his face and John’s expression softens. He feels John’s deft fingers slide into the wet curls at the nape of his neck. Even though he can see the kiss coming he is still surprised by it. He is unaware of how chilled he has become until he feels the heat of John’s mouth. The kiss is sweet and gentle and Sherlock feels like something warm and glowing is expanding in his chest, pressing against his ribs.
The bartender—who has clearly had just about enough of the antics of the gorilla—grins at Lestrade. “He bloody well has been. I’d say it’s high time for you to head home, you fucking prick.”
“Come on then.” He steers Sherlock back to the table that Lestrade and John were sitting at in between shooting darts. Anderson, Dimmock and several of the other Yarders intercept them on their way, they clap John on the back for his spectacular punch. Anderson of all people asks Sherlock if he is alright.
“John…”
The man that John is addressing is taller than Sherlock and easily twice as broad. It almost looks absurd. Small, compact John staring down this gorilla of a man.
He said nothing as he rapidly texted:
Lestrade, with exaggerated movements, pulls his ID tags over his head and drops them into his pocket. “Barkeep!” Lestrade yells, “Has this bloke has been disturbing the peace?”
“Don’t you knock?” Sherlock muttered.
She laughed and flung the pants at him. “I’ll let you get dressed.” And she left him to his own devices.
John moves closer to him and slides his warm hand on to the small of Sherlock’s back again. Sherlock cannot quite suppress a shiver. “You Ok? We can go home if you want.” John’s voice is pitched low only for Sherlock’s ears. He turns to face John and is surprised by how close John is. He can smell the beer on John’s breath and wonders if his mouth would taste of hops and malt. He knows that he is staring at John’s mouth for longer than is strictly appropriate and it takes a monumental effort to drag his gaze to John’s eyes.
Donovan looks at Sherlock and something flits across her eyes that he can’t quite identify, sadness and empathy and determination. They are emotions that Sherlock is not used to seeing on Donovan’s face and he’s waiting for her usual derisive scowl.
Sherlock huffed. “Obvious. Erica. Heather.”
Clearly I was supposed to fill in the blank, and I did: I groaned and covered my face with one hand. “For theorising in advance of the data.”
At least he didn’t pretend he didn’t know what I was talking about.
He winced. He’d known my questions were going to be harder than his, more painful; after all, he’d texted me and I’d come, immediately. I’d gone back on my decision to leave him permanently. When the trial period was up, after reading only John’s letter and three short and identical texts, I’d come; there was still a lot I needed to know.
Just after noon he decided to sit, more because the landscape had reached new heights of beauty than because he needed rest. Though if he had another two or three hours to walk, he needed to stop now and dip his feet in the streamlet a hundred metres off the path, cool off the hot spot on his right heel before it could turn into a blister.
Sherlock.
“I’ve been thinking that it might be good for Rosie to start school in the fall, you know, Reception, instead of waiting as we’d meant to until first year when she’s five and a half.” I found myself rushing a bit, an invariable tell for nerves.
Somehow John’s already there with me. How does he do that? It’s uncanny. We’re kissing as hungrily as if it’s been years, not hours, since we last did so, and suddenly John pulls back and says,
To which I shot back, on May 27th,

“Far from a professor; I’ve never taught anyone anything. Particularly not if we’re to judge by the near-total incomprehension of my associates at the Met, and even of my partner. They marvel at the cognitive processes and ignore the empirical foundation.”
married, but the problem is that I’m head over heels in love, and it isn’t with my wife.”
And as though he’d been waiting only for that, only for me to ask him, he said in a dead, bleak voice:  “You want Watson to go to school because you don’t want her to grow up like me.”
And if it was not a suicide—was it even a death?
—that their owner was at home.
playlist, then. My own cynic. Do
She tried to smile brightly, but her gentle eyes looked sad. “You’re moving on,” she said bravely. “You’ve met someone.”
Morning sleep after morning sex may well be Sherlock’s favourite thing in the world. For John’s sake he would even admit the appeal of breakfast.
And thinking of what I’d seen made me feel dirty and rattled and at some level betrayed. Sherlock was certainly trying to get clean, but at the same time he was seeing Wiggins, and I couldn’t think of a legitimate reason for that. I knew I should just ask him. I can’t take Rosie to 221B if he’s using again; bad enough Wiggins had already drugged her once
Damn, he’d forgotten his phone was on silent, and now there were two missed calls from an unknown number and three texts.
I wondered whether I should worry that he was so meticulous in his answers. If only lies have detail, as he used to say, was he being deliberately evasive? Distracting me from something? I set that thought aside; we’d had enough distrust. And I’d come to Italy determined to keep a tight leash on the jealousy that’d been torturing me all month.
I jerked, an automatic dismissal ready, then stopped. Thought for a moment. I loved a man who couldn’t experience emotion or sensation without ratiocination. Without anxiety, for that matter. He’d been alone for so long, and I’d hurt him so deeply. I couldn’t afford not to hear him now, just because I thought he was being the tiniest bit premature in burying our happiness.
, far as I’m concerned.”
Fair enough. I stopped.
This case was different. There were people in and out at all hours, not just Watson, John, and Hudders, but Donovan’s junior PC Chantal liaising with Donovan in the incident room at NSY, Mycroft once or twice, Lestrade once, Donovan on video conference twice daily and incessantly via text. There was an incident wall like Donovan’s over at NSY, but for the Will Simpson case. Will’s brother even came to 221B to be interviewed (it was John who remembered to cover up the murder wall before he arrived).
went along with it.”
“Did you like it that he’s taller than you?” Sherlock probably wondered at the abrupt change of topic and tone—there was laughter in my voice.
“Eeeee—there was more.” He bumped Sherlock’s arm with his shoulder, stopped him. Turned to face him, then moved in for a completely unexpected full-body hug.
— What are you on about?
John giving the nearly empty Gallerie dell’Accademia the patented John treatment for museums: breezing past twenty works of art only to examine one outlier for six or eight minutes. Whenever I quiz him on it, of course, he’s forgotten most of the details. He sees, he enjoys, but he doesn’t
800 metres up, only 200 to go. We give each other great grins when the view opens up, small smiles when we’re maneuvering between rock walls and can’t see much besides each other.
A moment or two while the man inside considered whether it was true, whether he would ever be safe again, with his entire world destroyed. Perhaps he decided it no longer mattered. In any case, after a couple of muffled clicks the manual door of the lorry rumbled open to reveal a visibly exhausted blond man with a hopeless stare.
I did try, with Roberto. Once while he was cooking I came up behind him at the stove, wrapped my arms around his waist and lowered my head to his shoulder. Not quite comfortable; leaned my forehead against Roberto’s spine, then. I wanted my arms to feel full, I wanted to feel full. I only felt empty. This wasn’t what I expected. It wasn’t completeness; romantic entanglement hadn't completed me at all. John was wrong.
I'm glad if you're enjoying the lower angst-level of this goofy fic--thanks for all the lovely comments.
But the one area where there’s no daylight whatsoever between me and the British Government is what Sherlock likes to call his drugs “use.”
Be careful what you wish for, they say.
What John said made sense. I’d never looked back on my time with Roberto with nostalgia, or fondness, let alone regret that I ended it. On the contrary. Roberto’s love—need, even—only made me feel intensely uncomfortable and vaguely guilty. I had tried, honestly tried, but the more he wanted me, the less I wanted him; and I ended up feeling as though I’d used him, when it certainly hadn’t started out that way.
I rang off and went back inside the bar to Valentina, who was looking more hopeful than when she’d accosted me so tentatively outside of headquarters. Perhaps she’d just needed a listening ear—or an ear she thought was listening, since I wasn’t entirely sure I’d caught even a rough outline of her case and its details. I’d retained only the call I needed to make the next morning, to press a lab director who owed me a favour to fast-track a blood sample analysis for Valentina, to save her precious time and pointless floundering.
Still, it was terrifying. He was about to whisper “May I?” when John surged up and kissed him, and all of Sherlock’s senses were flung wide open. He’d never known he could burn in every inch of him, hear John’s breath and his murmur, his own heart pounding louder than the wind in the stovepipe. If he had known, he’d never have left, not ever.
So, flustered, wrong-footed, wild-haired: there I was. At least I no longer reeked. But still I glowered at myself in the mirror.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and his voice went silky, always a bad sign. “How so?”
John. Left John to reach orgasm on his own, untouched by the man he’d been indulging for God knows how long. And then, to add insult to injury, he had
“What is it? Did I—” John sounded equally panicked.
“That’s not my definition of a good evening—making me want to work all night.”
“Shhhh. Relax. Not that. Not you, at least.” At this John, with some effort, glances around confused and looks his question.
And he didn’t. They were all on fire. The visitors who’d come hoping for “authentic Celtic music” weren’t disappointed; the locals, who’d been watching for months as the group coalesced, were over the moon.
I could have asked for nothing better, and gave him what I hoped was a reassuring smile.
Thanks to the Fic Writers Retreat 2019 members who told me that Ch. 5 and 6 were flat-out necessary. They were right.
Or rather, it swung between tedious and exasperating. He’d been unable to settle on the best expository sequence, and John’s offers to help had made him uncharacteristically nervous and self-conscious. Sherlock might scoff at the blog, but there was no denying that John was a writer and knew instinctively the clearest way to convey information.
Then I went into the kitchen to turn last night's shopping into a breakfast as nourishing as the night's exertions.
