What people don’t seem to realize is that Sherlock’s powers of deduction aren’t so much an involuntary ability as they are a learned skill.  Yes, Sherlock’s parents have had his IQ tested and yes, it’s very high.  Yes, he’s much more observant than the average person, and it’s not that he can’t keep his mouth shut but that he just doesn’t see the point of doing so.
“You’re awfully quiet,” she whispers in his ear, “it’s not like you…”  And then she trails off and starts kissing his neck.
am I gonna learn that you NEVER BUY MILK WHEN YOU SAY YOU WILL?”
He stands there, by the slab, staring at the bones of this once-human, wide eyed and empty.  He had been Sherlock’s age, a little taller than him, his weight, he even had the same high cheekbones his mother loves to run her thumb across.  This skeleton, this man, he is a mirror of Sherlock, of what Sherlock could become.  Another nameless corpse whose flesh and organs have been thrown away in bags marked HUMAN WASTE.
John heaves a heavy sigh as he comes back to the present moment.  That queasy feeling he’d been fighting back rages in his stomach and he takes another large gulp of his scotch.  He notices his hand is shaking and doesn’t understand what exactly his problem is. John has been in war, he’s been in battle.  John has thrown grenades and shot automatic rifles and amputated limbs on the battlefield. John does not scare easily. So why such a visceral, physical reaction.  He’s been close to death more times than he can count. Why is this time so shocking to him?
John stares wide eyed into space and feels his heart start beating almost painfully in his chest.  Because that’s what you do when you love someone.
Because that’s what you do when you love someone.
So one night, after sneaking into the morgue to examine how eyeballs deteriorate after death, Sherlock finds a skeleton that Molly has only partially completed putting together.  Her interns cleaned the bones nicely, but judging from the precision of their pristine condition, Molly finished the job.  Sherlock realizes the skull isn’t connected like he thought, and picks it up to examine it closely.  He can tell Molly’s taken care of these bones; even when the flesh and meat and brain are gone, Molly still thinks of them as people.  Sherlock processes through the bones of the face as he examines it.
And so Sherlock doesn’t take drugs anymore.  At least he tries not to.  Now he drinks six cups of coffee a day and wears three nicotine patches at a time and relishes secondhand smoke and tries not to think about that rush of sunshine shooting up his arm and down into his body.
“Well, Sherlock!?  Speed, coke, what!?”  Lestrade knows getting angry at Sherlock won’t do any good and he instantly regrets raising his voice at him.
John sighs sharply and knows he won’t be getting an answer out of Sherlock any time soon.
Lestrade first met Sherlock five years ago when he brought him a case shortly after being made detective inspector.  Sherlock had seen the body of a woman who’d apparently committed suicide, according to the coroner.  But Sherlock wasn’t buying it.  He investigated as much as he could until he was satisfied he knew what actually happened: the woman’s younger brother had killed her in order to be the sole claimant to their mother’s fortune.
“It looks real.”
“I am?”  Sherlock asks.
Sherlock also remembers the day they put him down.  He remembers he begged Mycroft to make Redbeard live forever.  Mycroft refused.  He told him, “Nothing lives forever, Sherlock, least of all your dog.  Caring is not an advantage, baby brother.”
“You are, Sherlock!”  Mycroft yells in frustration.
Later that night, Sherlock drinks his chamomile tea and watches crap telly alone and wonders what John’s doing.   He wonders about the woman he’s with, what she looks like and how she sounds.  He wonders if John really does like her or if he just wants a shag.
Instead, Sherlock barks, “Why are we talking about this?”  John looks over at him, that blank expression changed into one of anger and offense.
,” she coos, drawing out the first syllable.  “You really can’t have been a virgin like Moriarty said you were, not with skills like that.”  She’s just talking to hear herself talk at this point.  “You really do love him, don’t you?  You should tell him,” she advises, like the way a girlfriend tells another to just ask out the man of her dreams.  “I think you could make John a
“No, I just wanted warm butter.  It slipped off and fell inside.”
“I’ve done it before, you know,” John says, finally breaking the silence.  Sherlock barely acknowledges him, only glancing slightly over to see that John is staring up at the ceiling.
Sherlock studies John as he stands in the corridor of their flat, anxious and afraid.
“Failed experiment then?”  John says, his voice dripping in sarcasm and frustration.
win, Sherlock.”
“Yeah,” John starts as he picks at his pan fried noodles, “has it always been classical music or was there something else?”
Moriarty laughs hysterically.  John tries to blink out S-O-S in morse code to Sherlock, but he’s obviously not receiving it and John feels so completely helpless in this moment.
John laughs and goes back upstairs to his room.  He’s back in a few minutes with a fresh shirt and not smelling so badly.  Sherlock knows he’s there, but he’s still curled up into the back of the couch.  John makes a small sound and Sherlock pretends not to hear him.
“A cup of tea, do you want one?”
John’s moans become more hurried and suddenly, in Sherlock’s mind palace, John flips him over and tells Sherlock not to move.  He stares as John works slowly down the length of his body and it’s torturing him because he just wants John to make him come already.
Sherlock remembers, years before he met John, when he used to inject cocaine when he worked on a case.
Like, John tries not to bring his girlfriends home to stay overnight.
John buries himself in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, not bothering to roll off him or even pull out of him.  Sherlock, in turn, wraps his arms around John, cradling him like he’s something precious to be protected at all costs.  John burrows there, inhaling the scent of
Nothing’s working though.  No matter how mundane or incidental, his erection is still pulsing and pounding and painful.  He fidgets in his seat because Irene is now nuzzling his cheek and he knows it’s only a matter of time until she notices, if she hasn’t already and is just milking the moment for all it’s worth.  He starts replaying painful memories hoping that’ll do the trick.
“No,” he states sharply.  He doesn’t move from the landing of the stairs.  John throws him a sympathetic look and opens his mouth to coax him into the flat.
Sherlock goes into the room marked JOHN HAMISH WATSON, 10 MARCH 1975 and starts to catalogue and index the entire terrain of John’s face so that he can go back to this every time he filters conversation or is bored or is having his second cup of coffee or is laying in bed and can’t sleep.  He memorizes this so he can remember a time when John was peaceful and safe in his hands and even sighed at the feeling of Sherlock wrapped around him and leaned into it because he couldn’t get enough of it.  John can never return Sherlock’s feelings so this will have to do, an elaborate lie of a memory where John is cognizant of what information his body is feeding to Sherlock and fully aware that Sherlock is in love with him and not only ok with it but encourages it.
“No,” Sherlock says, looking around the restaurant for something other than John to focus on, “it wasn’t always just classical music.”
Mycroft once called him unapologetic.  One of the times he dumped him in a fancy rehab.  He said Sherlock was an unapologetic little prick who didn’t care who he hurt in his quest to hurt himself.
“Do I have a choice?” John asked grimly.
John scratched his eyebrow. “Okay, perhaps I need to be cruder. Before we met, I was, for lack of a better word, a slag. I don't want to get there again. Regular sex: yes. Danger: no. I am lucky that I don't have any STIs or any scars from some of the stuff I did. And furthermore, I don't want to shove that aspect of my life onto you. You are not into sex, and I don't want to make you uncomfortable.”
Trust me, please.’
John nodded, and Greg fished out a new mobile phone.
“I feel like I'm in a Bond movie,” he said, but he did as told.
Greg just nodded. “Well, he usually works with the dead, no tact is needed there.”
Slowly a plan formed in his head.
John was happy. After three years of not being happy, it felt brilliant. He was back at Baker Street, he had cases with Sherlock, and a very flexible part time job that allowed said cases at crazy hours. And he finally had sex again. After the disaster with Mary - assassin on the run, trying to hide behind a new identity - Sherlock’s return, a lot of shouting, alcohol and smashing things he felt close to normal again. The constant grief and vigilance was no longer there and he could concentrate more on his needs again. Two month ago, in a sitting with his therapist he had realized something that cemented his current status of well-being. He wanted to be in Baker Street with Sherlock as long as possible and share his life with him. And that meant he would no longer pursue relationships that would take him away. Therefore he had given up dating. Or better, he would not take up dating again.
John startled awake again when his mobile chimed. He had gotten it back this morning. Greg had it debugged and wiped it of potential spy software. Two hours had gone by. Sherlock hadn’t returned yet. But his sessions at the hairdresser always took some time – especially now, if Sherlock wanted his hair dyed back to black.
Despite some confusion, Greg understood most of the content instantly: Sherlock didn't jump because of low self-esteem or harassment, but to save his friends; including him. Greg forced some steadying breaths trying to settle his stomach. He took a sip of his stone cold coffee to chase away the taste of bile on his tongue.
Sherlock threw a short glance at John and the papers in front of him. He knew instantly what John was talking about.
1. Take off your clothes and put them all (!)  in the box including shoes, watch, underwear, belt and mobile.
“But like you,” Sherlock continued, “I did some unsavoury things while using and I am glad that I don't have to endure any lasting effects of my endeavours. Since I quit drugs, sex is no longer that appealing. Sometimes I go out for an occasional grope and a blow job at a club, but my brain is very selective, what's attractive. Someone being dull is the worst mood killer that can happen to me. But I am neither celibate nor asexual. I just don't engage often.”
After some slow and sensuous kisses, John started to undress Sherlock who helped him. He felt restricted in his suit and stripped till he was naked. John still wore his bathrobe, but the fabric felt so soft, that Sherlock didn't mind. Sensuously they rubbed against each other basking in each others warmth. John softly pushed him onto the bed and Sherlock willingly let himself fall. John chucked his bathrobe to the floor and joined Sherlock.
Moriarty just grinned and continued. “John, John, John, you naughty boy. You killed Sebastian, my most loyal man. Haven't taken you for someone to collect trophies. I took the freedom to retrieve Sebastian’s jacket. It's vintage, you know. I bought it for him,” he purred. “But back to business. Because our dear detective refused to die in the first place, I now need to kill you - a deal is a deal.” He grinned insanely. “So sorry,” he whispered. “And don’t worry. I will take care, that Sherlock mourns you – but not for long.” With that, Moriarty vanished and bolted the hatch shut.
The whole time, Sherlock's thoughts whirled. This was an unusual behaviour. Never before had something similar happened. Usually John's girlfriends stayed till morning and he offered them breakfast.  Or John had sex elsewhere and came home late. Somewhere in his mind an old behaviour lecture of John popped up, where he told Sherlock, that throwing out a lover after sex was a ‘bit not good’.
Greg hesitated, but there was no point to not follow the invitation. He slid into the backseat of the car. In front of him sat Mycroft. They met three times before: Once, when he found Sherlock on the streets after an OD, a second time in an official capacity during a peculiar case and the last time at Sherlock's funeral. Additionally they had talked over the phone sometimes, always about issues regarding Sherlock.

John dressed and repacked his backpack diligently. He took out his fake identities. His own was already completely done. For Sherlock he needed to choose a photo out of a portfolio that came with the ID kit. It needed to be as close as possible to Sherlock's appearance. Mycroft hadn't known who he had needed to retrieve, and had therefore given him a wide array of photos to fit into the prepared passport with the name Ian Miller. The biggest problem had been the eye colour on the passport templates and the photos. He had had to choose between blue and brown. The ones that fitted best were a gaunt lad with reddish-brown hair, glasses and blue eyes, and a dark haired guy with brown eyes. The other photos were too different. Either Sherlock had to wear contacts or they had to dye his hair. He was too recognisable after all the press coverage of his suicide, too. Before being able to make a final decision, Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, dressed in a chequered button down shirt, blue jeans and converse shoes.
Molly had been waiting for that. She stepped out of the shadows, taser raised and ready. The moment Moriarty acknowledged her she had found her aim and pulled the trigger.
“Well,” Sherlock said, and pulled some handcuffs from the pockets of his coat with a flourish, “my magic trick includes friends and people that we overlook way too often. Homeless people, women like Molly, Anthea or Irene; add to that friends, lovers, brothers.” Sherlock had one knee at the back of Moriarty and tightened the cuffs. The skin on Moriarty’s hands was squeezed painfully within their confines. Molly stood beside him and grinned stupidly.
His first impulse was to tense up, but he soon relaxed again. It felt okay. If felt right. If Sherlock wanted to use him as a pillow, he was happy to comply. This was better than anything else he had experienced in the last weeks. He stayed like that for another five minutes and enjoyed the calm that had settled over him. Unfortunately, his bladder called for attention. He slowly peeled himself out of the embrace, causing a small grumble from Sherlock's lips. John grabbed his backpack and silently tiptoed toward the bathroom.
I should add more tags, but I don't want to give the plot away.
Last weekend, he had hit an all-time low, wanting to end everything. He didn't want to think about that either. He hadn't stopped working since then, except for short naps or awful snacks. The inflow of patients on the A & E was at an all-time high, and every available doctor was pulled in. It somehow felt like war again. Therefore he was exhausted, emotionally and physically drained. On the other hand, the additional money was welcome. Just tedious locum work would not help to cover the rent on the flat long-term. But his money running out was a problem for another time.
Molly stepped onto the street. She stopped the next cab coming toward her and climbed in.
(See the end of the chapter for
The more Greg read and thought about it, the more wretched he felt. He had enough psychological training as a police man and boss to know how important acceptance and also praise were to every human being. Ridicule and isolation led to despair and depression. Were he and his unit part of Sherlock’s decision to jump? Was Sherlock’s self-esteem really that low despite his show of ego? John had told him once, shortly after Sherlock's jump, that his last eye-to-eye conversation was made in anger. John took it hard, that he called Sherlock a 'machine'. He blamed himself, that his words might have been the final straw.
Tears were gathering in John’s eyes. He turned away from Sherlock. Sherlock stroked his back soothingly.
“I don’t know,” Molly answered. So far, she hadn’t thought about that option. She had tried to block any thoughts about Moriarty after the horrible dating episode. So far, she hadn’t met him again.
John huffed out a breath. No rest for the wicked. He gathered his leather jacket – John no longer thought of it as the sniper's jacket - and left for New Scotland Yarc. In his hurry, he overlooked the cab that had just stopped outside of Baker Street and Molly stepping out. He turned at the corner and entered a small alley.  He realized to late that he wasn't alone in the usually abandoned street. Before he could react, he felt the impact of something blunt on his head. Everything went dark and he slumped to the ground.
Sherlock huffed. “I am fine. I have my doctor with me.”
He arrived in Ostrava on Tuesday evening to a beautiful sunset. The final rays of sunshine were the first he had experienced since November. London had been clouded in rain and fog since Sherlock’s jump. He hadn’t really registered the absence of sunlight in the last months, but now he realized that he missed it. He basked in the light till the sun vanished below the horizon. Some of the tension that had accumulated during the last few hours vanished from him. He still felt gritty, so he first visited a public loo and refreshed himself a little bit.
“Usually I would say no, but after all this, I make an exception.” the cabbie unlocked his phone and handed it to her. Molly dialled 999. There were no options left. She had to explain the whole situation to some operator. The problem was that even she didn’t know exactly what was going on.
Out of the blue, John muted the television. “Listen,” he started.  “I don’t know if I should tell you this, but I need to get rid of something. It’s not like I can hide anything from you anyway, I just want to avoid any misunderstandings.”
John looked up at Sherlock. “Brilliant. How did you come up with that?”
The next morning, John and Sherlock slept in. They had breakfast and then got picked up by one of Mycroft’s drivers. Like they had planned yesterday, John retrieved the sniper rifle and the bullets from John's bolt hole. After that, the driver dropped them off at a private shooting range in the outskirts of London. They were the only guests there.
John passed some of the time with reading newspapers and browsing the web on his new phone. There was nothing of interest. Just the usual gossip about stars and royals – especially the Arab prince and his adventures were a current favourite of the yellow press. But there was nothing about increased crime rates. Even Greg Lestrade was puzzled, that the press didn’t report about the more than usual criminal activities.
Five minutes to the start of mass, Mrs Hudson dutifully appeared. He observed her from the shadows. As he suspected, she met up with two friends, more interested in the social event than praying. They chatted for a few minutes. John needed to get the letter to her without much commotion. He checked the crowd and the street once again. It seemed nobody tailed her. That was good. There was the risk that the old sniper had already been found and replaced. But John counted on the paranoia of killers: the sniper would not want to leave a trace, avoid regular calls and disguise his locations. He wouldn’t be missed yet. If he was lucky, the sniper wouldn’t even be missed in the long run. He had talked about a vacation.  At the moment nobody would find the dead sniper by chance. The apartment had been empty for over a year now with nobody taking care of it. Only when the corpse started to smell then someone in the building would start an investigation.
Sherlock blinked, swallowing a lump. “When?”
“I don't know.” John said. “But if I had to guess: Moriarty.”
“John,” she said, waiving around a hair pin. “I was the wife of a drug lord. You need a certain skill set for that.”
With that, he pulled his phone out of his pocket and hit speed dial. He turned around and gave some commands in Czech to his captors. While the man retreated down the corridor, Sherlock could hear, how he ordered the death of his friends.
They agreed that the important things would have to be moved downstairs, and the lesser used clothing including disguises would be stowed upstairs. Also the desk would also stay upstairs, in case one of them needed a quiet working space. John’s bed stayed, too, in case they ever had guests overnight. The bedside table, however, would make a nice addition to the master bedroom. John was currently shuffling a chair away from the bed, to gain some space for the small furniture.
Sherlock and John left the office. Mycroft still had some work to do and stayed. He watched them leave. They didn't bother with personal space anymore he noted. Not that there was a lot in the past, but they now acted more like one unit than ever. Mycroft just shrugged and returned his attention to his files.
Kudos & comments are appreciated
'To whom it may concern,
Sherlock felt his panic rising again. Remembering his therapist’s words he didn’t shove it back, but he allowed it, trying to feel for the roots of the panic, all the while breathing deeply. Danger of a new Mary? Jealousy? No, he thought. After some moments he could name a cause that felt right. The panic stemmed from the fear of John walking away, the fear of being alone again and  losing the happiness, he found so recently. But there was more. The root of the panic attack was a longing for things he never dared to hope for but now surged through him. He wanted closer companionship. He was envious.
He was near a tube station on Jubilee line. He had to switch lanes on Baker Street anyway to get to St. Pancras, so he stepped out there and looked for a familiar face. Sherlock sometimes had pointed out his contacts of his homeless network. He desperately hoped that they would help him now. He was lucky. There was a woman he recognised not far away from the station entry. He scribbled a short note, pinned it and a 50 pound note to the parcel and gave it to the woman.
The cab driver looked at the meter. A horrendous amount had accumulated.
John put his almost empty plate on the table, picked up his wine glass and settled back into the cushions, gaze fixed on the moving pictures of the telly.
He rifled through the content. The phone didn't have additional security. He saw some photos of Mrs. Hudson and him. The landscapes and pictures of children were not relevant at the moment. He would look at them at a later date. The mails on the phone were signed with S. Moran. The e-mails were few, but they proved that the sniper was hired to shadow him and at a later date to shadow Mrs. Hudson, too. One sniper had been retracted to do business in Eastern Europe. He put the phone on flight mode, to avoid detection. It had to stay on and powered, otherwise he would need to unlock the SIM-Card with a code. Maybe he would need the phone later.
“Well, Dr Watson,” he continued, “would you be willing to help me out here? I can’t give you a proper risk assessment, but you are a trained soldier and should be able to help yourself.  You should still have a gun from Greg. I can furthermore provide you with papers for two fake identities, medical supplies, a safe house and some funding. Of course I will pay you for the endeavour in the end, too. If something goes wrong, I try to help, but I can't promise anything.”
“Sherlock?” John enquired through the door, just as Sherlock started the shower.
‘No. Not at the moment.’ After hesitating John continued typing. ‘How can we keep in contact? It is quite a hassle to sneak in here. Ideally something, where you already check often, and someone who monitors you won't get suspicious.’
After twenty minutes, the van turned left on a small road that was closed to the public. They had arrived at a rundown industrial area by the Thames that had its prime shortly after the Second World War. Now according to the improvised company signs only some import-export business had remained. Some shabby cars lined the streets.
Sherlock startled. “No, I just thought, you had a guest.”
“You are clear. Sorry for the inconvenience.”
Yesterday, unbeknownst to John and Lestrade, Sherlock had visited Nick’s boyfriend. Mycroft had been his usual meddling self and procured a grant from a small foundation that supported young musicians. It wouldn’t replace Nick, but it could help him to find his purpose in life and overcome his grief. Again, Sherlock had to admit, that Mycroft was good to have around.
John broke the silence. “Let's pack. It's time we get back to good old London.”
John stayed late into the night and continued his discussion with Molly via the computer. Molly assured him, that some keyboard typing way at this time would not be suspicious, if someone was listening in on her.
Sherlock chuckled. His eyes roaming over John's body, trying to deduce even a miniscule hint about  his past. “Well, there is always something.”
Sherlock looked up, his face insecure. “Nothing. Sorry, just... Not important.” He took a sip of his wine, trying to fix his gaze onto the telly.
John hesitated for a moment. “How can I trust you?”
He turned towards John. “John, if you want your own room, now that we are back in London, I understand -”
“That's one of my other problems solved,” Mycroft said relieved. “I had Moran on my to-do list for a long time. He had made my work and that of many other governments very difficult.”
John was startled to be greeted by his name. He had assumed he had travelled here incognito. John followed the maid into an open living room which was tastefully decorated in dark rich colours and wooden panels. Two wingback chairs and a settee were arranged around a fireplace. The fire was lit and painted everything in warm colours. From one of the chairs, a woman dressed in a long gown rose and stepped towards him. John would have recognized her anywhere: Irene Adler.
Sherlock swayed and slumped down on his knees. Molly stepped closer to catch his fall. Everything was okay. They had won. The game was finally over.
After long moments of sensual explorations, Sherlock broke away from John and leaned over to the bedside table. “Please, let Mycroft be his usual meddling and manipulating arse...” he murmured. Sherlock opened the drawer and inspected the content. He grinned at John and pulled out a tube of lube and some condoms.
Sherlock visibly paled. “What did you do with them?” he asked.
“What must be done, must be done. Let's consult with Irene over breakfast.” He looked at the alarm clock at the bedside table. “Or better: brunch.” With that, he opened the door. John followed him to the dining room, where they found their hosts. Irene was already sipping her tea. Kate, her wife, sat beside her reading a newspaper. Irene looked up and smiled.
“Sherlock?” John asked softly. “You are scaring me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock murmured confused. John never was so dispassionate about his partners, bordering on rude.
Sherlock had not been declared alive again yet, but a press release was scheduled in three days. In the evening they would also be reunited with Mrs. Hudson again. Matt, John’s army mate, had her hidden away at his aunt's in Plymouth. It had turned out to be more of a vacation for Mrs Hudson. She had spent her time with Marjorie in a little cottage, drinking tea, taking the dogs for a walk and baking cakes for the local nursing home. The evenings had been filled with Doctor Who DVDs and EastEnders.
Molly turned around to keep the entrance of the street in view. She grew restless. The van was long out of sight and but she was too afraid to follow on foot.
Sherlock creased his forehead in concentration and inspected the second photo more thoroughly. A naked body, in a foetal position with mud and blood all over was depicted. His features softened as he connected the clues. “When I got rescued, my rescuer dropped something beside me. They probably killed Musgrave beforehand, undressed him and left him as a decoy. He could have passed as my twin, if somebody had checked on me.”
Sherlock nodded. “Quite elegantly. The corpse might be a bit old though.”
John examined him in his unfamiliar look. “Sherlock, how do you feel about redheads?” John asked.
Sherlock smiled. It was true. They both looked rather battered.
The cabbie looked around and spotted a small parking space between two cars further down the road. He slowly pulled up and parked.
A bottle of wine later, when the sun had already set, the doorbell chimed. Through the corridor, they could hear the familiar voice of Lestrade greeting the butler. It became obvious, that he had been a regular guest in the last few days. The butler didn't even bother with him after he closed the door. Greg entered the kitchen like he owned the place.
The rifle however was custom made. After reassembling he tried some aiming, unfortunately some real shooting would not be possible now. Despite not having been trained as a sniper, he was confident, that if necessary, he could also operate it. He was fascinated by the skill level of the snipers. John's aim wasn't bad, and if he really had wanted he could have trained as a sniper. But he had always seen himself in the medical corps. During his days in the army, when most of the days consisted of waiting, he had sometimes used a sniper rifle on a shooting ranges for fun. A mate of him instructed him sometimes, because it seemed he was a natural talent. And in some way, the concentration on the target relaxed him more than any other sport.
After some minutes he stood up and started pacing. He needed to think. A sniper had watched him, was still watching him? Was he under surveillance? But certainly not here, in the underground levels at NSY?
Mycroft on the other hand dealt with the coordination of Operation Debugging in other countries, the re-manning of empty positions and securing evidence. He was also responsible for apprehending the more international and border-hopping conspirators in Britain. But despite all the successes, some problems remained. The most pressing was that they still hadn't captured Moriarty. Even they had no clue, where he was hiding.
A tide was rising, and he hadn't the energy left to swim. He suffocated but the wish for the next breath was fading. It felt like being crushed alive. No escape was in sight, no fight was left in him. Capitulation was the only option available now. He just wanted to fall into the all-encompassing quiet darkness to join his fallen comrades and, most important, his best friend. He failed them all, as doctor and as a friend. He cleaned the flat, cleared out the fridge, took out the trash and waited for Mrs. Hudson to leave for evening mass at church.
“Innuendo, John?”
Greg looked sceptical. "As far as I know, a sniper wants my head. Other ones seem to be on John Watson's and Mrs. Hudson’s heels. I don't know if I can be much of a help. What is going on?"
John's eyes watered. “I had given up. I thought I had lost everything.”
When they calmed down again, John took off his leather jacket and shoes and sat on the bed to join Sherlock. He groaned as he made contact with the mattress and just let himself fall backwards.
“What if I pull another magic trick?” Sherlock goaded.
With that, Greg opened the door and vanished along the corridor. John took a deep breath, and looked into the bag. He pulled out the mobile, a non-descriptive key, and some bills and pocketed everything in his jeans. He loaded the gun and tucked it into the waist band at the back of the jeans. The few spare bullets went into the pockets as well. He pulled up the cap of the hoodie and left NSY.
“Thank you, Dr Watson. I assume your travels were uneventful - contrary to the happenings here,” Mycroft said.
Meanwhile John awkwardly entertained  Anderson and Dimmock. Anderson was mostly bemoaning the workload, because some of his colleagues were still suspended, and Dimmock complimented John's vintage leather jacket. He was a biker and loved the old style. After that, their discussion fell flat and they caught the last part of Greg’s report about Nick's homophobic parents. John patted Sherlock’s back affectionately. Sherlock had stiffened a little bit. John knew better now: Sherlock wasn’t alarmed by sex. He was just cautious of the reactions of people with regards to sex. Sherlock never liked people that made fun of minorities. And being gay still set him apart from others.
“John,” he said, “everything is okay. Stop being worried or ashamed. I want you, too.” To prove his point, Sherlock pressed his hips into John's arousal, John could only groan. The friction was exquisite.
He opened it with caution and slipped inside. He definitely wasn’t the first visitor. The flat was occupied. There were beer bottles and wrappers from sandwiches lying around. Somebody camped here. John pulled out his gun. It was a small apartment with two windows, a tiny kitchenette and an adjacent bathroom. They were equipped with basic food and cleaning supplies. He made sure nobody was hiding. A sleeping bag was in the corner and an old table was in front of the other window. A sniper rifle was mounted above it. I was camouflage painted, and the shoulder stock was adorned with an inlay of a lion. Despite having been a soldier and having a fairly broad knowledge in guns, John didn't recognise the weapon. A box with ammunition was placed beside the rifle. The bullets were engraved with the initials S. M.
While there, he brushed his teeth and inspected himself in the mirror. His beard came along nicely, but he still looked drawn and tired. He sighed, discarded his clothes in a pile and jumped into the shower. It felt glorious. The last shower he had had was at the hospital after his shift over a week ago and since then he had had to make do with short wash at the sink in his bolthole. When finished he towelled himself dry. The bruises on his stomach and tears from his struggle with the sniper were healing nicely and had faded into a dirty yellow. The whole bathroom was steamed up and humid. He slung the towel around his waist, picked up his laundry and his bag and crept back into the bedroom. He needn't have bothered, because Sherlock was awake and sat forlornly in the bed. Upon seeing him, his face lit up. He scrutinised John from head to toe.
Molly stopped in her tracks. The van faced away from her and she couldn’t see the driver, but the motor of the vehicle was still running. This seemed off. She crouched behind a parking car and watched. Some seconds later the tall man stepped out of the alley again. John was slumped against him and dragged toward the van. The sliding door opened on the left side and John was carelessly dumped in. The man jumped in with him and pulled the door close. The van was already accelerating before the door clicked shut.
John grinned, and pulled Sherlock along through the kitchen toward the master bedroom.
“You lost weight,” he stated.
Sherlock and John had no business left either. They congratulated Greg on his promotion, assured him, that he earned it and said their goodbyes. On the way to the elevator John spoke up.
They spent ten days at the safe house without disruption. While the arrests of Moriarty's men had mostly happened on Thursday, the subsequent investigations were the main topics in the media on the following days. Also the vacated positions in politics and courts also needed to be staffed again and suitable candidates were discussed. The media presented fresh faces and proposed personnel that were already retired and now needed to be reactivated. In two countries new elections were announced, because the backlash of the investigations forced even more politicians to resign.
“Not one so far,” John said. He cursed himself a fool for thinking that the game had been over. Worry was settling in his gut. Sherlock would be next on Moriarty's list and he was in no position to warn or help his partner.
“Someone wants us dead,” John continued. “I need you to take care of her, till I’ll sort out this mess. Can I count on you?”
“Not really. This is about you, too. First: Listen to this. But I warn you. It’s horrible.”
With that, she pulled open the door and entered into a cosy bedroom. John followed. The room contained a king size bed, a wardrobe and a desk. Another door led to an en-suite bathroom. On the bed, under some blankets and buried into the pillows the outline of a body could be seen.
“I have a better idea,” Kate spoke up. “Take the car in the garage, the Škoda. It is unremarkable. Leave it somewhere in Berlin, best in a restricted parking zone. It will get towed and the owner will get informed. Theft happens all the time around here, so no one will be any the wiser of how you travel.”
Mycroft had even contacted the family of the Arab prince. The good news was that they weren’t supportive of their stray family member. But they were also helpless. The prince had fled the country because he had wanted to duck out of some duties that he had had to fulfil as part of the ruling family. He was now milking the family's funds and his status as a diplomat. Any further official action from Mycroft against him would lead to a diplomatic incident, because in a formal capacity, the family could not accept a prosecution against one of its members in another country. But on the other hand, the family had no way, to transport the Prince back home. It would lead to an open quarrel that could destabilize the reign of the current king. Mycroft was at his wit’s end.
“Sherlock,” John asked. “Are you okay?”
Sally informed him, that Greg and John were still in the examination room. They had to wait for news, because only family was allowed. Molly did her best to get some information and tried to keep Sherlock from threatening the nurse at the reception desk. Sally and Mrs. Hudson started to discuss the recent events and tried to keep him distracted. Telling him not to worry only made him more hostile.
The next morning they were woken by the alarm. Usually they slept in, but now they had to be ready when Stella picked them up. They enjoyed a generous breakfast and dressed in their disguises. John’s beard had grown impressively thick and the leather jacket gave an additional bulk to his frame. Sherlock still had red hair, but the roots were starting to show. Both donned baseball caps and checked their appearances. With all the visible differences in clothes and hair and Sherlock’s talent of impersonating people, they were highly unlikely to be recognised.
“While I don’t need a partner in a classic sense, I sometimes need a hug and some intimacy. It keeps me grounded. And sex is an easy way for getting that. Crazy thing is: it is easier getting laid than getting hugged.” A sad chuckle escaped him. John looked back up at Sherlock, who listen to him with complete attention.
The next evening, the soft caresses had became bolder, but were still quite innocent. Sherlock had seemed desperate for touch and had melted into John. That night, John had been startled awake from a nightmare. He had sat up and tried to catch his breath. Sherlock had just pulled him into his arms and planted soft kisses in his hair, on his forehead and cheekbones, calming him back to sleep.
“It’s not your fault,” John soothed her. “Moriarty is the only one to blame. Are you hurt?”
The moment was lsot and they stood up to start their day. They took turns in the bathroom and prepared breakfast. It was almost noon, and both decided on coffee, eggs and bacon with additional slices of bread and sausages.
“How do you know that it was his lover?” John asked.
After that, John gave a short account. He told Mycroft about the probably now smelling corpse of the sniper in 218C Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson staying with an old army buddy, the 'stolen' car and the gun in the Spree river in Berlin.
“But we could, if we wanted to, Sherlock. That’s how it is usually done.”
Sherlock propped himself up. “John. Calm down. It doesn’t have to mean anything.  I apologise.” Sherlock pulled away looking crestfallen.
3. Do this as fast and as quiet as possible. When finished, tab me on the back and follow me.
One evening John walked to St. Bart's hospital. Molly usually worked long hours and John hoped to find her there. Mrs. Hudson's comment about Sherlock never left him. The more he thought about Sherlock's jump, the more ideas came to him, how to stage it. John imagined his own scenarios and how he would set up a fake suicide. In most of them, Molly were involved. To curb his nagging curiosity, he needed to speak to her.
When they arrived at NSY, Greg was standing in the office kitchen at the coffee maker with Dimmock and Anderson and he waved them over. Dimmock had been able to solve his case in Brighton and had returned last week. With the old Superintendent gone, he hadn’t been able to report his findings so far and couldn’t officially close the case. Greg tried to squeeze short briefings like these during his coffee break and had reassigned Dimmock to a new case.
Sherlock still had no bank account. It seemed that reopening an account after death because of 'suddenly being alive again' was no standard procedure and therefore needed time. It didn't seem to bother him, because currently he was lying on the sofa, staring at the ceiling. He was moping, because John had refused to go out for lunch.
John also had a lot to think about. His instinct told him that he was on the right track. The sniper he had killed, Sebastian Moran, had gotten his commands from Eastern Europe and now he was being sent there to retrieve an agent who had been in contact with Moriarty’s men. John remembered what Sherlock always said: The universe is rarely so lazy. If he was lucky, the agent could tell him something about Moriarty or Sherlock. If not, then John would deliver him to Berlin and come back to the Czech Republic to track down Moriarty himself.
John just chuckled. He felt at home again. It was even better. He now not only lived with a flatmate and friend here, but also with a boyfriend.
Sherlock's eyebrow rose in curiosity. “Anal sex?” he prompted.
“Moriarty and one of his helpers tried to drown them in one of the reservoirs of the embankments. Thankfully it was quite obvious where they were. It was the only reservoir with open flood gates and the guy guarding it was quite the tip-off. John and Greg were already drenched quite thoroughly and will probably suffer a slight hypothermia. They tried to keep Mrs. Hudson dry on their shoulders. We got them out just in time,” Sally explained.
‘No. He left after we had prepared the corpse. I have no way to contact him. I don't know if he is alright. Is there anything, I can do?’ she typed.
John felt his cheeks flushing. He was nervous, but also incredibly aroused. “Fuck me,” he whispered blushing.
“Perfect.” Irene said. “Kate and I will leave for Canada this evening. I don't intend to spend more time than necessary in the vicinity of Moriarty. We need to get everything ready.”
He took a deep breath and logged into his account. He stared at his balance. He blinked. He checked his account number in the corner. Everything was in order, except -
Sherlock stared at her for some seconds. He shook himself and his eyes lost his focus for a moment trying to remember Sally’s number. After a few seconds, he nodded and punched the number into his mobile. He had a connection and it started ringing. Sherlock fidgeted while waiting. His breaths came fast and forced.
“Well, they drowned some minutes ago in the Thames. Or so it will appear. They will be found along the river banks soon.” Moriarty’s features distorted into a malicious grin. “Not original, but effective nonetheless.”
He dismounted the rifle from the table, and packed everything that could be of value into the trunk. With a soft napkin from the gun maintenance kit he wiped down all surfaces he had touched. With some bleach he found in the bathroom he cleaned the sink of his blood. His hoodie was blood soaked, but leaving it behind was no option because of the cold weather and his DNA. He picked up the leather jacket and put it on. It was sufficient to cover the blood stains. He looked at the corpse. There was probably some of his DNA on the sniper's hands. He took the bottle of bleach and poured it over the hands and the corpse for good measure. He remembered all the times, how Sherlock had thrown a fit, when killers used bleach to cover their tracks: crude, but effective.
Sherlock appreciated, that John took his time and placed his partner's needs before his own. When Sherlock felt John entering him, all the puzzle pieces in his life suddenly fit. He saw John towering above him, aroused, steady and confident. Sherlock lost himself in a wave of pleasure. John's cock and hand kept him trapped between two overwhelming sensations. John readjusted his posture to plant short kisses on Sherlock's lip while thrusting into him. After a few more forceful strokes Sherlock moaned and came. Sherlock's eyes fell closed, but he heard John's breath speeding up till John shuddered and fell on top of him. As soon as Sherlock felt his strength return, he hugged John to him. They stayed like that for some minutes, till John's breath evened out and he rolled off him and dropped beside Sherlock on the bed. He caught Sherlock's hand and planted a kiss on his fingers. He was grinning like mad.
Greg sobered and took a sip of his now luke-warm coffee. It didn't help to settle his stomach. The queasy feeling remained. He clicked through the last photos. Three shaky snap shots of people, minding their business in London. Greg startled and zoomed in on the last one. It was a picture of the older victim he currently investigated. He checked the time stamp.  How did he end up on Sherlock's phone almost two and a half months ago?
“No judgement from me here. Gay sister. Remember?” John said. “I sensed a 'but' at the end of your sentence.“
John got comfortable behind the rifle and started to aim. He had a perfect line of sight toward a hotel with big balconies. Sherlock took out his equipment to gather the necessary data for calculating the shot.
There he bought his ticket and some food and waited for the departure of his train in a small coffee shop. In the meantime he connected to the hotspot and created an account at Adultfriendfinder with his William Miller alias. He left a short message from SoldierBoy in the FFM Forum.
“I hate travelling by train,” he exclaimed, “I’m not going to move again for the next few hours.” With that, they both got comfortable on the bed like it was a big sofa and slowly started talking. It took them well into the night to get up to speed with each other.
“Comfy,” Sherlock stated, nestling closer toward John, pressing into his side.
“I could send somebody to check up on her if you want. But as long as you can't go back to Baker Street, I would keep her where she is now,” Mycroft said. John knew that Mycroft was right. He would just try to get hold of Matt later on and send a short update to Mrs Hudson. She should know that she had been right with her assumption, and Sherlock really was alive.
“No, I still have some left,” John answered. Mrs Hudson swatted his hands away and stowed the bills into her pockets.
Fact: John had female company upstairs with strong evidence that they were having sex. Conclusion: John started dating again to find a new girlfriend.
John was mounting the stairs. He stilled at the door.
The BBC reported how three high ranking NSY officers had been arrested. The subdivisions for curtailing of drugs trafficking and counter terrorism were the most heavily affected. Every minute new allegations were named and another crime was reported. It seemed that with a certain momentum at the base, the higher-ups were no longer able to cover up questionable connections and decisions. Moriarty's web of supporters and facilitators was crumbling.
John would have never described his sexual encounters with women as boring, but the foreplay Sherlock engaged him in made all his previous experiences pale in comparison. He was hot, sweaty and incredibly turned on. Sherlock kept him on the edge and prepared him thoroughly. When he felt Sherlock entering him, he was desperate and calm at the same time. Desperate for more, but calm, because he knew he was safe. His orgasm crept up on him and took him to a serenity he had never known before. Seconds later Sherlock collapsed on top of him. They both needed some minutes to catch their breath and calm down.
He wanted to make him squirm, gasping for breath and stop thinking. Sliding downward, he took his time and kissed the long neck, pale shoulders and paid special attention to the perky nipples. Sherlock's skin was flushed and hot to his touch. He swiftly unbuttened the trousers, encouraging Sherlock to lift his hips and sliding them, his pants  and socks off in one go.  Standing in front of the bed, John took a moment to appreciate what lay before him. Long legs, lean torso and a straining erection nestled in dark curls.
He put the lid on the box and got the attention of Greg. Greg threw a glance at him, nodded and went through the door. John followed him through corridors of NSY into areas, where he never went before. It seemed they were descending deeper into the building. Greg gestured him into a small storage room and switched the light on.
Sherlock hugged him close. He raised his hands to John's neck and encouraged him to look into his eyes.
Molly knew time was running out. She gathered all her courage and took a small step out of her hiding place, so that Sherlock could spot her. The small movement was enough. If Molly hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn't have known, that Sherlock had acknowledged her. Sherlock quickly returned his gaze to Moriarty, to not reveal Molly's position.
“You haven't earned a choice. On the contrary: you need to be punished.” Moriarty’s voice rose. “You destroyed my legacy. My whole network is gone. You forced me to do all this. And this time, I will watch you jump. I will tell you, what you have to do. No escape this time,” he spat.
“Angelo would never take our money,” Sherlock mumbled into the pillows.
Greg opened the last audio file and listened. After a few minutes, he knew what the recording was about. His stomach rebelled violently the more he heard. Listening made him sick and he barely made it to the waste-paper basket in the corner. He violently threw up.
Greg strode towards Sherlock and pulled him away from the fridge. “You bastard,” he grinned and embraced him in a tight hug. “You crazy, crazy bastard,” Lestrade prattled, hugging him even tighter.
Greg and John emerged from the examination room 20 minutes later. Both were dressed in scrubs. Their wet clothes were stowed in some bags. They had been checked and the release papers were ready to sign. The water had been freezing cold and they had been submerged longer than sound, but both were healthy adults with more than average muscle mass and had withstood the cold better than expected. They were ordered to keep warm for the rest of the day and ingest some hot beverages and food. Some paracetamol was prescribed to ward off any inflammation.
John startled. “You're awake?”
The following evening, a dam was broken in John. He didn't want to care about social norms anymore. He wanted what was good for him. He hugged Sherlock close to him. He placed short tentative kisses on Sherlock’s hair and his lips wandered down to Sherlock's mouth. The first kiss on his lips was hesitant and unsure, but John gained confidence fast. It was not much different from kissing a woman. While with women however he usually was the instigator. Now it felt much more equal. John had never grown a full beard before, therefore the biggest difference came from the missing feeling of skin on skin. But that change was due to him, not because he was kissing a man. After some moments, they found a rhythm of giving and taking. Sherlock melted into the kiss and devoured him. Neither one needed to impress, but both wanted to please. They experimented what felt good, learning from each other.
He hoped that Matt was still well organized, checking his mails daily. He seemed to be very active on the platform. Therefore he was confident. Hopefully he would also remember the pub. But John had no other idea, how to keep the meeting point vague enough without attracting nutcases.
John took deep breaths. He fought the tumultuous emotions back. He took the hand that rested upon his own and clasped it tightly. “I am with you, wherever this may lead us,” he vowed.  Their eyes locked. A shy smile formed on their lips. John’s stomach growled again – and they burst into giggles.
John knew instantly, that the phone wasn’t Greg’s original one. “It’s from Mycroft: High end technology, special encryption software, no possibility to be spied on, doesn’t work on regular frequencies,” Greg explained. “But that’s not important now. Here, listen. But I think, you should sit down first.”
During preparation, John switched the telly on. The regular programme had been interrupted and breaking news about arrests were now broadcasted on every station. In many European countries, members of the police force and security agencies were sweeping into national offices to round up Moriarty’s men. High ranking policemen, but also businessmen and politicians were taken into custody. A close up on Sally Donovan showed her escorting a handcuffed judge to a police car. Operation Debeugging seemed to be in full swing.
John was baffled. He had thought Irene was dead. Mycroft had told him so. He gathered his wits. “It is good to see you alive too,” he responded, stunned.
John smiled at him. “Freshen up a little bit. I'll get the food,” he ordered and Sherlock just nodded.
“Anyway,” John continued, “I don’t know how long this will take. Let’s use a code. Only trust someone, who uses – “ John thought for a second,” – ’Skyfall’ as code word,  okay?” Matt nodded.
“Okay, but the other reasons still stand, why I don't want to entertain anyone here. I just don't trust myself sometimes. I don't want to get caught up so deep again. Perhaps it's my kind of drug that I want to avoid. Before Afghanistan, I dabbled into everything. Name a kink and I probably did it.”
Mycroft and Sherlock stilled. They looked into each other’s eyes. Mycroft lifted one eyebrow. “It could work,” he said after a moment of silence.
The wallet was also disappointingly empty. It only contained money, but of that a lot: almost 1.000 pounds. John added the cash to his own funds. When he was finished  with all his tasks, he made a short trip to a small corner store for some food. After that, he went over his plan again.
“Matt, first: It is nice to see you. Second: yep, I am in trouble. Third: This is Mrs. Hudson,” Matt and Mrs. Hudson shook hands.
At stops in the Netherlands and in Germany, he changed small amounts of money from pounds into euros. He bought himself some snacks and drank way too much coffee. His gun was always readily available hidden in the back of his trousers. But nobody really took any notice of him and he was glad for that.
“This way, Mrs Hudson,” he indicated and steered her away. While he explained what happened so far - the recording, the coercion, Greg’s help, the sniper - Mrs Hudson took everything surprisingly well.
Moriarty’s head and upper body came in view. He wore John's leather jacket and carried a gun. “Hi there, friends of Sherlock,” he began, chewing some gum. “We still have some unfinished business.”
“I don't work for you,” John said.
“Even full hard-core BDSM, mostly as dom,” John confirmed. “And role play, gang bangs, public sex, dabbled into medical kinks, asphyxiation, blood play (and I am a doctor, for goods sake), even water sports. I did every position of the Kama Sutra with a yoga instructor, twice. Shall I go on? I had sex with women, men, transgender, with every body type, with people from every continent and I once substituted as a living dildo for a lesbian couple, because they were curious. Is that enough for the beginning?” John drew a deep breath.
John huffed. “Of course.”
Later that evening, the news on the telly reported the assassination of the Arab prince. Very soon the name of Sebastian Moran was brought up by the reporters. The morning after, a man walking a dog reported a parked vehicle near the M4. A dead man was seated behind the wheel. The police had inspected the car and a sniper rifle had been found in the trunk. Later on, a preliminary autopsy report confirmed that the rifle had been used for the assassination of the Prince. Therefore the conclusion was drawn: the dead man in the car was Sebastian Moran. It seemed he had died of an intracranial aneurysm.
purple shirt -  his hair previously made frizzy by Summer heat, now tamed into curls. John doesn’t disguise the appreciative look in his eye as he smiles up at him, and nor does Sherlock for him.
"Don't know. Maybe. I know you'd be good at the sympathy and the hugging and the smiling. And you're my friend."
Sherlock dashed out of the room, coat billowing behind him, the cogs in his head racing. He rushed down the stairs, only stopping when Hopkins called him.
"It's fine, John. We'll cover it in the morning when Mycroft's men miss the obvious details." As he spat out those words, he slammed his bedroom door, with John stood in front of it. He knocked quietly.
“Well, I thought it would be easier to get it out of the way. You didn’t seem like the type to let men stay for breakfast,” Sherlock replies, putting on the charming smile that had won Marco over earlier with ease.
Sherlock stands up on legs that ache from being sat down for too long and makes his way into John's hospital room. He's asleep, his chest rising and falling steadily, the heart monitor gently beeping beside him, slow and, paradoxically, comforting and terrifying.
He complies. “Never have I ever had a girlfriend.”
Like the sun, she is also blinding.
"No."
"Nothing wrong with a bit of rebellion."
Greg looked at John for a response. "I'm okay with that. John?"
"Sherlock." Mycroft knelt down besides Sherlock's chair. Sherlock hated when he did that - it felt patronising. "They want to meet with you, don't they?"
"Yeah. I love you, and I want to spend time with you. Some alone time would be quite nice. Although we may have to just lie a little bit and tell my parents that we will be under parental supervision and therefore unlikely to set the house on fire or something."
"I think you've done enough." Mycroft interrupted impatiently, rubbing circles on his forehead. (John could honestly say that this was the most emotional he'd ever seen Mycroft.) "Go home, you two. If we require statements, we'll come in the morning."
Sherlock gapes slightly at the suggestion. "Your mum and dad would hardly approve."
"Ah yes. My boyfriend, the war hero." There was only the tiniest hint of genuine sarcasm to this statement. "Mycroft told me the details."
"Oh." Sherlock tried to sound careless, but he felt his nails dig into his palms. "Your parents let you sleep in the same room?"
John winced at the title, which felt more like a mockery than a sign of respect. “Thanks.”
Mycroft responded with a spark of red flying from his wand towards Moriarty. He deflected it effortlessly, then shot white light back at Mycroft. Sherlock felt rooted to the floor, standing in front of John's hospital bed as he lay oblivious to the chaos in the hospital room. Then Mary and Moran joined in, sending a mixture of verbal and non-verbal curses and counter curses to which Mycroft deflected and responded with growing exhaustion, spells barely grazing his skin, a hair short of fatal. At that point Sherlock rushed in and joined Mycroft, jabbing his wand at the air and the room lit up with the brightness of the spells. But all Mycroft and Sherlock's effort was defensive. They were too outnumbered and out-powered to do anything other than escape harm and get out of that damned infirmary alive. Though Sherlock did manage to cast a stupefy curse at Moran, catching him off guard. That one, he was proud of.
“Dating. It’s not really compatible with - “
"Yes. Absolutely." John kissed Sherlock's forehead, making Sherlock smile slightly.
"I heard what she said. It seems awful!" Mary said. "This can't be legal. Not for students."
here appreciates the house."
The other doctor rolls his eyes, but rushes out of the room. Sherlock’s curiosity is piqued now; what petty nonsense could these mortals be talking about?
“Arsehole.”
"Good morning, John." Sherlock said, standing behind him. John turned to face him and smiled weakly back at him. "I - uh - that's a nice uniform." Sherlock sat down quickly next to him.
"What?"
“Love -? No, you can’t hang up after that! Come back! John!”
"Hey, hey, no. You've come all this way. You've had a pretty awful time here. I want to make it up to you." John squeezes Sherlock's hand. "What do you want to do? Anything. Besides, your stuff is back at the flat, so we don't have much of a choice but to stay outside for a bit."
"Let slip the darts of war?"
“There’s nothing that you could do that could possibly put me off. Yeah, you’re a bit annoying when you experiment with body parts and play violin in the middle of the night and don’t tell me what’s going on in cases. But you’re the best thing that has ever happened to me. Bar none. I’m not going to leave you. Not for anything.”
"Good evening, students." Mcgonagall bore the straight face she usually had, but to Sherlock's eye he knew that she was as excited as the rest of the students. "Tonight, three names will be picked from the Goblet of Fire. Those students will become their school's champions, and one will become the winner.
“No, I just -”
Molly peeked around the corner. Sherlock stood on the mortar banister of the roof. His curly black hair and the trademark coat were billowing in the wind. His hands were raised to appease Moriarty who held a gun pointed at Sherlock. Moriarty's back was towards Molly.
“What is going through that brilliant brain of yours?” John asked teasingly after they finished their meal. The paper containers and plates were stacked haphazardly on the coffee table.
Sherlock chuckled. “I should be the one asking you that.” He sobered. “I am okay - more than okay. Everything is perfect.” A serene smile settled on his face. “You?”
They were some lucky bastards. Life was colourful again.
“I think, it's John, the guy who grabbed him and a driver,” Molly said.
He resolved to buy the ticket at St. Pancras station. He had two hours to catch his train. He packed his backpack fast: Some clothes, the med kit and the folder with the material for the fake papers. All of his money and the gun went into his pockets.
Greg looked into eyes, seeking confirmation of his written commands. John raised a questioning eyebrow. After some moments he nodded and put the folder on the table. Greg turned his back toward John giving him some privacy.
John should have felt nervous or afraid. But he just felt calm and focussed. He had a purpose. Somehow everything started to make sense. Sherlock did not commit suicide, it was murder. If it had been possible, he would have traded his life for Sherlock's. He had been willing to do so at the pool with Moriarty a year ago. And now it seemed Sherlock had done the same for him, and for his friends. He couldn’t be angry any more at Sherlock for abandoning him. Now he was furious at Moriarty for forcing Sherlock into committing suicide. The intense emotion felt good. He would use it to  revenge his best friend. Even if it was the last thing, he would do.
At the moment it was up to John to pay for everything. So far, he had used up all his cash and probably the complete allowance of his credit card for groceries.
“Sure. I'll order some,” Sherlock said. “Thai?”
John observed Sherlock basking in the afterglow. The pale skin was flushed and his face was relaxed. His eyes were closed and a tear was stuck in his eyelashes. Sherlock opened his eyes; they were glassy and a little bit red-rimmed.
Sherlock sat up. “You declined lunch, because you thought you were broke?”
“Sherlock?” John asked.
The Rookie Doc’
John was a little bit confused, but he complied. A note was taped inside the folder
The recording replayed the meeting of Sherlock and Moriarty on the roof. They discussed the 'game', how Moriarty engineered the downfall of Sherlock and the consequences if he didn't jump: snipers on him, John and Mrs. Hudson. There was a gun shot and a desperate phone call between John and Sherlock. Then silence, steps and rustling noises.
Sherlock settled on his elbows, mustering John. His heated eyes fixed on John's jeans with a clear order to remove them. John chuckled and shimmied out of them. Another sterner glance from Sherlock prompted him to remove his pants as well, which were barely holding his erection.
Shocked, Moriarty crumbled to the ground. Sherlock took a step back to avoid Moriarty grabbing him. He smiled at Molly and looked back at the twitching Moriarty on the ground. He was still conscious, but unable to move. The gun had tumbled from his hands and now lay beside him. Sherlock kicked it further away.
A small laughter escaped them both. John released them and wiped his hand against the bed sheets. Sherlock pulled John closer, not minding the stickiness between them. They enjoyed their nowfound closeness, and were both relieved, that the important bits were said today. Both were happy, sated, home. Finally.
“How shall I put this?” He turned his gaze to Sherlock. “There won’t be any girlfriends anymore.”
“The last station for you: Happy dying, join your friends. And just that you know: you are not even worth one of my bullets, you freak,” the tall man whispered into his ear. Sherlock was dropped to the ground and a boot kicked firmly into his stomach. Sherlock wretched some blood and vomit onto the ground. There wasn’t much, because his stomach was empty. He didn't care anymore. It wasn't important. He just collapsed to the ground, trying to get lost in the images in his head. It was peaceful and warm there. The door to his cell was shut and bolted.
He unlocked his new phone and scrolled through the content. One number was saved under L – Lestrade obviously. A memo gave the address of his bolt hole. There was also a downloaded map of London with highlighted areas of heavy surveillance - probably a courtesy of Mycroft. If he avoided the tourist attractions and public buildings especially banks, he could keep off the radar. So back alleys and a baseball cap would be good options. If this goes on longer, he decided to grow a beard, just to change his appearances more.
“What stopped you?” Sherlock asked.
Greg nodded his thanks to Mycroft and said good night. He grabbed his wallet and keys and left the kitchen. The remaining men listened to his retreating steps on the staircase and the closing click of a door.
During his time away from Baker Street dismantling Moriarty’s network and after coming back he had to deal with being alone, John’s feeling of betrayal for abandoning and lying to him, John’s marriage and his removal from Baker street, Mary’s past, John’s feelings of betrayal after Mary’s past backfired on them and a lot of repressed and mostly toxic emotions.
He felt Sherlock tensing up. “What’s the matter?” John asked.
Greg stilled. He would have recognised the familiar frame of Sherlock anywhere. “Oh my God,” he whispered. He cast a nervous glance toward John to confirm what he saw, afraid that the long hours at the Yard had made him see ghosts. John just nodded with a small smile on his lips.
Both didn’t hear the police officer approaching and startled as he addressed Sherlock. “Sir, I just got the order from Mr Holmes, to take you to the Trinity Hospital. Someone is waiting there for you.”
“What happened?” Greg asked. His tried to find a focus point in the semi-darkness.
Molly took a deep breath and started to type. ‘Sherlock asked me to help him. The jump was one of his back-up plans. We never thought he really had to use it. He staged it, I don't know how. I provided a corpse that was similar to him. Then I prepared it accordingly to his instructions. We faked some photographs. I attested his death. I just made sure, nobody came too close. I couldn't tell you. He said you were under surveillance. I am sorry.’ She looked apprehensively at John.
“Let me help you with that, I am quite a good hairdresser,” Kate offered, beaming at her wife. With that, the whole house prepared for departure: Suitcases were packed, travel routes discussed and passports finalized.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled John closer. “Don't coddle me. As I told you, I am no blushing virgin. I know what I want, and with whom.”
Thanks for reading.
“No John, I need to feel you. It's not enough, please.” Sherlock chased for further kisses, trying to pull John on top of him. John planted some light kisses on Sherlock's face to soothe him.
John felt light-headed. Suddenly the jump made sense. The nagging feeling of wrongness vanished. He wasn’t to blame. Sherlock was made to jump. He had solid reasons. Even if John would have gladly switched places with him, the guilt that weighted him down lifted. At the same time gratitude and disbelieve for the sacrifice of his friend for him took its place.
This set the pace for the next few days. Most of the time, they watched the news. Due to their involvement with Moriarty, they felt a deep sense of satisfaction with the current proceedings. When hungry, they took their time to cook and eat. If the rooms got too stuffy, they hid behind baseball caps and went for a walk along the nearby river. With the money from John, they bought some fresh produce in a a small whole-food shop some streets further down. They settled into a relaxed and calming routine.
Sherlock looked more forlorn. He just stood in the entry of the flat and took everything in. John understood that Sherlock had probably given up on ever returning to 221B Baker Street at one point. There were some minor changes in the living room. John had put away the violin, for example, because it had broken his heart to see it every day. Also, a lot of Sherlock’s ongoing experiments no longer existed. He knew that he didn’t need to explain that. Sherlock probably understood, what had happened. Therefore John didn't comment and just let Sherlock be.
However John couldn't avoid reality anymore. The bills stacked on the mantel piece of the hearth. He needed to pay them. He couldn't afford any late fees.
Thirty white horses on a red hill,
"Christ. Are you okay?"
"I'm guessing that means I'll have to get a refund for th tickets I bought to Alton Towers..."
"What was that about?"
“Book the first train to London.”
"So how did you know that stuff about me?" John asks, taking a bite of his muffin.
As the conversation proceeded to turn into a debate about equality and politics (which, to John's surprise, Sherlock was actually taking part in), John's attention turned to the teachers, whose conversations he was somehow able to hear above the constant murmurs of the other students.
"Yeah, cheers."
“No more than it is for you to protect me.”
I miss you too. Please let me know when we can next meet. I'm free any time until my family and I go on holiday from 8th of July to the 17th, and even then my parents wouldn't mind me staying a little bit longer. They're very happy I have someone to stay for at all, after sixteen years of concern over my apparent loneliness. In fact, with some convincing, they may let me take you with us. But I'm rambling, thinking too far ahead. We should probably just take this one day at a time, shouldn't we.
Harry: By the time Sebastian and Antonio reunite again, several misunderstandings have occurred, so that by the end Antonio is arrested and alone, Sebastian has reunited with his sister, who will marry the count, and is married to Olivia.
"Do you know where Sherlock is?" John asked Mary.
“Yes, I thought so,” Sherlock said this as though John had just confirmed a minor rule detail on Monopoly, not as though they just talked about blowjobs. Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Ever the British man, John Watson.”
"Come now, do I have to be explicit? Do I have to remind you of the vow you made?" Alissia rubbed subconscious at her right wrist, like it pained her. Unbreakable vow. The bastard had made her make an Unbreakable vow.
"I find my family too unbearable as it is, without subjecting them to my experiments. I suppose I have Lestrade and the others at Scotland Yard, but I doubt they would agree."
"Can you get changed? Come down to the hall with me. There aren't any lessons on today so you can spend the next few hours sleeping if you want, after some food."
If he could have, Sherlock would have laid there in silence for hours, nothing but the sound of their unified breathing and the comfort of John's fingers in his hair. But all too soon, the new nurse came and kicked Sherlock out so that John could have some alone time. "I imagine you'll need to get ready for the day too. See friends, find out what you've missed," the nurse added in a friendly voice, which made Sherlock all the more irritated. He got out of the bed, put on the shoes he had taken off the previous night before climbing into John's bed, then kissed John briefly on the lips . "I'll be back soon." He promised, ignoring any protests the nurse may have had, then left to Ravenclaw common room, where he immediately fell back into bed and closed his eyes, too drained to talk to anyone, friends or otherwise.
"What would you like me to make him say next?" There was a pause, like the person controlling John was considering what to do next. They settled on having John say "gottle o' geer, gottle o' geer." Patronising. Humiliating. Yet John remained seemingly indifferent.
“Of course. Mrs Hudson is very capable.”
Sherlock: … I’m listening
“Wait, you do that?”
Sherlock frowned in confusion and shook his head with a small smile. "You are a strange man, John Watson, with a strange moral compass."
“Right. Where first, Redbeard?”
He’s fairly sure he’s crying a little bit, but he doesn’t really mind. As long as he’s quiet and doesn’t wake her up yet.
"It's always colder than expected in Britain," Mcgonagall replied coolly, "Even to the people who live here. Why do you think we complain so much?"
Harry: You pretended to be straight for 17 years but go off I guess
"Sherlock, what about you?"
"That's ok. Why are you whispering?"
"Sixty three pounds?!" John repeats incredulously. When the lady at the desk raises a displeased eyebrow, he quickly adds, "No, it's fine. I have - I have that." He counts out the money in his wallet that isn't for tube fare and food. "Uh - is there a ticket that's fifty pounds?"
“What’s done is done, John. All we can do now is wait to see what turns up.” Sherlock’s phone beeps with a text and he sighs at the screen. “Mycroft. My presence is requested at the Diogenes club, apparently. Most likely about Mary.”
"It was for the greater good!" The man all but screams back, at least confirming Sherlock's theory. "Besides, you're not the police. I can tell. You can't stop me."
"As if you could."
"Not at all. I'd say you're on the higher ground here."
Anyway, the point is, I have very low expectations of how this will turn out. I would be perfectly happy for you to ignore this journal completely and never write back to me again, or even for us to just be acquaintances. I would suggest friends, but very few people find the idea of a friendship with me appealing, so I see no reason to hope for an anomaly in that pattern. You can probably see why.
“Somehow, that’s worse,” he mutters. He keeps his eyes trained on the floor, avoiding John’s face. “I spent two years away from London - away from you - dismantling Moriarty’s network. I was tortured and beaten and left for dead more times than I can count. I can’t let that all be for nothing. I can’t let myself think I failed to protect you.”
"Thanks, I guess."
After a week of sitting at home, then driving down to Baker Street to drop off Rosie before heading down to work John decides thatm Mary be damned, he will move back in with Sherlock. If anything, logically speaking, it would save him the constant driving from one part of london to another every other day. in reality, it's because the more he continues with his routine, the more he misses Sherlock's company and the excitement of 221b, where routine used to be completely non-existent. Besides, Mycroft predicted that Mary could be out of their lives for the next year or possibly more. He's never wrong.
At first, John’s heart leapt, the sight of Sherlock like a breath of fresh air after so many months. From his profile, he seemed the same gorgeous, wonderful person John had met. But then he saw the way his hands shook, the rigid, defensive posture, and how thin he was: his cheekbones could have cut through glass and his shirt - god, the same purple shirt he wore the first time they met - was now hanging loosely from his toro, no longer tightly stretched across it like before. He seemed entirely different compared to the proud, relaxed man who had danced himself breathless -
"Probably not a good idea to spend midnight angry at my parents and ranting about them, is it?"
On the fourth session, he has had eight hours of sleep, his nightmares easing somewhat in their intensity. Sherlock still wins most rounds. John starts to suspect he is just a bad player.
"The man I was trying to help. Did he make it?"
“No. Somehow, I’ve managed to surpass the horny stage of quarantine and go straight into the Regency Heroine stage.”
"That was - the most ridiculous thing - I have ever done," John manages to gasp out eventually.
"You know, I'm starting to think that Soulmate Day should come round more often, if it means you wearing that more often," Sherlock says lightly. He collapses onto the sofa, his feet resting on John's thighs, while his head rests on the arm.
"Good. Yes, that's fine. Never doubted that."
“Yes, Mr Moriarty,” the boy grumbled. “Sorry, Mr Moriarty.”
"You're usually angry when I offend people." Sherlock pointed out.
"I just did, didn't I?" He replied deadpan, smirking softly, resorting to humour as he felt the conversation drawing to a close. He brought his hand up to cup Sherlock's cheek. "It'll be alright. I swear it." He sounded so certain, so confident in Sherlock that Sherlock's eyes pricked dangerously with tears. He blinked rapidly then exhaled shakily. "Ok."
“So do I. I don’t know if I’ll be able to survive two more months or, heaven forbid, longer.”
“Harry, no, stop. I’ll fix this.”
“I don’t trust him, Lydia. He - oh, I don’t know, gives off this vibe. And his techniques are so unorthodox. Nothing I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been doing this job for nearly a decade now.”
"Ugh. Dull. Use your imagination next time."
“Definitely not.”
? I think the fuck not.”
John exhales, trying to calm the nervous flutter in his stomach that insists on arguing that it won't go alright. "Yeah, me too."
"Oh, fine, I'll sit with the audience," he hissed. "But next time I'd better have something more interesting to do."
He got on a different carriage soon afterwards with some fifth years, and read as the self-driven carriage rattled along and the fifth years prattled on non-stop. On the train, he got into the first empty carriage and carried on reading. He hadn't felt this lonely since first year.
“Well, I’ve now made icing with icing sugar and water and eaten it with a spoon. Twice. I can now tick that off the bucket list.”
In short, Sherlock rather enjoys Earth.
"You kissed?!"
Perhaps his one, singular brain cell allocated to human interaction decided that deductions counted as a good flirtation method, and had somehow managed to take free reign of his actions before he could think it through properly.
Your boyfriend, John xx
Sherlock is silent, carefully unresponsive. John continues talking
John paused. "I can live with that."
Sherlock looked up at Mycroft's face then shook his head firmly. "I'll be fine. I'll stay here. Like you told me."
"Well, it's still in its developmental phase, so it is considerably safer to use against school children. But the ministry is hoping to use it against criminals, for interrogation or torture or the like." Mcgonagall admitted. John felt his stomach lurch threateningly.
“Well, you still look pretty fit to me.”
John stokes the fire - it’s cold for March, after all, and it’s an old building - as Sherlock returns with the food then goes into the kitchen to get drinks. John turns around just as he comes back with a bottle of wine in one hand and two glasses in another.
The man's insane, her conscience said.
"How could I possibly owe you a favour? I've solved two cases for you in the last six months."
“Well, what would you have us talk about instead?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Politics? The weather?”
"Durmstrang?"
"Ahem." John jumps back and turns around, to find Sherlock stood there, arms folded, one questioning eyebrow raised, strangely calm and collected for a man running on far too little sleep and far too many coffees. If it weren't for his pale skin, dark eyes, and the dampness from splashing his face with cold water making his fringe stick to his forehead, he would look the same as he did when he first entered. John instantly flushes with embarrassment at being caught out.
