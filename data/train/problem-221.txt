“But the fish was stuffed with radishes,” said Watson. “Each meal had radishes. Raw radishes plain, raw radishes with cheese or bread or an herb.”
He turned to face the rest of the store and the other motorcycles in perfect rows. He walked down the row and hoped to escape the shop assistant. The annoying man busied himself by chatting with another customer who just entered the shop.
“I came in to prepare lunch. Tea?” Holmes said lifting the kettle before starting to heat it. Soon the room was filled with sounds of rummaging through cupboards.
The world was still in the predawn morning: not night, but not morning. The birds were not even awake to begin their singing. Mist hung around the pathway as he walked, and he noted the roads could be slick with dew.
“No need, I found what I was looking for.” Holmes tore off a chunk of bread and took a large bite. Still chewing, he found a glass and poured water into it.
Pinning him up against the door, I pressed my lips against his. I could feel him smiling under my kiss and I pressed more firmly in response. Holmes caught my meaning and kissed back. I explored the area along his jaw with my mouth, and he obliged me. The coolness of his skin and the beginning of stubble under my lips were a welcome sensation. His breath caught when my cold nose met the warm skin of his neck. My nose burned from the temperature difference as I nuzzled behind his ear. His distinct aroma combined with the scents of our rooms wrapped me in a comforting sensation of warmth and home.
The morning grew late before he felt well enough to consider the unsolved mysteries already presented to him earlier in the morning in the morning. He went with the easier one – breakfast. Yesterday the housekeeper was in and she wouldn’t be today, thus Holmes made breakfast.
“No, I was going to spend today indoors,” said Watson, turning his attention back to the notes scattered on his desk. “I was trying to organize my notes for the case of that peculiarly acting professor.”
His breathing was ragged, and I knew he was moving ever closer to the edge. I reached between us and gave his prick a few pulls before he arched his back, his head thrown back, and came apart with a muffled shout. His internal muscles spasmed and pulled me closer to the edge. A few more thrusts and I called his name into his shoulder as I found my release.
What was Friesland? Watson frowned and downed the rest of the Chardonnay - he wished his drink was brandy.
John hugged Sherlock’s waist tight as they took a sharp turn. The tug in his belly made the adrenaline spike and flow through his veins. Every smell and sound was more. More vivid. More intense. More encompassing. He craved more. It was addicting. It was the same feeling he got when chasing Sherlock through the London streets after some criminal. John felt alive. He felt close to Sherlock in a way that was rare after cohabitating and co-parenting changed most of their lives. Maybe they could have this.
He brushed that thought aside and gathered enough physical bullheadedness to push through. The bottoms of his trousers became wet as he trudged through the damp grass. At the first garden bed, he noted that the gate was properly fastened, and no damage had occurred. His garden was safe. He moved to the next bed where Holmes’ Least Awful Radish Experiment was growing nicely. The radish leaves were barely the width of his hand and a drop of moisture decorated each point of their leaves. Thankful that there were still radishes to admire, Watson turned his attention to inspect the gate and found that this too was fastened as it should be. This garden was also safe.
Arriving at one of the garden beds, Watson sighed away the memory. These small weeds could easily be addressed now before they became larger issues later.
It was Watson who broke the silence first. Even whispering, his voice felt loud and strange in the quiet of that moment. “Have you been awake long?”
“Good heavens, no!” said Holmes looking appalled. “Each time she comes over she keeps sighing and making significant looks at you. She does not need any more encouragement.”
“As I was saying.” Holmes cleared his throat and spoke with the same tone he used when describing the facts of a case. “That some of my deductive reasoning would have, as they say, rubbed off on you.”
With the slam of the door, all fight left Watson. He walked to the table and tossed his hat unceremoniously onto it before slumping into a nearby chair. “Ah, bloody hell,” he said to no one.
“You did, but there is something we did not consider at the beginning of this experiment. As the radish ages, the taste changes. The radish you are holding has been properly watered and tended.”
He sat up and lit a cigarette. Holmes handed it to me and I took a draw before handing it back. I settled on my side and slowly traced concentric circles on his chest. He smoked in silence, then flicked the cigarette into the grate.
He turned his attention to the bike still laying on its side. It had stalled after the fall and was a silently waiting for him to pay attention. He glanced up and down the road. No other traffic had passed him on the little country road he was on, so he went to the prone bike. He bent down and tried to pick-up the bike. The angle was bad, and his scrawny frame could not get enough leverage to life the behemoth. His brief attempt only further scratched the perfect chrome of the tailpipe and handlebar ends.
The creak of a door slowly permeated his blissful cloud. Then came a familiar tapping sound. Mycroft. Unless another one walked with that gait with the accompanying tap from an umbrella, it could be no other. A shadow settled over him and its owner sat next to him.
Holmes placed another book, which had been sitting on the top of a pile, face up, and tapped on a paragraph. “This naturalist writes of a little over seven foot one washing up in America. I encountered a small one by comparison.”
Sherlock recognized the familiar shape leaning on an umbrella in front of an equally familiar silver gleam of his father’s classic car. His brother adored their father’s car and occasionally indulged in driving it.
Holmes was a heavy weight against his side and was getting heavier as they slowly walked up the rocky trail. Watson knew that it was taking effort for Holmes to keep from crying out with pain and his breathing became more laboured as they slowly picked their way around the more trecherous rocks. Watson’s body was aching, but he pushed through it. He could see the top of the cliffs, and he knew, not to the exact step, how long it would take to get home.
The roar of the engine coming to life broke the stillness of the night. There was no chance his parents didn’t hear that. It was time to go. His internal mantra of go, go, go now matching the thumping of his pulse he hears in his ears. He peeled out of the driveway throwing gravel behind him. Taking no notice of any sound ordinances, he twisted the throttle and gripped on tight as he accelerated. The forces wanted to rip him away from his freedom and back to that suffocating cottage.
Pleasantries and post exchanged, Holmes walked up to him holding multiple letters. He held out a letter to Watson. Before Watson could see the address, he smelled the perfume.
Holmes bit the tip of one finger, whilst a finger from the other hand tapped on the book on his lap. His face took on an introspective look that Watson was very familiar with and knew that he would finally be settling down to think.
Not sure what else to do with himself, Watson considered checking on Holmes, but then decided against it. Instead, he opened a bottle of red wine and poured himself a glass.
The misty morning brought a chill to the air that caused Watson’s old wounds to ache. He chose to stay indoors and picked up on the writing he had left the few days before. Holmes had been wandering in and out of the cottage all morning.
“Good. Cause I’m not asking you to join us. It’s a group of independent blokes who get together and go be independent together. Except when one of us hits the deck or rides like a fucking newbie. It’s nice to have another to pick up bloody heavy bikes or tell them they are rubbish at riding motorbikes.”
Holmes twisted slightly in his arms. “I have given your suggestions for the manuscript, the lion’s mane one, some thought.”
The sun was beginning to set, and Holmes’ already long shadow was even longer in the late day sun. Holmes pursued the multitude of radish leaves inside his shadow still in the garden. “Even after fulfilling the experiment and your constant sampling, we have radishes a-plenty.”
Completed with his sketch and numbering, Holmes remarked, "Do you remember the other bed I mentioned?"
Watson tossed Holmes’ nightshirt at him. “I will make tea, but it will stay on the table. After planting the radish seeds for your experiment, I am going to head down to the shore and see what has been washed up. I should have time before the plant sale. You are welcome join if you would like.“
John nodded, and Sherlock continued. “I like ships - pirate ships - and the phenomenon intrigued me.”
“That will have to wait until I finish analysing the data and write it up.” Watson tried to stifle his disappointment, but Holmes caught it anyway. “You are quite mistaken about the honey manuscript, this one is… more to your taste.”
Watson picked up a tea cup and the biscuit tin and poured himself some tea. He sighed and put away the thought of gleaning deeper meaning from the drinkware.
Holmes smirked and stepped closer, effectively trapping their hands in between their bodies. “I could show you one of my favourite habits.” He looked down at Watson’s lips and Watson felt a surge of warmth go through him. “That is, if you are interested.” Watson nodded, and Holmes leaned forward pressing their lips together.
“I have watering cans and will power. Also, the weather has been cool. This radish will taste different from what it might taste like tomorrow, next week, or even when it is ready to harvest.”
After frigid afternoon, I settled by the fire in our rooms in Baker Street to let the warmth drive the chill from my bones. I had just picked up my novel when Holmes tossed his book in disgust.
Holmes smirked. Watson gripped the edge of his hat tighter as he felt his anger rise again. “No, none of that. I am only a few years older than you and my so-called failing memory doesn’t explain it. How can you be sure it wasn’t you?”
“I became accustomed to using them, as they are easy to distinguish from the others and you didn’t seem to mind them leaving the cottage. That’s it, my dear Watson, they are a habit.” He paused briefly. “Just as you retrieving them is your habit.”
My plan, whatever it was, foiled, I let him diveste me of my trousers and drawers. With all he put me through this evening, I was eager to have his skilled mouth on me.
Kneeling, Watson ignored the protest from his leg and immediately examined Holmes. His experienced fingers moving proficiently through the routine motions learned from decades of practice. Holmes’ foot was beginning to swell and his breathing was growing shallow and the sound was a slightly higher pitch. “Stubborn old man, you should have let me come to you.”
“The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. There isn't any other test. If the machine produces tranquillity, it's right.”
After another round of whatever card game they were playing, Stackhurst tried to point his finger at Watson. “Mrs Lloyd, that is her name, has sights and they are good ones. Her sights on you, lucky man.” Stackhurst paused and stared longingly into his cup before continuing. “And whatever she has her beautiful sights on, she gets. She’s a fine, persistent woman.  Oh, the lucky Doctor will be married off this Tuesday.” Stackhurst lifted his glass towards Watson in some sort of solute. He turned to Holmes and tried to sober up a bit. “As for you, you’d best be looking for a new roommate soon, Mr Holmes. One of the professors I was telling you about would be an excellent companion for you. Let me tell you more about him.”
Watson paused, a little taken a back by the question. “Not in my recollection. Do any of the naturalists mention it?”
Sherlock highly doubted that, but was too eager to turn on the bike than argue with the man. He put the key in the ignition and twisted it. Lights blinked on. His body thrummed with anticipation as he mounted the bike and balanced it between his legs. He shimmied, and the heavy weight of the bike wiggled underneath him. Sherlock was certain he was smiling like an idiot.
“Ah, Mr Holmes, you are up to your tricks again.” He wagged a finger at Holmes as he took off his hat and coat. Holmes took them and his walking stick. Stackhurst, who kept his bag, greeted Watson with a smile and a firm handshake.
Snow, whipped up by the wind, was weaving itself into the cracks in my armour of bundled clothing as Sherlock Holmes and I journeyed back home to Baker Street. I glanced at Holmes who was equally bundled and pressed against my side. I reached over and placed my gloved hand on his lower thigh. He looked at me and, even though I could not see his entire expression due to the blue scarf covering his face, I knew there was a smirk there from the look in his eyes. This ride back to Baker Street was agony, but agony laced with the best kind of anticipation.
I groaned and rolled over. If that were the case, I would need to apologize for my actions for it is reprehensible to bond without consent.
But why did this happen now? I live with Holmes, albeit not for a long time, how have I kept from touching him? Was there any accidental brushing of our hands or arms? Or was it something absurdly simple that the layers acting as a barrier were too thick and this was the first-time we had touched with so little between us? No matter what questions I asked, I could not determine its answer.
The non-sequitur caused Watson to pause. “House warming gifts?” He said giving pause in between each word.  As good as he was of following Holmes logic after decades of lodging together, there were moments where he was stumped, and this was one of them. “Is someone we know moving?”
John’s eyes went wide at the sight and his hand flexed with the desire to touch. He knew exactly what Sherlock was doing and it was driving him wild. Any higher-level thinking that had managed to linger after the sight of Sherlock on the bike went offline. He wanted. He wanted his hands on that skin and in that hair. That gorgeous neck begged to be kissed and nipped. He wanted to take that man apart with his mouth.
Watson, who was at the limit of his alcohol consumption for the evening and so nursing his last drink, downed the drink in one gulp and went for another.
That evening, through a quiet dinner of bread, cold meats, and honeycomb, Watson’s mind kept circling back to Holmes and the glassware and why Holmes preferred these glasses. Before dinner, Holmes had come home and disappeared into his laboratory. Before doing so, he left a package on the table. Watson felt worn down from everything and wanted to talk to Holmes. He heard a chair scrape against the wood but still Holmes stayed upstairs.
"Are ones that I have not tried yet. Maybe there is a variety that is slightly better than terrible."
“Holmes,” Watson said quietly. Holmes was hunched over his table and did not respond. “There is dinner downstairs if you would like it. I covered your plate with a cloth.” Holmes remained motionless. “Goodnight, Holmes. And, I’m sorry for this morning.”
Watson had picked up a radish leaf and was curling it around his finger. “I thought we’d have finished the lot we planted after only eating radishes for a fortnight.”
He did not expect after sending off Rosie with Sherlock’s parents for impromptu trip to get ice cream to see
He pushed the door with more force than he intended and then turned to take off his jacket. He stretched up to hang his jacket when a voice behind him made him jump and inhale suddenly. He turned and let out a shaky laughed. “I thought you were with your bees.”
Holmes had acquired tickets to a concert featuring a violinist of some noteworthy skill. The evening of the concert, after making my own preparations, I had come down the stairs working on a cufflink when I saw him bent over the dining table scribbling out a last-minute telegram. The sight of him caused my breath to catch. He was wearing his newest opera attire perfectly fitted to his slim frame. His tailor must be blessed by God, or perhaps he sold his soul to the devil, for Holmes looked impossibly elegant. He looked up and smiled and let his gaze wander over my attire as I approached him. My clothes were not as fine as Holmes’, but he was no less appreciative. His grooming was impeccable, and I fought the urge to run my hands through his hair. We shared a look, and both understood what it meant: yes, but later.
The hansom lurched as it hit a rough patch and my mental drifting was abruptly stopped. Out of the corner of my eye, I looked at the orchestrator of my agonizing state and wondered if he was similarly affected. He was the one who designed this game of anticipation, of more, of desire, of lust. I, as in our professional life, was his partner and co-conspirator and willing to follow wherever he led. The thought of Holmes planning this exquisite torture of our wills only fuelled my impatience and I felt the pooling heat in my gut. I squeezed his thigh, and he turned his head towards me. He gave me a look, and I blushed.  He knew exactly what state I was in. We continued the rest of our snail’s paced journey through the cold in silence.
Thanks to Okapi, OldShrewsburyian, The_Game_is_Afoot, Prune_Cobbler, alltheviolets, SCFrankles for commenting on the fic.
He was quiet as I helped him remove the ruined clothing. I began my examination with gentle prods from my fingers. As I worked, I felt a strange sensation. It felt tingly and extremely pleasant. My brain stuttered; this feeling was impossible because I was wearing gloves. I should not be able to start forming a soul bond. I glanced at Holmes and he remained as impassive as ever. Perhaps I was mistaken. I chose to ignore it and kept my sight on his wound.
Sherlock took another long drag on his cigarette and blew it out slowly. Summer break was just around the corner and bloody interfering Mycroft had plans. He was fine. Perfectly fine. He did not need his nosey brother’s interference or so-called career opportunities that were a flimsy cover for finding another way to control Sherlock's life. He stomped down the pavement fuming, a trail of smoke curling behind him.
While many of London’s occupants and myself were miserable from the heat, my companion was giddy with excitement.
”I will be in town,” Holmes said, picking up his jacket. His voice was cold and aloof. He did not look up at Watson. “As you have made it perfectly clear, you are a doctor and you can take care of yourself. Good day Doctor Watson.”
“Just imagine,” said Watson in a hopeful voice as he motioned to the trellis. “In a week or so, the peas will be ready to harvest. The spinach and lettuce are doing wonderfully and we’ll continue enjoying those. I’ve already been enjoying some older radishes from my other bed, which you are welcome to eat,” said Watson and Holmes shook his head. “At least, we should have some something from the garden to share with Stackhurst at dinner tomorrow.”
Those lips - that deliver deductions that never cease to amaze me, that show his mirth, that I can kiss with mine - were wrapped around my prick. His tongue swirled and teased across the head as I moaned and fought the desire to thrust into the wet heat of his mouth. He bobbed his head and brought his other hand to my work my shaft. I gripped his hair tight to tether myself as pleasure built.
This machine caught his eye. He took a stuttering inhale as his lungs reminded him that oxygen was a requirement for life. Dull. His brain provided that this bike was
He walked up the steps to his flat carrying his latest find. He wanted to try a new combination as his last hit wasn’t as good as the last. He just needed to tweak it.
Watson’s face immediately brightened and “Yes,” was all he could say before Holmes immediately grabbed his hand and led him around the house showing him what window his writing desk would be near. They had a discussion about the location of the Holmes’ laboratory. Holmes wanted to continue his chemistry experiments and Watson wanted the odours away from his writing desk. They had mutually agreed that the middle room upstairs would be the best.
“Or you like radishes, here is a week’s supply. Now that’s settled, how would you summarize our findings dear Watson?
“Just call it gardening. Don’t wax poetically at something that is a pushing around dirt, deterring insects, and killing unwanted plants.”
“I know they are seed packets, but why?” Watson looked at the packets, opened his mouth, closed his mouth, looked at Holmes and back to the packets before finding his voice again. “These are all radishes.”
Watson digested this bit of information as they walked. A car drove pass and they waved while the driver honked at them as he passed.
Watson left to make tea. He returned to find Holmes still thinking and set the tea things by him before returning to his case notes. At least tea was available in case Holmes was interested.
It was not to say that I was unattracted to Holmes. No, the very opposite was true. I felt drawn to his every action. Holmes often went about the house without gloves, where I religiously wore mine. I was mesmerized by the skilful use of his hands when he played his violin or delicately held a test tube. Watching his uncovered hands was shockingly intimate. It was usually saved for when you were with your soul bond partner.
John’s questioning look went ignored as Sherlock searched the space above him. He reached above a rafter and pulled down a set of keys. They rattled in his hand as he searched the work bench retrieving a rag.
Watson, pen in hand, stretched and considered making tea. He had slept poorly the night after the jellyfish attack, needing the reassurance that the man sleeping next to him was still there, warm and breathing. Holmes had tolerated the extra attention until this morning when he entered one of the focused states which was usually left to unravelling a crime. To keep an eye on Holmes and not hover, which would have annoyed Holmes further, Watson chose to stay indoors and organize his case notes. Outside was warm, dry and beautiful, but being away from Holmes was not desirable.
“Uncle Rudy?” What are you doing here? I thought you were in gallivanting across the former USSR working to insure the interests of England gets met,” said Sherlock with a smile. “John, this is my uncle Rudy, he is quite brilliant but we have no idea what he does with his life. Definitely one of my favorite family members.”
“Yes do basically if the crosswalks don’t pop up we’ll report you for being a regular  car in a known drug dealing area, and I am sure that would cause all kinds of awkward for you and the CCTV folks,” said the first officer.
He picked up the phone and called Uncle Rudy with the information he had about the man who was seen taking Sherlock out for breakfast. It was a bit amusing because from the photographs it seems that it is indeed possible to get Sherlock to actually clear a plate of food and no one has ever been able to do that, even when he was a small child. And on that merit alone is enough to let the man be for now. But he still wanted more info, he worked rather hard to get his brother to be sober for more than a month at a time, and he is hoping this time sticks. But Mycroft knew he can’t just go around doing it himself, because it just wasn’t reasonable to do so, but he also didn't want to micromanage Sherlock because he knows that eventually Sherlock would blow up at him and relapse, which happened already twice and he would rather it not happen. Maybe an Army Doctor with an overwhelming need to save people, is just what his brother needs.
Aithne took another sip of wine from her glass, she thought that today was a rather full one, and she felt the weight of continuous boredom that affected her slightly lift, she smirked, things were getting interesting.
“I guess that’s a good night for me too,” said Wolf as he got up from the table. He playfully shove Aithne in a way that most folks would consider really aggressive, but for Aithne she really needed to be knocked off center for it to make a difference. “I’ll get back at him for you,” mouthed Wolf at Aithne.
“John stop for a moment, please” said Uncle Rudy as he turned around. “I want you to understand that while Sherlock is a grown man and perfectly able to make his own decisions. He is also quite often ruled by emotions, and I want you to understand that if you hurt him, and break his heart. I will take you and I will use my highly specific skills and protections to give you a slow and painful death.”
“It looks wonderful, William, I’m sure who ever gets it will love it,” said Sherlock. “You put a lot of work into it. So is this for a friend or um... you know what I am not going to ask anymore.” He smiled and opened his arms for a hug, and William ran into it.
“Um... uh what if you want to?” Said Molly slightly shifting uncomfortably under Mike and John’s stares.
Sherlock looked at Molly and tried to shoot a believable smile, “Molly, I’m,” Sherlock paused, the words weird caught in his mouth, he looked at John who was stroking his hands. Sherlock swallowed, “I’m sorry, you were only trying to be nice; but I want some privacy tonight because I just want to focus on John. Err this is John, he’s great I just met him tonight. Also I am gay, I am not good at identifying when women are interested in me because the social mores on the heterosexual world is a touch bit different from that in the gay world. I am sorry I should’ve realized this sooner. But thanks for taking considerations with me, you have been nice. I... hope we keep meeting at the lab.”
Siger looked into the fire as well, he took a sip of tea. "Do you think we could've stopped any of that? I mean what if we were in the city instead of the manor? Do you think they could've gotten friends and turn out different. I mean it was only us out in the country for so long? Do you think we isolated them? I mean the only other child was Victor, and he was the ground keeper's son? I mean we both enjoyed our solitude, but do you think that was really a good way of raising kids, knowing what we know now? I mean yes they did not get along with other kids when we tried to have them meet with our colleagues's kids, but what if we really pushed it? Come to think of it what ever happened to the Hunter family? You knew the husband from Cambridge and the wife taught there as well."
Basically I am on what I think is day 12 of shelter in place and while I am working from home these days. I am actually rather busy, but the plot bunnies come at random times and actually reminds me to not work 24/7.
“Oh Sherlock dear, don’t worry about that, we just want you to be happy. John has been so good for you. Yes you had your rough spots with him but what relationship doesn’t have hard times. And we don’t care about the grandkids, if anything we’ll treat Rosie as a grand child if you allow us to,” said Violet.
“Oh fucking finally,” exclaimed John as he tried to shift to get Sherlock to hit the right spot, but Sherlock shifted his thrusts to avoid that spot. “FUCKING HELL SHERLOCK! Please, I am begging you.” He let out an exceedingly loud moan when Sherlock pressed down on the spot with expert precision, his other hand slapping John’s ass hard, but he immediately moved away from the spot. John whimpered, “please.”
"That may not be developmentally appropriate for two people in their 30's and one in their 40's," mentioned Sherlock. "I mean unless we are doing this over a casket or something, that's the point where siblings try to reunite right?"
"Yes Sherlock, I am doing perfectly fine, the walk helped calm me down and talking with Paul also helped. How about you, are you really doing fine? replied John, he raised a hand which ghosted over Sherlock's shoulder.
“Ugh, you know what congrats, and Nugget, I hope you are actually hitting that, because no one could ever get William to bed in all senses of the word, the fucking tease,” the rude man stomped away.
John smiled and kissed Sherlock's shoulder, "thanks for putting up with my moods and being such a good parent for Rosie."
Sherlock's shoulders tensed up, "well you certainly weren't that many of them. I think I've worked through that already." He shifted uncomfortably in the couch.
He looked at the world clock on his wall, it was 4 am in San Francisco. He figured this was a call worth waking up for. He picked up the phone and called Dr. Hunter.
“John wouldn’t you want to get rid of all of the padding,” Said Sherlock with a smirk as he ran a finger along the waistband of John’s trousers.
Paul laughed, "we are most certainly avoiding alcohol, but there is a fancy coffee shop around the corner that gives people trying to stay sober free coffee, so let's get some free 7£ coffee. Yeah I've had the urge to drink all day, let's put it this way, I've have been wandering this park long enough to be stopped by multiple guys thinking I am cruising."
“This may have taken you from the war and stopped you from continuing as a surgeon but it brought you to me,” Said Sherlock before kissing John again. He pulled back and dropped to his knees, roughly pulling down John’s pants and trousers. He licked his lips at seeing John’s rather large cock, it was big, he knew he was going to struggle with this one but he wasn’t worried, he was determined. “I knew it was big, I didn’t know it was going to be that big.” He swirled his tongue around the tip, and slowly took John’s length down his throat, he tilted his head to get the full length in. It was thick and he was quite surprised with himself, he was struggling to breath and his eyes were tearing up but still he carried on.   He swore it was only getting bigger, he was up for the challenge.
John turned on the shower, “I think I actually moving that into green column.” He started lathering up a sponge and started scrubbing down Sherlock as Sherlock was busy trying to wash his hair.
Ella narrowed her gaze at the two of them. "Okay now you got me worried again. Otherwise how have things been? I know that you both recently started sharing a room since Rosie turned 2 and john felt like she was too old to have her dad as a roommate. Has it brought up any issues?"
Violet called out, "John, it's me Violet, Sherlock's mum,  do you mind if me and Siger come over as well."
His phone pings, he sees that he has received a text alert from his money management. Apparently he made £11,000 donations to People Animal Wellness Services. He pulled up the website they trained service animals using a wider range of dog breeds so as to be able to make service dogs to fit the needs of individuals. He sighed, it wasn't too big of a deal for him, and he hopes that it will be helpful, but usually donations that big have ceremonies and he didn't want any of that.
Josephine started laughing, “yeah what was the diversion plan for that one because it failed spectacularly.” She turned to Hiram.
Sherlock reappeared with a bottle of lube and a couple of condoms, “oh aren’t you a good soldier, waiting for me to give you an order.” He turned around, and grabbed John’s hair and guided his head till John’s face to his ass. “Come on, soldier show me what that tongue can do.”
John looked at the whole scene  impressed at Sherlock’s observation, “definitely not our usual participant.” He was definitely intrigued by the man, John thought that the man was definitely interesting and even if they weren’t flat mate material he’d want to be the man’s friend, if not the very least would be getting Mike or Molly to share more about him.
Sherlock smirked, “yeah let’s go, the game is on.” They both ran down the alley leaving a very amused Mike, who waved up at the witnesses from the roof top party, and went back to the testing site.
He pulled out a device that looked like GPS, with some random bright lights on top, it was a cloaking device, that created a blind spot on all the CCTV devices as he passed by, the bright blinking lights made sure that any cameras that were still on, couldn’t get a clear look. It also had the capability of turning all the lights ahead of him green. He pulled on a hoodie and a baseball cap.  And with that he tore down the road, he didn’t really care where he was going as long as he didn’t kill anyone or did any property damage he was going to be okay.
John looked worried, "I messed up, I shouldn't have punched you when you came back and I definitely shouldn't have beat you in the morgue two years ago. I mean I have been working on my outbursts and I won't let it happen again."
Sherlock leaned into John’s touch, and accepted when John delivered a rather chaste kiss. He gasped when John roughly grabbed his hair. His cock dribbled even more.
“Yes, that is perfectly fine, Mr. Holmes,” replied Amir. He who was curious about what was about to unfold.
“Yes,” rasped Sherlock, he was harder than he could imagine possible. Oh yes this definitely kills the boredom, he almost didn’t care if this went completely south. He wouldn’t be the only person to die from sex at a rave and truly it wouldn’t be the worst possible death he could possible die given his recent stint in the country.
Sherlock gasped, as the fresh air hit his sweat soaked hair and face. He could see his reflection in one of the surfaces of the machinery in the shed. His hair was poofy and frizzy from the humidity in the hood. Still he was struggling from the headrush of being upside down. He took deep breaths as he could but he was so full that it almost didn’t feel like a possibility for him.  That struggle for air only got worse as his Daddy started fucking his face while firmly keeping a hand on his throat. Finally his Daddy shot his load and pulled back, Sherlock sputtered but tried to swallow his Daddy’s cum but still it hurt so much to breath, he needed to be able to breath fully. He needed the tentacle out of him. “Daddy, please…”
Sherlock smirked against John’s shoulder, “deep down you know you won’t.” But he felt John actually try to pull off. He through an arm around John’s chest and threw both of themselves down, pinning John to the mattress, and fully shoving his cock into John’s ass. He started thrusting hard into John while biting his shoulder. He delivered long hard thrust almost pulling out each time only to slam his full length in.
Sherlock pauses for a moment, “come along John, let’s just get out of this crowd already, must you be so slow.”
Mycroft immediately felt like an asshole, he was tearing down the road of some council housing, they really didn’t need some loud as fuck car tearing down their road recklessly.  He sighed, “okay tell me the intersections and they should be there by the end of this week, i’ll even check on it personally.”
Kayla smiled, "okay, so we all agreed the basement is awful? Great, Sherlock take hold of your clicker so we are essentially going to walk around the first floor while you click for okay areas and buzz for nope spots. Also name spots that you want Toby to be aware of. Basically you are going to do this every day until she is familiar with your building. And since I'll be coming in regularly for the next couple of weeks I can definitely tell you when you don't have to mark out the boundaries anymore.
She was smart obviously, she entered Cambridge at 16, graduated with honors, went on to a challenging doctoral program at Stanford and  ultimately ended up becoming an associate professor for an university that was equally competitive. Otherwise she seemed to be well liked by her colleagues and her students liked her because she seemed to be genuinely interested in teaching people, which is considered rare for tenure tracked professors. She also volunteers in a free clinic dedicated to multi-diagnosed LGBTQ people. But Eurus was smart too, and she was beyond what anyone has ever seen. He is sure that if given the chance Eurus would be very able to cultivate a likable persona, because isn't that what people with Antisocial Personality Disorder do. What if this was just some long con. He wouldn't be surprised if this was some long game for Eurus.
“Good because we both know at this point I’m always going to take whatever you can give me,” Said Sherlock. He got on John’s lap and pressed a fairly chaste kiss against John’s mouth. He pulled back to look at John and smiled at John’s breathless expression.
"Oh well we all know from that time we found his fetlife, he's a masochist," replied Aithne, she slightly shuddered.
Sherlock nodded, “okay Mrs, Hudson, we might as well give John a good welcome, we don’t want to scare him off.”
John shoved his tongue between Sherlock’s ass cheeks,  barely hit the mark. He struggled to get deep enough. He didn’t use his hands because Sherlock didn’t say he could. He relished Sherlock’s tight grip as his face was roughly shoved against Sherlock’s ass.
Sherlock sighed, "okay I am going to be honest with you, I've never had sex, I don't even like most forms of physical contact. Yet, I want to do things with John and I am afraid that if we were to try and I react poorly. It will ruin things and John will eventually leave me. I mean John likes sex, like for a good chunk of the time we were living together, he had a long string of one night stands and many attempts at dating. I am not sure if that is something I can do right now or maybe even ever." Sherlock swallowed, brought his hands to his face, and curled in on himself, remained silent.
you when you have known each other for less than a day,” Said Sherlock as he leaned into John’s touch. “How about you?”
"Okay Sherlock, do you think it would be okay to bring John back from behind the screen," asked Ella.
John closed his eyes and took a deep breath, he knew that Sherlock wasn’t doing it on purpose, but his proximity to his cock and  his groaning was making him feel feelings he trying to crush at the moment, because just earlier that day physical intimacy was definitely one of those topics on the table for therapy. He tried to will away the slowly developing stiffness, he hoped Sherlock couldn’t feel it. Sherlock wiggled a bit more in John’s lap, and the movement made John gasp, because it felt really good. He forced himself to look down at Sherlock.
William pealed himself away from his dad and grabbed the car and handed it to his Papa, who immediately started examining it.
John's hands drifted, one of them resting on Sherlock’s throat and the other caressed Sherlock's cheek, wiping away a tear. He smiled at Sherlock who still stared at him in awe, he could get used to this. And he decided to push Sherlock to the very edge, he tightened his grip around Sherlock’s throat and the hand that was caressing Sherlock’s cheek drifted over his nose and John pinched his nose shut. Effectively making it so that Sherlock had no way of breathing, he enjoyed the sensation that was of Sherlock’s body fighting to function, he finished cumming with a bit of a shout that made him dart his head around to make sure he didn't attract anyone with his shout. He kept note of the fact that Sherlock still had his hands up, he was impressed with Sherlock's ability to push himself, he thought that if he was in a more private spot and with more time just how much he can break Sherlock, because he was sure that he would be beautiful to rebuild. He softened his grip on Sherlock, his fingers ghosted over Sherlock’s neck and gently wiped away a few stray tears. “Stand up Private, you know I may work you hard, but I believe in rewarding hard work,” said John with a bit of an edge.
“Oh g-d he is so dramatic, I fucking love it,” said Rica, one of the med intern volunteers. She was doubled over in laughter. “Well if you excuse me, I now need to join the other half of that duo in the morning after clinic.”
Andrea looked at Mycroft and wondered if this rich boy had no concept of how much things actually cost in this city. She started pondering if he actually ever looks at how much things cost, his brother seemed to have some concept of money but if she remembered right, his foray into drug misuse caused his fund to get restricted. "I may be your right hand, but I am still only getting paid like a government employed executive assistant, I mean you really are pushing the "other duties as assigned" part of my job description. The only reason I stick around is the fact that this is exciting. Otherwise I could easily get paid at least £10,000 more a year if I was to move to one of the financial institutions, of course I feel like I could also potentially be black balled and therefore never able to work again," said Andrea internally amused at Mycroft's uncomfortable squirming.
John heard Sherlock's mother. He mouthed "your mum" to Sherlock. Violet asked to join them for Tea. John replied, "not a problem at all, we should be back home by 3:30, but that's around Rosie's nap time, so if you want to be around while Rosie is awake and playful, I'd suggest swinging by  around 5." He smacked his head, and mouthed to Sherlock, "I'm sorry." Violet talked a bit more to John. "Will do, Mrs. Holmes, see you later. Tell Mycroft we hope he still comes by, because some conversations are better had in person," responded John and he hung up the phone. He rushed over to Sherlock, "I'm sorry, I should've asked first."
John huffed, and looked at a rather confused Rosie and then turned to Kayla, “Do you think you can do it?” He said holding back a slight laugh.
Sherlock and John settled in on their respective seats, “well at least they are comfortable,” said Sherlock.
“Enough,” said Siger, “Mycroft, give your brother a chance. Sherlock, you try to see where he is coming from and try to talk with him to see where compromises can be made. Violet, you and I are going to have to really examine how we consider what ‘trying’ is in this family. Also nice use of “i” statements.”
Papa chuckled at the name but stopped when he saw William frown. Papa said, “Did you know that in my family it was customary to call at least one son William? It made parties very confusing, it wasn’t pleasant.”
She looked at her calendar, she was indeed due for a sabbatical. Maybe she could quietly take it and spend the year trying to work with Eurus privately. No one needed to know what she was doing, she could just say she is taking a break from academia to focus on learning new techniques to potentially implement at Russo house, she could be one of them asshole psychiatrists who says they did some soul searching in some eastern country to rebrand centuries old techniques as some commodity to be used in the self help market. Or she could just say she is volunteering in another country but that would mean the hospital would want her taking pics for their social media campaigns and that can get sticky real fast. Or she could just say she needed the time to work on her issues, but that could easily bring in too many questions. This could be doable, but she was feeling a little too emotional and sentimental , and she always made stupid decisions when she was feeling like that. Maybe she needed a second opinion.
“Don’t be silly Sherlock, I see you here almost on a weekly basis, how else do you think we started talking. I mean if I met you while you were sneaking into the lab, I would never have bothered learning more about you,” Said Molly as she smiled and tossed her hair back. Her smile faltered when she saw that John had an arm wrapped around Sherlock and he was leaning into John. “Okay how about I sit you down here at your favorite table, right where you can see everyone and we can play a game of deductions, there is a group of tourists here that I am dying to see what you have to observe about them.”
“Hmm... what was that Sherlock?” Said John trying to pretend he wasn’t listening but the idea of Sherlock being a power bottom using him like he was nothing but a living dildo was playing out in his head. He unfortunately started to feel a slight hard on developing just from the thought of Sherlock being a powerbottom. He moved the newspaper lower so that he could hide his rapidly developing hard on because his cock was a bit hard to miss.
John let out an even deeper sigh and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Sherlock, I haven’t binged drink or drunk alone in 6 years, here’s my phone.” He handed Sherlock his phone showing the scratches around the charging port.
Mycroft nodded his head in acknowledgment. His parents got up and exited for the second time today. Mycroft called out to his parents, "also I am going to have to charge you for the door."
John and Sherlock have just finished case and they decide to indulge in some incredibly filthy pig play. John plans fo push Sherlock to his limits during this session.
Some time around when he was seven after yet another fight where he knocked out yet another boy telling him what he could and couldn’t do, his fathers took him to a psychiatrist. The lady told them about how a lot of Williams behavior issues didn’t come from a lack of mother in his life or some trauma he couldn’t remember; she said that it was a pretty obvious case of gender dysphoria. She suggested to Papa and Dad that he start living his life in a way that fit him. He got a hair cut, dad helped him paint his room a color he wanted, papa took him shopping for new clothes and even got him a custom suit. Untie Harry introduced him to some ladies they knew from a long time ago who were sort of like him, and those ladies introduced him to some other kids who were just like him. He liked hanging out with those kids, Papa and Dad did not have fun with cleaning the slime out of his pants and trousers when he tried packing with a home made packer and it exploded (Papa at the last minute remembered that salt could break apart polymers and thus the clothing was saved). Papa ended up teaching all of the kids in the Trans Youth Program how to work with silicone, and there was no more slime explosions after that. When the silicone packers got a little too stiff and unwieldy, Mama Hudson knitted him a packer that provided just the right amount of bulge with no stiffness problem
John watched the young man walk away, thinking, “well that was interesting. Hmm 221 B Baker St.” He shrugged his shoulders and thought what’s the worst that can happen, decision made, he was going to see Sherlock again, and it will be to look at an apartment together. This could be the start of something interesting.
Sherlock rolled off John and sat next to him on the sofa, he held out his hand which John took into his. John rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, and Sherlock leaned his head on top of John’s head. They were both smiling. Sherlock turned to John, “So was that okay?”
"Okay so, I am giving the five minute call now, after that you take the small slips of paper write your top 3 on them and I will just put them all on the board and chuck the scraps into the fire that way the terms are randomized and no one can outright ban one a rule because they are annoyed with a person," declared John.
They ended up at the curb in front of 221 Baker Street. Kayla turned to Sherlock and handed him a cue card.
John passed a cup around and all the Holmes placed their scraps of paper into it and handed it back to John. He nodded, "okay each term will get it's own sheet and if we feel a term is too similar to one already up, then we are going to put it down on the same sheet and we will create a new term combining the best of those terms."
“Sorry, I forgot about the uh...” Mike gestured to his own shoulder, “But nice touch with the camo pants, really drives the left hanky home, also it leaves nothing to the imagination. Some lucky boy or girl or lucky person who exists outside of the gender binary, will want to take you home tonight.”
John shrugged, "yeah that's fine, but we'll have guests at 5. And we need to go to the shops real quick, it is a rather last minute thing."
"What kind of action are you planning to take Mycroft and to what end?" Asked Anthea, concerned for her boss, whom she at times thought of as a friend, not that she wanted to admit that to anyone. And she would be fully capable of killing anyone who found out.
John looked down to join sherlock in the search from his bottoms, “oh god, I still have the condom on,” he winced as he pulled it off and threw it into the dumpster. He burst out into even more laughter.
Kudos and comments are lovely, I mean I think i will keep churning these out because I am bored out of my mind post top surgery.
"Okay let's go," said Kayla as she made headway to the door, "always remember to keep disposal bags, because even though Toby is completely toilet trained, it is best not to forget them. Let's actually start with that."
Sherlock shot a thumbs up at Jeanine. He got to the middle of floor and instantly fell into the beat. He moved with the music and gyrated his hips in time. He felt warm from the drink and he started to feel the boredom soften as the music’s beat started to really take hold of him. The light touches started coming in, and it was actually pleasant. He could feel his heart almost beat in time with the music. He could feel so much, he could feel the beat of the music beating the boredom out of him. He could feel... he could fucking feel more than the almost never ending mind numbing boredom that took him. He smiled as he felt the gentle brushes and at times rough grips of people who surrounded him on the dance floor. He knew that people were staring because people always did that when he went dancing. It was one of the few times where he can be brilliant and not offend people, but he felt a particularly hard set of eyes on him, but he couldn’t pick it up. He was completely sloshed. Sherlock opened up his body language and let him self really be touched. People started grinding up against him, and he let himself feel the sensations, he didn’t feel the need to shut himself down.
“I want you to crawl to the bedroom, strip, and kneel down and wait for me,” John roughly pushed Sherlock down. He playfully swatted at Sherlock as he crawled away.
John watched as Sherlock walked away, he smirked at Sherlock’s slightly uncomfortable shuffle because he knew, he could just feel it that Sherlock won’t be forgetting John any times soon. He took a few more deep breaths mentally preparing himself to go back into the loud dark space that was the rave. It put him on edge in a way he couldn’t really finger. He assumed it was how the music made the ground shake and the occasional sirens and explosion sounds sampled by the DJ he thought if anything this would be a shit place to have a panic attack. He thought back to Sherlock, he realized that it wouldn’t be a bad thing to leave early because he knew that there was something to look forward to. That was not a thing he had in a long time. He walked down the steps and immediately scanned the room, he saw Sherlock drinking a ton of water. He was slightly amused at the bar tender refilling the cup with water the moment he put it down. He finally spotted his sister, whose birthday he was there to help celebrate but he felt like he stuck out like a sore thumb, so that was why he was just sitting in a dark corner until the perfection that was Sherlock came his way.
He hit the corner with a bit of a drift, the flash of cop lights dropped. He started laughing, he veered out of the turnabout. His eyes drifted towards the rear view mirror there was already a car chasing after him. The officers was obviously trying to use their radio to report his car, he adjusted the dial on his cloaking device. The officers looked confused because it was obvious that their scanners weren’t working. They also looked dreadfully confused, but of course not only was their radios not working but also the sedan may look like a shitty car one would give their teenager, but with all cars it’s what on the inside that counts. He smirked, he spent quite a few weeks gutting this terrible nondescript sedan that looked very much at home as the car of a teenager whose wealthy parents were upset at him. Not that he was one of those kids, his grades were immaculate and the teachers loved him, his peers not so much, but did they ever truly matter. No his parents got a rather awesome car for him to use during breaks when he was a teenager. Sherlock had the terrible car, mainly because he was ridiculously impulsive and half the time he would wreck whatever car he was using in the name of science, they just kept getting him cars though because he kept all kinds of weird things in his car, and it was a lot better for him to just drive them, then it was to see Sherlock deal with the cops because they were concerned about him carrying a couple of dead animals simply because he wanted to perform an autopsy on them.
Sherlock smirked at just how easy it was for him to just open John after all the attention he paid. And he got a certain level of pleasure at watching John beg for more. He added a second finger and started to really stretch John open because Sherlock knew just how hard he wanted to push John.
John noted that Sherlock was out for 10 seconds, okay that was the high end of average. Both times he saw this happen has been in times where Sherlock is dealing with intense interpersonal conflict.
"How are you and your partner still together after all that has happened? I mean I've tried to stay with my boyfriend but he called it quits after I attacked him when he surprised me in bed. I mean it was my birthday and I know before I was shipped out he would love to surprise me in bed, but after I came back being surprised like that just kicked in a response, I thought I was getting attacked in my sleep," said Paul, sounding very distraught. He was fighting back tears. "I mean yes I know now how to avoid things from going that far. And I understand why he isn't going to take me back, but that doesn't stop me from missing him. I just miss him, and it is hard to think of a life where I can go back to having a romantic partner. I mean I think I miss that, but really I think I just miss him and everything that came with him, I mean I don't have any more friends since it happened, I mean the weekly visits to the group is my only time where I am not alone. I mean it doesn't help that I mainly work freelance and work at home, I don't even know if I can put into practice all we learned from group because I don't really have anyone to practice it on."
John started laughing, “Boy, I hope you didn’t terrify your land lady, you better apologize to her after we are done.”
“Well we cannot have that happening,” John laughed and opened the door to his bed sit, “now get the fuck out.”
Sherlock nodded, "I know I can't, but it is hard to choose. I don't want to make the wrong choice." His phone rang, it was Mycroft, which was confusing for that time of day but it must've been important if it was such an odd hour. "You cried to mummy, Sherlock," hissed Mycroft.
Blaze glared at Scott, “you are going to need the rest of legal team for that decision, your wife doesn't count as the whole team.”
Blaze turned to his dad and loudly said “hey dad did you know Aithne is going to visit Eurus in a top secret prison facility?” He gave a twitchy smile that went between that shifted whatever it was his eyes were pleading it was sliding between “I am fucking trying to participate in this family” and “I know something terrifying.”
“Good bye,” replied Mycroft, he thought the doctor to be rather weird and he still felt uneasy about the situation as a whole.
Sherlock looked at the video doorbell and saw it was his parents, “Hello mum and dad, I am just going to buzz you in. Rosie is taking her nap and we didn’t want to wake her to answer the door.”
"It is what it is," repeated John. "If it makes you feel better, your mother was giving Mycroft one hell of a scolding."
Sherlock enthusiastically scrambled to his feet and stood against the brick wall. He had a big goofy grin on his face, he stood against the wall. He was fidgety with anticipation. John stepped up to him, Sherlock smirked as he noticed that John did not use his cane to get up and walk to sherlock.
Sherlock nodded, “I’m thinking about taking Ro to the barber tomorrow after we have a talk with the school about the uniform situation. I figure it will make a good first step in the socially transitioning him.”
"I wish I could be better at this, I mean this can't possibly be good for you, and I mean what if I mess up even more. I get it supposedly PTSD is something that can go away, but I don't know if it will go away for me. And I know I set you off, and I could only imagine what it could do to Rosie. I think you are both better off without me," said John rather dejectedly.
John quickly propped Sebastian in a way that made it seem like he fell off the toilet and hit his heads which wasn’t too unusual in the house so it might even work. He got up and checked on Sherlock, who didn’t seem to have any major injuries. “Hey darling, sorry about that, but we need to get out of here before anymore trouble appears.” He smiled as Sherlock got up, “that’s a good boy, get dressed we’ll get out of here okay.”
"My dad broke our stuff in arguments, it was never his stuff. I hated it when he would punch the wall as well. Arguments happened really easily when I was growing up. And no matter how small the argument, the results was always the same," said John, he was rather stiff when he talked about his dad.
“Well the message isn’t getting delivered if you can’t find the will power to will power to do what you are asking other people to do,” replied John.
"I am not sad!" Cried out Mycroft, "I am wearing a mask, so children what about me makes you all think I am sad."
Sherlock realized almost instantly that he made a mistake, because as soon as he gripped John's hand. John had sat bolt up and pinned Sherlock by his wrist, he looked to be in a rage, John was having a nightmare. Sherlock tried to keep calm, he didn't me want to make this worse. He flinched when John's grip on him grew tighter, John raised a hand, when suddenly he felt John get knocked off of him. Toby tackled John off of the bed, she was licking and pawing at John, who was struggling and still seemed to be asleep. Sherlock took a deep breath and tried to stay in the moment, "John wake up!"
Wolf turned to Aithne, “apparently your brother skipped last month’s and this month’s Invega, so it looks like we are going to have to titrate him up again.”
Yeah I know the American Healthcare system is fucked up, but like a good chunk of time spent with my pen pals when they visited the US was taking them to Costco so that their parents could get them fitted for smaller profile hearing aids. I figure because there was a time in history when NHS was giving kids outdated medical equipment because it was what they had in stock. And like I’ve helped enough trans folks from the UK to know that trans health in the UK can be a bit fucked up in terms of waitlist and meeting the requirements for surgery. So those who have the money sometimes choose to come and get surgery here in the US. Many of whom are doing it while studying abroad. Yes, there are indeed methods starting recently that would allow trans kids, even those on blockers, to save options for reproduction in the future. I figure in 12 years time it will get more accessible.  Fucking hell though the last medical conference I was at, this doctor approached me and asked if I could convince her kid to undergo the treatment despite it being experimental. The kid was only 13, and very firmly against having kids; so I loudly exclaimed “you would force a 13 year old to have a child!” And I bounced because I saw a bunch of people who I knew were pediatric psychiatrists and one of the doctors who invented the methods used for preserving fertility approach her and it definitely looked like an argument broke out the next time I passed by them.
John took a deep breath and rolled into Sherlock's hug, he looked into Sherlock’s eyes, “thanks Sherlock.”
"I don't know it seems to have a certain aged charm to it," said Paul trying to keep a straight face. "Also not going to lie, I did accept an offer, thought it would take off the edge."
John grabbed Mycroft around the waist and threw him down with a suplex, he scrabbled up and kneeled on top of his chest, “Okay why are you fine with me living with him only if i can provide you info but other wise you want me gone.”
John smiled against Sherlock’s neck, “love you too.” He pressed a few soft kisses along his jawline. He rolled Sherlock onto his back.
"Oh she is your new case. I mean I think you should think about it before doing it. She is a driving force for you, maybe you should just at least visit and sense if she can work out here, but acting without thinking will be quite dangerous," replied Crystal.
Meanwhile John was inside of the first floor of 221Baker Street. He didn't go straight up to flat B, and he felt bad for leaving Sherlock alone with his parents, given that he didn't want to be alone with them in the first place but he felt like he wasn't ready to step back in yet. He was sure it was probably calmer now that Mycroft left, but he wasn't sure why Sherlock didn't like being alone with them in the first place. He contemplated just take Rosie out for a longer walk but he realized that he didn't have any gear for taking Rosie out longer, and he also thought of leaving Rosie with Mrs. Hudson while he went for a walk.
Sherlock looked at the cut, “I think we are going to have to repeat that because if felt secondary to the rest of the experience.”
"Breaks please," Aithne looked at the board, "I need you to come with me, a second set of eyes would be helpful because there are things I miss unfortunately and you are very much able to fill up my blind spots."
John swallowed, took a deep breath, "there were things done and said that didn't need to happen and shouldn't have ever happened. As much as we could just get on with it, being it was what it was, it didn't need to stay that way. If it kept the way it was going it was going to destroy Sherlock and I, and keeping apart hurt just as much. So I went back to therapy to handle my anger issues and PTSD, I was having difficulty dealing with the visits."
Sherlock made it a point to copy John as much as he could, he didn’t want to disappoint John. He felt a flutter of happiness every time John flashed him a giant smile of approval at Sherlock’s ability to follow John. Sherlock was absolutely vibrating with excitement by the time they made it up the three flights of creaky stairs up to John’s room. It was a rather sad thing with a desk, a small bed, and an incredibly sad kitchenette that was only a microwave and a tea kettle. There was a dresser and a door Sherlock assumed went to the bathroom.
“That could be anyone,” Said John inching closer to his shit “kitchenette”, the man was next to his desk so the gun was out of the question, but a knife will have to do. He didn’t like what this stranger was doing.
"I want to hear you say it," said John, as he enjoyed the view that was Sherlock rutting against the sheets of their bed.
John stepped up to Sherlock, and place a hand firmly around the back of his neck, “stop squirming and in the future I will tolerate that, but since this is our first time playing like this, I will let you be, but you are going to listen to me when I tell you when you did something wrong. And you are going to do everything in your power to never repeat it.” He guided Sherlock from his current kneeling position where he was slumped down. “When I tell you to kneel I want you to give me your fullest attention, when you allow yourself to rest like that your mind is going to wander, is that clear?”
"I know but it just makes it worse for me, sex tends to come with drinking for me. And given that I already had a craving, getting a blow job out in the bushes by some silver fox looking fellow, really didn't help," said Paul frustrated. "Still he was fucking sexy as hell, like total dad bod but his hair just really made it work, like you could look at him and think, yes that man will take good care of me. And oh he took such good care of me." He laughed, "maybe I should've gotten his number, the man had a chip keychain so I am just going to assume he is also working on sobriety and I imagine sober friends with benefits would be an excellent thing. Yeah I was triggered today by the stupidest thing."
Siger turned to Violet, “maybe we can slow down on that for a second, we don’t want to scare Sherlock and John, for all I know you are secretly planning a wedding. And I hope you aren’t because we saw the pictures of the wedding Sherlock helped plan, and they look like Sherlock is more than capable of planning his own wedding.”
The pup rolled his eyes before diving in its meal, it did appreciate that his Master took the time to make sure the temperature was easy to eat. It finished its meal and looked up at its Master. It smiled as Master gave it head scritches.
Aithne stared at her glass not really paying attention to anything, her mind was just full of her at the moment just sorting through paper work and figuring out the billing codes that companies won't through a fit over for some of the more unusual treatment expenses for the clients. She was telling her sister the story of her and Eurus and that was pretty much autopilot at this point.
John shrugged, "I mean I think Sherlock has something he wants to talk about but I am not sure if he wants me in on the conversation."
Francis sighed, “yeah too late about that, she already is all up in the social media surrounding the announcement.”
"No it was a good one, it was a couple's appointment, and well we thought it would be a good idea to invite his parents over for tea, and the brother showed up and it went to shit, I need a drink," said John.
“Well, Mycroft, the answer is still no, I rather like your brother and he certainly likes me, and given how that waitress acted when she saw him eating and your presence, one can guess he is terrible at taking care of himself. I for one rather like taking care of people, so we might just balance each other out.” He tried to stand up even taller against Mycroft being so close to his personal bubble.
John sucked in a deep breath, this was a new position for Sherlock, and he was a bit shocked. He smiled down at Sherlock who was staring up at John. “Would it be okay if I touch your hair?”
Sherlock shrugged, “okay I guess. I will be nicer to Mycroft, I am pretty sure he is the reason behind Wiggins being on Norovir and Irene gettting her dream school.”
Sherlock gestured towards the bedside drawer, John opened it, only to be greeted with an absurd amount of stuff ranging from candy wrappers to coins to scraps of paper to a variety of small jars, he forgoed the unlabeled jars because he didn’t want to risk it, he considered the vaseline but skipped it when he came across a jar of coconut oil which John assumed Sherlock kept for his hair... or he didn’t know maybe some general moisturizer. He really couldn’t imagine Sherlock wanking. Hopefully he wouldn’t mind the use.
Mycroft stared at his parents, his shoulders slightly slouched and he let out a deep breath. “Okay I’ll level with you on that, but at the same time, things could’ve gone a lot worse if not for my intervention.”
Sherlock awkwardly placed a hand on the waistband of John’s boxer briefs. He looked down and swallowed. He wasn’t exactly sure what to do, and didn’t want to mess up.
“But yeah Francis and Scott were getting ready to go to boarding school which was the same for the oldest Holmes kid, Mycroft. They didn’t get along, but you can tell Mycroft was the kind of oldest sibling who was left with all the responsibilities of being a third parent. But that doesn’t excuse him from being the fucking asshole he was. But yeah I think he is probably still going to be an asshole, but probably a broken one, all the conversations I got, makes me think his parents are pissed at him, and he probably was so full of familial duty, he seems like there isn't much else in his life. Well he was a bit rough and made fun of Francis when he had to read something out loud for a game and proceeded to tell Scott to shut up every time he got chatty, basically you know being a damn fucking asshole,” a timer goes off, Aithne looks at her phone and makes her way for the door.  “I’ll be back, it’s a good story but it isn’t worth pissing at the dinner table, i’ll be back from the loo in like 5.”
But John and Sherlock didn’t seem to notice, they were both absolutely absorbed in their kiss, they both pulled back at the same time, absolutely breathless. They stared at each other and started laughing.
“Thank you sir,” said Sherlock. He slowly lowered his arms shaking them to revive some circulation into them. “Well you did say no one would question if I was just in my underwear, i’m going to take that as a challenge,” added Sherlock as he unbuttoned and shrugged off his shirt.  He smiled at the hungry stare John gave him. He swallowed, almost missing the weight of John’s cock down his throat. He hissed when his cock was finally freed from his pants.
"I never could've hoped things for you could turn out this way. It isn't perfect but it is more than we ever expected for you, Sherlock. You used to be so lonely, but look at you, you got people who love you and are willing to work with you and on themselves to make it work. Sherlock I really am happy for you and proud of what you have achieved," said Violet.
Kayla shrugged, "maybe for one of our outings we can go to one of the farmer's markets and hopefully there are some honey folks there."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at his mother's choice of words, but he looked at John as if silently consulting with John to see whether or not they tell his parents. He knew his parents wouldn't like the answer and would probably be very concerned about it, and would probably have a ton of concern for Rosie on top of it and given their renewed efforts in their kids' lives. Sherlock was concerned that this would cause John and him unneeded issues, given that they were already working on the issues at hand and to have more than likely unhelpful input would make things harder.
Sherlock was shocked at the sudden turn of event especially because the door was still open. And he wasn’t sure if Mrs. Hudson would be coming up to see them. His knees gave out on him.
"Yeah I wouldn't want him having the info either, he has a delightful skill at picking apart people and ruining them," said Danny the driver.
“Personally I don’t like the idea, but Mummy and Da wants me to at least give it a try,” said Mycroft, “have a decent day.” With that Mycroft turned around and promptly exited Eurus’ cell.
"You've really gotten much more annoying since you've started taking your therapy seriously. It's amusing you almost act like this will make you be able to live amongst the goldfish," snapped back Mycroft.
“Dad! I give up I can’t fix it! I tried every method I could think of but it’s welded shut and any screw I can think of moving might make it worse!” Said William holding back tears, but a single tear still managed to escape. He climbed onto his dad’s lap and shoved his face into his dad’s sweater and released even more tears.
Paul laughed, "if there was some magic solution that would be nice, but it was nice talking to you. It's getting dark, I probably should head back."
“Hello sir, security alerted us that you are actually banned from using any self check out kiosk at a Tesco,” said a staff member with a strained smile.
John grabbed Sherlock’s wrists and twisted him around throwing Sherlock against the side of the building. He managed to hold Sherlock down with one hand while the other pulled a condom from one of the many pockets of his cargo pants. He slipped it on, and started rubbing up against Sherlock.
"I opened the newspaper, which is something I do every morning, and I guess my brain decided that the pictures in the paper was showing the ruins of places I've protected and even through the label says it was somewhere else I can't bring myself to believe it," said Paul, he buried his face in his hands. "How stupid was that?"
Mike smirked and waited a couple of beats before, “okay which one of you have handled the case labeled ‘wiho010682’?”
John was amused that Sherlock was still writing but his ledger was just teetering on Rosie's back. John never got tired of seeing Sherlock with Rosie, but adding Toby really made it even better, it isn’t exactly the way he planned it but it is exactly what he wanted out of life, and to top it off it wasn’t boring with Sherlock, there was always something to do or chase. John looked at them with a big goofy smile spread across his face.
"You didn't like that I told you no on reducing the surveillance, so you went to mummy. For that I might as well come up with new ways to keep track of you."
John looked at Sherlock who shook his head "no" and they both looked at Mrs Hudson who shrugged. "No but my father is allergic but he rarely comes by," said Sherlock.
“He could’ve used ‘promise’ instead not only is it a synonym in this case but also carries more weight than the word ‘will’ as the verb for those sentences,” replied William with a happy wiggle.
“Your parents must be exhausted, having two kids who are drama queens must’ve been intense, because everyone knows, all family can only take one drama queen at a time,” added John before he broke into laughter.
“That’s really good darling, do you want my help for anything else?” Said John. He smiled as he noticed Sherlock was looking a bit flushed and starting to have another hard on. He picked up the shower shot, “maybe I can help you with this so you are ready for anything else we might try later?”
His dad let off a short laugh, “William, you’re home early. I take it the movies you wanted to see were all sold out.” Thankfully his dad was dressed perfectly normal. He stepped to the side, and Sherlock tried to slyly crawl away, the teens all watched in stunned silence as William’s parents slunk away into their bed room.
John found himself actually enjoying how debauched he was making Sherlock look. He felt like he was going to have to revisit this again. “Boy, now bow forward for me.” John aimed his stream over Sherlock’s curls. He smiled as he heard Sherlock let out a small moan. John finally stopped pissing, and took a firm grip of Sherlock’s hair, and tilted his head up, he softly kissed Sherlock, but immediately pulled back and spat. “Blargh, I can’t, nope, I am going to put watersports in the yellow column on the list.”
Sherlock was moaning as John swallowed him down. He couldn’t believe this was actually happening and with out the awkward conversations as well. This made Sherlock extremely happy, but he felt his orgasm quickly approaching, he attempted to push John off, but John only held his head down and swallowing Sherlock completely.
He sighed and thought about going up and at least just getting a bag and jacket for Rosie, but he couldn't even make it halfway up the steps before feeling that prickling on the back of his neck that screamed it was time to fight or flight or freeze. He stopped and went back down to the bottom step. He knocked on Mrs. Hudson's door.
Sherlock and John continue their adventures... this time with sensory deprivation, temperature play, edge play, and knife play
Sherlock stood at the curb and raised his hand, a taxi immediately stopped in front of them. Rosie and Mrs Hudson hopped in, John shimmied in. sherlock was about to get in.
“Okay pretty boy take a deep breath for me,” Said John as he partially loosened his grip on Sherlock’s face allowing Sherlock to breath easily through just one nostril, and shoved the open popper bottle right against Sherlock’s only route of breathing. “Deep breath now pretty boy.”
Violet and Siger both frowned, they both felt like they did fail Eurus, but at the same time they didn’t know what to do. Situations like this are incredibly rare. That's why Siger found himself talking to a lot of his friends and colleagues who worked in psychology, there had to be some path out. "Sherlock, I am sorry you felt that way growing up, but believe your father and I when we say we only thought we were doing our best at the time. And honestly Ruddy was my big brother, he was my oldest brother. And that is just how things were done for us, oldest child took charge. I guess given your brother, that probably isn't a suitable way to raise children."
John twitched, "it's a bit rough to have nightmares, like Rosie sleeps like a rock, so she never woke up when I was having a nightmare so I usually just woke up on by my myself from my nightmares. But Sherlock is a light sleeper when he sleeps. So sometimes he tries to wake me up when I have nightmares, and I mean it is one thing to wake up my own, but sometimes when Sherlock wakes me up I panic and it is almost like I am still there, and Sherlock has to deal with me when that happens and I feel like that can be something that can trigger him given that I have attacked him in the past. Like last night I had another nightmare and when I saw him, it was if he paused like his mind went blank, that is a scary thing to see in Sherlock. His heart rate was through the roof and he was having a difficult time breathing. I feel like my nightmares is triggering his anxiety. I mean is there anything I can do for the nightmares? I mean know in the past I rejected a lot of methods, but I think I am willing to give things more consideration now."
John laughed at Sherlock’s little jump, he smirked when Sherlock leaned into his face. He pulled back and spat on the quivering hole in front of him.  He roughly inserted a finger as he delivered a sharp bite to one cheek, which caused Sherlock to jump again but only lead to him pressing himself more on to John’s probing finger. His other hand wrapped around Sherlock’s cock and started stroking him off with a loose hand enough to provide a little bit of sensation but not enough to get him to cum. John laughed at how Sherlock was practically vibrating with energy and how he would squirm as John added more fingers and stretched him open. John kept Sherlock on edge by alternating between the sharp bites and swiping licks all over his back side. But no matter how painful the action John delivered Sherlock seemed to just want more. And John would be more than happy to provide all that he could possibly give.
John was relieved to finally catch a cab, because he wasn’t in the mood to take the underground after the night and morning after he had.
Molly raised her hand, “Mike, I ran that person’s test, was there any errors I need to be aware of?”
John was roughly handling Sherlock’s hips with the force of his full body weight as he slammed into Sherlock’s body. He suddenly heard a door slam, and he stilled. He held moved a hand to the back of Sherlock’s head and he gently grabbed some of his hair, he twisted Sherlock’s head to the side and he leaned down to meet his gaze, he raised a finger to his mouth as if reminding Sherlock to stay quiet. Sherlock nodded and buried his face even more into the pillow. John returned to his punishing pace because he found that he was actually pretty close to cumming and he could feel it. When his orgasm hit, John felt the need to make some rather animalistic sounds, but ended up biting Sherlock’s shoulder which caused Sherlock to buckle in surprise but ultimately he calmed, leaned into the bite, and softly moaned into the pillow, and
“Sherlock, it doesn’t have to be perfect,” said John as he flopped onto the only available chair, which was the couch. “Ugh Sherlock you need to be more careful with your smoking patches, they aren’t a thing you want stuck on you when you never smoked.”
John’s hands instantly flew to Sherlock’s bubble butt, and spread his cheeks, and swirling his tongue the edges of  Sherlock’s asshole before shoving his tongue into Sherlock’s hole. He started thrusting his tongue in and out of Sherlock’s hole.
Sherlock hissed as the cold lube hit his cock, he moaned as John took hold of his cock. “One, ah, two,” Sherlock took a deep breath he was way too close for his liking, he wanted to enjoy this. “THREE!” Gasped Sherlock as he tenses up because John delivered a stroke where John tugged at his foreskin, adding a bit  more sensation to  the sensitive tip. He wrapped his arms around John, and pulled him closer.
“Sherlock you surprised me by bringing out your old bar back uniform from when you went undercover to ensure that my ex went down for his crimes. Which was funny because I just saw Mickey, you know him that one terrible man who wouldn’t stop hitting on you and the other boys. He was always flashing his money around too, but I am sure he was full of shit,” Said Mrs. Hudson. She turned to John and Sherlock at their chairs, “oh... oh dear were you two still going at it. I’ll just show my way out.” She placed the tray of cake on the table near them and made a quick dash for the exit. “You boys have fun,” she yelled as she descended the stairs. “Just remember your parents are going to be dropping Rosie off at 9pm, so I am sure you can get another round in before they come over, but just have fun, I’ll leave you alone.”
Mycroft wrinkled his nose at her language usage, she didn't exactly sound smart or even polite. "Her name is Eurus Holmes."
