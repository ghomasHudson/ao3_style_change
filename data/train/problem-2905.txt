It isn't until the suns rays stain the horizon gold that Dean stands again. He dusts himself off and wipes at the dried tear tracks on his face. He aches, but he also feels some relief. He hadn't said it all but… he'd said enough. The rest he can keep for himself, at least for now. He slips back into the motel room where, predictably, Sam is still asleep. He steps out of his shoes and slides beneath the scratchy motel sheets. Finally,
Without opening his eyes, Cas whines and makes grabby hands at Dean. Dean catches one of Cas's hands in his own. "I'll make coffee," he promises, then presses a kiss into Cas's knuckles.
Dean chuckles. "Alright, sweetheart," he says. He rolls onto his back, carefully dislodging Cas, then gets up.
Now, he's mostly confused. The Empty is different from what Cas remembers. There's a high pitched whine that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. In the back of Cas's head, he feels presences other than his own, tugging his consciousness in several directions. With nothing else to do, he picks one at random and begins to walk.
Dean is exhausted, but even with his eyes shut tight against the soft moonlight that filtered through the motel room's thin curtains he can't sleep. He misses the odd sounds the bunker made at night. He misses his memory foam mattress. He misses his damn nightgown and he misses- well. Best not to go there while he's trying to sleep.
Cas pats him on the thigh. "He'll kill
Dean shoots a look at Cas.
"Why?" Cas demands. "You've done it before."
And then he sees it. He swears.
Dean and Cas pass out hugs like party favors, making sure to spend a moment with everyone in the room. Cas lingers for a few minutes with Jack, and while he does Dean steps into the kitchen to make them both a plate of food.
Just then, Sam and Eileen walk into the kitchen, followed quickly by Garth and Bess. Before long most of the bunker has arrived, and Dean gets back to cooking the feast. Behind him, someone else fires up the toaster, and soon he's handing off plate after plate of bacon, eggs and toast.
"Maybe I can help you," he says, though he has no idea how.
He doesn't know what to say.
There's a long pause. Finally, she says, "I am." Dean turns to see her smiling into her coffee
Dean pulls back a little, just far enough to look Cas in the eye. "Cas," he says, "I gotta tell you something."
"But if I do," Cas says, "you have to help me too."
Dean stares at him, open mouthed. "You're..." he starts, but doesn't know how to finish.
"Cas," he says softly. "I don't know if you can hear me. Hell, you probably can't. I know this one was probably it. The big goodbye." Tears begin to form in Dean's eyes, and he does nothing to stop them from falling. "I wanted to say thank you," he whispers. "What you did… we saved the world because of it. Because of you. There're seven billion people out there who owe you their lives. Some of us owe it a few times over." Dean chuckles a little at that, a wet, painful sound. "I need you to know that you changed me too. Of course you did, how could you not? Whatever it is you saw in me… it's there because of you. I never thought… well, I guess we're both stupid. You said the one thing you wanted you couldn't have. Cas," Dean says, his voice breaking, "I wanted it, too." His prayer devolves into choking sobs, the kind that tear themselves from you and won't let you draw breath to replace them.
Cas breaks out into a wide grin. "Yes, Dean Winchester. Yes, I am."
She's waiting on the sidewalk as they pull up to the curb, and Sam's out of the car before they even stop. He runs straight to Eileen, wraps his arms around her and swings her in a circle. She lets out a high pitched squeal and, when Sam puts her down, drags him into a long kiss.
. The closer Cas gets, the more it hurts to listen to. The unending screech rattles his teeth and threatens to tear his eardrums. He keeps walking.
"I have nothing to say to you," Cas rumbles.
"Grab the wine and I'll get our bags out of the trunk," Dean says.
"Send me home."
Cas pushes past him. "I have no interest in your games," he says. To his surprise, Lucifer says nothing in response.
"It's about time!" Sam calls when he spot's them. He stands and strides over to them.
"Of course not Cas, god, of course not. I love you," Dean says. "All of you, in any form, whatever the consequences." Dean pauses for a moment, out of breath. "Are you okay, though?" he asks softly.
The party goes late into the night, and when it's over everyone crashes at the bunker. These days, it functions as a stopover for hunters from all around the country. Sam and Eileen are slowly expanding their reach, giving hunters everywhere access to the enormous cache of knowledge contained within the bunker's walls. It feels so full of life, like it was always meant to be. They all sleep easy.
Dean looks away. He's happy for them, he is, but it's hard to watch, knowing that he'll never – well. All that matters is that they have each other. Dean is grateful for that.
'Well, whatever the hell you did it woke us all up," she says from behind him. Cas spins around to face her.
, he thinks. Cas's grin widens, and for a moment it's almost like he can hear Dean's thoughts again. But no, Cas just knows him that well.
The barn is more rundown than the last time he saw it, but Dean knows it's the same one. He can feel it in his bones. He wants to let go, to fall to his knees and sob, but something in him pushes him forward. He walks until he reaches its ramshackle doors. He places his hand lightly on one.
"Hello, Dean," Cas replies warmly. He presses his face into the proffered hand.
After a few minutes, Cas joins him in the kitchen and presses a short kiss against the shell of his ear.
Cas's smile expands into a broad grin. "I would like nothing more than to 'settle down' with you, Dean Winchester."
"Then I can't help you." Cas turns and begins to walk away. The determination he felt before begins to drain quickly away.
"Dean," Cas chokes out. The prayer bounces around his head like a trapped echo.
"Don't you think we've kept them waiting long enough already?"
"Cassie!" Lucifer calls out gleefully. "What a lovely family reunion."
"We all know it wasn't traffic that kept you in California an extra day," Sam teases.
"I- uh, yeah. We are," Dean replies.
Cas turns. "I can't help you from here," he says.
"I made a deal," Cas replies simply.
"Ah," Ruby says. "Then I guess you still owe me." She winks, and then she too is gone. The whine continues. Although, now that he thinks about it, perhaps
"Awesome," Dean sighs and kisses Cas again.
"Jack did this to you, right?" Cas verifies. The Empty screeches in anger. It's all the confirmation Cas needs. "Then I'll get him to undo it. It's the only way to put them back to sleep. For you to go back to sleep."
Cas groans and presses his face into Dean's shoulder. "Too early," he mumbles.
He'd known they were somewhere in Illinois, but he hadn't realized they were here.
Before, just after Chuck had wiped the Earth clean of everyone but them, Dean had had to push it all down. Sam was spiraling, and Dean couldn't afford to sink into the stupor he usually found himself in after losing Cas.
In it's center lays a dark haired man, naked and shivering. Cas.
"It was twelve bucks and they had a pie eating competition!"
And so, they do.
For a while he just stares, tracing out the constellations he knows and making new ones in place of the ones he doesn't. Above the big dipper is a group of stars he decides to call Jack. The brightest of them make a sort of circle. Harmony, Dean thinks. Beyond that are several stars in the shape of a child's drawing of of a house. He calls that one Sam. And above it… well, Dean knows that one. Cassiopeia. He doesn't know where it got it's name, but he knows what it means to him.
This is stupid, he knows. There's nothing for him beyond those doors except heartbreak and longing. Still though, there's something fitting about saying goodbye where it all began. He takes in a deep breath and pushes the door open. Its hinges squeal, but he pays them no mind because the barn isn't empty.
When he turns around, the Archangel is gone.
"You can have it, Cas, of course you can have it. I'm yours."
"Yeah?"
Dean tilts his head back against the wall, and for the first time since purgatory, he prays.
is a more accurate description.
Next, Cas finds Ruby. Or rather, she finds him.
Dean shrugs. "Three or four hours?" he guesses.
"Your precious little humans are going to lose," he sing-songs. "I've made sure of it."
"If you get back… what will you do?"
"Home," Cas repeats, smiling.
She smiles at that. "I'm happy for you," she says.
To his surprise, Dean isn't alone when he walks into the kitchen. Claire sits at the table, eyes closed and a steaming mug held in both hands.
"You know, if you ever wanted to get out of the life-"
"Michael," Cas says, surprised. His voice sounds strange to his ears, echoless and muted by the void around them.
He's home.
The Empty stares at him for a moment in silence. It nods. "It's a deal," it says. It lunges at him, and this time Cas is too slow to avoid it. It wraps itself around him and tears him open. It's like dying all over again, but a thousand times more painful. It's as if his very essence is being torn from him. As if – oh. That's exactly what it is. It's unmaking him. The Empty is for angels and demons and other celestial beings, and if he isn't one… before he has time to finish the thought, he's gone.
"I'm gonna make breakfast," he says softly. "Want to help?"
"Oh," Lucifer says, "but you'll want to hear what I have to say." He grins, but none of the mirth reaches his eyes.
"Yeah," Dean says, and they head in.
"Make it STOP," the Empty pleads. "It's so loud."
Everything hurts. Cas is cold, and disoriented and lost and the only emotion he can process is relief. Because these aren't the sort of things that an angel feels. They're what humans feel. And humans don't belong in the Empty. He hears a noise behind him, hears a sharp intake of breath, and he knows.
Dean brushes a lock of hair away from Cas's face. It's gotten longer recently and it's nice. He places a soft kiss on Cas's brow.
"But?"
"Please," it begs, driven far past the point of reason.
Claire hums in acknowledgement, takes a sip of her coffee, then opens her eyes. "You two look happy," she says, apropos of nothing.
"That close?" Sam asks.
"There's something you should know," Cas continues. "There was a cost to leaving the Empty," he says.
"We could," Dean says.
"Yeah, yeah," Dean says, accepting the embrace and clapping Sam on the back. "You should've seen the traffic."
"Nah, me and Kaia have everything we need. I wouldn't say no to an invitation to visit, though."
The little sleep Dean gets leaves him feeling surprisingly refreshed, and they make good time the rest of the way to Eileen. Ten minutes out, and Sam is all smiles, sending her update texts for every street they pass. His happiness is contagious, and Dean finds himself smiling too. He might not have gotten everything he wanted, but dammit Sam deserves this. So does Eileen. They've both been through so much. They're good for each other.
He begins to wander on foot, walking along a dirt road that runs between two corn fields. It almost certainly leads nowhere, but he feels an irrational need to follow it, as if there's something important at the end.
"Promise?" Cas says.
The Empty curls in on itself to wait. It screams.
It sounds so desperate that Cas almost feels sorry for it.
Instead, he'd pasted on as much of a smile as he could manage and teased Sam about seeing Eileen again so he wouldn't have to think about who they wouldn't be seeing.
Finally, once nearly everyone has food, Cas walks in looking just as rumpled as he always does in the morning. Dean meets him with a mug of coffee and a sweet kiss. "Morning, sunshine," he murmurs against his lips.
Dean wakes up smiling. It's not like this everyday, but it's happening more all the time. Something about sleeping in Cas's arms, waking up in them, it keeps the nightmares at bay. Most of them, anyway.
Cas shakes his head softly. "I heard your prayer," Cas says. "I know."
Dean grins. "You'll be first on our list."
Cold fear washes over Dean. "What?" he asks softly.
Dean shakes Sam awake around four in the morning, just as he pulls into a roadside motel. It's the sort they've slept in a thousand times before, stained carpet and questionable mass produced art and all. It feels almost like a homecoming.
"Sam's gonna kill us," Dean groans.
Cas continues walking with renewed purpose, although just as directionless as before. He wanders for what felt like hours or perhaps mere minutes. There's no concept of time in the Empty; only what was and what is. Eventually, he notices that the shriek is getting louder. It suddenly seems to be coming from a specific direction. Cas turns toward it and begins to run.
"Dad sprung me," Lucifer replies, "and I-"
And Dean's smiling too, so hard it hurts. "C'mon," he says, "You must be freezing." He pulls off his jacket and wraps it around Cas's shoulders. "Let's go home," he says.
"M'glad," Claire says. "You both deserve it."
"It's good to see everyone," Cas murmurs, wrapping his arms around Dean's waist.
As he draws close, it seems to sense his presence. "You!" it shrieks, turning it's face towards him. It still wears Meg's face, but it bares an expression he's never seen on her before. "You did this!" It lunges at him, but even as he flinches back it falls short, back on it's hands and knees.
Dean falls to his knees as Cas sits up and turns to face him. "Cas," he breathes. All of his energy seems to leave him at once. He reaches out with a shaking hand and stops just shy of touching Cas's cheek.
Waking at all is a surprise. Cas had seen the Empty reaching out to him, had felt its icy tendrils envelop him. And he'd felt peace. Dean was safe, and he'd finally said what he'd wanted to all these years. Finally let himself feel love in its entirety. It had been glorious.
"It's over," she says softly.
Cas surges forward, and for the first time he
After several more minutes of unsuccessful slumber, Dean sighs and swings himself out of bed. He toes on his boots as quietly as he can manage and slips out into the night. He walks around behind the motel and sits on concrete slab, back against the wall and arms resting on his knees. The night is cold and clear, the stars as bright as he's ever seen them.
"Late," Dean replies. "C'mon, I need a couple hours of shut eye before we keep going."
"Hey kid," Dean says, clearing his throat.
"It’s over," Sam agrees.
"Here in the bunker?" Cas asks, tilting his head in that oh so familiar way.
That's what they do now. Two years down the line, and they don't hunt unless some other hunter desperately needs their help. Instead, for the first time in Dean's life, they've been travelling just for the hell of it. Most recently they'd been in wine country, because Cas was curious and Dean had forgotten how to say no a long time ago. They have at least 16 different bottles in the trunk, all of which they're planning on sharing, if they ever make it to Lebanon.
They fall into comfortable silence for several minutes, as Dean pulls out enough ingredients to feed an army. Hunters are a hungry bunch, after all.
The kid had been through enough, and Dean wasn't going to make him explain why restoring the entire world was in his power but bringing Cas back wasn't.
Sam rubs his eyes and stretches. "How far out are we?" He asks as he climbs out of the car.
Dean grins. "Anything you say, sweetheart."
"ANYTHING," it screeches.
Dean drops his and Cas's bags in preparation for the bear hug he knows he's going to get. Ever since he and Cas started heading out on their own, Sam acts like he hasn’t seen them in years.
The Empty stares up at him. Its lips curl into a snarl. "I. Can't," it says.
His next encounter is less welcome than the first two were.
Perhaps the direction he'd chosen hadn't been quite as random as he'd thought.
"Dammit," Dean says, glancing at the traffic map Cas has pulled up on his phone. They're on I-80 just outside of Cheyenne, stuck in stop-and-go traffic that doesn't seem like it'll be letting up any time soon. They're coming from San Francisco, or thereabouts, and on their third day of driving.
And yeah, Dean thinks, he could get used to this.
"We made a deal," it replies. "Deals cannot be broken."
, he hears in his mind. He knows that voice. Cas falls to his knees.
Cas feels a sharp, painful tug in his grace.
They'd won, but the cost to play had been too damn high. Dean hadn't asked Jack to bring Cas back because he didn't have to. He'd seen the flash of sadness in his eyes after bringing everyone else back; seen the near-imperceptible shake of his head when Dean took an aborted step after him as he backed away. Jack couldn’t do it.
"What happened?" Cas asks.
, he sleeps.
It's… over. They won. And Dean is happy, he really is. It was a near perfect ending. The sun is shining and the Earth's still turning, it's inhabitants entirely unaware of the days they'd lost. He wonders if some scientist won't figure it out, notice that the stars have moved too far for a single day. A puzzle for the decade. And Sam, Sam's practically vibrating with excitement as they draw closer to Eileen with every mile of asphalt beneath their tires.
"My grace," Cas answers. "I'm human."
"Claire?" Dean says as he cracks eggs into a bowl.
"I guess I should thank you," Ruby continues. "I mean, I could do without the eternal shriek, but it's better than everything that was going on up here." She taps her forehead meaningfully.
"Time is it?" Sam asks, yawning.
"Dean," Cas says, and there something desperate in his voice.
"How?" Dean asks, not loosening his grip at all.
"C'mon." Dean gestures towards the front of the motel. "A little sleep and we'll be there by lunchtime."
Cas shakes his head with a smile. "There's an exit coming up in half a mile, let's see if we can't find a better way home."
Dean makes some bullshit excuse about finding parking and drives off, leaving Sam and Eileen to catch up. It serves the dual purpose of giving them some alone time and him some space. He drives without thinking, makes random turns onto streets he doesn't know until he finds himself at the edge of town. He parks the car and gets out.
Bobby suggests they head their separate ways, to have some space before trying to figure out what to do next. Dean doesn’t want to be alone, but he’d never admit that, and he doesn't have a better suggestion. Bobby gives Dean a firm hug, gets in his truck, and drives off. Dean sighs and gets into the driver’s seat of the Impala. He’s surprised when Cas follows suit, sliding into the passenger’s seat. But it feels natural so he doesn’t complain. He starts the car and they drive off. Dean has no idea where he is going, and Cas knew this as well. They both choose to not mention it. After a few hours, Dean clears his throat.
“Dean, you need to chill out. There is nothing happening. We’ve spent a whole year apart. That’s it. It’s going to take a while for us to get back in the rhythm of things” he said, shrugging and then turning back to his computer.
He arrived in the junkyard with Sam and Bobby sitting on the porch. Sam had his canvas bags at his feet and a folder certainly containing all the news clippings, research, and notes from his wall collage at the abandoned house. Dean turned off the engine and got out of the car as Sam started placing his things in the backseat.
“Right, right. And to figure out how to save Adam” he said, turning his head to look at his brother. Sam sighed again.
“Seriously Sam?? Lisa and Ben, Sam. Innocent people Sam” and Sam sighed again. Dean knew this was uncharacteristic of Sam. Sam was always the one that advocated to save innocent people. But they would need to unpack later. Right now, they need to get to Lisa and Ben. Sam got into the driver’s seat of his stolen truck and Dean got into the passenger’s seat. And they headed off towards Lisa’s house.
“Really? Really Dean? This whole time you never wanted out? You never wanted to be safe and happy and normal. With a nice girl on your arm? With a family?” And at that, Dean had to pause. Had he? Did he? What did he want? He had enjoyed the past year with Lisa and Ben…but was it what he wanted? Because as good as it was, Dean has missed Sam and Adam and…-and Cas. He had missed Castiel so much. His family. Lisa and Ben were nice, but Sam and Adam, and Cas were his family. Family.
“It was nice Dean. Don’t beat yourself up too much. Things happen. Granted, they aren’t typically as…supernatural as this but this type of shit happens all the time. Sometimes things just don’t work out. It’s no one’s fault” Dean nodded, but still couldn’t shake the feeling that it was all his fault. Nevertheless, later that morning, Sam, Dean, Ben, and Lisa all piled into Sam’s truck and they drove Ben and Lisa home. Sam just dropped them off, then heading back to Bobby’s house.
They walked into the house, Dean making a b-line to the garage where he had been attacked. But just as he was about to enter the garage, he heard a scream from next door. Syd. Dean rushes towards the house, Sam and Bobby following close behind. Dean breaks the lock with his foot and bursts through the front door, and there were Syd and his wife on the floor, dead. Their eyes were a blank, milky white, and it was unsure to Dean if they had even had a chance to hallucinate before the Djinn poison killed them.
“Oh, well things are fucked up right now Cas. So you chose a perfect time to check-in. Sam’s back, and he’s weird. We’re trying to figure out what’s up, that’s why we're in Utah” Dean explained, picking up his beer bottle again.
“I don’t know Sam. I don’t know” he said, looking down at his boots. That phrase said all Sam needed to know. He nodded and sighed again.
And so start the re-writes. At this point, some things may still feel a bit close to the actual show, but there are some key differences. Again, this is what I would have done differently. Any questions, comments, or concerns? Please feel free to let me know.
“I know you guys are gonna be very busy trying to figure out what brought him back and trying to save Adam. But here and there maybe check in with him. He never admits it, but he needs you, Dean. Just like you never admit that you need him.”
“Okay. So, get this, I’ve been doing some research-”
“Listen, Dean. You have been great, a great influence on Ben. I mean he absolutely adores you. And you know you’ve been a great partner. But I need to protect Ben. I need to think of us first, and with Sam back…” she trailed off, not quite sure how to approach the next part.
“So, what’s the deal with Utah,” Dean asked. He knew the deal. He knew exactly what they were doing and what they were looking for. He just needed Sam to fill the silence. Sam let out another sigh, clearly annoyed at his brother’s apparent inattentiveness. Dean had gotten used to it.
“So, you’re leaving?” Ben asked, looking up at him with a child’s eyes. Those eyes were so innocent and yet seeing. Those eyes that understood so much more than adults could ever realize.
“What are you going to do now?” he asks, both out of curiosity fueled concern and to fill the space.
“That’s an understatement” Dean quips back.
“Cas”
Lisa. She’s comfort. She’s stability. She’s a promise that he made, even though right now he’d rather work to find a way to bring his brothers back. Or die. But instead, he knocks on her door. He’s not even really sure if he loves her. He just knows he needs someone, somewhere. When she answers the door, relief is etched into her face.
As always, any questions, comments, concerns, please let me know in the comments :]
However, he wakes up. His head feels like it’s full of cotton. His body is sore. He slowly lifts himself into a seated position, groaning softly. And sitting in front of him, clear as day, is Sam.
“Okay, what’s wrong with you?” Dean asked, sitting up and frowning at Sam.
A year passes, and Dean has gotten comfortable with his new life. Wake up, go to work as a contractor in his beat-up truck, attend barbecues, spend time with Ben, check the house for suspicious activity, go to bed, rinse and repeat. He hates that he likes the routine, not having to worry about dying all the time. And the more comfortable he feels, the more his guilt grows as well. Sam and Adam are still in the Cage. They’re suffering and he’s here living a white picket fence life. So when he comes home one day to find sulfur on the ground leading to the garage, he hates that he’s almost grateful. He arms himself with the knife and flashlight that he keeps in this truck. The rest of his supplies are in the Impala, and if the demon is in the garage then there’s no way he can properly suit up. He’s just going to have to make do. But when he gets there, there’s nothing. He practically turns the garage upside-down trying to figure out where a demon could possibly be hiding. Nowhere. He sighs in relief, hoping that he’s just seeing things. Then all of a sudden, there are two yellow eyes looking at him. Azazel. Dean doesn’t even have a chance to rationalize the fact that Azazel is dead before the demon grabs him by the neck and lifts him off the ground. There’s nothing he can do, and as he loses consciousness he realizes that he was going to die at the hands of a beast this whole time.
“That’s easy for you to say, he brought you back. But what about Sam? What about Adam? What about me? Huh? Where’s my Grand Prize? Where’s my thank you for saving the world? All I got were my brothers in a hole!”
“Sam, seriously? Something is definitely wrong with you. I mean, you’re aloof and apathetic. You always seem to be annoyed by everything. And you’re quiet, you don’t tell me anything anymore. This isn’t you Sam, this isn’t us. So tell me what the fuck is going on” Dean said, the frustration and anger apparent in his voice. Sam’s face, however, was blank.
“Dean, wait. We kind of have something more important to focus on right now” He called out in an attempt to get Dean back into the abandoned house that Sam had made a makeshift base.
“Yeah Dean, I didn’t tell you. I was trying to protect you. You got out Dean, you were safe. Why would I tell you? And guarantee an early death for you? No Dean. No” Bobby said, placing a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean looked at Sam in the kitchen, getting a beer out of Bobby’s fridge. And he broke inside. Because everything that Sam had said was just an imitation of what Sam knew what Bobby would have said.
“Djinn poison? There are Djinn in this town? Fuck, Lisa, and Ben. I have to go back” Dean said, heading off and grabbing his jacket. Sam followed him, a surprised look on his face.
Dean doesn’t even have time to consider the question before Castiel has disappeared from his car. He sighs and looks up at the sky.
Dean couldn’t help but feel like that was a bit dramatic, but it proved exactly what he wanted to know. That was his brother. His Sammy.
Dean knew that he needed to break it off with Lisa. He wasn’t looking forward to it, but at the same time, he knew it was going to be a relief. Dean didn’t want to think about that too much.
“You’re angry” Cas notes.
“Wait, who brought you back?” he asked, pulling back and looking Sam in the face, but Sam only shrugged. “And you don’t know why?” Dean followed up, being met with another shrug.
“Yeah, ready” Dean said, unlocking the doors of the impala and getting into the driver’s seat. Soon they were off on the highway, Bobby, Lisa, and Ben left far behind them.
Dean looks around, down at his own body, and then back up to Cas. How was this possible? Only seconds ago, he had seen Castiel be blown up by Lucifer. Dean had convinced himself that he had lost Cas, and the amount of relief that he felt when he saw Cas frowning down at him was almost too much to handle. He slowly stands up, his eyes not daring to leave Cas’, as if Dean was worried that if he didn’t keep an eye on him, Cas would disappear again.
Cas, however, didn’t pick up on that tone and let out a small scoff. “I like that. Yeah, I suppose I am.”
Lisa and Ben packed their bags and they pilled into Sam’s truck. It was an awkward introduction, but they managed and speed off towards Bobby’s safe house. Sam got out first and brought Bobby up to speed. They moved Ben and Lisa into the guest bedroom, and Dean took the moment to catch up with Bobby. They hadn’t seen each other since that fateful night when his brothers were locked in the cage. It became apparent quite quickly, that Bobby and Sam had been acquainted while Dean had been away. And that hurt more.
“Hey, relax. It’s me, I’ll prove it” Sam said, raising his hands in surrender. He reached over and took a silver knife from an old table, rolled up his sleeve, and cut a thin line into his forearm. He then took a salt packet, ripped it open, poured it into a milk gallon of holy water, and took a large drink.
“For protection,” he said, and somehow, he knew Ben knew what he meant. And with that, he picked up his bag with clothes and got into the impala. He had made sure to leave some amulets, crosses, a salt line here and there in the house. Just in case. He inserted the keys into the ignition and his car purred to life. His car. As he drove off he could see Ben and Lisa watching him from their front yard, and his mind momentarily wandered to what Cas has said to him last year. Peace or freedom huh, guess he had made his choice.
“A year’s worth of research” Dean interrupted Sam in the middle of his sentence, causing Sam to shoot him an annoyed look from the passenger’s seat.
“I can read the label through the sharpie you colored over it,” Ed shot back.
He lowered his mouth to Cas’s until his lips barely brushed those of the other man. Then he tilted his head back, dragging them up. Castiel arched under him, chasing them. He relaxed as Dean tilted his head forward again, lips dragging down this time. Castiel let out a small whimpering mewl that begged to be kissed. So Dean did, lowering down and capturing his lips in an open caress, slipping his tongue between them and sliding it against Cas’s own. Castiel fought against the tongue in his mouth, each of them seeking to gain purchase over the confined real estate. Dean pinned him to the roof of his mouth and he whimpered again, body straining up against the weight Dean had half-lowered on top of him.
“But it’s illegal!” Castiel blurted, rolling onto his side to face him.
“Drink first,” Dean said.
Castiel’s eyes flickered to Dean, but the man was doing a stellar job of not giving anything away on his face.
tacos, but I guarantee any ‘surprise’ will be a good one. Dean is a very good cook.”
“Does your father know about Zachariah’s…preferences?” he asked.
Tessa left shortly and returned with a wheel chair, and then left Dean to wheel Cas out to the car waiting for them. He helped Cas get settled and then climbed in after him while the driver stowed the chair in the trunk, helping him to strap on the seatbelt since he was having trouble doing it one handed. Castiel grunted in pain and settled back against the headrest, his eyes fluttering closed. Even just the short trip from the hospital room to the car had taken a lot out of him, and he dozed lightly on the drive back to Dean’s apartment.
“That depends,” Castiel replied coyly. He arched his neck back to allow Dean easier access. “Which role were you envisioning for yourself?”
That throws him. Jacob lips wag but no words come out. He clears his throat and forces out, a little weakly, “You’re telling me…
“We lied to you, yes,” Castiel replied for him.
Dean was too busy melting from the taste to care.
!!” Dean yelled, “Ugh, I need mind bleach now thanks to that image. Fuckin’
“And you’re just thinking of all this now?” Dean cut in, a touch heavy on the sarcasm.
Michael, who sat across from him leaned in with a “What?” and then turned around to where Brian was staring.
And then he has a small heart attack when he realizes he practically
calling you about a delicate matter,” Charlie said. She paused for dramatic effect, and Dean could just picture the smirk on her face as she got ready to con the pants off this old lady. “You see, one of our passengers adopted a shelter cat over the holidays and he’s worried about putting her below with the other pets when she is—and these are
He smiles, and blue eyes look into him, lit from behind and practically glowing. There’s a smile on Castiel’s face of a caliber that Dean hasn’t seen before, and he’s
” He was incubus meat. They both were. “Run!” he yelled, turning and grabbing Brian by the shirt as the creature rushed them.
“A guest,” Charlie deadpanned. She whistled. “You must be loaded.”
“Cas, I know it’s just a phone,” Dean said. When Cas looked up at him, he continued. “Will you let me get you a nicer one?”
Castiel looked back to his menu and blinked rapidly. His face puckered like he’d just bit into a lemon.
“You coming?” Dean called. He couldn’t help feeling pleased with himself.
“Well, no, I suppose not,” the doctor said, and then, as though to get back at him for the inappropriate comment, he lifted the saw Jason-style and turned it on.
Castiel made a disgruntled sound. His eyes flickered up to Dean’s a moment later. “Sorry,” he said again.
“I’ll make sure to screen all my tricks
“Yeah, well, now you know,” Dean said, looking away. Talk of his roots always made him uneasy for some reason.
. Couldn’t it have waited? It wasn’t like things were busy at the moment. Plus, Dean was a guest. It was rude.
Jo laughed scornfully.
“This is…” Jack started, gesturing to everything, “I don’t know what to say,” he finished. He looked up and then said, “Thank you.”
He sinks down into the chair and drops his head to the table with a loud
doing that for a change rather than coasting by on his father’s coattails.
“I don’t catch your meaning.”
“Yeah, that sounds about right.” She slid the finished drink over to Jo. “Here you go, a Charlie original. I call it the ‘Salty Mule’.”
“Dean—” Sam started again, but his brother held up a hand.
Castiel frowned and quirked his head.
“Oh. That’s tasty,” he said.
“Nothing happened,” Dean said after a long minute, “It was just another dream.” He swung his legs over the side of the bed. “I need a shower.”

Translation—
Dean carefully scooped Castiel’s face into his hands and pressed a light, chaste kiss against his lips. He pulled back just a second later.

idea of heaven.
Well, okay. That was
Dean heard it and felt his lips twist into a wry smile.
Dean turned to the couple. “Go home, celebrate,” he said, “You’ll find out why later.”
The relief that hit him brought a wave of dizziness along with it. Brian Kinney closed his eyes against the pain in his leg and slumped forward as unconsciousness claimed him.
“I thought that too. I figured that whoever or whatever brought me back might have brought Adam back. But no, no sign of Adam anywhere. And I looked” Dean sighed, running his hand over his face.
“It’s never too late” she replies, and her sincerity makes his heart break. He’s guilty, this isn’t going to last. But when she pulls him into that hug he thinks maybe somehow he can trick himself into normalcy. Somehow he can defy his instincts and go against what destiny has set out for him. As he, Ben, and Lisa sit down for dinner, he tries not to think about it too hard. But he knows the truth. And as Sam watches Dean from outside Lisa’s house, he knows the truth as well.
“Yeah, let’s get this son of a bitch” Dean said, in his typical tone. Bobby looked at him with a furrowed brow however, something was definitely up with him.
“So what, you’re the new sheriff in town?” Dean jokes, but his tone revealed something more. Some other feeling, perhaps closer to anger.
He knew both Dean and Sam were right. They needed to figure out what was going on. If Sam was back, that meant Adam could be brought back. They needed to figure out how to do that.
“Sam, can you at least look at me man? I mean, come on. LOOK AT ME” Dean screamed, his chest heaving with uneven breaths. Sam sighed, supposing that they were going to do this now. He didn’t want to. But Dean wasn’t going to let this go. At least not now. So, Sam turned around.
“Other hunters? How long have you been back?” Dean asked, and Sam didn’t even bother turning around when he answered.
(See the end of the chapter for
After about an hour more of driving, the impala rolled past the “WELCOME TO UTAH” sign, and 20 minutes after the sign was passed Dean and Sam pulled into the parking lot of a small motel. Dean turned off the impala, rubbing his temples with his palms. He was exhausted, not in the way that hunting made him exhausted. Sam patted his brother’s shoulder, but it was clearly more of a performance and less as a way to actually express concern.
“Right. Guess I am out of practice. A year is a long time” he shot back, and Sam looked away.
Dean, now having to abandon Lisa and Ben, embarks on his journey with Sam to find out what brought back Sam, why and figure out how to bring back Adam.
“He helped. Maybe even more than we realize” Cas suggests, and Dean can’t help but scoff at the notion.
“Sammy?” he asked, slowly getting to his feet. Sam gestured to himself as if the answer was obvious.
Dean came to in the back of Sam’s truck, a vile taste in his mouth and a pounding in his head. He grunted and pulled himself up into a seated position with a sigh. Looking around, he saw Sam and Bobby talking outside, so he opened the truck door and shakily got to his feet. Both men looked at him, and Bobby stepped forward and placed a steadying hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“So no one can figure anything out, huh. What about Adam, is Adam back?” Dean asked, and Sam shook his head.
Dean and Sam arrive in Utah, but tensions increase between the brothers as they try to figure out what is going on.
“I saw yellow eyes before I passed out in the garage. He’s dead, but could it have been him? Or whatever brought him back brought him back?” Dean suggested.
“Yeah, Sam thinks that something holy might be behind him coming back. I just want him to be okay, and to get Adam back” Dean sighed, running his hand through his hair.
Dean was annoyed. That was the 15th time Sam had sighed in half an hour.
“Yes, after my year spent researching, I pretty much ruled out any of our ‘normal’ culprits. It’s not gonna be demons, they are all under Crowley’s rule now that Lucifer is out of the picture. So, while I found no sign that Lucifer is back, it doesn’t make sense that Crowley would bring me back and risk Lucifer maybe coming back with me” he said, and Dean nodded along.
“Ok, great. So which one’s first?” Dean asked, and Sam opened his folder again.
“But, in the same ballpark, I think it might be something holy. Maybe Cas. Maybe someone or something else. So, I’ve narrowed it down to 8 cities where there have been reported ‘miracles’ at holy sites. It’s not much, but it’s the only lead I’ve got so far.”
“Listen, Dean, something is wrong with Sam,” Bobby said, and Dean let out a little cough at that.
Before Dean could turn around, he felt a hand on his wrist and then excruciating pain. He didn’t notice the Djinn behind him, that had just injected him with poison. He didn’t notice that Sam had seen the Djinn about to attack him. He didn’t notice that Sam hadn’t done anything, just watch and let the Djinn attack him. He didn’t notice Bobby notice Sam let his brother get poisoned. He didn’t notice any of this, he just grunted and then lost consciousness.
All Dean could do was just sit and stare at the tall man in front of him. It couldn’t be. But it was.
“Hey Dean, I’ve got something for you real quick. Sam, we’re gonna be inside if you need us” Bobby called out to Sam, who had opened his folder and was scribbling in it with a ballpoint pen. He didn’t say anything just shot them a thumbs up.
Lost in thought he almost doesn't notice Castiel silently appear behind him, seemingly unfazed by being literally blow up just moments ago. He was graceful, a calming presence. And if Dean had to choose just one word to describe him, it would be holy.
Then Dean was turning his head and dropping a good morning kiss on his lips. Castiel made a soft
looking for is a good deal.” He looked at her pointedly.
“Oh really?” Dean asked. He wiggled his eyebrows again. “That’s it, the donut is
“Yeah, I can see that,” Dean said. “I guess I had you pegged for the wine and dine type, that’s all.”
“Hey, we were just there last week closing a deal,” Dean lied. He picked up one of Zachariah’s many bags (seriously, how did one fat fuck need
The air around him was suddenly still as Dean held his breath, waiting for a reply. When it didn’t come, Dean let it out in a sigh. Cas wasn’t coming.
“It would not be an imposition at all,” Castiel assured the elder Winchester. He drew his shoulders back, straightening to his full height and continued with more confidence. “Dean has been teaching me how to play poker, but it is difficult to learn with only two people.”
“I like the sweet and spicy combination,” he said, “And the way it makes my whole mouth tingle.”
Dean was just licking down Castiel’s chest when he remembered the pie. He ginned into Castiel’s skin and left a kiss where his mouth was, envisioning how it would taste with the sharp, buttery sweetness of strawberries and cream. He made a noise low in his throat that sounded like
“It was your friendship with Jo which showed me the real you. Up until that point I had only your word and the tabloid articles to go off, but you seemed so unhappy with the part of you who played into that role that I…decided to give you another chance.”
“Yeah it was,” Dean replied caddishly. He flashed Cas a lewd smile over his shoulder. “It was really,
“I know, I’m pissed at him too,” he said consolingly, “Pretty sure everyone is.” He sighed again. “I’m sorry, Cas. I don’t know how to make this right.” A pause. “Tell me how to make this right,” Dean murmured softly.  He pressed a kiss into the dark mass of Castiel’s hair.
, although he wasn’t really the type. He helped Dean into the back seat and then scooted in beside him, holding Dean close to him as if he were worried Dean might disappear.
“Hey, hey! I’m just kidding!” Dean said, holding up his hands and then doubling over in laughter. “God, Cas, lighten up!”
“I’m fine,” Castiel replies. He tucks his chin in against his hand where it’s curled up into his chest. Dean’s arm is around him, and he’s warm. He doesn’t want to move.
“Because this is where we always come,” Cas answered simply.
“There’s still one more Boston crème,” Dean said, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.
Longer this time, and a lot more passionate. Dean enveloped Castiel’s entire mouth in his, pressing in and moving slow. He grinned into Castiel’s mouth at the satisfied groan that escaped the man in his arms. His lover. His best friend.
“Nope, that’s not how this works. I said I was getting you a stupidly expensive present and I mean it. So you’re just gonna have to deal with it.” He gave Cas a cheeky grin and swooped in for another kiss.
“P-perhaps I...
at the station. It had never even left the
“N-nothing!” Dean blurted. He winced, knowing how that sounded. “Shit. W-whatever. Are you coming or not?” he demanded.
“We don’t have to,” Dean said again.
This time the smile on Castiel’s face wasn’t hidden at all. It stretched across his face easily, bright and excited.
“I do not think you are a bad person, Dean,” Castiel said.
“Get the idea yet?” Sam asked, like he was speaking to a two-year-old.
Dean grinned smugly into his coffee and pushed forward with his work with renewed fervor. Whatever Cas had going on, the man was clearly still interested, despite everything he might say to push Dean away. Dean let his mind wander back to their kiss the day before, the feel of Castiel’s slim frame pressed up against Dean in a strange formula of yielding masculinity, all soft lines to Dean’s hard angles.
“Finishing my sentences. Reading my mind. Whatever freaky physic shit it is you’re doing,” Dean said.
Dean bounced on his feet in excited anticipation.
Dean had just stowed his phone away when the traffic cleared and the car started rolling. He gazed out the window with a subtle smile pulling at the corners of his lips, noting how the snow was already melting into the gutters as the sun rose bright in a pristine sky, casting its warmth on the frozen world below. It reminded Dean of the news segment Cas had shown him over Christmas about the large snow-melting trucks the city deployed when its volume threatened to overwhelm the city. He had raved about the sustainability of it, had pointed to the tablet, excited as a little kid as he explained how the machine filtered out impurities like sand and rocks from the snowmelt before being pumped into large water tanks. The water would then be hauled away to the sanitation facility and made drinkable. Dean had to admit, he’d been impressed, but mostly he just loved seeing Cas light up like that.
Dean laughed lightly at that. He’d been thinking the exact same thing.
” Dean cursed and ran, Brian hot at his heels, but he didn’t have time to convince the stubborn prick not to follow him.
anyway?”
“Yes,” Castiel supplied, “Are you still planning on picking me up after work?”
the bedroom every now and then,” his father added with a wicked smile.
“So you have mentioned,” Cas replied, sounding a little amused.
By the time they were finished, Castiel had a pretty good idea of what to do about all of it.
“No, I want to,” Castiel rushed in to say, “You just…surprised me.”
to tell Dean is now, but the hunter disagrees.) So, for now Castiel is grounded—quite literally in fact—and research is really the only way he is able to help. It’s not so bad. Castiel enjoys it.
Dean’s breath hitched, and he glanced up again, the emotions churning within him overwhelming and making him a little light-headed.
“Hm?” Castiel said in question, turning around at the woman’s touch.
“Oh. Ahh…thank you. Dean picked it out…” Castiel mumbled, slightly embarrassed to admit it. Soft and a deep ocean blue, the sweater Dean had got him for this occasion probably cost more than all of his wardrobe combined, and he felt a little out of place in the luxurious article.
He collapsed on top of Dean, fingers twitching as they raked through Dean’s short blond hair. Cas made a pleased sound, and damn if it wasn’t that of a well-fucked man.
future. With lots of hot sex.
,” the hunter says when he catches Cas rolling his eyes, “Cuz if you fuck it up, you ain’t going through the guy like Superman. You’re going to break your wrist and probably get yourself killed.”
Alex looked up at him and shrugged.
“Dean,” Castiel’s rumbling response was suddenly a lot more awake than he’d been a minute ago. He grunted as Dean ran his hand down and then up again. “Are you
“It’s true, he’s
“It could be you next,” Justin pointed out, “It could be any of us.”
Dean whispered in his ear. He ran his hand down the length of him, then up again. He licked at the man’s earlobe and then worried it gently between his teeth.
Immediately everything went a blurred red color. Castiel opened his eyes under the blindfold, but found that uncomfortable so closed them again. He felt Dean’s hand at his elbow.
“Oh f-fu—
“Yes, so it is. Merry Christmas,” Jack said through the door.
Doctor Roberts blinked at him and then smirked a little.
“Damnit,” Dean said, frowned. “Fuck it, Cas, five more minutes,” he pressed.
“You mean like you kept your relationship hidden from me?” John shot back at him.
Castiel had hoped the necklace would help him to ascertain Dean’s feelings for him since learning of its unique abilities, but that plan seems to have backfired. The emotions mean nothing without proper context. It is like attempting to break a code without a key in a language that is completely foreign to him and after weeks of this, Castiel is no closer than when he started.
Please let me know what you think!
Dean stowed his phone in his pocket and leaned down to kiss Castiel, slow and tender and sweet. He smiled as he pulled away, the pleasant fluttering of his heart in his chest making him a little breathless.
“Cas?” Sam blurts out when he sees the angel. It’s clear by the look on his face that he has seen everything. “Dean? What the hell, man?”
“What?” Charlie blurted from the other side, “Sorry, Handmaiden, but you’re not my type.”
, if you’ve been paying attention,” Jacob snaps at him, “Where have you
“You’ve done good, son,” John said, clapping a large hand on his shoulder. “Seems you’ve got what it takes to run this company after all.” The full-out grin on the old man’s face grew wider. “What’s say we celebrate? Go somewhere special for dinner?”
Dean stopped dead in his tracks at that.
Jack looked up from his food.
It takes a few 'days' for Jack to come and visit him, but eventually Jack turns up in his little slice of heaven to see how he’s doing.
“What do you think she meant?” he wondered aloud.
“And one black coffee to go,” the man tells her. He hands her a ten.
Dean saw his father coming toward him and cursed under his breath. He ducked into the crowd and headed in the opposite direction.
“What?” Dean asked when he looked up and caught Cas staring.
Dean did a little shopping and then spent the remaining couple of hours working on his laptop in his new home office, answering emails and setting up meetings for the following week. He checked the messages from the recruiter for his new employees—yeah, Dean was going to have
go how Dean wanted it to.
Dean hung up and told the cab driver where to go.
“Uh, on second thought, I could use the extra hand,” Dean said, snapping out of the fantasy. His eyes flitted down to the nametag pinned to the front of the man’s jacket. “Cas.”
until Christmas,” Dean said.
“A Jedi Master does not
He lowered his lips down again, kissing him slowly.
“You…really like bacon, don’t you,” he comments, testing out the idea. He takes his mug in hand and makes his way over to the door.
“But I…” Dean swallowed painfully. “What if I’m not ready?”
“I…don’t understand the question,” Castiel said, squinting at him.
He’d meant to ask it quietly, but Alex heard and glared at him.
!?” Dean asked him, excitement creeping into his voice.
Dean stared at him.
“Dean, please,” Castiel pleaded softly. Dean took pity on him and looped an arm around Cas’s waist, drawing him into his side.
“I work for the hotel,” Castiel supplied, dropping his hand.
His last comment seemed to make some small dent in John Winchester’s iron-clad denial. He finally seemed to recognize the truth of what his son was trying to tell him. This time when he looked at Dean, reading the stubborn set of his jaw and the fire in his eyes, he saw something different.
. Fuckin’
“Hell no. The surprise is half the fun,” Dean replied with a smirk. He gave the oars a long pull to get them going in the right direction, guided this time by a light across the water. He refrained from looking directly at it, just in case Cas were to see where they were headed.
beer lingering on his tongue. His arm looped around Cas, who held their leftovers. Castiel pointed their direction and they headed back toward the heart of Chinatown.
the fish whisperer,” Dean teased.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he says, crossing his arms. “I thought we were discussing the
He felt the angel suck in a breath and go a little rigid.
“What? What do you mean?” Dean asked him.
Dean slipped his hand into Castiel’s the moment they left the building, leading him toward the park. His meeting with Mr. Chen wasn’t until four, so they had plenty of time to grab a leisurely lunch before Dean had to race uptown.
This time Castiel only hesitated a little before answering him.
“Yeah, I got a few minutes until my next class starts. What’s up?” he said finally.
Dean broke away with a sigh some long minutes later.
“Well, this blows,” Alex spoke up suddenly in the middle of a bite of eggs.
“And you are willing to offer your services where they are needed,” Marlene finished. Her eyes glanced up from the clipboard and pinned Castiel down with a look.
Castiel was a deformed lump under the bed covers when Dean walked in. He could just barely make out the top of a messy frock of hair and the tips of his fingers around the edges of the blanket. Dean took three steps into the room and peeked under the covers. A green-gilled Castiel squinted up at him, bleary-eyed and face sweating. He looked about as well as Dean had expected.
“We needed a place where we could speak privately,” Cas replied.
“Dean, I don’t see anything that looks like a—oh wait, I—”
“Hmph. Some boyfriend you are,” Castiel grumbled, “I’m sure I would figure it out.”
“Carmen, hey,” Dean said uneasily, turning to her with a faked charming smile. Holy
“Drop it, Cas.”
“Like a kid in a toy store,” he murmured fondly. Dean shrugged and then spotted something off to his right. He grabbed it and showed it to Cas.
“Do you have any idea what this will cost us?” John said harshly, the frown on his face deepening. “The stock points are going to
“Maybe you can start with why you’re so upset?” Dean suggests. For once, he’s dropped the attitude and sounds a little lost, like he’s starting to realize he fucked up in some big way but doesn’t know what it is yet. This only serves to make Castiel angrier, because while he knows Dean can be insensitive at times, the fact that he is in love with such a clueless ape has him seriously questioning his own sanity.
“Have I what?” Castiel asked back.
“…I have church in the morning,” Cas replied after a brief pause, “And then work at the kitchen.” He paused again, considering. “I suppose I could skip it.”
“I tuned it out,” Castiel replied.
Castiel drew in a sharp inhale and then hummed his agreement.
“Fucking
The door opened and suddenly Castiel was there in the doorway. Dean felt his shoulders relax instantly. He was off the hook, for now at least. Saved by the…bellboy.
“Where should I begin?” Castiel bites back at him. He sinks into one of the chairs around the map table and glares down at its surface.
With one final nod, Dean closes the door behind him and leaves Castiel in solitude not a moment too soon. The crushing weight of his newly human emotions comes crashing down, and Castiel collapses to the floor of his bedroom and weeps.
“Love you too, Ducky,” Dean told him.
“That is where I disagree,” Cas replied, “God wants happiness for all his children—who we are and what we do does not matter to Him.”
, and some teenager he’d just met. Dean pulled back feeling a little dazed. How was this his life now? Who was the man sitting next to him, beaming at him with those big soulful blue eyes? The level of happiness he felt in that moment…it just didn’t seem real.
with him, and he wanted it for good.
The first thing he did was present Cas with a brand new winter getup—a tan pea coat and a vibrantly blue Kashmir scarf to match his eyes. Dean had them hanging in the foyer and when Castiel reached for the peg where his trench coat usually hung, he found these new items in its place instead. He hesitated and drew his hand away.
“Black coffee to go,” Dean tells the barista when he gets to the front of the line. He goes to pull his wallet out of his back pocket when—
He started to turn away but Dean caught him by the arm before he could go.
“Thanks,” John said, lowering the glass.
“Maybe if I didn’t have so many
“Hey, I’m not an angel. You don’t have to worry about me,” Sam said. He grinned at Em and took another drink.
“Hey, show your Queen some respect,” Charlie complained at him when he practically sat on her. She elbowed him playfully and settled a little closer to Jo on the couch.
He slipped Castiel’s suit coat off and tossed it over the chair in the corner, pulling him in by the lapels of his shirt to kiss him slow but deep. Cas groaned a little, and he stopped as Sam snorted in his sleep and rolled over.
Cas shows up Dean’s heart stutters and then
“Cas, you can’t even eat a fucking sandwich so what the hell do you know about it?” Dean countered.
Dean shrugged and smirked a little, but agreed it probably wasn’t a discussion to have in front of his brother and the kid. He
“Happy New Year, Cas,” he said affectionately.
and Dean, gullible as ever had driven two full days worrying like hell to find it was all just a ruse to get him here. As soon as he stepped through Bobby’s front door, Sam grabbed him by the arms and forced him into the living room, holding him down while Bobby tied him to a chair that was set inside a devil’s trap.
Castiel reached up and framed Dean’s face in his hands.
The song was clearly very special to Dean, given that it wasn’t his first or even twentieth time playing it, but it was uncanny how closely the lyrics matched their relationship. Though, perhaps the lyrics were commonplace enough to speak to most couples, Castiel thought. Regardless of that, Dean was singing it to
Castiel stepped up to him and took Dean’s hands in his own, a gentle look on his face.
“You make the cutest little ducky,” Dean said by way of a greeting.
“Maybe I’ll come by to visit again sometime,” he said, turning back briefly. He left with a, “Good night, son.”
“Well, are you going to tell us how you both met, or what?” Ellen asked.
The loving smile that Cas graced Dean with brought the tears pooling back to his eyes.
“People get lost for a lot longer than that all the time,” Jack said quietly.
Dean scowls at her and signs quickly,
“Sam. I am fine. I will just be a minute,” Castiel said. He turned on the water and began washing his hands, as though that was what he had intended to do all along.
“To kicking ass!” Jo echoed. She took a sip of her drink and then asked, “So? What’s your story?”
“It’s a Christmas thing,” Dean said in between short, messy kisses, “I’ll show you.”
world? So…where the fuck am I exactly? Who the hell are you, the Wizard of Oz?”
—nnngg…”
Dean obliged and again Castiel cried out in a loud moan. His forehead dropped to the mattress and he breathed in deeply, attempting to find an anchor in the heady ecstasy he was experiencing. Dean didn’t allow him the chance to come down—he flicked his tongue at Cas’s perineum, then licked a strip up and around his puckering hole. Castiel groaned and shuddered under him, begging for more.
It surprised Dean how
Castiel pulled back abruptly, turning his head to the side and drawing a deep breath.
“Yeah,” Dean said again, this time sounding a little embarrassed, “Love you too, Cas.”
His pants were still rumpled around his knees, and Cas took the opportunity to pull them all the way off. He did the same with his own and then returned to Dean in a flash to kiss him deeply, slipping his tongue past Dean’s lips so that he could drink in the heady taste of his arousal. Dean groaned and bucked his hips, cock grinding against Cas as he dragged his hands through Cas’s hair.
I'll be posting around 1pm Eastern Standard Time, so be sure to tune in! :D
“Naw, he’s livin’ the dream—teaching runways and girls with nowhere else to go how to play the piano.” Dean’s grin widened, and he couldn’t help the bubbling ramble that followed. “There’s this one girl, Claire?” He shook his head with a chuckle. “Drives him absolutely insane. But he loves it. You should see how happy he is.”
“My mom…she left me with my grandma a few years ago and went looking for him. When my gran died, I thought she would show up and we could be a family again, but…well, short version is she didn’t and I ended up in the system.”
“Shit. I knew it. Looks stupid,” he blurted, “I’ll take it off.”
looks young enough to be his
one, and it’s a pretty big upside if he’s honest—is that Cas is okay. When Chuck gave them the news that Cas blew angel chunks all over the writer/prophet’s house, Dean pretty much accepted the fact that they had just started to become buddies and he was already forced to say goodbye. And yeah, it sucked—missed opportunities and all that—but Cas hasn’t been around that long so maybe his loss didn’t hit as hard as it should have. Maybe Dean’s still reeling from the fact that there’s an
When the shirt was past his navel, that was when Dean dropped the bomb he had hiding up his sleeve.
Dean let his mind wander down that road for a long minute while he sipped his coffee, motioning for a refill when he reached the bottom. He had a feeling him and Sam would be hitting the town tonight, and he was going to need every drop of caffeine he could get.
The older gentleman’s brow pinched together in sudden concern. If he had to name one difference between this man and his son, Dean thought, it would be the eyebrows. Cas always kept his neatly trimmed. Those belonging to his father looked like the dust bunnies Dean sometimes found under their bed—that, or an out-of-control Chia Pet. The bushy, overgrown nests of black were streaked with the color of his namesake—similar to the hair atop his head—and Dean thought to himself that one of the silver linings of this visit (no pun intended), was in learning that he wouldn’t have to worry about receding hairlines in his future, at the very least.
“Please, Honey, tell me you’ll do me next,” the queen flirted. A looming shadow suddenly cast over his spotlight. Em glanced up at the culprit.
When he woke, Cas had his arms wrapped around him and was looking down into his eyes.
“Yes, I…I am starting to see that,” Castiel said, sounding relieved. He pulled back from the embrace, eyes flickering up, then back to the covers. His brow pulled together sharply. “To be honest I don’t understand
It is all suddenly far too much for Castiel’s new human self to handle. His hands begin to tremble. He pushes himself to his feet like he can’t get away quick enough.
Dean tried to catch her attention but she was swamped with orders and wasn’t looking up. He elbowed his way through the crowd and picked up the wrench, then knocked her lightly on the head with it.
“Really? Tinted windows?” she commented snidely, “What, did you rob P. Diddy on the way over?”
Dean laughed.
“Uh…” Justin glanced at Brian, who was standing next to Castiel with a look on his face that Justin had only seen once before. Brian caught his eyes and he nodded almost imperceptivity. “Uh…sure. What, are you going to read my palm or something?”
Sam picked up on the third ring.
They've got the flirting thing down, but will Cas say yes to a date?
“Sorry, not used to this,” he said, biting his lip. Castiel’s eyes flickered to his mouth.
“How about I heat you up some bath water next time,” Dean murmured against his skin, pressing another slow kiss to the crook of his neck, “Sound good?”
“Good, though things have been slow. Not much is happening today.”
He said it so
“I don’t often eat in,” he said defensively, “It’s just a place to crash while I save for school.”
“Got an idea,” Dean said suddenly with a wicked grin, pulling Castiel to his feet. “Follow me!” He tugged Castiel behind him, running for the front door.
He pulls out his cell phone and tries to get a signal but the phone just beeps at him. The little bar icon in the corner blinks at zero.
Castiel convulsed under him as Dean’s finger rubbed over his prostate. He pushed a second finger into the tight opening. Castiel clenched around him and trembled, crying out in pleasure again as Dean’s fingers slid over that magic spot.
“Sam,” he croaks, hands still gripping the angel, and it’s enough that Cas knows what he means.
It took a long time for him to finally fall asleep.
“Cutting it close there, Ducky,” Dean said, grinning down at him. Castiel released him with a small huff of laughter.
“And how are you boys today?” she asked warmly, putting her clipboard down on the counter.
“That’s too bad,” Brian said, grinning at him, “I was hoping to buy you a drink.”
John, who had been listening in frowned and spoke up.
“Now, since we have a few hours to kill, I want to hear all about you and him,” Missouri said. She settled back into her chair, shifting around to get comfortable as though she were in her own living room rather than squashed into the narrow metal frame of the airplane seat. “Don’t leave out a single detail,” she added, giving Dean a severe look that could rival his grandmother’s, “’cause I’ll know about it if you do.”
“I know that, and it’s not
“Does it matter?” Dean asked, feeling his face heat up under the weight of his question. “I was going to tell you, Sam. I just wasn’t ready until now.”
There’s a spike in the joy coming from the pendant, followed immediately by something else—something that makes Castiel’s stomach flop over: Nervousness? Exhilaration? Guilt? Longing? He doesn’t understand the torrent of emotions. They are swirling and confusing and potent, and he has never felt anything like it before. He drops the pendant in his pocket and instantly the feeling vanishes, leaving him hollow and aching.
That took Dean by surprise. Cas had never mentioned talking to his folks, and he
He was probably busy doing angel stuff, right? Dean shouldn’t expect… Surely he would’ve come by now. He must not want…
“No, I guess not,” Dean murmured back. He let out a small sigh. “I’m sorry, Cas. You were right and I should have listened to you.”
Still, it brought something else important to the forefront of his mind.
“Oh, I want it alright,” he said. He covered Cas’s mouth eagerly, pressing lips and teeth and tongue into him as they stood on the shore of the lake. “It’s perfect, Cas, thank you,” Dean said softly when he pulled away.
“What’s that for?” Dean asked, leaning over his shoulder. He rested his chin on Cas’s shoulder and felt it when Cas turned and grinned at his nearness.
Dean shook his head to snap himself out of the fantasy and looked back at his father.
Third, he and Dean do not talk about what Castiel told him before The Empty swallowed him whole.
think? You read the tabloids,” Dean said.
Dean frowned down the hallway where Claire and Jack had fled.
“Ever been with a 10, sweetheart?” the man asked.
“Look, I get that it’s scary as hell,” Sam started, “I mean, I
Jo looked at her like that was a really dumb fucking question, and answered with, “Are you kidding? Pretty sure it’s illegal for a kid to serve alcohol but hey, nobody ever complained.”
“What else can you make?” he asked.
The emotions appear one by one. Happiness fades to guilt, then longing. A deep sadness lingers for a long time. Castiel sits with it, allowing his own sadness to blend together with that of the amulet’s. He feels strangely close to his hunter as he does, as though Dean were right there in the room with him. Of course, Dean would never allow for that, and perhaps that is why they were doomed from the start—neither of them understand the ‘right’ way to deal with this sort of situation. Castiel can’t fault Dean for rejecting something they
“There’s no reason to drag you all the way out here,” John said, “I’m planning on spending the weekend at home, catch up on a few things. I should be back Sunday evening.”
“It is my favorite so far,” Castiel replied softly. The insinuation was light on his tongue.
“Sir, you can’t—” one of the paramedics started to tell him.
Just like when Dean had promised him two weeks for a kiss.
,” Dean instructs, “Keep your center of gravity
“So, Cas, you religious?” Samuel asked suddenly. He stuffed another bite of mashed potatoes into his mouth.
you?” Jacob says, “And where is everyone?”
Dean never thought in a million years that he would find himself in a church
“You’re kidding me, right? Jesus,
He pulled back and rested his forehead against Cas’s, thumb stroking the side of his face. They stood in silence for a long time, breathing in each other’s air and feeling the energy pulse between them. And it wasn’t just arousal, though that was there too. It was something more.
“Ahh—y-yes, Dean. Please—more. I want more!” Castiel begged, eyes screwed shut. Dean obliged and rocked his hips forward powerfully, drawing a guttural moan out of Cas.
Cas was clearly waiting for him in the lobby when he arrived, and Dean had a split-second to bolt before the man glanced up and saw him.
As promised, he shot all over his trademark coat.
. He never expected he would have to face Dean after saying those words and now here he is sitting so close to the hunter that he can feel the warmth radiating off of him. The memory plays in Castiel’s head like an old movie reel that’s seen far too much wear and tear over the years—chunks of it are missing. He vaguely remembers Dean saying something to him before The Empty took him, but the memory is fuzzy...
Castiel looked at him a little guiltily and seemed uncomfortable. He lowered his hand slowly.
“Which is short for
“The thought did cross my mind,” the angel mumbled. His hand around Dean’s shifted nervously. Dean didn’t let him think about it too much, just pulled him in for another kiss.
glad I called. I’ll let Mr. Smith know right away that you’re willing to help him out.” Charlie barely paused, rolling along like a pro—and it suddenly occurred to Dean that this wasn’t the first time she had done something like this. “I’ll go ahead and rebook your flight for tomorrow, if that’s alright with you..?”
Dean trails off. That’s his biggest regret, really. All the time he wasted keeping the angel at arm’s length when he could have…
Brian had barely finished the thought when suddenly Dean heaved upward in a deep inhale.
The other women listened closely, leaning in to hear all the juicy details.
, Cas,” Dean told him in a deadpan. He dropped his voice to where his father wouldn’t be able to hear him and whispered in Castiel’s ear. “Think about it. You, me, a fireplace. Cozy flannel PJs and old woolen blankets. Fresh trout and pancakes for breakfast. Chocolate and wine after dark, and then I’ll take you on a pile of quilts next to the fire, make you beg for more.”
They went inside the office to sign the release forms and then followed the manager out to the lot in back. Dean let out a giddy whoop when the sleek black of the Impala came into view, morning sun glistening off her roof. He ran up to the car and laid his body over the hood.
“Y’know, usually you tip
Dean’s attention was immediately diverted to the rows upon rows of sugary treats lined up around the store. He tried a sample from the next bowl in line. Candied plum. Castiel followed and looked over his shoulder, reading the labels as he tried each, perhaps knowing Dean wasn’t bothering before stuffing whatever it was into his mouth.
In an attempt to salvage the good mood, Castiel says, “It was a joke, Dean. ‘Chill it.’”
With breakfast over, it was time to hit the road. Dean and Cas retreated back upstairs to pack, or rather—Dean packed, leaving Cas to explore Dean’s childhood room as he stuffed everything back into their shared suitcase. Castiel had finished well before breakfast and now stood in front of Dean’s bookshelf, picking over the titles of the books that rested on the dusty shelves. Dean stopped packing for a minute and came up behind him. He watched the man for a beat and then carded his hand through Castiel’s hair.
“I don’t want to rush this,” he said. He dropped a feather-light kiss on Castiel’s lips and then drew back to find his eyes again. “I want to worship you.” The added murmur was nearly lost in the soft, slow kiss that he placed on Cas’s lips. He followed this with a series of light, teasing caresses, dipping his tongue in and out playfully and pulling back just as Castiel leaned forward for more.
Castiel nodded quickly.
“You’re welcome,” Jack replies succinctly, “Your world is fine, by the way. Well done. Of the seven hundred billion worlds Chuck created, yours was one of 28 to survive without divine intervention. So, thank you. It makes my job a lot easier.”
“Good.”
notice, neither one of them said anything about it.
“I’m not,” Dean assured him, “You were right. What we’ve been doing…it’s not healthy. And you deserve better than that.” Dean raised a hand to Cas’s face, trailed his fingers over the angel’s cheek as he searched deep blue eyes for something he was almost too afraid to see. “I care about you, Cas. You know that, right?”
“No, Helen. He needs to understand. The Bible clearly says—”
Castiel locked eyes with him and slowly drew his hand down and around his swelling penis, then up again. His eyes fluttered closed when he reached the head and he leaned back into the pillows, arching up his back and lifting his hips to fuck into his fist.
“Let me walk you back,” Dean offered.
Why are you awake? How are you free?” The Empty pushes right up into Jacob’s face. He’s scared shitless but he refuses to blink. Fear is only going to get them killed. “I buried you,” The Empty spits at him.
“Dean…” he warbled, eyes filling with tears.
“Dean?” Castiel murmured, casting his voice low so as not to spoil the tranquility of the moment.
