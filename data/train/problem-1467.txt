“I’m sorry, Sherlock, but your temperature is over 39 degrees. You’re burning up. You were released only under the condition that you’d return if you developed a fever. So come on, get up.”
John very pragmatically filled him in on Sherlock’s injuries. Mycroft never showed any reaction as John enumerated bruises, bites, and scratch marks although his eyebrow twitched a little when John mentioned the serious bite mark on the shoulder.
But he still couldn’t avert his gaze. He found himself aching with the need to know more about the guy.
“Well, if you enjoy the tea so much, won’t you consider eating at least a little bowl of soup?” he asked and sighed when Sherlock was already shaking his head as soon as he started talking.
“Suck it like the good little whore that you are, “she growled, and he stifled a sob as she began to push the gun in and out of his mouth. Thankfully, he didn’t have to do anything – she did all the motions herself.
“Alright then, Mr. Holmes, “Mrs. Wilkins said, her voice patient and calm. “Then tell me what details you do remember.”
He laid his free hand over John’s hand covering his other. They both stared at their connected hands and John could almost feel the heat pooling in the pit of his stomach, adding to the overall restlessness of his body. His heart hammered against his ribcage. The air between them was heavy, and they would probably hear a pin drop in the perplexing silence between them.
Mrs. Hudson flinched at John’s sudden outburst and he was sorry, but he was angry at himself for being so naïve and angry at Sherlock for being so childish and he needed an outlet.
Sherlock sat in his bed, no longer looking at the telly, fuming and staring into empty space. John knew it was probably wise not to say anything now. Sherlock needed to calm down and addressing him now would only rile him up further. John gritted his teeth at the troublesome sight of Sherlock sitting there like that, all tense shoulders and taut jawline and he would have liked to pull him into a soft embrace, to tell him that he would be home soon and it was gonna be okay. But he didn’t.
Suddenly, his phone rang completely tearing him out of his thoughts. He startled and the tea nearly spilled out of the cup had it not been half-drained already. Quickly, he put the cup down and jumped out of the chair to fumble for his phone in the pockets of his Belstaff coat. Finally, he found it.
“Greg, I’m sorry, I really have to take care of Sherlock now, “John said impatiently, he wasn’t even looking at Greg, instead, he frantically looked after Sherlock in the ambulance car.
“That sounds great, “John conceded, “but doesn’t it irk you that you need his permission to go to university? Or to do anything at all, that is”
But as soon as he had said the words, Sherlock’s eyes widened in panic and he started to shake his head.
“I’ve searched all over for you, John, you worried me!” The strange but also familiar voice sounded somewhere over his head.
“He’s still sleeping, Mycroft, “John said wearily, “so you’ll have to wait a little more if you want to talk to him.”
“Of course. Goodbye gentlemen.” Mycroft threw one last glance at John and Greg and then followed his little brother who had already left the room.
At long last, he was able to enter his mind palace again. The fever was still raging inside his transport, but it was less forceful now. Sherlock was still bewildered by the fact that John had dragged him into the shower and placed them both underneath the unrelenting spray of water. A million details had to be looked at, turned over, and analyzed and now that John had helped him get rid of the worst of the fever, allowing him entry into his palace, he could finally explore and analyze his most recent memories.
The doctor frowned slightly. “Well, there is a little problem actually. Mr. Holmes is making a bit of a fuss and we wondered if you could maybe calm him down? He really needs to rest.”
Suddenly, he needed to make sure he was okay. After everything that had happened the past few days, John was unable to trust the peace and quiet. It felt almost surreal, lying here on the sofa, safe and sound, with no blaring sirens, no interfering Mycroft, no bickering Sherlock.
John caught Sherlock’s gaze as his eyes roamed over the deep shadows that ran alongside the trees high above their heads. Sherlock winked at him then – utter, arrogant cock that he was, and the corners of John’s lips automatically curled upwards, as if that motion were imprinted into the muscles of his mouth, a reflex in his brain that just couldn’t be turned off.
He got up and fetched some clean clothes from Sherlock’s wardrobe, just a T-Shirt and some loose pants (although he had to dig a little to find these items, Sherlock really owned a lot of dress shirts and pants).
He tried to sidestep the taller man but the Alpha pushed a hand against his chest, keeping him where he stood against the wall.
“Idiot” he mumbled to himself as he made his way to the counter to order two more glasses of beer for his friends. With the full glasses in his hands, he fought his way through the crowd again and managed to arrive at his table (with still all of the beer in the glasses ) where John and Greg were sitting with their heads stuck together, probably to be able to hear each other.
He was tall and thin, elegantly clad in a beige three-piece suit, as he stepped to the front desk where he left his expensive-looking briefcase, his eyes roaming over the large lecture room, taking in the various student’s faces. He seemed to be maybe fifty years old, probably a little older. His piercing blue eyes were shark-like as they scrutinized one face after the other through frameless glasses and John and Mike looked at each other warily. The way the professor looked at them was almost unsettling and John thought that there had probably never been a teacher he had taken a disliking to so quickly.
Scott was watching him intently, his body sprung into fight-or-flight-mode as he waited for John to attack him. When John stayed completely still, trying to make himself appear as peaceful as possible, he eventually relaxed, exhaling shakily. His eyes still remained focussed on John though.
“Okay, okay, calm down, love, I’ll stay.” He stroked Sherlock’s curly head and sighed in relief when Sherlock indeed seemed to calm down underneath him. Without disentangling from the man, John extended his arm backward and fumbled beneath the edge of the bed. Luckily, he had lain just at the right place and he managed to grab the discarded bed sheets and pull them over the two of them.
“What, have you changed your mind? Won’t you sing to me after all? After all your teasing about your Scottish grandmother?”
John looked back at him over his shoulder incredulously, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, shoving him some more. “What are you looking at? Come on, we’ve got to get going. That corpse is not going to lie around and wait for us forever, you know. Quick, get yourself ready, I’ll give you …. ten minutes, then I’m out of here.”
When it had finally reached the required temperature, John crouched down in front of Sherlock and tried to rouse him again. Unfortunately, Sherlock still did not react to his desperate pleas to wake up.
“I was at the pub with friends. I drank some beer and apparently it was drugged because suddenly I could hardly move my legs and arms anymore, I was dizzy, my head hurt, my vision was fuzzy. This guy got a hold of me and dragged me away. I don’t know where. I remember him …. touching me.” His voice broke just a little and John closed his eyes in sympathy.
They had had so much fun together. They played tricks on their comrades at school, snuck out of school to smoke their first cigarette together, or to ride the rollercoaster down at the funfair, stealing a kiss up high in the sky on the big wheel, where everyone else was just tiny ants below them. Nothing meant anything, only Mary’s soft lips on John’s, her excited laugh as she buried her face into his shoulder, pretending to be afraid of heights. It had been truly glorious.
Sherlock seemed content with that answer and began to tell his story again. He did it in the same clinical, monotonous voice as before with the nurse and he spoke even quicker than before, eager to get it over with. He showed no open emotions when he spoke of his abuse and his body didn’t betray any sentiment either – apart from the blazing eyes, John could not help but notice. There was something dark in them, something forlorn as he recounted how he had been touched, kissed, and bitten without his consent.
“I’d like to know what’s going on here, too, “he said, after a minute of silence, looking at Greg again. “I’ve answered all your questions, you have my statement. I’d like to leave now.”
“Fine, “Sherlock replied at once, and he smirked in response to John’s eye roll at the typical answer.
“Yeah, I wondered that too,” said Charles, the younger brother sitting next to John. “Maybe they’re sick in the head or something. Especially that one.” He waved his gun in the direction of Sherlock’s face. “The way he was lying there with his face in our stuff, sniffing around – that was almost creepy.”
Finally, they arrived at the crime scene – a warehouse in eastern Chelsea, apparently. The place was swarming with policemen. John steeled himself to face a corpse at this early hour when Sherlock jumped out of the cab a few seconds before it even came to a full stop.
He wanted to say it out loud, but Sherlock was quicker. “I’m sorry I said that John. It was complete rubbish and not true. I … I was scared and didn’t know what to say.”
It was an interesting image to think about and the time passed as they both turned their focus on their now poisoned sample, scribbling down notes as they took turns at the microscope.
John’s body was screaming for more, but he tried to ignore it. This was a huge step in their relationship and he wouldn’t ruin anything by overwhelming Sherlock on the very special occasion of their very first kiss. Well, second kiss.
John hadn’t dared to wake him again, he wanted him to regain some strength before Mycroft turned up.  But now he needed to rouse him, Mycroft would be here in just ten minutes – on the dot, of course, he was the British government after all. He had briefly thought of calling Mycroft to tell him that there would be no examination. At least not today, Sherlock just couldn’t deal with that right now in his fragile state. But then he had decided against it. Mycroft would not have listened to him because he was just as stubborn as his little brother was, John knew that already. And he was an arrogant, pompous ass, too (just like Sherlock).
He had realized earlier than that of course. He had realized it on the day John had shot the cabbie and he had somehow been okay with that. Sentiment was a disadvantage but with John, it had always been okay. A tiny voice inside his head had always warned him to watch out, to not let things between him and John grow too strong, it would only make him weak. John would become a liability sooner or later.
John Watson’s face fell, then it went a deep shade of red. He held up an angry finger, right into Sherlock’s face.
“We were starting to worry, “John shouted as he leaned towards him so he could hear him. “Did you have any trouble?” His face was aflush with the heat and the alcohol in his blood and it was quite endearing, at least to Sherlock.
He finally turned his head and looked at Sherlock, his eyes blue and sad and clear. “I was shocked to see how mad he was at you, Scott. You saw how he reacted when he thought it was you who broke the microscope. He was being completely unprofessional, yelling at you like that. And if I’m being honest... yes, I was afraid for you at that moment. I was afraid he would go even further, maybe even hurt you physically, he was so angry. So yes, I stepped in because I couldn’t allow him to hurt you in any way. I didn’t want him to single you out even further. You’re obviously passionate about what you’re doing, I don’t want him to ruin your chances of passing this class. That’s all, I swear. There is no hidden agenda, no plan, or anything else. I did not plot anything with Victor and Sebastian and I despise those twats for how they’re treating you. I thought I already made that clear, but okay, apparently not.”
“No, no, I’m not interested in his kitchen, why would I be interested, for God’s sake? Try the bathroom, yes, that’s better.”
Tenderly, he took Sherlock’s wrist from his arm and held it in both his hands, slowly stroking him reassuringly. “Of course, “he said quietly. “Always, for you.”
Suddenly there was silence in the room and John asked himself if there was another “important matter” Mycroft wanted to talk about.
“Well …. to talk about what happened to you.” John knew concern was showing in his voice, knew it would upset Sherlock, but he couldn’t hide it. He wanted his friend to be alright and he knew he needed help.
Sherlock was speechless for a moment, even unable to slap away the hand on his knee which was what he should be doing.
But all the same, he had ignored that voice. How could he not when John had shot a man for him, put himself in harm’s way in front of Moriarty? Maybe it was okay to just have one weakness.
Feeling strangely dazed, John tried to steer his thoughts into another direction. He thought of Sherlock’s tendency to forget his own safety, obsessed with chasing after criminals without thinking. Why did he always run off into danger, letting himself get hurt?
And then he was gone. John settled back into his pillows, switched the lights off, and closed his eyes. Somehow, he found himself unable to fall asleep despite his utter exhaustion a few minutes ago. Instead, he spent a good amount of time lying on his back, staring at the ceiling, lost in his thoughts about his strange roommate Sherlock Holmes. His
It was true. He knew that John was right. Of course, John was always right. Well, most of the time, at least.
And at Sherlock’s confused look at him, he added “We don’t have to drink much, Sherlock. You don’t even have to drink anything with alcohol in it if you don’t want to.”
A content smile crept up John’s face as he heard someone shout their names, footsteps approaching fast.
“Ah, alright, “Scott said, his face dropping in obvious disgust and he turned and walked away from John.
“Please, “he asked again as he pressed the glass to the tight line of Sherlock’s lips. “Please drink this, you need to stay hydrated. Please. For me.”
It was Saturday night and they had finally solved a very frustrating and complicated murder case that had occupied them for the last few weeks. Especially Sherlock had been utterly invested -well, as usual, but even more than that which had cost John a lot of sleep because of his friend’s habit of staying up all night, playing the violin (which he always did when he was caught up in a dead-end in a case).
They had nearly reached the doorway now. Very slowly, John moved his head to the side so that he could see what was happening in the room. He was still at an adverse angle, but he could see what was going on: the woman had a gun in her hand, and she had shoved it into Sherlock’s mouth. She was pushing it in and out, mimicking a very obvious physical act. Sherlock who was barely able to keep his head upright didn’t struggle, he just let it happen, but John could see the pain and humiliation in his shimmering green-blue eyes.
“I admit that’s a reason, “John conceded sincerely. “But as I said, I was also very impressed by how you dealt with Magnussen. You’re incredibly clever. That’s hot.”
He had just barely caught a glimpse of the genius that John was, had seen a hint of his bravery and kindness when he had shot the cabbie for him.
After another quick glance at the door he started perusing the documents. After having looked at just a few pages his lips curled into a triumphant smirk.
John took a deep breath and gently disentangled himself from the other man. Sherlock shifted onto his backside and watched nervously, as John sat in front of him, pulling his thin hands into his lap where he held and stroked them. He fixed Sherlock with a solemn look and finally spoke again.
“I-I just don’t know anymore, “John all but whispered. “I have hurt him, I have pushed him too far, maybe he’s just sick and tired of me…”
And indeed, she pushed the bed right next to Sherlock’s, so that the sides of their beds were almost touching.
Okay, this had to stop. There were endless possibilities of what could have happened to his friend and John couldn’t bear thinking about it any longer – he needed to go and find out himself. Having made that decision, he got up from his chair at once.
John watched his friend quietly and he couldn’t help but worry about him. Well, when did he ever not worry about Sherlock? But never as strong as this time and never under these kinds of circumstances, that was a given. It was his impression that his friend tried to appear stronger than he actually felt. He had admitted to being tired, that was at least something. But he was already walking about their apartment as if nothing unusual had happened last night and as if he wasn’t still under the influence of a sedative drug, well probably at least. He needed him to be reasonable, he needed him to work with him, let himself be looked after properly. That meant eating, for instance, too.
John was just musing over the idea of suggesting going to counselling sessions again – now that Sherlock was in such a good mood again – when Sherlock suddenly jolted up from his chair, his eyes widening in sudden revelation.
“Hey, “Mike said as he approached him. “I saw you talking to that kid Scott Williams from our class, but then I saw you were arguing and waited here for you. What happened?”
“Alright. First, you’re very muscular, especially in your arms and shoulders. You’re an Alpha too and a popular one judging from the many looks you were getting from females and males alike when you entered the lecture hall. Deduction: you’re a rugby player, possibly a captain. It’s still the most popular sport here as in most British universities. The way you hold yourself implies a recent injury to your shoulder, which again suggests you’re involved in some kind of sport that heavily relies on your shoulder.”
He closed his mouth in embarrassment when he realized that it had been open, cheeks flushing slightly scarlet.
The curiosity on his face must have been obvious is, because she grabbed his hand with another laugh.
“No, no trouble, “he shouted back, placing the full glasses of beer in front of his friends, “only annoying people who cannot take a hint.”
“Yes, “he admitted sheepishly, not knowing if he had insulted her. But the expression on her face was sympathetic and gleeful, instead of angry.
“Don’t apologize, “Sherlock said hoarsely, and he smiled at John, although the smile never reached his eyes. Was there a tear glistening in the corner of his eye or was that a figment of John’s imagination? “It’s not your fault. Everything’s fine, thanks to you. I’m not mad at you, how could I be? You saved me.”
Magnussen’s eyes were as cold as ever as they looked down upon him, although his lips were curled into a condescending smile. His assistant was standing behind him with a nervous look on his face, holding his leather bag, waiting for the Professor to finish his conversation, and Sherlock’s throat tightened in sudden apprehension. Why had the Professor stopped?
John pinched the bridge of his nose. He was tired and he didn’t want to talk about this. What he wanted was to look after Sherlock again, to make sure he was okay. But he knew he couldn’t get out of this, so it would be better to just get it over with.
“What an arrogant sod you are, John Watson! First, you come on to me and when I refuse you, you don’t respect that but only come on to me stronger. Then you give me some lame apologies, claiming you’re not like every other arrogant Alpha out there. And now you’re doing this.  You’ve changed tactics, haven’t you? Saw your opportunity in there and went straight for it.”
John had to threaten him with Mycroft and his dubious ways of abducting Sherlock to convince him to return home for some hastily consumed Chinese takeaway as well as at least a couple of hours sleep before they would return to their hunt at the break of dawn. Well, in reality, it had only been him who had slept. Sherlock had preferred to spend the hours at Baker Street in his mind palace or in front of his laptop, complaining about John’s tedious, silly demands for rest. He refused to admit that he had been nodding off occasionally, even when John caught him once with his head on the keypad.
“Don’t thank me yet, Dr. Watson, you’re still in prison. I regret I haven’t been able to extract you from there already, but it seems your case is a little difficult. Still, tomorrow midday seems a reasonable timing, so be ready for it. I just wanted you to know that.”
Mike agreed to join him although it was only eleven o’clock. Greg stayed, hoping to get his hands on the Alpha from before, promising to tell John if he had succeeded the next day.
When Mike came to collect him for a couple of beers with a few blokes from the room next door, he agreed only because he knew there would be a lot of questions if he didn’t. He laughed along when his friends made fun of some of their new professors while he nursed his bottle of beer but he wasn’t really into it and said his goodbyes earlier than usual, claiming he had a headache.
“But…” Sherlock’s mouth was hanging open, he still was struggling to comprehend that this was not how this was supposed to go.
His eyes lit up as he realized what was in front of him. He put his thumb on the right nipple of the Asian woman and pushed – sure enough there was an unmistakable sound behind him, indicating a mechanism had opened up somewhere. He rolled his eyes as he put the figurine back onto the shelf.
“Strange that you would favour Omegas, “Victor said with a sneer. “I’d have pegged you for the type begging for an Alpha’s cock.”
Sherlock shrugged and turned around to walk back towards the bar’s entrance.  He dropped his head and chuckled quietly to himself, content with how he managed this little problem and feeling quite good. No one could claim he couldn’t hold his own in a fight. Okay, they hadn't fought physically, well not per se but there had been physical contact – he shuddered again when he thought of the other’s man’s nearness and resolved not to think about it anymore when he heard a voice behind him call out to him.
“You want to ask me out on a date, “Scott eventually said, his pale eyes hard as he raised them to John’s again.
When Sherlock had referred to him as a friend in front of Sebastian Wilkes, John had corrected him: “Colleague.” That had hurt, he had thought John would appreciate being called his friend instead of acting ashamed.
Sherlock didn’t make any fuss as John got up to get the antibiotics and tape and gauze to change the dressing. He took his medicine without complaint and he didn’t say anything when John’s hand casually slid around his wrist, silently taking his pulse. He blushed, however, when John gently asked him to remove his shirt and he quickly pulled it over his head to hide his reddening cheeks, feeling absolutely mortified.
“Well, “Greg said quietly, without looking at John, “I’m not gonna put that last sentence into your statement, I guess.”
Sherlock beamed and he looked so carefree and delighted in his eager anticipation of the new case, it was adorable. “I called him right after waking up this morning, I was so bored. And you see, I was lucky, he had just had a call from someone who had found a corpse in a warehouse in Chelsea. I’d say it was fate, wouldn’t you?” And he winked at John. The strange feeling inside John’s belly made itself known again.
He was still young after all. He could tie himself to someone else later when he was a doctor with his own practice and an impressive salary, a nice house in the suburbs, and a full bank account to his name. He wanted all that: a wife, kids, a house, maybe even a dog.
“And this is what you need to keep in mind if you want to get at least average results at the end of this course,“ Magnussen was just saying. He fell silent as he studied the subdued expression on the faces of his students, most of which averted their gaze when he turned his cold eyes on them, only a handful of brave ones daring to meet them.
They went inside and immediately started to dance, at Tonya’s suggestion. A bubbly pop song was being played and she pulled him close, wrapping her arms around his neck suggestively. They moved to the rhythm of the song and John liked the feeling of her slim, warm body writhing against his, her faint scent of jasmine tickling his nose in a nice way. She was making it very clear that she liked him and he thought that he would have no trouble getting her to invite him to her room later that night.
The woman on top of him didn’t seem perturbed by his increasing distress. She let her hands wander up and down his chest and throat and she obviously enjoyed the way it made him squirm beneath her.
John’s eyes widened in surprise, but he recovered quickly, smiled, and slipped the thermometer into Sherlock’s mouth. While they both waited for the verdict, they kept looking at each other, and Sherlock repressed the urge to shiver as sudden heat pooled in the pit of his stomach, causing him to fidget onto his knees restlessly.
“Yes, he will.” Sherlock was beaming again, seemingly unaware of the little dispute he and John had had beforehand.
The auditorium was packed with people, the smell of sweat and alcohol permeating the air, making it harder than usual to catch anyone’s scent. But they were standing quite close to each other in order to be able to hear each other and he found that he couldn’t detect her scent. Weren’t Omegas supposed to stand out with their exceedingly sweet smell, unable to go unnoticed?
“It shouldn’t be legal!” Scott spit out angrily. “It’s inhumane that someone can just decide to murder another person just because they’re an Omega!”
“Nonsense, Sherlock, “she muttered, then she looked back, “are you coming? But only this once, as you know I’m not your housekeeper, dear.”
“Yes. I must admit when Mr. Holmes called me to tell me that you would be here soon I thought of informing him about his brother’s state. He instructed me to inform him at once if his brother showed signs of great agitation while in this state. But that didn’t happen, he has stayed calm the whole time. So I didn’t call the boss. I thought if someone knew how to handle this, it would be you. Right?” He looked hopefully at John who realized that Frederic was scared that he had made a mistake by not telling Mycroft about Sherlock, that he maybe would get scolded for this or worse.
“Show me the picture, “Sherlock said, as he swallowed heavily and with a sudden determined look on his face. He still had some reserves left, it seemed.
“Mrs. Hudson, could you do me a favour? Would you look after Sherlock while I talk with the Inspector here? Just make sure he’s breathing normally, alright?”
John rolled his eyes. “Sherlock. You have barely eaten anything in the past few days. As normal as that is for you, sadly, the circumstances are not. Your body has been put through quite a lot. You’re exhausted and you need nutrition. You will eat your breakfast. All of it.”
And now there were some alarm bells ringing in Sherlock’s head because this…this couldn’t be right, could it? Who was this bloke claiming he knew him, aiming to take him home?
Sherlock’s face turned red with anger. “I do what I want and I’m sick of you trying to keep me from doing it!”
Sherlock’s skin felt warm and soft beneath his fingers and John suppressed the urge to pull Sherlock up into his arms, against his chest where he could feel his heart beating against his. To feel that he was alive and well, here with him.
“So, gentlemen, how is the situation?” he asked softly, politely as if his brother hadn’t nearly been raped the night before.
John resisted the urge to brush a curl out of Sherlock’s face. “The paramedics will be here any minute now.” Sherlock actually managed to roll his eyes, but he said nothing. They stayed like that until the paramedics arrived, with Greg hovering in the corner with the handcuffed bodyguard guy and John taking Sherlock’s pulse every few seconds because he needed to do something. The woman had stopped breathing a while ago and her corpse was lying in the middle of the room, her wide dead eyes staring at the ceiling frozen in agony. It was then that John noticed that his hands were red from her blood and that he had smeared it over Sherlock’s face and hair when he had touched him.
He let go of her hands, turned around with a dramatic sigh, and chuckled. “Oh, I just love when they are intelligent, it makes for so much more interesting cases.”
“Greg, “he said quickly, “it seems they’ve taken him into this building. The blood’s leading right up to this backdoor. We have to get in and look here.”
Jack just continued to stare at him with obvious fury and confusion on his face, but no word came out of his slightly open mouth.
, he told himself regularly. He was here to study, to learn, to get a degree and then he would be free to do whatever he wanted. He had already managed to get by through one year, two or three more years of studying would be manageable as well and then he would be finally rid of all these silly social antics a student life brought with it.
“Greg. Mycroft. To what do we owe the pleasure?” He tried to keep the irritation out of his voice but from the way both men looked at him, he had failed to accomplish that.
“Alright then, “John said with a smile as he switched the telly on and settled beside Sherlock. They found a show they watched from time to time and it had just started. Soon they were both looking intensely at the TV screen as the mysterious murderer was on the verge of killing his first victim. John settled back into the couch, careful not to touch Sherlock’s knee with his own – not that he would mind but he wanted to give Sherlock his space, he didn’t know how much physical closeness with other people was bearable to him right now.
He pulled a slack Sherlock into his lap and not too gently patted his cheek. “Sherlock! Sherlock, wake up.”
John took a step towards him and tried to keep his voice calm. “Yes, I know that, but in this case, your health is more important than your wish to go home. Look at you! You’re on the verge of collapsing, how exactly do you plan on making it to Baker Street?”
As the man stared at him with an obvious question mark on his face Sherlock realized that he was expected to tell the man his name, too. Well, he couldn’t tell him the truth, that was obvious. He just wasn’t in the mood for another fan harassing him for details about murder cases, he was too tired for that.
“How...how did you do that?” he asked, unable to decide if he should feel offended on top of being deeply impressed.
With one last furious look at John, he pulled his abandoned bag over his shoulder and stomped off. John could see him throwing a quick look over his shoulder to see if John was following him again, but he stayed put this time, knowing it would be unwise to upset the poor bloke even more.
Apparently, they had reached their destination, and although he was completely unable to make a deduction as to why he was here right now, Sherlock was able to feel terror creeping up inside him. He tried once more to move his arms and legs, to get his body to obey him, but it was futile, and his head lolled back into the soft, wet grass.
“Okay, “Greg said as he sat down in the big chair opposite the sofa. “I have to take your statement as well as Sherlock’s. Since he’s still asleep I might as well take your statement now.”
He probably needed to tell Sherlock. It was only fair. Now that he had realized this, it was almost killing him not to talk about it. He wasn’t sure what he was going to tell Sherlock, he wasn’t sure he wanted anything between them to happen. Maybe it was better just to fantasize about all of this, without ever actually doing anything?
John considered this for a moment. “Hm. Well, yes, why not. I guess you’re up for it now. Here, let me put some waterproof plaster on that shoulder first.”
“Let’s summarize, class: what are the main differences in Alpha, Beta, and Omega anatomy? Just give me a few keywords.”
“No, that’s alright, “she said with a small wave of her hand “Don’t feel bad about it. I’m used to getting overlooked a little.”
Sherlock Holmes had learned what the world was like when he was but a little, baby-faced boy and now, as an adult, he had long since learned what he had to do to survive.
John chuckled, the wonderful sound of it causing Sherlock’s heart to flutter in his chest and he huffed, surprised at the unexpected feeling of tenderness.
But Sherlock was fine with it and he dealt with them all. He had struggled a bit at the beginning of his first semester but after a few bumpy weeks of observing and learning, he had worked out what was expected of him and had adjusted accordingly. After being told over and over again that he was an arrogant, condescending git, he had found a way to tone himself down. Instead of biting out apparently hurtful comments at people who asked stupid, silly questions he only rolled his eyes now and he even forced himself to give them a simple, but precise answer and help the whole group get a good mark, not just him. He had come to accept that there were certain rules on campus and he needed to follow them if he didn’t want to put the spotlight on himself.
An honest smile spread out on her face as she lightly patted his hand. “That’s alright. I offered, and it was kind of nice to have a real chat with someone. But I promised Tom I would be home at midnight at the latest, and I wanted to go dance with my friends a little more.”
“Oh, that’s sweet of you, “she cooed. “It’s really nice of you to worry, but you don’t seem like the type of Alpha that wants to get me into trouble, right?”
“I’m sorry, “he whispered. He let his head drop until it was just over Sherlock’s uninjured shoulder, touching it. “I’m sorry I wasn’t….”
Sherlock opened his eyes and blinked at him, apparently almost seconds from passing out. He opened his mouth to speak but John put a finger on his lips and shook his head. Sherlock closed his eyes again, giving up and John ran his hand through the damp curls as they lay there, waiting for Greg and the ambulance to finally catch up with them.
He suddenly grabbed Sherlock by the hips, gripping into his flesh brutally with his fingers. It hurt and Sherlock’s body surged upwards, his eyes pressed shut in pain.  He fumbled at the hands hurting him, trying desperately to get them off. He failed and his head fell back helplessly, a strangled sob escaping his throat.
“Today, we’re going to talk about the various effects of certain toxicants and poisons,” Magnussen said, as he started his PowerPoint. “We’ll take a look at the most common toxicants, but also the lesser-known ones. It’s important that you know all of these I’m going to show you now. Almost all of these are lethal to the human body or at least affect it in a way that it will stay crippled or immobile for the rest of its existence. Let’s start.”
The ride home in Mycroft’s car was almost bearable, to Sherlock’s utmost surprise. He didn’t like being in such a confined space with his older brother, had always felt suffocated, as if he couldn’t breathe near that insufferable man he shared his blood with. He had often been forced to endure it though, as Mycroft had always had the tendency to hover near him, he always liked to know his little brother’s whereabouts and this led to him giving Sherlock a ride home more often than Sherlock liked to admit.
He knew that technically he was tired and that his body longed for him to go to sleep. But he wouldn’t because he had to look after Sherlock, so he simply resigned himself to sitting here on the bed with Sherlock all night. To distract himself from worrying he quickly got up to fetch one of his books from the living room, a medical guide on wounds and infections. It would be a good idea to freshen up his knowledge on bite wounds, especially human ones.
Instead of the usual expression of scorn and contempt his face was filled with concern. Maybe even fear.
The door shut closed and John once again ran a hand through his hair as he took a deep breath. One look at Sherlock told him still no change.
Something cold entered Sherlock’s heart, making him freeze in his motions. He stared at John, wanting desperately to say something back but he couldn’t. So he just stood there, gaping, watching as John looked at him with this frustratingly sad expression. Then he shook his head and left, only to stop and turn around once again after a few steps.
John was fully awake at once and he sat down next to his friend quickly. “Sherlock, “he called, “Sherlock, wake up!” When his friend did not react, he shook his shoulder which caused Sherlock to jolt awake as if he had been electrocuted. He looked around himself, startled like a deer in the headlights - but he relaxed the second he saw John.
“Tea and biscuits?” Lestrade laughed, not unkindly. “How old are you boys, sixty? Let’s go out and have a little drink, you know, like real men.”
Grim determination settled around the corners of his mouth as he pulled Sherlock up and into his arms, frowning when he realized once again how hot he was. Beads of sweat had collected in the back of his neck and John cradled Sherlock's head in his arms as he gently patted his cheeks, trying to rouse him again so that he would listen.
Sherlock’s eyes brightened a little, relieved that John would not immediately address the elephant in the room. “Alright. Tea would be alright. I guess. Sorry, I think I’m still a little out of it.”
“Did you just slap me?” Sherlock asked incredulously, as he righted himself up and lifted a hand to his right cheek, which felt a little hot and slightly swollen.
Sherlock till didn’t react and now John was really worried. He knew Sherlock had the tendency to really delve deep into his mind palace when he wanted to and that it sometimes took him a few seconds to react when being called to. But never had it been like this. Sherlock always came out of his mind palace when John called his name.
John stumbled forwards, stepping over the bleeding woman on the floor who was desperately pushing her hands against her throat, trying to keep the blood in her body, trying to breathe.
“They couldn’t have done it without me, naturally, “Sherlock announced afterwards, obviously not a little proud of himself.
John sighed. Both Holmes’ brothers had a hang for the dramatics, really, he sometimes felt as if he was part of a play. “I’m sorry, Mycroft. I would have called earlier but we were on a way to a crime scene.”
She stared at him, slack-jawed and wide-eyed, and he made an impatient gesture with his hand, urging her to answer.
“No, John.” Sherlock looked up and there were angry tears in his eyes, refusing to spill out of his bright blue eyes. His lips were drawn into a thin line and he was pale as a ghost. “It’s good to know where you’re standing. Really.”
Rounding the corner, his eyes frantically searching for the broad-shouldered Alpha who had already left, Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat when he spotted him, at the far end of the corridor.
Sherlock’s attacker was about to be taken to the hospital in another ambulance. He was hurt pretty badly and had to be intubated right in front of him, but John didn’t care. That monster could die for what he had done to Sherlock, he couldn’t care less.
But she brought him coffee or tea without him even needing to ask for it and she occasionally let him take a look at one of the corpses in the lab where she worked as an assistant to one of her professors, accumulating work experience for the set goal she had chosen for herself, which was to become a forensic pathologist. He wouldn’t go so far as to call the two of them friends, but they were as close as to such a thing as it could get and they were the only ones who he occasionally ate lunch or shared a cup of coffee with. He indulged them from time to time when they asked if he wanted to go the cafeteria after a seminar and although he usually ended up being bored to death by Molly’s pointless blabbering about her Alpha mate or Greg’s tedious account of his last rugby game it was a good way of interacting with his peers, allowing him to keep up with the latest news and stories - not that he was particularly interested in those things. Still, it was a necessity he didn’t dare to neglect.
“Yes, “Sherlock mumbled, and he started pacing in John’s bedroom.” There’s one thing I have to say, so please just let me say it, and then I’m out of your hair so you can catch your beauty sleep or whatever.” At John’s sharp intake of breath, Sherlock raised his right hand quickly as if to stop him from disrupting him again and continued. “I know, I know.”
It had probably to do with the fact that John hated when other people inclined that he could be gay and he and Sherlock anything else than just friends.
John chuckled and he waved the very young, scared nurse standing in the doorway with a tray in her hands, forward.
Then his face changed, his eyes narrowing as he gave John a thorough once-over. “Yes?” he asked, his tone betraying his vexation at being addressed out of the blue like this. His voice was surprisingly deep for someone looking so very young and it did
“This is only one example of many, “Magnussen was saying with a lazy smile curling around his thin lips, pulling John out of his thoughts once again. “I could show you many more examples but I think you all have gotten the point that Alphas and Betas have a much higher tolerance to toxicants and poisons, Omega bodies being much weaker and thus much more prone to illness or even death, as they simply cannot withstand the toxicants attacking their system.”
Sherlock stared pensively into his cup of tea as he blew on it, waiting for it to cool down enough for him to sip it.
“No! No, Sherlock, you’ve got it all wrong.” Sherlock’s eyes widened when he saw the agitation in John’s face and John almost cursed out loud, frustrated with himself, with his incapability to get his message through to Sherlock.
John gasped as the weight of Sherlock’s body pressed against his, as he nuzzled his face into John’s shoulder, one short stifled sob escaping his mouth.
On second thought, what he really wanted to try was sex with an Omega. He had heard lots of stories about incredible multiple orgasms. About how sharing a heat with an Omega would result in amazing, mind-blowing sex, with the participants ending up spending days in bed, tied together by a knot more often than not.
The first nurse turned an annoyed look at Sherlock, resting her hands on her hips. “Why did you do that, Sir?”
But his appearance was difficult in other ways, too. He was tall, lanky, bony. Taller than John, did that bother him? He didn’t mind. Even though John was short, he was strong and powerful, ever the capable soldier, ready to bring down any threat in a fight. He was tough, and Sherlock knew the older man could probably subdue him, even though Sherlock was taller and knew Baritsu. The sudden thought of John pushing him down to the floor, pinning his arms over his head, effectively trapping his body underneath his own caused an electrical tingling sensation to course all over his body. Once again, he was filled with shame.
Oh, they would pay for that. He would make them bleed. And he wouldn’t delegate this to one of his associates, no.
Scott’s eyes twinkled dangerously and his lips curled up into a devilish grin as he took one step forward. “Oh, we don’t know each other, but I still know a lot about you. I know you’re a rugby player, playing in the University team, possibly as a captain, but you suffered a recent shoulder injury which is why you’re considering taking it a little lighter than usual this term. You’re a textbook Alpha. You’re also very ambitious and want to do good in your studies, you want to become a good doctor and earn good money to prove yourself to the world. You’ve been drinking yesterday, not only just beer, and you’re regretting it. Not only because it affects your ability to concentrate, that is be a good, attentive student during your classes today, but because you had an alcoholic father and you don’t want to become like him. Your finances are rather lacking. You’ve been in training for the army, but left it as soon as your father died to study here.”
“Oh blimey, there are almost no seats left, thanks to you.” Mike threw John another exasperated look, getting only a helpless shrug from John in return.
Sherlock groaned, as the stream of deductions kept flowing through his mind as it was used to when presented with important data. But it was a little too much right now, as he was momentarily struggling with the seemingly infeasible task of simply opening his eyes. It hurt. As soon as he opened his eyes only a bit, stabbing pain assaulted his skull mercilessly and he was barely able to bite back another groan. His head was pounding, and his eyes had trouble focussing.
He didn’t expect a reply at this time of the night, so he put his phone on the bedside table and reclaimed his place beside Sherlock, feeling comforted by his friend’s proximity and familiar scent but also concerned by the warmth radiating from him.
At the door, the Inspector turned around again, a thoughtful look on his face. “Do you….?” He started and John looked at him questioningly. Greg cleared his voice. He seemed a little embarrassed and he hummed and hawed a little before he finally spluttered: “Do you think that this was his first time? His first time experiencing …. you know, sexual things?”
Sherlock who had just started to speak stopped and looked at John suspiciously. Then he rattled off: “You’re in a good mood today which your enthusiasm for this disgusting food proves, you’ve already devoured everything in under five minutes, so that’s quite the appetite. And this although you haven’t slept enough this night, just barely over five hours which means you had trouble falling asleep last night because I was already asleep by approximately 10 o'clock …. Which means you lay there awake, worrying about me probably. Or you were worried about the damage these horrible hospital beds would do to your back after spending the night in one of them. Apparently, you were in luck, because your back seems fine and there’s a spring in your step proving you’re feeling quite rested although the wrinkles under eyes tell me your body would like a nap today, preferably around midday, if you don’t get one you’ll get irritable in the afternoon. You liked the porridge and the toast but you found the tea hideous which you didn’t want to admit in front of me so you put on a show of liking it although I saw you wincing and scrunching up your nose, really John, do you think I’m blind?”
He shut off the water and took a step back from the sink, looking in the mirror. He simply looked awful: sallow skin, blood-shot eyes, ruffled hair. He looked lost. Suddenly his knees went weak underneath him and he grabbed the sink to steady himself. He lowered his head and took a deep breath. Slowly.
Without thinking, John rushed forward to lean over Sherlock’s restless form. “Oh, Sherlock, “he muttered as he laid his hand on the man’s hot forehead. “Oh no.” John held his hand against both of Sherlock’s clammy cheeks and found the same burning skin there.
Shocked at the words coming out of his mouth, John registered Sherlock looking at him open-mouthed, and wide-eyed and an inner voice told him to
John was a little nervous now.  “What is this, Greg?” he asked, trying not to sound too upset. “Is this really necessary? I thought I was only supposed to answer a few questions.”
“I only wanted to help you, Scott, “he continued in a much softer tone. “Maybe I’m arrogant for stepping in, maybe it was a typical Alpha thing to do, but in the end, I had good intentions. And I’m sorry, but if you cannot accept that, that is your problem.”
Admittedly, he had been quite hurt by John’s angry words at the hospital. He had felt betrayed, abandoned by the one person in the world he had counted on, his best friend and loyal partner in crime. After he had been released from the hospital, he had actually feared that their friendship was over.
“I’ll get you some paracetamol, just wait a second.” He hurried to the bathroom, grabbed the blister package of paracetamols from the bathroom cabinet from which he took two of the white pills and a glass of water. He handed them to Sherlock who downed the pills quickly in one swift motion, gratitude on his face.
John threw his hands up in the air and promptly stomped out of the living room. He stopped outside of the bathroom and leaned his arms against the wall, with his head hung down. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He was so angry, his throat felt blocked up, his hands trembling where they were clenched into fists as he pushed himself off the wall. He wanted to hit something he was so angry.
But in this case, he wasn’t dealing with facts. He was given information, true. But he didn’t know how to interpret it. Or rather, he was interpreting things but putting together all this information on John and their relationship, he was completely unable to deduce a result. It was frustrating and annoying, helplessness washed over him as he almost feverishly tried to lay down the facts.
“Careful dear!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed and she took the cup out of his hand again, scowling at him like a mother would at her insolent child. Just a second later she couldn’t help herself but smile because of Sherlock’s antics. She had missed them, John knew, life without them and their cases had to be boring for her.
She waved at the sofa and threw Sherlock a pointed look. “Take a deep breath, dear, and sit down. You just got home, no need to tell me everything in one sitting.”
John swallowed a lump down his throat as he tried to keep his face relaxed. “Yes, but it doesn’t mean you have to do everything at once. Everyone has his own pace, Sherlock, and we can take it slow. No pressure, love, alright? You decide whatever you want to do.”
“How are you feeling?” John leaned forward to feel Sherlock’s forehead. Still a bit warm. Sherlock pushed his hand away, irritated. “I’m fine, John. Stop fussing.”
He ignored everything around them and just concentrated on holding his friend. Hoping that his presence, his body warmth would provide Sherlock with some much-needed comfort. It seemed to help a least a little because Sherlock’s breathing calmed down considerably, and his crying turned from desperate sobs to quiet intermittent hitches in his breathing.
Around three in the morning he finally noticed his bloody knuckles. Ah yes, he had totally forgotten he had beaten up that… monster. His hand actually hurt a little bit, but he didn’t regret doing it, not at least one bit. This human piece of filth completely deserved being smashed to bloody pieces and more for what he had done to his best friend. How could anyone do that to another person? How could anyone drug somebody to make them bend to their perverted desires? Did they like having someone beneath them completely helpless, crying, trembling? How fucked-up could people be?
Greg had called reinforcements and while they were waiting for his colleagues, he tried to calm his friend down but to no avail. John was furious. With himself for neglecting to realize something had been wrong with Sherlock. With Sherlock for getting himself into that kind of situation again. With the unknown kidnapper that he had chosen Sherlock as his target. Damn, being famous only had disadvantages for Sherlock, they shouldn’t have made a media spectacle out of themselves, then they wouldn’t be in the situation they were now in.
Disappointment settled deep within him, replacing the anger and he sighed in resignation as he dared a look at Scott in front of him after all. The pale student was completely focused on Magnussen and his presentation and if he was aware of John’s look at him he did not let it show on his face. He furrowed his eyebrows as he frowned at something Magnussen was saying and his rosy lips were slightly parted as he repeatedly tapped a pencil against his jaw. He looked downright edible and John swallowed as he averted his eyes.
“Yes, Dr. Watson speaking. Alright, okay, as I thought. How much? Ah, okay… Well, thanks for letting me know. Bye.”
Exams are finally over, whew  :) Somehow, this turned out a lot longer than I thought. On another note, this story is more and more turning from "Strangers to lovers" into "Enemies to lovers"... What do you think? I really hoped you enjoyed reading the new chapter. Ah yes, and Merry Christmas :)!
He thought of the night at the swimming pool and the panicked way in which Sherlock had ripped the Semtex vest off of John. The tension in his lanky body as he paced up and down, scratching his head nervously with the loaded gun. The shaky way the air had left his lungs after the danger had supposedly evaporated and the way they had looked at each other and giggled. Just for a second until Moriarty had come back.
Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Or rather a knock at the door frame because Mrs. Hudson hadn’t closed the door behind them. They both looked up in surprise and saw Mycroft Holmes standing there, looking neat in his impeccable suit and tie, as usual, umbrella in his right hand. Greg looked at his watch and nodded in appreciation.
The next few days went a little better. He told himself to pull himself together and pay attention if he wanted to get a good start on this semester’s courses and so he did. He diligently took notes of what he had to do in order to pass the courses. He signed up for a few presentations and essays and he even agreed to take part in a study group for one of the more difficult anatomy courses he had to pass this semester.
But he knew it would be a mistake. Sherlock was incredibly fragile right now and to leave him here like that would be terribly wrong.
Magnussen continued to question other students, occasionally throwing someone out, other times praising someone for giving the correct answer. One of the boastful Alphas John had noticed before, the one with the unruly blond hair, answered a particularly hard question and Magnussen nodded his head in what seemed genuine appreciation.
He reached for the door, aiming to get out as quickly as possible, when suddenly there was a hand on his knee, stopping his movement. He looked up in surprise and his eyes widened when he saw his brother’s cool blue eyes boring into him, imploring him to listen.
Sorry for hurting Sherlock again, I guess ... I can't seem to stop putting him in dangerous situations.
He bolted inside and stood still as he took in the picture in front of him: there lay Sherlock on his back, clad in one old T-shirt and loose sweatpants, the sheets kicked to the floor beside the bed. He was muttering in his sleep, sweat glistening on his forehead as he tossed from right to left, his hands curled helplessly into the fitted sheet beneath him.
“Answer me!” Billy yelled suddenly, and Sherlock winced at the sudden loud noise so close to his ear but already his usual mask of arrogant condescendence settled on his face, and he opened his mouth with a sneer.
“I’m John, “he said spontaneously and snickered at once when he realized he had used his friend’s name by accident in order to hide his personality. He had to tell John later, he’d find that funny, too.
“You too, “he had answered and they had shared one last kiss - open-mouthed but without tongues - before parting ways in a friendly manner, promising to always keep each other up to speed. Mary would go back to London to resume her training as a nurse whereas John would return to Durham where he studied medicine.
John smiled as he spat the toothpaste back into the sink and rinsed his mouth. He had always wanted to be a doctor and he was on his good way to becoming one. He had already successfully completed a third of his studies now and he would not let anything get in the way of getting his degree.
“Alright, students, let’s begin, “Magnussen announced, as he pushed himself off the wall, clapping into his hands to get everyone’s attention.
Sherlock did not wake, he only sighed in his sleep, pressing his nose into the hollow of John’s throat, his arm a light, possessive weight around John’s waist.
The nurse began her examination and Sherlock grimaced his way through it. He let her turn and prod him without complaint. She took a few hairs from his head as well as a few swabs from every part of his body where he had been bruised, scratched or bitten. She took a few swabs from the bite wound which caused Sherlock to bite his lower lip in pain although no sound escaped him.
Sherlock scowled and didn’t say anything, but he seemed to accept that statement, much to John’s relief.
It was hard. Everything within him screamed at him to stop and take the opportunity to talk to Scott again. But he didn’t.
“What changes in serum enzyme levels are indicative of acute hepatocellular injury?” he asked, in an almost gentle, soothing voice.
But in this memory...this beautiful dream, Sherlock wasn’t stupid. He didn’t say that he was married to his work.
He hopped off the bed, grabbed his clothes and after another heated glare at all of them, he disappeared into the bathroom to get dressed. They all let out a collective sigh and looked at each other tentatively. Greg spoke first.
“You said to wait for me and that you wanted to examine me once more. So, let’s get this done quickly, “Sherlock said with resolution in his voice.
This was no way to go about this. He could drive himself crazy, asking himself all these questions, obsess over his appearance, over John’s preferences, and his own insecurities. But it didn’t give him any concrete answers.
John leaned forward and nudged his friend in the side playfully. “Come on, oh master detective, allow yourself some fun for a change, hm?”
John shook his head. “No, it’s fine, don’t worry. Thanks for your help.” He nodded at the man again and ran towards the exit, Greg right behind him.
“Don’t go, “John whispered, leaning forward, chasing after that sweet, sweet mouth and Sherlock obeyed. Their lips re-connected eagerly, a shy clumsy brushing of mouths, panting breaths of air exchanged between them, as they parted and met again and again, their hands still clinging to each other faces as if clinging to each other’s sanities.
Greg looked at him surprised. “Alright, yes, of course, no problem.” He sat down on the sofa and got out his notebook. John also sat down, ready to intervene if anything unpleasant happened. But this was not very probably as this was Greg and not Mycroft, this would be much easier, at least he hoped so.
“Goodness, John, you’re falling asleep in your shoes, “Mrs. Hudson exclaimed suddenly, and she got up to pull at John’s jacket which he still hadn’t taken off. “Please, you can tell me the rest of your story tomorrow, please go to bed now, you must be exhausted from your travels.” She was of course right and suddenly John was excited at the thought of lying down in his own comfortable bed instead of a foreign albeit cosy one.
The door opened hesitantly, and Sherlock peeked his head around the corner. “John?” When he saw John waiting for him sitting on his bed he stepped inside and stood there, looking a little bashful.
John shrugged. “Broke his nose, gave him a concussion. It doesn’t matter. The bastard had it coming.”
“You know how your brother is, Sherlock. He wouldn’t have budged. And I think he’s right, for that matter.” Sherlock glared at him and John added quickly “Please, let’s not start arguing again, alright? You can discuss it with Mycroft, he’s the one bringing the nurse.”
“Of course. Thank you.” John nodded politely, but internally he bristled at her cool demeanour. It didn’t seem to faze her at all to speak of possible dangerous infections Sherlock might have caught when he was right next to her.
The thought of doing this made him feel nauseous, his refreshed legs already starting to weaken again.
John bit his lip nervously and shoved some people aside to finally reach the pub’s exit. He looked around but he couldn’t see his friend. He then made his way to the side and down the stairs where he knew the restroom was. The men’s room was completely empty, he checked every stall. They then proceeded to (very quickly) check the women’s restroom – with Sherlock, you never knew. But it was empty too apart from one girl refreshing her lipstick in front of the mirror. At her indignant look at the two men, he apologized quickly and asked if she had seen a tall, lanky man with curly brown hair and high cheekbones. Unfortunately, she hadn’t.
“She was about to kill Sherlock! Greg here can attest to that!” John was flailing his arms around helplessly, completely unable to comprehend what was happening.
John groaned even louder, and he raised his head, banging it back into the pillow dramatically, causing his roommate to chuckle good-naturedly.
They had grown up together, living in the same neighbourhood, and spent their free time in the woods, at the lake, riding their bikes, climbing trees, sneaking out of their homes to go on night walks on the hills. They had sat side by side at school every day and at some point when they were teenagers they had just snuck out at break time to go snog behind the gym. There had been no romantic exchanging of love confessions. It had just happened, simple as that. They had been together from that day on and no one around them had been surprised.
He thought of the day they had met and how Sherlock’s eyes had lit up when John had praised him for his deduction in the cab, calling him “amazing” and “extraordinary”. The way Sherlock’s eyes had widened later that day, impeccable deductions stuttering to a halt when he had seen John standing behind the red tape and realized it was him that had shot the cabbie. His proud and somewhat amazed grin when he had told him to wash his hands so as to get rid of the powder gun on his fingers.
Sherlock’s heart was beating in his throat as he raised his head, on the verge of shuffling closer to John. But before he could do that, John had already moved next to him, pushing against him so that Sherlock’s head rested on his shoulder.
After this friendly little introduction, Professor Magnussen proceeded to explain this semester’s workload to the students. It turned out to be very very much and John noticed several students frowning as they looked at the Power Point presentation with the list of various assignments they had to do in order to pass the class. He suspected that many of them were probably considering switching to another course if they could, hopefully with a kinder professor during this term, or maybe next semester if possible.
“Good to know the police is as skilled as the criminals they’re supposed to catch.” Greg looked up to see John grinning at him.
“Out! Out with you!” Magnussen jerked his head towards the door and the lad stifled a sob as he grabbed his bag, almost falling over his feet as he hurried towards the exit. Everybody stared at Magnussen in horror, including John and Mike, and John knew without a doubt that there would definitely be a lot fewer people present next class.
After he had gotten two new vodka tonics he started walking back to the couch where he and Tonya had sat when he saw Greg standing at the side, talking to a few people he didn’t know and he went over to them on a whim.
“I’ve got you, love, “he whispered almost inaudibly into the crook of Sherlock’s shoulder and tears welled up in his eyes as Sherlock raised his head to look at him with weary eyes, something of a surprise in them and maybe something else, John couldn’t tell.
He looked from John to Sherlock and back to John expectantly. They looked at each other and hesitated.
He was glad the case was over, and they hoped they could have some peace and quiet now, at least for a while. Just a few boring little cases maybe for a change. Well, maybe not because boring cases meant a frustrated Sherlock and that meant bullets in Mrs. Hudson’s wallpaper and even crazier experiments in the fridge.
Magnussen looked at the Beta again, this time looking more annoyed than surprised. “Yes, Mr. Williams, you have another question?”
“What happened? How did you manage to get yourself into that kind of situation again? I hate to ask, but I need your statement again, you know how it is.”
“You killed a woman. It’s not a small matter. I’m sorry but I have to insist that you come with me after this visit.”
He saw Mike glance at him curiously, looking slightly puzzled. Even though the olfactory senses of Betas were not as keen as those of the other two genders, his friend could probably nevertheless smell what must be an embarrassing mixture of awe, excitement, and lust. Christ, he was probably reeking.
“N-no, “he whispered frantically, “d-don’ wanthis.” His voice was hoarse and pitifully weak. It didn’t sound like him at all.
“I mean it, John. I feel quite good. Still a little tired, howsoever that’s possible. My shoulder is still throbbing a bit, but that’s all. My headache’s gone. I feel fresh and clean and I have eaten my fill. So, really, John, I mean it.”
Before he could regain his countenance, however, the hand was gone, and Mycroft had stepped out of the car.
It had been one of the very rare times Mycroft had shown him open affection, something which nowadays would be out of the question, naturally. It did make sense. Mycroft had been the one who had taught him that caring was dangerous and would only bring you pain.
He laid down on the ground on his side, curling into himself, and lost himself in the familiar feeling of dread and emptiness. It washed over him almost tenderly, like ripples in a river and he felt his muscles losing their stiffness as he allowed himself to be engulfed by the sensation.
He cringed when he thought of the compassion in John’s eyes and the conversation they had the night after the first assault.
He quickly washed his face again and brushed his teeth. Then he took a quick shower, thankful to wash off the sterile hospital smell he hated so much, but it wasn’t easy. His skull pounded like hell, the bite mark on his shoulder felt sore and he still felt shaky after throwing up. His whole body was yearning for rest.
“Oh yes, I did. Mr. Holmes gave me a file with interesting details about cases Mr. Holmes had solved. About things he might find interesting, scientific articles, stuff like that, you know. But he didn’t seem interested at all. Then, suddenly, mid-sentence, I realized his eyes were closed, so I knew he was back in his mind thingy again. He hasn’t moved since then and that’s been …. “ Frederic looked at his watch, “four hours ago.”
The room was silent except for the clicks Mrs. Wilkins’ camera made as she began to catalogue Sherlock’s body. She photographed literally everything, every mark, every bruise, everywhere. Politely she asked Sherlock to move into this position or raise his arm that way. Sherlock acquiesced to her requests without a fuss, although a sullen expression remained on his face the whole time.
On the other hand, if he never said anything, things would stay blurry and unaddressed between them and he wasn’t sure he could stomach that. Besides, he sensed that John was on the verge of addressing the tension between them, too, so he was not the only one noticing things. Of course, a lot had happened these past few days. Sherlock’s abuse at the hands of not one but two different perpetrators could very well be the reason behind John’s need to talk and Sherlock had no way of knowing if there was maybe something else John wanted to address. Something that involved him and Sherlock having romantic feelings for each other.
