Dean grins widely at Cas. "It's a date, then."
,” Castiel growls in a demanding tone that goes straight to Dean's dick. "Don't try to weasel your way out of this. I know you've seen my movies, and let me assure you, the real thing is much better than anything you could see on screen." He smirks. That bastard. "Now, take me to your place, because I would very much like to lay you out like a buffet and have my way with you."
Cas’ eyes brighten with a smile of his own. “Supper sounds perfect. It will give us time before I fuck you back into this mattress.”
“Uhh…” comes intelligently from his lips. “You--”
Instantly it's almost too much, it's so good, the stimulation, and the video, and the size, and he groans, shutting his eyes for a second and writhing on the already twisted sheets and blankets of his bed. As much as Dean wants to stretch out the session, it's getting too much for him to hold back an orgasm for much longer. He hasn't been able to have this for a while, he's been so damn busy at the auto-shop, understaffed and overworked. He's so
Without answering, Cas spreads open his ass and without hesitation, dives right fucking
With that thought in mind, he absently searches the bed for the vibrator he kept aside for this purpose, not wanting to miss even a second of the video. Thick and long, it is the closest toy he has to Angel's cock in size.
Cas stands up, and Dean hears the rustling of clothes behind him - probably Cas
His breaths start to come in small pants as he softly touches the chest he's seen on his laptop so many times. He moves his hands across that firm,
Cas raises an eyebrow that makes Dean want to fall to his knees. He says something -he’s pretty sure, but the words don't seem to make the trip to Dean's brain. His knees suddenly seem to be having trouble supporting his own damn weight. “I, uh… What-What was that?”
“Have you…” he trails off, eyes lighting up and lips curling into a smile that Dean actually thinks might kill him. “You've seen my productions, haven't you.
"I, yeah, good thing you did, turn her on - start her engine - let me hear what noises she's making. Let's figure out what ails the Lady." Dean thankfully doesn't stumble over his words, slipping into Mechanic Mode, for the time being. Although it doesn't last long because Cas has to step almost into Dean's personal space to look over his shoulder after he starts her up.
“Yes. A date.”
Panting for a few moments, Cas makes an agreeing sound. “That was… I don't have words.”
“I-I-I--” Dean starts, eyes going anywhere but Cas’ face. “It's just a-a term of--” he tries.
"Oh fu-uh-ck!" Dean groans at the vibrations of the toy against his extremely sensitive prostate. At this point, he knows that it'll take him only a few more well timed thrusts to cum all over the bed.
He covers it in lube so it's nice and slick and then lines the head up with his stretched hole, arm contorted behind him, feeling that familiar ache in his shoulder that's always worth it. He pushes it into himself slowly, moaning into his other fist, knuckles between his teeth, as it stretches him. He has to breathe for a minute to adjust, watching Angel on his screen as the last man cums white in his hair and another takes his place at his lips.
A small smile spreads on the fat pink lips he's seen wrapped around a dozen different dicks (Now is
the time to think about how those lips would look wrapped around his own dick). “It is! Castiel is an angel’s name. My parents were very religious. A proclivity I don't share, but I use the name for my own… purposes.”
She's an old 1978 Lincoln Continental that seems to be in pretty good shape when he opens her up. Clean, with newer parts replacing the ones that simply got too old, the old parts seemingly tenderly cared for. “I try to take care of her.” Castiel is so close, Dean can actually feel his breath on his neck. It has goosebumps spreading down his skin, and he tries very hard not to flinch. “Clean her, change the oil regularly…”
… How does anyone expect Dean to hold a conversation when all he can think about is how much he wants to get fucked by this man? How he’s literally freaking fantasized about it for months. How can he function when all he sees are those eyes looking at him when he's seen them pupil-blown and satisfied?
“I can see that,” he replies with a smile. “Might be a belt broke. I just, uh, have to look under your-her- hood.”
chest, and rubs his thumbs over Cas' nipples.
- need to feel you."
It takes him longer than usual to will his tired body up, and he decides that taking a shower is too much work right now. He just wipes off the cum and washes his face before heading back to bed, tired, sore, and sated in the best possible way. At least he's not sexually frustrated anymore and won't shout at his poor colleagues over the tiniest of things when he has to wake up tomorrow and go back to work.
at the feeling. A small part of Dean's brain knows that he could jerk himself off right now, God knows he will in the future, but his brain isn't working enough for him to actually move his hands from where they are apparently buried in Cas' hair behind him.
Did he just die? Is this heaven? This surely can't be his favorite pornstar standing in front of him. The-best-orgasm-of-his-life-pornstar. Fuck. Unable to Compute given data. Error: 404. File not found.
"Dean Winchester," Angel says slowly, testing out the name. "Hello, I'm Castiel."
Dean opens his eyes - that he hadn't realized he closed - just in time to see Cas' face slip into a blissful expression as he empties himself into the condom with a groan that sounds a lot like
Dean turns around as fast as his feet would allow him and leans in to kiss Cas, twining an arm around his neck to pull him in and keep him close. Without breaking the kiss, Cas lifts Dean's legs and wraps them around his waist, pinning Dean against the wall with just the strength of his chest, and pushes his cock back into Dean's hole; where, according to Dean, it belongs forever.
, Cas?”
“I mean, he texted back once or twice but it wasn’t really.... It was like he was suddenly the lame ‘I am an angel of the Lord’ Castiel again.” She accompanied her words with robot arms, and it should have been amusing, but it really wasn’t. “It was weird. Bad weird, not the good weird he usually is. And if you tell him I called him a good weird I’ll kill you.”
“Why would you think something happened to him?”
“Among other things, yes. In the beginning, there was no need for our roles to be so inflexible. Humanity was much smaller then, much more fragmented. Did you know your species was on the brink of extinction at one point?” The first hint of emotion showed in Ramiel’s expression, a bit of amusement with the scholarly dispassion. “How strange it seems now, given how widely you have spread.”
Cas swayed a bit, but remained firmly human-looking. “It’s… requiring more effort than I had anticipated, taking us both here.”
It’s so stupid, how Sam can feel his cheeks heating up, but he can also feel a real, honest-to-God (and okay, there’s a bunch of phrases that are going to feel weird for a good while) smile growing, too, and he ducks his head. It’s happiness, he thinks, and it’s as unfamiliar and terrifying as it is exciting. There’s still so much to deal with – starting with the fact that he doesn’t even know what his ‘happy ending’ looks like, only that, yeah, okay, starting it out with Eileen is as good an idea as any – but for once, maybe he can look at the unknown as a good thing instead of looking for ways it might come back to bite him in the ass. Maybe he can let himself be happy. Huh. The urge to fight back his smile is still there, but he scratches his jaw and forces himself to let it be. When he looks back up, he half-expects Dean to tease him, but the smile on his brother’s face is genuine, if a little tired.
So, yeah, Dean Winchester’s life isn’t a love story. But maybe he can have his happy ending anyway.
But Dean Winchester is not in a love story. Dean Winchester is a fucking coward, who’s far too familiar with watching the people he loves nearly die. He’s far too familiar with the sickening rush of adrenaline and relief from near-death experiences. And he’s far too unfamiliar with actually saying the things he’s feeling.
For as long as they’ve known Cas, he’s been so full of guilt. He’s been forced to make difficult choice after difficult choice, and it’s led to a lot of pain, and a lot of destruction up in Heaven. He’s actively torn down his home, killed fellow angel after fellow angel in the name of free will and doing the right thing. For him to now have the chance to go up and fix it? To take the time he’s spent on Earth, the understanding and love and appreciation he’s come to have for people, the absolutely unique point of view he’s had as being both an angel and one of humanity’s staunchest defenders, and pour it into Heaven? To make paradise as it should have been, in the way that even their former God failed to do? To stand beside Jack, who he’d defended from the first, who he’d passed on all his lessons of hope and compassion to? Yeah, Cas is the

get it, okay? You got to do your big speech, but you didn’t give me time to say a damn word.”
“What the hell does that have -- ”
about this. Cas has never spoken of humanity with anything less than affection -- curious, at first, as though he couldn't understand
Dean wished he could feel as damn certain as Sam sounded. He couldn’t see this bright future Sam had envisioned, only the creeping darkness. “Ramiel did have an idea about the Mark.”
Sam didn’t miss a beat. “Shut up,” he said, letting them shoulder past him into the doorway. The moment the door closed behind them, he turned, grinning like a maniac. “I think I found it.”
“She was just doing what she thought was best, Dean.”
There’s this thing that Cas has become good at: he’ll find someplace to sit, usually at the kitchen table or in one of the chairs in the war room, crack open a book or something with a mug of coffee or tea, and just… exude this aura of indifference. He somehow manages to make his disapproval of whatever it is Dean’s done recently very clear without doing a damn thing. It’d be impressive if it wasn’t so annoyingly efficient. So when Dean shuffles into the brightly-lit kitchen to find Cas in the corner with a book and a mug of spicy-smelling tea, he just sighs and heads over to the coffee machine.
. He didn’t feel anything besides the pain from his forearm. No clawing aggression, no disconnect, no emptiness digging its way out of his chest. “I think it worked, Sammy,” he said, and was astonished by the immediate onslaught of feeling that sentence brought. Guilt and horror and regret crashed upon him like a tsunami, filling the holes in him in waves. Damn, it felt like it’d been years since he’d
Dean can’t help feeling as if he missed a step somewhere. “Uh, yeah?” He figured Cas would hem and haw a little bit but then accept the apology and they’d move on, but for whatever reason, it’s very clearly not what Cas wanted at all.
“Damn right I’m angry with you.”
Dean wanted to laugh at the mental image of how Cas would have (should have) reacted to that, but he couldn’t. It was clear from Claire’s expression that she thought something was really, truly wrong.
Cas’s face scrunched up in confusion for a moment, then cleared as understanding dawned. “The Axis Mundi?” he corrected. Dean didn’t miss the hints of amusement his voice held.
Once Dean’s peeled himself away from Cas, Sam goes in for a hug, too, and doesn’t miss how tired and shaky Cas’s smile looks. “Glad you’re back, man,” he says, words barely making it out through the lump in his throat.
Wait, what? Sam can’t help himself. “No clue about
He hadn’t got his hopes up -- truly, he hadn’t -- but yeah, there had been just a tiny part of him that had been expecting something more promising than ‘I maybe found an angel who maybe knows something about the Mark.’
things are making so much sense in ways that are both wonderful and awful in hindsight – but for now Sam just finds himself smiling, so full of hope and, for the first time, not looking for the other shoe.
Jack stumbles out, grin so bright Sam’s not sure he’s not actually glowing. Cas looks a little worse for wear as he staggers out too. His trench coat is dirty and creased, the bags under his eyes are deeper than usual, and he looks as exhausted as Sam’s felt the past few days, but he’s
Dean’s in peak obnoxious big brother mode when he just shakes his head and waggles his eyebrows. “You’ll figure it out. Maybe. Eventually. Come on, Cas.” He holds his hand out.
Being talked about like he’s not in the room is annoying as hell, and while it’s not enough to puncture the contentment Sam feels at how things have turned out, it’s still enough to make him scowl a bit. “Mind filling me in?”
got him back, because this is the first time they’ve had the chance to just be, all three of them, it… makes sense? The thought of losing both Cas and Jack at once, in only seeing them in small snatches here and there when they can pull themselves away from their work up in Heaven
It was clear that it wasn’t Dean she wanted to say this to, but if Cas was being radio silent, he’d listen for him. It wasn’t his place to tell her that he was happy for her, that he hoped she was happy here, that she deserved some peace and stability, or all the things he imagined Cas would say. Instead, he just smiled. “Jody and Alex are good people.”
of you.”
, Dean thought savagely. “I’m not laughing.”
Dean wishes he could be irritated with how genuinely taken aback Cas is, but the worst part is he can’t really blame him. “Yeah,” he says, and scrubs a hand down his face.  “Look, you just… I’m still not used to you being, y’know, breakable. So when you pull stupid shit like that -- and I’m not saying that it wasn’t necessary,” he adds, seeing how Cas’s face immediately shuts down. “Hell, maybe it was. But it just… it freaks me out, man. So, yeah, I was kind of a dick. Sorry.”
Sam picked up on the second ring. Dean barely had time to take a breath before Sam started in on him. “Dean! How’s it going? You meet Ramiel yet? Did you find anything?”
“You could end this,” he spat. His whole arm was raw, the Mark throbbing in time to his rocketing heartbeat. “Right now. Hell, I basically
Sam… isn’t really surprised. Hell, Dean’s said as much too many times to count: for all his life, he’s figured, almost anticipated that his ending would come at the end of a barrel of a gun, or a vamp fang, or a knife, or anything else bloody and violent and cruel. Sam had been the one to cling to things, to project his hopes and wishes on anyone or anything who’d stand still long enough for him to run to. Stanford, Jess, Ruby, Amelia. Dean’s almost embraced the nihilism, as if he can’t stand to be disappointed by allowing himself to hope for anything more. It’s awful, and sad, and so predictable that Sam already knows what the next words are going to be: something about Sam’s happy ending being Dean’s happy ending that’d almost be sweet if it wasn’t so
“Yeah,” Dean said flatly, the word feeling sour in his mouth as he instantly recalled the disastrous year they’d learned that for themselves. He refused to look Cas’s way. “I’ve heard.”
Dean laughs again, but it feels more real this time, even – especially, maybe – with the sad edge it has to it. “See?” he says, but he’s looking only at Cas, and this time, Cas isn’t looking away. “Shit, I flat-out told him you were my happy ending and he just nodded and went, ‘yeah, you have time to figure it out’ --” and, okay, Sam does
“Dean.” Cas’s voice sliced through the blood pounding in his ears. Before Dean could process what was happening, Cas closed what little distance there was left between them and brought a palm up to cup Dean’s cheek, his hand big and warm and grounding. It was hard to breathe through the desire and terror that seized his heart at the sweep of a thumb against his cheekbone. The pad of Cas’s thumb briefly caught on his skin, stuttering in its path and sending Dean’s heartbeat reeling. “I regret many things,” Cas said, and Dean could feel the exhale on his words in the scant distance between them. “But no matter how this turns out, doing all I can to help you will never be one of them.”
It’s not fair to attribute everything to Chuck. All of their successes, all of their failures, all of their growth. No matter what the artist formerly known as God threw their way, it was still theirs to deal with, theirs to live. But maybe there’s something to that after all, and maybe none of their adult lives were
The noise that’s dragged out of Cas’s throat is new, something strangled and indignant and despairing all at once, and Sam’s not sure whether to laugh or be alarmed. From the wide-eyed look Jack gives him across the table, it looks like he’s just as much at a loss here. “
The cherry on top was that Cas had the gall to actually sound confused. “You won’t save yourself. You won’t take me out. We’re just spinning our wheels. There’s no way this won’t end badly. You’ll burn out or blow up or whatever, I’ll still have this damn Mark and turn into a demon, and Sam won’t have anyone to help take me out.”
The sun had set by the time Cas directed them off the interstate and onto some county road. Of all the places Dean would have imagined a portal up to Heaven being, the pretty generic playground Cas led them to would not have been one of them. “The stairway to Heaven is through some monkey bars?” he asked skeptically as they pulled in, surveying the scene before them. It was almost fully dark by now, the meager light casting tall shadows that made it look more like a set to some C grade horror movie than any holy portal or whatever.
Dean couldn’t tell if the coolness seeping through him was disappointment or relief.
No. He tears his eyes away and stubbornly grasps at the small bits of irritation that remain.
“Yeah, well,” Dean says, sipping at his coffee, and he looks so damn
Five minutes later, all three of them were seated around the table in the library, holding huge, steaming cups of coffee. “Okay,” Dean said once he’d taken a few long swigs from his mug. “Lay it on us.”
“A sandbox,” Cas amended. The moment the car turned off, he was out, wasting no time in striding over to the enormous sandbox. He grabbed a stick and began drawing an elaborate design as Dean walked closer. With a few murmured words of Enochian, the marks in the sand began to glow, the white growing steadily brighter before Dean’s eyes. He was grateful for the arm Cas stretched out to him; he couldn’t see a damn thing, near-blind from the sudden intensity of the light and the swirls of pearly mist enveloping the darkness, and he could only follow helplessly when Cas tugged him forward.
It wasn’t, and given how Cas suddenly refused to meet his gaze, Dean knew Cas hadn’t forgotten what he’d asked of him last time they met, but like hell was he going to bring it up in front of Sam. “Fine,” he said. He knew which battles to pick. He knew, deep in his bones, that this trip would be a waste of time and energy, but it’d give Sam at least a day or two off from hovering and worrying, and it’d give him time to talk Cas into doing what needed to be done. “When do we leave?”
Now Dean looks up, something close to confusion on his face. And that’s even sadder than Sam gave him credit for. Is the idea of a happy ending that much beyond comprehension?
For what feels like the first time all night, Cas looks up and directly at Dean. There’s something just as broken, just as desperate in his expression, and it makes the small smile on his face look wrong. “I’m needed there.”
“Me.” If Cas had looked tired before, he looked exhausted now, his face grey and his body wobbling with every step. He flickered again, and Dean could just make out a series of colors hidden in the white before he was human-shaped again, looking as though he was about to keel over. “I’m having difficulty keeping my form up.”
“Have I done something, then?” He still sounds confused, but less so, like he’s starting to suspect there’s more to it than Dean just being frustrated with something he did.
She hesitated, then carefully set the plate and towel both down. “Has something happened to Castiel?”
Part of him had expected Cas to refuse, to fight it, to offer vague platitudes of how this was going to work or how there was always hope. That he instead accepted so readily was as alarming as it was gratifying. “Thank you.”
Ramiel smiled, clearly pleased that one of them had got the picture. “Yes. I believe that corrupting the Mark’s form may break its hold.”
“I meant for you. Would it work, getting rid of your Grace like that?”
The fistful of cotton relaxes as Cas sighs and droops, like all the fight goes out of him at once. Except, no, that isn’t quite right, Dean realizes, it’s more like he’s accepted the loss of one battle and is steeling up for another. “I believed, or rather hoped,” Cas says, the words deliberate and weary, “that we were finally going to discuss what’s been going on the past few weeks. But I… it’s fine, Dean. Thank you for the apology, even if it wasn’t necessary.”
Dean’s suddenly so, so grateful that Mary’s made a point of saying those words to him more often recently. It’s not the same thing, at
“You’re needed here!”
. They’ve never had to do this, just exist, and most days it feels more like they’re on the brink of a war than peace. It’s sure as hell not what he’d desperately, shamefully hoped for when Cas had shown up at the front door, tired and bedraggled and
It was the closest they’d come to hearing anything close to a cure, and for a moment, Dean couldn’t move, paralyzed with relief and reluctant hope. “How?”
“Are you saying,” Cas said slowly, “that the same holds true for the Mark?”
“I believe so, yes.”
It wasn’t much. It was barely enough to justify the trip up here, and it certainly wasn’t the cure-all Sam and Cas had been hoping for. Dean felt numb, the little optimism he’d managed to summon up deflating at yet another dead end. But Cas stepped forward and grasped Ramiel’s hands in his, beaming. “Thank you, brother. Truly.”
The drive back to the bunker is tense and pissy, and by the time they roll in at nearly midnight, Dean’s jaw and knuckles are both sore from clenching them. They don’t say a word as they head in and to their separate rooms, and it isn’t until Dean’s door has shut behind him that he feels the tension leaving him in one long, drawn-out exhale.
It was Cas. Dean watched, half-fascinated, half-horrified as Cas flickered in and out, a tall, unbearably bright amalgamation of light taking the place of his body. “Dean,” the thing --
been easy for Dean, but he gives it all he has. Cas must see something on his face, for his surprise softens into something a bit more understanding. He steps away for a moment -- and Dean’s pulse spikes, because Christ if he leaves just as he’s finally starting to work the nerve up --but only places his mug on the counter and takes another from the cupboard. Dean just watches as Cas takes it to the coffee machine. Dean had been too absorbed to even notice it’d finished brewing, but Cas fills the mug and, without asking, adds two heaping teaspoons of sugar, just the way Dean likes it when he actually takes the time to enjoy it. He holds it out to Dean like a peace offering, and it’s that small, innocuous gesture that breaks the dam. “I’m not used to having you here all the time,” he blurts out.
She kept her eyes down, focusing on rubbing the already-dry plate, but when he didn’t turn back to the dishes, she folded. “It’s just. Ever since he broke me out of the group home, he’s been trying to like, I don’t know, be my friend or weird replacement pseudo-dad or something. Way too hard, most of the time.” She gave him a wry smile, but it looked forced. “I’m sure you’ve noticed, but he’s kinda a doof.” It had been almost a year since Dean had last seen her. She was nearly nineteen, but whether it was the more muted makeup, the pigtails she wore her hair in, or the glimmers of fear in her eyes, she somehow looked far younger now. “Anyway, he’d like, send me all these stupid texts, talking about a bird he’d seen that day or some stupid cat video, or just a fu- freaking string of emojis.” She snorted. “It was kinda annoying, you know? But then a few weeks ago he just... stopped. I sent him a couple texts just to tell him I was alive and to tease him about dropping the ball. That since he stopped texting me maybe I’d go out and try to rob another store and it’d be all his fault for not entertaining me with YouTube or whatever.”

Sam’s brain stalls for a moment, then goes through a reboot, and it clicks. It. Wait,
There’s… something about the way Cas grins, something about how they’re both looking at each other with – are those
“It’s Claire’s birthday.” The answer is so befuddling that Dean just ends up staring for a good thirty seconds. “I’ll only be a few minutes,” he adds, and the set of his jaw tells Dean that there’ll be no talking him out of this.
Her voice wavered almost imperceptibly when she said it, though.
Yeah, that’s reassuring. He’s not exactly chomping at the bit to get back to Sam and Claire, but he doesn’t really want to spend the next three hours in here watching as Cas lolls from one end of the store to the other, either. “Cas, man, come on. Are you sure even getting her a gift is a good idea?” He’s tempted to bring up the whole ‘you’re not her dad,’ thing again, for all the good it’ll do.
“Yeah, well, before you, uh, gave his soul a once-over,” here both Dean and Cas winced at the reminder, “you said that a claim on someone’s soul left a mark.”
“She's beautiful,” Cas says once they get there, grazing his hand on the dashboard and admiring the leather of Baby's seats when he slides in beside him, the bulge in his pants lewd and fucking tempting. “I would love to have sex in this car someday.” He says it like an off-handed comment, but Dean’s mind practically blacks out at the thought of getting to see Cas more than once. Pictures Cas pushing him down on the soft leather, the space too little for two grown men, as they rock and grind and - shit. He shouldn't find the image of his and Cas’ cum streaked white on the dark seats as hot as he does.
“‘Angel?’” Castiel purrs, his voice so guttural Dean can feel the vibrations along his skin. “You just called me-”
- not even giving him a moment to catch his breath. Fucking him full and making him yell, his cock trapped between his own stomach and Cas’ clothes, slick and silky, pressing him into the matress.
"Of course," Cas says with a genuine smile. "I do what I can for her but I'm not a mechanic. My hands can do a lot but taking care of her the way she deserves is not really on the list." He says with a smirk, almost as if he knows what effect his words are having on Dean and his poor dick.
Dean thinks, shivering with arousal as his cock gives a twitch, and he pushes his ass out a little farther.
if this continues, he won't last much longer.
He's so lost in his thoughts, though, that he misses Cas returning and is startled when he feels Cas' warm mouth against his cheek, teeth biting into his ass hard enough to break the skin and leave a mark that will take days to heal, reminding Dean of this moment. As if there was any chance he could have forgotten it anyway. But hell, he knows he'll be admiring that mark in the mirror every damn day anyhow. “Oh, god, Cas,” he moans softly.
Something swoops in Dean’s stomach. “C-Castiel? Sounds like… I dunno, maybe an angel or-or something?” His voice squeaks slightly on “angel,” and he prays to God Cas didn't notice.
Dean is feeling too relaxed this morning that not jerking off to get rid of his morning wood doesn't even put him in a bad mood. He goes through his morning routine in a happy daze, lost in the thoughts of blue eyes and a gravelly voice. He wonders if Angel's voice was gravelly because of sex, or if he sounds that fucked out naturally as well. Mmm, that's the pleasant thought that keeps him occupied all morning.
look on his face intimately familiar, but for the first time, all Dean's. Dean’s alone. “Damn, Cas,” he breathes as his Angel pulls out and drops down on the bed beside him.
how is he this fucking
“Mm,” Cas nods his agreement. “And at some point we are definitely fucking in that beautiful car of yours. And we have to use all of your toys. I have a lot of plans for you, Winchester.”
Cas pushes Dean against the wall and continues to nibble and suck his way down Dean's neck. Dean feels warm hands slip into the waistband of his boxers and in one fluid movement, he's standing naked in front of the man of his fantasies; hard and dripping precum, desperate to get any sort of friction on his aching cock.
When they finally pull into his garage at home, Cas doesn't even let him park Baby before he's on him, lips at his throat, teeth and tongue on his skin as Dean grunts and works to stop the car and smack the button that closes the garage. Exiting the car is a mess of limbs and grunts and giddy chuckles and unfortunate elbows, and Dean somehow finds himself pressed to the wall with Cas’ lips slotted to his own, tongue sliding inside, his unbelievably hard body pressing him in and keeping him there. “Cas-Cas--” he grunts as the lips trail down to his jaw. “Bedroom - come on - gotta--” Cas growls, but he lets him slip away, and they practically chase each other inside.
An eternity and 69 seconds later, Dean feels a lubed finger join Cas' mouth, and his cock twitches
The man - the man he knows as Angel - approaches, and he's - he’s fucking

"I-I'm fine." Dean says, sounding unconvincing to his own ears. Cas looks down Dean's body again, and Dean's pretty sure his lips twitch when they land on his crotch. He's also sure that the gaze stops at his crotch for longer than necessary but that might just be wishful thinking. Oh boy, Dean really hopes Cas can't make out the massive erection he's currently sporting. He seriously doesn't want to look like a creep in front of the man.

The blare of Dean’s alarm has him groaning thickly and burying his head in his pillow immediately. Blindly, he slaps at it until it shuts off, tugging the pillow down over his head, one knee propped up underneath him, nose and cheek quashed against the bed, sheets twisted and clinging to his skin. He was so out of it the night before he didn't pull on pajamas, so his cock is nestled comfortably between him and the sheets, his body feeling lax and tingly and

sound as it slides free. Cas begins unbuttoning his shirt, and Dean groans as inches of Cas' skin are revealed torturously slowly.
Cas looks up from where he had been ogling at Dean's cock and says, "It's only fair, Dean. You've already seen me naked, now it's my turn."
Cas smirks against Dean's skin and leans back to
Groaning as Cas bounces Dean on his cock, he lifts him from the wall and turns distractedly, kissing Dean and fucking Dean and
Something crazy bursts in Dean's chest, his heart fluttering wildly. “Took the… non-words right outta my mouth,” he chuckles with a smile, edging closer to Cas and wrapping an arm around his waist. Cas’ arm immediately comes up around his back, and he looks at him with some kind of wonder in his eyes. “I certainly wasn't expecting this when I drove into your shop this evening.”
And drive Dean does. He drives like a madman, speeding most of the way home. Both he and Cas are unable to stop touching each other - soft touches to the other's thighs, caressing each others' faces, making out at red lights - anything they can get away with in public. This is the longest foreplay Dean has ever had and damn if it isn't also the hottest.
that strip tease, while being fucked at the same time, Dean might just die of a heart attack after this.
, please. Please, baby, I want your cock so bad.” Cas hums and pushes his fingers in deeper, thrusting a few more times before pulling out.
He peels off his coat and slides off his tie, the material making a

He moans some jumbled mix of Cas’ name and curse words and blasphemy again, locking his ankles behind Cas’ back as Cas starts fucking him again, rocking him against the wall until his back burns, Cas’ lips barely letting up their assault even when it gets messy, saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths and tears squeezed from the corners of eyes, or at least
Dean thrills at the sight that Angel makes - his head covered in white, dick still hard and throbbing so hard that Dean can make it out even through the screen, lips swollen and red from being stretched so much.
and Dean's knees tremble, his head thrown back and his ass twitching as Cas starts fucking him. He can feel every inch as it slides through his insides, feeling like it's pulling out all of him with it before fucking back in each time and making Dean gasp, his shins straining, his toes bending, his feet arching up high as Cas fucks in, fucks
Sam’s pretty sure his eyebrows have taken up residence near his hairline. He’s still not sure what’s going on here, what they’re talking around, but Dean openly admitting to being full of shit and using the word ‘posturing’ is a rarity.
They trudged on, until, in the midst of the whole lot of nothing on the horizon, a figure appeared. He was somewhat plain: olive skin, average height, and a forgettable face, but beside Dean, Cas heaved a heavy sigh of relief. “Thank you for meeting us,” he said as they approached.
priority -- now is to reform Heaven. That means staying in Heaven to do so.”
Cas finally dropped his gaze, ducking his head a bit. “As are you.”
Yeah, ‘only’ a ‘small amount.’ Cas had gone from bad to worse in the scarce few minutes they’d been upstairs. “Right. Let me guess, that ‘small amount’ is more than you can safely do what with the burning up or whatever.”
“It’s late, Dean. I’ll see you in the morning.”
“Come on, take advantage of the free labor.” He grinned when her only answer was to roll her eyes and throw a sponge in his direction.
"So, uh," he says, and clears his throat, more as a distraction than any real desire to make conversation. "You did good today. Thanks. For tagging along, I mean. Even if it wasn't really your choice to get beamed down."
Another sigh burst through the line, crackling with static at the edges. “So we’re looking at soul magic.”
, which is hilarious. So he doesn’t need to, I don’t know, worry or anything.”
“What are we doing in a crappy mall, man?”
Sam finally gets a good look at his face and Dean’s
So Dean, being Dean, instead says, “What the fuck were you thinking?”
“We need to make a stop,” Cas growls, and though Dean’s not sure what the hell this is about, he frowns and goes along with it, following the directions Cas reads off of his phone.
(There’s a few excruciatingly awkward moments the next morning where Sam has to pretend he
“If there were fewer interruptions, perhaps I would have by now.”
that the visions could have come from someone other than God. That last one is particularly grating -- why would
“You’re Ramiel?” Dean asked.
“I’m sorry.”
But Dean could only think of the last time he’d seen Cas, how the quiet warmth that underlined most of their interactions had been absent, replaced by a coldness that had blazed behind his eyes. They’d long ago mastered the art of dancing around the edges of a conversation, saying only what they needed to and willfully ignoring the remnants of a thousand different unresolved tensions. But the stilted staccato of their last conversation had kept Dean off-beat all week, wondering where he’d missed a step. Little things: the strange reaction to Dean’s admission of a connection with Amara, the mess he’d left in the bunker when he was usually so orderly, the way Dean’s skin had prickled when Cas had reached out to touch his shoulder. He’d told himself he was overreacting. And
“We’ll fix it. Both of you, I swear. We’ll figure something out.”
He pushes himself up from his seat, rocks on his heels for a moment, and that's when he hears the sound of the door opening. He scrubs a hand over his face and rallies himself. A few more minutes won't hurt. "Hey," he says, barely looking up as Cas ambles down the stairs. His gait is odd, a weird hodgepodge mix of the older, more wooden Castiel and the newer, more human Cas, as if his brain's been thrown off-kilter and can't decide which is right. Hell would do that to most people, he guesses.
It’s the first time Sam’s heard anything about a speech, and as much as the discomfort is still there, curiosity overtakes it for a moment. He’s not stupid: he knew something went down before the Empty took Cas. It had been all over Dean’s face. But there hadn’t been time, and with how determined Dean was to push through and finish the job, Sam hadn’t wanted to press, hadn’t wanted to be the one to break through the determination to expose the raw grief below.
“That’s different.”
Dean laughs again, and this final time it actually sounds like laughter, something lighter and warmer than the jagged scoffs he usually scrapes out. “I have no fucking clue, except that I
Between trying to be as open as possible (for him, at least) about the Mark and Amara, and then trying to work things out with Mary, the last few years have seen some major improvements in terms of talking about his feelings. But with Cas, it’s always been that much harder. There’ve always been so many layers of things that are impossible to touch, and trying to navigate real, open conversation around them has always felt a little bit like a game of Battleship. But something’s gotta give, and Dean’s starting to realize that if it’s not his aversion to talking about his feelings, sooner or later it’ll be Cas. And maybe in some ways that’d be easier (hard and miserable as fuck, sure, but easier, perhaps, than the alternative), but Dean’s starting to realize that, if nothing else, he owes it to the both of them to try. He takes a deep breath and lets go of Cas’s sweatshirt, swiping a surprisingly steady hand across his eyes. “No, you’re right.”
And they end up turning into the parking lot of a somewhat rundown outlet mall. Whatever he’d thought the “stop” would turn out to be, it sure as hell wasn’t that. “Uh, Cas?”
. “That’s impossible.” His voice was annoyingly even.
“Ow, dude, get off of me.”
“No time like the present?” Sam said, a bit of anxiety evident despite the awkward smile on his face.
Dean sighed. “Look, he had a rough day a while back.” He didn’t elaborate that the ‘rough day’ involved the literal devil and God’s evil sister. “It shook all of us up. But I’m sure he’s fine. He’s always fine.”
Maybe tired isn’t the word, but Sam sure as hell doesn’t know what the word
Cas actually laughs at that, a small, huff of a thing. "I would've thought it'd be obvious by now that when it comes to you, there's very little I wouldn't do."
“Google says it’s a popular store amongst teenagers,” Cas says gravely as they walk in, and nods to the bored-looking girl behind the counter.
to be found on the Mark, they would’ve found it ages ago. Instead, he stayed quiet, halfheartedly leafing through boxes upon boxes of files as his brother tore through every room in search of answers that just didn’t exist. The only time he tried to say something other than ‘hey, let me go whip us up some sandwiches’ or ‘pass me that box,’ tried to bring up the possibility of there not being an answer, Sam put a stop to it before he had been able to get a whole sentence strung together. Days passed, but it felt more like prolonging the inevitable than any true calm before the storm.
Sam put his own mug down, face immediately switching into business mode. “So, as soon as you called me, I had an idea.”
“What the hell, guys?” Dean interjected, shoving his chair back from the table with one violent move. “We’re not seriously talking about this, are we?”
“You’re looking better,” he said, and then was struck with the oddest sense of déjà vu. It felt like it’d been a million years since the last time they were here having a similar conversation.
“The whole trip.” Dean tried to say it teasingly, to keep things light, but he could hear the worry that came through of its own volition. He faked a cough and reached for the door to try and cover it, unsure if he could handle another iteration of ‘I’m fine’ from Cas at the moment. “Sam said he’d try to find stuff in the Men of Letters archive about soul magic when I called him. Who knows, maybe he’s found something.”
The buzz he always got from long drives was already beginning to wear off, and the events of the past twelve hours hit him like a freight truck. He’d been hoping to catch at least a couple hours’ sleep before starting in on this again, but he knew the likelihood of them letting him crash now was slim to none. “Right. Jesus. Okay, let me at least get some caffeine first.”
Great. He still doesn’t get it. Sam just sighs, figuring that that’s enough for now. Freedom is a new taste, and it’s going to take some time to get used to it. His smile is a little crooked when he picks his own bottle up and tilts it Dean’s way. “Well. To figuring it out, I guess.”
“We?” Relief filled him, cool and soothing. That could only mean one thing. “Cas is okay, then?”
“I’m always careful,” Dean said with a smirk, then turned around and walked past Cas through the door to the dungeon before he could think better of it. He inhaled sharply, ignoring the prickle at the corner of his eyes as he forced himself to focus on the devil’s trap painted onto the floor. He didn’t look up as dark shoes came into view a few moments later. “Just promise me one thing,” he said to Cas’s feet, voice gruff.
Understanding dawns on Jack’s face – must be nice, because Sam still feels like he’s a couple dozen steps behind over here – and his smile is back, softer. “Oh. Castiel. Father. I’m not making you choose.”
A smile slid onto his face of its own volition. “Awesome.”
Dean tried to catch Cas’s gaze, but Cas refused to meet his eyes, his line of sight instead flicking to somewhere behind Dean’s shoulder. When he turned, Dean saw himself walking back to the table, a plate in each hand. “Alright,” his memory-self said as he sat down, setting one plate down in front of an empty seat and the other in front of him. He peered over at the empty seat -- where Cas had been sitting that day, Dean suddenly realized -- and began chattering away through mouthfuls of his burger.
in their eyes?? Something’s both familiar and weirdly, completely new and it’s throwing Sam for a loop, because it’s almost like –
“Like my arm’s gone a couple rounds with a hot iron,” he said, moving to sit up against the headboard.
The shadow lifts from Jack’s face, but the bruised feeling in Sam’s heart doesn’t go away. It stays there, gnawing at him as Jack steps into the doorway they open, and even drowns out the way Dean shuffles and paces and grumbles under his breath for every long minute that passes without it reappearing.
things to Dean. “That can be arranged, too.”
And then on day eight, Castiel appeared at their front door, alone, grim-faced, and weary, and said, “I may have found something.”
Cas hesitates, and in the split second the doubt takes to flutter across his expression, Dean can already see where this is going to end up going.
The joke was out of his mouth before he could think twice about whether it was appropriate. “Maybe this time don’t try to get strangers to do it for you.”
"Family? Hah, okay. You keep telling yourself that, bucko." Lucifer gives him an exaggerated wink. "But between you and me, I'd work on the delivery a little more. Once more, with feeling. Maybe then the next time lover boy here is mooning over you, he'll listen. Not that you really need him to believe it, anyway. He
Her eyes were deadly serious. “Might want to make sure you’re doing your job.”
Dean blinked. “What?”
Dean had apparently missed the moment where they’d gone from hypothetical Grace to Cas’s very real, very toxic burning Grace. “Wait, what?”
Dean cleared his throat, the story feeling far too uncomfortable and relatable for reasons he pretended not to know. “Is it true? Did it work?”
The short but satisfying encounter with Ronny or whatever the hell the dude’s name was at the bar was enough to keep him from lashing out, but his veins are still thrumming with a low-key discontent. If Cas is just fucking around with emojis or whatever the hell he does in his spare time, Dean’s going to kill him. He’s about to demand some freaking answers when Cas finally looks up and over at him, the glow from the screen illuminating what is very clearly Cas’s “mission” face. This can’t be good.
Even with how disconnected Dean had felt from everything, with the unease burning through his veins, he still felt a twinge of fear and dread at the resignation in his friend’s voice. “Sam said you were worse, uh, this summer.” It was awkward, mentioning the six week period he’d spent as a demon so casually, but the way Cas’s jaw clenched said that he knew exactly when Dean was referring to. “And you got better,” he added, somewhat unnecessarily. “At least for a while, anyway. Whatever you did, can’t you do it again? Just until we find a more permanent solution?”
Dean was forcibly reminded of earlier, how Cas had referred to the angels as ‘them’ and not ‘us’. “Maybe. But most angels aren’t resurrected a bunch of times, either,” he said lightly. “Or have a vessel without a human riding alongside. You’re different, Cas.”
“No,” Cas agreed, though the reminder had apparently given him some sort of motivation. The look he levelled at Dean next was stronger, more determined, and some of the weariness surrounding him faded as he straightened in his chair. “We’d use the portal.”
Sam cleared his throat, some of the happiness fading from his smile to be replaced with hesitancy as he looked down for a moment. “And, uh, what about you?”
“Dean--”
What? Yeah, Cas had taken more than his fair share of hits like the rest of them, but he always landed on his feet. He didn’t get bogged down by the angst and trauma like he and Sam did, the lucky bastard.
Fury filled him, hot and familiar and oh so welcome. “You’re saying you knew. All of you, from the moment I took the Mark. You knew I would turn into a demon?”
Their trip to Heaven felt like it had taken at least the better part of a day, but once the two of them stumbled from the playground back to the car, Dean’s phone read just after midnight. “I’ll call Sam,” Dean said as he slid onto the seat and started the ignition. “Why don’t you get comfy, get a few hours.” He resisted adding the obvious, ‘You look like you’re about to keel over.’
So Cas has spent time Googling cat videos. Dean can’t even be surprised anymore. It’s ugly as hell, but the way Cas cradles the thing to his chest sparks something deep and warm in his own chest, and he knows they’re going to end up taking the damn thing back to Claire. “All right,” he says, quirking his lips upward, clapping his hand to Cas’s shoulder. He lets it linger for longer than he would usually dare, reveling in the small, fond smile he gets in return. “Let’s get a gift bag and get the hell out of here.”
Cas turned from where he’d been staring out the window for the last twenty miles. “How bad is what?”
Trying to find the right words has
Well now Dean just feels even shittier. He knows he’s been a dick. Ever since Cas decided to give up his Grace and officially move into one of the empty rooms in the bunker, Dean’s been on edge. And for once, it’s not like he’s just been waiting for something to give, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Yeah, it usually does, and usually finds a way to kick them in the ass on the way down, but he’s slowly starting to believe that maybe, once in a while, they can have a win. Lucifer and the British Men of Letters have been taken care of. Crowley and Rowena are still out there, but closer to reluctant allies than any true danger they need to worry about. Mary moved out, but they’re slowly working on their relationship. Having Cas here full-time, close and dangerously human is the cherry on top of a pretty damn good year by their standards. And that, more than anything, is what has him on edge. Because if the universe is finally starting to give them good things, he’s the only thing standing in his own way. It was hard knowing that Heaven and Hell were personally standing in the way of his happiness. It was hard as hell always having something come between him and Cas. It was hard only getting days, maybe weeks when they were lucky, scattered here and there before another crisis pulled one or both of them away again. But for all their spiels on free will, somehow it’s harder having Cas here with him all the time, only having himself to blame for not being brave and taking the step they’ve been dancing around for years.
he is. For the first time, he thinks of Heaven as something to look forward to, to getting the chance to see all the people he’s loved and lost and telling them everything they missed.
at channeling any other emotion into anger, are the rough drives. The cassette player will be silent, almost mockingly so, but the thrum of the engines’ rev in unison with the latest clench of Dean’s jaw have just as much a familiar place in the soundtrack of Sam’s life. The seats creak and moan with every huffed breath and Dean’s knuckles go so white-tight around the steering wheel the leather audibly complains, and Sam’s teeth will ache from biting down something he can’t take back. Whether it’s cold fury or the heat of a worn-out, ongoing battle, their disagreements are loud without ever having to say a word.
He reaches out again -- Dean recoils, has to throw a palm out behind him to steady himself on the table, but Lucifer ignores it, reaches out and pats him on the shoulder. "Well, you have fun in that guilt spiral you're heading down. Call me when you're ready to take on the Darkness. You have my number." And with that, he blows a mocking kiss in Dean's direction and saunters up the stairs, whistling to himself.
Cas finally turns to look at him, and the fierceness in his eyes makes Dean falter a moment. “It’s her birthday, Dean.” His voice is low and clear and no-nonsense. “I know you said that I’m nothing to her, that she’s better off alone, but.” He sighs. “She deserves just a little bit of happiness.”
“Please, Ramiel,” Cas said. Some of the exhaustion that had been so prevalent on his face had disappeared, replaced with fervor and focus. “Anything would be helpful.”
“I’m not saying I won’t mess this up, because fuck knows I will,” Dean says, but he’s got something like hope on his face too, smile shaky but broadening. “But yeah. I’m sure. Yes. I want this, and I swear, we’ll figure it out.”
And Cas would look up at him and frown and say, “You’d have Sam. You’d be fine.”
And if he slips that Batman keychain onto the counter, too, well, that’s his own damn business.
It feels… off. The words feel like they should be an ending, a milestone, a way to close out this chapter and figure out where the next pages take them. Instead, it feels like a mockery. Sam wonders if Dean feels it too, with the way he hesitates, his whole body straining like there’s something that’s trying to break free. If there is, it loses the fight: there’s a small, half-bitten off sigh, and he raises the bottle to his lips.
these tiny creatures were so enthralling, but with an ever-growing amount of reverence as the years have passed. But there's an edge to it now, something harsh that sends all sorts of alarms screaming in Dean's head.
Cas’s scowl deepened, but it was Dean’s turn to interrupt. “Look, so there’s no Magic Eraser. I wasn’t expecting one. But come on, man, you gotta give us something, anything, to work with. About the Mark or how the binding magic works or… whatever?”
“Castiel,” the angel said in reply, nodding his head gravely to the two of them. “And Dean Winchester, I presume.”
Ramiel either didn’t notice their exasperation or didn’t care. “I am sorry, brother.”
“Yeah.”
“Aaron Birch,” Cas said, still clutching his cup. He hadn’t taken a single sip of his coffee, though he’d brought it up to his lips and simply inhaled a few times. “I remember.”
Alex had helped do the cooking, so Claire was on clean-up duty. Dean hadn’t missed the glances she’d been throwing him all day -- clearly there was something on her mind -- so he decided to bite the bullet and grab the rest of the dirty plates, following her into the small kitchen. “I’ll wash and you dry?” he offered, rolling the sleeves of his shirt up.
Reassuring. “And there, uh, won’t be any issue with the thing on my arm?” The angels had never exactly been his biggest fans, and he couldn’t imagine bearing the father of murder’s brand would endear him to them in any way.
Dean’s bewilderment was quickly eclipsed by anger. “So you’re just gonna sit there, wasting what little time you have left on this last-ditch effort at finding information instead of trying to find some kind of solution.”
“Looked?” She was more perceptive than he thought teenage girls were supposed to be. “So does that mean he’s
Cas just keeps staring, and when he finally makes a move, it’s to look at Jack, face all screwed up. “I—I don’t—”
But on the drive home from Hastings, it’s just… quiet. There’s no sighing, no fidgeting, no unspoken conversations. There’s a million and one things running through Sam’s mind, about God, about Jack, about what it means that those two may things are essentially now one and the same. About Eileen, and how he has no clue how he’s going to see if she’s okay, given how the shattered remains of her cell phone are in the duffel in the trunk, and how he doesn’t even know if she’ll

his prostate. But it's Cas’ eyes when he looks at him, dark and deep blue above him, watching him with lust and heat and want and tenderness all at once that makes Dean cum with a shout, pleasure shooting through his stomach and exploding through his entire body as he clenches down around Cas, his cum spurting hot on his own abs as well as Cas’.
A shiver shoots up his straightening spine, the wrench slipping from his fingers to bang loudly on the ground. That voice… oh god, that voice. Did he - Could he have just imagined it? Blood surges from his brain directly to his dick as he squints around the headlights of the car that just pulled in, until suddenly they blink off, and a man exits his vehicle. A man that looks… intimately
Dean groans and points towards his drawer where he keeps any and all sex related stuff. He takes a second to admire Cas' clothed ass before turning around and sticking his ass out for him. He can hear Cas fumbling around in the drawer, seemingly taking his sweetass time to mess with Dean.
Cas takes a step forward, standing just centimeters away from Dean, and leans forward to speak into Dean's ear. "I think we're both adults and can make decisions for ourselves. I also think we both know what exactly has been going through that frustratingly sexy head of yours, so why don't we stop tip toeing around each other and get straight to it?" He says in a throaty voice, right at Dean's ear.
to Castiel’s front from chest to hips. Pleasure shoots through his gut as their cocks slot together, and he feels Cas fever hot and aching hard against his groin. A moan slips past his lips that Cas swallows up, that tongue teasing along his own and actually driving him crazy.

sensitive, and Dean tweaks one of them, loving the way it makes Cas respond.
The awe and gratitude in Cas’s smile makes him briefly wish he’d had the guts to actually say the word, but it’s enough for now. Someday soon he’ll say it. He’ll murmur it into every inch of Cas’s skin and watch as his eyes light up. He’ll cry it while Cas presses him into the mattress. He’ll say it while they’re wrapped up together, hands entwined. But for now, he just takes Cas’s hand and says, “Come on,” and leads him back to Dean’s room.
All of Dean’s posturing just evaporated, leaving nothing to cover up the bone-deep weariness. “No,” he said, pinning the phone between his ear and his shoulder to free his hand long enough to swipe it over his eyes. “He’s not.”
That made two of them. Dean could feel his face beginning to burn. He itched to turn back to the sink and be done with this.
He’d tried not to get his hopes up, truly, but the words struck like a physical blow nonetheless. God fucking damnit.
He doesn’t need to turn around to know that Cas is rolling his eyes. “It’s one bite. And it’s much better than you would’ve ended up with had I not intervened.” He’s apparently made it back to his feet -- Dean hears the crunch of the hay as he walks over.
“Huh.” Dean let out a small huff of breath, somewhat intrigued despite himself. Sure, Heaven had turned out to be fewer harps and fluffy white clouds and whatever than the expectation, and he’d never been the ‘kowtow in reverence’ type anyway, but there was something still a bit impressive about seeing the real deal for himself. The parking lot melted away as they crossed it, gravel and grey-blue sky disappearing into an expanse of white. It was thankfully duller than the light that had led them here; no blinding pain or spots in his vision, just a stretch of nothing as far as he could see.
