”Jarvis, are you familiar with quantum physics?” ”Very much so, sir.” ”Good. Hit me with Foster’s formula’s section six, matter’s energy output and exchange sub-model and then add in the mix Banner’s calculations from the New Mexico numbers compared to the ones from New York. Unite them and then put them into works with an arc reactor engine.”
”It suits you.” Steve looks smug as he grins. ”Oh, I know. Tony has made sure I know just how much he thinks it suits me.” Tony squints his eyes and sighs. ”I’m gonna call you thirsty-Steve from now on, just so you’ll know.” Steve just shrugs again with a wide smile, about to answer with something cocky, probably, when a sudden blow of wind surprises Tony.
”It wasn’t meant as a roast, mind you.” ”I know.” Tony squints his eyes. ”You’re being weirdly calm about all of this.” ”Am I now?” ”Yeah. I’m afraid your husband isn’t getting as gentle a treatment.” It makes Steve crack up a bit. ”Yeah, you’re probably right. I was kinda stuck up at times, wasn’t I?”
Tony’s whole face is now filled with worry instead of confusion, and Steve sighs out in relief. It was just some prank, and now Tony knows it wasn’t funny-
Tony sees that Steve has calmed down and that makes him smile even wider. ”There you go,” he says and puts his arm around Steve to pat his shoulder. Almost unconsciously Steve leans to him slightly, prompting Tony to leave his hand around him. ”There you go,” he says again, ”hug it out. That’s what I tell my sons every time they fight over something dumb.” Steve huffs out a laugh.
He turns his gaze back to Tony’s whose still looking at him. The look on his eyes isn’t pressing but encouraging, even though Steve still feels silly talking to this man, especially opening up to him, there’s something in that look that nudges him over the line he has drawn in his mind to protect himself, to protect others.
Before he has a chance to decide on which it is, Steve coughs and takes a careful step towards him. Tony instantly opens his hands a little, making his body language as encouraging as possible as Steve takes another step and is completely in his space now.
Finally, he speaks again but the words come out slowly and he, in turn, takes a step back. ”You’re not my husband.” Steve lets out a breath. ”…No, I’m not. We’ve been dating for like, six weeks, Tony. I am not your husband.” Tony doesn’t seem to listen, he just stares intently into his eyes.
Tony waves his hand, clearly not having listened a word he was saying. ”Yeah, yeah. I’m sorry, I just have to check something real quick.” Steve is a bit hurt by Tony’s attitude towards him, after all the work they have done for their relationship the last few months. Tony still hasn’t looked away from the screen in front of them so Steve turns his eyes back as well, just in time to see Tony get up from his chair and walk to the printer. And take something from it.
”When does the beard debut?” Steve stares at him for a moment longer before losing it and starting to laugh. Tony smiles at the visual - Steve is the most beautiful when he laughs freely like that. And being the one to make him laugh…
Tony throws him a pleased grin. ”I had a great time too, Cap. Again next week? Or later this week if we find the time?” Steve nods and smiles, and Tony smiles back at him.
”You… You just… Is this a trick shot? Like the ones in movies nowadays?” Steve turns to look at Tony again and finds him staring at the screen with a blank face that Steve knows to mean deep disappointment. It’s possible he hasn’t seen Tony look so unimpressed ever before, he realizes. ”That dipshit…” he mutters to himself again and sighs deeply before turning to Steve.
”Jarvis hasn’t worked for you in years, sir.” A robotic female voice suddenly fills the room, making Tony almost jump out of his skin.
”Please listen to me, and decide for yourself if this isn’t something Tony Stark wouldn’t do, especially like, over ten years ago. I was at the workshop, just trying to figure some thing out, when I accidentally invented teleport. Or I thought I did, except that what I really did was just replicate the technique of the Tesseract, and I didn’t take into account that I have no idea how to navigate it, and so I woke up here, and I’m guessing the Tony Stark you know is somewhere out there in an alternative universe to him as well, maybe even where I came from.”
Now Tony looks almost insulted as he finally lets go of his middle, prompting Steve to take a step back. ”Seriously, Steve, what are you on about?” His face, however, relaxes immediately after saying that. ”Oh, were they that impossible this morning? I know how it can be, if Harvey and Peter really get into it it’s such a pain in the ass to try to-”
Once the laughter calms down a little Steve pulls back and rubs his neck. Damn him for looking so good doing anything at all, Tony thinks as his sight is momentarily focused on the bit of skin the motion exposed on Steve’s abdomen.
Steve is still looking at him with a crooked eyebrow, clearly amused. ”Oh, we do. We do. I mean, not as much ’cause there’s just simply not as much time for the two of us, exactly like I just complained, but when we do have the time… There are some benefits to growing old together, you know. The way we know each other bodies… And about you being fifty? Don’t worry about that, at all, cause… Hot damn. You age like a fine red wine. You just keep on getting better.” Steve’s eyes go hazy and it’s clear his reminiscing as he licks his lips unconsciously. ”Damn, I wish he was here.”
The blonde shrugs. ”After the attack of New York Fury got freaked out and called Carol.” ”Carol?” ”Captain Marvel?” Tony shakes his head, showing he still doesn’t know who they’re talking about. ”Well, doesn’t matter. She’s like, the most powerful being in the universe nowadays, probably. Anyway, she looked into it and realized that something called Thanos, I think it was, was trying to collect Infinity Stones. Luckily Carol stopped him before he could get any of them. I can’t even imagine the mess if she hadn’t.”
There’s a comforting weight of someone sitting next to him in a bed, of someone gently playing with his hair, of someone calling his name sweetly. And finally, someone pressing kisses all over his face, first on the forehead, then on both cheeks, on his nose, and finally, finally to his lips.
He continues browsing through the pages filled with pictures of the two of them, together and with other people. In one of them they are on a picnic with Natasha, Clint and two men Tony doesn’t recognize. He reads the text, written in Steve’s neat handwriting: Central park, 2014, with Nat, Clint, Sam and Bucky. Who the hell are Sam and Bucky? 2014? That makes no sense. Well, except that it does, ’cause this is a dream and the only thing that makes sense is that it doesn’t make sense.
”Uhm, sorry for that. I’m gonna head upstairs, I have an early morning with Clint tomorrow.” Tony’s eyes shoot back up to Steve’s face as he speaks. He nods and unconsciously rubs his hands together. ”Yeah, yeah, of course. Sure thing. I think I’m gonna stop by the workshop, otherwise I’d offer a ride.”
He turns in his chair to Steve throwing him a dirty look. ”Hey, I said I’m sorry!” he says exasperatedly, knowing what’s making him so frustrated is more guilt than the (fairly) justifiable weight of Steve’s unimpressed gaze.
Steve bites his lips together, clearly amused by Tony’s nervous rambling, and that makes Tony feel at least a little better. ”Well, I’ll just head up by myself then. Good night and thanks again for tonight.” Tony coughs, trying to regain his composure as he gives a what he hopes to be a casual salute.
”Am I a good father, Steve?” Uneasiness tries to strangle his insides as Steve shakes his head in surprise and let out a strangled laugh. ”Tony,” he says and turns so that he’s completely facing him now, looking almost insulted by the question, ”you are an amazing father.” Tony let’s out a shuddering breath, one he didn’t realize he was holding.
Tony lays there for good ten minutes, just blinking with a blank face and staring to the ceiling, before he realizes there’s something in his ring finger.
Tony grins and snaps his fingers, throwing finger guns at the exasperated man there. This is payback for all the shit he gets for being a ’reckless dumbass’ sometimes, especially from Steve; he’s occasional but admittedly fairly consistent (and apparently interuniversal, too) dumbass-ery just saved the day.
destructive force behind it, and that he really should be smarter about this, as intriguing as it would be to find out what was different about Steve (and Tony himself, for that matter) in this reality, different enough for Steve to be worthy.
”I honestly can’t remember the last time I fell asleep on the garage. But you must’ve been just as tired since you didn’t come to wake me up to come to bed, either. And- Wait a second, you shaved?! Why!” Steve physically feels his brain trying to make sense from Tony’s words only to come up with nothing.
”FRIDAY, give me yesterday’s log.” Steve frowns. ”Tony, it’s Tuesday, did you hit your head or-” ”Oh, right! 2012,” Tony suddenly talks over him, drumming his finger anxiously against the table and making Steve snap his lips closed. He has no idea what’s going on but that didn’t make him like Tony’s habit of interrupting everyone when he’s in the zone any more likable for him. He’s just about to voice his annoyance but this time Tony stops him before he can even start. ”Jarvis, give me yesterday’s security tape from this room.”
When the storm calms and Tony's head slows its spinning, some endless amount of time that's probably a few seconds but feels like hours later, her vision clears enough that she sees the limb her nails have been digging desperately into is Steve's right forearm.  She immediately knows, without checking, that his other arm is the one carefully supporting the curve of her back.
"You say that every morning," Steve points out, amused.  His eyes are doing that stupid little cute twinkle thing, which only makes Tony feel more irritated.
EDIT: Went back and made some general changes; things should be more polished and less clunky this time around <3 (Also AO3 y u always remove my formatting,
"I...suppose it would have to be himself," Bruce says, clearly bemused. "But what does that have to do with..."
"Stop being a bitch about it and come eat with us," Tony orders over Steve's elbow, "before an angry Pepper finds you later and force-feeds you something you hate." She gives him the flat stare of I-see-through-your-bullshit, and that is what finally does it: his shoulders sag, and he throws his hands up in one last expression of protest in his exasperated surrender.
"I'm fine, Tony," he says after a moment, smiling fondly with a familiar softness around his eyes. Tony gets it, then, and chuffs, swatting him playfully on the arm.
His soulmark reads, and Steve's eyebrows shoot up at the mention of 'blood' and 'metal' before he continues:
"Stark.  JARVIS said we have an intruder," Other-Steve announces finally over the wind, all these things having transpired in maybe ten or fifteen seconds since Tony's first question about Doctor Alliteration's title.
"I have to go pee," Tony says, ruining the moment.  Steve's laughter echoes after her as she wobbles to the bathroom on coltish legs to make sure she doesn't get a UTI.  After she pees, drains as much come out of herself as possible (so that she doesn't have to do laundry tomorrow; she has nothing against jizz, itself), and washes her hands, she grabs a wet washcloth, stumbles back to the bed, and cleans off her soulmate's dick before patting it lovingly and collapsing into bed.
Ten-ish minutes later, Tony is free of the bed and being escorted, blindfolded and handcuffed, to somewhere else by Natasha.
Steve's still standing in the foyer.   When she looks back at him, he's flushed all the way to the neck.  His face is pinched with a combination of indignation, which Tony had expected, and anger, which... she hadn't.  His eyes are bright and burning with something Tony doesn't instantly recognize, and a shiver of unease runs down her spine.
"...It's three in the morning," Natasha observes mildly a few seconds later with an aura of heavy judgement, successfully breaking the spell.  The knives in her hands have vanished to god only knows where on her person (she's wearing
"Ste--my fiancé liked it," Tony sniffs defiantly, heart speeding up at the slip.  Natasha shoots her a sharp glance, and Tony stares back blankly as best she can.
"Your calves are halfway off the bed," Tony points out, because they are.  It looks ridiculous.  Steve chuffs against her skin carelessly and swings his offending limbs up, bending his legs at the knees to fit everything onto Man-Tony's admittedly comfortable mattress.
She'd like to stay and watch Man-Tony and JARVIS work for another moment longer, but the itch to get her own hands on a piece of tech gets to be too hard to ignore. Tony turns to get Steve's attention, then stops, blinking with surprise. His eyes are already focused on hers, bright and arresting.
"Well, that's that," her counterpart declares, wiping his hands on an oil rag. He hands it off to her wordlessly, and Tony gratefully wipes her hands.
to.  Sounds of rustling come from Doctor Strange's direction as he rises from the couch, sounds that are echoed around the room as others follow his lead, bodies following the shift in conversation as the Doctor clearly prepares to leave.
Steve squints into the early sunlight for a moment, wind ruffling his hair, then says, "Yeah, I get that feeling, too.  I don't know, Tony."  He sighs heavily and gives her a weighted look.  "Some things seem the same, but...I think not having words has made life different here.
"Hey, watch the eyebrows, I pay good money to have those threaded," Tony complains as they remove her blindfold roughly.
His hands pull her to him and Tony goes willingly, melts into his embrace until they're pressed together, back to front, every inch of her wet skin sliding against the hard, warm muscle of his body, held there by the delicious crush of his arms as she arches against him.
"If it's about Bucky," Tony begins cautiously, and sure enough, this Steve can't hide his flinch, "he's fine.  He has a soulmate, too, just like anyone else."
"Would you like to tell me how you really got it?" her supposed friend asks quietly, raising one perfectly groomed eyebrow.  Tony's just about had it.
"'S fine," Tony mutters, pressing her forehead harder into the firm muscle of Steve's thigh, resolved to wait this time before she tries to move again, lest she trigger another bout of nausea. "There was work to be done, so."
of blood; I wish I had a fucking towel or some shit instead of all this metal, Jesus--" Her attention is totally focused on the bleeding wound in his leg, which, to be fair, looks pretty bad if you don't know the serum, so she misses the way Steve's eyebrows shoot up into his hairline.
"Anyway, Princess," her counterpart continues, with clear irritation at having his solitude disturbed, "in case the locked door wasn't a big enough hint, I'm not currently accepting visitors. Get out before I call security, and by security I mean the Hulk."
Steve), meanwhile, is still barefoot, and still wearing the exact same borrowed t-shirt and sweatpants.
"Thanks," she says, tossing it on the table with the armor, which lays there dormant on the table gleaming red and gold.
"Sorry, could we take this conversation someplace a little more comfortable?" Tony interjects, stepping forward to lean her cheek casually against Steve's bicep as everybody's attention shifts to her. "Not that I don't love hanging out on busy rooftops at 3 AM, but it's getting kind of cold and I have gravel dust in places I'd really rather not think about, so.  I feel as though a couch might go a long way towards reducing the current tensions we're experiencing--namely, the tensions in my
Once he’s gone Tony brings his hands to his face. ”I’d offer you a ride?!” he mutters to himself under his breath, ”what the hell was that?” Like Steve wasn’t scared enough of some of this stuff without him making it weirder in every turn.
Steve just gives them both a stern look (which might have worked, if his ears weren't still pink), and leaves the lab with a sigh, shaking his head.
"Yeah," he says quietly,  "I figured that's what you'd say about it."  His eyes skim over her. "Didn't seem like you noticed the looks he was giving you earlier.  He
"That makes two of us," Tony says, forcing a smile onto her face in an attempt to revive the levity that's been sucked out of her, and leans back in her chair like someone who
Why put them in the Pepper suite when there are three other perfectly good rooms just down the hall?  There are plenty of reasons, of course, but none of them really seem sufficient: to keep an eye on them (unlikely), as a show of trust (unnecessary; he just helped her fix the armor), an olive branch (ha)...
Fury was right, of course.  He is glad they let him find it out for himself, when he was alone.  That wasn't all there was to it, though: Steve, with his years of experience parsing truths and half-truths, could tell.  Politely, he probed further, even though the tightness around the man's good eye warned him to leave it off there.  "You wouldn't happen to know who it is, would you, sir?"
"For the last time, Bruce, we just don't know," Tony says, exasperated. "Science hasn't been able to figure it out yet.  Thor claims that it has to do with some decision his mom made eons ago or whatever, but I'm still not sure if he's full of shit."
"Had whiskey, earlier," she croaks carefully into Steve's leg, "Brandy." Because she might not be able to move her head, but if anyone's going to be talking about Tony Stark's health it's Tony Stark.
Before he can say anything, the kid tosses the hunk of metal about a hundred feet straight up in the air, and Iron Man, who's looping back around, catches it on his way past.
"Yeah, well. 'Don't tickle sleeping dragons,' and all that," she murmurs, taking another sip of whiskey. She waits for the burn to pass and swallows, licks her lips. "I did kind of rip into you, though. Sorry about that."
"You have his what on your where?" Man-Tony replies as Steve chokes on his own saliva in the background and begins coughing violently.
Later, in a fit of half grief-induced stupidity ("bravery," Bucky might call it sarcastically) brought on by the call, Steve asked Director Fury about his words in a one-on-one meeting.  He didn't bother pretending Fury is unaware of what they are: the man probably had them memorized days before Steve even thawed.  It isn't meant to be a probe.  Mostly, Steve's curious why SHIELD hadn't informed him of his mark as soon as he woke up, why it wasn't used as a bargaining chip to get Steve to stay or be still or stand down, or do any number of things their organization might have found useful.
"Of course, sir," JARVIS responds immediately. It seems he anticipated this command, because Tony's damaged suit rises right up from underneath the floor without any kind of wait period. Man-Tony turns, hands in his pockets, and looks at her.
have a guest," Natasha offers blandly, propping her hip casually against the arm of a lounge chair and watching the room like a cat surveying its domain. Clint, who's perched on the back of this armchair, says nothing, but looks vaguely amused--presumably because he considers himself too mature to express his annoyance the way Tony does.
"Thor, buddy," Tony sighs in relief, sagging back against Steve, "I have never been happier to see you and Schrödinger's hammer."
With a loud and equally unimpressed sigh, Clint snaps his bow closed and replaces the arrow in his quiver, shaking his head.  "Well, false alarm," the archer declares, sliding off the vantage point he's found on some minuscule ledge with a roll of his eyes and shoulders that says he thinks this has all been a complete waste of his time. "Stand down and unclench your butt-cheeks, folks."
"Steve," Tony begins, drawing their attention to her.  She keeps her eyes trained on Man-Tony as she continues, "JARVIS probably
It wasn't always easy to stick to it.  In his darkest moments, especially before the serum, he'd thought that God didn't want him to have a soulmate.  All soulmates needed each other; who'd
But the shower is not what makes Tony most excited.  No, that honor is exclusively reserved for the soaking tub.
"'Stark Raving Mad'?  Really, that's the best you could do?" Tony says, unimpressed, as she starts dumping the audio-visual feed from her suit into Man-Stark's personal files.  She titles the folder 'You're a plebe.', because she knows it will piss him off.
which means Tony knows exactly what that pinched, cloudy-eyed look means, guarded as both Steves seem to think it is.
Steve, meanwhile, chooses this moment to leave his position on the edge of the formation and cross the last few feet to Tony's side.  He bends slightly and extends his free hand to her in a wordless offer, his eyes still firmly on Doctor Strange. Tony, whose muscles are still somewhat wobbly from the shock, takes his hand gratefully and allows him to haul her up, wincing minutely at the pinch and scattering of gravel under her feet. Even before she's fully standing, Steve's maneuvering them back carefully towards a safer position, covering her with his shield as his eyes watch their target for any sudden movements.  Then, overprotective and over-concerned gentleman that he is, Steve quietly (and predictably) nudges Tony behind him, putting his broad, muscular shoulders between her and danger.
Steve is looking at her intently, and she's about to poke fun at him for staring when he reaches out and brushes his thumb along her words--his neat, old-fashioned handwriting that stretches across the top of her left breast.  She shivers under the touch, and her nipples tighten.
Tony nearly breaks her own neck turning to reply. "Seriously?" she says incredulously, eyebrows creeping into her hairline.  She carries their drinks back to the couch where they've been lounging since the other Avengers cleared out and informs him, "I don't know what saint-like deeds I must have done in a past life to get paired with you here, because Fury can assure you, I am an annoying shit."
"Once I cooled off and thought about it, I realized you were right," he admits quietly, looking down at his lap with a tired expression. "I was grafting my feelings onto you." He looks up at her. "Sorry about that."
"No, that's not it," Tony admits, "but, I mean." Tony pauses and thinks, for a moment.  Gathers her words.
, vision going white with the intensity of it, the incredible pleasure as her body twitches and spasms and her vocal chords are put totally beyond her control.
"Wipe your face after you eat, young man," she complains, turning away from his mouth and chin that still practically glisten with her wetness, and he rolls his eyes.
Bruce murmurs something to Man-Tony, and a moment later, Tony hears the two of them plus Clint leave.  The door shuts quietly behind them.
They don't stick around to see the reactions; Tony has too much bed with too little Steve in it, which is remedied as soon as they're in her room with the lights dimmed.
Anthony here that you were asleep, and furthermore that we weren't fit for company.  So, of course, he decided he had to come down and see for himself," Tony explains with a shrug. "Curiosity's a terrible thing." She begins examining her nails with a quiet sort of satisfaction while Other Tony shifts uncomfortably in her peripheral vision.  No doubt Steve is still glaring a hole in him.
" Doctor Strange corrects. "Look, I didn't know what sort of problem I was dealing with until I got here fifteen minutes ago; you can't expect me to show up here with an obscure universal transportation spell ready in hand."
"Hmm? Oh, you mean me," her counterpart responds from across the lab, finally pulling the rest of his attention away from his work. "What's up?"
"I'm afraid you've got me at a disadvantage," he admits, observing her the same way he might something in the lab.  Tony snorts.
Tony looks down at her fiancé where he's kneeling on the rug.  "Aww, look at that, Steve: he's learning."
The satisfied face he makes says that's exactly what he was expecting to hear. He stands, sets his glass down on the table, and says, "JARVIS, bring the lady's suit out of storage, if you please."
when he meets his soulmate--there isn't a snowball's chance in hell of someone else rattling off this garbage heap.  All the folks he knew with "Likewise," and "My pleasure," tattooed on their arms would have killed to be able to greet their match with such certainty.
"Exactly."  Tony glances between them, feeling something uncomfortable bubble in her stomach. "Look, all I can tell you is what I know, in my universe."
Tony swallows against the heavy feeling in her throat, and focuses instead on the feeling of Steve's big, warm hands as they shift carefully across her skin.
" Tony repeats, the thought of it like a sharp ache now that she's had the realization. "I mean, he--
Tony, as it turns out, doesn't have to wait very long: she's jolted out of her reverie about half an hour later by the sudden click of the door opening.  She glances down quickly to confirm that yes, she is, in fact, decent, but it doesn't exactly matter because by that point Man-Tony is already halfway inside the room.
"Okay, teenage romance cliches and Barton's spawn aside," Man-Tony says finally, changing the subject, "I think there's a very important question to answer here."  He gives Tony an unusually serious look.  Tony, who knows exactly what he's thinking, returns it for a moment and then sighs.
"Yeah, I love you too, you star-spangled piece of trash," she says, favoring him with a fully deserved look of disgust.  She crawls from his lap and points imperiously to the shower caddy. "Now make yourself useful and help me wash my body."
"'Stark-Spangled LAN with a Plan'?" he says aloud, corner of his mouth curled in a suppressed smile.  Steve chokes on air, and Natasha huffs to her left.
The idea that someone's out there waiting for him does go a long way towards improving his outlook on the future.
"You don't say," he mutters, glancing up at her with a little glimmer of amusement before returning his attention to the damage.
"The suit? Three, maybe four hours, give or take; JARVIS will let us know when it's done," Man-Tony says, reopening his work. "But anyway, we've still gotta finish fixing your suit, Pixie Stick."
'Just the place' turns out to be down the long hallway off the kitchen.  They pass the solitary, dark-stained door that, similarities holding true, should lead to his own private suite.  Tony eyes it, and that familiar itch to investigate prickles at her bones, raises goosebumps on her skin, but she resists the urgent pull telling her to satisfy her curiosity and drags her attention to the present as they move on.
"I like it," he admits, tracing back and forth as if he can't help himself. "Couldn't tell you why.  Maybe because you feel more, this way."
"Tony Stark," both Tony and her counterpart respond in snarky, defiant unison. A look of comprehension dawns on Doctor Strange's face.
holding off on Harry Potter jokes," Tony complains, ignoring all of these things and stomping angrily into the room, "and then
"Glad we tickle your funny bone, Doctor," Man-Tony cuts in, hands in his pockets, "but for Cap's sake, and maybe for the sake of our collective sleep schedules--" Bruce's jaw cracks helpfully on a yawn. "--We probably

not wearing a real shirt. His sleek, mechanically advanced quiver is slung awkwardly over whatever shitty, threadbare tank top, he threw on before bed, and though he
Steve's ears are as red as tomatoes. He doesn't seem to know what to do with himself, and appears to be torn between indignant disapproval and bewildered curiosity. Tony bursts out laughing.
"Yes," she confirms once again. "Logan's a jackass, but he and The American Sniper get along pretty well, between all the bickering.  He's a mutant, too, so they've both got the longevity thing going for them." Tony waves a hand vaguely. "The universe finds a way, you know; all that romantic, existentialist junk.  They have a cat now, apparently; it's all very domestic."
Still: "Shame we lost the booze," Tony offers blithely to her counterpart and herself, eyeing the shattered remains of the decanter lying on the gravel in the neutral zone. (She's only half kidding: Tony, and thus presumably her counterpart, is much better at negotiating ceasefires when she isn't sober.)
"Yeah, that's fine," Tony says, waving it away as she backs up back into the bathroom, "I've used my fair share of foreign bath products."  Man-Tony looks nostalgic, and Steve raises one wry eyebrow.
"You're such a disgusting morning person," she mutters while she levers herself up in a futile attempt to speed the wake-up process; her side twinges, and she grits her teeth and willfully ignores it it.  Steve, obligingly, scoots up just enough that Tony can sit in his lap, her legs splayed out on either side of his trim hips.  His thumbs stroke the jut of her hipbones while she rubs her eyes with her fists, bed headed and grumpy, and waits for her brain to come fully online.
Tony immediately deflates, anger evaporating in the face of his earnest declaration.  She stares at him with a look of disgruntled annoyance, aware that he's blatantly manipulating her weaknesses.
jackass," she jokes, shooting an amused look at her counterpart, who's been standing at his workstation across the lab and trying to pretend he isn't listening.
"Okay, okay, that's enough; we've had our fun--Steve, you're free. Go on, we'll stop fucking with you," Tony says between laughs, grinning at her bemused fiancé.
a nightcap," Tony tells them all drily, raising her voice to be heard above the wind as she touches Steve's trapezius fondly.  Better to pretend she didn't notice anything odd, than to react to the accusatory undertones in Not-Steve's question.  Bringing it up now would only create a divided front.
"The sooner I start going through spell books, the sooner I'll find it," he's saying, voice moving from the foreground to somewhere over to her left.  Tony can't really hear him over the strange, staticky noise rushing in her ears.
Tony considers the profile of his face while he looks into the fireplace.  She specifically brought him here because this is the best room in the tower for sex--besides, of course, her bedroom, but that can come later.  Right now, she leans over to carefully, gently, set her drink on its coaster, and then slowly leans back, catching his attention.  He's got an eyebrow raised, looking at her with a question in his eyes.  God, he's so hot.
"Cheers to genius," her counterpart declares after pouring them a finger of brandy each. Their glasses clink, and the sound of the crystal rings as Tony tosses back her head and drinks half of it down in one gulp.
"You feel so good," she mumbles into the sheets as he thrusts carefully in, pressing back to meet him until he's in all the way to the base, hips pressing up against her ass in the best way.
"Look at me," Steve urges as his eyes bore into hers.  Tony resists her body's instincts and does, panting and blinking wildly and feeling hopelessly vulnerable as Steve's blue, blue baby blues stare into her.  She can practically feel her heart welling up beneath his gaze.
Then, every other Avenger currently staying at the Tower pours out of it and onto the empty rooftop, battle-ready and with weapons and/or powers bristling--including two Steves, both wielding their shields.  Before anyone can do so much as blink, they've fanned out in a rough semicircle formation around the elevator like a well-oiled machine. They shift like predators once they're in their positions, five sets of eyes (and, Tony's certain, every single one of JARVIS's cameras) trained on the unknown and potentially hostile element, the intruder in their territory: Doctor Strange.
Understanding pours down Tony's spine like ice-water at those five simple words, combined with the muted sorrow in Thor's golden face.  Steve's hand on her shoulder squeezes.  Tony swallows, then reaches up and covers it with her own.
"The first time we met, I bled on your armor," Steve reminds her pointedly, then before Tony can react, he swoops in to nip playfully at her neck.  Tony jerks and squeals in surprise, then laughs in delight as his growing stubble tickles against her skin.
(Chapter also more than slightly influenced by my realization that, canon holding true, shit will be hitting the fan and canon Steve and Tony will be Civil War-ing the living shit out of each other like immediately after this fic ends, so that's fucked up and very upsetting and now has to be worked in.)
"Yeah, okay, hot stuff; you've made your point.  Let's get down from the ledge before we plummet to our deaths play-wrestling," Tony says maturely, because she is actually the responsible adult in the relationship.  Nobody ever believes her, but it's true.
With a fluid motion of his hands, a bright, sparking portal opens before them above the glossy floor.  Beyond its fiery borders, it appears to lead into the hallway of some well-appointed mansion. Strange smiles once more at all of them, tips his head, and with that, he and his voluminous cape stride through the open center of the circular portal, which spirals quickly closed behind him before vanishing with one last fizzing pop.
do not start getting jealous of me.  Believe me when I say that being jealous of yourself is already enough for me to handle."
The lab, other than being 1.5 times bigger, looks pretty much the same. She can hear some kind of welding or metalwork going on further in, so clearly someone's at home, which makes it doubly rude that he locked her out.
"Apparently," Tony begins, "that sparkly portal?  Leads to another dimension.  One where soulmates aren't a thing."
"Who are you?" Steve asks finally, breaking the silence.  These strange, new Avengers all stare at her.
"Watching your ankles," Steve confirms as he sidesteps neatly into the kitchen doorway, safely guarding her tarsi from further abuse.
"I hope that's for me," she murmurs against his lips when she brushes his erection with her hips, and he huffs a laugh.
hard to prove to both Bucky and himself that he didn't need to be some shrinking violet, standing on the dock by the ship and waving a damp handkerchief.  The way Steve figured it, the Army was always happy to take on a soldier without words: less worry or heartbreak if there wasn't someone waiting at home when the bad news came.
Bucky runs his hands over his mouth and looks out over the cityscape, contemplating. "Well," he says eventually, "I guess that makes some sense, considering we're supposed to be soulmates."
Bucky's eyes crinkle at that, a little smirk forming on his lips. "Yeah, well, I could always tell you were a real bastard."
"Did you get any footage of the portal that dropped me off here?" Tony asks finally with a strange feeling of...not quite resignation; it's a little more positive than that.  Acceptance, maybe.  That's the best word she can think of.
" Clint says again, and Tony feels déjà vu as the whole scene flashes by, word for word, just as she remembers.  They watch as her displays flicker; the recording quality isn't the best, with all the interference, but it's good enough.  They watch until she gets pulled into the vortex and everything goes black.
"You can probably fast forward to the end of the battle," Tony says quietly in real life, making everyone jump.  They all stare at her for a minute, and she stares steadily at the screen where Steve's smiling at her fondly through the cowl, wind forcing his pretty blue eyes to squint as the buildings fly by behind him. "You've seen enough of this part."
He soldiered on and finished his mission, took down the plane and all the bombs, all the Red Skull's remaining threats, with it, and as the Arctic water burned on his skin and the cold brine of it seared through his nose and into his lungs, Steve closed his eyes.
a 'why,'" he tells them, sinking into Man-Tony's expensive furniture as if he's sat in it a million times. "Whatever or whoever sent you here could have had no reasons, or any reason at all," he explains, lifting one hand apologetically.
The other X-Men are already in the fray. Thunder booms, and out of the corner of his eye, he sees Peter rip a bot in half before he and Kurt vanish in a cloud of smoke.
He jumps up too and in turn cups his own face and then points both of them to the hammer in his hand. ”Since when?!” is all he manages to crook out, and Steve lift an eyebrow, clearly surprised that this is where Tony’s concern lays even when he’s familiar with the hammer’s concept — and therefore, with the power it holds.
The screens filled with formulas and illustrative pictures appear over his desk. He leans back in his chair, hands behind his neck as he reads over the descriptions for the nth time, after a while asking Jarvis to open his notes from the night before and getting into work.
Tony watches his adorable confusion with facing the modern coffee maker every morning, for gods sake, he isn’t gonna force Steve into anything he isn’t completely, 100% comfortable with.
”At once, sir.” Tony lets out a happy, pleased laugh. ”Long time no see, buddy.” Steve has to bring his right hand to rub his eyes, suddenly feeling really tired. Is Jarvis behind this? Did Tony insult it, him (Steve’s very confused by the concept of AI still, has no idea what to call him. It?!) and Jarvis took his revenge by making DUM-E hit him in the head or something? He shakes his head and walks deeper into the room, watching Tony look at the tape intensely. If he had called the medics the moment he realized Tony wasn’t okay they’d probably be here by now…
It takes a while to realize that the feeling of someone kissing him isn’t a dream, it’s the thing pulling him away from the dream.
He plays around with random ideas well into the am-hours. When he catches himself yawning, it makes him check the time: half past two. It isn’t even remotely late in his standards but he decides he’s done for the night anyway, not having made any remarkable progress in the last hour or so.
Steve looks the man sitting on the couch over again. He’s so much like the Tony he knows, and yet so different; he’s clearly older than the Tony Steve’s used to, he realizes it now, but not from his physical appearance as much as his… glow. He clearly still has trouble listening and being present to others when he’s focused on something, and he still has some of that edge that Steve’s grown to like, but something about him is, indeed, gentler. He has lines at the corner of his eyes but the don’t make him look old, they make him look loved and like he has laughed and smiled a lot.
After the wedding photos there are clearly ones from their honeymoon, some of which were very candid. Tony feels almost dirty looking at such private photos, but then again they do feature him and his boyfriend, so…
Steve stares at him for a moment confusedly before letting out a nervous laugh. ”What are you talking about?” Tony takes a deep breathe, running his hands through his hair. ”I’m not your husband.” Steve doesn’t still look convinced but pushes himself further away on the couch so that he’s sitting next to Tony’s legs now, not laying on top of them.
Ever since after the attack on New York six months ago Tony has made it his mission to figure out teleportation using the operational model of the Tesseract. He doesn’t buy Thor’s opinion of it being ’simply magic’ and so forth something that humans weren’t capable of recreating; everything in the universe is math when you brake it into small enough pieces, and math follows certain rules of physics. This ’magic’ is simply math that hasn’t been figured out yet, Tony’s sure of it, and he has never been one to shy out from a challenge.
Tony isn’t bitter in the slightest, really. Beginning of every relationship he has had during his forty years has started more or less like this. And in those relationships his partner hadn’t just woken up after 70 years on ice. He knows Steve has a lot of stuff to figure out, he isn’t even a year into 21st century and so much has already gone down in those odd few months up to now. The possible gay panic Steve’s dealing with is certainly on the bottom of the list of being attacked by
Maybe it isn’t traditional or as romantic as the exciting atmosphere the city has in the weekends, but it works for them for now; Steve doesn’t have schedules on Mondays since he usually works the weekends, flying around the world preventing crime with Clint and Natasha, and Tony has talked Pepper into organizing his goings so that he’s always free too. It was fairly easy to organize, and certainly a reasonable request when it came to Tony’s occasional whims, leaving Pepper as pleased as he was.
There’s a photo folder around his eye-height which draws his attention. He reaches for it and it feels weirdly real. He doesn’t let it bother himself as he opens the book. His breath is caught in his throat from the first page, already; it’s a picture of him and Steve, taken by the latter. Tony himself is kissing his cheek and Steve’s clearly laughing.
”On the… On the lift. You know, ride it with you. The lift. So, in conclusion, really just take the lift with you. But I’m not. Cause I’m going downstairs.”
”Can’t wait for our date. Have a nice day honey!” The bearded man kisses his forehead for a final time before standing up and walking away.
”Steve, my darling,” Tony interrupts his train of thought again as he takes his hands to his. His voice is warm and he’s speaking slowly, like he fears Steve is not in a condition to understand. ”We have been married for seven years. We have three children. Harvey, Peter and Morgan. Remember them?” he says with his face a mixture of worry that he tries to hide as amusement.
”Good morning, honey. I’m so sorry to wake you up but you have that meeting with Pepper today and I promised you wouldn’t be late. I’ll make it up to you tonight, I promise.” Steve has pulled out from his lips just enough to say that and wink,
”Tony, listen to me,” Steve interrupts him, hands in front of himself like he’s afraid Tony will near him again, ”I really, really like you, and I think this has been going really well, but we have been dating for few weeks. If this is some Tony-esque way of telling me you want to… I don’t even know, get more serious, or actually have kids? I’m just not ready, I’m sorry if this is going too slowly for you but I thought-” It hurts to think Tony doesn’t have the patience for him to work things out, but he can’t really call him out for it, either. ”I’m just, not in the mood to even joke about this right now, Tony. I’m sorry.”
Tony hasn’t even realized he’s hyperventilating before the AI points it out. He tries to sit up straighter and shake his head clear but it doesn’t help to make the situation any more coherent. ”Am I awake, not-Jarvis?” It’s silent for a while again, and Tony has no doubt that if a robotic voice could sound concerned, this would be it. ”Yes, mister Stark. You were woken up 37 minutes ago by your husband.”
does have a nice ring to it, that he has to admit. ”Right. Where am I?” ”You are in Avengers tower’s top penthouse apartment, the Stark-Rogers Residence, in New York, New York, United States of America, planet Eart-” ”What time is it?” ”It is currently nearing twenty to eight in the morning, sir, the date is 14th of May 2023. Would you like to know the weather too, mister Stark?”
”The three of them, they… they adore you. Peter is practically your shadow, he doesn’t wanna leave you out of his sight. You’ve began to teach Harvey about physics and machinery already and he loves it, you spend hours in the workshop just building stuff and Peter’s there whining about wanting to be included but since he’s too little to build anything himself you and Harvey usually end up building stuff for him. And Morgan… You two give me grey hair with your shenanigans. She has you around her pinkie so tightly, I’ll have you know,” Steve says and doesn’t look even a little upset over it. Tony’s heart is clenching.
”You are a wonderful father, Tony,” Steve repeats, ”you never lose your patience with them. You’re always there for them. Just like you’re there for me, cause somehow you manage to be both an amazing dad but an amazing husband too.” Tony honest to god blushes, and wow, he can’t remember the last time that happened.
”Print me a model, J.” ”At once, sir.” Adrenaline filling his veins, he almost falls over when he stands up too fast, his hands shaking as he walks to the 3D printer in the corner of the room. He stares at the machine, waiting impatiently for the model to be finished.
She's thought about it a couple times since their arrival, but she doesn't know how she'd be coping, if Steve hadn't shown up here, too. She'd probably still be shackled to a bed.
On the surface, Steve looks long-suffering, but after a few moments, he cracks, and the twinkle in his eye and the twitch at the corners of his mouth give him away. He shakes his head anyway to maintain the illusion and says gravely, with an air of fake disappointment, "You're a mess, Tony."
But Steve doesn't give her any time to think: he's already back on her, body pressing hot against her as he reinitiates the kiss.  Tony moans and melts, her body arching up to press against his as her mouth and legs both fall open to welcome him.  Steve slides a hand up under her shirt and thumbs her nipple; Tony feels him smile against her lips when she twitches and squeaks, his touch light and teasing as he traces her breast.
"Yes, I would imagine that's why we're not together here," Tony confirms, stretching underneath the sheet like a cat. "Seems like all the testosterone has only enhanced my already sparkling personality."
"Of course," their friend offers graciously, well-spoken as always.  His eyes glimmer bright with their usual vigor and curiosity, but...
"Good morning," Steve murmurs.  His expression is soft but his eyes are alert.  He's obviously been up a while.  Tony blinks up at him slowly while she processes that, then scowls.
"Taking care of you makes me feel better," he tells her simply.  Tony heaves an exaggerated sigh and allows him to tuck her into a hug.  It's not like she can't say
"Mmm, after," Steve decides, turning his head and giving a gentle nip at her wrist before he visibly turns himself back to the question at hand, straightening up underneath her on the bench.
He's about to say something, but before he does, Tony has business to attend to--and by business, she means Steve's dick.  In her mouth.  She slithers right out of his grip and down onto the floor in front of him, shoving his knees open as she goes.
(In Afghanistan, they told her to shut up plenty of times--but never that particular combo. That fact was a relief, and she clung to it, afterwards. She might've had an arc reactor where her sternum should be, but at least she wasn't a terrorist's soulmate.)
With that in the air, they fold back into each other desperately.  Tony clings to Steve tightly as he thrusts back into her; her nails will probably leave marks on his back like crescents, but she can't bring herself to care.  Considering the way he's wrapped so tightly around her when he's normally so gentle, so careful of his strength, she knows he probably won't care, either.
"Yes, Ma," he replies, swabbing his face roughly before leaning in to kiss her again.  This time, she obliges, meeting his lips sleepily at first, but as the minutes pass she feels more and more alert, stretching catlike against his body and returning the kiss enthusiastically.
Tony and Steve's entrance on the main floor is greeted by some fairly awkward silence.  Tony, unintimidated and fully aware of her own sex-tousled state, gives the assemblage a once-over.
"No, no--please, feel free," Doctor Strange suddenly insists, hastily interjecting before Tony or Tony can protest. "Don't stop on my account."
The door chimes softly and opens, admitting one Steve, who looks around with mild curiosity as he enters.
"Yeah," she croaks, taking a moment to enjoy his warmth against her bare skin.  When she's done, she blinks through her heavy, wet eyelashes and looks at him again.  Her lip wobbles, and it takes an effort not to cry.
"Pop quiz, Bruce," Tony says to begin her explanation. "Who does Tony Stark hate more than anyone else on Earth?"
"Yeah, Tinkerbell, I would," Probably-Male-Tony grinds out as if it costs him something, "if you hadn't put--ugh." He covers his eyes with his hand; Tony feels deeply envious. "Look, I'm gonna level with you.  I couldn't get past the firewalls."
"Go eat a sandwich," Strange quips drily, his eyes crinkling subtly at the corners. "Doctor's orders. I'll be back when I know more," he tells the group at large. Then, he turns, cape billowing majestically, to face the empty half of the room.
"Mister Stark asked me to inform you that Thor has returned," the AI says politely, smoothly relaying the message.
Predictably, by the time they get to New York, it's all gone to shit. Some kind of new alien robots are absolutely wrecking the city, as per a normal Avengers Tuesday, but there's a fuckton of them and damn if the Avengers don't need some help. Poor bastards.
"Sandwich," Steve says very firmly just above Tony's shoulder, re-grasping her hand in his. "Then, sleep."
to interject with any untimely and potentially offensive Harry Potter references, and maintains at least the
good within her, stretching and filling all the empty, aching places inside her that were just waiting to be filled.  She feels endlessly relaxed underneath him, hazy and floating in a sense of good and right.
"He should, if for nothing else than for his own peace of mind," Tony interjects, glancing at Steve drily.  He looks somewhat disgruntled, but mostly he just rolls his eyes, so Tony knows he can't be too mad.
Tony goes, feeling strangely off-kilter, and lets him lower her down to the pillows before he looms above her, elbows bracketing her body on the bed.
"Tony," Steve murmurs lowly, his voice less than an inch from her ear.  Tony shudders, deep and full-bodied; she bows back, and, like he was waiting, Steve's strong arms lift and close around her.
"Get her a sandwich and a Gatorade and she'll be back to normal," Doctor Strange adds from about the same area as Bruce. Two doctors here to tend to her momentary physical embarrassment; Tony's such a lucky woman.
Yes, Tony still has his arc reactor because reasons; idk, just ignore like the last 5 bullshit minutes of Iron Man 3 or something.  Tbc, since this unholy creation seems determined to exist.  Yay-we-didn't-die relieved sex accompanied by a rating change is incoming next chapter, yaaaaaaay!
"That reminds me," Steve contributes as he clears the empty bottles away, tossing them into the recycling chute under the sink (same place it always is). "Where should the two of us plan on staying while we're here?" He shoots Tony a wordless glance, and she raises her eyebrows guilelessly: she woke up on a Hulk-restraint bed.  Like she said, she doesn't think he'll kick them out, but she has no idea where he intends to put them while they're taking up his space.
Steve--Steve shudders and leans into her palm, presses his cheek against her hand with his eyes pinched closed.  When he opens them, they're as wet as hers.
She's struggling to figure out her counterpart's motivations for putting them here, in this specific suite.  Maybe it's because her body's still devoting most of its resources to digesting the chicken sandwich, but Tony finds herself stuck in a strange, senseless feedback loop of confusion, her brain running through endless circles of logic.
"What gives?" she asks with that distinct deep-throating crackle in her voice.  His hands on her head are keeping her from getting back to business, and her fingers twitch where they've settled on his thighs out of respect for his wishes.
"Alright, kids; what do we want on our sandwiches," Steve asks drily, opening the fridge with the air of someone who's long since accepted he's the only adult around here.
"Look, I'm not here to judge you--" He snorts; Tony barrels on, "--no, honestly, I'm not, really. There is nothing I'd love more right now than to get out of your hair so we can both get on with our lives, but I think we both know that at this point, it's not going to happen. So can we maybe, I don't know, make some sort of truce, or something? Look, I don't hate you;
Tony, supine and now feeling the warmth of the brandy she threw back minutes ago seeping into her veins, takes in the stare-down in the gritty, atmospheric lighting of the rooftop with the same magnanimous air she imagines a queen might have had just before watching a royal joust. Her eyes rove over to the other side of the roof, and she idly takes stock of her teammates.
"Well, I'd hate to give you anything less than full credit for your efforts," she replies, twining her noodle-like fingers through his hair.  He chuffs affectionately into her shoulder, and Tony floats for a moment as they rest quietly, relishing the warmth of the afterglow.  Tony continues to run her hand through Steve's hair, fingering it idly as the wheels of her brain come back online and the gears begin to turn.
"Awesome, I thought I remembered that correctly," Man-Tony says delightedly, visibly pleased with himself.
"So, what do we do now?" Tony asks seriously, and watches as Steve instantly sobers at her change in tone. "We need a game plan, Steve."
Loki's smartly got his hands up, so she lets Natasha and SHIELD land their ship, handle things, and immediately attends to the very important task of panicking over the extremely fit and extremely wounded national icon at her six. As usual, her mouth is on autopilot.
Steve reaches behind himself and pulls out a large plastic shower caddy, quirking his eyebrows in amusement when Tony gives the nearly twenty bottles inside of it a disbelieving look.  "Our generous host thought I might want something a little less... floral."
"Uncanny, isn't it?" she says lowly, looking over at her counterpart where he's putzing around the opposite end of the lab.
Tony's words had been a cause for panic, when she was born. No multimillionaire wanted their kid to have words that reeked of violence--and kidnapping, to make it worse.
"I think there's some leftover chicken in there," her counterpart says. "Or that may have been last month; I'm not really sure," he adds, shrugging like he can't be bothered to remember these things.
So, at the age of sixteen, Steve decided to stop being hung up on destiny, and resolved to move on with his life while he still had one to live.
Tony moans long and feels herself clench around his fingers.  She arches her back and babbles, a nonsensical litany of "please" and "Steve" and "
He told Bucky so once, when they were seventeen and drunk off their minds in an alley on some whiskey they'd nicked from a corner store down the block.
"Hey, lovebirds," her counterpart calls out loudly, "Can we put the sweet nothings on hold for just a few seconds?"
" Tony says wretchedly as his lips slide along her skin, his nose brushing up against the sharp underside of her jaw as he pauses to scrape his teeth over the tender skin of her neck, the press just this side shy of biting.
"You're welcome," Logan says curtly. He unfolds himself from the couch and stalks out of the room. It'll just be more of the same shit if he sticks around; he can just see Kitty and Kurt independently gearing up to give him painfully earnest pep talks.
"What do you mean, 'unfortunately,'" Tony's counterpart says, looking visibly offended by the implication Tony's presence here could be construed as negative. His change in attitude, now that they're on the same wavelength, is actually kind of touching; he's gone from death threats to papa bear in less than twenty-four hours.  Normally, Tony would verbally acknowledge the emotional progress he's made--she's all about learning to reduce team-wide angst, which seems to be particularly abundant here--but: they're currently alone, suit-less, and have low to middling chances of being thrown off the Tower roof should combat ensue.
When Bucky died--when Steve watched his best friend and the only real companion he'd ever had fall from the side of a train--he had no idea what to do with himself.  Bucky was
Steve's looking at her in that soft sort of way he does, thumb running over her cheek gently.  Cheekbone, hairline, and back, over and over again.  The familiar rhythm calms her, and suddenly, Tony feels exhausted.
The first time he actually noticed it was after they got back to SHIELD's NYC HQ.  It's a telling sign of how completely he'd distanced himself from the idea he could have a soulmate.   In fact, when Steve first caught a passing glimpse of it through the mirror in the tiny bathroom attached to his new quarters, he thought it was just a smear of grime or dirt from the run.  Once he got closer and realized what it was, his heart stuttered for the first time since he'd had the serum.  He could've sworn his blood ran cold.
Steve (like he usually does when Tony employs self-deprecating humor) gives her a stern look, but it's ruined by the way the corner of his mouth twitches.  Tony smiles smugly at him and, inwardly, feels proud of herself for breaking his foul mood.
"Condoms?" she asks, quirking an eyebrow. "I'm on birth control, and I just got tested for STIs last month, so it's up to you."
"Only if you tell me what your other half thought she was pulling earlier," Tony says flatly.  Bruce's resulting flinch is satisfying.
Instead of thinking about it, Steve ignored the heaviness in his body, ignored the cold, empty hole Bucky's loss had opened up in his chest the same way he'd ignored it when he lost his mother, and he did what he always did when a tragedy happened during the war: he picked himself up, and he soldiered on.
"Alright, that's enough; stop it before you start ripping off each other's clothing," Man-Tony says loudly, breaking the moment and stepping in between them. "Having sex on my lab surfaces that doesn't include me is strictly prohibited."
what he thinks of this entire situation, swearing as violently as he can between breathless wheezes.
Tony stiffens on the bed, sitting up as much as possible despite the pain it causes her ribs.  She glares at the door as it opens, expecting Mystery Asshole again or maybe even Natasha, but instead another familiar face steps through.
Tony’s spinning in his chair, his mind rather far away from the work at his point as his AI makes the calculations. This is a long shot anyway, there was no way-
them to do that in front of him, but still) when someone grabs his bicep a bit too forcefully and turns him around. The moment he comes back to himself Steve already has him on a slightly crushing but most of all grounding hug. He whispers a relieved
Tony comes up from the workshop to find Steve sitting on the couch and staring at a wall. He coughs lightly to his fist to get his attention and when Steve turns his gaze to him he waves at him, trying to break the tension. ”Hi there. I figured out a way to navigate that thing, Jarvis needs an hour or something to print the piece we need. Just as an update, you don’t have to suffer me for long anymore.” Steve smiles politely at him and nods slightly, acknowledging he has heard but then turns back to the wall.
When he comes, Tony's not coherent enough to be excited.  He gives a final few thrusts and spills inside her with a groan, leaning over her and touching his forehead to her back as he comes.  She has just enough energy left to reach back with a shaky hand and pet his head, fingers threading through his sweaty hair as he shudders.
Many eyebrows are raised, as per damn usual, but anyone who ever expects Tony Stark to be anything less than the Head Bitch in Charge is either stupid or deluding themselves.
The suit whirs futuristically and the rest of the helmet clicks away as Stark kneels down next to him, already talking a mile a minute: "Oh dear sweet holy mother of God, that is a
As with all unfamiliar objects, the compulsion to study her counterpart and unravel all his mysteries is strong, even more so because he's
desire to have it in my mouth a second time." His bare feet are pressed carelessly against the edge of the countertop, speaking to how relaxed he is. "And I just had the bathrooms cleaned, so."
The elevator ride that follows is both awkward and cramped.  Man-Tony's elevator may be 1.5 times larger than Tony's, but it still isn't quite big enough to accomodate seven grown superheroes and one mystery wizard comfortably. In addition to the physical discomfort, Tony (who finds herself pressed possessively between Steve's warm side and the wall, because Steve a) refuses to let his guard down around an unknown, even if that agent is a teleporting magical sorcerer who may be the answer to their problems, and b) is still being
you, so, y'know--he's attractive," Tony admits to Steve's sternum. "My libido hasn't been this sad and confused since
The last thing she remembers before waking up to this shit is falling through that mysterious, sparkly portal.  Mystery Asshole said she fell from the sky--so, they probably found her wherever the portal dumped her out.
"J?" She tries to trigger him again, but she isn't getting any response. "J, you read me?" Goddammit.
.  Tony's anxiety ratchets up another several notches, her heart thudding against the arc reactor in her breastbone like a mallet.  Two feet step softly onto the shower tiles, and the door shuts quietly.  The sound echoes forebodingly in the space, like the turn of a key in a lock.
"Hey, Patriarchy," she barks at her counterpart, who jumps guiltily where he'd been trying to slink out of the room without anyone noticing. "You heard Scully and Mulder. You've been down in the lab as long as I have, so if I'm being forced to ingest comestibles right now, I think you should be, too. Fair's only fair, after all."
The wave crests and it all washes over her, waves of emotion and pleasure pushing her higher and higher in her spiral towards her climax as Tony just lays there breathlessly and takes him--
She can tell it's Stark Tower and not Avengers Tower because the tell-tale awkward elevator music she'd put in after reconstruction to piss off Clint is absent, which--freaks Tony out, some.  She tries not to fidget as Natasha and Not-Tony take her down in silence, to what Tony guesses is probably the lab.
"It's nothing, J," she mumbles quietly, pressing her eyes into her palms as her fingertips scratch through the edges of her hair, and focuses on ignoring the homesickness threatening to rise up in her throat like bile. "Just a thing we do as a gag, back home. Nothing you need to worry about."
"Starks keep irregular hours," Steve adds blithely, glancing at Tony over his shoulder with a knowing glint in his eye that makes her remember the many, many times he's come to fetch her from the workshop in the wee hours of the morning.  She blinks back at him obliviously.
"You know, it would be a real shame if I vomited right now," Man-Tony observes to no one in particular, peering into the depths of his Gatorade as he tilts back in his chair. "As much as I actually enjoyed that sandwich--props, Cap," he adds as an aside, glancing at Steve.  Steve raises his eyebrows. "--I have absolutely
"Me, too," he agrees, gently nudging her forward with the hand on her head, the other moving to touch her arm. "Come here."
"It's fine," he says, mouth quirking wryly before he adds, "I used to work at a hospital; I've seen it all."
Their voices fade behind her as she drifts aimlessly through the suite's small-ish den, past the long, floor-to-ceiling windows.  Tony stares out at the New York skyline and tries to actually
He's sleeping. Passed out cold in a lab chair--and good thing, too; he's got the kind of dark circles you usually only see on post-doc candidates and med students doing residency.
Tony, meanwhile, is speechless. The intensity of his hatred is like a sucker punch to the gut. It's so real, so unexpectedly visceral, that for a moment she has no response. Her words fail her. How the hell do you even respond to that kind of raw emotion?
"Sorry for the trouble," Doctor Strange offers somewhat apologetically from his own corner of the roof, looking a little bemused at the quick turnaround. "I just wanted to take a quick look at the portal site--duck in and duck out.  Didn't think I'd activate the night guard." Contrition and amusement war in his eyes as he watches everybody else shift around and grumble, the team going from visibly on-edge to visibly annoyed in even less time than it took them to be ready.
She takes a moment to lean back and eyeball him again (not that she wasn't ogling him in the suit, too, but cameras, even if they're
"See what I have to work with?" she complains, leading him over to the table. "Anyway, how's your suit looking?"
"Even if he were that interested, which I'm still not convinced he is," Tony begins, barreling on when Steve opens his mouth to interject, "Even if he
Soft sounds are coming from the bathroom outside the shower, almost inaudible under the sound of the stream on the tiles and the pound of Tony's heartbeat in her ears.  Her anxiety only increases as the long, unbroken quiet stretches on, but she doesn't dare turn around.  Instead, she stands there and carries on washing herself restlessly underneath the stream, even after water alone ceases to be effective.
"Nah, it's okay. I'm not really mad or anything," Tony says, waving it off. "It's not like I can't handle it."
Tony feels weak with the knowledge, shattered by the powerful swell of emotion she feels when she looks at him--at Steve--her
as her vision blurs and the world begins to spin but it all seems like it's happening in distant slow motion.  She sways, once, like a stalk of wheat in the wind, before her balance gives out and her legs buckle underneath her.
"Just over that, yeah," Logan confirms, idly admiring the way Bucky's hair curls at the nape of his neck. The guy's got a nice jaw; Logan can't wait for the beard burn that stubble's going to give him.
"I'll be right behind you," Steve confirms, steering her towards the elevators with a gentle bit firm hand.  He's using that tone that stubbornly brooks no argument.  He's about to do something brave--or stupid.
."  He curls his fingers up and rubs right up against her g-spot, making her twitch and mewl and nearly drool in his arms.  While he's working away inside her, rubbing slow and torturous, he puts his mouth back to work and starts licking gentle circles around her clit.
Now that the worst of the tension's been defused, there's a pregnant pause while all present parties quietly digest this new information, eyeing each other suspiciously.
"The Doctor says he felt a disturbance in the Force and came to help.  He's here to address our doppelgänger problem," her man-self adds almost belatedly, glancing over at Tony with an appropriately quirked eyebrow.  Tony feels the corner of her own mouth twitch in return.
With Steve's strength and a little bit of patience, together, they return her to her feet (the caveat being that Tony's still supported by his grip). She's wobbly as a colt, but she at least feels like she possesses some modicum of dignity when she tells Doctor Strange goodbye.
"No," Tony lies blatantly as she finishes drying off her forehead, giving up the pretense of subtlety: it's not her fault these pants make such an excellent sweat rag; she didn't give them to him, after all. Feeling brave enough to test her limits, Tony turns her head gently to the right and cracks open her eyes enough to squint up at Steve's face. She's sadly unable to keep herself from smirking when they finally do make eye contact.
With that, the last of the awkwardness hanging in the room finally dissipates. Man-Tony takes out a StarkPad from somewhere, and Steve gets started bustling around the kitchen, clunking through the new tower's cabinets and drawers with his brow minutely furrowed in concentration. Tony watches him putter around the island with a sense of fondness, her mind soothed by the familiar scene of Steve busying himself with cooking something or other. She watches him work, and while she does, she reaches up and quietly rubs her knuckles against the lower part of her sternum, trying to ignore the hole in her heart that doesn't seem to be going away.
After shoving her man onto the bed like some wild, pornesque huntress, Tony strips them both faster than Steve clearly knows what to do with.  She flings her bra and his shirt across the room while he laughs in disbelief, struggling to rip off his pants while he sits there and doesn't help at all.
"Unfortunately not, Miss," JARVIS says apologetically, and Tony closes her eyes, pressing her palms over them with a groan. "I believe there are some bathrobes in the bedroom closet."
Still drowsy, Tony hums and stretches languidly against Steve's body; he feels like a warm, well-muscled mattress.  She takes the opportunity to drop a leg in between his when he stirs underneath her, tangling them further.  Lifting her head is an effort, but she does it anyway and cracks her eyes open to stare at him blearily.
"Steve," Tony says, embarrassed by the way her voice cracks in the middle, but then Steve smiles wearily up at her and Tony can't hold it anymore.  She folds over Steve's dusty, dirt-covered chest with a sob and lets herself go, crying heavily into his battle-worn uniform in the middle of the ruined balcony as he slowly comes to.  She feels overwhelmed by profound, guilty relief, body shuddering with sobs that only worsen when she feels him place his gloved hand gently on her hair, reassuring her even though he's just been thrown fifty feet into glass and concrete.
"That's beside the point," she asserts as he begins walking towards the kitchen. "What if I had fought you? I have six black belts; I could have stabbed you in the eye with my fingernails. What if, with all your supersoldier strength, you had--wait. Hang on a second," Tony says suddenly, shoving at Steve's left shoulder to get him to turn around once she realizes something very important.
"Sure, I guess," Man-Tony allows strangely reluctantly, glancing over at her.  Tony (who has no time nor fucks to give to whatever existential crisis is surely going on in his head) just watches him blithely as he comes over and fiddles with the cuffs before they come off her with a click, leaving her to rub the red band around her wrists.
"You can wear my shirt, if you want," Steve says seriously, holding the aforementioned garment in his hands like an offering.
Tony sighs and shifts, inhales deeply and gives herself a moment to enjoy his warm, sleepy Steve smell (which is creepy as hell, she's fully aware, but y'know what, they're engaged, it's fine).  He somehow manages to still smell good, despite their ordeal, but underneath his natural, familiar scent Tony gets smoke and metal and concrete, a not unfamiliar mix: the smell of a recent battle.
"Only if I get to return the favor," he returns, pulling her bloody hands off his quickly scabbing wound. Tony doesn't even give a shit.
"--Tony," Steve says, scandalized, and simultaneously Man-Tony replies, "Well, I'd have to call Pepper first..."
She can feel Steve make a deep, low sound of satisfaction when she leans back and arches against him, murmuring words of encouragement that Tony can't hear over the sounds of the ragged, moaning pants he's fucking out of her as she reaches back blindly to touch him.  One hand settles on his head, grasping at the soft, thick, gold-spun threads of his hair while the other roves restlessly, stroking in jolts over his face and neck timed by the rise and fall of her hips.  She arches her neck against the curve of his collarbone and presses her mouth against his jaw, babbling her pleasure and breathing in the sweet, battle-tinged scent of him.  Her currently useless legs splay open on either side of his lap.
"Sorry; this...this is really not how I had hoped this would go," he admits, frowning through his impressively styled goatee. "I'm Doctor Stephen Strange, Sorcerer Supreme."
The body behind her shifts, moving in closer.  Tony's heart jumps as the air around her tingling back warms with a familiar heat.  His breath puffs hot against her neck, and every hair on Tony's body stands on end.  Arousal flares low within her, like a Pavlovian reaction.
close, but the other three rooms are all the way at the end of the hall, well away from the master suite and designed with an obvious emphasis on privacy.  Tony is very surprised her counterpart is putting them here, because in Tony's tower, this room is strictly Pepper's.  The only other person who uses it is Bucky, and occasionally Bucky's soulmate, and that's only after a seriously exhausting mission or a night of particularly heavy drinking.  No one else, not even Rhodey, stays in this particular suite.
They end up on a rooftop somewhere, Logan waiting for Ororo to finish her debrief with the Avengers, and his soulmate--Bucky--assuring him that he's clear to wander off.
Very, very slowly, and holding her breath, Tony peeks around the edge of the chair, using the same level of caution you might employ with an angry bear.
"Hey, Daddy Issues," Tony calls out to announce herself as she strolls inside. JARVIS helpfully closes and locks the door behind her.
Steve takes another step back, now his whole back against the fridge. ”…No?!” he says helplessly. Has Tony hit his head in the workshop? Is he under some spell? Is it Loki?!
He sighs as he enters the workshop, sitting down in front of his desk. Time for some engineering to get his mind off Steve’s ass. He does it so frequently nowadays he could probably start calling it a hobby at this point.
Tony has finally managed to get up from the (what he now realizes is not only kingsized but also clearly been used on the other side as well) bed. He takes cautious steps forward, half of him waiting for the floor to give out under him as this is clearly a dream. Nice dream, that he won’t deny, with a wet dreamy not-Steve that apparently thinks they have children, but dream nonetheless.
He’s surprised of some of the things that come pouring out of his mouth now that the dam’s been broken, and is instantly embarrassed over it. ”I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-” Without he gets to say more he feels someone taking his hand to his. He looks up to Tony and doesn’t find him weirded out or looking down at him with pity. There’s nothing but warmth in Tony’s smiling face and it moves something in Steve, and to his horror he feels tears forming in his eyes.
”Yeah, I know. This is mostly just… Well. I was really looking forward for tonight.” ”Hm?” ”I love our kids more than anything, I really do, but we’re almost never alone anymore and when we are…
Once Steve finally catches up to Tony (who isn’t a keen runner, doesn’t enjoy to do anything in a rush, except when he’s in this certain mindset, wanting to figure something out, and once he was, there was no way of stopping him). Steve is still by the door when Tony curses something in Italian before crossing his hands over his chest as he stops in front of the screens. ”Tony, what-”
Tony stares at him, eyes very much focused on the said lips. He’s super, super weirded out but also kinda intrigued. ”Well,” he starts carefully, getting Steve to pay attention to him again, ”if you really wanted to, I guess it wouldn’t
How do you even tell anyone about something like this? How to ease something like this into a conversation naturally without immediately sounding like he was trying to boast?
”What, so you had nothing else to do so you just started doing each other?” Steve shrugs. ”Pretty much, yeah. That’s how it started but pretty soon it turned into something more than just physical, which I’m thankful for everyday.” Tony hadn’t been expecting that and didn’t really know what to say. ”Nice,” was all he managed, blushing again,
Steve lays his hands carefully to Tony’s waist, the touch uncertain before leaning to peck his lips lightly. Tony leans into it but his hands are sandwiched between them a bit awkwardly, landing on Steve’s biceps and creating an angle where he has to actually lean a bit back to land the taller man’s lips. Meanwhile Steve has clearly misunderstood Tony’s weird posture as a silent request to pull back and while he does just that they somehow manage to bump their noses together in a very non-romantic way.
It’s late enough to be dark when they step out of the restaurant, Steve laughing so much that he nearly stumbles upon a stair, only being saved by Tony’s quick reflexes and throwing both of them into another set of giggles. The evening air is refreshingly chilly as they walk down the busy street towards Avengers tower, continuing the banter they’ve had going on the whole dinner.
Tony can’t hide his surprise as well as he manages to keep his slight fascination, half grossed out feelings on check. ”So you’re… You still… ” Steve looks at him waiting for him to go on and god, it’s not like Tony should be such a teenager about this. ”You know, I’ve just heard that once you get married and get kids and all that, things kinda, slow down in that sector. And I’m, yikes, over fifty already here, aren’t I?” Somehow discussing his hypothetical sex-life in the future becomes much more appealing when the opposing topic in his mind is falling into an existential crisis over aging.
Tony furrow his eyebrows. ”I’ve never heard of her, which probably means that hasn’t happened in my reality. I should probably call Fury.” ”Yeah, you probably should. Anyway, after that things chilled down really nicely here. There were only dumb humans to deal with instead of aliens. So we ended up having quite a lot of free time. Tony and me had kinda had this sexual tension before that, already, and one thing led to another and…”
So he pulls away from the kiss and puts his hands to Steve’s shoulders. Steve pulls away immediately, and Tony’s heart clenches when he sees the lost look on the blonde’s face. ”Wait, did I misunderstand? I’m sorry-” ”I’m not who you think I am.”
”It’s just-” He doesn’t get farther before letting out a frustrated groan, needing a moment to collect his thoughts. Tony just sits there, patiently waiting for Steve to be ready. ”Every time I think I’ve somehow got things figured out here, like, as in here in the future, something like this happens. And every time I tell myself that now I’ll be more prepared when it happens again. But I’m not. I’m always as confused and helpless and in need of guidance and that is just wasting everyone’s time. I’m scared I’ll never feel completely at place here, and that makes me scared to let myself get tangled in other people’s lives. Especially Tony’s.”
Mister Stark didn’t provide an answer. He isn’t sure if he wants to know the wether. He doesn’t know anything at all that moment except that he has to suddenly lay down again.
Tony stares at him for a long while, and Steve is getting more and more sure he has concussion as his eyes keep searching his face. Little by little Tony’s expression morphs from hurt to suspicion to realization.
It takes a moment for Steve to collect himself before answering. ”We wen’t to see that Harry Potter movie with young Dumbledore and I caught Tony lusting after Jude Law. I got a bit jealous but then I realized I could use that new knowledge to my own good if I grew a beard of my own.” Tony sent a silent ’thank you’ -prayer to whoever was responsible for making a bearded Jude Law come to their lives.
He walks to a bookshelf leaning against the same wall with the door that Steve left through. On his left there’s an open door to a spacious bathroom with a huge bathtub, clearly big enough for two people. What a weirdly specific detail, Tony muses and turns his attention back to the bookshelf. No harm in looking around for a bit before he wakes up.
He starts to chop the banana, humming some radio hit stuck in his head for days now under his breath as he suddenly feels hands on his hips.
Tony has been trying to draft a way to un-fuck this mess for some half an hour, but finally the pressing stare he’s been subjected to the whole time gets to him.
Once they’re inside, hidden from the street by the reflective glass in the lobby of the tower, Steve turns to Tony, suddenly shy with his hands in his pockets and clearly struggling to keep the eye contact but smiling nonetheless. This is always when Steve still gets the most nervous, the end of the date, so Tony isn't thrown off by it. ”Thank you for the dinner. This was really nice, Tony,” he says and how is it possible he’s blushing from this alone, he is so adorable, Tony’s heart isn’t going to make it-
He goes to the kitchen and pulls out some fruits from the fridge. He has decided that this will be the day he would overcome the mixer without having to wake up anyone to help him.
”Jarvis… Jarvis is a person now?” ”He is, indeed, now his own person by the name Vision Maximoff. You saw him just last weekend for Harvey’s 10th birthday party. Are you okay, sir?” Tony runs his hand over his face before blinking a couple of times. ”Yeah. Yeah, I’m completely fine, thanks for asking. Just one more question, Friday, was it? Who the hell is Harvey?”
”If this is a joke, I don’t understand…” ”This is going to sound really weird but bear with me, okay? I’m Tony Stark, I’m just not the Tony Stark you know. I’m from the past. And not even the past you know, apparently, but from another timeline completely.
”Of course he will. If this was my reality I’d do anything at all to come back, trust me.” Steve turns to look at him and a little smile makes its way to his lips.
”Isn’t that sweet? Young love and all that.” Tony curses himself as he turn to the married couple, now looking at them in turn, Tony’s hand around Steve’s waist possessively. He feels more than sees his Steve blush against his shoulder where he’s hiding from their eyes.
The taller man smirks and leans closer so that their lips are almost touching. Tony knows he should stop this, should tell this Steve he’s not who he thinks he is, but he’s frozen in place, unable to speak up. ”Or could it be so that you were just so eager to have the place for ourselves that you wanted to skip the dinner?” Steve bites his lip and let’s their noses touch. ”Can’t argue with that logic,” is the last thing he whispers before attacking Tony’s lips, and if Tony was speechless before he’s absolutely fucking stripped from any and all power to command of his movements now.
It also comes apparent why as Tony steals last glance towards the bearded Steve who has his eyes locked at his younger self, looking him up and down. Older-Tony notices too and grins. ”But hey, now that you know how to get here, don’t be afraid to drop by some time. Preferably when the kids aren’t here, not because I wanted anything weird but it might slightly confusing to them to have too sets of parents. But who knows, I’m up for the weird stuff too if you’re game. Foursome?”
That makes Steve smile a little. He feels a lot better already, and even though the thought is still slightly mortifying, he knows what this Tony is saying makes sense and is true. This wise, brilliant man that has all the best qualities of his Tony and then some more. He can only hope the Steve in his universe is as good for this Tony as he is for him.
In a sudden epiphany Tony realizes that those are qualities usually attached to him. Could it be so that he had actually been a good influence on Steve? Made him happier, more relaxed and more content? The thought sent butterflies down Tony’s spine.
Once the portal closes and they are alone again, Tony turns to his husband to find him still staring at the wall where the portal was, more specifically where his younger self had just stood. He turns to Tony when he feels his gaze and scoffs. ”What a prude!” he huffs, clearly annoyed, and Tony can’t stop laughing even when he presses his lips against his; the familiar feeling reminding him that there’s nowhere he’d rather be.
That somehow soothes Steve. At least some version of him has known how to take care of Tony, or at least been there to see him take care of himself.
worthiness after you’ve trespassed into my apartment?!” ”No, no, god, no!” Tony finally realizes Steve still doesn’t believe him and is holding a weapon with
Tony opens his eyes confusedly. He has kissed Steve enough times to recognize his lips, but it can’t be him. There’s something scratching Tony’s lower lip, almost as if-
He’s still staring at the man looming over him with wide eyes. The not-Steve giggles. ”I must’ve woken you up from deep sleep. How are you so cute this early in the morning?” Yep, that seals the deal. No way would Steve call him cute, at least without turning ten different shades of red in the process. This is some kind of a simulation. Or a fever dream. Or maybe Loki?
It’s a picture of him and Steve. They are clearly outside, and it’s summer, and the sun is making the trees behind glow beautifully. They are both wearing tuxedos, and looking at each other, and smiling, and this is very clearly a picture from their wedding. The next few pages are all filled with those, of them laughing together and being very clearly in love. There are many people with them; some of them Tony recognizes, most he doesn’t.
”Can I… Can I ask you something?” he stutters out. Steve nods, and Tony takes a deep breathe. ”Can you tell me about our kids?”
. Tony knows his own handwriting, there’s no question it wasn’t written by him. He stares at the picture, unconsciously brings the folder closer to his face. Steve’s holding a little girl in his left arm and has his right one around a teenager, probably somewhere between 10 and 12, and next to him is Tony himself with a maybe six or seven year old boy clinging from his neck on his back. They are all laughing at something.
”Hone- Steve,” Tony corrects himself from using the endearment and it makes Steve think he might have had a similar discussion with his Steve some other time, ”no one is expecting you to be perfect in everything. No on wants you to deal with this stuff alone, least of all me, okay?” Tony reaches to wipe off a tear from Steve’s cheek, and to his own surprise Steve finds himself leaning into the palm of his hand.
”I promised to drive the kids to school, I have to go so they won’t be late. I’ll drop them to Nat’s after school too so you don’t have to worry about that. We’ll see at the restaurant, yeah?” The not-Steve seems to be waiting for some reaction so Tony nods slowly, hoping it will be enough. The not-Steve smiles widely, so he takes it as a success.
Steve’s fresh from the shower as he walks through the living room where their weekly movie nights take place. He has already been to his morning jog but finds all the common rooms still empty, seemingly indicating that everyone else is still asleep or already on their way. He and Clint agreed to see at the SHIELD headquarters at 9 o’clock sharp, so he guesses he’s already there to set up their presentation to the new agent recruits.
It’s Steve’s turn to interrupt him. ”Are… Are you for real? This is not a joke?” He’s still all over his head but decides that so much unbelievable stuff has happened since he got into 21st century that this would be just another mess in the mix, eventually. That is more believable to him than Tony taking a prank on him this far, he realizes.
Steve doesn’t say anything for a while and Tony can only pray that he believes him cause he has no idea if the suits will answer his call in this reality, and if Steve decides to start to hit things, for example his head, with the hammer, it’s not going to be pretty.
”Jesus… Who the fuck are you?!” ”I’m FRIDAY, sir. I’ve been your AI system for a while now.” ”What- When- What happened to Jarvis?!” ”You, doctor Banner and doctor Cho combined your skill sets to create the world’s first completely artificial human in 2015. It was a historic event, sir, you received a lot of praise and recognition for it.”
It’s quiet for a second, Tony suddenly unsure if Steve’s waiting for him to lead him all the way to his apartment or waiting for him say something, or wanting to say something himself, or…
Steve stares at him for a while, blinking his eyes in confusion before he squints his eyes. ”Is it you, Loki? Look, I told you I was flattered but I love my husband very much and aren’t interested-” Tony sit up and points at him excitedly. ”That’s what I thought too! That’s the only logical-” He shuts up as Steve stands up and reaches his hand out to the air on his side.
”Tony, what are you talking about?” Tony pulls away a little to get a better look at his face but still holding his waist. ”Are you okay, honey?” Steve lets out a noise somewhere between a gasp and a slightly hysterical snort. ”Are you?! We don’t have kids!”
”Hey, it’s alright,” Tony says and scoots a little closer still so that they’re sitting next to each other now but still a polite gap between their tights, ”it’s okay to be overwhelmed. It’s okay to be lost, it’s okay to not be okay. But you should really talk to someone about it. Biggest problems arise from keeping things to yourself, okay, it’s much worse than crying.” ”But I’m the team leader! I have to be there for everyone, I don’t wanna add to their emotional package ’cause I need so much help just getting the laundry machine going!”
It’s silent for a moment before the woman speaks again. ”Harvey Stark-Rogers is an adoptive son of Anthony and Steven Stark-Rogers. He was saved from an orphanage fire during a mission little over six years ago by Captain America and has lived with his new parents ever since. He’s an older brother to Pet- Sir, your heart rate is going dangerously up. Should I call for aid?”
of sex during that vacation, but something in his eyes seems different in a very beautiful way. It makes Tony smile, even if it isn’t really his Steve.
He doesn’t have time to register what has happened when his replica has already ran to bearded Steve who’s standing up now, waiting for his husband with open arms. ”Baby, honey, darling, are you okay?” the 2023 Tony asks as he cups Steve’s cheeks, and the latter smiles, relief clear on his face as he leans down to let their foreheads touch. ”I am now,” he whispers before engaging his husband in a deep, passionate kiss his husband returns eagerly.
”What year is it?” Steve is exasperated. ”2012?” Tony’s eyes widen. ”Shit,” is all he mutters before he turns around and runs for the stairs leading to the workshop. Steve tries calling his name after him, getting really worried now, and has now idea but to run after him to make sure he doesn’t hurt himself.
He puts the folder down and picks up the one that was leaning against the first one in the shelf, but this time the shock factor comes in with the very first page.
Tony feels cold sweat starting to form all over his skin as he continues to stare at the children between them. He tries to muffle a slightly panicked voice in the back of his mind that’s reminding him of the study he read a while back which stated that human mind wasn’t capable of making up human faces, and yet he’s suddenly really sure he has never seen any of these kids before. And the girl especially looks too much like Tony to be some random kid he has just happened to bypass in the streets. Could it be…?
Steve pulls away from the hug and Tony is fully prepared to say one of his trademark snarky comments, has one on just the tip of his tongue when Steve leans to kiss him, too, completely catching him off-guard. He makes a surprised yelp but instantly puts his hands to Steve’s shoulders, not letting him pull away instantly like the last time. Steve doesn’t seem to mind.
”Yeah, okay, I think we’re done here. Thanks for working that out, by the way,” he says and points vaguely at the direction of the portal still rolling behind them. The other Tony smirks at him. ”No problem, kiddo. But please, for your own good, be more careful in the future.” Tony squints his eyes at him, not sure he was trying to make some dad-joke about their situation but it doesn’t really matter anyway, not when Steve’s lightly pulling his hand towards the portal and clearly more than ready to put this behind them.
”Since when what?” ”You’ve been able to operate that thing?!” Steve looks down to the weapon of a demigod in his hand and shrugs. ”Since I woke up from the ice? What do you know about it? Are you questioning
Attempting to clear his head he slaps his cheeks lightly and blows off some air before stretching his hands over his head. ”Jarvis, give me the tesseract blueprints again.” ”At once, sir.”
, and Tony’s body finally lets go of the tension it has been carrying around ever since waking up as he smells the familiar shampoo.
Steve’s whole face lights up and god, it’s so clear how much Steve loves them. ”We have three kids,” he starts softly, ”Harvey just turned ten, Peter is seven and Morgan three. The boys are adopted, Harvey when he was five and Peter a year after that, when he was four. With Morgan we used surrogate.” Tony nods stiffly. That’s why he had found he to resemble him. What a frightening thought. Which sends him right to his next question that comes out a bit hurried.
Tony let out a trademark, dashing Tony smile at that. ”I know things were different in the 40s but here it’s okay to show emotion, okay? And it’s getting better all the time in the future, too. Talking about it will help a whole lot, and you don’t have to lose stuff over not feeling completely in control all the time. It might even help you come closer to your team to show some insecurity, I know for sure it’ll make your Tony feel more at ease with you. Cause, and I’m sorry to be such a gossip girl, but he’s got it bad for you.”
But he also knows this is wrong, and he would never take advantage of Steve. Not even this Steve, not any Steve in any reality.
”Okay. One more question and then I’ll continue trying to figure out how to deal with this.” ”Sure.” ”This is a big one, Steve, and you don’t have to answer me if it makes you uncomfortable.” ”Okay? You’re making me nervous!” Tony took a deep breath, trying to calm his heart to prepare for the next answer. He cleared his throat and looked into Steve’s now worried eyes.
"I am not discussing my sexual urges with you, Barton," Tony says flatly.  Then, "In this universe," she amends.  Clint raises his hands placatingly.
"I guess I shouldn't have been surprised you wouldn't back down," he says, after a while. Tony huffs.
They nip up to the bar for a bottle of brandy and tote it up to the roof, on Tony's suggestion. She feels the need to be outside beneath the open sky, after spending so much time cooped up in the lab.
"I don't like being directed places," Tony informs Steve for about the hundredth time, and he chuffs, but he also used the I-can't-be-dissuaded tone, so, contrary to her smart mouth, Tony plays nice and allows herself to be ordered.
And he leans back and gives a full-bellied laugh, eyes clenching shut at the irony of the situation as something explodes in Captain America's direction.
"Remember to eat tonight, Stark," Natasha says before the elevator doors close, raising one well-shaped eyebrow threateningly.
"So." He removes his glasses and looks at Tony with that speculative gleam he gets in the lab sometimes. "From what we've seen, it seems safe to say you're from an alternate reality."
Before she even registers the change he's got her shirt around her armpits and his other hand down her pants, and Tony swears and bucks as he mouths at her nipple while his other hand ghosts over her clit, fingers dipping right past it to slip into her wet, wet folds.
Her gleeful squeal echoes off of the tiled walls.  Pepper has to have had a heavy hand in designing this room: Tony leans towards granite and chrome, especially for fixtures, but this place is a glass and ceramic affair, light, airy, and open.
"I needed an adult," Tony explains, just as Steve finishes her first sleeve and starts in on the second. "And also, clothes.  Steve can only help me with one of those things, so, here we are."
