"Aunty Nat!" he laughed, "You- youhoo-you cheater! No fair- hahah- you
he sighed happily.
However, to an Omega during heat, it felt like forever.
" Tony's voice wavered and Steve rubbed his arm reassuringly.
She wrinkled her nose as the scent wafted to her.
He gasped and sucked in a deep breath and pulled the arrow out from the mattress and duvet.
The genius looked disheveled in his PJs, but didn't seem to care. He stared at Steve.
Her boots clicked over the paving as she forced her way into Steve's space, making him flinch.
He tried for a smirk. Steve smiled back.
He let Tony teeter on the edge, but never let him drop.
"The funeral was a small affair... Only the team came, and Pepper, Rhodey and Happy. Stephen also made a brief appearance and…well, there didn't seem any reason for us to hate one another anymore… There was one thing he came to talk to me about, though. He said that Tony…"
Tucking Tony in with the softest cotton blanket, she gave a kiss on his forehead and quietly slipped out the room.
Tony was cuddled up to Steve's side (and was using Steve's bicep as his own pillow!) and Steve just used the arm tucked under Tony, to wrap his Little genius, securely against him, and gently stroke his baby's hip.
“I-“ he stopped short by the doorway and looked at the scene in front of him. Clint standing awkwardly by the kitchen island while Nat nestled Tony into her side with her arms protectively around him. Then, Thor smelt Tony’s pheromones in the air.
“Shh, shh, oh it’s okay, Omega. It’s okay.”
“And that’s okay, Tones. It’s alright. You’re not a disappointment. You are actually
“I love you,” he breathed tearfully, “And I wish you were still here.”
the soldier silently pleaded to whatever God could hear him. The pain of losing a comrade would be too much to bear.
Tony was, admittedly, a little fearful at first about the team coming by to try and cheer him up, but he could already feel the familiar giddy laughter flow through his body like a cool and crisp autumn breeze, carrying warmth. It felt
... he knew it was reality.
“No, what I
Steve held Tony’s hands in his own, bringing the man to his feet and leading him slowly to the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Got anything to say now?" he deadpanned, as Tony wriggled beneath him.
thoughts sprang forward ever so quickly, it was as if the excitement was never there to begin with in the first place.
I just thought it was something cute and relatable to us for this fic.
The only option was to make an appointment with Dr Stephen Strange, since Dr Cho was overseas mentoring a handful of Brazilian apprentices.
The week of Tony’s heat went by quite smoothly. A few days after Team Night at Nat’s house, Thor had come to apologize profusely, kneeling before Tony and swearing by Odin’s might that he will never disgrace himself against his team member again. A blushing Tony made Thor stand up and they decided on a forgiving bear hug- Tony loved Thor’s bear hugs, so he said it was all he needed for a fitting apology.
. I already messed up. I blew my chance. I went to see him once and I doubt Pepper will allow it again."
"Well, I kinda like that, don't you?" he teased.
Hanging like a ragdoll off of Steve's grip, Bucky gave a tiny salute back to Nat with an adorable pout on his face and she chucked at the two idiots.
Steve’s heart flipped.
The captain held his own aching cock in his hand and positioned it at Tony's entrance.
Everyone
But now all that’s left is silence
She looked up. The nonchalance he tried to throw over his tone caused Nat to smile.
how much I appreciate it!"
Steve rolled his eyes.
He just let himself be held by the emotional spy, smiling to himself.
He took Tony to his room, nodding to his mom in the kitchen that they would talk later. Sarah loved Tony. She and Tony's mother, Maria, had been best friends in college.
" the brunette murmured, "Can I keep you?"
“Is?” she asked quizzically.
Tony handed him the anti-septic, grinning. Before Steve could go any further, Tony's words made him stop and think.
"No, don't worry about it. I'm Steve. Nice to meet you Tony."
‘Be strong,’ he instructed himself, ‘Be civil. Short and brief.’
Little Tony's face scrunched up in thought for a moment.
All Tony could do was stare again.
And hearing how awful the flirtatious comment was, it made Tony then flinch in embarrassment!
Tony wasn’t Howard. He may have his father’s name and blood, but not his experiences. Tony went through hell. And Steve had been meaning to give more of an apology than that one handshake after Loki’s attack on New York, but as such with Nat’s frustration, Tony had always been so busy.
thing she expected to see.
The Rogers family would think nothing of it, though. And Tony loved them for that - more than his own father.
She glanced at the captain. Her hint was not at the least subtle, but there was no more time for formalities.
The city was wrapped in darkness. And the Avengers were doing no better. J.A.R.V.I.S had the heat up to seventy percent and still, everybody preferred to remain in each other’s company to keep warm. Blankets bundled around, everyone curled around each other while they continued their Harry Potter marathon.
Tony jolted at the sensation, moaning as the shockwave passed through his nerves. He began panting erratically.
“Doll, don’t worry your pretty little head about it. Just tell me where you last saw it and I’ll be sure to catch it.”
- I-“ Steve sighed. “I just… I was wrong to judge you, Tony and I’ve been meaning to give you a proper apology ever since the attack on New York… Please, you must know that I am truly sorry for those horrible insults I threw at you on the helicarrier. I judged you based on your name and your father’s impact on me. I didn’t even think to realize how different you would be from him.”
The cars pulled up to the starting line, engines revving. Natasha gave a respectful nod to Steve before placing her focus on the road ahead.
Steve placed his hand over the statue’s heart.
The open-floor plan of Steve's living room and adjoined kitchen was littered with sketch paper, stacks of canvases; pencils, charcoals and tubes of paint littered the floor! And watercolor paintings, shaded sketches and pastel artworks hung across the room from one side to the other, pegged on to washing lines!
He pulled at Steve's hair to bring him up for another kiss.
Once everyone was settled into the living room, and Nat and Tony came out with the food prepared, Thor beamed brightly and exclaimed, "Of course I love you all, my dear friends! And since tonight is especially reserved for showing dear Anthony our love, I can't imagine anyone here wanting to resort to violence as dear Clint explained."
And then, after a minute, Tony broke the silence.
Steve cheered along with his sweetheart babyboy - so happy to hear that hearty laughter! - as he gently swung Tony's body back and forth, along with his own, while pirouetting on the mattress like an idiot.
Amends are made between our alpha and omega.
She gently placed a hand to the side of his face, moving his head slightly to focus on her.
Looking up, Steve saw Bucky with his own tears in his eyes. He'd probably figured out, or he remembered what Steve did to him before this happened.
He couldn't bring himself to move anywhere.
Getting a proper look at the man he loved atop the kitchen island, Steve couldn’t help but giggle softly.
"Steve?" Tony murmured, hesitantly.
He knew Steve would outright beat his father to oblivion once he said the words, but Tony couldn't hide anything from the one he loved.
“It looks like someone is ready to start kicking butt!” Nat laughed.
"What in the name of-?" Steve muttered to himself.
The air filled slowly with tension once the elephant in the room was uncovered.
Tony laughed in spite of himself and followed Nat out of the living room to greet the team.
“Only because you’re my muse, Anthony Edward Stark.”
Steve continued to tease Tony as he suckled on the tip of the genius' rock-hard cock and gave small Kitten licks overTony's balls.
Steve whips up a deliciously sweet surprise for Tony as he comes home from work.
NOS had him flying again!
And then…
Steve fisted Tony's shirt. Without breaking eye-contact, he whispered, "Will you let me make love to you, my beautifully amazing Nick Wilde?"
on the same day, he had to retract his statement that he'd seen
"I was just busy doing my physics homework, Sir," he answered, keeping his tone neutral, his face expressionless.
And with that, Steve growled once more, crushing Tony’s mouth against his. And Tony laughed happily all through the elevator ride to their room on the third floor.
The little four-year old smiled bashfully.
He placed his hands in Tony's hair, massaging his head delicately... let his hands rub up and down his baby's shoulders to create friction and warmth...
It felt agonizing to watch as well. The Avengers were worried stiff. One teammate was in critical condition and their captain was working himself into a frenzy.
Steve found Tony at his worktable, clutching his arm.
Steve's entire seed filled Tony up and he dazily nuzzled Tony's chest as the brunette absentmindedly played with the blonde's locks.
“So, you’re not angry at me?”
Said blonde just stared blankly at the genius.
being the keyword there, Miss Romanoff,," Stephen retorted, "Even though that bond is there, it won't hurt to tell Tony that he has options - options that can make him happy as well."
He glanced up at the captain again.
went through their heat. The
He shrugged, smiling, "You can call me Bucky."
Tony’s whole face melted in a smile, a dusty pink blush covering his cheeks.
Natasha’s reputation as the most feared assassin and spy was not exaggerated. She was trained to read people. The dark and cool hardening of Stephen's eyes was not lost on her.
for the first time!
"Pouting baby away from his dessert?" Pepper teased, ruffling Tony's hair. With a groan, the man flopped back against the pillows, dramatically throwing his arm over his face.
Making her way to the front door, she feigned a scolding tone as she opened to let Tony in.
"Funny, I was just about to comment the same thing to you," a voice lightly chirped beside him.
But Tony soon began writhing on the mattress, looking for relief as the heat and flames built inside him once more, licking under his skin.
The next prompt is for the letter "O".
As quick as it had appeared, her icy gaze was gone and she was helping Steve up from the floor.
Neither one said anything.
"Touché," said Tony, marveling at the engine.
Steve’s forehead rested despairingly against the hardwood as his shoulders hitched with his quiet sobs.
Steve smiled, "Yes, and that's how
Steve surprised himself at how quickly he wanted to remember and file that information. What surprised him even more were the sudden questions his brain longed to ask Rhodey:
So, the next chapter will contain some light angst and will I'll maybe work on the draft later today or tomorrow, but I will be posting soon!
“Yeah,” she sighed, “But it seems like one of you is persistent not to receive my help picking up his mess.”
"Shh now, shh, it's okay... It's alright. Hey, it's okay. Nothing's messed up. You didn't mess anything up."
“You can come out now,” she suddenly said, making Steve jump.
He walked over to the coffee table on which a small heap was concealed under a blanket. Pulling the blanket away, Steve revealed a picnic basket.
she was going to "kill"!
win- it's just unfair strength," Tony pouted. Steve pecked his nose, "Says the man who willingly chose to date the football quarterback."
Tony laughed hysterically in bliss and clutched to Steve's front like a koala! (Arms secured around Steve's neck and legs were clenched around his daddy's waist).
But thank you all so much for sticking with this fanfic and leaving your kudos and invested comments. It really gives me motivation to continue this work. Hold thumbs - we're almost at the end!
The advantage was that Nat could still control her fluids’ makeup; her seed contained egg cells, so it couldn’t influence Tony’s body in the long term unless she decided it could.
“Hi Tony,” replied Nat, fond amusement in her voice. She paced a long kiss between his shoulders and began softly caressing his plastered curls away from his eyes.
"Need help?"
“Mmm… Hi Nat,” he murmured sluggishly, drinking in her warmth.
So Tony breathed in and continued, "They obviously
So I'm alive!!! 🎉🎉🎉😄😄 School is just a lot for me, so just bear with me on the days when I don't have the energy to write, but when I start something I love, I will finish it, but I just want to make it perfect💙

"I most certainly am
Tony continued, "Bring back what we lost? I hope,
"If you even
"No, Sir," Tony coughed, clenching through the pain, "I was just sloppy this semester, Sir."
Turning back to walk to Tony’s desk, he saw the genius clutching his arm, his teeth clenched in aggravation.
Arms around his protector ...
- but it meant home.
And Steve wasn’t too proud to admit when he was wrong.
A pause. A fading-in quiet.
Tony treated all life precious. Even Artificial life.
Alright, so, excluding that

on Steve. It made Tony’s eyes burn with tears - he was so conflicted.
And not a star could be seen twinkling in the blanket of blue and black. The sky splintered open with crackled tendrils of lightning as the rain pounded mercilessly against the windows and rooftops of the suburb.
Tony sighed.
“Oh! You’re home early,” he came around the kitchen island and placed a kiss on his love’s cheek, “And speaking of muffins, you’re in for a treat!” The soldier winked, but then gestured sheepishly to himself, “I’d, uh- I'd love to give you a hug, but you’d get dough and pumpkin on your shirt.”
Tony tried to heave in deep breaths, but they wavered at his chest.
This was the longest time Loki’s magic had ever affected the genius and Steve was more than worried.
“You don’t want me anymore, Steve,” he whispered more to himself, but Steve could hear it through the door. His heart cracked even further.
Tony’s face heated.
Hey everybody!!! I'm feeling so pumped with energy, I just had to finish my next chapter in this fanfic and I'm working on the next one as I'm posting this.
The sensual moans and grunts flooded Tony’s ears as he stood frozen to the spot and he feebly wrapped his arms as tight as he could around his mid-section. He tried to keep his body from shattering into glass pieces. The air was fully knocked out of him. He felt so dizzy and confused.
Steve wasn’t going to lie- he was a little
Wanda leaned over and pecked Nat on the cheek, “It’s okay, Hon. Go on now and take care of Tony.”
The blonde's shoulders were stiffened and tense. His back was ramrod straight. His face was twisted and pulled in, like he was trying not to cry on the verge of a stressful breakdown.
Steve chuckled, blushing, "Yeah, I - I did, yeah. Oh, you should hear Nat; she calls it my
loved by many. And your daddy… Your daddy loves you so very much. His appendix just didn't make it possible for him to stay here long enough to say it to you. But he loves you... and he was the love of my life… "
"Yes," he whispered, putting as much sincerity as he could into his voice, "Only for you, Tony."
"Daddy!" Tony laughed happily, "Yay, Daddy I'm flying! I'm flying!"
“Come on,” he continued, “I’ll make you a smoothie and then we can watch you lose your cool over some dumb stunt video fails on YouTube.”

Tony's gaze was curious as well, as if he couldn't believe Steve asked that question.

, Honey,there you go... There you are, it's alright.
Tony didn’t move. He didn’t get up. Not yet.
"Oh my God, you must be freezing! Why did you- Why didn't you call? What happened? I- Tony?"
"You... you don't have to say anything," Tony interrupted, shaking his head, "I just need help with my stitches, if you're still comfortable with it."
She pecked a kiss onto his forehead. Her tone turned playful, "So you wanna get up from the floor now, Antoshka? You wanna go curl up all nice cozy on the bed? Huh? Come on, Sweet Omega, let's get up and I'll take care of you."
"And I know I'm asking a lot, but
Even female betas and alphas had the genetic ability to change their reproductive body parts in order to be compatible with their omega partner to take care of him/her  during heat.
And yes, sawdust and marshmallows are exactly what I think Steve/Chris Evans smells like-I don't take any criticism!
"Shh, baby, I'll make it good... I'll take care of you, I mean it"
"I've loved you since I could talk," he murmured.
Tony bowed his head, ashamed.
Tony's heart leapt at the thought.
It's survised to say that Tony couldn't stop crying huge tears of joy - for probably five minutes straight! - the next morning as Steve presented his gift over breakfast, with a life-size version of the painting portraying, in beautiful calligraphy and watercolor patterns, Steve's words of love:
his gaze seemed to say.
I feel like I should be posting a chapter a month, since it seems to be the pattern here😅
There was Steve and Bucky standing in the doorway, covered in mud and grime, but smiling goofily like complete idiots at the love of their lives!
“Daddy!” he whined.
Steve's hands reached for Tony's for a brief moment, but then pulled back as if burned, realizing the intimacy of the gesture.
" he whined, "Are you
Steve wondered if Morgan understood what that really meant. She most probably did, since she was Tony’s child.
Catching up with Steve, they both climbed into the Merc, leaving the world of racing behind for the night.
Tony smiled, blushing and cuddled close into Steve's chest, settling down to sleep.
, are you?"
The sound echoed off of his bedroom walls.
Yes! I know! I did it! I actually did it and I regret absolutely nothing!
"I- I really don't... don't wanna know... how fast it took you to... aim for both of them!"
“Mmnf, yeah Buck?” the alpha moaned in ecstasy. He loosely untangled his limbs from Barnes and stretched out his limbs lazily.
“There we go,” he smiled and then turned to address everyone, “Now, it has come to my attention that Tony has indeed contracted Alpha Detachment, or A.D for short. Now, coming directly into contact with Steven Rogers after so many months of separation has caused his Omega gland and hormone in his brain to go into overdrive. And combine that with his severe anxiety, I’m afraid... I'm afraid that Tony has indeed gone into a A.D-stated coma.”
to see the genius!
That earned another eye-roll from the captain.
He needed to know that his Daddy was real. And healthy. And close.
” Steve screamed.
And sad memories to keep
“No, I just said that by tomorrow, Tony would’ve made something grand and beautiful for Nat, to make it up to her,” Rhodey replied calmly.
“Hey, um, would you mind if I picked you up?”
At those last words, Tony pulled away, cleaning his face.
"You know, I actually may have a theory," Stephen mused into the silence. Flicking up an eyebrow, it gained Nat's interest.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Oh no, I’m
Steve smiled warmly, leaning down on his knees with his arms wide open.
The whole process only takes about six minutes to form and to dissipate once more, once the intimate course is finished.
"I guess that all comes down to
Laughing lightly, Tony saluted, turning around on the hospital bed, his back facing Steve once again.
The captain breathed out deeply, folding his hands in his lap.
It was Tony who ultimately broke the silence, though. A smile formed on his tired face.
“Well, if that’s all then I guess I’ll be-“
“I- I’m not g-good en- enough! I- nhgh- I’m not ‘
And yet, it had come to be one of Nat's favorite moments-- Tony was so vulnerable and yet... he
"I'll have you know, Tony Stark, that one thing they always fail to mention is that I take pride in being helpful on the medical team during the war."
Rain poured incessantly against the windows of the compound. It was a dreary evening, but Steve was determined to make the most out of it. He had it all planned out perfectly.
Tony’s entire body stiffened as he gasped for air, overwhelmed as tears filled his eyes. It was all so much. It all felt too much.
Just go ahead and call Pepper when she’s already on my ass about two new upgrades I’ve got to finish for Stark Industries, so that will certainly make things
But for now, she held on to Tony and soothed him quietly.
The mechanic sighed, looking up into those blue orbs.
onto the entry hall table.
“Good friend Natasha!” Thor boomed.
I yell inside my head
“Nat, I... I honestly don’t know what to do.”
Walking on Cloud Nine the entire way back home, Steve threw on some music and blasted the speakers as he cooked up some spaghetti and meatballs for dinner. Sam and Bucky came in absolutely gobsmacked when they came in to check on their friend and found him singing along to Back In Black with a whisk in his hand!
a big moment for the both of them.
Smiling, Tony let his head fall on Steve's shoulder.
They weren’t bonded, but Tony and Steve had something stronger. The two were something beyond simple Alpha-Omega makeup.
Tony's first instinct was to laugh. '
was linked to Tony.
He just saw Tony's back for a few seconds - almost too long in Steve's opinion- but then the genius slowly turned back around and faced Steve with a quizzical expression on his face.
Steve was pulled in two different directions.
His walls fell and he crumpled slightly, the strings cut. Nodding, Stephen turned back down the passage. Steve watched as his form retreated. His body immediately felt drained.
"Shhh ... Shh... It's okay... It's okay. I promise-- I
"Tony," Steve repeated softly, searching his love's gaze, "
Getting out of his car, he was greeted with cheers and congratulations. The crowd parted to let Nat through.
Steve smiled so lovingly at him, "Do you have
“Hey, hey, no. No, it’s okay, My Little Babe, it’s alright. Hey, hey come on, let me look at those beautiful eyes. Let me see my beautiful boy. Come on.”
Nat would be lying if she said she wasn’t on edge. She couldn’t help her friend. And that was the worst thing that could ever happen: being useless.
Tony ignored it the first time, thinking it was just simply the stuffiness of the room and he went to open a few windows, letting the cool night air in.
"We have a lot to talk through," he stated, "You and me. I tried my damn hardest to bury those feelings but I couldn't. And… and I don't want to, but - but we do have some boundaries to work out, Steve. Only then can we work in a team again. Only then, can we work towards me trusting you again. "
Halfway through Deathly Hallows Part 1, Tony was reduced to a small ball cuddled up against Steve’s stomach.
'Okay, this is
"Thank you, Tony," he replied, "for being you."
He pulled Steve as close as possible as he cried into his Daddy's neck.
“Okay. Bruce, you and Clint get my bed ready upstairs with enough medicine and snacks and water. Wanda, I’m gonna need you to stay down here and get everything cleaned up, okay? I’m sorry, Sweetheart.”
Tony's face was blank. Unreadable.
“Aww, Sweetheart,” Steve chuckled, “I’ll be sure to take all your worries away later.”
He could smell Bucky’s slick and Steve’s spend as their bodies separated.
Now Steve knew...
Steve was home to Tony!
'Oh no... Oh
," Nat whispered softly, "You don't have to be sorry--it's only natural to miss Daddy. I know I miss Uncle Bucky too, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate you any less," she pecked another kiss to Tony's cheek, stroking his little back reassuringly, "I always have
"For now, yes," she cut in, glaring down at him.
He slowly began to rub soothing circles onto Tony’s back and he felt the genius relax in his hold.

be hurt by Steve's hands ever again - not if the soldier could help it!
He caused Tony to become like this... but now, thankfully, he had Steve as a caregiver who loved him. A whole team who loved Tony.
He looked so vulnerable. So open.
Steve felt Tony still beneath him and felt how he slowly became disengaged with their kisses.
His eyes shot open and his focus immediately zeroed in on Tony standing in the doorway of their en-suite bathroom - probably from getting a glass of water - but his hands were over his mouth and his eyes owlishly wide!
To anyone, it would ultimately be the most unethical thing to do, but without Steve, Tony’s body was going haywire and he needed an alpha. Yes, it was weird. Yes, it was extremely intimate, but worse things could have come from this- Thor, for example, downstairs.
Tears stung her eyes as she crouched down in front of the small boy.
Okay, you two, I believe that the sooner we leave, the sooner we can get back. So
Tony grabbed the soldier's hand they shook on it.
“He’s actually been the complete opposite lately,” Nat replied, leaning against the front doorway, “Whenever he’d say something completely
open the door for me. I need to see you – I need to apologize to you properly. Babydoll? Tones, please.”
Steve felt the vibrancy of it thrum through his body and his soul as he pulled up his Merc alongside the other cars in the wide street. The other racers bounced to the steady base vibrating through the ground. Everyone was dressed in neon-colored clothing, branded jackets and shoes and chains and bracelets jiggling with their bodies.
But he wasn’t the only one…
It linked him to old times- to
(See the end of the chapter for
, not just any other one-night stand! It meant something more. And that scared Tony a little!
Steve snickered. Another thing he found quite mesmerizing was the relationship Tony had with his technology. He treated his AIs and robots with humanity; as equals.
"Maybe," was all she muttered, deadly.
It nagged at the blonde when Tony tried for humor to deflect his real emotions, but he granted the brunette the benefit of the doubt this time, since it
Tony hitched in a breath, but he felt ready.
She walked over to the now-turned-toddler genius and clutched him into her lap, tickling him madly! Tony squealed in surprise and tried to fight her off, but it was to no avail!
They both needed a break and Tony couldn’t wait to spoil his alpha with the huge number of sightseeing tours, multiple platters of foods from his favorite Italian restaurants and endless hours spent on their own private section of the beach. He’d supervised the renovation on their beach house, personally, to make it as artistically perfect as possible so that it suited Steve’s taste so he’d be able to sketch peacefully by the sea.
Steve's heart burst!
"Sorry, what was that?" Strange asked.
"You do drive a good bargain, Captain," the mechanic grinned. And Steve vowed to keep that grin on Tony's face as long as he could.
He stuttered in a few breaths, staring hard at their interlocked hands, and then once again, into Steve’s midnight-blue eyes. He only saw pure sincerity.
*                    *                    *
some reassurance that, in between what was going on, maybe… maybe he still found it in him to… to stop and still remember that I loved him. And that he... loved me." The mechanic drooped his head, willing the tears to remain at bay.
Tony could see Steve's hands clench and unclench, tightly, rapidly, in fists - the tell-tale sign that he was now at a

to come back. He doesn't want to come back to a disappointment- a selfish disappointment! He'd rather kill himself or die on a mission than come back home. What else could it be? My own daddy would do it. Steve might be dead, because I wasn't good enough! I didn't do enough!"
... He let everything from that moment come forward and he launched himself at Steve! Tears poured over and Tony kissed him deeeply!
As the lyric was sung by Phil Collins, and his voice filled the room, Steve used his free hand to hold Tony's in sync, and he rubbed his thumb gently over his baby's knuckles.
The soldier stood tall on the battlefield, breathing in as much of the glorious air as he possibly could.
Tony crouched on the counter, with broom in hand held like a sword and a colander as a helmet on his head.
Oh my God! Oh, Tony!'
"With what proof?" he asked incredulously, throwing his arms in the air, "He covers up his tracks well enough. Look, Steve, all I want is a good night's sleep not worrying about my father, and just lying next to the only one in this world who doesn't make me feel like trash."
The relief washed over him, cleansing his soul, cleansing his bones and nerves.
“Please,” he whispered to the brunette, “Let’s just get a coffee and talk somewhere and-“
But he wanted to take them away even more! He wanted to hide Tony from the world. He'd received enough cruelty from humanity to last a lifetime!
"Oh Barnes," Tony sighed, smiling. He patted the chair next to his bed, gesturing for Bucky to sit beside him.
Tony smiled feebly, “No, I uh… I flew out the window.”
"MY GOOD FRIEND, ANTHONY! We have all come bearing gifts, and food of garbage, in order to partake in the Midgardian tradition of swearing ultimate
Dressed up in leather jeans and a jacket with studded rings and a choker necklace, she was absolutely
Tony looked up to Nat with a teary face.
And the soldier knelt on the battlefield, not even daring to let go of his love as his wailing echoed amongst the dust.
"Nothing but confirmation," Steve mumbled. Shrugging it off, he plastered on a smile, "How'd the visit go?"
He couldn’t explain it, but there was something
Tony doubled over in pain as a rapid shot of lightning seemed to strike his lower belly. His whole body ached and his limbs had turned to mush. He felt the wet slick leak into his jeans and he let out a shameful whimper.
To the untrained eye, her glare would appear very leathal, but on the Spy Twin's scale, it was quite moderate.
"Oh, you simple omega!" Nat laughed, kissing his cheek and nose, "How many times must I tell you that it's okay? I'm flattered, but seeing that we all thought we almost lost you?" She looked off to the side, sighing - not even wanting to believe that such a future existed.
Steve breathed out and smiled sheepishly.
But no-one could deny that the God had spoken the truth.
“The last time I saw him, he was with Bruce in the lab after I fed him,” Clint replied from the couch, clearly unbothered.
"You gave me a home, Tony. And you'll always be my home."
Tony couldn't blame Bucky for sticking up for Steve - the man was his best friend. And Tony wanted to end this whole debacle as much as everyone else wanted too.
"Steven Grant Rogers," Tony stated firmly, "I know what you did..."
The captain's eyes shone like crystals, earnest and pleading.
Tony kept his distance from Steve as they walked to the blonde's floor of the new facility. He wasn't so paranoid as to actually walk
The embraced in a big, albeit stinky hug and Steve turned to Tony who was nuzzling the blonde's neck. He looked up with wide eyes to Steve, who kissed him on the nose.
“I uh… I – I have to…” his words fell away.
He growled as he shoved Tony's pants and boxers down, off of his legs and threw those across the room too!
Steve had brought a rainbow bouquet of roses - Tony's favorite. The man stood hunched over, rubbing his neck as his feet shuffled against the tiles.
... you have no idea how sorry I am! Oh, I missed you
“I’ll call for Doctor Stephen right away,” the front desk secretary scrambled for the microphone and called for attention Doctor Stephen.
"It was like… one minute, I'm- I'm hanging over this cliff, but my leg is trapped under this boulder, so I'm just hanging there and
to believe it!
Tony burst out laughing again as the fell into bed.
“Love of my life/ You’ve hurt me… / you’ve broken my heart / and now you leave me / Love of my life, can’t you see?/ Bring it back, bring it back / Don’t take it away from me, because /you don’t know what it means to me…”
Tony really was something else! And he had somehow managed to crawl into Natasha's metal heart and find the long-forgotten piece of gold she'd thought she'd lost during her days in The Red Room. But Tony found it and he'd made it his home there...
A smile subconsciously began to form on her face at the thought of spending some time with her genius best friend!
"Cheeseburgers," he answered.
"Woah, Tony, are you alright?" Steve felt Tony nuzzle in his neck, inhaling Steve's scent and relaxing in his hold. A three-second gesture turned into a six-second hug that Steve was…
Steve chuckled, drawing his genius close in for a hug and a kiss.
The soldier was serious. His eyes pleading.
Steve smiled as he caressed the side of Tony's face, the genius leaning into it subconsciously.
Steve leaned up and kissed him long and sensually with all the timetable in the world.
“I know, Honey, I know,” Steve enveloped his boy, shielding him from the world and its worries. “Aw, it’s alright. It’s okay. I’m here now. Shh… shh… It’s alright… You don’t gotta worry about nothin’,” he cooed gently, rubbing circles over the little boy’s back.
She leaned against the wall, trying to seem calm and collected, staring down the corridor, but Steve could see her restlessness. She and hospitals didn’t exactly agree, especially with the whole ordeal of Fury faking his own death. And now her closest friend was in critical condition on top of it.
She smirked, "Oh, I think I have a fair idea!"
His tone turned thin and strangled, “Honey-“
‘Okay… disadvantage here: not so many people at eight a.m. on a Tuesday morning, but hey, what can you do? I have the element of surprise, since I’m in a seemingly vulnerable position, so I can shove past, but that relies on speed and coordination, which I don’t have because of the whiplash…’
He silently began ticking off all the things that might've ticked off Nat for the month ...
“Honey,” Steve chuckled, biting his fist to conceal his laughter, “Is this all over another spider?”
He stared off into the distance, giving a lazy smile and humming to himself, “Mhmm…
“Anything special I’ve forgotten, Honey-muffin?” he asked.
He could only listen and give Tony his space as he worked through what he was trying to tell Steve through these characters.
Tony gazed into those beautiful blue orbs, hoping to say what words never could. The rain continued its silent pounding against the glass outside, the lightning flashing white gold.
will listen whilst
"I missed you, Steve... God, I missed you so much!" Tony whispered shakily. Steve's gaze was so tender and sweet, so full of a love that Tony couldn't describe! His eyes were soft, his touch was firm and graceful.
It was something Natasha would make Howard pay for, if she ever got the chance to visit Hell.
Natasha rolled her eyes fondly and let out a sigh, "By 'always', you actually mean
Tony clutched him tight, “Please don’t let go, though.”
Thank you again for all who stick around and continue to support this fanfic.
Natasha finally let the squealing toddler go, still laughing herself, but no sooner, did she suddenly get the air punched out of her with an almighty
“There-there was too much light-lightning,” Tony cried, “And it-it was scary- the thunder. A-and Howard never-he never let me sleep with-with Mommy. And I- Just kept hearing him say over and over,
Steve, alive and well, consoles Tony after his nightmare.
'I just want my Alpha! I just want my- I miss my- I miss my Steve!'
“What’s the news? Is he okay? What’s the diagnosis?” Pepper’s frantic questions were going a mile a minute.
"Of course," he whispered softly, "Oh, of course, Tones. I'm here. I'm here now, it's okay. It'll be okay, don't worry… C'mon."
"I wouldn't know," Steve replied, "He and Sam have been quiet, in their honeymoon phase of the relationship, I guess."
You both should be back by now..."
The genius had been working non-stop for SI for over a month now and it had taken quite a toll on him. And on Steve especially. With all the work piled up, Tony hadn’t been able to show his alpha the love and affection he’d normally be able to give.
me again in this universe? Or... would it have taken the existence of another, for you to ever respect me again- for me to earn your respect and your love? For me as a teammate again… or- or as a friend?"
The supersoldier sighed and closed his eyes for a moment, taking in a couple of deep breaths.
I know it's quite short, but it's kind of like an introduction to the chaos that's about to arrive...
Clint gulped and took that cue to just carry on eating his own popcorn! Nat smirked at him.
Steve stood quiet and thoughtful. No doubt about it that Natasha’s words carried truth in them, which is what scared the captain the most…
I quite like the sound of that. I think we should watch Game of Thrones more often if it causes you to act like this.”
He stopped as another fit of hacking sobs wrecked his heart – wrecking his bones.
"Steve told me what happened. What
Tony's stomach suddenly leapt at his runaway thoughts.
The worries danced around Steve’s brain, causing his air passages to constrict. He began hyperventilating. His throat choked up. He couldn’t suck in enough air…
something scarier than a papa bear when protecting Tony!
Steve visibly had to shake his head to clear it. Instead, he just tried to focus on the sleek, black car driving closer.
"I'm gonna love you," Steve declared, never breaking his eyes away from the scientist's, "And you don't need to be scared, Tones. You're not gonna disappoint me. I don't care what anyone thinks, you're perfect to me."
until it broke free in his gleaming smile!
The captain blew a raspberry on Tony’s stomach, watching the small boy wriggle and chuckle and Steve just enjoyed the happy sounds that left his heart and lips.
It wasn't that he
“Tony, for
But Natasha groaned at that.
"You feel a bit better, Doll?" he asked his baby softly, still massaging his limbs and back.
He breathed in Steve's cologne, feeling the stubby hairs of his beard scratch against his neck.
in the zone, he’d talk about you guys like family.”

“Why are other living things so much work?” he whined.
"What I mean is, Tony and Mr Rogers aren't bonded, but… they are
Thor was the one to pick the night's movie - "Midgardian Culture is quite simply more predictable than I thought. There is certainly a lot more violence in this
Thankfully now, Tony was asleep, so that was a problem for later. And the mattress worked as pad/absorbent. You wouldn’t need to worry about messy bedding.
But then the nausea came again, not even ten minutes later.
And then he remembered what Rhodey said earlier:
The front doors banged open as a bull-angry James Rhodes scanned the room frantically, locking his eyes on Steve Rogers. Steve gulped. He practically scrambled out of his chair, backing away as Rhodey prowled forward.
Steve held Tony's chin and sought to memorize every facet and feature of Tony's beautiful face: his deep, chocolate-brown eyes, his brown locks that held streaks of grey now, Tony's strong jaw, his cheekbones; his full, swollen lips that were still cherry-red from their make-out session!
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was scared of the storm, Aunty Nat,” he whispered into Natasha’s neck.
With that, Steve walked softly out of the bathroom again, sticking to his word and grabbing a few of four-year old Tony’s favourite bath toys.
All the spark was sucked out of him. His eyes were dull and lifeless. It was terrifying to watch.
about his Daddy and
"You don't have to say it back," Steve assured, "But just know that, from me, you're my one and only, okay?" Steve smiled, "Promise you won't forget?" Tony nodded dumbly, quite still in shock. The blonde chuckled, "Come on, my stunning genius, let's get to bed."
It had to be this way, because initially, I didn't want there to be a love triangle, because I have nothing against Ironstrange, but it's not my main otp, so I didn't want to have that ending, but it felt too rushed to have Tony end up with Steve as if the whole cheating issue meant nothing, so the only logical way was to take Tony away -   *cue evil chuckle!*
Steve nodded helplessly in defeat and sighed, despairingly, "Alright, so what happens now?"
"Hi," Tony answered, smiling in return.
“Tony, Honey- it’s time for bed!”
That didn't mean that injuries weren't obtained, though.
Not caring to beat around the bush any longer and gawk like a fool, Steve cleared his throat, making his presence known. Tony's head turned. And Steve wasn't sure if it was just the exhaustion in Tony's face, or something else, but as his eyes focused on Steve's form, he turned back to the wall, mumbling a simple 'hello'.
A knock at the door caught his attention.
The pair suddenly crashed back down onto the mattress and Steve clutched a laughing Little Tony to his chest, snuggly, and blew a raspberry into his neck.
“My Sugar-sweet Honeybear, you will
once the shield was back in Steve's grip! He felt like himself again.
,” he moaned in ecstasy, letting the sweet pumpkin cake and caramel melt in his mouth and consume his senses. The cinnamon spice was a perfect balance that provided that savoury taste. It was light and fluffy, but the caramel filling was dense and sweet and it was all just perfect!
Tony saw it all!
much! I don't even think I ever stopped! " His sobbing became uncontrollable and Tony bent his head down to hide his embarrassment, but it was quickly recaptured in a kiss!
Enveloping him... Cocooning him snugly...
“Only ‘cause my best fella deserves it.”
Steve let him go and watched in amazement as Nat pulled him for a huge bear hug and kissed his temple. Tony whined at the pampering, but Nat just peppered more kisses onto the side of his face!
He was a bright artist. He saw people. He saw the truth. He was a protector.
"Thank you, Daddy," he mumbled quietly, while Steve gently rocked them again in a slow rhythm, "I love you!"
Stephen's eyes sharpened, piercing against the wall of pride the blonde tried to form around himself.
"Yeah," Steve sobbed, a wavering watery smile on his face, "yeah, yeah it's me. Oh, Tony, you have no - you have no idea how sorry I am. How I-
Steve saw how Tony's shoulders tensed up.
"Plus," Tony added, "I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding!"
Tears still flowed- tears of sadness, regret, but also tears of happiness! A laugh bubbled up from Tony's chest and he pulled away slightly, cradling Steve's face in his hands.
That eerie, shadow voice came forward again once more, and chuckled darkly from deep within the corner of Steve's head.
Steve Rogers! ... "
He wrapped Tony in a bear hug as he sung the verse, hoping to convey the message: Tony could always come and find safety in Steve's arms, whether he was in this headspace or whether he was back to his regular adult-self, that Steve still loved just as much!
It seemed almost all traces of Tony's nightmare had vanished completely, but there was still one more trick Steve had up his sleeve that always managed to chase his baby's demons away for good.
More love!
The brunette breathed out steadily, "The camera only shows Nick's back to her, but he turns around and goads her into a hug, smiling. In the end, Nick breaks that prejudice against foxes and becomes a cop alongside Judy... They become partners! ..."
Steve nodded his thanks and briskly walked to the elevator.
had to carry the pups. For an alpha to give their knot without protection was something sacred. They were ready to start a family.
He held in his breath as Tony made his next move...
She breathed in his spicy, cinnamon aroma and smelt the sweet slick leaking between his legs. Her soft delighted hum rolled into a deep and guttural possessive growl that made Tony cower back even further against the cupboards in fear.
Those eyes inked into a sky - glass blue.
The eyes never lied.
"You sure you know what you're doing? I'm not worth a race, Steve."
from Tony, who pouted adorably in his hospital bed.
Tony groaned, pushing away slightly, “But I still have so many plans to go over. You go so long, Muffin. You go get comfortable and I’ll be up in about… Give me half an hour.”
“I’m sorry, dear Son of Rogers, but I can only call the lightning, not subdue it.”
Tony pouted, “Well, I’m
" she laughed, while rocking him steadily up and down, walking around the penthouse, thinking that the movement would get the excitement out of him.
Should I keep this book going with a longer amount of chapters or start a new one to keep a kind of balance going with the number of chapters in each fic installment?
Blinking open his eyes and drawing in a huge gulp of breath even though his lungs protested severely against it, he made his decision to fight the pain.
It was heat. And it was safety!
“Thankfully so. Zoology tends to leads to a veterinarian job and I don’t think I can handle animals spending more of my husband’s time than me.”
Dusty rose began to blush onto Tony's cheeks as Steve remained seated and stunned. His heart beat erratically; his eyes wide.
“Should he move back to the tower? Must anything be altered? What is he allowed to eat and drink? Has-?”
"Yes, Steve?" Tony replied slowly. He looked to the soldier as if Steve was the hardest puzzle he'd ever had to solve.
The statue was placed outside the Avengers compound in the front garden. Countless people would stop by and bring letters and gifts for Tony or the other Avengers. Sometimes daily or weekly, but always often.
"No, no, it's okay. Hey, it's okay," Tony chuckled, "I'd be lying, myself, if I said there wasn't an ulterior motive to have me looking at your baby right here." Tony tapped the hood with his knuckle.
Iron fists clamped Steve's heart so tight, it must have been bleeding. He choked on his tears as he tried to haul in oxygen. Tony could feel the warm hand cradling his cheek. The soldier's soft touch warmed the genius' heart
Steve came down to the garage floor, but stood apprehensively outside, staring at Tony’s silhouette through the glass while the genius obliviously continued with his project.
All his barriers were down and Steve knew, that in that moment,
“Never.”
Tony blinked owlishly.
And yet Steve had just… he’d just given it away to Barnes.
this time, I
"C'mere," said Steve, softly.
He couldn’t help but feel ecstatic as he pictured the tiny blush that would fall on Nat’s face at the gesture, and the good-natured punch to his shoulder that would follow after. Tony smiled to himself, picturing the whole moment.
Steve reached for Tony’s hand, squeezing it gently.
Tony still squirmed on the mattress though, uncertain and shy. Nat would still have to undress him, because the heat had fully taken affect, so Tony wasn’t at all aware or capable of functioning on his own. His mind fought to stay conscious and alert, but it was no use. He squirmed and sniffled helplessly, whimpering in shame.
Sitting on Steve's bed, Tony twiddled his fingers, refusing to meet his boyfriend's eyes.
A lazy smile appeared on his face as Tony found himself floating. He floated amongst the clouds. It all felt so soft and safe. Natasha’s summer scent cocooned him in the warm rays of the sun as he floated on cotton. Tony was drifting away, waiting for the stars.
Right now, I just have exams coming up and before that, it was dealing with writer's block and working on my mental health, so I'm sorry it has taken so long, but please hang on and bear with me- I will complete and update this story, I promise!
“Thank you!” Tony breathed. Still perched atop the island, Tony pointed to the cupboards next to the fridge.
Looking at Steve, assessing whether or not he cared enough to listen, Tony was surprised to find that the blonde was actually looking at Tony
He and Steve took a long bubble bath splashing around and cuddled warmly in bed together, while Tony told him about the time spent with Aunty Nat while his daddy had been away.
Steve's fingers were hot pin pricks that sparked light on to Tony's skin- like embers that set fire to everything with only one touch!
“I’m guessing Steve doesn’t know you’re here then?" she murmured, stroking through his curls.
He owned the place. He gave them a new home.
that his teammates were taking this so nonchalantly. Tony had been de-aged to a tiny four-year old and Steve could name six hundred ways Tony could die in the Tower alone, and God knows how many other ways, if he got out in this storm!
And that was the exact moment the dam of laughter finally burst! Everyone was soon heaving in deep breaths of oxygen as faces turned beet-red and Tony was dubbling over on the ground, desperately clutching his chest!
"Good!" she smiled sweetly.
that happened between the two of them. Steve couldn't explain it, but Tony's magnetic persona had drawn him in and he was hooked.
About fifteen minutes and thirty seconds later, Steve found himself on the floor! He was pinned up, right against the wall with Nat's leg kicked up and her knee jabbing harshly at his chest!
Steve crashed to floor, heaving in deep gulps of air that he didn't even know he was holding!
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve cradled his husband’s head gently, bringing him close against him with his other arm.
Then, Tony’s voice was heard. It was somber and yet, confused.
"Do you hear me? You're
“Worrying won’t help!” she replied breathless. She sat him down on the couch and wrapped a blanket around his shoulders.
She held Tony steady as he wobbled on his legs and tried to close his legs, embarrassed by his slick. He sniffled quietly, but Nat pulled him close and cradled his head against her scent gland to calm him down.
That hopeful soldier inside of his heart stood up tall and proud, and stated loud and clear in his mind:
… you have no idea how stupid and- and worthless I feel. I’m
At those words, a slow tear fell from those brown doe-eyes.
easy to pick him up during the day and smother him in bear hugs!
It's from the scene where Ally visits Jack in rehab and he asks about their dog, Charlie and Ally says: "Ah, Charlie's great - Charlie's adorable. He just sits by the door or lies like this (imitates Charlie lying on his paws) Waitin' for Daddy... We're both waitin' for Daddy..."
“I don’t know how you all can stay so calm when I’ve searched this tower inside out for two hours and still, there’s no sign of my love!”
On one hand, he didn’t know Tony that well, so he didn’t know if it would be overstepping a boundary to go and talk to him.
With a smirk as devilish as Tony's, she looked up, her eyes gleaming.
I’m totally Bi and let me tell you, if I could have anybody on a list, then he’d be at the top.”
The scientist merely let his head fall back on Steve's shoulder, humming contently and nuzzling Steve's throat.
Steve's heart thrummed erratically against his ribcage. Daring a look at the genius, a crumpled smile formed on his face.
facility that he had built for the Avengers. He didn't like to play the "Ownership Card" and resort to his old standards of billionaire arrogance, but the fact that he had some sort of asset over the team, in case Steve
Steve let out a wavering breath.
Soon, his eyes fell shut midway through Natasha's third story and little Tony was snoring with a smile on his face.
Eight P.M. on a Wednesday night.
"S-Ste-ev-e?" Tony whispered, on the brink of tears.
Steve gasped out, coughing.
His hands gripped Tony's shoulders and Steve ever so gently shoved him down onto the bed, before climbing on top of him. The kiss never broke. Tony's hands were carding through Steve's hair and the genius let out a soft moan.
It stung everywhere.
In some sense, that was actually true.
Throwing open the front door, and down the front stairs, Tony made it to his bike and pushed on even though his legs were screaming to rest. The rain drenched him, plastering his clothes and hair to his body like a second layer of skin.
That seeps in all too soon
"What? Did I hurt you?"
He was faced with a deadly evil, feline gaze from the red-headed spy who was smiling proudly at herself for catching her latest prey...
So many emotions swirled up to the surface.
And Tony felt… he felt
The captain shook his head and decided not to question it. He pulled Tony to his side and gave him a peck on the forehead.
Steve ducked his head to try and catch the brunette's gaze.
First letter that's up is the letter "C"; my prompt is the word "Caramel".
Stephen smiled back, though it didn't reach his eyes.
He huffed out a breath.
It was what made Steve so humane. So admirable.
thought Tony.
The evening was a little harder though, since Tony wasn't as distracted as during the day, so Natasha woke up in the night to a small lump tucked into her side, sniffling quietly.
Two more sets of footsteps were heard running into the kitchen. Wanda gasped and scrunched her nose at the flood of scents overwhelming her. Clint was busy trying to distract Thor from Tony and tried to push him to the door, but the God of Thunder wouldn’t budge. Between an omega in unexpected heat and two alphas about to tear each other’s throats apart, the team never had a quiet night to themselves!
But Steve's eyes glittered now with tears of happiness.
breaking point.
Tony was beautiful, no doubt about it, but she would just be laying by his side – all he needed was an alpha’s knot. Most couples loved the foreplay during sex, but it was quite easy to build towards a knot.
Tony lifted his head. Still walking towards the compound, the two men didn't break eye contact.
Tony, magic or no magic!
The boy's senses went spiraling, his vision blurred and twisted. He cradled his throbbing head, feeling a spot of blood at the back.
"Steve Rogers. Brooklyn boy, aye?" she tilted her head, her assessing gaze still sharp, "I heard Brooklyn boys like it rough and tough. So, what kind of tough are you looking for in New York City, then?"
Cue a paranoid genius and a soldier who is completely dead of laughter from the whole ordeal.
“Shh… shh Little Omega. I’ll make you feel good, I promise,” her whisper tickled his ear, sending shivers down Tony’s spine. She began suckling on the omega’s lobe.
see that vulnerability. So, to the untrained eye, the genius brunette just looked like a businessman with a stoic expression. But Steve saw the weariness behind those eyes. And he comforted himself on the prospect that maybe Tony was relaxed enough to let those walls down a little bit, around Steve.
He knew, then, why he didn't back away, why he didn't call the armor...  And it soothed him.
The elevator
“Steve?”
Natasha's nails dug into the blonde's skin, drawing droplets of actual blood. He was completely pinned.
Tony gasped! Giggled blushing, and instinctively wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist.
Putting on his lop-sided grin, Tony spoke again, "Secondly, the engine parts are new and uniquely branded to Fury's, and I've seen enough engines in my life to know when Fury recommends one of his workers to their first street race."
“I’ll sing for you,” the captain said softly.
Spluttering sobs could be heard on the other side of the door and Steve’s heart tightened in iron chains. He’d made Tony cry!
Oh, goodness, I- I’m sorry- I didn’t know-“ the scientist cleared his throat awkwardly as Nat and Wanda broke away, smirking. Wanda went to squeeze Bruce good-naturedly in a bear hug, pecking him on his temple.
Tony spared no second thought. He slipped his hand into Steve's warm grasp and in that moment, something clicked into place again. There was no more hurt. No more anger. The two did nothing but give each other dopey smiles for a full thirty seconds.
, every
Steve brought the tiny genius into his lap, holding him close. He pecked a sweet kiss to Tony’s cheek.
Nat hugged him tighter.
Quit the quietness that won’t let me forget
She smiled again – Tony’s smile – and reached her arms out. Steve scooped her up and she tousled his hair.
Stephen looked up, slightly startled, "Oh! Miss Romanoff, you nearly made me spill my coffee with that stealth technique. But, please, sit." He gestured to the seat across from him.
He squeezed his daddy lightly as a response, and he felt Steve's smile as a kiss was placed in his curls once again.
Nat led Steve to a side corridor to speak with him. Steve couldn’t shake his fear. He couldn’t shake the anxiety. Tony was lying in a small hospital bed, unaware of what was happening around him and the captain felt so helpless. He didn’t want to sit here and wait for test results; he wanted a cure! He wanted Tony to wake up!
prevent Thor and Clint from killing each other from their competitive behavior!
“Aunty Nat!” Morgan called, jumping into Natasha’s awaiting arms!
Tony’s eyes were wide like a frightened little boy, just wanting someone near him.
He rubbed the back of his neck and subconsciously continued rambling as he jogged up the stairs, “Okay, okay, yeah, that’s- that’s actually
She discovered a man who was traumatized multiple times in his life and had undergone something unknown to man's creation. Something so excruciating, it was almost as painful as reliving her days in the Red Room.
Bucky shook his head. "Maybe I wanna make sure I still have a
a certain supersoldier.
Steve pretended to think for a moment, and then he smiled back, looking at baby Morgan.
Reaching out tentatively, she softly placed her hand to his forehead and nearly flinched herself at how hot his skin was to the touch - like a steel car burning in the sun at noon.
She was smiling.
"What did you think about?" he asked. The genius paused, twirling his fingers and fiddling with the blanket.
"He has conditions," she said, turning her eyes back to him, "Alright rookie. Whatchu got?"
His body shuddering slightly, Steve quickly pulled out his driver's license and handed it to the woman. She scanned over the details.
"I heard that you and Mr Barnes came to visit my patient… Though
” he asked incredulously.
“I missed you, my little one! And what do we say to Uncle Steve?”
He sniffled, “You’re my one and only, Tony. My only…”
As soon as that thought came into his head, something very pure and warm good glowed in Tony's chest and a soft, dopey grin donned his face. Steve was smiling dopily back!
“Shh now, Dolly, let me sing for you.”
It sounded so much like a plea. He needed someone he knew would help him without asking too much or crossing over boundaries. Natasha understood.
"Don't worry, Antoshka, I'm sure Steve knows that he needs to lighten up once in a while too. That's why he has you, me and Uncle Clint and Bucky to keep his life interesting!"
**Take note of that sharp pain I wrote Steve experiencing in the last bit and the connection of their bond! Some subtle foreshadowing...
“I like that smile,” Steve dreamily murmured.
Once the door at the end of the corridor closed and the Quinjet's engine could be heard, Natasha turned and walked back to the communal area of the tower.
(See the end of the chapter for
Every bit of sadness, every bit of hope and every bit of love weaved its way between their hearts and their bodies as they moved closer together... their lips never breaking apart; their hands memorizing each other's bodies as if they'd both disappear within seconds!
The street lights and headlights of cars were a golden blur as he flew over the roads!
Nat giggled, "
"I love you so much, too Daddy! I thought you- I thought you wouldn't--that I'd let you down- I didn’t-"
Tony groaned, pouting dramatically.
“Oh my gosh, that would’ve been a first,” Steve chuckled.
more seconds…
The glass pierced Tony's skin, the shards digging deep into his flesh. Howard stood with his arm still outstretched, poised from throwing his son with the wine bottle. In one swipe, he grabbed Tony by the scruff of his collar, breathing his alcohol-stench into his son's face.
This time, Tony leaned into his touch desperately, as if his life depended on it.
He sighed in defeat.
Steve huffed out a breath and he tried not to smile like a lovesick idiot at Tony's usual sarcasm.
But Tony was trying extremely hard to climb over Nat's shoulders
And he’d vowed that he’d never let that happen.
'Oh!... okay... So that settles
Finally, Bruce spoke up. And what he said was worse than silence: “Tony is deeply ill.”
A small scurrying creature pays a visit to the Avengers Compound and Tony enlists Steve to come to his rescue.
Steve-- trailing behind him like some sort of scared and lost little puppy or anything. No, Tony still had enough dignity in tact to not let his paranoia get the better of him!
Sighing, Tony made his way to the second-floor hallway where his dad stood swaying, whiskey bottle in hand.
"Nat, can you at least let me pack my gifts away before you prank me?" he deadpanned.
Natasha began chuckling fondly, "Not that I'm hating on this newfound enthusiasm, but where is this coming from? Did you have a revelation in yourself when we thought you were gone?"
Steve nuzzled his baby boy's nose as the next lyric followed and he couldn’t help but let out a soft giggle at the relatability.
"I just want peace," Tony smirked, holding up his signature two-finger 'peace' sign. He leaned against the car and looked to Steve, more serious this time, "Turns out... resentment is corrosive. And... I hate it."
He pulled the both of them back against the pillows and wrapped one arm around Tony's back, pulling him close; his other hand lightly stroked the curls at the nape of Tony's neck.
Steve looked down, shamefully.
"Sure thing Nat. Just give me fifteen."
“Please, I need to know what happened! Is he gonna be okay? Please let me see him!” Steve fought against the nurses holding him back and remained focused on the double-doors through which Tony disappeared. By shear will, maybe he could make Stephen walk back through those doors with Tony already better.
"He's right about that, Love" Bucky's voice carried over to them as he walked down the corridor and he gave Nat a quick peck on the cheek as he came up to the pair.
“That it is.”
Tony’s whole body shivered and wavered a few beats.
Tony didn't back away.
“Alright?” she arched her eyebrow, daring Steve to go against her.
"That you trust me." Steve's gaze was open, hopeful. It was the first time Tony had ever said something like that to him. It made his chest thump.
to! At all costs. And..." Tony breathed out, sounding so tired, "And maybe not die trying, this time, would be nice."
scared Tony more than the reaction he'd receive from the soldier.
"Yes, well, I thought it would best to give Tony some space for now," Steve replied, his eyes going cold.
“What? It’s just a simple sleeping incantation. It should knock him out for a good amount of hours while he dreams
“I missed you,” he whispered into Steve’s neck.
And Steve was flying!
Tony's gorgeousness never failed to amaze him.
"Oh God, I
The man shrugged, "I guess… I mean - I- I don't really know. It's all kinda fuzzy, but I remember this feeling, like…"
It felt like forever when he finally pulled up to Steve's house. He parked his bike against Steve's own by the wall and breathed heavily, collecting himself before he knocked.
was where Steve felt alive.
,' Steve guessed, '
Amidst the chaos, Tony grabbed Steve's arm on the way to his car. Steve turned.
He was pouting, but he gazed at Nat with such an amount of love bigger than entire universe.
Steve breathed in - a million fears running rampant behind those baby-blue eyes. Tony saw that now.
” she sighed, pinching her nose, “He already does so much- it’s
"Just like that, Honey. Yeah... just like that; let me hold you. Let me show you how much love you deserve, okay?" Steve whispered.
If anyone watches Game of Thrones, see if you can find my Daenerys reference 😉 (Hint: it's a line she says to Missandei when they talk about the Unsullied and Greyworm) I used it to refer to everyone's bodily makeup in my fic so the tone didn't get too weird or unnecessarily scientific and kill the atmosphere.
A feeling resurfaced. A feeling that Tony thought would never come back.
Steve thought to comment on it, because he found himself enjoying Tony's debates too. It kept Steve on his toes; it kept his brain working and interpreting new perspectives from the future through Tony's eyes. Mentioned before though, Steve would never admit any of this to the mechanic's face.
The thoughts tumbled over and over in Tony’s head and his heart turned with every beat of sadness, longing, confusion and frustration that pumped through his nerves.
Steve was carefully making his way over to Tony, bent low, so as not to frighten his mate.
He's gaining on us, come on! I
The group begrudgingly shuffled back to their seats.
do that to me again, you hear me?" Nat glared at him. The next thing Tony knew, she was pulling him close to her, nuzzling his head. Shocked, but ultimately not so surprised, Tony put his arms around her comfortingly.
" she punctuated the sound effect by slamming Steve's whole body back into the wall!
Tony entered the room, covered in grease and motor oil from the garage, quirking an eyebrow.
Deep, raw passion and focus were set into Steve's eyes and it was so intense; it was so full of raw honesty, Tony's own eyes began to sting with tears.
"Yeah, you can tell Steve I'd like to see him."
He smiled warmly.
trust the blonde enough to open up around him again.
Next up is the letter "D" and my prompt I thought of was "Doughnut".
expression on his face.
,” he replied sarcastically.
’ no… “ Tony shook his head as he tried to get rid of these thoughts, but they prevailed.
Something awkward formed in the air between them.
He tried to control his sniffling and crying, after a few minutes.
Steve drew him in for a kiss.
in there anymore!
“I’m- I'm sorry I head-butted into you. I hope everything you bought still looks okay.”
About thirty seconds passed.
And, by God, the entire man's face lit up like a thousand Christmas lights as he pulled Tony to his chest, cradling the brunette's head tenderly and nuzzling his hair.
be heat sex!
Steve honestly does have a sentimental item to give to Tony; there aren't any innuendos or anything. They both talk during this chapter. Mostly a sweet, sentimental moment.
Steve’s breath hitched. He turned to face her. Brown, hypnotic eyes. Soft and gentle. She kissed his cheek, then leaned down to snuggle his neck.
But it's not.
Seeing Steve, she walked over and leaned against the wall, watching the nurses and doctors bustle about on the helicarrier.
The rain put a stop to a date that Steve organised for him and Tony, but knowing this supersoldier, he wouldn't let the rain stop him. And he had to make it up to Tony in the best way possible.
"You're darn right! And what's this I hear about you helping the Rogers boy with his schoolwork? Are you a
Tony's nightmare
It keeps turning the thought over and over,
It all steadily came back into focus. There was a lower half of someone’s face; someone’s mouth was moving but Tony couldn’t make out anything said.
An alpha’s/ beta's knot wasn’t just something that you experienced with sex any day of the week. It symbolized much more.
going okay.
Tony found himself smiling too.
A kiss that was woven from the past's heartbreak, as well as the promise of happiness for the future!
"Tony, I-"
Tony hates sleep. And he hates sleeping in his bed alone. But Steve knows just the thing to convince his genius to come to bed.
Wherever Tony was,

Now comes the intimacy that hopefully you all were dying to read!😄 I tried to make it as heated and romantic as possible, so bear with me
The genius’ eyes burned. He blinked away the oncoming tears, shaking his head.
"Yeah Steve," she nodded, her face still stoic, but cracked and pained as she remembered the conversations she'd had with Tony down in his lab.
It's the EPR paradox," Tony spoke as he got out of the car.
He was scared. And Steve couldn't blame him.
well, then that was nobody's business!
(cue devilish smirk from me!)
They were owlishly wide and storming with unsaid words and unsaid fears.
long seconds in which a wide-eyed Steve desperately waited for Tony's reaction.
Nat seemed to read his mind, “Since she’s her father’s daughter, you only have to worry about her sarcasm.”
Dominant, but not too possessive, not too overbearing.
This was the
Steve understood those fears.
He stroked the side of Tony's face.
Steve couldn't help but kiss the top of Tony's head chastely. He breathed in Tony's cologne that was mixed with the smell of motor oil and sandalwood.
"NN-Nat? N-Nat... d-d-don'tttt... P-Please..." Tony's thin and breathless voice was almost too quiet, Nat almost didn't hear it, but the scent of his fear was enough to knock through her haze.
Tony saw Steve's true soul.
But then he remembered:
But the bouquet slipped from Tony’s hands and it silently fell to the floor.
Tony outright laughed, heartily, "Relax, Steve! I'm just messing with you! Hahaha, I'm sorry, it's just a force of habit"
"Tony," Steve whispered gently, "I'd like to pull you closer... I'd like to keep you safe in the biggest hug my arms could ever give. May I?"
gave Steve that peace!
"What's there to be confused about?" Tony's eyebrows were scrunched together adorably, his expression perplexed.
So, as you can see, I have updated my tags with warnings on character death, so you all go into this knowingly if you choose to continue reading!
“My Giddy-Aunt,” he breathed.
And I promise you that I
Thank you SOO SO much for everyone who still leaves kudos and comments on this series - it does make me feel good to know that people still like it! 💙 I don't really have an updating schedule, but I maybe have like 2 or three more chapters to post of this installment and then I'll plan a 3rd fanfic to this series, if you guys still want it. So please bear with me and stay tuned for the last run!
"I missed you too, Tony! I missed you like crazy! I'm never doing that again, you here me? I'll never do that to you ever again, I'm so sorry, Tones! I'm so sorry for everything. I-"
A befuddled Happy Hogan turned around to the screen opening, completely shocked!
His brain glitched.
Steve practically glowed like a puppy! It made Tony smile. Really smile in almost a week.
