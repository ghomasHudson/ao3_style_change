Of course that didn’t last. Now that his job was to observe and deduce people, it became obvious that there was a limit to his abilities. He couldn't figure out what people's Words were. Even though he knew how common some phrases were, he couldn’t even get them right. Sometimes it could have helped to find the culprit but Sherlock just couldn’t. And still feeling a jolt of unexplainable unease whenever hearing someone say hi was slightly more than distracting. Yes, he felt infinitely alive with the thrill of the chase and the threat of a serial killer, and never felt like lapsing when there was a good murder to solve. Still, it took less than two years before Lestrade came to pester him with a case barely a four – that he had been refusing for a week already – to find him lying on the floor of his filthy flat.
“Oh, you softie,” John chuckled, realising Sherlock wanted him to save his
“Okay, just let me get these to the fridge and I’ll be back, yeah?”
"Mmmh, I should've gotten a towel ready too," he muttered after a while, straightening up and grimacing at the mess in his boxers. John just giggled, sitting up on the massage table.
John stared at his phone for a good moment before being startled out of his mind by getting his coat thrown at his face. Picking up the garment, he looked at Sherlock who was already wearing his coat and scarf and was standing at the doorway.
'Just the antlers'
John giggled at Sherlock's slurring outburst.
1) I know I'm late again, I'm having a crazy busy week but I swear I'll catch up when weekend comes!
John sighed contentedly, closing his eyes and resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. “I love you, you know.”
Sherlock moaned, rolling his hips, and the finger slipped inside. John took his time preparing him, adding a second and a third digit with loads of stretching in between. By the time he’d taken the third finger, Sherlock was a gasping, moaning mess, practically rubbing himself off against John’s stomach.
“Yes, um… here,” Sherlock mumbled, giving John his laptop. John saw that there was a new entry to Sherlock’s website, titled simply ‘John Watson’.
“Well, I moved into a student housing and I didn’t want to get bullied for it, so I thought it best to just stop,” Sherlock shrugged, trying to seem nonchalant, but John could see the hurt bubbling just beneath the surface. “And the last few years?” He prompted, stepping closer. Sherlock looked away, changing legs. “I wasn’t sure how you’d react, so I decided to not let you know,” he said quietly, looking at his knee as he stretched.
"I made you a calendar." Sherlock cut him off, his ears turning a little red all of a sudden.
Sherlock wrapped himself around John and snuffled into his neck before falling asleep, whatever had troubled him now forgotten, and John soon followed him.
What had Sherlock done for their Christmas?
John clenched his jaw. Before today, he'd never thought he could feel so conflicted. Everyone seemed to dislike Sherlock and even though he felt sorry for the man, John could see where they got the attitude. But Donovan had already earned John’s dislike with her so far constant rude comments.
Oh good, John. More insulting.
"You are eating Sherlock; I know you didn't eat at the Yard."
“If you insist on being to pedestrian about it, yes.” Sherlock flopped back down and ignored John in favour of leafing through the newspaper.
“Mm, yes it’s pretty good,” John grinned, sipping on the drink again. They shared the chocolate cake and then got some more coffee, smiling and leaning into each other and watching as the snow started falling outside.
Sherlock sat up with a groan. “John, I’ve already eaten far too –“
Continuing the massage, John considered his plan once more. He wasn’t still completely sure if interfering with Sherlock's dancing was a good idea, the brunet was always defensive about his hobby.
When Sherlock decorated the last cookies, both John and Mrs Hudson giggled when they saw that he was making them into tiny hedgehogs. They didn’t dare to eat any of those cookies until later, and Mrs. Hudson got quite a few of the other cookies to take back to her flat since John and Sherlock couldn’t possibly eat them all.
'. It is a fairly new model, an expensive one too, so it would be a gift from your wife, not a girlfriend. But clearly you’re not married, nor have you been recently. And the phone’s quite scratched, like it’s been kept in the same pocket as keys and such. You probably wouldn’t treat an expensive phone like that, so a previous owner then. I’m fairly sure they aren’t doing very well, since he’s giving the phone away already.”
"Yeah, I quite think we'll need it."
Sherlock keeps surprising John.
He had written briefly about meeting Sherlock, though he had left the soulmate part out of it, and then a bit more about the case. Now he opened the blog post draft and read through it. Maybe he could post it, the case sounded interesting and he had captured his feeling at the time quite well and he wanted to hold on to that. It had been a while since anything had caught his attention like this, and the first time that something had engaged him like this. He hadn’t written a proper post on his blog before and now there were chapters after chapters of text. Something Sherlock might laugh at. Something new, something he wasn’t used to.
John just squeezed back.
"Sherlock, I think I'm going to bed. It's been a long day."
The box of decorations was waiting for them on the floor, and Sherlock had already detangled the lights for the tree. John pulled Sherlock up from the sofa and then they got to work. John arranged the lights like he wanted them, and Sherlock got to decorate the top of the tree since he was the taller one and could actually reach the upper branches. They filled the tree with tinsel, tiny decorations made of straw, and the classic baubles. Sherlock also got the honours of putting the star on the top.
“I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
After Sherlock’s so-called audition had gone very well - in John’s opinion at least, and Mrs. Hudson had seemed very happy but Sherlock still seemed to think he hadn’t been perfect, they had agreed that Sherlock would start there (Mrs. Hudson had almost insisted, which made Sherlock blush fiercely) with weekly private lessons. Since the dancer had asked John to come with him already and John had then tagged along again and without prompting, he wasn’t actually surprised when Sherlock made sure his practice wouldn’t coincide with John’s rugby practice. "Just in case," he had said, feigning nonchalance, but John had given him a soft smile at the somehow sweet gesture.
Sherlock and John took a look at each other. The kitchen table was out of the question – it always was – and maybe they could’ve eaten at the coffee table like usual, but with Mrs. Hudson… Sherlock stood up to grab John’s laptop from the desk while John started to pile up the notes scattered all over the surface.
“So we’re never going to eat on the table again,” John sighed, following Sherlock and starting to pull the ingredients out of the fridge. “With the speed you pile new stuff on it, you’ll never get it cleaned like you promised…”
“Alright, let’s get up,” John chuckled, pulling back and getting up, heading straight to the bathroom. Sherlock let out a louder protest, hastily following John which earned him a shared shower.
“John!” Sherlock protested, giggling too now.
, John mused.
"This is - it's..." A bright blush spread to his cheeks. The doctor removed the blindfold and smirked as Sherlock swallowed the mouthful of sperm.
John excepted the familiar touch of a fingertip probing his hole. He expected the slickness of lube and he was very much looking forward to it.
The last few practices practically flew by, everyone knowing their places and routines by then, and John started to enjoy watching the almost finished production. He had agreed to help with the setup on the actual show dates too, meaning he could be present there from the start to the finish, and Sherlock was practically beaming when he wasn’t a nervous mess.
Pure fluff, I hope.
~'*'~
John whipped his head around to look. "There's just a cab, I can't..." He stared at Sherlock's face. "The killer is a
"Here's one of your blue ones," he said, tossing it to John, who brightened up a bit. "Oh, these are my favourites! I just saw this one's pair in my drawer," he said, leaving the sock aside so he wouldn't forget.
So, they went to see the ballet, and John appreciated it. But he appreciated everything that Sherlock had shared that day much more.
“Most people probably didn’t realise it was a problem. You know, they probably just think it was all perfect and great, like I do.”
Past caring, Sherlock was just about to turn and continue his venture towards the door when the man finally managed to speak.
"No, don't worry. This is today's surprise. Or well, the thing we're going to be doing today," Sherlock said cheerfully, peeking into the bag without letting John see. He seemed to be satisfied with whatever he found there, because he left the sack there and stood up, heading to the kitchen to tend to his microscope and whatever he was researching with it.
As he settled for sleep, he couldn't help thinking that he would probably be as eager to see Sherlock Holmes again, soulmates or not. The man was no doubt the smartest person John would ever meet and he couldn't wait to know him better and to see how he worked. He couldn't tell if that interest was returned at all and that was a thought that kept him from sleeping almost as effectively as nightmares.
"Don't say you didn't see it coming; you've been postponing paperwork since you started there."
“I will, promise. It’ll be worth it, you are already brilliant. Make sure she knows how you do your best.”
“You could’ve what? What do you mean lied?”
Sherlock took a deep breath, lowering his leg from the barre and turning around so that he was facing John. Neither said a word as they met in the middle, running hands over each other’s shoulders as they kissed.
John raised his eyebrow at the tentative tone in Sherlock's voice and chuckled. "It's just as much your fridge as it is mine. Besides, I've put up with a lot of stuff worse than an airtight bucket, so don't worry."
"But your arm-"
"Let's try something more challenging," Sherlock mumbled, letting go of John and slowing down. The detective showed John a few backwards skating techniques (which he managed to do without falling over), and then how to do a crossover (which he didn't really manage).
To his surprise, he spotted Molly on one Friday as he was waiting for Sherlock, waving at her. They chatted for a bit and Molly hoped Sherlock would start attending the group lessons soon, since she had been eager to meet John’s boyfriend for ages, ever since John started talking about him all the time.
Next morning John woke up alone again, with only an envelope on Sherlock’s pillow. ‘Christmas tree decorating’ said the card, and John dressed up with a big grin on his face, finding Sherlock in the kitchen, working on some experiment.
John was about to protest, but Sherlock turned around and silenced him. "I know, we've talked about this, you've said you can do without sex, but
John listened to the old lady as she talked about bees and how to take care of them and then how Sherlock helped her. They got to taste different types of honey as well as honey-flavoured ice cream, honey fudge and honey cupcakes.
from you
"Mm, they look very dashing on you," John nodded, smiling. "Maybe I shoulder have a pair as well."
Christmas is getting closer, and John gets in the spotlight.
John cut him off with a kiss, sitting down on the bed and tugging Sherlock into his lap. He let his hands wander up and down Sherlock’s thighs and sides for a good while, sucking on his lower lip gently. When they broke the kiss, both of them were breathing heavily, with John’s hand on Sherlock’s hips.
John woke up when Sherlock tried to slip off the couch from underneath the doctor, jostling him in the process. “Mmm, Sh’lock?”
When they got there, Sherlock led them through the crowds, and suddenly John realised where they were going and looked at Sherlock with a frown. "You're taking me ice-skating?" He asked, definitely surprised. Sherlock looked at him and then grinned, pulling an envelope from one of his coat pockets.
She still insisted on coming upstairs to see the turkey, and they figured out the perfect mixture of herbs and spices for it. She also gave John tips for the gingerbread dough and also the canned-beans-dish that John wanted to try even though it did sound like a disaster from the beginning. She agreed to lend a few carrots and her leftover blackcurrants for John to experiment with.
"Yes," he said, giving a teary laugh, "yes, I'll marry you!"
They returned the dog and then ate warm sandwiches at some tiny sandwich bar, which Sherlock claimed wasn’t exactly a part of the day’s theme (“but you get so cranky when you’re hungry, and worried when I don’t eat”).
"Oh, um... I'll deal with that later," John chuckled, shaking his head and blushing a little. He drank the water quickly and then laid down on his back, trying to will his boner to go away before things got uncomfortable. It worked for a while, until Sherlock put his hands on John again.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John groaned, leaning against the headboard as Sherlock started moving, his eyes screwed shut in pleasure. John struggled to keep his eyes open too, his hands gripping Sherlock’s hips and nearly pulling on him every time the brunet ground down.
But how could he ask Sherlock about it?
I know that, you git. You know, Mrs. Hudson has made us something and I’m guessing my attempts will blanch in comparison.” He laid his head on the brunet’s shoulder.
"You think Lestrade won't come looking for us?" Sherlock just scoffed and looked at John, challenge evident in his gaze.
“The sun’s almost out, it’s not going to rain,” Sherlock chuckled and they started towards the station building again. But before they reached it, Sherlock stopped on his tracks as the first light raindrops hit his nose and looked at John with a funny expression, a sort of awe mixed with confusion. Then the skies opened and they were quickly getting soaked. Sherlock looked as if he was trying to say something.
Branches were sewn by the colour of green
This one is the Sock One, shamefully little smut and some sock shenanigans from irl lived life. Not sorry.
Sherlock had practically trembled with nerves when he’d entered the ballet store, something he so rarely did. He scolded himself a dozen times for it as he stuttered his question to the girl behind the counter.
"I mean... like hobbies, interests, friends... Girlfriends, boyfriends, what people usually have." Sherlock's face moved back to the almost bored look. "Oh. Hobbies are dull."
They stayed in bed until John’s bladder grumbled unhappily and he had to get up. “Sherlock, I need the loo,” he mumbled, disengaging himself from the detective’s cuddle and tiptoeing into the bathroom.
~’*’~
John fed Sherlock another cube of root vegetables and asked him again.
John's eyes widened just as Sherlock came back, carrying a tray full of plates and cups. He was still wearing the robe, and John grinned as the detective sat next to him on the bed and fed him small sandwiches, honeyed fruit slices and truffles. John returned the favour, gasping as Sherlock licked the honey from John's fingers.
They wrapped the gifts nicely, sipping on their mugs and feeding each other cookies, and Sherlock made big decorations from the ribbon to put on top of the packages.
“Oh, no, no. Nothing like that, I just wanted to make sure… I mentioned to Sherlock that there are a few free parts for the small Nutcracker project. I told him that he could audition, and we’d find him something.”
John drifted off when Sherlock shrugged off the dressing robe. He was nude underneath it, except for a pair of very tiny red panties, not quite a thong but close enough. John swallowed hard and tore his eyes off the obvious bulge to look at Sherlock, who was watching him with a shy smile.
Sherlock raised his head to give John a lopsided but radiant smile. “I recon they are quite lovely.” John had actually done that. Tiny hearts. He had taken such care with each one.
He had to shift downwards and straddle Sherlock’s thighs as he worked on Sherlock’s lower back and eventually his buttocks. The movement enabled his crotch to make contact with backs of Sherlock’s thighs and it took all his willpower to resist the urge to thrust. Instead, he focused on Sherlock. The dancer had really been working too hard, even his small back was littered with tense spots. John lifted and shifted to get better leverage to work the biggest muscles while Sherlock just laid there, breathing heavier every minute.
John chuckled. "He certainly enjoys it. And he seems to be quite smart."
And once Mrs Hudson decided to add the stage props to the rehearsals, the stage suddenly got quite crowded. John agreed to help with moving them around, so it wouldn’t seem as weird that he was hanging there during all the practices (he had gotten a few looks).
Sherlock wanted to hug someone. Finally, something real to do! He had been running around, trying to get clues from his homeless network, but even the homeless people seemed to miss the serial killer now working in London.
“Oh, you soppy bee,” John sighed, smiling and kissing him softly. “I might get you something anyways, I’ll always be on your side, so that’s not really a gift.”
John stared at Sherlock for a full five seconds before nodding, and the case was on. They only needed to sniff around some more and then evacuate half of the base and run after some baddies, but then the case was solved. John was surprised at how quickly it all went by, but then again there had been no plans for a case involved in the first place.
The week before his first actual lesson, Sherlock spent almost every day practicing after school (and probably during school too, John knew he didn’t always attend his lectures anyway) wherever he could and stretching when at home.
Next day there was a case in the morning and then a long list of rather questionable experiment materials that Sherlock insisted were necessary for the case. John spent the morning and most of the afternoon running around and fetching the things Sherlock needed to experiment on.
"He's always like that. Do you need me to text him?" Lestrade was watching him from the top of the stairs, which made John rather uneasy. He could feel his leg throbbing with the familiar pain. He'd been leaving the cane home for a few weeks now, ignoring the pain, but now he would've needed it.
The second Advent Sunday, and quite a lot of food.
Sherlock stayed awake, wondering and worrying and then scorning himself for worrying. It was probably – no, definitely – nothing, he had no reason to doubt John. “He’s just spending more time on his phone than usual, that was it,” he thought to himself before nodding off on the small hours of the night.
“Hey, love,” John sighed, clearly reading Sherlock’s thoughts from his face and coming to hug him even with the costume on the way.
Sherlock's eyes flashed with something akin to glee. "No, I think they're clever enough."
"What's this? Oh, John," Mrs. Hudson creaked the door open. "Come in dear." John shuffled in, noticing that Mrs. Hudson had been cooking something delicious-smelling. "I hope I'm not interrupting, it is a bit late."
“Hmh? You mean Jack?” John asked, looking at him. “The tall, blonde one?” he clarified after Sherlock scowled at him. “Yeah, him. Either give him a position where he doesn’t need to crouch and make tight turns, or teach him how to do it without damaging his legs. He’ll be an arse about getting advised, though. Used to getting what he wants, but also father troubles,” Sherlock said, sounding bored but clearly showing off.
Sherlock shifted and nodded to John’s lap, where his hands were still somehow holding his phone.
Swaying to the closest chair and sitting down, he sighed and reached for his slippers. He could feel the rather familiar rush of exasperation when he pulled the slippers to his feet rather clumsily, and the tiny voice in the back of his head woke up. He’d never get better, he’d be stuck here. Always be the fat blob of sugar swaying in the far corner of the stage, never on the limelight.
“But I want to get you something,” John said, frowning at him over his cup of coffee. But Sherlock just shook his head.
"You might as well eat, this could take a while." Sherlock wasn't exactly looking at him but, while peering out of the window behind John's back, his eyes swept over John quickly. John tried to open his mouth, but Sherlock seemed to know exactly what John was thinking again before even John himself did.
I have no idea how it happened but John's like really really high... So
, John mused to himself.
“You’ll get the lead next year, I’m certain of it. You’ll do your part so well this year, Mrs. Hudson won’t have a choice but to make you the lead next time.”
John smiled fondly and rolled to his side, watching the dancer. "Sherlock, I'm sure you'd be an amazing dancing candy."
(There'll be a third chapter with almost-smut, because I can't write a decent Christmas fic apparently.)
~'*'~
John had actually put so much effort into this thing that he'd invested in huge spoons, and now he picked the second last and pressed it to Sherlock's lips. “Open up.”
A while later, most socks had found their pairs and all the shirts were hung up of folded neatly. They carried their sock haul to the chest of drawers, Sherlock tucking each sock pair neatly in his drawer while John just tossed them in his.
"I guess I just am more of a summer person, the cold weather just wasn't appealing to me so I used to stay in and read," John swung his hand in the air and shrugged. Sherlock's eyebrows were frowned and his nose crinkled adorably.
Molly just sighed and bit her lip before shaking her head. “Well, alright, alright. But you’ll be the one to tell Greg,” she muttered. “And you’ll owe me one.”
"Mmm, in that case... This might help," Sherlock grinned, handing John today's envelope. John opened it and read the text aloud. "'Relaxing Thai massage'? You know Thai massage?"
“I noticed Sherlock setting up a lab on the table and figured you weren't going to get anything done so I decided to help out a bit,” she explained. John just chuckled.
The brunet had also spent more time practicing at various spots, somehow getting more time at the university. But after one Thursday, Sherlock came home with a ban to the gymnasium and a fairly impressive bruise about to form on his cheekbone.
“Oh my God, Sherlock,” John cried out, one hand burying itself in Sherlock’s curls when he brunet took his tip into his mouth, suckling a little. When Sherlock started bobbing his head, the doctor glanced at the fairy lights hanging over the headboard before focusing his eyes on the curly head again, smiling widely to himself.
"Sherlock," he started, "I thought we talked about this. I don't want to pressure you into anything, and I most certainly do not want you to pressure yourself. I don't want you doing anything before you're ready."
"Mm, merry Christmas, John." Sherlock squeezed John one-handedly and nuzzled his nose on the top of the blond head.
Sherlock shrugged, sipping his own tea. “Christmas spirit, maybe,” he said, giving John a lopsided grin. They finished breakfast in a comfortable silence, and then John announced it was time to open the presents. Sherlock noticed right away that John was getting distracted, and soon he pulled out his phone again, seemingly sending a text before putting it away again.
"Yes, we're still on the case, that's Northumberland Street behind you. No, I don't eat while I'm on a case. Digestion slows me down."
Although he wasn’t as anxious as he had been before his “audition” (as he had called it), John tried to calm him and to get him to slow down but Sherlock was determined to be the best he could. And well, watching Sherlock stretch wasn’t exactly unpleasant for John either.
“You need to ask?” John chuckled, squeezing Sherlock’s hip. “I could come right now, to be honest.”
True to his words, Vern was an ordinary, boring twelve-year-old, and even though John was a year younger, he felt like he was taking care of a baby.
“Yes, and here’s your belt. Not that you need it, but it adds to the overall experience,” the detective said, giving him something that looked like a thong.
“Yes I can." The man raised his eyebrows suspiciously, so Sherlock had to show off a bit.
Sherlock smiled, finishing his own cupcake and then thanking the lady, promising to come by again soon. “Yes, this was excellent, the honey’s really good,” John said too, smiling.
John grinned up at Sherlock and wrapped his legs around his waist, bringing them closer. “What do you want?” he asked, running his hands up and down Sherlock’s back before rolling his hips.
John looked down and saw Sherlock actually take a while to taste his cum before swallowing. "I hope you didn't genuinely think I wouldn't recognise it," he purred and licked his lips, now letting go of John’s hips. "Though it's not nearly as good when it's cold."
“I didn’t use anything suspicious, the bathbomb makes the foam go orange,” Sherlock said, motioning for John to strip. John did just that, smirking at Sherlock. “You use bathbombs?” he teased, quickly getting rid of his clothes.
! Oh, but should he? Would Sherlock want to date him? It wasn't really obligatory to date one's soulmate.
One helping turned into two, and John insisted he try the Christmas pudding and the fruit cake as well, so now the detective was sinking into the sofa like an overstuffed sack of potatoes while John put away the food and baked the gingerbreads. He was almost sleeping when John came back with a plate. “Here Sherlock, try these.”
John swallowed the question he'd been forming - seeing as Sherlock had just answered it - and tried to come up with another. "So, you're waiting for the murderer to show up?" Well that wasn't precisely what he'd wanted to say, but John was glad it made him sound at least marginally smart and not entirely confused, which he really was.
John nodded immediately, taking Sherlock’s hands and pulling him closer. “Absolutely. So..?” he prompted gently.
“I think I should lay on my stomach instead,” he mumbled, still sweeping his gaze over John, eyes somehow distant. John eyed him for a moment and then hopped off. “Yeah sure, are you okay?” he asked, feeling a weird tug of worry in his stomach. Was Sherlock hurting?
“Put these on and then come take your place at the barre, I’ll instruct you.”
Sherlock slowed down and then stopped, almost wringing his hands. “Um… We’re married now,” he started, glancing at John and then clearing his throat. “And well, I expect we’ll stay married for the rest of our lives, right?”
He was bent over the arm of his red chair, his face pushed against the seat and his arse on display, his toes barely touching the ground. His hands were cuffed behind his back and his ankles were pushed widely apart by the damned spreader bar.
Sherlock had apparently refused to take a case yesterday just so that John could come with him today, even though it must’ve been an interesting one. John grinned even wider, wondering how no one else could see how precious the man was.
“It’s tomorrow, she’ll want to see you dance so she knows where to start,” John announced when he entered the living room after calling Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock nodded once, curtly, frowning a little.
They started with the simplest and quickest breakfast of eggs and toast, which had been a very common type throughout John’s school years. Then they headed to an old school gym to meet up with an amateur rugby team.
Technically, John got him the date. Sherlock hadn’t actually contacted the dance studio owner himself yet, letting John take care of the pleasantries for him (well, he really was afraid he’d say something Not Good and then his chance would be gone).
Every year, his parents tried to lure him out of his "winter depression", as they called it. They had tried light therapy multiple times, not that I had made any difference.
"Now and then, yes." Sherlock must've seen that John wasn't really thinking he had done it, because the man relaxed somewhat and gave John a lopsided grin. Still half-squatting on the armchair, he nodded towards the suitcase.
Raised the rating for this, just in case...
John pulled his head back to look at Sherlock. The man was looking at him sleepily, but something told John he'd been awake for quite a while. "Keep going."
"But I love you," Sherlock agreed.
"The sheep was already contaminated before it came here, so it was hardly my fault,” he called to the kitchen.
“Right, ballet.”
“Bees?” John asked, looking at Sherlock, who was hanging his coat on the rack. “Well, yes…” the detective mumbled, taking John’s coat as well and then leading them to what looked like a very homey kitchen.
He heard a faint groan, but then Sherlock appeared from the direction of the living room. "John please, doing the laundry is not that important. It could wait another day. Besides I can think of much better things to do," he complained, wrapping his arms around John's waist. "None of that now, I've run out clean pants," John said sternly, wiggling out of Sherlock's grasp.
Sherlock was laying on his back, other hand sneaking underneath John’s shirt while the injured one was stretched above his head, hanging half off the sofa so that it wouldn’t get on the way.
"I want to." With that, Sherlock leaned in to suck his tongue. He actually went as far as to pin John's hands next to the doctor's head. When Sherlock lowered his mouth to John's collarbone and sucked again, John couldn't help moaning. He twisted his hands so that their fingers were entwined, which sparked Sherlock on.
Only now he drowned his sadness and melancholy in reading, at first about trains and then about biology and other subjects. And after spending the winter holed up in his room, desperate, barely eating and sleeping, John would then use the summer to run around and train the rugby tackles he'd read about in a book.
Sherlock raised his head to look at John, cautiously curious. Then he gave a tentative nod.
“Thank you,” he smiled, sipping the tea. “Why all this?”
There were long hallways with polished, shiny parquet and the floors were painted with a creamy natural white colour that seemed extremely posh to John. Sherlock led them to the end of one hallway and opened the door for John without saying a word.
After he dealing with his hard-on, John just spent a moment thinking about last night. Sherlock had been very enthusiastic, but that was probably the alcohol talking. He had been getting bolder though, and John just hoped Sherlock wasn't trying too hard again.
John was wrapped up in his thoughts and didn’t notice when the shower was turned off. He jumped a bit when he felt Sherlock wrap his arms around him from the behind. “You’re being uncharacteristically jumpy,” he mumbled, sounding tired but happy. “Lost in your head?”
“Sure we can, I just don’t know how nice it’ll be. Especially if Mycroft decides to stay longer. Lestrade’s bringing his social side out and it’s unbelievably tedious.”
“I had a dog, called Redbeard, when I was younger,” he explained when he’d greeted each of the dogs. “He had to be put down when I was about ten.”
Yesterday had been sunny, still full of summer, but today the blonde boy had woken up to the sound of heavy rain pounding on the south-facing window.
Mrs Hudson chuckled, and John could picture her satisfied grin. “Oh, it’s just something we do every year…  Anyways, Sherlock didn’t really say anything about it, just kind of… escaped? That’s a bit odd of him, he didn’t even say bye, which he always does. So I wanted to make sure he’s alright.”
With that, Sherlock went and flopped down on the sofa, leaving John standing in the middle of the living room with a dazed expression. That man killed someone because Sherlock had been in danger. Sherlock needed to arrange every detail properly, and not about the case, not really. It had turned out to be dull and too simple in the end and he had expected something more.
John nodded and took Sherlock’s hand, smiling at him. “That
“Well, I never had a pet since,” Sherlock shrugged, sitting down at the sofa. “We can one of the dogs out for a walk, if you like,” he added, smiling at John.
When everyone left, Sherlock and John cuddled on the sofa and listened to some relaxing piano versions of the Christmas classics. Eventually they decided to call it a day, which meant Sherlock dragging John to the bedroom and finally unwrapping his first gift.
John watched as Sherlock plopped down on the sofa and wondered. He wasn’t sure if he had really thought he could manage to shoot someone without anyone noticing, but Sherlock clearly wasn’t going to make a scene.
Christmas is seriously getting close and so preparations and relaxation are both on the list.
"You keep telling yourself that, dear."
Sherlock granted him a small sideways grin. "They don't, but I do. I don't know who the killer is but I know what he is. No one remembers seeing a strange car, not even the old ladies at the latest venue and you know curious old ladies, they're like security cameras. The victims disappeared from busy streets, no one remembers anything strange – you see what I'm saying?"
, he had to add. Even after the events at Lauriston Gardens today the doctor felt a pull towards the brunette man. John almost didn't care that he'd been forgotten and abandoned in under two hours after they first met - dear God, had it really been under two hours?
“Hmh?” John hummed, looking at him with a small smile.
The second show on Wednesday went just as well as the first, everyone seemed to know what to do already. John even managed to sneak to the edge of the stage and catch a glimpse of the ballet when Sherlock was on the stage, and he couldn’t stop smiling for the rest of the evening.
"But John. You wanted to talk. Presents." The brunette was clearly drunk, waving his hand in in the air dismissively, but he had his gaze fixed on John. John reached for his glass of wine. Sherlock must've thought it was something important if he bothered to remember that.
I meant to post this before Christmas since The Nutcracker is a Christmassy ballet, but I'm not exactly surprised it's already February.
I know this took me AGES, but I hope it's at least partly worth the wait.
It was poor luck that Molly happened to be a dancer too, since they both needed almost every day during the show week off from their afternoon shifts, and the café had only a few employees.
"I - uh, you're saying the killer’s... got an invisible car?"
As soon they reached the flat, Sherlock practically threw his coat on the rack and then rushed out of the flat. John frowned as he took off his own coat, hanging it on and trying to figure out what Sherlock was up to, since he was making quite a racket.
Again, John just pulled Sherlock to his chest and hugged him tight. “We’re all broken, Sherlock. You’re not going to ‘push me away’, I love you too much. And I already know how you can be on your worst." He felt the wetness of Sherlock's tears on his shoulder.
They got going as soon as John was done, Sherlock giving an address to the cabbie that John didn’t recognise. The cab left them in front of a big, beautiful building, and Sherlock led them inside. The place had a huge front hall with a big, detailed staircase leading to the upper floors, and Sherlock seemed to know where to go as he led John to the second floor.
~’*’~
"Only if you want to, I'm okay." John was suddenly very aware of what just had happened. "I'm happy if you want to just sleep right now, you were amazing."
"You just masturbated." John felt himself blushing right away. He should be used to how observant the other man was by now. "Umm," he mumbled and headed to the kitchen.
“You know, I’m not fetishizing ballet or anything, believe me…” John panted, his hips twitching under Sherlock’s as the brunet stroked him slowly, smirking from where he was straddling John’s thighs.
When the angel lifted the glass to his lips and took a sip, leaning his head further back and letting out a satisfied moan, Crowley felt his own trousers get tight, and he doubled his efforts. It took no time at all, the whole situation rather new and exciting, and in what felt merely seconds Aziraphale was coming, his free hand now gripping Crowley's hair rather tightly and guiding his head. Crowley had managed to slither a hand down his own pants, and the taste of the angel's come sent him over the edge. "Oh, God," Aziraphale mumbled, sounding quite out of breath. Crowley pulled back, grimacing as he pulled his hand out of his jeans. "Mmh, no. It was all me."
"Lauriston Gardens. We got a team there already, but I've told them to wait." Sherlock gave a firm nod. With that, the DI left the flat.
He knew Sherlock didn’t have that much extra money to spend on his ballet attire, so every new piece of clothing was considered closely. Plus, the new black slippers matched his old tights well, “making his legs look even longer” like Mrs. Hudson had said. John had agreed vigorously.
"I would have too. I have excellent taste buds, you can test me."
“What’s that mean?” John asked, looking at Sherlock. “What does she mean by ‘training’?”
Before John could say anything in return, the door they had almost reached flew open and Sherlock Holmes stared at them at the top of the stairs. The man looked completely baffled for a second before composing himself again. Then his eyes raked over John's form and the doctor was positive he was doing his brilliant thing again.
"What happened?" John furrowed his brow, "did you get hurt?"
After a while, Sherlock walked in with a big box, leaving it on the sofa and then looking at John rather proudly.
"I bet you already met Donovan? She can be rude, but she's right, he doesn't really have friends."
"Mm, but I'd like another taste. Just to be sure."
The detective didn't dare to risk a look at John's direction. Surely the doctor hadn’t been thinking that, no. This was probably too much, the blonde had been quite tolerating so far, but the moment on the coffee shop had proved that he did feel a bit awkward. Now Mrs. Hudson had –
Sherlock's palm hit John's arse cheek with a slap for the fifth time, and John let out a small noise. He groaned again when Sherlock touched the red skin and squeezed his plush buttock.
Sherlock answered by blushing fiercely. John smiled widely and got up, holding his hand for Sherlock. The detective felt like he should try to object, but John had made him weak and sentimental. And definitely not in a bad way.
As a teenager he’d sported the idea of being able to read his soulmate’s thoughts, but of course it didn’t work like that. They were sitting in a cab, on their way to see a flat, and John really had no idea why this man would be his soulmate. By the looks and sounds of things, the smart, gorgeous man should deserve something a bit better than an old, bored army veteran.
Of course Sherlock had other ideas, and the detective slid his hand underneath John's t-shirt to feel his stomach. John turned his head to receive a slow but deep kiss. After a while John had to pull away. Sherlock was watching him with his eyes dark and pupils blown wide.
“Yeah, it does qualify,” he chuckled with a soft smile, pulling him into a kiss. “Thank you, love.”
But John would walk up to him, pick up Sherlock’s feet and sit down. Then he’d start to massage them slowly, all Sherlock’s cranky mood melting away as John warmed up his calves and stretched his toes one by one carefully.
"I shouldn't be here." He turned sharply, nearly running onto John, before he realised he'd said that out loud. John was looking at him with a furrowed brow.
Sherlock moaned into the kiss, bending one knee so he could rub his thigh against John’s hardening length before breaking the kiss and pulling John towards the bedroom. John followed eagerly, shedding his coat and shoes on the hallway. Sherlock grinned at him and then pinned him against the doorway, kissing him again.
“No, we’ll save them for tomorrow. I already know what all of these contain,” Sherlock said with a grin, leaning in to kiss John softly and then whisper against his lips: “Besides, I’ve got something more important to unwrap today.”
There, right on top, was a lonely blue sock, exactly like the one on top of the drawer. John slowly paired them up and then looked at Sherlock who was laying on the bed already, looking expectantly at him.
When Sherlock came to find him after his part was done, he frowned and tilted his head a little. “What are you smirking about like that?”
John had trouble moving around at first, and he had to grip the edge of the rink every few metres while Sherlock glided gracefully next to him and tried to give him advice. After a while, John got the gist of it, and he could grab Sherlock's hand instead.
“I…” Sherlock sniffed and then tossed the garment at him. “Is it okay? For, you know, dancing?”
“Um, I – it’s not really a gift. Well, yeah it is, or I meant it to be…” he bit his lip again, shifting a bit and picking at the bow of the robe string. “And well, you got me something, so this should be a present then…”
Sherlock had been a whirlwind, leaving no time to really consider what was happening. Now that John finally got a chance to think and breathe, he was startled to feel a sting of yearning. Despite being a doctor and knowing about how people worked, he hadn't really believed in the 'love at first sight' that almost always featured in soulmate stories. But now John had to alter his regard towards the inexplicable soulmate bonds. And he still couldn't believe he'd met his soulmate. His soulmate, his bloody
And John did see it when he came back. A dark blue jumper that had rows of different Christmas-themed patterns like reindeer, Christmas stockings and gifts wrapped in a bow. The jumper was a little lumpy in a way that screamed ‘hand-made’ and John looked at Sherlock, who was holding the garment up. “Who did you get to make this? It’s not hideous at all.”
The detective was wearing his midnight blue gown and a reindeer antler headband. "Antlers, John! Don't be slow," Sherlock chirped before rushing off again.
“John?” Sherlock called his name tentatively, coming to the living room with a piece of clothing clutched against his chest. John frowned at him and lowered his textbook.
And oh God, did he suddenly feel old. Sherlock looked like he was in his late twenties at the most and John himself was almost 40, how could they work this out? A ten-year-age-gap sounded bad really and John had seen relationships destroyed over much smaller things.
Sherlock nodded against John's shoulder before raising his head. To John's relief, the detective was smiling.
Sherlock watched John shrug and talk as he thought. A hand gun, shot from across the street. The shooter had known what they were doing, hands extremely steady; experienced, accustomed to violence. But they waited until Sherlock had been in immediate danger, so strong moral principles. Strong nerves, perhaps military… Sherlock’s attention was caught by John’s right hand as he was explaining something.
The doctor took another look around. He suddenly felt quite lonely and he really had no idea what to do. Lestrade was going to go back to the body with the team, but then remembered John. "So who are you? His friend?" The DI turned to face John, looking dubious.
There is a house built out of stone
He entered their bedroom twenty minutes later with only a towel wrapped around his hips. "Oh, right. Should I wear clothes or not?" He asked, looking around the now dimly lit bedroom that had a rather professional-looking massage table in the middle of it.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock fell asleep after an hour or so, cuddled close to John. He must’ve been sleeping badly, since he slept for a few hours while John stroked his shoulders and arms softly, smiling down at him fondly.
Eventually the brisk air got too cold for them, and they packed their stuff and headed home, both of them grinning happily and their noses red from the cold.
"Oh God Sherlock. I want to make you feel so good." It was suddenly much harder to think, but there was something he wanted to try. "But if at any point you feel like stopping, just say 'red', okay?" Maybe having a safeword would make Sherlock feel more confident. Sherlock nodded at that.
"I'm assuming you recognised that too."
Just as the front door slammed shut, Sherlock jumped. "Yes! Four suicides and now a note! Oh, it's Christmas!" He closed his laptop and picked up his coat. Then he turned to look at John, who was just standing there, very confused.
Sherlock nodded and gave John a small smile before grabbing the bucket and dumping it in the fridge. Then he came back and dragged the sack onto the middle of the floor and crouched in front of it.
Sherlock tasted and froze. "This is - it's..." A bright blush spread to his cheeks. John removed the blindfold and smirked as Sherlock swallowed the mouthful of sperm.
"No, it's... I don't know. It's not like I’d get a lead part or even close anyways yet, but... I'd have to audition," he mumbled. "Probably just to become a dancing candy, John.”
"How do you know it's him?" John tilted his head to the window where Sherlock still took an occasional look every now and then. "I had the impression the police have no idea who it was?"
John snorted before bursting into laughter. He kissed Sherlock in between bouts of laughter until Sherlock decided to shut him up by pinning him against the fridge and then plunging his hand into John’s pants unceremoniously, cutting John's moan short.
John frowned. "What?"
make fun of your interests. I really appreciate that you’d show me all this, that you trust me with this.”
“Yes? You should dress up, I’ve already called for a taxi,” Sherlock said, smiling at him. John shook his head, snapping back to he moment. “Why did you get a suit for me? I’ve got a suit,” he mumbled, looking at Sherlock with his head tilted to the left.
They went into an empty studio that had mirrors covering every wall and a barre running through the whole room. Sherlock walked right to the back of the room, motioning John to come closer and then giving him the other pair of slippers.
(See the end of the chapter for
The next day, John found the envelope in his suitcase as he was fetching some papers from it. The card said ‘romantic outdoors ice-skating: vol.2’, and John chuckled to himself. Suddenly he couldn’t wait for his shift to end.
autumn coming."
"Mmm, you git. So, we're wrapping presents?"
"Yeah, sure you would've. And it was three. Three bottles." They kept walking in silence for a while until Sherlock scoffed.
Just like last time when they got home, John had to practically haul Sherlock into the bathroom, so he could take a shower while John made them something to eat before bed. Sherlock had been practically bouncing with adrenaline-fueled energy the whole bus ride, but he deflated as soon as they got home, complaining that he was way too tired to do anything anymore.
The next morning, Sherlock was still in bed when John woke up, sleeping soundly with one of his arms trapped under John’s pillow. John grinned at the sight, wrapping his arms around the brunet and nearly falling asleep again until Sherlock spoke. “You’re not going back to sleep, we have things to do.”
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Of course, Sherlock got his choreography right, and the practice only lasted for three hours because one of the leads and some background dancers kept messing up. John sat on the second row, watching them idly and wondering how brilliant Sherlock would look on a bigger, nicer stage.
Sherlock followed suit and pulled out a ball of fairy lights that were all tangled up. John chuckled and wrapped the tinsel around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him to the sofa, where they spent a good while untangling the lights and giggling.
“No shit, Watson,” Sherlock grinned, pecking his lips once again before pulling back and reaching for his coat and bag. “Let’s go home, then.”
Sherlock took John’s right hand and lifted it. “Look,” he held it in front of their face and chuckled.
John laughed and giggled and then pulled Sherlock into a kiss, cupping the detective’s cheeks with his mitten-clad hands. Sherlock kissed back and then they skated some more before they got cocoa and headed back home, both smiling happily with their red noses and blushed cheeks.
After breakfast, John tried to convince Sherlock that there was a Doctor Who Christmas special that he really had to see. Not that it ever worked really, but this time Sherlock did indulge him and didn’t even comment on the mistakes or discontinuity as often as he usually did. He even let John pop in another disc and they managed to get through a total of three episodes until decided he should get the turkey to the oven.
Sherlock giggled, pressing a kiss to John's chest and sighing happily. After a while he shifted again, looking at John. “You read the card, right?” He asked, sounding slightly nervous.
And so they ended up walking a dog around London. Well, they didn’t go very far, just to the nearest park where the dog – called Cleo, John found out – could stare at joggers running by and play in the frosty wilted grass. Sherlock seemed to radiate happiness even if he kept his calm façade on, and John grinned widely as he stood next to him, the fingers of their joined hands laced together.
That earned John a groan from Sherlock, even though he seemed to be smiling against John’s neck. “God, don’t remind me. I think I might be sick.”
They looked at each other for what felt like minutes but was more like a fraction of a second, but then Crowley shifted and moved his hands up towards Aziraphale's crotch. For a few seconds, the angel looked like wanted to make some sort of a ridiculous protest, possibly in the lines of 'But Crowley, we're not in the bedroom!' or some other chaste romance nonsense, but then he spread his legs just a fraction, blinked slowly and groaned out a small "please".
John pursed his lips, trying to ignore the image of Sherlock strolling around the flat on a new pair of tights and that leotard, and sighed. “Mmm, if you have time. Chemistry had never been my strong point.”
John moaned and tugged the ropes binding him to the headboard. As Sherlock pushed two almost dry fingers into him, he realised he might enjoy it much more than he'd thought.
With the gifts done, they turned their attention to the cards. John had no artistic blood in him, but with Sherlock’s aspiration for perfectionism, they managed to make the cards look rather beautiful. John handled the glue and taping while Sherlock cut, folded and tore materials into shapes and sizes he needed, giving John strict instructions on how to glue and tape everything into a well-balanced, aesthetically pleasing ensemble.
“What’s this?” John asked, confused when Sherlock gave him a piece of clothing that seemed to be… “Are these tights?”
"Are you sure it's your tailbone?" Sherlock smirked, face buried against John's neck.
John climbed the stairs and found the bedroom had indeed been cleaned. He had to thank Mrs. Hudson later. First he got out his gun and placed it in the drawers next to the bed. It was always the first thing he did so it would be easy to find when needed. His clothes and the few towels and sheets he'd brought with him were quickly sorted in the closets as well as his other possessions, but John spent almost thirty minutes just sitting on the bed and looking around, getting used to the feeling of the space.
Indeed, when they got back, Sherlock immediately dragged the suitcase to the centre of the room and started to rummage his way through it. John stood there, bag on his shoulder, feeling somewhat useless. As if on cue, Sherlock lifted his head.
Sherlock watched him, smiling fondly to himself. Everything was perfect, the tree, the wine, the atmosphere...
"Look at you, all happy. It's not decent," the landlady chimed, but Sherlock could see the smile on her face.
To his surprise, there was a seat specifically reserved for him. “Must be Mrs Hudson’s doing,” John thought as he sat down, smiling to himself. Right before the show began, someone came to hand John another bouquet of red roses with a side-note.
At some point, the scent attracted Mrs Hudson who appeared in their kitchen and got to taste all of the treats. She and John chatted while Sherlock started to fiddle with the last dough, making some weirdly-shaped cookies from it before putting the tray in the oven.
Ignoring the chiding "Sherlock!" the brunette hustled out. John called an amused apology and rushed to follow. Sherlock somehow caught a taxi immediately and they got in. After John gave his address, Sherlock dug out his phone and turned to face John. “Take out your phone.”
Next thing John knew was that the able was occupied by a warm plateful of pizza and the fussing aura of Angelo. Honestly, the loud Italian seemed to fill the space and air for a while with his questions and wines and pizza and before he knew it, John had a glass of white wine in front of him.
Just then the man Sherlock had introduced as Angelo turned up again with a small candle. Angelo turned to Sherlock, completely missing John's sceptic glare at the red piece of stearin. "So, what can I do for you? Anything on the menu, free for you and your date!"
“There’s a potential case,” he murmured into John’s ear, practically vibrating with energy. “Someone’s being blackmailed, and there are plans of a possible terrorist attack involved.”
The last show was on Friday, and John managed to sneak presentable clothes and a floral bouquet to the hall in his backpack. After making sure Sherlock was gone to get his stage make-up done, John changed into the black khakis and a button-up, trying to smooth down the creases on his shirt before grabbing the flowers and rushing to get a seat at the front row.
John was almost proud that he managed to get the whole thing typed without having to ask twice, though the brunette clearly slowed down for him. Indeed, looking up he saw Sherlock flashing him a somewhat one-sided smile. God he already loved that smile. John tapped 'send' and aimed a questioning look at Sherlock. "What is this about?"
John went back to kissing his neck and he stretched back to let him. True, his arm was a bit achy, but damn if he'd let it stop him now. In a fit of confidence, Sherlock pulled his hand back to grab John's hand gently go pull him back and kiss him, immediately taking over with his tongue.
"I'm sorry, that wasn't exactly how-" He was cut off by Sherlock's hips pressing upwards, Sherlock's hardness making itself known. John's breath left him in an involuntary gasp and he ducked in to kiss at the brunet's neck vigorously.
That wasn't the reaction Sherlock had been expecting, John didn't sound as disturbed as Sherlock had expected. The brunette looked at John quickly from the corner of his eye. He was smiling at Mrs. Hudson, but he did cast a small look at Sherlock's direction when he noticed him watching. So, he wasn't entirely comfortable either.
They slowly made their way round the rink a few times, and at one point Sherlock turned around so that he was skating backwards in front of John, holding both of his hands now. John grinned at him and tried to pull himself closer to the man, nearly making them both fall. Sherlock gripped his waist and laughed, the two of them coming to a halt as he leaned in to kiss John.
"Like moving here, I can see that." Sherlock cut in with a small smile, seemingly done with John's stumbling. "The fact that you already packed says enough about that, I'll get Mrs. Hudson to dust the upstairs bedroom for you."
With that, he buried his face back into Sherlock's naked arse and continued to push his tongue into the warm hole.
“John Watson, shut up,” Sherlock murmured with a grin, bending forward to kiss him briefly. “You’re way too talkative for someone who’s supposed to be drowning in ecstasy,” he purred quietly, tightening his hold.
"You know, I do take safety seriously sometimes," Sherlock chuckled, standing up and pulling a pair of mittens on. John got up too, and then they headed to the rink.
While he waited for the kettle, John tried to find something edible for them. Some shelves in the fridge looked like a biohazard, and the bread bin had more mold than bread in it. He found some eggs from a cupboard and carefully smelled each one after cracking it to make sure they weren’t off (a few were). How was Sherlock even alive now started to seem like a mystery to John.
Sherlock nodded and swallowed again. He took one glance at John’s crotch before he grinned and swiftly got to his knees in front of John. He licked his lips and reached for the doctor's belt.
A hard edge returned to Sherlock. "You have said repeatedly that you weren't gay, weren't interested in men, and not interested in me. With all of that, it would be hard for a person to develop feelings for the other," was the concise reply that was betrayed by a slight tremor.
"I'm John, this is Rosie. We're his, um... His family."
John put the bags on the kitchen table before shedding his coat. "I'll go put this in the closet, you dig in. You're eating."
Sherlock nodded, eyeing the door as he considered what he was about to do. "Wish me luck."
John shrugged. "Just to get out, get some fresh air, see that world hasn't imploded over night."
"Um..."
"Small?" John asked, sounding offended.
Sherlock smiled, huffed a small laugh as a genuine grin softened his angular features. “Then ask me again.”
"What was that meant to be?" John asked.
John stepped away from the stove, taking the pan and spatula and sliding a few pieces of bacon onto a pair of plates. "You need to eat, I know that you haven't eaten in days," John said as he took a seat.
"Yes, of course."
Sherlock nodded. "A bit."
Sherlock nodded and got up to do as John said. He knew John was right, that thinking the way he did would make him feel worse and that he should leave it, but he couldn't. Thoughts swirled in and out like the debris in a tornado or a hurricane, each one threatening to topple him over completely, but he couldn't focus on one, he couldn't stay in one place or purposefully go to another, he just kept swirling and swirling and it was enough to make him feel sick or want to cry or both simultaneously.
Everything felt so different to John. It was bright and open and positive and happy and he had no clue that he could be ever felt so complete. Of course, he would still be the soldier that never left the war, Sherlock would still be the drug addict, but now that they had made it they were just Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes.
John took a deep breath, rubbing his face in frustration. "Okay, how about I go put her down and then we'll sit on the couch and talk this over calmly, okay? I'm sorry that I sounded so harsh."
Sherlock hesitated, thinking. "You?" It came out as more of a question than he had intended.
"I need to apologize, face to face. That's how you always start fixing things, right? Apologizing?"
"Can't tell what's mashed up and without fingerprints or and ID we have no clue who this woman is," Lestrade explained. "Figured it'd be quicker for you to figure out than to wait for the dozens of people with relatives that look like her to come in."
John sat up, looking at the baby monitor and listening intently. "You see, I did something very foolish once. It was years ago, before your mummy and daddy met. Your father... You see, he cares about me. We sere best friends then, the closest any two people could get. He had been my first true, best friend since Redbeard -- or, Victor Trevor, I guess I should start calling him. No with Victor, because of the things I did and people I knew he... He got hurt very badly." John heard Sherlock's voice tremor slightly.
"Yes, I suppose."
"Writing to Lestrade?" Sherlock nodded. "About what?"
John decided to take pity on him and start the car. "You're eating at Angelo's"
"Because you didn't do anything wrong. You know that, right?"
"Maybe I want to change, too, Sherlock. I promise, never again will I be angry with you when all you need is my help. Okay?"
"Yes."
She was sound asleep, rattle loosely held in a chubby little hand as she dreamt. Her mouth moved in her sleep. “She's been a dream, rarely ever wakes up in the night anymore unless she needs a nappy change.”
"You're right." The tension in John's shoulders disappeared and he looked back at Sherlock. "I'm sorry that I made it about me. You have been hurting, physically and emotionally, this whole time and I've just sort of ignored it. I promise, no more shouting, I will listen and ask questions and you can answer or not. Please, explain how you feel."
Then John thought again about sharing a bed with Sherlock. He wondered if Sherlock ever had nightmares. John was now certain that the time Sherlock was away after The Fall was anything but a holiday. He had glimpsed at scars while he was in hospital, heard him mumbling whenever he slept during his short stint back at Baker Street. The fact that he killed a man for him and Mary and Rosie.
"Nope."
John smiled at Sherlock, feeling giddy excitement for getting to witness the beautiful brain of his work to its full potential again. "I am, yeah. But I'll still give you a ride, it's right down the road from Bart's."
Sherlock curled up on the couch, bringing his hands under his chin. "Very good," he said and John could see a small smile on his face. When John landed on a channel, Sherlock took his hand and held it loosely. John kissed the top of his hand, continuing to massage his curls and neither one of them had felt so happy and at peace in years.
"Come on, let's go inside, yeah?" John suggested. Sherlock nodded, being guided towards the large doors where a man the age of his parents stood. A young woman was holding onto his one arm while he shook hands with the other. The girl was his daughter, red hair matching Victor's. Sherlock swallowed, freezing to the spot because they should've gotten to see him, see their son's ginger hair one last time, see his freckles, but instead they only had a partial skeleton and pictures and it wasn't fair.
"My boy, I haven't seen you in years," he said as he took Sherlock's hand and patted him on the shoulder, smiling. "Who are these two?"
Sherlock hesitated, tempted to argue with himself. "Or maybe he will. Without Mary, maybe it's too painful here for him. I know without your mother it's too painful for me."
That's when he started crying, at first small tears that escaped then growing into sobs that shook his shoulders and drew the attention of those who sat near them. John just held his leg, then rubbed his shoulders, then when people got up and started talking Sherlock was able to quiet himself and listen while tears were still streaming.
It was close to one in the morning when Sherlock got up, clutching a spare pillow tightly to his chest as he traveled up the stairs silently. John's door was closed so he knocked on it gently. When no reply came, Sherlock was preparing himself to spend the night in the dark alone and turn around when the door opened.
"Just need someone to hold you, hm?" he asked. He only talked to her because he had read that a developing baby benefited from hearing people talking normally and classical music. Therefore no baby talk was permitted in his presence and the violin was included once per visit.
"I heard you learned Greg's name."
"That's the fourth time you've said you're sorry," John pointed out. He stood slowly.
"Text me when you need a ride back," John said.
"I'll put pants on first."
That was when Sherlock looked back at him and John had to tell himself to stop staring. He barely registered what Sherlock was saying to him.
"Sherlock, please listen to me." Sherlock slammed the kettle onto the stove. "Do you know why I was so upset that you had gone? Do you know why it took me two whole years to move on?"
"No, no, I'm sorry--"
The baby monitor came alive with wakeful baby talking and Sherlock smiled. "Looks like little bee is awake. Go get her while I cook?"
"Your hair looks messy," Sherlock mumbled as he reached up and started playing with John's still greying hair.
"Sherlock, I don't think she would want to see you right now," John warned.
It was late, which was probably why John told the cabbie to go to Baker Street. Sherlock didn't even look like he was listening, looking almost listlessly out the window as the lights flashed across his face like they were the shadows of his thoughts as his mind was working out whatever problem he had ignored the rest of the world to solve.
Rosie babbled back at him. "Yes, indeed, she was a dear friend of mine. Clever as I am, but as kind as your father. She would do anything to protect you and him. We had our disagreements, yes, she did shoot me once, but that was all alright."
He had to swallow before answering. "Thank you." When the light was out and Sherlock was dressed and John was gone it was worse. There were too many things to fix, too many monumental things to fix, things to miss and mourn, things he hadn't let himself miss and mourn and emote for years. He didn't know what was happening to him, but he was feeling too intensely, thinking too chaotically, he just wanted peace and quiet and sleep but he couldn't.
"No," Sherlock said quickly, loudly, and quite suddenly. He said it with such ferocity that John almost jumped. "I can't."
"Mrs. Hudson, have I ever told you how brilliant you could be?"
"You called me beautiful, though," Sherlock argued. John found that after creating a much more intimate relationship, Sherlock loved bringing up poetic things that John tells him. Everything he says is true, down to the last adjective, but he felt like it was because Sherlock wasn't used to someone calling him beautiful or radiant or anything like that. John didn't mind the repition.
"We can do whatever you want, Sherlock," John promised. Sherlock nodded, leaning his face into John's hand. "Want to head upstairs? Just to sleep?"
"Coffee?"
"Of course, love, we're already a real couple."
"I like running my hands through it," Sherlock replied. "And you weren't complaining."
“No, I think that it wasn't too long ago since you nearly died from your using and if you stay with Mrs. Hudson you can get away with not finally sleeping and instead coming up here.”
Sherlock quickly turned his attention to something on the wall to his left. "Of course I do, just not in the way she wants me to."
"You're forgiven. Of course you're forgiven, I'd follow you anywhere and I'd follow you to Sherindord again. Maybe not with your brother, though."
"Um... Yeah, okay, let's sit at our table."
"So, I think I'm going to go pick up Rosie around noon, stroll around the park maybe," John said.
Sherlock directed that cyan gaze to John. "Whenevdr someone assumes we're a couple, you correct them. Why didn't you this time?"
John also knew that he was watching Sherlock closely for other, more selfish reasons. Sherlock had melded into a pleasant routine that involved helping John with Rosie, cooking or picking up dinner, and then going to sleep next to John. It was a different kind of domestic compared to what John had seen. He was no longer loud, agitated, and angry. He was polite and kind, catering to anything John or Rosie would ask. And John found that it was a very agreeable Sherlock to know.
"Well, yeah. I expect to be with you for a long time, we live together. It makes sense. And your parents have already taken on the role of grandparents. They'll have Uncle Mike and Aunt E."
John grinned. “Dinner?”
"Solved this one in two hours," Lestrade said. "I figured if I gave him something to do it would make him happy."
"It's a lovely night," John said as he craned his neck upwards to look at the sky. "Really clear."
"I haven't said that in years," John argued. He hadn't mostly because Sherlock had been pretending to be dead and people were polite enough not to say anything while John was grieving. Then he was married and no one had made the mistake again. But while Sherlock was away, doing God knows what, he would let himself think about it. He imagined what a relationship with Sherlock would have been like and decided it wouldn't be much different to being flat mates.
"I think it is. And I further deduce that this has been what's made you so emotional lately, why you needed to come upstairs last night."
“Yes,” was the first word that John had heard Sherlock speak since they left the well behind. But he didn't move.
John felt bad for bringing up what Mycroft had said, felt partially guilty for Sherlock feeling like he needed to fix something. “Sherlock--”
“Don't try to apologize for anything, either.”
221B was recreated, smiley face and all, and reconstruction had completed. Rosie had been in 221C, John's old room changed to a nursery. Sherlock had been the one to suggest christening the new flat after dinner and a few minutes of sitting in front of the fire.
"I can put a shirt on," Sherlock offered shyly. He was still unsure of this particular mark, the scar newer, the memories behind it battling with the Fall for most traumatizing adventures of recent history. John could tell and he had to agree, but he found that he was drawn to it the same way he was drawn to Sherlock himself.
"You love her, Sherlock. I don't see it being so hard to believe."
John pulled away and Sherlock frowned. "Come on, let's get home, yeah?"
"What do you feel guilty about?"
"Dada," Sherlock answered in all seriousness. "Or Da for short because I know that's the way you like to say it sometimes."
Sherlock swallowed and John could hear it. "I don't know," Sherlock replied. John remembered her words, "I know what you could be," and decided that she had probably planned it like the bloody DVDs.
He picked her up, looking into the wide eyes as tears clung to her delicate golden eye lashes and almost made her eyes sparkle in an odd, sort of sad way. "I'm sorry I haven't brought my violin with. I'm afraid you'll just have to manage with hearing me talk." Rosie looked unphased by this. "Well, Watson, what to do now?"
"But the amazing part was that he came back. My brother tried to scare him, ask him to spy on me and feed him information. He not only said no, but he even came back to the flat and helped me solve the murders. Texted a serial killer for me and everything. It was brilliant, really, and then we had gone to Angelo's, where we went earlier today. But it was when he walked back in, after I showed him that case. I knew I had to find a way to charm him into sticking around. I didn't exactly know why I had to, but here we are. He's still putting up with me. So if you ever have doubts about your dad, I'll be happy to tell you that story again."
"You think she knew this was going to happen?" John asked.
Sherlock looked up at the ceiling, John's back towards him. Sherlock felt like he could focus. John's breathing, even and slowing by the second. His linens smelled freshly washed, the blankets a comforting weight around him as he inhaled deeply.
"Take your time," Sherlock replied in a monotone voice. So John went back upstairs and after burping and rocking, Rosie fell back asleep.
But John's lips quirked and he stepped aside to let Sherlock in. "We can share the bed tonight, yeah?"
Sherlock's mouth was hanging open, his eyes looming over John's face intently, searching for something. Then he looked sadly at John, frowning. "John, I put you into danger again, I was too focused on myself and I didn't notice Eurus and I had forgotten everything and--"
When John finished, he slid his hands down the lapels of Sherlock's dress coat and pulled the button closed. "There. Brilliant and dapper as always." John looked up at him with a small smile, a hesitant one, and Sherlock tried to smile back but he must've grimaced instead because John cupped his face in one scratchy palm and rubbed his thumb in small circles over his temple. "How are you feeling?"
Sherlock nodded because he knew that it would've been nice to see Victor grown up with a family, too.
Sherlock tried three times to do his tie, but each attempt ended in failure and right before Sherlock was to rip it off and tear his hair out, John came behind him and turned him away from the mirror.
"So we're friends?" Sherlock asked hopefully.
"I want to...whatever it is you want with me, a relationship. I--I do."
But now that John thought about it, it would change a lot of things. Mostly because John felt like it would fix something, whatever had been broken in Sherlock, to reassure him that he wasn't the only one who cared.
“I’ll walk for a bit,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock was relieved that His John always knew what to do. "The...feelings. The guilt, mostly."
And John fantasized that someday maybe they could be Watson-Holmes.
"Oh, poor dear, you look dreadful," Mrs. Hudson said with a pat to Sherlock's cheek.
He stood beside the bed, not knowing what to do until John returned with a T-shirt and trousers. "These will be short on you, but they'll manage," John said with a kind smile. It only made Sherlock want to break into pieces, figuratively and literally.
"Well, you sort of need them," John argued.
"Do you feel better? After today?" he asked.
"Yes, but if you're in for a cuddle I would rather have something more comfortable on." Sherlock had to agree because he would much rather have his pajamas on and maybe even a dressing gown.
Sherlock looked up at John, not necessarily looking stunned but definitely confused. "Why?"
"I can put the stroller in the trunk while you buckle her in," Sherlock interrupted.
"I found it very handy with dropped chemistry equiptment, although I have a special waste bin for it."
"Which is one of your good choices," Sherlock said matter of factly with a nod and Rosie tried to mimmick him by throwing her head forward, but instead just gave Sherlock a fright. "Okay, darling, I don't think you make very great choices sometimes, either."
"So you really can't sleep here without someone else?"
Sherlock scowled, he couldn't help it. John was looking at him, open and kind and Sherlock didn't know how to proceed or what would be okay to say or even how to out everything into words. "What can't you turn on and off like a tap?"
Sherlock stood clapping his hands tighter behind his back because he was scared to think of what it meant. He wasn't for John. He couldn't be anything to John because of what he had done and how's he's hurt him.
"But then I was threatened by Moriarity. Either I fed into his plan, fakes my death, finished his story, or my best friends would get hurt again. They were going to die again. I hadn't remembered that day, you see, I didn't know that it was this fear of losing people that made me jump. And I couldn't come back and reveal that I was still alive until I had taken down every person who was known to work for Moriarity. Two years of that and it was safe to come back. But it happened again. My best friend had hated me, found someone else, and then she died and... I can't be what you want, John, I've let you down so many times and I'm not the Sherlock Holmes I was before the fall."
John kissed Rosie’s forehead gently and patted her curling hair before finally tearing himself away. “I’ll call in the morning.”
"Why didn't you correct him?"
"You can't what?" John asked, a bit confused.
Sherlock didn't know what he wanted with the black box. He placed his hand on it, just to know that it was real, that his friend was real. The bright boy he knew had truly existed, it wasn't just his memory messing with him again. He couldn't think of anything in particular to say, either. His father had been right, there was nothing for him to feel bad for, he couldn't necessarily apologize. He was sorry that Victor was gone, but he knew that he just missed him and for some reason saying "I'm sorry" was the most effwctive way of saying that.
"A...a dad?"
"Okay, okay," John hushed as he pulled his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "We will do whatever you want, anything you want. Just know that I will do anything for you because I love you, okay, and I would never leave."
"That's good. It's still going to be a long time before you won't feel completely bad, but it's a start."
They kept walking, Sherlock noticeably more interested in his surroundings to John's relief. It meant that he really had snapped Sherlock out of his thoughts. John did admire his brilliance, but he saw how sometimes Sherlock’s thoughts would almost eat him alive.
"For what?"
"Glad to see you're back," Lestrade said. "Just like old times, right?"
'I know what you can become,' Mary's voice said and Sherlock decided that he should end the conversation quickly. "I agree. So Rosie can take the other room."
“Thank you, John.” Sherlock’s face didn't change.
He particularly felt Rosie to be a positive force when she smiled at him as he walked back into the house. It still felt like Mary, was still her place in Sherlock's mind, and then the guilt resurfaced. But Rosie smiled at him, looking like she thought he was the most interesting person she had seen with her big blue eyes. It was almost like the way John had looked at him, years and years ago.
"So does this nice thing mean that you'll be nicer to Scotland Yard, or do I still need to hear them rant about you?"
Sherlock sighed. "If you must know there was only one, officially, and he isn't relevant now therefore it doesn't matter what he was like."
Sherlock froze and turned to look at John in what he hoped was frustration and not shock. "John--"
Sherlock was missing it, however. Because he decided that chasing him through town to his home was enough of an adrenaline rush. He couldn't bear to see John hurt because of him, especially with Rosie waiting for them.
"Yes, of course." Sherlock nodded. "And you are eating it, you're getting a bit thin again."
"What happens if someone else dies?" Sherlock asked. "What if it's Molly or Lestrade? Or it's my brother and he still thinks that all I do is hate him or Eurus and she's still alone in there and crying for someone to just notice her."
It had been three weeks, two days, and thirteen hours since that night on the couch and John had kept to his promises. He hadn't yelled, hadn't lost his temper, hadn't even asked for anything relationship wise, either. Sherlock imagined all that would change once they moved back into Baker Street and he was comfortable enough to start leaving severed toes in the fridge. But until then, Sherlock felt safe in John's arms, grounded when he held his hand, and overjoyed whenever he kissed him and that's all he cared about.
"I hate when you're wise from experience like this," John grumbled.
"Okay."
"Is that why you've been so... Off? Because of me? Is it because you're scared of me?"
“Oh John, I was worried sick, every time I think at least one of you boys had learned to call on your mobiles you seem to magically forget and leave me fretting,” Mrs. Hudson scolded.
John looked like he had just woken up, his hair no longer set in place with product, his eyes looking puffy. Sherlock was happy that at least he could still deduce some things.
"What do you mean?"
"Hey, Sherlock, your parents want to know of Rosie should spend the night?" Sherlock turned to see his mother and father, his mother frowning at him before coming up to hug him tightly.
“Then I'm walking with you,” John replied. Sherlock briefly glanced at him. “Just the two of us, right?” He tried to joke, but if Sherlock understood his words then he didn't let on. John let go of his arm, stuffing his hands in his pockets and trying to think of something to say that didn't make things worse.
"So, little bee, what to discuss today?" Sherlock asked her. "I think I'd like to explain another thing to you and your daddy. It's very important to me and I think I made a fool of myself earlier."
Only when Sherlock pulled him by the sleeve, wordlessly asking him to stop, John focused fully on him.
"You got it? These words: 'What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out. 22 Northumberland Street."
“I could’ve afforded 221b on my own and I said I couldn’t.” John let out a laugh, obviously relieved. “Is that why you’re… sentimental? I told you that you can tell me anything, no need to be nervous.”
“He used some kind of drug, you slept for at least twelve hours.” John reached to steady him, a solid hand on his shoulder. The detective just grunted, irritated with himself.
“I’ll feed you up. Tomorrow the table, then?” John laughed, starting to make breakfast for them both.
“You think that’s a good idea? You usually squash every idea that I have.”
He went straight for the stairs, not waiting for an answer, though he heard John apologising to Mrs. Hudson. He grinned, and seconds later he heard John’s steps on the stairs. "Will probably be late, don't wait up. Nice to finally have something interesting to do."
The doctor was pounding into him, his thrusts shaking the detective roughly and breaking his every moan.
Sherlock woke up feeling fuzzy and mildly disoriented. He was tucked in his own bed, practically rolled up in a sheet. He tried to get up but his head wasn’t exactly sure which way was up. What on earth had he done? Finally, his struggles paid off as he managed to sit up. Freeing his hands properly was something trickier, and he fell right off the bed with an undignified yelp.
I didn't mean this to be a multi-chapter story but something happened, hopefully something vaguely good...
"Angelo!" Sherlock took John's wine glass the doctor had barely touched and, like it had been the plan all along, threw it on his face. John flinched back and could only stare as Sherlock patted his face with a napkin, the man smelling like an old drunk now. Angelo arrived and before anyone could even start to say anything, Sherlock was throwing the napkin away.
Some of the things Sherlock had listed were things John hadn’t realised about himself (‘I love the way you always tilt your head to the right when chewing, it’s cute’, ‘I love how you puff your chest out when we hold hands in public’) and some were so emotional that John wanted to just go back home and hug the man (‘I love you because you are you’, ‘I love the way you look at me when you’re about to kiss me’). Some of them were surprising and even odd (‘I love your toes’), and some were plain Sherlock (‘I love how you tolerate having body parts in the fridge’).
He ran his fingers around one nipple very lightly, tickling John. The blond shivered and bent down to kiss him again while his hands went to Sherlock's hips, caressing the iliac crests and his lower stomach, asking for permission.
This is a place where I don't feel alone
The army training base was as busy as he remembered it to be, and he instantly got hit by the nostalgic feeling when he saw a group jog by. They found a soldier who could show them around, and John was surprised to see Sherlock practically soak up all the information available like a dry sponge. He stared at the poor guy and asked questions, stopping at every small detail and fixing his deducing gaze into every passer-by.
Sherlock had to pull back again to stare at John some more. “Isn’t that – I mean you’re in
The blond hummed to himself as he made sandwiches, listening to the shower running. He couldn’t help but wonder if he should tell Sherlock the had gotten a ticket for the last show. He wanted to surprise him, but what if Sherlock came looking for him in the set during the performance and couldn’t find him? What if he got even more nervous, knowing John was watching? But John had seen him practice, it was kind of the same thing, right?
John sighed but shook his head again, tying off his apron. “I’m sure Greg doesn’t need it as much as I do,” he muttered. “You know I’ll be helping with the props, and you know as a dancer how much it would mean to Sherlock as well that I’ll be there. Besides, I let you know about it before Greg did, didn’t i?”
Oh God. Did that mean...? No, John knew he should shut up now, but something made him press on. Hopefully he didn't seem as nervous and completely freaking out as he felt.
"John, yes. I love you." He was already out of breath and moaning his name. "Could we try this with - with clothes on? It's not so... overwhelming."
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist. "I don't like them."
Sherlock closed his eyes and exhaled and felt like his head was clearing. Because it didn't smell or feel like Mary or the well or Redbeard, it was all just John and Sherlock didn't hurt as much when all he thought about was John. "Good night, John," Sherlock replied. He closed his eyes and fell asleep to the sound of His John breathing.
"How come you haven't solved it? It's easy enough for Lestrade to," John said.
Sherlock hadn't moved, his hands clasped tightly in his lap as he looked down. John sat next to him, about to say something to get the conversation going when Sherlock said. "I made you tea."
Over that time John was watching Sherlock closely, for a handful of reasons, really. He needed to see that Sherlock wasn't so jittery anymore. He started taking his coat off without being told, started coming to bed with John without being invited first, and he had stopped the long silences plauged by darting, wide eyes and a frightened look.
"Enough, John." Sherlock got into the passenger seat, closing thd door with more force than necessary, but not exactly slamming it. John secured Rosie into her seat, talking to her in light tones before getting into the driver's seat.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "John, honestly..." He looked like he was going to say more, but stopped himself, frowning bitterly before standing and taking his plate with him. "I'll go with you to pick up Rosie," he said quietly before depositing his dishes into the sink.
Sherlock looked down, deflated. “I suppose your skills of deduction are improving.”
John flopped back into the mattress, sighing loudly.
So when Sherlock stared at him, his eyes searching for something in John's expression, his sharp cheeks softening with a faint blush, John found that he barely had the voice to continue. "Because it's fine, you know."
"No, thank you. Excuse me." He went back out into the living room, took his clothes from the day before, and went to change in the bathroom.
"Look, Sherlock, I--"
Sherlock knew John was grinning, he had to be because it was the first time that Sherlock had said it aloud. "I love you, too."
"Because you're Sherlock Holmes." Sherlock smirked a little at that. John wasn't sure how to continue. If he should hug him, keep washing dishes, or just go retrieve the small baby that was sure to make everyone in the situation much happier.
"Yes, it is," Sherlock agreed.
So when Sherlock woke up and dressed for seeing Molly, he texted Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson.
"Of course. 221B is really the first home I've had in a long, long time. And I couldn't leave you all alone. Besides, we've got cases again, and I heard once that you'd be lost without your blogger."
"Sherlock, just stop for a second and look at me, okay?" Sherlock sighed, briefly gathering what little remained of his emotional wall and looking up at John. "Sherlock, I have been out of line. Completely. You didn't do anything wrong, I was just upset and feeling guilty myself and instead of having you help me like you always do I blamed it on you. Nothing that I said or did was right. You're not a liar, you didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it, and I have been so lucky to have a friend like you who didn't give up on me."
"He said so much with his actions. He did get caught in a drug den after your marriage, I thought anyone would be able to connect the dots."
"I'm not trying to make you feel better I'm trying to tell you how I feel!"
Sherlock popped the trunk. "I'm just finishing details, thought you would be hungry."
Sherlock had gone back to retrieve clothes from Baker Street, the pick up being cut short after the text from Lestrade and Sherlock forgetting about it until towards the end of lunch.
"Oi, you okay?"
“You're supposed to say ‘Starving’,” John said. “I say dinner, you say starving.”
"Completely."
Sherlock was sitting in the chair, a silent Rosie looking up to see John the same moment that Sherlock did. John thought of them as his beautiful family.
"He's right, you know. If you feel guilty about it or if you still feel guilty about trying to forget him, don't."
Mrs. Hudson laughed at him, short giggles like someone had said the funniest joke she's heard all week. They even started to bordsr cackles by the time she calmes down and took a breath. "Oh, sorry, love, I just thought you knew! Of course he does, has for years, broke his heart to see you married."
"I know you are, darling," because John was past forgiving Sherlock, he had forgiven him a long time ago.
"What do you think she'll say?" Sherlock asked him as he popped up his coat collar.
“I’ll go down to Mrs. Hudson--”
"John," his voice cracked and he hated it. He closed his eyes, hoping that the burning would go away. "I know that I've previously apologized for past grievances that I have caused, but know that I am deeply, profoundly sorry for what happened at Sherinford and in the well with Eurus. You of all people didn't deserve it, your daughter didn't deserve to be orphaned, and I am so sorry that I hadn't thought first and--"
Sherlock wanted to touch himself, he'd been on the edge for a while now, but the way he was positioned meant he had to grab the edges of the desk or he'd fall.
“You weren’t even following the practice,” Sherlock complained, hanging up the costume and stuffing his slippers into his bag. “I was going to ask your opinion on the Nutcracker’s costume, but I can tell you didn’t even pay attention. I thought you wanted to see how the practices go.”
There were actually quite many things to talk about. John wasn’t sure what Sherlock was thinking about this whole thing, about their status as soulmates. He clearly wasn’t used to people, at least that was the impression he gave last night at Angelo’s. John still cringed at his awkward attempt at conversation at the restaurant. He was usually better with stuff like that, both on a date or with friends.
"But I do like the idea of giving you...something." With that, the detective awkwardly left his end of the sofa and stumbled to straddle John's legs. Then he bent down to place a heated kiss on John's lips.
And that was the thing with his angel. He was the sweetest, purest being, loving and enjoying all of God's creations. But deep down he was a straight-up bitch, taking no shit from anyone. And then, even deeper down, he was a total hedonist, knowing what he liked and taking it all when he could get it. And luckily Crowley was capable and more than willing to accommodate as he took the glans in his mouth and sucked, sending Aziraphale's hips twitching up.
"But she turned herself in! She must've know the sister would call the police!" Sherlock had of course been right about everything as usual, but John could see the detective was disappointed there hadn't been a chase or anything.
“I’m John Watson, and maybe I could buy you a coffee? You could tell me all about my brother, if you want to that is,” he added, probably a bit baffled by Sherlock’s still ongoing stupid staring.
"What?"
John moaned a little and reversed their position, Sherlock against the mattress while John sat on his abdomen, pinning his wrists next to his head. “Yeah? Ride you?”
Sherlock blinked a few times. No one had said that before, never. He was a freak, rude, always insulting people by saying things like that, not thinking about what was coming out of his mouth as long as it was true. Everyone he knew said he was a psychopath.
"Yes, that's it." Sherlock started to sound more urgent, so John brought a hand to rub at his lower back soothingly. "It's okay, I've got you. Just let go."
John grinned and nodded. “Alright, that’s a great plan.”
John chuckled and put the book aside, standing up. “Mhm, alright then. Is rice and veggies alright?”
"I wouldn't say it's dangerous just yet."
“Obviously,” Sherlock mumbled, blushing gently but smirking at John.
He finally opened the list during his first break at work, realising the list had at least two hundred things on it. He only managed to read the first twenty or so during his break, completely overwhelmed by the gesture.
Sherlock blushed very lightly and rocked back on his heels. “Well, you can help me out here, but most of the work is already done. So, um… yes?” he mumbled, nodding towards the bowls.
"It's December first." Sherlock announced, as if that date should hold any meaning to John, who just grumbled. "And I'm tired, let me sleep."
Massages became a regular occurrence, even though Sherlock quickly got used to the new standards and rarely got so sore anymore. But secretly he did like to have John take care of him, so he just shrugged and nodded every time John offered to massage him. Of course John knew this, so he made sure they would have time every Saturday morning for that.
It was their first Christmas together as partners. Before, they had always had company if they celebrated at all. And after the last Christmas he had had to spend with Mary, John was extremely ready to finally start the rest of his life with Sherlock, who had so far been heartbreakingly nervous and unsure about them. John felt the need to assure him whenever he could, and having a real Christmas with him was something he absolutely wanted to do.
The next stop was at the outer parts of the city, quite far from the busiest traffic and tall buildings. When they got out of the cab, John looked around in confusion. It was a small property with an even smaller cottage, which meant there was space for a huge garden and John could imagine it would look quite nice at summer.
On the plate was a pile of extremely tiny gingerbread hearts, only slightly larger than Sherlock’s thumb print. Somehow, they had managed to maintain their shape even in the oven, but Sherlock could see they were a little different from each other, unique. John giggled a bit. “I cut them freehandedly, took me ages. Now take the tray, will you. There’s a new batch coming and they’ll burn in seconds if I’m late.”
Lestrade called after breakfast and stole Sherlock's attention with a potential serial killer.
They also made miniature versions of each other and propped them up at the entrance to the gingerbread castle. John noted that the figures looked like they were up to something, to which Sherlock simply stated that they were looking for a quiet corner for a quickie.
“Is that why you’re still in bed, looking so very busy?” John asked, pulling Sherlock closer and nuzzling his neck. “Just give me ten more minutes.”
John seemed fine now, so Sherlock didn't want to break the comfortable silence to ask about it. He had started to whistle, and Sherlock decided that whatever it had been, it could wait until after the holidays.
“That’s a yes then?” he asked, crouching down too to pet the puppy, who greeted him with wet kisses too.
John hoped he could see the show from the audience, maybe on Friday when they’d dance for the last time. With all the costumes and props and Mrs Hudson’s fussing as she sent dancers out to the stage and greeted those returning from there, it all seemed very official and professional.
“No, it’s not that, I just...” Sherlock shook his head again. “I just realised we are a family. I guess I never thought of us like that, didn’t think anyone would want to… I’m so lucky to have you still here.”
In the end they all had a nice time, the conversation getting smoother after John got out the food and they all gathered around the kitchen table. Molly’s fiancée turned out to be a hilarious woman, and even Sherlock’s mouth turned up at her jokes.
John grinned and pocketed the card, rubbing his hands together. “Alright, where can I get an adorable apron like yours?”
“How do you want me?” John mumbled, looking into Sherlock’s eyes. “You’ve got the lead.”
John just laughed as Sherlock turned beetroot red and straightened his back. “I’ve checked that all the pieces are there,” John told her, patting Sherlock’s shoulder as a hint to head to the dressing rooms. “We’ll just get this costume off so it won’t be at risk,” he added, chuckling.
Later, John would ask Sherlock how the brunet felt about his presence, why it didn’t make him more nervous. That was indeed weird, but at the same time it was nice to know that he was indeed able to share his dancing with John, he didn’t want to hide anything from the blond. He had gone for so long having to hide it from other people, only Mycroft knew and he didn’t care. And maybe John even understood his explanation since the blond gave him the tightest, happiest hug Sherlock had ever received.
"Sherlock, you don't have t-"
Friday morning, John left Sherlock sleeping on their bed and left for work, grinning as he realised how loose and relaxed he was feeling. He’d have to ask Sherlock to massage him again and maybe he could learn a few tricks so he could return the favour, it’d be only fair.
And Sherlock did. He gave a long, ridiculously erotic moan and went rigid on top of John. After giving him a moment, John turned them both to lay on their sides and watched as Sherlock came down from his high. Finally, he opened his eyes and looked at John.
And now they were here, they were really here. John had claimed Sherlock as his and Sherlock would never let him go.
Held on as tightly as you held on me
When he stepped in, John realised they were in a locker room of sorts. But instead of the gym hall type of metal lockers, the walls were covered in very expensive-looking wooden cabinets. Sherlock opened up one cabinet to reveal a bunch of mostly white clothes.
Sherlock almost blushed, shrugging. “I guess we’ll see it then.”
“I-“ Sherlock’s answer turned into a moan, and he buried his face against John’s face for a moment before trying again. “I want you to ride me.”
And the way Mrs. Hudson nodded at him approvingly on the next lesson made him grin widely on the inside, however hard he tried to stay neutral. He had had no idea dancing – really dancing – could make him so happy, from the actual dancing to everything related to it.
They cleaned up and cuddled close to each other under the covers, sharing kisses until Sherlock got up to get them some late-night snacks. They ate, talked about the ballet a little, left crumbs on the bed and eventually fell asleep mid-conversation.
“The perfect timing. How long have you been waiting at the door?” John asked, amused. He abandoned his phone and sat up, leaning to the headboard.
“I just happen to have excellent hearing,” Sherlock shrugged, smiling too as he settled the tray on the bed, climbing in too.
I climbed the tree to see the world
“W-what?” The blonde man’s voice was small and he looked extremely shocked now. Temper now rapidly subsiding, Sherlock actually felt he should say something, probably apologise. He took a quick breath. “I’m sorry, it’s just – “
"I have no idea what you mean." John chuckles and bends forward to kiss Sherlock's neck, the caress turning into a bite when Sherlock lifts a hand to hold him still.
~'*'~
After they pulled apart, John rushed to pull the suit on, and they got into the taxi. Sherlock directed the driver to The London Coliseum, and John immediately frowned.
“Where’s the worst pain?” Sherlock closed his eyes at the attention to his muscles and considered the question. John added pressure to his movements and Sherlock opened his eyes again, smiling. When he did that though, a blush started to spread over his cheeks and he swallowed, smile almost faltering.
Sherlock wasn’t very keen to show affection outside their small student flat but somehow he couldn’t stop playing with John’s fingers, the two of them holding hands the whole way to the studio. Even though John was usually the one to initiate casual touches and cuddles and things like that, he definitely didn’t mind.
John watched as Sherlock plopped down on the sofa and wondered. He wasn’t sure if he had really thought he could manage to shoot someone without anyone noticing, but Sherlock clearly wasn’t going to make a scene. The brunet was really too calm about it, but then again so was John. He glanced at his hand again. Perfectly steady. He hadn’t really noticed going running after the cab or forgetting his cane. It had just happened, and now he’d slept fine and still continued to pace the flat without the slightest sign of pain this morning.
“Of course,” John smiled, taking the lube and slicking his fingers up while Sherlock slipped out of the panties and straddled the blond’s hips. “We’re so using those panties again, by the way,” John mumbled, kissing Sherlock and rubbing a fingertip at Sherlock’s entrance.
"Umm, yeah, that was uh... Not good. I mean," John started to babble awkwardly. "Anyway, I got home alright and had some time to think about... things. Like – "
John couldn’t decide whether to look at Sherlock’s face or his own lap. “It’s just, I mean I’ve seen you dance, obviously, and you’re always happy after you’ve practiced… It’s something you want, or I thought… It’s fine if you rather not, it’s all f-”
When the blonde started to look a bit concerned, Sherlock finally told himself to get it together and opened his mouth again.
, and John couldn’t have been happier. Of course, there was schoolwork to do, but they muddled through together, quite focused on the ballet for now. John swore he’d catch up when the three shows were dealt with, but for now he wasn’t even in the mood to revise chemistry or maths or psychology.
, John thought bitterly. Remembering how badly Sherlock’s interests had been received by the world, even his parents, so far was an endless source of angry, adrenaline-filled energy for the blond, and he opened his mouth before he chickened out again.
"Oh, right. D'you have a boyfriend then? Which is fine by the way." No, why couldn't he shut up? Damn Angelo and his candles and dates, they started this whole thing.
With Sherlock’s impeccable accuracy they build a gingerbread castle decorating it with sugary icicles and suspiciously wonky gingerbread pine trees since John was a bit too tipsy from the eggnog to cut the trees up correctly, which amused Sherlock to no end.
Finally, the Christmas day arrives.
They ate the sandwiches in comfortable silence, and then Sherlock insisted on feeding the apple slices to John, dipping them in honey and yoghurt. John giggled but ate most of them and then made Sherlock finish the last few. Then they just leaned into each other and finished their cups of tea.
Sherlock rolled to his back now with only the smallest wince. “You demanding for me to participate would be selfish. I don’t mind. Just get on with it, I need to use the loo soon and now I really want to watch.”
Sherlock shook his head, tugging on the duvet while John tightened his hold on the garment. "No, it's your day off. But Jooohn," he complained, pulling John's pillow from under his head.
~'*'~
Sherlock could feel his orgasm nearing and grabbed John's hand through the fabric, guiding it towards his nipples. As soon as John got the hint and pinched one of them, Sherlock let go and plunged his hand straight down the doctor's pants and boxers.
“I was there just a few minutes longer than I should have, nobody would have noticed a thing if I had been more careful. But apparently telling the caretaker his wife is cheating on him wasn’t the smartest thing to do. Honestly, I was trying to distract him to get away and it just slipped out.”
Sherlock hugged John tight and then asked him to help look for a set of lights from last year (“We have to have at least that”). They found one and hanged it on the mantelpiece, John trying to manage it while Sherlock tried to snog him to the floor. The room was dimly lit with the colourful glow, and Sherlock was smiling again. They returned to the couch and Sherlock let John feed him the tiny hearts and tea until they fell asleep on the sofa again.
John chuckled, pulling back to look at him. “Let’s fix us something to eat, then. You’ll need your strength.”
“Why did you buy one of these now?” John prompted, folding the piece of clothing carefully and leaving it on the coffee table.
Christmas Eve, dinner and more feelings since I'm apparently unable to keep it light.
"That was brilliant," he sighed, pulling Sherlock into kiss. "But now be both need another shower, let's go."
Sherlock accepted the gift with a shrug and carried the box to his experiment cupboard right away. Then he got back to the living room, wringing his hands nervously. “John?”
“Sherlock?” John was probably already antsy to get home. Damn, this was likely embarrassing, Sherlock needing to be escorted like a little child. Sucking in a breath, Sherlock yanked his now minutely trembling hand from John’s, trying to fight the irrational impulse to hug the short man.
Next day John got a text from Sherlock just as he was about to leave the clinic after finishing his shift. It only contained an address and nothing more, but John realised it must’ve been another surprise, so he rushed out of the building and got a cab, giving the address to the cabbie with a big smile.
“Mistletoe,” the detective smiled, lifting the bundle for John to see. “Well, a plastic one, but the idea’s the same… Well, not that we have to hang it here, if you’d rather not to,” he rambled, twirling it in his hands. John smiled fondly and pulled Sherlock closer, pressing finger onto Sherlock’s lips.
After dividing the scramble to two plates and fixing two cups of tea, John brought them to the living room where Sherlock seemed to be still doing whatever he did. John waited for a while but when the food started to go cold he cleared his throat and told Sherlock to eat.
As the show date crawled closer, Sherlock became nervous and snappish. But between practicing and studying, he seemed to need John’s presence no matter how crabby he tried to be. John smiled secretly to himself every time Sherlock cuddled close to him and still insisted he didn’t need it as he nuzzled his face against John’s shoulder.
John wanted to point out that he still knew absolutely nothing about ballet or the clothes needed in it, but he held his tongue and lifted what he now recognised as one of those one-piece garments which most of the other dancers wore, but he couldn’t recall the name of it. It was dark green and made of something light and silky, and John nodded as he ran his fingers over the material.
~'*'~
The two men spent the cab ride to the crime scene in silence. John watched the changing scenery through the window, and Sherlock kept stealing glances of the man. He would definitely have a moment to sort out his feelings towards this whole thing. But right now, all he could think of was the case. He'd been following the situation closely and now he finally had a chance to get into it, so he would make the most of it.
They did kiss quite a lot, but this was different and brought a sort of a novel feeling to kissing. Sherlock would glance at the mistletoe sometimes, blatantly inviting John to press soft kisses to his lips which he rarely did now that he’d gotten more confident with intimacy. John found it adorable and sometimes he’d tell Sherlock just that, but more often than not the doctor would just kiss him back, making sure Sherlock knew how much John loved kissing him.
Sherlock gave a somehow desperate hum. “I know, you’ve said. I want to, I do, it’s just -” He took a breath and reached for John, looking nervous. “Would you walk me there?”
a big thing. I’ll be there,” he promised, pressing the stop button. “It’s going to be your first official audition, after all.”
“You know you can kiss me without the mistletoe too?” John giggled when they broke apart, their noses touching. “Mmm, but I like the idea,” Sherlock grinned back, kissing him again. John lifted his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders and then frowned.
Friday's surprise became clear when Sherlock dumper a huge pile of different wrapping papers, pens and markers, ribbons and small Christmas-themed card decorations on the floor and then stuffed an envelope into John's hand before fetching the bag of presents they'd bought.
Sherlock almost froze on the spot. He hadn't thought about that, and now Mrs. Hudson was making her own assumptions. Sherlock couldn't think of a reason why she would be thinking that he and John were like that. He hadn't said anything, and she had just met her.
John had never stressed about his Words when he was young. The phrase was something so peculiar that if he ever heard it, he was sure that would be his soulmate. He knew he was extremely lucky; people could rarely know what kind of words their soulmate would have on their body. He had heard of a case when one person had found two soulmates while working as a chatty receptionist, but those things rarely happened.
When he finally couldn't take it anymore, John dumped his mug in the sink and pulled on his coat with a peeved sigh. He was so nervous even his hand had completely stopped shaking for a while. Hopefully things worked out because John really wasn't very fond of feeling so uncertain all the time.
Sherlock laughed and scratched the behind of the puppy’s ear and he could hear John’s chuckle, sounding relieved. Sherlock looked up at him, giving him a genuinely brilliant smile. “John, I…”
They spent that day trying to locate the killer before there’d be another murder and ended up staying overnight. John napped on the couch on Lestrade's office, and Sherlock apparently didn't need to sleep after just having slept the whole night.
Sherlock shares a few things about himself that John didn't know, and the fluff continues.
The doctor decided to go home, he'd visit Sherlock tomorrow. Maybe Sherlock could learn from his "mistake", though John wasn't entirely sure the man worked like that.
Why does his brain keep blacking out like that? He hadn't even thought about the soulmate thing as a relationship status yet and now he almost zoned out at the thought of dating Sherlock.
"Well put it on, we're going out. Come on." As John got up, rather slowly due to his confusion, Sherlock's gaze dropped to John's feet, scowling. He was already at the top of the stairs. "Where are your shoes? This is inconvenient, now hurry up. If murders make you this slow, we must rethink this arrangement." It was delivered with a little smirk and John's worry dissipated.
That was why he was surprised to hear Sherlock crying out a panicked "Red!" when he reached for his trousers.
"So, umm... Well, d'you – "
"Git."
'The angel must know what he's doing,' Crowley thought, barely managing not to clench his jaw as we watched Aziraphale. The heavenly bastard was currently running his tongue along the neck of the wine bottle after uttering "oopsie, I spilled" cheerfully, and Crowley was really rather sure neither of them had drunk That much, even if they were rather steadily getting past tipsy. "Hng," he commented, not sure if Aziraphale could see him watching from behind his sunglasses.
And of course there was a catch, there always was. You could die without your soulmate. Naturally, everyone dies in the end but the ones who did find their pair always died peacefully, usually of old age. The "soulmate deaths" were clearly different. Mostly it would be violent or just plain painful. They could be shot or stabbed, or they could commit suicide, have a fatal cancer or whatever. But the wound or tumour was always right where the person's Words were on their body, and no one knew how long they had.
“I’m sorry I ruined the roast today.”
John's adorable giggle broke the silence. "Merry Christmas day, Sherlock."
Mrs. Hudson.
"It's bloody two o'clock in the morning, it's basically Christmas eve already. This must be the most ridiculous time to do Christmas preparations, and I’m drinking caffeine at the moment." Sherlock did chuckle but John could see that he wasn’t fully in the spirit. “Tea contains very little caffeine.”
Luckily, he got a grip on himself during lunch break and managed to avoid embarrassing himself. God, he felt like he was fifteen years old all over again, which wasn’t a bad thing by itself. It was actually brilliant how Sherlock kept surprising him all the time, even though they took things very slowly. There was always some way Sherlock could surprise him without going forwards too quickly and he would find it each time, and that always made John love him even more.
“’Christmas cookies and other treats’?” John read aloud, grinning at Sherlock. “You’re baking for me?”
But he breathed in and breathed out and then hit ‘submit’.
The bathroom was dark except for the candles on the edges of the sink and corner of the bathtub. There were a few bags that John supposed contained herbs, and a few oranges with cloves, making the room smell nice and Christmassy. The bath was filled with water and slightly orange bubbles.
John tried to mimic Sherlock’s position, still feeling quite silly. Sherlock turned around and fixed his hand and hips a bit, now wearing the lovely look of focused concentration. John found that he didn’t actually care about how stupid he looked, if it made Sherlock look at him like that.
But honestly, I'm surprised I managed to finish this at least somewhat in time, I wish I had such commitment to school stuff too lol
"Mycroft?" John wasn't sure if he should just leave. Lestrade looked fairly anxious to get to work, but this might be John's only chance of learning things about Sherlock for a long while. The man himself might not want to tell him anything.
Sherlock got a book in beekeeping from Mrs Hudson, a tea assortment from Molly, a few old unsolved cases from Greg and a big box of premium chocolates – to share with John – from Mycroft. John in turn got a fluffy, warm-looking jumper from Mrs Hudson, another jumper from Molly and a small basket with a selection of crafted beers in small bottles from Greg. Sherlock had given his gifts, a brand new laptop and a night in a spa hotel, earlier. But John had yet to give him a gift, and he couldn’t find any extra parcels from under the tree.
"What was that for?"
"I haven't heard of that."
Realising he was staring at his paperwork like a love-sodden idiot, John chuckled to himself and continued filing the last papers, quite ready to get home.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I will. Bye,” John said, ending the call and returning to the bedroom, where Sherlock was no sitting up and looking at him with a questioning look on his face. "Mrs. Hudson called. She wanted to make sure you were alright,” John explained, crawling back to bed and pulling the covers up.
He continued to shout "Cretino, out you drunk. And don't come back!" even when Sherlock stumbled on his feet on the other side of the street.
"I remember last year you complained about the autumn tainting the air."
John smiled through Sherlock’s fumbling speech, holding his hands gently and then leaning in to kiss his cheek. “You mean you want to keep bees when we retire?”
Oh wow I actually wrote quite a lot, be proud! Also why can't I write stuff without smut, I was trying to save it for later.
Sherlock let out a sigh that John could only describe as compassionately tolerant. "There's no phone. No phone in the case, no phone on the body. Where could it be? Think, John!"
John swept through the things quickly, having no idea what Sherlock was after. "Uh, no? Who did I just text? The murdered lady?"
"Oh, that was really nice, I wouldn't mind doing it again to be honest," John nodded with a big grin. Sherlock gave him a happy nod and then disappeared into the bedroom. John did as he was told, drinking his coffee and then heading to the bathroom.
“You’re so gorgeous. Oh, fuck, Sherlock.”
Sherlock nodded, looking at their joined hands rather than at John. “That was just an idea, it’s not –“
“Well, I intend to celebrate, but it’ll happen at home,” Sherlock said in a low tone, making John’s heart beat a little faster for a moment. “Oh, I see,” he grinned, licking his lips. “We better get home quickly, then?”
"God, we're never doing it again here," John groaned, painting as Sherlock let his legs down. "My tailbone is killing me."
?” He sounded so weirded out by the idea that John once again doubted himself.
“Put that thing down, would you?” John commented playfully, kissing Sherlock’s nose over the screen before walking to the fridge. “What do you want for breakfast? I recon the eggs are still edible unless you’ve decided to stuff the kitchen with yet another experiment,” he huffed. “God know this place is always full of test tubes and human organs - “
“Merry Christmas, John,” Sherlock replied, leaning back a little. He could feel John smile as he kissed his neck again, before pulling back and retreating to the bathroom to wash up. Sherlock made him a cup of tea and toast meanwhile, and he was rewarded with another smile when John came back, now smelling of spearmint toothpaste and wearing his robe.
John nodded and kissed him, letting go of Sherlock’s wrists so that he could run his hands up and down his chest, pausing at his nipples to tease them for a moment. Sherlock made a sound, sucking on John’s lower lip a little. “C’mon John, please.”
He smiled fondly at the smaller children when they jumped and leaped around the tree and clapped after the snowflakes finished the first act with particularly impressive leaps and twirls. Since Mrs Hudson had decided not to have an interval, John kept clapping until the second act began shortly. Occasionally when his turn came, Sherlock leaped through the stage with a string of other miscellaneous candies. John clapped shortly after each time, smiling fondly to himself.
They got home alright, John still shivering from the cold. Sherlock fussed over him, getting him out of the still-soaked clothes and checking that he was really okay. Then he ran a bath for John, practically pushing him into the bathroom, even when John tried to insist a shower would be enough.
After what must've been at least ten minutes, Sherlock stopped his movement at John's lower stomach, instead of moving down his hips and to his thighs, the brunet abruptly wrapped his fingers around John's length, catching him off guard.
So the detective got up, washed and made tea. John had been very surprised the few first times when Sherlock shoved a warm cuppa on his hands when he got out of bathroom, but never complained. Now it was their usual routine, at least on the mornings when Sherlock didn’t get called to the yard.
“You know, I don’t mind that you find ballet erotic sometimes, just try to keep yourself in check at the studio.”
Now that his mind was rapidly focusing on the case, he had little time to fret over his fears or the niceties.
“No, wait. I don’t have a jumper like that,” John noted, looking at the dark brown jumper with white snowflake patterns on it.
When they were done, they quickly changed back into their usual clothes and headed to the next destination, which turned out to be the home of an Irish Setter breeder. The owner of the dogs greeted Sherlock like he knew him, which didn’t surprise John. The doctor watched in surprise though as Sherlock petted and played with the dogs, a huge smile on his face.
The next day Sherlock had woken up to find John was already in the shower. Apparently convinced John was leaving him ayways, the detective had been desperately trying to clean the flat with shaking hands as John had got out of the bathroom. The detective had kept on pleading and had promised to clean the whole apartment and rid all of his experiments if John just promised to stay.
Sherlock lifted his gaze and they both burst out in giggles. When the laughter died off, Sherlock sighed again and looked at John. “But, seriously… You think I should do it?” He asked softly. John could see that Sherlock was really interested in trying it out, and he nodded.
“But that’s – wait, what?” John asked, frowning at Sherlock.
“Also, I’m hungry.”
, John mused.
Trying to keep his steps even, John waved at the DI. "No, I know where he lives."
John grinned, nodding at Sherlock. “Well, yeah that’s actually good to know before you get the flat full of people. So who’ll be coming?”
Holy cannoli, over 16K words in one month?? I did that?? Wow
“I didn’t know, I saw. You are clearly a man with a military background, it’s in your posture and haircut. And you’re a doctor because of the smell of disinfectant that’s oozing off of your clothes. You still use it even though you only work part-time. You have quite fast reflexes, and you immediately checked me for possible injuries, probably subconsciously.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You haven’t even seen the table yet,” Sherlock scoffed, wearing a small satisfied smile. John followed him into the kitchen, stopping on the doorway when he saw the table. Even Sherlock’s microscope had been stored away, and the table was completely empty except for a white tablecloth and a woven Christmas table runner. John noticed that Sherlock had also cleaned the cupboards and the stove and put up a few tiny poinsettia wreaths and more dark green tinsel around the kitchen, making the room look very Christmassy without being too tacky.
“The bed,” John gasped in between kisses, sliding one hand to squeeze Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock nodded, biting John’s bottom lip gently before lifting him up and carried him the few short steps to the bed.
As promised, the next day was John’s day. He’d given Sherlock a list of things he wanted to show Sherlock, so it wouldn’t exactly be a surprise. But John liked the thought anyways, and he had nearly snickered at the look on Sherlock’s face when he’d first read through the list.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock shot him the 'we both know what going on here' look and scoffed while hanging his coat. "They had collected all the neglected paperwork from the last three months for me to deal with today. And the case was actually a three."
“How did you manage all this?” John asked when they pulled apart, walking to the table and sitting down slowly. “My bath only took fifteen minutes, maximum.”
It was nice to see that Sherlock had really complied him when John got back. He even got the detective to nap with him after that, and now they were laying on the bed. The silence was comfortable, and John didn't really feel like breaking it.
"Nicotine patches? You're wearing
When they’d both come down from the high, John cleaned them with a wet towel and then cuddled Sherlock on the bed. Sherlock wrapped himself around John like an octopus, kissing his neck contentedly.
“I love you,” Sherlock said, now looking at John with a sincere expression. “Like, a lot.”
Oh, he shouldn't have threatened Sherlock with the bar last time, the detective always added a little revenge when it was his turn to play. John tried to relieve the pressure on his groin by wiggling against the material of the chair, but Sherlock quickly tugged his hips up just enough so that he couldn't get the friction where he needed it. Damn him, always knowing just what to do.
Trying to get back to normal, John focused on sorting out his cutlery and pouring himself a glass of water from the pitcher that hadn’t been there earlier. What was going on?
Much, much later as they settled down for the night, John yawned and went to get his soft woolly socks from the drawer. Opening it, he froze and stared at the pile of socks. "How..."
“Thank you,” the dancer nodded, giving him a smile and then pulling him into a kiss, resting his hands on John’s hips. John smiled, sliding a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and kissing back. After a while, Sherlock deepened the kiss a little and rolled John onto his back. John sighed into the kiss and pulled Sherlock on top of him, their lips still sealed together. Sherlock responded enthusiastically, starting to give John a good groping before suddenly pulling back and staring at John.
This chapter is so short it's just sad, so I might add something to it later. But I wanted to get something posted for a change, especially because Nutcracker is a Christmas thing and
(See the end of the chapter for
At least until he got tackled for the first time.
"Okay. Do you wanna get a massage?"
John smiled and kissed his forehead before resting his chin on top his curly head. “I love you a lot too,” he said, stroking his back.
"Come on, the flat's not going to decorate itself."
Sherlock blushed a bit and huffed, stepping closer to kiss John’s cheek. “I’ll be in the dressing room,” he mumbled with a grin before walking off. John grinned to himself before remembering the fabrics and rushing off.
“I should make a list like that, just in case you didn’t know how much I love you,” he muttered, watching Sherlock with the widest, happiest smile. Sherlock just nodded and kissed John softly, mumbling something that sounded like “of course I know that” in between kisses.
“Git,” John chuckled fondly, starting to peel the vegetables and then frying them on the pan while the rice boiled. “How did I ever survive without you…” he mumbled, seasoning the vegetables with salt and soy sauce.
Luckily Sherlock just chuckled at him. "No, they don't. I'm a consulting detective, meaning that when the police are out of their depth - which is always - they consult me."
Sherlock just gripped a handful of John's shirt and tugged, almost rolling his head on the pillow already. "Please, John. Keep going."
Christmas day dawned, the air was brisk and there was a thin layer of snow covering the ground. Sherlock woke up before John and slid out of bed, brushing his teeth and heading to the kitchen to make tea. As he arranged the gingerbreads on a plate, he heard muffled footsteps and then strong arms hugged him from the behind.
Right when Sherlock’s class ended, the showers were still empty for his use. But soon after they’d be full of other dancers getting ready for their class, a shared group class for advanced dancers. They were mostly the same age as John and Sherlock, John noticed as he was waiting for Sherlock on the corridor.
Sherlock planned something special for Christmas Day as well.
He could always tell the difference between summer rain drop and other drops, he could smell the moment spring died and summer was born. Only then he would greet the world with a wide grin and run out for the first time in months.
"Yes, exactly!" Sherlock exclaimed gleefully.
goes with any ballet thing, right?
Again, a few pictures to go with the visual image :)
"You should unpack now, might need your help in a bit. There's just the bedroom upstairs, think you can find it just fine." With an almost dismissive wave of his hand, he resumed his work with the suitcase.
It was practically over after that. John gasped loudly and bucked up to Sherlock's hand as the detective took hold of John. The visual was too much for Sherlock and he came, arching up to John's hand now gently gripping him. It only took a few uncoordinated jerks of Sherlock's hand and John followed him with a moan.
Sherlock stared at him, still unbelieving.
John cut him off with a kiss, one elbow braced on the bed as he rested his other hand on the nape of Sherlock’s neck. “You’re an old romantic,” he chuckled, pressing their foreheads together. “You actually made and didn’t just buy one?”
“Why,” he said with a small voice, “why would you do that?”
John sighed and opened his eyes, turning to look at Sherlock. "Okay, what is it?" He asked, pursing his lips. "We still have almost a month to prepare for Christmas so if you're panicking about having forgotten it again I'm-"
“To get aroused. And I might even want to watch you get off,” he added with a smirk. John immediately felt how his blood shifted place. “You would? Isn’t that… I don’t know, selfish?”
Mycroft got over his insistent urge to leave and when the time for exchanging gifts came, he and Sherlock actually managed to do it with smiles on their faces. Lestrade seemed very happy at the sight, and he actually winked at John, who chuckled and nodded back, patting Sherlock’s back when he came to drop his gift under the tree along with the ones he got from Lestrade, Mrs Hudson and Molly.
He realised he had been just staring for a while. He snapped his eyes off the candle and the menu and took a quick glance at Sherlock who was looking almost confused.
"Ugh, I'm sore everywhere," John groaned the next day as he walked to the living room with a hot cup of coffee. "We should exercise more often, the running alone isn't clearly doing the trick," he muttered, nearly flopping down to his chair. He’d woken up with a sore bum, but by no, the stiffness had reached his upper back and thighs as well, making him look frankly ridiculous as he was mostly waddling around.
Finally, he stood up, took his toiletries and laptop and headed downstairs. By then Sherlock had shifted to lay on his back on the sofa and after finding the bathroom John ventured to the living room and sat down on the armchair he almost thought as his already. He placed his laptop on the small table next to the chair and looked at Sherlock. The man had rolled up the sleeve of his shirt on his right hand, and decorating his arm were...
“I gave him a week to think about it, he’d be a great addition to the cast,” Mrs Hudson said and John chuckled. “I’m sure he will be, thank you.”
John turned to look at him, grinning widely. “This is actually a very good surprise, thank you. You could consider doing this more often than just once every year though,” he teased, kissing Sherlock’s cheek.
A big number 8 greeted John on one side of the card, and the words ‘clean kitchen table’ on the other. “Oh, so you actually were planning on cleaning the table too,” John chuckled, looking at Sherlock with a big smile before continuing with a more serious tone: “Thank you, I really appreciate it.”
“Sherlock, you need to eat, before it goes cold. You can do that mind thing later.” Sherlock sat up and turned to scowl at John.
P.S. let me know if I fuck up some ballet-related term or something, I'm really not a professional at all.
John put the slippers on, feeling utterly ridiculous, and then walked closer to the wall, looking at Sherlock expectantly.
"I'm aware I may have forgotten you at the crime scene yesterday and I realise that might have been a bit... not good." Surprisingly, Sherlock seemed slightly nervous too, or maybe John was just reading his own nerves into Sherlock.
As he carried the lollipops, plywood furniture and fabrics to the stage before the practice started, he could see Sherlock goggling at him just like he would goggle at Sherlock during the practice, so he just grinned and lifted his current load a bit higher.
“Sherlock. It is what it is. Remember?”
"Now listen, I need you to know that today I am not angry with you, alright? You were just a lad, you did nothing wrong, and I know that you wanted to find him just as badly as his mother and I did." He was still holding his hand and put his other one on top of it. "Sherlock, it wasn't your problem, lad, so don't be upset with yourself. Alright?"
"Thanks, Mrs. H," John said with a hint of sarcasm.
John looked at him directly, the two pausing their stroll. “Sherlock, you don't need to fix anything right now. There will be time for that later. Right now you need to focus on getting through everything that just happened.”
Sherlock closed his eyes. "Bad."
"If anything, I should be the one apologizing to you," John continued.
"That's because I wanted you to like me."
But as John unlocked his flat door, take out bags in one hand, Sherlock felt like maybe he could get somewhere. Maybe not everything was so upside down after all. Maybe His John was finally back.
"Understandable," John replied. "So how about we go get Rosie, then? And you could pick up some clothes and things?"
After John dropped Rosie off at Mrs. Hudson's flat, he hurried to Bart's. While he was there he looked at how the rebuilding was going, saw how the walls were bare of color and wall paper, and felt oddlt like it was more than the flat being built anew. Like everything was different now, everything was finally back and settled. But he was left to wonder what exactly he felt had settled.
"Hey, hey, it's okay," John cooed as he brought his other hand up to hold Sherlock's face. "Listen, everything will go okay. He will get a lovely burial, everyone will pay their respects, and he'll be put to rest properly. In this situation, I'm afraid that's the best ending you can ask for."
John gently put his hand between Sherlock's shoulder blades, rubbing gently over the T-shirt he was wearing. "You could never disappoint me."
"You know that--"
"I suppose you're right," Sherlock admitted. "While I'm here I can help with her. If you'd like. With Rosie, I mean."
John knew what an apologetic Sherlock looked like. He made John coffee -- even though Sherlock thought it was drugged coffee, that's beside the point -- basically planned his wedding, and had offered his babysitting services. Either they were small things to help John, or they were grand gestures of an exploding train or a tear jerking best man's speech or sending a fake demon hound after him.
Sherlock approached the coffee pot after putting Rosie in her chair. John looked at him as he reached for a mug and smiled. "So, Sherlock, I've been meaning to ask you something."
“Hm?” Sherlock asked. “I don't think many places are open right now.”
That's all folks! Thanks for reading my first fic and I hope to write more
Sherlock was thankful that Donovan was trying to talk Lestrade out of keeping Sherlock on the crime scene so Sherlock didn't feel like he'd be embarrassing either one of them. "The same sleeping arrangement. As right now -- Not from London."
"It was pretty damn lovely to see you back at work, too," John added. "Not doubting yourself anymore, I hope."
"So...you do love her?" John asked.
“How is Rosie?” Sherlock asked before John could pose a topic starter of his own.
That's when it all came rushing at him. Days when they would run around the beach and play pirate, the day they met in school, when Sherlock would sneak Victor answers to tests and Victor would tell him about the solar system because he wanted to go to space someday, was willing to move to America to do it, and the boys had made a promise as all children do to follow eachother because they were best mates and the time they spent together was when they were most happy. Victor going to university with him, studying with him, becoming an engineer or something and moving to America, Sherlock still talikg with his parents like they were his own, knowing his children and being Uncle Sherlock or Uncle William. Victor deserved a life like that, a life of space and friendship and family, one that Sherlock could watch.
Sherlock swallowed and closed his eyes again. "Okay." John slipped his free hand to Sherlock's fidgeting ones, taking the right one and pushing his fingers between Sherlock's before squeezing their palms together and laying them on Sherlock's leg. Sherlock took a shaking breath, squeezing John's hand quickly.
"Oi, I chose you lot," John argued.
"That's bullshit, Sherlock, and you know it."
John shrugged. "Yeah, well, it seems like a bit of a waste. Having a car and using a cab instead."
“Oh, so he remembers again,” Mrs. Hudson joked. John gave her a good natured smile before he left the land lady to finally sleep.
John flicked on some lights, Sherlock looming behind him and analyzing the living room. It was the same as before, when John had invited him in once after he dropped off Rosie.
John sighed. “What are you thinking?”
When they did get home, Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and didn't let go. "Sweetheart, I'm not going anywhere," he said. "But I would like to change out of this suit."
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, but sat at the booth in front of the window without a word. John sat Rosie in the high chair once it was set, leaving his hands open to look at the menu. Sherlock didn't pick his up, just tracked the cars and cabs that drove by with his penetrating, icy gaze. He looked like he was from another dimension, sitting in the daylight with his white skin that contrasted greatly to his curls and the shadows being thrown by his bone structure.
Rosie yawned. "Oh, almost asleep, then? Pity. I'm going to be bored once you've dropped off. You are probably going to hear and read this story, but the first time I realized how amazing your father was happened the night we met. No, the night after because we technically met one day then saw the flat the next. Anyways, we were investigating, I sort of picked him up in a whirlwind and forgot him there. I wasn't used to having other people with me.
"What if I changed my mind?"
John grinned back. "I wouldn't mind it at all."
"Rosie," John replied.
Sherlock grinned and stood, taking his coat. "I sometimes play the violin when I think and won't speak for days."
Sherlock Holmes was at a loss for the second -- 'No, apparently third' -- time in his life. He didn't know how to proceed without making matters worse. The first time was with Redbeard.
"Sherlock, I didn't mean to scare you. I know now that you have many, many feelings to sort out right now and that I shouldn't have messed with it, but you were right. I was suggesting us being together."
"As in you haven't or you don't want to talk about it."
John had called him. He was holding Rosie in one arm, a white envelope in the other. Sherlock's throat went dry as John handed it to him. "Pop this in while I put her down, okay?"
John had woken up early, a habit that he had given up breaking, to see Sherlock sleeping soundly on the opposite side of the bed. He was glad the consulting detective was still asleep, it gave him time to think. Regroup. To plan a way to start making it up to him. First was breakfast, one that John was going to make him eat like always.
It had been the realisation of that morning. John thought that Sherlock didn't date because John was so adamant that he wasn't gay, fought it tooth and nail at times. He, rather stupidly, hadn't realized that "Women aren't really my area" meant that he didn't like women.
"I love you."
“Dinner?” John asked.
John decided to think of something reassuring to say, something that would break him out of his thoughts. “You are a good man, you know. I might've been slow to catch on and prone to forget it when I was in a fit, but you are a good man.”
Sherlock stood in the center of the mess, his eyes roaming over the mounds of broken furniture covered in plaster dust, analyzing and documenting everything that was or wasn't there.
"Yes." Sherlock's voice cracked and he swallowed again because John was also hurting, he should be the one comforting John instead of the other way around and he was already failing miserably.
When Sherlock was in bed, his back to John, he tried to force himself to sleep.
"My point is that I'm not the man you loved before I died so why would you care!" As Sherlock shouted, he had turned back around with waving arms and accidentally knocked one of the mugs over, causing it to roll off the counter and break."
"I know that you don't blame me, John, but it's a bit hard to believe that after you split my brow open." It had slipped out. Sherlock meant to think it, not to say it, and he felt like a complete imbecile when he saw the look on John's face. It looked like he had been the one that was hit.
"Yes?"
John could tell Sherlock wanted him back by the way he sounded on the baby monitor. Like he was dejected, had given up the fight of keeping his best friend around and in good spirits. Whenever he thought about it, a now familiar pang of guilt would surface in his gut and he would promise to himself that he would never have Sherlock sounding or feeling that way again.
Sherlock huffed, but it turned into more of a short laugh. "No, they're not close to me, they don't count."
Sherlock crossed his arms. "Of course not."
"Sherlock... I didn't..."
John was silent and Sherlock was scared that he had done it again. John Watson was once again Captain Watson and he had ruined everything again and now he was going to be kicked out and ignored and alone again.
"Sherlock, that's not your fault. It's really no one's fault. She took advantage of the situation, she played us, and there was no way you could've stopped it."
Sherlock's POV, basically just him screaming into the void, while our boys finally start feeling better
"Good night, John," Sherlock replied as he hoped his heart wouldn't beat out of his chest
Sherlock decided that John deserved sleep and hurried upstairs. It was also partly because he wasn't sleeping any and the small child would make him feel better.
"You just hate me going back to her."
John smiled at him brightly. "Good. And if you forget, I'll be happy to remind you."
There was more silence as their footsteps and those of passers by echoed off of walls. Until John broke it, as he felt he always had to. "Sherlock, can you tell me about... Well, since you are gay, I was wondering..."
"Oh God," Sherlock complained reflexively.
"What if I ever start using again?" Sherlock whispered, his back tensing.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say anything, I'm sorry."
Rosie was sitting up in her crib, abandoning her wails for chewing on her first as she saw Sherlock come in.
"She's beautiful, congratulations to the both of you, take a seat anywhere you like while I get a high chair."
"What? What did I say?"
"You seem happy today," Sherlock said as he looked back at the microscope.
"That's not the point!"
"Not particularly now, but generally, yes."
"Hm," he hummed to at least acknowledge that John was still speaking.
John's breath caught and he couldn't do anythinf but stare. Then the questions came. Did Janine lie about all of that in the papers? Did Sherlock want a boyfriend? Had he ever had one? Did he ever want John to be his boyfriend?
"Surprisingly not okay," John replied, "but he's hanging in there, I think. Feels awful about it all."
"If you didn't like it just say so and I won't do it again," Sherlock said too quickly, like he was trying to snap at John but he was scared that it was true and he was disappointed about it.
The second time was when John Hamish Watson had wanted him to write a speech. A speech that was perfect, Sherlock had to make perfect for him because to him John was perfect and he needed to make John happy after everything he had done to him. But he couldn't betray his own feelings, couldn't let on how much he really felt for his flatmate. Sherlock realized later that he did so anyways, but John appeared to not have noticed.
"Then what is the point, John?" Sherlock turned and looked at him accusingly. "What exactly is the point of this whole conversation if not to state the obvious?"
Sherlock stepped more into the kitchen, looking a little anxious. "I'm fine." But John shot him a look and Sherlock shuffled to the opposite side of the table. As Sherlock proceeded to eat everything off of the plate, John ate his own food in silence.
"And now all that's left is to get the flat fixed up and move back in," John said.
Then Rosie was crying. Sherlock had taken the time to memorize exactly what each of Rosie's cries were while he would baby sit occasionally. The hungry one was high pitched, almost a shriek, repetitive and fast like an alarm clock. The nappy change had a slight hiccup to the end and was less repetative. This one in particular was like a siren, the one where she just wanted someone to hold her as her cries rang out slowly, alerting to her distress.
John reluctantly went upstairs. After her cries were identified as hungry, John carried her down stairs to use the microwave and get to the formula. Sherlock was sitting on the couch, one steaming mug of tea set off to the side on the coffee table. "I'll only be a moment," John reassured him.
Okay so not much angst, I figured I'd throw in the heavy stuff later
"Because I loved you, dammit, and I couldn't let myself be happy before I lost you and then you just showed up again out of the blue like everything was supposes to go back to normal, like I was some play thing."
Sherlock looked down. There was too much to say, he decided. There were too many emotions for him to protray, to discuss, to feel, to explain. It was even harder to identify their causes, especially without revealing particular emotions that he was still trying to deny in the most feeble way possible.
"Sherlock! It's been a while, my friend, I haven't seen you in too long! Take a seat, you and-- Oh God, who is this?" Angelo had directed his attention to the newest Watson.
"Back to normal. Well, better than normal, I hope."
Sherlock nodded. "I'm still going to apologize to Molly."
"We can paint it, make it a nice little nursery," John suggested. Sherlock nodded. "The theme could be bees."
“Good, that's good, John,” Sherlock answered. He was looking down at the ground.
There was a longer pause now and Sherlock was scared that he had said the wrong thing. "Then good night, Sherlock," John said happily.
Sherlock looked down to see her eyes closed, lashes grazing chubby cheeks. Sherlock was scared that if he sat up and tried to put her down, she would wake and he would have to start again. But when he slowly stood she didn't stir, not even when he put her down and impulsively kissed her forehead. "Alright, then, good night. Sweet dreams, little bee."
When Sherlock had gone into the morgue, Molly was there carrying a clipboard. She looked up and her face fell and Sherlock felt his heart clench.
John was at the stove, avoiding eggs and milk that was on the body parts side of the fridge as took them out and scrambled them in a bowl. Rosie and Sherlock appeared, what he mentally called his curly haired loves, and grinned at the two of them because they were in an intense conversation.
The Baker Street boys. Basically just kinda fluffy to connect dots to the end of the Final Problem.
Sherlock shook his head. With the combination of the two Watson's, Sherlock knew that he could at least attempt to make it through the ceremony. If he didn't have the infant squirming in his arms, he wouldn't know what else to do with them.
"Do you want coffee?" John asked. Sherlock usually took his as soon as he woke up.
John briefly dared to think about offering to share his bed with Sherlock, but stamped the notion out quickly. “Alright, if you say so.”
Instead, Sherlock swallowed, his adam's apple bobbing on his long throat. "I will try to remember that, John."
Sherlock's bright eyes blinked at him, his face a sort of shocked happiness. John smiled at him, putting his hand over his cheek.
"Here," John said as he came and undid the tie and top button on Sherlock's suit. "I know you don't like ties because you say they suffocate you. It might help."
“Good idea, that man would attempt to put that flat back together himself if he was left alone with it.”
Sherlock winked and John felt his heart nearly fall to the floor. "Then come on, John. The game is on."
The air was fresher outside, his lungs not so crushed. He took a deep breath and blew it out and John moved his arm around his waist.
John looked dashing in a suit. He did before, on his wedding, but with longer hair it made Sherlock's stomach do flips. But that particular morning he wasn't feeling up to saying anything in particular about it.
Sherlock looked down at his shoes then quickly back at John. "You're not gay," Sherlock said.
Sherlock smiled back, some of the weight of his concern lifting and leaving him feeling a little freer. "Good."
Molly looked to the floor. "What, have you come to rub it in? Make some deduction about me?"
Then on his way to Bart's he had the sudden realisation that he hadn't talked to Sherlock about moving back in. He wanted to, more than anything, but he decided to bring it up to Sherlock later because John doubted he would just assume things like that.
"Stop staring," Sherlock told John without looking towards him.
Sherlock swallowed and looked down. “Because now is not about being brilliant or showing off, it's about fixing everything that I've done,” he snapped. “These past few months have all been about fixing it.”
The last chapter is coming up next, time to solve their final problem
"Even when we're old and retired and there aren't cases anymore? Even when I start keeping body parts in the kitchen?"
"Who?"
After Victor disappeared, his parents had moved to London to get away from the grief. His mother was buried in the city and Victor was to be buried right next to her. Sherlock expected that his father had plans to join them someday.
And that was the first time that Sherlock let himself believe it.
Hands cupped John's face and tore it away from cooking, kissing his face and decidedly causing the burning of the eggs.
"And I'm especially sorry that I can't feel the same way about you. I... I can't, you see, it's not who I am and--"
“Sorry about that, everything had been a bit…” John hesitated to try for a proper adjective. “More than we were used to.”
"So maybe I did, it doesn't mean I can't pretend that I didn't."
"Oh, my poor boy, today has been awful for you," she whispered. "We can take her to see her grandparents, spoil her a bit, how does that sound?"
"Was that okay?" John asked.
"Have you ever been interested in me? Like that?"
In response, Sherlock jumped to his feet. "I figured it out."
"What details?" John asked.
The man looked up at Sherlock with bright eyes, trying to match Sherlock's face to a person before it finally clicked. "Little William, is it?" he asked.
Sherlock looked back at John, his mouth hanging open for a moment. "You want to come back?"
"Yes," Sherlock answered with a shaking breath and a nod.
"Yes, you're right, I do like the bunnies on your pajamas, your father occasionally has good taste," Sherlock explained.
Sherlock shrugged.
"I go by Sherlock now, but yes," Sherlock replied.
"You alright?" he asked.
Rosie started reaching for her crib. Sherlock stood to put her back in, but her face scrunched into a pre-wail and he picked her up again. She grabbed her blanket as she was lifted and once settled back into the chair she held it close to her and drooled on it.
His face had more color in it, but the rest of him was still pale enough to almost blend into the sheets as the white rays of sunshine danced across his sleeping form. John felt like he could write poetry about his beauty, compose songs about it, like he was ethereal enough to be the muse of a painting. Sherlock was shirtless, which meant that the now faint marks on his shoulders and his back were noticeable. He had been shy about them, the first time, but John was happy he felt free enough not to cover up.
