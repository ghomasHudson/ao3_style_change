Why should she? The alpha/omega services were never wrong. They only matched true mates together and it was known to bring them great joy. True mates were extremely compatible. They always fell madly in love with each other. Most fell in love at first sight. There were only a few cases where one party was unhappily mated to their true mate. Cases like Sherlock's, where their alpha had married someone else before mating their true mate.
Sherlock’s gun aimed at Moriarty, eyes blazing. Moriarty smiled widely, raised his hands in a show of surrender and spoke promptly, “
John’s hands hovered above him, awkward, shy as Sherlock’s fingers hooked over pants and sweats, slowly tugging them down. John cooperatively raised his hips and legs, allowing Sherlock to effortlessly slip them off and tossed the clothes in a clump somewhere by the foot of the bed.
“Sherlock has arrived.” Mycroft said, a dissatisfied grimace upon his face, and John wondered if Sherlock was being resistant as he’d been the night before.
The flare of arousal awakened surprised John. He hadn’t felt like this since he’d been a teenager suffering from embarrassing wet dreams. With Sherlock, John felt like some depraved horny teenager trying to function.
"I'm rather eager to see the cake you've picked out, not to mention it'd be nice to have something sweet. I do have a rather sweet tooth." John confessed.
“Oh…” John whispered hoarsely, glancing down to the ground, bashful. “I didn’t… I was just… We don’t have to do that if you don’t—”
John did as instructed. Axel rounded slowly and began the path back to the farmhouse. Sherlock, still walking at his side, raised a hand and patted John’s knee. John met Sherlock’s stare, his heart jumped when a kind smile greeted him. For some bizarre reason, John returned it with one of his own.
Staring warily at John’s body, Mrs. Holmes nervously said, “I know you’re still healing, but would it cause you pain if I hugged you?”
"This... It was rather helpful, do you mind... If I... proceed with this habit throughout this stage of pregnancy for however long it will last?" Sherlock couldn't stop himself from asking, but it really didn't matter what John said, because his hormones would beat out any sense of logic and he knew it'd be futile for him to hold himself back from doing such.
A piercing whimper broke through the silence, followed by dishes breaking across the tiled floors of the kitchen. John's eyes snapped open and set their sights on Sherlock as the quaking omega crumpled to the floor, surrounded in the mess of broken appliances and dishes.
Sherlock had been happy with his life before he’d presented… But truth be told — a part of him, his omega part — had always felt insecure about his looks, about his inability to fit the socially acceptable framework of what an omega was to be. There was a time in his childhood, when Sherlock had, shamefully, looked to be accepted by his peers. He tried fitting in. He couldn’t change how tall he was, but he had tried eating more, hoping to gain some well sought after pounds, but damn his biology—he had a high metabolism and burned off the fat soon after consumption.
“Why can’t you answer me? I’m asking about our pups, Sherlock. Our children… They’re okay, aren’t they?” John was tired, his body feeling weak, but John forced himself to sit upright, bit back the cry of pain from his abdomen and reached for Sherlock. His fingers barely brushing against a jutting cheekbone, but it worked. Sherlock’s eyes slowly rose to John’s desperate stare.
“Mrs. Hudson will keep watch over you, okay? She has my number and if you really need me, I’ll come back.”
It always seemed like there would forever be more. More criminals, more lies, more pain. Sherlock began talking with Mycroft as the agents ushered out Mary. All while Mary pled with John to understand, to know that she was trying to finish it.
John needed to find a way to break through Sherlock's mess of a mind and reach his inner omega. Heal his omega and pray that it was enough. John couldn't do this on his own. Sherlock needed more help than he could provide and so he'd gone to the facility that had housed Sherlock. He spoke with the omega's doctors and what he received was little to no help. They couldn't have done more than what they had already done in regards to his mate's tattered mind. They had mostly cared for his depleting health, but otherwise there was nothing they could really do. The doctors stressed the importance of John's presence - John needed to do all he could to reach Sherlock and calm the broken omega within. It was all vague and nothing John could really derive an answer from.
” Sherlock cried out, his body jerking with surprise the moment John dove forward and took Sherlock’s bollocks in his mouth and sucked them reverently.
"Shhh. It's enough. Thank you." John comforted and Sherlock laughed, delighted when John sprinkled insistent kisses all about his face.
“I’m glad to see you’ve agreed. Mummy will be in touch.” Mycroft called as he shut the door behind him on his way out.
." John rasped, planting a chaste kiss to his lips before licking away a bit of his own release that managed to slip past Sherlock's lips and stained his chin. Sherlock hummed pleasantly at the action and rolled onto his side, facing John.
John didn’t feel happy most times, but this was one of the few times John was truly happy. Ever since their trip two weeks ago, John had been sleeping with Sherlock in the alpha’s room. It was starting to feel like their room once more and John was sure Sherlock cared more for him each passing day.
Sherlock started touching John while he was naked. A brief palming of his cheek, a kind word, and a kiss, sitting himself beside John on the couch when he was watching the television and wrapped an arm around him, pressing up against John’s back and wrapping him up in his arms while John cooked, so that John could feel the hardness of Sherlock pressing against his ass.
“I play the violin when I’m thinking, and sometimes I don’t talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential bond mates should know the worst about each other.”
"Sherlock!" John cried out with worry and rushed to his omega. Before he could lay a hand on Sherlock, the omega raised another hand up to bid John not touch him.
"What... are you saying?" John's voice didn't sound like it normally did, it trembled and wavered on a heavy exhale.
“Mother, why don’t we give them some privacy? I doubt Sherlock feels like he can be himself with us here.” Mycroft offered, attempting to pacify the situation.
The horse leaned close to the bars of the stable and John desperately wanted to touch the beauty. Staring up into the horse’s honey brown eyes, John lifted a hand out slowly, allowing the horse to take notice of his presence and his intention, before he laid his hand with all the gentleness on the horse’s side.
"I... I can't do it anymore. He's broken me. Mycroft. I need... I need to get away. I can't take it. He's always there. Whatever I do, go, look-
Scanning John's features carefully, Sherlock surmised it was the latter. Eyes twinkling darkly, Sherlock slid his hand up from John's chin to grasp tightly to soft blond hair and jerked his head at a strained angle.
"Right. So you see, this is all rather understandable." Sherlock unfolded his arms and dug a hand under the comforter, blindly searching for his clothes.
John looked up at Sherlock in wonder. Sherlock really thought about everything. John’s omega whined within,
“Sherlock, please… Just… just calm down and sit. Talk to me, don’t do this. Please.” John was distressed, coming to understand fully what Sherlock intended to do then and trembled against his chair in utter fear, unable to say the words that drummed a mantra within his mind. The same words he knew would stop Sherlock from doing what he intended to.
"I wanted to right myself to be right for you, but I was wrong. I can't right myself when I don't have you by my side. You make me right Sherlock. You. I can't... I can't be without you. I shouldn't have left. I was a fool for thinking that it was what we needed. I don't know shit about relationships. I don't know how to make this right on my own."
“I can’t live without our pups!” John swore, because this heartbreak was killing him from the inside out, his heart literally felt as if it would destroy itself.
“Ah, Anderson.” Sherlock greeted, friendly enough, though the coldness in his eyes demonstrated to John that Anderson was no friend.
Sherlock was an alpha, and no matter how young he was, it was well known that if an alpha met their omega, they would give into their primal instincts and attempt to claim their mate before their omega reached full adulthood. If this were to occur it would damage their omegas fertility. Therefore, Sherlock’s parents had forbidden him from meeting his intended until his omega peaked.
smelled sweet. Finding a submissive alpha was virtually impossible, they were extremely rare. His requirements would be hard to match and the likelihood that such an alpha existed and that they were still unbound at such an age was slim to none.
Sherlock wanted out. That's all he wanted. He wanted away from John and his pleading eyes. He wanted away from his reassuring words that it was him who he cared for. He wanted out, because he knew no matter how nice John's words were, he was still going to see Mary and there was nothing Sherlock could do about that. John would be in the presence of the woman who stole what should have been
John would hear Sherlock and that beta giggling within the alpha’s room, scent their love making and feel an overwhelming urge to retch.
Sherlock snarled; the last attempt he’d taken on the government official’s life landed him locked up in a high tech facility, where he remained until his alpha side calmed and the feral need for bloodlust was doused.
.” Sherlock simmered, slipping on his way out of the fountain and John rose to his feet, taking several steps back, preparing himself for his punishment that was sure to come.
John paled. This was it. Sherlock had finally learned the truth of their marriage. He wasn't sure how, but it was only a matter of time before Sherlock had deduced the truth. John had been so careful, but still he was unable to hide this painful truth of their marriage from his mate.
As he stood within the lavishly decorated living room of his family’s estate, standing before his seated parents and a reclining, smugly grinning Mycroft, Sherlock smirked at the lot of them.
There was a dull shuffle and in the next moment the door swung open to reveal a curious Sherlock. The man’s deep red robe unclasped, open to reveal he was wearing a plain white t-shirt and silver blue striped sleeping slacks. John knew it wasn’t much, but to John… Sherlock was breathtaking. Sherlock could open the door wearing a trash bag and to John, Sherlock would be the most beautiful person out there. Sherlock was John’s everything.
“I never married anyone!” Sherlock snarled, electric blue clashing with John’s murky blue as they flew open.
“Yeah, I'm fine. Sherlock— Sherlock!” John pled, as Sherlock finished removing the explosives and slid them across the room.
John pressed himself down hard, weighing his rear against the hardness under him. Unintentional, it might have been, but regardless of his intentions he'd touched Sherlock's sensitive cock and sent the omega trembling with need.
"Well," Clare began, stifling her giggles and looking to her Harry who was just as pleased by the sight of two very in love men. "Tell us, is there going to be a wedding?"
With such few words exchanged, Mycroft ended the call with a sense of sureness that all would be as he wanted. The government official stepped out of the hospital room. As he walked the hall, he imagined every ghastly thing Sherlock would want to do to him when he discovered what actions the older Holmes had taken. However, this was what needed to be done. He could handle Sherlock.
"What looks different?" John was trying to understand, to follow Sherlock's words, but was unable to determine what Sherlock was referring to.
on suppressants then stopping. John had missed forty-eight consecutive heat cycles. The gynecologist assured him his fertility was still intact and timed his next heat cycle to begin in two months. However, John was worried about what would happen at that time.
“You don’t feel like yourself because of me?” John repeated slowly, the spark of hope grew when Sherlock gave a stiff nod of concurrence.
John felt sick. He couldn’t get rid of Irene, because of Sherlock. He couldn’t fight for Sherlock, because it wasn’t fair to bind his husband in a fruitless union. But John couldn’t just sit here and watch Irene flirt with Sherlock. So John rose to his feet, met Irene’s curious stare with one of conflicted dissatisfaction and walked out of the flat.
“I’ve been riding since I was ten. I know what I’m doing John. Don’t be frightened.” Sherlock reassured.
." Sherlock's hands slid up as his head lowered further, and nails dug into his scalp as he fisted his hair.
sweet—an omega then. Why would a bound omega be living with another alpha? The bond mark on John’s neck, the way he smelled completely of you and you him, then today I notice the matching wedding rings on both of your fingers, which meant that you are John’s bond mate. Not to mention that you’re a Holmes and an heir to a massive inheritance. Come on Sherlock, did you really think you could hide this? Love surely has muddled your brilliant mind.” Lestrade chuckled out the last bit lightheartedly.
“Oh, John.” Harry cooed, moving closer and hugging John from his side, pressing her forehead against his shoulder as silent comfort.
It had been over a week since the night Sherlock posted their video. It only took a week before word reached them. First, it had been the looks. Occasionally they were spotted and given smiles from people who recognized them from their work. These looks were different - they weren't of the excitement at having gotten a glimpse of
John didn't release him right away. His hands stroked at his back and upper arms, before Sherlock's pulled away slightly, enough so John could look up at him with that ridiculous look. That look that said he needed him. Wanted Sherlock's care as if he deserved it. John deserved to be slapped, but Sherlock held off on that desire, because what he had planned was far worse.
“Urgh!” John groaned mortified as he recalled feeling so relaxed, warm and cared for and how his eyes became heavy and then he’d shut them in the starting of sleep.
, I promised to meet Lestrade this morning.” Sherlock voiced brokenly, closing his eyes and moaning blissfully when John began unclasping his belt.
“Sherlock.” John inhaled when the alpha raised his hips up, jostling him, and his fists clamped, gripping at feather-light hair.
"Really, now you want to bother me?" Sherlock sighed dramatically, and palmed his stomach and rubbed at it gently.
Sherlock felt the press at his womb. Not hard, a soft nudge at it and fuck. Sherlock's belly gave a roll and the omega whimpered, the babies were moving and John kept coming. Lighting fire between his legs. His cock was fluttering, straddling the line of full on bliss. His entrance quivered around the girth of John's cock laying waste to his sensitized hole.
“A suspect wasn’t happy to be found out, tried to kill me. Really, the same old, then I incapacitated him and called Scotland Yard.” Sherlock drawled dryly, glaring at John’s hands that lay care to his arm.
"Stop what, Sherlock?" John asked as if he hadn't just been committing adultery when he was, because it was
Sherlock stared up at him, blinking back the tears and John was struggling himself, talking about this with the man who'd mended and broke his heart time and time again.
“Yes. No. I mean, I need to leave for a while for a case. I’m sorry, John.” Sherlock said the last as his eyes softened.
Sherlock had interrupted John as he was seated in the library reading an actually interesting book, grabbed him by the sleeve of his shirt and began tugging and pulling until John rose and began following Sherlock to some unexplored area of the north wing.
Now it was he who would ruin John in return. It was about time John felt near the brink of a meltdown, felt the hollowness where his heart should be, felt just as powerless and alone as Sherlock.
Bowing his head, John covered his eyes with his hand and strangled out breathless sobs, choking back the whimpers while screaming at himself to stop the tears before he really lost himself to grief.
“Why?” Sherlock’s resolutely monotone voice gave way to sentiment at last and John could hear the bewilderment and panic in his voice.
Sherlock paled. His mother found him…his alpha submissive? That didn’t make sense! There wasn’t supposed to be one out there for him! No…
“John… Even… Even if I left… Even if we didn’t see each other… Even if you leave my life forever… I’d never,
“No!” Sherlock squawked, gaining several stares from people seated near them and flushed with embarrassment.
A shrill whimper broke from John as Sherlock’s petal finger stroked him on one hundred and twenty. He came, spurting hot white seed all over them both. John sobbed from the devastatingly powerful orgasm that coursed through him. Soft, supple lips collided with his own and John’s mouth opened on a keen, growing all the more needing and pitiful when Sherlock’s heated tongue glided through and ensnared his in an ardent kiss. John panting shakily through it, his little mewls of need drowning in Sherlock’s mouth. Seeking comfort, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock and brought him close to his chest. Embracing his mate full of love, John broke their kiss to press his nose in Sherlock’s hair and whined helplessly, his vicious grip had yet to abate.
Sherlock felt heat rise to his face, his body trembling, fingers twitching, nails lengthening into threatening claws with the intent to mutilate the alpha in front of him.
John glanced over to Victor, who was smiling wildly, and then back to Sherlock. He wouldn’t fall for Sherlock’s trap, he didn’t reject another’s affections cruelly — not like Sherlock — and he wasn’t going to now. Whether he acknowledged Sherlock in his wish to refuse or he refused Victor kindly, it wasn’t going to happen with Sherlock present, because he’d just spew snide remarks at Victor and be overly cruel. John knew what it was like to be on the brunt end of Sherlock’s cruelty and he wouldn’t give Sherlock the opportunity to do the same to someone else.
"I'll be in touch." Sherlock called, and rushed out of the building, past the stares and whispers of officers filling the home.
“I don’t want to talk. I asked you not to consent and you… because of you, we’ve lost everything.” John’s voice broke on that realization.
"I... I... mm - I love you." John eyes stung, and dampness broke free when he clamped his eyes shut. Something within gave way to bleeding, his veins pulsed, rushing with pain. It was so difficult to say, and yet at the same time it filled John with warmth. How confusing it was. Confessing ones love hurt, and yet it was heartening.
Sherlock promised to keep John and Mary safe, and he had, for a time. All those who'd wished to harm them, he'd done away with. Mary had her baby girl with no complications. John was full of joy. In fact, he was the happiest Sherlock had seen him since he'd faked his death.
God, John loved Sherlock’s deducing abilities, but right now he didn’t much want to listen to Sherlock tell him what he knew already and unabashedly curled himself against Sherlock’s prone form. Wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders, John palmed the back of Sherlock’s head with one hand, curling his fingers in the feather-like curls of his alpha and gripping it tight, while pressing his lower half against Sherlock’s sheeted body.
Sherlock looked away from the dead body to flash a withering glare at the sniveling excuse for a man. How that man had been born an alpha was a mystery.
“Don’t lie to me John.” Sherlock glared, although John didn’t want to argue, he could see that Sherlock would not back down this time, not until he got a sufficient answer, an answer John would not give.
It must be sleep deprivation that was making John so bold in his expressions. Hell, since he’d already started, why not continue?
John laughed bitterly, "I don't give a fuck what he said, he knows nothing- That daft genius. Where is he?"
Sherlock shouldn't be angry. He really shouldn't. There was no need to be, but still... He was. John was late coming home. He said he would be, but not this late. Sherlock wasn't waiting for him. He merely expected him to come home by 8:40PM. He said he would, but he hadn't.
They’d head home after solving a case, or to further contemplate a case, and John would reluctantly leave Sherlock to stay up focusing on the case while John went to bed alone. He usually had to wake early for work the next day and he knew he couldn’t skip resting in his condition. Sometimes he’d wake to Sherlock still working on the case and other times Sherlock would be gone. When he was there, John would wish him luck and asked him not to do anything crazy while he was at work. Sherlock would smile and promise to be on his best behavior before bidding him a good day.
Sherlock pulled away enough to press John by the shoulders until he lay on his back. John opened his eyes and stared up in the darkness of the room. The city lights from outside their window providing enough illumination to make out the faint traces of Sherlock’s fond smile.
“There is a spare room in my flat, it will be yours. I want separate rooms and somewhat separate lives. I also refuse to stop taking suppressants. I don’t want… That part of a marriage. We will marry and I’ll accept the claim bite, but I will not accept intimacy of any kind. A friendship of sorts is the only thing I will be open to. If you still wish to pursue this marriage, so be it. But if you can’t agree to these terms, refuse me now.” Sherlock spoke so quickly, it took John a moment to fully register what he’d said.
Even now it hurt to hear that voice. It made him want to curl up in a ball and scent the alpha, reaffirming that Sherlock was alive and well. But he'd never let his omega out to do such, not with Sherlock, and certainly not after all the lies.
Alphas, although prone to being aggressive, brutish, and cruel, if they truly loved someone, they could be most affectionate and doting to their loved ones. Sherlock didn’t love John, didn’t even know him, so why was he pretending to be kind? John wouldn’t believe him. John would not trust the man. Sherlock was an alpha. Alphas were vicious, cruel, and aggressive, Sherlock was the same, but he hid it well.
Mycroft sighed heavily and moved to seat himself next to Sherlock. They both stared at the wall across from them in silence.
John’s omega wailed ruefully for Sherlock, clawing its way to the surface. John couldn’t hold in the pain of loneliness as it swept through him, tears overflowed and cascaded down his flushed cheeks. Clamping his eyes shut, John kicked off his shoes and took hold of the hem of his shirt. He lifted it up high over his head, removing it and let it fall to the ground before working on the drawstrings of his sweatpants. Unknotting the tie, John leaned back into the bed, hooked his thumbs through his sweats and pants and shoved off the drenched clothing, leaving him bare.
“They’re hurting him at his school.” Sherlock stressed quietly, balling his hands into tight fists wondering why the hell he cared so much.
The two of them laughed together, John's laughter less restrained than Sherlock's, but equally sincere.
"A year ago, my mother died. I wasn't ready for you then. I was dealing with my grief and caring for my father. I recently spoke with Mary about finding you. Our marriage... It's only ever been a deep friendship for me. Although she was hurt by my wish to seek you out, she understood why we married, and accepted my choice."
"I hate you." Sherlock snarled and shut his eyes tightly, wishing he remained deaf to the way his voice shook and gave way to the hurt that shredded at his heart knowing John had been with his beta earlier.
When he entered the flat, he released a sigh of relief, having finally made it home and away from the confused, judgmental, and stunned looks of strangers. A chair scraping against the floor had John’s eyes snapping back open and barely catching the sight of his husband’s back as the tall alpha strode out of the kitchen and down the hall to his room where a door shut loudly, but not hard enough to be considered a slam.
“Cleared off before we got here, but a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose. One of them could have been following him but…got nothing to go on.”
"I don't care what the bloody doctors said! I don't want him. I don't need him. He chose a life without me. I waited twenty years for him and he couldn't even stand up to his dear old sick mother to be with me! I lived so many years without him. He can learn to live without me."
Sherlock rocked into John, fully entered and then slowly drew back, then slid gently in again and it was more than wonderful. Sherlock languidly glided along the magnificent place within, sending zinging waves of ecstasy to augment. There was pleasure, a slow burning that grew, that strengthened and consumed. Their breathing intensified with the feelings coursing through them, the strengthening of their bond. John’s omega needed and he willingly gave, letting it out and the warmth in his chest pulsed and John knew then that Sherlock could feel his omega’s call through the bond. Sherlock growled; his alpha’s possessiveness came to the forefront as Sherlock nipped and his fangs pinched at his lips, but never did they cut him. Sherlock’s alpha was too caring to hurt John and his omega keened, his plea filled the room.
John licked his lips subconsciously and noticed how intensely Sherlock followed the movement with his eyes. The air around them thickened and John shut his eyes at the realization that Sherlock’s alpha pheromones were being released. John wasn’t even sure if Sherlock noticed he was doing it. Sometimes an alpha felt the need to soothe their partner and they’d release their pheromones as a way to calm them. John didn’t really need any soothing, yet still the pheromones relaxed him of any tension that may have existed and he swayed into it. Nevertheless, it was distracting and invoked a swarm of unneeded confusing feelings.
John stood silently watching as Sherlock accepted it, slipped it on, and paused when the slender alpha took hold of his hand again. Sherlock didn’t look at him, but even in the darkness of night, with the light of the full moon, John could see the flush blossoming on the silent man’s pale face.
Sherlock moved to seat himself across from John and observed the alpha eat his meal. Sherlock felt that same unsettling pull in his chest when he realized John refused to meet his gaze. He didn’t like it. Was John angry with him?
"Oh, yes, John. I will break you." Sherlock moved quickly to stand before the alpha and lowered himself to kneel in front of John. Raising out his hands, Sherlock cupped John's face with both hands and leaned forward until their faces were inches from one another.
Sherlock watched John as he entered their home, having arrived from work. One hour later than he had been three months before. Which meant he'd seen Victor.
Inhaling a trembling breath, John cautiously raised his head up and was met by kind cerulean eyes staring back at him. The heat of John’s face worsened still when a grin curved the pale pink lips of Sherlock’s.
“You smell strange, like acidic medicine. Suppressants I assume.” Sherlock concluded and John winced at the confirmation that Sherlock had truly erased their love from his memory.
, if they were alone, Sherlock might just yank him into his arms and hold tight, never wanting to let go, but then again, John might not like that.
“John Hamish Watson, do you commit yourself to William Sherlock Scott Holmes, to love, honor, respect each other, to communicate with each other, to look to your own emotional health so that you can relate in a healthy way, and provide a healthy home for children if you choose to have them; to be a support and comfort for your partner in times of sickness and health, as long as love shall last?”
Sherlock paused, maybe he should have come right out and said it. Of course John would think it was about the pups and the omega quickly made to reassure his husband that their pups were safe.
"Where have you been?" Sherlock demanded, snapping angrily at the alpha the moment he realized he'd come back.
"Thank you for joining me today." John said after they'd spent many long moments seated enjoying the warmth of the sun.
John's eyes turned analytical. Attempting to read Sherlock's actions and features, but finding no answer he voiced his question, "Sherlock?"
“Broad daylight?” Sherlock thought aloud with fascination, already striding to the door, a skip to his step.
“It’s done. I don’t regret it. I’d do anything to be with you.” Sherlock declared, pulling away and raising John’s head up so that he could meet his gaze.
Sherlock schooled his features in what he determined was a look of utter want and tenderly caressed John's ass.
“Mmm. Sherlock.” John hummed, nuzzling up the underside of an elegant chin, a submissive act, but insistent. John wanted more time to scent his newly claimed mate. More time to allow their scents to mingle, though it was no longer needed, John could already scent the change.
Running a hand through his hair, John glanced from the screen of his laptop and over to Sherlock who was seated at the kitchen table, cultivating some human tissue experiment in his petri dish. John snapped his laptop closed and set it on the study table, over a mess of books and files set out by the disorganized alpha.
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asked and John knew it was a strange question to ask, being Sherlock was the one who’d been in immediate danger, but he knew why the alpha was filled with concern. John was pregnant and the stress from this night alone could cause a strain for him.
who was the other woman, not him. That beta wasn't meant to be with John. It was Sherlock's place she'd stolen and he had half a mind to launch himself at her and stab her bulging belly, kill her and her pup.
John took another sip of his coffee and wondered dejectedly what Sherlock was doing right then. Most likely experimenting or dissecting a human organ, and all John wanted to do was be there beside him.
Unsure what to do with his hands, Sherlock shifted to rest them over his own legs while John's arms wrapped around his waist and held him securely, his nose buried within his curls and giving audible inhales of his scent.
So long he'd suffered and yet, it would seem his suffering was not over. They'd removed him from the hospital and taken him here. In a room that smelled of the alpha, which could only mean he was within the alpha's home.
"Stop! Stop, we can't giggle, it's a crime scene. Stop it!" John admonished Sherlock, even though he smiled cheek to cheek and was hardly finished tittering on.
“Nnnmph!” John whimpered when a hand nudged him closer still to the warmth of Sherlock’s body and only then did John realize he was still naked.
John didn’t see the bicyclist as he zipped by and clipped him, causing him to slam hard into the ground—though not as hard as… “Sherlock… Sherlock…”
John kissed Sherlock again, a promise of more, and the dazzlingly lopsided grin that was his answer made John’s heart swell.
John was seated with a large group of people, eating and laughing. A woman with a brightly colored pink and silver birthday hat on was in the center of the group, by far the loudest and drunkest of them all.
Something about spending time with Victor was different. Harry, John spent less time with now. It hurt to lie to her, his guilt was causing him to pull away. Sherlock, well like his sister, the guilt was killing him. He hated lying to his husband, but John couldn't mend his lies with affection because Sherlock was so bloody repressed.
“Here are a few pamphlets I have. They explain exactly what options are left for you. As I mentioned before there are treatments I can implement to help boost your low fertility, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will work… However, this can all be discussed in the future when you are ready.”
John looked away in shame. He wasn’t even good enough to call himself Sherlock’s mate. He was no longer healthily fertile, he could give Sherlock the possibility of one child, and even that possibility was very low, he held no place in their union.
Sherlock gave in to the darkness that swallowed him up whole, but not before he heard the alpha belt out a wounded cry.
The moment John entered the room where his patient was waiting, he wasn't expecting to meet a familiar face. The man sat up on the patient bed, legs crossed, hands pressed behind him, leaning back in a way to accentuate the fullness of his hips and the length of his legs.
"Do what you must. I'm going out." Sherlock rose from his seat, his chair scraping against the floor loudly.
He thought over the events that happened to him. How he'd been forced to bond a disloyal alpha. How he'd been sentenced to live a miserable mated life to a man he didn't want anymore, just so he could live.
"You're smoking." John felt a sense of worry take root. Long ago learning of Sherlock's vices and that if the omega was smoking, this couldn't be leading to anything good.
He soon spotted far off in the distance a wooden farmhouse. John wandered over to the building, inquisitive as to what it housed, and when he entered he found it was a 12 stall horses stable. In each stall was a magnificent horse. John didn’t know much about horses, but he loved them. His great uncle Phil had two horses out in the country and when he was a child, he would visit him for the summer. John helped feed them and brush out their coat. He’d been too young to ride one at the time, but Phil promised to take him when he got older. Only, Phil passed away before that could happen.
"I know, darling. Remember, this stage will pass. You're doing so well." John's lips pressed into his shoulder, the pads of his fingers kindly rubbing his scalp. A moment after Sherlock expelled everything left over and caught his breath, he grabbed at the hand towel John retrieved from the counter.
"I can’t... I can’t do it, John. I don’t know how." Sherlock straightened up onto his knees then. "Forgive me?"
John inhaled a deep breath, held it for a long moment, and then released it as well as setting free his disinclination.
The silence started once more and as they turned left, John glanced over to Sherlock, still three feet behind him, seeming to give him the distance he wanted. He loved keeping their distance, but if he wanted to make an effort, he’d have to go outside of his comfort zone.
"I'm sorry I hurt you. I was in the army for so long and I was lonely. I just wanted to fill that loneliness until I found you."
"I... He threatened me. He'd gotten hurt that day and... if I hadn't done it, I don't know what he would have done to himself."
No. John’s omega would never love him. Three weeks. They’d been married for three weeks and Sherlock hardly spoke to him.
"Take me." Sherlock replied, willing, and ran his hands up John's arms to his shoulders and squeezed with desperation. "Take me, John."
“So, okay, what have we got? We know there are footprints, because Henry found them; so did the tour guide bloke. We all heard something.” John tried to clarify everything in the hopes it would clear the worry from Sherlock’s mind and have him refocus on the case.
"God!" John stopped touching himself and pushed back further onto the bed. Crawling back until his back hit the headboard, John spread his legs and began fondling his balls with one hand while his other stroked at his inner thigh.
Sherlock chanced a glance up and found the warmest smile on John's face, his eyes expressing how touched he was by his confession.
Sherlock said nothing, but if looks could kill, John would be buried six feet under right about now.
The door to the alpha's car swung open. True to Sherlock's analysis, the alpha was tall - taller than Sherlock by two to three inches.
Mycroft's features smoothed out to give nothing away as he deliberated this idea. "You mean to appeal to his animal state in sessions to heal him over a period of time rather than to consummate the union to do so in one act."
Sherlock smiled weakly and raised his eyes to meet Mycroft's gaze. "It wouldn't have changed anything. He felt it, yet he chose an alpha in the end. Always alphas... Mary shot me, nearly killing me, and he went back to her because of the baby. John will always choose the mother of his child."
John buried his face in his pillow, smothering the sound of a pitiful whimper. How could this marriage work if Sherlock refused to love him? But then again Sherlock never made promises to love him. John had to remind himself that their marriage wasn’t of their making. Sherlock married him because of a contract he’d made with his family. John married Sherlock for the insurance of a contract he’d made for his own reasons. This marriage was never going to be what John wanted it to be, and the sooner he accepted this, the easier things would be.
John’s fangs extended at the sight of Irene wearing one of Sherlock’s dress shirts and nothing else. The nerve of this woman, to sleep in their marriage bed, then to wear his husband’s shirt, John wanted nothing more than to throw her out of their home, but no—Sherlock wouldn’t be pleased with John when he slipped out of his mind palace and learned of what he’d done.
Content and happy, he wasn't. But he was more at ease. More himself. More open. More needing and feeling.
The knotting in Gregory’s stomach felt worse now. This really didn’t feel right. Heather was good looking, nice, and he wanted her, but he couldn’t settle the alpha within. His inner alpha’s hair stood on end, taking on a threatening stance. The alpha didn’t like her. It felt wrong to be with her.
“Mm, okay.” Sherlock hummed, distracted with his organs and John grumbled curses on his way to their bedroom where he slammed the door shut, refusing to be in the same room as the completely ludicrous alpha.
Sherlock's eyes snapped open, not realizing he'd shut them. Panting heavily, Sherlock stared up wildly at the John before him that wasn't the John of before. The John of before wore day clothes. This John of now wore a gray t-shirt and black sweats, hair no longer combed neatly - no, this John of now hair stuck up as if he'd just woken from sleep. John's eyes were just as wide and full of fear, searching Sherlock's with confused wonder.
Silence followed, the omega slowly circling the alpha, taking in his slanted head, open neck, lowered eyes to the ground, shoulders slumped, seeming broken of the will to fight. A broken alpha.
John brewed himself a pot of tea and just as he’d seated himself with a cup, Mycroft’s phone rang. The pale gentleman answered it on the third ring and received the news John already knew himself.
"You mean to delete him from your memories." Mycroft acknowledged. "Are you sure you want to do that?"
It hurt. Sherlock couldn’t keep putting himself out there for John to shoot him down like he was nobody. His heart was tattered and unbearable heartbreak was his only comfort. He lived each day with emptiness in the pit of his stomach as it churned horribly, and a devastatingly seizing heart.
“Yeah, all right, Spock, just…” John was tense himself, hurt, and frustrated with Sherlock’s disregard of his care as he devalued his sense of sentiment and therefore devalued his feelings for John.
John’s hands gripped tightly to the armrests of his seat. He hadn’t realized they were trembling until a hand reached out and pried one of his off the seat. John snapped his head in Sherlock’s direction and found silent tears falling from the alpha’s deadened eyes.
The wedding planning had only just begun when the Watsons called and informed them that John had enlisted himself in the army. Sherlock’s parents, although disappointed, thought it would most likely be better if they held off the wedding, since Sherlock was still rather young. Age really didn’t matter, so long as an alpha and omega reached sexual maturity, and Sherlock felt bitterness consume him. He couldn’t help wonder if the reason John was enlisting was to get out of marrying him.
Dinner wasn’t at all comfortable. John spent the majority of it listing to Mrs. Holmes chatter on about nothing of importance and glancing over to the other Holmeses. Mr. Holmes silently ate his meal, and contented himself in ignoring Mrs. Holmes. Mycroft stared over at John and Sherlock, as if contemplating their compatibility. Sherlock sat mutely tossing his food around on his plate with his fork and every once in a while, his eyes would rise and stare back at John. John would smile in answer, but Sherlock would then look fiercely at him before focusing on his food once more.
When several more moment's passed in silence, Gregory raised his head and looked up in annoyance. That annoyance was quickly wiped away with shock.
. Sherlock would be damned if he let himself become mentally unstable to that point just because John didn't know how to keep his dick to himself.
"He loves you. He's protected you nearly his whole life. He deserves to be loved. You need to realize you have every right to love him, alpha or not. He isn't your enemy... He's always been your angel."
"It's a boy." The doctor told them and offered him up to one of the nurses, who took him off to the side to take care of him as the doctor seated herself back down.
Confused who it could be, John limped over to it and swung it open and found a tall, pale gentleman standing in front of him. Leaning on his expensive long gray umbrella, much like John did with his cane, the gentleman raised the envelope he’d dropped off no more than four hours earlier at the post office.
Sherlock stiffened at John’s words before he spun and strode towards him. As he neared him, John noticed Sherlock biting his bottom lip nervously.
John lowered himself, pressing his chest against Sherlock's, one hand gripping Sherlock's hair, the other cupping his face, and he stared. Stared at Sherlock with all the love he possessed for it was a surprising amount of love, more so than Sherlock had seen in any couple he'd ever met. It was reassuring and inspiring.
The moment Sherlock exited the bedroom; John hopped out of the bed, and retrieved his discarded clothes lying about around the floor of Sherlock’s room. John could hear Sherlock’s annoyed voice and Lestrade’s muffled response as he hurriedly changed into his clothes.
"Myself." Sherlock sighed, this wasn't the first time John had given him warning about his social inadequacy.
Reluctantly, Sherlock pulled away from John, but he raised his head to stare up at him with a wide toothy grin. A large cold hand went to palm his face and John’s omega fought through his mild hesitation and leaned into the touch.
After John finished wrapping Sherlock’s leg, the alpha shifted to seat himself near Sherlock’s waist.
Ella nodded, a sense of relief filling her. From what John had told her, Sherlock seemed to truly love him. John’s confession couldn’t come at a better time. Sherlock’s love being validated would only bring the two closer.
John watched with fascination as the omega squirmed beneath him, panting harshly past those pale pink lips, un-kissed, untouched. John had yet to gain the courage to kiss Sherlock. This was instinct and nature. Was kissing part of that? If it were, would Sherlock allow him that personal expression? John's free hand lowered and neared the entrance between Sherlock's small sack and his asshole. His entrance was wet, flushed, the hole barely the size of a nickel, so small and he could finally understand why Sherlock attempted to run when baring sight of his alpha cock.
John felt ashamed after he jerked himself off; for having such a reaction to something that should have repulsed him, and for the fact that he knew his alpha would most likely scent his spunk in the shower the next time he used it.
“Why aren’t you doing anything? Save him now!” Sherlock was losing himself to grief as the doctor worked on determining John’s state.
Sherlock couldn't answer, because he wasn't sure. If he wasn't sure, then wasn't that a yes? Didn't that mean he was weak?
After the case, John was amazed at the brilliance that was his husband and even more so that because of Sherlock, John’s limp had vanished. After that case, John heartily joined Sherlock on another, and another. Cases began pouring in the more John wrote in his blog. His blog became popular and soon, their names were in the papers and Sherlock’s work was renowned.
"I'm not angry with you." Sherlock announced, slipping on a pair of pants, realizing he smelled of sex and stale heat, but that didn't matter right now. He was going to kill Mycroft. A shower was not important, as it did nothing to progress the reality that he would strangle that pompous prick to death.
“Okay.” Sherlock stared at the flushed cock, one hand gripping the back of his thigh while his other moved smoothly up John’s hip and further still, until he caressed fondly over John’s belly.
Sherlock’s stare was fixed on him, eyes so open and kind. John couldn’t even understand how he’d come to this decision, never expecting this conversation to ever take place or that he’d want this, but it did and he did.
Running his hand over the thin cotton of his shirt, he felt the newly welted scar of his stomach where they’d operated, John’s breath hitched at the remembrance of how he’d once been full, now he was empty.
Sherlock felt a shiver course down his spine and shut his eyes. Inhaling calm measured breaths, Sherlock refused to be aroused.
John twisted his hand in Sherlock’s loose hold to take possession of it and raise it to his mouth and planted a kind kiss to his knuckles.
Sherlock's anger faded when that thumb, the evil, glorious thumb dug in deep and Sherlock belted a noise, something between a yelp, and an elating moan. Heat rose to Sherlock's cheeks as John's thumb swirled within him and he was helpless, all he could do was bare down on that fat thumb and ride it, chasing that wonderful, toe curling feeling.
John froze, so that was what the older Holmes brother asked of him? It was true Mycroft had been assigned his mediator. An omega was always appointed a mediator within the alpha’s family. They were to provide anything that the omega needed. Usually the omega’s alpha tended to the more instinctual needs of an omega, whereas a mediator would provide for whatever else the omega required.
Mycroft, who'd been silently watching the events from the corner of the room, quietly moved to join John at the bar. The smile that remained upon his face since this whole hideous party started widened when he spoke to John. His alpha didn't seem all that pleased to talk to Mycroft.
John’s fingers tousled dark locks into a mess and he let out a sudden groan of delight when Sherlock’s mouth descended on a sensitive nipple. Sherlock nibbled on the nub with his teeth, careful not to press fangs along the tender flesh, bruising and inflaming the nub to hardness, playfully sucking at it in an openmouthed kiss when the hardened bead twitched in his mouth.
The meal was wonderful and John promised himself to ask Angelo again just what the name of this particular pasta was, because he knew it was now one of his favorites. Sherlock indulged more in his consumption of the wine rather than the food, and it was fine with John, because he knew Sherlock had a smaller appetite than most. He only asked that Sherlock eat enough as to not fill his empty stomach with just wine.
John’s nose scrunched up, his cock already having taken attention mid-tasting of Sherlock had hardened completely when Sherlock said—
Mycroft winced. He didn’t like the way Lestrade said his name, full of worry and hurt and it made his chest sore, because he couldn’t erase the memory of the woman kissing Gregory, touching him, and how Gregory accepted it.
“I love you.” John blurted and groaned, he didn’t want to surprise attack Sherlock with his admission.
“Hmm?” Sherlock smiled amusedly, focusing the knob of his microscope while still trying to lean into John’s embrace.
"Good." John dipped low and surprised Sherlock with a wet kiss to his cheek, before the alpha was up and heading for the door.
John managed to reassure Mrs. Holmes he wouldn’t let that happen, he’d bind himself to Sherlock and care for him as an alpha should. John meant what he said and thought it would console Mrs. Holmes, but she’d only become worse, sniffling and hiccupping sobs. A disjointed ‘
“Promise?” John asked at a loss, biting into his lower lip, holding off on a pleading moan when Sherlock’s hand ceased its teasing.
"No." John bit his bottom lip, hating to reject the plea. It pained him to refuse a request he so wished he could fulfill for himself as well as for Sherlock. "No. I can't."
Alpha pheromones thickly filled the room and John almost gagged by the potency of it. John whined softly, though he relaxed under the scent of his alpha’s pheromones, he could still feel the anxiety in Sherlock.
"Just say it." Sherlock huffed, slamming the jar back to the counter and turning to stare at the side wall.
Eight months. Gregory Lestrade had been dating Mycroft Holmes for eight months and still, they still hadn't gotten physically closer than a kiss on the cheek or a quick nuzzle of the scent gland after a date. Each kiss on the cheek and scenting was enacted by Gregory. It would appear that Mycroft wasn't in a hurry to strengthen their commitment. That or he simply didn't have a sex drive.
It was quite difficult steadying his hands enough so that he could unlock the front door of his flat, and a silent reminder of just how much he’d let himself go. Letting out a laugh of pride when the door swung open, John silently crept down the hall and to a shut door.
"What?" John was furious. This wasn't right. Sherlock was smarter than this. He always found a way out. "No, no, no, no, no, no. This is a trick."
When John arrived home he’d find Sherlock performing an experiment of some kind, playing his violin, or working on a small case to pass the time, and he’d order take out or make them something to eat—but mostly take out, as John didn’t feel like he had the courage to look through the refrigerator, always nervous what he might find beyond it. There was that one time he’d opened the refrigerator and was met by the sight of a human head…
"Sherlock, I just wanted to see what you felt like eating for - What are you doing?" John cut himself off curiously when, Sherlock scrabbled to pull down his shirt and reached for the jar of cream set out on the nightstand.
“You’re not the only one who was bound in this marriage. Can you at least acknowledge that your alpha might feel the same?”
Sherlock blinked slowly. Struggling to stay aware of his surroundings, but his mind and body were too far gone for an omega. He was 36. His mind was sick, as too was his body becoming. But now, now the alpha had claimed him with the bond of a mated alpha and omega pair.
-ed’ with a new message from The Women. Endeavoring to convince himself it was only case related, that The Woman wasn’t trying to seduce his husband.
With slow, unsteady steps did John take, and broke the distance between them. Sherlock watched with apt attention, partly stunned that the alpha had given in. A part of him had thought John would refuse. That the alpha cared too little to appease Sherlock of his hurts, but it would seem John could be made to debase himself when the possibility of Sherlock's suicide was put into play.
Pulling away from the alpha, Sherlock held tightly to John's jugular and yanked him towards him. John strangled out a noise of protest, but quickly followed the omega's lead as it would cause him pain not to. His breathing was short and unsteady by the hold Sherlock had on his throat and the deranged Sherlock felt his inner omega curl up on itself, whimpering pathetically as he defied his instincts to nurture his mate and instead wished to inflict pain.
an omega who could freely love him and right now, John wasn't there mentally. Sure, he could go now and beg Sherlock to take him back. But if he did it still wouldn't change the way things had been between them. It wouldn't fix what was internally wrong with John. He would still shy away from expressions of love, he'd still question Sherlock's motives and distrust him, though he knew Sherlock was a good man. When Sherlock failed to reach his expectations, John would answer his mate with cruelty.
Sherlock growled another frustrated snarl, swiping clawed hands across the study table and sending a mess of books and papers scattering to the ground. Images of Lestrade pressing John against a wall, nosing the expanse of his neck, scenting the blond, flashed in Sherlock’s mind.
Moving closer to the glass box, Sherlock raised out a hand and lowered it down a ways from the pups. Both followed his moments closely, and after a brief pause the two rose from the group of five that all at once started licking and hopping near the edge.
John's face crumpled in misery, snapping his eyes shut, he rasped with devastation, "I didn't know... I didn't know he was my mate, but I still... I loved him."
The alpha before him released a heavy sigh and palmed his eyes, using his slender fingers to rub at them as they clenched tightly together.
They were married, but John also knew it was a possibility. Maybe Sherlock already had someone else and John hadn’t noticed. Maybe as John had remained alone at the estate Sherlock had been seeing another.
John stared pleadingly at Ella, not wanting to voice the paining truth he had to live with every second of every day.
“And there is a whole childhood in a nutshell.” Sherlock grumbled, the agitation still having not left Sherlock completely.
sounded good. His cock dripped an obscene amount of pre-come all as his entrance gave a greedy squelching squirt of slick.
John watched mutedly as Sherlock squirted a generous amount of lubricant into his palm. His mouth parted on a voiceless gasp when Sherlock fisted himself and stroked his half erect cock. John’s hand shot down to grip himself, moaning longingly, feeling so very ready and watching Sherlock stroking himself to full hardness was just too much.
Mycroft pursed his lips in anger, wanting to agree, but then his cell rang and work was calling him back to the present.
Sherlock angrily wiped his eyes dry, and caught the scent of alpha permeating his hand from where the alpha had held it. Drawing it away from his marked face, Sherlock contradicted the turmoil within and wrapped his arm around the alpha's waist, taking hold of one of John's hands and shuffling himself up close to the man's back. Close enough so that he could nuzzle the nape of the alpha's neck and inhale his calming scent. John didn't rouse awake, simply hummed sleepily and slipped further in the fog of slumber.
John wasn’t sure how he’d sound if he spoke then, his body trembled much like Sherlock’s hands had and he knew his voice would do much the same. Instead he hummed in agreement—even when humming he sounded wrecked.
“End of Baker Street, there’s a good Chinese, stays open till two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle.” Sherlock noted.
Sherlock tensed, mind working to read Moriarty’s body language, think as Moriarty thought, and when he came to his answer it was too late. Moriarty turned his sights on John, snapped his fingers, a laser dart lowered from John’s chest to his abdomen and shot once.
“I don’t wish to dominate you.” Sherlock pronounced firmly, a hand reaching out and taking possession of John’s left before he’d had the chance to retract it.
John knew how rare an alpha submissive was and that if he were to register himself as one he’d immediately be on the headline news. He’d become an instant celebrity and then… only
Sherlock pushed back, working through the four agents’ resistance and stared red eyed at Mycroft who looked apprehensive, and he should be, because Sherlock was going to obliterate him.
John’s eyes stung even more so, gleaming and the alpha’s features blurred together. Lowering his head, John bit his bottom lip, nodded a silent thank you when the alpha said nothing more. John left Sherlock to stand alone while he made his way back to the estate.
Sherlock’s lips parted with surprise and he gawked at John as he pulled away to seat himself at the table.
Sliding his tongue out, Sherlock slid a wet snake-like pattern along one of John’s legs and to the crease of his thigh, before pressing another kiss there. Just before dragging his tongue where Sherlock knew John’s needs was the most prominent, a grating snore bubbled from above him.
"So then..." Mycroft began as the car lurched to life, "I didn't think I would need to tell you this, but from your childish behavior, it would seem that I was wrong. Sherlock, you cannot run off like that."
Grunting noisily, Sherlock thrust up again, yanking John down with the hold on his hips in the same moment he thrust up and John bounced by the force, delightfully groaning when Sherlock struck that place within.
Sherlock was not in shock like this alpha feared. No. Mycroft knew him better than that. Yes, he might be in shock, but it was his disposition and frustrations that caused him to sit in silence and stare blankly at the foreign room's wall.
“Why would I do that? Then I’d miss the look on your face when you finally decide to raise your head.”
When John laid his head to the pillow, he heard the rustling of clothing and realized only then, Sherlock was removing his clothing.
John didn’t even realize he’d been dragged into a bedroom until the alpha shut a door behind them and released him of his hold. John cradled his reddening hand the alpha had gripped to so tightly and stumbled back fearfully. When the back of his knees connected with something and he fell back on a plush bed, John whimpered keenly, staring up at the impassive gaze of the alpha.
Later, the hospital brought someone over to show him how to breastfeed his pups. His breasts had swollen and he began to lactate almost as soon after giving birth. Sherlock breastfed each and every one of his pups until they had their fill, ignoring John's presence through it all. Even when John embraced him and their pup in his arm, whispered how much he loved them and dotingly caressed their pup's cheek as he sucked on his teat.
. Shoving deep, pushing as far as he could go into Sherlock, John squeaked noisily as his orgasm hit. Sherlock would tease him about it later, when he wasn’t feeling John’s hot seed shooting inside him all while his hard knot slammed past his unprepared rim, knotting and breeding him in one move.
When Sherlock took hold of John’s hand and slipped on the wedding ring, he felt sick to his stomach, his omega still refusing to look at him. As John viciously shoved the ring he held on Sherlock’s finger, Sherlock bit back a pained whimper.
“Oh… Oh my dear boy…” Mrs. Holmes shook her head adamantly, “No, child. Heavens no. That is not what I meant. I haven’t come to… No, child. How could you think I’d do that?”
"Right now, I want to feel your thick fingers in my omega hole. I want to soil your hand in my slick. Then I want the tip of your cock to plug my omega hole. I'm going to leak all over it. Make your cock reek of my slick. Just the tip though. I don't know if I could take the whole thing right now."
Still… Sherlock said nothing, but he stared so intently that John didn’t have to be an expert in deducing to know Sherlock really wanted to ask him something.
“I’m starting to see just how much.” Sherlock’s voice was gentle then, as if truly taking in just how much feeling John possessed for him.
“Oh, John.” Mrs. Watson whined standing and moving towards her emotional son, open arms, needing to comfort him of his pain.
Currently they stood together, preforming the bonding ceremony to become mated. As if Sherlock would just accept it. He wouldn't, damn what his family wanted. He refused to be claimed. He refused to be mated. Sherlock rather die than degrade himself into becoming this alpha's plaything, because that's what he would become. It didn't matter what the scientific data and charts said. This alpha might be his true mate, but Sherlock refused to be this alpha's second. Seconds couldn't even marry their mates. They could only preform the bonding ceremony.
John knew he'd never love anyone but his Sherlock. He'd said as much to his husband, but John wondered if Sherlock ever truly understood just how serious he'd been. For some, love could come and go, and even if one love remained, another could develop over time, one that equaled or even surpassed the prior. But a love like that wasn't the kind of love John felt. The love John felt was a one in a lifetime kind of love. A love that was whole. A love that consumed and left nothing else to give. A love that was constant, unbreakable, and immeasurable.
"I'll pick you up here at eight then." Mycroft managed to say before stumbling out of the office. Feeling Gregory's eyes follow him as he went.
The omega was pressed up against the lower cabinets of the kitchen, long legs splayed open, unwilling to close them and create a sweltering friction. Only, by doing so, it enhanced the scent of Sherlock's sex.
Sherlock’s sleepily glanced over to John when he continued to stand beside him. John smiled at the curious furrowing of dark brows and regardless of the question in Sherlock’s pale green eyes; he bent low and placed a soft kiss to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
"I love you." John rasped, burying his head against the crook of Sherlock's neck. One hand moved to palm Sherlock's hip, his other shifting blindly further down and between their bodies.
John shut his eyes, feeling unbelievably tired and it really didn't matter what Sherlock had him say, he knew who he was. If Sherlock wanted to be rough with him that was okay too. John felt worse in the war.
Why on earth would the alpha submissive still want to marry Sherlock after he’d made the terms of their marriage clear? John should have refused. Laughed in Sherlock’s face and wished him luck on finding an alpha that would agree to an absurd marriage. John should have called the wedding off.
"It's all okay, Sherlock." John's eyes were kind and he helpfully lowered Sherlock's shirt to cover the revealed skin of his back.
The alpha took a step towards him, no doubt intent on comforting him, but Sherlock wouldn't allow it and hurriedly stepped away from him.
John drew back nearly all the way before he thrust back in with precision and force. Sherlock moaned and tossed his head to one side, breathing laboriously into his pillow. Each thrust following stoked the fire of his heat, creating a high he thought unreachable, and clouding every other thought. His body was driven by one purpose as were all omegas when in heat. He needed to be bred, thoroughly knotted, only after would clarity reach him.
John’s groans, shifted to soft breathy moans as Sherlock dragged his teeth delicately over his flesh and lower still to his stomach once more and placed caring kisses over the tender flesh that was there.
"I mean... I do care, but that's not why I came. I can handle that, but not... I... Sherlock needs more help than I thought. I won't allow myself to be cornered like that again."
Sherlock found it difficult to meet John’s eyes, his vision fogging over with tears. He’d failed to protect John. Failed to keep the omega of his pups safe and now he was full of regrets. He shouldn’t have pushed so hard, he should have let Moriarty go; none of it mattered if he didn’t have John.
"Can't get anything passed you." Sherlock mocked, smoke exhaling out of his mouth along with his words.
Sherlock listened to whatever Lestrade had to say before answering that they were on their way and hurriedly hung up. Rising to his feet, Sherlock spared John an apologetic look.
"I'll make you regret this." Victor swore viciously, glaring at Sherlock and then at John, holding the alpha's gaze, though his bottom lip trembled on a voiceless sob.
"My John." Sherlock whimpered, squirming with the aftershocks, feeling completely used and unbelievably good.
John almost felt relieved by this, but then Sherlock had to add amusedly, “You want me inside of you, don’t you? You want me to be the alpha to your omega. You want to be claimed and strengthen our bond, don’t you John? Say yes, John, tell me just how much you want it?”
John raised his left leg and drew it up over one of Sherlock’s hips, and kneed the edge of the table, losing his balance somewhat, but refusing to let loose, John compressed Sherlock firmly against his body and tongue-fucked him, his tongue diving in and out, hardly giving Sherlock enough time to play with it before extracting it. Sherlock whimpered pitifully, wordlessly pleading for John to stop all his mischievous playful teasing and give. It was too much fun to stop. John had only ever kissed one person, Sherlock, and his heat hadn’t really given him the time or patience to experiment with kissing. John wanted to explore Sherlock’s mouth; all while gaining more valuable information and learning the best ways to please Sherlock.
“Oh Jesus, no. God, no.” John slurred, the world spinning around him, his omega’s screams vibrating through his whole body, his heart constricting to the point of palpitations, he was going through the shock an omega only went through at the loss of their alpha. If he didn’t get help soon, he’d die of the stress.
John bit his bottom lip. "I... You're not cruel necessarily, just reserved - repressed really. I understand you are not given to sentimental expressions, but Victor... He's kind and... Sherlock, trust me. I'm yours in every way,  but I need this friendship in my life right now."
Raising a hand to palm Sherlock’s knee, John shuffled to kneel directly in front of the alpha and nudged the still alpha’s knee, coaxing him into awareness.
“Does it unsettle you?” John pressed his nose to the nape of Sherlock’s neck and inhaled his pleasing scent.
"Before I say anything, understand that it doesn't change anything between us. I still feel as I have always felt for you."
If he took what could clearly be his now, he wasn't sure he'd be able to treasure and nurture it. There were so many things wrong with him. He'd been emotionally, mentally, and physically abused as a child. Those betas had destroyed his fragile mind to the point where he couldn't love Sherlock in the way he wanted to. The way he knew his husband deserved.
“Nice touch this, the pool. Where little Carl died. I stopped him. I can stop John Watson too. Stop his heart.” John’s voice broke.
“Drink.” John encouraged, sliding into the seat beside Sherlock instead of across from him, which was what he normally did—but he was
“Oh.” Sherlock knew John had a point; the first copulation of a heat was always a bit foggy. After the first release, things always did become a bit clearer.
Ella’s nostrils flared, the overwhelming scent of anguish filling the room. John was a stubborn man, never really wanting to admit how helpless he felt, but now, John was giving in, exposing his vulnerability within the safety of her room.
"How's married life treating you? Seen the magazines. You two look like the perfect couple. Going on dates after a case, celebrating your accomplishments, flaunting it to the whole world." Victor mocked.
"I will. Jesus. Just shut up." John raised out a hand to cup Sherlock's face, his other gripping to silky curls and holding fast as he rutted into him with far less care.
John swallowed beyond the soreness of his throat and nodded steadfastly. Sherlock grinned toothily, breaking their stare in that moment and without faltering took the head of John’s cock in his mouth and sucked.
Sherlock shuddered and then his hips came to a halt, hot release filling John within and three strokes of their joined hands had John coming with a sharp inhale of breath. John’s free hand glided over the soft undertones of Sherlock’s muscular back, his lips pressing from the corner of Sherlock’s mouth to the side of his neck.
“It’s not good for a pregnant omega to stay up so late. Don’t you agree, Sherlock?” John mused merrily.
Sherlock didn’t say please, not easily, John knew this. ‘Please’ and ‘Sorry’ were words Sherlock said little and only when in relation to John. The ‘please’ of Sherlock’s request made John want to look up even when he was so terribly humiliated.
John felt cold realization take root. He felt like a fool and yet, still, there was relief, because Sherlock hadn't found out the truth of their marriage. John could never stomach the hurt that truth might cause. This... John knew he'd done wrong by lying to Sherlock about Victor, but this was a lie, John could handle.
John began hyperventilating, knowing just how disastrous that would be for his current state and yet unable to catch his breath as tears burst forth and fogged his vision. Lids falling heavy, but John fought against giving in.
Sherlock let out soft deep groans and John couldn’t control himself anymore as he came so hard, his back arched off the bed and Sherlock’s throat relaxed to take in the spurting load of John’s seed.
“Okay, we’ll go!” Harry exclaimed, grumbling nonsense while assisting John to his feet and out the door.
"I love your strength. I love your mind. I love your patience. I love how you will always take my side with my horrid family. You are... You are more than I deserve and I... I love that you still stay will me even when I don't make it easy." Sherlock's voice clipped at the end, getting overly sentimental and John realized it was painfully hard for Sherlock to tell him all of this, but he was because John had asked it of him. John shouldn't have, it was clear Sherlock loved him, but admitting to all these things was making him feel vulnerable and open. John didn't need anymore. This was enough to last him a lifetime. Sherlock could tell him he loved him - that was all he would ever need to know. The rest Sherlock could think of him and keep safely within his Mind Palace.
Sherlock hurriedly set his plate down on the table and spun on his heel and made an attempt to sulk somewhere far off, needing to contemplate this strange reaction of his. Only, he was stopped by a hand to his arm and met his mother’s determined gaze.
John inhaled a deep breath, nodding his head with voiceless understanding and shuffled his feet, giving himself away. Sherlock knew how to read John's body language more than anyone else's. John didn't like that. He thought Sherlock was implying he wasn't coming back for personal reasons. As if Sherlock would willingly want to stay away. As if he could possibly live a life away from London city and away from John Watson.
John knew… He understood after he had time to gather his thoughts, to talk it over with his doctor, there had been no way to save their children. It was either he died with his pups or his pregnancy was terminated and they saved his life. It was a heartbreaking thought, that for him to live, it meant he’d lose his children. John felt guilt. He knew there was nothing that could be done, but still, it was so very painful.
John ducked his head bashfully, unable to hold Sherlock’s gaze for longer than a moment, and stared down at his cup now resting on the table.
Sherlock's nose crinkled with revolt at that notion. Many true mates, upon first seeing each other fell in love. It was a thing Sherlock had wished for when he was a child, but now found hard to believe.
John couldn’t take the steps to Sherlock, though that was all he wanted to do at that very moment. He was trembling so much, full of nervousness.
“Happy?” Mycroft asked, releasing a heavy sigh, obviously having been stressed by the dangers of Sherlock being so close to his omega and nearly losing himself to instinct.
." John's alpha moaned when Sherlock shifted just slightly, enough so that long lean legs could wrap around his hips, and he tenderly moved to kiss the underside of Sherlock's chin, a submissive action and yet so full of a protective alpha instinct. Kissing more fervently as the omega's nails drew blood from his scalp. At the same time, John's cock moved minutely within the no longer virginal opening. God, it was satisfying to know Sherlock was no longer a virgin, that he didn't have to smell the purity of his mate, and be reminded that he hadn't taken what was his. Sherlock was his, now and forever, just his.
Sherlock waited for a response, but there was a long silence that filled John's end - no doubt he was relieved that their pups were safe. Then a bark of laughter filled the alpha's end.
John’s eyes narrowed in on his mother who suddenly stood from where she sat in the front row and hurriedly made her way towards him. John couldn’t stop the tears from fogging his vision and he whimpered, terrified, he whimpered for his mother’s comfort, because he couldn’t do this.
Sherlock leaned back in the shadows of the night, pressed against the brick wall of a closed bank and stared across the street and into the small, nearly empty café. He couldn't believe his eyes. Yet, seated near the large window of the café, sat John - his John Watson, his alpha, mate, husband, - and across from him was seated Victor Trevor.
The air was chilled as it swept against his face and he watched the jet speed off. Sherlock was gone and as he stared at the jet quickly dissipating, John felt Mycroft's presence.
Everyone was still, waiting for him to speak, but John couldn’t. How could he talk about his experiences as if he were explaining the weather? Mr. and Mrs. Watson stared at John on edge, knowing he was still suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. They never asked him about his time in the army because they knew there were painful memories there that he still couldn’t come to terms with, but his in-laws didn’t know that. He was seeing a therapist to work through his trauma, but he was far from being healed enough to talk about his experiences.
John shushed Sherlock's insistent pleas, knowing they'd waited enough and removed his hand. Gripping the base of his cock, John lifted his hips just slightly, enough so to guide his cock's head to Sherlock's entrance.
Sherlock snarled ravenous for more. He wouldn’t kill Mycroft—at least… he’d try not to, for their mother’s sake, but he wanted to see Mycroft bleed just a bit more. He wanted to see Mycroft on the ground much like the two agents, and he would have, if not for the four agents pinning him against the wall, and not letting up on their pressure.
"What did I say about the dirty talk?" John playfully admonished, but he was already rolling off of Sherlock and shuffling up to one side of him.
“Found who?” Sherlock stammered, his stomach knotting with nerves, not knowing what she was talking about, but unsettled by the possibility of what it might be.
.” John gasped, not knowing what to do. He felt as if he were losing himself in Sherlock’s eyes…so stunningly blue, like the crashing waves of an ocean, reflecting light and beauty.
When he finally got rid of his garments, he took hold of the red cloth and pressed his nose against it. He moaned throatily, falling back onto the bed, and touching his bare chest with his other hand. God, his body felt warm in ways he couldn’t understand, as if something was alight within.
much.” John’s words came out in a choked breathless confession that immediately softened the tension in Sherlock’s brow.
Mycroft's lips pursed in a way that gave Sherlock the impression he wanted to say something, but after a brief pause the gentleman looked away. Sherlock interpreted it as Mycroft's acknowledgment of his words.
John's thrusts came, leaving no space to gather himself, his mind was becoming a chaotic place. No longer bringing him sense of ease or clarity. It was senseless. He was losing everything, but this. The feelings John was giving him.
as he'd said. Sherlock didn't protest to the idea. He actually enjoyed taking walks every once in a while and since he'd been committed into a mental institution for so long, he hadn't really had the opportunity to take a walk out in the open for a long while.
“As Sherlock no doubt mentioned to you, John, I was always good with words. I did, in fact, become a linguist. I have a particular weakness for the Romance languages. I always have.”  She pauses to smile shyly at Mycroft. “I had an excellent Latin tutor.  That’s what got me started.”
“Katherine, I need you to lie still and try to stay calm.  Sherlock, pressure.  Katherine, how far along were you?”
John enters the room and clears his throat. The brothers stop in their examination of the coat’s collar, and turn to John for an update.
John looks back and forth between the picture and the man standing before him. “The longer length suits you. You look resentful in the photo.”
Katherine laughed, handing the photos over to John for a closer look.  “He eventually did do that. Fortunately, he stayed away from her prize rose bushes, a chose to experiment on a few  in an out of the way corner of the garden. It took her forever to notice, and she never did, as far as I know, figure out the exact cause of death.”
“I did. I do, but working with you is...well, it’s lot more exciting than doing a prostate exam or having some kid throw up on me, which happened this morning-”
Mycroft and Katherine have a short chat when she wakes up to find him watching over her as she sleeps.
Sherlock isn’t quite sure why the troll has gotten under his skin, but he doesn’t see a logical reason to continue looking for things that will only make him angry. He doesn’t delete the comment, but he makes sure that it shows up as “read” so that John will be less likely to stumble onto it himself. He wants to be able to track it should he be given a reason to later on. He makes a mental note to check back in a day or two and see if this particular commenter returns.
John couldn’t help the whispered “Amazing” that escaped his lips. Sherlock gives him a brief, pleased smile.
“I was in a rear-facing seat on the left side of the car. I woke up leaning against the window.  My face was cold. The woman was watching me, though she looked down at the magazine in her hands as soon as she realized I was awake.  She gave me the orange about a half hour later, and she didn’t say anything else until we stopped in Waterloo. She told me that was my stop. I must have looked confused, because then she told me to check my pockets when I was in the station. Then she got up and walked away.”
Sherlock raises his arm to shield his face as he imagines she did, running through every possible scenario   John continues cataloging her injuries.
“Lestrade texted, inviting us round to the pub. I’d normally decline, but I thought a celebration might be in order. What do you say?” Sherlock stood and smiled, reaching for his scarf on the desk.
Mycroft lets go of her hand and leaves the room, closing the door noiselessly behind him.   He nods at the nurse as he walks through the kitchen, and she quickly returns to her post at Katherine’s bedside.  He enters the lounge.
“I’ve never given any thought to working on a book, but I do like the idea of you not working at the clinic anymore. I suppose I could help out a when I don’t have a case going. Are you sure that this is what you want to do? I thought you actually enjoyed being a doctor.”
“I don’t know, and I don’t like not knowing.”  John could see Sherlock’s mind working. “She’s in trouble. She’s heartbroken, too.”
She turns away as she hears Sherlock come back up the stairs, followed by another visitor. Sherlock looks at John and shakes his head, quieting the comment that had been on his flatmate’s lips. Mycroft hovers in the doorway, looking at back of Katherine’s head. He starts to speak, but can’t seem to decide on an appropriate greeting.  John looks from Mycroft to Katherine and back again, trying to get a handle on the situation.  Mycroft appears almost nervous.
Sherlock wraps his scarf around his neck, and the two brothers make their way down the stairs, to Baker Street.
“I’m sure she thought she knew enough. If she thought he was hiding something, then she must have assumed he had a good reason. And for his sake, he better hope that’s the case.”  Mycroft sits at this desk and begins typing, putting his vast network of resources to work.
Soon, all elements of the cover story have been put in place and released to the media. Sherlock leaves Mycroft to see what sort of information he can pick up from the homeless network, and the elder Holmes allows himself a moment to deal with the troublesome emotions that he is so practiced at keeping in check. While he holds his head in his hands, elbows propped on his desk, he allows himself to imagine a different scenario for that summer evening so long ago, one that would have lead him down a different path. He could have been kinder in his refusal, more accepting of her suggestion that they keep in touch. He could have waited a few more years, encouraged her to return to England to attend university.
John noticed Sherlock had paused in his examination of the coat.  He looked at John, wondering what insight he could offer, knowing that it was precisely at moments like this one that John’s medical knowledge proved most useful.
“Have your agents check Eurostar for the last week, and take the search for airport arrivals back further, at least 7 months. We can’t assume that she came from America, and we can’t assume that it was recent.  John’s right. She wouldn’t have flown that far this late in her pregnancy. We have to assume she came into the country earlier or that she came in some other way.”
Mycroft turns to face Katherine, taking her other hand so that he now holds them both tightly in his own. He holds her gaze, and answers Sherlock’s question for her. “She trusted him to make the right decision. She trusted that he wouldn’t take such drastic measures without a good reason.”
“I suppose you’re right.”  Sherlock looks to the doorway, where John is standing, a questioning look on his face.  Sherlock shakes his head, and John makes his way down the hall to the bathroom, leaving the two friends to continue their conversation.  “Why were you crying? I had never seen you do that before.”
“Get Mrs. Hudson in here to help me. Call Molly. I need another set of trained hands.” He turns to his patient, noting that the spotting he noticed initially has turned to steady stream of blood. “Towels, Sherlock. Gauze. Have to stop the bleeding before it gets out of control.”
“You mean that I wouldn’t leave either of you alone, so you both eventually gave up and tolerated me.”
John had been in the middle of a very patient response to a comment on “The Proof is in the Paint.” The respondent was questioning the particular chain of reasoning that Sherlock had used to deduce that the callus on trigger finger of the victim had come from endless hours of playing paintball and not from firing a gun that shot actual bullets. John had been very politely explaining the different materials used in the manufacture of the paintball gun. Sherlock, however, couldn’t believe that anyone had needed to ask a question with such an obvious answer. He wanted to delete John’s patient (and very thorough) explanation and call the woman out for her idiocy, but, instead, he finished the sentence that John had been writing and posted the comment. He then quickly signed in under his own name because he couldn’t resist adding his own little postscript - “Obviously.”
John thought back on times when he’d gotten texts from Mycroft telling him information that he needed to know at just the moment he needed to know it, or when help had arrived at just the right time. He supposed he’d gotten use to Mycroft’s presence, though he was still annoyed by the way he’d just show up unexpectedly or send a car to summon him.
“At first, he was adamant that he wanted nothing to do with them. But, as the pregnancy progressed, he began to talk about home and all the wonderful and beautiful things about Colombia that he hoped to one day show to his child. One afternoon, he said he was going for a walk. He was gone for hours, and when he returned, he was...resigned. He said he had called his brother, they had a falling out, and he was prepared to do whatever was necessary. He wouldn’t explain beyond that. I didn’t know what his goal was. I wasn’t feeling well, so I went to bed early. He never came to bed that night. He woke me up before dawn to say goodbye.  He said that he was going to try to change his brother’s mind. There was a folder on the table with maps, timetables, reservation information. He told me to go back to sleep for a few hours, that a car would be there to pick me up at 10. My bags were packed. I just needed to follow the schedule.”
Sherlock helped him put his robe on, and went ahead of him down the stairs, ready to catch him if he stumbled. John found his way to the toilet while Sherlock put on the kettle. He came back down the hall, wondering aloud about the contents of the bucket in the shower, and stretched out on the couch. Sherlock launched into a description of his current experiment while he made the tea and was explaining that the kitchen sink was too small, hence the bucket. When he brought John his tea a moment later, he found that John had fallen asleep again. Sherlock left the tea on the coffee table, fetched a glass of water to place beside it, and covered John with the afghan from the back of the sofa.
Sherlock goes to sit in his chair, and John, his exhaustion finally catching up with him, falls down in his own, leaning back and resting his eyes.
"She breathes too loudly. I couldn't sleep anymore." She sinks back in the chair, trying to get comfortable. "I don't suppose you have something I could prop my feet on, do you?"
Sherlock shook his head. Then, remembering his experiment, he turned to go down the hall and check on the contents of that bucket.
“There was a bit of orange pith under her nails, too. Probably breakfast”  He picks up the packet of pain relievers. “This wouldn’t have done much to ease her pain. I’m truly amazed that she managed to sit here and have a normal conversation with us for as long as she did. It had to have been the adrenaline that carried her that long.”
“Right.  I wasn’t the only tag-along in the group. There was a Colombian man there, too.  His name was Ricardo. We were both keeping to the back of the group, trying not to stand out too much.  We were both missing the little pins that marked us as paying customers and hoping it would go unnoticed.  It didn’t.  We were chased away by a little old lady, making a big deal of the fact that we were ruining experience for all the paying customers. We ended up in a cafe, laughed over coffee and dessert, exchanged cell numbers, and said goodnight. In a few months, we were married, and we had both decided to stay in Barcelona for a while.”
He had brought John a bowl of the soup that Mrs. Hudson had left simmering on the stove late that morning. John had eaten a few bites and finished most of the glass of water before falling back to sleep. Sherlock took the still open laptop from John’s lap, and sat down at the desk with it. He could have gone downstairs, but he wanted to be stay close by in case John needed something.
“You think that she flew from America into London 3 weeks ago, when she was more than 7 months pregnant? I wouldn’t recommend such a long journey that far along in the pregnancy.  Most airlines wouldn’t have been comfortable with it either, though I supposed its possible.  Do we even know for sure that she came straight from America? Or even what her name is now?”
“Once we were able to accurately identify him, we were able to retrace his steps during his time in Europe. The path he set his wife on was the reverse of his own. In each town, she stayed with a close friend of his from when he had lived there. She had access to medical care, money, security. Whatever she needed. Each host made the arrangements for the next stop on the journey. He had expected her to stay in Brussels for the rest of her pregnancy, but she said she would feel more comfortable in England. According to her host, a Virginie Renier, Catherine slipped away four days ago, when she said she was going to take a nap after lunch. She left a note thanking her for her kindness, but said she’d spent enough time with strangers. She wanted something familiar. We are unable to verify anything after that.”
Sherlock can see that she will not be going any further with her explanation.  He looks up at John entering the room, medical kit in hand, ready to check on his patient.  He gets up from his chair, and goes over to where his violin rests in its case.  As John sits with Katherine, examining her and asking the questions that he could not the night before, Sherlock softly plays a song that he remembers as one of her favorites.  He hopes that it will make up for his probing questions.  He shouldn’t have pressed the issue, but he has a tendency to get carried away when presented with a mystery. He clears his mind of all but the music and Katherine’s current situation.
He can see that the hasty sutures have torn, and it looks as though the child was taken by force. The car accident likely initiated labor, and instead of trying to delay it, they forced it. No doubt she was drugged.
“Katherine, how long ago did you give birth? Can you tell me where the baby is? Katherine?”  She sobs, trying to catch her breath.
John considers this for a moment. “She’s going to need a few hours rest to clear her head.  I’ll need the lab results back from Molly before I can say too much more. But she should be fine.”
“You were not useless then, and I am quite sure that you are not useless now.”  He came up behind the armchair and leaned over her shoulder to show her the few photographs he found in his room.
“Yes. My mother and I moved to England to live with my grandparents when I was 12.  They were not well, and she wanted to be close so she could take care of them.  We lived near the Holmes family, and I was in school with Sherlock. Mycroft would make an appearance at the holidays and in the summer. None of us could really tolerate any of our neighbors or classmates, so, more often than not, we ended up together. And that’s how it was for four years. Then, my grandparents died, and my mother accepted a new job in the states, and we moved back. I haven’t seen or heard from either of them since that summer.”
“I know. To have an adoring teenage girl completely in awe of your intellectual prowess and worshipping the very ground you both walked on had to have been so trying. How ever did you cope?”
John finishes his call. “After seeing that toxicology report, I’m surprised she was able to remember anything at all about the last week.”
“The real problem, however, is the damage that was done during the delivery. If I had to guess what happened, I’d say that the trauma of the accident initiated labor and they, whoever they are, took advantage of that fact to all but rip the child from her womb. I’m surprised she didn’t bleed out on the spot. “
“You were in school together, then?” John asks, trying to cover for the abrupt departure of his flatmate.
Katherine wakes slowly. She’s hears the sounds of the monitors first, and she tenses, afraid that they have taken her to a hospital.  She tries to stay calm, easing her eyes open to take in the scene around her. She relaxes immediately when she sees the man in the chair next to the bed, reading a file from the stack on his lap. She says nothing, taking a moment to look him over, noticing all of the ways he has changed since she last saw him, twenty years before.
“I was pregnant.  I knew I was. When I woke up, they told me I had been in an accident, that I was confused. There had never been a baby. But I KNEW there was. I KNEW IT.”  A wave of pain causes her to yell out, and John starts barking orders.
“How likely is that the child survived the delivery?” Mycroft’s tone is all business, but John can see the worry in his eyes.
“Sherlock, can you help me with her coat and take her pressure?” His flatmate has already slid the cuff up Katherine's arm.
Katherine shifts in the bed, trying to sit up. She looks at the glass of water sitting on the bedside table, and, without a word, Mycroft hands it to her. After taking several small sips, she hands him the glass and sits back against the pillows.
John returned to the lounge with the tea tray, passing identical cups of tea to both Sherlock and his guest, before taking a seat at the table and taking a sip from his own.
Sherlock, without John having to ask, makes himself comfortable on the couch. He spends some time in his mind palace, but, eventually, he too lets sleep take him.  When he wakes up a few hours later, he finds Katherine hobbling into the lounge, propped up on the IV pole and arguing with the nurse that is trying in vain to make her return to her bed. Katherine finds her way to John's chair and sits down gingerly.  Sherlock nods at the nurse, subtly gesturing at the stairs leading to John's room.
“No. I threw it away.  As soon as I saw it, I knew I would be safe. I knew you both would help me. I also knew that it could connect me to you, and I didn’t want to give them, whoever they are, a trail to follow. So I tore it up and threw it in a bin.”
“It helped that you were willing to aid me in my efforts to terrorize my brother. You were always the willing accomplice.”
“Oh, I know I didn’t.  And you didn’t break mine.  We were partners in crime, so to speak. But that was all.”
“Yes. And maybe you could help me downstairs? I think it might be good to walk around a bit, get out of this bed.”
Katherine stands up, turns around, and walks over to Mycroft. She looks up at him for just a moment before she throws her arms around him and begins to cry.  Mycroft hesitates just a moment before he raises his arms and returns her embrace. With that, her crying becomes full out sobbing. He tightens his embrace, and he lets her cry.
Mycroft could have done a lot of things differently, but he did not allow himself to feel regret. He had done the right thing, and he would not hesitate to do it again, though he would endeavor to be less abrasive in his approach.
Mycroft helps her to readjust the covers, and he smoothes the hair back from her face.  He smiles down at her.
Sherlock looks behind his flatmate at the woman coming up the last few stairs. Sherlock steps aside so John can pass, then waits for her to raise her head and meet his gaze.
John is on his mobile, listening intently to the voice on the other end while reading over reports on his laptop.  Sherlock looks up from his laptop when he notices his older brother enter the room.
John raced through the door into the kitchen, expecting to find Sherlock sitting behind his microscope, examining the tissue slides from the bucket experiment. But he wasn’t there.
“Immigration records for the last three months show that Katherine Moffat arrived in Heathrow nearly 3 weeks ago. We can’t be sure that it was her, but Moffat was her mother’s maiden name.  That Katherine Moffat then rented a car.   We’re watching police reports, but so far the car has not been reported abandoned or involved in an accident.”  Mycroft paused, pulling his phone from his pocket and stepping out on the landing.
Sherlock has come into the room, putting John’s bag on the coffee table, and he kneels down nearby, ready to assist his flatmate as needed.  Mycroft is doing what he does best, texting away on his phone, making things happen, resources available in the way that only he can.   “Just tell me what you need, John.”
“I’m sure you’re right, brother dear.” Sherlock places a hand gently on Mycroft’s shoulder, subtly nodding at the door. Mycroft stands, pulling his phone from his pocket.
“Terrorize Mycroft? Well, you’re right in my book.” John is enjoying the mischievous gleam in Sherlock’s eyes as he reminisces.
“From what Dr. Watson says, that doesn’t sound too far from the truth. He says that you need time to rest, but that you will, most likely, make a full recovery.” Mycroft takes raises his other hand to brush a curl back on her forehead.
He sighs and sits back in his chair. He looks less like the worried friend and more like the minor government official that he is.  It is only the fact that he still holds her hand in his that betrays the more human side to Mycroft Holmes.
“Please.” She steps past him, into the lounge, and Sherlock silently pulls his mobile from his pocket and sends a short text.  She stands there, taking in the surroundings.
He is still playing when Mycroft arrives an hour later.  Katherine is still in the chair, and John is fussing in the kitchen, putting together a light breakfast for his patient.  Mrs. Hudson has been up to see if they need anything from the shops, and John’s sent her off with a list.  It is at the site of his older brother in the doorway that Katherine’s explanation for her tears finally makes sense.
“You could go and answer it, Sherlock.” But he is already out the door and down the stairs.  Sherlock raises his head as he listens to John and their visitor coming up the stairs. There is something familiar about the sound of the woman’s voice as she laughs. Her gait is familiar, too, though her step is heavier than it once had been.  He pops up from the table and is waiting for them at the door.
She’s making a special effort to avoid meeting his gaze for the moment. She’s nervous. He knows that something is wrong, or she would not be here. He also knows that she’s not ready to talk about it. She’ll want to wait for Mycroft and avoid telling her story twice.  Now, she’ll want to reminisce and laugh. The flat could do with a bit of laughter after a difficult few days, so he’ll indulge her.
Mycroft walks into inform him that the requested items, including a nurse that can be trusted are en route. He steps right back out to grab the towels, while Sherlock tells him where to find the gauze. John is focused entirely on his patient.
Mycroft nods and looks down at his phone.  Having a new avenue of inquiry to pursue has caused some of the tension to leave his shoulders.  Sherlock places the coat carefully on the sofa, and turns to look back over the contents of Katherine’s pockets, strewn on the desk.  John goes over to stand at his side, looking over the items for the first time.  He sees the taxi receipt, a few crumpled notes, a few packets of an over-the-counter pain reliever, a sanitary napkin, and a packet of crisps.  There was a bit of an orange peel, too.
“It seems that she had a Spanish passport issued just before she began traveling, which is odd since neither she nor Ricardo were Spanish citizens. She retained her British citizenship. His passport, on the other hand, was issued by the Colombian government to a Ricardo Rojas de Restrepo. Other than the passport, however, he does not appear to exist.” Mycroft looks down at her, his left eyebrow slightly raised, and she stands to the side, already with phone in hand, texting questions to her counterpart in the Colombian government.
John entered at Sherlock’s offended tone and cocked his head to the side in question. Sherlock had taken off his coat and draped it over one of the chairs at the kitchen table and was perched on the counter, ankles crossed. He shook his head at John with an exasperated expression before returning to his conversation.
Maybe it would be a good thing. If he couldn't think, he couldn't remember, and if that meant a migraine then so be it. Sherlock would give anything to never have to think again.
“Softer, Sherlock. Remember, you can’t let him know he is in any kind of danger” Eurus reprimanded, her voice an odd mixture of warning and amused.
The smile dropped from Sherlock’s face as the memories of the other night returned with a vengeance and John’s heart rose to his throat, immediately regretting his words. He was about to apologise when Sherlock beat him to it, "Well…I doubt we would have on our own…"
Sherlock struggled to take back control over his voice, wiping his eyes and nose on the back of his sleeve as he tried to breath through the hiccups he choked up. John just gently rubbed Sherlock's shoulder, cupping the man's face with his free hand and whispering soft encouragements.
"Mmm…how about we go together?" John mumbled into Sherlock’s shirt and searched blindly for the hand that kept swatting at him.
The pathologist’s face lit up with a grin and she squeezed John’s hand, "Really? That’s amazing, John! Holy shit!"
"It was one of the most idiotic things I’ve ever done and I knew it the second I heard you at my grave"
"Yeah…" John said vaguely and found himself shuffling closer to his best friend. Rosie, momentarily distracted from Sherlock’s curls, gave John a gummy smile and reached for him with grabby hands. He let her grab onto his hand and play with his fingers for a while, enraptured by her tiny giggles and curiosity about the difference in their hand sizes. He hadn’t realised how stiff Sherlock had become until their shoulders bumped and John noticed their proximity, "Oh- sorry, am I-"
"What are you two giggling about?" Sherlock asked when he entered, looking slightly ridiculous in one of John’s dressing gowns and with a baby batting at his chin. Rosie was cradled close to his chest and John almost forgot about all that had taken place yesterday at the sight of them both.
Sherlock nodded and ducked back out, heading to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his face. There was always a spare toothbrush in the bathroom and Sherlock would’ve assumed it was Mary’s if he couldn’t deduce the entirety of it’s use at a glance. He was the only one who had ever used it.
“You didn’t win, you lost” Eurus continued to jibe and Sherlock just wanted her to shut up, “Look what you did to him. He doesn’t even know you meant it; he thinks this was all some silly little experiment to play with his emotions”
"Thanks, Greg" Sherlock said over his shoulder, not turning to gouge the DI’s reaction, but he knew that he must be smiling.
A simple golden plaque screwed into the light coloured wood glimmered in the dim lighting, engraved with only three words;
Something about John’s presence around him broke the rest of the dam that had been blocking all of Sherlock’s pent up and repressed emotions. He wrapped his arms around John let out a shuddering sob, quiet but definitely there, and held him closer. "I’m sorry" He mumbled into the doctor’s shoulder, unable to stop the oncoming waves of tears, "I’m so sorry, John"
"Sherlock?" John's voice filled the room through the large sound system and an inch of relief cleared a small space in Sherlock's cluttered mind. He picked up, he could do this, it was going to be okay.
Sherlock sneered a little at that, but he softened and nodded once. John beamed and caught Sherlock’s eye, eliciting that shy smile that was reserved only for those closest to the detective.
John chewed on the inside of his cheek, arms folding across his chest as he leaned back against the kitchen counter. Rosie was brushing her tiny fingers through Sherlock’s wayward and fuzzy curls in his peripheral, however, he didn’t turn to look at them, knowing that if he did he may lose his nerve.
I don’t think I’ll post before New Years (literally tomorrow where the hell does the time go!?) so in case I don’t emerge from my tiny fanfic hole, have a great New Year, stay safe and let’s hope for a better year <3
When the formula was finally ready, John half ran into the living room and took his still flailing daughter from a very frazzled looking Sherlock. It took a couple of tries to get Rosie to drink it, but she eventually latched on and drank sulkily. "There you go, see? No need for all that fuss" John said, swaying a little and smiling down at her still red face.
“Why?” John asked, his own voice beginning to shake as he leaned forward, hooking an arm under his legs to hold them close to his chest, “Why are you doing this, Sherlock? I can’t. You know I can’t” John said, shifting again to plant his feet on the carpet, feet sinking into the soft fabric as he rested his elbows on his knees.
"Yeah, Molly, go get ready for your date and we’ll be fine here. I promise one of us will call if we ever need your help" John chimed in before Molly’s flush spread further than her cheeks. The pathologist sighed but nodded and kissed the top of Rosie’s head before disappearing from the kitchen to get dressed.
"In the unlikely event that something does happen, we will call," Sherlock said, he’d risen from his chair and gently squeezed Molly’s shoulder as he passed on his way to the sink.
Rosie, intrigued by the noise, watched the children and their dog as they passed, watching as they disappeared momentarily before reappearing a couple of meters from where she lost sight of them.
Eurus considered the detective with an expression close to pity, "Saved him? You think you saved him?" She asked and Mycroft bowed his head, already having predicted what his sister would say. "There were no bombs in John's house"
"What did you-...bring him back! Call him back! Now! I won, I saved him, you have to let me speak to him!" Sherlock cried, stepping away to pace the length of the room, his steps clumsy and not as measured as they typically were.
John froze. He was still for a long moment in which Sherlock kept glancing, anxiously, at the timer, until he raised his other hand to also hold the phone and press it closer to his ear, “Again…say it again” he breathed, and Sherlock obliged quickly.
John simply nodded before continuing, "So he got me to say it and…well he found out that it was true…" Molly nodded encouragingly, reaching out to rest her hand over his, " and…he feels the same"
"When you’re exhausted, but when you finally get into bed you can’t sleep" Sherlock answered, nuzzling into the pillow and opening his eyes again to meet John’s gaze. The moonlight filtered through the gossamer curtains and provided a soft blue light to illuminate the room. It was warming up considerably now that they were both in bed and the chirps of crickets from the neighbours overgrown garden filled the gentle silence.
"Let’s head over then before this one gets too cold," John said, and they walked down the street with Sherlock leading the way
John let out a long dramatic groan and let go of his newfound lover, "Fine, but you can’t bail the next time she starts screaming"  he said as Sherlock scrambled to the other side of the bed, sniggering.
"What- Oh!" John exclaimed as Sherlock tugged him down and kissed him fiercely for a brief moment before pulling away and grinning impishly up at him.
"Well, at least now you can say Mycroft got something wrong," John said lightly, and the tiny chuckle from Sherlock alleviated some of the tension. When his laughter started tapering away, he looked over at John and they stared at one another for a moment until one of them snorted and they both dissolved into delirious giggles.
Taking one last look at her, John silently left the room and peeked into his own bedroom. Sherlock was already fast asleep, his breaths deep and even and his face clear of strife. John was careful when he slipped into the other side of the bed and clicked off the lamp, plunging the room into near darkness. The moonlight outside gleamed through the gossamer curtains and he closed his eyes against the gentle glow. The exhaustion that had hovered over his head all night finally came forward and he dozed off with the comforting sound of Sherlock’s steady breaths beside him.
The bed was a little cool and Sherlock shuddered, curling into a ball and wrapping the duvet tighter around him after tucking the borrowed jumper under the pillow. John appeared a while later and settled in the bed beside him before clicking off the bedside lamp.
Sherlock glanced at his brother, who looked less confused than he would've liked. Though he would never admit it out loud, Sherlock found that Mycroft did often prove himself to be the smarter brother to a certain degree and it drove him up the wall in frustration whenever the eldest would withhold information until Sherlock had figured it out for himself. Inconvenient, he had said, to which his brother simply smiled condescendingly and handed him a file.
"BECAUSE IT'S TRUE!" John snapped, rocking forward and dragging a hand across his face, coming to cover his mouth while his eyes went shiny with unshed tears.
Eurus sat back in her chair, as if preparing to watch a tv show and Sherlock rounded the coffin the stand at the head, huffing out a short sigh. He glanced over at his brother from across the coffin and their eyes met for a shot moment, though it was long enough for them to know what the other was thinking.
"Oh god, I was so worried" He breathed, sinking to his knees and pulling Sherlock down with him, heedless of the wet grass and the water seeping through their clothes, "You have no idea, Sherlock, I swear, I thought I was dying."
As he sat in the driver’s seat, Sherlock spoke up, "Thank you" He murmured, just above a whisper and John glanced over at him. He looked back with an almost blank face and you wouldn’t have thought he had been bawling his eyes out just moments before if it weren’t for his red rimmed eyes and dried tear tracks still staining his cheeks. John wanted to gently wipe all traces of Sherlock’s sorrow from his face and push his mess of curls from his forehead so that he could kiss it, if only to see that small flicker of a smile. Instead, he just smiled at the detective.
The timer stopped at 0:03, and both Sherlock and Mycroft breathed sighs of relief, tension melting from their shoulders like ice and Sherlock took a step closer to the screen, a tentative, tiny smile tugging on his lips.
Slightly surprised at the language, John smiled back, "Yeah, it just…it wasn’t the best circumstance, y’know?" He said and Molly seemed to sober slightly, her smile slipping off her face a little.
"Final thirty seconds" Eurus said, her voice like nails on a chalkboard to Sherlock's heavy and foggy mind.
"Hey...hey now, it's okay" John soothed, brushing away the tears dropping from Sherlock's face in vain as more poured from his reddening eyes, "You're safe now, alright? I'm here. I'm here and I always will be, I promise"
"C'mon, Sherl, let's get you home, yeah?" John said, smiling when Sherlock nodded and he helped him to his feet, steadying him when he stumbled, "Easy now, you've had a rough night. I'll get Lestrade to give us a lift home and we can just go to bed, how does that sound?"
John was quiet for a moment, chewing on his fingernails as he held the phone closer. He looked like his was mere inches from bursting into tears, his face tight and jaw working as his grit his teeth, biting back the lump threatening to push those tears from his eyes.
He wasn’t sure for how long he sat there, staring at his clasped hands and trying not to think about anything that might make him sick, but at some point a familiar voice cut through the din.
“What do I-” Sherlock paused and turned to face the coffin lid, finding the inscribed plaque winking derisively back at him in the dim light. “Oh…”
"Yes, I think so. There’s a nice one nearby and I’m sure Watson would appreciate the warmth" Sherlock said and reached over to gently stroke Rosie’s cheek with the back of a finger. She whined and swatted blindly at the retreating hand as both men chuckled.
"Oh, that" Sherlock cleared his throat, "My father wanted to speak with you, probably just making you promise to look after me or some such nonsense" he waved a hand dismissively, "And tomorrow we’re meeting at Mycroft’s office to talk things out. I’ve no idea how they managed to get him to agree to it but…" he trailed off with a shrug and tucked the mug away into a cupboard.
“Yes, but it’s me calling” Sherlock retorted, turning his head slightly to address his brother and catching sight of his pale face and twitching hand. He turned back quickly when the phone went to voicemail and his heart sank. He dragged his hand across his face and repositioned himself in front of the tv as Eurus spoke up again.
“Yes, yes, yes, and this, I presume, will be their coffin?” Sherlock interrupted, indicating the coffin with the barrel of his gun. He couldn’t stand the mock sadness in his sister’s voice and the carelessness with which she spoke of someone being killed, someone (Sherlock could assume) close to him. Eurus didn’t need to tell him she had killed before for him to know.
"Fine" He sighed dramatically and slid off of the counter, "How about Chinese for dinner?" He said over his shoulder on the way to the living room, pausing to turn at the door. The light from the living room window glowed from behind Sherlock, outlining him in gold in the same way it had that morning, only it was warmer and Sherlock was smiling slightly as he looked back at John.
But it couldn’t be. John had been adamant, from the very start, that he was not interested in men. ‘Not gay’ might has well have been written on his forehead in permanent marker from all the times he’d said it. He had even married a woman, Mary, for god’s sake. He could not love Sherlock. Even if he matched perfectly with the description of whoever the coffin was for, even if Sherlock could sometimes feel lingering glances on the back of his neck and if John sometimes gripped his elbow for a little longer than necessary or moved to touch him before aborting at the last minute. Sherlock could explain it all away as platonic. A way to reassure John that Sherlock was still alive and well after everything that has happened.
"If she continues to be around you, then far too smart for her own good" John teased, though Sherlock’s face fell slightly and his gaze snapped to John’s.
“Oh, do be sensible, there were no explosives in his little house” Eurus continued, her voice growing quickly irritable like she was speaking to a petulant child and not her older brother, “Why would I be so clumsy?”
"No, not really, she can have a little bit of juice and water, but never too often" John answered, trying to coax Rosie back to sleep before she started having a fit over being denied the food on the table. Sherlock hummed sympathetically and picked up one of the sugar packets haphazardly dumped in a pile on the tray.
Steeling himself, John shuffled even closer - realisation flickered in Sherlock’s pale eyes - and kissed Sherlock.
As he walked through the crime scene, Sherlock briefly slipped into his Mind Palace and swiftly navigating the clearing halls to his ‘John Wing’. It was mostly in tact with a few files strewn across some of the rooms and the John that lived in his head was not present; probably surveying the damage. There was a room he hadn’t seen before, one that was bare with just a table in the middle that had a note atop it’s surface. Upon closer inspection, Sherlock realised that room’s purpose with the three words on the slip of paper.
"I…saved you to the trouble of having an unnecessarily long conversation with my father" His voice was only slightly uncertain and John raised an eyebrow, scrutinising him before letting it slide with a shrug.
When he was done, he headed downstairs after poking his head into Rosie’s room, finding her, surprisingly, still asleep, and entered the kitchen. Molly was already in there, making tea with her hair loose around her shoulders, "Good morning" she said as he sat down at the table.
"What do I-...." His eyes trailed to the coffin lid, golden plaque winking derisively at him, "...Oh..." his heart plummeted, crashing to the floor and breaking into thousands of tiny pieces. No...not that, anything but that.
A shadow darkened John’s features as his jaw tightened and he began to pick at a loose thread on the woollen blanket draped over the back of the sofa, his hand shaking. He sighed irritably, “You’re a right bastard, you know that?” He said, voice dangerously low has he viciously tugged the thread from the blanket, looping it around his trembling fingers and tying small, tight knots, “I’m gonna go, call when you-”
“I love you, so much, Sherlock” John repeated and Sherlock looked back up at the tv screen, a tiny, involuntary smile tugging at his lips in spite of the situation. It was like everything had stopped to accommodate for this little moment between the detective and his doctor, like they were standing right in front of each other, reading each other’s emotions through their silences.
"I think she’ll want a nap after this" Sherlock piped up, his voice a lot closer than John expected, and reached forward to carefully wipe a tiny tear that lingered on Rosie’s cheek. Normally she would have already had her nap that day, but what with the outing and losing track of time, she’d missed it and now she wouldn’t sleep until later that night. Missed naps also often meant a long night of screaming and little to no sleep for everyone in the house. However, if she was on the verge of throwing another fit, John was willing to risk the sleep deprivation to avoid that.
"He really is fond of her, isn’t he?" Molly said when Sherlock’s soothing murmurs turned into a quiet lullaby and Rosie started to giggle instead of cry.
The lights were too bright and made his already painful headache progress towards migraine territory, combine that with the consistent radio chatter and clamour of voices and Sherlock is well on his way to mind numbing pain.
The Woman came to mind first, what with her bold forwardness, flirty texts and general love for the thrill that Sherlock seemed to ignite into the world. Though, that was impossible; she was halfway across the world by now, doing only God knows what with her time. She was out of the question.
They finished their goodbyes and John ended their call, "I think it’s time for bed, you" he said to Rosie, who blinked blearily up at him when he came over to pick her up.
Sherlock nodded stiffly and, no sooner than he had, the monotonous dial up sound of the phone, accompanied by Moriarty imitating the ticking of a clock, filled the cell. He could hear the ringtone John had given specifically to his contact through the tv speakers and watched as his friend stirred from his position on the sofa. He made no move to reach for his phone that continued to ring on the coffee table, instead he settled further into the pillows, holding his daughter closer.
It took him a moment to notice Sherlock, but when he did they both froze. They stared at each other for what felt like an eternity, cataloging each other's faces and posture like it was the last time they'd ever see one another. It felt impossible, both unwilling to be too hopeful and think they weren't staring at a mirage, a harmless figment of their imaginations brought on by fear and the single wish for the other to please be alive.
"Christ, Sherlock, I was so worried" He breathed, lifting a hand to gently card his fingers through Sherlock’s tangled curls, carefully pulling out knots as he tried to calm his breathing.
"N-No, no, it's not that it's uhm...I just need you to repeat these words exactly" Sherlock said, fighting to keep the fear and panic from his voice as John came back into view on the cameras, rounding the sofa and curling up in one corner.
Something hot and angry flared in John’s chest and he fought to keep his voice neutral, "If you knew then, why didn’t you say anything?" He retracted his hand from Sherlock’s back and tried to keep himself calm. He wasn’t entirely sure why he was reacting so strongly, but he thought it better to focus on keeping it at bay and analyse it later.
“Sherlock? Is something wrong?” John’s voice was soft and tired and the creaking of the stairs could be heard in the background.
As he was pulling his clothes on, John noticed Sherlock’s coat hung up on the back of the door and grabbed it on his way out of the room. It was nearing May, which meant sunny days were becoming increasingly common, however, what with it being England, it never guaranteed a warm day. It was unlikely that Sherlock would care and John didn’t want him to catch a cold on top of whatever revelations he’d had last night that he still hadn’t told John about.
The tv screen burst into life and the slightly unsaturated image of their sister, Eurus, filled it. She looked delighted, her hands pressed together, palm to palm, in front of her face in a parody of Sherlock’s thinking pose. Her smile didn’t quite reach her sunken eyes despite the thinly veiled glee that swirled in their depths.
Sherlock appeared after a while with a tray of their food that he gripped tightly as he cautiously weaved through the different tables and towards John. Rosie stirred when the smell of freshly baked pastry wafted in her direction and she cracked open her eyes. John chuckled, "Of course now she’s awake," he said, adjusting his daughter more comfortably and waking her up even more.
Sherlock nodded carefully and tucked his blanket tighter around his shoulders, vaguely surprised at the (albeit minimal) comfort it provided. He’d never thought he’d be grateful for a shock blanket, but here he was. "Is Mycroft okay?" He asked after a moment and watched the DI’s face shift into a small smile.
"What was that about then?" John asked, rinsing out the mugs and bottles that had accumulated in the sink.
“Oh!” Eurus suddenly piped up again and Sherlock grit his teeth against the voice he was quickly growing to despise, “One important restriction; you are not allowed to mention, in any way, that his life is in danger. You may not, at any point, suggest that there is any form of crisis. If you do, I will end this session and his life. Are we clear?”
John shook his head despite thinking they couldn’t see him, his face was crumpled as though he was in pain and his bottom lip trembled minutely. “I c-…” His voice cracked and he took a deep, trembling breath before he tried again, “I can’t… I’m sorry”
“You never answer your phone” Mycroft from behind him, his eyes were also fixated on the screen and his hand was pressed under his chin. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, struggling under the thick tension that hung in the room.
"Because…" Sherlock swallowed and began wrapped and unwrapping the tie on the dressing gown around his hand. "Because I was scared"
John looked up at him in confusion, brow furrowed, "Why not?" He asked, keeping a steadying hand on his friend’s elbow. Sherlock’s jaw tightened and he kept his gaze turned away from John.
He glanced at the camera where he knew Eurus was watching him and answered quickly, “No, no, it’s nothing like that I just-… I need you to repeat these words exactly” He replied, wrangling his voice into some semblance of calm as he watched John return to the living room. He noted the very slow, reluctant tread as his friend rounded the sofa and dropped back onto the fluffy cushions, curling up in a corner and wrapping his free arm around himself. Was he cold? Why was he cold? His home almost always seemed to be warmer than Baker Street. Sherlock shook his head to clear it. He was getting off topic.
John’s lips twitched at the image of Sherlock watching his brother get chewed out by their parents with amusement and knew the younger Holmes would wait a while before saving Mycroft from their wrath. "What time do you have to be there?" He asked, unable to keep the hint of laughter from his voice and Sherlock grinned.
"Mornin’" he mumbled back, raking a hand through his hair and grimacing when his fingers caught on knots, "How’d you sleep?"
“Look, I’m not having a very good day, Sherlock, I’m not coming all the way over to Baker Street just so that you can use my phone.” He said and Sherlock felt irritation bloom in his chest. Whether it was at John’s lack of cooperation or his own actions for making people assume he only ever called to ask for favours, he wasn’t sure.
Sherlock's breathing grew sharp, panicked, and he glanced at Mycroft, who's face had gone ashen and ghostly, "Rosie...you can't-....she's a child" The detective choked out, his hands gripping the rim of the coffin so hard his knuckles began going white.
Sherlock's brow furrowed and he took another moment to empty his mind of intrusive thoughts - what ifs and his taking John for credit - before he spoke again, "No I...why can't y-"
"Victor Trevor" The detective’s wavered on the boy’s name and John’s heart sank to his feet, his whole body going cold as he sagged back in his chair, a contrast to Sherlock’s stiff muscles and straight back.
“He will be here as soon as he can. He had a few things to attend to.”  Sherlock sits down on the edge of his chair, looking across at his friend and thinking back to the last time they saw each other.
Sherlock considers John’s insight. “I don’t know. She wouldn’t have taken the risk to travel such a great distance being that far along unless it were necessary. She’s always been a terribly practical person.”
Mycroft looks up from the text he was typing out. “John, Katherine is a fighter.  As are you. You’re well-suited to the challenge of caring for her. I have the utmost confidence in your abilities.”
The brothers turn to look at the map, both working to trace Katherine’s route from Baker Street back to her origin.
Sherlock notes the slightly surprised tone to Mycroft’s voice when he relays that detail and is quick to respond, “Really, Mycroft. Given her attention to detail, you can’t be surprised that she would adopt the Catalan version of her name while engaging in a an in-depth study of the language and its evolution.”
John stared at him, narrowing his eyes in the way that Sherlock had come to know meant he was pretty sure he’d followed most of Sherlock’s reasoning, but that there were still a few gaps. He was waiting for Sherlock to fill them in.
Mycroft continues reading over the information that Anthea has provided, mentally retracing Catherine’s journey over the last few weeks. He wonders where her phone and laptop have disappeared to in all the confusion. He knows that she will not want to be away from her work for too long. It also occurs to him that the fact that the she would not have left herself unconnected may have been precisely what led her attackers to her.
“I seem that way now.” Katherine takes a sip of her tea. “You know, I hated drinking tea when I first moved here.  I didn’t like the way my mother or my grandparents took it. I accidentally grabbed Sherlock’s tea when we were working on homework at his house one afternoon, and that was it. Perfect. “
Mycroft comes over behind  the chair and places his hand on John’s shoulder.  “Thank you, John. For everything.”
Sorry to go so long between updates, but the real world has been a bit demanding as of late. My apologies.
-he was more than a little irritated. He was livid. Some “Anonymous” commenter was insulting Sherlock. That irked him, but it was only a brief comment. Insignificant, really, when compared to the attack targeted at John.
Sherlock laughs at that. “Mycroft doesn’t have friends, John. I’ve only had a few.  But Katherine made an impression on us both.”
“You have my undivided attention” says Sherlock as he raises his phone and starts texting someone. His lips are twitching into a grin, but he manages to keep it at bay.
“I am sure that he will.  Where is Mycroft? Will he be back soon?”  She is sitting with her eyes closed, looking as though the trip from his room to the lounge drained her of what little energy she had.
Mycroft steps away from the form on the sofa, giving John the room that he needs to work. John starts by opening her coat, realizing right away that she’s been putting up a brave front. He can see the bruises on her shoulder, and he knows that they came from a seat belt. “She’s been in a car accident. A bad one by the look of it.”
“She’s been here for nearly 3 hours. She arrived by taxi just after dark. She was picked up at Waterloo station, suggesting she arrived by train, so she wasn’t in London when this happened.”
“Were you happy there, with him?” Mycroft asks, just as Sherlock requests more information about Ricardo.  She smiles sadly, remembering what it had been like to be questioned by the two of them simultaneously, struggling to keep up with who had asked what and when.
Sherlock rises from the couch and retrieves John's step stool from the kitchen, placing it at Katherine’s feet and covering it with a cushion from the sofa.  He gently lifts her feet, then retrieves the afghan from the back of his chair and covers her with it.
"John, I-...." Sherlock sighed, his brain fizzing like static in a whirlwind of emotions and facts and thoughts, "If it's true than say it anyway"
"Will you two be alright with Rosie once I leave? I can always take her back to mine if she’ll be too much trouble" Molly offered lightly, coming closer to John to gently stroke Rosie’s blonde curls as she drank her formula. John knew she was giving them the chance to talk without interruption, but looking down into his daughter’s large blue eyes made the guilt that had already made a home in his stomach rear its head like a kind of sinister beast.
“Bring him back” Sherlock sneered, anger bubbling under his skin and singing through his veins like poison, “Call him back! I won, I did what you said and saved him, you have to let me speak to him” his voice had risen and he spun on his heel to pace the length of the room in an attempt to diffuse some of the pent-up energy he’d built up.
“Only, it isn’t a name” Mycroft said with a humourless smile, watching his brother’s shoulder’s sag in defeat as he turned away to return to the side of the coffin. “It must be for someone who loves you, brother dear. This is all about you, everything here”
"Mycroft told my parents about Eurus. They thought she died years ago and now they’re pissed beyond reason with him. Of course, he won’t answer the phone so they come to me" Sherlock explained, dropping from the counter and wordlessly coming to stand beside John to dry the mugs he’d washed.
“Because I-” even with the comforting knowledge that his feelings were reciprocated, Sherlock’s words still clogged in his throat and made it harder to breathe. He could feel them jumbling up again like so many times before and panicked slightly, “I-I-”
John sagged into the sofa, hoping to keep the conversation brief so that he could go back to his half-sleep, "Yeah, no, everything’s fine, wonderful even" he said, ignoring the snort from Sherlock and lightly kicking his leg. The detective yelped and jerked away while John went back to Molly, who had begun speaking again.
Sherlock and John exchanged a look and John shrugged. Rolling her eyes, Molly hugged them both before heading upstairs with a quiet goodnight to each of them.
"I also must say that you cannot, in any way, let John know that he is in danger, you must act as though everything is normal" Eurus was raising the remote again, presumably to call John, and Sherlock shared one last look with his brother before nodding once and peeling his fingers from the coffin to stand in front of the TV screen.
Sherlock swallowed the growing lump in his throat and tried to clear his mind, rid himself of his emotions for a while. To save John. To save Rosie. God, Rosie. She wasn't even a full year old yet...
"No, no, Sherlock," John interjected, "It’s fine, I promise. I don’t mind, I’m glad you opened up. It’ll help me help you"
"Sleep well?" John asked, rising from the table to dump the rest of his cold tea in the sink and retrieve Rosie’s bottle for Sherlock.
"....What?" Sherlock stared at the screen, at the man he knew he loved and the pain that coloured his face and plagued body language. He vaguely registered the sharp intake of breath behind him and Eurus' interested face out the corner of his eye.
Sherlock sagged in defeat, his grip on the gun loosening to the point where it was dangerously close to falling from his trembling hand. Mycroft sighed like the weight of the world had pressed itself onto his shoulders and he slowly moved to stand beside his brother. He didn’t touch Sherlock, he wouldn’t dare in the state his little brother had been worked into, he just stood close by; a comforting presence that, while he would never admit it, Sherlock appreciated.
John sighed heavily, “Give me a reason why. One valid reason, and I’ll say it” he said, moving so that he was now leaning back against the sofa cushions again while his leg continued to shake.
Molly’s eyes had slowly widened throughout John’s explanation and her hand slowly rose to cover her mouth seemingly of its own volition, "That’s awful"
Sherlock paused and drummed his fingers against the draining board, "No, I don’t think so" he said after a moment, his brow furrowed, "I reckon I’ll just be the buffer between them; stop things before they get too ugly"
Sherlock's heart rate picked up and he nodded, standing a little too quickly for his body's liking - the world turned on it's axis for a couple seconds and his head pounded painfully - but he wrapped his blanket tighter around himself before trudging off through the wet grass to find his companion.
“Final thirty seconds” Eurus said suddenly and Sherlock’s eyes once again darted to the timer still ticking down.
"Well, actually" Molly turned and handed John a mug of tea before going about making herself one. He thanked her quietly and took a sip, relishing in its familiar warmth and taste. Oddly enough, Molly was always the one who could make his tea properly and he could always count on her for a good cuppa. Lord knows Sherlock tries, but the only time he spends in the kitchen is to work on his experiments and is painfully inexperienced when it comes to food or drink.
The width. The coffin looked a little too wide for someone of Molly’s physique and he quickly dismissed the idea of it being meant for her.
He looked up into the face of Greg Lestrade and something eased in the weight on his chest. The familiarity of the DI’s face was a clarity in the foggy maze of his mind and he clung to it like a lifeline.
Molly bit her lip and tapped her nail against her mug, "Yeah he didn’t look great when you guys turned up…"
"Will do" Greg called after him, shoving his hands in his pockets and watching the detective trudge through the grass.
Warmth ran through John’s entire body and he couldn’t stop the sigh that escaped him when Sherlock’s hand moved to cup his face. His lips moved slowly against Sherlock’s, savouring the taste and feel of the detective’s lips against his. He pushed himself up a bit so that he was partially hovering over Sherlock and tentatively swiped his tongue across Sherlock’s bottom lip. Sherlock moaned and parted his lips immediately, fisting John’s shirt in his free hand. John briefly licked into Sherlock’s mouth before pulling back and sucking the detective’s bottom lip between his own, nipping gently and laughing when Sherlock nipped back irritably. He pulled back and kissed Sherlock’s cheek, then the other, then his forehead and the tip of his nose before pressing a chaste kiss to his lips that he chased when he pulled away again.
"Mum-…really I’m not…can y-…is Father there?…I want to speak with him" He cast his eyes up to the ceiling and whispered as an aside, "Because I can’t seem to get a word in edgeways with you" John snorted as he made his way to the sink. "Nothing, Mummy! Just please get Father"
Sherlock emerged from the bathroom looking a touch better than he had back at Musgrave and John tossed him the jumper, "That’s all I could find that might fit you, not sure about pants though" he said, not turning from his drawer as he did so. Sherlock huffed a tiny laugh before the soft whisper of fabric met John’s ears.
I’m feeling confident about finishing this but you never know, especially with my GCSEs just around the corner.
"Yes, yes, that's all well and good, brother mine, but we could just look at the name" Mycroft interrupted, and Sherlock looked up to find his brother standing by the lid, watching him expectantly as his cheeks warmed with mild embarrassment.
"No! Don't! Please, John, please, just say it!" Sherlock raised his voice, reaching out toward the screen as though John could see him, could see the panic swimming in his eyes and the tremors wracking his outstretched hand.
There was a single golden plaque screwed into the light-coloured wood with only three words engraved onto it;
Sherlock searched his face for a second, his eyes briefly darting down to his lips before locking onto John's gaze again. There was a short pause before Sherlock surged forwards and kissed John, grabbing onto the doctor's shoulders with an iron grip as he did so.
Sherlock stopped abruptly, fists clenching and unclenching, his shoulders tensing and curling slightly inward. No. No, no, no, no, no-
Anyway, updates will be irregular and will probs be even more so when school starts up again (if it does at all what with covid and the shoddy way it’s being dealt with over here in the England) so heads up for that!
He shuffled closer and Sherlock looked up from where he’d been staring at their hands again, expression questioning and painfully innocent. Far too innocent for a man like Sherlock. John’s eyes darted across the detective’s face, unsure of what he was about to do. He knew it was highly unlikely that Sherlock would not reciprocate, but even so, the little niggling fear in the back of his head refused to leave.
John was stupidly excited to spend the day with Sherlock. After Mary’s death and the events that followed, neither had had the time nor desire to be in each other’s presence for more than was necessary. Perhaps that was more on John’s end at the time, but even then he had felt that keen longing to be around Sherlock he’d had during the two-year hiatus. Now though, they had all the time in the world to pick their way through the shambles of their relationship with no psychopaths or megalomaniacs to interrupt them.
"Since the day you shot a man to save my life" the detective replied with a playful smile. John huffed a small laugh and reached between them to take Sherlock’s hand in his own, lacing their fingers together and squeezing. "What about you?" Sherlock asked, watching their intertwined hands.
"Fascinating..." She breathed, tilting her head again and taking in the way Sherlock's face fell, darkening into a scowl as he processed what had happened.
“Well,” Sherlock began, switching the gun from one sweaty palm to the other, “Considering the, frankly, ridiculous curtesy of headroom, I’d say this is for a person of a about 5’5, so likely a woman or a shorter male” He began to circle the coffin, hands gesticulating despite the dangerous, and loaded weapon that was clutched in one of them. “This is a practical and informed choice; balance of probability suggests it’s for an unmarried or widowed person who is distant from their relatives. That much is suggested by the economy of choice; acquainted with the concept of death, but unsentimental about the necessity of disposal. Also, the lining of the coffin-”
"Both of you, c’mon," He said loudly, breaking through the haze of Sherlock’s usually racing mind. It had slowed with the exhaustion of looking after Rosie and he counted himself surprised at the toll looking after a child had taken on him. He grunted and slowly slid off of the sofa, stumbling a little as his legs, still heavy from sleep, forgot how to hold him upright. John had already disappeared up the stairs and Sherlock followed, laboriously trekking up the 15 steps to the landing. He poked his head into Rosie’s room and cocked it in question.
John burst into giggles at the swift change in tone and Sherlock shot a glare in his direction. "Hi…yes she was…no I’m fine, I promise…he is…you want-…he’s a bit busy right now…right, yeah, of course…has Mycroft spoken to either of you?… ah…uh-huh…" John perked up and tried to catch Sherlock’s eye, which took far longer than was necessary.
Sherlock nodded again, "Good. Take care of him though, he’s not as strong as he likes to think" he shouldered his blanket higher and began to walk in the direction of the luminous police tape.
" He repeated, slower and raising his voice to something just below a whisper. Sherlock flushed and nodded, breaking eye contact and returning to his father.
Sherlock's hands were beginning to shake, he could see John's phone just within arms reach of the man but he wasn't moving. The panic was rising in Sherlock, growing from a wave to tsunami as he wrapped his arms around himself and prayed, possibly for the first time in his life, that John would pick up.
"He told Mycroft... His parents... Molly... and a whole bunch of people that helped him stage his suicide, but he couldn't tell me. Me, Mary, his mate."
John didn’t move. Just watched as his omega’s lips pursed into a grimace of acceptance and lowered his gaze to the ground.
John waited for Sherlock to begin his complaining: "Mother keeps checking up on me, because you're not here to do it." "Mycroft is a right tosser and I'll end up killing him if you aren't here to stop me." "I can't solve this case without you." "All the food here it terrible, come back and feed me." "I'm bored without you."
John carried so many fears. His fears consumed his mind relentlessly. John worried that when he wasn’t with Sherlock, was he with that beta? Did Sherlock still keep in contact with them? Was this lover a woman or a man? Were they beautiful? Did Sherlock love them? Would Sherlock always love this beta? Would John only ever be second best? Would Sherlock stay with John out of obligation, but secretly see this beta? Would he have told this beta about John? Talked about how cruel John was? How John could never equal the beta?
