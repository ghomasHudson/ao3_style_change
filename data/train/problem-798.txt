“I’ll lead,” Greg said as he let his other hand slid around Mycroft's waist and he felt Mycroft's hand fall on his biceps. The music started and they started to flow around the small gym with ease. Greg lends closer to Mycroft's ear. “In fencing your opponent it like a dancing partner. You have to go with them, predict their move before it happens so you aren't stuck one step behind.” Greg smiled a little more when he saw the hairs on the back of Mycrofts' neck stand on end.
“You fucking fag” His father yelled as he threw her to the ground and spit on her “It’s a disgrace to call you my son” Harry had caught herself on the carpeted ground and muttered something
“Thank you, I think I’ve done everything I can for this flat. All that's left is some electrical stuff that I'm not even gonna risk messing with, it's gonna be a bit boring now.”
“Greg explained” Sherlock's head shot up to look at him. He looked scared, like the day in the bathtub, but devoid of all the anger and in its place there was sadness.
The next few days went by smoothly, Mrs.Hudson got him the paints just like she said, and he finished up the walls in record time. It would have been faster too if he didn’t have to wait for paint to dry.
The laughter was cut off by the sound of a door opening and closing. It took Sherlock a moment to realize it was on his side. He was a bit confused, his mother was on a trip, and Mrs.Hudson would be asleep then he heard it. The faint sound of his name being called in a familiar voice, Mycroft's voice.
“Yes, yes go ahead.” whispered and John grins a little forced but all wit good in mind. Then suddenly John’s head was covered in raw egg. He ,made a silent ‘oh’ with his mouth. Sherlock couldn’t hold the laughter back on the other end of the line. John rains his hands through his hair before he could realize his mistake. Yet again Sherlock and John shared a proper laughing fit.
“Right well it’s just like that.” Greg got up and walked over to his bag and pulled out a small Bluetooth speaker and his phone. “Here I'll show you.” Mycroft watched Greg set up the speakers on the pile floor mats that Sherlock, his brother used when he had Hand to Hand combat practice.
“Stop playing with your food, or you’ll be sent upstairs with your brother” He grumbled and John brought the first real bits of food to his mouth moments later. Even as he steadily picked through his food he still wondered why Harry was acting so weird. His father stood abruptly and went to the tv room, and his mother automatically started cleaning the table.
He woke up a few hours later to his phone going off. After he managed to fish it out of his trouser pockets he looked at the caller ID which flashed Irene in big black letters. He answered with a sigh.
Johns' mouth travelled to Sherlock's naval next nipping a few marks there as well, Sherlock was practically thrashing, he whimpered as John got closer to where he wanted him, and whined when it was passed over for the inside of his thigh.
“Oh and that reminds me. Sherlock's water valve is hooked with yours so if you shut off your water you shut off his as well, so just let him know before hand,” John nodded “Well I really must be going, I’ve got a cooking show at 6 that I don't want to miss. If you need anything just ask, and ill have the paint delivered tomorrow.
“anything, anything more” He panted trying to shuffle down so John's hand would touch his weeping cock.
“Some kids from school came in and saw me, gave me the shiner, so Tammy said I could leave for the night. I was changing in the garage when dad came out.”
“Okay, I won't,” John just looked at him for a second. “What do you want a pinky promise watson?” John shook his head.
“Well if you’re ever looking for something to do Sherlock’s flat needs some fixing up. A few leaking faucets and holes in the wall” John stilled for a moment at the mention of the name recalling what had happened. John gave a slightly soured smile.
Sherlock let out a loud moan and arched up into the touch, but was swiftly pushed back down by a hand firmly planted on his chest, after Sherlock's back was planted firmly against the bed again he moved his hand over to the neglected nipple and tweaked enjoying the course of moans that came with it. He sucked on the nipple until it was red and tender before letting himself move to the other which only took half as long to get into a similar state thanks to his hand.
“ follow me,” Sherlock said as he turned around and walked into the flat. He did as he was told and followed the through the sitting room as well as the kitchen/ dining room into a hallway and finally ending with the man in the bathroom “The tub takes approximately 30 minutes to drain when half full, and the sink bubbles when it's draining. The shut-off valve is on the first floor, feel free to take as long as you want, just notify me before you leave.’ He walked out of the room and left John alone. Well, he guessed he might as well. He had fear originally that the pipe problems could also be coming from Sherlock's flat after Mrs.hudson told him they were connected. He went downstairs and grabbed a snake before coming back up to Sherlock's flat. He snaked the drain and came up with a giant clump of curly hair. Just what he had expected after hearing the other man's concerns.
‘Guess you’ll have to wait to find out.” He said adding a wink to the end before stepping through the doors of the clinic.
“Yes sir,” He said as he turned and went back to the kitchen retrieving the beer. When he handed the drink his father only grinned and John walked carefully to the stairs, that he had to stop himself from taking two at a time.
It was funny really. The predicament he had managed to get himself into. He had never planned on John attempting to befriend him. Never thought he would let himself go passed the limit he had set of one communication, end of the line. He, Sherlock Holmes, had managed to completely separate his life from that of William, and yet here he was toying with the rules he had set for himself. Playing with the line that separated William, a young brilliant boy overcome by the temptation of hormones. and himself, who has locked away from feelings because they were below him.
Lunch was chaotic, everyone was information hungry, and seemed to have their own idea on who William was. He felt bad for Will, most of the time people overlooked the absolute brilliance of the man and instead were consumed by the need to know his identity.
He walked behind the chair his father was sitting in careful not to make the granola bar wrapped crinkle in his pocket.
His father had Harry by the scruff of the shirt a fresh black eye on her face, and a skirt around her waist with he clean-shaven legs on display.
John glanced to Sherlock almost in a way of asking silent permission even though he knew he didn’t need it. Sherlock didn’t seem to give any sign to avoid the question so he proceeded. “Sherlock is in my Anatomy class, and because he’s only in year 11, I was impressed.” He couldn’t help but glance between Sherlock and Irene. their eyes were locked even though John was the one talking.
“How di… Physician. How did you know that?” They seemed to mindlessly start on their journey to the clinic.
The first thing Sherlock noticed, before he opened his eyes, was the pounding echoing through his skull. He only just managed to stop a pained moan from escaping his lips at the feeling. He went to rub the blurriness from his eyes and found one of them pinned to the bed by what felt like a warm lump. He’s brain, lagging slightly from the migrain, realized that the warm lump was John, who was snoring softly with his face tucked into Sherlock's side. More importantly John's sleeping for was very obviously naked, and pressed very close to Sherlock, who was equally naked. Sherlock took a moment to pull the hazy memory from the night before to the surface.
“It’s fine Johnny just hold still” He could see Harry’s face, she had a split lip and a smattering of bruises
John's heart fell out of his chest, he had never thought that his parents would want to visit Harry at work mostly because they never went out to eat. Surely his father would say no, they could just go to the store and grab more ice cream, the store was closer it was cheaper.
“The footing is too hard let's move on to something else” Mycroft took off his mask and went to grab a drink of water.
“It doesn’t matter what we do anyway it won't last and you know it he’ll be drunk and throwing shit by tomorrow”
“Come in” The man voice came from the other side of the door. It seemed rougher than it had early, and he feared that he had woken the man. He pushed open the door slowly and was surprised with the sight he was meet with.
“Johnny, hurry and eat, so I can clean the table.” It was another one of dads silly rules, once he was done with dinner, everyone was done with dinner, no matter how much food you had left. John shoveled a couple more forkfuls of food before he helped his mother clear the table. As they both finished the dishes his mother handed him a granola bar and small orange, “give this to your brother, your dad forgot to give him lunch money this morning” his mom said and he took the two items and shoved them in his pockets. He didn’t mention that his father hadn’t neglected to give him his lunch money right after Harry walked out the door after being rushed out the door.
“You like to look like a girl?” John asked slowly, he didn’t want to sound mean, being called a girl was an insult after all.
“John,” His father said and he stopped in his tracks and sucked in a breath “Get me a beer,” he said without turning around
“Below the collar,” He panted, and John gave a firm nod before attaching himself where his neck meets his collarbone and nipped and sucked to his heart's content with Sherlock moaning and cursing above him. He moved back up to the other man's pulse point letting her teeth graze it lightly, but move away quickly redirecting his attention to the man's nipples.
Sherlock hadn't worn a packer so much since he was 16 when his cheeks and jaw were still to round and the lumpiness of his chest made him feel uneasy. He wore his packer infront of John, and his reaction was delightful. Sherlock was wearing tight fitted jeans for a case, they hugged a little too nicely to be devoid of a bulge. And John, wonderful John could barely draw his eyes away from it the whole case. Sherlock had been insulted at first, assuming John was trying to suss out whether it was ‘real’, then he remembered the state of undresses John had seen him in and concluded that there was no way that John had managed not to notice his lack of penis. He was aroused, John was aroused at the idea of Sherlock's bulge. Obviously once he was aware of this he used it to his full advantage. He found that on average John was 62% less likely to pull a date if he spent the whole night ogling his flatmate. It was far easier to prevent relationships then it was to break them. Sherlock took to wearing a packer anytime they might be around attractive available women.
“I need another drink” A lame excuse but his head was reeling, he went to the bar none the less and ordered something just a little stronger than what he was used to, and he got John two fingers of a fantastic whiskey, they do say alcohol is the best truth serum after all.
“I’m 18, I’ll be 19 next month. I figured since you had been staring at my ass the whole way here you knew.” No, John was sure he hadn't. He couldn’t have been, he had caught himself glancing maybe once but he hadn’t been staring. Had he?
Sherlock walked over to the bed slowly and sat on the edge facing away from Irene “We agreed in the beginning that William wasn’t me. That we were two different people. I told myself that I wouldn’t let these articles change me. I made a distinct line between myself and William. I know we are the same person that I am him and he is me, but it’s just easier to think of it like we are to different people living two different lives
“Please what.” He asked with his well-calloused hand running up and down his sensitive thighs, and when he didn’t answer right away travelling up to this nipple and pulling hard at the sore nubs Sherlock gasped at the sensation. “Please what?” he asked again.
“You can stroke yourself with two fingers until you come, do you understand.” Sherlock nodded. John went back to ravishing Sherlock's hole with his mouth, and it only took two minutes for Sherlock to start coming and as he did John shoved two fingers into the wet hole and Sherlock howelled and another glob of come shoot out his prick. John let his other hand stroke himself as he pumped his fingers in and out of Sherlock's twitching hole. He let his fingers brush against Sherlock’s prostate and watched as the man shivers in overstimulation. John let his next push hit his prostate dead on and wiggled his fingers over it a bit. Sherlock whined and his flaccid cock dripped a little come, this was what pushed John over the edge and he came over Sherlock's back before collapsing on top of it. Sherlock huffed under him and John rumbled but lifted himself off and sat back. Sherlock turned around stretching out over and around John.
“God, I’m so sorry. I didn’t even realise I was- I didn’t mean to- I'm so sorry.” Sherlock didn’t seem amused by his stumbling over words.
John pushed himself off the ground and assessed his damage, a scraped knee and a bit of road rash on his elbow. Nothing that couldn’t be easily fixed with a basic first aid kit. After checking himself over he looked over the cyclist and saw him in a much worse state. The man or boy it seemed had attempted to hit his brakes as hard as he could, probably the reason why John had so little damage. As a result however he had managed to throw himself off the bike and face first into the concrete. From was he saw it was a definite nose break and a possible concussion based on the rapid blinking, though it could have been from the shock. Though he wasn’t a doctor yet he was trained in first aid and by all means able to treat this injury before sending the young man to the hospital or to his parents.
“Well, you’re an army doctor recently invalidated home from Afghanistan after being shot in the shoulder. You have a psychosomatic limp and your therapist thinks it's because you are haunted by memories by the war, but she’s wrong based on how thoroughly fucked I have just been. You didn’t start seeing men until you joined the army and at first you chalked it up to it being the only thing available but soon you started a somewhat emotional relationship with someone higher than you, but you left them behind when you were injured and have not tried to contact him for the last 6 months.” Sherlock's eyes stayed close
“I'm smart. My mother didn’t want me to skip grades so I chose to take a few select classes on the side and I ended up two years ahead in all my classes.” Sherlock seemed proud of himself, as he should be. His chest puffed with pride and he sat up a little straighter.
John was surprised, he was pretty certain that everyone on this earth that didn't live under a rock had at least knew what the game was.
Now he opened all them with ease, even after they had rested the codes and changed them. It only took him five minutes to figure them out as they were extremely similar. He was ready for the next experiment. Ready to get lost in the calculations and results. Ready to let is mind ease off of the topic of John. The topic of who William would end up being to John, who he would end up being to John.
“Look at you, you're already begging for it aren't you” John growled in his ear and a shudder ran down his spine
“He still stays in their home every weekend he doesn't work, John. They have no intentions of getting divorced. I’d say that they have differing intimate expectations and although they are both satisfied romantically with their relationship Lestrade is looking to distance himself from his children as he reassesses his needs, and goals in a relationship but that’s what you get when you marry someone you’re not attrac-”
“Why not?” John asked he’d heard of it once in passing, it was a girl though, that had started being a boy, but he guessed it could work the other way around. He didn’t even know the boy, he was a few years ahead of Harry even.
“Dead, dead to you. The same thing for the most part.” Sherlock stopped in front of the door to the clinic. He hadn’t even realised they had gotten here. He was sure they had gotten some weird looks on the way not that he noticed. Blood was partially dried on the other man's face, and although the bleeding had stopped it didn’t make his face look anything short of a horror scene.
“I can see how this could work in our favor” Sherlock whispered still a little scared that John would somehow recognize his voice even though he knew it would be altered by John’s crappy computer speakers.
“My Brother’s home, I have to go.” And then Sherlock ended the call, and John was left hanging with so many questions.
He woke up with a bit of a startle when he realized he wasn’t in his own bed. He remembered why he was in a different bed after a moment and stretched in satisfaction.
Today had been an eventful day. He had woken up late because he spent last night with Irene stapling the copies of the articles to the back of every newspaper the school had to offer. then he had stayed up even longer writing the note to John. Irene had offered to help because Sherlock didn’t have much experience typing his own deductions on paper. Sherlock was determined to make this one especially by himself. He hoped somehow John would tell the difference between his voice on paper, and what Irene though his voice would sound like on paper. But at the same time, he didn’t because what if John hated the real him, as most did. It was stupid, he knew it was just teenage hormones but that didn’t mean he could easily shut them off as much as he tried, he could never manage.
John peaked his head around the corner and just as Harry was about to reply he caught a glimpse of John
Of course, the line of questioning had lead in this direction, and it was only normal for John to be curious.
The boy jumped up swiftly and his eyes glanced around in panic before they landed on John and grew wide. “The bell rang you should get to class, ”he said with a small smile before turning to walk away so that he wasn’t late to class himself. He could hear the boy scramble behind him as he walked out of the classroom. The halls were almost cleared except for a few stragglers. John could hear the soft footfall of the tall curly haired boy behind him, so he whipped around feeling in the mood to strike up a conversation.
Sherlock never really slept much anyway, but on sunday night he was feeling particularly exhausted. In his attempt to stay up to finish his latest experiment he listened to music, but that seemed to on lull him to sleep, and after waking up for the third time with his head resting on his forearm he decided to call it quits and give in to the sleep his body was demanding.
“No, No what if’s, none of that. Tell him.” Irene sigh for about the millionth time that night. “I’ve known this for a long time Sherlock and I think it’s time you know the truth.” Sherlock got up and turned to her in curiosity. “There is no difference between you and William, take this from someone who knows you better than you do. This whole facade you put on to trick people into thinking you don’t feel doesn’t work. Anyone can see through it. I’m sure John can see through it, and the moment you tell him you are William he’s going to smack himself. I know deductions are your thing sherlock, but John is going to be so utterly annoyed with himself for not noticing it the moment he met you.” Sherlock was angry, then frustrated, then confused, and finally hopeful. So hopeful that what Irene said was true.
He had never had a lover so thorough, don't get it wrong, he had had plenty of capable lovers, even great ones but none of them amounted to John Watson, the man who had him on the verge of coming without even touching his cock. He feared that when it came to that point he would be so on edge that his stamina would be embarrassingly short. Which would be reasonable as it felt like he had been teased and on edge for hours
It was a new feeling for Mycroft but a delightful one but ended much too soon with the sound of gagging from the door. Greg drew away quickly and nearly dropped Mycroft but made sure he was on his own two feet before putting space between them.
A stunning, not older than twenty years old stood awkwardly, facing away from him a toward the main doors. Mycroft had come in unnoticed. After the initial shock wore off Mycroft scuffed his shoe on the floor causing the other man to spin around quickly.
“What did you do, Sherlock, it’s his birthday” Sherlock took the drink from John’s hand and threw it back.
“No, No Sherlock, I would never” He grabbed Sherlock softly under his jaw so he could meet his eyes “I would
Mr Watson arrived approximately ten minutes later. He sat his bag down by his desk then walked out in front of the doors and stood there waiting. Mr Holmes was making an effort not to be seen, he wanted to surprise Mr Watson. After five minutes Mr Watson checked his watch then checked the car park to see if any taxis had dropped off a mysterious tall figure. Mr Watson saw nothing and sighed, Mr Holmes saw his chance.
The hall was bustling with people and music, the songs didn’t seem to stop. The students were standing in their groups, some in the centre of the room, dancing to the music, and some by the food table, grabbing what they could before more people came. Mr Watson was standing close to the food table, every now and then picking at the chicken nuggets which were laid out. There were a few teachers coming up to get plates every so often, but no one really stayed around long enough for a proper conversation. He keep checking the door, as if he was waiting for someone, and felt disappointed when he saw that no one interesting had walked in.
Mr Watson started to get tired, he hated to admit it, but it was because of how old he was. Miss Hooper was beginning to feel the same, so they took a break by the food table.
“Well, I thought it would be easier for me to do it. It’ll also make me avoid making another teacher angry because they need to wake up 20 minutes earlier.” Mr Watson’s smile was real compared to the one that the headmaster had sent his way.
For Mr Watson, the only thing that he had to concern himself with in the time slots of classes was making sure that he had given teachers what they asked for by the time they needed it. Though today he was concerning himself with them because he wanted to view Mr Holmes’ class. He checked his class schedule on his computer and decided to go when he had year 10s fourth period.
“John, you really don’t” But John had already found where Greg was siting and was making a path toward him, Sherlock followed in hopes to unull the situation
Before John could stop himself he fell into the rabbit hole, and before he knew it the bell was ringing and everyone was rushing from the class. John still had to put his notebook in his bag, so he stayed behind. He notices the curly head of hair still laying on the desk and he couldn’t help but feel bad for the kid. He had been there before, the stress and homework had him falling asleep in a few of his classes and the teacher never wakes you as some kind of punishment. He walked over to the lump of dark chestnut hair and tapped on the desk and when he didn’t get a response nudged the shoulder of the sleeping boy softly.
“This is John Watson, he is in my anatomy class.” After Sherlock was done talking John gave a small wave and everyone sat down. It was a little awkward, no one seemed to want to talk, and John was about to say something but Irene spoke up instead.
“Isn’t it, don’t you feel like he’s, you know, manipulating everyone to get what he wants?” Greg seems surprised and Sherlock is absolutely embarrassed and John can't stand it.
It was a month later that John found out what the word faggot meant. They were all sitting down for dinner when his dad cleared his throat.
He waited a moment, but there was no answer so he knocked a bit louder, hoping the other name wasn’t sleeping and was just in a deeper part of the flat. Just as he was about to turn away the door flew open, and a tall, pale man with dark curly hair stood in front of him in a tight button up shirt and trousers. He looked the man up and down while he wet his lips. They looked at each other for a moment before John broke the silence with the attractive man.
“Oh, that would be nice dear” His mother relaxed slightly “We could go see Harry at work, he’s been working there for nearly 6 months and we haven’t gone in while he was working yet”
“John! what are you doing down here?” He seemed angry and John only looked at him with wide eyes expecting to be scolded.
Irene had told him it was unhealthy to hold back on all his ‘primal urges’ as she had put it. Sherlock had thought differently, grow up in a home where it was common courtesy to keep your feelings to yourself. He had always had a twinge of doubt, like when his father died at the age of 47 from a heart attack, or when Mycroft had started to lose his hair at twenty. However, clear the signs became Sherlock just ignored them because it was easier that way.
“They might check you by surprise” Greg biped him effortlessly, keeping his face close “And sometimes your body will tell you exactly what to do, and you’ll just know it’s right even if you don’t know why.” Greg searched the younger man's eyes. At some point, Mycroft’s hands migrated from his arm to the back of his neck, and when he felt the light brush of Mycroft's thumb he connected their lips in a slow kiss.
“Let's not make you wait any longer,” Sherlock said grabbing his hand and pulling him into the bed.it started with a heavy and heated kiss fueled by nothing but attraction and sexual tension. John soon moved his mouth down along Sherlock's jaw placing kisses and nips every few inches until he reached the long pale neck that was stretched and presented to him as an offering from his partner. He started behind his ear licking and nipping before moving on to pull the earlobe and trail his nose lightly up the shell of his ear. This was met with a grown, and a needy thrust of the other man's hips trying to catch friction from John's thigh but his body hovered just out of reach.
“Don’t be absurd Irene, Mrs.Hudson isn’t old, and she likes the work. It gives her something to do, makes her feel useful.” sherlock argued.
“Don’t change the subject,” Sherlock grinned like a cat “I’ll have you know I have a wide variety of strapons” John only grew pinker “Now I know what your thinking ‘how could I possibly know you would want that’ well John you have an interesting mix of porn selection, on the more relevant side would be pegging, the act in which a female penetrates a man with the use of a strap on, which would put you, the man, in a straight relationship in the position of the bottom. And maybe just maybe you would only want to bottom for a woman, not uncommon except that in your array of gay porn the bottoms are random and unimportant however the tops are always tall, slim, and brunette it’s easy to assume that you take the place of the bottom there for making their appearance unimportant and the top in the videos the subject of your fantasy. Thus concluding that not only does John Watson like it up the arse, but he likes men who are brunette, tall and slim to be the ones putting it up his arse. So tell me how this plan seems so crazy because John you may fool others with your intentionally shrouded catch phase, and it is correct, you are not gay, but under the same assumption you are also most definitely not straight,” Through the course if his monologue he stood and twirled around the room ending up in front of John who was stood board straight. “Now you know I hate to repeat myself but I will say again, we could work something ou-” Sherlock could care less about being cut short on his speech because beautiful wonderful amazing John crashed his mouth against Sherlocks.
“Do I look okay to you?” The boy shoots back, pinching his nose. John caught the stranger's eyes for the first time but quickly shook the attraction away. The kid couldn’t be older than sixteen and John isn't really one to rob the cradle.
“Why are you still all the way over there when I'm all the way over here.” Sherlock purred with pouted lips. This jump started John into action, he quickly removed his socks and the tool belt around his waist letting them fall to the floor as well as his cane. He undid his trousers and pulled his shirt over his head unceremoniously. He realized he probably looked a bit over eager, and this was confirmed when he looked up to see Sherlock's wide eyes and raised eye brows.
“ you’ve never cared about your appearance before, you actually go out of your way to look rugged when you get the chance, it brings you back to your younger days of ripped jeans and motorbikes’
Sherlock came first with John close behind. John pulled out slipped the condom off his softening cock and throw it in the bin before crashing next to an already snoring Sherlock next to him
No-W and with the response was and extremely close up picture of Williams upper lip -Which was clean shaven john noted- and on it was a neat little french style mustache.
“I’ll pick up the paint and primer for you tomorrow, I'll be going out to the store anyway. I may not know anything about those pipes but I know a good paint when I see one. I think I’ll bring over some left overs too. I had a big family and I still can't bring myself to make less than a serving of 6. I can’t eat that all by myself. Sometimes I bring it to Sherlock, the tennet upstairs, but he rarely eats as it is and I hate to see it go to waste.” Mrs Hudson rambled, but John found it oddly relaxing. He noted the name, Sherlock, as he was meaning to introduce himself to his neighbour, another suggestion by his therapist. He figured it wouldn’t be too hard, just pop up and introduce himself tell him the ‘if you ever needed a cup of milk I'm was your guy’ usual.
“Oh, come on Harry he can come down it’s his house too.” Tommy said “Wanna watch Jonny, it's about robots” Harry rolled his eyes but allowed John in the room. “I always wanted a younger sibling” Tommy mentioned, and Harry only rolled his eyes and murmured something about John being annoying most of the time.
John hoped William was just joking. He had never really liked the idea of facial hair on himself or his partners.
“What the hell Greg” John yelled from a couple meters away and Lestrareds head turned as well as the 6 people sitting around him
“It’s open” He replied setting the book down on the small side table next to his chair. She walked in the door with a Tupperware container in her hand.
“Minor concussion as well” Was all the boy said in response. John didn’t know if he was looking for a ‘thank you’ or some kind of recognition for his help, but he wasn’t too phased by the words.
“Well, John” Tom started “Sometimes boys like boys like a boyfriend, or girls like other girls like a girlfriend.” John nobbed
“Then why am I scared. I don’t do well when i'm scared.” Sherlock was rigid where he sat “I did something bad, Something that i never should have done, but i don't regret it. Not in the slightest.” At this point Irene thought it would be better to just listen to what sherlock had to say and assess the situation when he was done. “You know John, I talked to him, gave him my number. God, it’s so stupid. I’m envious of myself, I want to have what William has with him, and i do But he doesn’t know and I don’t know how he’ll react.” Sherlock groaned in frustration before flopping back onto the bed.
Irene’s head fell and she closed her eyes with a sigh. She know this day would come. Sherlock sounded insane, and for anyone else it would be. Sherlock had never done well with emotions William had always been their code if he had been feeling particularly sad, or scared.  “Sherlock this doesn't have to be a bad thing. Evolution is key to the survival of a race. Change can be a good.”
“year 11” Sherlock seemed to favour the shortest answer possible, he didn't seem to be afraid like most lower classmen were. Sherlock was confident, and John liked that.
“Yeah, he’s smarter than the entire student body combined, and boy does he know it.” a new voice said. Irene Adler, the leader of GSA and proud owner of half the student bodies secrets. There were a few people that thought she was William. John had always disagreed, though the speech seemed like the writing, there was no way she would hide it. She was to attention hungry. “Have you made a new friend Sherlock, come on, introduce him to the group.” Then John notices the small group of three that stood behind Irene.
“You’re not the only one who can read people, I’m a copper Sherlock. You don't think I don't see how desperately scared you are to lose him.” Lestrared’s eyes were cold “You don’t think I know why your here with him tonight, because if you didn’t come he still would, and then there’s the chance of him finding someone else, hmm, you can't sit at home and trick people into thinking you're together to keep him. Well let me tell you something Sherlock,
“No, you're going to get this.” Greg joined him on the bench “You dance, right?” Mycroft shot him a glare
“Okay, John why don’t we talk about this somewhere else” Greg told the people at his table he was fine and got up with his coat. “No need to make a scene in here”
John double checked, then triple checked, so he knew he wasn’t going insane. when he finally got over the shock he looked around to see if it was Greg using his interest to play a prank. But there was no one, other than the random staff member here and there getting ready for the busy day. John decided to continue reading.
“Yes well, I’d say two roommates based on your shoes. There old but not old enough to need a new pair. There are lines of dirt on the outsides of both sides; they’ve been sitting next to other shoes. You're in university to become a doctor with a scholarship no doubt but that doesn’t mean you have the money to blow on two other pairs of shoe. I’m sure you have another pair, but they would be dress shoes for the random family wedding nothing you would be prancing around in the mud with. so, roommates, it is. You have a sister, she gave you that watch” Sherlock pointed to the watch on his right wrist. ”Like I said before, no money to be spending on expensive watched, so a gift from a women based on the style, although a nice one it does have a touch of femininity. Your mother passed away and you haven’t had a shag in months. Case and point, sister gave you the watch.” Sherlock glanced at him and a smile tugged at the side on his mouth when a saw John's gaping one. “Was I Wrong.”
“What.. what were you doing?” John asked it seemed like his brother was trying to look like the girls in his grade with the crop top and makeup.
Sherlock was resting comfortably on his chair in his sheet. He sat upside down with his legs thrown over the top and his head inches from the ground. He was testing how the blood pooling affected his brain function over a long duration. He would not have humored John with a response if it wasn't for the opportunity to collect data on verbal affects to the experiment.
“I didn’t think you would make it!!” he was yelling a little to over-talk the crowd, he pointedly looked at Sherlock then back at John.
When Greg was done he walked over to Mycroft and bowed, offering his hand “May I have this dance?” He looked up through his eyelashes and sent Mycroft a smile. He couldn’t help but smile and put his hand in the older mans. Greg pulled him into a standing position.
“Gregory, but everyone calls me Greg.” Mycroft took that moment to look the other man over. He had straight brown hair that was pushed back slightly and dark brown eyes. His jaw was soft and had a certain kindness to it that matched well with the smile his lips held. He was quite handsome.
“That was, that was bloody amazing. What else can you tell?” The boy looked weary but after a moment recomposed himself.
He was itching for it, as he did every Friday. What new brilliant deductions had he made this week? Was the french teacher cheating on her husband, was the new math teacher taking bribes for higher grades like everyone said. He was early as he was every Friday, just so he could beat the line. He was usually the first to read it, and it was just the same today. He popped a quarter into the machine and pulled on the handle to reveal the stacked newspapers. He pulled the first of the pile out and ripped the sheet of paper stapled to the back off, throwing the rest away in the recycling bin that was next to him. John sat down on the bench and started to read.
“Yes, we had a nice conversation. He told me that he’s going to be stopping in some of the lessons today. He’s coming to mine 4th period.” Mr Holmes watched as Miss Hooper’s faced dropped, then lit up with amazement that he had managed to make another adult spend more time with him.
“When I saw your face I knew that I would be okay. I looked into your eyes and I saw the future we would have together. You gave me hope to survive because I knew if I did then I would be surviving with you.” He started to learn in even closer to Sherlock, he saw the same face he did all those months ago, but this time it looked less worried, and more settled. He could feel Sherlock’s breath on his face and he too began to breathe faster.
“I was scared that I was going to lose you. I’ve never felt like that before, not even when my house burnt down as a child. I wasn’t scared of losing anyone - not even Mycroft. But you, you made me want to dive through a shower of bullets just to be by your side, to protect you.” Sherlock looked like he was getting tearful. John edged closer to him, resting a hand on Sherlock’s knee, both to steady himself and to settle the detective.
Mr Watson arrived first, it was almost a habit to be early, plus, he wanted to see everyone’s costume before they entered the hall. He took his normal position by the door and waited. Mr Holmes was nowhere near ready by the time Mr Watson had walked through the school doors. It was a party, and Mr Holmes was going to go to all means to avoid getting there, even though he knew that he needed to if he wanted Miss Hooper to talk to him ever again. As much as he likes to say that he wants to be late, he can’t avoid the truth that he’s making his costume look perfect.
“Well we can’t send him home in this weather, can we. He may just have to stay the night.” Mycroft smirked and turned to Greg “Only if you want obviously.”
“I have needs Sherlock, you can’t expect me to be celibate for the rest of my life” Sherlock looked at him obviously running over something in his head
Sherlock's erection had gone down as well as John's so he quickly swallowed him down and brought him back to full hardness while palming himself and listening to Sherlock's sweet sounds.
John couldn’t say no to a good whiskey, and after a few to many whiskeys he couldn’t say no to the bright eyed just 20-somethings that offered him a shot and from there things maybe got a little out of hand
“Sometime’s they will surprise you,” Greg said before spinning Mycroft out and pulling him back in “But you just have to go with it, and recover.” He could feel Mycroft's head nod against the side of his head.
“I have to go.” Sherlock sounded rushed and John was considered. All he heard was the sound of a door.
John flipped them once he got his grips detaching his lips from Sherlocks and pressing the close to his ear “Don’t come until I tell you to. Do you think you can do that? Think you can be a good boy for me?” He nipped at his ear and felt Sherlock nod his head and whimper. “Good”
“Any sign of Sherlock yet?” Mr Watson asked. Miss Hooper shook her head, she wasn’t watching the door during their dancing session either.
“Yes, nice to meet you again, Mr Watson” Mr Holmes was determined to avoid any small talk. He disliked it normally and being this early in the morning he disliked it more.
“Because I actually do something interesting. Like right now, my conversation is clearly  more interesting than the one that you’re having with Mr Anderson.” Mr Holmes retorted. Making Mr Anderson’s face turn into a deep scowl. Donovan turned back to him in attempt to apologize and revive their conversation.
“No, just getting a bit lonely.” He lied, of course he was looking for Mr Holmes. He wouldn’t be looking for the company of any teacher if he was feeling lonely, they all say hello then go to set up their first classes or get their forms ready.
The need to impress was also present in Mr Watson’s head. Unlike Mr Holmes, Mr Watson has to impress a variety of people in order to keep his job, but he needs to impress to impress these people, he wants to impress Mr Holmes. Mr Holmes is unlike anyone who Mr Watson has ever met before, his mysterious presence made Mr Watson want to learn more about him, almost as it the secrecy drew him in.
One night, after John was fully recovered and he and Sherlock had just gotten back from pursuing a criminal on foot through what seemed like the whole of London, the pair decided to go out for a few drinks at the nearest bar.
He opened his eyes again and tried to adjust his view for the final time. He looked around and saw that he was inside a hospital room, but not one from Afghanistan, one from England. There were several “get well soon” cards and two bunches of flowers sitting on the bedside table. There was no one else in the room with him, so he tried to signal a nurse.
“Maybe she just wanted you to be here so you could enjoy yourself, and it doesn’t look like you are, want to dance?” Mr Watson asked, he knew that it was likely for him to be rejected as Mr Holmes scowled at the mention of dancing.
Mr Holmes arrived late, as promised. He walked in through the doors and observed his surroundings. Various staff members and students were hanging around the food table, looking like they were waiting for more food to be brought out. There were some students requesting songs at the DJ booth and Mrs Hem’s band getting ready to perform on the stage. All of the music was directed one towards one place - the dance floor. The dance floor which currently held host to a dance circle, centred by Miss Hooper and Mr Watson. The pair looked like they had been dancing for a while now, sweat was dripping down both of their foreheads. Mr Holmes decided to stay clear of the dance floor, he knew that trying to dance would be a catastrophe. Instead, he stationed himself by the corner of the room. His costume was scary and the corner was rather dark, people would just assume that he was a prop if he stayed still long enough.
The science department at Watterford Academy was not the like the other departments. To start with, it was the newest block in the school, the old one had to be knocked down due to an experiment gone wrong by one of the teachers (thankfully, the students had gone home).  Secondly, the science department was home to one of the most interesting teachers in the school, Mr Holmes. Mr Holmes teaches chemistry to the years 9 and above. He is not allowed to teach younger years because his methods are so absurd that the school doesn’t  want to get sued for health and safety reasons. Most students (and sometimes teachers) question how Mr Holmes had managed to land a job teaching, but then they stopped questioning when they saw that Mr Holmes’ students got some of the highest grades in the school. Upon entering year 9, students hoped that they would have Mr Holmes teaching them instead of Mr Anderson, another chemistry teacher and Mr Holmes’ sworn enemy. Mr Holmes does not agree with Mr Anderson’s teaching methods, and Mr Anderson does not agree with Mr Holmes’.
“Good morning, Mr Watson, thank you again for volunteering for this duty. It’s hard to find people who want to be here so early.” He smiled. The smile look a little a bit forced, like the smile that Mr Watson had seen the headmaster give to nearly everyone he’d came into contact with.
“Shit, Sherlock!” The students laughed as Miss Hooper bursts into the room. Teachers swearing at Mr Holmes was nothing new to them but seeing Mr Holmes, who was normally as graceful as a swan, fall over was something new.
Mr Watson has had his share of lovers in the past. He’s never been able to settle down with anyone because he always picks the wrong people. The secrecy and mystery draws him in but then he ends up being played by the secrets and the mystery only turns out to be an affair. He also moved around a lot for work. He found it hard to stay in one place for more than a few years because he would get bored. He would walk the same corridors everyday and memorise every turn just to get bored and move away. It was a bad habit of his.
“Thank you, and for the record, I was forced to come by Molly. I don’t see why though, she looks very satisfied chatting to her friends.” Mr Holmes said.
“Thank you, John, I’m so glad that you got them here early. The last person who had your job delivered them half an hour after I needed them” Mrs Hooper thanked, sending a look to Mr Holmes as if to say “Don’t mention the last receptionist”. Instead of mentioning the last receptionist, Mr Holmes rolled his eyes.
As the first class of the day was always the most exciting, Mr Holmes decided to do an experiment. The year 11s had their GCSE’s coming up at the end of the year and needed a break from their constant whittling and worrying. Mr Holmes demonstrated a particle that the students did in year 10, making them write down notes on it so it counted as revision.
“Molly, I have the diagrams of the human body you wanted for fourth period.” Mr Watson said from behind his binder of paperwork. He walked over and set the binder down on the coffee table and searched through the paperwork to find the sheets. Mr Holmes saw sheets from other lessons with post-it-notes on them with “Mr Johnstone, Geography, period four” and “Miss Campbell, maths, fourth period” written on them. Mr Watson was delivering the paperwork now, during break (the time he had off) instead of during period 3 and 4. He’s getting it all done now so that he would have time to go and see Mr Holmes’ lesson.
“Ah, good morning. Mr Holmes, is it?” Mr Watson’s voice was rather croaky, like he’d been up until 1 am the previous night screaming out the lyrics in an attempt to do some karaoke. Though Mr Holmes knew that this wasn’t the case, Mr Watson would’ve had much larger bags than the ones currently there on his face (probably due to waking up so early).
Mr Watson started to get tired, he hated to admit it, but it was because of how old he was. Miss Hooper was beginning to feel the same, so they took a break by the food table.
“Now, as much as I’m enjoying this, I do need to breathe” He said between breaths. John could still feel Sherlock’s lips on his, the feeling fading slowly, a feeling that he missed too quickly. John was also breathless, the kiss took his breath away in more ways than one.
Miss Hooper didn’t reply, and instead walked over to the centre of the hall. She being bopping to the music, looking awkward, Mr Watson began to join in. Suddenly, the pair started to be more comfortable with the music and danced among the students for a good half an hour.
“No, but I have just spotted a strange shape hovering in the corner over there. I’m almost certain that there isn’t any other 6 foot tall vampires in the school.” She said, Mr Watson followed her line of sight until his eyes landed on the mysterious figure in the corner. She was right, it did look a lot like Mr Holmes, that or a prop that suddenly appeared. He decided to go and investigate. Miss Hooper spotted one of her teacher friends on the dance floor and went to speak to them instead.
“Nice to see that you were bothered to show up, want some punch?” He said, offering the other man one of his glasses.
Mr Holmes could hear the students coming and leaving for their next class down the corridor, the walls were the opposite of soundproof.. He knew that somewhere in the chaos of the footsteps was Mr Watson. The class filled in and took their seats, there was no sign of Mr Watson. Mr Holmes knew that he couldn’t wait for Mr Watson to come, so he started his class. He went through the information about the practical that he was doing and began to set the equipment up. He dragged it out as much as he could, making the students draw a diagram of the apparatus. He had to give in and do the practical eventually. So he put on his safety glasses and set up the safety screen.
Mr Watson was excited for the Halloween party, even though there will be students there. Mr Watson has a secret passion for dancing, and rarely gets to exhibit it in front of others, he hopes that this party will give him an excuse to show off his dance moves and impress Mr Holmes. He didn’t like to imagine that the only reason why he was excited for the party was because Mr Holmes was going to be there, but it was the only logical reason he could come up with. No one knew or needed to know that Mr Holmes was the only reason, or part of the reason, why he was going anyway.
“You thought wrong,” he retorted. It was always easier for Mr Holmes to tell people that they were wrong about assuming parts of his personality than explaining to them how he really felt. Why would he people the pleasure of knowing what he thought about?
Staff in other departments are often gossiping about the science department, Mr Holmes is known for his ability to read anyone’s life story by just looking at them and it doesn’t help that he is called the “hottest teacher”. Many female staff members are often caught off guard by his looks and end up being insulted as he reads their horrible life stories out loud in a crowded corridor full of drama-hungry students. New staff members are warned about how they come across to Mr Holmes, they do not want to scare away anyone because their best science teacher is also their best asshole.
Soon enough, the party rolled around. Mr Holmes applied his fake blood, Miss Hooper adjusted her fairy wings and Mr Watson brushed his wig. There was music coming from the assembly hall, songs currently in the charts were being played at the loudest volume the speakers could handle. Mr Holmes and Mr Watson knew this was going to be a good night, but for completely different reasons.
Miss Campbell was nearby too, she was the one from maths who always complained because he had better things to show off at the open evenings compared to her. It’s not his fault that students are more interested in watching explosions than Pythagoras’ theorem of bullshit (Mr Holmes actually likes Pythagoras’ theories, but he still doesn’t see how they’re more entertaining than a lovely controlled experiment where things blow up). He should probably attempt to apologize to her as he would be spending every Thursday break and lunch close by.
“Tell that to the last science department.” Snarked Anderson from the sofa to his left, gaining a giggle from Donovan.
The staff room was the same it has been for the past 10 years Mr Holmes has worked at Watterford. Miss Hooper was eating her salad (bought from the schools cafeteria, cheese and chicken caesar salad), talking to Mr Stamford, who was eating his pasta from home, about the latest progression that NASA has made towards putting a man on Mars. Mr Anderson and Miss Donovan were not present at the table and instead were sat down on the sofa, drinking coffee (Mr Holmes deduced that they were both on their 4th cup of the day).
Soon enough, the party rolled around. Mr Holmes applied his fake blood, Miss Hooper adjusted her fairy wings and Mr Watson brushed his wig. There was music coming from the assembly hall, songs currently in the charts were being played at the loudest volume the speakers could handle. Mr Holmes and Mr Watson knew this was going to be a good night, but for completely different reasons.
John couldn’t tell why exactly all he saw was white when he opened his eyes again. His mind didn’t seemed to be working as well as it was normally. His head was pounding with an unbelievable strength that made it hard to concentrate. How could he concentrate when he felt like this? Sherlock would normally say something smart and tell him to pay attention to his surroundings, eliminate the impossible and whatever remains must be the truth, or something along those lines. John knew that he wasn’t dead, death would mean that he would no longer feel pain. He knew that there was no longer a bullet lodged in his shoulder, so he must of had it removed. The brightness of the room he was in could be because he hasn’t seen any light for the past few days, and for the white, well, he must be in a hospital.
“I’m alright, I’m alright.” Mr Holmes says as he slowly stands up and faces Miss Hooper. He smiles, turns back to the students and says “And that is why you wear safety goggles and use a protection screen. Anyway, Miss Hooper, what brings you here to my lesson?”
As the students began to fill up the room, Mr Watson left, his attempt to avoid the students walking in corridors was successful. He delivered the rest of his paperwork and was back at the front of the school by half an hour to period 4. He was about to walk into his office when he saw Deputy Head Lestrade stood outside of his door.
Mr Watson went and delivered the papers to Miss Campbell. He wanted to avoid walking through the corridors when the students moved to their next lesson so he took some time to get the papers out of his binder in Miss Campbell’s room and struck up a conversation with her. He asked about the topic that the worksheets were for. She explained how the students wanted to do their own maths posters for the open evening and how she’ll be disappointed when most of the students go down to watch Mr Holmes’ practicals instead spending time at all of the subjects. Mr Watson laughed at the idea of Mr Holmes having his classroom packed with kids and parents, causing controlled explosions that would make the whole room jump.
“You’re on, Watson” Sherlock said, as the rest of the soldiers moved to the sides of the table, allowing the two to face off in yet another game.
Mr Watson and Mr Holmes plans to impressive one another does not work out as well as they thought it would. Notes at the end of the chapter
Mycroft was the first to speak and break the silence that settled in the room. "This is the new office member, John Watson. He'll be organising any resources you need or school trips you want planning. Please, be willing to take advantage of his superb set of skills, he has worked for many different schools in his past."
Mr Holmes walked away without another word, leaving Mr Watson behind. Mr Holmes did not feel the same as he normally did when he turned on his heels to stride away, he felt like staying. He instantly shrugged off the feeling, blaming it on the cold outside making his head numb, making him think weirdly. But Mr Holmes was not the only one who was affected by the cold, Mr Watson had just been exposed to the freezing temperatures of Mr Holmes’ heart for the first time, and it intrigued him.
The hall was bustling with people and music, the songs didn’t seem to stop. The students were standing in their groups, some in the centre of the room, dancing to the music, and some by the food table, grabbing what they could before more people came. Mr Watson was standing close to the food table, every now and then picking at the chicken nuggets which were laid out. There were a few teachers coming up to get plates every so often, but no one really stayed around long enough for a proper conversation. He keep checking the door, as if he was waiting for someone, and felt disappointed when he saw that no one interesting had walked in.
“Okay, good, I’ve also decided return home. I’m becoming a consulting detective, it’s a job I invented before I went into the Army and I want to start it up again. I know some people from Scotland Yard who will let me in on some of their cases. I know a landlady in central London, Mrs Hudson, she’s a delight. She’ll give me a good offer on a flat and I was wondering if you wanted to move in? I understand if you don’t want to but I thought it would be best as you’re still healing and I could keep an eye on you.” John was going to stop Sherlock but he couldn’t find a suitable time to stop the “consulting detective” from blabbering on.
“Yes, Miss Hooper?” Mr Holmes responded, not seeing the use of first names on school property, he believed that such in-formalities were best left to social gatherings outside of the school’s premises, not like he would attend any gatherings with these people anyway.
“Well, that’s Sherlock for you.” He replied, “Want to dance? Just to pass the time.” He seriously needed to dance, if Mr Holmes was coming then he needed to have the excuse of being tired to be able to talk to him.
“Well, I’m sure that you have already been told that this school is not like others that you’ve worked at”
To Mr Holmes’ distress, this meant a day without Mr Watson. Mr Holmes hated to admit it but he had a feeling that he wanted to impress Mr Watson. It was like whenever they were in the same room he would try and get his attention. He wanted them to conversate more but he didn’t want to show everyone else that he had taken interest in someone.
“I think that you’re the first person who I’ve ever loved” Sherlock said. John’s breath hitched in his throat, he saw Sherlock leaning to close the small gap between them but he did nothing to stop him, instead he leaned in too.
“Ah, John, there you are. Where have you been?” Lestrade asked, looking like it was unexpected for someone with his job to actually be doing the work.
The halloween party was going to be a bore. Teachers were only asked to attend to watch over the students and make sure that they weren’t drinking alcohol. Though, as they were there for two hours they decided to embarrass the students by dancing in a circle and sometimes getting on the stage and singing. Mr Holmes knew that one of the history teachers was in a band and would sometimes play.
Mr Watson made his way to the corner gradually, he didn’t want to seem too eager to see Mr Holmes, though, there was not many places to hide in an open hall. He decided to just go and see him when he got bored of talking to anyone who was close by. He grabbed two glasses of punch from the table next to the food and made his way over. Mr Holmes looked up to him when he was about ten feet away, looking surprised to see him there.
The two of them cleared up the mess in silence. Mr Holmes focused on collecting up the broken glass and other bits of objects which had moved positions during the experiment. Miss Hooper washed down the screen and cleaned any of the equipment that wasn’t shattered into a million pieces. Miss Hooper left him half way through lunch so that she could eat her school-bought salad, Mr Holmes adjusted his stool back to its original position and sat down. He heard footsteps coming down the corridor again. A short pang of shock coursed through him as the footsteps came past his door and down the corridor, the pace did not change when it passed, whoever it was wasn’t thinking of him. He felt almost as if he was wanting those footsteps to belong to someone who was coming to visit him, as if he wanted someone’s company, as if he wanted them to belong to Mr Watson.
He decided to walk out, slightly disappointed that he didn’t get to have a good conversation with Mr Holmes. He returned back to the front of the school and took a seat at his desk. He had done all of his work for the day so he emailed Greg to ask if he had anything that needs doing. To his luck, Greg had asked him to sort out the staff duty schedule for the year, the receptionist who was off was meant to do it and Clara already has enough work.
Mr Holmes was going this year, he was going because Mr Watson was going. He had no idea what Mr Watson was dressing up as, more importantly, he had no idea what he was going as. Miss Hooper suggested that he could go as a vampire (as it “suits his cheekbones”) and Mr Holmes decided to go with her idea as he left it too late to think of anything better.
“Looking for me?” He stepped into where Mr Watson could see him. Mr Watson sighed even louder than he had a moment before, he looked at Mr Holmes, pursed his lips then shrugged.
“You? He wants to see your class? Why would he want to see you?” Donovan seemed to want to join the conversation now.
“Hey, I’m alive. That’s all that matters. We’re both here, don’t be sorry for anything” John tried to sound sincere, as he wasn’t used to dealing with Sherlock and emotions at the same time.
Mr Holmes arrived late, as promised. He walked in through the doors and observed his surroundings. Various staff members and students were hanging around the food table, looking like they were waiting for more food to be brought out. There were some students requesting songs at the DJ booth and Mrs Hem’s band getting ready to perform on the stage. All of the music was directed one towards one place - the dance floor. The dance floor which currently held host to a dance circle, centred by Miss Hooper and Mr Watson. The pair looked like they had been dancing for a while now, sweat was dripping down both of their foreheads. Mr Holmes decided to stay clear of the dance floor, he knew that trying to dance would be a catastrophe. Instead, he stationed himself by the corner of the room. His costume was scary and the corner was rather dark, people would just assume that he was a prop if he stayed still long enough.
Mr Holmes knew that if Mr Watson was going to come into one of his classes then he would look for the one that would be the most interesting. He only had three classes out of the five lesson slots, one for each year, period 1,2 and 4. He saw Mr Watson was not doing any work when he saw him in the morning, so would most probably be working period 1. The teachers are meant to send Mr Watson sheets that they need printing out in colour (as the school is cheap and only has black and white colour printers in its departments) by the morning, so he would deliver the sheets during period two and three. Leaving period 4 as the best time for Mr Watson to come, meaning that he had a bunch of year 10s plus an receptionist in his lesson. He focused on his first and second period before paying any thought into how he was going to impress Mr Watson, he had third period to think of a plan.
Today Mr Holmes wasn’t alone. It came as a shock to him, it was like he was programmed to start hearing noise as soon as Mrs Jakobs, the art teacher, normally comes in 10 minutes after he does. Today someone was in before Mr Holmes himself. that someone was none other than Mr Watson.
It didn’t take long before bullets started to fire at the base. No one screamed and instead began shouted commands at each other. Soldiers stood by the windows, shooting back at the attackers and others were taking shelter behind anything they could. The table was now turned on its side, the cards scattered across the floor. John took shelter behind the cupboards. Normally these things would pass after a few minutes, but this time it was different, the shots weren’t getting less aggressive.
John sat down at the table in the current base they were staying at. They had been there for around four months now, it was almost starting to seem like a home. The table was occupied by others who were wearing the same uniform as John, they all smiled towards him as he took a seat. He noticed that one his closest friends in the base eyes lingered on him for longer than the rest. They were all just finishing up their game of cards.
This new member of staff, John Watson, glanced over at Mr Holmes, almost as if he could tell that he was the person he should watch out for. Mr Holmes responded with an identical look. as if to say "you're going to regret coming here".
“John, you’re awake. Oh thank the Lord. I was so worried, I thought I had lost you. I’m so sorry.” Sherlock struggled to get all of his words out as he was speaking so fast.
He spent the next hour organising and allocating areas of the school to teachers at break and lunch in a two week time table. He must admit, he was placing the teachers who he has come to dislike or find annoying as far away from the front office as he can and outside so that they would get cold in the winter. It was petty, but he enjoyed doing it. He put Miss Campbell from maths close to the office on a Wednesday break and lunch as he had enjoyed her company in the past.
“Oh, John is just fine. At the other schools I’ve worked at everyone prefers to call the receptionists by their first names.”
“Hope it all goes well this time, I’ll see you later.” And with that it was just Mr Watson alone again, waiting to greet the next face he sees come through the door.
“Sherlock, you’ve really got it figured out. I suppose I will need a place to stay after I’m discharged. I’ll be happy to stay with you until I find somewhere permanent. Just don’t give me any chemical poisoning and I should be fine.” John knew it was a risk, living with Sherlock Holmes, but he had no choice as his family still hadn’t shown up.
So I saw that I got 35 hits on my last chapter and wanted to write more because I actually love writing this.
Mr Watson is the newest addition the the ever growing staff team. He works in the office at the front of the school, handels the teachers paperwork and organises anything that they need doing. Of course he is warned about Mr Holmes and the rest of the science department in his acceptance email, but he does not think too much of it. Mr Watson has worked in various schools during his career, and has worked with various assholes and departments where the staff members do not get along. What Mr Watson hasn’t done is over-estimate how much of a challenge this new school will be for him.
John sighed, he knew that he couldn’t argue with Sherlock over his experiments, even if they were a slight threat to the rest of the soldiers.
“Yes, and I’ve been told that you’re the reason for that, Mr Holmes. I hope that your chemistry lessons prove to be as promising as they sound, I’m doing a lesson tour today to see what I’m up against.” Mr Watson spoke, almost with a slight ounce of teasing in his voice. People have been telling him about the Mr Holmes’ lessons. Students normally make his lessons sound better than they actually are to make their friends who are taught by Anderson jealous. Mr Holmes felt like he needed to make his lesson meet the standards that Mr Watson is expecting, actually, he wants to prove Mr Watson wrong. When he walks into Mr Holmes’ classroom he is going to be blown away.
The first class off the day was always the most exciting. The second class was when students began to get hungry, they thought more about what they would buy from the cafeteria more than they thought about chemistry. This was the same for the fourth class, which was before lunch. The third and fifth class were normally the chilled out ones, Mr Holmes normally had year 11s or 10s in those slots, so they were familiar with him and gossiped to him about other teachers.
Other footsteps came and went, Mr Holmes’ thoughts did the same thing. He couldn’t seem to concentrate on anything he put his mind to, so he decided to retire to his mind palace. He knew that it was dangerous to do in school, you were never sure of who could sneak into your classroom, or who could be talking to you about something important. The science department knew that he was practically unreachable when he was in this state of mind, and sadly, Mr Watson did not.
It only took one day for Mr Holmes to recover enough to return to working. Sleeping for the whole day was something that he apparently needed judging by the amount of energy he now had. He got to the school earlier than normal and earlier than Mr Watson so he decided to wait for him. He hated to admit it but he wanted Mr Watson’s attention. It didn’t matter if it was in a room of a thousand people or a room with just the two of them, Mr Watson would be the only one who he would pay attention to.
“There’s a new staff member starting at the office today.” Miss Hooper said, with a slight maddening glint in her eye.
And then all of a sudden, the staff room in the science department changed. The atmosphere changed alongside the amount of people in the room. The door opened to reveal someone who Mr Holmes had never seen before accompanied by his older brother, Mycroft. He had a jumper on (not formal enough to be a teacher), with plain black trousers (sitting down job) and stood up tall (showing confidence but was breathing fast, he was nervous but didn't want to show it). He was the new office worker.
“Look, Sherlock, just because most office workers don’t blow things up for a living, it doesn’t make them boring or less respectful compared to you.” Mr Holmes sighed at the mention of his first name, he really hated it being used in front of Anderson and Donovan.
The office was opposite the doors, he would need to be near his brother and the lovely office workers. He had most probably been rude to everyone who sits in that office, so he would need to be friendly to the teachers who were coming back from lunch if he wanted to be entertained. He, sadly, wasn’t allowed to escape from the boring aspects of duty and retreat into his mind palace, he would miss any younger students who tried to escape through the lunch doors to hang out with their older friends.
It was the same as any other day in the base. There was people coming into the first aid room for minor issues, people were playing cards and laughing at the table and you could smell a few strange fumes from the chemical room.
Soon enough, John was discharged from the hospital and took residence with Sherlock Holmes in 221B Baker Street. Mrs Hudson was a delight, she took extra care of John and would always bring up nice treats for the pair to snack on. Sherlock’s brother would also visit every now and them, to annoy them with his constant eye watching over Sherlock, which seemed to grow stronger now that he’s solving crimes. A Detective Inspector from Scotland Yard was also a frequent visitor, giving Sherlock new crimes. John had managed to spark a friendship with him, even though Sherlock mainly had a professional relationship with him.
“Oh John, thank god you’re here, I was worried that no one interesting would be here since Sherlock’s late.” She huffed, Mr Watson still found it weird hearing Mr Holmes being referred to as ‘Sherlock’, but he went with it anyway.
“Oh you’re awake, I’ll ring up your family and that curly haired bloke that keeps visiting” The nurse said as he entered the room. He also offered John a glass of water, which he didn’t know he needed until the nurse offered it.
He could sense that Mr Holmes was not a social person, even though he was a teacher. It wasn’t that he minded social interaction, he just preferred not to early in the morning. Mr Watson couldn’t blame him, he felt the same before his first cup of coffee.  He figured that’s the way Mr Holmes is; punctual. So it, naturally, came as a surprise to Mr Watson when he did not see Mr Holmes coming through the doors of Watterford Academy. Instead of Mr Holmes, Mr Watson was greeted by Headmaster Holmes.
Mr Watson also had to assign himself a duty position. He choose to do morning duties by the main doors every morning. He was the first person there and had nothing better to do. But that meant that he would need to greet everyone and most probably engage in a few conversations about something school related, he had to have his fingers in a lot of subject pies to keep up with his job. The drama department need him quite often, not that he minds, as do the geography (for school trips, mostly) and science departments.
John tried to keep his eyes open, he tried to fix his vision on Sherlock’s face. For all he knows, he could die now, and Sherlock’s thing would be the last thing he would see. He took in every detail of it; the cheekbones, the eyes the colour of what he imagined heaven to look like. His eyes began closing, he tried to reach out for Sherlock, who now had his arms wrapped around him, putting pressure on the wound and protecting him from other bullets.
The work was hard. Clara had showed him what to do and he had gotten the hang of it, but it was hard because as the minutes went on, he was missing out on viewing Mr Holmes’ class. He heard the bell for fourth period ring, and he sighed, knowing that Mr Holmes was starting his lesson. This gave him some fuel to work harder, and he managed to complete the work within and hour, like Lestrade had said, giving him 30 minutes to go and watch the remainder of Mr Holmes’ class.
“Sherlock, are you awake?” He talked a little bit louder, almost certain that Mr Holmes would have woken up if he had been asleep. So he must be ignoring him. It was plausible, he did just nearly make his head blow off, and with Mr Holmes’ cold reputation he wouldn’t put it past him.
John didn’t think he could breathe. The writing wasn’t the same as the article, but he couldn’t seem to mind because he had noticed him. William... had noticed him, he was impressed by him even, and he hadn’t mentioned the not so subtle attraction John had for him and for that he was thankful. The bell echoed and John went to his first class. Now he was more curious about who William was then ever. It could be his lab partner, Jake, or someone in his gym class. It could be anyone. As he passed people in the halls he looked at them a little closer hoping he would see something on one of them that screamed to him, but there was nothing. He finally made it to his anatomy class. The note was safely tucked in his back pocket folded into a nice little square.
“I don’t beg” Sherlock moaned as John continued to trail down his neck with his lip and teeth. John paused
“This isn’t some scandal with your wife we’re talkin’ about, this is his… his life, this isn’t some juicy secret he’s keepin’ from everyone.” Lestrareds eyebrows raised.
Sherlock scrambled to get his laptop from his bag and sat it down on the bed in front of him. As soon as he opened the lip the familiar sound of an incoming call rang through the room. He clicked it hesitantly, John’s face popped up instantly
John and Sherlock talk a little more, Sherlock make a distinction from himself and William in his head. It's a good time.
He was in a bit of a bad mood because his piano lesson had been cut back an hour to fit the practice into his schedule. He had worked himself up about meeting his new instructor who would no doubt judge him for his sluggish ways. He opened the door to the small personal gym and was met with a surprise. As far as royalty goes Mycroft was by no means spoiled, and he was expecting a personal trainer, but he was expecting someone a little bit older than the man he was met with.
“You and Lestrade were talking about it, goodbye John.” it took a moment for John to take in the information. When he did, he turned around and walked over to his usual table where everyone greeted him.
Today they were working on Feinting, it was a pretty basic move, but because of the footwork, something Mycroft lacked at, it was a move he couldn’t perfect. It started off fine, but after he tripped over his own feet for the 10th time he got frustrated and began jabbing a Gregory with no technique, and was quickly defeated by the professional.
“Fine, ill pull the car up.” John started to panic how was he going to warn his sister. Their parents would come bursting into the cafe and cause a scene, possibly even get Harry fired.
The cold London air hit John’s face but did nothing to cool his temper. And he barely rounded the corner before he whipped around staggering just slightly.
“Do you need a phone to call your parents or something, because you can borrow mine if you’d like.” The smile on Sherlock's face feel instantly
He was just as curious as anyone else was about this secret William, but he had a different reason than anyone else. The boy was head over heals. The way William was with words made his mouth water and when he had revealed that the popular head cheerleader was dating three guys at once, John knew. He needs to find this William and see if he was as perfect in person as he was on paper.
