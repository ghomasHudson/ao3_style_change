Sherlock inhales.
As a result of his confused haste, water had sloshed over the edge of the tub and was currently drenching the floor mat.
At the same time, the way the all-consuming bass beat seemed to pulse through his very bones felt like revival, and watching the crowd of amateur dancers move as one being was akin to a renaissance painting. The immediate excess of sensory input made him recall not-unpleasant clubbing experiences of his university years.
Sherlock swears that he’s imagining that there is hope seeping through the question.
it. There was no damage to the photograph itself, I assure you. I –” Sherlock closed his eyes, hating himself, hating the shaking timber of his voice, how its usual smoothness had been abandoned, the rich baritone pitched several tones higher in distress. A voice dreadfully reminiscent of Mycroft’s echoed in the back of his mind.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says, seemingly out of the blue. He loathes to think that his determined avoidance could have prevented that from ever happening again. Could’ve meant they never even
“Yeah, actually – I can’t think of a single thing to say.”
In the aftermath of his date with John, Sherlock needs a little bit of Irene's logic.
In an effort to distract himself from the feeling of impending disaster, he looks down at the paper bag he’s been clutching absentmindedly, sliding the croissant towards its opening to take a bite. It’s only then that he notices the writing on the other side of the bag.
A glance at Mike and a shared smile that verges on beaming.
She has good reason for treating him a little icily, Sherlock privately admits. He’s spent a week avoiding her with the single-minded determination of someone attempting to keep particularly sensational gossip from their chronically nosy best friend. So it’s a small victory that he can, at least, decipher her intentions. Sherlock often finds that to be half the battle in their conversations.
After sitting for long enough that his breathing has stabilised and his neck starts to ache, Sherlock decides that he really should go home. He takes a moment to soak in the rustle of worn pages and students adjusting themselves in uncomfortable chairs as they settle in for a long night of cramming. His footfalls echo in the stairwell.
“If it had bothered me, I would’ve said something.”
“Irene Adler, I am not a shy twelve-year-old who needs to learn how to make friends and ‘branch out’,” he interrupts her curtly. “If you’ll recall, that’s never worked too well for me.”
Although he truly hadn’t thought it possible, being in the heart of the crowd was worse the second time around. It seemed that Sherlock’s reprieve from it, however short-lived, had reacclimatised him to the notion of personal space.
For an instant, they stared into one another’s eyes, weighing the significance of each argument.
No, best not to think of that yet, that far off time that seemed so removed from reality in the near pitch black of the night. The moon was suspiciously absent.
“I’d like that very much.”
Sherlock mused. John may have sometimes viewed him as more than he was, as someone who never forgot anything and who could process unlimited amounts of information in an instant, but that wasn’t true. In spite of his best efforts, he was just a man. Granted, he was equipped with a sharp eidetic memory and the ability to make rapid deductions based on available information he had trained himself to understand – but he also regularly made mistakes.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I assume you’ve spoken with Element’s security guards?”
“What do you mean by –? Wait, so why… if the killer hadn’t intended me –?”
John looked away, missing the slight and fleeting way that Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. He cleared his throat. “How did it happen, then?”
When John next managed to reopen his eyes, following an extended period of attempting to get his breath back, he was blessed with the sight of his flatmate reclining at the other end of the bathtub. Hand slick with what he assumed was fresh conditioner and the remnants of John’s own come, Sherlock was working himself at a pace just short of feverish. His eyes were heavily lidded and his head tilted upwards, exposing the enticing column of his alabaster neck. A vein jumped in it, the blood within pounding along to the symphony the two men had unwittingly begun to create together.
God, it would’ve been so much easier if Lestrade had just given him his own earpiece, the git.
“Oh, I do hope you’ll reconsider, William. I promise I can be very persuasive.” The woman’s grin widened, seeming to glitter with the threat of thirty-two knives – or, perhaps, just one. And a blowtorch.
John looks up at him with a beckoning smile and their fingertips don’t quite brush as Sherlock takes the cup by its saucer. There is a foam leaf swirling in the milk on top.
Sherlock turned to the first woman nearest to him who was mostly unoccupied and pliant enough to turn away from the people dancing with her. They were clearly not particularly close friends of hers.
“You’re studying
of time and effort for me to wrap my head around. Studying anything further on purpose is an achievement to me.”
“I get that your name is important to you,” John says slowly, thinking of Harry. Thinking of how she fought with every relative who called her Harriet as a child. How she railed against the name and everything she thought it stood for. “I don’t give a damn what you’re called. I’ll call you whatever you want me to, as long as I can
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes,” Sherlock said, his voice a mixture of distaste at the name and satisfaction at finding the answer. John suspected that he was at least a little pleased at the killer’s modus operandi revolving around him, as well.
“Er – yes.”
They share soft, secretive smiles, their appreciation for the company and the conversation going unnamed but not unacknowledged. Then Sherlock packs away his books with a rustle while John shuffles over to the counter, the dishes that await him in mind.
“No problem. Any sugar?” John glances up with a hint of a grin forming. Not the fake, just-smile-through-the-pain-Watson expression he uses to remind himself that he needs this job, but a sincere one.
“Do you have
The barista nods in response, bagging one before taking the appropriate sum. “Maybe you’re secretly a sweet
“For how long?”
There’s a beat of silence before John snorts with laughter and begins shaking his head. He chuckles to himself for a moment, looking at the ground.
Just as he began to determine the best way to get away from the woman without causing a scene, she moved her neck aside in the same swift movement as her hands rose to grip the nape of his own. He had barely enough time to register what was happening, as she pulled his head down towards her newly-exposed jugular. With a sharp inhale of heavy, oxygen-deprived air, he realised that she was trying to force him to kiss her.
There's an undeniable spark in Sherlock and John's first real conversation.
you, but she’ll also be inside at the same time as you both.”
John doesn’t just offer token statements, either – a habit Mrs. Hudson gets into sometimes. As much as Sherlock loves her, there’s only so many times he can stand an
He often finds that at 6 a.m., baristas are only half awake themselves. The possibility of this rises almost exponentially in direct correlation to the increased proximity of the coffee shop to the university, and the decreasing age of the barista. The younger they are and the closer to the university, the more likely Sherlock will be forced to stand and wait far longer than necessary while a clueless barista calls out a name that holds no resemblance to his own.
Was it crazy that John was actually very thankful and a little bit proud of his friend’s doing so? Yes. Yes, probably.
“You were incapacitated last night and I hadn’t the strength nor the resolve to carry you to your own room. Since I had no intention of sleeping myself, it seemed prudent to leave you here. No need to read into it.”
At times such as these, Sherlock was reminded how much he truly appreciated John. Not just as someone who retrieved miscellaneous items for him or paid cab drivers or forced him to eat or sleep, and not even as his closest and most trusted friend, a person who understood his methods and his quirks like no other. During long or convoluted cases that dragged on and pushed him to his physical and mental limits, John was always there, encouraging him to rethink the information available to them, to reconsider the killer’s motives or methods, and reminding him of their ultimate goal. Unlike Lestrade or Donovan, John didn’t view him as an instrument through which the case could be solved and the criminal apprehended, but as a person who, like him, was trying to save people.
Is it worth sullying all they have and all they could have been, purely for the benefit of his own selfishness?
For a moment, they stood still, looking everywhere but at each other. Then the press and surge of those around them became too strong a force to content with, an elbow into John’s back knocking him forward a step, and a high heel onto Sherlock’s foot compelling him into movement. Soon they were dancing together, and it was somehow both the easiest thing in the world and a task that required the most amount of self-control Sherlock could ever recall exerting. Every inch between them had to be fought for, the crowd vulture-like in its quest for more space.
“And what’s wrong with the landline?” Mike sounds only peripherally interested, despite already wondering what exactly Sherlock is playing at.
Sherlock nodded meekly, collected his phone and left the room, hesitating for just a moment before gently shutting the door.
“There’s a theory,” Sherlock says calmly, as if resuming an existing conversation, despite their silence until this point.
“The theory holds that we essentially grow into our names. It’s almost a fatalistic approach, the idea that when our parents name us, they’re giving us a personality, a story, something we can’t escape unless we pick a new name for ourselves. And that’s– that’s an act of reincarnation, where we’ve surveyed how language acts and what names mean in our native tongue, and we’ve decided to rewrite our own story.”
“What is it?” Sherlock was glad Donovan had the sense to skip her usual show of bravado.
“Morning, what can I get for you?”
, John mentally continues, chuckling under his breath. A moment later he holds a paper bag out for Sherlock to take.
“Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
“Hi.” She spoke up to him a little shyly. The words were lost to the music, but the movement of her lips was easily discernible.
he hears Irene’s voice say pointedly.
John innocently looks up at the building while Sherlock unlocks the door. Starts a sentence about it being nice, or having character, or some such irrelevancy.
His thoughts then shifted to the possibility of himself being the next victim. He was unable to stop his mind from filling with the image of himself, laying in an alleyway with his shirt torn off, his eyes wide and unseeing and a large, jagged H burnt into his chest. To an extent, he thought that he was already invisibly branded with the name of Holmes: memories came to him of the way Donovan and Anderson had looked at him at his first case, as if he were a freak by mere association with Sherlock; of Mycroft standing in a dank warehouse saying,
“Yes, it’s frankly astounding how little –”
Amidst the silence, John brushes his thumb against Sherlock’s hand where they’re clasped together. A bolt of static travels up Sherlock’s arm in response.
Being embarrassed in the company of Sherlock Holmes was worse than having an entire stadium full of people laughing at you. At least the crowd would be neither as annoyingly gorgeous nor as dickishly intelligent as him.
and flatmate, and that was all.
The past few weeks had been particularly restrictive on his more primitive urges, as a slew of unexpectedly baffling, dramatic cases had been brought to Sherlock’s attention and were apparently deemed worthy of his intellect. Ever a faithful assistant and friend, John had followed, questioning and rethinking, nudging Sherlock towards the occasional bite of toast or cup of tea.
he wonders again. Blinks a few times for good measure.
“You think it’s me but I don’t believe you.”
John tried to ignore just how correct she was.
A quiet beat passes in which Sherlock blissfully relives the feeling of John’s lips on his, John’s scent filling his nose, John’s hands holding him, one on his cheek and the other on his bicep. One perfectly simple moment where his attention had distilled down to a single point and everything was
How ridiculous that is.
Sherlock tears his gaze from a lone dog-walker in the distance and focuses on his best friend. His eyes ask the question he refuses to voice.
“No. I daresay it will be hot inside, anyway.”
“Alright, boss. We’ll be in touch.” Donovan tapped the earpiece attached to her for surveillance and started walking. She would be the link between the inspector and the interior of the club, as they had neither enough evidence for legal access to its security footage nor the blessing of the owner to view it.
pharmacodynamics
Too soon, he had reached them. Forgoing words, he raised his eyebrows, with an expression like concrete gracing his face.
His eyes positively glittered with silent mirth.
“Gabriel?”
“John?” A sudden gust of wind threatens to carry his voice away before John can hear him, but they’re standing too close for it to matter.
Getting lost in the music was far too easy, and if he didn’t concentrate on preventing it, he was in danger of having it consume him. Halfway across to the spot he had aimed to reach, the beat changed mid-song. The application of diminution saw it pound into double time and take Sherlock’s self control with it. Before he knew it, he wasn’t just inching sideways a little awkwardly, while he carefully calculated each motion to match the song’s rhythm: he was dancing.
“You’re saying he was … interested in me?” John said slowly. He cursed himself for his childlike tone, as if he had just been told a long-held secret of the universe.
Sherlock only nodded his head and turned away, John moving to follow him not long after.
“This is so – this is ridiculous, you know that right?” He’s addressing his shoes and Sherlock doesn’t know what to make of it. He can’t tell if John’s tone is closed off and cold, or understanding and giving him the benefit of the doubt.
“Sorry, it’s in my coat.”
For an instant, he missed the comfort of his Belstaff. And John.
He finds himself completely entranced by this wonderful man, who actually invites questions, as eager to give knowledge as to absorb it.
He had been such an idiot to go along with the plan.
“Just tell me what happened after you left the restaurant. Did you go anywhere else? A bar for drinks? A spur-of-the-moment movie? Supper with his flatmate?”
For all that he enjoys silence and solitude, he takes pleasure in being able to make an impression with something so simple as a name.
“John, there’s something… I should say, I-I’ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now.”
Sherlock is suddenly very conscious of the fact that they’re in public.
Halloween may have been two weeks ago, but every time I read this ending I involuntarily reenact a ghost impression.
“My mother would never exhibit such bad taste as to name me
There’s a change in tone when Sherlock finishes this that makes it sound like a question mark, like he’s inviting a response. He surprises himself with it. He’s not used to conversation like this, to wanting to hear a voice other than the one in his head when he’s speaking of something he’s passionate about.
Harry used to say he could be a little intense at the most inconvenient of times.
Sherlock wondered distantly what the cabbie would’ve thought of the two of them, with John in his current state. As he fumbled for his keys while one arm remained a stabilising force around his friend, his distracted mind answered him automatically.
“What?”
Irene speaks: “Was it hot?”
Does a name matter, really?
It wouldn’t be such a bother, really, if baristas were capable of using their brains – or, more accurately, their ears. How difficult is
The automatic doors open behind them as a student exits the library and, with a jolt, Sherlock steps back just far enough that both of their hands fall beside them. He clears his throat but John remains unbothered, simply waiting, watching for any clue as to the particular neurons firing behind Sherlock’s eyes.
“The killer had stabbed up and under her ribcage, tearing her phrenic nerve.” John glanced away from his friend and their methodical discussion of such violent acts, suddenly feeling as though his breakfast might be disagreeing with him. The phrenic nerve controls a person’s diaphragm, which in turn manages the lungs’ ability to breathe. Lacerating the nerve would not only require strength, but also, it was likely, the precision of medical training. The thought of a medical professional, who had taken the Hippocratic oath, performing such an act made him feel sick to his stomach. “The S was believed to have been inflicted ante-mortem, due to the amount and consistency of blood.”
Sherlock knows who’s at the door before he sees them.
“Oh, you … you told him about me?” John’s brain feels sluggish; he curses its lethargy in the presence of this man’s mysterious omniscience.
Each bright jingle of the bell above the door, and every dawning realisation that he should check on the few other customers still hanging around, makes John seem to start with a physical tremor, like he’s shaking himself awake from a dream. He is, really – in his own mind. Sitting with this man, having the chance to talk to him, feels like a blessing; like time and fate have conspired to grant him this gifted company. John’s worried that this beautiful, witty enigma of a man might realise at any moment that it’s just John he’s talking to – John, who doesn’t own any posh coats like the one he wore the other morning, and doesn’t know the first thing about Gödel’s theorems.
“Yes, I – Yes.” Sherlock steeled himself and nodded. Unable to continue looking at the concern on her face, he returned to his search. “Have you seen John?”
The soft, reassuring hand in his makes him push it away, keeps him moving without a hitch in his stride.
Sherlock grabs his food and turns to leave, though his progress is halted by Molly’s voice. “By the way, Joseph –” He turns to catch an amused glint in her eye. “– we’re usually pretty quiet after the lunch rush, from around 3 ’til close. And the only afternoons I work are Monday and Friday. Just in case you – uh – wanted a chat.” She clears her throat in a pointed manner, wishing him a good afternoon with a little smile.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped to his flatmate’s Adam’s apple, tracking the telling bob of it in his throat as he swallowed heavily. Blindly, John reached one hand onto the floor beside them and retrieved the bottle.
– possibly forever. Is it worth it,
“A bit different from my day.” The stranger is a medical man, then.
He wonders if this is what it’s like, being Sherlock. Does he see through every person he meets like this? See into their mind and heart and know without a doubt what it is that their words really mean?
“Yes, that would be advantageous,” he said into John’s ear.
The tumble of anxious words ceases its uncontrollable spill from his mouth. He looks at her again.
It occurred to John just as the incessant ringing finally stopped that it hadn’t been his ringtone at all.
“I agree that we should explore all necessary safety precautions tonight; both outcomes are feasible.”
“Joseph?”
Yes, this was best.
“To go?”
Happy to let him talk, and even happier to entertain new ideas, John replies slowly, “Nicknames fit in with that, conceptually. We reinvent ourselves when we meet new people.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock says mostly to his drink.
Sherlock pulled away and nodded his confirmation. A few moments later, John beckoned him in again.
“Just a moment.” The barista,
of all times?
He had been silent for too long, John’s hurricane expression growing rapidly more tempestuous with every passing moment. Realising this, his mouth started to shape words without his consent, engaging in a fight of its own – keeping John.
“Is that what?” Sherlock turns towards John, taking a few steps closer as an afterthought.
“Honestly? I panicked.”
None of these names make an impression in the same way as Sherlock. In the haze of the ritualistic morning caffeine rush, they are easy to spell but ordinary, forgettable.
He regrets it now. But he’s made his bed, so he may as well lie in it.
I can't believe this story has come to an end. It's been a long road, and I'm deeply appreciative of all the support I've gotten. Every comment and every kudos means so much to me. Thank you for sticking with me. I love this sweet, silly, earnest story. It's lived in my head during my own time at uni, which has just come to an end, too.
John beams, a lovely, divine thing that starts in the slightest crinkle of his nose and ends with the glimmer in his eyes. Sherlock can feel himself smile too.
It's been wild but I'm back with another chapter! I won't attempt to make promises for when the next chapter will be, but rest assured that I love this story and I will not abandon it.
Sherlock lamented internally. Then he spotted a bulging clutch hanging around her left wrist and begrudgingly allowed his hands to be brought to her waist from his position standing behind her.
Sherlock begins to feel a flicker of panic sparking heavy in his stomach, then hurriedly remembers mercuric oxide.
Sherlock grumbled internally,
“How do you feel about the violin?” Why is his voice doing that? Something inside him clenches a little in apparent distress at his own blasé tone.
Groaning, John threw out his right arm to grab for it on his bedside table – and was greeted instead with soft linen. He chanced a frown, making the effort to crack open an eyelid.
The problem is all far more trouble than it’s worth. After all, what’s in a name, really? Sherlock relents, wondering if he’s being foolish: does it matter as much to his logical mind – with respect to his desire for efficiency in all social interactions – as it does to his prideful heart?
“He’ll want to know,” John prompted.
Note the rating and tag changes. This chapter is heavy on exposition and does go into detail about some (fictional, but still pretty gruesome) acts of murder. Please be wary if that isn't your cup of tea.
He took note of her feet – sporting faux-suede boots with a solid, supportive heel.
as his given name, he feels that he’s lived up to it – perhaps grown into it somehow. He loves how it rolls off his tongue, flowing easily into the often-adjacent Holmes. He revels in the way it makes professors raise an eyebrow, strangers cock their heads to one side in curiosity or confusion, classmates momentarily lift their chins with a sceptical eye.
Irene sighs. “That’s not what I meant and you know it. I just –”
(See the end of the chapter for
This is drawn from Plato’s
“Like, little green men?”
“Thank you,” he breathes out in a rush instead.
“Er, broadly,” Sherlock says, blinking a few too many times. “Biology alongside advanced mathematics and chemistry. My major is chemistry.”
Sherlock heaved John past the threshold and struggled to kick the door closed without making enough noise to wake Mrs. Hudson. John’s breathing was regular, but so quiet that Sherlock stilled for a few moments just to reassure himself that he could actually hear it.
Just as it occurred to Sherlock that perhaps the gap wasn’t that valuable a prize anyway, the brunette woman beside him turned. Very suddenly, it became apparent that she was now dancing with him, rather than simply next to him. The silkiness of her smile startlingly contrasted with the abrupt stiffening of John’s shoulders.
John smiles. Sherlock tries not to stare at the brilliance of it and reminds himself that he does indeed know how to speak.
Whatever his face is doing, John grins at him anyway. A genuinely pleased, gorgeous thing, bearing no hints of malice or amusement at Sherlock’s expense. He drinks it in with a flicker of his eyes, committing the rare image to memory.
John hides his smile while Sherlock shoulders his messenger bag, then he takes his other hand without looking. Their hands fit together like they’ve done this a million times and they fall into an easy stride, warmth sparking where their arms brush.
“No one actually believes that, Sherlock.”
“We don’t know a thing about each other, I don’t know where we’re meeting – I don’t even know your name.”
The woman was single and had never married. Probably not heterosexual; most likely not homosexual either, judging by the present circumstances. Although currently house- and cat-sitting for a long-time close colleague and his husband, she usually resided somewhere outside of town with two roommates.
, often referred to as “On the Correctness of Names”. You can read about it
“One,” Sherlock somehow gets out. Maybe the daily sugar hit isn’t doing his brain function any favours. At least today he has the correct money ready before it’s requested.
“The cab driver did – any of them would if it meant getting to you.”
– he’s warm. He’s at peace. He’s safe.
He had not at all, not in the slightest, anticipated that while he engulfed himself in the steam and the gentle caress of near-scalding water, stroking himself leisurely, said friend would stride unceremoniously into the room. With barely a glance at him, Sherlock made a beeline for a medium-sized red bucket resting on the floor beside the vanity, while John splashed about, spluttering ill-formed sentences and cut-off words in an attempt to communicate his outrage at this unexpected turn of events.
“Yes.” It feels like a promise.
“I’m not sure if you’re more of a sweet or a savoury guy, but the croissants are a crowd favourite.” Then she leans in, like a child sharing a well-guarded secret, and mutters in an undertone: “I’d advise against the mint chocolate cupcakes, though. People say they have an odd aftertaste and I’m inclined to agree.”
“I’ll admit that I’m royally pissed off at the moment, and I’m in two minds about whether I want to know what experiment has you so – so
He wasn’t exactly the best judge of that area and short of asking Donovan – a low he refused to sink to – he had no real way to confirm his belief, but he was reasonably certain that the woman was not what he would assume to be average looking. In any case, the only one of her physical characteristics that matched their description of the murderer’s was her sex.
“It’s
“Oh. I was 11, starting secondary school.” Sherlock purses his lips for a moment, but his eyes remain bright. “It certainly felt like reinvention at the time.”
John watched with fascination as the tension seemed to simply seep out of Sherlock while the detective sighed. His free hand came up from beside him, his fingertips sliding over the bridge of his nose before pausing over his closed eyelids.
“Hi Joseph, what can I get for you?”
“Better?” John asked around a half-suppressed grin.
First he is William, out of convenience. Then Isaac is misspelt as Isack (though how
John wasn’t supposed to have been bait, just a sharp set of eyes and ears where he was needed. The killer was suspected to be female, average height, brunette, manicured fingernails, attractive but not unusually so. Not enough that someone whose area that was would remember her precisely, remember her as more than a pretty face – no, outwardly memorable only as much as any other woman in a bar wanting for you to buy her a drink.
Fight – flight – fight – flight – fight – flight –
Lestrade only grinned, turning and waving Donovan to join them. As she approached, John realised that contrary to his original assumption, she wasn’t dressed in plain, casual clothes like Lestrade and the other detective, but in a long-sleeved, emerald green dress – which, upon further observation, he realised wasn’t really a dress, but a shirt and shorts in one. He glanced towards her feet, thinking about the possibility of an on-foot chase before the night was over; she was, sensibly, wearing flat shoes.
At the sight of her, and her singular presence behind the counter, Sherlock’s day-long craving for caffeine dissipates all but instantly. He decides against examining the mysterious phenomenon.
gone to think in silence for a bit. After– after exams, you know –” His tone changes abruptly as his gaze comes to rest directly on Sherlock. “Joseph, what are we doing? What’s– what’s going on?”
Stupid, he was so bloody
“Stupid.” Sherlock shook his head, seemingly in lament for the cognitive skills of Scotland Yard’s finest.
“Should I bring a jacket?”
There is a number written in endearingly untidy scrawl – undoubtedly John’s. The words that accompany it read:
“Clearly –
Sherlock’s mouth hangs open as he wears a blank expression. He replays the rest of the evening in his mind. Confusion. Worry. Surprise. Joy. Bliss. Contentment. Concern. Regret. It had ended with him alone in his bed, staring at the ceiling and willing his mind to empty.
“Of course. This time I troubled myself with containing the mould cultures in this bucket instead of using the bathtub, since you expressed such vehement dislike for the idea after the last occurrence.”
Sherlock justified, unable to escape the thought of John, sprawled out and still in a dirty alleyway, his abdomen branded with the letter H.
He feels like his thoughts are useless.
. I hate to admit it but you’re very intelligent, Sherlock Holmes. You’ll work it out.”
Sherlock looks up, careful not to drop his piping hot cup, wondering why it sounds like a question.
Sherlock almost crumbles at that, then swallows forcefully. When he speaks, his voice is small. “You knew I’d be here?”
“Because every branch of the core theory I needed for practical medicine took
He assumed it was due to the amount of time that had passed in the interim, allowing even more copious amounts of alcohol to be imbibed, but now the part of the club set aside for dancing was no longer being used for that purpose: it was merely a cesspool of sweat, complete with errant hands and elbows and feet. More than once, Sherlock was subjected to the uncomfortable sensation of a drink being spilled on his shoes, or splattering up the hem of his jeans. He was immeasurably grateful for his forethought; he shuddered to think of his dress shoes sustaining such defilement.
Taken aback by the abrupt change in her tone and focus, Sherlock only frowns.
Sherlock found that watching John’s face as he worked himself was exquisite. He started slow, evidently still self-conscious, but then the sensation and the realisation of
, Sherlock? It’s just a name! You could be Joseph or Arthur or – or Caleb –”
John Watson was not a romantic at heart.
Did he wink?
Fuck.
“That he isn’t really called Sherlock? I did. The sheer pompousness of it seems to fit though, don’t you think?” A lopsided smile graced his face as he said it and he turned his head to gaze upon the man in question.
“Why would the bartender drug me? How do you know for certain?”
“I was reading a paper the night before about Joseph Priestley. First name that came to mind,” he says simply.
. His responsiveness stimulates further thought in a way Sherlock has been trying to achieve with his bust for months.
Sherlock moves to the side and waits, resisting the primal urge to check his silent and motionless mobile phone.
“See you tomorrow.”
; of all the people he had met while on cases who hadn’t known of him by anything else but Sherlock Holmes’ blogger.
The mere remembrance brings a stab of complicated discomfort to Sherlock’s gut.
“No problem.” John doesn’t seem to mind the abrupt formality. There’s an almost-sparkle in his eyes. “I’ll be around. See you, Joseph.”
When Sherlock next sees Irene, she’s as polite as ever.
John resented him just a little for it.
Sherlock thinks about his essay, long-forgotten in favour of more worthwhile uses of his attention, and simply can’t bring himself to care at present. The happy crinkle around his eyes is made visible only to the interior of his messenger bag. Then he rolls his neck in a smooth semicircle and straightens with a small intake of breath, steeling himself to return to the world outside of this newfound haven.
He watches John return with a fresh coffee and it crosses his mind that he’d like to know what this man’s lips taste like.
Normally Sherlock wouldn’t be amused by a woman’s polite attempts at conversing with him, but Molly’s unassuming warmth speaks of a kindness he’s not accustomed to outside of interactions with Mrs. Hudson. Her attitude is far from Irene’s teasing and salacious banter, or his classmate’s permanent disdain.
man to room with him, even if that requires lying about his proficiency in ever being able to shut up.
Finally, the door clicks open and they are rescued from the night’s chill.
may be.
Sherlock rolled his eyes out of exasperation. When he spoke, it was to the ceiling, the pale column of his alabaster neck made strikingly visible to his companion. “I didn’t realise at the time. I gathered enough information about my surroundings for further examination when I collected you from the bar.” John scowled at the word ‘collected’ but remained silent. “The bartender was nearing the end of his shift – obvious from the frequency, even in the short period I was in there, that he glanced at his watch and the relief on his face when he did so. He was also intensely –
Sparing a glance in a half-hearted search for John behind the couple’s heads, he turned on his heel and began to shuffle back to his previous spot. Without warning, a hand grabbed his wrist and he was unceremoniously yanked forward a few paces. The offending hand belonged to the woman he had thought timid and unimposing; her smiling face now loomed before his with unanticipated confidence.
John was looking at him hopefully, an expression Sherlock didn’t entirely know what to make of. Was he eager to dance? To secure a minute away from him? To find a pretty woman and buy her a drink?
Yet, Sherlock still finds himself leaving his last class — vector calculus, dull — ten minutes early in order to rush to the coffee shop. He has absolutely no knowledge of its closing time, only the crucial understanding that it opens at 5am and remains so for at least four hours (he’d skipped a useless morning lecture once or twice, and still managed to stop in on his way to campus).
, before he feels a soul-deep compulsion to bring up her favourite television drama or Mrs. Turner next door.
“The killer has been careful.” Sherlock frowned, and John knew that he was both pleased and irritated by this. “Long brown hair has been found, which the police cannot identify as being from anyone in their system. No traces of their fingerprints or blood and no substantial amount of skin cells under the victims’ fingernails. They were unremarkable enough for the security guards at both venues to have no recollection of them, but persuasive enough to entice two people to leave with them into a side street.”

Sherlock watches John’s nostrils twitch, sees his eyebrows dip. He feels like he could drown in John’s eyes, which are pleading with him as if John himself was the one who made a mistake. Sherlock’s throat is tight and he feels suddenly bereft and far too cold in the evening chill.
John thinks for a moment. “Discovered oxygen before Lavoisier?”
the note ended, with two dashed x’s. He hadn’t had the time, of course. Without Mrs. Hudson’s deft hands pressing a lightly buttered slice of toast into his grasp of a morning, eighteenth century chemistry papers are always given his full attention, right up until the last possible moment. He’d left just in time to step into the right pair of shoes and remember to lock the front door.
“John, I’d like to taste you,” Sherlock breathed, both soft and low at once.
“If you’d like to take a seat, I’ll bring it out to you,” John says warmly, accepting his money before reaching for the milk pitcher.
“Not much further,” Sherlock says after a moment, realising they are in fact, quite close to his flat.
The things Sherlock knows about John include that he’s a university student (
She turned back to the man beside her, who appeared far more interested in her than the reverse, even from a distance. The thought made the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitch with mirth.
But then he thought of Sherlock himself, bringing him tea earlier and looking – in an endearingly bizarre manner – tentative. He thought of
“Seriously, Sherlock?” John’s voice was flat. He found it hard to believe that his friend could be so daft, and so wondered what part of his thought process he was attempting to conceal. “The victims’ appearances, your initials – hell, even the fact that they’ve been serial murders. Surely you can’t fail to see how this is designed to get your attention.”
It's been a while, so I'd really like to thank everyone who's sticking with this story. You're the best and I love you.
A primary school teacher, lacking the physical strength to have been the murderer, had her divorce finalised that day; her only current intention was to become inebriated and find someone to sleep with. A veterinarian celebrating her sister’s birthday, not a frequent visitor at these kinds of establishments, had a criminal record, so DNA from the hair samples would have found a match in the police database. A nurse-in-training was on exchange from America and had only arrived in the last 24 hours. An automobile mechanic, with insufficient height to be their culprit, was spending a weekend away from her three children.
John knows it’s not worth mentioning, certainly not now. Not when there’s the much more interesting option of –
“What the– Sherl– Jesus– what the
“Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine.”
“See you tomorrow, then.”
Sherlock can’t discern if he means it as a joke.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Your point is perfectly comprehensible, but misguided. I don’t purposefully build these ‘outs’ for myself, it just happens that in this case I had previously lied to John and it resulted in negative consequences I hadn’t foreseen.” Sherlock’s tone is level and matter-of-fact.
Sherlock gingerly lowered himself on to the edge of his own bed, to which his friend responded with raised eyebrows. Finally, Sherlock relented, shuffling over until his outstretched legs rested beside John and his teacup sat atop his thighs.
his arms.”
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street.” He adds a called, “Afternoon,” in farewell to Mike before swinging himself around the door and outside.
“Sherlock?” Sherlock’s stomach dropped at the mention of his name. “Never thought I’d see you here, let alone with company,” the man gave a quiet laugh through his nose, his mouth twisting in a way that made Sherlock angry, even if his face remained neutral. “How’d you swing that? Pay him something grand?”
stop talking about mould.”
“No!” Sherlock bursts out, his voice uneven. He inhales a shaky breath.
“So we can rule out all the men here?”
“I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan.” He winds his scarf around his neck with a practiced loop, finding his eyes drawn to lock with John’s as he turns to face him again. “Wasn’t that difficult a leap.”
“Sherlock, I swear to God, if you don’t –”
Sherlock looks at John and he sees the memory of a medical student, the precision and focus of a surgeon, the sincerity of a nurse and the quickness of a paramedic. He feels the impulse to demand John tell him what field he’s studying, to have his deductions validated and praised by this man.
Instead, John wondered how Sherlock Holmes – arguably the most observant man in England – had yet to notice what had happened. He willed Sherlock to see him as he was, slouching where he sat, both of his hands holding things that weren’t his.
him to someone John didn’t even know.
“Doppio with two sugars, thanks.”
John’s laugh seems to burst out of him of its own accord, light and musical without extending into booming territory. Sherlock wants to record it, hold it, bottle it; fashion it into cologne and let it sink into his pores every morning. As it stands, a smile drifts over his face like wisps of cloud on a breezy afternoon: gentle and unhurried, yet all the more welcome for surprising him.
A thought occurred to him, an abrupt urge striking him like a flash of lightning, and Sherlock stilled both of their hands.
you know about Afghanistan?”
A comfortable tension has brought them together, only sharpening each time John has risen to attend to his responsibilities: a thread delicate as cotton pulled taut, ineffable as heavenly bodies caught in mutual orbit. Neither is eager to break the connection they’ve unwittingly formed. Trepidation makes itself known in the growing doubt that maybe this easy magic isn’t meant to last beyond the confines of an empty café on a hazy Saturday afternoon.
Sherlock's eating habits are inspired by my own: I can never trust anyone with my tea.
For a suspended moment, Sherlock and John stare at each other with blank faces and held breaths. Then Sherlock turns and almost bumps directly into the customer coming in behind him.
Lestrade’s voice sounded placating now, probably reminding Sherlock that they needed to focus on their plan for tonight, not on whatever undoubtedly trivial thing for which he was being criticised.
Sherlock nodded, taking up his teacup. “The victim wasn’t heard screaming, even though the attack happened at around one thirty in the morning, relatively near the bustle of city nightlife. There was bruising around her mouth and jaw, as though she had been smothered non-fatally.”
This was actually kind of cathartic for me.
God, how had he done it? Now, the thought of conducting a case on his own was virtually repulsive.
Hoping this won’t be a daily occurrence, John wonders if it’s simply the case that this tantalisingly gorgeous man is easily frightened by social interaction. Maybe the first name was too much. He looks down and readjusts the cup in his grip to give the man a moment to collect himself.
It hadn’t felt like Molly was trying to ask him out. He’s pretty sure he has experience enough, from the outrageously blatant to the most ambiguous, in being able to discern when
his focus was sharpened in a way he had only deluded himself cocaine could accomplish: John made him quicker, wittier; more content, less lonely. Happier.
upon it in your – in your bedroom one day and I had never seen – well, I wanted to conduct an – let’s say an experiment of sorts, using –”
“So what if they do? How do unfounded rumours conceived by small-minded imbeciles have anything to do with John?”
“Me.” Sherlock’s eyes were positively glittering now.
“You can have it back.” He cleared his throat against the raspiness that had developed there. “There’s nothing wrong with it apart from a little dust.”
Sherlock stares at the collar on John’s coat. He notices lint, some stray hair fibres and a light scattering of dust. It hasn’t been washed in several weeks, remaining laid out on the chair in his bedroom due to its frequent use and his lack of spare time, between Mary, his shifts and preparing for the baby.
He wakes, as he does too often for it to be labelled infrequent, with an aching neck and textbook crease marks on his cheek, to the sound of his ungodly shrill third alarm. Stumbling to the sound, he switches off the alarm clock and stands clutching his head for a few moments, fingertips blocking all light from entering his vision. Then he goes in search of his phone.
He didn’t regret John, but –
Two sparkling, silver-painted fingernails brushed back a lock of her pitch-black hair, and the image of John leaning close to his companion’s ear flashed through Sherlock’s traitorous mind. He had very nearly had enough of this ridiculous emotional business, a voice in the back of his mind decided resolutely. For once, he craved the nothingness of sleep. Or cocaine.
“What?” John says softly, concerned. Sherlock thinks of the day they met, the way John had looked at him while he stood in the line, dumbstruck like a frightened child lost in a supermarket.
“Tell me about the pattern.”
He shook himself for a moment.
Sherlock surmises that he sounds a little impressed.
If John had been paying attention to vocal inflection and facial expressions and body language and all the things that Sherlock prided himself on his ability to notice, he would have been tempted to try to understand why his friend sounded so dismissive. That was usually John’s job description: understand and act accordingly.
He doesn’t know when exactly it happened, but Sherlock knows: he’s already gone. This person is practically a stranger and they’ve yet to exchange a proper conversation, but Sherlock knows this to be true with the same frank conviction that he knows he can recall the atomic mass of each element in the periodic table to three decimal places. (Four, on good days.)
Sherlock’s first impression of the club was that it was deafening, sticky and overcrowded.
Words were left unsaid for now; the thrumming of their heartbeats seemed enough.
If John wasn’t going to be of any significant assistance, he would solve this stupid case on his own. Hadn’t he done that for years before he’d ever met the man?
Sherlock only blinked for a moment, then abruptly bounded to his feet, collecting the remnants of their meal. John glanced warily toward him when he halted in the doorway. Although his back was turned, John sensed a certain slyness is his stance.
Sherlock wants to talk to John again, he really does. Just not yet. He’s not sure if he’ll ever be ready, but he knows he needs more time.
“I think attracted would be a more apt term.”
Their eyes lock and John feels like he could cry. He thinks Sherlock looks like he might offer out a palm to shake his hand, but sees the man change his mind and embrace him softly instead. He’s glad for the intimacy of the contact. Even just this once.
“When I last saw him, he seemed… occupied.”
“What does it even
The pair of them had seemed happy sitting across from one another. Boisterously, unselfconsciously happy. Sherlock spent the whole night enthralled, forgetting all the times he’d been told that the way he made eye contact was too intense and made people uncomfortable. Forgetting to hold back. He stared openly, drinking in as much of this wonder as he could. He forgot to analyse his movements in a way that would have a calculated positive effect, instead finding himself giggling loudly and offering John some of his food. A tiny drip of sauce slopped down his chin and he didn’t notice until John leant in and swiped at it with the corner of his serviette.
“Six months, my brother estimates. He’s never wrong.” The words are addressed to some strands of John’s hair that are sticking up a little at the crown of his head, fluttering nonchalantly in the breeze. He thinks distantly that it’s unusual for even this small portion of John’s hair to be anything but obediently neat.
At the same time, it’s all a little brilliant, too.
do this.” Irene’s exasperation has softened into something like worry.
But that wasn’t just it, that wasn’t the true extent of his misdeed. John held the paraphernalia of his army dalliance remarkably close to his heart. His medical equipment and the Sig were within reach, but his fatigues, his medallions, letters from the friends he had made during that time – they all had a place in the back of his wardrobe, and were kept under lock and key in his chest. Sherlock had had no right to invade such a place, for he had no standing in John’s heart. He was his friend
But this was a question of logic, not of sentiment.
“Sounds like a full plate,” John replies. His voice is light and unhurried in the quiet café.
“I had expected so.”
– you know –” Sherlock nods in an encouraging manner.
Sherlock lowers his chin and looks at John. This man, whom he’s only just met but he feels some kind of pull towards, some desire to expend a little more effort than usual, some need to impress.
“Since this is likely to be the last conversation I’ll have with John Watson, would you mind if we took a moment?”
“I’ve had one drink already, and I have no intention of being inebriated, thanks.”
Sherlock isn’t listening. He opens the door, mutters, “Don’t take my landlady too seriously,” and in one fluid motion, draws John into the foyer, shuts the door behind them, and finally kisses him with all the passion he feels.
“John, you look nothing like the other victims.”
Sherlock contemplates deleting the text from John’s sent message bank, but decides against it; there’s something intriguing about it from an outsider’s perspective. Perhaps it would benefit John to have something concrete to remember him by, even if that period of time turns out to be only brief. Sherlock then ignores the odd twinge of his stomach and its having occurred at the same time as when the latter thought crossed his mind. He dismisses it as a coincidence, having far more pressing information to consider.
John laughs. To Sherlock's utter amazement, it’s a laugh of joy and delight, however bemused it may be. It doesn't hold a trace of disdain.
), at one point in his youth had a pet cat in his family (
he mentally adds a second later.
Such an admirable amount of self control was expended in the way of ensuring Sherlock’s mouth didn’t drop open – that would be too much for his pride to handle – that as a result, he was unable to prevent his eyes widening.
, which is the study of how an organism absorbs, distributes, metabolises and excretes a drug.
Sherlock spared a glance at his friend for the unintentional pun. “Yes, it signalled a potential serial killer. The second body was found in an alley behind the Inferno club with an S carved into her abdomen.”
Keeping his fingers moving quickly so as not to come under suspicion, he deletes the unsigned text from John’s sent messages immediately.
Sherlock opened his eyes a long moment after the resigned words had left him, and was perplexed at the slackening of John’s jaw. Wasn’t this what he wanted?
. Known, even though he trusted that John hadn’t taken his eyes off of his glass for more than a split second, even though John had muttered that the bartender was male while his drink was being poured. John liked to sound in control and sure of himself; his voice rarely shook in much higher pressure situations than this, but even when it did, it never sounded this unsteady. Lestrade had given him an acquiescing nod a moment after the words had filled the unmarked police car and Sherlock’s head had snapped up, then Sherlock fled into the crowded bar across the street, a hive-like intensity to his painfully singular focus.
John stares blankly for a moment, then cocks his head to the side and looks Sherlock dead in the eyes. His voice is controlled but his eyes are blazing. “What? You didn’t mean to go out with me and have a good time? You’re dating someone else? You’re not actually into guys? What is it?” He takes a step in, his voice rising. “‘Cause I’ve been wracking my brain and I don’t know what I could’ve
A spark of warmth flared in Sherlock’s chest at the realisation that his mostly unfounded hunch had been right – John had been the captain of his high-school rugby team – and at the accompanying mental flash of what he might look like playing.
And she’s right: he’s tried to keep as much information from Irene’s sharp mind as possible. He hasn’t told her a word of what happened on his and John’s date.
The barista continues to stare at him, eyebrows drawing together a little while he holds a marker and cup in his hands. A tiny wrinkle appears between the man’s brows. Some strands of hair fall over the stranger’s forehead, and Sherlock tells himself that he’s obviously imagining their twinkling in the morning light – golden as dawn rays over the bubbling froth of the seashore.
“And the letters, what do they mean? M, S, S?”
“Scalding,” he says in a deadpan voice.
Mike hadn’t told him anything about Sherlock – no words of warning or admiration. Probably a good thing.
“I don’t –” John swallows. Takes half a step closer for good measure, so that Sherlock can see his freckles in startlingly high definition.
It had been John’s idea, as such things usually are, but Sherlock couldn’t find it within himself to be angry – or indeed even a healthy amount of irritated. He hastily shoved some notes in the general direction of the cabbie and rushed into the cool night air of Baker Street to assist John’s alighting from the vehicle. Sherlock struggled with the all but dead weight of his incapacitated friend, careful to support his head so it didn’t loll to one side. John wouldn’t thank him for any unnecessary neck pain come morning.
friend.
Sherlock stared at him and then said very slowly, as if to a small child: “Yes.”
Nodding, John followed his flatmate downstairs, calling a quick though sincere farewell to Mrs. Hudson. A cab magically appeared, as they were wont to do whenever Sherlock desired one.
They were all abandoned with increasing degrees of abruptness and disdain. A male carpenter approached Sherlock, with passably similar characteristics to those believed to be the killer’s. He was observed and likewise, quickly disregarded.
“No, neither can I.”
Somehow, that particular idea never flusters the woman. She always makes some retort about how it isn’t the raw material – the data – that matters, but the way one uses it. That always draws a snort out of Sherlock.
The people who next filled the role of Sherlock’s dance partners were not a blur, although they were brief acquaintances.
“The killer’s victims have had similar physical attributes: short or medium-length dark hair; tall – at least 175 centimetres; average build and fairly pale skin.”
Sherlock looks up and stops when he sees John approaching him. Feels his bag slip from his shoulder and land with a quiet huff of air beside him. He watches the evening wind playing with John’s hair. Focuses on how endearing it is. Tries to push down the sea of emotions rising in him, guilt the strongest of them all.
He shoves it all aside, along with his innate British masculinity, because if John doesn’t say it now, he won’t ever have the opportunity to say it again.
expression. “– but I’m saying it now. I know it’s too late –”
“Your drugging was unrelated,” Sherlock said vaguely, giving the impression, as he so often did, that he knew more than he was willing to share. He avoided John’s eyes, finishing his tea, casting the cup aside and staring at his perfectly rounded fingernails.
He looks down and Sherlock understands exactly how broken – how utterly shattered – he looks. He feels it too, in his very bones, feels every last shard of icy, bitter heartache.
“Your name. Your real name. Whatever it was before, whatever you’ve told people – I like Sherlock better.”
Sherlock clears his throat.
“I rather suspected you would’ve preferred I did the opposite.”
The sergeant gaped. “A victim?”
Unfortunately, the mind he had spent his whole life cultivating so as to be relied on in stressful situations was mysteriously blank. He hadn’t even the presence of mind to scold himself for leaving the photograph in such an obvious place. In fact, he had exactly two words stuttering through his head.
“And I can’t imagine why you would regret that, because I’ve
assessment of the previous crime scenes, but John had been drugged despite his not fitting the killer’s archetype. The previous victims had been tall, more lean than muscular, dark hair.
“Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you.”
Sherlock has to admit, if only inwardly, that it’s possible the last addition had been a bit much. It’s awfully fun, though, this elaborate attempt to entice a stranger to himself.
Stumbling up the final stair and into their flat, Sherlock was physically exhausted. Fully aware that the hyperactivity of his racing mind at present meant that he would not be making use of his own bed that night, he made the logical decision to leave John in his bedroom. His friend would be more comfortable there – and it was a shorter distance to it from his habitual thinking spot on the lounge than to John’s bedroom: if for any reason John were to be in need of assistance, he would be there in mere moments.
The barista is not Molly.
“Oh, some undercover work in Eastern Europe.” He nods, as if it will cement the statement firmly in the realm of certainty rather than in its current residence of blatant vagueness.
“Unfortunately, someone’s got to watch the kids,” she replied, smile venomous.
John’s eyes seem a deeper, more intriguing shade of blue than he remembers.
A pause.
“Maybe they do, I wouldn’t be surprised!”
John considered telling the inspector what he no doubt already knew: that he was worried for his friend, for himself or for any other possible target that could be in that club right now. That his first instinct was to rush in and tell everyone inside to evacuate, to set off the emergency fire alarms if necessary.
Sherlock stepped into the tub and lowered himself onto his knees, which he positioned on the inside of John’s. He seemed entirely unfazed by the high water temperature, however he took a moment to openly observe John, laying before him like this, in all his glory.
. He marvels with an open mouth over the deductions that led Sherlock to uncover his field of study. He asks which essay he’s working on, and follows with specific, directed questions that Irene would never care for. For some reason quite beyond him, Sherlock realises John is interested to know more about him, even if it means John makes himself recall the boring essay topics he probably wrote on and mentally discarded two years ago.
There’s a stupid smile fighting to break out on his face but he can’t really bring himself to care because John’s smiling, too. “Yes, thank you.”
“Search her purse for authentic identification.”
“Did you say she volunteered?” John struggled to keep the surprise out of his voice. He saw that Sherlock looked more bored than especially bothered, surveying his surroundings and only half listening.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes, turning away from her. The scowl on his face betrays the fact he doesn’t understand what she sees that he can’t.
“Frankly, John,” Sherlock started, to John’s increasing dismay, “it’s not anything I haven’t heard before. Or seen, to some degree, for that matter.” He added the last part almost as an afterthought, his eyes narrowing as if recalling some vague memory of walking into the bathroom unannounced or of John exiting it with his towel not fastened safely enough around him. John wanted the tiles to swallow him up. “Besides, it’s not as though I have any interest in watching.”
God, where had that come from?
Mrs. Hudson hadn’t been in that morning. Sherlock vaguely recalled her informing him that this would be the case the morning prior, although a sticky note on his infectious diseases textbook had nonetheless reinforced the fact. She’s visiting someone – a relative, or a friend… whom doesn’t matter all that much, does it?
When he reaches the ground floor, Sherlock is already formulating the fastest route back to his flat that does not pass within two blocks of John’s café. Because it is, in fact,
He finds himself forgoing his usual morning coffee altogether, slapping a nicotine patch onto his inner forearm if he’s in particular need of a kick. It’s only on Monday and Friday afternoons that he creeps in to the café and orders a doppio to go. He rarely meets her eyes, but he can sense Molly peering at him curiously.
She directs a gentle smile at him before sweeping her pile neatly aside and leaning the broom against the doorframe behind her.
“You could say that again.”
All of a sudden, it became startlingly apparent to Sherlock that a couple was watching him. A man and a woman standing not far to his left were quite obviously trying and failing to monitor him in any kind of covert manner. Mentally cursing his daft fascination with this ordinary woman, he excused himself with a hurried, “Be right back.”
His right hand continues to shake all through the walk to his first lecture; the tremor persists even after he finishes the cup’s contents and disposes of it. At least it’s quite a good coffee.
Not his room, certainly. The bed was too wide, hedonistically luxurious in the pure comfort it provided. That explained the non-existence of his expected pains.
“John, I – you should understand that – I never
John gave him a calculating look in return, before leaning in himself. “Okay. Don’t go too far.”
“You’re an idiot.” A beat, and then, in a whisper, “Why do you always do this?”
When Sherlock reached his climax, he slumped forward, his hands reaching out to soften his fall and landing upon John’s chest. His forehead came to rest on a shoulder, and he absently registered arms loosely wrapping around him as his eyelids fluttered shut. There they remained for a time, while the bath water rapidly cooled, clutching each other in an unexpected moment of closeness that somehow felt far more intimate than the act they had just engaged in.
A while later, the bedroom door opened. This was followed by the appearance of a tray bearing two cups of tea and a plate with several pieces of toast and, finally, the reappearance of the man holding it.
Sherlock should know by now that when something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. John was one of the best things to ever happen to him — if not the best thing — but he was still human. Even he had limits.
“Oh. Thank you.”
Sherlock spun on his heels toward Donovan. “Since John is clearly fine, I’m going to dance.”
I hadn't originally planned for this chapter to end here, but I decided to split it because the length was getting a little out of hand.
“Sherlock.”
was the one who had been incapacitated.
Sherlock strides down the corridor, takes the first left in the opposite direction of the exit, a subsequent right, and then stops. He glances back behind him before leaning against a wall, suddenly feeling the need to catch his breath.
He didn’t catch the flash of her eyes.
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes,” he says on a whim.
“Oh.”
“It’s irrelevant, I assure you –”
“Sorry?”
Sherlock’s cheeks flamed at that. He blinked, dropped his head almost into his plate and mumbled a quiet thanks. The chuckle that came from John convinced him that it mustn’t have been that bad; anything that made John made that sound was good and right and proper.
there, peppered with the occasional
Sherlock loves his name. Having exerted some autonomy in claiming
“We should dance.”
“No.”
“That’s not the point!” John blurted.
They stare at each other while the tension between them settles, trying to reach some silent equilibrium. They don’t often engage in such personal discussions – certainly not when Sherlock is in the sharing position – and Sherlock isn’t prone to unexpected outbursts when they do. He exhales loudly.
This is not the way he wants to leave the most important person in his life. John Watson deserves better than the first defensive, slightly nonsensical words that come out of his mouth. Perhaps the old metaphor is tired.
Ignoring the guilt pounding in his head, he addressed the waiter, whom he vaguely recognised from a class the previous semester. “Indeed, I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. The cheque, if you please.”
Some remote part of Sherlock’s mind considered that in another establishment, on a night devoid of a case, and with John by his side, he might have been persuaded to be appreciative of the offer. Tonight, he only levelled a condescending glare at the intoxicated man.
last night while working with you.” An involuntary sound of repentance emerged from the back of Sherlock’s throat, which caused John’s expression to soften some. “But I’m telling you plainly, Sherlock: there is nothing you could do that would drive me away from you for good.”
“Mm.”
He looks away, and when his gaze returns, the other man is suddenly unable to look at him. John turns this way and that, hands clasped behind him. Does he really want this exchange to be over already?
In spite of everything, it brought a small smile to his face.
Existing in proximity to John feels essential, so Sherlock replies quietly: “I’m happy to wait.”
“Sherlock…”
“Double shot? Sure thing. Name, please?”
A few seconds later, it was clear Lestrade’s voice in her ear had given her words of admonishment, for the grin left her face as quickly as it had appeared.
After a while, John’s mind drifts again to Harry. “When did you change your name?”
She nods, unfazed and apparently satisfied with his answer. “Do you want to see him again?”
A nod of understanding.
The woman was gently relocated to Donovan’s grasp, who took charge in picking their collective way towards the exit. Sherlock watched the sergeant’s mouth move, delivering an explanation to Lestrade. Civilian safety was paramount.
“That’s so
Sherlock’s mouth twisted into a proud smile that made John’s stomach swoop strangely. “Me.”
“And Lestrade’s too much of precious cargo, so you thought you’d proffer your services?” Sherlock spoke, surprising John so that he hadn’t time to properly stifle his snicker.
He had not only trespassed into John’s bedroom and taken something he prized immensely, he had been an intruder into John’s heart, somewhere he certainly didn’t belong.
Patting the pockets of his coat, he’s appreciative that in amongst all of his haphazard thoughts, he’d somehow managed to retain sufficient presence of mind to put his phone in one of them before he’d left the laboratory. His mobile shows an unread message.
Lestrade stared at him for a long moment, and then nodded once, apparently satisfied.
Sherlock only grimaced.
The issue being John, of course.
Sherlock takes a tiny breath in, trying not to make it obvious that he feels like he’s breaking through the surface of the sea and at last clutching on to a life raft.
Thank you so much for reading. I really hope you enjoyed the chapter!
Sherlock stood with the sergeant for long enough to watch John pull the probably-unnecessarily-pretty woman close enough to speak into her ear, before he decided he’d had enough.
There was no use in even entertaining the thought of hiding the uncapped bottle of conditioner – oh god,
seemed to sink in, and the pace of his hand increased. Hungry eyes drank in the sight as he flicked his wrist just so whenever his hand approached the head of his cock.
“Then who said anything about flatmates?”
Irene, the smug dollop, has never had this problem. She seems to think that something about her posture, her tone of voice, her very air, demands attention enough for any barista to complete the task without a problem. Never mind, Sherlock thinks, how utterly common a name
A particularly heated glare was directed at Sherlock. He paused.
ago and –”
As he pushed his way through the heavy, sluggish crowd, the pair seemed almost surprised when he made in their direction. For a moment it appeared the woman would flee: she stilled with eyes wide, like a child hearing a noise in the next room while they were eating from the biscuit jar. Then a slow smile broke over her face that almost made Sherlock pause, in the midst of nebulous confusion.
“Yes. Stunningly simple, yet immensely effective – something made plain by Scotland Yard having seen exactly what they wanted to see. Anyone connected to Moriarty would never concern themselves with crimes so proportionately irrelevant.”
The pleasant smile slipped from his face as soon as he had turned away from her. He moved a small distance in the general direction of the bar before taking a sharp left and hurrying along, wishing for the crowd to swallow him and, for once, cursing his distinctly tall frame.
Sherlock is troubled by this relative stranger.
“Mate, you must have the wrong guy. I don’t know who the hell Sherlock is and aside from that, Joseph is excellent company. It’d be great if you left us the cheque and stopped insulting people you don’t know, thanks.”
All too soon, he was positively accosted by a woman who was only just shorter than himself, with cropped, peroxide blonde hair. She took hold of his wrist, raising it high enough to spin herself closer to him.
“Yes.” When it finally sounds, Sherlock’s voice is strong, unwavering. Only a tad concerned about the gravity of the horrendous mistake he had made the previous morning. “Doppio, thanks. Take away.”
John turned an unwavering, deeply irritated gaze on his friend, who relented almost immediately.
“No, we’ve had a scan. We’re pretty sure it’s a girl.”
John’s vision blacked out for a moment, in which he could have sworn he heard the quiet whoosh of fabric being dragged over skin. When his eyes fancied themselves ready to become accustomed to the harsh bathroom light once more, Sherlock was poised before him, completely naked. It did not escape John’s notice that the man’s thin, perfect cock was standing at half-mast.
“I cannot promise in good faith not to enter your bedroom without your knowledge again -”
“Okay.” Molly’s voice wavers: a lit matchstick held upright for too long.
A sinking feeling came over Sherlock’s stomach.
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” Sherlock murmured, almost automatically.
Even with the acrid scent of hurt and regret between them, Sherlock cannot help but stare at the beauty of the man before him.
“You look like shit, darling,” she greets him. He’s seated on a bench overlooking a very muddied campus lawn. The morning is gloomy and grey, still recovering from the previous evening’s heavy downpour.
John turns his head and sees their hands touch over the cup. He can’t decide if they’re together or not, but feels like he’s intruding on something as they continue to exchange brisk conversation.
Sherlock glances sidelong at John and, at John’s attentive nod, pushes on with growing excitement.
The barista sees him. Sherlock sees the barista – and stops in his tracks.
“I wouldn’t,” John said firmly.
He was greeted with a brief flash of her affronted expression before he turned, doing his best not to visibly sprint away, heedless of potential casualties. As he neared the bar, eyes searching frantically, he spotted Donovan and thought that never before had he been so relieved to see the sergeant.
It isn’t every day that a dashing young man declares his name is Felicity.
), not from a wealthy background (
?” John looked stricken, and was definitely glad that he had finished eating.
The left pocket of her high-necked, short crimson playsuit dipped with the weight of her mobile phone, though clearly not with a wallet. A small purse was clutched in her left hand, which he assumed held the unaccounted-for item. She was looking at him with an expression of casual interest that spoke of intrigue, but not of desperation. Sherlock almost sighed with the sudden relief that flooded through him following that deduction.
Maybe he was a romantic after all.
“Sorry, what?” The feeling of bobbing up and down in a large body of water resurfaces.
An idea occurred to Sherlock that made the corner of his lips twitch upwards.
There is a tinkle of solemn, sombre laughter.
He wants to persuade this profoundly
John’s thoughts are spinning in his head with such alarming rapidity that he feels dizzy and slightly nauseous. There is a plane right beside them, Mary not far off, a security guard of Mycroft’s almost certainly standing too close and definitely eavesdropping, and Sherlock is
In his horrified and bewildered state, all Sherlock can do is smile. It’s a tiny, fragile thing, and John realises that it’s the mark of someone who’s used to having their most pessimistic expectations of a certain situation be justified – up until now. He’d seen it on Harry’s face the day he ran after her and told her he’d always love her, right after their father had thrown her out of their house.
John wants to kiss the idiot’s adorable lopsided grin – so he does.
Now, he realised, staring at John’s hands, there was more than just a boundary that could be ignored.
John hadn’t worked a morning shift in the place before yesterday – or, not one that Sherlock had graced – and therefore had no real evidence to support the assumption of his return. Had something Sherlock said or did given him away? Did John somehow manage to notice, amongst serving an endless line of customers, that Sherlock walked through the door with the ease of someone who had done the same thing a hundred times before? That he didn’t glance up to survey the drinks menu? Did Sherlock merely seem like a creature of strict habit?
“Er, we’re sorry, mate.” The man spoke directly into the detective’s face and it felt like every cell in Sherlock’s brain started simultaneously screaming at him to move as far away from this stranger’s breath as possible. “Me wife’s a bit of a fan, y’know.” He inclined his head in her direction.
Sherlock knew that he was wasting precious time, that he should move on to the next woman – the next potential murderer. He had the repulsive sense that there was something he was missing, a stray thought nagging at the edge of his stifled mind, just beyond the clutches of his fingertips. Something was strange, different, notable.
“The second body spelt a case you’d be interested in.”
No more of this.
He approaches the counter slowly, feeling obliged to buy something now that he’s here.
Mycroft is visibly surprised, and Sherlock tries not to deduce what goes through his brother’s head when he asks to speak to John. The nosey git has
“Too close an encounter. I’m fine now.” As he spoke, Sherlock turned slightly away from the sergeant, gaze roving over the crowd.
“Er, Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you–?” John’s gaze drops to his feet as his shoes shuffle awkwardly, but he is interrupted by the sound of the door being pushed open with a sure hand. Inwardly, he’s grateful, as he wasn’t certain how the end of his sentence would have come out –
“Hi, what can I get for you?”
“Who knows?”
*   *   *
“Good to know.”
“Maybe it says something about me and how – how fucking self-destructive I am, that I’m willing to stay with you despite things like this. Not to mention the fact that I was
“Yeah. I, uh –” John fumbles with something that the counter blocks from Sherlock’s view, glancing down at whatever it is he holds in his hands. “I’m not supposed to do this, but I figure I can make an exception.”
Sherlock hummed in response.
“I really ought to –”
“I’m still making up my mind.”
John scrubbed a hand over his face. “So, like you, basically.”
Sherlock rubs his eyes. Inhales. Exhales. Then he grabs some clean clothes and strides to the bathroom to brush his teeth.
“You two didn’t get on?”
Sherlock stilled. John knew he’d said something very wrong but didn’t have the presence of mind to contemplate exactly which part it was. His flatmate rose to his feet, abandoning the bucket with the soft rattle of its handle, and finally turned toward him. From his privileged position looming over John, Sherlock directed a level gaze at him and said, “Well, if you’re offering.”
“I love you too, Sherlock.”
Mike’s grin unfurls like hawk’s wings. He’s enjoying himself far too much, it seems.
“The point is I was taking a bath, which is generally a private activity, and you felt there was something so
When John finally awoke, it was to a veritable assault on his senses. His mouth was parched beyond recognition, as though it had been rubbed raw, coated in glue, and desert sand had been sprinkled liberally onto every inch. Although his back was suspiciously lacking in the assorted aches he usually experienced after a fitful night’s sleep, his head was positively pounding, seeming ready to split open at the slightest movement. This was not alleviated by the insistent ringing of what John’s sleep-addled mind soon realised was a mobile phone.
Several excruciatingly long minutes later, Sherlock had concluded with absolute certainty that this woman was not the murderer. She had executed a surprising number of dance moves, all apparently in an effort to appear desirable, and most with the horrifying aim of either groping him or grinding on him. Despite her lack of a purse, he had considered it worth investigating her further; the height of her boots could have served as a potential place to stash a weapon.
A grin spreads across Sherlock’s face before he can reign it in. He feels his eyes crinkle at the corners with the sincerity of it.
Sherlock’s eyes linger on John, mesmerised once more by the simple processes and how very not-simple they seem when performed by this particular barista. He’s almost disappointed when he realises his coffee is ready.
The queue is longer than usual. The man before Sherlock is arguing in an obnoxiously loud, disdainful tone about how it’s
“Doppio, two sugars?”
Just the thought of losing John made cases with serial killers less compelling – what was becoming of him?
“That’s enough.” Lestrade sounded tired already. “Now don’t be idiots and keep your eyes open in there, all of you.”
Sherlock swallows heavily, pushing it down, just as he always has done.
He thinks of the Woman. He thinks of the jealous glint in John’s expression when he’d happened upon Irene undressed in Sherlock’s presence; how his dangerous streak had glimmered just below the affable veneer, like the tip of a shark’s fin skimming the ocean’s tranquil surface.
Sherlock thinks ruefully.
(See the end of the chapter for
The wife in question was practically drooling and seemed temporarily incapable of speech.
That it was preposterous that this stranger was sitting across from him, this woman he’d never seen, intruding on their nightly ritual.
“Just a minute.”
Molly grins and shrugs half-heartedly. “A nice Earl Grey’s always a safe bet here.”
“Excuse me, but I believe you owe me a dance.” This time, her voice was strong and clear.
The noise John made in that instant was the most beautiful thing he had ever heard: more captivating than Mozart, more evocative than Tchaikovsky, more beautiful than Brahms.
: the study of how a drug at a certain concentration affects an organism at the site of action, with respect to the drug’s binding with a receptor.
Sherlock can’t breathe. He prides himself on self-control, but for the first time since he was a very small child, he doesn’t want to speak for fear that he’ll start crying.
The sound John made deep in his throat could only have been described as a growl, his eyes narrowing into slits.
Personally, John envied the simplicity of Sherlock’s outfit and how it so easily suited him. He had also foregone a jacket, opting instead for a plain black t-shirt, black jeans and black shoes. The ensemble made him appear even taller, even more unattainable and even more striking than usual.
conditioner – he’d relocated for his purposes. It currently sat on the floor beside the bathtub, seeming very out of place and very, very obvious: his hair wasn’t yet entirely damp.
After one too many awful cups of tea, Sherlock had long ago resolved never to order the beverage, even at specialty cafés. The only hands other than his own that he’ll accept it from are Mrs. Hudson’s and his mother’s.
idea – should’ve learnt manners – personal space – we’ve talked about – how could you – when you know – Sherlock, look at me!”
Sherlock glances across and frowns.
Sherlock glances up just as Mike’s head drops to observe the assorted paraphernalia that litter the laboratory bench before him, all of which he is already familiar with. A tiny, lopsided smile tugs at his lips; Sherlock supposes that he understands the challenge.
Just before the door closed, John caught the edge of a grin on his friend’s face.
“Uh – yes. Sure. Please. That would be nice.” Sherlock’s nodding. Why can’t he stop nodding? He hands over his card.
The overall transformation managed to take years off his appearance, but Sherlock thought there was something missing. John regarded his watchful eyes warily.
“Unlikely,” Sherlock grunted.
Two of the small circle heard him, appearing wholly unconcerned when they looked at the girl. She was decidedly nestling into his shoulder, her eyelids suspiciously droopy. One of the women shrugged and the other leant in, speaking in an aloof manner, “Who cares? About time she found her boundaries. Never has enough to let loose, does she?”
Sherlock continued as if he hadn’t heard him and John suspected that he hadn’t. “There is also the location: inner city, crowded bars and clubs, with the attack occurring in a back alley or neighbouring side street. All three have had fire-related names.”
“My calculus professor has the same effect,” Sherlock says, his tone knowing. “I appreciate mathematics as an art form with its own brand of inherent beauty, and I’ve always had a particular predilection for calculus. But Copeland’s vector calculus class is –” His eyes slip shut for a moment as he shakes his head. “– a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.”
“Lestrade thought the M might stand for Moriarty. He suspected a copycat or an underling,” John supplied, sipping his tea.
Sherlock half-succeeds at suppressing a shiver at hearing his name spoken by that voice.
“That’s the whole of it, if you’re – looking for baby names.”
“Sorry?”
His face is so open that Sherlock pauses for a moment. Holding his phone upright in offering, his eyebrows are raised. This man trusts enough in the judgment of Mike, whom he surely hasn’t had contact with since their university days, to willingly lend his mobile to a complete stranger. A mobile phone is typically an item of such personal attachment – with the contact information of loved ones, messages, photographs, various other individualised details – that Sherlock finds this act particularly telling. This man seems as much of an open book as it is possible for another person to be.
John is confused. Sherlock loves when this happens because it’s often a precursor to his being impressed.
John looks first at the departing woman, then at Mike, who only grins – a little smugly, at that.
“What happened to the lipstick?”
“Oh.”
John was suddenly not embarrassed by this whatsoever.
To everyone else who gets a little in their head sometimes:
Their eyes meet just as John replies, “Anytime.”
John will be surely a great father: he is loving and affectionate, patient and forgiving, emotionally strong and a natural carer. He will be an exceptional father and Sherlock will not be around to witness it. Sherlock might not even
“She volunteered to go in with you. Well –” The inspector half-rolled his eyes. “– not exactly
different.
Once again, Sherlock half-rolled his eyes. “Don’t be absurd, it’s never twins. It’s also mathematically impossible for four people to be twins.”
“Sherlock!”
Despite his best efforts, they began to creep back in.
“Where? Hold on – did you say she was
, will remain in his life for the foreseeable future, for better or for worse. It therefore seems only logical that Sherlock would very much like to have his phone number. The message reads simply:
At first, their mouths were sloppy, John recovering from his surprise and Sherlock trying to adjust the angle of his torso to something more comfortable. Then Sherlock parted his lips at the same time John’s tongue sought his own, and a cacophony of sensation exploded behind Sherlock’s closed eyelids.
Due to the fact that an early morning shift this near to campus frequently leaves baristas harried and sleep-deprived, and they are more often than not students themselves, the person behind the cash register varies almost as often as Sherlock’s choices. This is a good thing, as it means that none of the names he gives are ever remembered. Every time he enters the coffee shop, he’s once again a blank canvas, unfailingly greeted with, “Hi, what can I get you?” and then, “Name, please?”
Sherlock leaned back, hands resuming their place under his chin.
(See the end of the chapter for
John blinks a few times before his brain catches up with his ears. “Is that it?” he calls to the other man’s back.
these things, always plans and deduces and calculates. He looks away.
His chest rises as he sucks in a lungful of sterilised air. He feels like crumpled balls of paper in an overflowing rubbish bin under a work desk; like frustrated fingers tugging through hair and ideas discarded and scribbled over for good measure.
He thought about telling him what he didn’t already know: about how stupid he still felt for letting his guard down the previous night, about the photograph and Sherlock’s too-recent breach of trust. He imagined that Lestrade would simply tell him that he should’ve known what he’d gotten into when he realised what Sherlock was like and continued to work with him, live with him, be friends with him. He imagined he’d have no idea why Sherlock took the photograph, but he’d probably say something unhelpful and even more unsettling than the issue itself, such as
“I believe I know where the killer will strike next. It continues to elude me as to why
John gaped with furious exasperation as the man spun carelessly, returning to the stupid bucket.
Sherlock only had four initials, and although the killer’s modus operandi had escalated by becoming more violent, John didn’t think that they would extend their spree beyond the four-victim formula. That meant that tonight would denote the end of the chase, for better or for worse.
“Yes?”
Sherlock wonders if he should ask John if he’d like to go out sometime. Dismisses the idea. Grabs at it again. Mentally shoves it out of reach – or at least into a drawer for later contemplation.
Sherlock frowned in dislike at the name and confusion at the question.
“What? What happened to him?” Sherlock rounded on her, chin raised and eyes narrowed, but she had turned to face the dance floor, too.
is happening.
John accepts it with a nod, even though Sherlock always
For his part, Sherlock is taken aback by the piercing question, and John thrills at the knowledge that he guessed correctly.
Closing his eyes, he rested his head only briefly on the headboard behind him before he remembered Sherlock’s mobile. It was only when the man wished to completely immerse himself in his thoughts that he was ever not in the same room as the device. John crawled to the edge of the bed and rummaged in the top drawer to retrieve it.
Desperate attempts to convince himself that a name was just a name – not that important; he could have any name and it wouldn’t change who he was, really – failed remarkably. They gathered their things, having finally decided to split the bill, and exited the restaurant. The tinkle of the bell was cut off abruptly as the door shut behind them.
“Go forth and fend off the groping, freak.” Donovan’s parting words were accompanied by a mock-salute.
Seeing his frown, Irene takes pity on him by breaking the silence. “Sherlock, it’s been a whole week and I haven’t heard a peep from you. You’re lucky I didn’t show up to your place at 3 in the morning. Either it was a truly awful date or you slept with him and now you’re wishing you hadn’t.”
Sherlock nods a final farewell before he leaves. He’s two streets away before the reality of John’s goodbye crosses his mind. His homebound stride comes to a stop as an expression of horror falls onto his face.
*   *   *
“I know it is. I’m fine, I promise. And – thanks.”
It starts out as a matter of necessity, really.
one could be so dim is frankly beyond him). He cycles through whichever names take his fancy, whether that of a scientist whose paper he’d read the night prior, one he’d heard on his journey to the coffee shop, or – as on one particularly flustered occasion – the one printed on the barista’s own name tag. They spell it correctly, even if he’s directed a decidedly quizzical gaze in response.
), not an only child (
John had shot down the idea before Sherlock could even suggest it aloud, the determined set of his expression making it clear that this was not something on which a compromise could be reached. This was a matter of personal safety, and they both knew that in such circumstances, only one of them was right.
Resolving to come in earlier tomorrow, and without making a complete, childish fool of himself, Sherlock only permits himself to steal a brief glimpse of John’s eyes before he departs. Somehow, this man feels dangerous.
Sherlock looks away and John sees it all: sees the half-hearted, cloaked question, the yearning and the regret. He even sees the resigned request:
“Here you go.” His card and coffee are both placed on the table. John’s eyes are twinkling and Sherlock thanks him again.
Raising his eyes slowly, Sherlock finds that John was already watching him. A shiver runs through him that has nothing to do with the chill of the evening air. He abruptly stops walking in front of a flat bearing the number 221. Pulls John over to the stoop with some urgency.
He sat up as slowly as he could, levering himself upright with both hands braced firmly on the mattress beside him. His headache lifted slightly, just enough to think a little clearer, now that the noise that had disturbed him had ceased.
Sherlock bends to tap his student card, then walks through the automatic doors, tucking the card back into his pocket.
Then he surprises Sherlock with a fervent remark that Professor Byrne – Sherlock’s ecology professor, who taught pharmacology subjects for a grand total of three semesters – has an extraordinary gift for making any possibly-interesting subject an absolute bore.
Sherlock snorts, then heaves a deep sigh. “We didn’t have sex.”
no problem for
“I wonder what type of fan they are.”
“Problem?”
“Experiment,” came the short answer.
But her height was all wrong. She was far too tall.
“Honestly, I don’t remember a thing about him.”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.” He smiles something huge that could too easily be misconstrued as sardonic and regrets it with the startling immediacy of a punch to the stomach.
“A lie is a terrible start to a relationship, Irene.” The admission is quiet and Irene picks up on its unspoken implications. “What if he comes to the flat and talks to Mrs. Hudson? What if he sits in on a lecture with me and sees my notebook? What if Mycroft –?”
With a sigh and the momentary flicker of her eyes closing and reopening, Donovan stepped closer to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
The two men meet eyes over the counter as Sherlock approaches. Both fail quite spectacularly to temper their matching grins.
“It’s not just my name,” he continues quietly. “It’s everything that goes along with it. The pomp and circumstance –” He makes verbal quotation marks around the phrase. “– of Sherlock the freak, who somehow bribes his way out of assigned group tasks because he prefers to work alone; who stays late in the chemistry labs because he’s trying to build an atomic bomb –”
John tried not to compare the cold, limp cadaver he had seen in the alley to the woman she had been, alive and in torturous pain for the twenty or so seconds it would have taken for her torn lungs to exhaust their supply of air.
“Gavin.”
“It matters to me!” Sherlock bursts out hotly.
“No,” Sherlock said quickly. “There was another attack last night – Lestrade texted me about it. A woman was found with fatal knife wounds to the femoral arteries. She also had bruising around the mouth and neck, and an S burnt into her, all of which are believed to have been inflicted – or at least begun – ante-mortem. Similar appearance to the previous victims.”
John wonders quite wildly if this strange man has a microchip in his head, or possesses a google search engine in place of a brain. He immediately scolds himself for having had the idea, as the man before him is surely the most undeniably human creature he has ever come into contact with. Whether he proves to be a genius or a magician remains to be seen, but something tells John that no magician would appear so content to perform before such a small audience.
“I know, just – please. I love you, Sherlock Holmes. Since the very first moment. And I always will.”
Their eye contact for the next few seconds is so intense that Irene feels like her eyes might water.
Sherlock has been avoiding John and they both know it. How will John react when he finally comes clean with the truth about who he is? Will they be able to get past the lie?
“Three?” John’s head tilted along with the question. If Sherlock had been less focused on the case, he would have marvelled at how open John was, especially given the recency of their conflict. “You think it was her who drugged me?”
“I wouldn’t expect you to. I know you well enough by now,” John said on a sigh.
“You always count yourself out before you’ve even given yourself a chance.” She narrows her eyes at him and cocks her head, effectively silencing his impending protests. “I’m sure you went on the date nervous and excited for the possibility of a
Sherlock didn’t know if they
“Sherlock, why –” John looked like he was trying very, very hard to retain a semblance of calm. “– why the
John looks so earnest, so kind, still seeing the best in him despite his total lack of communication. “I thought we had a good time and then you didn’t reply to my texts and I guessed you’d changed your mind. Which is fine!” he hastens to add. “But then you stopped coming in to the café too and I thought – have I done something wrong?”
,” he articulated, enunciating each word with precision.
After too many mornings of misunderstandings, misspellings, mispronunciations, and an overall increase in Sherlock’s misanthropic tendencies, he finally resigns himself to giving a false name.
Due to technical issues, I had to delete and repost this chapter. I've now learnt not to use ao3's draft function. Carry on.
“And how the hell did you know I study medicine?”
“No! I didn’t experiment
It does, however, present a problem in the more mundane aspects of his everyday life. One such aspect is the practice of ordering beverages.
) Some slight amusement hides in his expression.
, John, don’t you see?” Sherlock leant forward without warning, his eyes widening, allowing John a glimpse of his trademark manic energy. “It may be to get our attention, but don’t mistake that for meaning I am ultimately the intended victim.”
Instead, Sherlock stares at the text message and thinks,
Hands paused mid-gesture, like a puppet suddenly finding itself without instruction, it appeared that Sherlock had finally taken stock of his friend. John’s face seemed frozen and distant, as if there were an invisible wall standing stoic between the two men. Sherlock was used to having the ability to decipher John’s mood from his body with a glance, so often did the other man allow himself to be seen candidly in Sherlock’s presence. He was used to noticing where boundaries would have been between ordinary people in their situation and stepping over them after a mere moment’s thought.
If you're still reading, thank you so much. I love you, really.
John made his way to his chair and sat down, trusting his feeling that this could continue for a while.
, even now, holds immeasurable significance.
When they found a half-vacant lounge to sit on – blatantly ignoring the snogging couple intertwined at the other end – the two men were silent for a while, sipping their drinks and observing. Donovan made eye contact with them from her place near the bar and inclined her head in a marginal way.
Still, he isn’t exactly sure why he’d need that information.
“His voice put me to sleep three Tuesday mornings in a row!” John’s eyes widen slightly in earnest, and Sherlock hastens to agree. The professor’s voice could rival a moralising minister for its degree of monotony. “I was actually excited for
Sherlock ignored the commotion behind him, bending to examine the bucket on the floor, tilting it this way and that to regard its contents. John had completely overlooked it upon first entering the room.
A weak chuckle, eyes averted. Sherlock feels the urge to reach out and raise John’s chin just so he could see the amused twinkle in his eyes, however faint it might shine at the present moment.
“So this experiment…” John began around a mouthful of jam.
John carefully repositioned his thumb and middle finger to clasp around the base of his cock, wanting to both cease the further flow of blood to the area, and retain that which was already pulsing there.
A tired sigh.
When they arrived in the side street – the main road being where the club, Element, was located – Lestrade was waiting, cloaked in near-darkness but for the faint moonlight. An unmarked car sat nearby, and John spotted Donovan and another detective chatting not far off. Lestrade directed a nod of greeting at John and paused with his eyes on Sherlock as they approached. Then he cleared his throat.
His eyes remained closed, unable to force himself to look at his best friend’s face.
Hope you liked the chapter!
The detective turned absentmindedly to a woman with a soft smile and unassuming eyes, stepping just barely into her personal space – just enough to capture and hold her attention. A slight sheen of sweat adorned her hairline, but the woman’s breathing was regulated as if she were home seated in her living room, doing something so subdued as observing the frivolity of evening television.
