Sorry for the long wait. I’ve been busy lately and haven’t had the time to sit down and write. I have several new chapters finished and will be uploading them this week.
Dean woke up the next morning, his eyes heavy with sleep. Blinking hard a few times, his vision became clear and he saw Sam next to him. Sam was still asleep, Dean thought about how peaceful he looked. He took the time to study his little brother’s features. The curve of his nose, the shape of his eyebrows, the way his hair hung over his face.
“I know, Cas. I… I’m nervous Sam and I won’t ever be the same. What if he doesn’t truly want me when I’m me again?” Dean’s voice broke slightly.
Running his tongue just under the head of Sam’s cock, he took the tip into his mouth. Slowly swirling his tongue around it, letting it slide across the slit. Then slowly making his way down the length. Tongue moving side to side, swallowing as he went. Tasting every last inch before he reached the base. Mouth full, lips stretched wide. He stayed there at the base for a moment, before pulling back up. Dean repeated this a few more times, all while making sure he never stopped moving his hand on Cas’ cock.
What did matter was getting through this day and the next couple without any issues. Sex wasn’t an issue of course, he was Dean Winchester after all.  The issue was being stuck in the bunker and knowing the effects the curse has on Sam and Cas would end up causing issues after Rowena fixes things.
Dean shut the door behind him and dropped his towel. His cock was already hard, throbbing and begging to be touched. He made his way over to Sam and stopped in front of him. Sam looked up at Dean and back down to his cock.
The two hunters and their angel stopped, frozen. Rowena was here early. They could hear her heels click against the hard floor as she made her way to the library. They had forgotten that she could get in, and she just had to show up at the worst possible time.
Dean slammed his bag down onto the table. Tired and dirty from the hunt he and Sam just got back from. He’d worry about the witches curse tomorrow, she said it wouldn’t take effect until he woke up anyways. Besides, he was beat, sleep was all he could think about at this point.
“Dean…” The pitying look is back, so Dean looks away. “Forgive me if I’m not relieved it’s just the car! You could have been
“Wind’s messing up your primroses out there, baby. I’ll figure something to shield them this weekend,” Dean told him as he moved through the open-plan room, shrugging off his leather jacket and dumped it on the dining table. Cas’ phone, which lay on the counter alongside a pile of folders that were probably book reports from his students, was playing ‘Talk’ by Kodaline. Cas was singing along quietly under his breath, though he cut off with a little hum when Dean pressed himself to his back. He wound his arms tight around Cas’ torso, his fingers making a beeline for the hem of his shirt.
“If that’s what you think, then why are you here? Just to rub my nose in it? Just to break my heart even worse?”
“You’re a hitman! You kill people! You can’t possibly still have a heart! You, what… go out and shoot a mark, then come home and beg me to fuck you through the mattress, so you don’t have to think about what you just did? How could you?! How do you live with yourself?!”
“All about that positive reinforcement,” he educated Sam as they scuttled along behind Henriksen, keeping low, their teams fanning out behind them.
“You want me to beg?” Cas gritted out, when Dean let his thumb swipe under the head a moment before he took his hand away completely.
She shrugged. “Yeah, Sam sure as hell doesn’t always make the best choices. But is there really a need to preserve identities anymore, now we’re making a deal with the Novak’s? Maybe Sam wanted to give Castiel a sense of a bond forming between them, to make Castiel feel like he wanted to open up to him more? Or maybe your brother just wanted to feel a little closer to someone who means so much to you?”
There was only one thing Dean was sure of, one thing that he could hold on to with certainty; he still loved Cas and he didn’t have the energy to be able to pretend that he could stop.
But Jessica’s legs seemed not able to support her weight, and after helping her stumble to the door, Cas quietly asked if she would be OK with him carrying her. She nodded and seemed to drop completely as he hoisted her up easily in his arms. Raphael, who had been impassive and silent the whole time, took point again as the group scurried from the room.
“Well, I’m not. I’m not fucking OK, angel, Jesus Christ, how could I be?!” Dean told him blandly and Cas gasped a little down the phone as if that caused him pain.
“I loved you!” He all but screamed in Cas’ face. “I love you so much, more than anything! I’m sorry if I’m having a hard time coping with all that, that life we had, that love we had, coming to an end!”
When Cas kicked the locked door open Dean ran straight in, even as the woman inside screamed and huddled over the baby in her arms, shielding the infant with her body.
Dean edged through the door gun first, letting his eyes adjust to the bright light from the single bare bulb that illuminated a figure slumped in a chair. But he had to keep blinking even after his vision had cleared and he had pushed his helmet up, because the guy that lifted his head was more familiar to Dean than anyone else in the world.
,” Dean continued. “I was getting by. I was coping, kind of. Now I’m talking to you and I feel like pure shit all over again and all my progress has been blown sky-high. You just… you fuck me up so much!”
As it was, Dean didn’t get over the hurt of the folder and Cas’ lies so much as he accepted it, woke up one night at 2 a.m. and simply pushed it all aside, into a dusty, unused corner of his brain where it wouldn’t hurt if he didn’t let it.
Cas’ chest was heaving, and his cock was starting to stiffen under Dean’s gaze. When he didn’t respond to the question, Dean ran a hand over the thickening length to make him pant, loving the way it hardened under his touch.
When he reached the door he tapped in the day’s pin code onto the sensor and waited for the whir and click of the lock to release. Cas had insisted on installing the high-tech security feature when they’d bought the house; Dean had been a little surprised, but hadn’t complained. He'd install ten if it meant keeping Cas and their home safe. Proximity to Dean automatically meant danger, not that Cas could possibly know that. Dean rubbed at his tired eyes as he pushed the door open, the tension lifting clean off his shoulders, evaporating out of his skin as soon he was over the threshold. He dropped his car keys in the bowl by the door and called out “Angel?” as he toed off his shoes, even though he could already hear Cas in the kitchen at the other end of the house.
Sam reached across the hood and slid the journal over to where he could see it. He paused for a minute, skimming the page. “One.”
Dean rose to his feet, standing guard behind Sam as his brother steeled himself. Sam wrapped one hand around the door handle, gripped his machete with the other, and pulled.
He looked relieved when Dean mercifully interrupted. “Yup,” he said simply, gathering what little courage he had to step forward and sling an arm around Cas’s waist.
This whole thing – him saving Jenny’s life, almost ending Sam’s, only for it all to be for nothing because she hadn’t heard Cas at all – only made the rage that was all too familiar to Dean bubble up in his throat. “Fucking useless,” he muttered.
split through the air. Every light bulb in the library flickered and buzzed as Dean’s wings snapped into their dimension, knocking books off the shelves and scattering Sam’s piles of notes across the tables.
He didn’t quite know why there was a twinge of nervousness coiled just beneath his ribs. They’d fought
Dylan responded by elbowing his brother until he woke up. The boy bolted upright before making eye contact with Dean and scrambling back in a panic.
The Empty lunged forward toward Cas, and as soon as it moved, the hundreds of corpses broke free from their stasis. They surged forward in a wave of flailing arms and hands, grabbing at Dean’s ankles and wrists and arms and throat, trying to pull him under. “
“Hm,” Cas paused as he mulled it over. “It’s difficult to choose. From what’s visible here, I’d have to say that one.” He pointed up high over the horizon, and Dean had to crane his neck to see it.
Dean had sat on the cold floor of the bunker’s interrogation room for hours after the Empty dragged Cas away to an unreachable plane, just trying to process it. The only angel to ever truly love, so full of life and feeling, now locked away in an eternal expanse devoid of any of that.
Dean didn’t so much nod as he did bob his whole head up and down in agreement. The barn was swaying in his vision like a ship on the ocean. He shut his eyes to stave off the vertigo that came with losing so much blood. In this weakened state, it should be safe to let the Empty back in without it being able to make him dangerous. Hopefully.
“The masks stopped it from jumping into one of us,” she continued. “Then… it would make them murder their own kid.” She shuddered. “They’re just conscious enough to know what they’re doing, but they can’t stop it. I never knew why it liked to do it that way, but if it fed off of
“Walk it off,” Dean grumbled. She was a vampire; the dead man’s blood had likely started to wear off by now. She was fine to limp around on her own. They’d left her alive, and that was enough of a courtesy by Dean’s standards.
Dean grimaced. “Yeah, don’t you think that’s giving Chuck a little too much credit?” It was more of a statement than a question. Chuck’s name still left a bad taste in his mouth. Sure, they were free now – free to die boring, slow deaths of high cholesterol or, in Sam’s case, some kind of other boring way normal people died. They were free to stumble through the rest of their existences with no real cosmic purpose. Just saving people, hunting things, the good ol’ simple family business.
Dean dropped his head to the headrest with a thunk. “With the pace you drive, probably more like four.”
“The ’86 one was in Dover,” Dean tilted the journal to make out his dad’s messy handwriting. “There was an earlier one in ’82 up in Akron, and it looks like,” he flipped the page. “There was a later one in 1990 as far down as Cambridge that Dad wrote down but never checked out.”
Dean clenched his jaw and shut his eyes as the Impala scraped over the body. They could feel the steel undercarriage cutting over every excruciating inch of Cas’s body until finally, the Impala broke free, and it was just pavement under her tires once again.
At 2am, Dean stood and stretched his stiff muscles, blinking hard to try and wake himself up. He wandered about the desks looking for Henriksen, trying not to disturb his colleagues, be they resting too or hunched over their computers, trawling CCTV for any sign of vehicles or men associated with the Novak family’s rival.
Dean took the corner slowly, keeping his shoulder pressed to it. Sam was right behind him, closer than he was meant to be, but old habits die hard. Dean dropped one hand from his gun to brush the back of his gloved fingers against his brother’s forearm, their silent code for
Dean couldn’t take his eyes off him, couldn’t align the fact that the man before them, the man he’d stumbled upon in the back room of that shady warehouse just one hour ago, was truly him, his love, his Cas. He felt like he was waiting for something to happen that would explain it all – a pin to drop, Sammy to suddenly scream ‘April Fools’, or for Ashton Kutcher to pop out from behind the door telling him he was being punk’d.
“Today must have been a shock. First you get kidnapped, then Dean comes busting in with the FBI and saves you. He must have been the last person you expected to see. What do you know of his background?”
“No,” Dean used his big brother voice, putting as much authority into the word as he could. “We’re going home. You need a good sleep in a proper bed.”
“Well unfortunately for Michael, I don’t give a crap about his preferences,” Dean replied, trying to keep the anger from his tone, one arm wound around his brother’s waist. Sam was quiet, his eyes on Cas. Dean’s heart was lodged in his throat, constricting it with his fury, as he looked up at the sadness and uncertainty on his brother’s face.
“I was gonna propose on our anniversary,” he told him, and Cas whimpered a little through his tears.
Dean thought he was moving fast, that he was thrusting as deep as he could, but it apparently wasn’t enough. Cas pressed their bodies together with all his strength and grumbled in his ear, “Come
It’s all of his details, his real details; everything Cas could have ever wanted to know about Dean Winchester’s life, from his family, to his high school grades, to his social security number, to his cover identity working at Singer Auto Repair, all spelled out in Times New Roman size 12 font.
“You think I’m going to talk, think again you fucking… what the… Dean?!” Cas gasped, the shock evident on his face, even under his split lip and the cut over his left eyebrow that was dripping blood down his face.
Dean and the strange man eye each other with barely concealed suspicion, before the stranger turns and says something to Cas in a language Dean doesn’t know.
“I said so much bullshit earlier, I’m sorry. I’d never want anything to happen to you, I never wanted anything to happen to you, that’s why…”
He let out a cry of disappointment when Cas let him go, but it morphed into a sob of relief when Cas only turned him and pressed him back against the shower wall. With a smirk, Cas kissed him once then sank slowly to his knees at Dean’s feet, dragging his mouth and hands down Dean’s torso as he went.
. Not me, not him. You. You’ve made me into your soldier, had me battle your wars, and for what? To lose the man I love, to have the heartbreak of his brother’s wife and daughter being kidnapped drive us further apart? Everything that affects him affects me too! You’ve hemmed me in well, Michael, but you cannot possibly think that I will not allow it!”
“Shit, angel!” Dean turned his mouth to Cas’ neck, sucked at the spot below his jaw that always made him writhe. Cas didn’t disappoint, letting out a soft cry when Dean pressed his tongue to the sensitive skin, his body beginning to squirm.
know what Dean really does, who he really becomes when he steps outside their front door each morning.
Sam was on his feet before Dean could say anything, and Cas waited for Dean to precede him out of the room.
Cas was at the bottom of the stairs, pulling on his trench coat when Dean caught him and shoved the balled-up hiking socks into his hands.
Cas laughed, then shook his head. “Ah, no. I have no idea what I’ll do. But whatever it is, I’ll be with you. If you still want me, that is.”
Dean paced a little in front of Cas’ table, shooting him glances but failing to string any sentences together. Cas’ eyes followed him, but he didn’t speak either.
His brother’s arm were wrapped around his chest before Dean could say anything to fuck up his own life any worse, and for the second time in one day he was hauled out of a room by Sammy while staring into Cas’ helpless eyes – his face the picture of betrayal and grief.
He has no contact with Cas, not a single call or text. He doesn’t try to contact him either, though he opens their text thread often, just to check. The last messages are always the same ones, from the day before life went to shit.
“We’ve come for his stuff,” he told Dean after a while, before he started digging in the pocket of his coat. Dean tensed, expecting a weapon, but the guy just produced a handful of loose skittles and started eating them straight from his palm.
They held each other with the finality thick in the air between them. Cas rested his forehead against Dean’s but wouldn’t kiss him. Dean gazed into his eyes, tried to memorise their exact shade of blue, the feeling of holding him. He pressed Cas as tightly as he could to his chest, but he couldn’t bring himself to tell Cas he loved him because he didn’t know what he felt anymore. The last time he’d said it had been in this same spot twelve hours earlier when he’d kissed Cas goodbye that morning, not knowing that it would be the last time.
have done!” Jody spat. “All that matters now is how we proceed. We made a successful hit against the Masters family today, and it’s a good thing we recovered Castiel safely. But we still don’t know exactly why they had him or what they were planning to do with him. What we
“Why is he giving himself away?” He muttered to Charlie, who’d just re-entered the room in time to hear what his brother had said.
Thank you so much to my amazing betas from tumblr; @studio-hatter, you have been so lovely and supportive and I couldn't have done it without you, I <3 you; @gracelesstars, your endless patience and epic help have been so amazing and your comments elevated this fic so much, and I <3 you; @whosthathufflepuff, my parabatai, my better half, my bff (Felicia Day said it, so its canon), you already know I <3 you.
“Come home?” he whispered instead against Cas’ lips when they pulled apart. “The rest… we’ll work it all out as we go.”
“Whatever, have it your way, little bro. You always do. See ya around, Dean-o,” one last withering look was sent Dean’s way, and then the guy was gone, another handful of skittles already on its way to his mouth as he swept out the door.
“Victor Henriksen,” Dean’s boss shook Michael Novak’s hand. “I’m sorry for what happened to your family.”
But now Cas was gone, with just a car and a ring and a folder left behind. Only Cas wasn’t gone, not really, because Dean couldn’t let him go. And he wasn’t staying gone either, because he kept fucking coming back, even if only to keep telling Dean it was over.
When Dean’s home, during evenings and weekends, he seems to just wander about the house, feeling out of place. He finds himself picking up things at random and putting them down elsewhere just because he can; just because it might summon Cas to his side to complain that he was messing up the neatly arranged shelves or the order of the remotes on the coffee table in the living room. The house gets dirtier and smellier because Dean can’t summon the energy to clean and his diet comes to consist of toast, coffee, takeout, and beer.
Dean had punched the first officer that had come forward brandishing cuffs at Cas until Henriksen’s bark of 'WINCHESTER' and Sam’s arms clamping around him had put a stop to that.
“It’s a good thing you’re finally coming home. I think all the plants are dead and also there’s no food in the house and I don’t know how to pay the water bill.”
Cas looked down at Dean once more as he hefted his sole bag onto his shoulder, the battered leather carryall that Dean always made fun of because it looked so shabby.
“Should have fucked you harder, obviously,” Dean spat, not missing the way Cas’ jaw clenched and forgetting Sam’s existence entirely. “If I’d worn you out properly, you wouldn’t have been able to out-play me.”
“You really think I want to talk to you? Why do you keep doing this to me?!” Dean spat when he picked up, because of course he fucking picked up.
“Michael’s finally got Crowley on the line. He promises that Mrs. Winchester and the little one are both fine. He’s willing to make a trade.”
“Uh… Yeah,” Dean turned to grin at her over his shoulder; she was slumped against Cas’ chest as he carried her, looking ready to fall asleep. “We sometimes call Sam ‘Junior’ at the office because it gets too confusing when the boss is screaming ‘Winchester’ every five seconds. So, I figure this one is Junior Junior.”
Dean, because he’s weak, climbs onto the bed next to Cas as he wolfs down the food without complaint. Five minutes later he’s asleep against Dean’s chest, the plate abadoned on the nightstand.
Dean gasped into it, then gasped again when Cas slid his tongue into his mouth. He let his hips rock down gently and Cas’ legs tightened before he ran his hands down Dean’s back, only stopping when he reached his ass, which he squeezed.
“Is Sam with you?” Cas’ voice was weird, strained, like his throat was too tight to get the words out properly, so he was pushing them out half-formed.
“One of the rotations of it, yeah. We take turns to trail your boring little life. It’s all very democratic, but it's the only thing that keeps Cas under control.”
“God, baby, why can’t this work? Why do we have to go through this? Why don’t we just try?” Dean groaned, still not understanding. He’d never understand.
Taking the bait, he calls back, “Hey, angel!” and ignores his heart when it just about stutters up into his throat at saying those words. He listens to the rustling sound of Cas taking off his trench coat, then his footsteps moving down the hall to the open-plan kitchen and living area. The house still looks a mess, so the expression on Cas’ face when he steps into the room isn’t that of a man impressed.
“Dean, knock it off,” Sam scolded. “I know you’re hurt, and I’ve been trying to be patient with you and give you your space but there are
Dean’s teeth grazed Cas’s lip, and Cas hummed into his mouth. He nipped at Cas’s lip, and was rewarded with a rough almost-moan that set the back of Dean’s neck on fire. But just when Dean thought he was in the driver’s seat here, Cas dug his fingers deep into Dean’s wing and carded them through his feathers. Dean groaned. He tightened his grip around Cas and broke the kiss as a shudder rattled though his body. A distant thought needled into his brain,
The Empty could torture him, but it could not break him. Greater forces than it had tried, and failed, in the past.
The vampires were wearing masks that covered their entire faces, but he could hear them snarl and knew the unmistakable wet grinding sound of their fangs scraping over their human teeth.
He pushed himself to a stand, spitting out a mouthful of downy feathers into his hands and wiping them down the front of his flannel. The crunch he’d heard had just been the crackling of fallen leaves, he realized with relief. Not his wings, not his bones. He squinted and turned, trying to get his bearings and—
“I hate this,” Dean said suddenly, sitting up to pull another beer out of the carton. “Why’s there have to even
By the time Sam stepped into the library, he’d heard Jason Manns croon out that song about four times too many. Sure enough, his iPod was no longer in the Impala; rather, it was plugged into a speaker set on one of the library’s tables.
Sam laughed a little. It was hesitant, but genuine. Dean reveled in the hint of normalcy the moment brought, but it didn’t last long. As quickly as it began, the moment dropped into silence.
,” she snarled. “Shut up, both of you. I can’t believe you’re the ones monsters literally tell stories about to scare their young. If only they knew what dysfunctional dipshits you are.”
It only took a few minutes. Vampires work fast. There was a low, nagging fear in the back of Dean’s mind that Jenny wouldn’t stop, that she’d just bleed him dry right then and there. But where he lacked trust for this monster – this thing that defied his often black-and-white worldview with her claws and her sympathy – there was a trust in the circumstance. It was a temporary alliance forged in a shared fear and loathing for the same thing that haunted them, and was preying on kids.
“Sam, I- get away from me.” He winced as he tried to wrench his shoulders out of Sam’s grasp. He felt drained of strength. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
“And Cas?!” Sam said, finally releasing Dean from his death grip. He moved to scoop Cas up into a hug of his own, albeit a much more casual one.
Dean felt his heart sink into his gut. He should’ve known this was another one of his Purgatory-era hallucination specials. Cas was gone. It was about time he accepted that.
“Drop the blade,” Dean said from where he lay on the ground, breathing hard. He was still pointing the pistol at Jenny.
Dean didn’t remember who moved first, but the next thing he knew, Cas was on his back in the grass, and Dean was kneeling over him. He paused, breathing hard, staring down at Cas’s face, which was flushed pink with heat. Cas was staring back at him, with an expression on his face that Dean realized he didn’t know how to read.
get it. Dean was ready to open his eyes, to sit up and yell at whoever wasn’t letting him sleep, except—he couldn’t. Dean couldn’t move, couldn’t blink, couldn’t breathe. He was paralyzed where he lay bruised on that dusty, goddamn barn floor.
“’M not healing that for you,” Dean mumbled as he pressed a softer kiss against Cas’s throat. He worked his way down, nuzzling and nipping at Cas’s skin. Cas fumbled to keep up, loosening his tie and undoing the first few buttons of his shirt as Dean scraped his teeth along Cas’s collarbone.
“How do you summon a Lovecraftian entity on accident,” Dean said, more of an accusation than a question.
That … confession. Cas’s final words had torn through Dean’s very soul as though they were Death’s scythe itself.
Once they got the information they needed, they drove out to a secluded field to regroup, since Dean had insisted they check out of the motel and never go back. Sam had just given Dean a puzzled look, but didn’t push him any further. He’d already cornered Dean once in the past 24 hours and been bitten. He wasn’t about to do it again.
“Now, later, me?” Dean coughed out between gasps as Sam crushed his ribs. He patted Sam’s back to tap out, but Sam didn’t quite get the hint.
’s discordant creations. Such wasteful creations they were, it mused with disdain. It looked upon men the way men looked upon meat.
The third shot missed, burying itself into the wooden pillar next to another vamp’s waist -- but two out of three ain't bad. Dean raised his pistol up to his mouth, winked, and blew the tip of the barrel in a kind of wanton challenge.
His lungs struggled to suck in a breath as the air condensed with filth and rot. The black ooze that had been dripping from the outside of the barn now hung in thick strands from the rafters and pooled along the floor in the edges of Dean’s vision. The dense, wet wood of the barn trapped the smell of decay within its stifling walls like ice traps the dark water, and all those unlucky enough to fall into it, below the surface.
And yet, his spirit could not be broken at the gnarled hands of the entity that ruled this realm. Castiel fell shattered for the hundredth, thousandth, millionth time, incalculable against the void of both this world and his vacillating memory.
She sighed, and though she feigned annoyance, there was an undeniable twinge of anger in the gesture.
“Static,” she said, her voice drifting like she was really a thousand miles away. “You’re forgetting the static.”
Dean paused, turning his head to not quite look at Sam over his shoulder, but enough for Sam to take it as an invitation to continue.
But now that he’d obviously, stupidly returned to the reality of being awake inside a confined space with his overly concerned little brother, all bets were off.
Dean just smiled and let out a laugh. “Trust me, kid. He’s still my ‘little’ brother no matter how tall he gets. But it’s still my job to protect him, just like it’s your job to protect your little brother too.”
It took a moment for Dean to realize the scream in pain he’d heard was his own. The Colt exploded in Dean’s hand. Shrapnel shredded the flesh of his fingers, shards of metal and plastic embedding into his bloodied mess of a hand. Deep in his mind, whatever had twined its brambles to choke out his thoughts shrieked in pain and recoiled.
,” Dean groaned, and the air around him rippled and cracked as his wings flared up, shoving the onslaught of corpses back.
Dean lifted his hand to cup Cas’s face, his eyes searching Cas’s for an answer. He flipped through the page of new emotions he’d been compiling in his head, but there was still so much unwritten.
“I think that’s like its home base. It’s the strongest I’ve ever felt it there. Even just now, it should’ve killed all three of us. But it didn’t. I don’t think it was strong enough to get inside the car. To get inside your head again.”
Dean kept his foot firmly on the gas, and as they sped away, he could see Not-Cas in the rearview folding up into a stand, shattered gristle and sinew stuttering and snapping and grinding back into place. It lifted its hand again into that sickening backward wave. The entire time, it never stopped grinning.
Eventually, the tug of his grace began to intensify. He must be growing closer. Feeling trickled back into Dean’s body – he felt his breath hitch, his heart quicken, his wingbeats strengthen. Purpose rushed through him, remapping his deadened nerve endings, piecing him back together. He reached out with a hand he could suddenly feel, ready to pierce the veil of where he flew between planes of reality in this darkened, empty husk of a world—when something snagged around his ankle.
“Cas—“ Dean warned, his eyes widening, as one of his own corpses had staggered to a stand and was reaching for Cas. He felt Cas’s arm stiffen, his hand curling into a fist, and— “Cas,
His bones – the ones he didn’t even know if he still had – ached with weariness. He didn’t know how many times he had drifted into consciousness, slowly regaining awareness of who he was and where, only to collide with the most beautiful glowing light he’d ever seen.
She smirked, her fangs slowly retracting back up into her gums. “Never thought I’d say this to a Winchester,” Jenny said, a hint of fondness edging into her voice. “But I’d better see you two again someday.”
Dean looked back down at his hands, lost for words as he processed that. His fingers worked more of the label off the bottle as he searched to name the emotion washing over him. It wasn’t one he felt often. Where he expected guilt, or fear, like this was somehow his fault, there was only … relief.
But he’d wanted to see it through, to see Heaven get fixed, to make sure they were really, truly free of the Empty. Jack was putting the finishing touches on Heaven's final draft at Cas’s behest, and now, people had a way out. A true end they got to choose, where everyone – no matter how abrupt the circumstances of their death – could stay as long as they wanted, see all their loved ones, and make proper goodbyes. And when they were ready, in a true manifestation of free will, they could choose to truly move on.
The dog leaned into Dean’s hand, and he swore the dog was grinning. For a brief moment, Dean felt a little lighter. He straightened back up and followed the dog into the kitchen, both drawn forward by the smell of something freakin’
The Empty sank deeper into its slumber, a tonic immobility disseminating its consciousness out once more into every capillary of its vastness. It was a rest it had long been denied. But now – now that it was no longer being used as a pawn in a celestial power-grab, now that that abhorrent
Dean killed the lights and cut the engine as soon as the barn started to come into view, letting the Impala’s heavy steel frame roll silently forward until they felt like they were close enough. They used to try parking far away, but had been burned one too many times while trying to make a quick getaway.
Cas squinted slightly, and though his eyes were still locked on the needle, his focus seemed to soften.
Dean still didn’t quite know how to process that. No one had really ever said that to him before, and he’d long ago resigned himself to a life devoid of that kind of love. He didn’t deserve it, and the last time he’d selfishly tried, he almost got Lisa and Ben killed.
Sam shifted in his seat, struggling to think of something to say. Dean felt too listless and distracted to fight it. He was still reeling from the emotional whiplash of that hellish dreamscape. So, he waited.
“And when I ran into it in Billie’s library, all it talked about was wanting to go back to sleep,” Dean said, a realization dawning on him. “Maybe this isn’t about feeding at all. Maybe it’s revenge.”
The pain in his hand had dulled to a numb ache. He wanted so badly to be back in the bunker and out of this hellhole. He’d only agreed to a hunt to distract himself from what had happened to Cas – what he’d
He burst into the barn, turning his body sideways to squeeze into the gap between the doors without slowing down. Dean glanced around frantically in the dark, fumbling to switch on his flashlight.
Dean grumbled an acknowledgement before trying to sneak a piece of bacon fresh out of the skillet, but Sam smacked his hand with the spatula. “
Cas squinted and watched Dean carefully from the corner of his eye, his gaze falling to the oil-black blade in Dean’s grasp before dragging slowly back up to Dean’s face. In that moment, Dean felt – oddly – laid bare.
It still haunted Dean, at times. For the first few weeks they were on the road, Dean had insisted on sleeping in the Impala, the two of them crunching together in a backseat much too small for them both. Dean had tried to stay in a motel. Had tried to overcome it. But his hands were shaking so bad that first night they’d booked a room in Nebraska, he could barely get the key in the door.
Dean tried desperately not to notice that it was the same room from his dream. He said nothing to Sam, who seemed to be back to giving Dean the same wide berth he’d been giving him in the bunker.
,” Sam choked out, finally dropping the paddles. He fell back from where he had been crouching over Dean’s body, drawing his knees in and burying his face in his hands. “You can’t— you can’t leave me.”
“I’m gonna need you to tell me somewhere we can take you where you’ll be safe. Do you have any aunts or uncles or grandparents here?”
“Come here,” Cas rasped, and Dean didn’t have to be told twice. He practically collapsed into the space next to Cas, his wings tucking away into whatever intangible plane angel wings vanished to. He let his head fall on Cas’s chest and slung an arm around him as he zeroed his focus into every steadying breath.
Dean dove to the ground, sliding across the floor – a floor that used to be bone-dry and caked with decades of dust, but was now darkened and smeared with blood. In one swift movement, he scooped up his discarded pistol, pointed it at Jenny’s knee, and fired.
That left them with two real options: a steel plant southwest of the city, or a long-abandoned farm to the east.
“I didn’t think you would stoop so low, Naomi,” he said to the darkness. “But I now know for certain this isn’t him.”
“D-Dean.” The word dragged forth from Castiel’s throat in the desperate rasp of a dying man who knew he was lost beyond reach, beyond rescue, but needed to make his final peace out loud with the world as his only witness. He closed his eyes and leaned his forehead in toward the light, taking a shaky breath – his first breath in what had felt like eons.
Cas ignored him. “You don’t have to, of course,” he said to Jack. “But you deserve a childhood. This doesn’t have to be your eternity.”
It felt good to get back to his roots. Really saving people, hunting things. No more “big bads.” He and Sam may have been forcefully born into the family business, but they’d made it their own. Redefined it outside the confines of revenge and blood. All of these hunts were small time things – Rowena had Hell pretty much buttoned up, and Heaven wasn’t causing problems anymore. It felt small town. It felt anonymous again. With each hunt, Dean’s anxiety eased a little more.
He felt the dull blade of panic drag through his nerves, and while he was sure the tension wouldn’t show on his face, he had much less control over his wings. His feathers betrayed him, fluffing up as doubt and fear rose in his chest and threatened to choke him. This couldn’t last, this couldn’t be real, he was dead, he died alone in that godforsaken barn, he couldn’t breathe, he—
“I have something for you,” Cas said, and this time it came as a whisper in a language Dean didn’t know, yet somehow understood.
Sure, that shit was unsettling. But the bodies weren’t Sam. They weren’t Cas. Hell, they weren’t Charlie or Jack or anyone else he loved. If one of them had to be killed hundreds of times – maybe thousands, by the look of it here – he’d fall on that sword every damn time.
Sam opened his mouth to fire back a retort, but seemed to reconsider. He felt this escalating into another wildly unproductive fight. Dean’s wounds from Cas’s death were still raw, and jabbing at them wasn’t going to fix anything.
The word drifted out from the glimmering orb and hooked into his thoughts. It seemed familiar, as though it carried a gravity with it most other words did not. It felt … like a name, but more personal. Like it belonged to him.
The Impala jostled suddenly as Sam tied up Jenny and shoved her into the trunk. The car dipped under the added weight before readjusting. The boy shot a worried look at Dean, who just shook his head dismissively. “That’s just Sammy putting away a few things.”
“Look what you did to me,” the man who was once a vessel for Cas, but was now a vessel for his torment snarled. “You ripped me apart. You tore my family limb from limb. You
“I remember you ruining my life!” Her voice grew unstable as she rammed Dean’s skull into the floor again.
!” Dean shot him a betrayed look, but Sam only clenched his jaw and sternly side-eyed him in return.
It was still coming from behind him. Dean scrambled around to try and find the source, find where it was standing. But everything around him was empty.
For what seemed like the thousandth time in a world filled with powerful entities intent on tearing them apart, Dean slipped out of Castiel’s grasp, and the suffocating oily tar of the Empty drowned Castiel once more into nothing.
If Dean’s right hand wasn’t all mangled, he would’ve punched Sam hard in the shoulder. He opted for an especially intense
“I’m sorry,” he breathed, pressing his lips against the glass. He clamped his wings in close to his body and freefell further into the dark. He had to find a new way through. “Just hold on a little longer, buddy. I’m coming.”
Dean could feel the sting of a tear at the back of his eyes as he was dragged down into his own darkness. His lungs burned, screaming for air. He scrabbled at the hand on his mouth, sinking his nails into the flesh and –
you.” Dean dug his nails into his palm, resisting the urge to punch the dash until either it broke, or his hand did. He wanted to feel pain, to bleed. It’s what he fucking deserved.
Now, the angel was broken. When the intolerably bright soul vanished, so did the angel’s will. It was no matter, in the end. You don’t hold a grudge against the pig you’ve sent to slaughter.
“I understand the pain I caused you, and your family, viscerally,” Cas said. “The pain of losing a child, of losing the ones you love. And it happened to you by my hands. I am truly sorry.”
Dean leaned back in the patio chair, letting a slow and languid stretch roll through his body. He couldn’t remember the last time he stretched his legs out without feeling his knees pop or his muscles burn. He’d been battered and bruised by the hunt long before the aches of age could settle in to his joints.
Dean just nodded. He sucked in a long, deep breath and slowly exhaled. He needed something more, something to ground him, and moved his hand to grip Cas’s shoulder in return.
Dean leaned forward onto his palms, his chest heaving as he sucked in several deep breaths. The air felt charged, the scent and stillness akin to the moments following a lightning strike. Slowly, Dean pushed away from the ground and rose to a stand, examining his hands. The blue light he’d seen in his veins faded back down, now imperceptible beneath his skin.
The illusion began to melt away, the blades of grass flickering into pale blades of bone, the trees beginning to weep dark gore from between the bark, the angels’ features melting into twisted flesh and teeth. He didn’t dare look back, but he could feel blood beginning to rise from the earth, lapping at his heels.
Dean choked on his beer, a surprised laugh tearing free and causing him to spew some of his drink. He dragged his the heel of palm across his mouth to wipe the beer and spit from his chin. “You
The countless tendrils all leveled their dangerous points toward them, forming an iron maiden of spears that threatened to skewer them both to the void for eternity. Dean clutched Cas close, wrapping an arm around his chest and gripping his shoulder tight, and raised his other, bloodied hand.
He scrolled faster, desperately thumbing down his screen, every muscle in his body clenching, telling him both to run and that he fucked up again, that he wasn’t here when Cas needed him, that—
“You know damn well humans don’t do that,” Dean said, prying out of Cas’s grip and sliding off the bed. He picked up one of his Led Zeppelin t-shirts off the back of his chair and chucked it at where Cas was still curled up under the comforter. “Besides. It’s spring now. Time to wake up.”
He hadn’t meant for it to come across as something so heavy, as such a sacrifice. But it was. Cas went quiet, and he felt the moment hang there in the air between them.
He was terrified the Empty’s blistering vines of darkness would rise up from beneath the floorboards and take Cas away, again, this time forever. Cas rested a hand on Dean’s thigh as he drove, grounding him in the present and not the “what ifs” whirling around his head.
It was dark beneath his wings. Dean had skidded to a stop on his shoulder after throwing his wings around Cas to soften the blow on his (calculated) crash-landing. He wouldn’t admit he didn’t know any other way to land. His shoulder ached from the angelic equivalent of a gear-up landing, but he made no effort to move.
Cas hummed in agreement. They laid there together, quietly leaning up against Baby’s windshield and just …
He directed the question out into the nothing. Cas was gone. Jack was off-world doing whatever it was that God did.
Sam stumbled backward, his back slamming into one of the bookshelves and adding more volumes to the mess of discarded tomes on the library’s floor. “
it. What he’d always believed to simply be a weapon like any other enchanted knife, turned out to be an extension of himself. Of his consciousness. Of his very being. He could feel his grace thrumming into the tip of the blade as it tore through the Empty’s grip on him; could feel it as though it were his own hand clawing through it.
Oh, how wrong his hope had been. His hope that somehow, things had changed. That he was capable of something else. Maybe he would’ve been, had he acted sooner. Had he pulled his head out of his ass, tore through the seams of his repressed feelings and just
I am the God of a thousand in-betweens, of the static in both silence and sound, of the decay when things have yet to die but cannot keep on living, of pus burning under your skin just before blisters form, of the brief blind moment when your eyes have yet to adjust to the dark. But most of all, I am the God of what festers in the wounds of betrayal, between unspoken truths and unwavering guilt.
,” Dean cut him off forcefully. “No badges. They’ve already fucked this up enough. Those kids deserve to feel safe, and that sure as hell won’t be in a police station.”
Cas melted into him, dozing as Dean stroked his head and watched the sky turn pink and orange with the sunset.
Sam glanced up at Dean, clearly expecting an answer. He had quickly figured out there was something Dean hadn’t been telling him – something this vampire seemed to have been clued in on before he was.
Dean balled his left hand into a fist and clocked the vampire right in the jaw, knocking off their mask.
The Empty closed in, readying its thorns to sink into the angel’s flesh. It would drain this one much slower, it thought. It deserved to relish in the flavor of his fears and remorse. It had been so very patient, after all.
Dean barked a laugh at that, a single, humorless jolt of surprise. “Let me tell you a secret,” Dean said, laying back next to Jack. “If anyone tells you they know exactly what they’re doing, they’re lying.”
Dean managed to catch a few minutes of sleep here and there, but mostly he just laid there in the dark with his eyes shut. It felt quiet, and empty, and so very dark.
Jenny was playing it cool, but Dean had seen the look of total, paralyzing fear in her eyes when she heard Cas – scratch that,
Dean reached forward with a shaky hand, resting it on the side of Not-Cas’s sagging face. The second his hand made contact, a blinding pain seared through his palm. He gritted his teeth and kept it pressed to the thing’s cheek, his hand burning and blistering.
Dean didn’t remember this. He didn’t remember running into Cas at all at this house, despite a steady stream of prayers. He’d just figured Cas hadn’t heard him, or hadn’t cared.
Jenny just pointed forward out the windshield, her arms trembling. She was straining her wrists against the rope in panic. “T-that’s not k-Kate,” she stammered. “Who…?”
Dean tore his gaze away and turned, now staring dumbfounded at what was in Bobby’s hand. A piece of crumpled receipt paper, and a cheap ballpoint pen that looked like it was on its last legs. “What?”
“Awesome,” Dean said, and – with his voice shifting into a tone he often used with Jack – turned back to Dylan, who was still clutching the machete. “Now put that thing down before you hurt yourself, and put your seat belts on.”
The soul was so incredibly beautiful. And yet, when his hands ever so gently skimmed the edges of its glimmer, the sadness woven within every strand of light reached out and crushed Castiel’s heart.
it to see someone treat the scythe that way, but Dean thought the Old Death might’ve gotten a kick out of it.
He flexed one wing, slowly unfurling it as wide as it would go. The dark feathers shimmered an iridescent blue-green, reflecting an ocean’s depth he felt he could get lost in. The feathers closest to him were a stark contrast to the primaries, which extended into a brilliant white, and were then tipped in black like a knife’s edge. The further out along the wing he looked, the more translucent the feathers became, the sun glinting through them like stained glass.
Sam,” Dean huffed, grabbing his beer and shoving his chair back to stand. He had to leave, had to get out of here before the room started fuzzing again. Every inch of him was screaming to get back to the prison cell that was his bedroom. Locked up, alone, where he deserved to be. “Nothing good happens in Ohio.”
Cas stared down at them in confusion, raising one eyebrow, but he must have felt the box inside because he eventually freed it from the heel of one of the socks.
“You’re safer here than anywhere else,” Cas carried on, and Dean was opening his mouth to argue when one of Cas’ brothers, the tall, ginger-haired one, popped his head around the briefing room door.
Dean hadn’t uttered a word since they’d left the warehouse, not since he’d watched Cas be driven away from him in the back of a cruiser. Cas had been handcuffed as soon as he’d been led outside because Henriksen had taken one look at him and known more in that second than Dean had in three years.
“Oh my god, angel. What the hell…” Dean holstered his gun, called down his earpiece that the southern rooms were clear, but that they needed a medic. Then he skittered to Cas’ side, stroking his hair back automatically to try and comfort him, before reaching for the ropes binding him to the chair.
“Yeah, baby, right there, just like that,” Cas whimpered at him, his hair beginning to tousle with sweat.

“How soon until Michael comes after us,” Dean dared to ask Cas, once they’d climbed into the Impala.
He had missed-calls galore from his brother, and eventually remembered he was supposed to be at work. Three hours late was better than not at all, right?
He’d been so busy worrying about keeping his own cover protected, keeping his lies straight, that he’d never paid too much attention to Cas’ own eccentricities. He hadn't felt the need to Cas checked out when they'd started seeing each other because it hadn't occured to him that there could be anything that needed checking about the sweet, quiet man. He’d never questioned Cas’ weirdness about security; his late nights out and extended weekends away at ‘conferences’ and ‘meetings’ that Dean was now convinced were hits; the safe in the study that Dean had never bothered to even ask the code for.
Charlie surprised them all by getting over the shock and fury the quickest; she was screaming down the phone at Michael Novak when she came to pick them up from the hospital in Baby 2.0, which Dean had left in the street outside Sam’s place with the keys in the ignition and the engine running.
“So, who the hell is he, and why did those Masters pricks have him?” Dean rubbed at his face before he rounded on Henriksen.
“None of this is safe, Angel,” Dean murmured, but he stood back to let Cas take the lead like he wanted, too tense to argue.
Charlie peeked around the door not long after, ducked aside as Henriksen kicked a filing cabinet in the corner, and hunkered down on Dean’s other side to hold his hand. She eyed the folder with wide and worried eyes, and either read it upside down or didn’t read it at all.
Dean couldn’t get enough. From the soft look of delight in Cas’ eyes when Dean rubbed his spit-wet fingers inside him, which he replaced a few minutes later with his aching cock, to the way his chest heaved as Dean worked him closer and closer to climax, moving harder and faster with every encouraging shout, to how Cas’ lips parted with a soft cry of pleasure as he came, Dean stroking him to completion in time with his own thrusts.
“I missed you already,” Cas mumbled into his shoulder blade, brushing his cheek over Dean’s wet skin.
It took a few tries for Dean to get words out of his desert-dry mouth, but it was easier to pretend he was answering his little brother, not their boss.
“That’s good news for us, I suppose. I’ll pass our success on to the head of covert operations. Nice to know the covers we create are so solid we can fool even the big bad Novak’s.”
Dean noticed over Jody’s shoulder that Gabriel wasn’t amongst his brothers. Neither was the strange one who had visited Dean at the hospital, Zachariah.
The onions were starting to caramelize in the saucepan on the stove, but Dean was far too invested in tasting the skin on the back of Cas’ neck. He let his fingers ruck up the t-shirt, traced ab muscles, swept over Cas’ belly button, teased the strip of skin above the waistband of his own pilfered jeans.
Dean still hadn’t put the pieces together when Sam came slamming through the door; Chuck, Dean’s second-in-command, was hot on his heels. Cas flinched back from them as they barged in and Dean automatically moved to shield his love before he could help himself.
Cas came clattering down the stairs and shot another long look at Dean, before he turned to the man.
when we got the news about you! Luckily, most of your injuries are from bouncing around on your butt on your own stairs, not the actual blast.”
“I know you two have a lot to work through,” Sam’s voice was strained with tension. “But can we focus?”
Cas started to come to him, but Michael held up a hand and stopped his brother without looking at it.
I was literally working on this chapter when I broke the USB it was saved to, a few months back, lost it and a lot of other writing and haven't been able to go back to it mentally since.
Dean looks around from where he’s laying, in the bed of a stark, white hospital room. Sam is slumped in a chair that he’s too tall for, looking uncomfortable even in his sleep. Outside, the sky is the purple-orange of dusk.
Sam dissolved in tears again, and Dean wrapped his arms around him once more, beyond grateful that his brother wasn’t lashing out at him, at least not yet.
A surprisingly young man with blonde hair and green eyes stood a little in front of them all; he was easily the youngest of the whole group, younger even than Cas. Michael Novak surveyed them all with an air of hostility, and Jody came to her feet to put herself in front of Dean and Sam, her hand on her gun.
He cooked a meal all by himself that night of steak, eggs, and chips, adding a single broccoli floret on top. He was pretty sure Sam had some sort of spidey-sense directly linked to whether Dean was consuming vegetables, and he’d been nagged enough by his brother the past few months about his eating habits.
Thanks for all your support and thanks as ever to my amazing betas who've worked so hard to help me with this fic!
“Wow, yeah, OK.” Dean refuses to think of Meg, doesn’t let himself remember watching her body slump over the table in the warehouse just a few hours ago; refuses to think of how he'd rip out the throat of anyone who ever posed any threat to Sammy. “Your brothers? Your family? Your oh-so-special family of arms traders and drug dealers? The family you go out and commit murder for? You shouldn’t be in this room. We shouldn’t be negotiating over you. You should be locked in a cell to rot! You’re a criminal!”
Dean didn’t say anything to anyone, just strode into Henriksen’s office, flopped down in a chair in front of his desk and handed the dossier over.
Dean flung himself out of the car and pelted straight to his brother, who was being restrained by Henriksen and about three officers. Sammy was fighting them with all he had, howling wordlessly at Gabriel Novak, who was white-faced as he knelt between two covered bodies lying the pavement.
“For fuck’s sake,” Dean grumbled, using the toilet before he splashed cold water on his face at the sink, not caring that it changed the shower temperature on Cas.
He’d taken Cas home after he’d met him in the bar, thinking his cover was safe and secure and what was one night, anyway? Dean had tried to convince himself that he wasn’t already hooked on Cas’ eyes, the timbre of his voice, the way he smiled. They’d fallen into Dean’s bed and he’d realised he wasn’t fooling himself at all.
“Dean… His name is Castiel Novak, and he’s one of the most imperative members of the Novak family; allegedly their hitman and a very dangerous individual.”
“No. I’m not going back to him, or our brothers, or that life, or any of it. I told him. I warned him. I’m choosing you. I just want you,” Cas said it with so much conviction that it brought tears to Dean’s eyes.
“We will,” Dean insisted, as they moved through the main room and down a cleared corridor. He was being reminded so forcibly of when he’d recovered Cas in the Masters’ warehouse all those months ago, and it wasn’t a happy memory.
“Yours does too,” Dean felt almost smugly satisfied, as he watched the interchanging bands of black and rose gold metal on Cas’ finger glint in the glare of the streetlights. “If you like, I can actually propose properly with it.”
“I think it’s cos of me, Sammy,” Dean whispered back in defeat. “They took them and because they identified you through me. It’s my fault.”
Jody just shrugged, “The thing is, I don’t think we’ve got anything we can actually stick to Castiel. All we have on him is hearsay and rumour, nothing concrete. We can’t arrest a man based on his reputation. That means we can’t hold him much longer. If he’s going to be released regardless, we might as well cut ourselves the best deal possible with his family.”
By way of answering, Cas surged up and kissed him, using his momentum to wrap his legs around Dean’s waist and pull him down hard on top of him.
Dean was ten minutes late to HQ for the briefing and didn’t care one bit. Some things were worth being torn a new one by Henriksen, and Cas’ mouth was definitely one of them.
Chuck was already blabbering away, oblivious, leaning around Dean to assure Cas that he was safe now and that the medics were on their way. Dean ignored Chuck entirely, let his eyes find Sam’s, let his brother see the horror that he was feeling even though he didn’t expect Sam to understand why.
“I’m starving, angel, been thinking about you all day,” Dean gritted back, manhandling Cas all the way past the dining table and down onto the living room couch. Cas laughed as fell he back onto the brown leather, then wriggled out of his jeans and underwear in one go, rucking them down to his ankles as he reached up to pull Dean down on top of him.
“You can point all the fingers you like once Jessica and Mary are secured and safe,” Henriksen carried on. “Let’s focus!”
“I don’t take orders from Michael and I sure as hell don’t need his permission to come and go from my own place of work,” Dean carried on, fixing his eyes on Michael through the glass wall of the room as he spoke.
When Dean next woke, it was properly morning, and sunlight was filtering into the room. Cas was gone from the bed, but Dean could hear the shower running. The palpable mood of finality was hanging in the air.
Dean was just flipping through TV channels on the couch with another glass of whiskey, far more than just a shot’s worth, when Cas phoned.
The door pin reset itself daily, communicated by password protected text messages sent to both Dean and Cas’ phones. So, Cas walking right in is not so much of a surprise; what stuns Dean is that he would want to.
Sam watched them go, looking concerned, and like with Jody, Dean just waved a hand at the waiting folder.
“That’s perfectly understandable,” Michael agreed, from where he and his brothers were waiting, before his eyes went to Dean. “I’d like to request that Dean also remains with the support vehicles.”
Jody’s lips pressed into a thin line as she observed him from his doorway, when he dumped his jacket on his desk. Her eyes narrowed in on his hand. She didn’t speak.
A week later, Dean’s home and sulking on the couch in his living room, beer in hand as he scowls at the TV and tries not to think about the scorch marks on his driveway.
Nothing would ever wipe the resulting memory away; Cas had been so beautiful, the way he’d writhed in Dean’s arms. His spiky hair, which had grown longer since then, had stood out ink-black against the white pillow. His pale skin had gone pink and flush with pleasure as his cries of delight had filled Dean’s ears. When he came, his hands had clenched on Dean’s shoulders, fingernails marking crescents into his skin, his face the picture of pleasure as Dean had stroked him in time with his own helpless thrusts.
“Please don’t let go?” Cas’ whisper lingered in the warm, thick air around him, and Dean kissed the back of his neck as he dragged the sheets up around them. “Don’t let me go… Don’t let go, please…”
“He’s not hurt? He’s alright? They… when they… when they came to the house, they were looking for him, they haven’t stopped asking about him!” Even as she spoke, she pitched herself forward onto his chest, relief making her body slump against his.
He headed over to the armoury van and pulled on his SWAT gear. Cas joined him after a few seconds, and Dean quietly helped him and Raphael dress in the same gear. Sammy tried to help but kept fumbling the buckles with how badly his hands were shaking.
Dean felt cold once his brother pulled away from him and slid from the room. He turned his eyes back to Cas, who was still staring down at the table he was seated at. It hurt afresh to look at him, but Dean was determined not to let himself pay any attention to Henriksen, who was ordering Charlie to make contact with the Novak’s while he and Jody started trying to figure out what to demand in return for their hitman.
“Why we’ve both been lying through our teeth, trying to protect each other. I understand. You’re angry and hurting. I’m angry and hurting.”
Cas looked up at him with those fucking eyes, with so much regret and sadness and joy all at once, and Dean had to kiss him. Cas sighed into it, chased for more when Dean started to pull back, the folder in Dean’s hands crushed between them. Dean grew dizzy with endorphins as their lips brushed and their tongues slid together and he used his thighs to back Cas against the wall.
The house was dark and quiet when he parked in the driveway, and he arched his back when he got out of the car, let the tension lift from his shoulders.
“For the record,” he told Cas, “I didn’t even know you existed until today. We tend to keep our personal lives as private as possible in this gig, to avoid spouses or children being targets for revenge; even Dean and I go to extreme lengths to keep each other completely in the dark. If it hurts you any less, Dean’s never met my wife. And he’s never met our baby either. Never even seen pictures, couldn’t pick them out of a crowd, wouldn’t know them if they walked through the door right now. It’s just safer.”
“Your family,” Deans eventually said, every word enunciated slowly after being carefully chosen, a rare feat for him, “Are in the process of arranging a deal with us to let you go free. You’re very valuable to them, it seems. I’m told your brother Michael, the boss of your little band of merry mob men, referred to you as being ‘of the utmost necessity’. Remind me what it is you do that makes you so vital to your family? Because I could have sworn YOU WERE A FUCKING ENGLISH TEACHER!”
“Too many, and they’ve all decided to come crawling out of the woodwork at once,” he mutters, and God, yeah, he looks wrecked, with black rings around his tired eyes, his skin an unhealthy grey.
Dean takes Chuck with him to watch the comings and goings from the nondescript little apartment in a rough part of town, allegedly the location of a sex-trafficking gang. They eat burgers in the safety of the Impala and don’t talk about anything to do with their personal lives as they take turns training binoculars on the door and windows.
Sam’s team were the most upset, and his second-in-command, Amelia, cried even as she paced about, too agitated to sit down. The others were all white-faced and shaking from their sobs, slumped in their seats.
“No. I’ve barely even seen any of them.” Jessica was still trembling against Dean’s shoulder and he rubbed at her back.
“I’m here to tell you I wish to God we’d delayed the sting by a day. I wish to God you were still in that room getting the shit kicked out of you. I wish we hadn’t saved you. You don’t deserve it. I think its bullshit that we’re releasing you back to your family. If I ever see you again it will be too soon!”
“Winchester!” Henriksen barked at him, but Michael’s eyes were already cold. In Dean’s arms, Sam was confused.
Ahead of them Henriksen nodded to Dean once and then gave the signal, dropping his fist from where he sheltered behind a crate. With that, all hell broke loose. Shots were fired before those at the table even knew what happened; Dean shot Meg in the back of the head, tamped down on his own satisfaction at watching her body crumple from her chair, then turned his gun after a guy who was already up and sprinting towards the far end of the warehouse.
Dean slowly flipped the folder shut and lowered it down on the floor, then opened the box he’d tucked into his pocket.
Sam leaps to his feet at the mention of Jess and their baby, but Zachariah is already out the door with a backwards wave and an obnoxious ‘Ciao!’ hollered over his shoulder.
“I didn’t do anything!” Sam wailed, as Charlie and Jody, the other two squad leaders on the Masters sting, exchanged glances and hid their smirks behind their coffee mugs.
“You don’t know who I am, do you?” Cas breathed, and yeah, no, Dean really fucking didn’t apparently.
“I’m taking my brother home,” Dean told him without preamble. “He needs a proper sleep, a shower, some food. Call me the second you hear anything?”
“Look, that’s enough,” Henriksen stepped between the two with his hands raised, while Dean gaped at Cas, his heart lodged in the back of his mouth.
Nearby, Henriksen was filling Cas in on what had transpired with the Novak’s confrontation with Crowley. Raphael had already disappeared.
“You’re taking Sam somewhere? Michael would like it known that it would be his preference for you both to remain here.”
“Have you been sleeping?” Dean asks, despite himself, his aching heart not able to cope with the thought of the love of his life suffering.
Dean had managed to ignore it last night, when they were both too consumed by their need that nothing else had mattered, but he couldn’t ignore it now. When he slid into the bathroom, Cas wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“You get this dealt with and you get Jessica and the baby back THIS INSTANT, NOVAK!” She roared, one hand on the wheel, the other clutching her phone to her ear, as she floored the accelerator all the way back to the office. No one dared to try and stop her.
me. Our covers won’t hold; covers never do. It’s amazing that they have lasted this long. And once they break, I don’t know if I can protect you.”
It feels so natural, so normal. Dean lets himself stroke a hand down Cas’ jaw, thumb sweeping down his neck, before he rests his temple against his hair and watches the shadows lengthen and turn to night on the opposite wall.
Charlie and Jody had made the first break inside with their teams and were scouting ahead, securing the first half of the warehouse before the rest of the FBI rolled in.
“Not properly. Not since… not without you. It doesn’t feel right, I can never relax enough. I've been worrying about you...”
“Want you. Always want you. Want this, and I never want it to stop. I need you, Dean!” Cas sat up and kissed him again, and Dean’s heart physically ached.
Cas had lied in so many circles, so many different directions, so many different ways, that he probably didn’t know what the truth was anymore; he was probably so used to it he could do it in his sleep.
Cas frowned a little. “I don’t keep much of that stuff here; my weapons are where you’ll never find them. And since I know your people have already gone through the house with a fine-toothed comb, I doubt anything else is in any danger of being discovered.”
baby, stop playing around and just fucking give it to me! I need it, need it as hard and fast and rough as you can. I
, Dean? How did you know they had me? Have you been keeping tabs on me all this time?” The voice, Cas’ voice, all gravel and low; Cas’s confused eyes; Cas’s body bruised and bleeding.
All the deep breaths in the world couldn’t steel him for this, so Dean gave up trying to breathe and just walked into the room.
So at midday, their four 8-man teams would converge on the warehouse. The Winchester brothers would lead their two teams inside, with Charlie’s and Jody’s people covering the outer perimeter of the building in case any escaped or reinforcements showed up.
Dean’s alarm blared him awake at 5am the next morning, the tune of ‘Thunderstruck’ jolting through his senses. He turned it off, jabbing blindly at his phone screen before he reached out to find Cas’ bare back. He smoothed his palm in broad strokes down the warm skin as an apology, to try and soothe Cas back to sleep as his angel shifted and stirred. Once his breathing was slow and even again, Dean kissed his shoulder and forced himself out of their warm bed.
“Oh, Dean...” Charlie pressed her fingers to his arm, and he ignored the long, worried glance she exchanged with Jody.
“The Masters' would have taken him as leverage,” Charlie agreed with her, shooting a sad look at Dean that he pretended not to notice. “The same thing you’re about to suggest we do?”
“Just saying… I don’t think the sort of life that you’ve lived is one that you can just choose to walk away from.”
Dean followed straight after Henriksen through the empty doorway into the warehouse, keeping enough of a gap between himself and his boss to ensure quiet. The small entryway held only a mishmash of chairs and a sad looking snake plant, slumped in a pot. The short corridor beyond, if their plans of the building were accurate, should open immediately right into the warehouse. Henriksen was on one knee at the corner, and he shot a quick look back at Dean to check on him before he slunk around it.
“I imagine he would want that, yes,” was all Cas said, before he was turning away. Then he was in front of Dean, and his eyes said everything.
“Oh, this is Gabriel’s way of saying he hopes you feel better soon. You’re not allowed to be snarky about it; he and Uriel saved your life.”
With Cas taken care of, Dean focused his attention on sinking all his weight into each thrust. Cas felt like heaven, so warm around him, and he bit at Dean’s ear as he started to lose his rhythm.
Groaning again, Cas rocked back against him, hips rolling as if on autopilot. Then he abandoned his wooden spoon and turned in Dean’s arms to kiss him fiercely, coaxing Dean’s mouth open with his tongue.
“It really is for the best if you remain here with me,” Cas insisted, tone low and slow, like he was trying to convince a child. It only enraged Dean more.
Dean didn’t know what to say, what to do, what to feel, so he just pressed his face down against his brother’s hair and closed his eyes, to better will the whole world away.
Henriksen let him go with an awkward pat, then promptly snatched up a pot plant from his desk and threw it at the wall with a howl of “FUCK! THOSE FUCKING, LYING PIECES OF SHIT! BASTARD ASSHOLES!”
“Fuck you, Novak scumbags!” one man spat in Cas’ face as he was dragged past, but Cas ignored him completely. His swearing cut off with a muffled grunt when the butt of Jo’s gun slammed into his belly as she passed.
Mary grizzled a little once they left the cell, so Dean propped her on his shoulder so she could see her mother just behind her.
Dean barrelled them all aside to get to Sammy, who screamed for him as soon as he spotted him, his tone nothing but hysteria and grief. Henriksen practically threw Sam at him and Dean dropped to his knees cradling his brother and held him as tightly as he could, clamping his arms around his thrashing body. The scream that shook through Sam didn’t subside for a second, and Dean clutched at his scalp, rubbed at his stupid long hair, mumbled anything he could think of to try and help, to try and ease the pain.
“So, you’re telling me you had no clue until we lifted you from that room that the guy you’ve been in a relationship with for three years is FBI?”
“Dean, what the fuck is going on? Talk to me!” Henriksen’s voice was low, could have even been called gentle if it hadn’t been laced with his typical do-not-bullshit-me-Winchester tone.
He also manages to have fun shaking the tail that’s been on him since the night Cas left – almost definitely the Novak’s, using different cars to try and be inconspicuous. Dean’s daily life takes him to very few places, so he's not exactly hard to track down.
“I just want them back! I just need my baby back… and Jessica, God… if anything happens…” Sam started to shake all over, and reached up to clutch at Dean, who rubbed at his back with both hands.
Sam stared up at him, perplexed by his reaction, and as Dean looked down into his eyes, he felt his heart snap.
“You are and will always be the love of my life. I don’t regret a single second of last night. But you must already know it can’t possibly happen again, Dean. That was goodbye. I love you. I love you too much to keep you dangling in hope that we can sort things out. We can’t. The reality of who we are when we step out the front door will never go away. And if we can never escape it, if there will always be people coming for us, hunting us, how can we really have a future together?”
Sometimes he went to work. Sometimes he didn’t. Sometimes he went to bed at 6 p.m. and woke up an hour later feeling refreshed. Sometimes he woke 24 hours later, still exhausted.
“We’re nearly there, Sammy. Nearly time,” Dean injected as much bravado and cheer as he could into his voice, and Sam nodded, his face wan.
Henriksen’s response isn’t to yell, but to instead hand him an actual, honest-to-God good assignment, and Dean throws himself into the stakeout with gusto.
All three of the others left the room then, by silent agreement, Jody towing Henriksen by the wrist, Charlie pushing on his shoulder blades, as their boss continued to swear and stamp and rage.
Dean found him in their office, in the middle of another round of frustrated tears. He was patting helplessly at Sam’s shaking shoulders when Cas appeared in the doorway.
“I won’t. I won’t, baby,” Dean murmured, and Cas twisted a little in his arms to let their mouths meet again.
When he opens his eyes again, someone is kneeling over him, and he sees a pair of anxious gold eyes that seem familiar. As he gazes up at them, he realises a disembodied voice is yelling.
“Yeah, ‘cos it’s your fucking fault!” Dean howled, and it was Sam’s turn to grip his shoulders to try to comfort him.
Days seemed to begin and end in the blink of an eye, whereas individual hours seemed stretched out endlessly until somehow entire weeks had gone by without Dean realising. He could never seem to distinguish one minute from the next, let alone figure out what month it was.
Dean returns it verbatim and takes a long pull of his beer to prepare himself for whatever the fuck is about to happen next.
Because Cas, Dean’s loving, sweet, perfect, English-teacher boyfriend, thought he was a mechanic. He thought the false bottom in the boot of the Impala was for tools and spare parts, not guns and SWAT gear. He thought the week Dean had spent lain up in hospital last month had been an extended visit to his family back in Kansas.
“I know you do. But you won’t for much longer. Wait for me to leave,” Cas, when he looked back from the doorway, only had eyes for the folder.
They were standing together on the covert side of a two-way mirror, watching Cas who was sitting in the interrogation room beyond the glass. Cas’ wounds had turned out to be mostly superficial – the Masters family hadn’t had time to get around to anything more colourful than punches – and a medic had taped up the abrasions on his face. He still looked beautiful and Dean was fighting the instinct to rush into the room to touch him, to offer comfort, to assure both Cas and himself that his angel was OK.
Their coverts team had been and gone, had combed through the house looking for bugs or any sort of sign that Cas had been gathering intel or information on Dean, as well as searching for any of his weapons or tools, any proof that he’d actually committed murders. They found nothing, and Bela, the team leader, gave Dean’s hand a long squeeze before she left, which he couldn’t rouse himself to even acknowledge.
Cas didn’t flinch when Dean snapped and threw the chair at the wall, his aggression insurmountable and not feeling the slightest bit better when two of the chair-legs broke on impact. He just fixed Dean with a strange, guarded look and said, “Same as how I thought you were a mechanic?”
The rest of his desperate pleas to calm his brother were cut short by a troop of men striding through the doors, led by Charlie. Henriksen moved to meet them with a hand extended. It took Dean a moment to realise Cas was amongst them, his heart skipping a few beats as he drank in the sight of him, pale and scruffy-haired, red-eyed. It took his brain a little bit to click into gear and realise that this must be the Novak family.
It was jarring, getting back out into the fresh night air, and both Mary and Jessica were still blinking in the bright flashing lights from the cruisers parked outside when Sam came sprinting to them. He took Jessica from Raphael and collapsed to his knees with her cradled in his lap, sobbing in relief into her hair.
Henriksen had pretty much trashed the entirety of his own office by the time Sam ran in, yelling for him to stop.
But Cas was firm. “Michael I’m not coming with you to the drop. I’m going with Dean. Whatever he does, wherever he goes, I’m going to be with him.”
From the back of his mob of brothers, Cas shifted his weight from one foot to the other. His eyes, tense and unhappy, were trained on the back of Michael’s head, but he didn’t refute what his brother was saying. It only made Dean angrier, and he felt his face twist in rage, his lip curling as he snarled at Michael.
“Winchester!” Henriksen barked, so Dean finally decided to go easy on him and settled back to listen.
“You’re not hungry, then?” Cas asked, when they eventually broke apart for air, only for Dean to immediately start trying to get Cas out of his shirt.
“I do what I have to, for the sake of my family. Are you going to try and pretend that you’ve never killed, in your line of work, to protect people, to keep your brother safe? It's the same thing.”
“They-” Dean started to jab a finger in Michael’s direction, but Cas grabbed his hand and lowered it back to rest on the tabletop.
The ring was rose gold surrounded by black titanium. When Dean slid it onto his finger it was the perfect fit.
“What can I say, I like it dirty,” Dean gathers himself and sits up, shoots a nod to the guy still in the doorway. “Who’s Happy?”
Sam writhed about anyway, fingers scrabbling at Dean’s shoulder as he wailed in anguish. He didn’t calm down until an ambulance officer stuck him in the neck with a sedative. It was then and only then that Dean relaxed his grip and lowered his brother gently to slump on the ground, his head resting on Dean’s lap.
Gabriel didn’t reply, just wiped at his wet face. He was still kneeling there when Henriksen helped Dean get Sam into the back of the ambulance, which was peeling away before they’d even properly got the doors shut.
“Well someone needs to get in there and get some answers about what he has on Winchester,” Henriksen turned towards Dean, but thankfully his eyes slid past him to Sam.
most because that would affect Castiel most. This was another hit at Cas, through you. This time, a vulnerable woman and child, instead of a car. So, you
Jody’s voice crackled over the comm line, reporting that most of the building was clear, that the two teams were easily incapacitating Crowley’s men, and that Dean could move in with his team of Cas, Raphael, Jo and Kevin.
“An old friend,” is the clear lie in response, before Cas smiles tightly at Dean and turns back towards the kitchen.
At some point, Henriksen laid the folder carefully back down on his desk, got to his feet and paced around the room for a few minutes, agitated and angry. Then he crossed back over to Dean and wordlessly laid a firm hand on his shoulder, squeezing the muscle and bone through his shirt in some attempt to offer comfort.
Cas': https://www.michaelhill.co.nz/ring-in-black-titanium-10ct-rose-gold-15413192.html?cgid=jewellery-mens-rings
“Who says the FBI didn’t know! Who says I didn’t! It’s hardly first-date-worthy conversation material! You spent a few hours with me and somehow knew everything about my work?! Impossible!”
“Let me take point,” Cas said, as they moved out of their crouching positions. “It’s safer for you.”
“No, angel,” Dean mumbled, his head still foggy with sleep, but conscious enough to manage reaching out to wind an arm around Cas again.
“You’re a little too excited about this, as per usual,” Sam muttered to Dean later, once they were in the armoury and pulling on their SWAT gear.
Therefore, the bomb that goes off under his car one Sunday morning as Dean’s somewhere on the front path between the house and the mailbox is a pretty big fucking surprise.
Now, the four of them were clustered in the observation room with Dean. Sam was a looming giant at his back, Charlie and Jody were shooting him worried looks from their seats at the table, and Henriksen simply stood with his hands on his hips as he waited for the answers Dean didn’t know how to give.
Cas nodded his agreement and smiled gently when Dean brushed back a bit of his hair from his eyes. Then he caught Dean’s hand and examined the ring.
Cas wasn’t alone either; a guy lingered at his shoulder, who assessed Dean with eyes that looked almost gold in the gloom of the dark room. Cas flicked a lamp on and said “Dean,” in that chiding way that Dean had heard a million time before, which meant he was being admonished for being petulant and lying in the dark.
“Tell me about Dean Winchester?” Sam was a professional, didn’t let his familiarity with own brother, and his own surname, slide into his tone. “Assuming that name has any meaning to you?”
He still couldn’t find the words to explain himself, even now that he was out of his gear, back in his normal clothes and had been given some time and space by the rest of the team to get his brain back online.
“There was a bomb under the Impala, Dean,” Sam tells him, after he’s pressed the button to summon a nurse now that Dean is awake. “The whole thing got blown sky high this morning, I’m really sorry.”
“Hey, baby,” Cas leans down and kisses Dean, once, twice. “I know I’m back from New York earlier than expected, but you could have cleaned up a little.”
Dean, it transpired, had been on the Novak’s watch list as a suspected secret agent for the FBI. Cas’ instructions had been to infiltrate Dean’s life, earn his trust, observe his activities, and eliminate him if Dean was discovered to be in possession of any intel on the Novak family. How Cas had been allowed to turn that ‘observation’ into a three-year-long relationship was beyond Dean.
Not five minutes passed before Cas was calling back, though Dean had finished two more glasses of whiskey by then.
“What does he want in exchange?” Henriksen demanded, pacing about with his hands on his hips. Jody sat down on Sam’s other side and Charlie lingered behind them, her face fraught with worry.
“Gabriel identified cars that we know belong to Crowley’s people fleeing the scene,” a handsome dark-skinned Novak spoke up from the back of the group.
“I know. I know, Sammy. I’m going to get them; I swear to God.” Dean shot a glance at Henriksen, whose mouth was turned down. Promises like what Dean was making were the first they were taught not to do. Dean didn’t care.
Dean’s little brother winced in sympathy, a look that quickly turned into an eyeroll when Dean simply beamed at him, completely unperturbed, and already eating a doughnut from the plate in the centre of the table.
“Enjoy yourself down there,” Dean grinned, ignoring the muttered swear words in response as he took stock of the little room. There was only one other door, which he approached with his gun drawn; it wasn't ajar and he nudged it open easily.
“I remember you being too late to save me.” She choked out the words, her tone shifting from rage to despair. She lifted his head again, and Dean felt blood matting in his hair. “Too late to stop Luther.”
Cas’s stolen body lurched forward suddenly out of the inky black. Only this time, on the Thing’s own turf, its pilfered vessel seemed to better contain its viscous, putrid true form. Cas’s skin no longer hung loose off of his bones, his hands weren’t dappled with painful, oozing blisters, oil no longer seeped from every pore.
In that moment, those simple words pulled out a carefully placed stone in the wall Dean had spent decades building up around his heart, and suddenly the entire structure came crashing down around him. Decades of trained self-loathing, of repression and guilt, unraveled with the simple comfort of a soft brush of fingers against his cheek and the whispered sincerity of love.
But something else rose up inside of him. A surety as clear as anything he’d ever known, a truth Cas had given him the courage to recognize.
“For a hunter, you’re an oblivious sonuva bitch. I’d tell ya to look in a mirror, but I think you shattered all the glass within a mile of here,” He barked a laugh. Ellen wasn’t gonna be too happy about that. “Look around, son.”
Dean struggled to come up with a rebuttal, with any sort of bitter retort he could snap out as a defense, no matter how hollow. But he came up empty. For weeks, he could feel the weighted blanket of his guilt settling around him, muffling the outside world and trapping him with his thoughts. It coursed beneath every one of his actions, his consciousness constantly tapping into that dark vein of blame and self-loathing and hatred that wove around his bones.
Dean looked up at the broken rip on the horizon and took one last, calming breath of Heaven’s eternal summertime air. “Thank you.”
“Be glad you couldn’t see that,” Dean said numbly. He was still struggling to process the atrocity he’d just witnessed. He wasn’t sure if he’d ever be able to. He’d seen a lot of messed up shit as a hunter, but that …
He’d always felt the presence of the vial as it hung just over his heart ever since Cas had trusted him with it. A backup plan, Cas had said, when he was weakening and running out of grace.
The remaining five surged forward. Dean ducked back and spun under Sam’s arm just as his brother swung his machete forward – a move they’d practiced and perfected over years of hunting together. By this point, they barely needed to speak or signal; they moved like clockwork.
“Here,” Dean said, pulling the vial of Cas’s grace out from beneath the collar of his shirt. “You should probably take this back.”
Sam whirled around, throwing his cast iron pan up like a sword and pointed it just inches from Dean’s face.
“Just mom?” The question rolled out of his mouth just a touch too fast to be casual. Dean gathered himself, hiding his trepidation with another swig of beer.
It was vague. It felt so distant, the memory silhouetted at the wavering surface leagues above the deep water he was sinking through.
The thing seemed to delight in Dean’s fear. It tried to smile, pulling Cas’s lips back into an inhuman sneer stretched far too wide to be remotely human. Its teeth were yellowed and fuzzed with lichen. It leaned forward and whispered in a voice it had stolen from Cas. “I know … your … secret,” the words seemed to drip from every open sore, every leaking orifice in its skin.
” the word ripped from Dean’s chest in a voice he barely recognized as his own. Dean clawed at Sam’s hands and twisted around like a feral animal wrestling to escape a trap. Dean wasn’t just unhinged, he was unraveling at the seams and he could feel every carefully placed stitch pulling loose.
Jenny smiled, the first genuine smile he’d ever seen from her. “It’s okay,” she said, sliding her arm up out of Dean’s grip so she could grasp his hand. She squeezed it gently. “You’re saving me now.”
Dean chewed the inside of his lip in thought. They hadn’t planned on staying another night – the hunt was supposed to be simple, and long over by now, with them grabbing some late-night pie and hitting the road back to Kansas. But, as always, this simple hunt had revealed itself to be some much Bigger Bad than they’d bargained for. He should’ve known.
The next few days (weeks?) slipped by much the same way. He didn’t have any idea how much time had passed – every day felt the same: empty, lonely, devoid of meaning or memory. He finally had the freedom to do whatever he wanted, to be whatever he wanted, but he was trapped. Trapped in this hell loop deep underground, his mind going over all the ways he’d fucked up.
“Happy trails, Hans,” Dean quipped. He flung his wings up around Cas, the sharp feathers slicing through some of the Empty’s vines. It shrieked in fury, and just as it shot its thousands of lethal spikes forward, Dean smacked his bloodied hand against the angel banishing sigil he’d carved into his own chest.
“Dark, like yours. But more so,” Cas said, his voice distant and edged with a kind of bittersweet mourning. “In Heaven’s light, they shimmered with colors you cannot perceive.” He reached up and ran the pads of his fingers lightly down the inside of Dean’s forearm, where his angel blade would manifest. “They looked a lot like your blade, actually. Almost exactly.”
As he wracked his brain for an answer, for a memory that didn’t exist, a voice from right behind him cut through his thoughts.
It was no use. He couldn’t quell the hope that rose and broke over him like a wave. His wings flared reflexively, betraying the privacy of his thoughts, as his doubt ebbed into resolve. “I’m gonna get him out,” he whispered.
Silence fell over the Impala. Sam had long since turned off the stereo, and the only sound around them was the engine’s ever-familiar rumble as they sped down the darkened highway. It was a long moment before either of them spoke again.
And so he had fallen to his knees, stuck out his arm and let Jenny bleed him to the brink of unconsciousness.
burning light – came rushing back in. The Empty snapped back, jolting out of its rest as something came crashing into its domain. Something different than all the rest who lie here.
“No, get up,” Dean said, swatting Cas’s shoulder. “I am not sleeping through breakfast, I haven’t had eggs ‘n’ bacon in— well. I don’t know how long.” A few days, tops. Right?
“I meant it, uh,” Dean was caught up in the intensity of Cas’s eyes, the distractingly deep blue that made it hard to piece together words especially when they were this close to each other. He tried to look somewhere else – his gaze flicked down to Cas’s lips – no, that wasn’t helping. He shut his eyes and took a breath, one that smelled of ozone and pine and the moment just before snowfall and
Dean didn’t slow down, despite the lack of a plan. He fully intended to keep running, and if he hit a wall without an exit, well
Dean huffed a laugh. “Can I now?” He teased. “How about the luxury of this?” He leaned in to kiss the tip of Cas’s nose. “And this?” Another kiss for his cheek. “Or—“
“Yes,” Cas’s answer came matter-of-factly, though Dean knew there was more emotion tied up in it than he was letting on. His grace had dwindled down to nearly nothing after months of the Empty feeding off of it, and Dean grappled with the guilt that maybe his angel-banishing escape trick had done more damage than he’d meant to.
He felt a hand fall tentatively on the crook of his neck, and he slowly looked up to see a bewildered and horrified Cas staring back at him.
Dean could feel the static radiating down into his fingertips, coaxing his grip tighter on the trigger. Every fiber of his being screamed for him to stop, to set down the gun, to save his brother’s life. But whatever had its tendrils entwined into Dean’s thoughts, whispering empty promises in his ear of peace and of an end to his grief, was stronger.
“Cas?” Sam said, eyes wide. He whipped back around to Dean, then glanced back at Cas, and when he turned toward Dean again he did so with narrowed eyes. “
The barn rose out of the earth at a slant, as though the only thing keeping it together was spite for the land it sat on, and hatred for those who left it to rot. The paint had chipped away and blackened with age. Dark mildew clung to the gaps between the planks of wood, smelling both sickly sweet and rancid at the same time, like meat starting to turn. The ground surrounding the barn was dry and cracked and gouged, and it was clear nothing had grown here in decades – and likely never would again.
But this morning, Dean’s muscles ached from a lack of movement. He blinked awake, and though there was no natural light in the bunker this far underground, it felt late. He reached over to grab his phone off the nightstand to check the time, when he heard Cas grumble from behind him.
Dean glanced over to Cas, still standing stock-still as the Empty approached him draped in its illusion of Jimmy. He hid behind one of the frozen bodies and shouted.
The barn was cold, and desolate, and dark. The shadows here were clouded with memories of violence and exploitation; the atrocities committed so powerful they became embossed in time itself. He could hear distant screams echoing through decades of stillness, could just barely catch the scent of fear, of steel, of coal dust and blood. He could feel a presence, the master of this rusted domain, snagging at the edges of his perception, testing the bait of his thoughts.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas’ stolen voice gurgled out of the Thing’s mouth, though its jagged and torn lips didn’t move. Its voice drifted through the cracks of the car, through the air vents and every crevice, making it sound like it was sitting right there in the backseat.
He swiped to unlock his phone and scrolled through the list of missed calls, all coming just a few minutes apart.
The next (final) chapter will hopefully be up soon. I already know how this ride ends. I'm excited to share it with you <3
“Wait a second,” Dean said, opening up the file they’d gotten from the scene. “How many kids were snatched in the other three cases we know about?”
Sam closed his eyes and took a deep breath to compose himself. “Alright,” he said, reaching up to push his hair out of his face. “Whatever it is only seems to hunt every few years, so they probably won’t be hitting another family anytime soon. So we’ve got to find their nest.”
They were getting closer to the barn. Dean could feel it. A sort of dark, displaced fury began to bubble up in his chest. It was an anger that didn’t quite feel like his own, but it was one he channeled into a pure hatred for the Empty. For tearing apart families and feasting on the corpse of despair. For mutilating love until only guilt remained.
The shout ripped from Dean, raw and desperate, pounding in his ears. The static rose to meet him, twining around his legs and burrowing its grainy thorns into his thoughts.
By the time they padded into the kitchen, with Cas still yawning and leaning on Dean to stay upright, it was well past one in the afternoon.
“I’m Dean,” he said, dropping into a crouch to get down on their level. “That’s my little brother, Sammy. We’re gonna get you out of here.”
Maybe it was her beating his head into the ground, or maybe it was her words, but a decade-old name reeled out of the fog that had become Dean’s thoughts.
,” Jenny yelled, waving to get their attention. The two brothers snapped their heads around in surprise, almost as though they’d forgotten she was even there. She straightened and rolled her eyes. “I’ll just ride in the trunk.”
