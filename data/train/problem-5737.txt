“STEVE!” She screamed, pouring everything she was feeling in that moment into that scream. All the anguish and sorrow and devastation that she felt for this child that was never to be.
Tony dropped a kiss on his temple before turning to Pietro, “What my darling husband is trying to say Pietro, is that we’d like to legally adopt you. You wouldn’t have to take one of our last names and we wouldn’t expect you to call either of us dad or anything. But we do want you to stay here for as long as you want and the kids already love you like a brother and”
“Well, we are Captain America and Iron Woman, pretty sure we can go wherever and whenever we want to, bud. But we’ll try and tell you next time, okay?” Steve had wrapped an arm around the boy and was leading him inside.
Steve was the first to speak up, “What do you ‘if something happens’ bud? Can you help us understand a little bit?”
Suddenly, there were tears forming in Tony’s eyes too, “But, I thought that you… a-and Barnes?”
Bruce was simultaneously running simulations on possible projects, “Yeah, why not. Maybe Tony has an idea that we missed.”
Nurses and doctors came through every hour, always finding the same thing. Nothing was changing, which was both a good thing and a bad thing, the doctors explained. If nothing was changing it meant that nothing was declining, but nothing was improving either, which was concerning considering Steve’s healing factor.
Peter was frozen to the wall. How did this man know his full name? He had been stupid to climb the walls, he could have used his powers to help them escape if the captors hadn’t known about them. Also, how did this man know about Peggy’s nightmares? Papa and daddy didn’t think he knew, he let them keep believing that. But there was no way anyone outside of their family knew about the nightmares. Peter spoke up,
“Sir?”
Steve was almost scared to ask, but knew he had to, “So, is that a yes?”
popped up. One second, they were wading through dozens of HYDRA goons and the next second there was guy with a metal arm. Which admittedly, was pretty cool, but Tony wanted to get to his son. Even tag teaming him, Steve and he weren’t getting anywhere. He sent Peter’s location to Rhodey, briefing him on the situation. Steve added on,
Tony watched as Steve approached DUM-E, his voice quieting considerably, “I can’t even count the times Peter and Peggy have asked me, ‘Where’s daddy?’. And I don’t want to. You know why? Because every time, every single
“Papa?”
Tony looked at the ceiling (damn it Steve!) with annoyance, “Okay fine you tattletale! You’re going to the nearest community college ASAP!”
It took him a second to even formulate the sentence, “It’s Peter and Peggy. They’ve been kidnapped.”
“That’s it,” he muttered to himself, “it’s the bed. Just can’t sleep there anymore.”
JARVIS cut the call.
Tony got to her first and scooped her into his arms. She didn’t thrash but didn’t cuddle into him like she usually did. Steve came up behind him, wrapping his arms around both his husband and his daughter.
The agent snorted before responding, “You don’t happen to wonder why your children were taken to the same base as Barnes and these two? Three of HYDRA’s most successful human experiments? I knew Steve could be dumb sometimes, but c’mon Tony, don’t tell me you never thought about that.”
Bruce ran a hand through his hair and down his face, “Not physically. I can’t speak for what this has done to his mind. I’m hoping that with enough rest, relaxation, and maybe some therapy he’ll be fine. I just don’t know though Tony. I just don’t know.”
When the bell rang, Peter practically flew out the door, his mouth running at a thousand miles a minute.
Steve remembered being sick as a kid back in the 40’s. It had been miserable, but there wasn’t a whole lot they could do about it. Even with modern medicine, there wasn’t a whole lot to be done for the stomach flu. Steve would have gladly taken on both Peggy and Peter’s sickness if he could have, but he knew that was impossible. Peter’s crying continued and all Steve could do was be there for him.
Tony gave both of the kids green beans, knowing that Peggy preferred the carrots. And then, Tony proceeded to eat his salad and turn down ice cream. During the movie (The Incredibles, because why not), his eyes just kind of glazed over. Peter was trying to get his attention to ask about the science side of the movie and all his husband responded with were ‘yeah’ and ‘sure, squirt.’
The adults received eager nods from all of the kids. Steve blew the whistle and they were all off like a shot. Pietro had Peter on his back and Wanda was making the other three fly. The younger four were all laughing their heads off.
He shuddered at the thought of the kidnapping, but thankfully no one noticed. That was one memory he hadn’t wanted to relive. Not knowing where your children were? Not knowing if the next time you saw them they were going to be alive or dead? Steve had no desire to relive those memories in any way, shape, or form.
JARVIS responded immediately, “I believe Sir has woken from a night terror, I believe it to be safe to touch him, although I advise proceeding with caution.”
And of course it was Tony. “Hey Capsicle! Where ya been?”
Bucky interrupted him, “I’m still sore I didn’t get to see you get married, Stevie. We always promised to be each other’s best man.” He said it all with a joking smile on his face.
Bucky shrugged, “Hell if I know, he’s your husband, not mine. If he were mine though, I’d start by talking to him? Letting him know you understand his fears? That they’re unwarranted and completely untrue?”
Tony walked in with more pancakes. He took one look between Peter and Steve, groaned once, and then started laughing right along with Steve. Peggy soon joined in and then Peter was on the verge of tears.
ring on my nightstand and you nowhere to be found!”
The stomach bug ended up lingering for the next three days, in which Peter and Peggy slept, cried, and threw up, in that order. By the end, Tony and Steve were exhausted.
Tony only started crying more, but this time in a different way. The tears and feelings from before were definitely still there, but there was something different there too. There were tears of happiness mixed in because of Steve’s words. Something Tony could never thank him enough for.
“What the hell is this, Toni? Huh? Because after last night, I thought we might be getting somewhere and then I come back this morning to
The sorry sons of bitches were about an hour out and the SHIELD vehicle joined them about half way there. Tony had called Natasha as soon as he knew anything. She had promised them back up and legal support. Only on the condition that Tony wouldn’t bring the suit. Grudgingly, he had agreed, but made Steve promise to bring the shield. That hadn’t taken much convincing.
. He married
They were getting ready for bed when Steve had finally had enough.
And then Steve started talking, “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Sam and Natasha had both tried questioning him, after they had found that he wasn’t going to attack anyone. They had gotten no response. Sam had gone first and gotten blank stares. Natasha took a turn, thinking that maybe if they tried a different language he might respond differently. She had gotten a different kind of stare, but no verbal or physical response.
I'm most likely going to be making another part of this series. There's other elements I want to add to this plot line, but if I include them in this fic, it's gonna be really long. I don't really want to make this fic that long. I'm thinking that this might have a few more chapters, maybe 4, and then it'll be done. Not sure though.
Steve had been wracking his brain for weeks, trying to figure out what he had done wrong. Usually when Tony went on his workshop binges, it was because he was upset at Steve. But this time? Steve had no
Toni's voice came out so quietly that she wasn't sure if Steve could hear her, “I didn’t think you’d want me anymore. I screwed everything up so badly, I figured that you’d moved on and that I should just stay away. If I came back, I’d probably just be a nuisance.” Keeping her tears at bay was taking some real effort, not looking at Steve was helping.
was the leader of this team?” Steve was trying not to laugh.
“Hail HYDRA.”
His thoughts were interrupted by Tony opening the doors himself, a bewildered look on his face. It didn’t stay there long. Steve had Tony wrapped in his arms, kissing the life out of him, in the next two seconds.
Tony just winked, “Guess you’ll just have to go to school to find out squirt. Why don’t you go find out?”
“Put a couple cases on next week’s grocery list J. Let Clint know the kids are sick and need the ginger ale.”
“Okay wow, longer than I thought, but anyhow. I’ve just been falling asleep in the shop, because if I sleep in bed I wake up with nightmares. Those got real old real fast, so I just decided the couch in the shop was comfy enough.” Tony ended his speech with a sigh, slumping back against Steve.
Peter looked thoughtful for another minute, “No, I guess not.”
Peter nodded, seeming very much happier with this than having the whole family laughing at him. He was content to let Tony carry him to the bathroom for a bath, while Steve went back to cutting Peggy’s pancakes. Or he would have, except that Peggy had apparently not wanted to be left out. She had dumped the whole plate, the pancakes
There were murmurs of assent from around the room, the team too dispirited to do much else. The room was silent for a while before Bruce spoke up,
Despite all the whining that Tony usually did about not using the communal floor, they all congregated in the penthouse living room. It was still littered with all of the toys and drawings Peter and Peggy had left.
Steve just sighed and turned his attention back to Summer Nights.
Steve was in no mood for bullshit, “To interrogate those people. They hurt our daughter.”
“As always sir.”
“Sir?”
They were down in the gym, and Steve was on his third punching bag, or was it his fourth? Either way, when they all came home, Tony went straight to the workshop, and Steve headed for the gym. He hadn’t said a word to anyone, just wrapping his hands and going to town on the punching bags. Tony was going to have to make more after all of this was over, because there weren’t very many left.
Vaguely he heard someone talking, “Steve? Hello? Earth to Stevie! Anyone home in there?”
“Tony?”
It was just a bad day all around. Waking up was hard. Getting out of bed was harder. Getting ready to start the day and face everyone was the hardest part yet. Steve knew the team would know something was up, usually he was the first one up, usually he went for a run before everyone else was even up. Not today though. Today was one of those days when everything felt like it was too much. But Steve also knew that just staying in bed all day would make it worse. It would mean that all of his thoughts and feelings were right there, including his memories. No, getting up was the better option.
JARVIS’s silence was response enough.
Tony looked around the room once, before stepping straight back into the elevator, needing to see Steve immediately.
Steve had both Tony and Peter wrapped in his arms in a heartbeat, “I’m right here buddy. Right here and I’m not going anywhere, neither is daddy.”
“Uncle Rhodey?” His voice sounded so hopeful that Rhodey wanted to cry.
The relief flooding through Bruce was almost palpable, “I know it’s a lot to ask and I know you guys want to spend some quality time as a family after everything we’ve been through, but I really want to work on getting Bucky better as soon as possible. If Steve could spare just even a few minutes?”
“Yeah, Petey, I do. Papa and me will be back just as soon as we can, huh? And then we’ll just have to make some more pancakes, yeah?”
“That would be because it hasn’t been used in - JARVIS, how long have I been sleeping in the shop?”
Steve made gentle shushing noises while he picked Tony up, being the captain of the football team had its perks. His mom was in the kitchen but quickly vacated the area when Steve moved towards the couch, having been through this routine many times before. Steve shot her a grateful look. Sarah Rogers was an absolute saint.
“Oh, thank god you’re all here! I thought you weren’t going to make it! Steve, we had a Pepper designed schedule! What happened?”
Peter’s dubious expression made both of them laugh again as they made their way to the common room. According to the boy, everyone had gathered there to chew the two out when they got home. Toni didn’t think that’s what they’d be doing after she and Steve dropped their news.
Tony looked up, “Nope. Sorry. No can do. That ass is mine, anyone else who wants it can fight me. And you should remind them, I have an armory of Iron Man suits to fight with.”
His face crumpled as he curled into Steve. The two simply sat on the bed and let the tide roll over both of them. One mourning the loss of a child and the other mourning his sister.
“Papa! Don’t leave! I’ll be good, I promise! Please don’t leave me, Papa! Please Papa! I’ll be good! Daddy, please! I’m a good girl! Please, daddy! Don’t leave me!”
Toni hissed when the contraction rolled through. It felt kind of like the Braxton-Hicks that had been coming more frequently but something told her this wasn’t one of those.
“Mommy! Please no! I be good! I promise! Please no more! Mommy!”
JARVIS was still waiting for a response.
“JARVIS! What’s with this? It wasn’t even that loud!”
Her reverie was broken by the timer going off.
As the doctor was leaving, Peter slipped through the door. Toni opened her arms and the boy practically ran to her.
Tony had stopped screaming and blinked at Steve. He seemed rather groggy and disoriented.
Tony practically whispered his next words, maybe hoping that Steve wouldn’t hear them, “Isn’t enough that I love you? That I need you?”
“Steve? Steve? Can you hear me? Steve? Please answer me?”
Toni’s OB/GYN told them the next day that Toni was around six weeks along. Certainly not out of the woods yet, but they’d get there soon. She showed them the ultrasound. Steve panicked a little because there wasn’t a heartbeat, but both Toni and the doctor assured him that it was normal not to have a heartbeat this early in the pregnancy. The doctor printed them a picture, they scheduled another appointment two weeks out, and they were out the door.
Tony was already walking into the armor, “J, last known whereabouts. Stat.”
Peter came forward, wrapping her in a hug, and sobbing into her shoulder, “Mom!”
Tony shook the thoughts out of his head, “Yeah Bruce, right here. Sorry, it’s been a long few days.”
“Can you tell me what this is about?”
As soon as Nat came out of the elevator, the TV was the last thing on Peter and Peggy’s minds. They were infatuated enough with their Aunty Nat, but Aunty Nat had also brought Uncle Bucky.  They were all over Nat and Bucky, asking why they didn’t come over more often and if they could go play in the gym with them. They went on and on and on with the questions, Natasha laughing at them all the while. Steve managed to duck out while they were preoccupied with Nat, shooting her a grateful look as the elevator doors slid closed.
“No. You stay quiet. I have something to say and this time, you’re gonna listen. Understand?”
“OH MY GOD WE ARE NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, YOU BASTARD? YOU ARE WEARING A FUCKING CONDOM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES, I AM NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN, OH MY GOD!”
He was in her personal space now and continued yelling, “I was there! I’ve been there for you this whole time! When you locked everyone out of the shop and then when you started running off to Stark Industries everyday, I was there. When you had nightmares? I was there! We’ve been together for years and now I get this? What the fuck did I ever do to you?”
She could practically hear the sorrow and concern in the AI’s voice, “As you wish, miss.”
“Let’s finish these bastards.” Steve finished his sentence.
It was surprising that Peter hadn’t woken up when he heard Peggy crying. The boy was an oddly light sleeper. Bruce thought that it might have to do with his spider powers, but no one knew for sure. Tony just carried Peter to his room. After tucking him into bed, he returned to the living room, wanting to help Steve with Peggy.
Tony was beginning to understand what Bruce was asking, “So you want Steve to come down to see if anything gets through, right?”
“Rhodes, you find Peter and get him to Bruce. Don’t wait on us, just get him out. Are we clear?”
Steve shook his head no.
Peggy woke fully with a start. At first, she didn’t know where she was. Maybe back in the cell? But then she smelled papa and realized that whatever she was laying on was warm and soft. She looked up and saw papa. He was smiling at her, trying to cuddle her closer with Peter in the other arm. She just cried harder.
Steve went back to reading, “Well then I guess you’ll never know.”
Tony’s chest rumbled with a laugh, “Yeah baby, you sleep just as long as you want.”
Her husband turned and let out a choked sob of a laugh, “I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. Running, that’s what you’re best at, huh? The only thing you know how to do, am I right?”
Sam thought Nat looked awful. He had seen her with serious sleep deprivation, but this was something different entirely. He knew that her past was something she’d rather forget, but he also couldn’t help but wonder if just being here was messing with her psyche. However, that being said, he also knew Tasha well enough not to ask. If one wanted to live, one did not ask Natasha Romanov about her feelings or her past.
“What are you doing?” Steve sounded genuinely confused.
Steve took one look at Peggy’s puppy eyes and agreed. It was hard to withstand those things, they were irresistible.
Despite the fact that Steve
Tony was in the same situation with Peggy. She was sobbing and it was breaking Tony’s heart.
Steve was already half way out the door on the way to elevators.
“Are you awake? Can we talk?”
Tony looked at Nat, Nat looked at Bruce and they all just knew. Steve would need everyone today. Which meant that no one was leaving. It meant that they weren’t leaving Steve alone at all today. Because SHIELD might have thought he was fine, but they all knew better.
They had left the suit in the room. Peter knew there had to be cameras, he couldn’t just start talking to the suit in the hopes that JARVIS would respond, he’d never get out that way. But there had to be a way to get a message to daddy through the suit, there just had to be. Daddy wouldn’t have given the bad men his suit if there wasn’t a way to get Peter home too. Peter just had to be smart enough to figure it out.
Do you even know how much the kids have grown in the last six weeks? No! Because you haven’t hardly seen them!”
They had been home a week when Steve popped the question. Thinking back on it, Toni should have suspected all along, but in her defense, she needed to upgrade Steve’s suit and get that facial recognition software done. It was only when she finished and went up to the penthouse that she realized something was up.
“What if we go to SHIELD instead?”
He made a mental note to tell JARVIS to make a note. Never leave his daughter alone with Natasha Romanov again. She’d tricked him! His own daughter, at three years old, had tricked him! Admittedly, he should have seen this coming, but still! His three year old was being turned into a spy right in front of his eyes!
Six hours later, and Toni was squeezing the life out of Steve’s hand and screaming her lungs out. Labor and delivery hurt like hell!
Steve was still trying his damnedest not to cry, but it wasn’t working very well. After being alone with the kids for almost six weeks straight, he couldn’t take it anymore. Before HYDRA had happened, it had been him and Tony against the world. Now it felt like his better half had been ripped away and was never coming back.
husband here, seems to think that I need to stay away from my shop until after this baby is born. I keep telling him that I’m staying away from chemicals and flame, but he still thinks I shouldn’t be working. I need a professional opinion.” Despite her ribbing at Steve, Toni was beaming at him.
“Are you sure you don’t want to watch a movie or something? Considering that somehow Clint always gets the movie he wants on movie night? Maybe we could watch something now to make up for Titanic?”
Steve had been right, whether Tony wanted to admit it or not. Preschool was good for Peggy. The nightmares were down to two nights a week at the max, and she was talking more and more. If anyone asked her about her past though, she bottled everything right back up. Everyone had learned to steer the conversation away from Peggy’s past when she was around. Life was finally beginning to settle down again, both of the kids were in school, Steve was back to working part time at SHIELD, and Tony was back to spending all day in the shop. Life was good, until one day it wasn’t.
The next three weeks were filled with Steve showing Toni everything he had found to put in the nursery. They didn’t actually order anything, Nat had demanded that she and Pepper get to throw them a baby shower. Toni didn’t doubt that all they’d have to buy was the furniture.
Tears were still streaming down Steve’s face, “I’m not leaving, Tony. Not now, not ever. Til death do us part, remember?”
That was startling, “I’m what now?”
“Is there any lasting damage, Bruce? I just need to know.”
Tony turned to Steve, wrapping his arms around his husband while resting his head between Steve’s shoulder blades, “How did we get so lucky?”
The Spider-Man nodded, awestruck as he sat in the chair next to the bed. Steve gently took James from Toni and eased him into Peter’s arms.
There wasn’t a response, just Tony snuggling closer into Steve, seeking out his warmth.
(See the end of the chapter for
As soon as the doors were closed Tony asked JARVIS, “J?”
“Peggy, please! Just come brush your teeth!” What had the world come to? Tony Stark was begging his six year old daughter, about ready to drop to his knees and plead.
“Don’t believe you.”
“Sirs, I regret to interrupt this time, but Director Fury has labeled the current situation as a Level 7. You are both needed at SHIELD headquarters immediately.”
“Steve, babe? As much as I appreciate this, can you explain why you’re not talking?”
Peggy just whined, not wanting to let go, but knowing that she had to. “Don’t want you or daddy to go, papa. Want you to stay here.”
Peggy squirmed out of his arms, “Okay daddy. You promise?”
Dr. Evans giggled while printing out their ultrasound photo, “Congratulations again! I’ll see you guys in four weeks!”
Steve huffed and then rolled his eyes when Toni stuck her tongue out at him. They both really hated being wrong.
Peggy woke up. Peggy woke up and she was warm and in a bed. Peggy woke up and didn’t know if she was actually home, or if this was another nightmare. It looked like home, but so had the dreams. It smelt like home, but so had the dreams. But daddy and papa had never been in the dreams and they were both here. She was in daddy and papa’s bed, snuggled between them. But how was she supposed to know if she was really home or not?
Rhodey held his hands up in surrender, “Just wanted to see if you needed any help man, I know you’re on the clock with this one.”
Steve sighed, “Tell him that’s fine JARVIS. Not like we could keep Peter away from bad habits forever.”
Another kiss was deposited on Tony’s lips, “And none of that is true either. I’ll keep telling you that for the rest of my life, if that’s what it takes.”
“I knew it was gonna catch up with him eventually.” Steve thought to himself as he approached the bench. “Tony?”
When they came back to the compound, Toni locked herself in the shop. It was Steve who had to break the news to Peter, Nat had told everyone else but Steve wanted to tell Peter in person. The boy had been so excited about the baby; essentially, she would have been his sister. When Steve knocked on his bedroom door, Peter looked up, his face an expanse of hope.
Both Tony and Steve rolled over to face each other in the middle of their bed. Neither of them liked getting up early, but they had both stayed up particularly late getting Easter set up for today. And then they had some fun of their own before they had gone to bed the night before. They gave each other knowing looks before they simultaneously rolled out of bed, making both of their children squeal in glee and delight.
Tony was in his arms before he could even think about it. Steve’s heart broke, listening the sobs his boyfriend was so desperately trying to control and hold back. Tony had been taught to bottle his emotions for as long as he could remember. It took Steve forever to convince him that it was okay to cry and be vulnerable.
not four hours ago. Since then I’ve been trying to get a hold of any member of the team. That’s all I want to do, talk!”
Tony had extricated himself from the family puppy pile. He needed to check on Peter first and then get some work done. Whoever had taken his children needed to found and made to pay. He was thinking of programs he could run as he tip toed to Peter’s room. He peeked his head through the door, smiling at what he saw. Peter was starfished across his bed, sleeping so hard he was practically drooling. Tony quietly shut the door again and let Peter sleep, God knows the kid needed the rest.
“Please papa! Don’t go! I’ll be good, I promise! Please don’t leave me! Daddy! Don’t go! Don’t leave me! Please don’t go!”
“JARVIS?”
The cravings were the weirdest fucking thing ever though. Because instead of wanting normal food things, Toni would wake up in the middle of the night, craving things like Clif bars topped with ice cream. Steve, being the absolute angel he was, would dutifully get up and go get or make the food. Toni didn’t think she had ever loved her husband more.
She latched onto Peter with all her might, as if he would disappear if she didn’t. Peter, for his part, didn’t quite know what to do. Papa or daddy usually dealt with nightmares. He didn’t know how to handle them. He awkwardly wrapped Peggy in a hug, just trying to stop the crying.
Again, no response, just gasps and more sobs. Tony knew all the gasping and wheezing he was hearing wasn’t good. It sounded similar to a panic attack and Tony fucking prayed that it wasn’t a panic attack.
Of course, with their luck and their lives, the peace couldn’t last. They were all just sitting down to eat when JARVIS interrupted them.
Toni turned around and smiled at him, “I’m working?”
“Hear ya loud and clear, Cap. Staying with Peter.” Rhodey was slightly reluctant, but Peter didn’t look like he wanted to be left by anyone, anytime soon anyhow.
There was a sniffle before the response, “Everyone here would have gotten along just fine before SHIELD found me. Nobody here needs me. I don’t belong here. Nobody even wants me here. I’m more trouble than I’m worth.”
Flopping down on the bed, Tony grinned at Steve as he sighed. “Finally, soldier. Now, it’s been a long day. Get down here with me!”
“Tony, I don’t know what’s been going on with you, but I don’t understand why you’ve been so distant recently. When the kids came home, we agreed we’d take some time. Some time to just be a family again. No work, no SHIELD, no Avenging unless it was absolutely necessary.” Steve started walking back towards the bed, “Sweetheart, I married you. That means we’re there for each other in thick times and in thin. I just want to be there for you. Can you please just talk to me?”
Sam took a deep breath, “I don’t know man, but I just know that if we have to fight our way out of this one? You’re gonna need to be at the top of your game, all of us are. If we’re not, we might as well just surrender.
He was spread out on the couch, while the superhusbands were curled together on the loveseat. They sat up while he was stretching.
“I think she means days like these, Tony.” Bruce answered.
“Daddy! Tummy hurts! Hurts, daddy, hurts!”
? Huh, Pietro? Was that your brilliant plan?” Wanda was clearly livid, not caring of who heard her.
reason we’re doing this one is because it’s your daughter. If you push your luck, I’ll turn this over to the normal authorities, are we clear?”
Sam just flipped him off as he walked back down the hallway.
Her face took on that hard expression again, “Stark, I’m going to tell you this once, and if you don’t believe me fine, then don’t. But you listen carefully. Steve Rogers is in love with
“Steve? Honey, can you hear me? Steve?” Toni’s voice was trembling.
She stopped just long enough to slap Peggy. Then she went straight back to talking. But Peggy wasn’t listening anymore, she just tried to stop crying.
Next to him, Steve woke up, much in the same state Tony was in. He was sweating and breathing hard, taking a minute to separate the dreams from reality. Tony didn’t know what Steve had been dreaming about, they hadn’t been sharing nightmares for the past few days, they were just too much.
She was getting ready for bed when Steve came in. Toni had just gotten back from Africa, overseeing the implementation of new water filtration systems in Ghana. They locked eyes and just stared at the sorrow in each other’s eyes for what seemed like eternity before Steve surged forward and kissed her.
Mommy, who had left her. Mommy, who had let Jeff do bad things. Mommy, who she loved. Mommy, who went out and didn’t come back. Mommy, who let her cry
“Congrats, you two! It’s a girl!” Dr. Evans had her usual trademark smile.
Was it getting hot in here? J was supposed to keep the temp at a steady 70, but maybe something was off. Also, it was getting harder to breathe, which wasn’t unusual when he had the arc reactor, but he hadn’t really had breathing problems since then. He vaguely heard JARVIS saying something, but really couldn’t hear. Tony stumbled toward the couch, after that everything went kind of fuzzy, like he there but also wasn’t. Why was breathing so hard again?
Steve was desperately trying to get the kids to eat their vegetables. Spoiler, it wasn’t working. Tony had always been so much better at this, but lately? Steve could count on one hand the amount of times he’d seen his husband in the last week.
Steve still looked visibly shaken after Bucky collapsed. Tony wanted to coddle him, but unfortunately, the coddling would have to wait.
Steve looked up at Tony, panic quickly taking over his features.
Clint and Nat were handling all the interrogations themselves. It slowed down the process just slightly, but no one was going to say anything. Those two had murder in their eyes, reserved for the people that had taken their niece and nephew.
Peggy was still whimpering into Tony’s chest, but she moved her head in what seemed like a nod. They were gonna take what they could get.
A small smile appeared on his face, “Yeah, J. Thanks.”
. I grieved, I held you, I was there, and now you just run?”
Screams or maybe just shouting.
“Fair enough.” A pause, and then, “Kiss me?”
They laid there for a while after Steve finished. Steve was lounging with his feet in Bucky’s lap when Bucky spoke up.
Steve just hugged him tighter, “Peggy’s at home Peter. She’s waiting for us with Aunt Pepper and Aunt Sharon.”
Both of them smiled down at their daughter, “Promise.”
Tony didn’t know what to think in that moment. He had been so prepared for this, but nothing could have ever prepared him for the moment it actually happened. If his entire being wasn’t focused on finding his children, he was fairly positive he’d be in the middle of a panic attack. As it was, he just pushed the thrusters to go even faster.
And so, Tony didn’t. He fell asleep in the workshop whenever he just couldn’t run on caffeine anymore. This solution seemed to work. That is until Steve found out.
At this, Natasha got up and left the room, leaving Tony with his thoughts.
And that’s where Tony stopped him, “Whoa, sport. Slow your horse there. That’s not at all what we were going to say. Just hear us out, okay?”
Silence. And then,
“I will continue to monitor Captain Rogers’ vitals accordingly.”
Steve breathed a sigh of relief, “Yeah Tony, it’s me. What happened?”
Meanwhile, Bucky was awake. Bruce wasn’t sure exactly what was going on. Bucky was locked in a Hulk proof room, for safety reasons. According to Natasha, what Steve and Tony had experienced was the Winter Soldier. But the unknowns about the situation vastly outweighed what the team did know about Bucky. By all accounts, he shouldn’t have even been alive. The official story was that James Buchanan Barnes had been killed in action in the Alps. They now knew that that wasn’t true, but until Steve could be pulled away from his family, they weren’t quite sure what to do.
A sigh escaped from Steve, who only cuddled Tony all the closer, knowing he needed the human touch right now. It wasn’t something he got a lot of at home.
“It’s not funny, Peggy! Daddy! It’s all sticky and yucky and cold. Help me!”
Peter looked at Tony, “Daddy, what does ‘ad longitudinem’ mean?”
That sounded like daddy. She’d play along for now.
Fighting his way out of the embrace to face the super-soldier, Tony huffed. “I’m being serious here, Steve! I think Pepper might have been on to something. Peggy talked after HYDRA, but we know there’s still issues there, right?  Well, I’m just saying that now might be a good time to start looking for a therapist.”
“B-but we need to get ready to go and you shouldn’t be working if you’re in labor and I just think we should go upstairs!” His spluttering really was adorable.
Steve’s voice broke her out of the memories she was floating in and Toni stood up and stretched, “Yeah, let’s get this vacation started.”
That single word had the weight of the last year crashing down around Toni and with that weight came her walls. Toni started crying with Peter and soon, the whole team was wrapped around them. All of them together as they hadn’t been in forever.
“Sir, it appears that Captain Rogers is in distress.”
The boy nodded before settling back against the couch. Tony continued, he was on a roll here.
“Sir, the children’s trackers have been removed. Their heart rates were spiking sharply before the trackers were removed. I have taken the liberty of prepping the Mark 45 for flight. Captain Rogers has already been notified.”
He made his way down to the shop, immediately getting to work on the HYDRA files and facial recognition programs.
“Baby? Can you hear us?”
Bruce pressed the buzzer, signaling that Natasha should back off for now. She looked at the window reluctantly, but knew that they weren’t going to get much out of him anyhow. They were all hoping that seeing Steve when Bucky wasn’t the Winter Soldier would jog his memory enough to start talking. It was practically grasping at straws, but hope was hope, no matter what form it took.
Pep and Nat just laughed.
Steve tried to sit up, so Tony sat up with him, still keeping him tucked into a hug as best he could.
Steve took over from here, “Your first middle name? Sarah? That was my mom. Let me tell you, Peggy, my mom was a saint. And one of the strongest women I’ve ever known. She’d be proud that you have her name. I’ll tell you all about her as you grow up.”
Steve reached over for Tony’s hand and squeezed, “Let’s bring her home.”
When they finally came up for air, Steve was crying.
“WHY DID I MARRY YOU WITH YOUR STUPID FUCKING SUPER SOLDIER SPERM? I SWEAR WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE I’M PUTTING YOU BACK ON ICE JUST SO THAT I DON’T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS AGAIN. THIS FUCKING HURTS YOU DICK DON’T FUCKING LAUGH AT ME!”
Steve was working on some paperwork from the latest mission and was planning on relaxing for the rest of the day, maybe taking his sketchbook out to the roof, when JARVIS started talking.
They were laying in bed, just being together, when Steve started talking, “Promise me you’ll talk to me?”
The genius smiled, “Sounds great!” Turning to her husband, she said, “Let’s go home.”
Steve just glared, “We’re going, Petey. Let’s go, Peggy’s been asking for you.”
This resulted in more sobbing, which led to Peggy throwing up again. Tony just held her, knowing there wasn’t much else he could do. Most of the team had gotten the stomach flu before Peter was in the picture, and the only thing to do was wait it out. It hadn’t been pleasant for any of them, but for Peggy? Tony didn’t even want to imagine what that felt like.
“Papa?”
“I’m pregnant, Tony.”
Toni gulped.
Tony was whispering, not wanting to disturb his family, “What happened?”
“Oh sweetheart,” Tony walked over and picked Peggy up out of bed, “let’s get you cleaned up huh?” He walked towards the bathroom where JARVIS already had the bath running. Peggy’s clothes were wet and stained with puke. Tony just peeled them off and checked the water. Not too hot but not too cold either. He put Peggy in the tub just as Steve walked in with Peter. Peter looked just as bad as Peggy did, if not worse. Both of the kids were still crying, but they also desperately needed baths. Steve and Tony did their best to calm them down while getting them clean, hoping that they wouldn’t throw up again until after they were out of the bath.
“He’s going to be beautiful and he’s developing right on track for the 7 month mark. Do you guys have any questions?” Dr. Evans handed Toni a towel to clean off the gel.
It became tradition for Steve to either bring her food or drag her upstairs to eat the food. And if it wasn’t food, there was always something for them to bond over. After awhile, and it took her longer than she liked to admit, she realized that Steve was trying to flirt with her.
“Steve, baby, my labor hasn’t really started. It won’t truly even
Steve turned around, “Relax? Sam, how can I? Peter and Peggy are gone, I don’t know when they’re gonna be back. Tony’s holed up in the shop in the hopes that we can bring Peggy home today. But God knows when we’re gonna get to bring Peter home, those bastards don’t look like they’re gonna give him up anytime soon. How the hell am I supposed to relax when I feel so fucking helpless to help my family?”
Pietro yawned from his spot on the couch, “I should probably get going, it’s been a long day and I’m sure you guys want to get some sleep.”
Toni sat up from her position on the couch while Rhodey went to go get a doctor. Sam helped her up and kept his arm wrapped around her as she made her way to the bed. There were hopeful looks on both of their faces.
It started just like every other day. Steve got up for a run and Tony stumbled into the shower. JARVIS already had coffee waiting in the kitchen. Tony got the kids up after coffee, and Steve was making breakfast. Steve went to get Peggy ready and Tony took Peter. There were kisses goodbye all around and then Steve took the kids to school on his way to SHIELD. Everything was normal. Until JARVIS set off the alarm.
God bless Rhodey. He already had his arms open, as if he had anticipated that she would need a hug before they got there.
Natasha looked exasperated, “Of course that’s what I meant! I hate the fact that SHIELD didn’t think to do more than hand him files and get him an apartment. With so much happening at once, they couldn’t have possibly thought he was okay!”
Steve meandered his way over. As he got closer, Tony could smell food. Good food smells. Good enough to make him stand up and get a look.
He quietly thanked both Pepper and Sharon, showing them to the door. He turned around, ready to talk to Steve. What he saw however, melted his heart. Both of the kids were cuddled on top of Steve like a puppy pile and he had an arm around each of them. All three of them were also asleep. Tony grabbed his phone to take a picture.
Walking over, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, “You ready to go home yet? Cause I don’t know about you, but I want to see our son.”
All Steve and Tony saw was a silver flash. That is until Peter and Peggy were squealing and giggling in Pietro’s hug. They had tensed up at first, not knowing who was coming in, but when they saw their oldest, the couple relaxed and grinned.
“Peggy! Peggy! Can you hear me? Peggy? Can you wake up? Peggy, please!”
“I swear, if you idiots leave me in charge of this group again with no notice, no one is ever going to find your bodies. Do we understand each other?”
college J, you traitor.”
“Tasha? Tasha?! Can you hear me? We need to move!”
The couple was stuck in traffic on their way back to the tower when Steve spoke up,
“Braxton-Hicks?”
“We can’t just leave this alone, Tony! It’s serious!” Steve was trying his hardest not to raise his voice.
“And who said I wanted her?” The man leered at him before roughly grabbing his arm. Peter did his best to hold onto Peggy, but there wasn’t much he could do other than scream.
He started out softly, “I know what Howard always said, but I don’t know how many times I have to tell you, that’s not true. If you’re struggling, I’m here, the team is here. You can talk to any of us Tony. Not one person on this team is going to judge you. No one. If you’re not sleeping, that’s important to us. It’s important that we know, because we all have to have each other’s backs. We work as a team, that’s the only way we defeat whatever’s out there. I know you’ve always been told not to rely on anyone else Tony, and I know that despite what I tell you, you’re always gonna believe that in some way, shape, or form. I just,” Steve paused, “I just want to be able to be there for you, no matter when it is, or what it is. I want to be the person you turn to.”
The elevator dinging brought Steve out of his thoughts. Both the kids whipped their heads around to see who was coming up. Visitors, no matter how often they saw them, were always a hit with the kids.
“They showed up on the front step about an hour ago. Barton knocked ‘em out with tranq arrows pretty quick. They’ve been here ever since.”
Nat was already in the driver’s seat when they got there, Toni whispering, “I killed her. I killed her. My baby. My baby. My baby,” over and over, the whole way to the hospital, Steve’s tears falling into her hair.
Tony’s prolonged silence was answer enough for Steve.
“What do you mean, you can’t put the call through JARVIS? I know they’re all there, I saw the jet land
Steve cleared his throat, “Why hasn’t this happened before? Have I just been oblivious or…?”
“I’m gonna go make some food. Any requests?”
“Yes, Captain Rogers?”
“Can we go upstairs to our bed before we get any further into this? You and your youthfulness might be just fine sitting on this floor, but I, as old as I am, am most certainly not.”
And that’s how they fell asleep,Tony covered by Steve, getting the first real sleep he’d had in weeks.
Steve picked Toni up being careful, but still swinging her into a hug, “Oh my god, baby! We made a baby! Oh my god, this is incredible!”
Steve laughed at that, "I'd remind anyone who tries, but no one knows we're dating sooo.”
Steve shuddered at his words, “Please don’t say that, because I know you mean it. I can’t lose you too, not after everyone else.”
This one's slightly shorter. Also the updates might not come as often as this one did. I have a vague end goal in mind for this story, but nothing concrete right now. So if there isn't an update for a while, it's gonna be me figuring out where to go from here.
“Sir appears to be having a panic attack Captain Rogers. Sir has experienced panic attacks before, after the Battle of New York.”
They exchanged a few words as Tony was parking the car.
Peter and Peggy were over the moon to have a new brother, and a big brother at that. Peggy already had Peter, but Peter was absolutely thrilled to have a big brother. The two bonded over the fact that they had powers and it turned out that Pietro was very intelligent. He and Peter were down in the shop almost everyday with Tony.
Surprisingly, Clint was the first to congratulate the couple, “You guys are having a baby! This is great! Congratulations guys!” He came over and hugged both of them, “I can teach it to shoot, this is gonna be awesome!”
“добрый утренний солдат.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The barrage of questions started immediately, “How long have these been going on? Why didn’t I know sooner? What causes your panic attacks? How can I help in the future? Does anyone else know about them?” Steve looked like he had more, but Tony cut him off there.
Steve just laughed and told his husband to keep his eyes on the road.
There's a line that could be read as a reference to rape, if that's a trigger for you, please skip after Steve and Tony's bit until after the next break in the text.
Tony was out like a light.
“Papa and daddy are gonna be here real soon, Peggy. You’ll see! And Aunt Tasha and Uncle Sam! Oh, and Uncle Rhodey’ll be with ‘em too! Everyone will be here soon and then we’ll get to go home!”
“Steve! It’s fine! Just give me like another hour, or until my water breaks and then we can upstairs, okay? I really need to get this coding done before this baby gets here.” Toni had turned around initially, but was now steadily working at the holo screens again.
Thanks for reading!
Peggy and Peter nodded their heads so quickly Tony was concerned about whiplash. After nodding their consent however, the two of them sprinted off to the living room to gawk at the Easter decorations that had blown up all over their living room.
Fury slammed his hand on the table, “We ARE operating under the assumption that these fuckers have access to magic of some kind or another. Until such time as it is clear that they don’t, we need a better solution. Understand?”
The man was furious. Not the kind of furious where they made up after Toni did something reckless in the field, but the kind of furious where Steve spent the day in the gym, breaking punching bag after punching bag.
“возвращение на родину.”
Her husband’s tone of voice changed when he started talking, “Okay, well I mean, the hospital bag is already in the car, but we’ll have to call Nat, cause I think she’s at SHIELD right now. If we call now she should be able to make it back before we have to leave and then we have to tell the rest of the team. And we should go upstairs, just so that we’re prepared for when we have to leave and -”
Peter looked over Tony’s shoulder at Steve when Tony mentioned ice cream. Steve justed nodded with a smile on his face. That was the last straw for Peter.
Tony smiled the first time he saw all of them together. He had come up to the penthouse to get something and seen the kids with Bucky and Steve in the living room. Watching all of them put a melancholy smile on his face. They were just fine without him.
Unfortunately, that became impossible.
A loud sigh escaped from Bucky, “Well, from what I’ve heard, Tony’s had issues with affection and people leaving him before, right?”
Tony, you get that, don’t you?”
He’d traveled for a bit after New York and then worked with SHIELD quite a bit. But for some strange reason, he decided to move into the tower with the other Avengers. Not that many of them were there very often. Nat and Clint were at SHIELD or out on a mission more often than not, Thor was usually off world, and Bruce was only there because Tony had the best science tech money could buy.
Steve nodded, still not understanding where Bucky was going with this train of thought.
Now Steve was so confused it wasn’t even funny, “Bucky, I don’t understand your point here. There is a point isn’t there?”
Tony just buried his head in his hands, “I don’t know Tasha! I’d like to think he wouldn’t, but in reality, why would he want me over Barnes? Give me one good reason why he’d want to be with me and not Barnes!”
The inventress got nods from around the room, “Well, I don’t know if this is because of all of those or what, but I took a pregnancy test a few weeks ago.”
Tasha turned in a circle, “Clint?”
“Can you repeat that?”
He was still sifting through his thoughts, when the elevator doors opened. Natasha walked out, took one look at him, and had him in a hug in the next five seconds.
Tony looked up from his phone, “Oh yeah, no problem. JARVIS and I’ll strip down one of the older marks, update the outside, and modify JARVIS’s programming. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.”
Steve picked him up, rubbing his tummy as best he could, “I wish I could baby, but there’s not a whole lot I can do right now buddy.”
There's more descriptions of torture in this chapter. Slightly more graphic than the last ones but not awful. However, as always, please read with caution. Thanks for reading!
All of these thoughts, feelings, memories, kept flooding through his head in no particular order. They weren’t welcome. But Tony didn’t know how to make them stop.
I'm thinking of doing some more Peter-centric chapters. It wouldn't be until later, when I get to the root of Peggy's problems. But I think putting some more of Peter in this story would be a good thing, as most of it had been centered around Peggy. What do you guys think? Leave me a comment with your opinion!
“Then we’ll see you at two Peter. Have a great day!”
“You’re an idiot, you know that right?”
Definitely screams this time.
Toni dropped a kiss on his head as he cried, “Peter, don’t you ever be sorry. If you wanna call me mom, I don’t have any issue with that, got it? And I know I was gone and I didn’t tell anyone. I’m sorry I worried everyone, but I just needed some time. Please don’t cry anymore, kiddo. No more tears are necessary today, okay?”
But honestly? She wouldn’t have this life any other way.
they had agreed on this, but it had happened, and Tony had assured him that the twins wouldn’t get anywhere near Peggy or Peter.
Steve was still crying, but the tears were different from before, “Of course that’s enough. I love you too. Yes you can call me sweetheart." A pause, and then, "Can I call you doll?”
“Daddy!”
“Sir, as part of my protocols, I am obligated to remind you that you have now gone 72 hours without any substantial amount of sleep. Shall I alert Captain Rogers?”
The door to the shop whooshed open, signaling that someone had come in. Tony really couldn’t be bothered, nobody could get in without an access code, and those
hadn’t been to see Barnes yet, Tony couldn’t help but start distancing himself. Once Steve did see Barnes again, Tony would be no more than a speck. Sure, they were married, but Barnes had been first. Barnes had more history with Steve, more to offer to Steve. More than just money and Iron Man as team member. He just had more.
“Sir, it appears Miss Peggy is asking for entrance. Shall I let her in?”
Tony knew he was dreaming. He had to be. It had to be a dream because he didn’t go through the wormhole in Afghanistan. His dad hadn’t been there in New York. So, logically, Tony knew this must be a dream.
Steve was trying to reassure Peggy as best he could, “We’ll be back real soon, sweetheart, okay? Director Fury just needs papa and daddy right now. But when we get back, we’ll get all the blankets and pillows and build a pillow fort in the living room, okay? We’ll be back soon, sweetheart.”
So Steve dragged Tony upstairs for lunch. Tony grumbled through the whole thing, despite the fact that his stomach had been growling the whole time Steve had been in the shop.
They got another nod from Pietro and then Steve took over, “We know you’re still a minor. And yes, you’ve been on your own for a few years now, but legally here in the States, if you’re a minor you need a guardian. Tony and I, we’ve been talking about it a lot, and uhm, well, if you’d be okay with it, we’d uh, well we uhh.”
Steve’s heart broke just a little bit more at this confession, sometimes he really wanted to march right over and sock Howard Stark straight in the jaw. The man was the sole cause of Tony’s crippling self-doubt, despite the fact that Tony was the smartest person Steve knew. From that self-doubt sprung any number of other issues that Tony refused to talk about. Anything from anxiety to depression to anorexia, on occasion. Maria wasn’t much help either. Tony had explained that when he was younger, his mother had been his rock, but as he grew up and his father became the man he is today, his mother started distancing herself. Steve had half a mind to walk over to the Stark house right now and demand answers. Tony was clearly in pain, most likely from something that his father had said or done. And Steve was powerless to do anything about it. He could offer comfort, but couldn’t do anything to prevent the hurt.
A month later, they had most of their fears out in the open and calmed. Two weeks after that, they started trying. Six months later, when they still hadn’t conceived, Toni went to see her OB/GYN. They ran tests which ultimately said that there wasn’t any particular reason they weren’t getting pregnant, it just wasn’t happening.
It seemed like years before the elevator opened in front of the shop doors, and even longer before JARVIS opened the shop doors themselves.
“Печь.”
Steve was still whispering quiet I love yous to Tony, when Tony’s cries started to slow.
Steve started by saying, “JARVIS told me to come down, that your vitals were off. Do you know what happened?”
through nightmares on her own. Mommy.
“I just came up to get some sleep, JARVIS wouldn’t let me stay in the shop anymore.”
They moved as one, calling for the promised back up as they went.
The couple didn’t wake up until afternoon the next day. But the important thing? They woke up together. They woke up together for the first time in almost two months. They woke up together with smiles on their faces and lazy good morning kisses. They woke up together and JARVIS notified them that Bucky had taken the kids to his floor for the day. They woke up together and ate together and talked together. For an entire day, they did absolutely everything together. It was like being on their honeymoon all over again.
Steve was flopped face first on their bed and let out a groan of defeat.
He started talking, “Oh nothing. I was just laughing because none of you can fit in the suit. It’s designed for daddy and daddy only. People have to be smaller than him to fit inside. And the only one here that’s smaller than daddy is me, but I’m too little. Guess you just can’t use it!”
Tony deflated just a bit, “I probably could, but I wouldn’t know what to have you do. It’s not that I don’t think you couldn’t figure it out, but I think it’ll go faster if I just do it myself.”
what he had done wrong. At first, he thought that maybe he was overprotective when the kids were first home, but then figured that Tony probably had the tower on lockdown. So it couldn’t have been that.
Steve woke up before the kids, which wasn’t surprising. He usually didn’t sleep for very long, the serum and his years of military service making him a morning person. He just wasn’t expecting to wake up with his arms full of Peter and Peggy. Steve almost dropped Peggy before he realized what he was holding. He quickly recovered and looked to his left. Tony was curled around Peter in his sleep, still holding the tablet he had inevitably been working on before passing out. Steve just smiled, Tony hadn’t been getting anywhere near the amount of sleep he should have. With the kids missing, neither of them had slept very well, but Tony never slept well to begin with.
The only thing he saw was Tony, screaming and sobbing, trying to break free of the covers.
Tony was working on some SI paperwork in his office when he heard the elevator opening.
“It appears Sir is in need of assistance, his vital readings are not in alignment with his normal vital signs.” Steve thought the AI sounded rather concerned, and to be honest, he was too.
Tony tried to keep a straight face, "Well,ya know, we were just wondering if you knew who had been drinking all the milk and putting back the empty carton. And since Clint has been deemed innocent for once, you’re kind of the only person left. Unless there’s someone else in the tower that I don’t know about. Which, is impossible, considering JARVIS is on at all times.”
Tony crouched down to be at eye level with their son, “Peter, we’ll be back in a few hours. You’re gonna make all kinds of new friends today, I just know it. We’ll be back at 2 squirt, and then you and DUM-E can play catch the rest of the day, sound good?”
So Toni started on fertility drugs, hoping that maybe they would work. Clomiphene increased the number of eggs released each month, which also meant there was a higher chance of multiples. That scared both of them out of their minds at first, but they both just wanted a baby so bad they were willing to try anything.
That had turned into a fantastic night.
Tony was working on the newest arc reactor for the tower when JARVIS called.
That got his attention. After the first few weeks, Steve had given up trying to get him to talk, seeming to resign himself to the fact that Tony was going to lock himself in the workshop. In a way, Tony was glad. It would make the inevitable rejection that much easier. On the other hand, it only served to prove Tony’s point. Steve would fall in love with Barnes all over again and leave him in the dust.
His thoughts were interrupted by Peggy.
Tony turned around, wrapping his arms around Steve, “I just want to protect her. But I don’t know how. How can I? How can we? She won’t tell us what’s wrong.”
Tony spoke up right away, “Well, if I’m leaving the suit in a locker, someone has to come pick it up right? Just send in some agents in disguise and catch the sucker red handed.”
Rhodey was surprised that there wasn’t more resistance on the way. There were a few goons he had to take out, but not nearly as many as anticipated. They were probably being called to other sectors of the bunker. He reached the room where Peter was supposed to be and busted
Tony practically busted the door down ten seconds later, “Peter? What’s wrong bud? I’m right here.”
“Daddy! It was awful! Mommy was so mean, she hurt me, papa. Like how Peter got hurt before you saved him? Not as bad, but she hit me like that. All the time. And she told me I messed up her life and that she didn’t love me and she wished I’d never been born. Jeff was really mean too. I think he might have been my father, but I’m not sure. And he did all kinds of bad things to me, daddy. And I begged mommy to make him stop, but she didn’t do anything. She just let him hurt me and then she’d take his belt and hit me with it. Oh papa, it was awful! And nobody came to help me and then they just left me! It was scary and I was all alone and then the nice lady came and then I came to live with you. But before that, oh daddy, it was awful! Please tell me you’re not sending me back! I can’t do that, papa! I can’t go back!”
Tony and Steve were trying to have a conversation, knowing that when the kids finally woke up, they weren’t going to have any alone time for a while. Problem was, every time they started talking, Peggy would start to wake up, which was one thing they didn’t want. Because when Peggy woke up, Peter woke up and then nobody slept for a solid twelve hours.
“Point taken,
Steve grabbed the blanket off the back of the couch and tried again, “Sweetheart, can you talk to me? I want to help.”
Tony set the plate of pancakes on the table and scooped Peter into his arms, uncaring of the maple syrup that was steadily getting everywhere, “Okay, Petey. Let’s get you a bath and then a change of clothes, huh, squirt?”
Luckily, both of the assassins were there. They could keep Cap company until Toni was done with the work in the shop. Which was going to be awhile. The idiots in R&D couldn’t work out some simple bugs in the new StarkPad software. She had to do everything herself.
Of course, Steve heard him. And of course, he sat straight up. His response came in a whisper, loud enough that Tony could hear, “What?”
lost a daughter. Not just you,
In the years that followed, nothing was ever perfect. Not that their lives had ever been close to perfect in the first place, everyone made it perfectly clear to Peggy that none of this was her fault. Nothing was perfect but they were getting there. The nightmares were less and less frequent, only really showing up if something had triggering had happened that day.
Steve just sighed, giving him what Clint called “the eyebrows of disappointment.”
The men were watching on the monitor, just waiting for Peter to wake up. They were planning on exchanging Peggy for the suit and Peter for Steve’s blood, but finding out that Peter was already enhanced was so much better. They wouldn’t have to try to extract the serum now. As long as they had Peter, they could do what they pleased. HYDRA was confident that neither SHIELD nor the Avengers had any idea where they were holding Peter, therefore keeping their positions safe for as long as necessary.
The others checked in on them periodically, making sure they were eating and drinking, but for the most part, they were doing their best to find the littles that had captured everybody’s hearts.
If they could have read each other’s minds at that moment, there would have been mirrored thoughts. Because they were thinking the same thing. “Is this what love feels like?”
Fury had opened the door on the only two livings examples of HYRDA’S human experimentation, the Maximoff twins. They were locked on separate sides of the same room. He was running circles and looked like a silver blur in the room. She was slowly raising different objects in her room and throwing them against the plexi-glass.
we could both eventually be Avengers. What’s your deal?”
Clint ran over and scooped up his daughter, tossing her in the air as she laughed, “Daddy! Put me down!”
There was a jolt.
Pietro had Peter in his arms in a split second, dashing them both over to the open workbench where Steve was putting out the food. Tony followed behind them at a normal pace, laughing at the boys’ eagerness to get to food. Steve leaned down to kiss his husband and then his daughter, who was tugging on the bottom shirt impatiently. Eventually, the family settled around the workbench, eating, talking, and laughing about their day.
“Mmm. As much as I love kissing you, you should eat. I need to get back to my office before someone notices.”
After a while, it started working. It took a few minutes, but Tony could tell Steve was actually breathing. The sobs were still pretty bad, but at least he was breathing.
When they got back to SHIELD, Tony and Steve wanted to the interrogations themselves, but their way was barred by Fury himself.
Tony didn’t think he had ever run that fast in his life. When JARVIS had said there was an emergency in the penthouse, he didn’t even hesitate, he just ran, telling JARVIS to make the elevator go as fast as possible.
“Oh alright!” Toni threw her hands up in the air, “Fine! You win! Let’s go upstairs! JARVIS, put the shop in sleep mode but keep running that code, see if you can find the flaws.”
Steve didn’t think words were necessary, he leaned forward and kissed Tony. Which Tony was definitely not expecting. But, he wasn’t complaining either.
“From our intel,” Sharon threw the tablet at Tony, “it appears that originally, the twins signed on willingly for the experiment. However, we also think they were given false information to begin with. After this, there were several documentations of escape attempts that were unsuccessful. You rescuing Peter was their chance to get out. Why they came to us we don’t know.”
“I will need you to specify what you mean by “unusual” Dr. Banner.”
Tony grabbed Steve’s chin and made Steve look him in the eyes, “Steven Grant Rogers! You listen to me. Everybody here wants you to be here. I don’t ever want you to say that again! I want you! The team needs you. SHIELD may not like to admit it, but they need you too. And I can tell you right now, if your mother heard you talking like this, she’d slap you silly.”
“But Steve? I’m pregnant. That night before I left? Apparently that was enough. I’m six months along and I found out last week that it’s a boy. Did you hear that, baby? Peter’s gonna have a little brother in a few months. But he’s gonna need a dad. So please, Steve, you have to wake up. You just have to wake up!
Also a little bit on Peggy's past, this will eventually lead into the more complete story.
When they finally opened, Steve was running in at full speed, expecting blood or possible hostiles but only saw Tony. A Tony who looked like he was panicking and having trouble breathing, but Steve just couldn’t figure out why.
Peggy was curled in the corner, not crying, not screaming, just whimpering. Bucky had Peter cradled in his arms, they were both almost to the door. Peter was clearly struggling to get out of Bucky’s arms, but wasn’t having any luck.
He chuckled, “I don’t think I’ll ever forget the fight we had over your name, sweetheart. In the end though, we found the three strongest, most beautiful names we could think of. Your first name? You’re named after one of the most powerful women either of us ever knew. Margaret Carter. Her nickname was Peggy, just like you. You’ll learn more about her as you grow up.”
Toni was still smiling when he put her down. Her voice was quiet but her smile was as big as ever when she asked, “Do we tell the team? Or do we wait? Because it’s gonna be pretty obvious when I stop going out on missions. So either way, they have to know pretty soon. And yeah, I know you don’t usually tell people before the end of the first trimester, but they’re family and so I just didn’t know what we should do.”
Tony continued crying, almost unconsolably for the next few minutes. Finally though, he was able to talk, “J-just hold m-me? P-please? I need y-you right n-now.”
“Forever?”
He really wanted to argue with his husband more on this, he really did. But Steve couldn’t find fault with any of his reasoning. He just sighed and went along with it all. Maybe Tony was right and maybe something good might come out of this. Tony usually wasn’t wrong.
He trudged his way to the elevator to get to the common floor. Tony had designed all of their apartments with kitchens, but no one ever really used them. Most of the time, they liked being around each other. Most of the time being alone was just too much. The doors dinged open and laughter invaded the space. Steve was tempted to turn right back around and go home. Maybe dealing with other people was too much for today. Of course, someone saw him before he could make up his mind.
“Tony clearly it wasn’t nothing if JARVIS thought it necessary to call me down, and”
“Steve! She can’t even sleep through the night, why would we send her to be by herself all day? How would she even react to that? She was already abandoned once, what if she thinks we’re abandoning her too?” Tony was spouting question left and right, Steve could see he was getting agitated.
Tony looked up at Steve with tears in his eyes,”Please don’t go. Stay? Here? With me?”
After just sitting for a while, Tony moved, signaling he was ready to talk. Steve let him take his time.
JARVIS’s response was the same that it had been for the last three hours, “Sir has instructed me to not let calls through that do not detail a world ending catastrophe. You are welcome to leave a message, which I can relay at a later time.”
There was a chorus of whines from both the children, but Tony gave them the look and off they went. He rubbed the back of his neck before looking up,
Both looked about ready to argue, but somehow came to the conclusion that this was one battle they weren’t going to win.
Tony and Steve had frantically started searching when JARVIS first sent out the alert, but were talked back to SHIELD headquarters by Pepper, of all people. Since she was Peggy’s godmother, JARVIS had sent her the alert too, along with Rhodey and Sam.
The house was small, smaller than most of the houses that she owned. But for right now? It would do. This was Toni’s new sanctuary and no one would disturb her here. The workshop was adequate for the work she’d need to do for SI and apparently, she had already installed JARVIS in the house.
Bucky pulled him over to the sofa on the other side of the room, “Okay punk, spill. There’s never been anything we couldn’t tell each other and we both got all the time in the world. Spill.”
He got a kiss before a verbal response, “Tony, the day I don’t forgive you is the day you have full permission to throw me off the roof. I love you and that’s not going to change. I married you and we have two wonderful kids together. I just don’t understand why you didn’t talk to me. We’ve established that communication is necessary. Why didn’t you just talk to me, baby?”
Peggy sometimes tagged along, but she wasn’t quite on par with her brothers. The girl was whip smart for a three year old, but she preferred playing with the bots over anything and DUM-E and U were thrilled someone other than Steve wanted to play with them.
As soon as the doors opened, Steve could hear Tony. He heard the screaming and suddenly began to think he should have brought the shield. Steve just started sprinting toward Tony’s room.
Peter was still trying to comfort his sister when they started pumping the sleeping gas through the vent. It was invisible and scentless for the most part, someone would have had to have been looking for it to see it.
It had also never occurred to Tony, that Steve’s heart might be breaking too.
“Hey baby. I’m your mommy. And this asshole over here is your father. Oh hello precious.”
“Steve?” Tony sounded rather groggy, but at least he was talking. “What are you doing?”
A collective groan went up from around the breakfast bar.
Steve was trying to get ready for bed when there was a knock on the door. At first, he thought that maybe it was one of the kids. He knew it couldn’t have been Tony. Tony had never knocked on their bedroom door in his life, why would he start now? When he opened it, Steve was sorry to say he was disappointed. It wasn’t one of the kids, it was Bucky.
“I-I’m sorry I called you mom earlier. I k-know that you’re n-not. But I haven’t seen you in ages and a-all Pepper could tell us w-was that you were alive and I d-didn’t know if I’d ever see you again and I just-”
Steve had stopped pacing and was now looking out the windows, “I understand when you get busy, it’s happened before. But never in the seven years we’ve been married have you been ‘live in the shop for six weeks’ kind of busy.”
The elevator opening usually wasn’t a big deal, but Steve didn’t want the team to see him like this. He tried to tell whoever it was to go away, but just couldn’t get the words out. He didn’t have the strength to look and see who it was. He just knew that the team couldn’t see him like this, they’d never want him as their leader again.
The couple managed to get a few more hours of sleep, wrapped in each other’s arms, finding comfort where they could, worried sick about their children.
“This better be fucking good, Fury, or so help me god.” Tony was livid and Steve wasn’t very far off.
Steve couldn’t help but huff out a laugh, “As much as I wish we didn’t, I really think we do.”
Steve nodded, unsure of where Tony was going.
Steve lifted his head, “ Honey, did you hit your head down in the shop today or something?”
“But then this little guy would kick or I’d make a new breakthrough in a project or I’d remember everything we had built together. A-and I just couldn’t give up. So please, Steve, please don’t give up on me, on us. I’m not even asking for myself anymore. Just let this baby have a father, Steve, please!”
Peggy woke up. This time though, it looked like she was home. She could see the butterflies on her closet door, and yesterday’s clothes in the hamper. She could smell whatever it was that daddy drank all the time. (Personally, Peggy thought it smelled pretty bad, but both daddy and papa drank it, so it couldn’t have been all bad.) The instant someone stepped through the door, she knew it wasn’t home. Because the person who walked through the door didn’t live there.
“JARVIS, what’s going on?” Steve was frantic, he wasn’t sure what to do.
Steve perked his head up from his sketch book when he heard Toni hiss, immediately making his way over to the workbench.
From what everyone could piece together, Peggy had been raped, multiple times, by her mother’s boyfriend. When it got hard to keep her quiet, her mom dumped her on the steps of the firestation. From there, Peggy’s main concern seemed to be about Steve and Tony abandoning her or getting sick of her. They did their best to assuage these fears but everyone knew that time would be their best friend going forward. The family lived by the motto “actions speak louder than words.”
The captors hadn’t said anything. They showed Peggy and Peter, locked in the same cell. Peggy looked relatively unscathed, but Peter? Peter looked like he had been through hell and back. He was shirtless, and there were scars up and down his chest and back. Clearly, they had been much worse earlier, but due to his heightened healing abilities, they were just beginning to scar over. Surprisingly, Peter didn’t look frightened, in fact, he looked almost defiant. Like he was daring his captors to try anything more. He knew exactly who his family was, and knew they would find him, he just had to hold on. The video had one more thing to say, there was a sign at the end of the video. It demanded that Tony turn over the armor by the next day. If it was dropped off in the locker at Grand Central Station tomorrow by noon, Peggy would be returned by 6 pm. The sign made no mention of Peter or the captors wanting money or anything from Steve.
