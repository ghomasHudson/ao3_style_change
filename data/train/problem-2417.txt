But Sam didn't listen to him. He just turned and ran down the hall, slamming the door to the bathroom.
And it was true. All around them the children were slowly coming back to their senses, lowering their fists and makeshift weapons to look around in horror and confusion.
Awkwardness broken, the rest of dinner went smoothly with the brothers getting to know each other and the men they had become in the five years without their father. And getting to know the significant others that had helped them on their way. They reminisced a little, but their time was mostly filled with anecdotes from the past five years. There was still some tension hanging over their heads, evidenced in the way that they skirted certain subjects that delved a little too deep into their past, or the abrupt and awkward segues made by both Cas and Jess when they saw one of the brothers grit their teeth a little too tightly. But overall they both considered the dinner a very good step towards repairing their relationship.
“You’re not my secret,” he told him, seriously. Cas cast his eyes down to stare at the floor. “No, hey, look at me,” Dean said, lifting his chin up with a crooked finger. “You’re not my secret. Never, Cas.” He smirked. “You really think I’d give you that giant hickey if I didn’t want people to know I gave it to you?”
“You know, I managed to convince you that I was alright. I think Bobby might be willing to listen, as well.”
The day of Dean and Cas’ wedding (more like the day of their appointment at the courthouse) Sam hid all of their clothes save for their light up sweaters. He was almost too annoyed at the fact that they didn’t even seem to notice they were getting married in the most hideous sweaters on the planet to be happy for them. Almost.
Cas lies in bed by himself. When he’d come out of the bathroom the previous evening, Dean’d been gone. Baby hadn’t in the driveway, so the picture had been clear. Dean had terrorized him and just taken off. Cas doesn’t find it
damn quickly.” The sneer returns. “I knew you’d be a submissive little thing, shame I didn’t get a chance to try you out first.” He turns to Dean, who’s languidly stroking himself. “Not for lack of trying though.” They both laugh softly as they turn their attention back to Cas.
“What? I don’t get to decide what happens to me? I’m not letting anyone control me, not anymore.” He turns into a long gravel driveway. “In fact, not only are you not going to control me,” He stops the car and turns to face Cas again. “I’m going to control
“Nothing says anything for sure,” Charlie said. “Nobody’s ever tried to fight this thing. Or, seen it for that matter.”
“Goddamnit, Cas,” Dean said. “If you didn’t have this stupid overprotective thing this never would have happened.”
Dean couldn’t decide if that was cheesy and touching or just plain cheesy, so he settled on blushing and grinning. “Okay, but then you gotta wear that dark blue one you have. Because, it, uh, makes your eyes look pretty good, too. Not that they don’t look awesome all the time, but you know what I mean.”
Dean wiped a bead of sweat away before it managed to drip off the end of his nose. “I’m not the one who begged me to take them to the park.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, “but I had the whole falling in love with you thing going on to help. I’d really prefer Bobby to keep his hands off.”
“Dean’s going to be fine, Cas,” Charlie tried to soothe him. “And I don’t really think he’d appreciate being rescued to be told that you two had to move.”
“I’m not going to maul the guy, Sammy, Jesus,” Dean replied, standing on tiptoe to try and see over his ginormous brother’s shoulder. “I’m allowed to be excited.”
“You’re not dead either.” Cas shot him a grin. “You are dramatic, though. And pathetic, at your own admission. And I would really like you to answer my question, because I’m starting to get nervous.”
Cas forced himself to his feet and took a fumbling step towards his adversary, towards Luc. “I want it to be easy,” Cas said. “I want this to be over, so I’ll take the easy way out.”
Dean’s alcohol addled brain didn’t even attempt to process that mouthful in its entirety. “’M Dean,” he replied.
Dean pressed one more kiss into Cas’ lips before finally pulling away. “Let’s take it to my room.” Dean winked and grabbed the pie and two forks.
Dean slid to his knees in front of Cas and hesitantly reached his hands out, unsure of where he had been injured.
“I told you that you needed to take more advantage of being able to control the landscape,” Dean told him, jerkily making his way through the sky towards him.
So Spaghetti Bolognese it was. With a dumb salad on the side that Dean made Cas make. And of course, a pie for desert. Dean had even made it himself. He was just taking it out of the oven when there was a knock at the door.
Cas gave him another quick peck and then stood and left.  Dean watched him go, very much appreciating the view of his boyfriend’s denim clad backside.
Another nod. He thought about his mom, sitting at home next to the phone. They thought it would be best if she stayed in case Sam came home or someone called. There was a plain clothes officer with her. He couldn’t stop replaying the look on her face as she tried to tell Dean that he couldn’t go on the search. She was so terrified. Dean had never seen her look that way before. Never felt her clutch his shoulder so tightly it hurt. But what hurt worse was that tiny hint of anger buried underneath the worry and fear. Dean was the one who told Sam about the monster. Was it Dean’s fault that Sam was gone now? Maybe if he hadn’t been thinking about the monster, maybe it wouldn’t have come. Maybe it would have left Sam and his friends alone.
The last word was roared out and the creature lifted its foot for one final stomp, but Dean was ready this time. Pushing past the pain in his chest, Dean rolled the second he felt the foot leave his back. He swung his machete up at the same time and managed to slice the top of the adversary’s foot clean off.
A little smile lifted the corner of Cas’ mouth and he strode over to Dean and leaned in to give him a soft kiss. “I promise that next time I’ll be home in time for my snack.”
Dean blew out a breath as he thought it over. He showed Cas how to smash the marshmallow in the middle of the stack and pull the skewer out without it getting too messy. “Driving in my car,” he finally said. “Windows down, tunes turned up, just me and the open road.” He tore into his dessert, marshmallow and melting chocolate squeezing out between the graham crackers. He watched Cas do the same, smearing part of it along his cheek.
Cas shook his head in fond exasperation while Dean let out a howl of laughter. “I take back my earlier statement. You and Dean are reacting the exact same way.”
“Seriously?” Jess said, eyebrows raised in incredulity. “Maybe you should ask them for a school loan. I bet they’d give you a way better interest rate.”
Cas cocked his head to the side in thought. “Fine. I would like one thing more than to end his miserable life. Although, I still maintain that you would be happier without having to worry about your father showing up in your life again. So really, I would be fulfilling my top two aspirations at once.”
So here it is! I hope you all liked it!! Comments and kudos are always appreciated :) And if anyone wants my tumblr, you can find me at
Dean’s cheeks and ears turned pink. “What? No. I’m just…” He looked up and saw Charlie’s unimpressed stare. “Okay, I’m on his blog again. Shut up.”
!” Sam demanded. Dean would have called him petulant but the frustration and sincerity in Sam’s voice stopped him.
“So let me get this straight,” Dean said. “You’re not asking us to make it official by gettin’ it on in front of the whole school while I call you Mr. President? I officially don’t know what you’re talking about then.”
being this cuddly and protective over a monster. Maybe monster was too harsh, he didn’t really know what Cas was, but he didn’t think a monster would be rubbing small circles onto the back of his brother’s hand like that. That was something he did with Jess.
“You sure you ain’t a hunter?” Bobby asked after Cas regaled him with his knowledge on all things supernatural.
He collapsed against the front door as soon as he had it closed and took in huge, deep breaths like he was starved for oxygen. He didn’t know how long he sat like that, gasping for air, but it couldn’t have been too long since he heard footsteps and a graveled voice calling for him.
“I’m his husband,” Cas told him, wings flaring, trying to push past Dean to go in for another attack.
“You can squeeze in with me,” Dean said. “Come on, let’s go grab your pillow. We can pretend it’s like when we used to go camping out in the backyard and we had to squeeze in that tiny ass tent. It’ll be fun.” He pushed Sam away just enough to look him in the eye. “Okay?”
Pink stole over Cas’ cheeks. “You kept, I don’t know, bumping into me and sitting extra close and—and then you told me you liked the way I talk and I just…” His face was practically glowing by now, but Dean didn’t think it was something that Cas had to be embarrassed about. Especially not with the way it made Dean feel like he was floating off the ground.
That seemed to bring some life back into Dean and he smirked at his little brother. “The fifth grade field trip to the woods,” he said. “Watch out for the monster.”
“Wait,” Dean said, hurrying to get his crutches situated so he could follow. “Is that a yes? It’s not a no, right?”
“Freakin’ finally,” Dean muttered once the park came into view, the towering trees finally promising some much needed shade. “Go grab that table near the woods before someone else does,” he told Sam as he stopped to appreciate the fact that he’d finally arrived at their destination.
A little zing went through Dean at how good Cas’ hair looked all messy like that. But he quickly shook himself free from the thought, Gabe’s threats still fresh on his mind.
“Shit,” Charlie said, then louder, “Shit!” She wrung her hands. “Okay, fine. But you better not die in there, and you better explain everything when you wake up. Like, the second you wake up.”
Dean picked a pair of underwear out of the drawer, not bothering to check whether it was his or Cas’ (honestly, they didn’t even try to differentiate anymore), and slid them on. “It was alright. Tracy’s working out really well. Charlie is making me get a new employee anyway, though.”
Charlie tried to hide a smirk, but followed Dean as he struggled to walk off in a huff while holding two coffee mugs with one hand and balancing two muffins on a single plate in the other.
Dean sprayed water out of his mouth. “Oh my god, Cas,” he spluttered. “Who the fuck just says penis like that?”
“Push him off if he’s bugging you,” Sam told him with a shrug. “Otherwise just leave him. I don’t think he’s been sleeping much, lately.”
The answer was whispered, but it was still audible for the entire Great Hall to hear, as everyone had fallen silent to look over at the commotion Dean had made.
“Happy birthday, Cas!” Dean exclaimed. He had considered getting a blow horn to really commemorate the situation, but ultimately decided against it. In the morning, that much loud noise would be nothing but annoying, even if it was celebratory.
The structure beneath him began to shift and he knew he had been found. He beat his massive wings behind himself once, twice, and then took to the air, searching the ground as best as he could from his new vantage point. The height did allow him to scour more area, but oftentimes his adversary liked to take the shape of small creatures to evade Cas’ watchful eye. He tended to favor the snake.
Mary, of course, didn’t believe in the monster, but that hint… She was so tired of hearing about it. Exhausted and exasperated and frightened and Dean was the one who started it all.
“What the hell is dad doing here?” Sam asked, apparently having followed them. He seemed far more confused than worried.
He swam through the air slowly, clumsy in his movements but confident that he still had the upper hand.
Bobby shook his head and walked back towards the house, muttering, “Don’t know how Cas puts up with you,” under his breath.
Dean couldn’t help the smile that stole across his face. “Okay. But try and get some sleep now, okay?”
"Well, 'brother Gabey' made me sound like I was in the priesthood." Gabriel managed to steer Cas from the front door to the living room and sat him down on the couch. "Now tell me what troubles you, my child."
He cleared his throat, but the man made no indication that he had heard. Castiel sighed and tapped his fingers along the bar, trying to think of what to do next. He shuddered as he thought the phrase
Sam nodded. “Yeah. I promised I’d go, since it’s sort of my fault that dad is here in the first place.”
people, but like… like people.” Dean squeezed his eyes shut, aware that he wasn’t making much sense at all. He quickly shook his head and said, “Never mind. It’s stupid—just—never mind.”
Charlie and Jo shone their flashlights onto the children who were now only a dozen paces away, gathering around the monster, Sam getting up to join them.
He scrambled off of whatever it was as fast as he could manage, accidentally elbowing it in the side. It let out an ‘oof’ at the contact and Dean yelped involuntarily.
“Please,” she said, offended. “I’m just trying to say that seeing him tonight and how he reacted to everything, maybe you don’t know the whole story.”
A huge smile on his face, Sam nodded and pressed a hand to his mouth to keep the laughter from escaping.
Cas took in a huge gulp of air and finally managed to straighten up. “Alright, I’m sorry,” he said, but then one look back at Dean’s now blushing face had him laughing all over again. It was another minute before Cas was able to look at Dean, who was watching him sullenly with his arms crossed, without giggling. “I’m sorry,” he finally said. “But you are never going to live that down.”
Cas sighed. “We live next to a law school, Dean. A rather prestigious one, at that. One where someone of Sam’s caliber would definitely be able to get in.”
“Well, at least you admit it. That’s the first step,” Cas said, walking by him and patting him on the cheek.
woke up exhausted. He supposed it was part of the job, but that didn’t mean he had to enjoy the perpetual fatigue.
He turned to get a better look and deflated. Sam was hunched in on himself, eyes rimmed red as if he had been crying.
There were fingers at his jaw, tilting his head up to look into green eyes filled with concern. “I asked if you were okay.”
A large tiger like figure appeared, slinking out of the water and onto the sand. It turned to face Dean with a smile filled with sharpened teeth.
“I know you got a face perfect for the radio, but buddy, with that voice your only audience would be the deaf.” It wasn’t Dean’s best line, but he was a little preoccupied with the giant, probably gnarly looking foot trying to squash him into the ground.
“You know,” Cas said softly, sounding a little embarrassed. “I, um,” he cleared his throat. “When I told Meg we were going to the dance together… I didn’t think I was lying.” His head was turned away from Dean, staring resolutely at the couple dancing to their right, but his grip around Dean had tightened with nerves.
Cas didn’t even have enough time to react before he felt feet dig into his back, sending him crashing to the beach below.
“We should probably try and get out of this hole,” Dean finally said, looking around and assessing the situation. It was deeper than expected, but he was pretty sure he’d be able to crawl out with moderate ease.
Suddenly he was in a motel room, the stale scent of cigarettes and whiskey filling his nostrils. There was yelling and shouting and loud, loud banging. The hits were coming, he knew they were coming. They would be bad this time. He had failed. He didn’t do his job so the hits were going to come and he was going to hurt and the banging was just so
Cas bit his lip. His sweet tooth wasn’t anywhere near as bad as his brothers, but he did like a good candy bar at the end of the day. “Your mom would buy me candy.”
“He’s like—he’s dreamy. His eyes, Sammy—they’re like outer space and I just want to be an astronaut.”
Dean bit his cheek to keep from commenting. If he opened his mouth right now the only thing that was going to come out was an insult. Or worse, the truth.
“But time went on. Sam started to see me. The real me.” Dean started pacing. “That light in his eyes just faded. I was just his stupid brother who was always in a fight, always jumping to do dad’s orders. Sammy started looking at me like he was ashamed, that he couldn’t believe he got saddled with such a fuck up. This is going to be just the same, Cas. Except this time it’ll have pity mixed in there. I can’t do that, Cas. I
“What?” she asked, brushing some of her hair behind an ear as if it had impaired her hearing. “No, no! Stare on! If he ever noticed, he’d like it. I promise.”
Cas loved his brother, truly, he did, but sometimes he wanted to strangle him. Gabe had pestered him most of his life to ‘be more normal’ and ‘get out more’ and now that Cas had finally taken his advice? Nothing but disapproval. Well, it was lucky that Cas couldn’t care less whether or not Gabe approved of his life choices because they were
“It wasn’t high schoolers, mom!” Sam shouted, ignoring Dean’s question completely. “It was real, I swear!”
“Just trying to keep things light,” Dean told her as Cas took the lead by half a step so that he could shine the light for Dean.
Dean tightened the arm he had around Cas. “Sorry.” He gave him another kiss on the side of his head. “You saved me, babe. You don’t have to think about any what ifs.”
“Hey, I’m pretty sure those extra lyrics were all your brother. I don’t even think Sam knew half of what they were singing about.” His cheeks turned pink. “
Dean and Cas, on the other hand, were lying on the white sand, listening to the ebb and flow of the water licking at their feet and staring up at the explosion of stars in the sky. Well, they were pretending to look up at the sky, they both kept getting distracted by the sight of the other.
Sam tried to convey with a look how sorry he was, how terribly, horribly, absolutely sorry he was for ever thinking that this prank wouldn’t backfire on him.
Cas and Dean stumbled into the kitchen about twenty minutes later, giggling and still groping each other. Sam immediately averted his eyes and cleared his throat loudly.
“So you never get tired of living the same day?” Dean asked Cas. The two of them were sitting on the couch watching a Doctor Sexy marathon at Dean’s insistence that Cas needed to watch the show that first made him question his own sexuality. Cas didn’t have the heart to tell him that he’d seen all of these episodes before. It was the twenty-sixth time Dean had fallen in love with him, after all. “I mean, Bill Murray started going crazy in Groundhog’s Day.”
“Right,” Dean shook his head a bit and took another deep breath before dropping the object onto Cas’ open palm.
“His husband.” Cas slipped back in the room easily enough, having stunned Sam into a momentary daze with the information.
Dean led them far enough away that they wouldn’t be heard, and then found a small patch of trees to hide behind. He was still a ball of anxiety, so Cas smiled at him encouragingly. Cas wanted to know just what this present could be to make Dean so nervous.
“No, no, yeah—I get that—just—“ Dean took a deep breath. “If it’s what you want, then yeah, man. Go for it. It’s not like I can hunt with my brain all scrambled, and there’s no way I’m letting you go on hunts alone.” He paused for a moment and rubbed the back of his neck. “Besides… I guess… I mean… You deserve to get your happy ending, Sammy.” His eyes darted over to Cas and they all knew the ‘like me’ was implied.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Jeez, you been talkin’ to Cas?” he asked. “Because that guy wouldn’t know what a normal workday looked like if it bit him in the ass.”
They did end up having to eat, however. Cas could hardly go between meals without a snack. They were true to their word and didn’t end up ordering takeout, but they did decide that Charlie would never know just how much spaghetti they were able to salvage. So two a.m. found them in their underwear in the kitchen eating spaghetti from a shared bowl and making truly awful Lady and the Tramp jokes. Well, Dean was making the jokes, Cas just tried to keep from smiling and encouraging him.
He was just trying to decide whether he could pass as a Hector when a hand grabbed his shoulder and yanked him around.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said in his deep rumble. “Charlie told me that you had a very boring day filled with paperwork so I figured I would come and distract you for a little.” He held up two brown paper bags. “I brought burgers. And pie, but only for after you’ve finished up.”
“Please, man,” the doctors and nurses would hear him whisper, “you can’t go out like this. Not like this.” Quiet, miserable laughter, and then, “You are going to be fucking pissed if you let this be the end.” A dry sob disguised as a cough. “Just a dumb salt and burn.”
“Uh, sorry, Gabe. Kinda gotta take Cas’ side now,” Dean told him, lifting their clasped hands as if to prove his point.
Dean, who hadn’t even seemed to notice Sam’s outburst, replied, “Yeah. I could just float there forever, you know? At least a couple of years. Like ten. At least.”
“Dean would never hurt me,” Cas practically growled. “I mean, my god, you’ve met him. He’s still Dean.”
He wrenched the door of the impala open and slammed it once he was inside, mad that Dean wasn’t out there to see. He slouched down in his seat.
Cas shrugged and pulled his own burger out of the bag and unwrapping it. “You have a lot of work to get through. I wouldn’t want to distract you for too long.”
And just like that his mood dropped. Would he be absolutely pathetic if he was already thinking about calling Sam? Bobby did say he could use his phone any time. And Sam was probably missing him, too, right? The kid was only seven after all.
Dean snorted. “I wouldn’t dream of it, Cas,” he said. Then, “Wait, why are you assuming you’re going to win this next argument?”
“Yeah, yeah, your love story is real sweet, princess.” There was a distant ringing over the line. “That’s my other line,” Bobby said, “I gotta go. Just called to tell you that you better fix whatever the hell happened and tell your damn brother not to tell your father.”
Cas humphed and crossed his arms tightly across his chest. “I highly doubt that either of you have even read a Jane Austen novel and therefore have nothing with which you can base a comparison.” Then he turned to Dean. “And please, do not refer to me as a baby.”
Dean kept his eyes shut tight and took another breath in before pouring it out. “Okay,” he said, eyes fluttering open. “I’m okay.”
Charlie didn’t reply immediately, and Dean wondered what she was doing. His office didn’t look out into the reception area unless he left his door open, which he never did because he was far too easily distracted by the simplest things when he was attempting paperwork.
Cas just shrugged. “May I go and get the beer now?” he asked. “I promise not to terrify random passerby with my true form and tip hunters off to my whereabouts. Even though doing so is my one true joy in life.”
“Great,” Dean said, pulling him down the now empty hallway. “Let’s go get something to eat, I’m starving. Charlie kept stealing all my fries.”
That’s usually where they stop the story, their audience thoroughly convinced that Dean and Cas were very much in love by that point and not needing to hear any more.
“We don’t talk about that,” Dean cut in, pulling out of Cas’ arms to sit up. “Can you please just drop this? I don’t want to talk about it, alright? Sam is going to leave town and we won’t have to worry about this again. Now drop it so I can go to sleep. I have puny human stamina, remember? I need my four hours.”
Dean snorted. “No. He saw me and came over and gave me a hug and then I sort of, maybe ran away. Oh god,” he said. “I left the groceries there. Fuck.”
“If you don’t want to go, it’s okay,” Cas said. “But we would appreciate you letting us borrow your knife.”
“A nerdy letter opener?” Dean asked as he saw the silver plated, miniaturized replica of Sting from The Hobbit. “Really, Charlie?”
And then it was just the three of them in the living room. Sam stared at the man—Cas—standing in front of him, looking calm as anything about this whole proceeding. As if long lost brothers popped up all the time. As if it wasn’t super weird that Dean was apparently
John turned back towards the medicine cabinet and pulled out some gauze. “Sam, he just snapped my arm.” He paused as he rummaged some more. “Goddammit, don’t you have anything for a brace?”
“Sorry about this, Sammy,” Dean said and elbowed Sam hard enough to send him sprawling. He raised the knife and let his momentum carry him to the monster. “This is for hurting my brother, you sick son of a bitch!” he shouted, bringing his arm back to thrust the blade into the monster, but before he could reach it he was grabbed around the throat by a spindly hand attached to a long, sinewy arm and lifted high off the ground. The knife fell from Dean’s grip as he went to scrabble at the monsters fingers cutting off his airway.
“I wasn’t worried about being there alone,” Cas told her, though they both knew it was a lie. Well, mostly a lie. Castiel didn’t mind being alone, but he had been extremely nervous to be the only student among a dozen unknown adults.
“Alright, alright, I’m sorry.” Dean cast his eyes down to the scratched kitchen table in front of him.
“How did you fall?” Cas asked. He took a quick look around the room to see what Dean could have possibly been attempting to move for and his eyes landed on the crutches. “Dean,” he sighed. “Why didn’t you call me to help you?”
“Thank you,” Cas replied in his graveled tone, sounding more pleased than Sam thought he had any right to be.
Dean took a deep breath, held it for a moment, and let it out in a rush. “Stall,” he said. “I just need a minute. Maybe like ten. I mean, if Charlie and Gilda are still here you can let them off the hook if they want to go. Although, I know Charlie is a little drama voyeur so she’s probably out there making popcorn.”
“Alright, fine,” Charlie huffed. “I suppose that is what a good hostess and gracious winner would do. Sam and Cas can go first while Dean helps me grab some snacks for the poor losers to munch on.”
Dean picked up his bag and slung it over his shoulder. He waited for Bobby to lead the way, but Bobby was too busy staring at him.
Cas walked over as quietly as possible and grabbed it. He began to unzip it before he remembered that he hadn’t brought any work home since he and Dean had finished it all while they waited for Sam to get out of soccer practice.
The voice was horrible, it sounded like sludge and acid and rot, seeping in through their ears and coating their bones.
“I’m sorry,” Bobby said. “Do I need to get my ears checked or did you just tell me that you married a dragon? As in Hogwarts?”
“Uh, yeah, me too,” he lied, having lost the silent but heated fight with Charlie. He trailed Cas to the kitchen, rubbing the back of his neck.
There was another special report on in the morning. This time Jake Talley, eleven years old but looking much older in the school picture they put on the screen.
Muffled voices came from the living room and Dean quickly whipped off the Kiss the Cook apron he had been wearing and chucking it into the pantry before anyone could see.
Cas turned back to Dean. “I’m not saying that you have to believe in monsters,” he continued like they’d never been interrupted in the first place. “Just that you should listen to what Sam has to say before you make up your mind on the matter. It’s weird seeing him like this. Or rather, not seeing him at all.” He cast a glance towards the hall. “Just because he’s your little brother doesn’t mean he’s not our friend, too.”
And if anything, it was nice having some time away from him. Not that Cas wouldn’t be pathetically happy in Dean’s presence for the rest of his existence, but it was nice not having to police his thoughts. And he and Dean hadn’t been away from each other since school started. It was time for a small break.
And then it was their last day of school. The dance would start twenty minutes after the final bell rang. Dean could practically feel the passing of each second in the beating of his heart.
“You’re making the same face that you make when The Roadhouse is having their beer, burger and pie special.”
Sam shook his head. “He’s probably already in the next state over by now. Dean’s never really been one for settling down and actually thinking about things.” Sam ran a hand through his hair. “He’s probably getting into some bar brawl right now. That’s how he likes to deal with things. Can’t really blame him, I mean, he learned that from my dad, too.”
“We’re not going to talk about it,” Dean said, slapping a rather small container of leftovers down in front of her. “And what are you, twelve? Stop spinning around, this is supposed to be a respectable business.”
“See you at break,” Dean said, once they reached Ms. Harvelle’s classroom. He ducked inside after a quick wink that Cas merely shook his head at.
Dean stared as Cas’ bare backside came into view and was quickly obscured by a pair of grey boxer briefs. He must have voiced his annoyance because Cas turned around to smirk at him before grabbing a robe and leaving the room.
“Well that’s what this sexy ass jacket is for,” Dean said, slinging an arm around his shoulders and leading him towards his club once again.
“It could have been worse,” Cas told him. “I believe he was trying to reign himself in, in deference to your brother.”
Dean practically floated into the kitchen, head held high, heart still soaring. He took a seat next to Sam at the table and it was practically a full minute before he realized something was off with his little brother.
But Dean ignored him. “Cas, please,” Dean said. “Please wake up. I need you.” He put a shaking hand on Cas’ cheek. It was still warm, but that might just be the pervasive summer heat. He slid his hand lower until two of his fingers rested on Cas’ pulse point in his throat and held his breath as he waited… and waited… and
Silence fell between them for a few minutes, long enough for Dean to think it was safe to go to sleep.
He curled in on himself tighter. He could feel the button on his jeans digging into his stomach and he welcomed the pain. Anything to take his mind from what had just happened. Anything to distract him from the fact that he allowed his fantasy to bleed through into the real world.
“I heard that,” Charlie said, tugging on some strands of her curly brown hair. The look that passed between them lasted a little too long.
The car ride was quiet but not exactly unpleasant. The radio was turned on low, barely a murmur over the rumble of the engine. But even Dean, self-professed grade A emotionally stunted idiot, could tell that Cas was still off. It wasn’t even that he was mad, Dean was pretty sure that he was mostly forgiven, but without the anger there was just hurt.
“Well then, a dance was a great idea for our first date, wasn’t it?” Cas’ smile was wide and gummy, his eyes bright with mirth.
“Yeah, thanks,” Dean said, opening up the fridge. “I’m in the mood for burgers, what about you guys?”
Dean shrugged even though Bobby couldn’t see it. “I mean, yeah, sometimes it would be hard, you know, but… I dunno, I guess when you can literally feel how much someone else loves you, how much they want you around, how happy they are
Confusion was winning out over the anger on Dean’s face, but Cas knew it was only a matter of time before it turned into bluster so he decided it would be best if he stopped teasing and explained. He sighed and placed a gentle hand on Dean’s stubbled cheek. “A little over a month ago we went on a hunt,” Cas began, and then proceeded to explain Dean’s new condition. He and Sam had perfected the speech and had it down to about three minutes, accounting for Dean’s questions.
.” He said it as if he couldn’t quite understand how Cas wasn’t understanding the hierarchy of the presents.
Dean let out the breath he had been holding and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Thanks, mom.” He tripped over his feet as he backed out of the kitchen.
“It’s barely anything,” Cas said, taking his hand back from where Dean was examining it closely. “I hardly touched the tray.”
A corner of Cas’ mouth turned up in a small smile. “Perhaps it was the opposite. I think I may have approached you much sooner had I known this was mutual.”
Jess set her jaw. “Is there a reservation for a Dean and Cas?” she asked, throwing all her cards on the table and praying, actually praying, that the universe would come through just this once.
“I always look tasty,” Dean replied with a grin, starting the car and pulling back out onto the street.
It was a few hours before Sam finally decided to brave the kitchen once again. Dean and Cas were gone, along with the pie. Sam huffed out a laugh and stepped over to the counter. Okay, maybe the whole pie wasn’t gone. On the counter was a tiny sliver on a plate, placed right next to a dirty mixing bowl and about four smashed egg shells.
“Cas isn’t a monster.” He kept working on the knots, but his dad knew how to make them nearly impossible to undo. He couldn’t believe that he forgot to bring his pocket knife. He managed to barely loosen one of Dean’s arms when he heard shifting wood behind him and then Cas’ panicked voice.
“So, Bobby,” Sam started, popping open the cap to a beer and taking a swig. “How long have you known about Cas?”
Jess patted him on the shoulder. “That’s just a nuance. The anger your feeling towards him, it’s the same anger he felt towards you.”
Cas enjoyed the ride in the Impala very much. Balthazar kept up a running dialogue, inviting the two of them to visit him in England and describing the acts of debauchery they could get up to. But Cas was hardly paying him any attention. Dean was lazily carding the fingers on the hand not steering through his hair, playing with the shorter hairs at the nape of his neck.
“Sam said he stepped off the path before he saw the real monster, right?” Cas asked, moving to the very edge of the path.
Cas held him closer, maneuvering so that he could wrap both arms around him as well as his wings. “If you don’t want to go tomorrow—“
He went crashing down into the wasteland below him, a crater splintering its way into the earth around him. He grunted as he pushed himself up into a sitting position.
They picked up Sam on the way to the abandoned barn. The car ride was silent aside from, or perhaps because of, the music Dean had blaring through the speakers.
Dean looked up from where he had been putting Cas’ biology book back in his locker. “Another prank?”
Cas fidgeted where he stood in front of the flour, egg shell, and apple peel strewn counters. He could see Dean’s eyes rove over it, taking it in and processing. Biting his lip, he waited for Dean to reprimand him for the mess.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “Sam wasn’t acting like he wanted to confront you about it and I thought that perhaps it would be best if we were in a safer place. I didn’t want your father to come back while you two had it out.”
Cas ran a hand through Dean’s hair and sighed. “He’s been taking classes at a community college. He’s thinking about applying to KU.”
“He…” Dean took a deep breath. “He kept talking about the monster. The monster in the woods.” He saw the detectives share a short, but exasperated look. “I know, I know it sounds crazy,” he continued quickly. “But it’s what he thought it was. The thing that’s been taking his friends. And… and I don’t know what else it could be. It—it makes sense, if you think about it. It all—everything adds up,” he tried to insist but he could see that they didn’t believe him. He wanted to rail against them, rage and yell and shout that they were being so stupid, so close minded. “Just look in the woods,” Dean told them. “If Sam ran away, that’s where he would have gone.”
“You think I wasn’t your age once?” she asked with a wistful look that made Dean feel a little nauseous.
The next day when Cas arrived to school in Dean’s letterman jacket, everyone knew it was official. At lunch, Dean made sure there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that the two of them weren’t completely, one hundred percent official by tugging him onto his lap and moaning obscenely as he laid a sloppy, wet kiss on Cas’ lips.
“Please, stop!” Sam pressed his hands over his ears. Dean and Cas just smirked at each other. Once Sam was sure that they were done, he lowered his hands.
Dean smiled as he watched it for a little bit. “This is stupid,” he mumbled, “but uh, maybe if you are actually in the business of granting wishes…” He blushed as he trailed off, still staring at that same star. He thought of Sam, happily chatting away on the phone to his new girlfriend, of his best friend who already had plans with her girlfriend when he asked if she was free. But it was fine. He got it, he did. New relationships were exciting and fun and definitely more appealing than spending time with someone you’ve known since you were in diapers. It’s not like Dean turned down spring break in Cancun with his fraternity brothers to go on this camping trip or anything.
Still feeling buoyed by the success of Sam and Cas’ interactions, Dean said, “Sure thing, man. We just took some vacation time to go on the hunt, but maybe in a few weeks or so. It just depends on how busy I get at the shop.”
The phone rang then, and perhaps Dean should have seen it as an omen, but he ignored it and went about cleaning up the plates from Cas and Sam’s late breakfast.
Wings spread out on either side of Dean like some golden eagle. It was almost painful to look directly at them, they were so bright. Cas hadn’t tried to put much effort into how the wings would look when he manifested them, but it made sense that their beauty would be befitting of Dean’s own.
together, but like next door neighbors together and it all could have happened except he turned down the perfectly nice stranger sitting next to him and there was no possible way to salvage this situation because now Dean was crying
Dean stayed behind for a minute to cut some chunks of parmesan cheese to grate over their meals when the doorbell rang.
Crossing his arms in aggravation at being bossed around in his own home, he followed his father. “I’m not helping you,” he said. “You are being paranoid and I’m not about to mess up Dean’s life because of it. You’ve done enough damage to him. Just leave him alone.”
He came within earshot just in time to hear her say, “So how did he finally ask? He’s been so annoying trying to figure out the perfect way to do it! Even though I told him, dude, you just gotta do it, he’s totally going to say yes! And I was obviously, totally right since you two are going to the dance now!”
“Dean,” Cas replied with a smile of his own and stepped aside to let him in. “Charlie and Jo aren’t coming until later, right?”
Contrary to what Sam had declared, Dean greatly enjoyed what he had started. The following week was filled with dungbombs, jelly leg jinxes, and one particularly nasty hex that turned Cas green for four hours (neither brother was willing to claim ownership over that particular prank).
“Please,” Castiel said. “Please don’t…” He put a hand out and attempted to comfort the man physically, but the man flinched away so hard he nearly fell off of his stool. Castiel immediately put his hands up in surrender. “I’m sorry,” he said immediately. “I didn’t mean to do anything to make you uncomfortable.”
Dean’s eyes snapped to Cas’, all nerves forgotten. “Cas, you turd!” Dean shouted, flicking him in the arm. “You’re ruining my romantic gesture!”
“So you’re willing to uproot your entire life—a life we have fought hard for—just to avoid talking to your brother. Whom you love. And with whom you’re trying to rebuild a relationship.” He cocked his head to the side. “Am I getting this right?”
Sam’s head was still pounding, and it only fueled his anger. Which is probably why, without thinking through how he really wanted to approach the situation, he said, “I know what you did to him.”
Dean scrubbed a hand over his face and let out the breath he’d been unconsciously holding. His stomach gave a loud rumble and he figured he should probably go and eat. He could come back and read the journal later… Maybe just one more.
“Thanks, Cas,” Sam sighed. Then he turned to glare at Dean. “I’ll get you back for this. I don’t think you’re going to like what you’ve started.”
Charlie peeked over her laptop and saw Dean peering intently at his own. She could only see the Rebel Alliance sticker adorning the front of his computer and not his actual screen, but she knew exactly what he was looking at. “Are you on Cas’ blog again?”
“I’m aware.” Cas kept his eyes glued to his script, even though Dean’s hands were back to their wandering ways.
“Don’t mind me,” he told Cas. “But don’t beat him up too much. He was doing a pretty big spell, but I was supervising.” He grabbed a pen. “It is interesting that you felt it from that far. What did it feel like?”
Dean ran a hand through the back of his hair and let out one last laugh. “Guess not. Maybe we can just wait for a slow song. All you’ve gotta do to those is just, like, sort of hug and sway to the music.”
“Hurry, Sam, we’re going to get left behind!” Ava Wilson huffed and hurried to catch up with the rest of their classmates.
“I told him not to come,” Bobby continued, and Dean still only heard it faintly. “But that idjit won’t listen. Says he’s had a breakthrough in your mother’s case and needs my help.”
Dean quickly wiped away the lone tear that had managed to escape from his eyes and cleared his throat as if someone was there to judge him for getting choked up. Deciding the rest of the passage could wait, he took a couple of deep breaths to finish composing himself. His stomach was still rumbling so he quickly threw on a pair of sweat pants and made his way to the kitchen.
Cas decided to take that moment to stumble his way into the kitchen. Sam looked over to wish him a good morning but cut himself off when he saw what he was wearing. A forest green sweater with a giant cartoon reindeer topped off with a glowing red nose. He looked back to Dean who was staring a little too fondly at the former angel.
Dean nodded. "He was flipping out, mom. Crying and shaking. I mean, I guess I'd be freaked too if I woke up and was trying to run away. But he was..."
“Dean,” Cas responded, his voice lower and more gravely than normal. And boy did Dean have mixed feelings about that. “Did you not hear me calling to you?”
Cas managed a nod so Dean just grinned and gave him a quick peck on the lips. “Eggs and bacon okay?” he asked, standing up and walking around the kitchen as if it were his own, grabbing the necessary ingredients and utensils. Cas grunted in the affirmative and fifteen minutes later Dean was plopping a plate overflowing with food down in front of him.
Dean pursed his lips in thought before blowing out a breath between them. “I guess that is kind of a weird question.” He turned his marshmallow over and warned Cas to do the same. “What’s your favorite thing to do, then?”
“I’m not ‘taking up’ baking,” Cas said, the air quotes apparent in his tone even though he managed to refrain from bringing his hands up. “I simply wanted to do something nice for you.”
So by the time Sunday rolled around he was both desperate for and absolutely dreading the hour of Balthazar’s departure back to England.
Cas nodded again and stepped even closer to Dean deliberately. There was hardly any space between them. Dean was sure that if they attended Catholic school instead of an underfunded public school there would be a nun yelling at them to keep room for Jesus between them.
With a sigh, Dean looked at all of the papers strewn over his desk. He pushed the intercom button again. “Do you think you could order me some lunch while you’re at it?” he asked.
.” He stopped and turned to face Cas. “Let’s move. Go somewhere no one knows us. Europe!” he declared. “I don’t know anyone in Europe. It’s perfect. And I fucking love Italian food. We could just spend the rest of our lives eating pizza and living on some private beach.” He paused and grinned. “Better idea: private island. We won’t even have to deal with other people because we’ll be the only ones there. I’m a genius.”
Cas sighed and kissed Dean’s temple. “I don’t know, my love. If you think you can handle it, then honestly, I think you should speak to him,” Cas told him. “Maybe not today, but soon.” He shrugged. “That’s my opinion, anyway. I think you have some questions that were never answered. And from Sam’s reaction, I think he feels the same way. I know you say you’re fine that way, but…” He sighed and hugged Dean closer to himself. “But whatever your decision, I will stand by you. If you need me to get everyone out of the house, I can be quite intimidating. Maybe I’ll even show them my—“
Dean let out a sigh and let himself relax into Cas’ arms. “It’s just… I put all of this behind me, you know? It took a damn long time, but I did it. It was like, I dunno, like I was free or something. I mean, yeah, sometimes I had a relapse or something when someone came at me too fast or raised their voice too loud, but that had almost completely stopped. But now my dad is back. And he’s going to try and kill us.”
He looked up from his book with an expression that he hoped conveyed emotionless curiosity instead of the dread he felt in the pit of his stomach. “Yes?”
The fury melted out of Cas and he began walking towards Dean, expression lightening with each step he took. He didn’t manage to take many, however, before he roared and fell to his knees.
She looked down at her hands. “Must’ve dropped it,” she said and then her face drained of color. “Shit!”
“Sure thing, Dean-o. Just remember us little people when you’re making out with your dreamy new boyfriend. Well, maybe not
Dean shivered. That voice sent a chill down his spine and put ice in his veins. Was it possible to sound cold? Like scratching at the thin icy covering of a lake in the dead of winter.
But Dean ignored her, throwing a quick goodbye to his teacher as he pulled a perfectly willing Cas along behind him. He didn’t stop until he made it to the boy’s locker room, knowing it would be empty since their entire day was being spent signing yearbooks and not running the mile.
Dean grunted in response and squeezed Cas’ hand. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before letting it out slowly. “’M fine.”
“Ah, Mr. Winchester, you’re awake.” He was fairly certain that sexy, gravelly voices also weren’t a normal soundtrack to the peaceful outdoors.
Dean saw Cas standing in front of their shared first period class. He hitched his backpack up higher on his shoulders and let out a sigh.
Cas finally looked up at Dean. “I thought that maybe I had lucked out and accidentally managed to ask you to the dance without realizing it. Which was great because I was trying to figure out how I was going to ask you anyway, and…” He looked down again. “And then you looked utterly confused when I told Meg and I realized—“
Charlie held Jo back until it was clear Dean wasn’t going to be asking any questions. Dean ignored Charlie’s look of disappointment. It was pretty easy to do with Cas smiling at him like he was.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, Bobby, I know. I laid out the silverware, had iron on hand. I have it covered. I’m retired, not stupid.”
Cas started keeping his wings out at home as long as no one was over. Dean had forgotten how much he missed being wrapped in them on cold nights. They were leathery, but soft to the touch and Dean was finding it more and more difficult to get out of bed to go to work in the mornings. Especially when Cas didn’t want to let him.
“I feel like I’m missing something,” Sam said, looking back and forth from Dean and Cas. “I mean, Cas’ idea sounds pretty good to me. He knows tons of lore. He probably could help dad.”
“I think so,” Dean said. He put his hands on Cas’ hips, pulling him forward slightly as Cas slid his own arms around Dean’s shoulders. “Is this okay?” Dean asked softly.
It became a thing. They never talked about it in person, but their notes to each other had definitely become… flirtatious.
“No.” Sam tried pushing them back and closing the door on him, but then John walked forward. Sam saw the exact moment Dean noticed, his eyes shuttering and his posture straightening like he was in the presence of a superior commander.
Dean had shared with Sam everything they had learned at the library. It had seemed to brighten his mood, enough for him to smile even, but that had been before Andy. And now Sam was just… there. Going through the motions without really seeming like he was present. It was disconcerting to say the least.
“You didn’t think to mention during the planning portion of our evening that you are afraid of flying?” Cas wanted to cross his arms, but he was still helping support Dean by the grip he had on his hand.
The next morning (more like early afternoon), Dean and Sam made their way to the living room to tell their mom about the events of last night but stopped short as the local newscast she was watching caught their attention.
Dean shifted in embarrassment. Of course this dude was like the nicest, most conscientious guy ever. “S’alright,” he slurred. “S’okay.”
“May I buy you a drink?” he finally asked, his voice even lower than its usual timber from his nerves.
“Oh, I plan on it,” Gilda said with another lingering look towards Charlie. “And it was great meeting you guys, too. Charlie talks a lot, and at least twenty percent was about you two.”
“Yeah.” Gabe allowed them a moment to bask in the sincere moment, then added. “You two’ll be bangin’ by week’s end.”
Once Dean was sure that Gabriel had gone to his room, he pulled Cas’ hands from his face. “You can come out now,” he said.
“An angel huh? You like being with other angels, don’t you?” Cas’ fear is replaced with anger at the derision in Dean’s voice. He sets a hand on Dean’s chest and tries to push him away. He’s too weak to move him at all.
“Too deep, huh?” On the next thrust, the machine pushes in more shallowly. “We’ll work up to it.” There’s still a twinge of pain as the dildo hits deeper than is comfortable, but Cas relaxes a bit. He’s relieved that Dean listened to his plea, he’d half expected him to just laugh. Or even set the machine to push deeper.
He loved you. He did.” Dean’s voice is thick, Cas forces his gaze up and realizes there are tears in Dean’s eyes. Suddenly he isn’t sure that Dean is
Heat flows through Cas. Mostly embarrassment, but he can’t deny the stab of arousal he feels at the implication in Dean’s words. He nods meekly, he knows he has to obey. He slips out from under the covers and starts to enter the bathroom.
“Open up, angel.” Dean pulls the knife back and waits. A grin spreads across his face as Cas’ mouth slowly falls open. He’s clearly afraid and it only serves to rile Dean up more. His fear is adorable and undeniably arousing. He slides the blade in, flat against his angel’s tongue. The sight of it disappearing into his wet, open mouth sends a shiver up pleasure up Dean’s spine. He slowly slides it out, taking in the sight of it gleaming with Cas’ saliva. As he looks at the expanse of beautiful skin laid out for him, his previous threat pops back into his head. It’s too intoxicating of an idea to let go of.
“That’s real nice. Now lick it. Nice and slow.” Cas complies almost instantly this time, the orders are starting to feel more natural to him. He slides his tongue from root to tip. Tasting Dean like this makes his mind go fuzzy with pleasure despite the rest of the situation. How long had he dreamt of this?
Dean slips away from him for a moment so he can push him onto his back. Cas doesn’t contend the manhandling, just falls into position. Dean pulls Cas’ pants and underwear completely off, but only slides his own down his thighs. He straddles Cas’ legs so he can wrap his hand around them both. The dry friction makes Cas wince. Dean laughs, lighthearted in a way that makes Cas smile despite the ever-present unpleasantness of his situation, and grabs a tube of lube from the bedside table. He slicks up their cocks and sets a quick, rough pace. It’s a little much for Cas, almost painful, but he doesn’t complain. He just watches the way Dean’s head tilts back in pleasure. He can tell that Dean enjoys the slight pain and files the information away for later.
Every ounce of Cas’ blood runs cold as he registers the sound of a pocket knife flicking open. He’s instantly struggling against Dean’s grip on him, but his current form has no chance against a brawny hunter. Dean’s arm locks down over his own, keeping them pinned to his sides.
Dean’s silent throughout the first few minutes of the drive. Cas tries to speak several times, but Dean just shushes him every time. Cas glances at the door handle. While he doesn’t really
Dean groans appreciatively. “That’s real nice, babe. Been waiting forever for this.” He steps forward and runs a single finger down Cas’ chest. He veers to the side to pinch a nipple and chuckles at Cas’ flinch. He runs his hand around until it rests on his lower back and uses it for leverage to pull Cas in and peck him on the lips.
“Dean...” The name slips out of his mouth, he’s not sure why he’s even calling out to him, but it feels
Crowley sits on the edge of the bed near Dean’s chair. He rifles through the bedside table and tosses a particularly large tube of lube by Cas’ legs.
“Now look what you’ve done.” Dean calls out from his chair. It gives Cas a spark of hope that Dean might actually defend him, but the sound of a zipper opening dashes it. Crowley rolls his eyes and leans down into Cas’ space. He slowly licks up a tear track on Cas’ cheek. Cas gasps, tries to pull away, but Crowley grips his chin and licks up his other cheek. Cas gapes up at him, his face wet with saliva and red from humiliation. Crowley’s sneer sends a jolts of anger through him, but it tapers off into acceptance as he reminds himself of the deal.
. He can feel Dean’s erection pressing against his through layers of fabric. He can’t dispel the thought of what it would feel like if they were both naked. The thought of their bodies intertwining is an old one, as well as a shameful one.
.” He reaches out and tugs on the sleeve of Cas’ trench coat. “And I’m gonna need you to hand this stuff over. You’ll be wearing what I tell you, when I tell you for the next week.” Cas nods and starts to step into the bathroom. Dean’s hand clamps down onto his forearm.
“Do you...” Cas shuts his mouth hard enough that his teeth ache. The question sits heavy on his tongue. Surprisingly, Dean stills and lets him think. “Did... you have... feelings for me as a human? I mean, more than lust-”
Cas stares up at him with shock. He’d never acted like this towards him before. “A friend... An angel.” He resists the urge to cower under Dean’s intense gaze.
Dean’s grinding shifts into short, sharp thrusts that make Cas’ head swim. His entire body jolts with each thrust, but Dean’s arm wrapped around his chest keeps him in place. His arms are pinned, trapped, and it only turns him on more. His face aches from the pressure of Dean’s hand, but he doesn’t mind. He can’t bring himself to mind
“Fun? Sam and Hannah need me to-” Dean advances on him so quickly that his heart skips a beat. Before he can react, Dean slams him up against the wall, making paintings rattle.
“Dean?!” The feeling of cold metal against his cheek quiets him. It’s not the edge, but the threat is still clear. “Dean, what are you doing?” He’s surprised by how soft and scared his own voice sounds.
“May I touch you, Dean?” Cas stares up at the table. He’s once again grateful for the barrier. “Please?” He’s found that a please always helps with humans. He flinches as he reminds himself that that’s not what Dean is anymore. It’s still so painful to remember.
“Please, Dean, please!” The tears spill over. Cas’ desperate at this point, his shame transformed into need. “Please, Crowley.” He looks at both of them with wet, begging eyes. Dean and Crowley look at each other and come to a silent agreement. Dean grips Cas cock tight and begins a fast, hard pace. The dual stimulation of their hands inside and out has Cas writhing on the bed, whimpering out their names.
, if it means getting Dean back. He starts the shower and steps in. It’s clean and stocked with the basics. He scrubs himself down and makes sure that everywhere is as clean as it can be. Once he’s out and dried off, he starts dressing in the familiar clothes. He idly wonders why Dean didn’t include one of his signature flannels with the outfit.
Dean’s eyes dart to the chair beside the bed. Suddenly, he looks so sad that Cas can barely stand to look at him. He pulls his hand back and wipes it on the bedsheets, uncaring of the mess. Dean laughs, low and soft, and for a moment Cas is sure he’d slipped back into his callous, demonic headspace.
Cas gapes at him. What kind of question is that? He considers what kind of response he could give when all his thoughts are knocked from his head by Dean pressing a forceful kiss to his lips.
Cas slips his pinky in. The stretch stings, but he pushes past it. Dean wolf whistles from his seat, Crowley murmurs something that Cas doesn’t quite catch. Cas shoves his fingers a little deeper. The feeling of four fingers up to the final knuckle is uncomfortable, slightly painful, but he feels that now familiar stir in his groin.
“Well that’s too bad,” He leans in and lick a line up Cas’ thigh. “’Cuz I do.” He pulls his fingers free with a slick noise that makes Cas cringe. “And you’re gonna
sounds, today’s not the day for that.” Crowley forces Cas to shake his head by his grip on his chin. The tears suddenly spill over.
Cas suddenly realizes that both men are looking down at him expectantly. Crowley’s hand stills and Cas lets out a soft whine before he can think better of it.
“How’s it feel, angel?” Dean’s fingers slide completely into him, forcing a small sound from his mouth.
“Dean- stop!” In any other situation, he would have given himself over to Dean without question. But in this one? While Dean isn’t
“Haven’t even taught him how to properly strip, huh?” Crowley throws the jab at Dean without so much as looking at Cas. Dean simply flips him off from his seat. Crowley pulls Cas to him by a finger hooked in his belt loop. “Seems to me that you need a lot more training.” He pops Cas’ jean’s button open. “Good thing I’m here, eh?” While one of his hands pulls the zipper down, his other slides around to fondle Cas’ ass. His mouth twists into a cruel grin. “I’m going to teach you a lot.”
Cas considers it. He imagines Crowley shoving his hand into him, pushing him far past what he considers to be his limit. He doesn’t doubt that it’ll be cruel, unrelenting, forcing him open without remorse. Not to mention the humiliation of such a filthy act. He pictures Crowley and Dean’s smug, self-satisfied faces hanging over him as he’s fucked with his enemy’s fist. For just a moment, he considers giving up. Leaving Dean to Crowley and abandoning his mission. But Dean’s, the
Without another word, Dean strides out the front door. Cas listens to Baby peel out as he pulls a blanket over himself, too worn out to bother showering before sleeping. With a promise to himself that he’ll do it before morning, he slips off.
Cas sucks in a sharp breath before falling over the edge. He cries out, voice uncharacteristically high. The men’s hands on and in him don’t slow, they keep him going until he’s shoving weakly at them, desperate for the overstimulation to stop. Dean releases his spent cock with a smile and nods at Crowley.
“I am somewhat fatigued.” He sways as he stands from the chair. Dean’s hands shoot out to steady him. He shudders as he remembers his dream, he knows who’s hands they were. “But I’m alright.”
Dean grabs the shorn edges of the shirt and easily tears it fully open. He uses the knife on the sleeves and lets the ruined shirt fall off of Cas. He yanks the fabric out from under him and tosses it aside. He pauses the take in the sight.
“I think puppy needs a little behavior training.” He grabs Cas’ hand and places the lube in it. “How about you get yourself nice and stretched for me, hm?” Cas nods, cowed by Crowley’s show of force. He can tell that his neck will ache later. He slicks up his fingers and spreads his legs. To his embarrassment, both men watch closely as he inserts the first finger with a hiss. Crowley’s eyes roam over his ass and hand as he works, but Dean’s stay glued to his face.
“But the mess,” Cas trailed off, peeking behind himself to see if it had vanished without his notice.
Cas covered up his laugh with a fake cough. He always brought out Jo’s full name any time she’d actually struck a nerve.
Dean laughed and pushed Cas towards the door, needing him to leave before he lost it. He could bury it, he was going to bury it, he was going to be a good friend. But he could feel tears threatening to sting his eyes and he needed Cas gone before they made their grand entrance.
Dean’s face fell. “Oh, uh, yeah. Good thinking. I’m sweating my ass off out here.” He shot Cas a quick grin.
Cas closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Is this really why you called me out here?”
Cas grinned as he looked from one to the other, both racing towards him on a mixture of feet, clawed paws, and talons. He raised his hands and vines shot out of the ground, wrapping themselves around both his adversaries and crushing them into the ground.
“Jo’s here,” Charlie announced, plopping herself down next to Dean and jostling him over a couple of inches to get him closer to Cas.
Dean panicked the entire way home that night, knowing that he had promised he and Cas would visit Bobby eventually, but definitely not expecting it to be
“Yes, tonight, Castiel,” his mother replied, her usual brusque manner back in place. “My flight is at six a.m. tomorrow.”
Dean groaned. “Please, Cas? I’ll do anything.” He snuck a hand under Cas’ shirt and leaned in close to whisper again, “
John noticed a moment too late, shouting at Charlie just as Cas felt the barrier fall away and grinned as he spread his wings to their full length before launching himself straight at John.
“I know,” Dean replied. “But do you have any idea how hard it is to plan surprises for someone that can read your mind at any given second? I’ve been staying up late each night to work on it because our beds are barely far apart enough that we can’t read each other.”
“You don’t let things go, Sam. What are you trying to do? Reverse psychology isn’t going to work on me.”
It felt like a blow to Dean’s gut. “Right. Because this time you’re just leaving to get away from me. I’m probably the biggest mistake of all, huh? Bet you wish you’d never pulled me out of he—mmph!”
“And well, I was just thinking, hoping really, that my amazing, fantastic, absolutely wonderful boyfriend and love of my life would do one teensy, tiny little thing for me.” He nipped at Cas’ earlobe.
“Thanks,” Dean said. “Oh, and if you come across the stuff about the virgins, it’s not true. Cas had this one cousin.”
Cas’ jaw dropped and he let out an involuntary gasp when he saw what was in the margins. It looked just like his textbook, except for the fact that his loopy cursive was absent, Dean’s untidy scrawl covering every blank inch.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Because,” he said. “I refuse to go one more day without you watching Indiana Jones.” He waved the three DVD cases in Cas’ face before plopping down on the couch. “Sammy’s getting the snacks,
“Yeah, well I figured if I was going to try and ask, it was going to take me a pretty long time to work my way up to it.”
“Get ready for this Liz Lemon eye roll,” Charlie said, and then with the utmost exaggeration, she rolled her eyes. “Go ask him out, dummy.”
Bobby snorted as he turned and led the three of them further into his house. “I only have the one spare room, so I’m guessing Sam is going to have to take the couch.”
“Hey guys,” Dean said, loud enough to be heard over the music, wiping his sweaty palms off on his jeans.
“What the hell are you guys doing in here?” Dean asked, stomping his way into the kitchen. “Just raiding my fridge without so much as a hello?”
“I don’t want to start another fight, alright? I want,” he sighed. “I want this to work. But man, I can’t talk about shit with dad, okay? I
He debated for a moment between walking through the trees to look for his adversary or flying above them again to aid in his search. The tree cover was a little thick to see movement on the ground to be honest, but Cas couldn’t deny that he was not looking forward to walking through those trees alone. Dean was supposed to be here. He was supposed to be helping. But of course, Cas got his hopes up just to have them dashed. This was just like that time Gabriel had thought he had finally figured out how their dad had transferred possession of his adversary, but to no avail. It’s never to any avail.
Dean tried to stop himself, his momentum carrying him just to the edge of the crater, his shoes slipping across the dirt and forest debris. His arms pin wheeled at his sides as he tried to regain his balance, his toes peeking over the edge, but he managed to stabilize himself.
He watched in terrified fascination as the star fell right out of the sky, streaking through the speckled darkness. It crashed into the woods next to him, but not before nearly giving him a heart attack since up close they apparently look like giant, biblical balls of fire come to wipe out entire cities.
“You can call me a prude all you want, Dean, but I do not want to hear what type of sex my brother and my best friend are having behind closed doors. I hear too much as it is.”
Dean sighed and pulled Cas closer with the grip on his wrist and rested their foreheads together. “I do miss them when they’re hidden,” he said softly, reaching out and running a hand up the leathery skin on one wing and trailing it along the deep blue scales at the top. “I know I’m being paranoid about all of this.”
Cas shook his head. “Let’s just go get your brother,” he said and grabbed Dean by the arm and dragged him down the hall.
“What?” she asked. “What do you mean Sam is gone?” She moved past him to check Sam’s room, only to see the same emptiness Dean had.
“Shit, no wonder I’m getting pudgy if all we do all day is watch television.” Dean poked his stomach morosely.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Alright, I’ll make the call. But,” he said, leaving Dean to put the rest of their rather large haul away, “you have to make dinner tomorrow for Charlie and everyone.”
“I don’t know,” Sam said, making his way towards the door, pulling Jess along with him. “I must have gone temporarily insane, thanks for helping me realize what a huge mistake I was making.”
Cas handed Dean a mug of coffee and said, “This is the sixth day we’ve been together. I promised Dean that I wouldn’t let him forget about it.” He took a sip from his own cup and looked over at Sam.
“I sort of promised Bobby we would visit him this weekend,” he said quickly, flinching away in preparation for Cas’ reaction.
“Do I look as badass as you?” Dean asked eagerly, wings quivering behind him. He turned his head to look at them as they instinctively curled forward so Dean could get a better look at them. He let out a low whistle. “Damn,” he said. “Not as cool looking as yours, but I’ll sure as hell take ‘em!” He twisted his wings every which way, getting a feel for them, before turning back to look at Cas. “Alright, Obi-Wan, teach me how these guys work.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck and averted his eyes. “Maybe, uh… Maybe we could hang out sometime?”
“Fine,” Dean said. “But we are going to stay in a really fancy hotel. And I’m raiding the mini bar.”
“Cas has never lost a game,” Dean said proudly, throwing an arm around his shoulder and hugging him to his side. “My little strategist.”
“Sam,” Cas said. “If you cannot sit in silence then I’m going to have to ask you to leave the room.”
“Apologies, Sam,” Cas said into the phone. "Your brother is being ridiculous. Is your father still there?” A short pause as he danced out of Dean’s reach. “Will you be able to meet us without him following you?” A longer pause. “Okay, good. We’ll meet you at our house in an hour.” He threw the phone back to Dean after he ended the call.
“Yeah. You’re damn right.” Dean slides his hand down Cas’ thigh until his fingers are pressing in with Crowley’s. “He’s amazing like this, didn’t I tell you?”
“We both know damn well that you want me.” He leans in and licks a stripe up his cheek. Cas tries to pull away, but Dean grabs his chin and holds his head close. He whispers directly into his ear, “And I want you too.” Cas shivers as his breath washes over his ear. “So I’m going to have you.”
Cas goes limp into the bed. He pulls his fingers loose with a slick sound and lets his legs fall wider open in submission. Crowley’s eyebrows raise, but he doesn’t say a word. Crowley’s hand trails up his bare thigh. Cas hears the lube being opened. He clenches his eyes shut and awaits the sensation of Crowley’s hand forcing it’s way inside him. He tries to keep his body relaxed as Crowley’s fingers brush against his loose hole.
“Admit it, pet. You love getting stuffed.” Crowley’s words should feel like an accusation to him, but they settle beneath his skin like they were meant to be there. He can’t deny it, not even to himself. Having Crowley play with him like this,
“Fine... thank you.” Cas is surprised by how kind Dean is being. His whole attitude seems different today. “So, what happens now?” Dean’s smile stretches wider.
Dean winks playfully. “Good doing business with you.” Cas huffs in annoyance, which just makes Dean laugh. “Kidding, kidding. Now, it’s getting late, huh? I figure we should start tomorrow.”
Dean’s voice sends him spiraling over the edge. His voice cracks on a sharp cry, his legs shake in their bonds. As he comes down, he tiredly pushes his head up and sees Dean jerking himself quick and harsh. Dean takes a moment to find the off button on the remote before rounding the bed. He kneels on the edge, his cock hanging over Cas’ face. He stares down at him as he strokes himself, his eyes focused on Cas’ flushed face.
demonstration!” Dean carefully positions the table and locks the wheels. Cas’ view of what he’s doing is blocked by his back as he rifles through one of the drawers across the room. Dean hems and haws as he picks things up and considers them. After what feels like hours, but Cas knows couldn’t have been more than a minute, he presents his chosen object to Cas. Cas’ confusion grows momentarily as he examines the average-sized black dildo. As Dean returns to the machine, the realization of what it must do strikes him.
, angel.” Dean’s hips rub hard against him. Cas holds back a whimper as Dean’s hand tightens on his growing erection. “Mmm, we’re gonna get off real quick, nice and simple. We’ll get to the interesting shit when I’m actually awake.” Dean’s promise sends a small shock of anxiety into Cas’ heart, but it’s quickly overwhelmed by the warm pleasure in his gut.
“Such a slut for it.” Dean’s voice is husky against his ear. His hot, damp breath spreads over his skin. He pull his hand away so he can spit in it. He uses it to slick Cas’ cock up before taking it in hand again. “You’re gonna let me do whatever the hell I want to you. How fucking lucky can I get?” His grip tightens and speeds up. Cas wriggles in his arms, subconsciously trying to escape the overwhelming stimulation. Dean growls against his neck, “Stay
It’s painful enough that Cas considers asking him to stop, but their deal makes him hold back. He nearly goes soft, but Dean pulls his mouth away and murmurs, “You’re gonna cum like this, whether you want to or not.” and presses a gentle kiss to the bitemark. “We’ve got all day.” Cas can feel his mouth twisting into a smile against his aching skin.
Cas’ hands still on his top shirt button. He takes a moment to take a deep breath and steel himself before slowly working his way thought the buttons, letting the shirt fall open bit by bit. He can feel Dean’s eyes working their way down his exposed chest and stomach. Dean’s attention feels like it’s branding his skin, his catcalls deafeningly loud. He sheds his shirt and reaches for his pants button.
“If you say so.” He pulls out, making Cas whimper. He roughly flips Cas over and shoves his legs apart. He takes a moment to re-lube before shoving in, easing Cas’ struggle. His hands hold Cas’ thighs open wide as he fucks him. The new position and slickness leaves Cas grasping at the sheets. Dean’s thrusts are faster and deeper, quickly bringing Cas to the point of begging.
His cock jumps. He’s a little surprised by the way Dean’s threat makes his arousal burn through him, but he’s finding that he’s a lot more masochistic than he’d previously imagined.
.” He draws the word out, how you’d speak to a young child. Cas pushes down his annoyance and focuses on letting him in. Crowley’s hand inches in farther and farther until his knuckles pop in. Cas gasps. It only hurts a little, but the sensation of it rattles him. He vaguely notices Crowley exchanging a look with a still-stern Dean.
“Mhm.” Crowley doesn’t spare him a glance. He seems just as captivated as Dean now. Relaxed, now that Cas’ taking it without struggle. He can shrug off Dean’s watchful gaze and enjoy himself like he’d intended to do in the first place. He carefully moves his fingers into a proper fist, drinks in Cas’ little whimpers.
“It... hurts, a bit. I’m alright.” Cas pulls at his bonds without thinking. They prove to be much stronger than him in his current form.
. it’s the idea of him bringing other people here. Cas flops back on the bed, the exhaustion of the bizarre day suddenly sinking in. He toes his shoes off and doesn’t even bother to take his trench coat off before slipping into a fitful sleep.
Cas reaches out and grasps his hand. After one more moment of hesitation, he gives a firm handshake. He won’t, no he
“Oh, and don’t bother getting dressed.” Dean’s order only mildly surprises him, he’s obviously wants to get all he can out of their deal. It’s a little frightening... but also flattering. Cas shakes the thought from his head. Dean’s sitting on the edge of the bed by the time he leaves the bathroom. He resists the urge to try to hide his body, he’s not ashamed of his nudity, but the hungry way Dean’s looking at him makes him nervous. Dean calls him over with a crook of his finger. Once he’s standing between his spread knees, Dean runs his hands up his stomach, taking a moments to tweak his nipples. Dean doesn’t miss the way Cas’ breath catches, he winks up at him. “We’re gonna get into some heavier stuff today. Got something real fun planned for you. Get on the bed. On your back.”
, and you won’t get hurt.” He slides the knife down to Cas throat. He keeps it flat against his skin, lessening the chance of accidentally cutting him. “But if you fight me, I might have to punish you. With how you are right now, even just a few nicks would do the trick.” His voice drops low. “Or maybe I could carve my name. I’d like that, my name in your skin.
His fingers are just barely touching him, but it makes Cas’ blood run hot and fast in his veins. He’s imagined it so, so many times, and the reality is even better. He wonders how amazing it’d be if the situation was different. He pushes the though from his head, right now he needs to focus on doing what he’s asked. Dean slips his loosely-circled fingers slowly up and down. Cas can’t quite stifle a gasp, the pleasure that radiates from where Dean’s fingers are brushing makes his toes curl.
“You should come see this.” Crowley crooks a finger at Dean. He oozes self-satisfaction. Dean hefts himself out of his chair, pauses to press an oddly chaste kiss to Cas’ lips before retaking his position next to Crowley. A smile spreads across his face as he looks down at the result of Crowley’s work. Cas tries to press his legs together, humiliation flooding back into him. Dean and Crowley each grab one of his knees, keeping him open and exposed to their gaze.
Cas wakes with a start. He jolts up, momentarily forgetting where he is. He glances around the unfamiliar room until his eyes land on the man standing in the doorway.
Dean leans back. “You like this?” His voice is husky and his hand speeds up. The question swirls through Cas’ mind. He doesn’t know. The slick sounds of Dean’s hand on himself makes his cock ache, but the derision in his voice makes him want to run and hide. “
Dean moans as Crowley tongue worms it’s way into his mouth. He glances at Cas only to find him staring mutely at them, hand unmoving. He pulls away from Crowley’s insistent mouth.
“Please, Dean!” He clenches his hands hard on the bedframe. If he were at full power, the metal would warp and bend. As it is, his desperation has no affect on anything but himself. Dean’s taunting fingers combine with the ever-moving machine to bring his need to near agony. “Please, Dean, let me come.”
in front Crowley is a deeply uncomfortable experience for him. He sighs and yanks his t-shirt over his head. No sense in dallying, he knows it won’t change anything.
Cas rubs his eyes, just how long had he slept? He looks around the room, but there’s no clock in sight. Dean laughs softly.
Dean sets one hand on Crowley’s shoulder, the other resumes it’s previous activity. Cas’ cheeks burn, having them both watch so intently, he feels utterly exposed. The worry is knocked from his head by Crowley’s hand thrusting deeper into him, spreading his insides like it’s nothing. The pace picks up, becomes
“Get back in here.” “Just where do you think you’re going?” Dean and Crowley speak at the same time. They laugh, as if the situation is just a friendly get together. Cas forces himself back into the room. He obeys Dean’s crooked finger until he’s standing just inches from them. His heart pounds as Crowley’s hand reaches out and strokes down his cheek. It slides down his neck until it’s playing with the neckline of his shirt. Cas shudders, disgust and fear slithering up his spine. His breathing picks up as Dean’s body presses against his back, shoving him up against Crowley. He’s pressed between them with two sets of hands roaming over his body.
Dean had physically staked his claim. Carved his initial over Cas’ heart. The blood will wash away, but the cuts are deep enough to scar. Once he gets his grace back, he could easily heal the scarring. It’d be like it was never even there.
to him. A shudder runs through him at the memory of the machine taking him, Dean pleasuring himself to his abasement. He can’t quite brush off he arousal warming his groin, but he can try to ignore it.
He gasps out, “I do. I do!” There’s no room for his embarrassment in this situation. He can only do as Dean asks, so he’ll answer honestly, degrade himself at his request. Dean returns to his chair, pulls it to the edge of the bed, right next to them.
that.” A shudder runs through Cas. He knows that, in a way, Dean’s right. He’d been wanting to do something like that with him for years. The situation as a whole is all wrong, but touching Dean, being touched, can’t
it?” Crowley’s mouth turns up into a knowing smirk as Dean speaks. Cas shudders. He has to admit at this point that he’s enjoying Crowley’s attention, but Dean’s will always hit him differently than anyone else’s.
Cas tries to stand, but Dean’s arm squeezes him tight to his chest. He awkwardly shoves his underwear down and kicks them off his legs.
“Keep doing that. Don’t stop until I tell you to, understand?” Crowley accepts Cas’ silent nod and pats him on the head. He strolls over to Dean’s chair and leans over to whisper something in his ear. Cas strains to hear, but he can’t make anything out. He watches with confusion and then shock as Dean pulls Crowley down by his shirt collar so he can kiss him.
“Dean!” Cas stumbles towards him. He’s weak from lack of grace, but his desperation to help Dean keeps him going. Sam had to told him to stay away, that Dean would be too strong and violent for him to handle in his current form, but he just couldn’t bring himself to.
like that not many people have seen you like this.” He leans in close, pressing their bodies together. He grabs Cas’ chin to keep eye contact. “I guess I’m just possessive like that.”
“Nice, nice, the pants too.” Cas stands so he can slip the jeans off and gets back into position without being prompted. Dean’s lips curl in a sneer. With his teeth bared like that, Cas gets that feeling of being prey again. Prey that’s about to be eaten.
Crowley leans in until he’s speaking into Cas’ open mouth. “Don’t forget who’s playing with you right now.” He presses against him, forcing him to walk backwards until they hit the bed. Crowley shoves him onto the bed and pulls his jeans off. Cas follows Crowley’s gesture to scoot up the bed until he’s nestled comfortably in the pillows. He glances to the side as Crowley strips off his jacket and and rolls up his sleeves. Dean catches his eye and blows him a kiss. Not quite the reassurance Cas’d been hoping for, but it’ll have to do.
of his over-used body crying out for a break. Dean’s thrusts turn short and sharp. He drops down and shoves his face into Cas’ throat, his breath coming out in huffs.
“Why? Why ignore it? Didn’t... didn’t you say you want me too? Did you not as a human?” The questions tumble out of him. He’s terrified of the answer, but he can’t just ignore it.
taught you that?” Dean releases his mouth, but Cas just gasps into the sheets. Dean yanks his head up by a handful of his hair. “I said,” He presses his mouth against his ear. “
Dean pulls his head back, but leaves his hands and body pressed to him. “Enjoying yourself? I knew you would.” He loosens the tight grip of both his hands. Cas sighs in relief at the respite from the pain. His breath hitches in a small gasp as both hands switch to gentle stroking. Having his hair pet is such a tender gesture that the tightness in his chest loosens, but the soft rasp of Dean’s other hand against his pants sounds all too loud in the silent cabin. The sensation of gentle pressure stroking him forces his body to react. He can’t just
“Now take it in your mouth- ah, just the head for now.” Cas sucks gently, the thought occurs to him that he’s doing more than ordered, but Dean’s hitched breath reassures him that he’s doing well. “Mmm, good boy. You’re doing even better than I expected.”
“Hard, huh? I could see that shit even before the pants came off, damn you’re a pervert.” He leans forward until his face is just inches away from Cas’, his hand keeps it’s slow, even pace. “Can’t believe you’re getting off on this. Guess it makes sense though, considering how much you’ve let everyone step all over you.” It stings, but he’s in no place to argue.
Dean’s brow furrowed as he clicked to open his schedule on his computer. “I don’t see any appointments,” he said.
“Come with us,” Dean said. “We’re going to try and sneak Jo’s knife collection into St. Christopher’s to dip them in the holy water. Who knew Jo being a psycho would come in handy someday, huh?”
Cas brightened and grabbed a few, stuffing them in his mouth. He groaned in delight and Dean felt his face heat up with a blush. And that was saying something because he was sitting only a couple feet away from a pretty healthy fire.
“—And second, I really will explain everything, but I need to go to sleep. I swear I’ll tell you tomorrow.”
“Oh!” the man said, a goofy looking smile spreading across his face. “Why didn’t you say you were here to meet the Novaks? Right this way!”
“How is this happening, Cas?” he asked. “How the fuck are they the couple Gilda happened to invite over? How is this a thing that is happening?”
Dean, who had been gazing in the general direction of the black haired, trench coated teen in question, jumped and turned to face his friend. “Shut up, Charlie,” he said with a scowl and a blush. “I’m not staring.”
His adversary was down in that rubble somewhere, recuperating. Cas didn’t want to give him the opportunity to do so, but he had taken a pretty big hit in the last round of fighting as well. He removed his hand from the wound at his side and saw the circle of blood staining his white shirt grow larger, the crimson substance seeping into the starched fabric. The wound was large, but Castiel would survive. He’d certainly survived worse. And technically, as he was always quick to point out to Gabriel, he couldn’t actually die in his dreams. Though, of course, Gabriel always replied that brain dead was as good as dead and that was usually enough to cow Castiel into a huffy silence.
Cas shrugged, watching his marshmallow closely. “My promotion was very recent. I’m not sure I’m qualified to tell you.”
Three years later, instead of a best man’s speech, Sam projected his phone recording onto a giant screen while Dean hid his bright red face in his hands and Cas smiled through his tears.
Dean craned his neck back to see his boyfriend who was standing just behind the arm of the couch where he was resting his head. He cracked a smile, “Can you hand me the remote?”
He paused leaning halfway down to pick up the bag containing all of his new robes and realized he’d be able to sleep as late as he wanted. If he could get to sleep, that is. This was going to be the first time since he was four years old that he wouldn’t be sharing a room. Some people might be excited by the prospect, but Dean honestly wasn’t sure that he was going to be able to fall asleep at all without the sound of his brother snoring next to him.
Dean let out an explosive sigh. “Come on, man. You’ve gotta come hang out. First of all, we all miss you. Even though you’re an annoying pain in the butt like ninety nine percent of the time, you can be okay sometimes. And Charlie and Jo and Cas all miss you, too.” His words didn’t seem to sway Sam, however. “Okay, and second,” Dean went on, “Mom will kill me if I don’t get you to do something with us today. You know she’s not going to believe that you wanted to be alone. She’s going to think that I told you that you couldn’t hang out with me and my friends. Come on, just sit in the living room with us.”
Dean shrugged and put his hand on Cas’ cheek. “Felt pretty real to me,” he said, using his thumb to wipe away a stray tear that had managed to escape from those watery blue eyes. He moved in and pressed his lips to Cas’, in their very first and very real kiss.
“I can’t, Cas,” Dean said. “What if they changed their mind? I mean, I haven’t talked to Sam since he agreed to come. What if he decided that he was happier without me? What if—“
“It’s not funny, Dean!” Sam whispered violently, trying to shrink in on himself to hopefully shrink the audience they had garnered. “I’m supposed to meet Jess for a study date later!”
A terrible shriek rang through the air. Dean used the opportunity to push himself to his feet and start running again, eternally grateful that he had managed to keep hold of his weapons in the scuffle. He felt like he had been run over by a tractor, but he kept running. He knew that if he could just get to Cas, they could put their plan into action.
“Sammy!” Dean’s voice boomed throughout the hall, but the few students awake this early ignored him, too sleepy to focus on anything but their meals. Usually, Dean would be right there with the tired masses, but he had quidditch practice later and that always seemed to put him in a good mood. “Come to try and return the favor for that itching powder?” he asked with a wink, sliding smoothly onto the bench across from Sam.
“If I had any control over it, I would not have allowed it to happen while you were inebriated,” Cas huffed, crossing his arms tightly across his chest and turning away.
Dean knocked on Sam’s door. “Yo, Sammy, can I come in?” He knocked again when there was no answer and nudged the door open a sliver. “Sam?”
After thanking Dean, Sam went upstairs to grab a quick shower, leaving Cas and Dean to wash and dry the dishes.
“You going to fuck me over my desk again, babe?” Dean asked, the effect of his cheeky smirk lessened somewhat by the large bite of burger he had just taken.
“Hey,” Sam’s voice drifted into the kitchen, footsteps getting closer. “Do I smell p—I’ll come back later.”
Dean’s head snapped up. “I what? Oh shit!” He pushed Cas out of the way and began trying to put the fire out with his wand. “Stop laughing and help me!” he shouted at Cas, who was now doubled over and wheezing.
“So can I assume that you’re totally crushing on him?” she asked. “Like some serious Doctor/Rose type crushing?”
This part of the night, with the crackling of the flame, the lateness of the hour, the whispering of the wind through the trees, this part was supposed to be filled with Sam’s laughter and gasps as they told scary story after scarier story. Instead his senses were assaulted strictly with the sounds and smells of nature. Except the roasting marshmallow. That smelled like beauty of human invention. But still.
Dean still eyed him suspiciously, but seemed to let it pass. Unfortunately, instead of picking up his drink again, he began to pile eggs and sausages onto his plate. The amount of food he had amassed made Sam scoff.
“Nothing really,” Dean replied. “Some candies just go with the whole movie watching experience. Now try, you’ll like it.”
Cas wasn’t worried, however. He figured it was something to do with his birthday. How Dean had planned this day in secrecy was still beyond him, though now that he was thinking about it, Dean had been passing an awful lot of notes to Charlie lately. Cas had just figured they were talking about their latest pop culture obsession, which varied week to week, and which Cas usually had little interest in.
He looked over to Cas, a stricken expression on his face as he began to feel his bond start to vibrate. Cas was staring back at him with the same look. Whatever his dad was doing was working. He didn’t know how they were going to stop this.
Cas moved his hands from Dean’s jacket, gliding up his chest, and finally coming to rest cupping either side of his face. “I love you, Dean.”
Cas gripped his sword tightly, though it wasn’t a sword in the traditional sense. His was a cylinder sharpened and formed into a sharp point. He felt it suited his fighting style the best.
“Me, too,” Dean replied. “But we haven’t gone inside yet. He could be waiting in there with an arsenal.”
That’s what he told himself, anyway, as he pitched the tent in the late afternoon sun, as he went fishing at the lake, as he sat to build a fire in the dying light. He was perfectly fine by himself. Perfectly. Fine.
Dean scrunched his face in thought. “Huh, guess I didn’t.” He shrugged and Cas punched his arm again. “Ow! What was that one for?”
Dean just accepted it. It was hardly the worst thing that could have happened to him, and the doctors were hopeful that things could someday turn around for him. And even if it never did, well, it’s not like he didn’t deserve worse. And besides, it’s not like he really remembered long enough to get really worked up about it.
Cas pushed himself into the air with his wings. His landing had blown out all the nearby flames, and now Cas’ wings worked to keep them away.
Dean couldn’t stop smiling after that. He texted Sam the good news since he was in class, and then called Cas who responded with his understated excitement, as per usual.
“We’re going to get him back, Dean,” Cas murmured over and over again. “We’re going to get him back.”
Cas scoffed and rolled his eyes, but was unable to keep the slight blush at bay. “It’s just… you’ve never let anyone wear it before.”
Dean tried blinking rapidly to clear his vision, and it did enough to where he could see the vague form of a man take shape in front of him. Whoever it was sat against the opposite wall of the crater, legs pulled up to his chest (Dean assumed it was a man because of the voice).
Dean bit the inside of his cheek to keep from replying. Cas’ dad had left when he was seven, leaving a recently returned from duty Gabriel to look after him. Cas had come to peace with it, but Dean, who had had to watch his best friend cry himself to sleep every night for a week, hadn’t. He supposed it also didn’t help that Dean’s own father had left not too long ago, the wound fresh enough to make Dean’s knuckles go white where he was clenching them.
They both chanced a look at each other, relieved and emboldened by seeing the blush on the other’s face.
Dean rolled his eyes. “It can cool off in my stomach.” He walked past Cas to lay his eyes on the lopsided pie. Any self respecting baker would have shuddered at the sight, but Dean merely beamed. “What possessed you to make a pie?” he asked. “I never figured you for taking up baking. Krav Maga, maybe. Hell, even gardening. Isn’t that what your buddy Joshua did?”
Dean pulled some plates down from the cabinet and set them on the counter. “Yeah, he’s a dragon.” There was a short pause. Dean even pulled his phone away from his ear to check and see if the call had been dropped. “Uh, Bobby?”
“I’m right here,” Cas growled. “And perfectly capable of independent thinking and decision making, thanks.”
Sam barely paused to watch his trajectory, too focused on getting to his brother. Whatever had kept Cas out obviously only worked on dragons since Sam passed whatever barrier there was with ease, skidding to a stop in front of Dean who was struggling frantically to escape his bonds.
“Meat lovers, it is,” Dean said, pulling his phone out of his pocket and dialing. “There still beer in the fridge?”
“Dean, I love you,” Cas said. “I truly do.” He bent to grab the remote and then just dropped to his knees to be eye level with Dean. He held the remote in front of Dean’s face. “But if you call me out here one more time to grab you the remote I’m going to find a marathon of Toddlers in Tiaras, put it on, and then smash the remote beyond repair.”
"Yeah," Dean agreed. "Even if you are a pain in the butt, I did sort of miss having your ugly mug around."
Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Because you fought for free will but it never applied to you, right?”
“Oh god,” Dean said again. “This is going to be a disaster. Maybe I should just tell him his present is going out to the city.”
Cas just patted him on the knee. “Let’s go home, Dean,” he said, keeping his hand on Dean’s leg and moving it up a couple inches and squeezing.
“Does this make us official now?” Cas asked, pulling the jacket more tightly around himself. It felt like being enveloped in a warm hug in winter.
“Don’t kill me but Sam sent me to keep an eye on you,” Charlie told him with a sheepish smile and the vulcan salute.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm himself. “We are not having this conversation right now.”
“Dammit, Cas, I told you to be back in time for dinner,” Dean said, getting himself all riled up and ready for a fight.
Sam could not believe he hadn’t taken a drink yet. Dean almost choked to death on one of the sausages, but ended up coughing his way through it sans orange juice.
“Great visual, thanks,” Charlie said as she and Cas followed Jo into the kitchen. “And anyways, we’re going to the park because my parents keep yelling at me to,” she adopted a deeper, authoritative voice for the next bit, “
“And just who the fuck do you think you are?” John asked through a bloody nose, shakily pushing himself to his feet.
"But you'll hang out with us today, though, right?" Cas asked him. "And I know that Charlie and Jo have been wondering where you were, too. We're hanging out with them at the park tomorrow, so you should definitely come."
“What are we doing?” Dean’s voice was back to squeaking. “Um, uh… just, you know… hanging out?” His voice went higher at the end, turning what should have been a statement into a question.
“I guess we should be grateful you’re using video games as a proxy,” Cas told her, trading his controller for his soda on the table. Sam had won a narrow victory in the last seconds of the round.
“You are not a fuck up, Dean,” Cas told him. “You were feeling attacked and lashed out. I’m sorry I wasn’t more supportive.”
“I—“ Cas stopped and cleared his throat. “Are you lying to me? Dean looks angry that you’re over here.”
“Your letterman jacket?” Cas asked, stunned. No one got to wear Dean Winchester’s letterman jacket. Not even Lisa Braeden who Dean had dated all of sophomore and well into junior year. Cas had only been seeing him for about a month now—he wasn’t even sure they were technically official yet.
Sam shrugged. “Maybe. I mean, obviously, yeah. But. I don’t know, I guess I’m just learning something new about him every day.”
“We are soul mates,” Cas replied, matter of fact. “And if one of us is the sap in this relationship, it is most definitely
Visibly resisting the urge to slam the door, Sam closed it quietly. “What if dad stays here for a while? You just plan on staying up here all night?”
It had taken thirty minutes and Gabriel swearing on his life that Dean would not be let out of his sight for even a second to convince her to let him go.
“Oh fuck,” Dean said, closing the door to the freezer and knocking his head against it. “I totally forgot about that.”
Dean just couldn’t stop smiling. Bobby approved of Cas, Sam was back in his life, he didn’t have to worry about hunting interfering with his normal life. He had it all. And the past five years with Cas had really helped him come a long way in not always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Things were going good—great, even—definitely better than he had ever dreamed that they would, and maybe that was okay. Maybe things could stay like this. Maybe some people really do get their happy endings.
“Dean, you have wings,” Cas told him, trying and failing not to snap. “I literally made them so you won’t be able to fall. While I understand that phobias are irrational and telling you to get over them is pointless to the point of offensive, I’m going to really need you to dig deep and push past it anyway. The adversary could be back at any moment!” And practically on cue, the adversary knocked Cas right out of the sky.
“Uh,” Sam said from where he had been watching the exchange rather awkwardly. “Guys? What are you talking about?”
“Fine,” Sam shouted, throwing his hands up in the air. “Disappear for another five years, see if I come and look for you this time!”
Mary snorted. “Yeah, but shouldn’t you be trying to make a good impression on Cas?” She lowered her voice to a whisper, “We want to make sure he sticks around.”
Cas furrowed his brow and tilted his head to the side in his default expression for confusion. “Dean has a crush?”
Sam’s lips ticked up in a smile. “It’s nothing,” he said. “I just found some stuff out about Dean that…” He sighed. “Well, that explains some things.”
Cas turned a deep shade of red. “Please just drive,” he grit out, shrinking down in his seat and covering his face with the hand not being squeezed by Dean’s.
"Trouble in paradise already," Sam said. "What a tragedy." He rolled his eyes and turned to look out of his window.
“What que—“ Dean smacked himself in the forehead. “Oh my god, duh, dude. Yes. Yes, I want to go to the dance with you.”
“I want a normal life, Gabriel,” Cas said, standing on wobbly legs. “Besides, you’re the one that told me to get out more.”
They left as soon as Dean was finished, Dean still fussing over Cas in the backseat. They saw fire engines, lights and sounds blaring, heading in the opposite direction once they got on the highway and figured someone must have seen the blaze and called it in. They would later find out from Bobby that their father had been taken into custody for questioning about the blaze, and eventually to prison when they discovered half a dozen warrants for his arrest. It wasn’t a perfect solution to their problem, but it was a nice little band-aid until they came up with something better.
Dean sat next to his mom as the police questioned them. He wasn’t paying attention, couldn’t. His mind kept switching from racing thoughts to a complete blank as he tried to figure out what to do. He and his friends had only managed to anoint one of Jo’s knives in the holy water at St. Christopher’s before a nun had seen them and they had been escorted out of the church. It would have to be enough. They had to move quickly. They had to get Sam back.
“Glad I could be good for something,” Dean retorted, following them and slamming the door once they were outside.
“Jeez, what took you two so long?” Jo asked. “Did you have to drop the ring off at Mordor before grabbing my muffin?”
“Lafitte’s?” Jess asked. “Fine dining doesn’t really seem like your brother’s M.O. from what you’ve told me. Maybe he’s trying to make an effort.”
There was a short silence in which Sam had to remind himself not to feel guilty for making things awkward since they were the jerks that tricked Sam into wearing a hideous fire hazard.
It had taken a moment, he’d been distracted by Dean’s seemingly-human emotions, but the fact that he’d just admitted to
Dean nuzzles into his neck. He tenses, readying himself for another painful bite, but Dean gently kisses it instead. “Say it.” His voice is harsh, but Cas can only focus on his gentle lips.
“Yeah?” Dean nudges Crowley forward by his grip on his shoulder. “You like having his whole hand shoved up inside you?” Crowley resumes his previous pace. Cas’ head snaps back into the pillows, a low moan spilling from his mouth.
Dean shoves in hard and holds himself there. He grunts against Cas’ neck, his body tense. He grinds his hips against Cas’ ass and goes limp. Cas reaches up to stroke his hair, his fingers combing through it.
Cas glances at Dean. He’s disheartened, although not surprised, to find him leisurely stroking himself through his jeans. Dean shoots him a pleased smile. Cas gasps as Crowley’s hand squeezes a handful of his ass.
“Glad we can agree on so much these days.” Crowley turns his attention to Cas. “And I must say,” A sneer spreads across his face. “
“There we go, good boy.” Dean sets the knife on the bedside table. He gently slides his finger over the cuts, smearing blood as he goes. He aimlessly writes a few letters with the excess blood.
Cas blinks at the light as the blindfold is pulled from his eyes. He watches Dean pop his blood covered finger in his mouth. Dean makes a pleased sound as he savors it. It makes Cas’ stomach turn.
Cas is mildly surprised at the lack of strange devices set up in the room. No tables or bars or toys laid out on the bed. Somehow, that only serves to make him more nervous. Dean slips off his boots and flannel and seats himself on the bed, right in the middle, his back to the wall. Cas follows Dean crooked finger and crawls up so he’s sitting between his spread legs, back to chest. Dean’s hands slide all over his clothed body. Despite the anxiety still nagging at him, Cas can’t help but relax against him. Dean’s body is warm and steady against him. It’s pleasant, reminiscent of their embrace of the previous night.
Dean pulls him close and gives him a deep, claiming kiss before handing him over to Crowley. Cas had been hoping that Crowley’d just... help or maybe even just watch, but Dean willingly hands him the reins. Dean seats himself in an armchair that’d been placed in the corner of the room, just a few feet away from the head of the bed. Cas sends a pleading glance in his direction before turning to face his task. Crowley looks him up and down, hungry, and smirks like he’s just won some kind of contest. Cas’ filled with the irrational urge to cover up his already clothed body.
“Ah- huh?” Cas wakes slowly, confused. “Dean?” He feels an arm tighten around his waist and a hand rubbing him through his pants. A low moan in a familiar voice answers him. He can feel Dean’s erection rubbing against his ass through the layers of their clothes. Cas can’t help but get hard, can’t help the arousal that burns through him as he thinks of Dean taking pleasure from touching his sleeping body. It should feel like an invasion, being felt up and rutted against while unaware, but it’s
, per se, but the whole thing feels... off. Dean had been strange. Moody. Cas lays his hand over his heart, the fresh cuts throb under the bandages. While Dean had left without a word, he also left a first aid kit and fresh clothes laid out on the bed.
“Cas.” Hearing his name rather than the nickname Dean seems to be so fond of stalls him. “You’re gonna be fine.” Cas lifts his head and makes eye contact with him. His face is serious, it reminds Cas of all the times Dean has been
“One sec.” Dean leaves the bedroom and returns a few moments later with an armful of folded clothes. Cas takes them apprehensively, he’s half expecting them to be something perverted. Instead, he’s greeted with what appears to be some of Dean’s clothes. Blue jeans, a black t-shirt, and blue boxer briefs.
“That’s what I’m saying.” He holds his hand out for a handshake. Cas can’t help but hesitate before sealing the deal, he has a feeling he knows what sort of things Dean want from him.
“I think the puppy needs to be taught not to bark.” Dean jeers from the sidelines. Cas sucks in a breath, it stings coming from him. Crowley chuckles and gives Dean a mocking thumbs up.
“Almost done in there?” Dean’s voice carries through the bathroom door. Cas sucks in a deep breath and opens the door.
“I’m gonna need to you stay nice and still for me.”  He laughs under his breath at the way Cas’ body tenses. He presses his hand to Cas’ shoulder, holding him down. The tip of the knife digs in slightly off-center on his chest.
“Thank you... and,” Cas twists his fingers in the hem of his shirt. “I haven’t.” It’s the truth. He only has eyes for Dean.
, has his whole body throbbing with a low pleasure. He can hear his heartbeat in his ears, feel it in his dick, he idly wonders if
“Shouldn’t make assumptions, angel.” Dean’s snicker slips through Crowley’s statement. “I’m not going to fuck you... not tonight at least. I am however, going to see how much that little hole can stretch. Like I said,” His eyes flash red, threatening. “I’m here to give you some much needed training.” Cas looks to Dean, silently pleading with him. Dean winks at him and pulls Crowley into another kiss.
while the man he loves (and lusts after) is slowly jerking him off through his clothes. While it’s physically pleasurable, it multiplies his shame tenfold. He just feels so
“Where-” Cas glances at Dean to see if he’ll be shushed again. Dean keeps his eyes on the road, but a smile crosses his face. “Where are we going?”
, angel. That’s so fucking hot.” Dean rubs a fingertip around Cas’ stretched rim. “I’ve been wanting to fill you up
that Dean does to him. The ruthless thrusts makes his insides ache, but he’ll savor that ache afterwards. He’ll jerk off to the memory of Dean’s cruelty while the brothers are off hunting.
“Wooah, now don’t get too excited.” Dean pins him firmly against the wall with the length of his body. “Demons don’t really have the same emotions, you know.” Cas knows. But hearing him say it still pierces his heart. Tears slip silently down his cheeks, he can’t help it. “Oh, don’t cry.” Dean presses pecks over the tear trails. It’s comforting, but Cas can’t stop. A sob tears it’s way out of him.
Cas reaches out, brushing his fingers against Dean’s clothed back. Dean abruptly stands. “Get cleaned up and go to bed. I’ll be back tomorrow morning.”
Dean’s throat clicks as he swallows. Arousal burns through him, making his mind fuzzy. He slips the slit open underwear off of Cas. Naturally, he’s soft. Unaroused. But Dean takes a certain sick satisfaction in being the only one getting any enjoyment out of this. He doesn’t like to admit it, but Cas’ reminder of their time limit is hitting him hard. He’s not ready to give this up. Won’t be ready in five days. Might not
He spends most of the day familiarizing himself with the cabin and Dean’s extensive collection of sex toys and bondage gear. It’s intimidating, but he tells himself that he can handle anything Dean throws at him. He knows that he’s lying to himself, but he doesn’t have much of a choice in the matter. He knows what some of the objects are, but a lot of them are complete mysteries to him.
Crowley’s quiet voice floats over to him. “Think he likes it. I’m impressed by how much progress he’s made in, what, three days? You’ve got a real talent for this.” Humiliation flushes his skin. They’re sitting just feet away from him, shamelessly talking about him like he’s some kind of
.” He leaves the room for a few nerve-wracking moments, Cas listens carefully for his return, but is confused by the soft sound of wheels rolling on the wood floor. Dean reenters the bedroom, preceded by a small rolling table. Cas struggles to keep his head held high enough to keep his eyes on the strange machine atop the table as Dean wheels it to the end of the bed.
Cas lies on the bed, spread out and sore. As the afterglow of his orgasm fades, the shame rolls back in. He can’t help but picture himself: begging, hard, and ultimately
Dean calls Crowley into his lap with a crook of his finger. Cas watches with bewilderment as the ever arrogant King straddles Dean’s lap and begins kissing his neck. Dean gives him a smug look over Crowley’s head. Cas forces his eyes away, trying to ignore the stab of pain in his chest. He shoves his fingers in one more time and decides that he doesn’t care if it hurts. He just wants... he has to admit it to himself. What he wants more than anything is to get Crowley off of Dean. And if that means Crowley gets on top of
Dean leans in and whispers in his ear. “Go get that cum off your face.” He pushes him into the bathroom, making him stumble. He catches himself on the counter and catches Dean’s gaze in the mirror.
Cas places himself in the middle of the large bed. Before he can ask Dean for further instruction, he’s leaning over and grabbing his wrists. Cas tries and fail to quell his panic as his wrists are bound to the bedframe with sturdy leather cuffs. His arms are stretched out, each hand near the bedposts. He’s confused by the strange metal bar Dean holds up with a smile. He’s about to ask, but Dean shushes him pre-emptively. He watches with trepidation as Dean spreads his legs and straps his ankles into the loops on either side of the bar. His heart rate picks up as Dean attaches ropes to the ends and pulls his legs up. He ties them to the headboard, forcing Cas’ legs to stay spread and held up. Cas’ breathing is mildly impeded by his knees being pulled up to his chest, but it’s nothing dangerous.
Dean’s hand slowly pushes his head down. He accommodates his cock the best he can, but he can’t help but gag when it slips too deep. He’s about to pull off and apologize when his head’s shoved down further, making him retch.
“Why are you making this difficult?” Dean stops the car as he speaks. Cas gets the feeling that they don’t need to be worried about being in anyone’s way out here.
The thought is knocked from his mind as Crowley’s knuckles press against his rim. It’s not the brutal invasion that he’d been expecting, but it still stings.
“No.” Cas hasn’t felt truly unsafe with Dean in so long... but the way Dean’s looking at him makes his blood run cold. “I finally found you. I’m not going to run away.” Dean’s gaze is sharp and predatory. Cas has the irrational thought that he’s about to be eaten.
“Wait.” He squeezes his eyes shut to block out Crowley’s lecherous gaze. “This... this wasn’t part of the deal.”
Dean’s boot slides forward until it rests against Cas’ groin. He presses hard enough that Cas sucks in a sharp breath. Cas shoves the urge to shoves Dean’s foot away and forces himself to stay as still as possible.
“Good thing the walls are thick, ‘cuz you just can’t shut up, huh?” Dean’s words are harsh, but they barely register past the pleasure of his cock grinding deep inside him. He whimpers against Dean’s painfully tight grip. “
“What’s that? Speak up.” Dean releases one of Cas’ thighs in favor of grabbing his chin. Cas’ eyes shoot open to meet Dean’s.
flashes through his mind. When had that happened? And why? Why does Dean insist on keeping Cas like this when he already has someone that
“Dean.” It’s all Cas has to say. Just his name is enough to send him over the edge. He grabs the headboard for support as he cums on Cas face for the second time of the day. Cas doesn’t try to shy away from the mess, just takes it without complaint. His eyes are focused on the way Dean’s thighs quiver as he orgasms. Once Dean’s body goes still, they slide up to his face. The smirk there is familiar by now.
“Got some shit to take care of. Stay in the house, do whatever you want. I’ll be back later. You can just go to bed if it gets late before I’m back.” Dean watches closely as Cas pulls his clothes back on.
Dean reaches over and sets his hand on Cas’ thigh, making his words die in his mouth. They drive in silence. Cas finds it slightly unsettling to be in a silent car with him; Dean
a demon. The idea fills him with hope. But as soon as Dean’s display of emotion comes, it leaves. His sad expression is replaced with a leer.
“You need to come with me, Dean.” His words come out tinged with desperation. He’d wanted to sound strong, but their separation has affected him even more than he had realized. Dean’s death and rebirth as a demon has been such a painful, lonely experience. Sam and Hannah have been there for him, but no one can replace Dean in his heart. Just seeing him again nearly takes his breath away.
“Happy to see me?” He hangs his overcoat on a hook as if nothing’s amiss. Cas’ still silent from shock as Dean saunters into the living room, firmly locking the door behind him.
He jumps in shock as the table above him is violently shoved back. His squints against the light as Dean’s broad grin comes into focus.
“Damn,” Dean’s voice is a near growl. “You’re just eating it up, huh? You like that?” Cas squeezes his eyes shut and forces himself to answer honestly.
?” Dean’s face is serious, as if getting Cas to parrot back Crowley’s words is of the utmost importance. Crowley looks up at him with a raised eyebrow, but doesn’t interrupt.
.” Dean grabs him by his arm and pulls him around the corner of the building. Cas is too weak to put up much struggle, although he’s not sure that he would anyway. He can’t stand the thought of leaving Dean now that he’s found him. Dean shoves him roughly into the car parked behind the building.
he’s dealing with. He wants to believe that Dean’d protect him from and truly serious punishment... but Dean’s surprised him a lot in the past four days. He does his best to ignore Crowley’s low snicker and shoves in a third finger, impatient to get the whole thing over with. He silently prays that Crowley won’t be joining them again.
“Mmm, open up, angel.” Dean murmurs against his lips. It makes Cas shudder, but he stubbornly shakes his head, despite how it painfully pulls his hair. Dean’s eyes narrow. “I said,” His free hand slides down the font of Cas’ body. It settles on his groin and squeezes painfully. “
Cas turns to face him. He’s still facing forward, watching the road with a slight smirk. Cas grabs his hand and pulls it away.
Cas gasps. The cold metal’s pressed to his groin. He’d been hoping that Dean’d spare him this, but no such luck. He’d knowingly angered him and now he’s suffering the consequences. He’s grateful for how slowly the blade cuts the fabric, less room for error, but at the same time he wishes it’d be over already. Even without seeing him, he can tell that Dean’s enjoying himself. The blade isn’t working efficiently, it’s sliding all over his skin as it cuts the fabric. Caressing him. In his mind, the hands from his dream turn to shiny silver blades, glinting in the low light of the abyss he’d been trapped in.
and pulls a small remote from his pocket. Cas pulls fruitlessly at his bonds as panic washes over him.
“Mmm, how about you go get cleaned up while I eat?” Dean’s already heading towards the kitchen as he speaks. Cas nods to the empty doorway. He sighs, stands and stumbles to the bathroom. He takes a long, hard look at himself in the mirror. The lower half of his face is coated in Dean’s cum, dripping into his mouth, off his chin onto his bare chest. The humiliation stings, but a weak stab of arousal heats his stomach regardless. He’s glad that he’s too tired to get hard. He takes a longer shower than necessary, giving himself more time to calm down.
“Nope.” Dean ruts against him with a soft moan. Cas isn’t even fighting it anymore. Can’t bring himself to. It just feels
over him in the past. The expression quickly slips off his face, replaced by the now more common crudeness, but it soothes Cas’ anxiety regardless. He lies down, surrenders himself. Just six more days. He knows he can do it.
“Good job.” Dean’s voice’s soft now. He give Cas another soft kiss before pulling out of him, making him gasp. He collapses down next to him and pulls him into his arms.
“You can have the bed for tonight. I’ll take the couch.” Cas starts to protest, but Dean shushes him. “Don’t worry. We’ll be sharing it for the next seven nights...that is, if you can handle them.” His voice is low as he guides Cas to the bedroom. Once they’re in the room, Dean plants a short kiss on his lips and tells him to get some sleep.
“Stop it, both of you. This is not helping the situation at hand.” He stared both of them down in turn until they both relented. Then he turned to Dean and sank down onto the bed next to him. “Will you be alright if I go downstairs?”
