Dean was never one for much sleep. He got used to it over the years. His dad used to have them out of the house – or more likely, one of the crappy motels they were staying at, or some stupid log cabin with no hot water or electricity a couple of miles outside the city – by 6:30 on the dot. Vaporeon, who’s got a sleep schedule weirder than Dean’s, can usually sense when he’s awake, and starts pawing at his sheets impatiently.
Cas got rid of his, well, butt feathers at the quickest possible opportunity, and his left Dodrio head is drooping beyond recognition. Tessa, despite the amazing costume, had sighed
It’s not a long drive, and the beach is pretty empty because it’s still early in the season and the weekend’s not here yet. There are more wild Pokemon out there, a scattering of Wingulls that Dean tears up a couple of slices of bread for and some Magikarp in the shallows, than other people. It’s not much of a beach, either, more a couple of yards between a rich forest and the rise and swell of the sea, but it stretches out for a long while along the coast. The smell of sea salt wafts through the air, tempered by the damp forest.
Dean wakes up and scrubs over his face with his hand. He’s sweating and somehow his left foot escaped its sock while he slept.
, God. Dean’s sold sculptures of the two of them, paired in a set. But she’s here, she’s real, in the feathery flesh. And so is her brother.
Dean could fill a couple of books with his stories from Opelucid. And yet, from up here, he realizes there’s so much about the city he didn’t know, he never knew, and he’s never going to know. Entire worlds.
Cas turns his head around, slow and deliberate. And the second Dean makes eye contact, he knows Cas is back. The light catches in his eyes, and though his face is set in a placid state, there’s a determination carved there too. This isn’t just some automaton any more. Cas is back, he’s
As if on cue, he cries out, once more, “I’ll hold them all off!” Staraptor lets her wingspan stretch out to its full length, a shield of feathers and sinew against all that brawn and the Pokemon breathing poison into the air. Dean’s heart taps fast enough at the sight of the two of them, the man and his Pokemon, that he wonders if he got an Electrode stuffed up inside there while he wasn’t paying attention.
“That isn’t true. You have to know that.” Cas doesn’t even look angry when he meets Dean’s eyes. There’s a weary expression on his face, a little sad.
against each other. Dean doesn’t care, and judging from the way Cas’ hands come up to clutch at his hair, his neck, his very
“Gordon? Abby?” Cas asks, head still stuck like that. He turns toward Dean. “They — recognized you.”
Dean’s breath feels close to a physical weight, and his knuckles alternatively press against and brush his chest. Castiel lets his eyes fall shut. It should be frightening, depriving himself of one sense, but it makes the others seem stronger. There is just so much of Dean; there always has been, in a way, but not like this.
Dean only has to consider it for a second or two. “I’ve held back enough. I don’t wanna hide this. Least I can do is tell them.”
When they get to the gym, the guard – not Flagstaff, though his Pokemon is also a Garchomp, but a a big guy with shellacked hair and a serious resting bitchface – waves them in no questions asked. They should probably talk strategy, but once they get inside the training center, Gabriel takes some big strides forward, as big as she can get with her tiny frame, and offers up an eruption of a grin. “Heya,
Sam’s about half a foot taller than Cas, but he still looks taken aback by him. Cas can really come off like a drill sergeant, which is both efficient
But long before that, Dean remembers his mom standing with his dad, before the fire took her away, smiling down at Dean in their backyard. “He’s a fighter, like his mom,” Dad had said, and Mary laughed and smacked him affectionately on the shoulder. Dean had beamed up at them because he’d been nothing more than a kid, not knowing that he was accepting the words like a cape around him for the rest of his goddamn life, apparently.
But from that ugly past came his bonds with all of them. As for the future, they’ll face it together. He’s realized of late that a preordained future is overrated, anyway.
“Here in Unova?” Dean wipes away some of the sleepiness from his eyes and sits up on the sofa. “Cas, you gotta be careful. You were the one saying you didn’t want Zack or anyone else to catch you.”
He’s pretty sure that when he went to barbeques and a couple of weekend getaways with Lisa, everyone thought they were just such a
Naomi doesn’t even move in her chair. She merely folds her hands in her lap. It’s creepy. “There isn’t an easy way to say this,” she says. “So I’ll just start by saying I’m little better than Zachariah. He was just cruel, but he didn’t
The smile on Jack’s face vanishes. Worry darkens his expression; it’s a weird look on a kid who hasn’t cracked thirteen years old yet. “I’m not here to taunt you,” he says. He sounds almost – hurt.
She’s trying to scoop under his belly so she can lift him this way, but all it leads to is her making some completely awkward movements, while Grotle shuffles up the stairs at his own pace. She looks absurd.
They sleep in the same bed that night, though they’re too tired to do anything else. Dean tucks Cas into his arms; Cas just makes a pleased noise in response and snuggles his back to Dean’s chest. He puts a streak of warmth up Dean’s front, one that stretches from his throat to his knees.
Okay, so he’s got something against the guy. No one can blame him when the people he probably considered his children are holding back their snarls at his words, Cas especially.
with anyone. But Dean can respect him. He dragged his ass to Opelucid to fight in a battle for the fate of the world. He holds hands with his husband. Even if he wants to dump the entire idea of sentimentality, he’s always been on Dean’s side when it mattered.
“Alright?” Dean echoes, and chuckles as best he can. He’s still catching his breath. “Yeah, I’d say that was –” Talking’s overrated. He finds himself dragging Cas against him and kissing him again. His mouth’s gonna be bruised, and his own come ends up smeared all over his stomach when they rub together so close, and he doesn’t care when it’s this damn amazing.
Jody left out a whole spread for them. Mini-sandwiches Sam can’t stop eating, browning guacamole, hummus, and chips. Right now, though, Alicia Banes is dipping a potato chip into the guacamole, humming a tune to herself as she does. She taps one heel against the other calf, half-swaying and dancing in place to the music only she can hear. She’s so
She screams and jumps back, but the glowing tendril follows her. It’s not quite like a vine, because it’s boxy, but its movements are slow and just as goddamn creepy as something crawling out of the computer screen would suggest.
Dean nods, and gets up from his seat along with Cas. As the two of them leave the room, he catches a glimpse of just how amused Kelly, of all people, looks. Again,
A fucking Steelix. They can grow to hundreds of feet long, and one of them is on the other end of the room from him. Wherever the hell Dean is, it’s gotta be much bigger than some little sideroom in the Edlund nursery.
Hannah smiles too, and it’s remarkable how much their face relaxes at that. “I wouldn’t worry about it now. You’re very likeable.” Cas is weird and blunt and direct, which Dean has come to find super charming at this point. But really, he’s got nothin’ on his sibling.
Cas looks over what’s left of the battlefield, the groups huddled together and the Pokemon and people preventing any of Lucas’ group from leaving. “I think I understand the Brycen-Man plot now,” he concludes, solemnly.
himself to Dean. Powerful as he is, he’s just another wayward soul in this world, looking to dudes just as lost as he is for the way to live.
Cas uses lube that tastes like watermelons, but a way faker, more cloying version. Dean could laugh, because not only is he used to the taste of the lube and its sugary scent, he practically rolled his face in it.
Gabe and Kali paid for everyone to spend four full days at The Seafoam, the resort on Village Bridge. As Gabe’s been gleefully telling them all, “You’d better be nice to me, or I’ll send you to
Delta?” Dean just glares right back. “Fine. No, beating one tiny, pathetic Vulpix –” Charlie makes a broken sound in her throat – “is not how I got my power.”
“I was only going to say,” Castiel speaks up at last, “that your soul is – it’s marked by the places you’ve been. I didn’t understand that until you told me you were in Hell. But I suspect you have been in Heaven, as well as other realms.”
“Got it in one. Look, I’m picking neither to be my BFF, but if I need someone on my side, I’m gonna take Dumbledore.”
Dean doesn’t think he has any pictures with his dad, and the ones with his mom got lost when they moved out of the house in Village Bridge. The last picture with him and Sammy in it, Sam couldn’t have been much more than fifteen. “Isn’t it always the case.”
He goes slow. He’ll slip the button out of its hole, and leave his fingers on the exposed skin, only to kiss and kiss and kiss, and Dean literally can’t remember the last time he took this much time in bed — when he was
Carefully, Dean draws his mouth off Cas’ cock. The tip of it draws a dirty wet line down his cheek and chin when he does that, but he doesn’t care; he flicks out his tongue to taste it, in fact. “This, uh, good?”
For his part, Cas takes it well. “Jolteon,” he says, serenely, like he’s not even embarrassed by Dean in a yellow jumpsuit. In fact, his eyes do a quick flick up Dean’s body that leaves him feeling – well, mostly he feels
Dean just remembers the last bad thing – and he never thought he’d call insatiable sex bad, but he also never would’ve even thought that if he’d ever settle down, it’d be with a dude-shaped angel of the Lord, here – pretty vividly. He just stopped aching, like, a month ago from it.
“You’re tellin’ me,” Dean grumbles. He checks to make sure all the bags are away and everyone else found their car or van, then gets into the Impala. And fuck, he can’t help but
When the van finally stops, they’re still a way out of the city proper. Dean has to blink against the sun’s glare when they all pile out of the van, though Flagstaff and Anna remain in theirs. They’ve all driven up in front of a huge park, and though Dean can see many Pokemon and a couple of people in the distance, what really calls his attention is the sign over the elaborate gate leading inside.
Dean just barely hears the Psywave attack before it strikes him in the head, which might’ve put him out of commission for good, but he ducks quickly. The attack thuds against the wall instead, sending more rock chips spraying from the point of impact.
When Dean blinks awake the next morning, Cas is already sitting up in bed, his body long and lean and the tan of it sweet-looking against the early morning sun. He’s naked, but he’s furiously texting someone.
“That’s all?” Dean asks. He’s exerted and sweaty, he feels it gathering around where his neck dips into his shoulder and along his back, and there’s gross-ass Leviathan splatter over the sleeve of his t-shirt, but all things considered, that wasn’t too bad.
Dean shuts up. This’d be easier if he had like, four more cans of beer to occupy his mouth whenever that and his brain wouldn’t stop spilling out every thought he’d been battering down for months.
Jack either doesn’t notice or ignores the awkwardness from Dean, and nods right back at him. This time, at least, he bothers to finish chewing his bite of cereal before saying, “Hi Dean. I’m actually here to talk to you. And Cas. I just wanted to clarify some stuff.”
kind of hospital uniform kink, embarrassingly enough — and now he gets to mark it out with his lips.
Watching the Woobat settle down to sleep, Dean suddenly notices that his own Pokemon is out of sight. He’s not worried, because she wouldn’t have left the center, but the nursery is huge and there’s still a lot of ground to cover on the floor. Staraptor’s disappeared, too. He turns to Cas and asks, “Where the hell are Vaporeon and Staraptor?”
Cas’ thick cockhead nudges at his entrance a couple of times. Just the tip slips in; they’re both so slippery where they yearn to meet, that was probably inevitable. Then, with one long push, Cas slides all the way home.
right now either. Dean’s the guy who drove as fucking far away as he could from that hospital because he didn’t know how to deal with it.
Jody rushes up to him, already juggling a big fat Bidoof in her arms. She grimaces in apology as she shuffles the enormous chunky baby to one arm in order to shake Dean’s hand.
to me. Or Sam. Or Mom. You wanna help the world, go ahead, but you saved it at least as many times as you messed it up. Think that makes you square.”
When Dean pushes the dildo into Cas, the angel’s entire thigh just – twitches, hard, and his eyes go wide again. Dean likes getting fucked more than he ever thought he would, Cas’ thick thrusts and that moment when the whole thing flips from friction and burn to going awash in pleasure, but he’s never tried anything like this.
Dean tries to smile. It’s not working too well. Even Staraptor’s looking at him with an expression on her face that’s something approaching pity, and if she looks anything other than furious or existentially bored something’s wrong. “It’s alright,” he says, even though it’s – not, really. He’s not even thinking about himself, but about Castiel, about why in the world he wouldn’t
Cas moves to bracket Dean’s legs with his own. The ring etched into his shoulder always made Dean feel tougher, like no matter what happened he could get through it okay. Cas warm against his side fills him with the same feeling. Cas might not remember what happened, and even though that will never stop gnawing at Dean, his presence here is another hot, tangible reminder.
attitude to anyone too familiar with those stories; calling this place a castle seems like a mockery of the word. The palace is a hideous mass of spikes, crumbling to pieces but still nasty enough to promise a horrible death to anyone who gets too close. Grace oozes from the cracks, a slimy neon blue stream lighting up the building.
Dean takes a couple of seconds to parse what she said, and then – “Uh, excuse me, what are you saying –”
, and she’s totally right, but Dean doesn’t wanna hear it right now. Dean’s sure Delta wouldn’t respond, and he’s not going to spill his guts to the girl who spends most of the day brooding. Jody and Tessa are his bosses and therefore out of the question. That leaves Benny.
“The hell do you mean?” Dean knows he sounds a bit too hostile, especially with Charlie, but when you’ve got an Eevee evolution as your partner Pokemon, you hear way too much about Pokemon evolution and how it
Sam pokes at some dubious-looking grapefruit, when he’s not pouting rather pathetically at Dean and then looking away half a second after Dean catches him. Dean should tell him to
Lucas’ Hydreigon flies by him not long after. She’s counterattacking Dean’s allies in the area, sending them flying back with long tendrils of tar-black energy; there’s no doubt she’s a supremely well-trained Pokemon. But her movements are so unnatural, herky-jerky, like she’s nothing but a wind-up toy. Something’s just missing from her. Dean wishes he could find some way to give it back.
you so much. I’ve seen the way the Flying-types react when you get into the aviary at work. You wanted to make sure Claire was alright the first time we saw her, and I bet you’re trying to come up with some way to make sure she and that Tracy girl are okay now. Hell, you
“We’re taking Anna,” Cas says, walking up behind Dean and putting a hand on his shoulder. Dean places his own hand over it. “I’d take Gabe as well, because she’s the one who
These past couple of years, Dean’s been drinking like your average hunter. That ain’t healthy, and he knows it, but at least it’s not the way he used to be, when he clung to booze like the only lifeline he had. The year with the Leviathans, and Sam seeing Lucifer everywhere, and Cas gone and then crazy, and Bobby gone and then
“Nah, you know I like those.” He returns the hint of a smile. “Not a response like that, I guess. A lecture. Or you tellin’ me everything’s gonna be okay. It’s… not. Or it’s gonna be a while before it is. Maybe never.”
interest in him and his Scizor because of this. He bolted and went off the grid with the rest of them.
And then they’re both half in each others’ laps, Dean slowly grinding his hips, and when the denim between Dean’s legs pushes up against the dark fabric holding Castiel’s erection back Castiel puffs out a breath. “I’m very aroused, Dean,” he whispers. He doesn’t mean for his voice to be that low; it just seems to have slipped to a deeper register.
Dean gets distracted by a hard poke on his arm. Meg. “Ow,” he snaps, rubbing at the place where she more or less smacked him.
Plus, even if his rep flees him, he’s pretty sure he’s still badass enough to kick the ass of anyone who cares.
“The way you grew up,” Dean says, swiftly grabbing the pot of coffee once Cas downs the last dredges of it in his cup, “it’d make anyone –”
“Yes.” Dean can’t help but dig a hand into Cas’ hair, still all messed up from being used as a goddamn handle and then getting pressed into a pillow for a few hours, as he walks by him on his way to tug some clothes back on. He honestly thinks about putting Cas’ panties on when he sees them all crumpled up in a corner, but that’s too grody even for him. He’ll just borrow some later, and the thought makes a big stupid grin crack over his face.
He exhales a very long breath, but keeps staring at his beer bottle. For someone who normally meets Dean’s gaze so readily, so openly, it’s notable.
Cas is unnaturally stiff, of course, but it’s easy to relax against him. Dean’s slept on stone floors and rotting floorboards. After that, Cas’ shoulder is nothing. It might as well be thousand-count sheets. The trenchcoat even smells like clean laundry, probably from the hospital.
Anna walks out the door, brisk and purposeful. She covers the ground from Naomi’s desk to the door quickly enough that Dean wonders if she’s borrowing her Latias powers for a boost.
Dean chuffs out a laugh at that one. He pulls his gaze away from Cas to look out at the scene in front of him. Everywhere, families and friends reunite with each other. There are a lot of tears, enormous and completely lacking self-consciousness. Pokemon dart around the floor, playing with each other or otherwise snuggling up to their owners. A lot of them look pretty haggard, Pokemon and humans alike, and exhaustion sags throughout the room.
Sam pulls back. “A lot,” he says at last. Dude’s fucking misty-eyed. Dean would call him a sap, only he’s pretty sure he’s in the same state. “My life? Thanks.” Dean wants to protest, but after a blink, Sam’s eyes are clearer and he’s shoving Dean by the shoulder and grinning. Friggin’ little brothers. “Ugh, Dean, you’re so full of shit sometimes. That case with the freaky nachzehrers –”
people having a complicated relationship with his father, but his parents were involved in a whole damn world Dean didn’t know about.
If Dean had any hope that Castiel was there for only a couple of days for some kind of community service or somethin’, that hope’s quickly put to rest, because Castiel is there at the center the next day too. And that’s what Dean had very, very secretly been hoping for the whole time.
“This ain’t the way,” Dean says, voice low and practically deadly. “You wanna be great, you keep being who you are. Or
“Not for that,” Cas says in return, smiling all the way. Dean feels the anticipation zip through him. Of what, he doesn’t know, but he’s opening his mouth to speak again when another person they know approaches them.
In the next beat, they’re kissing. Dean’s thought about this so many times, in so many ways, from some totally humiliating butterfly kisses to Cas shoving him into a wall after a hunt that nearly went bad with the two of them all dirty and bloody and reeking. One of his favorite fantasies, though, was right here, on his bed. And now he
The lake stretches in front of them, then, almost as if it popped in out of nowhere. Aren’t they nowhere themselves, really? Is any of this real? Dean snorts. Probably better not to think about it.
Amy nods, goes in, and comes out about five minutes later with Nancy trailing behind her. Nancy looks a little more approachable now – she ditched the secretary-wannabe getup for jeans and a white t-shirt – but her eyes are still enormous, and she walks with one hand on her Aurorus for support.
He might have been young, and it might have been almost ten years ago, but he knows he loved Cassie, her wild hair and quick smile and fascination with the world even in tiny, quiet Village Bridge. But she didn’t have a Pokemon – they were nineteen, and most people got their Pokemon at twenty, it was normal – and John didn’t like Dean sneaking off to spend time with her, so Dean found himself
Sam’s eyebrows lift into his hairline. “Nothing.” Dean must shoot him a look after that, because he adds, “Really.”
Virizion takes one last long look at Dean, and then bounds off into the fray. Thigh-length grass sprouts up in her wake, sharp-bladed. The tips of it glitter in the sun. Dean wouldn’t wanna walk through it.
Dean could be weirded out by this level of physical affection. But he’s always welcomed Vaporeon’s, her gentle forehead bumps against his hands and calves and even his own forehead when she could manage. The touch of her tail to his leg reminds him, every day, that he’s not alone. So he’s a little overwhelmed with all this attention. It’s a good type of overwhelmed.
“Fuck me,” Dean moans, letting his legs open, easy. There might have been a time he was ashamed of doing that, but not with Cas. Not ever with Cas, who still touches him like a precious thing. Not something delicate, Cas knows better than that, but something, someone, with a lot of value.
“No.” Cas would know that anyway, but Dean doesn’t mind saying it as he urges him down carefully. Now they’re connected, skin-to-skin, from mid-chest to hips. Cas had kissed Dean while they were falling into this bed, getting undressed, and Dean expects another kiss now, but all Cas does is smile up at him, close-mouthed but warm. He’d fumbled his hand around Dean’s dick while he was getting his pants off, and remade his body from nothing, but this feels more intimate than anything that came before it.
Kali and Gabriel chart what’s more or less a yacht to take everyone over to Village Bridge. Kali looks gorgeous, the white of her sari making her skin pop, and Gabriel dressing up in a sailor pin-up outfit complete with hot pants is pretty much the least surprising thing ever.
Dean tries to summon up his anger at Cas, how he can just go on acting like nothing happened outside the mall, but there’s a blank where that anger pitched and roiled inside him just earlier that week. That is, until Dean catches Benny smirking in his direction. Damn traitor.
On the other side of the call, Claire finds herself staring at the phone, too, at least until the shower shuts off and Abigail comes out of the bathroom, one towel wrapped around herself and the other in her hands, furiously scrubbing at her hair. “I can’t believe you have the
Mary knows it’s the last night she can spend here, so she’s going to spend it around the campfire with the rest of the group. Campfires aren’t a great idea, not here, and every time they set one up she swears she sees the dark hulking figures in the distance move closer. But she needs the company.
Amber flashes from behind Dean. The waves lick the shore. His knees ache like hell. Distantly, he knows he should care about all of this.
(Dean’s still kind of mad he had to pay for the vending machine in that hotel in Delaware just because Cas kicked a hole in it when he found out they were all out of Raisinets. Totally Cas’ fault, not his. And who the fuck ruins a vending machine over Raisinets? Cas is a goddamn weirdo.)
“You’d think a chick involved in seriously illegal activity wouldn’t be so eager to ask everyone what their hobbies are,” Dean says, desperate to change the topic.
The double-sided dildo joins the other toys on the floor – man, Dean is real fucking glad for angelic clean-up – and he moves between Cas’ legs. He’s grinning like a moron, which is gonna be embarrassing when he comes in three thrusts, but he can’t help it when he’s got all this skin on display in front of him and there’s
“I know enough.” What Mary went through the past year, maybe no one can understand. But Jody lost her husband, her kid. Worse: she lost her kid, got him back, then lost him again. Every day Mary’s alive, John’s absence feels like a phantom limb, but the idea of losing Sam or Dean was enough to make her jam a gun against her temple and ready her finger at the trigger. “But you probably know more about me. When we met – that’s a big part of why I’m here. And I’m sorry for that. It’s – not to say it’s right. It isn’t. But every hunter knows everything about everyone, seems like.”
“Is there anything you don’t know about me and my brother?” He’s somehow smiling when he says it, though. He figures that’s a good sign.
“It’s been a good visit!” Jack announces, seemingly oblivious to the emotional atom bomb he’s dropped right in the middle of the bunker. “I’ll be back to visit too. Cas, call my mom, it’s hard to make friends –”
Cas scrunches up his nose. Dean would estimate it’s half out of confusion, half severe embarrassment at coming out of the kitchen to find his sister sucking face on the webcam. “I didn’t know Anna was dating anyone.”
“Yeah,” he comes up with, at last, exaggerating his yawn. Too late to pry into his deepest emotional depths, clearly. (Yeah, and so’s five-thirty AM, if he’s being honest.) “I should go get some sleep.”
“It’s me, Cas,” is all Dean can say. “It really is, and Sam, and uh, Anna too, and it’s been a while – but not really, actually – just –” He shuts up, for the most part. “C’mon.”
undereducated compared to your brother –” and at the mention of Sam, Dean’s breath does a funny ruddered thing, because what if there’s a way worse, all but unthinkable, reason why Dean hasn’t been able to get in touch with him other than inter-region communications being fucked right now – “but do you know why Pokemon and humans are able to live on the same planet? We certainly don’t have the brawn, and compared to most of the Psychic types, we don’t even have the brains.
There are the dreams where every monster he’s ever sent to its bitter end, and some he hasn’t, creep out from behind the trees and rip him limb from limb. It doesn’t even hurt, it just feels like dissolving, but he still wakes up more wrecked than usual. His mom appears and holds out her hands to him, only she’s got claws that tangle inside his skin, and her smile is a wolf’s. He’s surrounded by demons, only they’re not attacking, and it takes him too many hours of plunging through the darkness to realize that’s because he’s one of them and just as thirsty to rip the whole goddamn place apart as they are.
,” Dean grunts, fumbling through all the crap they packed into the back of the SUV like there’s a hidden holster and gun in there for him, too.
“Oh, and Dean? If – when – you get him back. Those emotions I could feel? Maybe talk to him about them.”
all the time after a little while. A few years later, he found himself in the same situation with a girl named Lisa – fell fast, fell hard, fell the fuck away when John started expressing disapproval about it.
Dean hadn’t seen Zachariah in person before. He’d been in questioning when Dean got to the police station, but Anna had insisted on going in and talking to him, after a very animated chat with Linda beforehand. She came out shaking, but told them all, “I said my piece,” her tone gone gray. Uriel held out his arms to her, and she slipped into them; she didn’t move away for a very long time.
That doesn’t happen, though. All that does is the glance Meg is shooting Dean turns into her usual smirk. “Oh, what happens in Purgatory stays in Purgatory? I get it.”
“Bunch of people, actually. Sarah, obviously, and you saw Claire already. Her mom’s, um, pretty gone, though. Remember Tamara, Bobby’s old friend from the case with the Seven Deadly Sins? Her, too. Jody Mills is in charge of the parts of camp that I’m not, I guess.” Dean has to smile at that; he always liked her. “Gabby cloaks us and when she’s got time she hacks all the major sites to try and warn people, but in most cases it’s already too late.”
The hug’s her first sign of human kindness in what might have been a decade. It’s the first time she’s talked to another human for something other than stomach-churning war intel in years. Mary breathes into it, letting it settle into her bones. Kindness, warmth, family. Humanity. Such things do still exist.
Cas nods, and – oh, fuck, he’s totally trying to hold back a grin. “I also cleaned your car, and brought the duffel along.” His voice is rough, and the room might be nice, but the smell of Cas’ heat is everywhere now, no matter how casually he tries to flip through the book.
“Whirlwind, Staraptor,” he orders. An enormous gust of wind tears through the area, spewing dirt. It’s hard enough to send the passed-out Graveler rolling down the hill. Some of the goons attempt to flee, but it isn’t any use. They practically spray through the air and land with heavy thuds on the ground. Most of them don’t move once they’ve hit the dirt, which brings grim satisfaction to Dean.
They honestly don’t own all that much shit, but moving all of it to Village Bridge still takes way too much time. Months, as it turns out. Only because Cas insists on doing it the old-fashioned way, and the old-fashioned way involves lots of slow-moving boats.
They all raise their glasses – Anna’s got a skinny champagne flute, Uriel a stout whiskey tumbler, and Cas and Hannah both have ceramic mugs – and echo Anna’s words. A quiet passes over the table; Dean tries his best to offer silent condolences when he meets eyes with any of Cas’ siblings. He gets it more than they can imagine; the loss of Sam burns inside him, as boiling and unwanted as a lump of lit coal in his guts.
Over toast, Dean tells her, “Mom, I – I never welcomed you back. Hardly ever asked how you were. Never even said thanks –”
“I appreciate that,” is all Dean says in return. It’s an understatement, but judging by the way Mary reaches out, squeezes his hand, and meets his eyes, she understands his meaning completely.
“Oh, but I am Arceus’ gift,” Lucas tells her, with a chuff of laughter. Dean wants to wipe the sound off the face of the earth. “A legendary Pokemon in human form, put here? I
“Garth went home,” Sam tells him. Dean makes a noise of acknowledgement and leans back, eyes closed. “Did you – mean all of that – I mean – Cas, you haven’t said anything about him since – I don’t even know what happened –”
“Nothing like that,” Naomi continues. “There’s something you need to see. It’s a bit of a ride, but the hotel lent me a large van.” Of course they did. This place is nuts. “I’d prefer if it was just you and your brother, though I suspect you won’t settle for that.”
“It was bad enough when I had to pull Garth — what became of him — away, man,” Sam tells Dean, once he’s standing up. And — shit, yeah, Dean hasn’t seen Garth at all, has he? Fuck. Dean’s gaze flicks toward the ground, unable to meet Sam’s, because God knows what the hell the guy’s been dealing with these past years.
“I know, it’s kinda cringe-worthy,” she explains, fingers moving quickly across her keyboard. The girl doesn’t even have a cabin, just a nice wooden floor with a tent set up around it, and she’s still got all this wireless, solar-powered cloaking shit, not to mention her other computer stuff. If Dean didn’t already feel perpetually inferior, Gabby’d be good for doing that. “I’m soooo not a Gabby, I don’t think. Just, Gabriel defeats the Leviathan in the Bible, so —”
not so much to get an answer, but because he couldn’t understand why an angel would look at him the way Cas did, like Cas had seen pink bursts of coral in the ocean and the cold flare of every star coming into existence alike, he’d seen the whole fucking universe, but he hadn’t ever seen anything like Dean. He never could.
There are a couple of the giant four-legged babies crawling around what had been the reception area, their pitch-black skin oily under the light. He’d be freaked, only Anna told him they were harmless, and a couple of them even stuck around her camp; the things got
Naomi offers an uncomfortable shrug. “I’m sorry I’m the one to tell you this, but she did both. She took care of all the Pokemon she could, but your mom was smart; she was practical. I admired that. She knew something was coming. She trained that Leafeon a lot.”
Dean’s at war with his own damn feelings. There’s the Heatran’s lair-hot betrayal, shame simmering behind it, that Cas would try to pretend it never happened. At the same time, Dean has to bat away that stupid, stupid,
when there was training to be done. Dean had a first-row seat to his dad’s life slowly seeping out because he’d lost his own love; he learned, quick, it was best not to get involved or attached at all.
“You don’t have to tell me that.” Dean pushes himself up and out of his chair, and leaves the room. He wishes he could leave his feelings like that too, held down by chains, in the dark and the quiet where only he’d have to deal with them.
“Let’s do this,” he mutters to Staraptor on his shoulder, voice still shaking while he does it. She lets out one long caw, loud enough to shake the branches on the trees.
Until she looks down and the toe of her boot nudges a sharp black mark on the ground. Her stomach swoops, a one-two punch of fury and a deep, deep sadness, and it’s real again.
Dean takes a few careful steps forward. “Thanks,” he says at last, to the quiet woods, hoping the winds can pick his words up and carry them an impossible distance.
But then Cas throbs, deep and wet. It reminds Dean that they’re bare skin against bare skin, and he’s never done it like this before. The squirm fades away to honeyed lava, gathered right in his gut.
“Claire, hey,” he says. Any attempt at hiding the sadness woven deep into his voice would be pointless right now. “I should have called you, but… I didn’t know what to say. We really fucked up. I’m sure you know. Uh – sorry – but God, Claire, I don’t even know what to say. We lost your dad. Years ago, but I never said anything about that, and I’m sorry. And then we lost –”
The place felt perfect, before. But that’s not quite right, Dean realizes now. The place isn’t perfect. The place is a home.
Charlie hasn’t even touched her black and white cookie, which is how Dean knows it’s serious. “Have you talked to him?” At this point, Dean’s talked to Charlie about damn near everything. They’ve talked about
Despite himself, Dean chuckles at that. “Sam just wanted to blend in, and everyone at his school was talking about how the only kid with a Pokemon in their class was using it to read their minds. Kids.”
“I wanted to see you come with my body,” Cas tells him, riding Dean’s hips as he lets him fuck into his fist, “and my grace.”
He motions to Cas, Sam, and their Pokemon. “We got work to do,” he tells them. Vaporeon’s still hoisted in his arms. It’s gonna be hard to let her go.
would tell me it was okay to feel what I did. My life was always pretty messed up, but that, I didn’t mind so much.”
They spend a pretty long night with Sam trying to fix Cas’ coat, and Dean making fun of him because every time he tries to coat the edges with super glue or something, it just dissolves away. Cas keeps pouting, and doesn’t say much.
Dean’s freaked, of fucking course Dean is freaked, there are giant scaly babies crawling through the undergrowth on all fours, crouched like they’re going to attack. They’ve been trailing them for hours now, or maybe a year; he’s tired of the time-fucks.
. Dean has to tell himself, too many times, that it’s just a blowjob. He’s done them before, he loves them and he’s fuckin’ great at them. Just a blowjob. That’s all.
“Hardly,” Sam says with a snort. “I know Cas sounded like a televangelist when we first met him, but at least he talked. This guy, he’s like alternative Cas or something.”
It fades when he sees the pictures, though. Dean doesn’t even recognize some of the figures in the shots as human, at first. They’re bloated lumps of skin and ripped and ill-fitting clothing, flopped on their backs across lawns that are overgrown and choked with weeds and dead leaves. “Shit,” is all he can murmur.
A Glalie spins through the air, right up to Dean. There’s a keen, vicious look in her eyes. Definitely shouldn’t have taken the bait. Glalie’s mouth drops open, and an enormous mist cloud trickles out. It’s white and looks almost fuzzy in the dark air of the cave.
“Whoah,” Dean gasps, feeling Cas’ fingers brush against his wrist as a caution to pull him back. “This looks — uh. Not good?”
Realization dawns on Dean’s face, a beautiful light through his tired visage. “Just thought it was my tape,” Dean murmurs as he flips it back and forth in his hands a couple of times. He chuckles, even more endearing than usual in his sleep-rough tone. “Nice title.”
Dean understands that too. More than anyone, he’s pretty sure. It’s been a couple of years since John was laid to rest, at last, and Dean still feels the stamp of him all over in almost every damn thing he does. He still walks like he’s trying to impress him; he still dresses in the plaid and boots John kept them in like a uniform. Even with his tattoos meaning what they do to him, he still feels stupidly ashamed of them, because John hated them. Bitterness wells in his mouth when he thinks of his dad, but he still
This Snorlax has needle teeth and a too-alert face. Dean really doesn’t like the red, squiggly veins he can see in those eyes of his. This is no natural Snorlax. But he doesn’t have much time to think about it, because he it
Meg’s gaze snaps over to something far less – well, predatory. “Well then. Damn my unimpeachable morals!” she mock-cries, and they all laugh.
There’s no time to get the gun ready, so Mary grabs her own sword. There’s another flicker of disbelief on the angel’s face.
“No.” It’s like Sam can’t meet anyone’s eyes today, and there are a few more seconds of truly awkward silence, which is fucking weird with
She brushes off the front of her jeans, and more or less marches away. The door rattles on its hinges when she slams it. Okay. Point taken.
And his other friends are total badasses too. Dean wonders if he should like college kids this much. Jake practically crushes his fingers when they shake hands, and tells him he was really into krav maga and thought about joining the army for a bit before he realized he didn’t want to put his Medicham through all of that. “It helps,” he adds, “that I thought the world was as safe as it was gonna get.” He snorts. “Imagine that.”
He wonders about the type of people who stay up way too late – Dean’s sleep schedule is fucked anyway, he figures, cheerfully relishing the excuse – just to chop up Vaporeon’s weird, stinky seaweed treats. Or the type of people who end up playing fetch with her, even while it’s ink-black outside and the only noise Dean can hear are Vaporeon’s paws squeaking across the floor and their combined laughter. He wonders if those kind of people belong, but he’s been judged enough times to know that
Once, Cas knocked Bobby out with a touch and stared blankly at his prone form on the ground. Now, he’s this, cut off from Heaven and wearing hospital scrubs, full of all this shit he was never supposed to even know about except as a warning. Half-pacifist and half-crazy, and still Cas.
“Your boy’s a good one,” Flagstaff tells Dean later. “Tipped me off that the fuzz was after these two. I might’ve stepped in.”
“Angels gotta have a vessel. Some poor sucker they occupy and then, when they’re done – I’ve seen what happens. Brain-dead and drooling, and that’s if they’re lucky. In your dimension, you guys’d probably love it.”
It’s a weird thought, but his mind can’t help but picture sunny days with Vaporeon splashing in the sea, and Staraptor flying overhead, pretending to be above it all but not-so-secretly loving every moment of it. Him and Cas holding hands together, watching it all happen. They’re there.
Castiel doesn’t know what to say. It’s not really alright, but it’s not Dean’s fault either. It is, but it isn’t. In many ways, he was the cause, but Castiel was the one who stepped into that warehouse and pushed his sword through Alon’s throat, and felt little remorse when he saw his Grace splinter and explode. Dean did not push him, or grip his wrists and push them down. Instead of trying to express that, Castiel just nods, stiffly.
“Dean!” a voice calls out, not long after he’s walked away from Marowak, who’s stalked away to roam the fields with her herd of Cubone behind her. He’s happy she’s alright, sure, but he can’t say he’s thrilled that Naomi found him.
Honestly, Dean has to fight the urge to fucking straddle his face and get his dick in that pink, shiny mouth. Maybe a leg thrown over his shoulder, his toes squished into the Impala’s upholstery, Cas’ desperate little breaths that he doesn’t need to take hot against his balls. Maybe later.
“I don’t care about any of that,” Dean says, at last. “I’m a mess. I’m twenty-eight and I still miss my mom, every day. Don’t think any of what you said was true, but – so what if they were. You’re not
with its multitude of bright neon displays highlighting big, drippy burritos while he tries to ignore that he hasn’t had a decent meal in a couple of days.
All that flies through the air from Dean’s hand, though, is Dean’s wallet, and his keyring. The keys glitter as they pick up the sun, and that stupid key from his dad catches the light too hard. Dean’s tired, so tired, worn out to his bones, and all he can do is twist his head away from the glare of it.
Dean slides his arms over Cas’ stomach. His shirt’s in the way, but he’s still warm there, and Dean feels the little quiver pulse through Cas’ body. Cas does the same to him a beat later, and it’s awkward with both of their bulk. At least until their arms braid together, and then – why did they ever do anything else? “Don’t think it was much of a surprise for Sam either. He’s had a front row seat to all our shit. As far as the liking dudes part, he walked in on me getting Eiffel Towered once. That’s, uh –”
Cas, and they’ve still got the specter of that night outside Shopping Mall Nine casting a long shadow over them. Here he is, though, telling Cas shit he couldn’t even manage to tell Sam.
“No,” Haley said, shooting Dean a pointed look. “Though I don’t think I’d remember news I heard about some random guy, weird name aside.”
, ever again, but fuck he missed food. “Heard a lot about you. You’re lucky to have a brother who cares so much. A freakin’ angel, too, apparently.”
When Cas was in the bunker and not holed up watching Netflix, he spent a lot of his time sitting up on the top of the slope. From this vantage point, there’s nothing but long stretches of golden field and gnarled trees, as far as the eye can see. The sky, beautiful and deadly at once, it’s a better memorial to him than Dean could ever offer.
“If it will protect me,” he says, eventually, “then yes.” The tiny part of him that’s still angelic, somehow, craves the word. Castiel relishes the shape of
She’s right; Dean doesn’t even pretend not to love the hell out of the Pokemon shelter at Edlund. He loves the long days where pretty much all he does is shovel shit – it’s gross, but someone’s gotta do it – just as much as he loves the days when he watches the Litleo kittens take their first shaky steps. He loves outright cuddling the baby Cubone, and hell, he even loves working hellish 24-hour shifts and overnights, even when the nocturnal Murkrow chicks who can’t even walk yet screech through the whole damn night.
“Cas, hey.” Dean gathers him against his side. Cas is aware they can’t really get closer, but the way the two of them have been touching each other since Cas returned from the other universes, even before they were sexually intimate – if there was some way they could fold the other into their physical forms, Cas is fairly sure the two of them would have done it already. “We don’t have to talk about that.”
to remembering. Leafeon were very powerful Pokemon, and Mary’s in particular had a whole shelf of trophies and droopy ribbons from tournaments decades in the past, but by the time Sam and Dean came around, Mary’s Leafeon was a docile creature who spent most of his time napping in sunspots on the lawn. Sam and Dean were usually able to poke Zebstrika into a good mood, too.
“You tell me a lot,” Castiel says. Without judgment, for once. “Loyalty, that I understand. Even in the universe I come from, it saved me more than I’d like to admit. I don’t want to rely on anyone, but my brothers and sisters –”
The world smells like dust and sour beer and sweat and sex, all of it mixed with the acrid scent of Dean’s permanent marker. Castiel wants to
“Where is –” Mary cringes. She doesn’t want to say what she has to. “Where’s Cas? Did you – I know he was an angel, but I hope you gave him a hunter’s funeral. I didn’t know him like you did, but he – he deserved that. Kelly too.”
“Not a bit,” Dean murmurs. It’s a wonder he can still flip the eggs. Cas stays practically attached to his waist, which is objectively totally weird. Over his shoulder isn’t much of a vantage point, either. But Dean doesn’t mind it one bit. The kitchen’s painted a cheery yellow to match the egg yolks, it smells good in the room with the sizzling bacon and eggs, and Cas’ hands are so warm. He’s wanted them in way more places than just skimming over his t-shirt, anyway.
“Dude, were you going to eat all of these?” Dean asks when they’ve finished. He pats his belly and belches, because he’s a charmer like that. Cas is still giving him what Charlie would gleefully call
This dildo is stupidly bubblegum pink, because of course he couldn’t find any other colors, and long and wobbly in his hand. Dean tears his underwear off, more or less, because fuck it, he can get new ones if Cas can’t clean them off. And
now, Dean realizes, and he can’t help but let a proprietary older-brother grin tick up his lip at that despite everything else that’s gong on. “We, uh, got along pretty good from the start. And we were of age, so… we might’ve decided to try and get into Carver together.”
“I can help?” Dean approaches her, but she waves out with a hand that smacks Dean across the chest, so sharp and so surprising that he actually stumbles backwards a step or two. “Or not.”
made Dean freeze, because he remembered the last time he heard Cas use that. Guy had been beaten down, a shell of his former self. That Castiel smiled too, but it was a bitter smile, one with all the hope leeched out of it.
They aren’t. Someone strides forward. His face catches the light enough that even from the distance, Dean can actually make out his features.
Of course, Umbreon are good, loyal, tough as hell Pokemon, and Sam knows it too. But the Winchesters were already freaks; Dean just didn’t want Sam to be the freak kid with the Dark type to boot.
Dean isn’t gonna admit it, but he needs Cas. It’s messy and fucked-up and he should really look into getting some relationships in his life that aren’t freaky co-dependent, but it’s true. He needs him to clamp a hand over his eyes and walk behind Dean, hands on his shoulders or hips to keep him steady (Dean remembers that personal space lecture from years ago, and
The two of them nod. Tracy’s Rampardos glowers at Dean from over her shoulder, practically daring him to not let them go.
“I am not a barrel and laughter was not permitted very often where I come from,” Castiel says, stiff as new jeans. Dean’s heart rate spikes; the words remind Dean of Cas, even if the tone is all wrong.
Somehow, it’s not all that surprising when Chuck shows up at the camp. The place feels like an episode of
“Lemme do all the work,” he says to Cas, kissing under his chin. He rolls his hips, making gorgeous noises as he goes. Cas tilts his legs and groin best he can, wanting to give Dean the best angle, and Dean makes a gorgeous stuttered breath and orgasms all over the sheets and between Cas’ legs alike.
without freaking out; in fact, tucking that knowledge away for later has proven pretty goddamn awesome.
When he’s halfway in the doorway, though, he turns around. Cas is still looking at him, his Staraptor’s wings beating heavy in the air. Sure, the staring’s kind of creepy, but Dean’s the one who turned around to look too.
Dean’s understandably not thinking of that, though, which is why it’s such a surprise when he practically gets a faceful of Woobat turning a corner.
“Why do you keep coming back? Your brother, your mother, I see them here sometimes. You could stop coming down yourself. Surely there must be other people you know outside your immediate family –”
him. She does, even if she’s grumbling all the way, and glaring at the shadowy figure harder than Dean is. “Best Pokemon there is.”
“Feels good, Cas,” Dean breathes. He angles his hips away, because he’s pretty sure the second they touch between waist and knees, he’s gonna go off like a rocket.
Charlie returns his smile with her own. “Alright, I’ll concede the point. Look who else I finagled into coming! You’re gonna be
“Vaporeon,” he finds himself saying today. Now that he’s done talking to Bobby and Rufus, he only feels worse about being all but alone in Opelucid. She pulls herself out of the water, and doesn’t look too pitying at him calling her back. He appreciates it.
So there’s Cas. Dude can still teleport and chatters along with Inais in Enochian, but his nostrils are all inflamed red and he scratches at spots on his arm or chest with trepidation, clearly not used to that particular movement and interplay of muscles. Dean tosses him tissues when he’s in Gabby’s tent, trying to figure out the Leviathans’ movement across America, and they both shoot him a smile. It’s freaky big, in Cas’ case.
“And it can’t be Leviathan, because Gabby seriously wired this place up to let us know if any chomper figured out the cloaking system and gets within the perimeters,” Sam sighs. “So basically… we’re screwed until we figure this one out.”
Cas holds Castiel’s memories close to him. He wishes, so badly, that Dean wasn’t in such anguish when he said the things he did, but those days are past them now and it’s a wonder to roll his words over and over in his mind.
Of course. Sam didn’t recognize her with the new haircut, and – Krissy always had an attitude, but this is different. This is
. He knows Bobby’s gruffness is seriously like, the ultimate sign of his love, anyway. Like, if Bobby started doing anything other than one-armed hugs, that’s when Dean would get concerned. Also, maybe it’s kind of weird that he doesn’t even feel the need to protest over the
The TV screen shows the fight again. Tracy smacks Thaddeus right in the face with the back of her hand, and he wrenches away, a surprising amount of blood gushing from his nose. Hawlucha immediately abandons her fight with Rampardos to check on her trainer. Cas watches it all, and gnaws on his lip a little.
“Got no idea what she’s talking about, but she has a point,” Benny says. Slowly, everyone around them nods.
“When she can. Kind of busy, you know?” Even behind Alex’s smile, her eyes are incredibly sad. Mary isn’t surprised. Not like it’s rare in this line of living. “She’s the most amazing person I’ve ever met. I owe her so much, but – it can’t be easy for her.” Alex swings her legs back and forth, keeping her eyes tightly focused on her knees now. “I don’t know how much you know. Probably not fair for me to talk about it.”
Cas doesn’t keep touching between Dean’s legs, though. Instead, he’s tugging Dean down, until he’s flat on his back on the bed. And then his tongue is on Dean’s stomach, rubbing his cheek against it in a stupidly affectionate gesture. Dean almost laughs, but then Cas chooses that time to rub his thumbs against Dean’s nipples and the laugh breaks into a moan. Dean stuffs his hand over his mouth.
But as Cas pushes his palm against the werewolf's head and smites the poor bastard, it digs iron-colored claws into the tan fabric and
Dean wants to give his dad half-credit for disapproving of Aaron in the exact same way he disapproved of everyone else, at least. Kept telling Dean not to bother with any of that
“Cleaning staff doesn’t come around until one,” Dean murmurs. It’s just after ten AM, and they don’t leave for Opelucid again for another ten hours. “Want me to go check it out?”
But even though Castiel was literally inside Jimmy, sinking under his skin and putting his nerves alight, Dean’s sure Cas never dug into Jimmy the way he’s dug into him. He can’t have knocked Jimmy as off-center the way he’s done to Dean; Cas punches this feeling into him like Dean ran a marathon with a hellhound at his heels and sank into a big comfy chair, the type he never owned, at once. It can’t be.
Small talk seems to have become a skill that doesn’t come to Dean any more — God, it used to be so fucking easy to go to a bar and talk to whoever about the weather or
“What we did,” Cas says, and just the vague mention of it is enough to put a shiver through Dean’s body even through the sleepiness. “Was that all you want to do, was that all you want to do with me –”
Even a city as busy as Opelucid is quiet this early in the morning, in these hours where the sky goes wisteria. All the night workers already went home, and the day workers haven’t headed out yet. He’ll see someone every now and then, but almost invariably, the other person ducks their head and rushes the Pokemon beside them along, like they’re embarrassed to be up this early.
Cas, for his part, just nods briefly. He’s shifted a lot through this conversation, Staraptor clucking in dissatisfaction when he does, but Dean brushes it off. He’s a weird guy. “My brother lives there. I’m sure you’ve met him. Uriel?”
Sam blinks. “Dean, out of all the crap we’ve been through, that is absolutely the worst thing you’ve ever said to me.”
, but he’s too drained to be spiteful. It’s not even the slimmest of bandaids for his grief, and he knows that. All he says is “Excuse me” instead, and he disappears into a small shack a little ways beyond the crowd.
They’ve moved on — and that’s not a bad thing. They’ve moved on to something bigger and better than what they were. Dean’s still awed by Cas, in a way, but it’s because Cas has seen all of him, knows what a moron he is and everything, and he’s sticking around. Not only that, the guy keeps coming back. Like nothing Dean’s ever known, Cas gives him faith, and he doesn’t know why the hell an angel chose him and never will, but he thinks he’s giving Cas faith too. It still shakes him to his very core, and he needs those hands tracing over his body, those lips on his own, to remind him of it, but it’s there.
Cas pushes his pasta around his plate with a fork for a few seconds after. Dean’s wondering if they really are going to drop the whole thing, until he speaks up. “I worked as a trainer at Naomi Malach’s gym –”
They need a goddamn miracle. Another one, as if a super powerful Pokemon and a trainer who clearly knows what he’s doing doesn’t count.
said that,” Cas returns, with humor. “I’ve still got no idea where any of it came from. It was all instinct.”
“Certain legendary Pokemon can and do take a human form. You and your sister, you are – well, you’re you. But you also happen to be Latios and Latias.”
who’s the wayward sister,” she declares triumphantly as Whimsicott and Pidgeot chase each other around the perimeter of the room. “And darling Charlie,” she says, tossing a floppy disk in her direction.
Mary always said Virizion was her favorite Pokemon. She loved to garden, and she loved Grass-types; when she found baby Budew or Sunkern, little more than seeds, she’d uproot them carefully to other Pokemon-friendly patches of grass, as opposed to getting rid of them entirely. She watched Hoppip take their first wobbly flights.
Dean doesn’t know how the hell he’s able to laugh, but he does anyway. The sky’s blue and calm, and Dean grins up at it despite the awful sun glare.
Charlie grumbles about having to haul in outside supplies, but she does have a floppy disk reader, and she starts tapping away at her keyboard not long after that. “Here we go,” Charlie says, after about ten minutes of work. Dean’s not sure what changed; the same lines of white and green text keep whirring down the screen.
he really hopes he’s not limping at all, but he’s still too blissed out to give a shit. He just hopes Meg doesn’t actually eat Cas alive when the guy finally makes his way out of the cabin. It’d be real inconvenient, now that everyone got a big part of their shit together.
Fuck it. He has to waddle, and he’s not proud about it, but he goes to his drawer and pulls out the vibrator. He doesn’t use it a ton, because he doesn’t want to get used to it God forbid, but that is
“Last time I was in the hospital was maybe fifteen years ago,” Anna interrupts, thankfully changing the topic. “Tried to go flying with Pidgeot, I think. Not sure how sober I was that time.”
is a good word, honey.” The second Kelly speaks, she knows it’s almost unbearably awkward. She tries not to cringe when the three members of the extended Winchester family turn toward her with baffled stares. At least the moment passes quickly.
“Jo!” Ellen hollers, as the vans circle their way around a group of undulating Scolipede, rolling along their Whirlipede offspring as they move. Most of the Scolipede, too, have a couple of Venipede clinging to them, except for the biggest one. Dean does a double-take when he sees him, because there’s a girl riding on his back. She dismounts as they grow closer, and waves wildly. “That’s my daughter.”
“Quality time with me?” Dean smirks. He’s all bravado and big genuine smiles now. The only thing more worrying than Dean’s moods these days is how quickly they shift. “Woulda thought you wanted some with –”
He used to be able to look out at a highway and see inside every car driving on it. In that trip to Waterville with Dean, he’d spent much time amusing him by telling him the life story of every other driver on the roads. He wandered through fields of wheat and long, abandoned beaches searching for his Father, and could count every grain of vegetation and sand alike. And this, humanity, this was too much for Castiel.
Sam and Dean exchange a glance that goes on a second too long. “Well.” Dean speaks up, eventually. “Guess what. I killed Hitler.”
Thing is, and every time Dean thinks of it his gut churns unpleasantly, Cas clearly doesn’t want to talk about that night outside Shopping Mall Nine. He’d rather pretend it never happened. Dean gets it. He’s perfectly willing to play the avoidance game, too. God knows he’s tried to keep people away from him, because all he does is leave a wreck in his wake. He can deal with his own shit, but no one else should have to.
There’s one thing Cas wants to make very clear before they return to sleep. Something he should have said already, the first thing he should have said once he received Castiel’s memories. He strokes his fingers through Dean’s hair; the contact settles him and puts jumpy anticipation in his stomach alike. “Before I died. You were the last thing I thought of –”
Mary tries to keep her laugh low enough that the other people can’t hear it. “You bet. Does she come here, too?”
All the while, Cas stays attached to Castiel. His touch is entirely clinical but God, their mouths won’t stop touching, moving around each other. It’s definitely the weirdest thing that’s ever given Dean half a boner, that’s for sure.
Cas’ eyes keep flickering toward Dean; he can’t help but thrill at every glance. With one last hard blink, though, Cas turns to Kelly and Jack, still in their strange tableau by the entrance to the kitchen. “I’m sorry. This must be awkward.” God, he’s the same.
He takes Cas’ hand after a while, and drops it immediately. It’s cold to the touch. It falls too easily, no tension behind the movement. Seems impossible that it ever belonged to someone who lived.
There’s another few beats of silence, until Dean throws out a question like an anchor, meant to keep Cas tied to him somehow. “Did you catch her?”
, and not really after a run. Pushing himself like that is pretty awesome — when it’s like, once a month. Plus he had swamp ass the whole time and
Delta’s eyes are enormous. “I helped bring Lucas back, with Abaddon.” Dean blinks at how upfront the admission is, before fury sweeps through his body. “We had the powers. It was me. I never thought it would turn out this way –”
“Wouldn’t worry about it, Castiel,” Chuck responds, with a big benevolent smile. “Raphael was watching over me for years and never saw it, either.”
lecture, but never understood it until now. Everything was so cramped on Earth, and Castiel had previously not seen the difference between standing a foot away from Dean, and standing a few meters away.
In the cool silence of the warehouse, the door looks like something from another planet. It’s worn and shiny wood with four Pokemon carved on it, three of them stretched out mid-leap and forming a circle. They’ve all got the same basic four-legged ungulate build, but other than that their features are way different. One’s all graceful swooping lines, another jagged spikes, another squat rock. The fourth one, in the middle of the ring that the other three make, almost looks like a kid’s toy with its diminutive size, big googly eyes, and fluffy tail, except for the enormous tiered horn that erupts from its forehead and sticks up like an arrow pointing to the keyhole.
Dean’s impressed at how he’s still in shape. He goes running almost every morning with Kevin or Sarah or Tamara. There was a point in his life — like, all of it before he got to Camp Chitaqua — where he would’ve laughed at the idea of
Dean doesn’t make much progress through the woods. Everything looks the same, dead leaves and sticks he keeps tripping over like a moron. That’s the only time he’s glad Cas isn’t around, because, Jesus, how embarrassing. Not that Cas would judge him, but it’s the principle of the thing.
They head off together, and Charlie cheerily hands him something that smells almost violently like green apples. A few years – or hell, even months – ago, Dean would’ve refused to drink this and demanded whiskey. Now, though, what the hell. Dean’s drank worse, and only one long pull from the bottle makes the world settle down a bit.
Dean turns around. If Dean didn’t know Cas so well, he’d say his expression was entirely blank. But there’s a desperation turning his eyes the shade of a choppy, stormy sea, widening his pupils by a fraction.
“Oh, I know what you’re thinking,” Gabriel says, once she’s torn into another big piece of the red, drippy bread. A big blob of whipped cream falls on her plate, and she cleans it up with her finger and licks that finger off. Charming. “It’s true, though. Poor sad orphans, spurned by our shitty adoptive father, found the only authority figure we thought we
Still. Purgatory is dark and shifting below and behind, and it’s just the two of them, hanging out on some rocky outcropping. They’re standing closer to each other than even usual, and Dean wasn’t expecting Cas’ palm against his to feel like what happens when you get too close to a light bulb that’s just been switched on, but it’s sort of comforting in the constant misty chill of Purgatory. Not that he’s saying that out loud, thank you.
there enough times, and he knows he will go there a hundred more times, and his dad will never find what he’s looking for, and his mom will never come back.
He’s still got that same creepy-ass smile. “I’m not any more interested in that slime that thinks it rules every Petri dish it can get to poisoning my food than you are. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, for now.”
As Cas just nods, Dean realizes that the angry chatter in the underbrush, if it ever really existed, is gone. The muscles in his arms aren’t twitching any more, and restlessness doesn’t churn in his head. He breathes out, and lets Cas lead him on deeper into the endless forest.
“I couldn’t just leave them behind,” she offers up, almost sheepish. “Sam got Alakazam and he’s battling up ahead.” She tied her hair back, but long wisps of it are sneaking out and drifting into her face. If Dean didn’t already like this chick, he’d outright love her now. Definitely way out of Sam’s league.
“The crossroads demons were eliminated before I came into creation,” Castiel says. “We wanted to remove all temptation. And they’re not very predictable or manageable.”
“Your Castiel,” Castiel says one day. Just two words make sweat bead on Dean’s hairline and threaten to trail down the back of his neck. He tells himself it’s the shitty air circulation down here. “How did you know him? You were obviously quite – close. That can’t be usual for a human and an angel, even if you aren’t in an apocalyptic war.”
The bus chugs along, until a couple of stops down the line, a familiar figure gets on. Dean ducks his head down to hide his smile when Cas steps on the bus, but Vaporeon catches that smile and starts poking Dean’s arm. He remembers to play it cool, and doesn’t brighten up until Cas offers a small wave at
my family,” she says, looking down at Whimsicott and mussing his fuzzy cotton mane. “But then there was all the shit we went through. The shit they put me through. The shit
“And we didn’t even have to shovel any poop,” Charlie declares triumphantly. Dean grins back at her. He thought maybe she’d be a slacker, the type that slides by on her charisma and easy charm, but she worked her ass off too. This chick is
“She had a blast,” Dean says, pointing out Vaporeon to Cas. He’s smiling at her, too. “So did I.” He winds his fingers through Cas, and they wait there until the sun’s dipped low under the horizon and even Vaporeon’s nudging at them to leave.
It shatters Dean. A typhoon rages up inside him, all sound and fury, but all he can do is settle down at the table. He poured it all out there, for nothing. Gabriel was wrong.
(Of course, Dean remembers that night. He remembers the two of them cramped inside the Impala while Dean went over attack plans, and Cas snapped back and forth between discussing them with him, and cheerily babbling about the biology of bees.
“As much as I love my work husband, no hetero,” she continues, to an exceedingly well-timed fistbump from Dean, “It just means I’ve been slacking on the hacking, pardon the rhyme.”
“Alright,” he says at last, after a few long swigs of the plain OJ. “I’m game. Take me to meet Olivia Dunham down there already.”
They pull up in front of a 24-hour convenience store. “Just, uh, sit tight, okay?” Dean tells him, and Emmanuel means to. He’s bizarrely good at following orders; people have told him
“I mean, probably, but I never told him,” Dean admits. “I’ve known it about myself for – years, I guess, it’s not just about – you know. But you’re, uh. The first person I’ve told. Ever.” He can’t help but let out a careful laugh. “Guess I always wanted the first person I told to be my mom. I knew she wouldn’t judge me.”
Cas sits back a few inches. Dean’s front feels like the inside of a freezer at the loss of contact, however temporary. “I’ve, um. I’ve long wanted to bring you to orgasm in a certain way. It may seem odd to you at first. Is that alright?”
,” the voice says, and it’s not the panic in his voice that convinces Dean that this guy is for real. It’s the
Uriel and Hannah, on the other hand, are immaculately dressed. Uriel shows up in a goddamn business suit, while Hannah’s stiff jacket barely shifts as they move. Anna moves to hug Hannah, and though her embrace is warm, Hannah only responds to wind their own arms around Anna’s back after a minute or two.
“Cas,” Dean asks, when they’re out of earshot of the kitchen, “Are you – how are you? Are you okay?” He barely manages to suppress his own cringe. Hitting his head against the wall would probably be smoother than that question.
Dean’s able to catch hold of his thoughts again. “Water’s for Vaporeon. I got nothin’ at all against people with Fire Pokemon, you’ve seen me with Charlie and her Vulpix, I just – I couldn’t get the symbol on me.” Dean says it all in one exhale, and tries awfully fucking hard to ignore just how heated his face gets.
Dean gets his ass up off the floor. Cas is intimidating enough when they’re both standing up, even if his vessel’s shorter. Dean grunts, “So let me get back to it,” as he brushes by him on the way out.
He just wishes he had some lube to slick his fingers up with and introduce Castiel to the many wonders of the prostate while he sucked him off, make it even better, but there’s always next time. God, there’s gonna be a
That’s why Dean didn’t start this years ago, didn’t give in to what he felt in the barn when Cas looked right at him, or in Bobby’s kitchen when Dean could feel his breath against his lips. (Though it’s nice to know there was
“Seriously,” Gabriel continues, “I owe you one fucking hell of an apology. And you’ll get it. But I ran away for
Dean knows it could have been worse, too. When he saw Sam’s Eevee start to glow with the energy that meant evolution, Dean flicked his eyes up to look at the sun overhead and gulped in relief. Even before Eevee’s glow took on Espeon’s distinct wisteria hue, Dean knew it was daytime, and no nighttime Eevee evolution meant no Umbreon.
For a long time, Cas and Anna don’t say anything. This talk with Naomi, for those two, has been more silence than conversation, and Dean doesn’t blame them. “Do you know where in Sinnoh,” Anna says, at last.
“Thank you, Abaddon,” Lucas says, too calm. The redheaded woman from before smirks wickedly down at Dean; her lips and nails are as scarlet as her hair. A Tentacruel moves by her side, and even though Dean knows the name is a misnomer and most Tentacruel are perfectly docile to anything that’s not their prey, it’s really not making him feel too good right now. “That won’t be needed now.”
“I thought they would.” Cas buries his face in Dean’s neck, kisses a delicate column right where it makes Dean shiver. Part of Dean really, really wishes Cas wouldn’t do that while they’re chatting about his mom and brother, but that part’s drowned out by the much much larger part of his mind screaming at Cas to keep going. “They’re the best people I know, present company excluded. And I believe the two of them may have thought we were already together anyway.”
Mary hardly recognizes her own voice. Her heart may be racing, but her fists are steady. Those fists are currently adorned with knuckles that were once bronze, but are now stained with rust. The Enochian wards on them still glow a radiant neon, though, and that’s enough to make anyone on this side of the world listen to her.
“Fuck, please,” Dean begs. He lets his legs fall all the way open, and shivers hard when Cas nudges deeper in, stubble scratching at his cleft.
“Okay,” Dean breathes, uncapping the marker. The smell of it makes Castiel recoil. “Yeah, not ideal, but it’ll stick around through a couple of showers.”
The light flares up and out, and when it ebbs away, Dean’s looking at a very different form. The thing’s as big as a small plane, with stubby arms that look like they shouldn’t be able to hold his weight while perched on the ground. But there are enormous jagged and majestic wings, and even though the face is one Dean’s never seen before, he’d know the eyes anywhere.
“Fine. Angels? This sounds like their MO, weren’t they trying to take Kevin off somewhere to learn the Word of God all those years ago?”
Speaking of exhilarating, it’s some combination of everything — not just Cas’ plush mouth and the way it goes tight and seals around his cock, but the closeness of him and the heat off his body — that makes Dean come, at last, tossing his head back and twisting his fingers in the sheets tightly. The orgasm’s a tidal rip over his body, so fast it leaves his vision blurred, and ebbs out slow. It feels like he’s been fundamentally restructured, and maybe he has. Weird shit happens when angels and humans have sex, he’d guess.
Cas gets weird allergies from the clothes. For a while, it totally freaks Dean out — not that he’s admitting it — that Cas starts sneezing. Turns out, of course, all that shit had been on the shelf for God knows how long, and had gone all dusty. They’re just lucky it wasn’t Leviathan goop.
, Dean could say about Sam, even if no one but him could understand the heft of those words. Cas was — Cas, and he was even harder to define. Jody knew more than most, but it was still only a fraction.
“You wanna come?” Of course, that had been the real issue. And Sam looks almost wounded, like he’s prodding skin that’ll break open and reveal the ugly, bloody redness inside, but he’s gotta do it.
Azazel taps Hypno on the head. It’s not an affectionate gesture; it’s a jab like there’s a particularly sticky button there. Sickness rolls right through Dean’s stomach. This is all so fucked up.
“That movie came out after Metatron downloaded all known popular culture into my mind,” Cas says truthfully, “so I’m not sure what I’m
It’s not exactly comfortable. His jaw goes achy too easily, always has. But it’s totally fucking worth it for the
?” Cas asks, and Dean winces at the sharpness. It’s a dart, and Dean’s had one of those accidentally hit him and they hurt like a son of a bitch.
of ridiculous staged photos to make the kids running around happy. They’re both way more game for it than Dean would have ever expected, and he finds himself whooping in laughter with Cas at his side. The kids keep hugging Tessa in her Cresselia outfit, and most of them ask to pet Absol’s silky fur too. That’s gotta mean the world to her.
Dean’s seen some strange shit. His dad talked to Ghost-type trainers most people stayed far, far away from, and then after he’d sprinkle herbs in a wide circle and murmur something in a language Dean didn’t know, Dean didn’t
Sure enough, after Dean fixes his stare on him, Granbull’s pink fur evaporates to black, and he shrinks. He transforms back into what he really is, a much smaller Pokemon that still bares its teeth and guards its owner ferociously. Delta looks up at Dean, an unreadable expression on her face.
Castiel notices the sky first. Only a few wispy clouds hover among the sweet cornflower blue, drifting slowly. The air is clean. There is no smog to obscure anything, and so when he looks out over the sparkling bay, he can see how mountain peaks lift gently up from the earth on the opposite side of the beach.
Dean has to blink hard at that. “Cas,” he says, even as he shoves himself back on the three fingers inside him, skidding over his prostate. “You gotta – I wanna get you inside me now.”
And then he looks forward at the angel with Lucifer maybe still clattering around in his skull somewhere, walking on because there is nothing else they can do, and Dean breathes because he’s gotta keep it together for more than just himself.
“At least now you know you have ‘em,” Dean chimes in. “Maybe now we can think about getting some answers. Can’t get anything done without a start.”
Cas is not sure if Castiel’s time in this dimension was at all enjoyable. He spent most of his time here in one of the basement’s tiny rooms, in chains. Castiel understood why he was there, but it would have made it no better. So many sights to see, here on this earth, and Castiel saw only four gray brick walls. Then again, Cas thinks of how Dean dominates Castiel’s memories, and he hopes that in the end, Castiel did find some value in this world.
“I wish you’d stop asking questions,” Castiel grumbles, and Dean smiles. It looks only a bit broken. He undoes the belt, then, grunting because it’s stiff with disuse. His hands make quick work of the button and fly, and it’s all Castiel can do but lift his hips and watch his dress pants and underwear slide down his legs.
part of town. The lit-up streets of the technology sector weave easily with charming cobblestone streets, and the lights gleam off the polished stones. This section of the ride’s hell on the wheels of the bus, but at least they’re goin’ slow through the scenic part of town. “Where’s yours?”
“I mean it,” she continues. Dean has never gotten a straight answer on whether angels can openly read minds, or whether his thoughts are just particularly loud, but shit like that always freaks him out. “Why do you think he keeps coming back? It’s his connection to you. Soul to grace. God’s still MIA, he’s not doing it. What do you think a
The thing is, Dean gets it. Charlie changing the records in one database – hell, even Charlie gleefully siphoning money out of a bunch of their bank accounts – isn’t going to make anyone able to get in touch with any other regions. It’s not going to make the protests on campus stop. It’s not going to get them the nursery back.
Dean remembers the first time Cas went into heat, when he actually did try his fingers. “You got yourself ready for me?” he asked, and if his voice was more high-pitched than normal who could blame him, because the mental image of Cas fumbling with lube and fucking himself on his fingers was – yeah. But Cas had fucking
A familiar electric blue flashes behind his eyelids, insistent. But it must be the last thought of a desperate man, because everything after that falls dark and silent.
“Yeah, Dean,” Sam responds, and if they’re practically rocking together in the doorway and it’s awkward as hell, Dean’s sure they can be forgiven in this moment. “It’s me.”
Still, Dean gropes back and finds the dildo. There’s no need to do it, Cas is slick and ready, but he pushes it up against Cas’ belly to get his come all over it. It’s good, now, the dumb little hearts on the thing all messy with white. He readies it at his entrance and grins, because Cas has taken bigger and thicker – thank you very much – but he’s still inching forward, trying to fuck into it.
Of course, Dean doesn’t get a chance to shower because Cas is playing checkers with Jody Mills on one of the rickety tables by his cabin. He’s pretty sure she’s getting her ass kicked, but she’s still grinning about it, about getting her ass kicked by an angel who’s still prone to droning on about bees and butterflies every now and then, and hasn’t changed out of his hospital scrubs and that damn trenchcoat. Dean always liked Jody, but she’s kind of a saint, to be honest.
Dean feels a hard grip on his shoulder. It ain’t Cas. Instead, it’s a college girl who whirls him the fuck around. If Dean had only seen her and not had her practically whip him around, he probably would’ve vastly underestimated her strength. A Rampardos, taller than any human in this group, glowers over her shoulder with his blue bone dome head glinting in the sun. Underestimating her would’ve been a goddamn awful idea.
And now he’s back in one. Most of his body feels nothing at all, which he suspects is due to the drip stuck into his arm, but when he does move his body reverberates with ache like a struck church bell. At least in those small moments he can feel something, anything at all. There’s nobody else in his room. No Vaporeon, no Cas – fuck.
Dean has little hope or faith. Life taught him that those things, they never work out. But Mick – Dean kinda misses that douchebag too, because they’ve lost too much, and he’d really come through in the end – had called Claire a walking miracle.
Out of nowhere as usual, Cas settles into the seat next to Dean, and balances the small glass tube in his palm. “This is astounding,” he murmurs, holding it up.
Vaporeon’s currently staring up at him, head quirked while she tries to figure out what the book Dean’s reading means. He smiles at her and asks, “What do you think about working at a nursery, with other Pokemon?” He knows Vaporeon came from the best breeder in Village Bridge, because John had an in with them through Mary. As an Eevee, she grew up with twelve brothers and sisters, including the Eevee that became Sam’s Espeon too.
“Cas,” Dean breathes. His voice is a tight knot he barely recognizes as he slides his hand back to tangle with Cas’ over Lillipup’s fur. In between them, Vaporeon practically buzzes. “What are we doing here?”
“Dick Roman. You probably know me. Unlike your boyfriend, I don’t care much for anonymity.” Shit, this is a big fucking deal. Roman’s not just some conservative commentator gushing over a flat tax, he’s a major businessman. Dean’s worked with Bobby when he was helping design buildings for Roman’s company, and he always demanded that they be bigger, bigger, bigger.
Dean shrugs, even as he’s still blushing a bit. His love for Cas fills him to the brim, but it’s still weird when anyone else can see it. “He ain’t so bad, you know. Just give him some coffee and let ‘im take care of the plants in his apartment for a while.”
Sinnoh legends say Darkrai and Cresselia are in a constant battle with each other, Darkrai bringing nightmares while Cresselia relieves them with good dreams, so Delta and Tessa end up posing for a
“I can try and fix it for you, Cas,” Sam chimes in, as the angel rather mournfully slips the coat off his shoulders. Everyone gathered knows it’s useless, though.
Mary likely could have dumped out the heads of Azazel and the imposter Lucifer, murdered Hannah, and claimed victory over all of Heaven. It’s blasphemy to think it, but Castiel is never returning home. He finds himself unfazed by the thought of punishment there.
The Jirachi figurines are the closest sign of Mary. Even though they’re closely connected to Hoenn’s myths, not Unova’s, Jirachi is the most common figurine in the storage locker. Most of the little papers attached to their tiny hats are torn off, and they’ve probably been gone a long time. Dean gets it. Jirachi, the legends say, woke up every thousand years for a week and granted you any wish you wanted. All Dean would have asked for was his mom alive and his family together, and he knows Dad couldn’t even get angry at him for that either.
,” a serious-looking little girl with heavy bangs and comically huge glasses declares. “When I’m old enough,
When Dean catches Cas stooping over to pluck the feathers off the floor later, which is a pretty useless enterprise considering they’re mostly just fuzz, the only reaction Cas gives him is a shrug. “I’m proud too,” is all he offers up, but he’s smiling.
Just because nothing here wants to attack them doesn’t mean it’s not awful and creepy. It doesn’t make the whole situation not really, really suck the high hard one.  Dean never stops looking over his shoulder, awaiting the moment he’ll get ripped to shreds, dragged down to dissolve into Purgatory’s dirt before he turned into one of the undying monsters here.
At least until an enormous Dragonite, scales shimmering with opalescence and perspiration alike, swoops in to face her.
“Yeah.” That’s all Dean allows himself to say for now. Anything else would dredge up the entire goddamn world.
The look on Cas’ face is too soft, too sentimental, and Dean finds himself taking initiative in response. It’s been too long, but it’d be hard to forget how to do this, or how it felt. Carefully, Dean lowers himself onto Cas’ lap, inching himself backwards until Cas is fully seated inside him.
. Dean arches his eyebrows and nods, still willing to take the win on this point even if he suspects there’s more coming from Benny. He’s right. “But man, there’s somethin’ about you two…”
Dean isn’t surprised that Vaporeon all but jumps in front of him, but he gestures to her to get the hell back
True to Vaporeon’s sorta-word, Charlie’s sitting on one of the costume warehouse’s big plush chairs, one foot in what looks like the costume foot of a Charizard. Dean’s gotta give the girl credit for going all-out with this.
Dean just folds his arms. “He cares because he’s the one who brought the Leviathan to Earth. So what, he doesn’t wanna fight, he’s helping out how he can —”
So that’s what she’s been looking for ever since, in a way. It’s only been two and a half months with Abigail. And she can’t understand the way Cas loved, like the way the tide comes in and out, over and over, eternally. But she thinks she could get close.
He really wishes he could bail them all out, no matter how happy and oblivious too many of the students here are. Maybe especially because of that. His annoyance at the students of Carver has faded away, and Dean feels frankly embarrassed that he’d been that mad in the first place. But a large-scale rescue mission is way too conspicuous.
Thing is, Cas had said that to Dean too, that he knew what Dean had done. He’d said it more than once. When they were together on the road during the apocalypse, and Dean was barely holding it together. After the Gadreel thing had blown up spectacularly in everyone’s faces. Once the Mark of Cain stopped crawling through his veins at last. Cas still had nothing but sympathy for Dean. Dean never deserved shit, but he reached for Cas anyway; he didn’t have the courage to turn away from his warmth.
He can also somehow see it from Cas’ point of view; to Cas, the garden’s a modest vegetable patch, apple trees lining its side.
Dean goes back to work. Cas loves sensations, he’s learning, so that’s what he chases. Warm mouth, cool breath, fingers skimming and pressing everywhere. Eventually, though, he’s back to bobbing up and down on Cas’ cock, the rhythm of his movements and the heaviness of Cas on his tongue almost getting him hard again.
“I’d enjoy that. Any time spent with you is good.” Like many other times, Cas is just saying how he feels, but Dean still beautifully flushes and ducks his head. Cas relishes the opportunity to pull Dean against him, until their heartbeats thump together. His own heartbeat is entirely unnecessary, Cas knows, but in moments like this, it seems essential. “We should rest while we have the opportunity.”
“Why in the world would we do that?” Anna asks in a shriek. She’s all fury and Lucas is steely, creepy calm. Cas is caught in a mix between the two of them, face placid but a snarl starting to twist his mouth. Dean’s still way too woozy to respond to any of this properly.
When the day starts to fade, Dean finds himself exhaling “What a day,” and falling back against the sand so he can watch the sky streak fiery orange and soft pink until all the color fades away to nothing but navy. In this position, the sand’ll stick to his back and get in his hair now, but fuck it, it’s everywhere else at this point.
all the time (which Dean never said shit in return to, because he knew Rufus was only humoring him) and Bobby gave him several approving grunts.
With one last long nuzzle, she reluctantly jumps down from his chest and starts skittering through the alleyways. Dean forgot all about her haphazard pace, the way she zig-zags from one side of the street to the other. It was annoying when he was a kid. His heart feels big in his chest for it now.
with a somewhat worrying gleam in their eyes, Ennis nods stoically, and Andy still looks like he’s mostly asleep – but they’re all going back to Unova with Dean and Cas.
“Meg and I have an understanding.” Dean totally doesn’t bristle at that. “But Dean, I do — worry how helpful I can be.”
Cas doesn’t say anything for a while; he just lets his thumb trace over Dean’s face again. Usually Dean goes all Octillery on the person he’s with post-orgasm and passes out, but Cas keeps him buzzing. Dean doesn’t dare doze off, because he doesn’t want to miss any of these touches, tiny and precious, jewels studded across Dean’s skin.
, the one thing left of Cas – had disappeared before the first droplets hit the ground. Once Dean got inside the house, he hadn’t even bothered to dry off before he started slurping down rotgut from who knows where.
Dean howls as he comes. His fingers scrabble against the door and grab Cas’ skin hard enough to hurt. It feels like his brain is in bloom, the orgasm Cas gave him opening up his entire mind, his whole body, to wild unknown sensations.
Most of the Woobat aren’t good flyers, because even as adults they’re not remotely aerodynamic, but this little girl apparently is. Fast, too. Before Dean can react, she’s made a beeline right for the nook between Dean’s shoulder and neck, and latching right onto his cheek with her big heart-shaped stamp of a nose.
They stashed Castiel in a basement dungeon. Not the same one where they’d kept Crowley, Dean had insisted, before turning and walking right out. Mary stared at the open door for a long time, like if she looked out at the hallway long enough, it’d give her the magic words to peel the sadness away from Dean – but in the end, she turned away from the doorway to draw a complex sigil on the wall. Something even Sam had never seen before.
Dean could keep walking. There’s probably a while before he’s going to have to talk about this to Sam. But instead, he plants his feet, and as nonchalantly as possible, tosses out, “So I think me and Cas are a thing.”
,” Dean retorts. “And the same damn thing happened to me. You were at dad’s funeral, then nothing. Did you even know I’m living in Opelucid?”
Dean still can’t move well, but he suspects even if he could he’d be stuck staring anyway. The guy looks like Dean’s goddamn superhero, cape and awesome Pokemon and all.
Neither Sam or Dean knows how to react to that one; it’s probably still a thorny issue. When they’re heading away from Michael, though, they both end up nodding at each other in some sort of acknowledgement.
The Pokemon only added to the chaos. It was impossible to tell which ones were runaway or wild and which ones actually had owners, because they darted across streets with seemingly little regard for their own safety. Dean, Sam, and John, not used to Castelia’s pace, almost tripped over the rushing Pokemon way too many times.
Dean doesn’t say anything in return, just doesn’t move his gaze from Sammy’s for a couple of beats before he slumps back against the seat, closes his eyes again, and swallows hard. Ben would’ve — it’s very likely the shit the Leviathan pumped into all that food would’ve gotten him anyway, sure. It doesn’t have anything to do with him.
One of the old Brycen-Man PokeStar Studio movies is on. Dean’s seen it a million times, enough that he can practically recite the dialogue. Cas, though, only seems vaguely aware of who Brycen-Man even
he was bad, and Dean’d be lying if he said he ever liked talking to the guy. Still, he’s a tendril connecting them back to Bobby, and it got snapped now. Severed, easy and messy, like the blood splatter all over his trailer.
Dean takes one look out over the crowd. There aren’t a lot of women in this dubious group, but he suddenly realizes there
warmth, his body giving off the heated satisfaction he must feel in his sleep, and Cas is happy to roll along with it.
“Good to know,” Dean manages to get out. “Good talk. See you – when I see you, if you feel like talking.” He can practically hear the acid in his voice, but it’s nothing but a half-assed attempt at building a wall he knows he can never fully put up. Cas – not even Cas, now, but whatever Castiel is – was too good at dismantling him, brick by brick.
Dean rolls his eyes enormously. Naomi would probably be well within her rights to leave this conversation because of that, but he doesn’t particularly care. “Let me guess. Am I Shaymin? I hope so. I look pretty damn good in green and hey, don’t tell anyone I said this, but that flower’s adorable.” Flagstaff’s moved one of her crossed arms to stifle a laugh in the background. Probably not the worst sign.
“It’s not, okay?” Dean just — he knows he’d be able to sense it if the Earth was gone, if Sam was gone. Surely he would have just fallen forward into the dirt and no amount of prodding or angel mojo from Cas would get him to move, ever again. “You know that. You do.” He slides his fingers over Cas’ wrist, not grabbing, just there to serve as a reassurance. He’s here, too, and he continues even with the look of surprise in Cas’ eyes.
. The guy practically gave Dean a hernia when he dragged out a three-piece suit, in the perfect shade of charcoal gray to make his eyes pop. Dean keeps having to fix his blue tie, at least, because the guy just can’t help the fact that he’s perpetually disheveled.
That’s the only words for it, because he moves so quickly, and so on instinct, that he’s got no idea what the hell he’s doing He knows he’s punching a wall until it splinters and fucks up his hand, until the wall’s blurring red, and he knows there are tears all over his face, but he seems so entirely distant from it all. He can’t be in this little shack, no more than a crappy
“It’s appreciated,” Cas chimes in, all calm like Sam told them he’d be running down to the grocery store for milk. Dean hasn’t smiled this wide in — ever, he can feel it tugging down his ears and pulling his forehead taut, it
Michael bristles at Dean’s question. “My name is Michael Adler.” Zachariah’s last name, not Naomi’s. “City senator. You must not care about politics, if you don’t recognize me. What a shame.”
there, flanked by Hydreigon, but now he crosses his arms and smiles triumphantly. That can’t be good. “I knew this was the way to get you down here in the muck with the other sad mortals,” he says, right to Cas. Dean wants to kick
and look for an exit every now and then, and Dean ignores the jackrabbit thump of his heart every time to only nod.
She smiles a kind of smile where Dean’s not sure she’s aware he’s looking at her at all. It’s a smile meant only for Sam. He’s seen the equivalent on Cas’ face plenty of times, and every time, it gets him. He likes this chick. Way out of Sam’s league, but she’s great.
ways to fuss over him. Dean and Cas will probably have ten different tiny grumbly arguments while they put away all their crap in the new house, and they’ll go to bed way too late with the Kricketune practically screaming in the woods and keeping them awake anyway.
“What Max said,” Alicia chimes in. “Standing invite to you. Heard it through the grapevine that you’re not too bad at the spells yourself. Dean and your mom – they’re welcome too. We can be the world’s coolest zombie witches.”
run rampant? Opelucid is full of kids who lost their parents just looking for Dragon-types. Your brain would scramble just from standing next to an Alakazam –”
It’s a cold day, the sky a heavy gray sheet above their heads as Dean helps everyone else to haphazardly stuff luggage into the vans. “Too bad angel airlines doesn’t have baggage check, huh,” he asks Cas with a grin.
She balls her fist up and punches Cobalion, right in the neck, right between where the tuft of hair on her chest ends and her jaw begins. Lilith might be skinny, but there’s clearly strength in her arms and legs.
Cas’ fingers stroke his cheek, once, then drop. “It’s a part of life, Dean. I’m living now. It’s freedom. It’s wonderful.” His legs shift. “I will admit I hope nothing apocalyptic happens any time soon, though. I think we’ve had enough of that for several lifetimes. Crowley sealed Hell before his death.”
Dean looks up to see Cas smiling at the two of them. “The truth is,” Cas says, “I don’t even have eggs. Are you disappointed?” He’s leaning against one of the walls, arms at his sides, and Dean takes a moment to appreciate the lines of his body exhibited so starkly.
. Even at that age, Dean remembers thinking that apparently giving your kid a Pokemon when he was way underage was fine, but giving him any choice in the matter was
, and it’s a whole ‘nother ballgame. It isn’t about possessiveness, but settling into someone. His hands settle at Cas’ hips, like a reminder. His fingertips brush the lines of bone that stick out there, and he feels the goosebumps pimple up in response. He wishes they could sink in entirely.
“She’s fine here. Thank you,” Cas says. His voice is the same strangely clipped tone as ever, but there’s a relief in it. An unburdening, almost. Dean’s heart feels like it’s getting squeezed at that, and up against Cas like he is, he’s sure Cas can feel that funny tick of it too.
Cas’ lips touch his. He hadn’t really kissed back last time. They’re dry, but soft, not too chapped or rough like Dean thought they might be — and yeah, he thought about it, shut up, you can’t spend the better part of like six years staring at someone without thinking about that a little bit. It’s all soft and chaste, but Dean still hears someone, like, actually gasping behind him.
The storage room is full of bookshelves and storage cabinets with their drawers jammed open and at least one portable closet. Everywhere Dean looks, there’s
Dean, on the other hand, just grins. Things are still way off-kilter between him and Sam, but he can pretend they’re normal for at least a little while longer. “No shit,” he says. “You guys met at school?”
At some point, Castiel thinks, you are supposed to get away from people like Dean, because they only end up hurting you. Even he can understand that. Dean literally introduced him to the concept of
“You got a weird life, man,” Dean says, eventually, but the levity in the words doesn’t reach his voice. He taps an unknown beat out against the steering wheel. Dean is a smooth driver, and it relaxes Emmanuel.
Dean hated Crowley from the get-go, that slimy little beetle, but right now he almost pities him. No matter what he goes through, he’s obviously never going to understand Pokemon. What makes them tick, what makes them
For as much as Dean’s thought of Vaporeon, Charlie, and Benny as total traitors at various points, Dean’s mind is in fact the worst traitor of all, because he thinks Cas looks good in anything.
“Here,” Tamara tells Sam, after a while, and they stop the car. The two of them move to the back and pull out thigh harnesses equipped with guns, and water guns too, dark with the laundry detergent inside them. (It’s a weird world, man.)
being the way he worked out, or whatever. Heck, tell him this would be his life the day before he got thrown into Purgatory, and he wouldn’t have even bothered to laugh, just stared at you in disbelief.
Still, Dean had a friggin’ blast. Yeah, there was that weird moment with the kids dressed as Cubone and Squirtle, but that was just Dean’s own thoughts trying to sabotage him. He’s trying to say
“World of baddies and brutality and blood,” Dean manages to say. “You woulda loved it. That kind of place, it’s – in a way, it’s simpler.”
Maybe he should ask. Dean should be freaked out by this, by the reminder that the man-shaped thing under him isn’t a man at all and that he’s getting Dean’s nose and forehead shiny with his own slick, but he doesn’t care. Hell, he’s putting it right into his mental spank bank, because Cas trembling with his shoulders dug deep into the backseat of the Impala and his hole completely soaked, Dean’s fingers slipping over his skin and his brain overwhelmed with Cas’ scent and wetness, is so much better than just
Castiel shoots Cas a harsh glance, and look, Dean’s had some – illuminating conversations with the guy. No argument about that. But he can’t help the hackles that rise up in him the second Castiel looks at Cas like that. Castiel isn’t hostile, though, when he says, “I’m not sure I’ll ever understand, though the argument’s gotten more tempting lately.”
“Let’s go,” is all he grunts out. As he turns around, Cas is right there, space between his eyebrows furrowed. Dude probably heard the whole thing. Great.
cosplay, because with the butter-colored silk jumper and the distinct number of tails trailing behind her, she clearly dressed up as Ninetales to go along with her Vulpix.
Cas’ brow furrows. God, Dean is gonna feel like a moron with the all-knowing angel as his traveling buddy, but he figures he can deal. “To find a way out,” Cas says, as if he already found a map with an easily marked path.
Unlike Alastair, the people Azazel and Lilith captured weren’t rattling the bars of the Pokemon cages, desperate to get their punches in against a Kangaskhan one of them had stolen. They looped a video of that on the news, the eyes of the people ravenous and practically aflame, the Kangakshan just looking defeated and trying to find somewhere in its cage where she could hide herself from the hands reaching toward her.
done it in the past. That year after Lisa’s — and he forces that name out of his mind — but before Cas went Crazy Old Testament God, they didn’t so much talk as have a never-ending string of arguments. He’s seen Cas gone crazy and done nothing but snarl to his face in return. But this isn’t that, they’re past that. It’s a real question.
Dean looks down at the floor, briefly. It doesn’t have any answers for him. Only the truth does. “Yeah,” he says, looking up again. His voice doesn’t even waver. “He was family, I loved him like a brother, I meant that when I told him. I think he knew how important that was. But there’d been something more there as long as I can remember. And he knew that too. Both of us knew it. And now he’s –”
Dean’s probably said the wrong thing; there’s a pretty significant upper class section of the city, one that would probably take offense to the very idea of their Pokemon being
“I’m flattered, but don’t give me so much credit. You feel more than anyone else I’ve ever known, Dean. Possibly more than anyone else on the planet.”
Cas is a hard-ass, Cas is reckless and blunt, Cas has a weird sense of humor and weirder dress skills, and Cas rarely bothers with social niceties. But in the end, he’s
Dean works like Sam’s rarely seen him. One ghoul grabs Dean from behind, but Dean slams his head back; the ghoul releases its grip and goes staggering. Dean grabs it by the shoulder in return, and cleaves its fucking head in half. He chops at it again for good measure. Sam shoves his arm against his nose to cover the stench.
“Got into engineering at first, trying to – it was like I could find some way to make up for them. But computers were more my style, you know? And Vulpix, my mom used to tell me bedtime stories about them and Ninetales. Think pretty much everyone was
Dean smiles at him, and props himself up on one elbow. “So we got plenty of time, is what you’re saying.”
Dean rolls his eyes, though he tries to hide it best he can. This has gotta go better than playing Apples to Apples with the guy, at least. Probably wouldn’t even know Helen Keller always wins.
“You’re tellin’ me a Pidgey stole a whole cake?” Dean managed to pull his attention away from Cas to pay attention to the story Anna’s trying to tell. He’s settled in and clutching a cup of coffee in his hands. He didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, after all. Not that he’s complaining.
Cas plans to let Dean sleep for a few hours, so he picks one of Castiel’s more pleasant memories to revisit. Smiling, he lets it sift through him.
— turns, not letting his hand move off Dean’s back, and smiles at Tessa. “Thanks for having a soft spot for my brother.”
Gabriel waves wildly at him when he looks up. She’s got her butt in one seat, and her feet up in another. Cas glares at her for the potato chip assault, but she just gives him a simpering smile. “Hey, it’s my wedding, I paid for three nights for all of you guys at The Seafoam, I think I’m entitled,” she says. Dean catches her later, having vacated both of the seats to let Kali sit in one of ‘em and then perch on her lap. Their heads are bent together and they’re – giggling over something, which is a bit disturbing coming from Gabriel.
“They can never make up for what they did to you, either.” They’re leaning so close Dean can practically feel Cas’ breath on his face. “I hope you know that.”
Cas’ brow furrows. “To attempt to locate a beer for you,” he answers, voice completely serious. Dean sputters, because he’s honestly not sure if he’s kidding or not. Cas has a weird sense of humor lately.
When he walks out, it seems like half the people waiting there wrench their eyes away from the shack. They’re clearly trying to pretend that they weren’t very pointedly waiting for him to emerge from the shack as a total mess.
He closes his eyes as they slip deeper into the kiss, and lets the images on the television screen disappear.
over Dean. All he can do is stand his ground and look straight up into those oddly dead eyes. “You’d know, right,” Dean returns, not a trace of a quiver in his voice. “Because you’re such a good trainer.”
“I’m not going back to Heaven,” Cas says. Considering that the words tilt Dean off his axis, and must have even more significance for Cas, he speaks them impressively calmly. “If the angels want my help again, in order to
In the car, Dean taps Cas’ thigh. He’s not gonna get the guy’s attention otherwise. “Hey, stop the car,” Dean tells him. Cas is getting better at this; Dean’s head doesn’t nearly go through the window and there’s no ungodly screech with Cas’ foot jamming on the brakes, at least. Together, they walk toward Sam. “About what?” Dean asks, smiling.
He still feels like there’s a nasty gash torn open on his side. But there’s no one whose hands he wants tending the wound other than Cas.
Most farms, though, aren’t painted the shade of blue in the circle over Dean’s shoulder. Other farms have furniture that matches, not a bunch of tables and chairs that Dean and Cas carved themselves. Depending on what mood they were in that day, they made all kinds of styles, and all of it is strewn throughout the house. Dean’s forever pushing mismatched chairs back into place when Cas absentmindedly leaves them elsewhere.
So Castiel heals him. He aches to wipe every imperfection from Dean’s body, but Righteous Man or not, he’s still a soul stuck in humanity, and there’s still evil out there.
to stay away all those months. Were you even yourself, man? I saw your eyes go yellow back when you zapped Dagon. Something with yellow eyes only fucked up
In a surprising gesture, Hannah and Uriel remembered to bring pie, not fuckin’ cake or stupidly trendy, treacly cupcakes. One of the pies is key lime, which is a tragedy, but the other one’s good ol’ cherry, still piping hot and obscenely red when sliced open. It’s flaky and delicious, and Dean’s sure he makes some absolutely disgusting noises while he gobbles it down, but Cas just smiles indulgently at him. Anna eats like a wolf, too, so they’re probably all used to it.
“You don’t want this,” Cas tells Mewtwo, fiercely. “I was just like you. Power they couldn’t control, power they salivated over. They made me into what they wanted me to be, their toy, their
is for him, but sometimes he thinks he’s circling his wagons in the general vicinity, as close as he’ll get.)
She stays there with Bobby for a while, in silence, until the navy-black ash in the air starts to go hazy gray. That’s as light as it ever gets around here. One of the other hunters gets up and tosses sand on what’s left of the fire. She nods quietly at Mary, then hikes up her own pack on her shoulder and moves away. Bobby squeezes Mary’s shoulder, and trudges off with the group.
That wasn’t a headache, Dean realizes as he hits the ground, motionless, unable to see anything but Crowley’s expensive-ass wingtips and Vaporeon’s wide, panicked,
It would’ve been not only easy but totally understandable for Vaporeon to make a break for it. She wouldn’t have even been running away, she would have been joining in with the rest of the Pokemon. Instead, she stayed close to Dean’s side. That night, she insisted on sleeping next to him, when lately she’d been staunchly keeping off the bed.
Cobalion’s a Steel-type. Strong as Lilith might be, all she gets out of the punch is the crunch of her hand smashing against a hard carapace with no give. The noise from it rings throughout the field; it sounds like an old, rusty bell. She stumbles backward from the force of it, good hand gripping her ruined one. Dean wishes that wasn’t so satisfying to see.
Quicker and far more agile than you’d expect, especially from a Ground-type, Marowak jumps up and slams her club against his skull. Crowley doesn’t even get a word out, just a completely undignified squawk, before he deflates right into the ground.
But the amusement fades away fast. The idea of him, Cas, and a nursery full of baby Pokemon who don’t know the entirety of what lies between them is very much a reality. Dean hears someone saying, on the phone, “Sure, I can do it. I’ll be there soon as I can.” It takes him a beat to realize it was him that said the words.
Dean picks at the hem of the sweater. It’s a nice sweater, one he hasn’t worn in months because he had no occasion, but right now he feels like a Mothim might as well have devoured half of it. “You keep sayin’ she’s formal.”
The Castiel from this dimension has the face Mary is used to. That’s something, at least. Nothing else is even close to the same.
Cas’ wings start thrumming a couple of seconds later; Dean wasn’t expecting it just yet. He finds himself scrambling for a damn vicegrip around Cas’ neck.
raw winters in Icirrus, and he was a teenager. The bricks of the building, onyx and pearl white, spiral higher and higher until the clouds swallow the whole thing up. Grass rings the tower, a hardy breed that resists the choke of frost. A couple of Druddgion crunch through that grass, their kid’s plastic toy colors conspicuous against all the white and dull green, but they ignore the two new intruders. Vaporeon, dressed in a puffy orange jacket, huddles close to Dean’s leg. Staraptor remains steadfastly perched on Cas’ shoulder.
blind, and he knows how the ridiculous drawn-out glances between himself and Castiel must come across — “I don’t need to make anything official, and if I did…”
“Well, that was an interesting talk,” Sam declares. His face is neutral. Too neutral. “I think I’m gonna, uh, make a phone call. See you guys later.”
“She insisted we call her that. Not Gabby, either. Gabe was okay.” Dean had meant his question as confirmation of Gabriel’s identity, but Anna apparently took it as questioning her name. She smiles wistfully down at the picture. “I wish I didn’t look so – cranky. Wouldn’t have been, if I’d known. We all take so much shit for granted.”
Before he speaks, Cas slides his hand over Dean’s forearm. It’s slow, careful, deliberate. Cas has touched him before, and God knows Dean luxuriated in the memory of those touches. God knows he’d put one hand over the spot where Cas’ fingers had warmed him just hours before while he used the other hand to frantically get himself off. But this touch, there’s something new in it, Cas’ searching fingers a seedling curling its way into the sunlight.
Cas knows his eyes are wet when his short speech ends; his voice quivers. When he casts a look over to Dean, though, it’s a relief to see he’s in a similar state. “I –”
Cas’ eyes are slotted open while he does it. Dean wouldn’t put it past Cas not knowing that he’s supposed to close his eyes in this kind of situation, but it seems like more than that. Like he has to drink Dean in.
. Pokemon kibble, probably completely inedible at this point, spills all over the floor. It’s next to a sorta valuable-looking chainlink necklace and a couple of the seemingly hundreds of little figurines strewn across the storage unit.
with Meg. Hell, he teases and gripes at an angel all day and then makes him come at night, stifles his cries with a hand over his mouth so he doesn’t shatter the glass again, and that’s not getting any less bizarre no matter how awesome it is.
Again, serious injuries in Pokemon battle were incredibly rare, and fatalities were all but unheard of. But there were still times when Dean sat in a Pokemon Center for too long, waiting for the nurses and their Blisseys to heal Vaporeon. Every damn time she bounded out from behind the counter and landed right back at Dean’s side, it was a sigh of relief made whole.
Cas laughs. After everything, he really really laughs. Even Staraptor’s looking at Dean with something like fondness lifting her brow.
Another one of the Cubone offers Dean her best attempt at a thumbs-up from behind her mom’s back. It’s almost painfully adorable. Dean tries really hard not to laugh.
,” Kevin says after every call, in heaving breaths, usually lying on the ground. But of course, he’s doing it again the next day. That kid’s gonna be a hell of a fighter, Dean can tell.
Kevin, Linda’s son, works at the nursery too. Dean suspects it’s because the other workers got him an in with Jake; Kevin and Jake talk on Skype all the time now, Kevin and his newly-acquired Riolu following the sharp, deliberate movements of Jake and Medicham. “
Cas removes his fingers as unexpectedly as he’d placed them there, and Dean – well, now he’s man enough to admit to himself that he pouts
Their heads dip together and before Dean can try his best to shove Cas off, because his mouth still tastes like him and that’s
“I get what you were sayin’, before,” Dean says, voice tired. “About feeling different. I get it. Not the same, but Sammy ‘n I were always the freak kids at school. Clothes worn out, staying in motels. Not the way to make friends.”
Cas moves his hands to cup Dean’s jaw. His fingertips dig in just enough that Dean feels woozy when he speaks. But maybe that’s just Cas. “But then I experienced it. It was – with someone I felt nothing deeper for, and I don’t exactly have good memories of what came after –” Dean tightens his grip around Cas’ stomach at that – “but it was more enjoyable than I could have imagined.”
“Well, she’s way cooler than that asshole,” Dean says, puffing his bravado out like Staraptor’s feathers. “You can tell her I said that.”
This is like Magic Fingers times a thousand. If Magic Fingers touched the back of his neck so gently and carefully, like he could ever be worthy of this, and kissed him until he felt his whole body go loose with the passion behind it. If Magic Fingers said
“You didn’t — did you get a weapon or something?” If Cas doesn’t want to fight, well Dean’s not happy but he’s
“And you’re handsome to boot,” Dean returns, even if his heart isn’t in joking right now. “But what about Sam?” That’s what’s really throwing him off, the thoughts of him settling low in his gut and churning, churning, churning. “It’s been years. There’s a chance he doesn’t
He lets his head drop to Cas’ shoulder. They must make a ridiculous tableau, but Dean doesn’t even care. “Let’s do it,” he tells Cas. “Ellie and Jo, they were talking about jobs. The Mary Winchester Pokemon Sanctuary, featuring Dean Winchester and Castiel Malach, part-time Latios.”
“Absol’s on the nursery’s logo,” Tessa told Dean, “and we’ve never been doing better.” She beamed, the big emotional reaction nothing Dean had ever seen from her before, and affectionally scratched the top of Absol’s head. He cooed in response, and bumped his head back against Tessa’s hand.
She takes in the shack, with the forest and enormous blue-capped mountains across the lake. In the other world, the land was buzzed flat – at least, where it wasn’t a dangerous rocky cliff that would slash you into gory ribbons before you died from the fall. Trees were pathetic, twisted and bare things more like sticks stuck in the ground than trees. The only color she saw was in the sickly yellow spotlights the angels used.
. If he’s a teeny bit — weirded out, yeah, that’s it — by the way Cas’ hands practically envelop Inais’ much smaller ones, well he’s not telling anyone anything.
As Latias, Anna rams Giratina right back. Latias and Latios aren’t even a quarter of Giratina’s side, but they’ve got agility on their side. Every time Giratina turns to attack them, he has to whirl his entire body around, and by that point both of them have gotten a few hits in and zipped off to find another vulnerable spot on his body. It’s going alright. It’s really going alright –
“C’mon — oh,” Sam orders, as he opens the door to the kitchen. A guy’s still in there, his hand going back and forth in one constant movement from the bag of cookies he’s got open to his mouth. The entire front of his shirt is strewn with dark crumbs, and the sides of it are starting to split open at the seams. He doesn’t even seem to notice the three intruders into his kitchen, two of them with giant neon water guns and the other in badly mismatched clothes and practically radiating
“I’ll take care of that.” He slips his fingers between Dean’s, which makes him blush harder than he had before, even. “And don’t hold yourself back. The walls here are thick. I want to hear you. Think I’ve wanted it for a long time.”
Ellie smiles at that, for the first time. It’s a shy, but warm smile, in contrast to Jo’s big toothy grin. “Everyone says I’m more like Tamara. I lost my family too. Like – uh –”
Dean’s too used to brushing off any of Cas’ sappy shit. Cas’ shoulders tense a bit, which means he’s likely expecting the dismissal. But this time, Dean just stays silent, and touches his forehead to Castiel’s. They stay there, solid and steady on a smoking battlefield.
Dean stands at the doorway. He looks sick, pale in the face and miserable. He looks like hope, poured down into one human, enough to make his hands shake and his eyes go shiny with it.
“It’s been months,” Dean says, when he can bear to pull himself away from Cas. He feels every follicle of stubble pushing its way up on Cas’ neck under his lips, and it already feels stupidly intimate. It already feels like
It’s a quiet walk downstairs. Sam wishes he could say something, the perfect words, but he’s never been good at that no matter how hard he tries. All he can think to do is gesture widely once they reach the door.
She takes him out for coffee. Over her frothy, sugar-crusted latte and Dean’s black Unovan brew, she asks him, flat-out, if Cas broke up with him.
“In one day?” Anna punches his shoulder. “Look at you, Cas.” Her expression drops into something much more serious. “But, uh, not to ruin the party, but the info we found on the disk. It’s not good. Whoever Marv was working for, they’ve got people on the inside in Edlund, have for months. It’s how they managed to take over the nursery. They’ve been going after Edlund.”
Dean can tell Cas wants to argue against what he’s saying. But he just catches his eyes and keeps staring, so that’s something.
better than the looks he gives him when Cas actually does come on the missions, and Dean pulls the angel aside to ask him some stupid question about whether his angel knowledge can help them out.
Dean realizes this version of himself, the one who says awful, hurtful things without thinking, is not the one she knows. She expects better of him. It’s a strange thought.
But that expression, it’s wiped clean when she stabs him hard through the heart and his eyes go blinding white.
Still, when Dean looks at Lucas’ Hydreigon, he finds himself cringing more than anything else. Her eyes are flat and expressionless, lacking the keen luster he’s seen in photos of other Hydreigon. She’s still got the bright purple underbelly and the skinny black wings that rise and fall, but something about her is just… off. It’s a ridiculous thought, considering Hydreigon are one of the most powerful Pokemon in existence and Lucas Christopher’s skill as a trainer was well-known, but Dean wants to scoop her up and take her to Edlund Nursery when this is all over and done with.
Dean sees Flagstaff and Nancy sitting together, so close their knees tap each other as they move. They’re talking quietly, and he makes a point to nod at them. Nancy’s eyes are dinner dish-wide, but she gives him the tiniest nod back, and Flagstaff actually smiles, even if it’s firmly close-lipped. Cas had found Claire and Tracy. Tracy’s Rampardos has a big scoop taken out of his side, like he really is made of only rock, but otherwise, they’re fine. He makes sure they all get on one of the first vehicles going back to Opelucid anyway.
Dean sings to the sky. Purgatory looks different when it isn't dark — pretty, even, with the light dappling through the trees. It’s not giant smears of paint or Hell opening up its screaming maw beneath his feet.
“I could use lunch.” There’s a wry smile on Cas’ face. Dean busies himself with throwing together a sandwich.
Something about Dean is beautiful, even. That’s not an appropriate word for a man, but it applies to Dean. Dean, and his eyes, hard-set as they are most of the time, and his plush lips, the easy rise of his cheekbones. Emmanuel flicks his eyes over to him and, just for a second, it will be like catching a glimpse of someone backlit by a very bright spotlight. It pains him in that instant, but he cannot look away.
“Fun, right?” Cas says. Dean looks over, almost alarmed, but Cas is grinning. It’s gummy and kind of a wonky smile, but it’s a grin nevertheless.
So, Dean and Sam go out on tiny little compartmentalized missions for a while. Nothing too big a deal, even if Sam always brings the guns — the real ones and the garish Super Soakers loaded up with laundry detergent too — and machetes along. Grocery stores, eerily quiet department stores, shit like that. Cas tags along a good amount of the time, and there’s normally at least one other person too, but sometimes he stays behind with Inais or Meg to try and suss out info on Crowley.
Maybe Mary should let him go. There’s probably no good to be had of bringing a vicious warrior angel from one dimension to another just because he happens to bear a resemblance to the angel she’d considered like a son. All logic says this can’t end well.
Not like Dean’s a stranger to insomnia, the hours melting by him as he stares at dark walls. He’s been possessed by dull worry and far sharper panic. He hasn’t wanted to face his nightmares. He’d been in Hell, and hadn’t needed sleep. He’d had some apocalyptic baddie breathing down his neck, or evil’s little tramp stamp burnt into his arm. And sometimes, it’d been as simple as Sam snoring loud enough to bring the fuckin’ house down in the other motel bed.
“He’s even weirder than I am.” He’s never gonna get used to that wicked smile across her mouth, more a slash than a smile even, but he still isn’t used to having actual
“Not everything is your fault, Dean,” Cas tells him, and Dean flinches when Cas’ fingers curl around his elbow. Because even as he’s saying it, the clothes from the hospital are still hanging off Cas, all baggy and
“Dunno what’s good for you yet,” Sam says, wary, passing him a large plate. There’s whole wheat bread on it, spotted with butter here and there. “This should be okay.”
“I’d probably burn my apartment down if I tried to make anything like this. Big kitchen, no idea what to do with it.”
Sam pokes his head into Dean’s cabin one day when Dean’s half-asleep, and tells him, “We’re going on a scouting trip.”
That night, he carefully maneuvers Vaporeon out of his room. He feels bad making her stay out, and she gives him the same puzzled look she did outside the store, but there are definitely some things Pokemon should not be present for.
Okay. No freaky Angels Gone Wild to take care of, along with every other friggin’ thing. “So, what have you been doing all this time?”
Kelly doesn’t know if she’s welcome in the Winchesters’ bunker at just any time. She’d bet she probably isn’t. But that’s where she finds herself this afternoon, standing in the kitchen. At least no one else is there yet.
Anna actually looks completely annoyed in the photo frame, where she’s crammed in with another girl. That girl’s flashing the peace sign, mouth wide open like she’s mid-word. Her hair’s short. She looks like trouble. Dean’s pretty sure he’d adore this chick, and he feels a funny stutter in his gut over someone he doesn’t even know.
Dean’s expecting Alastair to go down in a flurry of feathers and talons. It’d be satisfying as hell. What he gets, instead, is Cas’ voice. “Dean?” When Dean looks at him, clearly confused, Cas tells him, “I think this is your go.”
Instead, he sits next to Cas. It’s probably too close, his side is heavy and warm against Dean’s, but Purgatory’s chill is starting to seep through Dean’s jacket into his skin. He really doesn’t mind. Again, it’s pretty fucking far from normal, and even though he gave Cas a long
He’s walking with Cas, when two of the beasts slink across their path and actually pause. Dean can’t describe what form they’re in, because they keep changing right in front of them, and even Cas does that
, her loyalty to her service greyhound Carina, her gorgeous fucking crossbow, and the very undignified squeak she makes when Claire bites her nipples.
Cas sits up on the edge of the bed, his eyes on Dean. He definitely sees Dean wake up and stretch, roll over in bed so he’s on his back and not his side, but he keeps staring. He hardly even blinks.
Dean can’t help the laugh that blurts out of his mouth. “You’re really not the only one who needs to work on that.”
Dean’s heart rate ticks up. Now or never. “Got lucky enough that someone rescued me. Someone, uh, pretty amazing. Kickass Staraptor, and all, but what I really remember was him. And this crazy blue light he used to knock back Alastair and the goons he brought with him, when they wouldn’t stay down. Scary shit, but the way the guy fought ‘em off was incredible.” Realization dawns over Cas’ face, but Dean presses on anyway. “It was you, Cas. You and Staraptor. And you were – God, you were amazing. I never forgot. I
family. There’s family I’ve wanted to get away from. Family I hated.” Dean thinks of the way Cas’ tone went quick and dark, like the snap of a scissor, when he was talking about his own father. “But not giving a damn – that was never an option.”
Now, Cas looks softer somehow, lighter around his eyes. He gets that look, too, since he left the hospital, and it makes him look creepily human sometimes. “When you said you forgave me, did you —”
There’s nothing else personal in the storage locker. It’s goddamn eerie. There isn’t a single picture of him or Sammy, and Dean’s not surprised by that, even if it cuts a sharp wound into him. That there’s no sign of Mom is stranger; Dean’s only got one photo of Mary, and he carries it in his wallet even though he’s had to tape it together three times.
When Dean was a toddler, couldn’t have been much more than two, he’d stumbled while walking and sliced his knee open on a jagged rock. He couldn’t stop screaming and screaming and screaming, and Mary swore she’d never let him hurt like that again. Guilt radiates out from her gut when she thinks about just how badly she’d failed him there.
“Sure,” he says, anyway, still unable to meet Jack’s eyes. He turns to ask Cas to come with him, but Cas is already following him out of the kitchen without a question. Dean tampers down the thrill that spreads warm through his chest.
cheesy, so he reaches his hand out and takes Cas’ in his own. That’s how they walk through the nursery together. Vaporeon isn’t leaving her wet footprints behind Dean, and Cas’ Staraptor doesn’t circle above their heads in her eternal quiet judgment, but for right now, it’s alright. The two of them together, it’s more than alright.
“Liar.” Dean’s voice carries the same tone. He reaches back and pulls out the lube, the bottle halfway done because it’s been used dozens of times while Dean was imagining – this exact scenario, really. “Heaven’s a bunch of peeping Toms.”
, Claire,” Dean insists, emotions warring in his head and heat blooming over his cheeks. He presses the button to end the call, then sits with his phone in his hand and stares at it for a while.
right back at Mewtwo. Alastair howls in the background, ordering Mewtwo to tear them apart. Dean’s shocked at how little he actually cares.
It’s been maybe an hour of staring into the blank blackness of his room when Dean gets out of bed. Sleep ain’t coming, not without – well. If they’re really doing this
“Not at all,” Anna says with a laugh, not cruel but a little guilty. “I don’t think you can run a Pokemon training center in a city like Opelucid without being –”
Cas’ fingers are back against his wrist. Dean suspects Castiel is letting himself sense his silly human feelings, the deep maw inside him, and he’s trying to stop himself from diving into them. Cas is real and solid and always
rolls her eyes at him, and nudges at the door a bit until it opens and she can slip through, leaving it ajar. This might not be a very remarkable building, but there’s clearly some sort of protection on it. Dean and Cas follow Espeon, walking single file up a skinny, creaking staircase to the fourth story.
“Fine,” he grumbles. “I — a lot happened. That’s really all I can say about it, Sammy.” Dean offers Sam a half-cringing shrug, because it’s
What Dean feels now, it’s none of those. It’s every part of him crying out for the need to touch. The only thing that can rock him to sleep, he knows, is skin on skin. He’s fucked himself into exhaustion a few dozen times when he was lonely on the road, sure, but this doesn’t even need to be any kind of sexy touching, and it definitely shouldn’t be with the bartender of the night. Palm to palm with Cas would do it.
But there wasn’t much of that here in Unova. Reshiram and Zekrom kept the universe balanced, and the Swords of Justice protected them, but they did it from a distance. The only person out there praying to any legendary Pokemon was Dean himself, apparently.
is and isn’t even gonna bother to comment on it, it’s so sad. “Inais is… he’s friendlier than Castiel. He didn’t…” She trails off, and takes another bite of salad. “Got along with Paschal, too, while he was here.” Dean doesn’t even know the guy, and he was probably just another asshole angel, but something inside him still twists unpleasantly at the way Claire’s voice gets a little wobbly at the end.
He wants Cas all over him, even in his most vulnerable bits. Maybe even especially that. He needs that warmth, the comfort that ticks his heart rate up and sends blood pumping through him all the same. Cas is his craving, something sunk into the marrow of his bones from the moment they met. He’s a map and a compass all at once, all of it bringing him home.
Quietly, so only she can hear, he says, “You don’t have to go out there. It’s hard – it’s been hard, for
It’s late when Vaporeon starts scratching at the tiny window in the hotel room, pushing aside the curtains so she can poke the glass and leave it dripping wet where her paws make impact. The hotel room’s super nice, sure, but it’s also bone-dry and needs some sort of humidifier; Dean’s not surprised Vaporeon’s complaining. The bathroom has a shower, but no tub, and she didn’t fit in the sink either. If he put Vaporeon in the bathroom, he’d soak the floor.
THANKS 2 ANY SQUAD MEMBERS I DIDN’T MENTION ALREADY. You guys have been my sanity these past months.
Suddenly he’s hauled up as easily as if he were one of those Substitute dolls. His legs kick in the air, but they don’t feel like they belong to him any more. He’s too caught in the moment, like the walls of Mt. Coronet have suddenly narrowed in and forced him here, and simultaneously completely detached. Desolately, he wonders if that’s what Cas feels like right now, if he’s even aware he’s Cas any more.
is familiar with, even — but he slides them around the smaller one. It’s tender and there’s love behind it, but it’s not romantic.
“Yes, sir.” Dean can’t tell if Zachariah’s this nauseatingly obsequious because it’s truly his personality, or because he’s trying to ingratiate himself with Lucas. Then again, Dean’s pretty sure Zach’s entire personality is ingratiating himself and ignoring the scores of kids he adopted when not being outright cruel to them.
With the motley crew of college kids in front of them, Dean thinks about the girl who pointed them in this direction in the first place. “Nancy,” he says to Cas. “We gotta go back.”
Cas glances away. After a long while, Dean stands up. “Gonna get some shut-eye, that drive sucked,” he snarls. There’s a sour taste under his tongue; his heart slithers out of place. His footprints are heavy as he increases the distance between him and Cas, and every one of them fires a message of
“Dean, I’m not – hell, I’m not even as old as you are, technically,” she teases. The light tone drops away to seriousness as she says her next words. “But I’ve seen enough people in this life choose misery and deny themselves any sort of happiness. I’ve seen enough people spurn
Dean looks up with a start, his heart thudding so hard it makes his entire mouth taste like copper. Staraptor’s poking at his hand, gingerly. But as much as he loves her, that’s not what catches Dean’s attention as much as the man standing in front of the table.
He remembers his heart rattling in his chest as he bolted away from Cas that night, only to look back and find Vaporeon looking back at him from Cas’ side with her head tilted.
Still, Dean’s not impressed. “Where’s Tessa? Or Jody? Or anyone else who works here?” He thinks of Victor, who sure as hell wouldn’t let himself be bullied into anything; the idea of any
That means Dean sees the Staraptor, gliding near the rafters, long before he sees her owner. She turns his heartbeat into uneven thuds, because – he
Carefully, others press their way past Steelix’s enormous body and face to climb into the room. Cas is the first to emerge, and Dean didn’t think his heart could rat-a-tat any faster but he was wrong. Anna follows him. Victor’s after her, in full Opelucid Police gear, the four Swords of Justice glaring in gold from the badge above his heart.
“I didn’t think you would want to.” There’s a wry smile on Cas’ face. “Anywhere else in the bunker you thought about?”
They break apart eventually, though they only put a sliver of distance between them. Dean’s hand slides up to cradle Cas’ cheek. “How did you –”
This crappy fucking rental car isn’t nearly as comfortable as his baby was, and Dean finds himself waking up two and a half hours later. He peels the jacket and plaid overshirt from his shoulders and punches them into some semblance of a pillow. He’s still kinda drunk, but it’s fuzzy drunk, numb, comfortable.
“Careful,” Dean murmurs. “Almost done.” He’s drawing short strokes now, the fire-like flare clinging to the protective circle of the tattoo. His spare hand has gone flat over Castiel’s heartbeat, as if his palm’s cradling it there. “There ya go.” The cap goes back on top of the marker with a satisfying little click.
, he’s back again. The touch of Cas’ lips is gentle, careful, like Dean’s something precious. When Cas touches him, he could start to believe it.
. So I might’ve… accessed their personal funds and redirected some money they’ll never miss into the coffers of good ol’ Edlund Pokemon Nursery.”
Jimmying the lock for the maintenance door toward the back of the dorm is easy enough, even if they all have to crawl through some bramble patches. The three of them practically friggin’ tiptoe through the dorm hallway. Dean’s hoping no one’s patrolling these hallways. Either they’d be like the creeps who took way too much interest in Sam and his buddies, way too similar to the goons currently occupying the nursery at Edlund – or worse, they’d be just another college student with no idea what’s going on. Dean’s not gonna let whatever tentative plans they’re forming fall to bits because he got into a fight with some kid.
“Of course.” Kelly’s not sure how she could ever say no to her son. Her perfect son, all hers, even after everything the Devil and the universe tried to throw at her.
“Oh, sure,” Bobby says, though. He doesn’t move from his seat, but he glares up at Dean. “I don’t have much better to do then go through all these books looking for magical werewolf poison antidotes so I can fix your angel’s coat.”
The massager’s stuck half in Cas and half out, and his hips are doing these desperate sort of thrusts trying to get it back into himself. Dean grins as he tugs the vibrating black plastic out – they’re gonna have to use this thing when Cas isn’t in heat, because it’ll make him scream anyway, arch and moan and beg even without crazy angel biology doing it to him – and lets it fall with a heavy thud against the window.
Cas doesn’t answer with words. His hands settle at Dean’s sides, holding him carefully. Dean feels like he has a hundred, a thousand handprints glowing red on his skin. The warmth of them, he falls into it, and it rocks him to sleep.
; Dean’s never seen anything like it. “We were hired by Edlund University! Something about them feeling like Jody and Tessa, bless their precious hearts, weren’t doing their part to promote the Pokemon nursery.”
And then he was gone again, and all Dean could do was shift his jaw and avoid the subject as much as possible. Fucking Cas. Guy came back twice in six months and disappeared about five minutes after that anew.
It’s Daphne, wearing leggings and a long blouse and looking much younger than when he met her. Still.
“I must have startled you,” Cas says. It’s not an apology, but Dean figures it might be one from this guy. Dean gets it; he doesn’t say
Cas sits up in bed so easily. And then that’s it, the skin-to-skin connection everywhere Dean was craving, always craved. It’s cool in his room, but they’re both a little sticky by now, so it’s hard to pull away. That ain’t a bad thing.
Cas has a grouchy face on, which absolutely means he’s been called out. Life’s pretty funny when it makes Heaven’s most feared warrior afraid to knock on his best friend’s door. “I didn’t want to wake you up.”
In this position, Cas can’t run his fingers so freely over Dean’s body. Dean’d be grouchy about that, only now he keeps brushing them over the expanse of his back and his shoulders. “You’re strong here,” Cas says.
Dean feels his breath stick in his throat, because, well, shit. “I knew Gordon, yeah,” he gets out, but he hears how tight his voice is. Abby must’ve been his sister, shit. “He was another hunter. Got himself turned into a vampire. Sam cut his head right off with barbed wire. It was pretty badass.” He attempts a laugh, but it comes out hollow, and fuck, Cas is actually pouting at him.
“Over millions of years, Pokemon evolved not to kill unless it was for food.” Dean hopes it sounds way more like
When they get back to the van, the other three are already there, still holding their water guns like they’re preparing for an attack. “Ran into a Leviathan going through one of the houses,” Marin tells them. When Dean looks closer, he sees that her black polo’s splattered with black goop, too. “Took care of it.”
“You realize the aliens that say that are always secretly out to enslave the world, right?” Dean doesn’t welcome her in. But he doesn’t shut the door, either. He notices Flagstaff, a little ways down the hallway outside their room, her arms crossed in front of her. Her Garchomp’s slumped lazily against the wall, back firm against it and fin arms drooping down. His pose would stand in hilarious contrast to his owner if the situation wasn’t so fraught.
It’s early the next morning when Cas looks at Dean and declares, “I think I may need some help grooming Staraptor.” Thankfully, the bus is pretty empty that morning, so no one’s gonna be bothered by the weird guys with the giant, haughty bird.
Claire’s understandably a little distracted at that, but she manages to get words out eventually. “They’re good and like,
“It brings the house down.” Cas sounds more wry than dry, but the guy’s so hard to decode that Dean isn’t sure whether he was joking or serious. “Do you have a favorite song?”
gathered at the ceremony, and perhaps, more importantly, Gabriel’s involvement. The biggest issue is how loudly Whimsicott cries, big awkward sobs from where he’s cuddled in Hannah’s lap.
The chairs propped outside the bar are old and rickety and creak dangerously under his weight, but Sam sinks into one anyway. “I knew Aiden,” he says. “Met him once, years ago. He was kind of a, uh, bratty kid when I met him –”
Dean rears back, and for a split second he doesn’t worry about giving himself away when something that goddamn barbaric is going on in front of him. He senses the recoil from everyone around him, the sheer disgust, the shock.
“Don’t attack the Cubone!” Dean howls out, even if his voice is already worn down. “Don’t –” But most of the people with him have rushed off to the heat of battle, leaving him behind. Dean recognizes what he has to do, nods to himself, and scoops up three of the baby Cubone in his arms. “Staraptor, try and hold ‘em off!” He’s sure she will. If anyone could give her owner a good fight in terms of tenaciousness, it was Staraptor.
Actually, no – he didn’t disappear. That would’ve been better, the rush of wings and then nothing ever again, because Dean would’ve ached and hated it but Cas would’ve been alright. Cas could take care of himself, after all. No, Cas didn’t disappear. He got fangs and black veins sneaking up his neck instead, or screamed – Cas fucking
Dean bites back nervous laughter. He still can’t quite figure out Claire, just that she spends most of her time talking to the angels in hushed tones and glaring at anyone who tries to butt into the conversation, but he knows that he takes her awfully seriously for whatever reason. “What do you say?” he asks Sam.
ago, douchebag,” Dean growls out, taking a step forward. Dude reeks like a goddamn swamp. “I’m working on that.”
Delta plucks at the scarf with two fingers. “I’m Darkrai,” she returns, her voice tinged with both exasperation and amusement. She sinks a hand into the goopy mass on her shoulder. “He thought it was funny to do the Ditto thing.” Dean wasn’t really aware Delta, or any Pokemon associated with her, had much of a sense of humor at all. But live and learn.
“Hey Jody.” He still needs a coffee shower, but there’s no morning roughness to his voice, at least.
Sam hazards a look over at his brother, still standing ramrod straight. He’s too close to what’s left of the shack. His figure is just a silhouette against the fire’s light. Sam keeps an eye on Dean, afraid of him getting swallowed up in that fire if he looks away too long.
The only color in Purgatory was all that red, eyes and the occasional patch of blood-soaked dirt. Everything else faded to black and white after a while, with a flash of tan. Dean wonders if he’s breathing too hard, because it feels like he’s never going to be able to take in anything like this again.
He never thought hearing Cas use the Batman voice again would be a relief, but Dean’s breath caught in his throat in gratitude when he heard Cas growl out,
Most of the time, the tattoos on Dean’s arms made him feel lonelier. He’d look at them, the leaves that drifted down his arm lazily, and think about what he’d lost. But here and now, he’s just thinking about what he’s got, and how what he had isn’t gone just because it’s in the past.
“I’m glad we agree,” Cas says, their gaze caught tight between each other. “Not that I had much of a good time in boarding school. All boys. Most of them didn’t accept, you know, a gay student very much.” Dean would expect a flinch from Cas, or his cheeks to flush. There’s none of it.
Dean’s gotten a lot of glances like that in his life. Mostly from strangers, just innocent bystanders, but truth be told he’d interacted with fewer and fewer of those as time went on. Or maybe he drove them away, something in the set of his shoulders and his gait that was a giant neon flashing
Lucas’ tail lashes out and rips down a row of trees in the glade. His scream shatters rocks scattered through the field, and has everyone on both sides ducking and covering their ears.
“I get how feeling like a freak can wear on you. I hope you meet Sammy one day, you two’d get along.” Dean swallows; he’s not sure how much he should divulge from Sam, but he pushes on anyway. “People were always a bit… freaked by him, and it wasn’t fair. He just wanted to be normal, but he ended up with Espeon. He loves her, I know that, but the day she evolved he came home crying. Somethin’ about how he was always destined to be the freak.”
But then, Dean finds himself saying, “I do, I really do,” and he’s sliding into the bed next to Cas. There isn’t anything untoward about it. He’s wearing the Henley he wore during the day, smelling like wood chips from the center and salt from the ocean, the scent that sticks to Vaporeon. He’s got thick pajama pants on, too. But he feels naked. Worse than naked, he feels flayed, peeled open, and exposed by little more than Cas’ eyes on him.
of all people making movie references, when four very familiar figures walk up to them. They’re hesitant, their steps slow and deliberate, like
It’s not sad, though. The smile on his face when he sees Dean – it’s anything but. If anything, it just proves where he belongs. One not-man, here to do what he can on Earth.
, so he takes Cas’ hand in his own and guides it down, down, down, until it reaches right between his legs. The flash of Cas’ skin made his own react in ways he couldn’t stop, didn’t want to.
His lips have gone dry and tight from licking over them, so he wraps them around Cas’ new erection. He just goes for a couple of dips back and forth, because it’s like Cas’ heat is getting to him too and he needs to feel it in the back of his throat. Like it’ll flicker underneath his tongue and fill him up all at once.
“Howdy,” the older woman greets. Dean’s never been struck by such a maternal vibe from someone before, and it makes something funny twist in him. She’s way more rough-and-tumble than his mom would have ever been, wearing plaid and talking in an accent with a twang, but she’s around the age his mom would’ve been if she was still alive.
“Probably not, but neither was, you know, talking to the guy in the first place.” Dean keeps walking, willing himself not to crunch too many branches underfoot. The density of the woods jams them close together, and Dean tries to ignore how close Cas is; he can feel the brush of the trenchcoat against his calves.
“Got worried I wouldn’t see you again, Dean,” she trills, and it’s disturbing as Hell — ha, bad word choice — that she can look so different now, but have the exact same stride and quirk to her lips. “I’d gotten disturbingly attached.”
Staraptor stumbles over to him. She clearly took a bad hit from Michael’s Dragonite, but she nudges at his arm in impatience. “You ready to go?” Firmly, she nods her head. “Take Down, then.”
They head out toward the light source. After hours in this cave, dark as the night sky without a star or light pollution to mar it, its glow might as well be a beacon.
He pulls out his phone. Dean’s not surprised to see his generic background; in fact, he’s more surprised he has a cell phone at all. Somehow he can’t picture Cas browsing Facebook. Cas scrolls through his photos until he finds one of himself with the pretty redhead who sometimes picks him up at the nursery.
“Yeah, but you know what I mean. Charlie taught herself to hack some of the best security systems in the whole continent. Can’t help but feel like if there was some way to figure out these
“You wouldn’t,” Dean points out, “because that’d be torturing Ellen too, and Krissy and Michael and Asher. And you wouldn’t wanna do that to them, now would you?”
That’s not really what calls Dean’s attention, though. That’s all on the two older women. One of them is Naomi, serious as ever, her Gothielle solemn behind her. And the other woman – it’s his mom.
“Knew that too.” Dean still slides in a little closer to Castiel, like he’s seeking confirmation. It’s true, anyway, the way Sam’s there for him, and everyone else, the fact that he can play board games with Jody and kick back shots with Sarah and Tamara and freakin’
She hesitates for barely a second. It’s the amount of time only a hunter, desperately looking for some kind of weakness, could notice. “I’d heard Azazel was gone,” she says, “but I didn’t think it was one of
“Chill out with the compliments. No need to get so effusive.” Castiel’s brow crinkles, hard from his forehead, not like Cas. Dean presses on. “I went to Hell to save Sam. This douchebag demon was playing Hunger Games with a bunch of – God, they were really kids. Must’ve been ten years ago. Sam, he – he almost made it out.”
“I got ticked off at those protesters for making me late,” Dean grumbles. “You saw it. I’m such an asshole.”
, it’s only Pokemon wreaking havoc on technology. Murkrows and Mandibuzz, tricksters by nature, mess up any airborne wires; anything the tech companies set up underground is at the mercy of Diglett, Drilbur, and Onix.
She’d be easy to miss. She’s small, no bigger than Vaporeon, and moves like a dart. Her purple fur is inky dark and blends into the shadows cast by the buildings.
He’s wearing lumpy gray robes, wrapped around the entirety of his body. They must hinder movement, but Hannah had explained, blank-faced and flat-voiced, that he was extremely well-trained in combat, so Mary should be careful. It makes Mary sick to walk along with her gun trained on his back, but she’s done enough awful things out of necessity.
a lot of people where Vaporeon came from. They probably assume he comes from the rich part of the city when they see him with a Pokemon as valued as Vaporeon, even with the workmanlike boots, jeans going thin around the knees, and janky tattoos. “Uh, when my – my dad wanted me and my brother to become trainers as soon as possible. He knew an Eevee breeder.” Because his mom had volunteered there, and they felt so terrible after her death, they were willing to help them out in any way they could. Of course, to John,
Dean smiles. It’s tight but genuine. “You’re right. I am. And – you’re right. Cas, your mom, they’re really good people. You’re lucky to have them.
“Well, a mix tape is a way you listen to music in this… universe. You gotta make ‘em, put the songs on them yourself. Took me a couple hours to make.”
She laughs. “We got out of Purgatory, Dean. Don’t think there are too many others out there like us.” And okay, that’s creepy. Before, Dean might’ve tried to run away or worse, gut her, but this world’s made everything and everyone honest.
doing it, his body lean in some places and thick in others, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth, how Emmanuel’s eyes would flit desperately from his face to his cock –
“Sure.” Dean laughs, even. He dips two fingers into the honey and makes a big deal of sucking them off, licking hot and wet over his fingers, because he’s hungrier than he thought. This honey’s kind of flat-tasting, but it’s still sweet and the best thing he’s had since that sandwich. Cas says nothing in response to his noises, just looks, curiosity and something deeper coloring his gaze.
to button it up – and jeans, cinched hard at the waist because they’d likely fall down otherwise. Okay, so Dean had been a little curious to see what Cas looked like in anything other than his normal clothes, but he could barely tell with what Cas was wearing now. Nothing fit very well.
