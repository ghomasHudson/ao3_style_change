And so they both spend their whole Saturday following both suspects around through London, keeping each other updated through texts and phone calls. John followed Marc Jenkins. The man went for groceries in the morning, followed with a visit to his mother in the retirement home. But after that the man went back to his house, settling himself in his atelier in his backyard, painting the rest of the day. John was on a stake out in the rental car Sherlock had arranged for him, and even with the binoculars he could barely see the man from his parking spot at the end of the street. After his fourth cup of coffee he decided to call it a day, and he called Sherlock on his mobile.
"I cried myself to sleep that night. And I didn't bother to get out the next morning. When I finally managed to face the world again that evening, I went into my livingroom and found a single note on my table.
"Hmmm... You prefer my presence above that of an brain dead zombie?"
He had given up. Somehow this man had broken him down in just a few hours, reduced him to a pathetic hump of pain of what once had been a human man. It was no use. Even if he managed to get his ankles and wrists free, he still was unable to walk. He wasn't even able to move at this moment, or control his bladder, and the longer he was laying here, the stiffer his body got. The pain had become a dull throb, unless his body shivered again. Then his injuries flamed up again, and he would pass out.
"Does this turn you on?"
"O god. What happened?"
He took a seat behind his desk and pulled the pencil box out of his bag, putting it at his left side on the desk. Then he studied the object in the center of the room. There was a low bench in the middle of the room. Esmeralda threw a white sheet over it while Sherlock emerged from the small room where he dressed himself. He was wearing his dressing gown, and he looked more like himself than like Gerald with it. Barefooted he walked towards the low bench, and when his eyes met John's, he gave him a small smile. Gracefully he got onto the bench and turned his back towards the students. He sat himself down in a cross-legged position and shrugged of his gown. He stretched his neck before settling his arms on the wooden backrest spreading his arms wide. His long arms made his hands almost reach the left and right end of the object. The pose made his back wider, his shoulder blades more expressive. Sherlock shifted a bit, and brought his left arm up, his elbow still on the backrest, his hand settling itself under his chin. When he was comfortable, he closed his eyes. Esmeralda pulled away the dressing gown straddling his hips, and John could see the posh black boxer he was wearing underneath. When Esmeralda returned with another white sheet, john felt relieved. She arranged it around Sherlock's hips and covered his legs with it, but then she pulled the back down a bit, including his boxers.
"There we go."
"You'll survive. You did manage to get over ten years without it."
It was the first thing he had said to him since leaving the art school Tuesday evening, if you didn't count in the 'Hmmm's'. And of course he was being the bloody mind reader again.
"Can I get you anything? Water?"
"Hello Donna, John. Can I get you any tea or... Oh!"
Next chapter will be up on Wednesday!
"Well, yes. It's a state of mind. And the pose isn't that hard. Esmeralda told me that you're all doing very well and that next week we will take a new pose."
A pause.
"Well, thank you, John. But I was talking about your new pencils."
Right Ankle: Swelling, tenderness, pain, stiffness; Sprained ankle.
"Yes. To tell him that everything is going according plan."
Sherlock frowned. It was a weekday. John never drank alcohol on weekdays. As if John could hear his thoughts he walked back into the living room with two glasses and a bottle of whiskey in his hands.
"Please, never change."
"I did. I never believed you lied to me all that time we were together. I never believed a thing you said on that phone call."
"In a bit. Just going to smoke this one first."
They were greeted by Major Barrymore, who still looked angry at them for their last visit. And after a short briefing, they were send down. The lab where the virus had spread was in quarantine, and there was only one lab technician at work there. No one could go in, and she couldn't come out. All the other chemists working the medicine were infected, so she was on her own. The virus was dangerous, and it had to be controlled as soon as possible. It was out of the question to bring in other specialists. It had to be kept a secret. They were afraid that there would be a mass hysteria if the world heard of what had happened. (Something to do with a zombie apocalypse.)
"But Sherlock..."
"Have I told you I liked you already?"
Sherlock sat down and did as she asked.
"Shut up."
“Yes, hi, I'm Doctor Watson, and this is Sherlock Holmes. We were asked to help out.”
"By an infected?"
"Have you seen person two?"
"I can't, gorgeous. I'm going back to work."
John looked at the sketch he made on the paper in front of him. The lines were a perfect match with the study object in front of him. It was time to add the first shadows to his work. But not before they all had taken a break.
"Shhhh... easy there. Don't harm the goods. We don't want to make a mess, yet, do we?"
I'm sorry that I had to leave you, and I'm sorry that I'm not coming back after all. I'm going to close my eyes now, and embrace the darkness that awaits me. But thinking of you while I'm doing that, will make it all worth it.
"Right." John walked towards the car.
He was trying to get his weight on his toes, so his hands would get some more blood. He already couldn't feel his fingers. He really needed his fingers. They were important.
"My death?"
"Care to share?"
"No."
Sherlock grinned at himself. Yes. He had something to do now, something inside the house, something to help John, and something he knew he was good at.
"This is stupid. I'm going to kill of one of my remaining three subjects."
"Look at you. You really are gorgeous like this. I made you like this, I reinvented you."
“To dangerous. Everything here is contaminated. We cant risk the virus to spread.”
She was gone.
"That ain't necessary." A high pitched voice behind them said. Nita and John turned around, to see a small sixty something woman. She was wearing two coats and several scarfs. She winked at John and grinned her ugly teeth bare.
"I'll meet you tonight at the art school?"
Ava blew out the smoke.
Sherlock put the yogurt aside, wincing a bit when he turned his upper body.
"Hmmm?"
"Good morning."
"Of course he did."
"The last CCTV image of him was at Charing Cross Road heading towards Bearstreet. We lost sight of him there."
John turned around towards the door and took his coat from the rack. Sherlock could only follow him. He tried not to stare at the man in front of him. Which was obviously impossible at the moment. He just hoped that John wouldn't turn around before Sherlock had managed to wrap himself in his Belstaff so he could hide certain reactions that his body produced at the sight of this 'show-off' John.
"Good morning to you too."
Sherlock shoved his chair back and stood up to go pace through the room.
"That because I'm a pretty girl and I'm smart. And because I'm behind glass. It's safe for you to like me. You've got nothing to lose."
"Yes, they can."
When John returned only half a minute later, Sherlock was sound asleep again.
"Yet. Let's see how long it takes before they do. I got here the last three times. But it never seems to hold longer than a few hours. Keep the screen up, I'm coming back."
"I'm looking for Nita. Have you seen her?"
"No. Otherwise they will lock me up with the others and never look for a solution for this."
She turned inside an empty room and closed the door behind them as good as it could.
David shot his cigarette away.
I always tried to hide the affection I felt for you, scared that it would drive you away. The first time I lied my eyes on you I already thought that you were an attractive man. Although I keep myself from that kind of sentiment, I can admire a beautiful sight when I see one. And you were one. Are one. I thought about forgetting the whole flatmate thing and seduce you, to have you for one night and then to get rid of you. It had been quite a while since I had sexual intercourse, but you were definitely my type. Even though you stated that you weren't gay, I know I could have persuaded you to give me pleasure. But I'm happy I didn't do that. You managed to give me so much more than just one night of gratification, you took it so much further. Not only the package you came into was attractive. You made me see that what's inside you is even more important. That was the thing that made the first crack in my shield. Your smile made my day. I tried to make you smile whenever I could, without you noticing, of course. But it became harder and harder. I taught you to well. You seemed to absorb my deduction skills and to use them whenever you wanted. I'm sure you've seen the affection in my eyes from time to time, but probably didn't notice how deep and real they really were.
"Gregory." He said, while getting his coat off.
I love this chapter, but a little warning: It's a heavy one!
"Right. I think I'm going back to the hostel. Give you two some time." John stood up and smiled a bit at Ava.
"I'm dying. I'm bloody dying and then you find me."
"Hmmm."
"And you don't foresee any... difficulties in the nearby future with that straightness of yours?"
What was he thinking?!
Sherlock looked up from his phone tot the man on his right, steering the rental car over the road.
"Never helped before. They are brain dead. There just so much we can do."
John was in the cafeteria having a boring conversation with Marc Jenkins. The man wasn't a talker, and John had to pull the words out of him. They talked about everyday stuff, the weather, cars, and so about the new car the man had bought.
He got up from his desk chair and walked towards his coat, grabbing his pack out of his pocket.
After a few minutes of waiting and observing, he slowly started moving again, sure that he didn't wake up anyone, and reached the door of the atelier. It was closed with a lock. John grimaced at the familiarity of the type of lock and reached inside his pockets. He took out a small pack with Sherlock's lock picking kit, glad that he had taken the time to learn from him. John wasn't as fast with it as Sherlock was, and he definitely made more noise than he wanted to, but eventually the lock clicked open. Pushing back the impulse to storm inside, he put his ear against the door, listening if he could hear anything. He rather not wanted to walk in and come face to face with Marc. But all he heard was silence.
"I thought it was a dream. I died and went to heaven. I already thought is was weird that the angel had your face. But dreams can be strange, can't they?"
"Yeah...Must be that ridiculous mop of curls you have, gorgeous. You take a seat and go ahead looking at the last test results, I'm going to get coffee. Back in a minute."
Ava turned around to the cage holding Samuel.
"I believe you're lean, but not that lean, pretty. It will never fit. You can't come inside through there."
This couldn't be happening, this couldn't be real. He just got him back. He needed him.
"Sherlock, don't."
"No."
Sherlock was already heading towards the mentioned hatch, and put in his whole pack minus one and a lighter. He studied the small space.
He was too late.
"Special like you."
"I'm getting there, just hear me out. I went from drug den to drug den searching for you. I was sure you were having a danger night. And in my search I met a woman named Nita."
John turned onto his side, trying to think about something else and ignore the awoken lonely butterfly fluttering in his stomach again. He had ended that chapter, closed that book. He just couldn't feel like that anymore. It was too much.
Thanks for all your feedback! Next Chapter will be uploaded Wednesday!
Sherlock had managed to get the six ears he needed for his experiment after all, giving some compliments to Molly that made her skin change a bright pink. (which made Sherlock conclude that that still didn't have the same effect on him as when this happened with John.) And after finishing his experiment there was even an interesting case offered by Lestrade, keeping his mind occupied for at least two whole weeks. But the drawings kept popping up in his mind. The email he was reading now was the best opportunity he had got since he found out about his roommates secret talent.
"John?" A soft raspy voice said.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
" Yes, but barely, he's losing the battle. I need an ambulance, right now. And the police. We're in his atelier behind the house. Suspect is probably sleeping inside the house."
Sherlock shook his head and John went out into the rain. Sherlock sighed again. When he reached for the tea on the table next to him, he saw that John had lied out all his sketchbooks next to it for Sherlock to see.
The second house was empty. As was the third. But the forth one was crowded, and he almost got into a fight about his presence in the house.
"I've been waiting for you all morning. Had some tests running and I hoped I could share the results with someone. But instead of telling my attractive colleague I had to ramble about it to Beth."
"Let's just say that some of them claimed that I don't settle for less."
"Is he single? Or are you two together?"
"Would it be just like on television?"
"Sherlock? Getting fresh air?"
"Please."
Ava showed the syringe with the ampule already inserted.
"I don't care. I'm not going to wait any longer."
"You're cute, John Watson. You're a good man. Use that big heart of yours. Be happy. I'm glad I got to know you, too, and I wish you all the best."
John chuckled, the sound getting lost in the wind that was blowing Sherlock's wet curls in his face.
"I won't. Just getting you a nurse."
John was truly laughing now.
"We have to go slow. Near death experience, remember?"
"In the break you will have plenty of time to get to know each other, but I would like to begin our class now. As you all have noticed, it isn't getting any warmer in here, and I don't want you all to freeze in here. Today we will start with a new model. His name is Gerald, and he's an experienced art model, so we can take our time with him. He will be our subject for the weeks to come. And we will start with a face slash torso study."
He heard Ava say through the intercom. He looked up and gave her a small smile.
"Am I?"
"You should show me. I'll promise I'll be honest."
He felt the butterflies hit the walls of his stomach when he answered her.
The man walked away again. Sherlock couldn't see his movements, as he was hanging with his back towards him. Marc switched the lights on, blinding Sherlock for a few moments. When he could see something again, he tried to see where he was. The space was small. He could see a white wall in front of him, a window with black roller-blinds in front of it at his left, keeping the light in and withdrawing anything happening inside out of sight, with a closed and probably locked door next to it. He could smell paint. So this was probably the man's atelier in the back of his garden.
Get yourself together, Holmes!
"No, running away from his feelings."
When Sherlock ended the call, John looked at him with his eyebrows lifted up almost into his hair.
"I like you."
"I do." John said, a small smile returning on his face. Sherlock smiled back at him. He raised his glass to his lips and took another sip, emptying his glass, copying the sight in front of him. He reached for the bottle and poured them both another one.
"You stay away from John." Sherlock managed to force out. His voice hoarse and cracky.
Sherlock gave him a deadly glare, but started to eat anyway. After he finished his whole plate, he went into the shower and stayed there for over thirty minutes, using almost all the hot water at once. When it was John's turn to go into the shower, he had only five minutes of hot water left, ending his shower with a flush of cold water falling down on him. John cursed and turned the shower off before he was shivering of the cold and stood for the mirror to shave himself. When he got out of the bathroom he could see into Sherlock's room. The man was almost dressed. He was wearing a perfectly tailored pants and suit jacket, with an almost illegal tight shirt underneath.
"Christ. You even sound like him!"
"You know where to find him?"
"Are you alright?"
Slowly, the mist in his head cleared away. John. O god, he needed to find him. He needed to get away from here. He tried to get up again.
“Ava, please. I have the feeling we will see each other a lot these next days to come. So just call me Ava. I would offer you two tea or coffee, but...” She signed at the glass wall between them.
"You can say that, yes."
"Goodbye, Ava."
When he tightened his muscles he whimpered, causing a laugh from the man behind him.
John fisted his hands.
"God. Are you going to warn me?"
"Yes. After two hours of sitting still I can use one of these." He said, pulling his package out of his pocket. He put a cigarette between his lips and thanked David for lighting it.
The man looked like a walking sin.
"You are not in a position to tell me what to do!" Marc screamed. Sherlock could hear the man stand up and walk towards the place where his tools were. By the sound of it he returned with his leather belt thing again.
Because that would be a bit more than not good, and that was something he really wanted to avoid.
"Thank you, little devil. You gave me more than I would have ever hoped for. I'm living the happy life you wished for me, and I'm grateful for that. You have a special place in my heart, Ava. And I'll cherish you there until the end of my days."
Sherlock gazed at him.
The woman chuckled softly.
I always tried to hide my affection for you, wishing you would never figure out what you meant to me. But now I wished that you had. I wished I could have taken you with me and that you were here. Holding me, comforting me. I still would cry, but my tears would be of happiness, of the fact that I had the chance to have you, spend my life with you, knowing that you admired me as much as I admire you.
"Yes. I won't be running after criminals for the first few weeks."
"Last time I saw him we were at Salisbury on Martin's lane."
Sherlock closed his swollen eyes again. The luminous angel with John's face checked him. He could almost feel the eyes going over his body, starting at his feet. Was he trying to figure out if this body was good enough to enter the gates of heaven or something? Or was angel John a doctor, like human John? He heard him take in a sharp breath. What did he find? The dislocated knee? The ruptured testicle? He felt the angel gaze go upward to his chest. Lifting the jacket again.
"Thai. You need to eat something."
"O god. What am I getting myself into?"
The woman on the other side of the glass looked up and smiled at them.
Sherlock's voice had dropped, and it was softer than usual. John tried to smile, but failed at it. His eyes were sad.
"I got scratched."
He was too late.
"You're such a child."
"But... I... you..."
John's lips turned into a smile against Sherlock's skin, while climbing onto the bed to sit behind him. Sherlock was sitting with his back towards John, completely naked. The smaller man's hands tickled along Sherlock's shoulder blades and then stroked his biceps in a promise for something more, earning him a deep rumble from Sherlock's throat.
John was blinded for a moment. He could have known that the room was brightly lit. It was an atelier, after all. He turned away his face from the bright lights and blinked his eyes a few times, to get his vision sharp again. When he finally looked into the room, his heart stopped.
Sherlock worked systematically trough all John's socks, pairing them, and ordering them into the drawer at colour. After twenty minutes his work was done, and he looked to the new made sock index feeling a bit smug. Yes. John would like that. Sherlock turned himself around to get the socks that didn't make his selection and started to gather them. One of them (the hideous patterned one, of course) had rolled himself underneath the bed. Sherlock layed flat on his stomach to reach for it, poking his head underneath the bed, when his eyes saw a carton box hidden away at the head side of the bed, against the wall. Instead of reaching for the lost sock, Sherlock reached out to the box and pulled it from under the bed. He had never seen it before. How could he have missed it when he searched John's room before when he was bored?
She walked out of sight, talking into the phone so he could see her face.
Mycroft observed him and made an decision.
John leaned against his side.
"No what?"
They talked for hours. About themselves, about the stupid things they had done in their lives, about their jobs, their favourite food and wines, and it felt as if they had known each other for years.
"Yes. It seems to move.... different. The cells are ignoring each other instead of clutching together."
'I love you, Sherlock.'
Sherlock closed his eyes again, but kept some consciousness this time.
"First, I'm going to take your coat off and settle you on the sofa, then I'll put on the kettle."
"Okay."
"Ginger nuts? I love ginger nuts!"
"You killed yourself to protect me."
He smiled.
"Than brace yourself it's not a pretty sight."
Head: pressure in the head, temporary loss of consciousness, confusion, seeing stars, ringing in the ears, nausea; Concussion.
Sherlock took the rental and drove to Baskerville alone, eager to begin working this case. It was different from the cases he normally had, and he really liked the chemical aspect of it. When he entered the room of the lab he saw that Ava hadn't been sitting still. There was a table placed against the left part of the glass wall, with a computer screen on top of it.
"Oh. He asked me to come to his house tomorrow and pose for him in his atelier. I declined, obviously."
Sherlock frowned, thinking. But after two minutes he gave up.
"You'll probably know better than me."
The leather belt hit his chest, arms and abdomen. Leaving behind no open wounds or cuts, just bruises. Sherlock felt his head spin from the pain, and he was now shamelessly moaning at every hit he got on his sore body, and when Marc hit him hard in the groin, he passed out.
"Sherlock?" He asked the body laying on the ground against better knowledge. His heart pounded in his ears and the thought of losing this man made him nauseous. The butterflies in his stomach raged in terror, the one that had bitten into his heart began spreading venom. This couldn't be happening, this couldn't be real. He just got him back. He needed him.
The man said.
Sherlock looked up from getting his head through one of the holes of his pyjamas, a bit confused, hearing the change of tone in John's voice.
"Of course, John. I'll make sure it will be safe here. No one will see your work but me, is that alright with you?"
Sherlock knew that if he refused now, John would get really angry (the not good one) and Sherlock wanted to prevent that. Tonight John was going to draw again, and he didn't want to spoil it for him.
"Then she'll find ya. It's Mellon, innit?" Ru said.
Sherlock thought about it for a few seconds.
It was John's voice, but it was the fake John's opinion of Gerald. This wasn't meant for him.
"But I'm thankful that you took this course. It makes me happy to see that there are more people with beautiful talents that use them. Even if they don't show it to the world. And you've let me see some of it."
"London is a crowded city, little devil." He said to her.
Sprained ankle: musculoskeletal injury in which the ligaments of the ankle are torn.
"O well, why not."
"Have you ever had one of these? They are foul."
"You told me you liked me."
"Hello Ava."
"John? Can you forgive me?"
"Sherlock! This is amazing! Wow! Thank you. I'm getting pissed tonight and I'll eat myself nauseous on those cookies. You want to watch?" She grinned at him.
Finally, after five years, he was creating something again.
Together they walked out of the classroom, out of the school and Sherlock flagged down a cab and got in to get them to Bakerstreet. Neither of them said a word.
"Yes, I have. Almost on a daily basis until a few years ago, actually."
"He might be."
Jesus.
"Let's get a cab."
Feelings, they are so unpredictable! And mixing them with alcohol is never a good idea...
"No. I am not."
"That's definitely not gonna happen. You need to stay in that bed."
"Yes. You are correct on that. But not just him."
He looked at John and grinned at him, earning a grin back.
"Yeah. Always 'fraid you'd find out he was using. Always sayin' he'd lose ya over it. That it would kill em. Complete 'nutter, that one."
Esmeralda smiled up at him.
"Hmmm... I can live with that."
While John was getting his coat, Sherlock was already fully dressed, stepping out of the small room connected with the classroom. John could see that he was still wearing the tight jeans, and before Sherlock could pick up the fact that he was staring, John blinked his eyes and looked out of the window. It seemed like it had stopped raining, he absently thought.
"Mellon, thank you." John interrupted the old lady, getting another wink from her and she shuffled off.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
"Do you?"
"Fine."
"God. I can't wait to touch you."
Dislocated shoulder: the humerus separated from the scapula at the shoulder joint. Cartilage, muscle, and other tissues stretched and torn.
The next day, Sherlock didn't talk to him, ignoring him once again, and went to bed early that night, something he almost never did, and especially not when he was on a case, and definitely not two nights in a row. Something was wrong.
But after they had talked and were solving their first crime together, he had felt the same attraction to the man's mind. That first night, standing in the hallway of 221b, out of breath from running for the police, giggling together, he had looked at the man next to him and knew he was madly falling in love with this marvelous creature.
"Yes. But they are carefully locked away now."
You broke my heart with that fall. I was lost again and after a few weeks without you, the gun came back. I put it against my head again. But there were to many people caring now. Mrs. Hudson, Greg, Molly. They all lost you already, so who was I to make them go through another loss again? But I faded. I faded away without you. And it wasn't just me. We all did. Mrs Hudson became quieter, Molly pulled herself back even more, and Greg pounced himself on his work. You're important. To all of us. We need you, Sherlock. You can't just die on us. You can't just die on me. And if you're stubborn and do it anyway, then I'm coming with you. I'm not doing this without you again. I can't. I won't. So don't die on me. Do you hear me, Sherlock? Don't you dare and die on me."
"I thought you didn't have contact in my absence."
"You'll be amazed." John replied. Sherlock rolled his eyes at them both, and started typing on his phone. John and Ava grinned stupidly at each other.
While John was the one that sort of poured his heart out, told Sherlock his deepest secrets, he still felt the need to comfort Sherlock. It should have been the other way around, shouldn't it?
John laughed along with the man. He didn't really know David. They had chatted a bit before, he did have a little row with him when he felt jealous about Sherlock, he had borrowed the mans sweatshirt, seen him getting aroused but the man spend the breaks outside to smoke, so he was mostly targeted by Sherlock.
Sherlock said with a grin on his face, sitting staight up in the bed.
Ava smiled back at him, getting the cap of the needle.
"Be careful around that guy." John said his voice dropping an octave. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him.
He was extraordinary.
I lost everything in one week. My parents, my sister, my surrogate family in Afghanistan, my army job, my future as a surgeon. Everything. When they send me back to England three weeks later, they gave me my possessions that they had found in what was left of the camp. All the letters from my parents had been destroyed, as were all my photo's, clothes, and almost everything else. Except for my sketchbook. It looked as if it hadn't been in a war zone, and I almost left it there. What was the point? It was filled with emotions, pain. Eventually I did took it home with me, don't even know why. But I did. I never picked up a pencil after that."
"We have a new case. Starting next week. I need you to come with me on every Tuesday and Thursday evening."
A few hours later, Sherlock woke up again.
"Oi! Get those medics here! Now!"
"Why aren't you answering your phone?" John asked while closing the door behind him. He put his nose in the air an sniffed.
"Twelve days." He repeated.
"Ava settled herself in her chair with the plate Thai on her lap and poured herself a glass of wine. She took a sip.
Sherlock smirked.
Ava laughed.
He hit the man hard in the middle of his face, and while David went down, John ran towards the door, pushing himself through the crowded space, reaching for his jacket on the coat rack next to the door without slowing down. Next to his jacket he saw the Belstaff.
Sherlock grumbled something unrecognisable.
"I really need to disagree with you about that, John. I can assure you that I was completely aware of my actions at that time."
Sherlock felt confused. How could John have noticed that? What about John? How could he fall for someone when the other was right next to him?
O great, He died. He died and went to heaven. It was strange, really. He never thought there was an afterlife. He was sure about that. Now that he thought of it, he was rather pleased about it existing after all. It was another puzzle to solve. Another mystery that came into his life to keep him occupied. Well, not really his life, obviously. What was it then? Afterlife? Second life?
"To be honest. No, John. I don't understand. But... I want to. Can you explain it to me?"
"That was four months and six days after we've met. And it was the fourth time since we've met. It was a superb seven percent solution. But I didn't really enjoy it. Couldn't stop feeling guilty about it. Anahita opened my eyes that day."
I was sitting on the edge of my bed again, as I had done every morning and evening for the last eleven months. The gun was lying in my hand. The weight familiar, the metal cold against my skin.
John replied, earning a small smile.
"So? David was hitting on you. You don't hear me moaning about it."
"But John..."
John chuckled.
He wished this would end, but he didn't want to die. Not yet. He needed to say to John that he was sorry.
John gave him a sketchbook in hands.
Sherlock was tilted onto the stretcher, and both John and Greg followed the medics out, heading towards the hospital.
"So, John. Are you seeing anyone?"
"Fuck you, Sherlock. It sounds dangerous." John said.
Sherlock refused to think about him. It was just too painful. And it was the only thing that kept him going. And he didn't want that. He wanted to stop existing. Another spasm made him moan, black spots were clouding his vision again, pushing away the small sparkles of light that played behind his eyelids. He let the unconsciousness wash over him, embracing it this time, instead of fighting it. Maybe he was lucky this time and he wouldn't wake up again.
That made Sherlock laugh again.
John sighed. Maybe he was right.
In my mind I sometimes had you. I imagined that there wasn't anything we didn't know about each other. I imagined us sharing a kiss, cuddling on the sofa and even sharing our bed. I imagined stroking your body, making you shiver and beg. I imagined you doing the same to me. Holding me, cherishing me, kiss me all over and touch me where ever you could reach me.
"You are a special woman, Ava Jones."
"So. It's just you and me, then. Come, pass me some Ginger nuts, Pretty, so we can enjoy them together."
"Sorry?"
He hang the phone and called Greg.
I thought I'd seen you once or twice while taking apart this network. One time I even approached the man who I thought was you. I thought you managed to figure out my deceiving and followed me. But when I touched his arm and he turned around he didn't even look like you. One part of me was glad that he wasn't you, the other part was very disappointed. I feel I have left a big part of myself behind in London. No, not just London, I left it with you. You are the part that I miss in myself, the part I needed to return too, so I could be whole again.
"A bloody stressed one."
"Well, what do you think?"
He loved to draw, he really did, but he loved the sight and feeling of a squirming and begging and cursing detective underneath him even more.
Not good.
Sherlock smiled widely now, and John felt his heart stutter. Finally they could go home together. Before he even realised it, he was holding Sherlock in his arms, overwhelming him with kisses, which were eagerly returned.
He looked John in his eyes and gave him a tiny smile. Then Sherlock cupped his large hands carefully around John's face and got his face close to his, his eyes never leaving John's. After a heartbeat he let his lips touch the mouth of the shorter man. Very softly, very cautious, closing his eyes and tried to not let the feelings overwhelm him. And when he pulled back to look John in his eyes, he didn't see any hesitation, only determination.
She was short, even shorter than John, Dark blonde hair, hazel eyes, freckles, white lab coat.
"Why do you need my brother? What do you know that I don't?"
He took the glass of whiskey and poured the liquid down his throat, when John turned his head towards him. His eyes were soft and sweet, and Sherlock almost reached out to him. But the stakes were too high. He wasn't sure how John would react to it. Would he pull back, or would he welcome Sherlock? Would he reach out to him too? Longing for a touch? Was it something John would want too? Instead of following this urge, he picked up the bottle again and poured their glasses once more.
"Did you?" John said after a few seconds of silence.
"Burned your tongue?"
"That's what happens when you nick my jumpers."
"You want me to call him and tell him that everything is under control? He'll know something is up when I call him. And things are definitely not under control, Ava." Sherlock said angrily.
I hope you will all enjoy this one.
John could just hear the confusion in Sherlock's voice, and despite the big slip he just made, he had to laugh at it.
Ava sight. The scratch on her cheek wasn't healing. There was a dark spot forming around it, and it itched. She put her hand down, realising that she was scratching it.
'Call me as soon as you see this. We need to talk. JW'
Carla tripped. The tray with coffee and tea fell from her hands, and before he knew it, John was covered in hot liquids.
"I won't."
Sherlock bite off his words and without looking back, he walked out. John sighed.
"I was so lost without you. I wanted to kill myself, every morning I picked up my gun, put it against my head and asked myself if this was the day I would end it all. It was tempting, sometimes. But then came the day I met you. The most extraordinary, arrogant, childish and brilliant man I've even seen in my life. I loved you instantly, you know. Well, maybe not the first time at Bart's, I was a bit overwhelmed by you then, but definitely the day after.
"I put something in the hatch for you."
Sherlock put on his socks and shoes and tried to act normal when he entered the classroom. John was just putting his last gear away.
John was glad that Sherlock could not see his flushed face at the moment.
After a few minutes Sherlock turned the page.
Sherlock felt a sudden urge to see John bent over a piece of paper, pencil in hand, his face focused, the tip of his tongue peeking out, wetting his lips as he did when he was intensely focused on his work. He wanted to see how the doctor looked using the right side of his brain, the creative side, instead of the left.
Feeling very uncomfortable, John told him he was going to go inside, to grab himself a cup of coffee now he still could, before the class was starting.
He shook up when someone opened the door to the bathroom. It was David. For a second he felt the pinch of jealousy come up again, until he saw the man's face. There was no smug expression whatsoever on his face, and he even seemed to be a bit worried.
They had to stop this investigation. It was too much. Sherlock felt as if his heart would explode out of his chest, and there was a huge headache coming up behind his eyes. He had trouble keeping the act and real life apart. That had never happened to him before.
John smirked back at him.
"Sherlock."
"We're already running late. And you're the main attraction tonight."
"I think that's because you love him."
"And I play the violin, so I'm really clever with my fingers."
"So only Beth and Clive remain."
"Have you seen person one?"
"Yeah, she told me."
"I'll do my best."
"He's with him."
"Yeah. He might say that he likes me, but what about you? Think about that, John."
He took a sharp breath. That injury would hurt like hell. Maybe even more than the knee.
Tears were falling from her eyes now, and Sherlock swallowed.
But that big heart never stopped caring.
"Sherlock?" John asked, his voice worried an a bit uncertain.
"You're late."
John hurries himself downstairs again, and started jogging to the next drug den, a few blocks away.
"No. Well, I don't intent to get naked, if that's what you mean. I already spoke to the teacher. She told me that is was a study of face and torso, so I guess I can keep my trousers on."
"Of course not. You're an idiot." Sherlock sniffed into John's neck.
John took the stairs to 221b twice at the time and opened the door of their apartment. It was dark inside.
"No, let me finish, this is important. I want you to understand what you mean to me, Sherlock. After your fall, it just wasn't worth it anymore. I tried, Sherlock. I tried for Mrs Hudson, for Molly, for Greg. But not for myself. I just couldn't handle it. It was as if I was back to before I met you, when I had come back from Afghanistan. My life was empty, the world grey. Every morning and evening I would take my gun out and weight it in my hands again, wondering if I was going to do it today.
"Ghnnn..."
"I'm an idiot." He said under his breath, trying to breath properly again.
"I wish we had met some other time."
John.
John sighed and rubbed his hand over his upper leg, as he did when he got uncomfortable.
"I volunteered as a model. I'm starting next week."
Sherlock had lay awake all night, and so slept most of the day. Even after five days of hospitalisation, he still felt weaker than he wanted. He just wanted to go home and let everything go back to normal. It was dark out, and John had been there all day, again, reading some stupid book. He would probably go home soon, getting some sleep himself.
Esmeralda blinked her eyes a few times and smiled softly at John again.
"You know what? I'm going to get our stuff to the hostel. I'll be back within a few hours. Sherlock?" He said while looking at his roommate. Sherlock didn't look up from his phone screen.
"Exactly. You see my point?"
"Come with me." She said.
"Rather not? Rather not what, John? Please be explicit."
"Don't be an idiot, John. Of course you can't act like a teenager. No. These are evening classes, for adults. I need you to act as a course member, take two classes a week for a certain period of time, learning how to paint or draw or something and keep your eyes open for me."
“Not specifically. It seems that this order of events geld for all infected individuals. They want me to take a look at the medicine, and see if i can manage to help make an antidote.”
"We? You're a doctor."
"Yes it is. You've got something to lose with John. You're afraid he'll break your heart. You're afraid he leaves you. He's your best friend. You like him. You like him even more than you like me."
"Wher's Mellon?"
"You were running a fever and did nearly die, Sherlock. Your mind was playing tricks on you."
Sherlock turned around towards the familiar sounding voice, and before Sherlock could react, Marc Jenkins stabbed something in his neck and the whole world went dark.
Sherlock's eyes locked on John's, but his body started to tremble uncontrollably. A heartbreaking whine left the detective's throat before he passed out. The trembling became less and stopped within a few seconds. John was still sitting on his knees next to him, still crying, but now the man had blacked out, he could finally examine him properly. He touched and felt, careful not to hurt him or make the trauma worse, stopping from time to time to wipe some tears away.  He took his coat off of him and carefully unbind his wrists and ankles. The fever had to come down, and the bruising's needed cooling-off.
David asked him, and started to grin when he realised how much that sounded like a bad opening sentence.
And...One time, I did. I killed myself. It was our anniversary. The day we had met, three years before. I went to Angelo's, sat at our table. Ordered your favourite and an expensive bottle of wine. I felt I needed to say goodbye to you, somehow. I went home to my apartment, drank whiskey, I put the gun against my head, and I pulled the trigger.
"Stupid, isn't it? I still have the feeling that I need to do something for them, feed them or give them some sort of comfort. But I know I wouldn't matter."
John swallowed.
"When was the last time you used drugs?"
"Ehm, Sherlock? You wouldn't have a spare on you? Do you?"
"Of course I did, John. I just chose not to react on it. Now. I have made a plan for tomorrow."
"Why?"
Sherlock shrugged.
"You really were something special, Ava."
"Hi John."
"That is correct. But then again, I had my reasons for looking over my shoulder."
Sherlock took a step back, letting go of John, who was looking bewildered at him. Hastily he took another step back, panic clouding his mind.
"Yes. Almost as much as you do. He's different. He's bloody smart, funny and pretty. What's not to like?"
"Before then? No. I haven't. I did have one shag that kept coming back for more, does that count?"
"Patience, Sherlock."
He saw the detective close his eyes, and John's gaze went over his body again. He couldn't touch him. Not without anesthetics. Doctor Watson mode finally kicked in and John started to catalogue the injuries.
This whole drawing course had awoken the butterflies in his stomach again. They had been quiet for months now. Not that they had ever been truly gone, just quiet. They did die though, two years ago. They died together with the man he loved more than anyone in the world. His world had gone grey and the butterflies died, leaving an hollow, empty space inside. And not just the butterflies died. His heart had stopped beating, stopped existing, his heart had died too. But Sherlock came back. He came back after he had made sure that the threat towards John was destroyed.
"Chair."
"No need to panic, Sherlock. You're human, after all. Just... be careful with your heart, okay?"
"Yes."
"Don't worry. Havn't seen 'em high in years. But he ain't here. You should go and talk to Nita. She knows 'im best."
Neither of them said a word. Sherlock saw the emotions in John's eyes. He felt his heart speeding.
"Goodnight, Sherlock."
"Correct."
"Let 'em go, Bern. The man ain't no cop, look at 'im. Who yer looking for, sweetheart?"
John felt at Sherlock's forehead again. Still burning. Where was the ambulance? How long ago had he called Mycroft? He checked his phone. Ten minutes. They could be here any minute. They probably had to wait until the Yard or Mycroft's agents had cleared the house. John's fingers stroked Sherlock's hair again. God, he loved this man.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. Looking at the smoking doctor next to him.
John held the soaking jumper from his chest, careful not to burn himself, and hurried out to the bathroom down the hall.
"Ow bugger. I mean, never saw you here before."
John laughed.
Sherlock stood up and his mouth fell open.
"MI5?"
"You might be right. I do wish you all the luck, of course. I am going to check on my brother now, if you don't mind. Good day, Doctor Watson."
John just couldn't put his finger on it, but the easy flow that had been part of their relationship for the past few weeks had shifted somehow. It was like it had been before, when Sherlock had just returned from the dead. He had shut himself off again. He kept his distance, seemed uninterested in the things John (or anybody) said, his mind quicker than ever and his tongue even sharper. John had told him about the incident with the coffee, to explain himself why he was wearing David's sweater Tuesday night. (He did leave out the part of the man watching his torso and seeing the man getting aroused.)
John could almost hear the eye roll Sherlock was giving him.
On his way, he got past the place where the CCTV had lost track of Sherlock, and the place where he was taken. John slowed his pace, and searched the ground, not entirely certain what he was looking for, until he saw something shimmer behind a trashcan. John bent down and saw an used syringe. Damned!
"We owe her so much." John said after a while.
The sound of my breathing seemed far away, as was the throbbing of my heartbeat.
"Is it? Well, glad to be your first there." She said smiling, and Sherlock smiled back.
"I've never seen you like this. All talking and laughing while on a case. And you even bought her her favourite wine. Sherlock, are you falling for her?"
Sherlock grinned back at her.
"Dinner." John said, putting the Thai down onto Sherlock's desk.
She walked towards a stereo next to the teacher’s desk and put on some classical background music, and the student around him started putting their pencils and brushes onto their paper and canvases. John looked at his fellow students. Some of them looked like they knew what they were doing, others just seemed a bit lost, but started anyway. Esmeralda walked towards John and bent herself over his shoulder.
"This makes you quiet doesn't it? She has a husband and three children outside the facility. We told them that she had died. They buried an empty casket. It's sad. She was a great neuroscientist, I learned a lot from her in the past, and I was looking forward to work with her here. But we only got a full week before she got bitten."
Sherlock was shocked for a second. Had he been thinking out loud?
"You're incorrigible."
"Look. I'm... I'm sorry, David, but..."
"Hello." The cracking voice replied.
"You did? Why?"
Maybe you start a family with her, becoming a father, a husband. I would hate that, to be honest. But then again, if it makes you happy, I'm happy too.
"Busy?"
He saw John nod his head once, not turning his face towards him. The tremble in his hand had disappeared, and the glass was empty once more in his hand. He looked sad. And Sherlock recognized the sign that this was the moment to step back, leaving him alone with his thoughts. He put the sketchbook down at the table next to his chair, stroking it with his long fingers, before he got up and retreated himself towards his bedroom, giving John space. Just before he closed the bedroom door behind him he looked over his shoulder once more, and saw tears running down his best friend's face.
This house was not as crowded as the previous one, but there were still a lot of people inside. People were laying on the ground, high as a kite, but when John saw a woman that was still capable of talking he approached her. She was about Sherlock's age, and was wearing a big, filthy coat (although not as filthy as the others he saw around here), her hair was cut short and looked brown.
"Well, you could come when he was busy."
"About eight years ago, I was living in some crack house at the other end of London. I was using at that time, and I went onto the streets to sell my body for cash. Not something I am proud off, but it happened. It was my life back then. One night, I was walking the streets and a car stopped, asking what it would cost and I was about to step inside to go to some abandoned alley with that man, when a strange young man appeared behind me.
The monkey screamed when Ava entered the needle in its arm. The sedative made the monkey go quit, and within a few minutes it appeared dead.
"You're an extraordinary man, John. Full of surprises. I've been watching you, you know. You're a skilled artist, so focused at your work. But there is something about you. You're more than you want to show to the outside world. You have a certain look in your eyes, dangerous. You look bloody hot with that body of yours, hiding away in those jumpers all the time. No, you caught my eye at first sight, and I could barely contain myself in the bathroom last Tuesday. But seeing you like this, dressed to kill, I know for sure that I want you, all of you, every inch of you." David leaned in closer and lifted John's hand from the bar, bringing to to his mouth. David dropped his voice even lower.
"Ow, cheeky! I like that. I'll be here."
"Sherlock, this is serious." Mycroft stated.
"She was."
So no other specialists. Except for Sherlock Holmes.
"No. I'm serious, Sherlock. I don't want any of us harmed. So we'll go, have a look, stay behind barriers, solve the thing and go back to London. You understand?"
Esmeralda gave him a big smile, and patted his shoulder again.
"Well, I see you got your mouth back already."
“Since when are you in there?” John asked her, putting the chairs across of her at their side of the glass.
Jeans.
John stood up from his seat.
"It does, doesn't it? He also had a collapsed lung, severe bruised tailbone, dislocated shoulder, sprained ankle, bruised ribs, severe concussion. They were afraid that it was an severe traumatic brain injury. But scans showed that it's a severe concussion. His whole body is covered in bruising's. But he's going to make it."
Cocaine. Letting the drugs enter his vain, making its way down his whole body, hitting his brain and increase the dopamine release, giving him an elevated mood. No.That would upset John, a lot. He didn't want to upset John, ever. But he had made the man cry Thursday night. He had giving John pain. Pain he couldn't take away. Pain he should not had brought up again in the first place, just because he was curious about the drawings. No. He would try to do everything to keep John happy and around. He was truly lost without his blogger.  Sherlock reached for his violin and started to tune the snares with his fingers. When they sounded the way he wanted, he took his bow and started playing. His eyes closed and his face lit by the lamppost outside.
"What is it?"
"Properly. I think I like it this way."
“Yes, but I'm special. And besides, why take the risk? One in here is enough, we can talk through the intercom, seemed to work for the last five minutes.” She turned around and pulled a chair towards the window.
John nodded approvingly, although he already knew what his preference were, and when Esmeralda put the paper upside down he knew she understood the privacy the artwork held for him.
"Of course, John."
"Already?"
"Do they know?" Sherlock asked, looking up.
"You don't look so well."
"Can we do anything?"
The corner of John's mouth twitched up in a small smile, thinking back at that moment. The shy butterflies in his stomach came back, carefully exploring if it was safe to show themselves again.
"Thank god you listened for once."
The pub was crowded already. The men went towards the bar and John ordered them both a pint, much to Sherlock's aversion. They went to stand at the left end of the bar getting a good view at the whole pub. Sherlock was scanning the room, while John looked at the people going in and out. They talked a bit about nothing in particular, but half an hour and two pints later, Sherlock decided to go out for a smoke.
"Sorry?" John asked confused.
John's didn't.
John's smile got wider and he shook his head. At least three of butterflies in his stomach went completely bonkers.
"You two are going tot have a great time together."
Great.
The man came forward to Sherlock and caressed his back with his fingers. Sherlock tried to pull himself away from the feeling and kick the man with his feet, his whole body weight hanging on the rope.
While John was looking at his phone and waited for Sherlock to come back, a familiar voice called his name.
"Yes you bloody did. God. You have no idea how many times I had to control myself not to snog you senseless, to just go for it and see where it would take us. But you stated you were not interested in such a thing. And I really didn't want to lose what we had."
The people were talking about their work, and they continued to do so, involving Sherlock in their conversation. Asking him questions about lighting and sorts of poses, which he answered with as much certainty as he could bring up. After five minutes he was really freezing, so he excused himself to get back inside and to take that coffee John promised him to warm himself up.
"Me? No, like you said, I'm a doctor, not of much use for you here."
"Don't interrupt, Mycroft. I'm trying to persuade John to see the logic in this. If his slow little brain can keep up, that is. "
“I don't see the problem, you're in there, aren't you?”
John looked at him with empathy.
When Sherlock noticed his stare he looked back at him.
Great.
"If you log in on computer two seventeen, you'll get a live view of the microscope."
"We sort off got into a fight together. And he left. I'm afraid he's off to score something."
"Do you want to? Keep that distance?" Sherlock asked him, giving him his full attention.
When the cab stopped in front of 221b, Sherlock had stepped out of the cab, letting John handle the payment, and he had let himself inside. He took the stairs two at a time, and when he entered the apartment he went straight into his bedroom, slamming the door so hard that John would hear it and wasn't going to follow him. He had shrugged of the stupid jacket and had thrown himself onto his bed. He cried silently. Tears running down his face, his eyes swollen and his cheeks burning. He felt as if he was a small boy again. Just like in bygone days, before he was capable to control his transport and emotions. Just like before he had created his shield and to learned to detach himself from his feelings. He had managed to take a distance from the pain. It just wasn't worth it, feeling alone and misunderstood by everybody around him. Hiding away in his room and crying his eyes out, because the other kids thought he was a freak and even the adults including his parents had their opinion ready for him. They all thought he was strange, broken, needed to be fixed. So he made his shield, cutting him off from all the idiots roaming this world, making it capable to live his life, making sure he would never feel the pain or anything else anymore. Alone was what he had, what had protected him. I had worked for years.
That evening, Sherlock's phone rang. John looked up from his novel (he was staring at the same page for over six minutes now) when Sherlock took the call.
Esmeralda asked, breaking the spell. Sherlock looked at her, a bit confused.
John felt panic coming up and started rattling.
He let his mind go back to think about the pencil in his hand, the way it felt so familiar. And when he opened his eyes again he could see it. The man in front of him was no longer his way too attractive roommate, but he was like a statue, existing out of light and dark. John looked at it and put his pencil down onto his paper.
John rushed towards the glass and looked at the spot on her cheek. Sherlock swallowed. He stood up and grabbed his phone.
John inhaled again.
Sherlock smiled and kissed the top of John's head. John lifted his head from Sherlock's shoulder. I'm going to see my parents grave. Do I see you there?"
"I should have done that sooner."
"Hmmm... What kind of equipment do you have there?"
"Of course not. Don't be stupid, John. This is a laboratory. What do you think of me?"
"Correct again, gorgeous. It will be pleasant to sleep a night without her screaming in the back."
After a few minutes he felt like he could talk again.
Ava pressed the needle against the skin, and it went through easily. She emptied the syringe and pulled the needle carefully back out.
John swiped a hand over his face and huffed out an unintelligible laugh. "Fucking hell. Think off all the time we wasted."
"Come back soon?"
"I thought you were dead when I found you. I thought I was to late."
"Yes, you're right. Let's prevent that from happening. I'll be right back."
And with that words he turned around, seeing the flames licking at the back of the lab. Time to evacuate the facility.
"That sounds boring."
"O Jesus, no."
"Yes."
He walked towards him and swung his arm around him. Within seconds Sherlock was slumped against him, crying freely. Clenching his hands on John's back.
"Just hurry up, Mycroft. Call me as soon as you know something."
"Mycroft, I found him."
"Did you take the serum?"
"Not tonight we didn't. Yestr'day. Nothin' special. Try Mellon. She's bin shadowin' 'im today."
"Darn. All the good ones are taken. She must be a lucky lady."
"Have you ever been in a relationship?"
"Why?"
"We have to wait for at least two hours before we can go further. Stay. Smoke with me, and tell me about yourself and the psychopath that thought you were an angel."
He sighed as he sat down in his own chair, making a soft noise of comfort, his bare feet facing the fire on his left. Sherlock watched him for a moment before focusing back on the papers in his lap. He had everything he could find about the three suspects printed out, and he was scanning the documents now. As he worked his way systematically through all the files, he deduced that Liam Murphy was probably off the hook. The man had been abroad working for the government at the time two of the victims disappeared.
"I intent to."
"What do you mean by that, John?"
"Is this because I said no to your offer yesterday?"
Sherlock said. He sat in the desk, the left side of his head leaning against the glass.
"My life without you."
This became too complicated. Why was the angel calling his brother? Minor government position my arse. God, Was Mycroft like Saint Peter or something? It was unimaginable. He definitely needed some rest, sleep. But he wanted to see the angel again.
Nita stretched out her hand to pull John on his feet.
"John. Don't do anything stupid. You stay with him, alright?"
"Night."
"Well, if this has something to do with a glow in the dark rabbit, you're to late. Already solved that one."
Sherlock did as she said, and looked into the tables and statistics in the document.
"Everything. I want to know what kind of sounds you make. What makes you whimper, moan and beg for more."
"Right. I'm off. See you in a bit. Goodbye, miss Jones."
"I'm going to get some coffee. Do you want some, too?"
They worked all day together again. Whenever they took a break, they talked and laughed, smoked and ate. John came in around dinner time, and he had brought some take away Chinese with him. Ava was almost jumping from excitement. And when she pulled open the bottle of wine, Sherlock did the same with the bottle he had brought for himself and John.
"Show me."
Sherlock sighed and sat up a little.
With a dramatic sight he took up his chopsticks and started to stir in his food, putting some of it in his mouth. He saw the smug grin on John's face and stopped himself just in time to give him one back. After a few bites Sherlock decided he had enough, and he stood up from the table.
"Yes, John. It's a jumper. One of yours, actually. Shut up." He said, his words sharp.
"That happens all the time, nothing to make fuzz about."
"That your a stubborn bastard that doesn't follow rules?"
"Sherlock. You'll be sitting half naked in a freezing room for at least four hours tonight, while there are fourteen people staring at you. You don't want to sit there with a growling stomach. Now, eat."
"Two days, three tops, I think."
"The angel dream?"
"I really like you, little devil."
"He took off without his coat, keys or phone."
"Come here. I wouldn't never do something like that again."
"I do suggest you bring a map with you next time, so you can take it home with you. And if you think you are ready, maybe you can look for a set of pencils of your own? It never hurts to work at home, getting familiar with the different densities of the pencils and to find out which sort of paper you prefer? Until that time you are free to use ours, of course."
"That's just stupid. Why would I do that? Do I look like a housekeeper to you?"
"Who's this, Nita, new man?"
"Sherlock Holmes, have you been smoking?!"
Sherlock looked at John. It had been two days since he woke up in the hospital, and his eyes were capable to stay open now.
Observant as he was, Sherlock saw a slight tension coming up in the man's shoulders when he mentioned painting or drawing.
"I'll make a raster first." He answered her, his voice barely more than a whisper. He didn't argue about the boyfriend bit, as he had no idea what Sherlock had said to her when they were in the other room together. She squeezed his shoulder and winked at him, leaving him to his work. John bent himself over his paper, and started to make a light raster. It had been so long that he had drawn anything, he thought it was smart to start this way. He felt his head getting empty, the tension leave his shoulders and back, and he was so getting into making the raster that he forgot that there were others around him.
"No thank you, Sherlock Holmes. Thank you for giving me these last two weeks. They were amazing."
"Don't be daft, gorgeous. How do you think they feed me? There is a small hatch at your left. When you open it, you can put something inside. After you closed it, I can open it on my side. The air will be cleaned and filtered before you can open it again. But it's a one way thing. I can't send anything out."
Sherlock's torso was bare. The slender man walked towards the chair that was standing in the middle of the classroom and sat down on it. Esmeralda went towards him and gave him a pose. She made him stretch his back and made him put one arm to rest across the backrest and the left arm resting on his lap. John saw that his muscles were tight, bringing out the abs of his chest and abdomen. There were goose bumps all over his skin because of the cold, and when John's gaze settled on the man's hard nipples, he swallowed heavily and noticed that his mouth was hanging open. He snapped his mouth shut, feeling his cheeks getting red.
"And despite my earlier statement, I would like to show them to you. I owe you that much. Wait here."
John was silent, not sure how to reply to that.
"That's the tissue sample from last night. It must be finished. I'm going to check."
"Just wait till we get home. I'll show you what my voice can do to you."
Sherlock stared at her.
He pulled that one with him too and slammed the door open. Suddenly he was standing still on the pavement in front of the pub. Where had he gone?
"Well, I have been told on more than one occasion that I have a perfect mouth."
"Thank you, Mycroft. Call me if you find anything else."
"Hasn't been 'ere for ages. Thought he was dead."
"Hmmm... Like it when you get mouthy."
"It's a new model. I ordered it in a special colour, metallic mouse grey. It comes in handy with those sliding doors for my mother. She's in a wheelchair. This way I can take her out of town from time to time."
"Then you know in how much pain he's in. And how close he was."
When Sherlock looked up at the woman at the other end of the glass he saw she was staring at him. A little frown on her forehead. Was she deducing him?
Ava looked up at him.
Sherlock seemed to panic, moving his head and trying to get up.
Frowning, Sherlock turned around and looked at John.
John smirked.
"What's that sound in the back?" Sherlock asked. Ava's voice lost a bit of the natural lightheartedness Sherlock was getting accused to.
It was fun writing this piece and it was even more fun sharing it with you all!
"Yeah, was bleed'ng 'lot. Bar fight. At that place at Mart'ns lane."
"Not sure... Did you like him?"
"That's no relationship."
"How are your painkillers?"
"Sherlock never told you? He really is an idiot..."
"Thank god. He is alive?" The man at the other and said, relief in his voice.
"But I am, and knowing that you'll be sitting here doing god knows what is distracting. So you need to go with John. Go and enjoy the rest of your evening. Drink one on me, okay?"
O no.... I'm so, so sorry for this one!
The smile disappeared from David’s face.
"It's only a sketch yet. I'll promise I'll show it to you when it's finished, okay?"
When John came back downstairs, Sherlock looked up at him. John was wearing jeans that left nothing to the imagination. It clenched around his arse like a second skin and made his thighs look even more hard and trained. When Sherlock saw the shirt John was wearing he couldn't help but smirk at him. The smooth fabric of Sherlock's dark blue shirt was tight around John's chest. As a doctor and former military man he kept himself fit. He ran at least three times a week and he got to the gym near his doctor’s office regularly. Sherlock knew this, obviously, but he had no idea of how fit his roommate actually was. Normally John wore his horrible, dull, comfortable jumpers, and when he had a special occasion, he would wear a loose shirt or vest. But he definitely never wore something like this. He wasn't the man to show off. John was muscular, trained. John's chest was brawny and wider than his own, as were John's upper arms. He had the sleeves of the shirt rolled up to just above his elbows, and the shirt was tugged into his jeans.
"He would like to know."
John woke up. He blinked his eyes and stretched his body, making a satisfying sound while at it. What time was it? He looked at the clock at his side. Ten to eleven. Damn. He slept for ages. Time to get up and make something of today. He dressed himself in a dressing gown, grabbed a towel from his wardrobe and went downstairs to take a shower. The living room was empty. Was Sherlock still asleep then? Seemed impossible. John shrugged and went inside the bathroom, taking his time to shower and shave. When he emerged the shower thirty five minutes later, there was still no sign of life in the apartment. John went into the kitchen, flicked the switch of the kettle, and went upstairs to get himself properly dressed. When he came downstairs again, he poured himself a strong cup of tea and started to make breakfast. Sitting down at the kitchen table he looked at his phone.
And more feelings!
John walked out and closed the door behind him.
Sherlock just shrugged. Ava sight again and reached for the cigarettes.
"Sweet? I'm not sweet."
On the same day I was told that I had to go home. They gave me a honourable discharge. And I was told that I probably could never operate again because the bullet that went through my shoulder had caused nerve damage and it gave me a tremble in my hand.
"My brother?"
"I am serious! John, tell him."
Sherlock stood up grabbed his coat and walked back to the glass. He put his hand against it.
"No need."
"Did you find him?"
"Mind over matter, John. It's a mind set. You?"
"GENTLEMEN!" The voice out the phone yelled into the room.
Something had changed.
Sherlock blinked and stayed quiet, looking at her. She looked back. She didn't even flinch. Interesting.
"I tried to deny it to myself. I wasn't gay. I never fell in love with a man before. I'm not attracted to male body's. I still don't. But you're my exception. God, that long limbs and graceful movements. And your hands, the're gorgeous. And your lips and your eyes and that ridiculous mop of breathtaking curls... You had me questioning my sexuality within forty eight hours, and you got me wanking on you within two weeks. If you would have told me that a year before, I would have laughed about it. I was Three bloody Continents Watson. I shared my bed with more woman than I can count, and I enjoyed all of it. I loved it.
John was looking at the people coming and going at the hospital. It was half past three now, a time people came by to visit their loved ones that were hospitalised. But Mycroft could see that the man didn't notice any of them.
"John?"
"Neither are you."
"O god. You don't have an antidote yet."
"Yes. You've been a great help. Thank you."
"My body is used to higher dosage." Sherlock replied hoarsely, opening his eyes and blinking against the black spots trying to take over his vision.
The familiar pale skin had turned all shades of pain. Black, blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple. There was almost no normal pale skin visible anymore. His normally so gracious hands and fingers were bruised and bloated, his sharp angled face almost unrecognizably swollen and discoloured.
"Govent Garden. He is going to a pub at Martin's Lane."
"No I haven't. Not since you two started the case with the missing models. How's that going, by the way?"
Send.
"Please, please stop. No more. Please." It was nothing more than a whisper, almost inaudible, until Marc interrupted him.
Sherlock didn't even try to hold back his tears. Instead, he turned towards the screen in front of him, his vision a bit blurry. He did as she asked. He pressed the combination she had told him to ignite the fire.
"So?"
"Is that your way of saying that you couldn't stand on your legs anymore because of exhaustion?"
"Thank you."
"Hmmm... makes sense. Mycroft, listen. I never thanked you."
"And what about your knee?"
"Right. You know what I mean, you git. You're body isn't up for it yet."
"Of course he did."
When Sherlock ended the call he leaned himself against the wall behind him, trying to steadying his heart beat and breathing to a normal rhythm again. It was a good thing John didn't see him like this. All flushed and wobbly, only because the man said that he thought he could be sweet, adorable even. The only one who had ever said something like that to him was his mother. And that didn't count. Every mother thinks their offspring is adorable.
They hadn't had any success creating something that kept stable. Every cure, medicine or serum they developed worked for a few hours and then only seemed to speed up the process. It was like fighting a losing battle, and they both knew it.
"You know, I do." John said.
"I know. But you like him too, right?"
"I did?"
"Yes. Did John tell you that?"
So much for rebuilding his shield, then. He could see the look on John's face and he just was unable to keep his air of annoyance and disinterest, as if he was bigger than the emotions inside of his transport. He had tried, for at least one and a half day. But it was so hard. How could he distance himself from his feelings when every time he saw John his heart pounded harder against his ribs? And how could John surprise him with this? It was another piece of the puzzle that was John Watson, And he just couldn't help himself.
John stood up and bent over Sherlock, giving him a kiss in his hair.
"Good morning, Ava. Had a good night sleep?"
John reached inside the back pocket of his jeans and got his phone out. He started dialing. Within a second it was answered.
"I'll miss you." He said, tears rolling down his own cheeks too.
I hope I managed to give you peace, the opportunity to built yourself a life without me. I like to think about the life you are making for yourself right now, but I have to say that I am also scared for it. I always thought that I would come back to London, to you, and it frightens me to think that you don't need me anymore in your new and carefully build life. That whatever you have found for yourself is enough, that there is no place anymore in it for me. It would break me. But it seems like I am not coming back after all, so I worried myself about that for nothing.
"Good luck with that."
And Sherlock was out again. John's heart bashed against his ribs.
John's cheeks turned red.
"You really do have a big heart. Sherlock told me. He talks about you all the time. You know that?"
"Fuck... How did you manage to not explode? More then ten years..."
"Not much. They saw person one getting out of the pub at St. Martin's lane tonight with a broken nose. Got hit by someone. Small bloke, blond. That's all I know."
"Jesus. And I thought you weren't even listening."
She sighed.
So, at least four hours, maybe even five. Or had it been longer? Did he pass out three times? Four? Five? His time scheme was messed up. The fever was messing with his mind. He couldn't think properly. He felt another muscle spasm on his chest and tried to ignore the pain. His breathing was shallow.
"Do you have any idea what my first thought was when I met you? I thought that you were amazing, gorgeous, fucking hot and exceptional. I thought that you were the most amazing human being that must exist on this world. And I still believe that. All of that. Damn Sherlock, you had me head over heels within twenty four hours."
"This is now the second drawing you're making here. And I think it's very loaded. You can almost feel the emotions coming off from the paper. Is that something you can do with other people too? Or is it just because it's him?"
Sherlock didn't close the door behind him, so he could overhear their conversation.
"Obviously."
Sherlock said, with a bit of proud in his voice. Esmeralda raised her eyebrows and smirked at him.
"I haven't got much to say."
"John!" He yelled.
John squeezed his eyes again and gave himself a mental kick in the arse.
Ava pulled her hand away from the glass and jumped off the desk.
John rolled his eyes.
"Fuck." She said, looking at her hand. It was red with blood.
He could see John was almost finished with it. The hard lines he had seen two days ago were gone. They were faded down to become shadows. He could see the muscles stretched underneath the skin, the few moles that covered his body were at the exact right spots, and his hair was damp, just as it had been Tuesday. When Sherlock saw the drawn droplet of rain that had fell down from his hair to run down his torso, only to get stuck in few hairs just above the waistband of the jeans, he shivered. He felt goose bumps coming up and his breath caught. This wasn't just a drawing; this was a piece of art in the making. It was masculine, but also graceful, elegant, and even a bit erotic, but it was also very him. The only thing that John had yet to complete was his face. It was set up already, and Sherlock could see where his lips would part a bit, and where the small wrinkles of his eyes were going to be.
"That's Beth. You haven't seen any footage of the infected, did you?"
"Good. I'll always remember you, too." Goodbye, gorgeous."
"Please, Ava. Try. For me."
"Yes John. That was the best I could think off to get us both in the class at the same time. If we pretended not to know each other, we couldn't talk together, could we? Can't you see that it's quite brilliant? And besides, you might be to old to act like an eighteen year old, like you said, but your definitely to young to act as my father."
Sherlock walked into the dressing room and shrugged of his dressing gown to put on John's jumper. It kind of smelled like him. Stupid, of course. He took it out of John's wardrobe, it was freshly washed. It couldn't smell like him. He put on his trousers while he heard Esmeralda and John talk.
"What? You shaved your sack?"
It was Sherlock's time to look confused now.
The three of them ate, laughed and drank, telling each other big stories, making fun of Sherlock ("No way! Did he really say that?") Talking about their cases ("Really? You sure you didn't made it up?") and about their every day life. (A real skull Why?) When Sherlock went out to smoke and get some fresh air, Ava poured herself another wine.
"I don't consider myself gay. I just happen to have fallen in love with a man. Never planned on it."
John pushed the man aside, but David grabbed John's arm and pulled him back.
"No, I haven't."
Sherlock stood up too.
"Tell Nita Angie sent ya. Hope you find you're bloke."
"Yes."
"I showed you the footage of my last attempt. You see anything different from them?"
"I need to talk to her."
"O my god. Sherlock! Sherlock, please! Hush... easy there. It's alright, everything is going to be alright."
"South of London. Just finished my interview with the last victim’s late wife."
John had no idea how to reply to that.
"Maybe I already have."
Sherlock felt his cheeks blush a bit and turned his face away from her.
John looked at the man that had talked to him. Skinny, filthy and white as a sheet. He looked more like a ghost than John did.
"John? What do you mean? He never mentioned it? He never said a word?"
“You know. Back study?  There will be a lot of flesh to draw, very difficult. And, no offence, but your man is rather hot. A proper piece of eye candy, I would say. I can think of worse things to paint.”
David shrugged and walked inside.
"I believe I'm in one now."
The look John gave him was something in between the 'Fuck you and do as I say' Captain Watson look and the 'trust me; I know what I'm saying’ Doctor Watson look.
"As suspected."
"I'm fine."
"It's not fair."
John looked at his drawing in front of him. She was right. The previous drawing had something special. Something that he managed to do in the past with people who he really connected with, but not in the least on this level.
Today is the day.
"I will."
And when John and Sherlock were back in the hostel, they went to the bar to talk and drink together, until John decided they had enough, and managed to get Sherlock with him upstairs, towards their shared bedroom.
“Right, well boys, take a seat. I think we need to talk about this first.”
But it was too late. Sherlock already pulled the door of the pub open and rushed outside. John tried to pass David to hurry himself after him, but David blocked his way.
He shook up out of his murmurings when John put down a cup of tea next to him. Sherlock blinked his eyes. How long had he been gone?
"Shut up, John."
"Hello Gerald." He was greeted by the three. Two men and one woman were smoking, and Sherlock took the offered cigarette thankfully.
"Sherlock?" He heard someone say.
Chest: Pain while breathing in. Tenderness on chest, Muscle spasms of the rib cage; Heavily bruised ribs.
I showered myself thoroughly, shaved myself properly, taking my time. I got myself dressed in my favourite clothes, (the jumper you liked so much, but I just couldn't wear anymore.) and I even got out to get some fresh air, taking a walk though the park. I went to the licensed victualler's shop and bought myself an expensive, beautiful honey coloured whisky. It was our anniversary after all. Tonight I went to Angelo's. I sat at our table. The table I had been sitting at three years ago, looking at the marvellous man across me, and I remembered the feeling of the first butterfly awakening in my stomach. I ordered your favourite, combined with a superb bottle of wine. It was good. It all felt good this way. I feel I got to say goodbye like this. Goodbye to the best two years of my life, almost forgetting the last one I just went through.
Sherlock's mouth got dry, and his hands shook. His whole body was trembling in fact. He sat himself down in the desk chair, trying too breath. The rest of the conversation didn't reach his mind. John didn't deny it. He didn't say it out loud, but he didn't deny it.
Sherlock inhaled from his cigarette, folding his arm around him to keep himself warm. David lit himself another cigarette and started talking again.
With big steps he went back in, to see how John was holding up.
"I'm an idiot." He said under his breath, trying to breath properly again.
"Sherlock Holmes? Who's asking?"
"Why do you say that?"
"Yes. So you do remember?"
"No, no, no. Don't be. I understand. It's private. Your emotions are in those shades. It's like a diary. You don't show people your diary either."
Sherlock wanted to make a remark until he saw John's face.
"Shut up."
John let out a soft giggle.
He said serious, before his face broke into a grin.
"Too bad. Come, this room."
But it didn't matter. Without John, nothing mattered. When he woke up the next day in a hospital, he almost couldn't believe it. Someone had found him and had felt empathy for him, and had made sure he was treated. He was given another chance.
"Sort of."
Sherlock was staring back. Their eyes met and locked to each other for a moment. He felt his cheeks redding again and he swallowed again. His eyes went down to Sherlock's chest, trying to only see the shadows and the lights, the skin tones and the muscles. It sort of worked, until there was a droplet of rain falling from Sherlock's hair onto his collarbone, rolling down towards his chest, just to follow his path down towards his belly button. He saw the skin shiver where the droplet rolled down, leaving a small wet stripe behind.
“Good afternoon gentlemen, Came to see the show?”
Hell. He should have listened to his brother.
"Get out of my way."
Further he felt like his whole body was broken, as if his skin was to tight and it was trying to rupture itself. He was running a fever. His lips were swollen, his fingers were swollen, he had a big swollen bruise on the back of his head, his lower lip was torn, and if he had been able to open his eyes he could see the discolouration covering his body, going from red to blue and even black now. He didn't need to see it to feel it.
"You're John Watson, aren't you?" He asked angrily.
She looked disapproving at the smile he had on his face.
"It's nice that you don't need me much this time. It feels like vacation. I like it." John turned his head towards his struggling roommate, giggling at the sight. But suddenly John turned serious.
"It is very final."
"What's this?" He asked, frowning to the plate as if it had just said something very offensive.
"That was two days ago! I'm bored!"
John turned the car onto the long road heading towards Baskerville.
"Haven't you been home yet?" He lisped a bit due to the still somewhat swollen lips.
Sherlock shrugged.
He hissed.
"Oh. Stake out. I'll get you a rental car and you can watch Marc. I'll shadow David."
"First, I'll make sure none of the subjects are alive, which is only Beth and then, you and me are going to destroy everything about this failed experiment. All the files, all the samples, everything. I want to prevent this becoming some sort of biological weapon at any costs. No one can ever use it, not even bloody England. And you, my dear, are going to help me do it."
John's eyes squeezed again.
"You're on speaker now, John can hear you."
"So, what's your plan, then, little devil?"
Maybe you started dating again, found yourself a nice, lovely woman. Someone who fills your heart as you did mine.
"That's John's job."
He slowly opened his eyes and when the angel saw he looking at him he lowered himself down next to his face.
John grinned at her.
John tried to pull his hand back and to take a step back.
"Why would you want to make sure that I am okay while you were the one with the nightmare?"
He was thankful that Sherlock had given him something back. Something he thought he would never have again, even though Sherlock had no idea that he did something like that. That was part of the reason this feelings towards his room mate came up again, stronger than ever before, nothing more, nothing less. And it had definitely nothing to do with a certain raindrop making its way down, leaving a small wet trail behind.
"Bloody hell...Does he know?"
Sherlock finally asked.
Ava and Sherlock had just finished their dinner together. He brought another bottle of wine and they were drinking and smoking together, talking about their favourite music before there was a long silence between them.
"Well, what did he want?"
John lifted an eyebrow.
"Of course it will. You're short and I'm skinny. It will fit easily. Now come here, I want you close."
"As a doctor, you probably haven't got any cigarettes on you?"
"I does doesn't it? That never stopped you before. And besides, we've been inside this house for ever." He said, still looking at John, a grin on his face.
John pulled the door almost close again. He moved towards the neighbours on the other side. Low porch, low fence between the gardens. The house seemed abandoned, the grass and weed reached to his knees. So he had to move slowly. Carefully he got to the fence between the gardens and climbed over it ducking down at the other side.
"I don't want too, either."
When he got down again a few minutes later, Sherlock had recovered himself.
"We'll see about that."
Sherlock chuckled.
"I'm done. This man is so enormously dull. If I don't get some action fast, I'm falling asleep behind the wheel here."
"O my god. Sherlock! Sherlock, please!   Hush... easy there. It's alright, everything is going to be alright." John said dropping on his knees next to the man. He felt so much relief his chest hurt. He saw Sherlock's mouth make an movement.
“Have you been working here long?” Sherlock interrupted, no interest in formalities.
"He's going to get through this."
Thanks for reading, leave kudos or comments, they make me happy!
"John's a good writer. Loved his blog. You're website was a bit more... clinical. Still interesting though. Why did you take down the two hundred fifty three different types of ashes? Sounded interesting."
"I can go home with you this afternoon."
Sherlock asked curious.
"I did. D.I. Lestrade informed me."
The woman looked at him, her eyes strangely sharp.
"God damned! Why can't we just find it?! Why!? We were so close! Fuck!"
"It all happened in such a short period of time. There was a man in the village, where we used to go for our shopping and just to hang out and interact with the villagers. You know, playing football, rugby, that sort of thing. We helped them if we could. There was a man that had a market stall and sold herbs and spices. I used to go to him and trade food for his spices. His name was Sadeq. His grandson Ahmed was helping him, and he spoke a little bit English. One day, the old man was working on the roof of his house, and cut himself pretty badly in his hand. Ahmed knew I was a doctor in the camp, so he came looking for me there. Of course I went with him to help his grandfather. I stitched him up and gave him medications. Antibiotics, painkillers, things like that. After that, we spend a lot of time together. He reminded me so much of my own father. We couldn't communicate, but with a bit of creativity we managed to understand each other when Ahmed wasn't there. It was as if Sadeq could see beyond the soldiers outfit. We connected, and we both felt it. I went by his house at least once a week, but if I had the opportunity twice or more, helping him and his family. He lost his wife years before, and he took care of his sick daughter. Her husband was taken by the Taliban, and they didn't know what had become of him. His daughter had a stroke the year before, making her invalid. Sadeq lived with her and her son in their little house. I helped out where I could. Not only with medical treatments, but also with food and I helped out fixing the house. One day, after almost four months of me helping them, he showed me his drawings, and he had asked his grandson to act as a interpreter. He then asked me if he could draw me. I said yes. He made a beautiful piece of art of me, if you can imagine that. It was breath taking. So, a few days later, I decided to return the favour. I drew him. A portrait. When he saw it, he cried. He took the sketchbook out of my hands and looked at all the pictures I made there. He was so happy to find someone with the same interests. I gave him more than half of my pencils, and he was so grateful for it. His grandson translated for us again. He told me that I was a good man. That he had known it from the start, but he now had seen my soul when he looked at my sketchbook. He told me that I had a beautiful soul, and that I was a gift of Allah. He called me the golden angel.
"I expect no less from you."
"True. But there is nothing else I can do, can I? Just... follow your heart, John. Make him happy."
John shook his head.
"Eve and Ley are always together. And they must be in the area. Let's hope they saw something. Come, follow me."
"I'm just going home to shower and change my clothes. Been in these for three days now."
"Don't be an idiot. They're dead. And if they're not, we need to kill them, before they spread the virus."
"Can you two just stop nagging at each other for once?!"
Ava's breathing became even shallower until it stopped completely.
A red signal flashed on both their screens, and they immediately turned their faces towards it.
"All right. Goodnight, John."
Hmm... You've had woman on all three continents."
"To keep an eye on you, I need to be here, don't I?"
"You're forgetting annoying, but you'll learn." John smirked back.
"They shaved my scrotum."
"Me too, Pretty."
"Shut up."
"Please, Sherlock, stay with me, don't leave me."
"Your man is very gifted." She said. Sherlock lifted an eyebrow and went to stand beside her, looking down at the sketch in front of him.
"John!" He said relieved but when he saw the molested body behind him he looked shocked.
"Me? As an art student? Have you seen me lately? I'm not sure if I can manage to look like an eighteen year old anymore."
"Ta, David. That would be great. Can't walk around here like this."
"Thank you."
Left knee: Severe pain. Unable to move, swollen, cold leg from knee down, tingling sensation: Knee dislocation.
"Everything?"
"Drink?"
"Care to join me?"
"Dr. Watson. How can I be at your service tonight?
Thanks for all the bookmarks and the feedback!
I loved you. I had denied it at first to myself, but I loved you. You madman with your long limbs and biting tongue, your beautiful voice and gorgeous hands. With your sulking's and tantrums, your deep laugh and the caring I sometimes saw in your eyes. A look you kept hidden except for me. Letting the people around you believe that you were cold, heartless, a sociopath. Except for me. You had shown me more, so much more. I have seen you scared, admit that I was your only friend. I have seen the look in your eyes when you thought I couldn't see you. I have seen a fraction of the man behind the mask. A man with a heart, a man that made my own heart sing with joy. I never acted on it. I liked to think that neither of us did because we were afraid that one of us had read the signs wrong. And neither of us wanted to put our special friendship at stake. I didn't just loved you. I had fallen in love with you. In love with that beautiful mind of yours, in love with that handsome body of yours. The butterflies in my stomach used to flutter happily when ever I saw your face lit up when you discovered something. They used to flutter when you reacted on my compliments or when I was bedazzled with your deductions. They used to flutter when you chose not to just let the violin haul but sing the most beautiful sounds into the living room. They used to be trashing my stomach when you gazed at me, looking too long into my eyes, looking at my mouth, taking your eyes from them just to late. They used to trash my stomach when ever I saw the small smile on your face, just for me, or when you touched me without realising what it did to me. And my butterflies used to go insane and even left my stomach to take over the rest of my body on that spares times I almost did something with those feelings. I almost kissed you in the hallway of 221b, I almost grabbed the sheet from you at Buckingham palace, just to wrap us both in it. I almost touched that distracting arse when you were bent over some corpse at a crime scene. And on our last evening together, running down the streets, handcuffed on each other, I wanted to do it. Adrenalin was pushing through my veins, my was heart full of you being attached to me, and there was only a small metal fence between us. I should have done it, I should have leaned in further and take those damned lips with my own. Then maybe I would not have been sitting here, every morning and every night on my bedside with my gun in my hands. Would it be today?
The next morning Sherlock put John to work at the village. They needed to be sure that the virus really didn't leave the lab, despite Ava's confirmation, and John wanted to catch up with Henry Knight, the man who got them here three years ago.
Truly confused, Sherlock looked at his best friend. Was this conversation really happening?
"Who says that?"
There was a gift box inside. Carefully he took it out and stared at it in his hands. It was an exclusive Caran d'Ache Graphite Line deluxe set, complete with eraser and sharper. It was a set of one of the best pencils available; it must have cost a fortune. Sherlock had bought him a pencil set. Not just any set, but something special. How could he have known that the pencils of Caran d'Ache were his favorite? He never bought something so exclusive for himself, just the normal, everyday pencils they sell at any art shop. But this set was amazing. John opened the box and let his fingers slide over the pencils, neatly stocked next to each other. Beautiful.
"Please, mister Holmes, don't hold back for me. I can take it."
As if he could. The angel was indeed an idiot. A pretty one, but still. He heard more than he saw the angel getting his jacket off. No sheet then, pity. The jacket was lied out over his body. It hurt. He moaned.
John sat a plate with food in front of him and took a seat at the other side of the kitchen table when Sherlock looked up at him.
"Why Three Continents Watson?"
"Well, I am your doctor, so it seems that I am obligated to know."
"I wasn't going to handle it."
Bloody posh boy.
"I'm curious what you want to do to me when we get home." His voice soft and low.
"That was Marc."
"You would have loved it. We could have solved crimes together."
"Do you want to? Keep that distance?" Sherlock asked him, giving him his full attention.
"That's what happens when you nick my jumpers."
Slowly he drew himself back. Not wanting to let go ever again, but it had to be done.
Sherlock nagged when he finally picked up the phone after it rang for the sixth time straight until it went to voicemail.
His mind wandered off to his room mate, friend, blogger. He knew John had been attracted to him when they first met, four years ago. Just the way Sherlock was attracted to him from the first time he laid eyes on him. That short but trained body, the golden tone of his skin and those very blue eyes had come to his attention. He had made sure during that first dinner that he wasn't interested in any kind of relationship or something, but maybe he could have this man just for a night...
"I know. She was special, that one."
"A few hours, yes."
"Is it human tissue?"
"I wouldn't do that if I were you. Unless you want you're life to stop tonight." He said to me. And something in that deep voice withheld me from getting in that car. It saved my life. The man was arrested two days later for murdering three prostitutes.
"Yes. You'd love Bakerstreet. It's cozy. We have a skull on the mantelpiece and a smiley painted in the wall."
Today is the day.
"Look. I..." John started.
His breath got stuck in his throat. His eyes scanned the pencil stripes on the paper in front of him. He saw the shadows created with more or less pressure, the absence of pencil where there had been hard sunlight. He stared at the portrait in front of him. He saw the hint of a smile drawn on the perfectly shaped face; he even saw the shine on the dog tags that were drawn around the soldier’s neck. It was gorgeous.
God, They are really good with turning around each other, aren't they? But there are thing you can bury deep, but can't keep from coming back up.
The man in front of him pumped himself up. He was big, but in the state he was in, he was never going to win a fight against John, and he knew it.
Right. Shadows. He tried to clear his head and not to look to much to that amazing arse in front of him, and started drawing the left shoulder.
O god. Why did he say that?
Instead of going straight to the cafeteria, Sherlock walked towards the door heading outside. With any luck there were some smokers in the class, and that way they could both cover as much suspects as possible. When he opened the door he saw three people standing around a big bin that was used as an ashtray. The rain had finally stopped and even the wind was slightly less than over an hour ago, and Sherlock stepped outside.
When he reached the neighbours porch he stopped and listened. Everything was quiet. He reached for his gun and took it steady in hand, moving soundlessly to the porch he had to go through. Carefully he reached for the door handle and slowly he pushed it down, making sure it didn't creak. It was locked from the inside. Of course. He got back to the porch of the neighbours, and tried that one, just as careful. It opened. John peeked through the ajar door, checking the partition between this garden and the next. It was a high hedge. He couldn't get over it or underneath it without making sound. Shit.
Within minutes John was fast asleep. He didn't even take his trousers or shoes off. His face was buried deep in his pillow, his blanked only covering part of his back.
"Please."
Ava sat in the chair at her desk, the syringe in her hand.
"What? Why not?"
"God damned! Don't you bleed on me! Where not on that stage yet! You're ruining my work! You idiot!" The man stamped away, returning with a cloth which he pressed hard against his mouth, to stop the bleeding. When Sherlock tried to pull his face away to get more air, Marc set his knee onto his dislocated shoulder, making him growl. When the cloth was taken away from his lips, Sherlock inhaled as deep as he could. He needed air!
"Zombies John! Zombies! We can go to that nice hotel we where in last time, and I already nicked Mycroft's all access card , so we don't have to wait."
"There's more?"
"So, John. Any experience with drawing?" She asked softly. John gave her a half smile.
Sherlock smiled at that.
"Hmmm... Like it when you get mouthy."
"I see. Come."
"Sherlock. You've had surgery just four days ago. And yesterday you couldn't even stay awake for more than one hour at the time. Of course they won't let you out of the bed."
"Stop talking to me like I am some innocent, inexperienced, young man, John. Just be clear."
"Well, it's a long story, but if you're up to it..."
"Good night, John."
"Come on!" John said.
Even now that man made his stomach twist with joy. How inconceivable. But very welcome. That smile could lit his heart everywhere, any time. God. He never truly had him and now he never would. Stupid. He heard Marc getting up from his stool again. The man yawned. He started gathering his brushes and probably cleaning them, and when he was ready he came back to him. Sherlock's body cramped, as if his transport was trying to get away from the man. Marc chuckled, and stroked Sherlock's side, causing another spasm. He then went back to tying his ankles together, causing pain to his sprained ankle and intense pain at his dislocated knee. It made him see light flashes behind his eyes. He moaned, causing Marc to laugh. Then he did the same with his wrists. His dislocated shoulder almost made him pass out again. Sherlock was repeating in his head to himself; "stay awake, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake."
"John..."
"I'm not police for Christ sake! Let me through!"
Christ! He was never going to be able to sleep again when his mind was focused on Sherlock. He really should stop thinking about his roommate. The possibility that this genius, cocky, self-centered, wanting to be sociopath whirlwind of a man had a soft spot for a forty year old, short, retired army doctor were nil. And he definitely wasn't going to push his luck. Scared to lose this marvel that had become the most important thing in his life now. He already lost him once and that had been unbearable. John just had to keep his emotions at bay and try to not scare Sherlock off. That was something he could do. He already managed to do it for the last four years. No big deal.
"John?" Esmeralda asked him. She was standing next to him, looking down at the work on the desk.
"You daft git. Really? Do you really think so low of me? Jesus.."
"Fuck."
Take of your shoes, and climb into bed with me."
Definitely not good.
"Already? I haven't even started properly yet."
Sherlock frowned.
"Like shit. The fever is getting worse. I don't think I can manage this much longer."
"Chuck!" Nita yelled.
"So. It's just you and me, then. Any requests?"
"Fuck... How did you manage to not explode? More then ten years..."
John had been afraid that it would take everything he had to keep the detective at home and resting, but he soon discovered that Sherlock was eager to be cuddled and pampered, and when he recovered from most of his injuries, he had a very healthy sex drive. So after a few weeks of stuffing him with cookies, tea and take away, cuddling on the sofa and in bed, Sherlock held his promise and used those clever fingers and mouth for the best.
"Bring your new set. I'm curious to hear your thoughts about using them."
"No, I don't. No talent for that one, I'm afraid. How could you tell?"
"Why doesn't that surprise me?"
"I know. Stay?"
And with that Ava walked out.
"Good evening gentlemen. Thank you for joining us tonight. I'm terribly sorry but the heater broke down today, so it's a bit chilly in here. I hope you won't mind. My name is Esmeralda Pointer. You are John? I presume? Then you must be Gerald." She said smiling at the men. The woman greeting them was mildly said eccentric. She was about sixty-five years old, had wild grey hair and was wearing some sort of purple dress, matching her lipstick. She smelled like incense. Sherlock and John had decided that the names Sherlock and John weren't going to work here to go undercover. They were still in London, and even though they were low profile at this moment, there had been enough cases of them that made the news the last few years. And the name John might be common enough, Sherlock was a name you didn't hear much in London, or in the UK, or in the rest of the world for that matter.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
"What happened?"
John's mouth was open, and Ava could see his eyes getting watery.
"Is it? I heard Esmeralda say to him that it looked good. She never gives compliments if they're not earned." The other man (Han? Hank? Harry?) mingled in. Sherlock just shrugged again. He took a big inhalation from his cigarette and shot the bum away.
It was perfect! They could go to the art school together. John could pretend to be a student, while he could act as a model himself. He fit the description and he had no problem with sitting still for long periods of time. He emailed back to the director of the art school that he accepted the case and his demands, and within five minutes he got a reply back. That was settled, then. Sherlock turned away from his computer to look at John. He was sitting in his chair, tired from a long day at work, reading another dull novel, sipping from his tea.
"Yes."
"Ow you cheeky bastard! If that's an invitation to scratch, than you're going to be disappointed. Were not going in to this... Whatever this is, like that."
"I'm sure."
"I'm just going our for a bit, take a walk, heading towards the shop. Need anything?"
"We wouldn't be here if not for her."
"Fuck." Ava hissed.
I knew it when I woke up. I didn't take the gun out of the nightstand this morning, knowing it wasn't time yet. For the first time since your fall I have slept a full night without waking up. I even slept in. I felt more rested than I have felt in months. I felt content, finally making the decision.
"Can you please get off that pink cloud you're on and talk to me for a second?"
For once, Mycroft had been right.
"When did it happen? Sherlock didn't tell me."
"Thank you for sharing this with me. It is gorgeous."
He had changed over the years of course. He wasn't the popular boy anymore, he smiled less then he used too, and he wasn't that quick and maneuverable as he used to be. But that happens when you get older. The man in front of him had changed too. Instead of gangly he had gotten lean, instead of hiding himself mocking in the library, thinking that everyone around him was an idiot, he now went out and told everyone that they were idiots, he still mocked, but he also had fun chasing criminals and solving mysteries. They both changed. Life happened.
John smiled at him, sitting in the kitchen reading the morning paper.
"You smoke? God, you're getting better and better."
"Sherlock?" John asked in the last room of the house. He narrowed his eyes to see better in the dark, but he wasn't there. The others in the room ignored him or looked at him as if he was some kind of ghost. But one man looked up at him.
"Do you remember the Baskerville Military Base?"
The last item inside the box was a sketchbook. It held heavy quality paper inside, with just the right amount of texture he liked. It was of the same brand he used to buy for himself. He always bought himself good paper.
"I'm here."
Sherlock was still sitting in his chair, looking into the fire, but not seeing the flames. Was there another connecting element between the victims? They were all of a certain age, they were fit and tall, and they all had been sitting model for an art class. Two of them were gay, one single and the other in a long term relationship. The other two were straight, one of them married, a father and a schoolteacher, the other one was the youngest of them, barely thirty years old, wild lifestyle, an artist himself. What was the thing that triggered the killer? What had caught this man's eye? Had he been watching them as he was watched himself when he sat there? He should focus on the other students as well when he was posing. Not just John.
"Is that so? How can I be sure you're a friend of hers? You don't seem like the type she usually hangs with."
"Please, can you just get her for me or tell me where she is?"
John stood up, going to alert a nurse that he was awake.
“Too bad he’s already taken, isn’t it?”
Sherlock looked at his phone. It was almost three forty in the morning. He looked at his roommate slumped in the chair and a tiny smile played his lips for a second, gone before Ava was sure she had seen it.
"Of course. We have work to do, don't we?"
"He's asleep now. He will not wake up until this evening. Have you heard what has happened to him?"
"Don't worry, Doctor. I'll keep this door closed. And he can't do much harm outside, can he?" Ava said.
Sherlock frowned and looked at his friend as if he was a bit slow.
"After your fall..."
"Thanks for nothing, then."
What do you do inside there, than?"
"Mycroft." John greeted him.
"It's true. But always female, never male. Why?"
"No, couldn't get close enough. I shot him."
"Don't have any. Want you now."
"Did you get into a fight?"
It has been several months after the case of the missing models. After they found the body's of the four men burried in the abandoned neighbours' garden, Marc Jenkins was charged with the torture and murder of the four victims and the kidnapping, torture, and intended homicide of Sherlock. Sherlock had made a statement when he was well enough, and thank god he didn't want to observe and study the paintings the man had made of him or the other victims. From what Greg had told John about them, he really didn't want to see them.
O bloody hell. How was he going to do this?
"I don't have anything to go with, so I'll say top. I can relate to that, as you can imagine. But who knows."
"I'm sorry! I didn't realize... It didn't occur to me you would be gay."
"David once said to me that he didn't have any interest in getting me into his bed."
Together they walked across the graveyard.
"Of course. When I'm finished I'll turn you around and start on that side. After I've finished that too, we'll prepare you for the next round. Now, hold still."
"Ava, have you taken the serum?"
Idiot.
John nodded approvingly and took another bite of his Thai. Sherlock retreated himself towards the bathroom, while John finished his dinner alone.
"How did you even get here? I took the car."
"John?"
"I... I don't know. John. I don't... You know. Sentiment."
"You told me that you used to draw as a child. When did you stop?"
"Excuse me?" John asked confused.
"Yeah."
"He might like me, but he loves you you know. A lot. He never shuts up about you. And when he talks about you his eyes begin to sparkle, he sometimes even flushes or gets stuck for words. So, if you want him in your life, do something about it."
The call was Greg's. But it was from almost two hours ago, so no need to call him back.
"What is Indiana Jones?"
It was already late at night. John was almost asleep in his chair when Sherlock had started talking again.
"Let's call it a danger night. He went off without his phone or keys, and I have no idea where he went off to. Can't you track him down or something?"
And it was as good as he thought it would be. Finally it happened, it was something he had fantasised about for years. John wanted to do it again. He wanted those lips on his own again. He wanted all of that man. What did he have to lose? But it was Sherlock. And he had seen the confusion in his eyes afterwards. Not just confusion,but something that looked like pain, or fear. Sherlock was probably now hiding in some drug den, shooting up, getting high to forget that this had ever happened. For God's sake! Why didn't Mycroft call him back?
"Can I hold you?"
Yesterday he had gone off to work, only to find Sherlock exactly the same as he left him that morning. Lying on the couch in his pyjamas and dressing gown, his eyes closed an his hands in front of his face, completely gone into his mind palace. The man in question was now sitting behind his microscope, totally unaware of John rummaging around in the kitchen behind him.
"Of course. Quite bored, actually. What are you doing here? It's three in the morning."
"Why?" He asked Mycroft.
O god.
He felt a bumb on the back of Sherlock's head, and he let his fingers touch the rest of his skull, feeling swellings and bumps all over.
"Okay. Fire away, then."
John laughed and unpacked the food.
"You think?"
The only one that mattered. The only one that was capable to make him feel whole and destroy him at the same time.
John took another sip of his tea, thinking about it.
"Nah. Not t'day. Same thing, try Mellon, she might seen 'im."
Thank you all for reading!
Idiot.
"Gerald! I'm glad you..." John started, but when their eyes locked, John's words got stuck in his throat. This wasn't Gerald, this was definitely Sherlock. Sherlock's eyes were extremely pale, and they looked furious. There was a fire burning in them that would burn the toughest man in the room down to a pile of ash with one look. Sherlock took two big steps forward and forged David with his body to let go of John's hand. John reacted confused and turned his body towards Sherlock's, forgotten the fact that he was supposed to act like he was somebody else, and Sherlock took the opportunity to wrap his arms around John and pulling him aggressively against him, a low growl coming from his throat. John felt Sherlock's hands gripping his arse possessively and the tall man tilted his face down, looking John in the eyes.
Sherlock chuckled at that remark, but it ended with a growl of pain.
"Only god knows why, but yes. Yes, I do. I need to find him. I thought he was angry with me, but now I think he panicked.
"We need to talk." John said.
"I want to touch you everywhere and I want to see your face when you come."
"How does it feel to you?"
"Told you."
"I... Ehm. Thank you, Ava. Thank you for our conversations and your wise words. I'll do something with them, I promise. Thank you. It was good to get to know you. Well... good luck, I guess."
"That depends on who is asking for her."
It has been a roller-coaster of emotions for the last chapters, and were not finished yet.
"What? O, yes. I'm sure."
She turned back around and winked at John before talking to the class. But John didn't hear a word of what she was saying. That arse was fucking distracting. He could imagine the jealous look that David would have on his face now. Christ. John would be jealous of himself too, if that arse was his to touch. But it wasn't. And it definitely wasn't David's to touch either.
He closed the door and he could hear it lock. Ava opened the other side, took the pack out, and held it against her nose, inhaling deeply.
"Well, we talked before class. And I might have told him that I thought your body was pretty hot. And I believe he now thinks that I'm after you. For a second I thought he would rip my throat out. Bloody hell. He's a jealous type, isn't he? But please, don't get me wrong. You are gorgeous, but not a man I would bed. He has nothing to worry about."
"Well, yes, actually. You know, when I was a kid, I loved to draw. It takes me back, I guess."
"You think that's wise?"
"You are already part of it."
"He does?"
Sherlock just nodded at that. Ava bent forward and took the pack of cigarettes from the desk. She lit one.
But thank god John had broken his gaze, closing his eyes and taking a few steading breaths, just to open his eyes and look at Sherlock as if he no longer saw the man. Then he started to work.
"About?"
"I know. But I couldn't have you. So I tried to live a normal life as your purely platonic friend and roommate, tried to put my focus elsewhere, dating nice woman, but they just could never compete with you."
"Okay."
"You did?" Ava said, the lightheartedness back in her voice. She got up from her chair and opened the hatch. She took the bag out and brought it with her to the desk.
"Imagine Sherlock with brain damage."
"Hey. Good morning."
"I'm here." Nita said.
"I'll be waiting for you, gorgeous. Have a good night. And you too, John."
Happy reading!
"John..." He moaned whining and he got unconscious again. John felt his stomach twist.
"That's great! Just some drip to hydrate you?"
"Yeah, something like that. Just, let me know if you hear from him, okay?"
"He's not gay."
"Rather who."
"Where are you?"
"Pack my bags."
What was that on his face? Worry?
"Smoking? Really Sherlock? You're not undercover at the moment. So you don't have any excuse to do so."
"Then get a hobby!"
"Yes. He would be here around dinner."
"He needs you. He needs you more than he realize's. And you need him."
Marc started to lash out, strike after strike hit him. On his back, his shoulders, his bum, his legs, everywhere. Sherlock growled at every hit, trying to keep his mind clear. There had to be a way out of this. The last strike was hard on his ribs, and he made a pitiful sound because of it.
I left. I left Bakerstreet and it's owner. It was too overwhelming, staying there. Everything remembered me of you. The astray you had stolen from Buckingham palace, the skull on the mantelpiece, the microscope in the kitchen, the secret stack of cigarettes, the way too expensive shampoo in the shower, your violin. I just had to close my eyes to see you standing in front of the window, your eyes partly closed, your mind wandering, your fingers cherishing the strings and bow, completely lost in the sounds you produced. But I couldn't imagine those beautiful tones anymore. It was too much. So I left Bakerstreet. I left Mrs Hudson. She cried, of course, and if my heart hadn't died already with you, I would have been heart broken once more. She asked me to stay, told me that I just needed more time, that this feelings would fade to something less painful. She was wrong. The pain stayed, and became even worse, even without Bakerstreet surrounding me. But I was sure that I made the right decision. Within Bakerstreet I had no chance to heal, and I owed our friends that I at least tried that. Try to heal, try too fix my broken, absent heart, try to let the sounds come back. But I knew it was a lost cause. I never tried hard enough, I couldn't fight that pain, it was just too much.
"That's quite the question you're asking."
High Functioning Sociopath Holmes.
"Quite good, I have to say. You're the best male model we've had in years. You're body looks like it's made to be painted and your posing is spectacular. It's hard to find models of your age and physique. The last one disappeared before I could finish my work."
No response. Fuck. He needed to take action.
"Yes. I am."
Sherlock frowned.
John huffed out a short laugh.
"My heart."
The woman smiled at David's remark, and Sherlock decided to get along with it.
"That's not true."
"Move out."
"Ssssh. Your okay. It was just a bad dream."
John chuffed out a sort laugh.
"Hard and deep." He growled. Letting his tongue drag a straight line across John hand.
"What?"
"Greg..."
"Yes."
This was my life now. Soundless and empty. So every morning and every night I sat on my bedside with my gun in my hands. Would it be today?
"That's... nice?"
" Your work, It's mind blowing. I would love to see more of it. If you feel like it, of course. If you have more like this, we can even make an exposition of them. I know several galleries that would be happy to provide the space for art like this."
She replied, giving him a wink.
"Sherlock!"
He saw the dislocated shoulder and the very shallow breathing.
"You, are going to act as an art student."
Was there crime in heaven? Probably not. Dull, boring, and eternal. Ow bugger! This was going to be a disaster.
He finally made a friend. Not just a friend, no. He found himself a best friend, a pal, a partner. A man who didn't question him, who laughed at his tantrums and dealt with them, someone who listened to his deductions without judging him and calling him a freak, but praised him instead. A man who saw all of him, and still hadn't run away.
Even if it was a lie.
"Yes."
"Will you remember me when you're happily together with him?"
"So. Come here often?"
She gave him a sweet smile and squeezed his hand before she turned around to gather her things.
"Excuse me?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
"I want to thank you for getting your boyfriend to sit for us. It's hard to get a good model these days. Well, I won't keep you from starting. You seem eager enough. Will you start with a sketch?"
O god. This was it. He was waiting for this to happen. He just had hoped it wasn't going to be so soon. The extraordinary army doctor, blogger, friend, love of his life was leaving him.
"As if I don't know already."
"I'm going to take the sedative. It will take about ten minutes before I'm gone, and then, gorgeous, you are going to press the red button."
Thank you all for your kind words, comments and kudos.
"You do! Christ!"
"I'm going to kill him. I'm going to fucking kill that arsehole."
"You love him, don't you?"
John.
"He does."
"Yes you are. You can be bloody dense at times."
"The swelling in your face is almost gone."
"What happened with your cheek?"
"You're quite a little devil, aren't you?" Sherlock said laughing.
"Thanks, David. You rescued me here." David seemed fixed on John's torso, and John could see the man was impressed. John did keep his body fit, something he always had done. While John pulled the sweater over his head he could hear David gasp a little. Damn, this was embarrassing. While he pulled the sweater down around his chest, his head down as to see what he was doing, he glanced up trough his eyelashes. He could see the beginning of an erection in the other man's trousers. Bloody hell. He was only acting gay for two and a half weeks and only in a small group, and already there was a man with an obvious interest in him. Was this something woman had to endure all the time? That would be exhausting.
"I promise."
"You need to sleep." John said concerned.
"That really happened?"
He could hear the deep rumble of Sherlock's chuckle.
"Promise me you'll tell him?"
"My Golden angel."
Sherlock stopped pulling on his pyjama and looked at his friend.
“Yes he is, isn’t he?” he replied, his eyes scanning John’s face.
"Don't... don't say that, Ava."
"Have you ever... You know?"
"Yeah. A beer or something stronger?"
“Can we come in?” Sherlock asked while scanning his access card against the scanner next to the door towards the room the woman was in. Getting a red signal every time he tried.
