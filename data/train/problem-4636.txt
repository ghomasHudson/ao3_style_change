He steps closer to the lifeless body in front of him, carefully searching the waxen yellow skin. For cuts, for marks, for something he doesn‘t know yet, but will recognize once he‘s found it.
“Gotta try, Bobby. There‘s no way around it.”
“We could drive back,” he continues as there‘s no answer. He knows he‘s babbling, but next to slightly freaked out he‘s also bored and a little bit turned on. “Maybe even get some whipped cream on the way back, maybe some pie–”
“Sorry,” he says, and it comes out a lot hoarser than he intended it to. Still he doesn‘t move his fingers, can‘t, really, his gaze boring into Cas who looks at him with the darkened eyes of his fantasies. Cas‘s lips part slightly, and Dean‘s throat goes dry as he swallows, hard, trying to get back his slackening grip on reality and on his rational mind. Then he just thinks,
“Hey, you,” he commands, “hands up!”
, he wants to say,
“Don‘t move!” he bellows. “Who are you? What are you?”
Sometimes it‘s a barren plain, sometimes an abandoned graveyard, an old warehouse, Chuck‘s house. Always it‘s Cas dying and him helpless to do anything but watch. Just dreams, because–
“A siren?”
For a moment there‘s silence, then Cas speaks again as Dean crouches down to put a second line in front of the door because hey, better safe than sorry.
“We‘ll find a way,” he repeats, and this time his voice is firm, authoritative. The voice he‘s used in this kind of situations thousands of times before, his warrior voice. “We‘ll do some research, find her weakness. No one‘s going to die here, not even that bitch if that‘s what it takes.”
Every bit like Cas, except that Cas died on the floor of a run-down warehouse in Detroit three years ago.
Later he and Sam sit together on the front porch, each of them nursing a bottle of beer and watching the sun set. Dean feels relaxed, the exhaustion from the long drive and everything else tugging at his every limb, but not like before, not in a bad way. Cas‘s face is still in his mind, but it‘s a peaceful memory. No blood, no shattered bodies, just the barely there smile on his face as he fades away.
Cas just stares at him in utter puzzlement, eyes so wide Dean‘s almost sure he can see himself mirrored in them.
Again the angel ignores him, gathering up the two pieces of paper and stuffing them into his trench-coat. He turns around to fixate Dean with an electric blue stare.
Dean raises his eyebrows, taken aback. “We don‘t think you, well, killed him, Mrs. Miller,” he says, throwing Cas a perplexed look. The angel just frowns. “We were just wondering if you could tell us about that fight you had, thought maybe it could shed some light on this whole affair.”
She gapes at him in shock, then finds her voice again in an indignant sputter. “Edward Cullen? Twilight?” She shoots him a look that clearly says wherever he lived the last years, it couldn‘t have been this planet.
He creeps closer, pressed against the cool walls. The sound of his leather jacket against wallpaper, a whisper in the dim twilight of the hall. The butt of his .45 is smooth in his hands and he tightens his grip around it.
“I‘m here, Dean,” he hears Cas‘s even voice, and then the body is lifted of him and he scrambles to his feet. Still swaying slightly he comes to stand opposite the angel, swiftly surveying the scene of carnage around them. Through the ragged hole in the wall he can see the living room, most of its furniture splintered and trashed, one of the windows shattered. One of the demons is still lying on top of the broken dinner table, the other one‘s collapsed on the stairs, her left arm and leg bending in odd angles, her neck slashed.
“I–,” Cas stops, his gaze wandering over the table, then snapping back to Dean. “I don‘t know.” His voice is full of surprise, his eyes wide.
“Dammit,” he curses under his breath as he jumps out of the bed and storms out of the room.
As he gets closer to the city center there are more and more houses on the sides of the street. Most of them look pretty run-down, all peeling paint and cracks in the walls, and he wonders if the whole town looks like this. There are, surprisingly, many young people around, but as Dean passes them slowly he sees the looks of defeat in their too-old eyes. The unemployment rate is probably through the roof, but at least he can‘t spot any Mormons.
Carefully he starts cleaning the skin. Neither of them says a word, the only sound in the room the occasional creaking of the bed springs when Cas shifts his weight. Dean tries his best to stay concentrated on not hurting Cas, but it‘s kind of hard when he can feel the angel‘s gaze firmly fixated on his hands. Makes his neck tingle, a shiver running down the inside of his spine, pooling in his stomach, making it hard to breathe.
“Cas‘s dead, isn‘t he,” Dean says.
Osiris as well as Beaver are real places in Utah. Apparently Osiris is a ghost town, which was the reason I chose it – besides the name obviously.
With a sigh Dean resigns to the fact that the sexy times are over and gets up himself. Moments later he steps up behind the angel, pulling a shirt over his head and peeking over Cas‘s shoulder. There‘s a piece of paper in Cas‘s hands, one of the pages Brittany gave them. It‘s a sketchy drawing, ballpoint pen on graph paper, unskilled, shaky lines yet surprisingly detailed. Looks like just a normal house to Dean, two-storied, a lawn, a mailbox next to a tree that could be a willow. Yet Cas is staring at it with a frown on his face as if this little piece of paper would hold the key to all their problems.
“And this couldn‘t wait till Monday?” Her words bear a slight lisp he notices only now. A barely audible fracture in tone that makes her voice sound almost like a hiss.
“Finally,” she says, heaving a fake sigh. “I started to think you‘d stand out there forever.”
“Are you sure?” Silence, then, “Your loss, darling, it‘s a very good Oolong.”
He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, wills his treacherous body to calm down. Wipes the blood off his hand, gets into his car and leaves.
“There have been hint he‘s been seeing a woman before he was murdered. You got an idea who that could‘ve been?”
standing here in his room.
A little bit.
“You‘re not going to kill me,” she continues, ignoring him completely, “because this is how I work:”
“Why didn’t you meet us?” Dean’s voice was low.
, because his best friend’s time came a little too early and because well, HE’S HERE. Probably just down the road.
He can’t cry. He cannot. Why are there no tears? There’s just this nasty feeling. He can’t explain it. He can’t breathe. Is he having a panic attack?
As if on cue, Jack appears in Castiel’s office with the most sorrowful face he’s ever seen. His eyes well up.
He did live a long, almost-perfect and happy life with Eileen, but the grief he felt for Dean never really went away. He would hold a picture-frame of him and Dean next to the Impala to his chest, while he slept and sobbed against the pillows, Eileen would caress his hair and hold him while she gently kissed his cheek, then he would turn around and cry in her arms. He did stop crying after a while, he focused on the love he felt for Eileen instead, and realised just how happy she made him. He did lose a part of himself when Dean passed away, but that didn’t stop him from enjoying his life to his fullest, even if he missed Dean, and it still hurt a little everyday. He knew Dean would want him to have a happy life, and he did have one.
When Dean pulled away, they gave each other a shy smile.
when it happened, and he was so broken that Cas was about to sacrifice himself. He couldn’t process anything at that moment. There was no time to say anything.
Dean gives him a confused look, his eyebrows furrowed.
“I know”
Castiel just nodded. This is the first person he fell in love with, of course he was afraid, so afraid of the love being unrequited. It almost felt more comfortable being away rather than facing Dean, in all of his more-than-a-century old life, Castiel still found it hard on how to deal with his feelings, partly because he was programmed to be an emotionless soldier and because everything he felt towards Dean was new to him, he was full of love, and he made him so happy but at the same he was afraid.  Every moment he had with Dean made sense now, even the fights they had. He loved Dean so much, it was painful.
There was now a long pause, Dean looked at his feet and took a deep breath through his nose. It looked like he was thinking.
“I’m great Sam, more than great.” He says as he hugs Sam tighter.
He is surely happy running heaven with Jack, but his heart isn’t quiet in it. He feels something is missing, he
Dean gave him a sad smile. He then looked around, looking at everything Jack created with Castiel.
“Cas, you should go meet him, I can look over heaven for a bit.”
At least he’s here now, isn’t he? Jack is so excited to meet him. Cas on the other hand, may be excited too but is shitting bricks at the same time. He isn’t sure of what he’s going to say to Dean and is even more worried about what Dean might say to him.
But there’s another feeling overpowering his happiness which he’s supposed to feel meeting Bobby. There’s a itch in his heart, because he feels something is missing.
Dean took a deep breath through his nose. He just stared at Cas, he didn’t have any expressions on his face. It was hard to understand what was going through his mind.
They both go towards the Impala, holding each others’ hands. Once Dean starts driving, Castiel insists on taking a longer route, partly because he wants to show Dean what Jack and him have accomplished together, or because just needed more alone time with Dean. Led Zeppelin is playing in the car,
’ look.
“There was a hunting accident...he didn’t make it, Cas.”
“I wanted to make heaven different from the previous one. For heaven to be worth it, everything you do here has to mean something, right? So once you do all the things you love, however long it takes, once your soul feels at peace, then it fades away, blending in with everything here, the trees, the river, everything. This is how I power this place, with peaceful souls.”
“I never really got the chance to experience some things in life, things that truly made me happy. I hunted all my life, I never even asked myself what was it that
Castiel isn’t sure though. He needs time, just a little more, partly because he doesn’t want to burden Jack right now, or because he’s terrified of dealing with Dean right now.
Castiel is getting anxious thinking about this, and even worse knowing he left Sam and Dean thinking that he’s suffering in the Empty.
They pull up towards an open space, it’s greener than anything Dean’s ever seen. There are pine trees in the back and the sound of water, implying that there’s a river flowing somewhere close. There’s birds chirping.
“No Cas, stop. Tell me the truth.”
Castiel softly smiled. “That’s the point of this heaven, Dean, I want you to start over. Do things you couldn’t do, without the world’s burden on your mind.”
He laughs to himself. This is very dramatic and he loves every second of it.
“Wow,” Dean says, sinking back into his seat. “Who‘d have known I had such a good influence on you? Don‘t tell me you‘ve taken up drinking and gambling, too.” The joke‘s a little bit shaky, but he feels seriously overwhelmed. Because an angel, because
“Back off,” he growls, “and next time, keep that slut of yours in check before she goes off looking for alternatives.”
She rolls her eyes. “Detective, it was an open secret Andrew had
The thistles and weeds cut and tear at his clothes as he carefully approaches the house from the side, gun drawn and trying to stay out of view of the windows. Then he‘s at the front door, pulling out his lock picks. It gives almost instantly and he pulls his gun back from where he shoved it into the waistband of his jeans. Slowly he pushes the door open, only a slit. Moves into the quiet hallway. The floor boards creak slightly under his booted feet and he freezes, listening.
Suddenly he sits up abruptly and climbs out of the bed, pulling on his clothes. Dean protests but Cas ignores him and ruffles through their papers instead.
He waits till they are safe in the car and have put a sufficient distance between themselves and the bar.
“A classmate of yours?” he asks, sympathetic.
“What is it?” Dean asks, softly, because the look in Cas‘s eyes – kind of spooking him out, actually, the way the angel seems utterly focused on this crappy drawing.
“Whoa, Sammy,” Dean cuts him off, “
“Maybe you should call your brother,” he says. “Or Bobby Singer. They might know something.”
The – thing, whatever he is – stops. His eyes shine almost unnaturally bright in the moonlight as he eyes Dean warily.
“No,” Cas says, his voice rough, and tired, and just this side of not breaking. Dean squints and really, he can see his edges blurring, the color of his trench and suit, his skin and hair and of his eyes wash out, fade ever so subtly.
“For who?”
, queen of Libya. Mostly I used the depiction as given in
“There.”
The man turns without haste. “Dean,” he says, and his voice, deep and gravelly and calm, sends shivers down Dean‘s spine. “You‘re awake.”
“Silver dagger through the heart,” Bobby finally says begrugdingly. “If you believe the talk that‘s been going around, that‘s what might do the trick.” Dean motions to Cas to write it down, silently mouthing the words to him.
“Oh, really,” she snarls, laughing sharply. With a movement so swift he barely even realizes she‘s backed him up against the kitchen counters. Instinct makes him jerk up his arms as she goes for his throat, her teeth lengthening before his eyes.
Cas‘s eyes widen slightly, but his voice is calm when he answers after a moment. “Apparently I have.”
He enunciates every word in his mind as clearly as he can, forces himself to stare this cold hard truth right in the face. And can feel himself harden inside, something in his chest pulling together and thickening until there‘s nothing left but darkness, knotted and unyielding. Until every mushy, cheesy chick-flick thought has been burned out of his mind and heart and he‘s just a soldier with nothing left to fight for.
Dean stops dead in his tracks. Cas still walks a couple of steps further before he notices and turns around to face Dean.
With one swift step Dean is above him, one knee on his chest, one hand twisted into the collar of his shirt, the other one raised menacingly.
“She would have killed him otherwise.” Cas looks at him with this oh so familiar wide-eyed stare. “I don‘t want to hurt you,” he says, and underneath his usual calm there‘s something else, desperation and begging and disbelief.
The girl smiles at him, a little bit wickedly, Dean thinks, and pulls something out from under the pillow next to her. “You know,” she says to Cas, pointedly ignoring Dean, “I actually wasn‘t gonna give this away, cause it‘s, like, the last thing I have that reminds me of her? But you‘re cool, so, here.” She hands him a notebook, the cover faded and worn-out, sheets of paper sticking out in weird angles. “It‘s Megan‘s diary. Maybe you can find something in there, because, if she was really murdered, then I hope you get that dick and make him pay.”
It takes Cas another moment of intense staring right into Dean‘s soul, then he says, “You‘ve never been there.” A statement more than a question.
“Oh,” she says, slumping slightly. “I‘m sorry.” With a sigh she runs her hand through her hair. “It‘s just, all of his relatives and, oh God, his
“What does it look like?” Dean snaps from his position on the floor, where he‘s checking for any remaining clothes under the bed. “We‘re getting outta here now.”
He awakes alone, velvety blackness around him. Rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand he sits up, trying to shake the last remnants of sleep from his consciousness.
“Not without you.”
? I mean, he literally couldn‘t hurt a fly. I have to admit, in some way I can see why his parents think it‘s my fault.”
He can already see Cas frown and open his mouth to reply, when–
“Right,” he says, “you also know a way to trap her?”
Dean stares at him, at those stolen blue eyes returning his gaze with calm resignation and suddenly he has his answers.
The ringing of the door bell is a faint tinkle far away inside the house. They listen to its echo fading away, the woods around them holding their breath with them. One heartbeat and an eternity later there are quiet steps towards the door, and then it swings inward and the sheriff‘s secretary is standing in front of them.
“No reason for me to spare you. There‘s nothing you‘ve given me.”
“I am,” Cas says, and it might just be Dean imagining things, but he thinks he can hear something like relief in his voice.
And that‘s his last coherent thought for the next hour.
Then he realizes it‘s fear and that makes him talk, because he is Dean Winchester after all.
Now as he‘s standing in that dingy restroom he suddenly realizes why Sam keeps shooting him these worried glances, why Bobby offered him a place to stay and a job, why all the women he took back to his motel recently tried to hold him tight and comfort him.
Because Cas is really here and he‘s finally able to breathe again.
“Shut up,” Cas murmurs feebly, but she just smiles.
“You knew that guy?”
“Gentlemen don‘t kiss and tell, Sammy.”
He takes a long swig and takes out the file he got from the Sheriff. He leafs through the pictures until he finds the one of the first victim and slides it over the table.
“They don‘t even want to fight it,” she says, “because if they would, what I gave them would vanish with me.”
“We found these in the victims‘ personal belongings.”
“Should be empty,” he says. “The sheriff said he didn‘t have any close family around, no wife, no kids. But you never know, there‘s all kinds of scum who could‘ve settled into that house once they heard it‘s empty.” He squints, searching for hints of movement, of anyone inside the house. “You sure you wanna come?”
So much that his voice is even, almost tranquil when he answers. “Got no other name for you.”
Dean sighs and shoots the deserted bed a longing look.
Sometimes when Dean feels he‘s getting off track, when he starts pondering and thinking about ‘what if‘s and ‘maybe‘s, when he‘s basically becoming all sappy feelings like Sam wants him to be this is what he tells himself.
A frown flickers over Cas‘s face. Eyes blinking, forehead scrunching up, just for the fraction of a second.
The diner down the street makes an amazing cherry pie, flaky and juicy and just about melting in Dean‘s mouth. So he digs in greedily, and it makes not staring at Cas a little bit easier.
His searching hands only find empty air next to him and when he turns on the bedside lamp, there‘s no one except him in the golden circle of light.
When he‘s done with Cas‘s hand he sits next to him on the bed. He doesn‘t trust his voice too much right now, so he just gently cups Cas‘s face, slightly angling his head to allow him better view of the cut on his lip. Softly he brushes his thumb over the chafed skin there, his mind going blank when he feels Cas shudder under his hands.
Their gazes lock for a long moment, and then he slowly bends forward, pressing a soft kiss to the other one‘s forehead. He can feel him go limp in his hands, lean into his touch and he can feel something inside of him spring up in return. Powerful, surging, a feeling of protectiveness he hasn‘t felt in so long, not this strong. Here and now, with this confused being slumped against him he feels a fierce urge to protect this Cas or die trying. And no matter how much it hurts just to touch him, no matter how much the thought of his real Cas, his real angel being dead and gone forever eats at his insides, he won‘t just let this other one go without a fight.
“Evil things don‘t hunt themselves, Sammy. We can‘t all take time off and party.” He knows he‘s being unfair, but he probably made it clear enough that he‘s not in the mood to have this conversation. Not clear enough for his brother, of course.
“Those were demons,” Dean says, his voice rough, from being choked or from what‘s just happened, he doesn‘t care. Cas tilts his head, waiting for his next words, but Dean doesn‘t have any. He has literally no idea what‘s going on here, but he doesn‘t like it.
, and where as long as you talk and cry everything‘s gonna be alright, ‘cause it isn‘t. And most of all you should stop reading things into me not wanting to come to your goddamn party! He was just a friend, alright? Jesus.” He takes a deep breath and if he briefly wonders where the sting inside him came from with those last words, well, he‘s used to not thinking about that one.
dumped
Like a heavy hand exhaustion presses on the base of his skull, the insides of his burning eyes. But he knows he‘ll find no rest, not now. And where? There‘s no way he‘d go back to that bed while the other one is lying in it. Not anymore. The images of last night, of the last days come flooding back to him, yet they feel strangely disconnected. He remembers everything he‘s felt, thought, tasted. He remembers everything he‘s felt for that creature sleeping only feet away from him. But right now, when he listens inside of him, it‘s not there anymore.
They enter the living room and she immediately sinks into an armchair surrounded by flowers Dean thinks might be lilies. As she drops her shoes and draws her legs up under her body he suddenly realizes how fluidly she moves, bending bonelessly, and his skin crawls involuntarily.
. You‘re really alright?”
“Cas,” he manages to croak out, then his voice fails him. Through his blurring vision he can see a shadow approaching and throws himself to the side just fast enough to evade the fist being driven into the wall at exactly the point where his head had been moments ago.
“Cas!” Dean bellows.
Cas tilts his head and stares at Dean over the hood of his baby and Dean drops his keys because somehow, no matter how natural it feels to have Cas back and everything after just a couple of hours, he‘s still not ready for
“What?” Dean fumbles for a reply, then tries a grin. “Thank you, I guess? You neither?”
His features have sharpened, he realizes, and not just because four years have added their fair share of lines around his eyes and mouth. No, he‘s lost weight, and if there wasn‘t a lot of fat on his body to begin with, it‘s all gone now and more, to the point where his body will soon feed off his muscles to sustain itself. But it‘s his eyes that really give him away, sunken deep into their sockets. They are still the same greenish color he remembers, but something inside of them is just missing, and he doesn‘t even know what it is.
“I used you,” he says.
He clears his throat, then clears it again, then picks up a fork to twiddle with. He knows they have to talk about this, but he has this queasy feeling when he thinks of the answers Cas could give him.
This is it. The point where he turns around, begs Cas to stay, on his knees if he has to, and then they will be happy together. The thought, the mere possibility of living a life that‘s not dictated by blood and gore and pain and self-sacrifice makes his head swim, like his whole reason of existence turned upside down. So what if it won‘t be the white picket fence and the 2.5 kids that Dean always dimly imagined at the back of his mind, he doesn‘t care.
“I didn‘t know what it meant at that time,” he growls. Using his low, fucked out “I gave up everything for you”-voice that even back then made sparks run down Dean‘s spine.
Dean doesn‘t mind. In fact, it‘s perfect for their purpose.
“I think I would know if I‘d died again,” he says finally, as matter-of-factly as if he was talking about the weather.
The witch laughs, but there‘s an edge to it that makes Dean‘s hair bristle. “Oh, you really are special. I think this has happened... let me think, once, maybe twice in my whole existence? Two thousand years and I have to wait for an angel-lusting scumbag of a hunter for this. To have one of my children come to my home and oppose me.” Her tone grows cold with her last words, a threat so sharp it chills Dean‘s bones.
The guy has paled visibly, of from pain or fear or both, but Dean has to give him that, he doesn‘t scare easy.
One hour later he‘s still sitting in a dingy faux leather chair in the sheriff‘s office.
The silver knife is on his nightstand, right next to his lighter and a bottle of whiskey. Cas watches him intently as Dean cuts into the soft skin of his forearm, a line of blood welling up dark and dull in the dim light. He washes it away with holy water, and then he gets a piece of cloth Pam gave him a lifetime ago, embroidered with runes that fend off evil, and he uses it to bandage Cas up.
“Alright Cas,” he begins, throwing him a casual glance, “what‘s going on here?”
and he stops.
“Look, Dean, it‘s been three years now. I know you, you know,
, and is frozen into shock at the same time, but it‘s enough.
They don‘t even bother with knocking. Dean already has a credit card out, but when he touches the handle the door swings open without so much as a creak, only to reveal a dusty hall leading to an even dustier living room and a dirty kitchen. Next to a life-sized mirror with cracks in its dull surface is a staircase leading up to the second floor.
“Edward is awesome,” she says, turning pointedly towards Cas, “because his love for Bella is pure and beautiful. But Megan was talking about him, like, really dirty. Like that one time,” her voice lowers to a conspiratorial whisper, Cas and her leaning forward and Dean has to bite back a grin forming at the picture, “she said that–” and then she continues with a story that seems to come right out of some of the worst hardcore SM-bondage porn Dean ever had the not-really-pleasure of witnessing, not even blushing in the process.
“You are,” Dean repeats. “Even if he‘s the one I really wanted to have back, doesn‘t mean I‘m happy about you dying. I know you‘re not him, but I meant what I said. You‘re the last of all people who‘d deserve this.”
But there‘s nothing, just an ordinary, fairly empty house.
Except then he realizes what he‘s actually doing, packing
The mirror above the sink is cracked and blind, yet not enough to hide the sight of Dean’s face as he stands in front of it, leaning heavily on the cool dirty-white porcelain. Drips of water slowly trickle down his chin, over what‘s more of a three-weeks than three-days worth of stubble. Slowly, intentionally he sorts through his memories of the last four years, until he‘s dug out the image of the last time he looked at himself in a mirror this intently. A motel bathroom in Pontiac, Illinois, right after Cas had raised his sorry ass from Hell, staring at the bright red hand-shaped mark on his left shoulder in disbelief.
The other one takes a deep breath. “I only noticed when I realized how much clearer the memories of the past day were than the ones of my supposed time before. The memories I have of what happened during the last two days, those were the only ones that were real.”
“That‘s my angel,” he says as he‘s calmed down, still smiling. “No running off with strange women when you‘re there with me.”
Dean can‘t help himself if the guy seems much more agreeable to him all of a sudden. “I see,” he says, rubbing his chin to disguise his smirk.
“Maybe there‘s just no one who wants to bury him,” Cas answers calmly.
She just smiles. But then there‘s Cas‘s voice next to him, calm despite their situation.
“More hopeful,” Cas says.
“I recognized the house on those pictures. I didn‘t know from where, I just knew–”
His right hand throbs with satisfaction as they leave the bar together.
“I understand there have been three victims so far?”
“Hm?” Dean grunts as he realizes Cas has asked him something.
“It‘s certainly within the realms of possibility,” he replies stiffly.
“Because I‘m not the one you want to save,” Cas states simply.
? What‘s that supposed to mean?”
A click and then there‘s just silence again.
Bobby inhales sharply. “OK, boy, listen up,” he says, urgency in his voice, “you gotta get out of this town. There‘s a Paradise Inn just outside of Beaver, we‘ll be meeting you there.”
“Dean, you know what? You wouldn‘t know denial if it punched you in the face. When you stop behaving like a three-year-old, you should really take some time and think about why you always blow up in my face like this when Cas comes up. You know, as in think about your
Dean looks at Cas, who just sits on the bed, listening intently. He swallows.
Cas stumbles back, almost going down if not for the bar that supports him as he crashes against it.
“You‘re still here,” Dean starts eventually. “Does that mean–”
Cas just raises an eyebrow.
“Ain‘t got no feelings I wanna think about,” Dean replies brusquely. He can feel Sam open his mouth for an answer, but cuts him off shortly.
“Because you’re dead!” Dean yells. The words catch in his throat, burn his tongue.
But he hasn‘t really loved the person sleeping in front of him, has he? This being, it looks like Cas, it talks like Cas, it probably even thinks like him, but it isn‘t him, is it? And is this important? If they both are one and the same, is there even a difference between them? Should he not love this Cas like he has the loved the other one?
“You stupid bitch,” Dean growls, red hot rage boiling through his blood, “We‘ll see who‘s in charge here when I gut you so fast–”
“You think?”
“Doesn‘t look like someone who‘d die of a heart attack,” Dean says brusquely, trying to play down his strange behavior.
Later Dean doesn‘t remember how he gets out of the house. Just that suddenly, there is grass under his feet and the indistinct gray of dawn dulling the world around him, flattening everything to 2D as insomnia presses down on his stomach, curling behind his forehead. The cool smooth surface of the Impala under his hands, comfortingly familiar through thousands of days, thousands of times, suddenly more real than anything else he‘s gone through these last days. Heavily he supports his elbows on its roof, head buried in his hands, inhaling, exhaling, trying to calm down. In the mirror of its well-cared for black sheer he can catch a glimpse of his own reflection. Man, he feels like crap. But damn, he has every right to. Because for the third time now, the fucking third time, he‘s lost Cas, and for good this time, as it seems, and it‘s just too much.
And now Cas is lying next to him, his dark hair mussed and his chest slowly rising and sinking in the rhythm of his even breathing.
Then he downs it in one swallow.
“She said she created them. I suppose that‘s also the reason the man in the bar could hurt me while they couldn‘t.” Cas falters, his voice hesitant. Grasping for pieces of a puzzle whose finished picture Dean doesn‘t want to see and still Cas continues to talk, struggling against Dean‘s silence.
He can feel Cas‘s confused gaze bore into his back, but focuses intently on the bag before him, adjusting and repacking like an overbearing mother packing her son‘s first suitcase for summer camp.
The shields drop almost visible.
“It‘s late already. We should continue our research.”
“Yeah,” he says roughly, trying unsuccessfully to keep his good mood out of his voice, “yeah, I‘m good.” He smiles at the angel, in a way he hasn‘t smiled in so long, the crinkling of skin around his eyes feels weird, unfamiliar. And Cas– Cas actually smiles back, an almost incomprehensible raising of the corners of his mouth, a hint of amusement sparkling in his eyes. Maybe Dean is reading too much into this, but he even seems to be sitting more relaxed, leaning against the leather cushion in his back, his usually rigid posture just the slightest bit less stiff.
“I don‘t really want to talk about it.”
The coroner gives him an odd look. “Oh, you never know.” He dismisses Dean‘s statement with a shrug. “I‘ve seen guys drop dead from heart failure that weren‘t even your age. And he was a heavy drinker,” he adds, turning towards the next drawer. Which is good, because he doesn‘t see Dean wince at his words.
As fast as he can he throws some clothes on, gets his keys and jacket and marches out of the door, careful to not pay too much attention to Cas, who is following him with a bewildered expression on his face.
“I don‘t understand why you keep on insisting I‘m not me,” Cas – no, the creature – interrupts him, the first signs of impatience creeping into his voice.
But somehow he‘s always successfully banned any thought of Cas in that way from his mind, and now he wonders how he ever could‘ve been that dense. Now that the angel‘s actually here, Dean‘s body apparently has developed a will of its own, and it craves Cas so bad it hurts. Now he can‘t think of him in any other way.
“Cas–” he starts, then clears his voice. “Cas.”
“You‘re kidding, right?”
His voice is rising, and he knows it‘s too sharp, too harsh, but he can‘t help it. Cas‘s lips part slightly as if to speak, then he falters, the expression on his face shifting to one of subtle discomfort.
The coroner clears his throat, which sets off another coughing fit, and Dean realizes he‘s been staring at the corpse for a good two minutes. Straightening himself he shoves the cot back, making the cabinet door fall shut with a loud bang that sends the good doctor flinching.
“Probably not,” Dean shrugs. “But we want to be sure.”
Every time he looks up and sees those familiar blue eyes focused intently on him, the slightly knitted dark brows and the mussed up black hair... the first time the piece of pie he‘s been chewing on drops right out of his mouth. But at some point he‘s eaten all the food and drunk all the coffee he can and Cas is still looking at him, waiting patiently.
“Sorry to interrupt, we won‘t take much of your time,” Dean says, gesturing towards the cleaning utensils.
“Yeah, sure,” Miller says, nodding earnestly. “I totally understand. Thanks for not making a big deal out of it, you know, not arresting those guys and so on.”
“You?” The barkeeper from the night before eyes them warily through the barely opened door, his brows furrowing at the sight of their suits. “Didn‘t think I‘d see you here again anytime soon.”
“Nothing,” he mumbles, taking a step backwards.
Sniffing heartily he gets up, roughly wipes his sleeve over his eyes, then over the Impala‘s roof and gets in the car. In the rearview mirror he can see his face, all puffy and red-eyed, but nothing he can do against that now. As he shifts into gear and slowly rolls out of the cracked driveway he doesn‘t look back, his mind already set on the road.
“Cas–” Dean starts, but is interrupted by a loud crash as Cas stands up so fast, his chair tips over and scatters over the floor.
The other looks up, and Dean can see his tiredness mirrored in his eyes. More resigned acceptance than defeat, really, even if Dean doesn‘t want to think about what it is Cas has accepted here.
Sam still looks not convinced, so he shoots him a wicked grin. “At least I got laid this time.”
“Yeah, you did,” he starts, then falters. The words are on the tip of his tongue, but he can‘t get himself to say them. Instead he clenches his fists under the table, sets his jaw tight.
“Yeah, sure” Dean grins, because he doesn‘t know with the real feds, but it is with him.
Hope, fear, worry, hope, love, hope. Despair.
“Stay where you are!” Dean snaps. His whole body is shaking but the gun in his hands is still. 30 years of training have seen to that. “Stay where you are or so God help me, I‘ll blow your brains out right here, right now.”
“There.”
“Cas,” Dean says slowly, “there are no demons anymore. After Lucifer died, they were all sent back to Hell. Don‘t tell me you‘ve forgotten that, too.”
It‘s already become dark when he exits the building.
“I don‘t want any, thanks.”
Dean looks up to him, eyes burning with fatigue. Cas is sitting right in front of him, the cold neon light above him chiseling every single one of his features with painful clarity, and the longing hits Dean like a punch in the gut. His brain is screaming at him that this is not Castiel, but his eyes, they see Cas, and his ears hear his voice.
It‘s been so long, he‘s almost forgotten how easy it is, being with someone whose words don‘t contain any hidden meanings aimed to show him things he doesn‘t want to see. Whose words are just that; words.
“I see,” she says, turning around and motioning them inside, “come in, please.”
“To look for her,” Cas clarifies eventually, when Dean doesn‘t continue, instead just stares at him like a rabbit in the headlights.
FBI,” Dean says, flashing his ID, “I‘m Agent Grech and this is my partner, Agent Baker.” He nods towards Cas, who masters the badge flipping much better than the last time. “Could we have a minute of your time, Sir?”
Cas‘s smile deepens, making Dean realize that he has been gaping at him for the last five minutes. With a wink he shoves another forkful of pie in his mouth.
“That‘s enough,” Dean snaps, stepping out into the kitchen. His voice is rough with rage. At the witch, but also at himself for just standing there and eavesdropping like a fucking peeping tom while she stomped all over Cas‘s feelings. He can feel Cas‘s gaze on him, disbelieving searing blue, but he keeps his eyes on the woman, gun pointing at her head.
. You‘re my food, Dean, that‘s all. You‘re even less to me than he is so don‘t you get snarky with me.”
“Speaking of,” Dean leans forward, pointing his spoon at the angel, “why him again? Why not just take another poor guy‘s meat suit?”
“You‘re sure that‘s it?” he asks doubtfully.
“No,” says Cas, lowering his gaze to his books again. Just this one word, but it‘s enough for Dean to feel like the world‘s biggest asshole. Cursing under his breath he gets up, closing the distance between them and kneeling on the mattress in front of the other man.
“Cas,” he murmurs softly.
One breathless moment, eyes locked together and Dean can feel something inside of him settle, come to peace, like the silence of dawn after a stormy night. Like mud sinking back to the bottom of a lake after being troubled, and that might not be the best way to describe how he feels but the fact that he‘s thinking in metaphors should be enough to explain.
“Yeah,” Dean drawls, playing for time. Because telling Bobby and Sam about the demons would mean telling them about Cas being back and he‘s not sure he‘s ready for that one yet. Not until he hasn‘t figured some things out for himself.
“Yeah, they got this thing,” Dean says with a dismissive wave of his bottle. “All those hunters and people having this great love-fest at– you know, each spring. Lots of food and alcohol and dancing merrily around a bonfire.” He grins cockily, yet his poor attempt at lightening the mood is entirely lost on the angel, who just frowns at him.
They are walking down the gravel path through the front garden when Cas starts to speak.
“Because I wouldn‘t.”
Dean takes another sip of his beer and thinks back to the costumes, the dirty old house and the demons attacking them.
“Thanks,” he says, then waits till she‘s out of earshot before he turns back to Cas. There is one issue left, and even though he‘s dreading the answers he might get, there‘s no way around it.
“Nothing but these,” Cas answers. “Apparently he had a girlfriend that worked as a nurse and was moonlighting as a–,” he gives the garment an inquisitive look, then looks up at Dean with a pleased expression at having sorted this one out, “as a maid I think.”
“Have you found anything?” Cas asks, hesitation slowing his words even more than usual. Low, his voice, raspy velvet on Dean‘s skin, yet it reaches down his guts and pulls them right up his throat. He swallows, once, twice, then answers gruffly, “No luck yet. You?”
“I walk into people‘s dreams and I dig up the thing they want most, even if they don‘t know it themselves.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “What do you think I‘m doing here? Getting you, idiot.”
“Yeah, but giving people heart attacks still doesn‘t fit their usual MO. Either they‘ve totally changed battle plans or there‘s still something else running around killing people off.” He grimaces, because honestly neither thought holds much appeal for him.
, he thinks wearily. When only looking at him hurts so much, he can‘t bring himself to call him by Cas‘s name. But then again, there really is no other name for him. Stuck either way.
“You don‘t say.”
When he wakes again the toxic green letters of the alarm say 4.04 a.m. and the first thing he feels is confusion. Then he realizes something has woken him.
The woman‘s laughter follows him as he walks out of her house. He doesn‘t look back to see if Cas is following him.
“I got the data from the files, thank you,” Dean half-lies (he did leaf through them on the way down here) and takes the time to roll his eyes before he looks at the corpse laid out in front of him. The guy‘s body is massive with muscle from a lifetime of everyday physical labor, the beginnings of a beer belly visible under the white sheet billowing around his hips. His face shows the burnt, wrinkled skin telling of long hours outside, and the odd burst veins of someone drinking too much for his own good. Dean has seen the beginnings of these veins on his own face, and in his own bloodshot eyes after a night of drinking himself into oblivion. To look into this face, pale under its reddish tan, feels like looking into his own future, and it‘s creeping him out more than the familiar Y-shaped scar, lined by irregular dark threads, that cuts into the man‘s torso.
made for the story.
“So,” he says once he‘s swallowed, “what do you wanna do today? You know, Monument Valley‘s actually just around the corner. You up for some sight-seeing? Drive around a bit, grab some burgers, maybe shack up in a nice cozy motel?” He grins at Cas broadly.
“It just doesn‘t add up,” Dean groans, frustration seeping into his voice, “this just doesn‘t seem like a demon-gig to me. If we hadn‘t met those three I‘d be thinking Shtrigas now, or maybe even a Reaper, but not fucking possession.”
“I had nothing to do with it!“ she bursts out. “I know we had that fight, but why does everyone think– It was a heart attack, for God‘s sake.”
“Yeah, right,” the sheriff drawls, eyes still focused on Dean‘s ID while he idly plucks at his mustache. “So, those bodies.”
For a moment the tension seems to be rising, but then he hears the deep gravel of Cas‘s voice. “I told her that I was sorry, but that I was already there with someone else and didn‘t want to leave and engage in sexual activities with her,” he says in complete seriousness. Dean can‘t help himself, it‘s not even that funny, but he bursts out laughing.
Dean barely refrains from throwing a pointed look out the window, where ragged clouds obscure a gray sky laden with rain. “I‘d still like to see the files and the bodies, just to be sure,” he repeats instead. He wouldn‘t be surprised if he‘d sprout feathers and a beak anytime soon, given how he‘s been repeating the same three sentences over and over again. The conversation has been running in circles for the better part of the last half-hour, spiked with far too many “Uhm‘s” and “Yeah‘s” and “Nothing suspicious here, really” and he‘s getting tired of it.
Enough self-pity for one day. There‘s an angel to be inebriated.
He closes the book and starts to move towards Dean.
“What‘s it look like,” he snaps, irritated. “Cooking dinner? I‘m demon-proofing this stupid room!”
He takes a deep breath, digging his fingers into the mattress as deeply as he manages. Then he jumps up and flees into the bathroom.
It only takes Dean a couple of hours more to reach his destination. He would‘ve been there even earlier if the road leading into the town hadn‘t been left to rot for the last 30 years. Swearing under his breath he steers his baby around the abundance of potholes making up what seems to be called a street around here. There‘s a particularly nasty one right next to the city sign, green and scratched and half-hidden behind a bush.
“No,” Cas answers, “they were real demons. Weak ones, though.”
“I would die, I think,” Cas says calmly, but Dean more feels than hears the slight wavering to his tone. “There‘s no other possibility.”
Biting his lip Dean crouches down in front of the fake angel, reaching out until his fingertips rest lightly on the other‘s knee.
“Gotta take a leak,” he mutters, and heads towards the men‘s rooms. Away from Cas with his oh so wise and oh so clueless eyes and with his words that rip right through his chest and tear down all the defenses he‘s worked so hard on building for the last three years.
“Good.”
Silence.
As he pushes through the door to the nearest bar Dean winces at the masses of gathered rednecks there. But there is no way he can wrap his head around the whole “mysterious deaths-demons-Cas is back”-situation without a couple of beers, so he steers Cas to a relatively secluded booth and gets them two bottles of lager. And a double whiskey for himself.
Dean takes a long swig of his beer, his eyes not leaving the red-golden line of the horizon. Sam begins to fidget at his prolonged silence, hardly able to reign in his curiosity. Dean grins.
The angel is sleeping. Somewhere in the far region of his brain he‘s a little bit worried about that, but decides to blame the last hours for it. He himself is pretty exhausted, too, if he‘s honest. Still, sleep is far from his mind.
“You really think he was murdered?” she asks as they all get up, one eyebrow raised in skepticism.
It‘s a young man, tall and lean. Dean guesses he‘s kind of attractive, in a brooding, artsy kind of way, with a shock of dark hair falling into his clean-cut face.
For a moment Dean is at loss for words.
Even as darkness envelops him, the iridescent blue of Cas‘s eyes stays with his every heartbeat.
“You don‘t think she died of a heart attack?”
“No,” the woman hisses. “As usual you completely forget who‘s in charge here. It‘s me, Dean. Me, not you. I set the terms here, not you. And I tell you, I‘m not passing on this, on you. You will die, and he will, too!”
“Our resident bohemian,” the doc explains. “Art teacher at the local high school, healthiest lifestyle I‘ve ever set eyes on in my entire career. Non-drinker, non-smoker, vegetarian, ran one hour every morning.” He huffs, his hands subconsciously wandering to the pack of cigarettes in the breast pocket of his lab coat.
The kitchen is brightly lit, warm light spilling out onto the parquet. He stops when the tips of his boots are only a eyelash‘s width away from crossing over into it. The clatter of cups and plates drift to his ear. Still the silence around him is so strong, he can hear his heart skip a beat at the sound of Cas‘s voice.
“I... see,” he says slowly and Dean has to resist the sudden urge to hit his head on the steering wheel.
“Dean, Dean,” she shakes her head condescendingly, “I already told you, you‘re not going to kill me.”
Cas gives him another suspicious glance, then holds up the pieces of clothing he‘s been carrying. It speaks volumes of Dean‘s mental state that he hasn‘t noticed those yet.
“You gotta be kidding me,” he mutters, then louder: “So Megan had the hots for this Vampire-guy, doesn‘t seem too uncommon among teenage girls today, right?” He tries to placate her with another smirk, but clearly he‘s gambled away all good-will she had for him.
There are voices coming from the kitchen. They are quiet, hardly more than a mumble. A woman, and he‘s pretty sure it‘s that damn witch. And Cas.
, he thinks darkly. And then he really flinches as cool fingers touch his shoulder, running down the skin of his biceps.
The other one‘s eyes widen, a kaleidoscope of emotion rushing through them.
“Are you feeling well?” Cas asks him, frowning, and Dean realizes he‘s been lying in bed motionlessly, staring at the angel for the better part of the last ten minutes.
“I think that would be acceptable,” Cas answers gravely, a blush spreading over his cheeks. Dean grins, steals another kiss and accelerates.
With a roar the demon comes back to his feet, stumbling towards Dean and into him, and then he‘s being thrust across the room, vainly trying to get enough grip to push back against this mass of human flesh pouncing on him. For a short moment he feels the wall against his back again, giving him almost enough leverage but then it breaks away under their combined weight and they tumble into the hall in a heap of tangled arms and legs. Before Dean has even time to gather what happened the demon is upon him, his hands closing around Dean‘s neck in a vice-like grip. Dean claws at the other‘s fingers frantically, trying to pry them from his throat to finish his exorcism, but they won‘t move, won‘t budge. And then dazzling specks of light appear before his blurring eyes, and now he only tries to push the man‘s wrists back far enough to get some air before he faints and all is over. But the other guy is a freaking demon and freakishly strong and even though Dean tries every trick in the book, even knees the guy in the balls a couple of times, he can‘t loosen his steel-like grip, and his vision is going darker by the second. His lungs are burning, his muscles weakening, he can hear his heartbeat thud in his ear, the rush of his blood droning out every other sound. His universe has shrunken, contracted to the pain around his neck and in his lungs, and he knows it will be anytime now, anytime that he‘ll loose consciousness, and even though he fights with everything he‘s worth it‘s not doing anything.
As he‘s done, he gets back up on his feet and stretches, his spine popping audibly after his crouched position. He can‘t help but wince as the movement reminds him of all the cuts and bruises he got from the fight.
“Why did you keep me from asking about his eyes? What if he was possessed?”
“I‘m sorry, Dean,” Cas says, “but I won‘t be coming with you.”
“So,” he says, sliding back into his seat and handing Cas his beer, “you got any idea what‘s going on here?”
“I‘m done upstairs,” Cas says, frowning when Dean grins at him like a nine-year-old on Christmas Eve.
“Oh, but there is,” the witch answers lightly.
“Cas–” he starts, bewildered, but then the woman continues, unfazed by their exchange.
The coroner, a haggard, middle-aged guy with nicotine-stained fingers and a bad case of smoker‘s cough, nods while he pulls open one of the morgue’s refrigerator drawers.
“Anyways,” he continues, handing Dean a couple of papers, “here are copies of the autopsy reports. Let‘s see if you can make more of them than I could.”
“Research?” Cas echoes, “for what? From all you‘ve told me so far we don‘t even know how these people were killed.”
“Those demons are all exorcised or dead,” Cas answers.
Maybe she wasn‘t.
Dean just shakes his head, and then the rusty taste of copper floods his mouth as Cas runs his fingers over the inside of his arm one last time and he bites down on his lip hard enough to draw blood.
“Sorry to bother you, miss,” he says, “but there seems to have been a mixup with some of the paperwork. The sheriff sent us here, meant you could maybe help us clarify some things.”
By the time they reach the Impala, Dean‘s mood has pretty much lightened again. Cas is moving next to him, it‘s a beautiful day, there‘s a hunt waiting for him– Life‘s good and he‘s almost whistling as he opens the trunk and re-packs his duffel bag, stuffing guns and rock salt and knives into it.
“Well,” the guys answers hesitantly, “he was bragging about this hot chick he was seeing, but I gotta admit, we thought he was just making stuff up. Wouldn‘t have been the first time. And he wasn‘t exactly the kind of guy that could‘ve scored with a woman like that. He had this-” the guy falters, searching for words to put it delicately, then just spills it. “Well, he was really into porn.”
“He‘s just one man. You wouldn‘t even notice the difference.”
Sam rolls his eyes at him. “Yeah, right. Just– what happened? Honestly I didn‘t expect to ever see you again, or at the least be a total mess, and now you come back from that hunt and you‘re–,” he shakes his head in amazement, “well, you seem
Dean shrugs, inwardly cursing at angelic intuition. “I guess,” he says as casually as possible.
He feels like crap, like waking up from a bender gone horribly wrong, and he doesn‘t even know why. Maybe because he overslept, or maybe because he was dreaming of Cas for the whole rest of the night. Not so much dreaming as remembering actually, a slide show of ”The Prophecy” flickering through his mind. Images so strong, they stay with him even now as the sun burns red-hot through the skin of his fingers and right into his retinas.
He’s looking around taking in the fresh air. “Well, at least I made it to heaven.”
Dean held Castiel’s hand as he got up. “Wow, God’s dying to meet me, that’s interesting.”
Castiel took a deep breath.
Bobby, Jo, Ellen, Charlie, even Eileen, among a few more people they love, they’re all sitting together in a circle, telling jokes, singing songs, drinking beer with a bonfire in between them. Sam and Dean look at each other and smile. They take a breath and they walk towards their loved ones, alongside Jack and Castiel.
Dean and Castiel are sitting together on the couch, Dean’s arms are around Castiel’s shoulders, Dean insisted on watching Before Sunrise. He obviously didn’t concentrate on the movie in the beginning and kept kissing Castiel’s cheeks. Castiel mostly blushed and gave him shy smiles because this was all so new to him, but he loved every second of it. But they did focus on the movie after a few kisses because they started to find it interesting.
“Sam...there’s so many things I want to say, I’ll make it up to you, I’m sorry.”
Dean makes the first move. He starts walking towards Cas slowly, after four steps, his pace gets faster. He just wants to hug Cas. He
Pretending to be happy, he asked Bobby if he Jack did this all by himself, to which Bobby replied. “Well, Cas helped.”
“Cas...you’re here.”
Castiel gives him a shy smile while Dean says, “Bitch.”
Dean looked like he was thinking hard about something, until he finally blurted out, “I wanna go to the beach, and swim naked.”
A few months have passed by. Dean’s done a lot of things he couldn’t do on earth, but the first thing he did was go to a beach, and swim naked. His relationship with Castiel progressed. They lived together, even Miracle was here. They learned how to cook, suprisingly, Castiel was the messy one while Dean was a pro-chef.
“Yeah, about that…” Dean paused.
Dean just looked at him.
“I know, Dean.”
“Hello, Dean.” Dean turns around to see Jack.
But Cas has a sorrowful look on his face. He doesn’t know how to apologize to Dean about why he didn’t meet Dean.
Castiel aggressively shakes his head. “Jack...I-“
Castiel gave him a sorrowful look. He felt pain for him.
“Cas- I, I don’t want to fight, I’m tired of fighting. I just wanted the truth from you. Of course I really wish you met me...but, I don’t know man, whatever.”
. It’s because he isn’t sure if he can go back and figure out his relationship with Dean by leaving Jack all alone in heaven. What if he messes up right? He is technically still three years old, he’s going to need a little assistance.
“Jerk.” Sam says.
But God, Dean didn’t even get time to breathe let alone say a word. There were too many things happening. Castiel confessed after TWELVE years, they were both about to die, things were happening too quick, there is not a right reaction to this situation. What was Dean supposed to react to even?
“I’m sorry Dean. I really am. I know there’s no forgiveness for this, I just-“
“There was no other way, Dean. Billie was about to kill us both and I couldn’t let that happen.” Castiel said with a sorrowful look on his face.
While driving, he’s thinking about Castiel’s confession. He was shocked
After a week, Dean decided he didn’t want to disappoint Cas, and that he was going to try to be happy, for himself, for Sammy and for Cas. And it did work, for quite a bit, until he died on a hunt just three weeks later.
It took Sam only seconds, he looks at their hands and lets out a sigh filled with laughter as he shakes his head. “Damn it, finally.” He says as he rolls his eyes. He’s always known in the back of his head, that Dean and Castiel could be so much more, but as established before, they didn’t get the time to before, and he was devastated when Dean told him about the confession, and the Empty deal.
He sees Bobby. His ideal father figure, whom he wholeheartedly loves. He’s comfortable right now, but not quiet happy.
As if on cue, he sees Baby. Without wasting any time, he says his goodbyes to Bobby and heads towards his Baby. He sits inside and smiles at the scent of of her, despite having kept monsters in the backseat, it still smells comforting, then he remembers, maybe this Baby never had monsters in the backseat.
He feels horrible about letting Sam and Dean mourn him. But, if, (
He gets out of the Impala, looking around the place, it isn’t the same as it was on Earth, but the barn is completely the same. He walks towards it slowly. He walks inside and looks around, it’s dirty and worn down, the same way it was on earth.
“We’ll stay in the car for a while, you go meet him first.” Castiel insists.
“I know, Sam and I didn’t give Chuck his ending. I know we couldn’t kill each other, I know I loved Sam too much for that, and what I had with him was real, because everytime something went wrong-“ Dean laughed lightly and shook his head, “-like the world’s end, we always pulled through, we always won, everything Chuck threw our way, we dodged it. We saved the world.” He smiled.
While driving, he sees a torn down barn. It took seconds for the realization to hit.
Dean laughed lightly and shook his head. “Yeah…”
Dean furrowed his eyebrows and parted his lips as he moved his head ahead from the barn’s wall.
It took a lot of time, and a lot of undoings, but they finally did it. Jack knows that once it’s their time, Sam and Dean will go to a place which they deserve, where they’re meant to be. They’ve struggled so much, beyond comprehension, they deserve peace. Jack of course, wants to be with them,
Dean’s face was soft, but his eye-brows are now furrowed a bit. He has a lightly angry look on his face. He’s been here all this time? He was in so much pain over losing Cas, so was Sam. Why didn’t he meet him?
When they pull away, Dean says. “Jack- about the things I said back when- you know, please know I  didn’t mean any of them. You’re family. You always have been.”
Castiel, in centuries of his existence, hasn’t fallen in love, he wasn’t programmed to fall in love,
He knew Dean was going to come here when he died, but as it has been established before, his thoughts and feelings towards Dean always get processed very slowly. It’s like his brain stops functioning when it comes to Dean. He’s so in love with him, it hurts and makes him lose braincells too.
Dean pulled away, just a little, and he pressed his forehead up against Cas’. His eyes closed. Castiel caressed Dean’s back lovingly, with his eyes closed. Dean now held the side of Castiel’s neck, his fingers gently stroking his jaw.
“I just feel like...the grief and the pain in my life overpowered the love...and I just...didn’t focus on that part of my life. Damn it Cas...I don’t know how else to say this. This is new for me. And it took me so long to realise, I wish I had the time to think about it...I’m sorry.” The silent tears were not stopping at that point, they were happy tears, but Dean also felt pain at the same time because he wished he had done this when he was alive.
Dean smiled. “Oh yeah, there he is.” He said as he looked back at the Impala. Sam looked at it as well, following Dean’s gaze, curious to know what he was talking about.
After defeating Chuck, He told Sam about the confession, Sam was heartbroken for him. He held Dean for so long while Dean sobbed. He had to hide the Impala’s keys and Dean’s credit cards so he wouldn’t go buy another dozen bottles of alcohol. They both mourned Cas, but Dean was at his worst.
”Cas.” Dean exhales. He just looks into his eyes. They stay that way for god knows how long, just staring at each other, taking in their beauty. Dean always found Castiel so beautiful.
Dean walks with Castiel, curious to see where he’s taking him. They walk towards the pine trees and start walking towards the sound of the water. In a matter of 20 minutes they’ve reached the edge of a cliff, where there’s a bench. Dean’s eyes are wide open and his lips parted, taking in the breathtaking view and breathing in the fresh air. There’s snow-clad mountains, the bluest lake he’s ever seen, and he can even see tiny houses, he cannot wait to see where he’s going to live. Castiel is looking at Dean’s face, because to him, that’s the most breathtaking view for him.
Castiel is just staring at Jack.
Fuck.
Castiel is looking at Jack, with a proud smile as well. Jack is where he was meant to be all along, Kelly Kline would’ve been proud. But what now?
He gives Bobby a shy smile, trying his best not to show him that he’s freaking out. He didn’t want to upset Bobby because he seemed so happy to see him, he just needed to see Castiel first.
“You’re beautiful, Dean.” said Castiel.
He doesn’t ask Bobby where Cas is, for some reason his heart is drawn towards some place, it’s like a magnetic pull. He cannot explain it. He just knows he has to be somewhere.
Castiel is having a war in his head over Dean’s reaction to his confession, he knows Dean loves him, but is it  romantic? Dean could’ve said something right?
Sam pulls away and nods, he looks at him with an admirable expression. He missed his best friend. He mourned him. He was really confused as to why he didn’t meet him if he was out of the Empty, but he knew all the questions he had would be answered soon, so he didn’t want to have an argument right now, he didn’t want to re-live the pain. He just wanted to be grateful that Castiel is right here, and he’s okay, and that’s all that mattered to him.
something is missing.
It’s only been a while since he last saw Castiel, however, it felt like a painful decade.
Castiel laughed. “And you shall.”
Dean widens his eyes as his lips part. He then smiles.
He was running out of time. Well, there is a downside to this time difference after all.
“Well...about that. You won’t be here forever.” Jack says.
“There were too many things happening at the same time when you told me that. There were so many things I wanted to say, but I couldn’t process anything at that moment. and when it clicked, that you were about to sacrifice yourself, for me, I was numb, man, and before I had the chance to stop you, you were just...just gone.” Dean’s eyes started tearing up again.
Jack doesn’t say anything, he slowly walks over to Castiel and wraps his arms around his neck. Castiel, still confused, hugs Jack back. One of his palms curl around the back of Jack’s head. “Jack?”
“What?”
After a long pause, Dean sighed, loudly.
He couldn’t hold it in anymore. He pulled Castiel into the tightest hug, which was almost aggressive. He held on to him for dear life, it felt as if the world around him would shatter if he let go, or that the Empty would come again and take his angel away from him. Castiel wrapped his arms around his waist, equally tight, and he closed his eyes, feeling at home again.
Dean Winchester left a great legacy behind and saved more lives than they could count. He saved the world.
“Hello Dean.” He hears the raspy voice he’s grown to love.
Dean nodded. “Can we start over?” He said softly.
Jack, Dean and Castiel were playing chess one day when Jack suddenly says, “Well, looks like Sam’s here. I feel his presence.”
He tells Jack everything, all of it. How he fell in love with Dean, what a privilege it was to love someone as beautiful, inside and out, as Dean. All the pain, all the happiness that came with their friendship.
Jack and Castiel get out of the Impala. Sam’s eyes widen and his lips part, he is completely stunned. He goes past Dean, walking towards them. He pulls Castiel into a hug as he starts crying again.
“Cas...I know what you’re thinking, but you cannot blame yourself for this, please breathe.”
Jack holds Castiel’s shoulders “No....you told me once, that they’re humans, that their time will come, and it’s going to hurt like hell but it will remind us how much we loved them.”
They pulled away, but were still standing less than a feet away from each other. Dean held on to Castiel’s upper arms, gently stroking them with his thumb, while Castiel’s hands were running up and down his chest. Neither of them were ready to let go of each other’s physical touch.
“Dean...It’s Dean.”
“Well…Charlie said that to me once.”
But now, for the first time ever, he is so sure of what he wants to say, and he cannot wait to meet Castiel.
Another long pause.
He turns around, there he is. His devastatingly handsome angel.
“I know there are no excuses, I want to make it up to you.” Castiel was desperate.
Castiel’s eyes were now starting to tear up.
“I- uh. Something happened, Cas.” Jack’s voice cracks. He hasn’t seen Jack this bothered about something in quiet a while. He stares at Jack and gives him a look asking him to continue.
among all the horror? Or, I don’t know, maybe Chuck didn’t give me a chance to.”
He mourned Cas so much on earth, drank himself half to death, bottled up his feelings and pain like he always does, while fighting God himself.
“It was never my intention to hurt you Dean, or Sam. It’s just, Jack needed help. And I-“ Cas paused.
“I’m so proud of you, Jack, this...all of this, it’s beautiful. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
“What?” Castiel softly exhales. He just shuts off his brain at this point. He doesn’t want to think. He just needs solid answers.
“I’ll tell you everything, there’s a lot of catching up to do.” Sam said as he wiped his tears.
Cas holds him back, just as tight. His face is pressed up against Dean’s so tight their ears start to hurt, but it feels so good, to be here in Dean’s arms. It feels like home. It’s warm and comforting.
Castiel smiled lightly.
He married Eileen, had a kid with her, and lived a long apple pie life. He was satisfied and happy with the life he lived, and more than grateful.
to. And after what felt like a long walk, Dean throws his arms around Cas, in a bone-crushing hug, Cas almost trips.
“Dean...this is heaven. I want you to rest, not work. Besides, I love doing this, it’s what I’m good at, it’s not a burden.” Jack said.
“Of course, Dean.”
Dean smiled as he said, “You’re dreamy.”
“Yeah, well, me too. It’s okay, I’m really happy being here with you guys.”
“No...this wasn’t his time...No. This is too early. He was supposed to live a long life.”
“Cas…” He said softly. He looked up, straight into Cas’s eyes. Castiel’s eyes were so beautiful. They made Dean nervous.
Well, there’s no sugarcoating it anymore.
There’s definitely a lot of places to hide in heaven. But no, he’s here, there isn’t any sacrificial deal on Castiel’s mind right now, they aren’t fighting any cosmic entity, they aren’t saving the goddamn world. They’re free. He’s free. This is the right time and he’s going to meet Dean.
Castiel feels numb. It was too late. He could’ve saved Dean if he was on Earth right? And if only Sam knew he’s not in the Empty, he would’ve prayed for him to get his ass there and heal him, right? But why didn’t he pray to Jack? Fuck. This is his fault.
“Well...that took a long time, and I’m more than a century years old.” Castiel said as he blushed.
He doesn’t want to think about how he died. As much as he wishes he could’ve lived a long life for Cas, sadly, accidents happen. And he didn’t want Sam to face the consequences of bringing him back to life. If it’s his time, it’s his time, even if it’s not fair. He hated seeing Sam so broken. But Sam promised him that he’ll keep fighting and that’s what mattered to Dean.
Dean’s in heaven now. Quiet early, but nothing can be done now right? But according to the wise words of Dean Winchester, ‘
Dean rolled his eyes as he shook his head and smiled. He licked his lips as he leaned in, still holding Castiel’s face. He pressed his lips to Cas’ in the most gentle way possible, it was almost like a whisper of a kiss. Castiel kissed back, equally gently. It felt so good, the feeling was something neither of them could explain. They were both at their happiest.
Sam now looks at Jack, pulling him into a hug. “Hey Jack, how are you?”
Carry On My Wayward son plays and he begins his roadtrip to wherever his heart takes him. It’s a beautiful place. Jack and Castiel did a great job.
“Dean, I’m sorry. I just-“
There is a long pause. Jack doesn’t know what to say.
Hell, every emotion he felt was new to him, Dean really taught him how to
Both Jack and Castiel are devastated and heartbroken that Dean didn’t get a long life. He deserved it. He really did. After everything he’s been through, his story wasn’t supposed to end this way,
”What?” Dean says sharply, and his eyes well up, almost as if he’s challenging Castiel to say something.
The guy pales a little bit, his eyes narrowing at the sight of their IDs, but he opens the door fully and leads them inside. In daylight the bar looks even more run-down, the smell of stale beer and old smoke mingling with harsh sunlight. The legs of the chairs, propped up on their tables, cast long spidery shadows over the glistening floor. A mop and a bucket full of water stand next to the bar.
“No. Well, we could be,” he says – because seriously, this guy makes it so easy – then leans forward, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial rumble, “but truth be told, we‘d be in deep shit ourselves if our superiors found out about this, so we‘d rather keep it low-profile. We‘re not really supposed to go around starting bar fights, if you catch my drift?”
, his subconscious whispers. Just one little twitch of his finger and he can wake up from the nightmare this trip has become. Just one little movement to make it all go away. His arms are trembling, the muscles of his neck so taut it hurts. His heartbeat is dull and deafening in his ears, drowning out every other sound except Cas‘s ragged breaths behind him.
It‘s good that Dean‘s just bending down to retrieve the bag so Bobby doesn‘t see the expression on his face. “Yeah,” he answers just as gruffly.
They gather everything that could be connected to them in a hurry. On a hunch Dean searches the vessels for wallets, but they don‘t have any, neither of them.
“I don‘t believe this,” he grinds out, bringing his fist down on the wall next to him in helpless desperation. “This is supposed to be the part where I save people. Why, God, why does this one time of all fucking times have to be different? Why can‘t I save you?”
“Doesn‘t mean there aren‘t more. Doesn‘t mean they didn‘t follow us here,” Dean says brusquely, concentrating on drawing a line on the narrow window sill. “Damn, I wish I had some hexbags,” he mumbles.
The clouds outside break up and cold silvery moonlight floods the room. He blinks for a second, blinded by the sudden luminance, and because for a moment, a heartbeat– but then he looks again, and really, the figure standing there, it‘s–
“Cas,” he croaks, trying to push the dead weight of himself.
“Let‘s go, Cas,” he murmurs to the angel who has stepped next to him, swaying slightly.
“I don‘t think so. He wouldn‘t do that to you.”
for me, as you put it so delicately. Which is why his parents seem to think I riled him up and he died of a broken heart or something equally pathetic.” Dean gives a startled little laugh at her word choice that he tries to cover over with a cough, but she just continues with a shrug.
As there continues to come nothing but utter silence from the other side of the car he risks a furtive glance at the angel. Cas is looking at him, his wide eyes unnaturally bright in the dim moonlight, intense blue focused on Dean that makes shivers run down his spine. It‘s pretty dark in the car, but he could swear Cas‘s blushing. Then his head snaps back front, his eyes going blank again.
“Cas,” he says faltering. Under his fingers he can feel the rough texture of Cas‘s trench, the softer slide of cotton underneath, the warmth of his skin. Cas‘s eyes are as other-worldly blue and as enigmatic as always and Dean bites his lip.
“Stop calling me that,” he grinds out. And Dean doesn‘t care that the witch is still smiling and he‘s learnt to never look away from an opponent who can still smile while having a gun trained at her head. He turns towards Cas, standing behind the kitchen table, clothes rumpled and hair spiked. Cas, breathing hard and eyes wide. So much Cas his heart hurts just from looking at him.
“Weird,” he frowns, but then Cas is pulling him out of the house and towards the Impala.
Miller nods, wiping the bar in front of Dean with a slight frown. “Like I said, didn‘t think she was real.”
“Just tell me how to hurt her, Bobby.”
The path is uneven and bumpy, big pebbles breaking through the sun-baked mud. He steers his baby carefully, concentrating hard to avoid stones and potholes. He can feel Cas fidget on his seat, nervous or impatient or even scared, and suddenly he‘s afraid. He has no idea why, or from what, he just knows that seeing the angel like this, it makes the hair on the back of his neck bristle and dread clump in his gut.
“Bonus points for you, my child,” she says, smiling as if she made a joke both of them are too stupid to get. “You‘re right, I‘m not. I‘m so much more than these amateurs. Copycats, really.”
. And when you ripped me from hell Bobby and Sam both tried to stab me when they saw me, even though I had been away only for a couple of months. Months, Cas, not three fucking years.”
He‘s already starting to wonder if there‘s even a motel around when he sees garish pink neon lights, spelling out “Starlite Motel” in flickering letters. Half an hour later he‘s got the key to a single room and the directions to the local sheriff‘s office.
“Yeah?” he answers lazily, his fingers continuing to draw patterns on Cas‘s arm.
, Dean adds in his mind, “but you made the trip for nothin‘. Those people just didn‘t take too well to the heat. Hell, I don‘t take too well to the heat. But unless you wanna bust the sun, ain‘t gonna be something in it for you.”
Steps, light. The sound of liquid being poured. A chair scraping over the floor.
“Maybe, but it doesn‘t explain their deaths. Demons may let their meat suits get shot, stabbed or pushed off buildings, but they usually don‘t get heart-attacks.” He shifts a little to pull Cas closer before he continues. “But you‘re right, there‘s definitely a pattern here. The art teacher and his sister-in-law, the teenage chick and that Vampire-dude, the porn master and his invisible girlfriend...”
