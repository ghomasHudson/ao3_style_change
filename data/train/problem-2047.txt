‘Come on, let’s go and speak to the parents,’ he says.
Finally kisses are exchanged, and John admits to some inhibitions
‘I don’t even know if that’s possible.’
He grins.
‘Never mind, John,’ Sherlock huffs.  ‘It’s irrelevant.  We must get on.’
I was meant to be here.
‘Something like that.  I ran away from school too.’
He rests his head down on the pillow, looking smug.  ‘Those will do.’
The food at the pub is excellent.  The clientele is the monied type - quite a few older men in tweed jackets and shirts open too low, and with flushed faces; women with starched hairstyles, dressed in Jaeger.  We sit in a quiet corner and look at one another over a candle.  It reminds me of that first night at Angelo’s, when he made a fuss about bringing us a candle.  More romantic, he insisted, even though I in turn insisted we weren’t on a date.  I don’t think I have sat with Sherlock at a restaurant table since without someone bringing us a romantic candle.
He shrugs.  ‘Maybe Uni.  Maybe travel a bit.  Not sure yet.  There’s so much to choose from, in’t there?’
‘Hmmm,’ he responds, and I know that he is miles away, as usual, somewhere deep in the velvet shadows.
I felt the warmth of that afternoon brim in me again.
‘Come on in, the water’s lovely, as they say,’ he laughs, shivering with the cold.
‘So we go and see the police tomorrow?’
The main street in Arundel is very steep.  And my knees are like jelly.  It’s a hard climb from the car park at the foot of the hill to Castle Magic, the shop where John-Matthew bought the book we found.  The shop window is predictably full of huge chunks of rock amethyst, and incredibly naff statuettes of Celtic gods and fairies.  When we open the door, a little bell chimes.  The air is thick with the scent of joss.  Tinkly New Age music plays in the background.  A woman dressed, again predictably, in purple Indian cotton comes out of a back room through a bead curtain.  Her hair is long, and greying at the temples.
I gave in.  He explained.  I listened.  I hit him.
‘And exactly how many members of the public did we pass on our way up here?’
‘Where are we going?’
Humpf.
Sherlock warmed the pizza in the oven.
He wants me.  All of me.  Regardless.  I can see it in his eyes.  This is the turning-point in our relationship that I have both longed for and feared.  He has let down his last defences.  Time I let mine down too.  I don’t know whether he will be able to accept what he sees.  But he must see it.
Reading a few pages, it turns out to be nothing like I expected.  It is gentle, rather sweet, even playful, like a guidebook on playing witches for small girls, but with a slightly Buddhist spin.  There are recipes for spells, different incenses and potions, and rites for various times of the year.  It seems just about as far from what the Allens believe as it is possible to go.  There is a sticky label on the back, above the bar code.  It says: ‘Castle Magic, gifts of spirit and mystery’ and an address in the main street of Arundel.
Sherlock collected me from the hospital afterwards, solicitous to an unnerving extent.  I was still stoned on the anaesthetic, but I knew in a couple of weeks I’d be fine, now that the torn gristle inside my knee had been trimmed away, and the remainder mended.  Keyhole surgery is a doddle compared with the four procedures I had to have on my shoulder, so I’m not complaining, believe me.
THE END
‘I know.’
When I look again, he is grinning.  He leans forward, brushes the side of his nose against mine.  Those voluptuous lips are so close now, so tempting.
earns much.’
We had been up most of the night chasing a bunch of frankly nasty jewel thieves across New Cross after we had laid in wait for them at socialite Asram Messeh’s glittering Diamond Ball, and we were feeling rather pleased with ourselves.  It was hardly a big brain case for Sherlock, but it amuses him to catch the predictable burglars red-handed when he’s got nothing more intellectually pressing to do.
‘No.  Just freelance detectives,’ I tell him, ignoring Sherlock’s scowl.
‘Still, he’s below the age of consent,’ I point out.
It’s a hot drive out to Chichester to see the detective in charge of John-Matthew Allen’s case, and we sit in traffic on the A27 for most of it.  Sherlock isn’t very good at heat.  Cold is his natural element.  I’m not sure his body is capable of regulating temperature very well.  The more he sweats, the crabbier he gets.  By the time we arrive at the broken-down 1970s office block that forms the home of Sussex Constabulary’s detection corps, he is the foulest mood possible.
There is no point in having this argument.  We both need our sleep.  We’re not young men anymore.  I may be the older party, but even Sherlock is beginning to notice the creaks of anno domini catching up with him these days.
‘Good point,’ I nod.  ‘But didn’t Doctor Johnson say: “when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.”’
And some other bits they needed.
‘You want to know if I know where he was going.  I don’t.  I just think he went off to discover stuff.  Find out more about the world.  Knowing Jonny, he’s thought about it a lot, planned it.  Got himself a place to live and everything.  Knowing Jonny, you won’t find him either.  He’s clever.  He’ll have worked it all out.’
meant.
‘It’s hot.  I need a shower.  Let’s go back to the hotel and get ready for dinner.’
‘Hardly – seeing as I just profited by it considerably, while you are as yet uncared-for.’  I pull him against me, and kiss him.
Sherlock made another one.
‘You like it here, don’t you?’
‘Do you need any help?’ she smiles decorously.   ‘We’ve got some lovely new books on Iron John which might interest you.’
‘Oh fuck,’ I say to myself, knowing I either have to jump in too, or look like a total wimp.  I peel the rest of my clothes off and inch my way in, stubbing a toe on a rock, taking time to swear and nearly lose my balance, sploshing about hopelessly, and then managing to take the plunge.
‘Good?’
We are woken by the hotel phone.
Sherlock sits back and raises an eyebrow.  He peaks his fingertips together.
‘I dreamt I lost you,’ he whimpers, and presses his face into the curve of my shoulder.  He clings to me all the tighter.
‘Stop it,’ he calls back to me, a knowing tone in his voice.
‘Can I help you?’  She has a slight west-country burr.  I try not to look at her lovely breasts.
There is a sequel to this story, The Bee House, which I hope to migrate here in the next few days.  Thank you so much for reading.  Constructive criticism is always welcome.
It took seven months of weekend visits to Sussex before the ink was finally drying on the paperwork, and I had the keys in my sweaty palm.
‘Me what?’
I look down between us and see his cockhead, slick with precome, beautiful and glossy and pink and proud, with the foreskin retracted.   Before I know what I am doing, my hand has slipped between our bodies and wrapped around both our erections, clamping the shafts together.  Instinct takes over.  We both pump upwards, into my fist.
Sherlock, when he realised what had happened (he thought I had just fallen over), was not happy.   In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him so distraught, even when he came home after the fall.  It triggered something in him.  Something deep.
She nods sympathetically.  ‘She’s such a funny woman.  They have such odd ideas, you know.  Peculiar.  But I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.  Losing a child.’
‘You’re dead!’  John shouted and slammed the front door.
‘Yeah,’ I agree, seeing this boy’s youthful wisdom.  ‘Yes, Sherlock’s all I’ve got too.’
‘Oh, well, it definitely set him apart, of course.’
Having apparently finished his hors-d’oeuvres, he gets down to the main event.  He licks his way up my shaft, tasting the salty flesh, tickling the throbbing veins with the tip of his tongue.  He laps at the head, and when I look down I see a thin, glassy thread of precome linking my cockhead with his lower lip.  He looks up at me and there is a familiar impish glint in his eye.  He takes the glans fully into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it, sucking gently, and I make the quantum leap into heaven.
‘Take me, John,’ he whispers, his voice breaking a little with emotion.  ‘Paint my insides with your name, carve your love on my soul.’
Jonny looks sulky but allows us to join him.
He bobs his eyebrows naughtily.  ‘I presume that means the experiment provided a successful outcome?’
There would have to be a nice kitchen, or one that could be refitted, because I like to cook.  And a bathroom that was big enough for a large shower and a tub that could accommodate two – we do most of our ‘relationship’ discussions sitting in the bath, although these are often sabotaged by Sherlock’s passion for sucking my toes, and that leads to, well, things.
‘John.’
She points out a ragged tent on the margins of the camp.  ‘Mind where you step.’
She looks torn.  ‘I’m bound by my oath of silence, you see,’ she explains, grinding the heels of her hands together.  ‘It’s not that I don’t want to help.  It’s just that there could be serious karmic consequences if I break the confidentiality of the Coven.’
Sherlock pokes about a bit, and then lets out a heavy sigh.  ‘Not here.  These are the popular kids.’
‘I don’t want to spoil the excitement for you.’
In which Sherlock exhibits unexpected tact, and equally unexpected sexual talents...
She glances at me as she passes, smiles.  Her teeth are creamy and even.  She wears a little silver heart on a chain around her neck, so simple, emphasising the sweep of her collar bones, and it makes me want her even more.  Crouching against the cool wall, I realise I am half hard just watching her retreating rear as she walks away, the luscious globes of her buttocks giggling under the thin cloth.  She must be wearing a thong because I can see everything, and I’m pretty sure she knows it.
‘Don’t be ridiculous,’ he says.  ‘You’ll ruin your back.  I’ll sleep in the chair.’
‘Well, I don’t know about you, but
‘Experiment?’
‘Lucky I hired a car then,’ I say, and crunch on the rattafia biscuit that came with my coffee.
‘Yeah, his mum and dad sing hymns all the time, they say it scares off the demons.’
Fate has a great sense of humour.  I hope to God he’ll get her joke.
After our meal we take our coffee on the terrace.  The garden slopes steeply down towards the meadow beyond where I watched the tractor earlier.  The hedge that separates the two is heavy with bramble blossom and dog rose.  The sun has set behind the Down, and bats are hunting, whirring over our heads as we sit in comfortable wicker chairs.
I still have no idea why Sherlock accepted the case.  Even I can see that it is way below his incredible talents.  And the kid probably
Anyway, it is an apparently simple case.  A sixteen year old boy has gone missing from his home in a village near Arundel in West Sussex.  The police have drawn a blank.  The parents, devoted Christians, are unwilling to accept the constabulary’s verdict that the boy has simply run away.  They call us in.
I close my eyes.  I can feel the heat of his body, the weight of his arms resting on my shoulders.  His hot breath smells faintly fishy from the scallops.  He has never come this close to articulating his feelings for me before and I am sure it’s not a coincidence.  It is the Down, watching over us, benevolent.  This place is doing something to us, changing us.
‘We don’t have anything with us.’
‘You know.  How often you can masturbate before you get RSI.  How you get a girl to fuck you, that kinda thing.’
‘This is excellent, Sherlock,’ I tell him.  ‘You really should eat something.’
Later, an owl breaks into my dreams.  It’s weird, shivering cry draws me into consciousness, and I realise that Sherlock is wrapped around me, snoring gently.  (That’s another thing people don’t expect about Sherlock, he snores dreadfully, to the point that I am beginning to suspect sleep apnoea as the root of his recurrent insomnia.  I can hear him through the floor of my bedroom at 221B.  Snores like a bloody hog.  It’s that stumpy little nose of his.)  He has fastened onto me like a cross between a giant sloth and a limpet.  And you know what?  It feels fantastic.
He tugs off his boxers.  His cock is flushed pink and half hard.
Three months of me camping out in the cottage’s carcass during the week, and trekking back to Baker Street for weekends, of overseeing the builders and schmoozing the council planning officer, while Sherlock did what he did best.  Annoying the Met.
Back at the hotel, we eat dinner in the dining room by candle light, the pub having been too busy to fit us in – we have booked at table there for tomorrow night.
When Frank came back, he said he saw a ghost staring at me from the window and asked if I had cured many Scottish men during the war.
We sat down on the hay, when I had finished with the dressing, Sherlock started to eat some bread and cheese that Mrs. Hudson had given me for him.
I met Victor a very interesting man, who had some knowledge of herbs and preparations. He told me that if I wanted every now and then I could go from his shop to have a look and compare ourselves on our knowledge.
"They hate me. If there was an opportunity, they would kill me without any hesitation, "I commented as I fiddled with food.
"Poor John for you does not have to be easy, being a Saxon in the Highlands."
"Of course, I do not think I have anything better to do," I said, pointing to a smile. When I looked up at him, I think he could feel my sadness, so he put a hand on my shoulder and left in silence.
"Forgive me, and would it be? I'm confused, I lost track of time".
From where we were in the distance we could see the lights of Inverness. I suddenly noticed that women dressed in white with torches in their hands appeared around the stone circle. Frank and I hid behind the bushes in order to observe the rite from afar. When the women began to dance all around the stones, I felt a thrill along the back like, if it were an inner call. I wouldn't know how to explain it, but it was like the stones were almost calling me.
"It's a barbarous thing, poor boy," I exclaimed in horror.
"Hold him Still," I began by making him rotate his arm holding the elbow still and then after being looked into the eyes there exchanged a nod of consent, I turned the shoulder with a decisive blow, returning to his place.
“Frank? What are you doing? "I asked terrified.
"No, No... John. Is that even if I did, nothing would change what I feel for you. My love for you is immense, can you forgive me? "He was holding me by the elbow and I looked at him carefully before answering.
Murtagh Holmes, Sherlock's uncle had taken a seat next to me, perhaps he had noticed my discomfort in not understanding what Colum was saying then he began to translate aloud.
(-.-)
The man in uniform approached me before answering.
(See the end of the chapter for
"All right, let's take a look at your shoulder," I said, chuckling at him.
At first the woman seemed hesitant, almost suspicious, but then, with resignation, gave a sign of consent and let me in.
Holmes nodded. With a kick to Holmes, I dropped all the mug of beer.
I had carefully designed all the way forward. At night the two windows would have been lit by torches, a useful diversion to escape the sentries, but I had to find a diversion to my omnipresent shadows.
Author's corner !!
"No figured, I have so many in the pantry that they take dust," he admitted smiling.
Too bad that I was wrong.
"Can I ask how many glasses did you drink?" Asked Holmes curiously, who obviously had noticed my state of non-sobriety.
"Mister Watson, do you feel good?" Dougal came out from behind the bushes and I quickly dried my eyes.
"Dougal's orders are to stay with you, so ... could you stay here? Until I find a girlfriend for the evening? "
I couldn't see electric light as far as my eyes could see. So as far as logic rebelled against this idea I knew within myself that I was no longer in the twentieth century.
The young woman's mother kept shouting that a miracle had happened.
"disinfected?" inquired one of the puzzled men.
"Hi, I would not be indiscreet. My name is John Watson, I came with the MacKenzie clan, I'm a healer. I heard the little girl screaming from the end of the street. Can I visit your son? "
"As you can well see now I have already done. Now I can catch a glimpse of your handsome, arrogant English face. "At his words, I felt my face flush, what was happening to me?
"I'm from Oxfordshire. I was traveling with a servant to visit distant relatives living in France and we came across some bandits. I was able to escape, but I was forced to abandon my horse and my belongings. As I wandered through the woods, I was suddenly attacked by Captain Jim Moriarty. I believe you know him. Now sir, I would like to go back to the way of being able to return to Inverness ".
I stared for a long time at the boy nailed to the pillory, while holding a glass of port in his hand.
I approached him, started the collar, unlacing his shirt, after losing the first buttons of his jacket. I felt the eyes of Holmes scrutinize me.
"Actually it's a great place for amles, it's not to be ruled out that..." The man sped up the horse's stride to reach the elder man. They began to speak in Gaelic.
"No, no alarm clock we're on vacation" I told him in a firm voice.
"So, you're a healer ?!" I nodded.
"A deal?" I asked, interdict.
"Call me John. What can I do for you?"
Since I would have participated in hunting as a healer, I had to get a horse, so I went to the stables. My Uncle Lamb had taught me to ride when we lived in Ireland, but it had been a while now, so I had to choose a gentle, calm horse.
Chapter 5
As we advanced through the woods, the men began to make noise with their voices and shields.
"Ah ... hunting. Is that why you were getting ready? "
"You met some of my friends," a man appeared at the door.
When we came out of the hut, I looked up at the horizon, pointed the look where the city of Inverness was supposed to rise.
"But to this dear, we can fix it right away," at these words Mrs. Hudson grabbed me by the arm and dragged me into one of the castle rooms.
"Yes, I think so."
We went back on the march and when the evening came, I realized that the man behind me was falling.
"As an excuse? Should he tear his ear to free himself? "I was shocked.
I opened my eyes and looked at him questioningly. Why such a change? I did not explain it to him.
"I know this place, the British used it as a base for their ambush" I revealed out loud.
"Stay here and do not move, I'll be right back," he told me with a stern look.
"He was in a woman's house, down the street."
At those points he laughed with gusto, and his laughter was deep as well as the tone of his voice, warm and sensual.
"Yes I would like it"
"Ah... you want to cut my throat? Make it pure, I really want to see, "I challenged him.
"Father Bean would have preferred it to die harder than to heal thanks to me".
I knew enough about this era: politics, people, their customs and traditions, even the colloquial ways, were familiar to me. But these were second-hand knowledge, acquired from books, museums and paintings. It was like landing in an alien world seen so far only with a telescope. But then you start wondering if life really is really that different here.
"Because it is not native to Scotland, I tore a leaf to look at it closely.
So saying Lord --- he smiled at Sherlock and handed him the cup of the alliance, and after drinking, the whole room began to applaud and shout of joy.
"Apparent? Excuse me but I do not think this is the most suitable term. I have been threatened, mistreated and kidnapped. I would say I was more than "apparently confused", sir, "I said through clenched teeth, I felt offended.
"Dougal told me I can get rid of you as long as you're good."
"No, it's Porto. An expensive wine "
"Do you think he's okay?"
"This is not an answer you could have lied or tell me it was not my business"
"Tomorrow morning, we will leave and I want to take you with me."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh GodCelo, it's pretty embarrassed," I said slightly reddened.
(>-<)
"Let him be a father," Mrs. Hadson said.
I ate the hot soup, then pointed to my clean clothes.
"No, John is Jim Moriarty, at last!"
"You could have told me you were shot before you fell off your horse. You're a real idiot. "
"It seems a sum a bit 'excessive for an escape" I found myself saying aloud, while reflecting on what he was revealing to me.
When Mr. Holmes returned to work, I noticed that someone was following me. Surely a spy on Dougal's behalf. I knew they did not trust me and I suspected they thought I was an English spy. So, in the days that followed I devoted myself to doing uninteresting things, not to give satisfaction to Dougal. Mrs. Hadson had given me the task of helping her with the harvest of herbs for the kitchen. I rediscovered the pleasure of growing things and making them mature.
In the afternoon I went back to the castle, when I reached the kitchens my escort told me to wait a few minutes because she had to talk to a man.
"Mr. Watson, I was just about to talk about his unusual childhood. We drink a glass of port and listen to it ", while Victor filled another glass. I turned a pleading look to Mr. Holmes. I wanted to leave with him, for fear of having to tell some absurd lie too much.
"N-no, of course not. I was with my mind elsewhere, "I tried not to sound too surprised at the visit. Victor handed me the bottle of port.
"You're going to get dirty all by staying there"
I did not even notice that I had put my arms on my chest, as if to cover me. Even though it was a useless gesture.
The celebrations for the victory in London and Paris surpassed the MacKenzie gathering, but this was something different. Simple joy free from the trauma of war and from exhaustion for its end. The MacKenzie were simply happy to meet, despite my desire to leave my heart was lifted by walking around the camp and a small part of me regretted my imminent flight.
"See, in the end you're nice," tried to play Sherlock down.
"Very well then", he made his usual presumptuous smile while pointing to a sheltered place where I could change the bandages.
I'm about to go on vacation so I'll see you again with a new chapter in both Italian and English in about three weeks. Greetings and see you soon.
When I approached the man, I caught sight of the face. He was a man with a penetrating gaze, very clear eyes, with black curls. I grabbed his arm but before I started the operation I looked up at the men.
"M-But why did nobody warn me?" I asked, perplexed.
When we left at dawn, he managed to take my real deep breath after weeks. I did not know where that journey would take me and what opportunities would come to me. I prayed only that they would make me approach the stones of Craigh na Dun as much as possible, if I had been so I would have reached them by all means necessary.
I jumped up on the bed and laughed, as if I was back in the back in time, when I was five years old.
Just then came the housekeeper of the house with the tea-tray.
"How come Johnny boy I have such a terrible feeling that you're not wearing underwear?" a sneer had painted on Frank's face, who had already begun to release my trousers with fervour and to lower them decisively. He lifted my hips effortlessly and threw his mouth on my groin as his hands kept raising my knees on his shoulders. He took me passionately in those old walls, as if no one else had existed in that moment, just me and him.
At sunset we went to this magical place, with a circle of stones.
"I know that your last wound is right at your left shovel right here", doing so hit me with force in that same spot with the hilt of the sword. And I backed away from the pain, clumsily slipped and fell to the ground on the straw and Sherlock, caught the moment disarming me and pointing his sword to my throat.
Father Baen was dragging a boy by the neck and a crowd was following them to the pillory. I saw the terrified boy, seated next to the pillory, Father Bean behind him to hold his head while another man with a hammer and nail, nailed the boy's ear to the wood, every blow of hammer followed a chilling cry of pain of the poor boy.
"Soon give me something to hold the firm arm, a belt or a piece of cloth," one of the men stretched me his belt.
"He was relieving the headache from Whiskey," he nodded, smiling happily.
"They do not hang around very much, they climb up, maybe they challenge the devil by urinating on the stones and if they're lucky, they'll find berries or ramsons to eat."
"Why never? We are fighting is it possible to touch the opponent, no?! "he said with a mischievous look, moving his pelvis slightly.
"Look what you do," the man next to him said.
I could not eat, the meeting with Sherlock, had given me to think. I felt something growing in me against that bizarre boy, who so easily managed to figure out where my famous wound almost killed me. Sometimes I felt the need to watch him, look at his features, admire his face, but at the same time Frank's face appeared in my mind. I had to be able to come back before it was too late.
"Bring me where exactly?"
"Considering we no longer have a healer since David died, I want you to take his place."
"No, I could not do it in front of the head groom."
"Whenever possible, I would need a hand. I must get rid of some things, if you were kind enough to give me assistance, you will be grateful, "I said with a note of sarcasm.
Today I would have had my chance to escape from Leoch and return to Craigh na Dun.
"Yes, but you see tomorrow I'm leaving for Inverness" and the face of Holmes I noticed a note of sadness and resignation.
"It's the punishment for those who steal, it's already so much if they cut off their hands. Surely, he had stolen a loaf of bread from the baker. It's not unusual, it often happens. "
Hello everyone. I wanted to thank all those who have and are reading this story. But I'd like to know what you think. Let me know and see you soon.
"You will have been a little over seven years," said Holmes, perplexed, looking at her.
"We will travel to the MacKenzie lands to collect the taxes, so Colum does not like it, to visit thick donkeys and tributaries is up to me and I have to deal with small businesses around."
"I think it's a wise thing to bring a healer with us. One who works well under pressure and on the road there is a lot. So it is decided, we will leave at dawn ", so saying he left. I found myself alone again with my thoughts.
"Good night Mr. Holmes" went away, chuckling under his breath.
Holmes approached me and without speaking offered me the arm to accompany me to sit, while the minstrel continued to start playing.
"M-but I do not have the right dress."
"What are you doing to this poor lady, dog?"
"You leave me puzzled John. One would think that there are no woes or punishments in your parts. "
"So you're telling me you can read the tea leaves?" asked her curiously.
"I would not have dared, I was afraid you would have spanked me, if I had come so far," he said with a provocative grin.
"Prussia I wanted to say."
"You must not apologize. It's five days from today, "he said finally. " In the meantime, see accepting hospitality in my humble abode. "
"Stay close to me, where I can see you and if you try to make a false move know that I will cut your throat I was clear?", so saying he ordered me to go up in the saddle with the young man from the wounded arm. I wanted to rebel against such a treatment, but unfortunately I saw myself compelled to obey. Once in the saddle I noticed that I was shaking and I felt the man behind me move.
"Now that your face is almost decent, take off your jacket, shirt and waistcoat." He ordered me badly.
"I'm sorry, I did not want to. Forgive me! "I hastened to say, for fear of having done some irreparable damage.
The man behind me at those points pushed me off the horse and before disappearing into the woods he told me to hide. When all the men rode through the trees, I saw a couple of English soldiers from behind a rock. I seized the moment when everyone was distracted from the battle to run as fast as possible and escape. I traveled a stream and arrived at a clearing. I was convinced I had moved away enough, but when I stopped to catch my breath. He appeared on horseback at the wounded man's shoulder.
Suddenly a gunshot made me jump. From behind some trees I caught the soldiers in costume with the white and red English uniforms, with a rifle in hand.
‘You promised me bees,’ he said.  ‘And besides, sooner or later the villains are going to outrun us.  We can’t allow our legend to be compromised.  Quit while you’re ahead, isn’t that what they say?’
At that moment, Sherlock and Mrs Bennett come back into the house, chattering away about the amount of traffic on the A27 these days.  Josh looks at me and rolls his eyes comically, and I can’t help laughing.
‘And why do you think that is?’
A woman is walking up the street towards me.  She is dressed in white linen trousers and a white strappy top.  The garments cling to her figure.  She is probably in her forties, tanned and blonde, beautiful, one of those high-maintenance women you find in wealthy heritage towns like this.  Her hips swing.  Her makeup is subtle, elegant, a slick of lipstick, mascara, and naked skin that gleams with health.  She is enjoying the sun and the feel of her body moving through it.
I reach up and grab at the back of his head, pull him down, and that amazing mouth meets mine.
‘Maybe for the dungeons,’ I suggest, aware of his delight in the macabre.  He ignored me.
‘It would be just a weekend bolt-hole to begin with,’ I told him, rolling onto my back and pulling him with me. He sprawled over my chest, his cheek prickling my skin as he rested close to my scarred shoulder.  ‘We don’t need to retire yet, surely?’
‘It’s not a case of
It took me nearly twenty minutes to get him out of that shop.  He bought up pretty much every book she had on Tantric sex.  I caught sight of myself in the shop window as we left.  My face was beetroot.
"Porto? It's very strong. "
"He's absolutely right, in fact now I was going back to where I came from," I started to walk away, but I was pulled back to the wall.
"Well ... here, I really am here for you. I have to change the bandage. You see? I brought the necessary ", I pointed to the basket I held in my hand.
When I finished dinner, I left the castle, I found myself crying. I was not jealous of Leary, but I was terribly frightened of their intimacy by Frank.
"He is not sick, he is possessed. Do not you believe in the possession of the devil John? "He asked confused.
"If Mrs. Hadson makes you feel better now when she talks about you, now she calls" the one who does miracles ".
I approached him and whispered: "It's a sedative."
Stop! It's falling! "and the man fell to the unconscious ground.
"My name is John Watson and I'd like you to let me go right away," I yelled in his face.
"But really?! Very well we make a deal "
"Mmm... interesting"
"And has this minstrel been here for a long time?" I asked Leary, but it was Holmes who spoke.
Better. Thank you. " He turned to me with half a smile. I had to admit he was a handsome man, but he looked crude like everyone else.
"No, I have to put your arm on your side," he raised his eyes to the sky. I started wrapping his arm and I found his chest very close to my face, I tried not to make a sound, I was sure  was blushing, so I tried to avoid any contact with his eyes. I knew he was peering at me.
"Where do you think you're leaving Saxon?" Sherlock's unmistakable baritone startled me.
"Oh... Yes, you will do it," I pointed the sword to my throat.
"I understand, you stay well if you want but come back before the storm bursts." I greeted Frank with a pat on the shoulder and I started at the tavern.
"I will get out of this barn, without your pesky suppositions, thank you very much", I threatened him with annoyed tone.
Back in the country, we went to visit the Reverend's estate in Inverness, so that Frank could continue his research, and I was deeply bored reading old manuals on the couch.
"If I have to be honest, you are the only friend I can talk to without feeling judged. Wrapped up I really feel like a stranger in a foreign land ", I sat in one of the chairs by the fireplace.
"You know this is not goodbye. I'm stronger than you think. I'll be back Frank Moriarty. You can be sure of that, "somehow I managed to convince him, even if the goodbye was painful anyway.
With the passage of time Frak became more and more passionate about genealogy of his family so me too. He took me to an old castle of an ancient Scottish family that lived hundreds of years earlier. At last we arrived at the castle, now ruined.
I sighed and had to give up my escape because of a naughty boy and irritating.
I pretended not to notice his pedantic sneer.
"Jesus Christ!! Victor?!"I jumped in fright.
When I got back to the stables, I went back to my clinic to finish my last preparations.
"Are you ready? There's a person who wants to meet you, "I followed her down the corridors of the castle, when we reached a studio, where I waited a few minutes before the person with whom I had to talk would show up.
We went to the clinic, with some difficulty on my part, stumbling.
"My name is Colum MacKenzie, I'm the owner of the castle", he beckoned me to sit down, while he too sat at the desk.
Fortunately, I had read somewhere, how to dress a kilt. I had to try a couple of times before achieving a decent result. I felt terribly discovered.
"Satan has claimed his body, Father Baen can only hope to save his immortal soul," said the boy's mother in tears.
I kicked him in the middle of his legs and a head. Just to make him move and get away, but the moment lasted only a few moments because I felt his hands affirming my ankles and dropping me on the ground. Then a man in Kilt threw himself on the soldier by hitting him in the head and making him faint. The man in kilt then beckoned me to follow him as he spoke in Gaelic and after taking me behind a trunk to hide from the British troops, I felt something hitting me in the neck and everything became dark.
"Oh ... but it's not for that. I just wish his heart made progress. "
"I wanted to thank you personally, for what you did during the hunt."
"I'm sorry ... those fillies are dangerous?" I asked. Then I felt his foot stomping on mine, like telling me to stop.
"Well, then I suppose you'll come with me," and grabbing me by the arm made me ride on horseback, to reach out to the others.
"But I clearly remember you ... but you ... you really do not remember me?"
After one of my shadows took his oath, I approached him to distract him.
"You had already seen dying men of violent death" was Dougal who came to me, I do not even know why but I had a strange feeling that it was not a courtesy visit.
"What did Dougal tell you? Did one of your henchmen ever tell you any lies about me? "
When I got to the stables, I saw Sherlock inside the fence with a nice white horse, intent on turning it around him. I was fascinated, so focused and seemed to be one with the animal. And his black curls moved with the wind, revealing his pale, elegant face in the sunlight. As I approached the fence, I dropped a cup, causing a state of agitation in the animal and Sherlock fell badly backwards.
"Mmm... we'll talk about it later, we have to deal with Sherlock" and approached the figure near the fireplace sitting on an old chair.
"Yes ... I suppose so."
"Your research last week has been repaid to what I see."
I was getting even more red, if possible, from embarrassment. Why did not that man leave me alone?
We rode for several hours. We arrived at the foot of a mountain with a strange form from the tail of a rooster.
"I'm not going to let him alone," declared the elder man.
"Here ... I ..." I could not formulate a plausible excuse so I just did not look at that look, analytical and penetrating.
"Sulfur? It looks threatening. "
Chapter 3
That conversation disturbed me deeply, I felt that the boy certainly was not possessed but ill. He had somehow contracted the disease in the ruins of the Black Church. I had to find a way to be escorted there, to be able to better understand what could have caused this damage.
"Well ... yes if I want to keep up with the others"
Inside the castle was crumbling, ivy and rubble envelopded him giving an even more mysterious appearance.
Holmes looked at me puzzled.
I walked away from Sherlock, worried that he could understand something.
We approached the pillory. Holmes put his foot on the step and leaning his elbow on the leg leaned toward the boy.
"Even in mine."
"No, and what about him?" I asked, worried, pointing to the injured young man, who was dismounting his saddle and moving away.
We sat in silence for a few moments, peering at each other.
"I will never go away from here", I felt almost resigned to the idea of having to be imprisoned in this age and in this damn castle for the rest of my life.
"Who will have lived here?" asked aloud Frank snooping around.
"Put some of this mixture on the nipple and bring the child's face close, you'll see that it will attack."
"My dear, there was no cure for what afflicted the baby. He had gone to the Black Church, they are ruins of an ancient Benedictine monastery. "
"Well... here too I like the beautiful stories of ghosts that's all," the reverend turned red with embarrassment.
Mr. Holmes entered the door.
"I hope you didn't strain your shoulder too much," I said to him with clenched teeth.
"So this is your sudden work, but welcome visit to your house?" I asked.
Holmes turned and looked first at me then at the young man.
My heart suddenly lightened, and I knew at that moment that I could no longer wait for permission or be helped. I had to escape from the castle and return to the stone circle as soon as possible, even if I risked dying.
"Or are you planning a love escape with someone? Is that why you want so much to go to France? Why do you have a secret lover waiting for you? "
"You will not believe me to be less brave than a Saxon boy, right?" He said defiantly.
Maybe Sherlock did not know who he was dealing with, but I would not let it go smoothly.
(> - <)
"But I want to go see witches, they make a ritual not so far from here. They dance and pronounce spells around stones, I want to go and see. "
"What are you doing, can you know? If you're not careful, you'il drop me, "I said, angry.
"Well! Remove the blindfold in a couple of days" I instructed him as I put the used bowls on the table.
"Perfect. Do as you please, I'll go there. "
"Of Course I forgive you," I stretched my hands and took his face, bringing it closer to mine to kiss him passionately. Frank took the opportunity to hug me tight in a few moves undressing my pajamas, while I did the same. Once on the bed we made love with passion and desire.
"Moriarty" began to speak the wounded young man, "the officer you met in the woods, will not stop easily. He's in charge of the local redcoats. He will have sent patrols in every direction, I cannot stay here, "he said in fine.
"Do you feel like risking helping me again, then? Do you know the Black Church? "
I picked up the baby and started listening to lungs and heart, to be able to rule out more serious causes. He was just very hungry, he was putting his teeth so he could not get to the breast for the pain.
"What a friendly place" I told Frank, observing the room that the innkeeper assigned us.
"Yes well... it's so I'm a doctor." The young man looked at me curiously and perplexed.
"Given the lack of illuminations and ventilations, I would say the hermit of the castle perhaps, or maybe a troll or two" i aid.
"Other than that, but the trip went well, no?" He asked me.
"I would say you need a supply of white willow bark," said Victor, rummaging through his stocks.
"Oh... Baby Yes. Yes! come for me John, come "as he pushed wildly into me repeatedly hitting the prostate, making me tremble with pleasure with one hand began to stimulate my member erect with energy. Within a few moments we groan our respective names, and we reached orgasm together. Never before had I felt more at home, in the arms of my man.
" Remember to be an Englishman, in a place that is not a good thing. Someone will soon want to talk to you. Be careful, "he picked up his things and left the room leaving me alone with my thoughts.
"Thanks Saxon. Really! "He thanked me once more by breathing down my neck, and I felt a thrill.
I did not regret having helped that poor woman. I could understand their hatred of the British. But the fact that they treated me like dung, when until that moment I had done nothing but help them. Since I had gone through those damned stones, I had only dealt with negative and ugly things. It seemed to me that the more I went on, the more the situations got worse.
"... every night I imagined you next to me hoping one day to be able to see you again", his lips were now on my neck and then on the right shoulder.
"O-okay, sure," I said uncertainly.
"I think we could do something about it, I would like to know how it was possible that a gentleman like you, has found himself wandering in the woods, with clothes as bizarre as yours?!".

"This song is about a man who, at night, on an enchanted hill on the eve of Samhain, hears a woman's voice coming from the rocks of the hill that sings a melancholy melody. I'm a Bhalnein woman, I was kidnapped again, the stones seemed to say. I was on top of the hill and the wind got up and a thunder burst like a roar on the ground. I put my hands on the highest stone and was transported to a very distant land, where I lived a period between strangers who became lovers and friends. But one day I saw the moon rise and the wind rose again, so I touched the stones and went back to my land and could reunite with the man from whom I had been taken away. "Holmes translated for me, speaking softly in my ear, while the ballad was played.
"But I'm also a highland dweller. Raised here and it is not fair to challenge fate by making fun of the devil in his home. "
(>-<)
"Yes I'd say I cared for a lot of Frank, why this question? What do you want to ask me? "
"It had long since I felt the taste of a good tea" I said while I Gustavo the hot drink.
"It would seem you would eat grass if you could."
"The evening is getting interesting at last," he announced pleased as he drew his sword.
"Maybe you do not use his party to celebrate properly, but I will not lose the meeting to follow you in that hole."
"No in fact I am not" he made him in an arrogant tone.
"That's right. They have this power."
"I also see ... you have trouble sleeping. Roots of valerian, I too can hardly sleep. But I do not pesto it as you do, I'll boil it first. "
"Good night, Mr. Holmes," I said with a harsh note.
At last I mentioned my head as a sign of affirmation. I noticed that  I began to tremble all the time. Frank started off his jacket and melted the knot in the tie; Then calmly unbuttoned my waistcoat, coming so to the shirt. When I slipped off my shoulders, I realized I was holding my breath. Frank watched my body carefully, patting and kissing every sign, every scar on my skin. With one hand grabbed both my wrists holding them on the pillow, while with the other hand had started to unfasten my trousers, from my lips escaped a groan, feeling that his lips now were at the height of the navel. When I slipped my trousers together with the linen, I found myself completely naked at his complete disposition. I wanted it to take me, I felt the need to have it in me again, it would help me.
"I'm going to see if Alec wants a hand", so saying he left the room.
"No, I would say no. However, it would be unlikely. At sixteen I did not have the slightest interest in girls ", angrily nudged Holmes and squandrai.
"The monks who built this place came from Germany by chance?" I asked him.
After an hour we were still listening to music and dancing, when I realized I was drinking the fourth or fifth cup, I was definitely drunk, but I could not give it to see.
He returned shortly after with a plate of soup and a bucket of hot water.
"Ah ... thank you very much. I think I have slightly overdone ", I found myself laughing, even Holmes had joined in laughter.
"Can you ride?" asked the elder man.
"In fact not for evasion but for murder. But I did not kill the man they accuse me of. "
A deep silence fell, I almost started talking when we heard a knock on the door.
"Eat a lot I try to clean your face." He started with a cloth to wipe my eye and nose. He did it with such care that it almost seemed surreal. I found myself contemplating his hands and his long, tapering fingers and the color of his skin so clear that it was milky. In sharp contrast with the curly raven hair, almost like a mythological creature.
"And you yes ?!"
"If I had known that one day we had been in this position, I would have imagined a different context," he said as he laughed at her.
"Well ... I followed my instincts" approached, bending down a few inches from my face, "I decided to trust you," he looked me straight in the eye.
"Oh ... you're trying to escape what I see. Leaving aside the fact that in that bag there is not enough provisions for a trip to Inverness. Do you really believe you can go out there and face only thirty armed guards? "
Bored, I walked away to get a better look at the village, and a harrowing sound from a tearful baby caught my attention.
"His lips are a little swollen, Mr. Holmes, was he by chance hit by a horse?" I asked, mocking him.
"Y-You can take the bandage off in a couple of days," I announced, turning away.
"According to the Celtic tradition, these stones were brought here from Africa by a group of Celtic giants," Frank told us as we approached the stones more and more.
"Mr. Trevor, Mr. Watson ... Dougal has been recalled to Leoch. I'll take you back. "
"I doubt I was so attractive as to be remembered".
"It's all right," Holmes said as he lifted me off the ground, holding me by the side, "is that he cannot stand the sight of blood." We walked away towards the horses.
"Yes well ... he suddenly shook his head".
"No, it's ... I had an unusual childhood. That's all, I've grown up in many places, "I said vaguely.
"You are a very complicated man, Mr. Holmes," I admitted, scrutinizing his face.
‘The kid could be dead in a ditch, and he’d never know!  Just because he’s 16 doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a right to justice.’
‘Did you go to Barts with this man?  He sounds rather facile.’
‘You didn’t mind?’
‘Your secret is safe with us,’ Sherlock said.
‘I like it here,’ he says, eventually.  ‘I definitely think we should retire here.  I could keep bees.’
We sit back on our palms in the sun.  The leaves rustle softly.  It really is very lovely here.  If you wanted to find yourself, I can’t think of a better place to do it.
‘We have that money Aunt Agatha left me,’ he said, and gave me those puppy eyes he knows won’t get around me, but always do.  I wasn’t going to tell him that I’d been squirrelling away funds too, all this time, though he probably knew.
‘Nope.’
‘Sherlock, we can’t-‘
‘You walk round one of them clubs down there and tell me who isn’t?’  He flips through the file in front of him.  ‘I can make you copies of the salient points if you really want?’
‘I don’t think so, sir,’ she says, as if to suggest such a thing is tantamount to an invitation to the Dark Arts.
We are rather drunk, and it is a hot night.  The bedroom is stultifying.  He strips without shame in front of me, flops onto the bed in just his boxers.  In the bathroom, I change into my t-shirt and shorts.  He knows better than to try and persuade me to shed my last upper layer, even in this heat.  We lie on top of the bedding with the windows wide open, listening to the sounds of the night, the tips of our fingers touching.
Wrapped John in his long arms and his tweed overcoat.
John-Matthew looks at him shrewdly.  It’s the same clever look that Josh Bennett had.
I was destined to be with Sherlock.
‘Your parents are apparently sure of God, just as you are equally sure that they will not understand your desire to explore the world.  However, both conclusions are spurious until you have collected and tested the data.’
Having arrived in Sussex, Sherlock and John set out to meet their clients, the parents of the missing boy.
I have to sit on the bonnet of the car and wait outside the public conveniences for Sherlock, who seems notably compromised in the bladder department this morning.  He’s been three times since we got into town.  The sun is getting high and it will be lunchtime soon.  Luckily I’m not hungry, because if we are proposing to hike up the river, lunchtime will be a distant memory before we get near a café again.  Presently Sherlock ambles out and crosses the road, stopping the traffic as usual.  He never goes anywhere without parting the Red Sea.  I find myself smiling at him fondly as we climb back into the car and set off for the ring road.
But the look in his eyes says, ‘why not?’
‘I’m sorry, sir, it’s all we have available.’
‘Mmm.’
‘No, no, its-‘  I can barely speak.  My whole body is singing with the ghost of his tingling touch.
Sherlock takes out John-Matthew’s book and shows it to her.  ‘We’re trying to find the boy you sold this to,’ he says, pointing out the neatly inscribed name inside the front cover.  She starts looking worried.
‘I will.’
I sit up in bed and grumble, rub my eyes.  Sherlock moans and turns over.  He’s invariably useless first thing in the morning.  He’s an owl, I’m a lark.  Not that I vault out of bed, either.  I pull on some clothes, pick up my wallet from the bedside table and plod downstairs to meet the young man in the crisp navy blazer who has come to hand over my hire car.  When I get back to our room, the sashes have been flung open to let the morning air in, and I can hear the shower running.  I flop onto my back on the bed and close my eyes to doze until Sherlock has finished in the bathroom.  I must have dropped into a really deep sleep because the next thing I know I am waking with a shock at something dripping on my face.
‘Excuse me,’ I call to her.  She stands up.  Her bleached hair is knotted crudely atop her skull.  Her skin is tanned, her belly striped with the stretch-marks of pregnancy, but she seems delightfully un-self-conscious.  It is not till she stands up, of course, that I realise she is naked from the waist up, but by then it is too late.  And it really doesn’t help my poor genitals.
I told him that the difference between bravery and stupidity was a very thin line, mostly comprising of whether you survive or not.  I told him I knew this for certain because I’d seen it happen to other men on the battle field.  I knew because it happened to me.  I was lucky enough to survive it.  Most people don’t.  But I know what it really was.  Idiocy and luck.  That’s all.  Sherlock had been trying to be brave, to save us all.  He got away with it.  That didn’t mean I didn’t know exactly what he’d been doing up there on that bloody roof.  Which was, not to put too fine a point on it, being an idiot.  Still, he gave his life to save mine.  I’d have done the same.  That was why I took him back.  That and the fact that he is as elemental to me as the air I breathe.  More, perhaps.
I’m really not sure quite what relevance this has to his earlier statement, but I think he is trying to engage the lad’s interest in physics and philosophy.  But then he continues:
‘You will orgasm on the spot when you see it.’
‘I knew you’d find me in the end,’ he says.
Foetal.
It has been five years since I met him.  Nearly six since I was shot.  In that time, I have slept with a number of women.  Not one of them has seen me without a t-shirt.  Having sex while clothed, at least on the top half of the body, is not as bothersome as you might think, though it can be rather frustrating.  Still, it is a sacrifice I am willing to make for my own privacy, and for my partners’ peace of mind.  I don’t want them to see what is under there.
‘Yeah.’
He takes a minute to look carefully, to really see.  It is what I’d expect if him.  Then his eyes brim.
were not my area.  There is a difference.’
?’  (I emphasise my own last word.)
‘Yes, as I thought.’
The Bee House was finally ours.
‘You’ll thank me when it’s done and you can play in your lovely new lab.’
She goes rather pink.  ‘He was a bit weird, if you know what I mean.’  Her heavy blonde hair flops over her face.
I realise he is fumbling with my fingers, curling them in his own.  We have never walked hand in hand before.  It’s nice.
His hand lifts from my chest, touches my jaw, turns it for me since I won’t turn it myself.  Now I can’t help looking into his face.  Dear God, I’m finished now, I really am.
And no man could commit suicide more easily than him.  He would know exactly how to do it, the surest, quickest, most painless way.  I know he can do it.  He’s done it once already.
Our boys finally get properly down to it.
‘Honour thy father and thy mother,’ Mrs Allen says in disbelief.
Sherlock made tea.
‘Bees,’ he said.  But I knew what he
‘Spontaneous orgasm.  Documented side effect of certain SSRI antidepressants.  Trust me on this one.’
‘I came down your throat,’ I manage.
I nod, smile.  ‘Yep.’
‘It’s not that I’m not enthusiastic at the prospect, but can we have a pause for a bit of affectionate foreplay first?’
‘What do you think?’
Okay, that’s it, I’m done.
There’s nothing wrong me, I realise.  I’d fuck her in a minute, given the chance.  She’s gorgeous.
"And you, if you try to move only one muscle, when I finish the bandage, I swear that I rub you", I was tired and I had enough of these barbaric methods. I wanted to make it feel that I too was worth something that I was a man like all of them.
"I did it." He gave a short laugh as he continued eating.
"And now it hurts you?!" I asked sarcastic.
"Good God!! At least I hope I gained Colum's trust. "
Well! That's all I can do. The rest depends on you. " He made one of his half smiles as he squared me from head to toe. Turning away I perceived her gaze upon me behind my shoulders. I climbed into the saddle and followed him up too.
"I wanted to say that you get inflamed, with fever and swelling".
"What's up now," said Victor, annoyed.
"Ah ... no I do not need your help, for the moment. I thought it was time to take you back, until you were still able to stand up. "
"I won't go with you," I threatened him.
Exciting
"There's enough food in this room to feed a regiment," he said, perplexed.
"The woman you helped explained to us what you did for her son. So he decided you already served your punishment. "
"Because I beat you and now get off you," I stared at her provocative gaze.
Arriving at the wooden throne next to his wife and his son Colum began to speak in Gaelic, it was obvious that I did not understand a single word of what he was saying to his people, but it seemed something very profound and sincere.
The way out
"Germany?"
"Satan is pleased to make fun of God, but God will have the last word" so saying Father Baen came out of the house and slammed the door.
"Keep boy, rinse your mouth with this! It will clean the cuts and cure the pain. Thank you boy for what you did, "the lady looked at me adding "Larye is my niece you know ?!"after saying this turned around, she left the room.
"I also know that if your last escape attempt failed miserably, you still have in mind the idea of running away. How do I know?! You can read it in your eyes. "
"Did you miss it by accident?" he inquired with a sarcastic tone and half a smile on his lips. I didn't answer him, but I stepped back. The man was covered in blood and I noticed that his arm was no longer wearing a bandage. The man with a leap descended from the horse, approaching me. I noticed that it was very high, it certainly exceeded my tonnage, but I was also able to fight and it seemed that these people had the nerve to underestimate me.
"Here I know that Leazy and Tamas are not the first ones to fall ill or die after being here. To tell the truth if you visit the Black Church and survive to tell it, then you are a real man. I did it as a boy and nothing happened to me, but my cousin was possessed and fell ill for a week. "
When we found ourselves eating next to the fire, I sat apart clearly uneasy in sitting with them. To exclude me the most they used Gaelic. In those moments I felt more alone than ever.
"Is it possible that it was high in the hierarchy of the time to exert such influence as the Duke of Sandringham?"
"Come here..." Frank grabbed me and threw me back on the bed, wrapping me in a hug.
"Obviously, I promise."
"I would not risk any of these men, including you being taken prisoner by him. If you don't put me in a riding condition, you'il leave me here with a loaded gun. So I will determine my destiny. " After those words I scrutinedto him for a few moments, undecided on how to interpret that man. Tighten the bandage as much as possible.
After making sure that Tamas was well, I returned to Lehoc, to keep Mr. Holmes company in the stables.
"Yup"
"Pity all this without being able to share it" I said mischievous, to which Frank glanced up at me.
"Do you know Moriarty?" asked suspicious.
I took courage and knocked on the door. The woman opened up, on her face the tiredness and the accumulated stress was clear, given by the pallor and the eyes very evident.
"Tremble so hard that you make me tremble too" said these words touching his face to the hairline of my hair, behind my neck. I felt my face becoming red with embarrassment, this man was making me feel a feeling of insecurity and frustration.
Sherlock caught me again by surprise and started laughing. I felt my hands clasp my hips and realized the position in which we found ourselves. From the shame, I felt my face flush.
As soon as I had finished preparing, Mrs. Hudson took me to the main room where Colum's guests would take their oaths.
"Here I was wondering if ... you had a potion that could open a boy's heart to a girl."
"I know the paths and the plan of the castle by heart, I even know how many sentries there are and they do not scare me."
"You do not know anything about me," I snarled at him furiously.
Dougal escorted me into the room, where a week ago Frank had made love. I had a bad feeling.
"Behold, seeing that man in the manner in which he peered out of the window, I thought he might be a man met during the war. There would be nothing wrong if you had sought comfort from someone else, "Frank's words hurt me more than I thought.
"Only if you try to leave", he added at last, leaving the room, locking the door.
The next morning I met Victor Trevor in the garden of the castle, to collect some useful herbs and flowers in our medical dispensations.
"Well... I hoped that once we were here..." was definitely nervous but I pretended to nothing and took the opportunity to try to make him laugh.
"Saxon you have to eat, your face is pale, it would be able even a Czech to notice that you have clearly lost weight since we left, you barely touched food. You have to get back into force if you want to survive, "he said, staring straight into my eyes.
"Wait, let me check your shoulder."
"Try not to get whipped or stab today. It would be perfect as a thank you, for my efforts to keep you alive”, I mentioned a smile.
As I approached the little house where the creature's screams came from, I saw from the window that the mother held the baby in her arms, trying to make the baby suckle without success.
At that instant the Reverend and Frank entered the room.
"See you later on the oath?"
"I'm fine I'm just stunned."
"Franck, ah..." I bit the inner thigh where he knew I was more sensitive.
"What would it be like to say on the road?" I asked.
"I share my blanket with you because you're trembling," she whispered in my ear.
"It would have been a shame, for the girl to be beaten in front of everyone. It would take a long time to get over it. For me it's easier. It hurts, but it's nothing serious. In a couple of days, I'll be like new. Thanks to your exceptional care Watson. "I wiped his face with a cloth, while Mrs. Hadson appeared with a tray. She handed Holmes a hot drink.
At that moment, one of Dougal's thugs broke into the house from the door.
"But wait... Wasn't Sandringham accused of being a Jacobite? "asked Frank.
"Yes, a little," I admitted. "It's all very fascinating, thank you for showing me. But if you want to excuse me now, I have a chariot that I have to take, "I said with annoyed tone.
"This bandage is irritating my skin; would you mind checking it?"
(>-<)
"Sssh... Hush Johnny. This is our moment. I want to hear again your sounds of pleasure, when you get to the limit, I want to hear you panting under me, I want the marks of your nails on your back, I want your skin moist with sweat against mine and I want it now, "I was panting heavily after those Words, while he had begun to lick my penis with devotion. And I was already lost in a bubble of pleasure. While I was groan under his control, I had not even noticed that he had stripped himself and that he had uncorked a bottle of ointment that he wore in his trousers pocket. He put a little on his right hand and with the other he made me widen my legs.
"The first time I tried to escape from Fort William and the second one for theft, at least that's what they said."
"Oh... very well let's take a look," exclaimed the Reverend.
"It was my grandmother who taught me that. Finish your tea and see what it tells us, "said this I hastened to finish the tea, and put on the cup. The lady turned it around a bit and turned it upside down on the saucer and after a few moments turned it over and looked at the bottom. She was very focused.
"Frank..." I sighthe name, his voice I missed so much.
"Usually those who drink it with Colum get drunk after the second cup."
Victor approaches us.
"Let's go Saxon, it's not the right night to get away, come I'll take care of your lodgings" he finally exhorted me with a calm smile, and I only managed to follow him in silence, just worried just by the fact that in all probability I would not be never managed to get back to Frank.
Finally, Holmes bowed to Colum and staggered off and hurt. I joined him in the kitchens to check how he was.
"And when will you not be there?" I asked quietly.
Nobody spokes to me and the whole group looked at me as if they wanted to slaughter me from one moment to another.
"Look there's a door, let's see where it leads" with a little effort together we were able to open it.
"Do you think it's a trouble for him?"
A few moments later, turning, he looked at me questioningly, almost suspiciously. I did not feel at all comfortable. Until then I had not realized that I was shaking, my clothes were torn from rain and mud, I was full of tears and now my shirt was definitely to be thrown away.
"It's healing well, there's no inflammation," I heard Holmes lightly approach my neck, as if he were breathing my scent. I felt myself blushing, I moved away after looking him in the eyes, I knew I was certainly blushing under my gaze.
"I am an educated man, if I can be frank. Maybe not as educated as you are. But I had a very good preceptor. He taught me Latin and Greek and much more. Not children's stories of fairies, devils and aquatic monsters of the lakes. "I laughed.
The first who came forward to pronounce his oath was Dougal MacKenzie. He drew his dagger from its sheath and said:
"Would not you do it for me?" He asked with a mischievous note, which I wanted to pretend not to have grasped.
"This is not ramsis, it is convallaria maialis, also called lily of the valley."
"Where did you say you found him?" he asked, addressing my savior, who stood behind me.
"Come on," the eldest man grabbed me by the arm dragging me beside the horse of the boy I had cared for.
"Seriously?"
"How would it be 'too'? V-you want to say ... "once again I did not have time to finish the sentence, I was left behind.
With clenched teeth I pushed him away and said "no I don't."
"I ... I'm so sorry. It must have been a horrible experience, "I told him, unable to form an equally comforting sentence for him. Sherlock started moving and I blocked him.
"Hit by you?" I asked.
That evening when we were all at the table in the central hall, in front of me sat Holmes.
"I didn't know the Celts had made trips to Africa," I said I almost enjoyed it.
The elder will square me with wrath before I speak.
"OhI I see! Well! So, I think this is a goodbye?! "I realized only in that moment, that I would not see him again and this was a blow too strong, when I spoke, I gave an almost choked sound.
"Of course,"
Mrs. Hudson knocked on the door before entering.
Finally, I took the jar and I invited the woman to do exactly what I had done a few moments before.
"He is John Watson, Mrs. Hudson!" The young man introduced me. "Marthag found it in the woods and Dougal said to take it with us so ...".
"What's your name?"
"You're a nice guy. Are you threatening the person who is trying to help you? This is so little gentleman. "
During my breaks, I went to the kitchen by Mrs. Hudson, where I knew Dougal's spies perennially to drink.
We reached the castle of Leoch, where I had been just two days before with Frank. At that moment I realized that my journey had just begun.
I was exhausted and hungry but if I had to fight, I would have done it even at the cost of my life. At that moment I did not think about Frank at all, but about these poor people.
"Well now I have to get back to work. Thank you for food and bandage, Mr. Watson, "he smiled.
"But when the boys come to this place to show manhood what exactly do, they do?"
"The redcoats! Wiped twice in a week, "Sherlock said, understanding my discomfort.
The next day, the wagon arrived to take me back to Inverness, but when I went to get there, Dougal appeared and told me that Colum wanted to see me. And that was a bad sign, something told me that I could not get on that damned chariot.
I managed to reach the stables unharmed and without being seen, I thought I had already reached freedom.
"Almost all have been chosen"
We arrived shortly after, at the meeting point.
"I have a feeling he's turning everything."
(>-<)
"Excuse me, did you say exorcism?" I asked worriedly.
"This I would say it was obvious, I wanted to know what accusation?!" I asked hesitantly.
When I reached the Black Church, it was not as I expected it.
"Why the whip?" I asked.
"Mrs. Hadson who is that lady?" I asked in the end curious and worried at the same time.
"I've never had a doubt," he finally exclaimed, laughing.
"And do you also know that there are guards in the woods? Are you going to face them alone? "He began to laugh, I had the impression he was making fun of me, the bastard.
We waited a few moments, hoping the antidote would take effect. And then the boy slowly opened his eyes.
"But of course I understand. I hope you will join us for the feast of Samhain? "asked the Reverend.
(> - <)
"Yes, well he's bragging about bringing a healer to the castle. I doubt he will let you go quickly. "
"I will never take orders from a woman" was absolutely contempt in the words of Father Baen. "This child is a servant of Satan and must be cleansed, or his soul will be condemned to eternal damnation," his father said ferociously.
"No," my voice came out weakly, almost a whisper.
"Mister Holmes? Did not you think I needed help the last time I saw you together?! "I said, while she was obviously embarrassed.
"Apparently Tamas Baxter went to the Black Church with little Lensy MacNeel. So now he too is invaded by the same evil spirits. "
"Mom!" He whispered.
(> - <)
"All right if I have to, I might as well have fun" taken from the pocket that I had at the belt the Port of Victor in which I had put the valerian and took a sip and offered it to him.
"I do not think so."
"Should I just beat you?"
Happy holidays to everyone! I hope you have a happy Christmas.
"You're definitely optimistic," I approached the bed watching Frank a little mischievous.
"Ah understood! And you also know how to do it in these cases? "She asked me.
"Colum's maid," Mrs. Hadson replied.
Sherlock leaned over and started untying himself from the wheel. His face was so close that I could feel his breath on my face. I found myself staring at him fascinated. His gaze met mine and for a moment I held my breath. Time seemed to stop. His lips seemed to me the most beautiful thing my eyes had ever seen.
"I was helping her since no one was here."
(-.-)
"Why at least we'll have fun creating scandal in this little country, with all the squeaks we'll be using this old bed," Frank said while he was laughing amused.
"Stop immediately to say unbecoming things," my heart was beating wildly and Sherlock was definitely having fun behind me.
"I know who he is but I have never talked to her"
"Exactly, at least you are not afraid? In that case I will drag you to your rooms with great satisfaction ".
"Here ... if I remember correctly it was OSTRUCTURE", while he was talking, I was trying to wrap his shoulder wound.
"I'll be back in a few minutes to check and see you're ready by then," she told me, disappearing behind the door.
So saying, he stood up and held out his hand, though I grasped it with indecision to get up. He took my bag and motioned for me to follow him, but I was still not sure I would want to give up my escape, after so much effort. I found myself staring at the stable exit.
Frank looked me in the interrogative eyes and I think heI understood my fear, so i look away looking for attention elsewhere,. but then Frank turned my face to him look straight into my eyes.
"Frank, I didn't..." tried to get away for a moment, for fear. I was no longer the same guy who had departed to help in the war. I was back broken and poorly reduced. On the body I had scars and signs that would never go away and especially the bullet hole on the left shoulder, not pleasing to the eye. I feared that once he had seen me he would have escaped disgusted.
"Why did you do it?" I asked angrily, the more I knew about this man the less I could understand him.
I reached the house of the sick boy and found Father Baen uttering some prayers, while he made the sign of the extreme anointing on the forehead of the boy, who was breathing weakly, his face now pale.
Dougal's plan was to go to the various clans and collect taxes. Wandering through the villages I remained enchanted by the tranquility of their everyday life. The air we breathed was similar to the harmony I had experienced as a child when I played on my uncle's country estate. Too bad that my walks always ended up being pulled by an arm by one of Dougal's henchmen, to be able to keep an eye on. I had never been so violent and uncooperative with those who held me hostage for their comfort.
She frowned.  ‘You mustn’t say anything,’ she said.
.  Just you, John.  Only ever you.’
She sighed, obviously feeling she had put up enough of a fight to satisfy any karmic forces that she’d had no choice.
‘As attractive as that offer is, they’re coming with the steel girders for the bathroom floor tomorrow morning, and I need to be here.’
‘Josh is a very quiet boy,’ she says in a gentle voice.  She is blonde, very similar to the woman I lusted after in the street earlier, well kept and well dressed.  ‘He doesn’t make friends easily.  He and John-Matthew just seemed to get on together.’
‘We’re looking for Jonny,’ Sherlock smiles.  ‘Rhiannon sent us.’
‘Good point.’
‘Exactly,’ Sherlock says, sipping at his tin mug.  ‘How can anybody assume any course of action is the sole one, in the face of the Ineffable?’
, making our love nest habitable.’
‘Enough to retire here?’
‘How so?’   Sherlock asks.
‘Because he’s as subtle as a brick, right?’
I try not to groan.  After all this time, I’m still not used to the things Sherlock has deleted from his hard drive.
‘I like you.’  He thrusts his hips up against my downward stroke.  ‘Oh, yes.’
‘Subtle as a brick through a windscreen,’ I agree.  ‘We’re trying to find John-Matthew and we wondered if you could help.’
He murmurs something, moves against me, and that’s when I feel it.  A hard ridge of turgid flesh digs into my hip.
‘Sure?’
We snatch up our clothes and I follow him into a little glade of silver birches.  The grass is long and thick here, but there are mercifully no nettles.  He drops his bundle on the ground and turns to me, eyes brazen.
‘There,’ I said to myself, and the brambles clustering around the fence.  ‘We’re ready for business.’
‘The Bee House.’
In which John has a very tasty lunch and a sexual identity crisis.
‘No one’s immortal, even you, much as I would love it to be true.  Your body will die, even if the idea of you remains.  Besides, I’m in the books too.’
‘Well, I didn’t know anything, did I?  I certainly didn’t know where he’d gone off to.’
Lost to the world, lost to everything other than this man’s divinely talented mouth, this man who has always been my friend, who is now my lover, I drift on a sea of sensation.  I don’t know why I thought that mouth, that tongue, those lips, could be anything other than talented.  Clever, clever Sherlock.  In my mind’s eye, I suddenly glimpse the future, our future; hours and years of horizontal ecstasy stretch out before me, of us losing ourselves in one another’s bodies, and I mentally take a moment to kick myself for being such a bloody fool as to actually put this off.
‘Is it lovely?’
‘So are we staying another night?  After tonight, I mean?  Or going back?’
‘Hmmm.’
It is hot.  Baking, in fact.  I’ve yomped miles in worse heat, in Iraq for instance, but today I’m older and my knees aren’t up to it anymore.  Sex takes it out of your knees – an under acknowledged fact.  And right now, Sherlock has managed to fuck my knees up good and proper.  Not that I wouldn’t do the same again given the chance (and I sincerely hope I
Presently the woman comes over, still partially naked, like an English amazon, carrying a tray on which are three enamel mugs of tea.
‘No.’
Now I know, lying here, looking up at the love of my life, that it is extremely unlikely that I will ever sleep with another woman.  Apart from those conducting my medical treatment, no one has seen my wound.  I have concealed it from my lovers because I feared that they would be repulsed.  I have concealed it from Sherlock because I know he will read it and know what it means.
‘Oh.’
Sherlock made tea.
‘They wanted me to become a barrister.’
‘I can’t bear to think of your beautiful body dying.’
I drew the line at thatch.
‘Just be gentle,’ I tell him.  I am shaking.  The emotion of this is threatening to overwhelm us both.
‘Oh, him,’ I say, before I’ve even thought about it.  ‘But sometimes I ask the questions.’
There is a cry in the night.  I open my eyes and realise it isn’t me.  Which is something of a turn-up for the books, because believe me, it’s
He takes a couple of loping strides through the long grass, and slithers down the river bank.
‘Yes, but is it in?’
The Bay Tree Café is in a side street.  We sit in the back garden.  Actually, to call it a garden is a bit of a misnomer.  It’s a back yard, but since the building is on the side of the hill, it has an excellent view of the bottom of the town and the river.  The food is excellent, and roses flower on the pergola that shades us from the late lunchtime sun.  Sherlock is absorbed in the file while I eat.
I don’t turn my head.
‘It’s not dying that matters,’ I whispered into his ear, his delicate, beautiful pink ear, cupped in mahogany curls.  ‘It’s the living that counts.’
Only Sherlock could live a life containing two successful suicides.
Sherlock has morning wood.
‘I tried to warn you.’
I watch him as he reads.  Frowning.  His curls flop over his face.  There are fragile lines around his eyes now, little crinkles etched over the tops of his cheekbones that weren’t there when we met.  For a moment I wonder what he will look like as an old man.  I imagine his hair white, swept back from his forehead, cheeks as sculpted as ever, eyebrows bristling like barbed wire.  His mouth will still be beautiful, that pinched upper lip, the square, cushioned lower one.  And something happens to me then that I never expected to experience, never dreamed would happen.
