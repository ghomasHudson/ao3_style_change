“Don’t let these books mess with your head, man. If Jack was pissed or whatever, he’d tell you. It sounds like he didn’t want to make it a big deal.”
Dean resisted an eyeroll, “I ruined your plans, and after you gave up Brown. I just didn’t want you to make the same mistake, for my sake, with this Stanford stuff. So I tried to keep it casual between us, but then I screwed that up, too.”
What a question. Dean was almost shocked into laughter, but Cas looked on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He kept it serious.
He heard a chair creak, then pages flipping. Sounded like they were getting back to work. He waited.
“I thought about it,” Dean’s voice broke. Sam was shocked, “If he’s still in the Empty...I would do anything to save him. I’m so fucking worried about him. But first we have to try everything else.”
“Listen… We tried the ritual. It didn’t work. I can try it again, but maybe you should, I don’t know. Go take a break. Go live your life, you know. You’ve earned it.”
Eileen reached for the burgers and started passing the plate around. Sam handed out paper plates and napkins.
“This is stupid,” Dean glared but lit the scented candles anyway. Sam sprinkled chocolate shavings onto the mark he drew on the ground.
Which was also turned to ash, as well as the plate it was on. Great. Thank god that stupid dog wasn’t in here. Or Cas’s jacket.
“Come on, Dean-o. You must’ve figured that out by now. He’s not exactly subtle. And Christ, he turned down Brown for you.”
“You said you think you love me. But you’re not used to sex without feelings. Sometimes you sleep with a friend to see what it’s like. Remember my roommate Benny? We hooked up for months.”
“We’d love to help your research but first. . . maybe you should tell us about your personal workout routine,” said a young woman with dyed blonde hair and glasses.
“When the Leviathans were after us, and you walked into that lake and died,” Dean said, without hesitation. “I found your trench coat, just floating, and that was when I realized.”
As soon as Dean pulled into the driveway, Cas jumped out of the car. He’d called Sam and Eileen several times but it always went straight to voicemail.
“You’re pathetic, and you know what? That’s why you’re alone. You’re pathetic and scared to honestly tell people how you feel.”
“I know what really happened,” Gabriel said, “They finally hooked up and then Cassie, always the puritan, was like now we can’t live together until we’re married, and kicked Dean to the curb.”
Dean parked in front of Ed’s. The sun had set during their drive, but it was too bright in the shopping center to see any stars. Their parking spot was close enough to the door that the red neon light of the “Ed’s Diner” sign hit the front of the impala.
“I’m trying to be a good father for my son. And maybe you can’t recognize that because you’ve never seen it before.”
“Life is all about making our own choices. And getting to write our own endings. And this is what I want Dean.”
“I don’t mean to interrupt, but I need another book,” Dean stepped out of the hallway, and everyone turned, “since I’m the only one doing any freaking work around here.”
Cas stepped forward, “I know. I’m sorry. I should’ve been honest from the beginning. I was trying to help but—”
“Who the hell did you invite?” Dean pulled his arm free. This special someone explained the special dinner. He tried not to jump to any conclusions about Cas’s mystery guest.  Maybe it was just an old friend. But why would he keep that a secret—
“If you want to call her, you should,” Cas said, perfectly casual. And just to prove how fine everything was, he took a long sip of his latte.
On Christmas morning, Sam confessed he had feelings for Shannon. She kissed him under the mistletoe and wondered what took him so long.
“Well yeah, but that’s just one option. Remember when you found him married to that woman in Colorado? He could’ve been sent there, a place he had a strong emotional connection to.”
Dean was still alone. But there was nothing left to say. He didn’t finish the Lord’s Prayer, but he didn’t want to.
Dean was great with kids. He’d helped raise Ben, but Ben was older. He’d basically raised Sam, but raising Jack was different. He wasn’t raising him alone. It made some things easier, like when he woke up at 2 am to the sound of crying, he and Cas could trade off baby duty. It made other things harder, like starting a new relationship.
“I knew they hooked up this whole time, and I never said anything.” Charlie said smugly, “I’m great at secrets. This is exactly why Cas told me he applied to Stanford.”
“Sam, we don’t have time for—Dammit kid, get off my leg.” Dean took a few steps, but Henry didn’t let go.
“Okay, run me through your list again, and let’s figure out where to go first. Maybe we should start driving now and figure it out in the car.”
Dean shrugged off his hand, then turned around and dropped his jacket on the back of the kitchen chair. He knew Sam was right. Probably.
That night Cas went over to the Winchesters at eight o’clock. Dean answered the door. After a painfully awkward intro of ‘hello dean’ and ‘hey’, Cas cut to the chase.
Dean couldn’t believe Jack bought that line. Did he really think Cas spent time befriending civilians over beer pong? Jack picked up the menu in front of him but continued to study Chad over the edge. Maybe Dean should’ve made him watch Animal House. It’d be less of a culture shock.
He pushed open the door and led Eileen inside. It was pitch black. Sam felt along the wall for the light switch and threw his carry-on bag on the couch.
“I’ll bet,” Dean said, since Cas wasn’t listening, his eyes locked on Claire, “You, uh, hunt with Claire and Kaia?”
Cas gave Dean a subtle nudge. He got the hint and slid into booth next to Chad. Jack slid into the other side, so he was directly across from
“This is Jack,” Cas explained, “Well, the human parts of him. When Jack brought me back, he left me with this child.”
“I guess you still have something to learn about being human,” Dean said, slowly walking toward them. Claire and Cas turned to him, but Dean was looking straight into Cas’s eyes when he said, “When you love someone, their problems aren’t a burden. You want to help them, because they help you, too, just by being themselves. Just by being in your life. I don’t feel sorry for you, Cas. I feel—”
Dean folded his arms. Then he threw his arms down, “We don’t have time for this. Look, I need some ancient Mayan artifacts to portal— I’ll explain later.”
“—and, Dean. After my actions and the rather unconventional twists and turns my life took this past decade, I believe this is where I deserve to be. I will spend the rest of my days here, in this hell within a hell, reflecting on the life I led and knowing that you and Sam are out there, alive and well. It is the best ending I could have ever hoped for.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Chad pulled at the collar of his shirt and eyed the sigil carved into his chest. He couldn’t be detected, but he couldn’t use his powers either. “Hey, can you change the color of my vessel’s hair? When I followed Castiel to campus, I saw a human with, like, bright blue hair—”
His back was to Cas, but Cas could tell he was angry. Jack’s shoulders were tense, and his hands pressed against the mattress. Light flickered around him, filling the air with the buzz of his powers.
Dean looked back at the cake. He needed to get out of here before he accidently made a sudden movement and sent the whole thing toppling. He stepped around Cas and walked to the other end of the table.
They didn’t have a big fight again until freshman year of high school. It was the first year Cas attended public school. It was also the year his parents died in a car crash and Michael, his 20-year-old brother, applied for custody of Gabriel, Cas, and Anna. His homelife was a mess, and he had to assimilate to public school, which was slightly less confusing than moving to another planet. At least he had Dean to guide him. When Cas didn’t know what to wear, or what to say when someone asked to copy his homework, or how to survive P.E., Dean was always happy to help.
“No. He doesn’t want to be found. I think… it’s for the best. He’s better off without me. Let’s just go home.”
Cas put a hand on Dean’s. “Are you sure? I don’t want to pressure you if you’re not ready. And this is very last minute— we’d probably have to drive down tonight. We could wait. Maybe we should.”
It hit the cake straight on, like the red frosting was a bullseye. The cork got stuck halfway through the top tier of cake, and the rest was completely drenched in champagne.
He drove for about an hour, according to the clock in his car which was apparently still working. He turned on the radio and was pleasantly surprised it still worked and still got classic rock.
Kelly explained that she and Malia were dating, and Logan joined them on a particularly challenging siren case in Florida. The three worked well together, as a sort of little family. They loved each other dammit, and they all bonded over their shared admiration of certain pair of hunting brothers, wink wink. Kelly wasn’t very subtle.
It changed everything. Usually he wasn’t a big fan of change, but this felt so natural and right and good. He felt so confident. This wasn’t how he usually felt the morning after, especially recently. But trailing kisses down his neck, smiling against his stomach, waking up in his arms, it all felt like the most natural thing in the world. Like Dean was right where he was supposed to be.
Castiel felt sick to his stomach. How could he possibly think like that? He didn’t want anyone else. Castiel just wanted the person he’s meant to be with, like everyone else. Why couldn’t it be simpler than this?
“Dammit, Cas. You don’t get it. My entire freaking life, everyone I have ever loved or cared for has died at my hands. There’s nothing left for me, nothing besides you and Sam. He used to be my only reason for living, but that was because he needed me. I was always there to keep him safe like our father couldn’t. But now he’s got your brother to take care of him. I’m not needed anymore.”
Dean lifted his finger and placed it on Castiel's lips. “No buts.” He forced himself to lay down, closing his eyes. He let himself ease into the couch when Castiel laid beside him. He was shocked that the other teen had decided to, but he was grateful nonetheless.
Honestly, Jack didn’t seem too eager to devour worlds. Castiel and Dean seemed cool, too. Chadiel stopped that line of thinking. He’d trained for this mission for years, and to prepare himself for life in this vessel, he’d been raised on American college movies. He couldn’t let his guard down around Dean just because he had an appreciation for humans. He would not fail Heaven the way Castiel had.
“I want to give a toast that’s nothing like my brother— short and sweet.” He got a few chuckles. He cleared his throat again, and continued, “Sam and I have been through a lot of hard times together. Our whole lives, really, but even just these last 15 years… we’ve had some crazy shit thrown at us. And we’ve survived it all— mostly. We survived. Sam’s my baby brother but the truth is, I’ve always looked up to him. I used to think life was all about the hunt. I was just a tool, that had to be sharp and ready to kill. Sam was the first person in my life that showed me life can be about so much more. Your life can be about anything you want it to be. Don’t get me wrong— I love the hunt. And sorry Sam, but I’ve got a new hunting partner, and he kicks ass. And he doesn’t bitch about my music all the time. Only half the time.”
Both boys had a stack of candy wrappers in front of them. They eagerly grabbed the chocolate, twisted the paper around it, and placed it back on the belt. So far, so good.
His mouth quirked up at the corner and he leaned even closer, one hand braced on the back of her chair so he could whisper in her ear.
Sam opened his mouth, but before he could respond, Dean lunged forward to grab a wayward piece of chocolate that had somehow gotten past them.
“I guess I didn’t make myself clear. I thought we were on the same page.” Cas put a hand on Dean’s, “Dean, I think I’m in love with you.”
Chad stood, smiling and relaxed. His mint green button up was rolled up at the sleeves and tucked into his khaki shorts, a lanyard dangling from his pocket. He had broad shoulders and strong jaw, but there was no awareness behind his eyes, like his expression wouldn’t change if he was here or at home or in the pits of hell.
Cas and Jack sat at a small table by the biggest window. The street outside was busy, despite the cloudy, grey sky. People in thick coats walked past, some laughing with each other, some with headphones in, some with serious expressions. Jack loved to people watch. He stared out the window, and Cas joined him.
There was a silence while Dean gathered up the remains of his dinner, and then Sam called out to his back, “Be careful!”
“Alright, fine,” he said. “It sucks. Is that what you want to hear? He’s gone, and I can’t sleep because every time I close my eyes, I see him smiling as that, that
When Sam came out of the bathroom though, he only looked more defeated than before. His eyes were downcast, haunted, until he looked up at Cas with a little grimace.
Sam exhaled as he stared at Dean, his mouth in a thin line. Then he said, “Look, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have...I’m sorry.”
The rest of the drive was a straight shot down I-80, and only about four hours later, they arrived at Half Moon Bay. It was a tourist destination, but not so much in late November.
Of all the times in the world for his brother to pull his head out of his ass, it just had to happen when they were in the middle of a case and he’d been cursed.
She threw herself into his arms as she cried, and he rubbed her back awkwardly. She was young, couldn’t be older than sixteen. How she’d gotten into all this mess was beyond him, but this was the only way it was ever going to end. He had to keep telling himself that as she cried her eyes out against his shoulder.
Dean was two glasses of whiskey in tonight though, and his post-hunt adrenaline was still thrumming through his veins, as well as his irritation from Sam’s earlier comment. It was a dangerous cocktail for recklessness swirling inside him.
He wasn’t sure where Cas was really going with this conversation, but he could tell it was going to be one of the ones that punched him in the throat, emotionally. He was getting better at those conversations, but it still felt a little like slowly peeling off a bandage over an open wound. Vulnerability was never really a defining quality of his.
“Hey,” he said, and Cas looked up at him a little shamefully, like he knew he’d ruined the lighthearted moment. Dean smiled at him. “Me and you? We’re going to grow old, you got that? I’m gonna be a grouchy old man, and I have every intention of making that your problem.”
Sam walked back over to Rowena, who was still gathering things presumably in preparation for the hunt. Cas stayed in place though, and he could just see Dean from around the corner of the bathroom door.
Sam’s face softened as Dean trailed off, the words getting lost somewhere between his mind and his mouth.
“He wouldn’t want this, you know,” she replied finally. It came out quickly like she’d been holding it back for awhile, and he had to really fight the cruel response that sprung to life in his throat.
He looked up from his internal spiral to see Donnie glance at him over his shoulder as he disappeared into the back. Well, this was his chance. He closed his eyes and rapped his knuckles against the bar quickly before pushing the stool back with a metallic scrape against the concrete floor.
He gestured toward Cas with his thumb, and Dean’s gaze followed for just a second until he made eye contact with Cas. Then his face flushed, and he looked away.
Donnie reached out and gently swiped his thumb along Dean’s cheekbone. When he held his hand up for Dean to see, it was wet.
“R for reverse,” he said pointedly, feeling his patience dwindling. He fixed Dean with a hard glare. “Look, I know we’ve been through a lot lately, and it sort of makes me want to get blackout drunk too, but we’re in the middle of a job right now. You have got to pull yourself together.” Dean didn’t look up, just kept staring at the steering wheel like he’d never seen it before. Sam was about .5 seconds away from kicking him out of the driver’s seat. He snapped, “Dean!”
Only an echoing silence responded, so he yelled again. The room didn’t crumble around him under the weight of his fury though. It still stood there, just as it was that night, and he suddenly felt a wave of nausea come over him. It had been a stupid idea to come back here.
And well, that sobered Dean right up. He reached his hand across the table and set it on top of Cas’s, squeezing his palm tightly.
Meanwhile, it hadn’t taken Jack very long to figure out a way into the Empty. He promised to restore the peace and quiet that he’d disrupted, forever, on the condition that Cas could leave for good. The Empty agreed with a condition of its own. In order for Cas to never return, he had to no longer be a celestial being destined for a supernatural afterlife. In the end, Jack held the door open while Dean marched right in and pulled Cas out with him, and with the promise of a new and better world to live in, Cas willingly handed over his grace.
“All that stuff you said about what you’ve done? You’re a good man, Cas” he said. Cas glanced up at him, and Dean continued, “I mean it. Yeah, you’ve done some fucked up shit, but so have I. So has Sam. None of us are perfect.”
“Dean,” he said. Dean whipped around to face him, and Cas continued, “Your name is Dean Winchester.”
There was a chill in the air as they set out the next morning well before check out time. Cas was driving, on the grounds that the motel had run out of the crappy instant coffee it usually provided its guests, and Dean had woken up in a sour mood about it. He pulled off about ten miles down the road at a Love’s to fill up the tank, and when he came back from inside the gas station, he had two large coffees in his hands.
Dean still didn’t look up, at least not right away. He stared out the window to his left, his eyes taking on a worrying glazed look. Then he turned that look on Sam, and his next words sent chills right down Sam’s spine.
She nodded at him and reached for her beer, not really looking guilty as she took a swig. Dean almost cracked a smile at that. She sat it back down and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand before settling into the chair with a graceless flop.
Donnie grinned at him goodnaturedly before glancing down at the other end of the bar, which was becoming very crowded. He sighed and left the bottle of whiskey with Dean as he turned around.
“After he rescued the righteous man, though, he couldn’t quite stay away from him. The man prayed to him for help, and the angel tried to ignore it at first. He even threatened to throw the man back into hell.”
Then, because if he talked about it he was going to freak himself out, he leaned in and captured Donnie’s lips.
Still, Dean was fine, and just to prove it, he threw back the rest of his beer and said, “I’m going out.”
There was a pause as he opened up his contacts to search for Bonnie and Ricardo’s numbers. They were plenty smart enough to handle whatever this was, and besides the brief, instinctual drive to act, he honestly didn’t want to pursue the hunt. For once, there were other things in his life worth spending his time doing.
Dean grinned around a mouthful of cheeseburger at Cas’s long-suffering expression. He maintained the glare for only a few seconds before his small smile betrayed him, and he simply shook his head.
Dean turned to him and grinned around a mouthful of waffles. He had the good manners to at least swallow before saying, “Hiya, Sammy.”
It all felt so fragile, so unreal, that Cas was being allowed to do this. An absurd part of him hoped Dean would remember it, how utterly right it felt to be holding each other close. Cas knew it was for the best though that he wouldn’t. Still, following an impulse that he knew he’d never get to chase again, he brought his hand up and ran his fingers slowly through Dean’s hair just to see what would happen. Dean didn’t protest, so Cas let his nails gently scratch Dean’s scalp, dragging them down to the short hairs on the back of his neck, and he felt relief flood through him when Dean settled heavily against his side, head dropping to his chest with a quiet sigh. Cas just kept running his fingers through Dean’s hair, hoping to anyone who might be listening that Sam and Rowena were getting close to finding the grimoire.
Chad stormed out of the diner. Dean watched him go, but something wasn't right. He thought about going after him with some holy water, but then he saw the look on Jack’s face.
'Listen. I’ll continue with the clues, and I’m serious about  that stupid dance. I’m being forced to go, so I want to make the most of it. But don’t try to find me if you don’t know who I am. It’ll be too late.'
Castiel took this pause as an opportunity to scribble on his arm with a marker. 'Yes! I don’t believe this. Of course I care, I will do whatever it takes to help you. I don’t understand why you think that everyone around you gets hurt, but I can assure you, I will not be one of those people. We would be stronger together. Please. There’s still hope for the both of us.'
Dean stood in front of the stove with a spatula. He whistled to himself as he scrambled eggs in a pan.
Crowley was dressed in a suit, with a freshly trimmed beard and his hair combed back. He looked between Sam and Dean.
“Are you joking? I tried writing down what I wanted to say to you, wrote the date in the corner, and threw up. You’re a man, and an angel, and I’ve never even said I’m bisexual out loud before. I’m freaking terrified.”
“You and Dean will join the workforce for a week, while Cas and I stay at home and take care of things,” Eileen said with smirk. “If Cas and I give in first, you get full control of our next five paychecks. But if you and Dean quit first, you have to check in with us before you buy anything expensive.”
“You know, Eileen is always nagging my ear off about money,” Sam leaned back in his chair, “She’s always saying I shop too much. She just doesn’t get how hard it is to do housework all day. Shopping helps me relax.”
“My mother wasn’t much for domestic work,” Cas explained, “She used recipe books as paper weights.” The audience laughed.
Especially with Cas. Especially since he’d been attracted to Cas since high school, since he accidently walked in on him and that guy and saw Cas looking like a freakin porn star. At first he told himself it was because it was the first time he’d seen something like that in real life, that was all. But then he started noticing Cas getting out of the pool, Cas sprawl on the couch, Cas sipping a drink at the movies. And then he had to accept the facts: his best friend was hot.
“Hi,” Cas put down his book and squared his shoulders. Sam’s bright smile made him feel guilty. Sam had done nothing wrong, but ignoring Dean meant ignoring him too. “It’s good to see you again. How was your junior year?”
The wedding was very small, in Shannon and Sam’s backyard. About a dozen tables were set up in the grass, with family and friends seated around them. Candles flickered on every table, and string lights hung between trees shined above them.
Sam picked at the label of his beer. “We never really talked about what would happen after Cas came back. I mean, is it back to business now? Saving people, hunting things.”
Sam crept slowly inside, wondering if he should risk running back to his car for a better weapon. What if whoever was in here beat him to the artifact? He continued forward.
“Just call me, or even better, just get here. Food’s getting cold. Sam’s already eating without you. Okay. See you soon.”
“I’ve been looking for you,” Dean cut him off. Cas’s blue eyes were bright, but his expression was carefully blank. He didn’t react to what Dean said. At all.
“Alright, boys,” Ellen, the manager of Harvelle’s Candy Factory, led them to the candy conveyer belt where Sam and Dean would be stationed.
He looked over at Cas, smiling in the fluorescent kitchen lights, and it hit him. He could talk to Cas about Stanford, and they could figure out what their future looked like together. No matter what shit hit the fan, or champagne hit the cake, they could find a way to laugh. They could try to be happy together.
An important dinner sounded like Cas trying to say date, but he could practically hear Sam’s condescending
He walked to the bed and sat down. Cas watched him closely. He repositioned himself so he was on his knees.
Sam cut himself off. Maybe he knew Dean couldn’t handle hearing something like that right now. Or maybe he just didn’t know how to end that sentence. Dean certainly didn’t. His feelings for Cas were too big, and jumbled, and time consuming to untangle right now. He needed to focus all his energy on getting Cas back, and not tossing and turning at night because he wasn’t sure if he…
“I don’t know,” Sam turned back to the table and kept his voice low, “I asked both of them, and they refused to say what happened.”
There was Cas, standing in front of a new, black 2020 Honda Accord. There were rows of shiny new cars behind him lit by rows of tall metal lights. His white collared shirt was wrinkled and untucked; his tie pulled loose around his neck. His hair was uncombed, and his eyes were cast downward. He looked deep in thought and tired. He needed a shave.
They had all three pieces. Sam had seven different books open on the table in front of him, as he needed to read all of them simultaneously to get a real understanding of the ritual. His research was held together with sticky notes and red string, but he finally pieced together what he needed to do.
“If you’re really Cas… what’s the last thing you said to me, before the Empty took you?” Dean studied his face carefully.
Chad blinked and held up his hands, “Man, I-I-I don’t know what’s going on here but this is some freaky shit. Are you fucking wizards? Did you fucking drug me?”
“Best. Idea. Ever,” Dean said with a mouthful of pie in the drivers seat. Outside the car, Shannon played an AC/DC song from her phone, Kelly held a cute dog, and Logan and Malia searched the trunk of the impala for anything else that might help.
Cas jumped, “No, no, nothing like that, but it’s okay. He doesn’t have to be a hunter, I would still—“
Dean looked down. He was wearing a white t shirt, red sweatbands, and red gym shorts. He looked back at Sam and shrugged.
Cas smiled, slow and surprised and sweet. Dean looked over at Cas in the passenger seat and put a hand on his knee and pulled over and lowered the seats.
Dean looked up at him, right as he popped the bottle. The cork flew like a bullet, and half the bottle exploded after it like a fire hose.
He missed Cas. He needed to see him, and pull him into his arm, and tell him how much he mattered. He wanted to hold his hand. He wanted to tell everyone, and he wanted to tell Cas. He never got to tell Cas.
“Cas,” Dean put a hand on his arm, efficiently shutting him up. Cas still looked worried, but Dean had an easy smile, “It’s okay. I was fired.”
Dean stepped into the porch light. The circle of light felt private, even though the empty neighborhood stretched out before them, and Cas’ family was on the other side of the door. The cold night air made Cas wish he’d thrown a jacket over his t-shirt, but he refused to shiver. Instead he folded his arms.
“No, no, he doesn’t even know we’re here. I just wanted you and Eileen to meet. And figure out what happened. Did something happen?”
Dean swallowed and stuck his hand on the Joyous Discus on the passenger seat. This time there was golden spark, and Dean and Sam perked up. But the spark quickly fizzled and they were back at square one.
He looked up, but the city was too bright to see any stars. He picked a spot on the endless black sky and decided to pray.
He looked up at the cloudy sky. Sure, he couldn’t see the stars, but that was fine. He would have many more nights on Earth to go star gazing. They wouldn’t call him back to Heaven until he completed the investigation. He knew if his boss had his way, he’d have Jack killed now, but nobody wanted to risk the wrath of Castiel.
“Me? This is clearly about you, and the way you wasted years waiting around for your daddy to tell you what to do. You’re in there trying to play God—”
Dean walked up to him, keeping to the shadow just outside his circle of light. Dean’s heart was pounding. He just spent the last four days thinking about Cas, thinking about what he wanted to tell him, but instead he blurted the first thing that came to mind.
“An ass like that is worth a chance,” Gabriel nodded. Dean nodded back. Gabriel took a bite of cookie. He chewed thoughtfully than said, “I always thought you’d give Cassie a chance. Since he’s in love with you and all.”
“The moment I first saw your soul, the second I laid my hand on you, I knew you were the love of my life.”
Dean didn’t miss a beat. He turned back to Cas and looked at him like he’d just stabbed him in the back.
“Let’s just get this over with,” Dean started walking to the car. There was no way this could end well, but Cas had called him handsome, and earlier he said
Sam was grateful for his spare key. He and Eileen booked a red eye flight from Stanford, and he didn’t want to make Bobby get the door at three AM.
Dean had screwed up with Jack since day one, what the hell made him think he knew what to do now? He should never have tried to give Cas parenting advice. He should have just studied the menu until it was time to order.
The kitchen had two doors. One led to their living room. The other led to the backyard, and it had a small window with a frilly white curtain.
Cas and Charlie took the empty seats next to Eileen. Cas introduced Eileen and Charlie, and it turned out Eileen recognized the Celtic Thunder t-shirt Charlie was wearing. They fell into a conversation about their favorite Irish music, leaving Cas at the mercy of the rest of the table.
“Of course. I mean, you asked me to come before. It was on my calendar and everything. I mean, I didn’t know if you still wanted me to, but…”
They flipped through until they found them— a vampire cult nearby. Sam read the directions, and Dean started driving.
The radio knob could break through the rock, because it was something Dean loved. The Empty fed on happiness or some bullshit like that. The rock could only be destroyed by things that made him happy. That was fine. He needed Cas more than he needed his car.
“Do you think we need more beer for tonight? Cause I could go grab a few cases. Wouldn’t want anyone to go thirsty.”
With his free hand Dean reached for Cas’s chin. He titled his face up, so they could look each other in the eyes.
as soon as he thought it. Really, Cas’s definition of important changed constantly. It could be anything from ‘this is a dinner where I’ll ask you how you feel about me’ to ‘this is a dinner where I’ll try out a new type of pasta, did you know they come in shapes?’
“Perhaps if you knew how difficult it was to,” Cas did air quotes, “‘bring home the bacon’ you wouldn’t spend it quite so thoughtlessly.”
Dean looked toward Cas and gave him a private grin. Cas looked especially ethereal in the candlelight. He smiled back, and Dean couldn’t look away.
“Is that what he told you?” Gabriel had a gleam in his eye, but his smile was sad. Like this was hard to say. Like it was true.
“Right.” It almost felt like Cas was watching them from another table, watching himself screwing up this extremely important conversation between father and son. He knew he needed to support Jack through this, he remembers statements like that from the books, but how? What was he supposed to say? When did Jack even realize he was gay? Was that something Cas was allowed to ask?
Dean didn’t know what to do, so he picked a direction and drove. Cas stared at the dashboard with a vacant expression.
Dean did know what he was trying to say, but it was the last thing he expected to hear. Dean felt his stomach drop and he desperately tried to figure out how the hell Bobby knew. This was different from Gabriel’s usual bullshit. Bobby would never joke about something like this. And he’d never said anything to Dean before. Had he said something to other people? To Sam? How long had he thought Dean and Cas were
But what else was he supposed to do? Live a life alone, with only Cas, the Winchesters and co. as companionship? Jack had a good heart, he was surely capable of falling in love. But love with The Human Bean barista? Maybe Cas was being unfair, after all, Dean slept with waitresses.
Dean stepped out of the shower and ran a towel over his hair. The bathroom mirror was fogged over, so he couldn’t see himself as he brushed his teeth, rolled on deodorant, and spit out his toothpaste. When he straightened up, he ran a hand over the mirror, wiping away just enough to see his face.
Dean stood in front of the mirror in a tux, pulling down his sleeve. He looked himself up and down, doing a last-minute check for cocktail sauce. There were appetizers in the house before the backyard ceremony, so he grabbed a few. Sue him.
When Sam woke up, there was no big breakfast buffet. There was Dean, fully dressed at the kitchen table with a to-go cup of coffee in hand.
“No,” Sam corrected, “I mean, he was worried I would tell you he called. And I didn’t really get a chance to ask him why.”
Sam skidded into the doorway, in a tux and state of panic. “There you are. C’mon, you’re supposed to be standing next to me before we start. And we should have started five minutes ago. Do you have the rings?”
Why did Dean think he could handle this? He wasn’t made for serious relationships. He wanted to date Cas, but it was more important to make him happy. He wouldn’t be happy with Dean for long. No one was. Cas had to go to Stanford.
Michael was out of town which meant Gabriel was throwing a party. Inias showed up with a bunch of his baseball friends, and Cas gripped his water bottle a bit too tightly when he didn’t even glance his way. Dean was too preoccupied by the rest of the snack table to notice.
He stopped himself. Not everything was about him. There were lots of reasons Cas would literally and figuratively throw away a future at Stanford. He had family in Lawrence. He had a job.
Gabriel grinned, “I think I speak for everyone when I say, we’re so happy for you crazy kids. Well, maybe I don’t speak for Lisa.”
“If you spring a feelings talk on Cas, I’ll just have to tell Shannon all about your awkward emo phase. I could probably pull up a picture or two.”
It didn’t happen often, but Cas loved learning new stories from Dean’s past, even when it broke his heart. Even when it made him want to raise John from the dead just to send him back to the grave, even when it made him wish he could’ve saved Dean sooner, from a different sort of hell.
Hours passed, or maybe days. He was starting to get worried this was one of those classic Hell tasks, where you were doomed to repeat the task forever without stopping for food or water or sleep. But he kept going down the stairs, ignoring the screeches and whimpers, and wishing he’d brought a damn flashlight.
“I know! You’re scared of life. You probably planned your feelings talk around your one way ticket to hell, didn’t you? Because you’re scared, Cas, of what I’d say.”
Dean looked down their hands. He could feel the pressure of Cas’s grip. He squeezed Cas’s hand, his flesh and bone. He was real. Dean looked up and found Cas still studying his face.
Until Gabriel pulled the lid off the silver platter, revealing that dinner tonight was Kraft mac n’ cheese with a side of mashed potatoes. Everyone gave him a hard time and Gabriel mumbled something about the price of take out and the price of violinists.
“Okay, fine, Dean I get it. I’ll stop asking. Dean. Dean, I burned those pictures years ago don’t even bother looking. Please.”
“Is that tomorrow?” Cas said quickly, grabbing his jacket and shuffling toward the door, “Wow, I nearly forgot. Happy early birthday.”
Shannon apologized and stood to collect her son. Sam stood too, and went to grab the extra sugar in the kitchen. Shannon, holding Henry in her arms, followed him. Dean left, to either grab the interns or the candles.
Dean and Sam were outside the bunker, with their supplies. Dean had been in a worse mood than usual, but Sam knew he was just nervous about the ritual. To be fair, Sam was too.
“Sure, yeah. Like the way I looked at you. Little things that bothered me, ways I reacted. I can’t believe you had no idea.”
But this morning, for some reason, it was 5AM and he was wide awake staring at his ceiling and thinking to himself,
“Because you didn’t explain. You should have told me when it happened. I shouldn’t find out from Meg.” Eileen left the Roadhouse.
“I wasn’t meant to be a father,” Cas said like he had to pry each word from his throat. He felt a stinging behind his eyes, but he refused to cry. He forced himself to keep watching the road ahead. Dean adjusted his grip on the wheel.
“It’s not,” he said. Cas’s smile faded, and Dean softened, “Look, I know you’re doing this to help Jack. But that, in there, is not helping him. You need to step back and let Jack do this on his own.”
promised to pray before every meal, and you know it! It’s not my fault you misunderstood me. You should’ve got that shit in writing, Jack.”
“Oh,” Laura said, as Gabriel smirked and Garth helped himself to more potatoes, “Sorry I meant Dean and Jo.”
“I’m sorry we’re late. Jack, Dean, I’d like you to meet Chad,” Cas said, stopping at the booth in the corner.
“I need to go talk to her,” Cas said. He almost asked if Dean wanted to come, but Dean was already grabbing his jacket.
“Jack. . . when you said you brought everyone back, you meant Cas, too, right? I know you did. You had to. He cares about you so much, and you care about him. I know you saved him from the Empty. So. . . where is he? Please, make sure he’s safe. Please, send him here. Send him home. To me.”
Cas did not move into a dorm, he moved into an apartment, with a girl in his major named Charlie. He loved living with Charlie. She reminded him of Dean, especially when she forced him to watch all the Star Wars movies and ranted about her crush on Leia. He enjoyed his classes, friends, and books, but there was a Dean Winchester sized hole in his life.
Dean made a break for the kitchen. He opened the door as Ellen screamed from inside. He hesitated in the kitchen doorway.
Sam, Kelly, Logan, and Malia sat around the table to read. Dean grabbed a book and went back to his room, claiming he could ‘focus better’. Sam thought he just wasn’t used to seeing new faces at the table, and wanted to go be annoyed alone.
“I’m sure they’ll be okay. Every couple goes through rough patches, but Sam and Eileen are good for each other. I can’t believe they’d fight like that in the front of all of us, though.”
“Yeah. If you’re stuck on Earth, you should be able to enjoy the finer things in life. Now you just need to get some better taste buds,” Cas looked at him, and he forced himself to look back. He’d put his foot in his mouth, but he managed to pull it out quickly. No way was he going to be the first to blink.
“Charlie, we really missed you,” Sam said as Dean approached. Sam put the phone on speaker and held it between them.
Dean needed some air, and snuck out to the front porch while Cas and Shannon bonded. Sam joined him after a while, two beers in hand.
“—so crazy! I mean it feels like no time has passed, and I have no memories of the afterlife or anything— dude, it’s been five years. Do you know how many Marvel movies I’ve missed? And not to mention—”
At some point in the night Dean managed to fall asleep, and when he opened his eyes his alarm clock read 10 am. He jolted upright, and threw on the first clothes he could grab. He wasted the entire morning on sleep. He pictured Cas’s face, alone and afraid, and practically kicked his bedroom door open.
“Every kid deserves that,” Dean mumbled. He looked up, but his thumb didn’t stop moving, “That’s what you were trying to do for Jack. And sure, you tried way too hard, but better than not trying at all. That’s why— I mean, why I brought that story up. . . you shouldn’t say you’re a horrible father. You’re not. Jack’s a lucky kid.”
The party continued, the lights grew dimmer, and the music grew louder. Dean laughed with friends who understood his pop culture references, Inias played beer pong against a cheerleader, and Cas stood alone in the corner. He slipped away to his bedroom because he didn’t think anyone would notice. He was wrong. Two people noticed.
The whole thing was actually Sam’s idea, although Dean hadn’t taken very much convincing. Truthfully, after Jack took Chuck’s powers and became the new god, they’d all kind of been floundering. The brothers had tried to hunt again at first, but it had been a halfhearted attempt at best that fizzled out after one vamp nest and a garden variety salt and burn. As it turned out, Team Free Will wasn’t actually sure what to do with the free will once they got it. Their singular mission of saving people and hunting things suddenly wasn’t all they had anymore.
They’d spent the last decade or so fighting for this world, and yet he’d never once planned on sticking around to experience it. It was an objectively depressing realization.
He was sitting in front of the mirror, looking into his own eyes with an unsure expression, repeating something to himself like a mantra. Cas stepped closer until he could make out the words.
It took one week for Dean to break down and talk to Cas about what he’d told him before he’d died. To let him know that his love wasn’t one-sided and that he could definitely have Dean, if he really wanted him.
Dean sighed and detached himself from her vice grip in order to sit back and look at her. Her young face was tear-stained, and she looked like the life had been sucked right out of her as she sat back on the ground and placed her head in her hands.
“I may not know everything, but I do know that you’ve saved my life. I know that without you, I won’t ever be content. We need each other, whether you accept that or not, and that’s it. So don’t ever say you aren’t needed again because to me you will always be.”
Sam agreed quietly. Demons were common-- the brothers had already hunted a dozen of those, but this was the first time they’d run into anything about angels. “If you can summon a demon, does that mean you can summon an angel?” Sam asked curiously. “We could ask them about the vics.”
Curiosity pricked at him. He’d seen so many people ice skate on lakes, and he thought it beautiful. Just being able to stand on the surface would be a dream come true. And why couldn’t he? The lake froze in the winter.
“Y’know, Dean, there isn't any food here. I think it would do us both some good to get away from this place. I'm sure I could get Gabe to let us stay over there for a little bit.” Sam honestly still hated the look of the place and had been getting flashbacks of his father ever since he stepped foot into it. He was not about to let Dean become a depressed alcoholic, anyways. Being at the Novak’s might prove to be a little better than he'd originally planned because Dean would feel more at home there.
Letting out a small grunt, he took notes from what he saw on the board, which was quite a distance away, but he could still see it due to his extremely reliable senses.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean mumbled, throwing the towel to the ground. He didn't object because he had already wanted to go there. He wondered if the spiritual connection they shared would be strengthened if Dean lived where Castiel used to. The Novaks’ house was big enough for three dozen people. Surely it'd be okay for the Winchesters to spend the summer there?
A/N: ACKKKKKK! This chapter pains me but it was also exciting to write. What'd you think? Getting kinda close there, huh? We've still got eight chapters. I wonder... ;)
'My father doesn’t want me falling desperately in love with someone. The life I live… It’s very dangerous. You couldn’t possibly understand. If I were to fall for you, I would put you before my duty and he doesn’t want that.'
“Because. I’m guessing that something in your life isn’t going like you want it to, and maybe having your friends turn on you wouldn’t help the situation much. From what I can see, you’re a strong individual. You don’t have to let other people dictate what you should or shouldn’t do. It’s okay to be your own person. It’s okay to be different. But most importantly, it’s okay to be yourself.” Castiel’s little inspirational speech seemed to have really touched Dean Winchester’s heart, but a few seconds later he laughed it off and tried to change the subject back to his Impala.
Castiel turned to face the person who had suddenly stifled a cough. “De…. Winchester.” He greeted the jock, his arms folded across his chest.
Castiel felt something on his arm and looked down. “Twenty-two-sixty-three, that’s where you talked to me.” Then, below those words all small and black was the word “Sorry.” Castiel sniffled in disgust. He didn’t know what the first part meant, but he sure as hell didn’t want to know.
Castiel slumped in his seat, knowing that his brothers weren’t going to let him off the hook for any reason and he most certainly wasn’t going to tell them about his mysterious soulmate. So he’d be stuck on the party planning committee or whatever Michael was going to call it for the entire dance, at the least hanging decorations or making sure the concessions were available at all times.
Dean let go, finally, and looked at him directly into the eyes. “I should be thanking /you/.” He murmured softly, leaning in towards Castiel’s face. He leaned back and watched Castiel’s eyes grow wide before turning to walk across the snow back to his shitty friends.
“I don’t see any kids here,” Sam reported. Dean nodded and cracked his knuckles as Sam pointed to the picture frames across the room.
Castiel wrinkled his eyebrows. He wasn’t sure how he felt about Lisa. Something was there, but what was it? Hmm… Maybe he admired her popularity. No, because it was different than the way he felt towards Dean. Perhaps he didn’t like her. Yeah, he’d settle for that over the other options that came to mind after that.
“Well, what did he do?” Gabe asked comfortingly, but really he was planning ways to kill Dean Winchester, popular jock or not. Castiel frowned, “He saved my life.” Gabe shot him a confused look, which Castiel saw because he had finally let go. “At the lake, out by the clearing… I nearly drowned but he jumped in and rescued me. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't be alive. And yet he cares more about his popular friends than me. He cares more about those assbutts than he does about me! And you know what? I don’t care! I don’t want him to.”
His heart rate increased rapidly. Castiel had a sickening thought. How did his soulmate know his name?
No response. Castiel threw the pen across the room, smacking the poster he had on his wall. “How dare…” Castiel quickly got ready for school and hopped on the bus, zoning everyone and everything along the way. He didn’t even take out his earbuds at school when Charlie tried to talk to him. Nothing, absolutely nothing was worth it.
Castiel crept behind the other high schooler cars and avoided being seen. He learned his sneaky devilness from his brother Lucifer when they were kids, and judging by the technique Gabriel was using, he assumed the same went for his brother.
Your life seems complicated to me. I don’t understand why anyone should go through what you do. I don’t see how God could make something like this happen to someone so perfect. You don’t deserve any of that. Sometimes I lie awake at night and wish I could take your place. You’d take mine and you’d like my family-- we’re the kind of traditional family you’d see going caroling down the street in the snow. You’d get along with Gabriel pretty well if he hadn’t tossed paint all over your Impala. You’re both idiots. But that’s okay, I like to see you smile.
“How the hell can you know that look?” Dean asked Castiel anxiously, watching Lisa stroll down the hall with her friends. He looked down at the floor.
‘One day, some time, I know you’ll come to see how much you mean to me.  I will be here for you, always.’
Dean glanced at Sam, who had looked away from a brief moment and gave them a moment of silence. “Did they seem to have anything in common, besides their time of death?” Dean asked, bending down to take a closer look at one of the men.
“Cassie’s got a big fat crush on Dean-O~” Gabriel sung with a little laugh. Castiel’s glance nervously shifted from one side of the room to another. “Don’t listen to him.”
The Sheriff paused and then nodded, gesturing for the two to come inside. “The vics were killed all around the same time.” He led Sam and Dean to the bodies on the floor surrounded by caution tape. Their eye sockets were blackened by the fire that had burned them, their mouths agape, and bodies were uncomfortably strewn across the floor. But what stunned them even more than the burnt-out eyes were the blackened marks across the floor that looked like wings.
“I doubt it, but we’ll see!” Gabriel gathered all the people trying out for the play into one big circle and addressed them confidently. He was the director, believe it or not, and Castiel figured he’d introduce the play quite nicely with his cheerful attitude and encouraging smile.
“What the actual fuck does that mean?” Lucifer grunted, playing with his pen that had a fuzzy eraser top. He looked up from his usual seat on the long, narrow table. The board was covered with Michael’s notes, the darned geek, but there was a little extra space that Gabriel had written “mikey sux balls” throughout the meeting that went unnoticed by only Michael himself. Castiel found it rather childish, and wished his brothers were a bit more mature- but not quite as adult-ish as Michael. His sister Anna had managed to escape the meeting, running off with her no good friends.
Dean Winchester didn’t think about how many times his father would hit him when he returned home from the bar. He didn’t think about his little brother Sammy, and how he was going to feed and protect him when the only food in the house were packs of beer and a couple packs of crackers. And he didn’t think about what might happen in the next two-three years that might prevent him and his brother from escaping to college.
'You’re beautiful. I’ve seen you so many times, and each time I look, you become more beautiful. I’m lucky to have you as a soulmate. I’m sorry I can’t tell you who I am. You’d never guess and I may never say. But I want you to know that I really do want you.'
Dean Winchester stopped in his tracks when he noticed Castiel. His eyes flickered from feature to feature until finally he met the boy’s eyes. Dean immediately looked away and try to ignore the blue-eyed boy.
“No way!! Tell me all about him.” Charlie looked as though she’d just discovered a pot of gold. After that, Castiel explained everything from the clues to the cutting, leaving Charlie with a frown on her face. “You’ve gotta find him. You both need each other. Why don’t you talk to him now?”
“This is the kind of house mom wanted, wasn’t it?” Sam’s smile faltered as he slammed the passenger door shut. He sighed heavily and fixed his tie, carefully stepping onto the wet grass. His shoes sunk a little as he made his way to the pavement.
Neither one of the two knew what was happening in that moment, but everyone watching sure as hell knew.
He looked over one on his palm, holding it out in front of him. It was mushy, and it wouldn’t be any good to eat, but there wasn’t anything else in the house TO eat.
Gabriel was probably the most quiet he had ever been in his entire life. He wasn't smiling which was also pretty rare. Castiel felt his own breath hitch in worry for the two brothers. Hunting monsters. It had to be a sick joke. Castiel remembered the clue that said his soulmate was always on a hunt. He didn't expect it to be a monster hunt. He figured it was deer hunting, or maybe hunting for answers… this was just too much for Castiel to comprehend all at once.
Finally, after he was positive everyone had left the house, he crept to the kitchen for a beer. He opened the fridge and took one, gulping it down. It tasted bitter but Dean eagerly grabbed another and gulped it down too. He grabbed a few more, but not enough to get him drunk. Then he wandered around the house, looking at the handles of every door. Some had gathered dust, and some hadn't. Almost every door down the hallway in the back of the house had gathered dust except one, which held a handprint.
'But I hardly think you know my name. I’ll tell you what. If you can meet my eyes by the end of the day, I won’t do it.'
Life was alright for Castiel, most of the time. It was a lot better than others. His soulmates’ life, Dean’s life… it was a worse hell than he could ever imagine, he was sure of it. But that didn’t make him feel any better about himself. Jumping the bridge seemed like a pretty good idea, he figured, and it wouldn’t be too painful.
Castiel shut his eyes and let his head hang low. He knew he shouldn’t trust Dean Winchester. “But, being a nerd doesn’t just make him an outcast. It makes him smart. He isn’t a fucking retard, Norris, you are.” Dean rolled his eyes and continued to stare at the floor.
“What is it, Samsquatch?” Gabriel asked softly, trying to raise the younger boy's mood but to no avail. His concerns were only met with choked sobs as Sam wrapped his long arms around the thin trickster from the front. He sniffled a little, just thinking his father was going to be gone forever. Gabriel led him to the Impala and crawled into the back with him.
“Of course I did, Charlie, but I don’t want it to be him!” Castiel exclaimed, loudly, causing some of the people beside them to stare. “Okay, look, I know things may get a little dark around here to me if I don’t go with him, if it is him, but I’m not sure how much I care. He’s a complete assbutt.” Castiel ranted, mostly to himself, but Charlie listened patiently. “He may be attractive, and his life IS in danger, but he’s not a good person!”
Carrying on through the day was a normal drag. He excelled in all classes except one, Sex ED. He absolutely hated that class. It was even worse to have so many attractive people in his class, and even a good looking professor. He often played on his phone or doodled on his arm to pass the time.
Dean's only focus was getting to the hospital where he would see the man who had lost the love of his life so long ago.
As Castiel rounded the corner of trees, he saw the lake for the first time in months. It was probably the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. The lake was covered with a crystal layer on the surface, and almost a snowy glow to it as well. The evergreen trees were as dark as ever, but this time around, snow covered their branches. The dead-ish grass had been frozen to a crisp, but the white tip coating on the flowers made up for that.
Charlie ran off as she saw Dean Winchester walking to his Impala. She pretended to fall and accidentally fell on the concrete. Dean looked surprised as he held out a hand to offer her assistance. Charlie grabbed his arm and yanked up his sleeve after she managed to regain her balance. Her eyes widened at what she saw all over his arm. Her eyes flickered to his green ones with a few small bruises across his face. Football player, green eyes with obvious signs of abuse, and drawings on his arms!! Oh, scars, too.
“Hm.” Castiel smiled, nodding as he tossed the towel onto the cement. “It’s up to you,” he added, shrugging. Dean didn’t respond but nodded in return. “I’m surprised Sammy hasn’t showed up yet. He must’ve gotten a ride with a friend or something.”
What a horrible, mean world it was to live in. Maybe he’d find a way to speak to Dean privately and give him a little message. Castiel was grateful that the jock was so close to him and less close to the others, because his next action was quite secret. He walked a few more steps up to Dean and whispered in his ear, “meet me by the lake.”
P.S. The way this worked out sorta added another chapter. I was going to do one clue per chapter but oh whale
Dean nodded and let out a long breath of relief. “This will be your room,” Uriel opened the door and gestured for Dean to walk inside. It was spacious and ill decorated, but it had a bed in the corner and a television atop a brown dresser. For now, that would have to be enough. “Thank you.”
Dean's father had driven himself to drunken depression and because of that he was going to die. In that moment he finally understood what he had to do. He let go of the past, forgave everything anyone had ever done to him and wept more. Castiel was there for him this time, though. Comfortingly hugging him from behind as he cried shamelessly into the pillow. But like a mind reader, Castiel exited the room as Dean decided he was ready.
He was quite hesitant to press his foot against the surface as he peered into the water’s blue-white depths. He couldn’t tell how deep it was, because the ice was too blurry to see through the water. When he did, though, he felt a boost of confidence shoot up his legs. Castiel fully stepped out onto the ice, letting out a deep breath he didn’t think he had been holding in.
Dean gave a sad smile and rested his chin on Castiel's hands as the reached up towards him. “I have,” he simply said and Castiel knew exactly what he meant. Castiel looked away and dropped his hand to his side. Dean frowned, wishing his would show more compassion.
Well, it actually wasn’t, but that’s how it felt for Dean anyways. Eileen moved in after she and Sam found each other again, and the two of them were nauseatingly adorable as always. Dean was happy for them and honestly grateful because Eileen brought out a side of his brother that he hadn’t seen in a long time, if ever. He was happier, lighter. It was what Sam deserved.
Cas chanced a look at him, and he said, “You are. You’re the best man I’ve ever known, Dean Winchester. I wish…” he trailed off, mouth snapping closed before he continued more quietly, “I wish I had half your strength and compassion. The world is a better place because you’re in it.”
Then, comically, Dean leaned in like they were in a buddy comedy and said, “Please tell me I’ve tapped that at least once.”
The others were taking it hard too to be fair, especially Sam. At least Sam had Eileen to distract him though. He suspected Claire wasn’t really the picture of emotional health either, but she wasn’t talking about much of anything, and honestly, he could relate. In every way that mattered, Dean was still in the dungeon, sitting on the floor with his head in his hands.
Dean raised an eyebrow at first and then shrugged. “Well, there’s plenty of lore on ‘em. I’d guess if they are, they don’t like to be involved much.”
Silence. Castiel realized that the only noise filling his room was his own ragged breathing. 'Castiel, your words are too beautiful. You deserve more than what I have to offer. If you do care, then you’ll write my name.'
Dean only focused on the game and planned strategies on how he could score. Of course, he was happy to have so many people cheering for him in the stands, including the cheerleaders, but there was only one person he really wanted the support of.
Sam furrowed his eyebrows and left the necklace on the woman’s neck. “This family is pretty religious. I wonder if there’s any connection.” He looked over at his brother who seemed to approve of his theory and then back down at the burn marks.
Dean swallowed. He couldn’t continue bullying this person, of all people, he just couldn’t. But at the same time, he had been going through so much on his own and with his friends that he couldn’t take being bullied along with Castiel.
“I should’ve told you,” Dean cried onto Castiel’s chest. “I’m sorry, Cas, I’m so fucking sorry. It’s all my fault.” It only got colder and darker as the night continued. He only moved when he was sure he couldn’t feel his fingers. “I love you more than you’ll ever know.”
Castiel managed to get into class undetected through the back door while the teacher was looking away. First period never really took attendance like they were suppose to and he sat in the back, so it wasn’t like he was going to be called out or anything.
“Ignore my brother.” Castiel added, glaring at Gabriel. He rolled his eyes and wished he could see Dean’s for the sake of curiosity. “He’s a douche.”
Castiel began to read a book, picked at random, and felt his heart jump a little when letters began to appear on his wrist.
Gabriel sat down beside his friends, another director and a few students. He watched and took notes as each person did their part up on the stage of the auditorium. There were a few of his friends, who he found harder to correct and reject than the rest of them. It was easier to critique people he didn’t know well than people he often spoke to. No matter the person, Gabriel was jubilant the whole time, supporting everyone who performed and making their anxiety just a little better. This especially mattered for Castiel, who was met with an even bigger smile than the previous tryouts.
