“Yeah, yeah. If you’ll excuse me for a second I need to ask Dean, something.” Cas said, brushing her hands off of him as he tried to get away from her and to Dean so they could figure out what the actual fuck was going on.
“Killer party, huh?” she said. What the hell is happening? Cas shook his head, still utterly and completely confused.
Dean was wearing his usual clothes; gray undershirt, dark-blue and white flannel, his brown leather jacket, a pair of blue jeans, and his brown boots. Cas walked in then.
“Okay. Let’s go somewhere we can figure all of this out and get something to eat, I believe that I’m hungry.” Cas said, and his stomach growled, right on cue. Dean chuckled and patted Cas on the shoulder.
“And...I’m sorry I said I will wait.” Dean broke the silence.
Of course, that was why he would be frightened by a teacher—Castiel comforted himself.
"Oh, you really threatened me, because you didn't deny it."
I can't waste the Mature rating XD
“Ah, That’s my angel.” Dean grinned, saying between their lips.
It was a snowy day, much like the day that the first time he met Dean in the Giant Cat Coffee.
“Though the fever has already been brought down, it still has a probability of getting back. I know you’re so strong that the muscles on your body everywhere. At least put on the clothes indoors.” Castiel said with a blank expression, but it broke when he saw Dean grimacing at him, which was like Dean mumbled ‘Okey, Dr. Novak’, Castiel went on, “I have brought the food and pills, they are enough for two days. You can use the microwave to heat them. ”
Castiel frowned with suspicion, “...Okay?”
“Can’t I?” Dean said in a way as it hadn’t no reason to do it. Then he licked his lips and voice dropped down a little, “It seems like you have some interests in physics.”
(See the end of the chapter for
After a while, Castiel carefully turned his head back more than once to scan all of the students behind him in this room.
”Every university is allowed one version of them to exist, It sooner or later will return its origin even though it once had its time traveler. After I excluded all of their possibilities, I don’t see the hope anymore.“
“If you hunt and live in the wilds alone for a month or so, you can do better than me.” Castiel put the empty glass on the nightstand.
Castiel glared at him.
“Okay, it’s gonna be more awkward than I thought. But this answer is not bad.” Dean made a frustrated noise and put his hands to cover his face, his ears were all pink.
Castiel stared at Dean for a while, and thought for a while, suddenly his eyes opened with surprise, “You’re not that Dean Winchester.”
“I promise.”
“Old habits die hard,” Castiel tip head lightly and immediately felt at ease while he found Dean was by his side, “You can’t stop a long-lived man from thinking of his past.”
And Dean sealed his mouth.
Then Castiel smiled, shallowly. It seemed to be motivated by some old funny memory. The smile should have had a meaning of happiness or deep joys, but it was light and fading due to the awareness of reality. It made Dean hurt. He was hurt because he wasn’t the character of that memory, he felt hurt because he realized the connection between that Dean and Castiel, he couldn’t catch up even if he cost his whole life.
Castiel still looked at him, quietly.
Moving his eyes on Castiel’s scarf that hung on his neck, Dean grinned and stretched his hands to adjust it.
When he was an angel, Castiel wouldn't take much care of the time passing, he could sit there and watch the ocean birthing the first cell and the cell growing into the fish or other vertebrates. The only thing Castiel could remember and care were this star nurtured life.
“I can’t believe the parallel universe theory was really, ” Dean browsed the text message inbox on Castiel’s cell phone. This means was Castiel’s direct and efficient way to prove himself after he explained a bunch of things. “Wow, that Dean is so unbelievable, but I can’t deny he isn’t Me.”
Dean was about to step forward until he noticed the change of Castiel’s expression.
Dean quickly returned his head, glancing at Castiel from head to foot for a long while and nodding. However, he didn’t seem to be startled or astonished.
Castiel wasn’t back.
“Maybe because I’m older too, there is always younger play with younger.” Castiel shrugged.
The date he got last night before he went to bed was 10-14-2015.
Dean kicked off the small stone at his feet while he was walking, he continued.
He reached out his hands and held Dean’s cold cheek, Castiel let their foreheads touch each other, and said softly, “Dean, you can be nervous, you should be nervous. There is no shame in being nervous when you will be a valedictorian. Now, follow me, breath in, slow and deep...”
Many places he had ever been, many worlds he had ever watched. He had been fine, all of his days.
“But I still have a question.” Castiel turned his face to Dean, looked straight at his green eyes, “After you went through these, why do you trust me? Don't you think I was a weirdo too?” Castiel tilted his head subconsciously as he spoke.
He dragged himself up from the seat and kept going.
Castiel watched him, leaning over and lowering his voice, “Need I teach you why it’s wrong?”
Castiel turned silent, then he said, “I thought I wouldn’t before.”
“Nah...Was that Dean married?”
After class, he had called everyone whose numbers were on his cellphone, nobody was in the service area. and the battery of his cellphone finally was dead.
Dean almost jumped when he saw clearly that Castiel was lying on his back and his eyes open looking at the ceiling.
“No, Dean. I can like you and I‘m liking you, I do have feelings for you. It’s totally different from another Dean.” Said Castiel, “I appeared in this world for no reason, I will disappear for no reason too. I don’t know when and how it happens. It might happen in any of years, any of days, any of minutes, or right now. It has happened, it does happen to that person I love so much. I don’t want it to happen twice.”
“Shhh. You’re saying loud.” Dean interrupted him, and the latter gave him a glimpse of angry eyes. Dean’s one finger was in front of his mouth but it broke off into a long yawn. Before Castiel was about to say, Dean yawned another one.
“Do you miss your wings?”
Dean smirked and gasped, “Do you want to hit the second base?”
“So you intimidated me when I referred to Sam. Because you want to protect Sam from the same harassment.” Castiel said.
Dean opened his eyes that had just been closed, “No disgusting lovely words, like ‘You are the best’ and so on.”
“Nonono, shhh, shhh, Cas, you can’t speak with your voice. Do you remember you nearly killed me or my ears the first time that you wanted to talk to me? ”
Dean flicked his tongue and licked the dry lips, shyness in his voice, “...so, do you...?”
“Cas?” Dean repeated, “I’m sorry. Did I scare you? Did I make you uncomfortable?”
Castiel was gone before the sunrise. He didn’t talk about too much. He left as if he never existed. His few belongings placed beside his bed were the only evidence to prove and convince Dean that it was real. Dean didn’t know about Castiel too much either, he knew he was from another world, was a hunter, and hunted supernatural monsters as well as the other Dean and Sam did.
Castiel sighed, “Dean, you had seen me three times after the rehearsal started. Every time you were so interested in my scarf’s situation, I didn’t move it after you adjusted it. You just changed the state of the scarf you left behind last time.”
“Thank you.”
“Does the student climb his teacher’s bed to ask questions?” Castiel narrowed his eyes.
”Dean, you are really smart.“ Castiel looked at Dean, “Yes, I‘m a birdman, and it's also called ‘angel’ in a professional way.”
Castiel finally moved his eyes to look at Dean, which made their eyes meet.
“I’m sorry?”
It was a long night that Dean began to remember what happened after he fell asleep—his temperature climbed high as it was midnight and he, the brilliant self-rescue ability patient, got off his bed even if he was in a daze, shook up his protector who was too tired to stay eyes open all night and slept on his own bed without changing his clothes. Dean did not “shake”, he just stood by Castiel’s bed and flopped his way too heavy head on Castiel’s body, and the latter nearly jumped out from his bed. “Dean?” The first action Castiel reacted was to touch Dean’s forehead, meanwhile, Dean murmured, head on Castiel‘s chest, “I’m gonna explode if you have done nothing.” Afterward, The things were all about Castiel how to use ethanol to cool Dean’s body temperature after Dean was unwilling to go to the hospital. It was lucky that the temperature became stable and they two fell asleep safely in the end.
“...Or family?”
That was weird. Wasn’t she thought his name odd? He had to call himself Steve when he was a sales assistant at the Gas-N-Sip due to his odd name. Why was his name on that list? Old as Castiel, his self-knowledge told him that he couldn't match with the identity of a college student from the look of him, that 42-year- old Jimmy Novak.
When Dean was learning with his laptop on his bed, Castiel walked into the room quietly.
Castiel knew Dean was stubborn, no, all Deans were stubborn. However, the answer from Dean was completely out of his imagination; However, this stupid young people’s persistence was about him, that shred of delight like a rock thrown into dying water was an indisputable fact that Castiel couldn't deny. He couldn’t help thinking what would happen between them and what reaction Dean would have if he gave the response that Dean wanted.
“Cas?” Dean’s nose was pink because of the low temperature. “Are you alright?”
“You like a big animal with a child soul,” Castiel said.
It was night, Friday.
Oh, Castiel realized, he had made this man worry about him too much.
Indulging Castiel to taste his neck, Dean chuckled, “Are they like swan‘s? What color? Are they big? Are they covered with feathers?”
Castiel shook his head.
“At first, I thought it probably because I fell and became a human. But it was wrong.”
We did not get along well after I became human. Castiel thought.
They stared at each other for a while. Castiel watching the pink on Dean’s cheeks went deep and the ears were all red. Dean was the first to look on the other side with one or two of his dry coughs.
“Is it not a big deal?” Castiel asked, uncertain in his voice.
Castiel pretended to sigh, “These equations will be on the test paper. It’s good to know everyone knows how to use it, so...we skip to the next page.”
Castiel connected his phone to the socket, something funny suddenly occurred to him—when his cell phone which Dean gave to was first-time out of its battery, during which charging the phone, Dean called him. Castiel sat beside the phone and patiently watched the battery increased little by little. Dean burst into the door of Castiel’s bedroom while he was still calling Cas and saw Castiel just tamely stared at his phone vibrating. That really pushed Dean to the point that pissed him out off and he really would angrily die now. “Don’t you see that damn phone vibrate?” said Dean angrily. “Could I use the phone when it’s charging? The instruction book said it‘s very dangerous.” Castiel narrowed his eyes, innocently and bewilderedly.
“Cas...tiel, unfortunately, you are my student,” Looking at the list of the students’ names in her hand, the professor said, “So...Mr. Castiel. What witty reason for your action will you come up with?”
Castiel glared at Dean. However, the latter was grinning from ear to ear.
“I thought the long-lived man had a good temper and wouldn't be so easy to be pissed off,” Dean said in an exaggerated way while he created the new ball.
No, that voice is not distant, is near and soft. Its softness like whispering to a child.
“Cas, you can’t doubt your student if he asks for help from his teacher.”
Dean stretched out his arms around him from behind his back, tight and firm.
“Alright. I will show you later. But before this, you need to take this pill and get some rest.“ Castiel stood up to take the medicine.
It was tranquil and peaceful that everything around them was in a lack of noise state. They heard the breeze blowing and the birds singing on the rime of the pine trees.
Castiel nodded, “Life always makes fun of me, it should have been a suburb with roads and trees. Maybe I shouldn’t use ‘should have’ because it’s the ocean here for a long time.”
He really wanted to kill himself, because he was so stupid that he should charge his phone in the first place. But he couldn't help to be happy and to be excited.
Castiel sighed, “Dean, go home, go to your bed and get some sleep.”
Castiel eventually realized Dean had called him “Cas”. It was “Cas” instead of “Mr. Novak” or “Castiel”. Castiel felt his eyes warm and he bit his lips painfully. After he returned his thought back, he found Dean was staring at him. The light was dim, but Castiel could tell Dean was handsome and young, even if Dean wore his black heavy coat, he still knew Dean was strong and also taller than him.
“I thought you needed a hug. A hug makes people well.”
“…Yeah?” Said Dean uncertainly. “Actually it‘s 20.”
“But there are some causes,” Dean kept saying, “I got some jobs on the set in order to pay off college loans. It was a little-known TV show. At first, I was a dogsbody, then I was lucky to pass the audition and get a small part. I didn't do it for very long, though. but it’s enough to cover a part of the loans.“
Yesterday, no, early in the morning, Dean and he talked-and-talked until they saw the sun rise up from the horizon. At this point, Dean said, “why not try to have some classes if they have given you all the gears that a student should have. Maybe you will get another clue like you found me out in this university.”
A new world with a new version of Dean was not unusual, but Castiel seldom as an insider to be involved, he was more like a third-part, watching from the outside. But this time, he got involved in an unknown world as an insider, he found it was many times harder than he was an outsider to convince Dean “what‘s going on” and “who he was or is”.
to be taken care of.
Dean’s heart drops. “Wait.” He feels like his heart is in his throat. “Is that really what you think?”
“Okay. You can open them.”
“I’m scared.”
“Yes, I supposed your disbelief would factor into your reaction to this.”
to say it. He hugs Dean. “I love you, I love you, I love you.” It’s like he cannot hold it in any longer. There’s this bubble of light growing inside of him and he feels like he may explode if he doesn’t let it out.
“Just frustrated with the music,” Castiel replies.
“Is something wrong?”
, shoves his face into his chest and wraps his arms around him. Castiel feels his shirt get wet where Dean’s face is. He hugs Dean back and presses a gentle kiss into Dean’s hair.
him this. How sick is that? Everything he did to me. I—I still have nightmares.” Dean’s voice is unsteady. “And I’m going to his funeral? Funerals are supposed to honor people. Why does he deserve to be honored?”
Dean chuckles. “Yeah, you don’t need sleep. Maybe your angel batteries still need some time to recharge. What you went through was you know,
Hey everyone, it’s your friendly neighborhood perfectionist coming at you live from an undisclosed location to bring you the next chapter of this fic! :)
“Yeah, Dean?” Charlie asks.
“I’m okay,” Cas replies, still looking at the sunrise.
. Cas is the same size as Dean and he’s not exactly helping much when it comes to making sure he remains upright. They finally get to Cas’s room and Dean tries the doorknob. It’s unlocked.
Mission accomplished.
Milton greets Dean at the door.
“See? Still more
Charlie laughs beside Dean. Cas chuckles. Dean grins. He feels a bubble of golden light fill him up from head to toe. They’re really here. Dean’s really vowing to love Cas from now until death. They’re really starting this new chapter in their lives. Dean feels tears prick his eyes. Good things really
Cas sighs. “Nights like tonight make it hard to remember there are good things about being human. I know in my head that there are, but it doesn’t
Castiel nods. It seems so obvious when Dean puts it that way.
Dean leaves the room.
“Is it okay if I say something that may upset you? I’m not entirely sure if it will upset you—it might not—but I think it’s important for you to hear it and I need to get it off my chest.” Castiel says.
“Sure,” Dean replies.
Dean knows he should try to carefully extract himself from the nerd-angel, but he just wants to enjoy this. This can be his Christmas gift from Cas: a cuddle. That’s all he ever really wants anyway—to hold someone tightly who holds him back just as tightly.
Dean hugs Castiel back and says, “Thanks, Cas.”
“Sure,” the driver replies.
“Gee, thanks.” Dean says.
Eileen signs as she laughs.
“I was too.” Castiel admits.
Dean doesn’t even know what to say. It’s so relieving just to be here with his family.
“He’s my son. He’s sweet.”
“I put you through quite a bit of shit too as I recall.”
“So, Cas, why is the light on? Do we need to get up?” Dean asks.
That’s how they end up in the Sunken Gardens at 3AM. They’re all lying on their backs in a circle, staring at the stars, and giggling over dirty constellations they find in the sky. (Thanks Charlie.)
“I want to wait until after Cas graduates—not like, that night, but just once he’s free to plan stuff. Plus, he might not want to get married anyway.”
“Okay, how about you pay for one meal while we’re there and you take turns driving?” Castiel suggests.
They hold hands in the car on this lonely road as the sun sets and it is the best Castiel has felt in days.
They arrive at the motel before long.
Dean tried. It was just lost in translation. Again. Like everything else that Dean tries.
Castiel chuckles and pats Dean’s shoulder.
Castiel and Dean fall into a comfortable conversation. They don’t talk about much really. Just the constellations and the wind and their Milton class. Truly, it’s not much. But there’s
Castiel grins at Dean.
“Hey little bro,” Gabriel says.
“Dean, I don’t need,” Cas starts.
“Yeah, that’s a load of shit.”
“You don’t have to be sorry, man. You don’t even want to be here. This isn’t your fault.”
And now he knew he could use the phone however it was charging, though it was still very dangerous.
The things he only had were a backpack, books, student ID, his phone, the clothes he wore, a little bit of money from his pants pocket as well  (Thanks his father, the money works there.). He had no grace to use, no wings to fly, no home to return to. Standing at the front of the teaching building, the youth who spoke and laughed with their friends walked past before his eyes, he found no place to go.
Castiel smiled.
Then he raised his head and caught Dean’s hands, they were cold in a strange way and shivered, “Dean, do you want to have sex?”
“Cas?” Dean watched him with his sleepy eyes, ”It’s time for class? I have one at 8. “
Castiel found two part-time jobs. The daytime working at Giant Cat Coffee shop and the night at Lawson. The managers promised to settle his wages on the same day because he was a quick learner and a student of this university.
The guy was conscious of this strange sightline, he glared at Castiel and his mouth moved with a curse and then he left.
is you.“
“I haven‘t remembered you will be shy by suggesting special sexual requests,” Castiel smirked.
Friday, 8:25 am.
“Because I don’t belong anywhere.” Castiel returned his eyes to the stars, “I wasn’t human before, Dean.”
Then he grinned, ”I lost my memory again?“
Before Castiel spoke, Dean interrupted him and smirked as his ear was pink, “Or will I get something if I answer right and perfect? You know, teachers always reward their students for behaving well.”
The questions like flood washed Dean‘s brain, but the only thing at present he could do was waiting. Dean sat down on the sand.
Castiel paused, the stiffness along his whole body. He slowly moved his eyes to meet those green ones, they were resolution and bright.
If there was no such thing as the same as the bunker, if Dean and Sam did not belong to this world. That was the last thing he dared to imagine.
“Would you like a cup of coffee?”
Fortunately, Dean was smart.
Castiel could tear apart a demon without a breath, teleport anywhere within a second, but figuring out the human’s law of emotion change was as difficult as figuring out Dean.
“I appreciate that you accept this so fast.” Castiel said, ”instead of kicking me to a mental hospital.“
A blonde girl sat on the right side at the back of the lecture hall, giving him a meaningful wink. Castiel returned his head and found the professor was busying with her knowledge teaching.
Castiel took a glimpse at him, “Did you drop your class yesterday?”
“I miss you.” Dean kissed Castiel once and said, the genuine happiness in Dean’s voice made his feeling warm and bright. This young man always looked at him like they had just met. Castiel thought and kissed back.
Dean radiated the heat as he sat on his bed again, legs and arms crossed, thinking hard whether he acted like a girl that demanded love with the advantage of being ill.
Castiel put his eyes on that face for a while without any expression, then looked back to his book again.
“Why on earth should I know this what? Dee Winster?”
“Personal space,” Castiel said.
“Oh, don’t think too long, I want the answer that comes to your mind first,” Castiel added when he found Dean was thinking.
Castiel had been around a lot. This world was the same as his world, but it was not his world. He couldn’t find anyone there, even couldn’t find anywhere that he was familiar there.
Dean coughed drily, “Okay...you win. I apologize.”
Dean’s eyes widened more, shocked, twice in a row. Did he like a little teenager who didn't know how to kiss when he finally welcomed his first kiss?
“Mind your mouth. You’re allowed to not speak.”
some amount of time passed.
“Dean, no.” Castiel took one second to understand the meaning of Dean‘s words, he scratched his hair and suddenly didn’t know what to say, then he took a deep breath, and said, “Yes, yes, I will be back.”
When Castiel repeated this “who knows Dean” question to a young guy. The guy had a startled look on his face, Castiel was excited that he guessed he finally hit the target, so he repeated again. The guy abruptly screamed and stepped back like a hysterical poor little animal, taking his phone out, and was preparing to call 911. Castiel was startled as well as this guy,  (He didn’t know what’s going on. Did he look like a bad guy who needed to call 911? ), but his teenage radar told him that he should run right now—so, he ran, quickly.
Castiel said, “I can say they are more than the third hand, they are hands.”
Castiel turned his head to the other direction and stared through outside the window.
“You’re not behaving...”
Castiel heard Dean’s heartbeat, he heard Dean was sniffing.
Castiel would do this because he realized at least he had to be alive before he could come back home. Learning knowledge from the university and making that knowledge into money was an appropriate and efficient way to keep him alive. Of course, the spending on living and eating was more cost-effective at university than at city.
Castiel sighed. He thought he was too old to be transported over and over again.
“Right, I’m human now.” Said Castiel, ”But I’m confused why you followed me to be here. This isn’t your class, yours is in the afternoon and it‘s very bad for your good-student figure...”
She didn’t wait for Castiel to respond, and went on, “Mrs. Hudson’s high school boy wrote some love words on her student’s essay, and her clumsy TA for sure missed those big red letters. So when TA presented it as an A+ example to the whole class. Boom! Everyone knew this adorable confession overnight…But I can’t deny this boy inherited her mother’s good writing well, high school boy knows Alexander and Hephaestion is so rare.”
The laughter lasted long, Dean fell his head back on the snow, waiting for everything to go quiet, then he said, “I know you've lived too long, it's hard to turn yourself into another short-life creature; I know I'm selfish and over-confident to imagine you have something different in me. But I know if the other me can do that, so I can too. You won't ever love me or like me more than that other one, or even have nothing feeling with me.”
“You don’t like hamburgers?” said Castiel.
Dean was like a boy who was discovered by parents that he did something wrong, pulling the cover over his body. Castiel leaned in and reached his hand to touch Dean’s forehead, it was so natural that he even didn’t think before he did.
Castiel was older, at least he was older than the sand and the dust. He didn’t think very often that it would be something that made him feel ridiculous.
Dean put his hand on his mouth, no, one of his mouth, and that hand is still way smaller than his mouth.
Dean’s breath came quickly, “As a professor or husband?”
“You can’t remember?” Castiel walked close, one hand had a glass of water, the other hand was helping Dean to sit on the bed. “You almost like a chunk of hot and big cooked meat, so I have to give you a bath to get physical cooling.”
Dean gave Castiel a wide great smile and gripped his hand.
“My old roommate left when he first saw this room, so this bed was unused for a long while.” Dean sat on his bed, the right one. “I know you forgot your purse in that world, I can cover your rent for a few months.”
Dean hugged back and set his head on Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel held him in a gentle way but Dean tightly.
Dean turned around and walked away.
“It depends what you compare to. Our life has its end, even though when it happens we feel sad or other bad emotions, but eventually we’ll take it one way or another.” Said Dean.
“That’s me too, I’m not good at playing video games, especially FPS (First-person shooter), but that childish behavior neither.” Dean watched and said, “Now I know how older I am when I was his age.”
Castiel was staring, static and quiet.
“What, what are you doing?” Totally startled, Dean was stiff and didn’t know where to put his hands that he raised them clumsily in the air.
“A...alright, you win. You’re the best.” Castiel took an effort to finish his sentence.
“I didn’t refuse...” Castiel found Dean‘s eyes red. One second Castiel interrupted himself, the next he held out his arms and wrapped around Dean.
Dean burst into laughter, “What! No! Why will you read into that? I’m not that person who will be shy by sex! Even if it’s an unspeakable one.”
“No.” Castiel said, “I'm not good.”
Gabriel? Hibernating?
“I remembered you said you had no place to sleep?” Said Dean, ”Would you mind sharing a room with me?“
Dean awoke at 1:34 a.m. because he had to go to the bathroom.
“Dean, I can’t! I can’t help it.” Castiel helplessly and angrily shook his head, he was angry because he liked the wrong program and was out of its control. “Dean, leave me alone and I can deal with it.“
There was a sound that broke the serenity, someone ran to him.
Dean stopped his hands.
“Castiel? That’s an odd name, why Emi would forget this,” said Dean. “It seems like you thought I would have known you?”
“Dean, you can’t skip your classes anymore. You forget you need the scholarship to cover your loans?”
“Whoa. Easy, easy, slow, slow down.”
Finally, before the sky turned white, Dean fell asleep except Castiel.
“We can save it late.” Castiel got to his feet, pulled Dean off the cold snow-cover floor, and patted off the snow dropping on the Dean’s hair.
Dean snuffled, “Yes. Almost.”
and all of Dean loves and cares for his little brother.
“Do you use them when you have sex?”
“Nah, I’m sleeping.”
He was excited and surprised at first until he realized it wasn’t the one he wanted.
“Why didn’t I even notice you before,” She said with a smile before Castiel could voice his question. “Finally, there is another guy who pops up from nowhere and improved the degree of cuteness of the whole class.”
“I guess you can dream, huh? What about your dream, do you date with some other girls or guys?”
Castiel watched his wristwatch and speeded up. He ignored the picture that flashed through his mind, in which Dean was angry at him because Castiel got lost when he was on the way to the class and ran on the frozen ground and sprained his ankle again.
A girl with blond hair watched him a bit meters away, Castiel still sat but looked back. He tilted his head, a few seconds later, he realized she was his classmate and also was that girl who winked at him.
“Do you call yourself?” Castiel grinned, “Oh, I forget, it’s mine, yours is Mr. Forget to Call His Partner.”
“Mr. Castiel?” his thoughts were cut by his professor, who had grown impatient and raised her voice, “Get back to your seat! If you still want your credit.”
it was midnight.
Dean pushed Castiel off the hug lightly so that he could look straight at his eyes.
“Oh, wow, Cas! Cas! You can‘t sleep on the road.” Castiel suddenly became limp and almost flopped on the floor, but Dean held him right.
Dean raised one side of his brow, “Fifty? one hundred? Sorry, dude, I’m not that guy who cares about friend’s age.”
Before Castiel opened his mouth, Dean said first, “Don’t.”
Dean was excellent in reading Castiel’s expression, he knew the real meaning under Castiel’s vague words. Dean had a conflict about a line that was between him and another Dean. He was trying to not involve their personal stuff so much, but when it came to Castiel, he couldn‘t just leave alone.
This chapter is a little bit longer.
Then Dean kissed him again, but this time his hand didn’t hold the sheet to support his weight, he dug into the comforter, going down lower and lower until it was so pleased to feel Castiel took a deep and short breath when Dean touched that sensitive skin.
“Yeah, you are right,” Dean said and supported himself to seek Castiel’s mouth. Dean took his time and slowing at his every movement, Castiel became lazy, closing his eyes and letting Dean do what he wanted rather than the previous dominated kiss.
Oh, there is a little living one on his body.
“No, I’m wanting you to kiss me.” Dean wiped his nose. After his whole body got relaxed, it made him look lazy and tired.
The warmth of Dean’s body heat melted him, Castiel wrapped his arms and hugged Dean, however, he couldn’t help bantering, “Was it not you this morning slept by my side?
It was midnight. The window between the two beds poured the moonlight in. Dean secretly used his one eye to see a black shadow closing the door gently, then he moved slowly to his bed and put down his backpack on the floor. As Dean was about to ask what’s going on, Castiel cast himself on the bed, face down.
Castiel withdrew the glass in time that he was going to give Dean and to keep it from spilling on the covers, “It’s so strange that it surprises you?”
Castiel heard Dean was smiling, but he was so busy touching every bit of Castiel’s skin.
“Don’t you feel afraid you will die alone?”
Castiel was onto his back, motionless. However, his eyes were wide open and focused on the ceiling.
There must be another hope. In this world.
The kiss ended with Dean was between Castiel’s thighs and rested his head on Castiel’s chest. He lost the first round but won the rest.
It was Friday, 10-14-2015.
Castiel sighed, a long and deep sigh.
Castiel took a deep breath and watched the whole dark sky, “I used to be a watcher. I have seen the beginning of the earth, I have seen all creatures changed from one to countlessness, I also have seen humans from one of them become one of the one. I went through these and was accompanied with these, I was calm and didn’t pay much attention, because they were my mundane jobs.”
“That’s the whole point...” Castiel realized.
“Whoa. Easy, esay.” said Dean. “Are you at college? “
“Maybe I am that Dean who you look for. Maybe I just got something hit my head and lost my memory?” Dean said jokingly, his green eyes shone.
It was Dean even if it sounded younger than he thought and less hushed. It definitely was Dean, he wouldn't be wrong unless he was deaf.
“It did not cost much time and now you look healthy again.”
“Did you take all my classes that you didn't need to?” Dean asked, then he paused, “Are you angry?”
“There was a guy doing something as similar as you. He probably was a fan of the character I played. He lied to my friend he was my co-worker on the set, and used my friends to get to me. I thought he just confused me with my character...But I'm lucky I'm a student of this university.”
“You have my words.” Castiel supported Dean’s entire weight, “I promise.”
“I need you to look at me.”
Giving a glance at his phone, Castiel frowned. It's 23:25 p.m. in Melbourne.
Castiel had no reason to decline Dean‘s requirement. Therefore, they walked side by side on the way to the library.
“If the world is that simple,” Dean replied, “They didn't care about my personal affair, they would care if somebody affected their road to make money.”
Unexpectedly, Dean stayed quiet this time. They only could hear the sound of them stepping on the snow.
Castiel sighed.
Dean scooped him up, almost lifted his feet off the ground, and squeezed him so tight that nearly crushed him.
“Christ, do I get some Satan's curses? Why always like this? Maybe I into girls more possible living with love.”
“It’s Okay, Cas.” Dean smiled and seemed happy. He cleared his throat, “Can I kiss you?”
Castiel couldn’t help grinning, it was his first smile after he was back from Lebanon, “Twins means alike. But you all are not just alike, it's the same.”
When he was standing in line in the school cafeteria (Don't be surprised, as a qualified ex-angel and new mankind, he knew where to eat as a student.), a huge-tall male cut in line and blocked his view without any mercy. It was incredibly irritated him, for example.
“I have ever missed one, I won’t let it happen twice.” Castiel rubbed Dean’s hair, saying slowly, “You asked whether I would love the other Dean more than you, I think it’s unfair for you even if you said you didn’t care. I won’t give you my promise that I balance or weigh the feeling precisely and I can change my mind immediately just because I’ve said.”
The phone sank down in no time. Dean looked up at Castiel then looked at that disappearing poor phone, eyes wide, “Cas?!”
Castiel wasn’t answering.
However, he said, “I don’t know.”
Castiel was not alone, however, he was alone.
“Dean, it’s me. Castiel.”
“No, Dean, I’m fine.” Castiel hesitated, he was distracted because he was conscious of Dean who was being influenced by his words. “I just...”
“I will be your wings,” Dean said.
“Dean?” Castiel returned his head and asked.
“I need some time to think.” Castiel finally spoke.
“shhh.” Dean interrupted him, “Just explaining the equation, please, Mr. Castiel.”
Dean could hear the second hand of his watch moving and his own heartbeat. He watched Castiel with his nearly shut eyes.
Castiel looked up at the sky for seconds and walked into the library. After he weighed up the pros and cons, he spent what little money he had on a USB cable to charge his poor cell phone.
“Are you crying?” Asked Castiel.
“No problem, Mr.Roommate.” Dean closed his eyes but suddenly snapped open. “Can I go with you?”
“I’m regretting to mention it when we are having sex.” Castiel sighed, propped himself on his elbow under the comforter, but his body still pressed against Dean. Castiel could clearly feel the strength sleeping under Dean’s muscles, Dean looked stronger than he was clothes on, especially, it was easy to ignore when Dean’s good-looking and his childlike smiles. Discontented by the interruption, Castiel leaned further and pecked at Dean’s neck, the last one became licking and Dean shuddered.
Dean’s sentence was broken off because his mouth was taken up. When Castiel caught Dean’s lips, Dean’s upper body was pushed down to the cold-sandy ground. Castiel stretched one hand in a subconscious way to protect Dean‘s back of his head even if the ground wasn’t harmful to any.
“Some are barren, some are highways, the rest of them are those places where nobody lives.”
“The last time you called me is when you accidentally dialed my number. Even your ass got bees’shit, I had to know this through mom and sent you to the clinic. Now you’re finally calling me just for this?” Said Dean angrily. “But thanks to your ass affair, I wasn’t there.”
That was not the punchline. After he found a good balance that he could get well used to human life,  everything changed in one second.
He called this unknown number and he could hear his heartbeat.
“What?”
“Do you miss those forms?” Dean asked.
“Dean!” Before Castiel finished this word, another snowball slid into his mouth.
Then he gave a little dry cough and kept going, “After the commencement, I will ask you a question. And what I want you to do is that I need you to say ‘I do’ or ‘Yes’, one out of two. It‘s not difficult, right?”
Luckily, the familiar building came into sight, Castiel rushed into the front door.
This chapter took some time and was changed several times X(
When Castiel showed him that video; When Castiel stared at the other Dean who was giggling and laughing at Castiel in the video, the look on Castiel’s face, that raising of his mouth, that shining of his baby blue eyes, which Dean could tell, it wasn’t a friend to find another one because of pure loneliness, and Dean didn’t know why he was jealous and envious all at once.
Castiel paused, the stronger feeling swept him and made him want to cry.
Until the early morning of the fourth day. The sun just lit the sky and it was warmer than it has been for days.
She stared at him with an unfathomable expression again. Castiel lit his fire of hope again, too.
“I think you won’t want me to do that here, since it’s a classroom building, and we have class in five minutes,” Castiel looked at his wristwatch and found a strange or familiar sight focussed on him. Castiel raised his eyes and narrowed them when Dean stared at him as a big puppy stared at meat hungrily.
This time, too.
“Why are you staring at me?” Castiel lowered his voice after he took a glance at the teacher.
Castiel looked through the glass, out of the windows, he saw the stars twinkling in the night as he watched them when he had wings and was so closest to them before the very beginning.
“And the other places?” Dean said.
Castiel paused for some seconds, “It has to be another reality.”
He realized he was nothing either. In this world, he didn’t know where he was from, who he was, whether he had family, whether he had friends, how he grew up to be a young adult. He thought himself was like a redundant fragment or a computer bug out of nowhere in this world.
Dean rolled over under his comforter, and it made a small hole between his body and comforter, which the cold air could leak into. Dean shivered and murmured, “So cold.” He curled himself up more, yet he felt strange and rolled over again, opened one eye. Then Dean saw Castiel was leaving his bed.
Castiel had two hypotheses: Dean was still at his current age or Dean became a youth too. Whatever it was, He surmised Dean had to be something connected with this college. If the latter was right, from his humble opinion, Dean’s good looks had to impress a large part of the students.
The whole space was larger than the high school classroom that Castiel watched from soap opera, had plenty of stairs and the high ceiling and the lowest terrain near to the center, teachers' lectern, where he definitely sat in front of it.
A wave of the sense of helplessness attacked him abruptly, Castiel opened his eyes and saw Dean standing in the distance looking at him.
Castiel’s hand gently grasped Dean’s shoulder, the other hand propped into the sand beside Dean’s ear. Dean tamely parted his lips, Castiel pressed in right away. Dean could feel the stubble from Castiel’s jaw and felt the warmth from that body. Castiel kissed him firmly and thoroughly, and it was damn good, it definitely wasn’t from an inexperienced bookworm. Dean smiled softly and hands cupped Castiel’s face, kissing back.
The students' apartment was located in a prime location, cheaper but smaller, and clean. One room with two beds which were placed in a corner against the wall, one on the right and the other on the left. Plus a bathroom.
“No, I didn’t.” Castiel grinned, “By the way, I’m way older than you thought.”
Dean put his hand to Castiel’s mouth right away before Castiel’s lips moved, “Nope, it’s too late. I have your words.”
A familiar voice seems to come from a very very long distance.
He stopped again, looking out of the window beside him, a bird singing on the ledge of the window and flying away. Castiel turned back and said to Dean, “I will settle down and move on.”
“He isn’t there.”
“Sleep. leaving you to me, I’ll take it.”
“You’re odd but not weird, at least I don’t hate it.” Dean said, ”Don’t want to distrust either.”
The world went quiet again.
Dean was about to speak, but it broke, and he couldn’t help laughing. Castiel followed Dean and burst into laughter too.
Dean closed his eyes and followed Castiel’s instruction until his heartbeat gradually went stable and normal.
The next day, Castiel was busying in his coffee maker at Giant Cat Coffee shop when he was going to make coffee for a young lady. There was a weird sight on him for a long creepy time, Castiel took time to figure out what it was, the evidence escaped and he only noticed a baseball cap that had a cute white cat pattern on it, but the profile of this cap’s owner was so familiar to him.
“You don’t want to throw me off from 1,000 meters, even if I have already died. It’s still not good for dying twice, right?”
Dean was on the edge of being asleep till he heard the petty voice. He took some effort to open his eyes.
Castiel opened his mouth and shut, then looked around the surroundings.
Then, Castiel opened up a video, shooting and editing by Charlie (Castiel was regretful he couldn’t tell Charlie how grateful he was now). The video was of him and Dean and Sam, the three of them were playing a video game on PS4 in the bunker. Sam was still good at everything including video games. Charlie was teaching Castiel how to shoot zombies and monsters, and Castiel was a fast-learner, but Dean neither—good things that Dean shot at those supernatural creatures is completely opposite to what he did in real life, or his world was going to die. When Castiel was about to win this game, Dean grabbed his controller and hid it behind his back, laughed like an idiot and crowed over his actions. Castiel glared at Dean for a second, then he threw himself upon him, and they struggled together. The background was the laughter of Charlie and Sam.
“Castiel Novak,” Said Castiel politely. ”Thanks.“
Dean tried to say something else because the tone of Castiel was frightening him, “Might I’m dean's twin? That we just don't know each other in this world.”
The world stayed silent except for their steady breath.
Dean hesitated to choose the right to say, he really seldom thought about his wording. In general, he was a good talker as his listeners weren’t so much important to him, at least less important than his family.
“Why not?” Dean said and winked, ”Or the student asks the teacher to his bed?”
Dean puckered his lips and looked so disappointed.
This Déjà vu he felt made him smile, wryly and absurdly.
Castiel still couldn’t find anything about Dean, sam, charlie, and whoever he knew about, couldn’t find why he was transported to this world with nearly nothing, why he was been a college student even if he didn’t know how to be, why he couldn’t find a good way to figure out everything every time, and why he only was human.
“No, uh, Yes, I want to have sex of course, but I‘m good, I’m damn good, Cas, it’s just a commencement.”
“It was the Bunker?” Dean broke off the silence.
“Do not take off, do not speak of the scarf thing, or I will give you my coat and gloves.”
“I apologize...” He obeyed his professor’s order submissively. He still kept his eyes wide and on her while he was going back to his seat. Castiel even didn’t know why he would be scared.
And Dean saw an unfamiliar street. He looked down, there was a really nice motorcycle in front of him. Dean looked at himself and he was wearing the same clothes as before, but his duffel bag was nowhere to be found and there was a set of keys in his pocket that he didn’t recognize. They had his name engraved on a small metal plate that was attached to the keys. ‘Dean Winchester’ is what it read, and that isn’t even what freaked him out the most.
“Okay. I’ll have that right up. You. Play nice with him.” Ellen said pointing at Dean and then over at Cas as she walked away from their table to presumably give their order back to the kitchen.
“I have no actual idea what the city is called. I know they are in Northern California in a ‘college town’ as you would say.” Cas said with air quotations and all.
“It’s Dean Winchester!” Cas whipped his head around and looked at Hester, wide eyed. Dean is here?
“Dean. I- I can’t do- nothing’s happening.”
He gave Jack a hug also. They’d become really close, Jack was like a son to Dean and he was going to miss him as much as he was going to miss Sam. A lot. But they needed people to stay here. They’d be fine here until Dean and Cas got back.
They started slowing down after a while and Cas opened his eyes to find them in front of a pretty decent looking diner.
Only thing is that it’s a really high stakes trip and Dean really didn’t want to fuck it up. This might be their only other shot at killing Michael. For good. Fuck. He needed to make sure this worked out.
Heaven had lost track of where a lot of the weapons were after a garrison moved them to a warehouse in California. Then they were taken by Balthazar during the first apocalypse, and there was no way of knowing that all, or even any, of those weapons were still there.
And Dean is whole.
You're more than family to me.
Dean shook his head. Sam was right. They didn’t need to come back to a time where they were never born, or something even worse, like his Baby never being made. Dean shivered. Shit, that would be worse than going back hell.
“Alright. Let’s get out of here. Time traveling always drains all of my energy.” Dean grumbled while grabbing enough money to pay for the bill and tossing it onto the table and striding out toward the parking lot where the motorcycle is parked. Cas sighed, pulled himself together, and followed.
“Wow Cas. I didn’t know you even knew who he was, much less had talked to him before! I have no idea where he is. I think Lisa invited him though. I told her that she shouldn’t have told him about tonight. You know they dated in high school? I heard they broke up because-” Hester shuffled even closer to Cas “he’s a homosexual.” She whispered into Cas’ ear.”
You weren’t dead but it God damned felt like you were.
“It never came up as something we needed, so I didn’t really have a chance to share.”
“Oh my God! I love this song!” Came Hester’s shrill voice right in Cas’ ear and it made him jump away, startled. Hester dragged Cas onto the dance floor where he had first appeared a few minutes ago, presumably to dance.
“Nope I don’t know who’s here.” Cas said distractedly as he continued to crane his head over Hester’s head and look around the room in search for Dean. There has to be a way to get out of this insufferable conversation so he can figure out what happened. He needs to make it somewhere that isn’t this crowded so he can fly to Dean and see where he went and what happened to him.
The first thing that needed to happen was figuring out the exact location of the weapons. Cas could probably figure that out from some of the other angels so that’s what he was off doing right now.
Nothing happened.
Ineffably.
They needed something to work, but they didn’t need another thing going wrong; that’d been happening a LOT recently. Dean always just wanted to jump right on it; he never wanted to stop. Sam thought that he really needed to take a step back, he’d been possessed by Michael. Twice now. They didn’t even take one day off. Maybe he needed to feel useful; to do stuff to keep his mind busy.
There was a bright light and a really loud sound; like an engine gunning.
Cas had come back from heaven before they got back from shopping and was waiting in the map room when they walked in. Dean gave Cas all of the clothes so he could go pack them in a bag, and followed him back to fill him in on the plan.
“Oh yeah, and did you figure out where the weapons were stashed?”
Cas put his bag on the table and opened it. He grabbed his journal book and carefully tore out the drawing. He went over to Jack and handed it to him.
“Here’s two regulars for both of you boys. A cheeseburger with French fries and a milkshake. Enjoy you two.” Ellen said, barreling through Deans attempted, pathetic confession and making him lose any confidence he has mustered up to even get that far. Cas noticed how Dean deflated, the wind taken out of his sails and how sheepishly he glanced at Cas.
It was too dark to tell so he started moving toward the door to go see if it was Dean.
“Oh yeah. There was a bike in front of me when I showed up here and my initials were on the keys so I just, uh, used it.” Dean said rubbing his hand on the back of his neck fretfully.
“Okay,” Jack said. “3., 2.., 1…”
“We need to kinda collect ourselves and figure out what our next move is.” Dean spoke around the straw still in his mouth. Cas thought for a bit. He had never actually had to think about things like where to sleep, where to eat at, and how to get places. He never had to sleep or eat and could just fly himself to practically any place he wanted to. This was a lot more complicated and difficult to deal with.
He was wearing the light blue sweater, a pair of brown trousers, and the pair of dark brown shoes that Dean found. His hair was messier than it normally was and he looked a lot more comfortable and personable. He looked nice.
“I believe that would be a very smart idea. It isn’t that hard for me to do so it should be a walk in the park for Jack.”
“I don’t know what is going on but, um.” Cas said uncomfortably. He looked like he really didn’t want to say anything about whatever it was he knew. That was too bad because Dean really needed to know what Cas already knew.
“This is the only thing that actually looks like it might actually work. We’ve been reading the same damn books for months, acting like we’re gonna see something different. If we have a shot at something, I need to jump on it now.” Dean explained.
“Okay mom, I won’t.”
“Well, it’s pretty late right now and we need to find some place to stay for the night.” Cas said.
And I love you
“And? Cas just spit it out already.”
“Yeah it’s me. Who else did you think was gonna be here? So. Who’s your friend?” Ellen said. She leaned onto the booth Dean was in and jutted her thumb over toward Cas.
“Hold on tight!” Dean yelled as he twisted the key and the engine started. It was really loud and Cas didn’t have a chance to answer before Dean started to take off and Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s stomach.
“Come on Cas, daydreaming over there? Let’s go grab a booth and eat. I’m starving.” Dean said interrupting Cas’ train of thought.
“It’s so good to see you out of the library. Finals are torture!”
Completely.
Cas started sketching. Dean realized that he’d never seen Cas draw, or really even write for that matter. And damn was he good. He started with just a rough outline of a box. But after a few minutes of sketching, the warehouse they were looking for took shape on the paper.
Completely.
Hester seemed very content and was looking at him in a way that seemed way too intimate for someone whom he had just met. Cas stopped dancing. It was Dean, right across the room, and he was staring wide eyed at a girl who looked to be Lisa. The Lisa that Dean had to leave behind so that he could keep her and Ben safe, and to continue hunting. He pulled her into a long hug, and then started talking emphatically about one thing or another.
Cas tried again, focusing on the image he had of the motel in mind, and still.
(not that he was looking)
All that came out of that hell hole was an angel telling Cas the same shit that they were getting from all of their books.
Inevitably.
Hester smiled and grabbed Cas’ wrist loosely to get his attention back and said “Wait here, I’m gonna go grab us some more drinks!” Hester pushed her way through all of the people in the way of going into what Cas guessed to be the kitchen.
“Um, okay I guess Cas. I’ll find you later!” She said and moved to find someone else to dance with.
"And then I was feeling in the dark.
“No. Jack it’s just an expression.” Sam said with a small smile on his face while shaking his head.
Cas was gone and Dean stumbled into the bunker,
They browsed around for a while and Dean ended up finding a couple nice sweaters in Cas’ size, most notable the light blue sweater that would complement his eyes,
You're the end of my line. I need you, not because of what you can do for me, but because of what you mean to me.
The half burnt out sign read “Ellen’s ROADHOUSE DINNER” in pink and blue neon writing and the parking lot only had a few cars parked in it, so it was fairly empty.
“What? What is it? Did you hear something?” Dean asked quickly. Cas shifted around, eyes not quite meeting Dean’s as he mumbled something.
They'd been researching for months now, pouring over all of the books in their extensive library and reading any (and all) angel and archangel lore books that they could find. The same things, over and over again; an archangel’s blade or one of the archangel’s other weapons was the only way to kill Michael. Well, with the Lance of Michael snapped; no archangel to use the blade; and the “egg” that Ketch mailed them, literally melted, the different ways of killing Michael were dwindling.
The kiss was chaste, pure, and nothing short of everything Dean had ever dreamed of. The way that Dean's cheeks and the tip of his nose burned as red as cherry wine, the elatting feeling of butterflies in his stomach, and how great it feels to have Cas' lips on his. The way Cas kissed him made him feel revered and just so right.
“Of course I do! We fixed up some old bikes with Bobby using some of the scraps from Bobby’s junkyard and Sam and I learned how to ride. Sam was 8 and almost ran over my foot a few before he got the hang of it.” Dean reminisced, smiling to himself as he recounted the memory.
“What is that?”
‘I’ve got to figure out what’s happening and where Dean is. Now.’ Cas closed his eyes and rubbed his temples, trying to think with the noise of many extremely rowdy and drunk people laughing and singing along to the Beatles around him. He turned around and accidentally ran into a shorter, red-haired woman. Cas realized that it was his sister. Of all people his fucking sister Anna.
Inevitably.
What the fuck is happening. “Uh, sure. Yeah.” Cas said, rubbing the back of his neck, trying to figure out what to do and say.
“Oh, yeah, hey Hester I’m fine. I think it’s just the lighting or something in here. I didn’t really recognize you when you came up to me.” Cas said, stumbling over his words as he tried to seem just mildly confused and not completely bewildered and overwhelmed like he was actually feeling right now. Why does everyone know who he is and why isn’t this Anna like the Anna back home? It feels like something was incredibly wrong but Cas just couldn’t put his finger on it.
And fell apart.
“Okay, Cas you can let go now.” Dean said, huffing a laugh.
“Well did heaven tell you or not?”
“Dean is here?” Cas said aloud. “Where is he? I need to talk to him.”
Cas nodded, coming back to their current situation and followed Dean toward the back corner of the diner.
It was terrifying.
“Dude, what the hell is going on here? How do all of these people know who we are? I keep feeling people staring ever since we entered the diner.” Dean said while fidgeting in his seat.
“What was that? I didn’t hear you.”
A deep, empty black enclosed the hand that Cas was using to play with the sleeve of Dean’s frayed jacket. He didn’t even look alarmed, he just had a smile that said  “it’s okay, I love you, you can go on,” and so many more things that Dean would never get the chance to decipher.
All I could feel was this pure fucking black nothingness. It was like being completely cut off from all emotions senses.
“I think that this would be of assistance right now.” He said with a small smirk on his face.
Dean was whole again.
Everything kept leading to dead ends.
Sam sighed and ran his hands over his face and through his hair. Sam didn’t know what to do.
Dean was still looking incredulously at the license and other IDs in the wallet when Cas held up the key and jangled it to get his attention.
The only mode of transportation Cas had ever been in was a car, and this did NOT feel like a car. It felt a little bit like he was flying, but more like he was always right at the top of a rollercoaster, everything about to drop out from under him. It was exhilarating and terrifying all in the same moment.
“I think I did fine.. Listen I’ve got.. To go..”
‘Where the hell is Dean?’ Cas thought, eyes frantically searching the room for anyone who looked like him. What happened, where was he, and how did he get separated from Dean? This is really really not good.
“Cas, I- when you were gone, I wasn’t just sad. I felt like, like I let a piece of me walk out that door with you. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t think, all I could do was try to fill that void. And then I started eating. And drinking. And it never filled me up.
a bright yellow one, and a toned down forest green one along with some others and a few short sleeve button downs in some staple colors for hotter days. Sam found some trousers in a few different colors and some comfortable shoes. The store had pretty much exactly what they were looking for, and Dean was happy that they didn’t have to stop somewhere else to get any more clothes.
"Yes." Dean said confidently; this was something Dean had thought about thousands of times. He was sure.
“Sam, you know there’s no other way,” Dean said.
“Cas? Is something wrong?”
Cas lowered his hands to take both of Dean's. He rubbed methodical circles into the backs of Dean's hands. Cas' smile had grown so much, had he ever seen Cas smile that big? It was definitely something he could get used to.
And it felt like coming home.
“It’s not like we have Michael’s lance anymore and we have to find a way to kill this son of a bitch. I don’t need someone who can get inside of my head still walking around.”
Cas had no idea how to dance. He looked at all of the guys around him to see what the hell he was actually supposed to be doing, and saw the boy’s arms slung around the girl’s waist and shoulder, shuffled their feet side to side lazily, and everyone was incredibly close. Cas compromised and uncomfortable did exactly that with definitely more distance between them than the people around him. He felt incredibly awkward and had no idea if he was doing anything right. It wasn’t like he had ever been taught to dance, this was all really really new to him.
“That’s him.” Hester said, jabbing Cas with her elbow. Cas barely heard her though, he was watching Dean. He hadn’t seen Dean this happy in a long time. He looked about 15 years younger, and he could tell just how much he had missed Lisa. It made him incredibly sad that Dean had to give all of that up to keep them both safe.
“That sounds like a good idea. Cas, Sam thinks that Jack should send us back so you’re mojo will be at full power, are you fine with that?” Dean said, hearing Cas walking down the stairs into the war table room. Dean turned around and looked at Cas. He hadn’t ever seen Cas in anything other than his trench coat and suit. I mean he saw Jimmy wearing some sweaters but that wasn’t Cas.
Here’s an alternate *HAPPY* ending for y’all that weren’t happy with me for the sadness. Im sorry, I couldn’t resist.
“Dean, I think I’m human? I can feel emotions, I have been over the past half hour, I thought maybe I had been tired from traveling through time because that is normal, even for an angel, but everything is so strong. And I can’t fly.” Shit Shit Shit. Why does something have to happen to them every time they try to do something?
“This is what it’s like to be human again Cas. A slave to your body’s needs.” Dean said as they made their way over to the bike and Dean swung his leg over the top of the bike, and settled down into the seat. He motioned for Cas to hurry up and get on, so Cas stepped over and did exactly what Dean had done.
“Ellen?” Dean said, eyes wide open. It really didn’t click when they had pulled up to the diner Ellen’s ROADHOUSE. He didn’t think twice about the connection until she was standing right infront of him waiting for him to tell her his order. Cas finally looked up when Dean had said her name, and the recognition was clear on his face as well.
“Uhh Cas? Anytime now.” Dean said, his face hardening into a frown as he stared at Cas, confused.
Cas also gave Sam and Jack a hug and then grabbed his duffel and Dean did the same.
“Okay.”
“I was shown the building where they were kept…”
“Oh my God Cas! I’ve been looking for you everywhere! I had to ask around town to figure out if anyone’d seen you. A girl walking over here told me that ‘Castiel was supposed to be at the Delta party down the street’. And Lisa? But it wasn’t Lisa, she acted a little off and how could that be Lisa, Cas? It’s 1965 not 2018! And is there any reason people actually know you by name here too?” Dean said grabbing onto Cas’ arm and dragging him out of the way of someone drunkenly sloshing their drink in his direction.
“Fuck Cas, finally!” Dean said before pulling Castiel into an intense hug before littering the alpha’s face with kisses.  “Yes! Yes!” Dean chanted over and over.  Finally his alpha would officially be his mate.  Dean was so excited and given the state of Cas, the alpha was too.
"Yes… Prince Dean.  I'll take you both under my protection if Prince Dean agrees to become my mate and consort." Castiel announced with a grin on his face.
“Yeah.  Bobby’s coming for us at lunchtime.  We’ll see each other again.  You’ll be eighteen soon.  Then you can come see me without Missouri.  It’ll work out.” Dean said pleadingly with Castiel.
“Can’t say that I blame you.  Our mating ceremony and feast will be legendary.” the alpha says grinning,
“I’ve taken a friend on occasion and my half-brother once.  He didn’t shut up the whole time so he has been banned from going again.  Why do you ask?” Castiel thinks he already knows but he wants Dean to say it.
“Grow a pair, Kevin.  It wasn’t that bad.” Jo yells from her square on Castiel’s laptop.
“Your best friend is an omega?” Castiel said with jealousy coloring his scent.
The aroma wafting from the morning dining room, makes Dean’s stomach growl audibly.  Sam looks at Dean and laughs.  “Hungry Dean?” the younger omega says with a chuckle.
Dean and Sam had been staying at Missouri’s Home for Wayward Boys for a little over a month.  Bobby had visited numerous times as he fought to get legal guardianship of them.  John had dropped off the map.  No one could find him and Dean was kind of glad.  They would be better off without him.  Bobby was a better father to them than John ever was.
“Always my omega.  I am going to order dinner to be delivered.  What shall I get you?” the alpha asked petting the omega’s cheek.
“Nonsense.  You’ve only missed one question but you got it on the second try.  You’re smart Dean.  I know you’ll do great.” Castiel says, attempting to wrench Dean’s arm from his face.
Dean was working with his Uncle Bobby restoring old cars and occasionally driving the tow truck.  He’s always enjoyed working with his hands and getting dirty.  In California he’d worked in construction and had found that enjoyable too.  However there was something special about hearing an old car rumble to life when it had been left to ruin.
"Castiel is not like our father."  Sam stated boldly.
~~~ Three Years Later ~~~
“Mick’s his?”
“Damn, I’m sorry.” Dean didn’t know what else to say.
“Yeah Cas.” Dean says as Ellen brings their order.
“Yeah.  Just lost in thought.  I’m ready to go.” Dean responds.  He gets up and follows Bobby but he’s still kind of lost in his head.  He nearly runs into a door before Bobby can get it open for him.  The knight just shakes his head at Dean and mutters “Idgit.” under his breath.
“Hmm.. love you.” Castiel says distracted.  “I thought we’d continue watching Doom Patrol.” Castiel responds and turns to kiss Dean’s cheek.
“Well call me impressed.” Dean said taking the beer Castiel pulled from the cooler.  Castiel himself pulled a bottle of lemonade out to drink.  “Do you not drink alcohol?”
The carriage ride was quite rough and Castiel knew he would be very sore when they finally arrived at the court of Lawrence.  He sat next to his alpha under the close watch of King John.  They were not officially mated yet and they took an omega’s rights and safety seriously.   Dean just held his hand for which the omega was grateful.  It helped keep him grounded and calmed his nerves.
"Of course I do.  How could I forget the name of the handsomest man in the building.” Dean says obviously flirting.  “Oh you’re adorable when you blush.” Dean says playfully.
The next morning Castiel sat at his breakfast table drinking his coffee and watching Bumblebee sun himself on the window sill.  He observed that his cat looks healthy but more plump.  How was that possible?  Castiel had been following the vets guidelines religiously.  He would admit he gave more treats than was advised but not that much more.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did you sleep well, my Dean?” Castiel asks with complete sincerity.
“What happened?” Castiel inquired.
By the time Dean arrived at the office he had managed to calm down enough that he wasn’t likely to go in brandishing his gun like he had fantasized about.  He did take a few calming breaths before getting out of his car.  Sammy didn’t need to know that he actually took his advice from time to time.  He let the familiar creak of Baby’s door calm him further.  When he wrenched open the door of the office, he resisted the urge to tear it from its hinges but only barely.
"No, Bobby is supposed to come see us.  He promised." Dean countered.
The next thing Dean knows, he is waking to a warm weight draped across his chest.  He opens his eyes and makes sure not to move.  Castiel is asleep, snuggled into Dean’s chest.  Dean wishes he could have this all the time but he doesn’t have the guts to tell his best friend he has those kinds of feelings.  He doesn’t want to risk losing Castiel as his friend.  He’d be lost without him.
Much Love,
The last to visit the omega was King John.  For a long moment the king just regarded him.  “Dean will be good to you as I know you will be to him.  If you ever need anything, you let Mary or I know.  You are our beloved son and we love you as though we are blood.  Do you understand me?”
Dean would miss Missouri and the other boys.  He wouldn’t miss Frank, who was in charge of the grounds.  The guy had some seriously weird conspiracy theories and a horrifying imagination.  He would go on and on about his theory that many high profile people were something he called Leviathans.  He described them in horribly gruesome detail to anyone that would listen.  Dean had nightmares occasionally about people’s faces turning into gaping mouths with monstrously sharp teeth, thanks to Frank.
Ten years ago right out of college Castiel had moved to Lawrence to work in an accounting firm.  After only being there a month Castiel met Dean and he had fallen hard for the green eyed man.  The day after they’d made love for the first time, Dean had called and broken things off with Castiel.  Saying he wasn’t gay and it was all a mistake.  Castiel broke.  He quit his job the next day and moved to New York the next, where he met up with Balthazar and they started their business together.
“I will Gabe.” Castiel says tiredly.  Maybe he should just quit.
“I see.  Will I be permitted the symbol?” the omega asked with hope.
Castiel’s response to this, is to punch Dean in the arm before laying down on the bed next to him.
“I would never allow that.  My father would never allow that.” Dean declares.
Castiel starts to move and Dean knows he’s about to wake.  Blue eyes open and Castiel looks startled.  “I’m sorry.” comes Cas’ sleep deepened voice.  He goes to get up and Dean just goes for it and holds him in place.
Castiel was dressed in white trimmed in silver.  Charlie had fussed over him until Castiel had to put a stop to it.  She accompanied him down the stairs until he met Prince Gabriel.  “Are you ready, Cassie?” the alpha asked.
“You know it’s tradition to wish upon a star, especially a falling star?” Dean asked.
~~ Six Months Later ~~
“Mr. Novak, I had nightmares last night because of this story.” Kevin whines.
Castiel picked up his sketch pad and started drawing the mountains off in the distance.  He had never given up his hobby and he was happy for it.  Footsteps approaching, drew his attention away from his work.  Castiel smiled as his alpha approached holding Ben’s hand.  Dean was such a good and loving father and alpha.
Castiel looks at the box then into Dean’s eyes. He swears Cas can see his soul.  “Yes Dean.  I’m yours.  Always my beloved.”  Castiel says, holding out his left ring finger.  Dean quickly slides the simple silver band on Castiel’s finger.  They kiss until the ride stops.  They kiss through dinner at the same diner they ate at two years ago.  Then they make slow tender love in the backseat of Baby.  Dean has his happily ever after.
While walking to the morning dining room, Dean allows himself to take in the Palace of Terra.  It is beautiful, there is no doubt.  It has been done in light, soothing colors.  The Palace of Lawrence, Dean had always thought was gaudy and overly masculine.  There are no taxidermied heads of exotic animals along these halls, thank the gods!  The Palace of Terra has well painted portraits of the ancestors adorning its halls.  There are also many landscapes dispersed as well.  Many beautiful statues stand in alcoves, seeming to silently observe them.  Everything is expensive but still in good taste.  Dean can’t wait to take the time to inspect each item closer.  Dean takes a moment to look at his brother and can’t help but grin at Sam’s expression.  Sam looks to be excited to do much the same.
“Don’t worry about that asshole.  If I catch him here again the sheriff will take personal care of him.  Claire is her adopted daughter.  She’s already had an EPO put on him to keep him away from Claire and her wife Kaia.  Don’t worry you’re safe here.  On my honor I promise.” Benny says with a look of knowing compassion.
“Wow, long time for just trespassing.”
“I’m so sorry Cas.  Can we talk and maybe mend what I destroyed.  God you still have the same effect on me you did then.  You’re mesmerizing.  I promise I am out and proud now.  Please give me another chance.” Dean pleaded.
“Son of a bitch!  I love you.  I’ve loved you for years and not as just a damn friend.  Are you happy?  I’ve had a crush on my best friend who doesn’t see me as anything but a friend.  Are you satisfied?” Dean’s fighting tears too now.
The DJ, Ash, Castiel thought his name was motioned to Castiel that it was his turn.  Castiel stood and walked out of the shadow and turned to glare at Dean.  The green eyed adonis saw him.  Castiel couldn’t decipher the look on Dean’s face.  Was he angry, sad or just surprised?  Well Castiel didn’t care.  He squared his shoulders and walked to Ash.  He whispered in Ash’s ear the change in song.  Ash responded, “Sure man no problem.”  Castiel walked confidently on stage glancing at Dean before taking the mic.
“I am writing to Eileen to let her know we are safe.” Sam reponds not taking his attention away from his letter.
"I suppose." Sam said, taking a seat on a plush sofa.
“You can go away too!  Go back to your girlfriend or wife and leave me be.” Castiel shouted.  He couldn’t be sad.  He needed to be angry because sadness would make him do something stupid.  Like beg Dean.  He wasn’t going to allow that.
“What do you mean?” Dean is totally confused by the gorgeous man’s demeanor.
Dean wanted someone to share his life with but alas he’d had no luck.  His last relationship ended when Lisa cheated on him.  Before that, Aaron had broken up with him because his parents wouldn’t accept Dean because he wasn’t Jewish.  Needless to say, Dean was a little gun shy when it came to dating.
After placing a large bouquet of roses on his mother’s grave, Dean accompanies his fiance to his mother, Naomi’s grave.  They got her the biggest bouquet of daisies they could find.  Dean tied a get well soon balloon to it because he thought it was funny.
Not long after he mated Dean, Castiel told the alpha about all the flowers that showed up in his dreams.  Dean immediately found him a book on the language of flowers.  Now Castiel knows their meaning and he understands his dreams more.
“Yeah she’s a mama bear.” Castiel said, sounding sleepy.  Dean moved down Castiel’s body and started massaging his boyfriend’s glorious ass.  “Dean I didn’t hurt my ass.”
Castiel lays his hand on the small bump that holds their fourth child and lets his mind wonder.  Eight years ago he was in Pontiac being abused by the people who called themselves his family.  Now he is happy in Lawrence with his true family and Pontiac is no more.  Michael and Lucifer were captured by King Crowley and never heard from again.  Hester was killed by her own mercenaries, when she refused to surrender to Crowley’s men.  Queen Noami died of the fever during the siege of Castle Pontiac.  Castiel did not mourn them.
“Noted.” Castiel replies.
"I think it's possible.  It's too early to truly know his intentions yet.  We need to be careful how much we ask for.  In two weeks when I am married and mated to the king, we'll have a stronger standing." Dean reasoned.
Right after the sunset, Bumblebee announced his return by jumping up on the keyboard of Castiel’s laptop.  “Where have you been, Bumblebee?” Castiel said as he picked the cat up to put in his lap.  Castiel gave him a few pats before getting up with the cat in his arms.  Bumblebee chattered to him as they made their way to the kitchen.  He placed Bumblebee on the counter so he could meticulously measure out the cat’s food and get him fresh water.  For himself he reheated leftovers from the night before.  When one lives alone, there are always leftovers.
“Yes Dean.  You are not just smart but brave.  You are braver than me.  I’ve wanted this a long time Dean.” Castiel admits just before he steals another kiss.
“You can help Sam.  I’m not smart enough to take up your time.” Dean says trying to back out of the room.
They sat and ate while watching an omega duck and ducklings swim on the shimmering water.  Castiel brought out a pie he had made and Dean couldn’t help but moan over the offering.  They talked about everything and nothing and before the omega realized it the sun was starting to set.
“Yes, Principal Winchester!” the students call out.
“Thank you… P.S. If you’re not feeding him intentionally and he’s actually breaking into your home and eating your food… Sorry.”  Dean couldn’t resist anymore after that.  He threw his head back and laughed unabashed.  It felt good and some of the tension that had been building in his shoulders throughout the day released.
“No way.  I didn’t even know the old goat knew how to use a computer.  That’s one place you don’t go without permission.  Last person that tried got an ass full of rock salt.  Then arrested.”
“What shall we do with our stolen time, mate?” Dean said, pulling the alpha into his arms.
"I want the ceremony set for no more than a fortnight from now.  Prince Dean and Prince Samuel will be given rooms in the royal wing befitting of their status.  Dean will dine with me at breakfast and supper, so we might become more acquainted before we mate." Castiel declared.  The alpha couldn't wait to find out all his future mate's quirks.
“Haven’t you learned not to judge a book by its cover.  I am a hardass but I’m also a closet nerd.  I larp with Charlie every other weekend along with my little brother Sam.  I love Star Trek and Star Wars. I read with whatever freetime I have left after working on cars in my Uncle Bobby’s shop.” Dean says standing tall.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why Dean so you can just fuck me over and use me somemore.  I mean I’m just expendable.  The next time a hot piece of ass comes your way, you’ll throw me away.  Do me a favor and just leave me alone.” Castiel turns away from Dean with tears in his eyes.
“Yes Claire.  Your Dad and I grew to love each other.  Well after a few arguments.” Castiel answers chuckling.
“Maybe a little at first.  Dean will be gentle.  John has spoken with Dean.  It is important you realize Dean is a virgin as well and sought out his father’s counsel this morning.  You have nothing to fear.  Dean will guide you and cherish you.  Don’t fear it.  The bonding is something you’ll never want to forget.” Queen Mary confided.  The words did sooth Castiel’s worries.
“You don’t think it foolish?  My parents and siblings were very cruel when it came to my propensity toward doodling as they called it.”  Castiel asked with apprehension.
The sky grew even darker and Castiel decided he’d better pack up before he was drenched by the coming rain storm.  His mother would punish him if he ruined his clothes again.  He would also have to be careful not to rip his trousers, when he climbed down the wall.  He’d done that a fortnight ago and his mother had denied him meals for two days.  By the time he was finally allowed to eat he was near fainting.
“Sure Cas.” Dean says grinning when the alpha blushes at the shortening of his name.  “Hope you don’t mind that I chose The Roadhouse.” Dean says taking his seat.  “Ellen is a family friend.”
"You are aware that I care little for finery.  It's nice but not needed.  I am more concerned with the security that King Castiel can provide.  He's already considering going after Azazel in my honor."  Dean sounded like he was defending the alpha.
When dinner was over and Sam and Dean were finally alone in their chambers, Dean allowed himself to take a deep breath.  This court was nothing like anything Dean had known before.  He had yet to decide whether this was to their benefit yet.  Dean needed to be cautious.
“Dean, seriously, my whole face and clothing are sticky.” the omega complains.
“Don’t know about that.  I mean you’re a hot shot lawyer.  I don’t think what I do compares.” Dean says fidgeting.
“Your scent says you speak truth.” Castiel said moving closer to the alpha.
"Whatever do you mean?" Dean questioned.
Today Castiel decided to try his hand at forced perspective.  He decided to draw the wide landscape that he could see from his leaf covered hiding place.  The cobbled road wound through the land beyond the palace’s walls.  Beyond the walls, was a place Castiel had never been permitted to go.  He’d only be permitted to leave when he was mated to some alpha his parents chose to further their own ambitions.
Dean usually feels silly slow dancing but not with Castiel.  He feels so at ease.
Castiel hadn’t been in a relationship since.  He’d had encounters but he never let it go past sex.  It was all about the release because emotions were dangerous.  Dean Winchester had ruined him.  Fuck!   He still wanted to leave so bad but the voice that had gotten him through the last ten years yelled, “Show him!  Make him see what a bastard he is!”
“I think the fact that you don’t know makes this worse.  A month ago, what was supposed to happen?” Dean just stares at Castiel clueless.
Dean and Castiel married during his first Christmas break and spent their honeymoon in a cabin in the mountains.  The cabin belonged to a friend of Bobby’s named Rufus.  Dean had entertained his new husband with the story of how Bobby and Rufus had argued over a poker game once and Bobby ended up shooting Rufus with rock salt.
Before Castiel took his seat,  he took Prince Dean's hand and placed a chaste kiss upon it.  The omega seemed startled by the gesture but seemed to remember himself quickly by giving a slight bow to the King.  Dean watched him intently as he acknowledged everyone else and took his seat.  Once the king was seated, the rest of the party sat.
“Yeah.  I think she might have a crush on you too, my love.” Castiel said laughing.
“Well as long as I get to worship my alpha as well, I’m game.” Dean said before seizing Castiel's mouth in an almost violent kiss.
“Oh and what was that?” Dean asks as he nods to Garth, who is there to take over for him.  Dean follows blue eyes into the crowd.  The food smells from the booths smell good, making Dean’s stomach growl more.
Believe me
“Well Prince Dean of Lawrence, when do we leave?” Castiel says entwining his fingers with the alpha’s.
“Did you piss off your girlfriend?” Dean finds himself asking.  So sue him, he’s curious.
“Good to know.”
“You’ve been a busy guy.” Dean remarks as he inspects the treats.  “Fuck, I love me some pie.  Thanks Cas.” Dean adds excited.
They rarely got to spend Saturday’s together being lazy like this.  They were usually working or Castiel was studying or both.  Today though a significant snow storm was supposed to hit.  Ellen decided to close down The Roadhouse for safety.  Castiel was caught up with his studies so they were totally free.  He would soon be done with the first semester of his sophomore year.   Castiel had been recently trying to convince Dean that he should further his education, either in college or a trade school.  Dean was still resisting but Castiel thought he might be wearing him down.  Missouri had even been helping by chatting Dean up about it when they visited her.
Castiel was sitting on a blanket in a meadow filled with pink roses and baby's breath.  Somewhere in the distance he can hear Dean speaking to someone.  The alpha is explaining to someone unseen about what kingdoms border Lawrence and which direction they are.  Castiel hears a cry and looks down to see a pink bundle of blankets move.  The omega wakes from the dream the moment he’s about to pull the blanket aside to see what is inside.
Well Sam didn’t lie, the alpha is polite and very unalpha-like.
“Well, well, Casticle!  What has crawled up your ass and died?” Gabriel says letting himself into Castiel’s apartment.
Today Castiel and Dean were getting dressed to attend their son, Jack’s graduation from high school.  Claire was home from college to cheer her brother on.
“You’re not having second thoughts?” Charlie asks with concern.
Dean had accepted that their dad, John had left them for good this time.  The night before John had abandoned them, Dean had heard him talking on the phone.  Apparently on one of John’s ‘business trips’ he’d picked up a girlfriend.  Dean had heard enough to know she was pregnant.  John had abandoned them for a new family with a woman that didn’t want to raise someone else's kids.
“Why the W?  Are we not in the Kingdom of Lawrence?” Castiel asked.
“Thank you, my love.” Castiel says when Dean hands him his beer.
Castiel hoped he didn’t have to teach his high school English classes via Zoom for much longer.  It was better than putting people at risk of catching Covid-19 but he missed teaching in person so much.
“Castiel feels the same for you.  Jess is with him now.  She texted that he’s pacing.  He can’t wait to marry you Dean.  So pin this flower on and come on jerk.” Sam says tossing a yellow boutonniere at him.
"It could undermine your authority." Gabriel warned.
‘Yes, I do.” Dean responded with no hesitation.
Castiel takes off his ball cap and wipes his forehead on his arm.  Sweat is starting to run down his face and into his eyes causing them to burn uncomfortably.  He replaces his cap which his half-brother, Gabriel, had bought him.  It has a rooster on it and Gabriel had laughed and said it was perfect for him because he liked cock.  Gabriel could be crude but at least he was accepting of him being gay, unlike most of Castiel’s remaining family.
“What is all this giggling I hear?” Dean said, trying to sound stern but failing.
Once dressed, Castiel and Dean eat the breakfast of hot pancakes and strawberries that Dean brought.  The omega doesn’t want to get out of bed but Dean says they have all sorts of surprises planned for him.  Castiel fights embarrassment over all the fuss being put toward him.
“Hurry up and eat alpha.” Dean said as his scent went extremely aroused.  Castiel was wolfing down his burger so quickly Dean thought he might choke.  The omega was in for a wild night and he couldn’t wait.
Dean smiled and pulled his boyfriend into a hug.  “Love you too!  Thank you for sticking with me.” Dean said fighting not to get too emotional.
“I want that Dean.  I want to be with you forever.” Castiel admitted, looking into Dean’s eyes with such renewed hope.
“I’ve heard her talk about you.  She called you a badass.” Dean said, looking Castiel over.
“Really?” Castiel says almost disbelieving.
“Your mom’s a dick.  I never even got the chance for my dad to reject me for being bi.  He abandoned me and Sammy for his new family.  I haven’t told Sammy about that yet.  Don’t really want to tell him.” Dean says as he dries the last dish and they sit down at the small breakfast table.
King John was speaking, “We are gathered here at the mating feast of Prince Dean and Prince Castiel.  I bless this union and pray they find love and comfort with each other until death parts them.  Dean, do you promise to honor Castiel until your dying day?”
TWO YEARS LATER
(See the end of the chapter for
King John had been nice and respectful and seemed to be allowing his son to do almost all the talking.  It was all so strange to the omega.  Castiel was so accustomed to Michael talking over everyone until there was hardly any oxygen left in the room.  Castiel had always carefully remained silent to save him the wrath of punishment.
*** Two Years Later ***
At the end of the night Castiel walks Dean to the Impala.  “I really like you Dean.” Castiel says as they reach the car.
Castiel is losing control of the discussion.  “Jo don’t be crude.  Kevin is entitled to his opinion and view of the story.  Now the major theme of this story is guilt.  This theme will be carried over into your weekend reading assignment.  I would like you to read Poe’s, The Tell-Tale Heart.”
Dean points to the flyer and says through actual giggles, “I’m the one that has been feeding this cat.”  Dean can’t help but laugh more at Becky’s expression.  The woman really is a strange duck.  “Can you tell me who posted this?” Dean asks when he gets his mirth under control.
“Yeah well she was swinging a butcher knife in my general direction and threatening to cut my balls off.  You’d be pale too.” Dean countered.
Day 27: Holding Hands
THE END
“Forever” they say together.
“Dean!  You’re embarrassing me.”  Sam mumbles, visibly flushing bright red.
Day 17: “I’m cold.”  “Here, have my jacket.”
“He talks about how you practically raised him and about the stories you tell about being a substitute teacher.  He shows me the pictures of cars you’ve restored, when you work with your Uncle Bobby on the weekends.  You are inspiring.” Castiel says, smiling a gummy smile.
Dean and Sam took some time but they finally decided to meet Adam.  He was a good kid and they kept in touch with him.  He was innocent in all of it and family after all.
The alpha turned to the omega taking the omega’s hands into his, “I wished that by my birthday we would be mated.”
“No.  I am fine.  Dean is very strong and gentle.” Castiel responds as the blond omega who could be none other than Queen Mary, takes his hand.
“I love you, Dean.” Castiel whispered, when they parted.
“A beer.” Dean grunts and waits for Castiel to object to his drink choice but he doesn’t.
And I hate to say I want you
“Dean you are straight.  Or that’s what you told me when you broke me.”  Castiel spat out still fueled by anger.
You will never know that feeling
Dean stands, “Let’s go hot stuff.” Castiel laughs and takes Dean’s hand.
“Are you coyly trying to inquire if I am single, Dean?” Castiel says grinning wider.
“I dream often that my father takes me away and locks me up.  I’m never allowed to see you again.” Castiel confesses.
2 ½ Years Later
He heard the door behind him open.  “Leave me alone, Balthazar.” Castiel said dejected.
After chores were complete, Dean would always meet Castiel on top of the shed.  Sometimes Sam would come with but Sam had formed his own friendships.  Tonight Dean set next to Castiel alone and the mood was somber.
“Really?  Why do we need a bigger place?” Dean asked as he himself started to strip.
As they walked Dean could tell something was on Cas’ mind.  “Alright out with it.  Tell me what’s eating you.”
Castiel is just about to rise to start his morning absolutions when the door of his bedchamber is kicked open by his smiling alpha.  “Happy Name Day omegamine!” Dean yells loud enough to wake the entire castle.
“Sweet tea no lemon, please.” Castiel says politely.
“Where the hell have you been?” Kaia admonishes from her square on Castiel’s laptop.
"Thank you Charlie.  In private, just call us Sam and Dean and curtsies are not necessary.  We need clothing that is adequate to be in the presence of the King Castiel. We only have the clothes we are wearing." Dean informed the maid.
“Are you serious?” Dean waits until Castiel nods yes before he picks Castiel up and twirls around with him in his arms.  “Yes, we don’t have to wait to live together.  You'll be close to school and I’ll be close to Sam and Bobby.  It’s perfect.” Dean couldn’t believe how things had come together.
Dean is sitting and pondering when Bobby is all of a sudden standing right in front of him, scaring him half to death.  “I’m to take you down to the gardens.  The king is waiting to take that walk with you.  Are you alright son?  You look spooked.”
“Cas, you’re adorable when you get all smitey.” Dean says, smiling goofily.
“Yes.  I want a mini you.” Dean said smiling.
“You did it Dean!” Sam said, giving his big brother a high five.
They got out of the bath just in time to get their food at the door from Ash. Castiel was smiling and eating his burger with pleasure.  Dean snuck a picture with his phone of his alpha’s smile.  Castiel scowled at the omega.  “It’s only fair.  You snuck a picture of me.” the omega said in defense.
“I don’t start teaching until August. I’ll still be working at Ellen’s over the summer and weekends during the school year.  I’m hoping that maybe we can start looking for a bigger place soon.” Castiel said taking off his dress shoes in preparation of taking off the ill fitting suit he was wearing.
“Don’t do that.  You are a prince and above that a genuine good person.” Bobby declared making Dean smile.  Bobby never made him feel like just an omega.
“Here, have my jacket.” Dean says draping his leather jacket over Castiel’s shoulders.  “Let’s go to dinner.  A first date, if you agree.”
Day 12: Baking Cookies
“A year.”
“Leave it to Charlie and Gilda to have a Harry Potter slash fairy wedding cake.” Dean chuckles as he goes through the door.  “Sweetheart.” Dean calls out.
Dean blushed because it was obvious the alpha meant what he said.  The innocence on Castiel’s face made it all the more endearing.  “I’m happy to be here with you.” Dean said smiling and hoping he didn’t sound as awkward as he felt.
“No.” Castiel said, mouth full of pizza.
“No.  You will be my consort and my equal.  In Lawrence, omegas are honored.  We will not mate until you spend some time in my kingdom getting to know me and my people.” Dean said holding his hands out showing he meant no harm.
“I don’t give a lot of credence to ghost hunting and they’ll just have to be jealous.  I had full permission by the owner to be there.” Castiel says smugly.
The sky grows dark and yet Castiel can’t force himself to abandon his perch.  He loved this spot on the wall surrounding the palace garden.  He could stay hidden by the canopy of the beautiful oak tree that had grown up against the old stone wall built by his grandfather, the late King Charles.  In private they had called him Chuck.  Here on his perch, he could pretend he wasn’t an omega prince, son of King Michael.  He could forget that his mother, Queen Naomi, thought him defective and broken.
“Not really.” Dean says, making Castiel’s heart sink.  “I would like to spend time with you alone though.” Dean finishes and Castiel can’t help but smile.
“Fuck you Benny!  I have just as much right to be here as any.” The man with what Castiel could only describe as a face that looked like it was angry more than not, most of the time.
“Dean.” Castiel said darkly.
Carnival Meet Cute
And I hate to say I need you
Castiel does his best to stay calm in the face of this handsome man who is fanboying all over him.  He ran into subscribers before but none as gorgeous and fascinating as Dean.  “It always nice to meet a fan.” Castiel says letting his voice go deeper than his already normal deep voice.  This makes Dean blush even more.
Becky got off on charging everyone in the neighborhood for the most mundane infractions.  Dean had paid quite a few in the past without complaint but Becky had picked the wrong day to mess with him.  Dean didn’t even go in the house for dry clothes.  He got in his car soaked through still clutching the red paper.  He was going to go down to the HOA office and give Becky a piece of his mind.
Dean cups his hand over Castiel baby bump,  “I can’t wait to feel their first kick.  Do you want a boy or girl, Cas?” Dean asks as he rubs the omega’s belly.
The ceremony seemed to be going on forever to Dean.  The damn robe and hat he wore, felt like it was slowly cooking him alive.  Since his last name came at the end of the alphabet, he was one of the last to receive his diploma.  The longer he waited the more nervous he became.  He felt like he was going to vibrate apart with nerves soon.  When Dean finally walked across the stage to receive his diploma, he felt wobbly, like a newborn kitten.  He didn’t remember how he got back to his seat but he did.  He clutched his diploma like it was a holy relic.
They’d just finished with their lunch when there is a knock at the door and Bobby steps in.  “A Sir Mosely is waiting to meet with you two.  Should I send her in?”
Meant to Be
Castiel feet are planted on the ground with Dean’s arms around him for support.  “Bobby, the ride had him stiff and sore.  I carried him to get him out of the cold quicker.” Dean says in his defense.”
“Damn it Sammy!  I’ve already done that.  You didn’t have to put so much force in it.  Are you hurt, Omegamine?” Dean asks as he clears Castiel’s eyes of cream.
“Please stay.  Stay with me Cas.” Dean pleads.
Dean’s day had been stressful.  He had substituted at the local high school as the gym teacher.  Things had gotten out of hand as they played dodgeball.  The day ended with one kid having a bloody nose.  Dean was afraid he was in trouble but the nurse and the principal said he did an excellent job.  The last time dodgeball was played a kid lost a tooth, one went to the hospital with a concussion and they had two kids with bloody noses.  Dean just shook his head and wondered why they even still played the dangerous game.
They had dinner in Bobby’s kitchen that night.  Afterwards, Castiel asked Dean to take a walk with him in the junkyard.
“I’m not sure Ellen is completely human.  I’ve been scared of her ever since I met her.” Dean responded as he moved to Castiel’s lower back.
“Well if you would have asked, I would have gladly said yes.  You’re the one that is out of my league.  You’re cool whereas I’m a big nerd.” Castiel said, now shivering noticeably.
That night Dean threw out all his pills and fantasized about his and Castiel’s future.
"Prince Dean, what do you say to the king's proposal?" Gabriel said considering the omega with a critical eye.
Dean had been trying to get a hold of their Uncle Bobby so they could stay with him but Bobby was on one of his annual road trips. Dean had talked to Bobby’s neighbor on the phone and she promised to tell Bobby they were looking for him the minute he got home.  They ran out of what little money they had.  The motel was paid up for a week but Sammy was getting hungry.  Dean only stole the bread and peanut butter to feed Sammy.  The sheriff, Garth, had brought them both here until a guardian could be found.  Now Dean didn’t know what was going to happen but at least Sammy had food and somewhere safe to sleep.
“I’ve had the experience of being in a relationship with just such a man.  He ended up actually cheating though and then tried to make it my fault that he did.  Never again.” Castiel says looking into his empty glass.
“What?” Castiel was confused and his anger was fading.
I think there will be at least one more installment.  Leave me a comment.
“Come in.” Dean insists.  Castiel follows the man into the apartment, admiring the man’s deliciously bowed legs.
Castiel’s Sweet Treats
Castiel stood and took in the bowing omega princes.  The younger of the two was lanky, with long hair and skittishly refused to look at the king.  Castiel moved on to the older of the two.  This omega, though bowing, looked the king dead in the eyes.  There was strength there and defiance.  Castiel found that and the enchanting green eyes of this omega, attractive.  Next he scented the omega and found himself swaying slightly.  This omega's aroma was intoxicating.
“Not really.” Castiel says with a mischievous smirk.
“Cas, you can’t just go dark like that!  I didn’t know where you were and that’s not okay.” Dean yells at his best friend.  Castiel had been ignoring his calls and texts for almost a month.
Dean was very good and Castiel sucked Dean’s cock while fingering him until he came and became oversensitive.  Then fucked Dean until he was screaming and Castiel came.  Dean slept like the dead afterward and Castiel fell asleep with a satisfied smirk on his face.
When Bumblebee had first come home from the shelter, he’d seemed so sad and uncertain about everything.  It wasn’t long though before the yellow striped cat perked up and stole Castiel’s heart.  Castiel only feared now that he’d lose his one constant companion to his adventures outside.  The thought was untenable.
“Yeah.  Class got cut short.  Gabriel was trying to teach the class to make creme brulee.  Kevin managed to set fire to his apron and a stack of napkins.  No one was hurt but the classroom was a mess and Kevin was freaked out.” Castiel said, sitting down his camera and shucking off his trusty trenchcoat.
Day 28: Wish Upon a Star
They’d had their usual Christmas Eve dinner with their family and friends the night before.  Castiel wanted to make Christmas morning and day all about the pups.  Castiel spent the day snapping picture after picture of the pups as they got their gifts from Santa.  He probably had hundreds of pictures of Claire and Ben playing with the wrapping paper and the boxes while ignoring the actual toys.  Dean couldn’t stop smiling.
Dean was still looking into the mirror, thinking about that night, stroking his mark, when he heard the click of a camera.  The omega turned to find his mate, camera in hand, smiling sheepishly.  “I couldn’t help it.  You’re so beautiful.” Castiel explained.
“I am not interested in a romantic interlude and I’m a very private person.” Castiel says avoiding Becky’s stare by focusing on his flyer on the board.  “Well I must be on my way.”  He said as a goodbye to her.  Becky made a sound like she wished to halt Castiel’s escape but he paid no heed to her.  He didn’t pause until he made it to his Pruis.  He sped away as fast as the car would allow.
Dean laughs at his omega’s outburst of cursing.  “It is a Winchester Family name day tradition.  I took it easy on you.  On Sam’s last name day, it took a week to get all the cream off the walls and out of the bedding.” Dean says giggling at the memory.
Day 10: Slow Dancing
“You mean that?” Castiel says shyly.
“Alright, enough of that.  What are we doing for dinner?  If we are cooking, we’re going to have to go shopping.” Castiel said, turning over on his back.
Castiel is in his bed alone in the House of Winchester.  He is betrothed to Prince Dean of Lawrence.  They are not mated yet because they must court first.  Today is his Name Day.  In the past, this day was not celebrated much because his birth family cared so little for him.  Gabriel and Anna would slip him gifts early in the morning and kiss him and tell him they loved him.  They are not here and Castiel mourns for their company.  He doesn’t know what today will hold in his new home.  He’s been here a little over a month and he must remind himself that this is all real.  He is free.  He is loved.
Castiel was brought out of his musings by Gabriel loudly clearing his throat.  "My king, I present to you the omega princes Dean and Samuel of the Kingdom of Lawrence.  They are here seeking asylum.  Their father was killed in a coup just a few days ago.  Their bodyguard, Sir Singer was able to smuggle them out of the city before they could be captured.  Do you wish to grant them asylum?" Gabriel asked loud enough for the entire room to hear.
“Those are ridiculous notions.  Do you desire more education?  I can make that happen for you and Sam.”  Castiel says gently, taking the older omega’s hand into his.
Chuck has moved to the corner that holds the scaled down models of all the home the community offers in a glass case.  The dude goes back to staring absently.  That when Dean notices that when Chuck looks like he’s staring into space, he’s actually stealing glances at Becky.  Becky is now just awkwardly staring back with a look of wonder Dean would subscribe to a kid on Christmas morning.  Dean groans and feels like he’s going to throw up his burger if they don’t quit.
“What did he tell you?” Dean said, smirking.  He set the tray on the floor so he could join them in the pillow fort.
“I’ve have almost ten years in at Sandover.  I’ve worked there ever since I graduated college.” Castiel counters.
Castiel tried not to think much about that as he added the grand carriage that was making its way up the road toward the palace.  Who knew who it might be.  So many nobles came and went but no one ever told Castiel anything.  He was just an omega, not worth informing.
“So… umm… do you ever take anyone with you when you explore?” Dean asks avoiding eye contact.
“Call me John or Father.”  John corrected.  Dean leaned over and kissed the omega’s cheek.  Castiel couldn’t help but blush and both alphas chuckled.
He was heartbroken over leaving Castiel behind.  He’d spent most of everyday with Cas and they had developed quite a bond.  Bobby had promised that Dean could borrow a car to visit as soon as they could get him licensed.  Missouri even offered to bring Castiel to visit at least once in the meantime. Everyone was supportive of their budding relationship.  Castiel and Dean hadn’t voiced it outloud but they considered themselves boyfriends.
“Lillith was very particular but I think we managed to pull it off and make her happy.” Castiel said, looking relieved.
She was so angry at first but after counseling she settled into the home like she had always been there.  Eighteen months later they were able to legally adopt her as well.  Claire and Jack got along famously.  Claire was a slightly corrupting influence on Jack though.  The prank war they orchestrated against Castiel and Dean resulted in a window needing to be replaced and both of them grounded for two weeks.
“Damn it Dean!  You are smart.  You can do things I’ll never be able to.  All I have is facts where you have a working knowledge of how things work.  I could see you being a great engineer one day while I hide behind a book.” Castiel says sternly,
“He’s my friend and business partner.  Nothing more.  I’ve never been able to be in a relationship since…”  Castiel couldn’t give it words in that moment.
“That is one ugly car.” Dean can’t help but say.
“Very true.” Dean says watching Sam and Eileen kissing on the dance floor.
“I do.  You’re omega is compatible with Castiel.  You’re already starting to form the beginnings of a bond with him.  Once you’re mated your bond will be profound.  Maybe even to the degree of a true mates’ bond.” Sam says taking a seat at the writing desk and picking up a quill.
The alpha is carrying a tray with very appetizing smells wafting from it.  Dean appears to be about to sit the tray down when the alpha picks up a cream pie with one hand while sitting the tray down with the other.  Before the omega can react the alpha is smearing the pie pan of cream into his face.  “What the hell, Dean!” Castiel screeches.
Dean shines his flashlight into the trunk when it opens and smiles.  There is the blanket and picnic basket the alpha used on the first date the alpha was in charge of.  Instead of a cooler there are two thermoses of hot chocolate.  “Is this why you were late getting ready?” Dean asked, absolutely touched by it all.
“Seriously?!  You got permission from Rufus Turner?” Dean says sounding incredulous.
“Good. Today I have court business to attend to but I would love to take a walk in the gardens with you before dinner, Dean.” King Castiel says hopeful.
“I’m cold.” Castiel finally admits.
“Very fucking unlikely!” Dean yelled.  He made himself take calming breaths.  “I’m not here to entertain your insane infatuation with my little brother.  I am here to talk about this bullshit!” Dean said, holding up the red piece of paper clutched tightly in his hand.
********
"It could but I will avenge the wrongs done to my mate.  You are going to be my mate in fourteen days.  Your sorrows are mine.  I will get justice for you, I swear it." Castiel didn't know what was coming over him.  His alpha seemed to be already bonding to the omega.
"Cousin, have you lost your senses?  You've never once showed any true interest in taking a mate.  There was that one time, I thought Lady Meg had caught your eye but nothing ever came of it.  Explain to me what you see in this omega prince." Gabriel insisted.
The sun is bright but the wind has a slight chill as fall sets in.  Castiel can hear Dean talking to their seven year old son, Ben, off near where the tree line is at the edge meadow.  Lately, Ben has been fascinated with a compass his Uncle Sam gave him on his last name day.  Castiel can hear Dean telling Ben what kingdoms are in what directions using the compass as a guide.
“Naomi was allergic to daisies.” Castiel says grinning.
King John and Queen Mary are his parents.  Prince Sam was his loyal brother in law.  Prince Gabriel and Princess Anna were here with him and supporting him.  Prince Gabriel had married a visiting dignitary’s daughter, named Kali.  Princess Anna joined the academy of artists.  Sam was mated to a foreign orphaned princess, named Eileen.  They were happy and also expecting their first born this winter.  Life was good.
“Hey Babe.  I’m going to pick up dinner, any special requests?” Dean asks as he leans down and kisses Castiel’s forehead.
So it was a he who owned the cat.  “If I leave a message would you see that the owner gets it?”
“Adequately.  Sam however is a terror on a horse.” Dean says laughing.
“Not good enough?  No one else asked me so it is rational to infer that I must be the one not good enough.” Castiel said, losing his battle, as a single tear slid down his face.
“Anything... everything… will you give me a chance to prove I love you.  That I am not just the dick I’ve been to you.” Dean pleads.
Day 19: Watching the Sunset
“Yes.  You can get the tattoo or you can wear a piece of jewelry with the symbol or both.  My father, Sam and I, all have tattoos where my mother wears a necklace with the symbol.” Dean answers, rubbing his thumb soothingly over the back of the omega’s hand.
