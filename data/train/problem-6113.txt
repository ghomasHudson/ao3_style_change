“No, it’s fine. You just go, lover-boy,” Yaël teases him, and much to Peter’s surprise, Cap actually blushes at that.
“Harry, what are you telling me, here?” Peter asks, confused as to why Harry would suddenly say all this.
And Steve couldn’t help but feel some bitterness at the idea that Tony went behind his back. He didn’t really know
Harry’s eyes widen, his mouth falling open as his breath catches. “Me? On a mission? Avengers-mission?”
“Stay calm! It’s only a spike, it’ll soon stabilize!” Otto shouts, holding up a hand to stop everybody. People start muttering in fear, clearly unsettled about it. The crowd takes their steps back, distancing themselves from the source of the panic. An alarm starts ringing right when metal plates are being pulled from the wall.
Without any warning, Tony leans forward, grabbing Steve by the cheek and kissing him full on the mouth. It’s not a quick peck, not at all. It’s something more than that; a promise that he’s fine, that he’s doing better. A promise that he will try and be someone
Standing up, the girl suddenly puts a hand on Peter’s cheek and suddenly kisses him on the lips. It’s a quick peck, almost as if it’s something they do all the time.
“No, I want to stay in school, I just… I needed to talk to somebody,” he assures Tony. “I’ll be fine, just… can you tell me something? Doesn’t matter what.”
There’s a slight panic going through Peter when he wakes up in a strange place. The room he’s currently in is not his own; where are his posters? His top-bunk bed in which he likes to climb in so much? His messy desk full with electronical devices he took from random dumpsters to mash something together?
“I just figured out my dad wasn’t really my dad, and there’s a slight possibility that my real dad is still alive, and now I’m waiting for the DNA results,” Peter finds himself saying before he can really think of it.
Best to just put the phone down, he realizes. Peter is not going to like him going through his stuff. Tony sighs and lets it go, finally heading to the kitchenette and preparing the hot Coco.
Rhodey just laughs, and so does Happy. “She ain’t lying, Peter. Tony’s mother was Italian. He speaks it fluently.”
The past few weeks have been quite of a whirlwind. With losing his hearing due to the damage caused in their attack against Venom, Peter found himself a subject of multiple prototypes built by his own father and the princess of Wakanda. Not even for a second they’ve stopped to get some rest, working together to find the best solution there is for Peter. And they’ve tried with hearing aids, and it helped for a bit, except for the fact that they kept on falling off during battles and whenever he was swinging.
Tony follows JARVIS’ instructions to the base. It’s not the compound, but it is some kind of facility. It looks nothing like Tony’s base, but it seems… nice, in a way. For people who don’t have as much money, that is.
But while Bruce left the lab sometimes to get some food into him, Tony didn’t. The others didn’t exactly pay attention about it, but Steve did. That was why he often prepared an extra tray of food and brought it down to the lab.
People congratulate Jane, ask her about the baby’s due date and how exactly they should expect the wedding to go. Peter isn’t listening at all, instead focused on the three other people that have entered the great hall.
“No, Peter!” Tony shouts. Then his eyes go wide and he sags his shoulders again, hiding his eyes underneath his hand. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have shouted.”
He should call Steve, tell him that he overreacted and that he shouldn’t have worked it out on him, but Tony knows that, even if Steve would just come back, the same thing would happen again. He can’t control it, this constant fear. Tony just needs more time to get his thoughts straight.
Peter doesn’t stay around to hear his reaction. With one quick shot, he’s already back in the air, on his way once more through the streets, in search of anything to do.
Okay, so living alone for two weeks had been…an experience?In the beginning Yaël cleaned her apartment every day. Despite that, it still smelled like turd, mixed with rotting dead animal.
“Of course, you do, Yaël…” Steve muttered a bit surprised. Yaël laid her head against his chest and yawned.
Or if it’s even a good idea to share the information with him. Surely, Peter probably already knows, if that DNA-test is something to go by, but does he need to know that Tony knows?
Whenever it’s Nat’s turn, she just sits down on a chair and starts looking around on her tablet, only paying attention to Tony whenever he raises his voice in annoyance whenever something doesn’t work right – which is quite often since the kid – Tony should just call him Peter now, to keep it simple – has practically been begging to bring Dum-E back here. Somehow, the two do kind of work good together.
“Yes, I, uh, I thought about changing from full-time to half-time at the hospital. Maybe look up some small houses in one of the calmer districts, you know?” she offers. Peter knows about her plans to move the apartment. To be honest, the biggest reason they’ve stayed in here all the time is because they couldn’t really afford anything bigger or better. And it was a good home for a while, but Peter can understand she would want to move out eventually.
“SHIELD’s legal again. They’ve erased all trace of HYDRA within themselves. And there’s a whole lot of trouble with all this talk about
Embarrassment aside, Peter managed to get himself a date with Gwen. After that, he got to work a bit with Dr. Connors – they were both trying to finish the project Dr. Connors and his dad started. He had been so busy, that he forgot to pick up the phone and remember to pick up his aunt – since Uncle Ben didn’t like her walking around alone in the evening.
The door is open now. Steve or Barnes must have left it like that, not bothering to close it. It might be for the best, too, in case they need to make a quick exit.
Already knowing how much of the suit works, he doesn’t need much time to figure out what exactly he needs to do.
Steve groans in frustration, and Natasha and Wanda both roll their eyes as well. If they’re going to involve Tony, things are seriously going to get out of hand.
FRIDAY is desperately trying to tell him something. Tony’s answer is automatic. Before he knows it, he’s punching back. Barnes is on the ground; who is he fighting with?
“Why did you do it, Felicia?” Peter asks, his chest aching at the idea that a friend, someone he thought he could trust, would do this. She just turns back to him, her green eyes almost glowing in the light.
“Thank you, Dad,” he says. Then he loosens his seat belt and reaches for the door. Tony, too, steps out to take his place behind the wheel. He watches Peter hurry back to the door, but before he gets inside, Peter turns to Tony with an arm raised in the air. “See you tomorrow! Love you!”
“Then you’re supposed to be dead,” Raido threw back “And what’s dead, is supposed to stay dead. So maybe you should just walk into the kingdom and die!”
“Yeah uh, thanks for letting me use this,” Peter mutters out, not really able to grasp what’s happening. The girl nods once before starting to walk off again. Meanwhile, Peter takes a good look around him, staring up in the sky in search for Stark Tower anywhere near.
“I set the bar on fire,” Yaël confessed while staring at the plate in her hands. She felt like it was a crime that Steve wasn’t as enthusiastic as she was about the plates. Steve stared at her for a moment, trying to find if Yaël’s answer was a joke or not.
“Dude, you were insane!” Ned says. Tony and Steve decide to take a few steps to the side to give the boys their privacy. While the four of them start to happily discuss his performance, Tony pulls up his phone and quickly takes a picture of it. Then, in just a matter of seconds, he turns the camera until it’s facing him and Steve.
“Miles!” Peter calls out with a wide smile, his hands in thick blue mittens which are holding a hot plate. “Here at last!”
Well, with that info, she couldn’t get a real job anywhere. Someone also wrote down she had asthma, but somehow, Yaël doubted that. There was something weird going on with her voice, she was sure about that. It sounded hoarse, like she was sick, had a cold.
But Steve couldn’t. Though he didn’t want to separate on any bad terms, he still approached Stark to shake his hand and thank him for the offer once Thor was gone. But he knew it was for the better to just start over fresh.
Tony has to wait about ten minutes before Steve finally rejoins him on the deck. Seeing him there with a suit that looks like Captain America’s, but clearly isn’t as good as the one Tony made for him, Tony fights the strong urge to comment on it.
“There’s nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, I go to a psychiatrist too, there’s nothing wrong with that.”
“Yaël, she blew herself into pieces, I’m sorry I have to put it like this, but you have to leave.” It was her fault, she had made Nilla mad like that and so the girl probably started steering too much fire in a fireproof cell. Nilla probably baked herself to death. Had it been an accident, or did she do it on purpose?
It hurts a lot, having to stop the car in such a short amount of time. His muscles strain from the pressure, and Peter ends up gritting his teeth as he slowly feels the webs slipping from his hands.
A few seconds just, though. After that, Tony puts on his orange sunglasses and holds up his arms as if to present himself. Pepper walks up to him and straightens his jacket before giving him another scowl.
One more hour, Peter spends on the arc reactor before starting to pack his stuff. He puts the reactor safely away in his desk, along with the blueprints he managed to snatch from Mr. Stark’s workplace. Then he takes his bag, throws it over his shoulder, and waves Dum-E goodbye.
Okay, Peter feels it’s about time to better hide into his bedroom. But, doing that would mean that he’ll have to get in between Steve and Tony, who are currently still at the beginning of the hallway, blocking the way in their discussion.
“How about tonight you stay over, because somebody still needs to watch me – though can’t we stop that? Haven’t I been doing pretty good, lately? – anyway, tomorrow morning, you’ll be gone and I’ll spend time with Peter while you do your Avengers-business, and Monday evening, I’ll pick you up at seven and take you out for dinner?”
“He’s stronger than I am,” Tony counters. There’s another shifting noise, and then Peter feels himself being lifted up from the couch, once again taken into Steve’s strong arms. Tony’s hand in his hair disappears as he’s being maneuvered away from the couch.
Steve just laughs uncertainly, passing a hand through his hair. Pepper doesn’t fail to notice the reddened cheeks he’s sporting.
“So, uh… you two are, uh, together?” Barnes asks, obviously trying to lighten the mood. He speaks in a hushed voice, but probably still loud enough for people to hear them. If his plan is to sneak up on them, he’s obviously not doing it right.
“They caught him. They’ve got him somewhere, here. Dr. Cho and her scientists are trying to find a way to cure him from whatever he’s got,” she tells him. Then the door opens again – gently, it seems like nobody wants to make too much noise here – and Mr. Stark walks inside the room. When he sees that Peter is awake, relief shows all over his face.
But Steve first introduces Tony to everybody. Steve doesn’t tell them a name, explaining that he doesn’t know it either. Tony’s just ‘Iron Man’, the hero who rather keeps his identity hidden. The other Avengers’ reactions are divided. Some are exited to see him, while others, like Natasha and Sam, don’t seem to trust him that much.
“’sup guys, forget your pin-number?” Peter asks casually. Simultaneously, all the plastic, cartoony faces of the Avengers turn to look at him. Then he points at them. “Whoa, you’re the Avengers! What are you guys doing here?”
Stopping the car in front of a secluded house – an address that was sent him anonymously through text, even though Tony can bet everything that it came from Romanoff – Tony takes off his sunglasses and pulls the flower crown from his neck. He’s been pretending to enjoy himself on the party, but now he doesn’t have to anymore. These people know everything – at least what they’ve known since before they left.
“I know, it sucks, but if there are some… unspoken feelings… we may need to just, you know, put it out there.”
Suddenly, the door opens and Peter looks behind him, seeing Bruce walk in with eyes open wide. Peter shrugs at him, giving him his ‘what can you do about it?’-look.
“Ståopp, beiskaldi!” Get up, bitch, she heard the woman whose face was hanging right above her own grunt in Norwegian. Yaël blinked a few times and saw a few features of the face that looked like her own change. The ochre eyes turned brown, the colorful hair turned blonde.
“Why didn’t you ever tell me about it?” Peter asks, then. It’s something really big to carry along all the time, so he’s a bit surprised that, of all people, Harry hasn’t come clean about this earlier. Harry’s never been shy about his feelings, after all.
Ned, who’s looking at him with wide eyes as if he’s just realized he’s Spider-Man. Oh, crap! Is his suit showing? Peter quickly looks down, but sees that it’s not the case.
Peter pulls his hood over his head and groans. In frustration, he pulls his headphones off his desk and listens to some music. It calms him down at least a little bit, but not enough for his heart to slow down a bit. Angered by everything happening, Peter clears his throat and comes to stand in front of his window.
The guy’s voice suddenly changes mid-sentence, and Peter actually looks to the side to see the man’s face shift into someone else’s as he pulls of what seems like some sort of mask. The guy then pulls off the dark-blonde wig he was wearing, turning towards Peter to give him a smile.
“Yeah, fun stuff,” Peter mutters out. He blinks twice when he sees Raido raise his hands in the air, trying to catch a snowflake. Is it him, or is the kid’s skin coloring blue? “What have you been up to?”
The closer they get to the scene, the more police cars there are showing. They appear to have made a perimeter, and there are hundreds of people standing at the sidelines trying to catch a glimpse of what is happening.
“Now I’ve just been so busy with the internship, I’ve been forgetting my meds. And then Francis installed an hour-clock to keep me from working overtime, since I tend to forget time as well, and I didn’t react too well to the clock since it kept on ticking every second away,” Peter continues. “I got so close to just, smashing the clock with my bare hands, and that’s when I knew I had to get out.”
“And ignore Mr. Stark’s wishes? I should be ashamed of even considering it,” Peter jokes in return. Johnny lets out a laugh.
“It’s- It’s not your fault, Tony. Stuff happened, and now me and the team, we have to hide for a bit,” he explains as simply as possible. Tony can’t comprehend much more. “Just until they’ve tweaked the accords and drop the charges on us. After that, I’ll be right back with you, alright?”
“I never thought a guy would hate that there's a hot girl digging them?” Michelle jokes before standing up. Then she slaps him on the shoulder and makes her exit again. “Better not break her heart, then. She’s now captain of the Decathlon team, and from what I heard, you two losers joined as well.”
In the elevator Peter looks at his phone, wondering if he should let MJ know where he is. There could be no trouble in that, right? It might be better for someone sober to know of his whereabouts. He quickly texts her a small message before putting the phone away.
“Aww, Miek, you’re alive!” Korg said happily. “He’s alive, guys! What was your question again?” A relieved sigh went over the whole room. Thor, obviously trying to ignore what weird shit just had happened, made a decision.
suit. I’ve built it with my Dad a few months ago. I think I get to have say in this, don’t you think?” Peter then throws himself from his bed, back on the ground. “Please, this is my chance to prove myself to him.”
“Sometimes I just get these panic attacks. My meds are supposed to stop them, but if they’re coming back I’ll probably have to switch medications again,” he admits. With the way his body is, it adapts itself easily to any changes that is brought upon it. Since the medication changes a small part of his hormone-production, his body must have habilitated itself to it. Immunity to the medicine means switching to something else again.
“Don’t bother, he’s already on his way,” Sharon stops her with a small hand gesture. “I came across him when I came here.”
“No, you don’t,” he counters, knowing Steve better than that. And then, Steve has the nerves to actually
So, his vision is black when he flies in the air (without actually flying), and it’s black when he lands on the ground with a loud ‘oof’, pain in his back and feeling as if there’s something poking him in the leg. He grunts, feeling like he can’t breathe at all.
“Not at all?” Peter says, raising his hands in an innocent gesture. He’s only planning on getting to the Penthouse and try and coax Mr. Stark in open the door, that’s all.
But then again, the lack of wanting to call it a ‘relationship’ comes more from Tony rather than Steve.
“Nah, guy’s probably busy trying to deal with whatever’s going on there,” he returns, though there’s an obvious lack of conviction in his voice. Miles knows Peter and Harry used to be best friends when they were kids, but after the man took over his father’s company, things must have been stressful. Adding to that, there’s also the anticipation of the upcoming wedding between Osborn and Elisabeth Allen.
With ease, she pulled gigantic ice spears from the water, right through the rainbow bridge. For a second Yaël was hopeful. Maybe Loki would make it in time, before they all got killed. Luckily, the spaceship was already able to fly away, as machine-gun-guy had destroyed the spear that was holding the ship back.
“No thanks to me?” Peter asks, voice shaking. “Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it but you didn’t listen! None of this would’ve happened if you had just listened to me!”
And now his phone goes off again. Peter groans while he reaches for the side, gritting his teeth together when another sting passes through him. He hadn’t expected Dr. Octavius’ claws to be so strong.
He’s not worried, because he timed it perfectly. In the corner of his eyes, with the limited sight he has left through his tears, he saw the three figures already nearing them. Which is why he took the chance to land that kick in the first place. That way, two can fly after the Goblin and hopefully
Peter’s mouth snaps shut, his eyes wide from surprise. Is his dad finally losing it? Should Peter call up Steve? Or would Tony be angry that he tried to meddle? Peter hesitates for a few moments longer before deciding to just listen. He heads into the opposite direction, grabbing his suitcase and everything else he needs for the week. Looking at the room, he figures he won’t be seeing it for another two weeks, maybe longer if his dad keeps on acting up like this. Peter really should reach out to the other Avengers.
"Your feelings don't matter right now, she destroyed the whole city. She only brought pain and destruction!"
, but that couldn’t mean that they hit the jackpot on the first try, right? Surely, there’s something else his mother used when she said that his father’s blood would not work on Peter?
Peter manages to sneak in Yael room for about an hour. He’s followed by Wade and Wanda, and the four of them are seated on the ground with dessert room-service brought along with countless of drinks. And Yael talks, about where she’s been. And it all sounds extremely weird. The fact that it almost completely matches Bruce’s story is indication enough that she’s not lying. There’s stuff she’s not saying, but nobody asks after it. She’ll say it on her own time. After she finishes, Wade starts talking, too. Bringing up a story about another one of his small adventures with Logan somewhere in Spain. How they got there, he’s yet to clarify. It leads to lots of laughter and tears in the eyes.
“Okay, say goodbye to your grandpa’s and then you go brush your teeth,” Peter instructs his daughter fondly. Annie nods, rubbing her eyes before turning towards Steve and Tony and wrapping her arms around both their middles.
Tony opens up his eyes again, turning towards Steve who is standing behind the couch, looking a bit distressed.
Why he avoids every single belltower, meaning every church in the neighborhood. He doesn’t want to be near them, fearing too much that he would relive the moments where he had Gwen so close within his grasp, but he only arrived too late.
“That depends, which one you identify with the most?” Natasha asks. Peter frowns, thinking back of what they all just explained to him.
“I don’t-“ he doesn’t know what to say, that’s what he’s trying to say. But even that escapes his capabilities.
It was dark when Yaël opened her eyes a second later and she was pretty sure there was someone laying on top of her.
“I don’t know, I think there’s somebody else? I mean, I’ve seen her looking, caught her staring sometimes. I guess she never really got over him and got tired of trying.” Harry then shrugs, being vague about something.
“Well, ‘alright’ is not exactly the word I’d use, Peter,” Mr. Stark says, and Peter feels something warm inside of him at the mention of his name. “But I get what you mean. I’m… glad, too.”
Peter can’t stay here… not tonight at least. It feels like staying here is going to drive him nuts. So without warning, he stands up again.
They arrived at a more open space, located at the front of the ship. The place was filled with people and Korg, Miek, Hulk and Heimdall were standingon a raise. What kind of weird board meeting was this going to be?
“Noooooooooooh!” he complains. Quickly, Steve crawls towards him, leaning on his back and travelling his finger over his skin.
“That’s more your thing, I think,” she told him. She leaned forward, pulled his mask back up and kissed him right on the mouth. Peter didn’t push her away, figuring he’s no longer got any reason to do so. “I have my mission,” she then continued.
“YOU CAN’T KNOCK?! WHAT THE FUCK, CLINT!” Steve shouts. Tony snorts when he hears Steve curse for what must be the first time ever. When he gets a glare from Steve, he quickly pretends like he’s coughing, instead.
Tony smiles at him, and when he’s out of the room he turns back to look at his boy. He’s pale, his hair thinned out. His skin is wet, sweaty. On Peter’s other side, May’s side, the chair is empty. She must be taking a walk probably.
Tony thought he would have been light on his feet so soon after the injection of the Bleeding Edge. As a matter of fact, he’s never felt better, stronger. It’s something he wouldn’t have thought possible, due to the small amount of Super Soldier Serum inside of him, but here we are. He noticed it when he accidentally broke the sink that morning. Again. Besides, his head is in constant over-drive, but unlike with the Serum, this time it’s something he can work a lot better with. It’s not his senses that are amplified, nor his reflexes. It’s his head literally being connected with his systems at all times. Just a step further from the Iron Man HUD or the headset he used to contact the suit.
“He remembers you well enough,” Yaël jokes. “But I’ll spare you from holding him. I swear I might get bald with how much he likes to pull hair.”
Partying is fun. Especially without the ability to drink any alcohol. It’s amazing to have all these drunk people around you, making out and rubbing against each other on stupid music he doesn’t even like. A few drunk girls even came hanging to his arm, begging for his attention. It was easy enough to chase them off with the ‘I’m taken’-excuse.
It’s Eric Selvig who guides her forward. Jane’s dress is not bombastic, instead rather simple. But Bruce explained earlier that Norse weddings often put more attention to the hair rather than the clothing. They didn’t even always wear white.
in bed rather than just jump out the moment an idea comes to his head and he storms back down to the workshop. As far as Peter knows, Steve is tired of waking up alone.
“When he was little I would stroke his hair while holding him on my lap each time he was sick,” May suddenly says. Tony gives her a short glance but doesn’t speak up. “It calmed him down long enough to let him fall asleep.”
“Listen, it’s normal that you feel panic right now,” Dr. Cho says after a long moment of silence. Peter finally looks back up at her, and only then feels that there are tears in his eyes. Tears of sadness or of joy, he doesn’t know, really. “You found out you have a living parent after thinking probably for years that they both are dead? That can only lead to a bit of shock.”
“She wanted to water the flowers, of all things. We don’t even have flowers here, right?” Tony turns to Wanda, who just shrugs.
Bruce lets out a relieved sigh, and the others seem just as equally relieved. Natasha holds out her hand towards Scott, who rolls his eyes and pulls out a bill and hands it to her.
“As far as I know, no, she didn’t.” Peter drinks some of the water before handing the glass back to May. “She’s back at home, though.”
“You’ve travelled back in time before to save your son. As a miracle, nothing happened back then even though it was a few months that you travelled back to.”
Using Flash’ phone, he quickly types in Ned’s number. Then he puts him on speaker phone as he reaches inside his suit to pull out another phone. It’s the one from Steve, and he doesn’t know if it’s going to do any good, calling him, but he has to try. Maybe Steve is nearby? Maybe Steve knows Tony’s number by heart, and he could pass it along. The problem is that Peter just can’t remember the number, and he doesn’t have access to FRIDAY right now.
“Of course he’ll be there!” Ned answers for him. Before Peter can even deny that, Liz smiles happily.
That’s the major question indeed. How is it possible that Tony is standing in front of Mary Parker’s home fifteen years in the past? How is it that a stupid watch he got from freaking Deadpool actually got him to this time? How is it even that Tony trusted the guy enough to take his strange devices?
They say their goodbyes. Once Francis is out of the building, Peter gets to the elevator, scans in his card and just waits until the elevator goes all the way up to the penthouse. Looking up at the ceiling, he watches the numbers go up and up, counting the number of floors they’ve passed. Since Peter has the priority-pass, the elevator doesn’t make any more stops.
Tony has never jumped in action so quickly. In just a matter of seconds, the Iron Man suit is surrounding him and he’s in the air.
“So do you have any idea how fast you were flying when Iron Man brought you back?” Ned asks, and Peter snorts. He’s been getting these types of questions for a while now, but Ned keeps on wanting to know more and more. It’s kind of hilarious, Peter thinks.
“I remember watching them on TV at the boarding school. It was kind of amazing,” Harry says, chuckling a bit. Peter shrugs.
she assures him. They all but throw themselves towards the door, hearing the collision behind them. It sounds like a lot of destruction. A quick look behind them, and Peter can see flames.
I am literally not okay. I've seen the trailer, and I hated it (not really). If Thanos dares to touch even a SINGLE hair on my boy Peter, causing for Tony to sit there on the ground sadly, I am personally crawling into my screen to rip Thanos' face off, thank you very much!
“I mean, you’re not ugly, you have a nice, if maybe a bit sassy, character, there are men out there who surely want to date you… Why wouldn’t you go for it?” Peter asked curiously.
“Yikes, that’s a bitch,” he returns. He holds out his hand towards Peter. “You trust me?” he asks. Peter nods, grabbing the hand and allowing Harry to fly him up into the air. With swift movements, Harry turns them around, creating speed. Once Venom’s almost right underneath them, Harry lets go of Peter, who has his feet pointed at Eddie’s face. With a strong force, Eddie grunts out in pain as he’s knocked back on the ground. Peter makes a rollover on he ground and jumps back on his feet.
Once again, loud cheers. Steve comes to stand next to Tony awkwardly, the two looking at the door Tony had been standing in front of earlier. There, after a few seconds delay, Peter starts running onto the stage as well. He still appears insecure, waving up at the people with large eyes and a mouth that has fallen open in his surprise. Yeah, the kid’s not used to this at all. Tony snorts, wrapping an arm around Steve’s middle while he watches Peter shake hands with LL before turning back to the crowd and giving them another wild wave. Tony’s not going to test his nerves, so he’s not pushing him forward like he did Steve. Instead, he throws his arm around Peter’s shoulder once again the moment Peter comes standing next to him.
“You’re right. We’ll head to bed, then,” Clint says. “Nat, you’re staying here?” He looks down at the woman on the couch, who gives him an unimpressed look.
“Uh, sure,” Steve had muttered, gesturing at Sam that he would need a few seconds. Sam had waved back, starting to look inside the room for further clues. “What’s wrong?”
“But, I should be working, no?” Peter tries to have cleared out. He needs to know he won’t be getting in trouble for this.
Peter nods. “I’m fine, Dad. Just gonna clean up my mess in the workshop for a bit.” He points towards the elevator that leads to the workshop. Tony nods with a smile.
“He, can’t. He’s got somewhere to go, his mother just called!” Peter makes up nervously. Tony lifts another eyebrow at that, and Ned just keeps on being speechless. A few more seconds of silence are passing between them before Tony sighs.
I am aware that I've practially finished the story with a cliffhanger. I'm not intending on writing the story of Peter vs. Octavius. I mostly added that last part because I felt it was stupid to bring up Octavius' experiment, but then never use him again in the story. Sure, I somehow felt the need to use him in that one chapter, but I never had planned an actual storyline with him.
Steve sighs on the other side of the line. Peter swallows in worry when he feels Tony’s heart beat slowing down gently.
It could be Peter’s imagination, but just as much as he likes Happy, he knows he’s not the man’s favorite person.
“Hey, Munchkin,” Tony says softly, squeezing her shoulder. “Steve’s just got that effect on people. It’s the eyes, I tell you.”
“Oh, right you are,” Otto says, suddenly his eyes meeting Tony’s and giving him a playful smirk. Tony had forgotten how happy Otto always used to be back in college, being pretty chipper for a guy who had nothing in his life left but a mother who didn’t even want him to pursue science. And while Otto starts explaining the chip on the back of his neck, the thing preventing for the AI to take control, Tony likes it even less.
“Peter’ll know we love him very much.” Mary shifts her hands onto Tony’s cheeks, making him look up to her. “The Peter you told me about, that’s the Peter I want him to become. And stopping us from dying… who knows, maybe the balance will be shifted and somebody else dies in our stead. We can’t play with that.”
“Oh, shit I didn’t mean-“ he starts, trying to struggle back, but Tony shakes his head. He takes a step backwards, a sudden numb look appearing in his expression. Peter swallows nervously, knowing he screwed up
It’s not bad at all; it’s larger than his room at home, which is one thing. There seems to be a door leading to a private bathroom, a television screen hanging up on the wall, and lights that can be dimmed to whichever intensity he wants. Tony really didn’t spare any expense on this!
What better way to do that than getting an internship in his company? He can make sure to be noticed – surely, if his background doesn’t help him, his inventions surely will do the trick, and that’s not to gloat or anything – and end up working closely with the man, right? He will then get to know him as Peter Parker rather than Spider-Man. Maybe then someone would take him seriously.
“Oh, c’mon man, I don’t need training wheels!” Peter complains. He jumps on the bed as he swings his arms around, feeling too active to just be lying down there. Ned still hesitates, though. “I’m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time, it’s not cool!”
“If you don’t want to go that’s okay, Tony. I can understand it’s not easy for you,” Bruce reminds him. Tony shakes his head.
“Sorry, you’re right. How do we get out of this mess?” he asks. Natasha shuffles closer to the window, looking at how far the guards are. They’re standing still, talking to each other in their native language.
“I couldn’t save her,” he mutters quietly. Then he looks up again, finding Hawkeye looking serious at him. He doesn’t say anything more, which is fine by Peter. He should better just go. Besides, he’s already at Oscorp, he might as well just come and pick up the things that woman called about. What was her name again?
It’s Bruce who notices him first. Just a short sideway glance, but immediately, the scientist speaks up.
Tony nods, understanding what Steve is trying to say. He’ll go along for now, without a fight. But if there’s no change after that meeting, he won’t be so nice anymore. Tony doesn’t want him in a cell for the rest of his life, so he’ll probably not be there to help against his escape.
“I’ve got some prototypes for you to look over. The design isn’t ready, but their function is so you can test it out and we can make it matching to your suit, what do you think?”
“What I’m trying to say, uh… I’m not… ready? I mean, I’m definitely old enough, and any normal person would say yes instantly, but I… I need more… stability? Assurance?”
“You kept him from killing the innocent. I don’t see that as wasted, Steve,” Tony assures the man. The reflection of the window shows Steve and Tony from afar. Peter can see they’re seated at the counter, facing each other. Steve has his head lowered down, while Tony leans forward to put his hand on Steve’s shoulder.
The journey to the principal’s office isn’t long; the detention-room is pretty close to it, only two rooms further. Peter waits at the door while the woman knocks on the door. After getting a confirming sound from the other side, she opens the door and points at Peter to get inside.
If he’d had his cellphone, he surely would have been texting Ned with all the updates. But cellphones aren’t allowed. Even Tony had to hand in his tech.
Bruce looks surprised at the apology. Tony knows he’s not the one to apologize too often. At least not with words.
Nobody talks to him. Tony’s glad they’re all respecting his privacy. The moment the elevator comes down, Tony hurries to the entrance of the building.
“You ever planning on doing something like this?” Steve asks. Bucky’s eyes open wide in his surprise, but then he clears his throat. Natasha, too, seems to avert her eyes.
!” The man was wearing blue, red and gold garments, had blue lines under his eyes and one running over his chin.
The next person that comes into the big hall they’ve all assembled in to is Jane. The woman, dressed completely different from every other Asgardian walking around, she resembles more like the guests, who are obviously curious as to what exactly the dress-code will become.
“Whoa, at least now we know how we ended up the way we did,” Yaël jokes awkwardly, and Peter lets out a small, uncomfortable chuckle.
is removed from his memory; not that it’s such a horrible thought, but she’s his friend, and they’ve never even thought about being more than that.
That’s weird… the last thing he remembers was the fight in Midtown, and Peter’s extremely sure it was still light back then. Carefully, he tries sitting up a bit, getting on his knees while wiping his arms clean. That’s when he sees he’s still wearing the black suit.
Peter’s aunt is beyond excited. She’s already wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt, a backpack stuck to her back and a cap on her head. The smile on her face is endless, showing the lines on her face but making her all the more beautiful. Peter likes it when Aunt May is happy. She’s had it rough after losing Uncle Ben, but now she seems to have finally found peace with his passing.
Peter hits the jackpot almost immediately when he sees a couple of people robbing a little store. One of the masked goons is holding up a gun, waiting for the cashier to hand out all of his money. The old man, a true hero in Peter’s eyes, bluntly refuses, shaking his head. Peter figures it’s best to deal with this quickly in order to avoid an old man’s death.
Back then, Tony had thought she meant Banner. Now, though, Tony isn’t so sure anymore that’s what she was on about.
“Hmm, my cousin kissed my man? That’s something to bring up during the next family dinner,” Tony mutters out. “He didn’t kiss her back, though, right?”
And she’s willing to go along with many jokes; making Clint believe he’s been in a coma for three years after a good night’s sleep, telling Tony that they saw Peter make out with Deadpool. The usual small pranks like hand buzzers and creative stuff with tomato sauce can also easily make her day.
Peter startles once more, turning towards Steve and nodding with his mouth still full of water. Then he swallows once more and takes a deep breath.
“THAT WAS MY MOTHER!” Tony shouts through his tears, pushing Steve away from him, feeling close to just punch him in the face.
“Would you be alright with me examining the blood? I’m just kind of interested in the origins of your powers,” Dr. Cho asks, the question not really unexpected. But Peter trusts her, knowing that she will not use it to do anything wrong with it. If the Avengers rely on her, why can’t he, right? Especially if he plans to join them one day.
The, suddenly one day, Tony’s aunt passed away and Peter, Tony and Steve had to go to the funeral. Apparently she had been a good friend (or girlfriend? She’s not sure what she heard) of Steve too. Afterwards, Yaël heard that Steve and Tony hadn’t even talked during the funeral. Heck, they hadn’t even been sitting near to each other. So, yes, Yaël felt things were going from bad to even worse.
“Yeah, you’re taking care of me, aren’t you?” Peter says with a light smile before picking up the cup. Ever since working at SI, he’s learned to appreciate the taste of coffee more and more, mostly due to Dum-E always making him cups whenever Peter even shows a
He’s standing there, tall as ever. A loose shirt, skin tanned from the sun. Are those freckles on his cheeks? Tony would love to check it out, but it would be weird to do that. So he stays back.
There were freaking knives or something rammed through Wade’s skull from the roof of the car. Somethingwas standing on the roof…carving into Wade’s brains.
“Anything triggered it, or…?” Harry asks vaguely. Peter panics, trying to think back about what they were talking about…
“I’ve moved on,” Peter says, all of the sudden. Gwen turns her head towards him, looking at him while she waits for him to continue. “I almost didn’t, but… I figured you wouldn’t want me to stay stuck in the past, so I’ve moved on eventually.”
Sam is more or less the same, but he’s only focused on one thing, exactly; his wings. When he has his turn as the ‘babysitter’, he starts asking all sorts of questions of his wings; what exactly did Tony add last time, what is he planning on adding now? What are his ideas for the future? How about laser-wings instead of metal ones? Each time Sam’s shift is over, Tony is about ready to throw the wings out of the building.
Peter grinned and lowered his head, feeling something inside of him that he hasn’t felt since Uncle Ben’s death.
“We can go and warn Xandar and the Collector if it’s not too late,” Quill offers. Everybody nods, though nobody’s sure what the chances are that Thanos won’t have already been there. “Maybe we can try and use the orb like last time?”
“No clue. When I asked Tony about it, he said it didn’t matter since everything turned out alright anyway. He was being very shady about it.”
It takes a few minutes for him to separate from the family. With the kids in seventh heaven for finally meeting their hero, Peter lingers for a little bit more before he decides to head off. Just one turn in the opposite direction, and suddenly the Cat drops down in front of him. She gives him a wide smile, walks up to him and holds up her hands towards his face.
And Steve is happy. Because he’s got Tony, he’s got a slowly-healthier Peter around here, and he’s got Bucky wandering around. That, in the combination of his crazy family surrounding him here?
“Now here we are, at your room! Still the same one as back then, but I made some changes so you’d feel at home.” The first thing Yaël saw when she opened the door, was Wade, laying naked on a brand-new-looking sofa, only covering his parts with a box of chocolates. Steve looked completely shocked.
“No, Peter! He’s hurt and they’ve performed surgery on him for the past hour. I’m sure he’s having the time of his life!” Clint throws at him. When Natasha gives him a stern look, he shuts his mouth and lets out a long breath.
“Peter?!” she asks when she sees him. Her eyes open wide upon noticing his state of undress. She doesn’t cover herself up at all, seeming uncaring about her nudity. Peter, ever the gentleman, still shifts his gaze away to the side.
Peter has lost him about fifteen minutes ago, probably to some random girl he hopes will be his conquest of the evening. Johnny’s need to sleep with girls is so big, Peter for a moment wonders if he doesn’t just have this slightest addiction-problem to sex.
“Good!” the guy grinned. Yaël somehow doubted if partying with Wade would be the most responsible thing to do, but whatever. Having some fun wasn’t a crime, right?
“Come on! I’m bored out of my mind in bed!” Tony complains, watching his bots hurry after him as they try to keep Tony inside. Though, by the time they’ve reached him, Steve has already closed the door between them.
I'm extremely hyped right now, because I've just finished chapter 29, and am at 305 pages, which is crazy considering how long it took for me to write my previous stories (2 years or so?). Thank you all for reading and commenting. You always manage to make me smile, and I'm grateful for that!
saw this coming,” Sam mutters. “I’m just more surprised about the fact that this is only your first date; we’d expected you two to be together for far longer than that.”
Damage control, that’s what Tony needs to do now. He needs to talk to the people, assure them that it wasn’t a trap; that he hadn’t counted on Spider-Man being there when he alerted the authorities. But also to assure them that he’s underage, that he didn’t know any better.
“I look perfect and you know it,” Tony responds. “Where are you at? That doesn’t look like New Asgard behind you?” Tony nods towards the screen. Natasha turns her head to look at what’s behind her. When Sam Wilson suddenly walks by, she gives the guy a light smile.
“Whoa, sounds cool. Well, if they can come, you’re invited as well, Parker,” Flash says, slapping him once on the shoulder before running off again. Peter just frowns, figuring that, even when trying to apologize, Flash is still kind of a jerk. Well, not everybody can be a hero, he figures. He checks his phone again, and then moves to his last class of the day.
The Sousas entrance is mostly describable because of the two ten-year-old children running inside with their arms raised in the air as they search for their uncle Tony and cousin Peter. Remembering them from the funeral, Peter knows immediately that the twins might cause even more destruction than Tony does with the powers he’s still unused with.
When the quinjet drops them off at the tower, Tony calls for Happy to bring them back home. Before they leave, Peter pulls Tony into a strong hug, grateful for the day he’s had.
“Alright,” Harry returns. With his hands in his pockets, he walks beside Peter. They go on for a bit further until they get in the shopping district. It’s closed, of course, with it being evening. It’s dark out, the sun already low below the ground. It’s probably almost morning in New Asgard!
“We were good friends, spent almost all of our time together, working on stuff.” Then Mr. Stark stands up, walking towards the bar and pouring himself a small glass of what must be scotch. Peter almost wants to comment how he shouldn’t combine that with his medication, but he figures that’s not his place. “And then she met your father. That must have been the happiest I’ve ever seen her.”
After she was sure she didn’t hear anything anymore, she started fiddling with the lock again. Of course it took a few times, since her air steering still wasn’t completely on point as the power still seemed to be doing whatever the fuck, whenever the fuck.
Steve gets out of bed as well. He walks towards Tony, takes his arms into his hands, and gently shakes him.
FRIDAY still states the obvious, and Tony shakes his head and throws his arms up. She got him, there.
“The spiders… I don’t know anything about them. What did they use to alter them? What did their formula exist out of?”
“What exactly are we doing here?” Peter asks. The girl’s green eyes suddenly turn towards him, her lips curling upwards.
“Go,” she tells him, tears in her eyes. Peter nods, slowly letting go of her hands as he walks back into the light.
This right here, this is exactly what he’s good at. Takes another good look at the place with the help of the screens on his glasses, and then he goes to his toolbox and starts tinkering around.
“Oh, I should have figured that would happen. They have a bet and neither Tony nor Steve want to tell them the answer,” Natasha says with a shrug. She reaches behind her head to readjust her bun. “Whatever you do, don’t indulge them or they’ll be asking for more.”
The last thing Yaël saw before waking up was that his eyes grew big out of surprise, even shock maybe.
After that, they’re gone. And now all Natasha needs to do is wait. She clears her throat, getting up from her seat and taking her cup of coffee in her hands.
Around Midnight, he’s back into bed, having done nothing else more. And as he dreams, his head is filled with lots of Star Wars references, for some reason.
But Peter can’t form words. All he does is apologize, bursting out in tears, and allowing May to pull him into her arms. After that, Peter leaves to take a shower, and May and Tony are left in the room together. Tony explains to her that he’s already talked to him, that Peter had his scolding.
“No, I’m not lying. He’s just too worried about me to really know what I can do yet,” he assures him. Then, with his pincer, he picks up the tracker, finding that it comes loose easily. With a smirk, he puts it on the lamp. After spending months building this suit, he knows pretty much how it works, but he can’t recall agreeing with Tony to put a tracker inside of it. He’s sure it wasn’t Tony’s intention to be stalking him, but more in case of emergencies.
“That’s alright, pal!” he says. After the two give each other a slap on the shoulder, they pull back and get themselves inside. “You can take whatever you want from the tables.”
Everybody stays quiet after that. Ross keeps his eyes on Tony, and Tony stares right back. He’s not going to back down. Impossible.
“That’s a problem, sir,” someone in front of her said. It wasn’t the king talking, it was the counselor…Shit!
When Peter looks back up, he finds Francis inspecting the two of them with a strange look, eyes glancing from Dum-E to Peter time after time.
“Quit using her old name, we don’t use names other than Norwegian or Sil ones,” the king grunted. “Now, Aslaug, please do what I called you for.” The blonde woman pulled out a blade, grabbed Raido’s hair and pulled it back. Yaël’s friend grunted as Nilla put her blade against his throat.
“I’d say I’ll ask him, but I’m sure he won’t tell me,” Peter complains. Then he clears his throat, checking is his wallet is still in his back pocket, and gently shakes his shoulders loose. “Anyway, I’m heading out. You mind keeping an eye on those two upstairs? Make sure they don’t break up again? We all remember how their last split went.”
Wanda talks about what she’s been doing in Wakanda; the help she’s been giving Barnes in his psychological recovery the moment he’s been awakened. The mood quickly changes when Wade starts asking about the smooching between her and Vision only an hour ago. Wanda, of course, turns red in the face and insists that it’s nothing.
"Alright, who-ever put the teams together really didn't think this through," Steve mutters, looking at the tablet and staring at the names. "I mean, they're right; they have three master-assassins."
“I don’t have enough money, as Fury keeps reducing the money I get and gardening and playing cello doesn’t bring up much. Not to sound greedy, of course, I’m grateful for what I get, but…”
“Uh, alright,” Peter says, and in obvious hesitation, Peter reaches for the door and opens it up. When he’s outside, he waits for a little moment longer before closing it again and starting to walk back into the apartment complex.
Tony says on the other line. Peter just groans the moment the call has ended. Then he pulls the mask off and turns back to Bruce. It’s probably better for him to see an actual face.
Peter doesn’t think. He jumps out of his chair in a smooth motion. Natasha only startles a little bit when there’s suddenly someone next to her. Once she sees who it is, she smiles and moves aside.
When Tony Stark announced to the world that he was in fact Iron Man, it was like the Batman came to life for Peter. Much to his Aunt’s and Uncle’s annoyance, Peter began to adore the man. He never knew what part Tony Stark had meant into Peter’s past, nor did he know his mother used to be friends with him. To him, Tony Stark was just a figure on the TV, a real-life superhero. And so, Peter managed to convince May and Ben to get him the merch, and he managed to get a spot at the Expo (granted, that didn’t turn out well, but it was still amazing for Peter; Being rescued by Iron Man? Hell yeah!).
“I’ve tried,” Tony says. “He doesn’t pick up. Whenever I came to the apartment, he wasn’t there. I’ve only heard through May that he’s doing fine right now since he at least still calls her every day.”
Peter feels a bit sorry for Mr. Stark, though. It seems like the guy actually saw his mother as a good friend, and she just leaves him like that. Peter would feel betrayed, as well. Though, still, it’s not like Peter had that many friends, and one of them
“He stopped; he remembered something. At least enough to pull me back out of the water after I fell. And that’s all the proof that I need to know that he’s still there, Tony. Somewhere, in this world, Bucky is wandering around, no longer the killing machine who only wants to finish his mission. He didn’t finish it, because he let me live.”
Peter feels sick once Sunday arrives. It’s almost like he’s ready to just throw up on the spot, and nothing really gets done. Aunt May even comes up to his room to take his temperature, but finds that nothing’s really wrong with him. It’s all just in his head because today is
“No, he isn’t!” Tony hisses, now standing in front of him and holding on to his shoulders. Behind him, Steve tries to make him back off, but Tony doesn’t listen. “Whatever happened to Harry, he’s no longer inside of
“If there are any troubles, you can just call the number on top of the page and I’ll see if I can help,” he says. Peter only nods, not really thinking much of it but instead going back out of the building as fast as he can.
“You do realize you’re standing in front of the window wearing no clothes at all?” Steve asks without moving from his spot. Tony puts his hands on his hips and takes on a heroic pose.
“Drop the act. I don’t care what you wear, but don’t pretend to be someone you’re not. I’m not dumb. If this is your vision on the manly brain, it’s very stereotypical,” he answered a bit dryly while leading her into a park. Yaël had to stop herself from letting her mouth drop open like a dumb twat.
“By the way, chess isn’t that hard. You’re a smart girl, you’ll learn it quickly enough,” Charles added. “Besides, did you answer Mr. Rogers’ text?” Charles asked her while moving a pawn. Yaël shook her head.
“This is for killing my uncle,” Peter hisses towards him, ready to throw the final blow. That’s when he realizes he’s been hearing voices all around him.
It’s about ten minutes later that she speaks up again. They’re almost nearing Oscorp and Tony has to admit that, though he hates it very much, the tower does end up looking better than it does now.
Though, somehow, the universe managed to make their beloved Black Widow, along with Barnes, kind-of adopt an orphaned baby. Yeah, life’s just weird.
Tony left the compound about an hour ago after Cap practically threw him out. He can understand that, though, since he’s been there all week except for when he’s needed for important meetings. Somehow, his new assistant has found a loophole through Steve to actually make him
know. We can’t predict the future. We already broke up once, it’s still a possibility.” It’s a complete mess. Tony’s thoughts are going in overdrive. He wouldn’t be surprised if there’s smoke coming out of his ears.
Peter tries not to react too much at the idea of Pepper calling him ‘honey’. He’s already getting close to calling her Aunt as well. Just like with Nat.
, she thinks she sees it. It’s the way they move, or the way they try to regain posture after another blow. And she’s staring for longer than she wants.
“Tea?” he asks. Bruce nods, but Peter shakes his head. In just a blink of the eye, Bruce has a steamy mug in his hands. “What do you drink?”
Spider-Man finds the Black Cat again a week after they first met. She’s once again on a rooftop, keeping watch over the city while standing dangerously close to the edge. Though she doesn’t move, Peter knows she’s aware of his presence.
It’s temporal. At least that’s what Strange could give him. How long it’ll take, he couldn’t say. It could be a day, it could be a week. At least not more than that, so that’s something he’s got going for himself.
Helen takes another deep breath while turning to Bruce. It’s a silent cry for help it seems, like she doesn’t want to be the one to tell them whatever news she has for them. Lucky for her, Bruce seems to take it over, after all.
I had a lot of fun writing this one. It was an idea that had been in my mind a few times, but I never knew how to start with it. Then this morning, while I was watching South Park, I suddenly got hit with a large wave of inspiration.
“No way, I can help,” Peter counters, already walking back to some more people that need his help. In the back. A man on the ground starts screaming as his leg seems to be pulled along while other people try to keep him back. He probably has some form of metal pin put into his leg after a fracture, while normally these things aren’t supposed to be attracted by magnets. That must mean this thing is strong as fuck. The man gets pulled into safety when Steve picks him up and carries him away through the pull of the magnetism.
“I didn’t know,” Toomes stammers out. Steve decides to be nice and loosens the grip on the wrist slightly.
Art has been made for the story, and more WILL still be made. If you're interested, don't be afraid to check out my tumblr
Peter frowns, having expected a whole other greeting. Still, he decides not to overthink it and prepares himself to do as he asks. A flip isn’t really that much work. So he makes the jump, lands back on his two feet, and everybody shouts and claps!
“Awesome,” Tony mumbles. When the door opens he turns around to face Steve, who is holding up Tony’s crutches.
“Well, around this time, the sun reaches a position which illuminates the garden just perfectly. Sometimes artists and photographers come all the way here to put it into an image, but nothing is better than seeing it in person, no?”
“I, eh, this,” Yaël pointed at her head “is kind of empty. I simply don’t remember, Steve.” His confused look turned into a frown.
The boy in question is on his way to his last class of the day. It’s a beautiful, sunny day, meaning that he’s taking his time travelling to his destination as he lets the rays of the sun travel down on his skin and heat him up. Johnny had been walking next to him up to five minutes ago but had to take an earlier turn to get to his class.
Peter left after the movie, and Yaël didn’t really feel like being a third wheel to Wanda and Vision, so she stood up too. Before she closed the door behind her, Wanda threw her a concerned look, but Yaël ignored it. She didn’t feel like going back to her bedroom, so instead, she went to the roof. She needed some air. It saddened her, but she knew that if she’d stay inside that building for much longer, she’d set it on fire or hurt someone with her bitter words.
“I’m wonderful,” Otto responds, looking fondly at his wife before turning towards Steve and Peter and holding out his hand to them respectively as well.
As Peter gets back to his desk, he quickly puts in the wireless ear-pieces he got from Mr. Stark, which would allow him to take on calls while keeping his hands free. Right now, he keeps it in to be in a direct line with FRIDAY as he sits back at his desk. The others are currently at the cafeteria, scrambling together some dinner. Peter would join them, but he’s forgotten to bring money along.
Peter stands still, feeling his face get cold as he watches the boy pass by. Harry – Peter’s almost sure it’s him – hasn’t seen him yet. He’s just walking forward, looking disinterested as he follows the crowd into another room.
Shit… he really misses his own Steve. He shouldn’t have started an argument with him yesterday. Shouldn’t have shouted at him. Shouldn’t have been an ass. Tony sobs unknowingly, his entire body aching at the idea that
Peter frowns for a moment, only lightly recalling that, indeed, his mother used to work for Oscorp after leaving Stark Industries. She hadn’t been working there for very long, but apparently long enough to earn herself a safe.
But Yaël wasn’t naïve, she knew that if Peter figured out who his real das was, it still didn’t mean the man would take care of him or even want to know him. This man wouldn’t make Peter’s life all rainbows and cupcakes, per se. But when Yaël looked at his young face with eyes that show that the boy has already been through a lot, she could only be optimistic for him.
So of course the little Spider-man tune comes out of his inside pocket the moment he slams his foot in another guy’s face. He thinks he hears said man’s nose crack, but he’s not really sure. The phone continues its happy tune while Peter drops down on the ground, a surprised grunt escaping his lips. Instinctively he reaches for the phone, remembering once more he changed the outer pocket with an inside one because he kept on losing his phone and Aunt May started to swing a wooden spoon his way – not that she would actually hit him or anything, but it’s really her only way of trying to be strict with him.
Steve rolls his eyes at that. “You’re hilarious,” he mutters, then grabbing Tony’s hand. “Come on, if we hurry, we’ll be back quickly and then we can watch the movie.”
“If you’re here to give me another speech: just don’t. You don’t want to bore the kid, after all!” He says. Next to Peter, Steve rolls his eyes but still marches towards Mr. Stark in long strides. Peter just hurries after him, already unbuttoning his shirt and reaching for Mr. Stark’s newest invention.
hidden from view from now on. Quickly he runs down the street, headed to the house that hosted the party. The fact that he can’t hear the music from the outside means that they must have put down the volume a bit. Peter knocks the door, not expecting an answer.
When he sees Steve turn back to him with eyes open wide, his breath seems to catch. Lifting up his hand towards his head, Steve hesitantly scratches his hair.
“I guess I should have known why you think you’re better than me. You’re a Stark, after all.” Eddie bites out that last part like it’s poison in his mouth. The idea of Peter being the son of Tony Stark obviously disgusts him.
Peter’s also smiling. That’s not something Steve would have expected to see so soon after the week they’ve just got. He realizes that Tony’s just as speechless as he is.
The moment he’s surrounded by his suit, Tony flies. He knows where to go even before FRIDAY can say it. But that’s the thing, right? Because FRIDAY
When Yaël woke up again later in the day, Steve was gone. He probably went back to Stark, as he immediately came to her after his mission without passing by at Tony’s.
“Natasha?” Peter asks in confusion. The penthouse is obviously empty beside for them two, which is weird on its own since Natasha wouldn’t just come here to chill; she’s got her own apartment two floors down for that. “What’re- what- uh- what are you doing here?”
Who-ever Natasha is talking to is obviously not bringing good news. Her face looks grim, and even as she hangs up the phone she has a frown on her face.
Peter frowns for a short second before groaning out in disgust, shielding his eyes the moment Tony jumps up as well, holding a pillow in front of his… junk…
And Tony talks. About the future of the company, the plans they have and the things that have happened in the past where they’ve decide to learn from. Peter’s about sure his heart is going to burst from his chest, but Steve’s there with him. So is May. The two are smiling at him, May holding him into his arms when it seems like the nerves are getting the better of him.
“Mr. Stark, I’ve brought you a coffee,” his assistant suddenly says. Stark turns around in surprise, and sees that the woman indeed is holding a cup for him. Still, though, her charming smile and glowing golden hair doesn’t compare to the beauty of Pepper, and for a moment, Tony just wishes she were still his assistant. Then at least she’d have to still be around him. Being the CEO of Stark Industries is a job she can easily do on her own; it’s not like he’s been much help to her about that, anyway.
“I think everybody seems to forget I have three PhDs,” Tony mutters out. Rhodey laughs and slaps him on the shoulder before dropping down on the couch.
Wait how did she even know he could do that? She didn’t remember him talking in her head the few times she met him after she had ‘woken up’ from ‘the accident’. Vague terms Fury used to explain her why she didn’t remember a thing. But yet, Yaël couldn’t shake some sort of déjà vu-feeling when she heard the voice inside her head.
“He, uh… he moved back to the tower. Transported all of his stuff from the workshop as well. He’s not really her biggest fan.”
“Peter, honey, wake up,” Yaël heard someone sob. The question echoed in the dark. Suddenly, Yaël started seeing a few shims, that colored clearer and clearer the longer she looked at it, like it was some sort of Polaroid-picture.
” FRIDAY adds. Peter sits up in surprise, dropping down the banana before managing to finish it. Then he looks up at the ceiling, shaking his head in panic.
“I’m sorry but no, I don’t,” Steve returns. Tony throws his hands in the air. “Tony, seriously. One moment you sleep with me and the other you dump my ass. That’s not okay!”
“Auw,” Peter mutters as his cheek hits his plate. There’s a fry poking his eye, and the sauce is already in his nose.
Tony talks to a few people, though not recognizing all of them if he’s really honest. Some of them he’s aware they were in school together, but either Tony was too young to remember, or he was too drunk. There’s no in-between, really. He introduces Steve and Peter, lets them shake people’s hands. When he’s greeted by a few members of Oscorp’s board, he’s reminded of who funded this whole project.
Just to prove it, Tony brings up the suit, letting it surround him just as easily as lifting up his foot. Steve lets out a gasp and takes a step back.
“As if! He’s dating the biggest potty-mouth of them all!” Happy, too, laughs. Pepper just gives Tony another glare, but Tony ignores it by simply looking outside.
He must be in the bedroom Tony put together for him. He had said that Peter needed to redecorate it a bit.
“You’re friends with him? How is he? Everybody keeps on telling me he’s insufferable?” Steve suddenly looked a bit worried.
“You need any help with the search?” Tony asks before stuffing his mouth with his food. He keeps his eyes on May while he chews.
“Don’t say it’s that ex-boyfriend of yours?” Peter asks, remembering the confrontation they’ve had in that alley where that guy didn’t want to leave her alone. MJ laughs at that.
But he can’t just go and hand out money everywhere as Spider-Man. He doesn’t want that kind of press on his name.
Without much grace Tony lands in front of the compound. He carries the journals all the way into Bruce’s lab, only to find that he’s not in there. He doesn’t bother to ask FRIDAY for where he’s hiding, instead heading towards the medical bay in the hopes to see Peter shortly before he gets to start the research.
There’s always this surge of power going through him when the suit is on completely. It’s like a thrill, a wave of strength that passes through him and gives him the biggest self-confidence he could have. Letting out a laughing huff, Peter balls his fists and shakes his shoulders loose.
“Uh, yeah, uhm… sorry about earlier… I’m… really easily triggered lately. I shouldn’t have snapped at you.”
cold. I think I should just go and get changed,” he says, pointing back towards the forest where his backpack with very dry clothes is waiting for him – hopefully. It wouldn’t be the first time it got stolen, though this time he put it up high enough away, right?
kind to him, knowing who he is despite the beard and the hair. Even some of the prisoners seem to adore him, talking about how he’s saved one of their family members or other things like that. They treat him right here, which can’t be said to the other prisoners.
Peter nods, ignoring the fact that she called him ‘Stark’ instead of Parker. Once they’re outside, he sees May noticing him. He doesn’t stop her when she hurries towards him to listen in as well.
“Nobody knows,” Yaël returns. “Heimdall thinks it has something to do with the heart of the dying star restoring itself. The whole deal about this hammer is still pretty much unknown to us.”
It worked, it somehow actually worked! Yaël thought as she heard the doors open. Yaël followed the sound of the guard’s footsteps and pulled Lopt behind her. Her heart raced so faced that she started feeling nauseous.
“If we somehow save Asgard, I assure you I’ll bring you back to earth personally. Now, I want you to stay in the ship as soon as we get there.” Yaël raised her eyebrow as an answer. Had she left her friends, fled from their stupid war, just to get into another one as soon as Loki steps back into her life?
“Then why come out now?” Peter then suddenly asks. The girl snorts and shakes her head, finally passing Peter by and taking place on the spot he was just seated on.
"Welcome back, I trust you kicked some ass out there?" Tony asks, suddenly appearing from the hall with his hair sticking out wildly and grease-stains over his shirt. When he gets to Steve and Peter, he kisses them both on the cheek before starting up the coffee machine. Steve reaches out immediately to pull the plug and stop him.
“Uh, she’s just- the Goblin- couldn’t… catch her,” the kid then stammers out, not really making any sense at all. But, the mention of the Goblin is enough for Tony to figure it out on his own. He did hear that one of the victims from the whole Goblin-affair half a year ago had been a teenage girl. Another person he had lost… poor kid.
“Goddammit,” Yaël mumbled as soon as she realized that. Charles inspected the damage those two had created, still acting casually, like he went through this daily. Well, Yaël could imagine the man actually did go through this shit daily.
Looking down at the papers he got when he signed up a few days back, he tries to put any meaning in the words.
Maybe he should get home so late that she’s already sleeping, and then he should probably get up before her… but that’s impossible; Pepper is an early riser; maybe he should sleep in, instead? That will give him, what? A few more hours when she’s at work?
“Steve? What’s going on?” somebody asks behind. Steve quickly turns around to see Bucky standing there. It’s only been a few days since they’ve pulled him out of cryo again after T’Challa’s people found a way to work with Wanda and Tony’s BARF-glasses. It had been an investment, but T’Challa had expressed that he did not wish to be repaid for that.
in any way – though that’s probably because of his continuous avoiding behavior to things that trigger him.
“Yeah, and the Avengers take care of me, don’t they?” Peter asks in an attempt to make it better. Tony blinks back at him, still seeming unsure about it.
Karen answers in that soothing voice of hers. Peter smiles. Then he gives his father one last wave before dropping himself over the balcony until he gets into a free-fall.
It’s like a lot of things have happened today. His first worry – though also feeling of relief – came when Peter reached out for him with the message that he needed Tony to look something over. After more than two weeks of silence, it came to a large surprise for him that Peter would just… ask for his help.
He shouldn’t have been too surprised that Tony would have invited Aunt May to come to Disneyland as well. The guy can arrange everything.
She forgot about Wade’s behavior in the restaurant and nodded with a big smile. Then she remembered she had to work in Mr. and Ms. Thompson’s garden and started shaking her head. She still had some time before she should go to bed, it was only 8 pm, but she needed to eat and shower and hunting a squirrel girl together with Wade could probably cause some physical damage.
“I’ll say that I’ll sign the moment I’m 18,” Peter repeats what his Dad made him memorize in the past few days. Happy, Tony nods and slaps his shoulder gently. When Bruce shows up behind them, the scientist leans over them to reach for the bread.
When spaceship finally slowed down, Yaël heard one of the passengers mutter something about the Champion fighting against a dog. Before she even had the chance to think about getting up, Loki’s hand already hoovered in front of her face. He pulled her up like she was just a light feather, whilst she knew she wasn’t the skinniest and she was kind of tall. Not as tall as Loki, though. They both immediately hurried themselves towards the window.
I said in the chapter that it's better the sooner encephalopathy starts after jaundice. That's a true fact. As it is, if it's less than 7 days, there's a 30% survival rate. Once it's longer than 7 days, that rate goes down to 10%. Obviously, both are still very low. With that, this is what I meant with the doctor being relieved that it started so soon.
“I can handle him,” she then says, grinning back up to Hilde. Eventually she, too, stands up. That’s Tony’s cue to round things up at last. He tries to get back on his feet before he realizes that Steve has fallen asleep against his chest.
“Hell no! I should have known things were going bad since college. All those nightly-missions? The constant fights with your Dad? Ignoring me and all your friends? The drinking?!”
Tony nods, leaning forward until his head is resting against Steve’s chest. At least he has that to work with, right? He lets out a small sigh before pulling away, wrapping an arm around Steve’s waist.
Yaël’s mouth fell open. “What?! I can’t even draw, old man! And cello is the only instrument I can play, only because back in the days you practically pushed it into my hands.” Yaël had remembered that quickly enough as she had seen the cello she lend back then, standing all glorious in one of the hallways. Because, a whole while back when Scott and Charles tried training her, Charles wanted her to be able to lose her frustrations from the messy trainings in some way, he kind of forced her to play on it. This also kept her busy, as she needed to research a lot about the instrument since she was learning it all on her own.
to sign the accords. And if you do that, they’ll know who you are. I chose the lesser of two evils.”
In comes Mr. Stark’s new assistant – Peter has failed to get her name before. She’s a tall, blonde woman, dressed in a tight black skirt and a loose white top. When Peter takes a look at her heels, he wonders if that could even be comfortable to stand in.
“Oh, you’re drained!” the memory-Yaël jumped up as soon as she noticed that. “Aren’t you cold?” she said as she walked towards him.
“You want him to sign, don’t you?” he asks. All the people in the room give him a knowing look. Of course, they want him to sign.
“If the Goblin had been here, the school wouldn’t have been standing. A-and as to why he wants me, that’s none of your freaking business,” Peter tells her. Michelle shakes her head, her messy red curls swinging along with the movement.
“Yeah, sure, I’ll keep that in mind.” Peter turns towards Harry. “Have the others made any progress on finding Venom so far?”
“Huh, Spanish?” Peter asks when he realize he can’t understand a single thing written down. MJ scoffs.
“You don’t know that. Maybe he just happened to see you.” Charles kept looking chill, hanging on the bench.
Or for Spider-Man. Peter is having quite a bit of fun at the moment, and he’s already forgetting his own promise of staying away from the alcohol; what would it matter if he would let go a little bit, tonight?
“Uh, I’m, uh…” he starts, but even as he fidgets his fingers together, nothing comes out. Peter gives him an unimpressed look, crossing his arms. He’s not angry, but he would still like to pass along the message that they’re making a lot of noise.
“Uhm,” Tony starts, not exactly sure what she’s talking about. He’s never seen this girl before in his life.
“Oh Peter, Peter, Peter,” he sings. “You keep on trying and trying, but you just can’t accept the fact that
” Steve admits. Tony pats him gently on the shoulder, and Steve turns his face again until it’s pressed against the pillow.
Hissing as she quickly put the coat on again, since she was still trying to keep FRIDAY unwarned, she walked out of the basement. She peeked around again, hoping that Rhodey and Vision were still busy doing whatever those two did. She walked to her room and put all the stuff, including the card and coat, back into the box and shoved it back under her closet.
Also, a few people seemed excited about a Johnny-Peter friendship. And while that wasn't really my intention (mostly because I wasn't really aware of their friendship in the comics), I've decided to change the parts with Johnny I had written out. While at first he was around 10 years older than Peter, now he's eighteen years old, and only got his powers because he sneaked into the space craft when Sue, Reed & Ben were on their mission (because, honestly, who would take a 16-year-old up to space??). The original story-line (being the one where they'll surprise everyone by revealing he's in a serious relationship with Sharon -- see, because Chris Evans ;-) ;-) ) is with this not relevant anymore ^^ The future chapters have been changed, and timestamps will give us friendship goals!
“You always seem to think you need more training, whilst I find you being unpolished one of your strongest points.”
The rest of the dinner isn’t awkward at all. They get to know Felicia a lot better, and when it’s time for her to go home Peter walks her out. May and Rhodey also offer to give her a lift, which she accepts gratefully.
Wow, freaky… Suddenly, Yaël was standing in some kind of training hall, like a gymnasium. She looked around and saw all kinds of practice-weapons hanging on a wall. But she also saw basketball-rings, hanging on two opposite sides of the room. The floor was made of this typical rubber flooring. As Yaël was looking at the floor, she noticed she was suddenly wearing tight sports-clothing. It looked expensive.
“I could just return another time,” Peter suggests then, and immediately Tony turns around to face him again. Only one look at Peter makes Tony realize that the boy seems a bit off, himself. There’s this strange expression in his eyes that make it clear that something is bothering him. The bags under his eyes indicate that he hasn’t had a good night’s rest in a while, and then there’s the fact that he looks like he’s actually shaking.
It irks Peter that the guy is talking about his friend like that, but he figures it’s best not to let it get to him. As if Flash could even have a chance with Wanda. There’s still that thing going on between her and Vision that nobody dares to mention but everybody knows is there.
“You know, there’s nothing wrong with some time apart once or twice. Healthy couples argue a lot, after all,” Nakia says, giving T’Challa a loving look that makes even Tony want to look away. He clears his throat, eyes stuck on the floor.
“On the other hand, he won’t have to worry about the serum forever. According to my tests, it’s only temporary. Eventually it will all fade away because of how small the amount is.”
Tony chuckles. “Well, we’re not going anywhere,” he assures him. He leans his head to the side until it’s resting on Steve’s shoulder, and then a loud sigh escapes his lips.
They try conversation. It only ends up with Mr. Toomes realizing who he is, and him getting a speech about staying out of his way. What the man doesn’t realize is Peter dropping his personal cellphone on the floor right before leaving the car.
So Peter swings on and on, until very late in the night that it’s actually early again. And after that, he sleeps for two hours before getting ready for school.
Well, no, it was only Raido’s head. His neck stopped at a point where someone sloppily chopped it off off, with pieces of dead flesh still hanging here and there. Yaël quickly squeezed her eyes shut again. Somehow Raido grabbed her and started yelling at her to wake up. But how was that possible, he was as dead as possible. So she yelled back as hard as she could, maybe that would drift his spirit or whatever was stalking her, away from her.
While a new Spider-Man stumbles to arise, the former one is trying all he can to get back to the life he knew.
Peter knows better, of course; he’s spent until almost midnight to clean up the Penthouse – despite FRIDAY telling him not to do it – and only stopped when a furious Aunt May called him back up, in search for him.
“Actually, uh… Gwen… she died,” Peter admits sadly. Harry drops his pizza and his mouth, suddenly sitting up straight in the couch and looking at Peter with gigantic blue eyes.
Tony then seemed to take that as his cue to sit down on the chair Sam had been in earlier. “If your answer to my question won’t be ‘I feel like crap’ then you’re lying,” he muttered out. Steve just snorted again.
“You doin’ alright, kid?” he asks. He’s got a better grasp at keeping their relation quiet with others around. Peter still has a lot to learn if he ever wants to be as good as him.
tired, Dad?” Peter asks, taking in the dark circles under Tony’s eyes. The man blinks a few times but then smiles.
“Yeah, I’m Peter Parker? I got a phone call a few hours ago about my mother’s belongings?” Peter tries, resting his hands on the wooden desk and trying his best not to look too uncomfortable. The woman nods and smiles even more so.
Once they’re inside, Peter quickly straps on the seatbelt, preparing himself for the craziest ride of his life. When he looks next to him, he can notice a figure appearing from around the corner.
“Tony, I know you love the kid. He’s your son, for crying out loud,” Rhodey starts. “But I think that, right now, he’s only putting himself in danger.”
Her whole body stung and for a split-second, her whole vision went black. Luckily it came back right in time to steer away another fireball. With a hiss, Yaël stomped her foot against the ground, causing the concrete to sink Nilla’s feet in it and make her stuck. Nilla screamed out of frustration and fired the fireballs more and more quickly. Yaël send them back, but it took her a lot of effort to keep in focusing. A few of them, as she wasn’t always fast enough, burned her hands and her fingertips. Sometimes they even got to her stomach.
“Yes,” Tony finally admits after a silence of a minute long. The first tear finally rolls over his cheek and he wipes it away as fast as he can. Then he crosses his arms and leans back in his seat, pretending once again that he’s not crying.
Their arrival at the park brought both Peter and Aunt May speechless as they walked through the gate. Thanks to Tony’s probably very expensive VIP-passes, they get in almost immediately without any trouble. They’re handed a map of the entire place, and the only thing Tony tells them is that they can chose where they want to go first.
“Yeah, well, uh, sadly, it seemed like as they were searching through the few historical artifacts they’ve managed to take along, one of them accidentally summoned multiple plagues on the city. Nothing too disastrous, nobody was going to die, but Thor wanted this solved before the wedding.”
Without the need to talk, the two work together. Tony, being more experienced, knows a little better what he’s doing so Steve lets him take the lead which is just fine by Tony. They huff, they groan, they sweat. When their bodies are joined together, a few moans are let out as well. With their mouths almost permanently pressed against each other, Tony can feel Steve’s hot breath against his face. Buried into him, Tony makes slow movements to let Steve adjust, enjoying the gasps and the groans he makes. Their fingers tangle together, Steve turns his head to the side, teeth biting his lower lip. Tony kisses his neck.
Anyway, that’s in the past. Eventually, Ivan Vanko happened. Pepper went from personal assistant to CEO of Stark Industries along with Tony Stark’s girlfriend, aka the only one who can kind of keep him in check. And it worked for a little while. But then the invasion happened, the Avengers started moving him. And Pepper didn’t mind at all. She rather enjoys her conversations with Bruce, or her discussions with Clint. And sure, she has trouble trusting Natasha after that whole Natalie-business, but she’s still kind of fun to hang out with.
Gwen shrugs. “Venom from another universe. This is Peter,” she says, introducing Peter at last. “He’s your-“
’,” he carefully tried to explain her, his eyes were still following her movements. In front of them, memory-Yaël and –Lopt had both fallen asleep in the embrace.
It’s from when Harry attacked him. Peter can see the figure that is himself hanging in the air, held up by strong hands grabbing his throat and a fist slamming on his face again and again. He’s still bruised all over, which is probably why Flash has stayed clear for now.
“You don’t kick back, you afraid to hit a girl?” she jokes, kicking out her leg again but barely missing him.
Now, there's still a part of the series I need to finish before the next timestamp will be posted! Let's get to work!
Dressed in their thick coats, everybody exits the aircraft. Natasha lands the other ship not too far from the other. As soon as the other Avengers step out, Peter can see them all groaning and complaining from being inside for too long.
“Yaël, you don’t have to evaluate them or give them grades or anything. The students can choose for themselves if they want to follow this subject, like a hobby. Checkmate.” Yaël cursed, why did X think she was capable of teaching some angsty teens, if wasn’t even able to focus on a game of chess while arguing with him?
“Uh, honey, we haven’t been dancing for a while now… I’m pretty sure I’ll be stepping on your toes…”
But she got herself into danger because of it. She refused to stay behind at the most crucial of times. And what happened in the Batman movie, happened to Peter in real life.
Tony Stark’s voice says jokingly, and Peter once again rolls his eyes. Yeah, maybe one day he’d thought that having Iron Man as a father would be cool, but now he’s quickly come to realize that he’s not much different like other fathers – a huge dork, that is.
“Really, I’m good, Hilde. Don’t worry about me,” he assures her, trying to get up his ‘I’m fine’-smile. Hilde doesn’t seem to believe him, but at least she decides to drop the subject.
Peter decides that the best way for him to tune the two out is by taking out his headphones and start playing some music. When he looks down on his phone to select a song, he notices a message.
Then he stands up and straightens his clothes before walking away from his desk. As he passes Dum-E by, he pats him gently in head before making his way to the toilet.
Peter grumbles, realizing he might be the reason for that. Whatever, he can’t just take the blame for every stupid thing his Dad does now, can he? Tony’s still an adult, and sure, while he might not be that stable these past few days, he should manage on himself just fine, no?
Normally his plan had been to talk to Ned after this, to try and befriend the guy. All he’s thinking of right now is to call up
dark circles under his eyes. He looks pale, his eyes red. He’s the perfect description of a sleep-deprived person!
“Not so much. The people are insisting another wedding to make sure I am, but… You know that’s not really my thing.”
And there they pretend to make some more groaning, enjoying themselves and whatnot. Not too much later Tony starts shouting that he has soap in his eyes. He runs out of the shower, revealing his swimming trunk to their three-person audience.
But now, sitting here with his hands on his forehead and his teeth biting his lips, Peter realizes it quickly enough. He’s forgotten his medication for the past week, all because of his intensive hours at the internship.
fake!” Yaël mutters after the movie is playing for about forty minutes, and Johnny agrees by throwing popcorn towards the screen.
Peter wonders what’s happening here? Happy is still behind them, giving Pepper a small nod with, uh, red cheeks? Pepper, too, smiles at him and touches his arm as she greets him. Peter wants to watch, to see what’s going on there, but then he’s pushed inside and finds himself in a very light, open room.
“I’ll be right there!” he hears in return. Miles closes the fridge again and walks towards the couch. There he takes the remote control and starts up the news. Expecting the latest coverage of the Oscorp break-in, instead he sees it’s a live viewing of a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. Shit, that guy’s back?
“He will. I’ll make sure of that,” Tony says. And, true enough, in his head he’s already preparing everything he needs. It’s just a little folder, filled with all the files necessary to tell the other Tony a story. The story of how Tony fell in love. The story of how he’s never alone because of Steve. The story of how this Steve confesses everything to the wrong Tony.
“He’ll become the greatest hero I’ll ever know,” he then says truthfully, taking out his phone again to show her a picture of Spider-Man, followed by one with him wearing the suit but without the mask, standing next to Steve in his uniform. Mary falls quiet after that. A heavy breath escapes Tony’s lungs. He looks down at the brown couch, eyes going over the flowery pattern underneath him. On the table a bit further away are some magazines. One of them shows Tony’s face in a rather unfortunate picture as he was spotted drunk in public. He clears his throat and looks away quickly.
Tony nods in agreement, he’s indeed tired, fucking exhausted even. He shifts a bit in bed until he’s in a comfortable position – as much that is possible with all these tubes – and then he closes his eyes. But the noises keep him awake. The pump, the monitor, both his as the one from his neighbor. The shoes of the nurses in the hallway. There’s a phone going off, doors opening and closing.
“Steve was actually just telling us about your singing talents underneath the shower,” Clint throws back. Steve’s cheeks turn bright red after that and he jumps up.
“He totally did!” Peter exclaims happily. Then he points at his shirt. “He even got me this Star Wars t-shirt!”
And as long as Ross or any other of these guys don’t find out, there’s no harm in doing so. He’s good at doing things under the radar, after all.
“You betcha,” Peter jokes, walking towards the window and opening it up. With a short sting in his chest, he remembers how he entered his room through here with the Cat right behind him. “Say, uh, Karen… you still record everything?”
“I’VE BEEN –uh- ‘PERSUADING’ THIS MAN TO TELL ME ADARO’S NAME FOR AN HOUR!” Yaël shouted, still steering fire at the statue, working on the facial details.
“Sorry to burst your dream-bubble. I mean, I get you, I really do, but that hot piece of ass is already taken,” Tony says while picking up his cup and taking a large sip from his coffee. Darcy pulls her hand away, groans and drops her head onto Steve’s shoulder.
Huh, they’re standing right in front of Stark Industries… The universe must be shitting with him here.
“Wilson, you mean? I don’t get it, everybody finds him annoying but he’s been nothing but kind towards me,” Steve says with a frown. Peter snorts. Tony is still half dead next to him.
“I don’t think that’s such a good idea,” he admits in embarrassment. Everybody turns to him with an understanding expression.
“Well, you got me there!” he threw his hands in the air like he surrendered. “One problem, though…” he suddenly sounded dead-serious.
When Steve leans up to kiss Tony quiet, their roles reverse. Tony comes to lie down on his back, and Steve leans above him, their eyes looking deeply into the other and their lips stuck in a permanent smile. Tony reaches up his hand to pass it over Steve’s cheek, seeing how the man enjoys the touch.
“Well, well, who do we have here?” a familiar voice asks all of the sudden. Peter looks up, finding MJ standing behind a large bowl, serving soup to the people. Her hair is put up messily, and her cheeks are reddened. She looks good, he thinks.
“You are the best son in the world,” he says. Then he takes the drinks, and he leaves the common room to get to the elevator. Peter smiles as he watches his father leave. After that, he heads towards Natasha and Sharon and takes a place with them.
I remember when I wrote this chapter, I dicussed with Caspinn whether or not it wasn't maybe going too far. That maybe I was making too much drama or anything. I even planned on scrapping the whole thing and restart the following two chapters all over. Eventually, I decided to keep it, still, as I couldn't really come up with any other way to bring everybody back together (how horrible, I am...)
“Hi guys!” he calls out. He closes the door behind him and drops his key in the bowl next to the door. Then he kicks off his shoes, hangs up his coat and walks towards the couch. “Who’s winning?”
The rest of the day – heck, even the rest of the week – Peter receives stares from the people that saw him storm off.
As Peter lies asleep next to him, Tony takes his time to look at his son. Really look at him. He’s spent two weeks in complete radio-silence with no kind of news coming from him. It saddens Tony to see his boy so worn out. He looks like being tired is his main setting; there are dark circles under his eyes, which seem permanently red. His boy looks broken, at the verge of tears. Now that the high of the suit has come down and realization has hit, it has gone downward for his boy.
It’s obvious that Pepper seemed amused by the explanation. As she giggled, she put her shoes down on the ground and continued to the fridge barefooted.
“What?” Lopt acted surprised towards Raido, picking up the conversation like nothing happened in between
The rest of the drive it’s more one-sided banter between Rhodey and Tony. Once they arrive at the airport, it’s like Pepper has just lost all the patience she has again. Ushering everybody through security, they get themselves to the location where the aircraft is supposed to come down. It seems like they’re right on time, too.
“So, what, you came here to rip them a new one?” Peter asks. He starts walking forward towards the couch, dropping down on the three-sit. He’s not too surprised that it’s actually very comfortable. All too aware of Natasha staring him down, Peter clears his throat again.
Tony takes advantage of the opportunity to drink some of his water. Mary, who now has her hands on her legs and is staring at them intensely seems shocked. It’s probably too much information at once. Tony feels a bit bad for her that he has to tell her like this, but he can’t waste too much time here. He has no idea what exactly is going on in the present right now…
It starts with her storming towards Thor, who now has only one eye and short hair. When standing next to him, Peter had been suddenly reminded of how small she actually is. But, never too small to slap her space-boyfriend on the face with an angry expression on her face.
“Why isn’t he here? That’s not like him, to stay away from me when I’m like this? Normally he would hang all around me to make sure I’m okay?”
“Stop it, alright?!” Tony calls out, louder than he wanted. Pepper’s face changes from angry to surprised. Meanwhile, Rhodey walks up to him and holds out his hand. “You should all be glad that I didn’t hit the bottle.”
She quickly jumped back up again and kept on regaining warmth from the guy’s body, which she sent to her new sword, setting it on fire. Maybe the opponent would be smart enough to surrender. Hopefully…
Anyway, after a request, here's the de-ageing part. It's not completely how I wanted it to be, but you can blame my distracted mind for that!
At that, the boy seems to need a minute to think about it, and Tony offers it to him patiently. He still feels his eyes sting a little bit, and he almost curses at leaving his sunglasses back at the compound, otherwise he could have just put them on to shield away his red eyes.
“No kidding,” Bruce complains, rubbing his forehead while letting out a sigh. “Just when you think it’s finally over…”
“Well, Mr. Stark, I. Don’t. Care.” Dr. Strange walks off again, with Wong following behind him. Bruce gives Peter a short look before heading in the same direction.
“Do you have people who know who you really are?” he asks, pushing the right button that lets out a web, and seeing it fly towards the wall. He lets out a small laugh.
“Uh, FRIDAY? She just asked me if I can hear her?” Tony returns. Natasha shakes her head, walking up to him and putting a hand on his forehead.
Peter snorts. “You’re evil, you know that?” he shouts back. MJ just shows him her middle finger before disappearing back in the building. Peter chuckles again.
Steve doesn’t answer immediately this time. The line goes over, again and again, and for a moment Peter’s afraid that nobody will pick up. Then, his fear is pushed aside when Steve’s familiar voice fills the room again.
Peter was very persuasive. He won; he had brought her outside. And even though it was a warm day, as warm as January could get, and Yaël could feel the rays of the sun touching her through her thick sweater, she needed some time to warm back up. It felt like the cold got stuck in her bones. Peter noticed, so he grabbed his sweater out of his backpack and handed it to Yaël. She replied with another sneeze and a muffled “Thank you…” as she cleaned her nose. When she was done, she threw him a wide smile.
“You would not survive long enough to reach the past,” Charles reveals. “Last time we sent Logan because he was the only one who was able to heal himself fast enough. You, I’m afraid, do not possess that ability.”
And it hurts. It hurts to freaking much to see her just standing there, alive, healthy, confused. And Peter can’t help it. He walks up to her, takes her face between his hands and kisses her right on her lips. She doesn’t refuse it, doesn’t push it away. Instead, she throws her arms over his shoulders, leaning into the kiss like her life depends on it.
When Clint returns with his computer, the three of them place the laptop on the table. Natasha holds in her breath while she tries to listen to the two of them.
“He’s only in need of two more stones,” Thor says, left eye glowing blue, but fainter than before. He’s breathless, his power waning. There’s blood splattered all over his face. Tony is aware he’s grieving for his fellow Asgardians that have fought along with them.
After they put away the plates, they decided it was time to go. “So, are we going to have sex after this?” Wade asked as they were walking down the stairs.
Steve motions for Barnes to lower the gun, which he does, eyes still resting on Tony carefully, like he’s preparing himself for another attack.
“Well, I guess you are a big reason why they work so well together, then,” she offers. Peter quickly shakes his head.
He shouldn’t have been surprised when it appeared Felicia is a person who keeps true to her word. At the shelter, where Peter told her he would be, the brown-haired girl suddenly shows up, followed by a  horrible-looking, clearly hung-over Johnny Storm.
But what good will that eventually do? To postpone it does not equal to avoid it. He can’t help but sigh, eyes closing when the first drop of rain lands against the window he’s staring through. His eyes go down for a second, landing on the burn-mark the Bifröst left when Thor decided to go home a while ago. He wonders how the guy is doing at the moment, but he’s probably better than Tony…
“No, still in that coma,” she explains. “I wish he would just wake up. It’s extremely difficult to care for the guy with all those arms in the way, you know!”
According to his AI, Tony’s often working in the workshop. And at first, Peter liked to join him, until he showed more interest in Mary’s field of work rather than Tony’s. The same thing goes for Thomas, who, in fact, doesn’t want anything to do with science at all. Then, with Tony mostly just working, it turns out he never really makes much time for his children. Natalee’s still innocent enough at eight years to still be happy to see him whenever she can. Thomas, who’s thirteen, and Peter, who’s fifteen, both grew out of that phase and have grown to dislike him.
He feels a hand on his shoulder all of the sudden, startling him to a point where he jumps off the ground. Turning towards Felicia, he finds her blue eyes looking up at him, giving him an expression he recognizes from somewhere. It’s not pity, luckily. It’s understanding.
“No, I already oiled your gears one hour ago. I’m not going to do it again!” Peter tells him, gently pushing the bot away. The doors of the workshop suddenly open, and Pepper walks inside, looking down at her tablet.
“Yeah okay, I’ll see if I can come over later today, then,” Peter says. He’s wondering if he’s imagining the rumbling sound he’s hearing on the other side of the line.
“Everything went perfectly, Petey,” he says. Then he bumps his hip against Peter’s and pulls up his hand with his watch on it. “Be sure to get changed in time. And you still know what you’re going to say when they ask you to sign?”
Everybody raises their glass as well. Brunnhilde just copies Bruce and Sharon – it seems like the two women know each other. At least that’s good, right?
He and Mantis are quiet. They don’t have a lot to say right now. Peter’s still not feeling extremely well, and Mantis knows exactly what he’s going through. Literally, since she can sense everything he feels just whenever she touches him. And while she tries to shift his emotions as much as she can, she doesn’t dare to make the shift too big, unknowing of what that could do to him.
“It’s going to be fine,” Natasha tells him gently, kissing him on the top of his head, covered by the mask. Peter smiles a bit. When he turns around, the portal is gone.
Its around four in the afternoon that he arrives. He called in advance, asking Reed to tell everybody to be here. But it meant that Johnny had to cancel his ‘date’ with that girl he met in the bar. Of course, everybody knows how that
Tony doesn’t answer, not really knowing what more he can say. It’s not too hard for people to change their minds about stuff like this. Especially when it comes to Tony; he’s more than a handful of trouble. He’s selfish, eccentric, and tends to fix his problems by waving money at it.
That’s his plan; after finding out that there’s a certain pizza-place that has been there even before the second world war, he immediately read up an article about it where the owner from back then proudly said that the one and only Captain America used to be a regular customer before being called to war. Tony put two and two together, and decided they don’t
Peter had never had such a sarcastic look on his face before. He was clearly not liking the idea of driving with Wade, since the guys seemed to only bring bad luck to Peter. But when the teenager didn’t seem to be able to make a decision, Yaël jumped into the car, grabbed Peter’s arm and pulled him inside too.
“WHY DOESN’T STARK HAVE THE GUTS TO COME AND TELL ME THIS HIMSELF?!” Vision stayed admirable calm, which triggered Yaël even more.
And now here he is; with the envelope still in his hands, sitting on his bed. One part of him only wished Mr. Stark had read the file, had asked questions, and that Peter would have spilled the beans. But the other part of him is glad; if Peter would have come there, asking for a scholarship and at the same time revealing that he’s his son, the man wouldn’t have believed him at all.
“Why not?” Tony asks angrily, feeling a strong burning feeling inside of him that is far from pleasant. Strange doesn’t seem affected by his tone.
“C’mon baby boy, wake up for us, okay? Steve’s here now, so you just stay with us,” Tony mutters against his son’s head. Steve holds him even tighter.
“You can’t stop me,” the guy says, pulling up his left fist to punch him in the face. Peter stops it easily, turning the hand around painfully until the man lets out a painful shout. Looking down at the man’s hand, he sees it.
A knock on the door makes him look up. He rubs his eyes dry, sniffs his nose and jumps up from the bed.
“I know things have been shit between the two of you,” he starts. He can see Steve opening his mouth to warn him about his language, but he stops him. “Tony, in my universe you told me everything that was bothering you. You told me about your insecurities, about your childhood. You told me about your guilt. Now, I don’t need you to start explaining everything to him, you didn’t in my universe. But you two just need to talk, start somewhere.”
“Sex, I know – stop being so flustered or I’m going to repeat the word time after time. And now, I don’t think we’ll have it soon. Because that, too, is something to work up to. And I guess that’s the reason you’re so at war with it; it’s too much, too soon, and you were afraid we were going to topple the boat.”
Here we go again. I'm early again, mostly just impatient and willing to give it all to you at once! Damn it, the urge is strong. I hope I'm not flooding you all with chapter updates. Thanks for all the kind comments, as always. I'm grateful for each and every one of them <3
And Peter flinches a bit when Tony stands up, dropping the suit back onto the ground. Then, after a few seconds, Tony opens up his arms and immediately, Peter practically jumps into them. With his face pressed against Tony’s shoulder, he sobs it out, letting go of the tears and the uncertainty.
“I told him I was your mentor, and that I was close friends with your aunt,” Tony says, and then he reaches for his pocket and takes out a folded piece of paper. “And I also might have had your aunt’s signature forged to make this letter.”
He’s out of the apartment building in no time, already swinging his way out of Queens and heading more into Midtown. That’s where he usually starts, though other than that he doesn’t particularly have a tour to follow. Sometimes he gets all the way to Coney Island, sometimes he even passes through Hell’s Kitchen.
“Yet you still did,” Tony answers without looking up, though he’s dropped the screwdriver and the circuit board. “And you were right; I’m not the right person to start telling you what to do. I don’t have that right.”
"Hey, Pete, how was school?" he asks. Peter shrugs, leaning forward to catch a glimpse of what Tony is making.
Pepper bites through it, tells herself it’s going to pass, that Tony’s just enthusiastic about his childhood idol and him finally getting along. She even talks to Rhodey about it, notices Natasha giving her knowing looks whenever she’s around the compound – however sporadically that is.
“Oh, yeah, I would have rocked your entire evening. Just imagine, fancy dinner, band playing something slow, ring suddenly in your glass-“
Tony blinks a few times. Then he pulls one hand loose and pulls Peter closer to him into a strong hug. It lasts for a few seconds, the man unwilling to let his son go. It feels good, to be held like this. Peter, for a moment, doesn’t want it to stop.
“Look, sir, we’re very lucky she hasn’t accidentally drowned herself or put herself on fire. This is no woman you just put in a hospital,” Steve sounded more impatient than usual.
A sigh escapes from his lips, and he finds himself wondering if he should get inside or not. There’s no specific reason for him to be there, but he can’t help but feel curious at what’s inside. Maybe he should go asking for that internship, but he’s not sure if they’d even accept him if he’s not a student.
“But I was scared, so I stayed with what I knew. And Richard apologized for that fight, and then Peter happened, and then… I figured it was just for the better like this.”
They look scared, shy, but at least healthy as much as they can be while being stuck in a burning building. The younger boy starts rubbing his eyes, drying away a tear.
Suddenly, Peter is no longer standing in front of them, instead running around them. When he starts walking up the walls, both Tony and Steve tilt their heads to the side.
“That’s what’s going on here, honey; just pain and discomfort,” Tony adds in irritation. He can only hear Sam in the background mutter something about ‘guess how that happened’ towards Rhodey before there’s another snort. “Who’s putting coffee rounds into the disposal? Am I running a Bed & Breakfast for a Biker gang?”
Raido had told her that the Royal Library was the most important room in the whole building, for all the secrets of whole Helvegen were written and kept there.
, Peter leans against the door, putting a hand on his hip while he waits for the men to turn around. He clears his throat once.
Yaël saw how he pulled the chords and instead of a little blow…the whole apartment exploded. The force of the explosion caused Yaël to fly back out of the door. Something sharp stung her back, but there was so much fire and heat, she couldn’t open her eyes to see what was happening to her. Her arm scraped against something, for a second, Yaël had the chance to open her eyes again and saw that she was falling down and that her arm was scraping against the concrete wall. Before she could pull her arm back, she severely smacked against her back.
Wanda, in the meantime, hasn’t really done much. It’s not easy, being a wanted fugitive, so she’s mostly spent her time in the Royal Palace at Wakanda, meeting some people and learning how to play the guitar.
“I did not!” he counters, but Tony laughs as he puts his hand on Steve’s chest, giving Clint a pleased look.
“I don’t know. I’ve been crap at keeping contact. Haven’t called Ned much, either, even though he’s texted me a lot… Heck, I’ve barely been talking to May since I went to college… That’s how much Venom fucked me up!”
“Ooh, look at this dress!” Wade said as he pulled out some skimpy, deep blue dress. Well, actually, it wasn’t that reveling, it just looked like an extremely tight dress.
Steve wants to counter that, to say that, even though he wishes it was so, Peter’s not his son. Of course, it feels like he is, nonetheless.
Luckily, Johnny makes the decision for him. The moment he notices Peter, he gives him an unimpressed look before leaning against the wall, closing the door again the moment Peter’s inside.
that something happened; things feel a bit awkward here, somehow. Mr. Stark is incredibly quiet, and Aunt May seems to shoot quick glances at the man before focusing on Peter again.
Tony’s in the workshop. It’s a good change of scenery, a lack of voices in a room where only machinery matters now. FRIDAY barely speaks up, Dum-E, U, Butterfingers and Id-Jit are rolling around in search for something to do. The sound of their wheels on the ground, their gears moving as they lift up their arms, is soothing.
him?” she suddenly interrupts him, pulling back her hands slightly before resting them on her hips. When a young couple tries to get a view from the panel they’re standing in front of, they slowly move aside until they’re out of the way.
“D-dude, chill. I never st-stole anybody’s girl,” Peter manages out. Eddie’s face just seems to color red all over.
“Yeah, it’s a little get-together. So far only a few of the Souza-Carter family are going to join, but you’re welcome, too,” Tony explains. Bruce nods happily.
Adding the last part necessary to put the ship back together, he finally turns to Peter. The people are safe, but he doesn’t want to have this conversation here.
“Please, I’ve barely been on the field lately,” Tony mutters out, tapping on the table while he looks down at the puzzle-cube he had been toying with. Looks like he figured it out again. “A lot of new heroes around lately, Iron Man’s not needed as much, anymore.”
Next to him, Steve seems to be liking Felicia a lot. Being a lover for the arts as well, Steve seems to find himself an excellent conversation partner in Peter’s current girlfriend.
“I’ll teach you, just follow my lead,” he answers, before pulling Steve along on the dancefloor, but staying on the side. It’s time to dance to the swing of the music.
“Somehow, don't ask me how, they travelled back to a point in time before Thanos ever invaded us, though before that happened, in that alternate timeline-“
“No, you just didn’t want to be seen with me. And, okay, that hurts, but I can live with that for now. But
Then the two of them, in the fragment, suddenly noticed each other and somehow their first, immediate reaction was starting to yell at one another without any context or indication of a fight.
“If you’re no longer with MJ, who are you going to ask for senior prom?” Peter then asks. Harry hums in thought.
“My mommy tells me that when people are grieving, it gets a little better with choc’lates,” Harry told him, not seeming certain what all of the words meant. But Peter took the box, and ever since that moment, their friendship started.
“I’m Felicia,” she returns. You look like you’re lost, do you need some directions?” She nods towards the map in Peter’s hand. Peter looks down, figuring that he might as well have her lead the way.
“It can’t get to Peter again, Steve!” Tony calls out, his voice sounding desperate. Steve sighs, grabbing a hold of both of Tony’s arms and making him turn until they’re staring at each other.
“Peachy,” Tony returns. Steve rolls his eyes, pulling on his hand and stopping them in their tracks.
“Why aren’t you going with them?” Peter asks once he finds his voice again, ignoring his question. The archer just shrugs and smirks at him.
“Nothing much. Bruce and Tony have been trying to find out more about that meteor that destroyed the base,” Steve explains. “We’ve sent out some stuff to Princess Shuri and Dr. Richards as well, but even still the results are coming in slowly.”
He jumps back on his feet, ignoring the stinging in his head. He needs to get to the guy before he can run off. With a strength in him that he’s not really used to, yet, he jumps up into the sky and lands right where the blast originated. The guy’s nowhere near here, but his eyes catches the footprints in the dust on the ground. Somebody ran off before anybody saw it.
“Timing could have been better,” Rhodey mutters before exiting the bathroom to open up the door. Peter decides he’ll find out who it is afterwards. He rinses off his hair, gets his body cleaned up, and then jumps out of the shower to get dried off quickly. After a quick look at his watch, he figures he still has about an hour to get ready. Tony’s Team only needs about twenty minutes with him or so, at the most.
He can’t face him; not now. Too much has happened. Even looking at Steve’s face and realizing that he’s the one that brought that blood there…
“You’re the best, this wasn’t necessary at all. I don’t even know how I can thank you for thi-“ Someone interrupted her by scraping his throat. Both of them looked up and saw Stark, standing in the doorway. His face was emotionless. Steve immediately pulled himself from Yaël’s arms.
severe. Sometimes it’s about Tony not putting away his laundry, or Steve forgetting about date-night because he spent too much time in the gym. There’s always these little things that’ll annoy the hell out of each other. But next to that, there are also times where Peter’s sure that the two men are quite happy with each other.
And it's 20 past midnight here, so officially the 25th! Merry Christmas to everybody, I hope you all have lots of fun today, whether it is with friends, family, or with your dear house pets because they matter, too!
“Then what makes you keep on thinking he’s suffering from it? From what you’ve told me, the only suffering he’s been doing is to be apart from you. There’s only one thing and that’s you, Tony. Nothing else.”
“Fire-breathing. Rhodey told me Killian pretended to be a dragon,” Tony recalls. On the notebook, the words come down as he tells them. “And then there’s that thermal regulation itself. They could just burn through anything.”
“Looks like we’re both hopeless when it comes to the matters of the heart,” he says, copying Natasha’s words. The thing she told him when Pepper was going to break up with him. The sentence Tony thought was about Bruce, while in fact he now knows better.
“You’re doing great, Tony,” Steve whispers back, kissing his skin with such a tenderness that makes Tony feel light in his head. “I’m sure Peter already adores you.”
“Are you saying that you’re in friendly relations with Captain Rogers, then?” the boy adds on. Now Tony’s completely confused.
School started again, but Peter couldn’t care any less; what was school without Gwen, anyway? He didn’t skip classes, but he forgot his homework, spaced out during class, and failed his tests. It didn’t matter, after all. He lost weight, stopped doing anything he liked, and ended up having trouble sleeping. Whenever he slept, his dreams were filled with images of what happened at the tower. He mostly woke up screaming and sweaty.
“I can’t promise that and you know it,” Tony jokes. He reaches for Steve’s face, poking him once on the nose before laughing. Steve just rolls his eyes.
Flash hesitates a bit longer, but eventually he lowers Peter to the ground completely. Then, he turns back to him, hissing in his face.
“Is Steve here, too?” he tries to change the subject. One of the women starts powdering Peter’s face, causing for him to sneeze.
Tony feels weird, having to park his car in the street like this. Before he can get out of the car to pay for a parking ticket, Steve’s already on the job. That stubborn bastard. Tony smiles slightly while looking down to the ground, still not really able to grasp how lucky he is to have Steve.
“Urgh, shut up,” Tony groans, walking towards the door before stopping himself. Then he hurries back to his desk, grabbing the small, long box, and brings it with him as he exits the room. Natasha watches him as he disappears, but she doesn’t say anything more.
“Hey, you don’t get to laugh, Capsicle! Best friends with Stark and you can’t even work a simple smartphone? The man would be ashamed!” With that, Yaël points towards the flip-phone lying on the table. Steve once again turns red in the face.
“No way! You know Nick Fury and Professor X?” Peter asks, unable to keep his voice down. “Everybody’s heard of them, Nick Fury is like the most secretive guy in the world – we even thought him dead for long until he showed himself again during that Ultron-disaster! But Professor X! Man, what’s it like, having him in your head?”
“It wasn’t just to save Peter, it was to save the universe,” Tony counters angrily. Strange crosses his arms.
"Sounds cool," he says. Then he moves away, getting back to his own desk to start working on his homework. After pulling out his papers, he can hear Tony talking behind him.
As the days pass by, the weeks go forth, Tony can’t help but feel somehow attached to the kid. Somehow, he recognizes so much of himself in Peter, it’s almost scary. There are a few of Mary’s quirks in there, too – the lighter shade of hair in comparison to his own (but still dark on itself), the pale skin, the nervous tapping with the fingers on the table. Tony notices it all. He’s never met Richard Parker to be able to make a comparison.
“What did you just call me?” Flash asks, a bit curious. The girl just snorts and puts her hands on her hips before walking forward.
So playing dirty, is what she’s suggesting. Peter just nods, wondering if he can still call himself an orphan. He has a great Aunt who’s taking care of him, and there’s the biggest possibility that the man he’s going to ask for money to could maybe possibly
could help cheer Tony up somehow, it’s clear that their mission didn’t go exactly as planned. With Rumlow finally out of the picture, Natasha explains to Peter that Wanda accidentally blew up a building, and many people died because of it.
They’re standing in a circle, surrounding another kid in the middle. Even from afar, Peter knows that they’re not just socializing in the friendly way. With a few more swings, he gets himself closer, waiting to listen while sticking to the wall.
Hiding his backpack in the tree, Peter drops down on the ground and casually walks over to the front door. There are a few people looking at him in confusion, and another guy clearly freaking out because of his presence. Peter ignores them, instead knocking on the door and waiting for an answer.
“I didn’t do enough.” Then, as Tony recovers again from the sudden fit, Steve pulls his hand away, leaning back against the chair he’s put next to Tony’s bed. “But that’s going to change now.”
Steve nods, and when he leans forward to meet Tony’s lips, Peter quickly closes his eyes again. He can handle much, but watching the two in such a tiny intimate moment feels like a major breach of privacy. The fact that Tony is this calm despite the two of them never having talked about what happened before Steve left is surprising enough. It’s somehow immensely mature of Tony, all of which he’s always been told Tony is not.
“Should we send some of this stuff to Shuri?” Bruce asks. Tony puts a finger on his chin while he quickly looks over the words on the page. “The more people are on this, the better. Maybe send some of this stuff to Reed as well…”
“Peter! Hi! Uh, hi! Hello! Good evening! We did- We didn’t know you were coming today?” he stutters out.
“Seriously?” Tony can see him mouth. Tony just snorts, walking forward for a bit until he’s reached him. Then he offers him his shield back.
“The other me and Steve, huh? I guess things are not that different, then…” Tony mutters out. Peter shakes his head, putting a hand on the desk. He needs to get Steve here, someway. He quickly turns to Gwen.
“You one of those one-night-stand-girls, then? No strings attached?” Peter said as he pulled away one of his hands and put it behind his head, so he could look at her.
The man swallowed a piece of the fruit before he answered. “You lived here with your father a long time ago. A very, very long time ago. His name was-“
They might have spit out their drinks on the screen, and the bowl of pop-corn might have been dropped on the ground. Nobody would have thought Steve to
“Alright, well, it starts in half an hour or so. Everything is ready. As you know, there’s just one round for each instead of two since there’s three of you.”
“Yeah, uh, she was doing fine last time I checked. Getting some chances at training, which she really needed,” Peter answers.
To be fair, Peter’s sure Tony took that into account, which is why they’re flying in two separate quinjets, but… yeah, even with May’s constant fussing over him, Rhodey’s attempts of distracting him by playing cards, Steve’s calm stories of whatever crazy thing that happened back with the Howling Commandos to even Clint’s failing jokes, Peter’s about ready to start crawling up the walls.
“It’s, uh- I was- uh…” but then Peter’s eyes go wide, quickly looking around Tony in search for something. “Dad, where’s Steve?”
“Yeah, it was less fun to be in the middle of it, though,” he admits, pointing at one of the big guys Harry’s drawn rather perfectly how Peter remembers it. “That space-whale gave me nightmares long after it happened.”
“Anyway, I don’t think they’ll be there. They haven’t been active since Midland Circle, haven’t they?” Peter asks. Ned shakes his head. Happy then parks the car in the underground parking underneath the tower. Quickly, the two teenagers jump out. “Thanks Happy!”
“Seriously, that’s all you have to say?” he finds himself snapping a bit, not believing he’s here talking his heart out and Steve is just waving it off like that.
“Hey, I’m still down to marrying your son,” he says with a wink, though it lacks the usual enthusiasm. He tries to hide it, but Tony can see just how worried he is. It’s kind of endearing.
“Now, if you all excuse me, I’m getting some work done in the workshop, alright?” Tony excuses himself. Before anybody else can respond, he’s already out of the door with his tablet under his arm. Peter catches the sad look on Steve’s face when he sees him go, and for a moment he wonders if they’ve been fighting. But Peter remembers how he’s found them here on the couch, so he figures they must be alright, no?
“Just, I need to help MJ. But… Before I go, I need you to know something. Something you need to pass along to May and Tony for me, alright?”
“This is my second year here. The school’s pretty good, but I can’t wait to just… graduate,” she sighs. “I’m in the arts, what about you?”
I also hadn't really thought about the fact that not everybody might know about what exactly encephalopathy is and what ties it has to acute liver failure. Mostly, because of the disfunction of the liver there are possible psychologic and neurologic problems coming up. The symptom of encephalopathy goes up into 4 stadiums, each one progressly worse, with the fourth one being coma. Because the liver can't do it's job, the blood can't really be 'cleaned'. I can go much further into detail with it, but I don't really know how to do that without throwing in my whole notebook :') Let's just say that Tony won't be completely there all the time, and it just gets worse.
“I had my suspicions ever since Mary decided to shut you out right before ending pregnant with Peter,” she admits. “Of course, she never admitted, and I never asked.”
“Then what is it?” Peter wants to know what suddenly made them all change their minds. If it’s not the thing that happened earlier, then what made them afraid to let him join.
After about five seconds, he shoots out his first web to the nearest building. After that, he starts swinging, letting out a relieved scream at the familiarity of it all. He’s so glad he didn’t end up losing this after going after Mr. Toomes.
Peter’s mouth falls open in surprise. Another party? Is that really such a good idea? He knows last party was a disaster because he couldn’t keep away from the drinks and that’s easily avoided next time, but on the other hand he’s a bit scared he’s going to make another fool of himself.
So Peter doesn’t sign. Neither does Wanda. They look at each other, and Peter holds his thumb up. Soon, it’ll be their turn, after all.
the reason they’re arguing, he rolls his eyes and lies down on the bed. With evening falling, he doesn’t expect he’ll be leaving his bedroom again until the two of them have gone to bed.
to make a sex tape?” James asks, sounding literally appalled and shocked by it. Steve’s mouth flies open, eyes going wide. Then he throws a glare at Tony.
“What the-?” he asks in confusion. He starts pulling a bit at his neck to see if the fabric stretches along a little bit. He’s disappointed to see that’s a negative.
“It’s not that I’ve been actively dreaming of it, but I don’t really mind the addition,” he admits. “Of course, it would have been better if the others would have been here.”
