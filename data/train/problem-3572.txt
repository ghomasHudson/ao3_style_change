“Fine. San Francisco it is. But I’m picking the location for the third one.”
“Why?”
“I’m here, Cas,” he said softly. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“Then maybe magic works here too. Spells. Maybe there are hunters here. Maybe there’s a way to jump universes here that we don’t know about.”
“Yeah,” Chuck said, dragging the word out. “Tragic, isn’t it? Such innocence, but then, just under the surface… It’s thrilling to see this play out.”
“It is. But it’s worth it.”
“No.” Dean shook his head. “You don’t need to apologize. I’m just saying, how can you say he didn’t hurt you? I
“Aww, look at you,” Gabe said as Dean spread the blankets over Cas, keeping his injured wing uncovered. “You can give him a sponge bath while he’s recovering.”
Maybe locking Dean up was going to be the best thing, but Castiel had an idea to try first. “Dean!” he said loudly. “Sam’s in trouble!”
Cas nodded. “I make seventy percent of the retail price on most ebook sales, and between forty and fifty-five percent on paper books. I’m looking into doing audio books too. If you received fifty percent of the retail price of all your books sold in the next year, assuming your sales numbers stayed the same, what do you think you’d make?”
“Which will be less, Bela. I don’t think Crowley will be happy about that. But let’s see, huh?” Dean pulled out his phone and scrolled through the contacts. “I’ll just give him a quick call—”
“Vibrate them back into the etheric plane?” Dean finished.
“Oh, I supposed you’re gonna say next that I’m one of the versions. Not really Dean.” He stared at Castiel for a moment before throwing his hands up in the air. “Really? You’re gonna go there, Cas? How about I prove to you how real I am?”
“You playing it!” Gabe said, grinning.
The new something reached his solar plexus and Dean felt like a missing piece had been reunited, as if some part of himself that he’d lost long ago had now been returned. Which made no sense, until the thought made it through Dean’s pleasure-soaked brain that maybe he was feeling the piece of Cas’ grace that had been left behind, now reunited with Cas himself. Was that even possible?
“I remembered something. I never told you about it.” He shrugged. “Never figured I’d need to. But now I’m wondering if it’s important.”
“Thanks, Dr. Phil,” Dean said, standing and moving toward Castiel. “Cas, what do you need?”
“It was…intense.” He looked at Sam and did the breathing thing, noting that it did calm him further.
As soon as the laptop beeped that an email had arrived, Dean downloaded the photo and looked at it. “Dramatic. All that brick, those white columns, and that huge-ass steeple. Very fitting. I can see why you like it.”
?” Husband Dean looked shocked. “I vote for meeting
“Not…cold.” Castiel struggled to get the words out. “Can’t…control…that.”
“What the hell is this, Cas?” Dean demanded. “We don’t have photos up in the bunker. We don’t have hardly any photos period.”
“Okay. Whatever. Let’s get out of here.”
“I’m not trying an untested spell on him,” Dean warned.
“Well, that was just for fun,” Gabriel said.
“That’s not all,” Sam said. “Punishment is now public execution without due process. And Dean…they’re not just killing them.”
A little after noon, as they were sitting on the sofa, brainstorming ideas about a publishing company name for Dean’s books, Bela called.
“And then he asked to stay in your room. In your bed. With you.”
Sam directed the thought toward Gabriel.
“Yeah?”
“I didn’t know what happened with the first wing. I figured it out with the second.”
“How…?”
“We had an argument,” Dean corrected. “I left before I said something I’d regret.”
“We weren’t painting each other’s toenails, if that’s what you mean.”
“Maybe,” Cas said, tilting his head slightly to the side, “you should pay attention now.”
“If you want. But you need to know that he can’t say anything during this.”
Dean dropped his fork onto his plate. “Oh, hell, no.” He pointed at Gabriel. “That’s
Dean caught himself in the midst of licking his lips, saw Cas’ gaze fixated on them, then banished his fear. Maybe Cas’ kisses were those of an innocent beginner—because angel and all—and
Dean nodded. “So what are we gonna do about this implant he’s got? Sam said they’ve got GPS in them, and the last thing we want is to broadcast our location.”
“Here’s what I’d like you to do, Dean. Would you draw a picture of what you think the baby will look like? Or maybe a picture of your whole family together? I’ll be back as soon as I can.” Castiel handed back the picture of himself. “And keep this safe for me.”
“If it can,” Castiel agreed.
“No. Balthazar was sent to bring me to Naomi’s office. She didn’t like that I’d interfered, even though what I did ensured the future Heaven wanted.”
“Good. The great thing about fiction is that creators can take artistic license. It’s all about enjoying the ride.”
“Are you going to do this throughout the movie?”
Before Dean could make a decision about who was going to take what position, Cas pulled him close and manhandled him into the little spoon. This time, Dean figured, it was okay. Cas would take care of him.
“Be careful what you ask for, right?” Moving his bread plate, Dean set the box down next to his plate of chicken and something that looked rubbery and green.
“Sorry for all my questions,” Sam said. “I’ve never really had anyone to ask before.”
“My full name. Please.”
“Thank you.” Once Cas finished with the other arm, he moved off of Dean’s legs and lightly grazed his fingertips over Dean’s ass cheeks on the way to his thighs. Dribbling more massage oil on the backs of Dean’s thighs, Cas found more sore muscles and tender spots that Dean didn’t even realize were there. The backs of his calves were particularly sore, and Cas hummed as he rubbed the tension out.
Nodding once, Gabriel let out a short breath. “Yeah.”
Dean shook his head. “I can’t. I have to watch Sammy.”
Tween Dean cocked his head. “I love you, Dean.”
“Ugh.” Dean made a face. “So, muscles.”
“You booked this as part of your Plan B?”
Castiel followed from a discreet distance as Cain made his way into a field, where a taller, leaner man was using his body to keep a wayward lamb from running off into the nearby hills.
wedding anniversary for John and Mary, Dean and Bobby in front of Singer’s Auto Shop, Sam’s and Jess’ wedding, a multi-generational photo of Sam and Dean with their parents and Sam’s and Jess’ kids, and the most unsettling, a photo of himself and Dean in tuxedos, showing off their wedding rings.
“You did laugh,” the man chastised gently. He returned his attention to Castiel and his companions. “I’ll see you off.”
Blue eyes searched his own for a moment, reflecting the light from the overhead lamp. “No, Dean. I’m telling you that reading your book changed my life.”
“Rest would be wise,” Castiel said. “Healing takes a lot of energy. Do you want me to—?” He held out two fingers.
“I appreciate that, Sam. Thank you.”
“I must have,” Castiel said, walking in without waiting for an invitation. If this Dean thought they were married, then asking to enter would be unusual. He stood in the living room of an apartment, with a small eating area off to the left, a kitchen just beyond it, and a hallway that must lead to the bedrooms.
“Then I will try my best not to hurt him.”
“Let’s go find out if this works,” Cas said, abruptly turning and walking quickly back toward the library.
walk on water.”
“That was
Sighing, Castiel nodded. This was it. “I would not expect you to, Dean. He is your true family.”
Moments later, light streamed from her eyes and mouth, and Dean averted his eyes against the bright glare as he felt the blast wave surge past him. By the time he looked back, thinking it was safe, Cas was standing in front of him, every bit the terrifying angel he remembered from years ago.
When Dean glanced in his rearview mirror, Gabriel had managed to look like a pouting four-year-old. “You know,” Dean said, “the more I see of you, the harder it is to believe that you’re an archangel.” He turned down the music. Better avoid any more temptation for Gabriel’s version of karaoke.
(Enochian): This is all I know
“Cas! You’re okay!”
“There’s a motel in Smith Center,” Sam said. “About twenty minutes away. We can regroup, get some breakfast. I could use a few hours of sleep.”
“Your brother offered his best,” Castiel said, fully immersed in the memory. “You brought what was easiest. You can improve, and you will be completely forgiven. You have the power to turn this around. You rule over sin.”
“Thanks,” Dean said, feeling himself blush. Two dozen books out, and he still had a hard time with compliments. But the solution, he’d learned, was easy: redirect. Fans loved to talk. “You here as a fan?”
“Yeah, I got that.” Gabriel pulled out a chair from a small table next to Sam’s bed and straddled it, letting his wings drag on the floor behind him. “Well, there was no way I could just
Gabriel hung his head. “I’m sorry. I really didn’t expect that to happen the first time. It took me as much by surprise.”
Dean shrugged. “Figured I would. I know your tells. I’ll know if it’s doing any good.”
“How come I never knew all this about you?”
“Dean accompanied me because of the current political climate. He was concerned I would be taking undue risks.”
kidding, right?”
them!” Castiel hissed.
A young woman wearing an apron over a red gingham top appeared from behind a large rack varied teas at the other end of the counter, smiled at him as she walked to the register, and tapped once on the tablet. “What can I get for you, sir?”
Despite his obvious distress, Cas managed to quirk an eyebrow up. “You have never been interested in
“Well, we kinda have to. Small laptop screen.”
“Dean?” Castiel immediately recognized the child when Dean looked up.
“Exactly. Anything like that. Memories might or might not come up. Your subconscious is actually leading this. Or at least, that’s how it would work for humans. We’re hoping that’s how it’ll work for you too.”
Dean seemed near to tears again. Sniffling, he grabbed Cas in a hug. “Thank you.”
“Easy there, tiger. This is why I wanted to talk to you about this.”
Sam chuckled as he took the offered half-biscuit. “Breaking bread with me?”
Dean nodded.
“Thanks,” Cas said with a nod.
Castiel’s shoulders and wings shrugged in unison. He picked up the sad-looking honey packet, grimaced, and set it back down again, then reached for his napkin and wiped off his fingers. “Remember,” he said softly, “angels are hated now, and your government has given the public free rein to express that however they wish.”
“Yeah, but Cas, we could be doing
Dean felt an instant panic flare up and tried to push it down with every swear word he could think of. Why couldn’t Sam have made up papers registering Castiel as human? Why couldn’t they just pass Castiel off as Jimmy?
“Yeah, well…” Gabriel shrugged. “I’m nothing if not unpredictable. Come on now, another bite.”
“A pleasant, comfortable nap, rocked gently in the back seat of a car hopefully speeding away from law enforcement and the idiocy taking hold in this country. But,” Gabriel pocketed the pen and hung the clipboard at the foot of the bed, “we’re not here to talk about me. And you,” he produced a large slice of white cake nearly identical to the one from the bakery, complete with plate and doily, “haven’t tried hospital food yet.”
“You know what happened. You and Sam started geeking out, leaving me to feel like the class dunce.”
“My mission,” Castiel clarified. “I remembered my mission.”
“I heard,” Sam said. “How about dinner Friday night? Our place.”
“Well, we think that there are other bedrooms there. Wherever your bedroom is. And there’s other people that need help. And… And if you…draw something…maybe about yourself? Or maybe that drawing of Cas? Then when the others see it, they can write or draw something too.”
“I was the peacemaker. Or I tried to be. But every time I tried to smooth things over, it always seemed to make things worse. I think I cared too much. After high school, I worked a lot of odd jobs, looking for what moved me, made me smile. And then one day I was browsing the new fiction section in the library and came across a novel titled
“My work here is done,” Sam said. “And I
Castiel nodded once. “Of course. Let me just…” He closed his eyes and Dean watched as his wings began to flicker—
Sam entered their other motel room in a huff, contemplated trashing the place in frustration, but settled for flopping down on one of the beds and turning on the TV. PBS was running yet another pledge drive, and he flipped through channels until one piqued his curiosity at the same time it made his stomach drop. Someone had created a TV show based on Lucifer. But it wasn’t the real Lucifer, the one who’d tortured him, driven him insane, and lived in his nightmares. It was a charming, dark-haired Lucifer with an engaging accent and an air of innocence about him.
“But it’s good?”
“This is all my fault,” Jack said softly. “You should have just let Lucifer take me.”
“I thought it was my grace weakening, no longer connected to the Host.”
Gabriel waved over his shoulder. “Instruct the young grasshopper and don’t judge.”
conversation,” Dean said. “With our mouths.”

“Yeah, I guess.” Dean stood up and went to the door.
“I told you,” four-year-old Dean said.
“Gross, Dean.” He gave Dean a disgusted look and turned back to his phone. “So get this: we’re not in our own universe.”
, compared to driving to one of the coasts. He followed Cas’ directions until they arrived at an industrial area just outside the city, with signs informing them that the state correctional facility was nearby and not to pick up any hitchhikers. Questioning the irony of Jack hiding somewhere near a prison, Dean looked for a place to park Baby that he deemed even a little bit safe.
“And now Lucifer’s on the loose and there’s a possibility he’s possessing the guy who’s just been named to the president’s cabinet as the Secretary of Angel Affairs. Meaning he’s the one who determines national policy about angels.”
“So you’re…” Jack squinted in concentration. “My uncle?”
“CJ?” Codi came over, putting her hand back on Cas’ arm, “Would you take a photo with me? I’d love to post it to Facebook! And Twitter! And Tumblr! You would make me so happy! So would you? Please?”
“I’ve been involved in many things, Dean. At any rate, I didn’t do much. Just reminded him that he had all he needed to defeat Goliath.”
Sure enough, Cas was sitting there, nursing a cup of coffee with a seemingly untouched plate of fruit in front of him. His trench coat was draped over the back of an empty chair, which Dean pulled out.
things in mind than talking,” Dean said, grabbing two beers out of the refrigerator. He turned around, froze, and dropped one of the bottles, which broke on the linoleum floor and splashed beer all over Dean’s shoes. “Shit!”
“What, you’re saying I need to hug it out with him?”
“Who wouldn’t be? In the space of a week, my entire life’s been turned upside down.”
“Dean, look at me.”
“Yeah. Had some of ‘em myself. You know, after Hell. Good news is that they eventually fade. Lose their power. Bad news is that they suck big time.”
“Samsquatch.”
“Is it another angel? Do you know him?”
“Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” The young woman looked like she wanted to disappear out of embarrassment. She handed the book over and covered her eyes. “I thought you were…and then I…I didn’t realize…”
“We have good news,” Cas said. “I know how you can replenish your soul.”
That voice was familiar. Calming.
Gabriel chuckled. “That almost got uncomfortable.”
“Dean.” Cas put himself directly in Dean’s path, stopping him with a hand to his arm, and stared into his eyes, trying to reach beyond Dean’s ego to his soul. “It is
“I talked to him right after Jack left. I thought he’d come back in the room, but…” Sam shrugged. “He’s thinking about staying, Cas. Not going back with us.”
“I’m sure it’ll be fine.”
“We’ll never know for sure,” Sam said, trying to breathe through the pain. “But my theory is something happened to Gwendolyn’s baby. Maybe it got sick really soon after birth or died of SIDS. And she got jealous of Constance for having a baby when her own had died. I think it made her a little crazy.”
“Not usable ones.”

“Uh…yeah. Sorry about that, Sam. My intentions were good. My method sucked.”
—didn’t determine who I was. Neither did she.” He looked at Michael. “This is the choice you’re talking about?”
Sam shook his head, ignoring the pain as best he could. “No.”
“I already accept him,” Castiel said. He hesitated to add the next part, but needed them to know. “I’m also growing weaker. It’s taken a lot of my grace to dream walk with you and I’m running low. In case I can’t stay, I know you can do this. You are the Dean I know and love.”
Cas huffed a laugh, one side of his mouth turning up in a smile. “Only fans call me CJ. Friends call me Cas. I was hoping we could be friends.”
“Yes. Beyond that. The memories that the flashbacks hold begin with ones that I’ve always remembered. Abraham almost sacrificing Isaac. Sodom and Gomorrah. Cain and Abel. But the parts that I didn’t remember were the…interventions. Finding myself in Naomi’s office. What she saw as my transgressions. I remembered these other things happening, but not my part in it. That was what she erased. Where I failed.”
Sam nodded. “Yeah.”
you. And, I’m sorry to tell you, but we cannot sell this brand if you are being…intimate with another man. And especially not when that other man is a thorn in the side of the book industry. He represents everything that is wrong in publishing.”
“Maybe I’ll steal a bite or two,” Cas said as he took Dean’s offered hand.
“I just want to hear what you prayed for, and if you think you got any response before now.”
“Found it,” Dean said, rubbing over that spot again.
“I don’t need to eat, Dean,” Castiel said, watching where the server had already strode into the kitchen.
“I’ll add that to my research,” Sam said, rolling his eyes as he continued on toward the van.
“Not ready for that conversation, yet, Cas. One problem at a time.”
The ink spot and bunker dissolved into complete darkness, and Castiel was anxious until he recognized the feel of the place. The Empty.
“I don’t know why. I just—” Dean took a shaky breath. “I’m no good with emotions. You know that. And sometimes they just take over and it’s like I’m not even in control anymore. I get angry, sometimes I lash out, or I bury it and pretend it never happened.”
“You’d be safe here,” Sam offered.
“Hell, yeah. Means we don’t have to worry about being here for a while, or having the van tracked.” He put the card back in the glove compartment and closed the door. “Too bad I have to hotwire it again.”
“Yes. Exactly.”
“Yeah?” Dean felt the tension in his own body as he climbed into the other side of the bed and slid under the covers. He could feel the heat from Cas’ body, the angel’s steady presence, calming and easing him simply by its proximity. Perhaps that was the effect he had on Cas, too, because Cas sighed contentedly as Dean lay down next to him.
He looked sharply at Gabriel.
“Like a Faraday cage,” Dean said, feeling hopeful.
Cas pulled away, his breath now coming in gasps. “I don’t…”
The foyer was empty. No Dean. He hurried upstairs. The hallway was clear of any gray mist, and all of the doors stood open. He went first to Demon Dean’s room, where he’d last seen everyone. It was empty, but instead of the rack and bloodstained floor, it held a queen-sized bed sitting atop a large, luxurious, white rug that covered most of the floor. The bedroom furniture was all whitewashed wood with blue accents. On the center of the thick, white, soft, faux-fur bedspread lay a single black crayon.
“Yeah, I know,” Tween Dean said. “Don’t admit it to anyone, right? Fake it till you make it?” He extended his hand and made a
“So this is where the party is!” Gabriel called out, somehow managing to saunter into the room. “Ready to play doctor again, Sammy?”
, Sam observed.
“I’m sure, Dean. He knows how I feel about it.”
Sam nodded finally. “How are you going to fix it?”
“No, Sam, actually
“You couldn’t have mentioned that earlier?”

“You don’t have to. We can stop.”
“Gavriel is the angel of strength to resist desires,” Michael said. “Self-restraint. His very name means ‘God is my strength.’”
“Look, Bela, there’s no deal right now. I met another author at FAWNcon and we were just brainstorming ideas about a crossover between our two series. That’s it. I don’t even know if we’re going to write it. And if we do, I’d go through all the proper channels.”
-looking trench coat that looked ridiculous over his blue sweater.
“You, Dean Winchester, are a man of many talents.”
“Well, let’s go.”
“He’s not an idiot,” Castiel warned. “And I can’t. He doesn’t feel the same way. In fact, I’m reasonably certain he’d be disgusted or scared away. I don’t want to risk what we have now.”
“I thought I was preventing harm to a child. Gabriel stopped me.”
“No, I have given up on prayer. Perhaps I am not very good at it. On those rare occasions it does yield results, they’re never the ones I want. But I was created more for worship than prayer.”
“Of course. Laundromats have those.”
“Okay. Anything else?”
Sam poured Dean a bowl of Lucky Charms, brought him milk and a glass, and hesitated before joining Castiel at the doorway. “You find out anything more?”
“But how are they gonna see it? How are they gonna get in here?”
Dean woke an hour later, deliciously warm and relaxed and sated. He opened his eyes to see Cas watching him from the other pillow. “You sleep at all?”
“When you choose life—and love—for yourself, you give others permission and an example to choose life and love for themselves. You have now before you life and death, blessing and curse.
Shrugging, Gabriel looked across the field. “I’m never going to earn his forgiveness. Which, you know, he can hate me all he wants. But I don’t have to put up with it.”
“Are you kidding me?” Dean said, irritated that Gabe would even consider asking such a question. “I think I know a lot about that. Righteous Man? ‘Play your roles?’ This ringing any bells?”
Dean started to speak, but Cas squeezed his arm in caution and shook his head.
“Calls him forth,” Cas finished. “Of course. On some level, all the parts must be minimally aware of what’s going on, enough that the appropriate part comes forth when needed.”
“You don’t know that, Dean. You know what I’ve done. Maybe these laws are exactly for angels like me. Maybe it
“I know you believe that you will die young, on the job,” Castiel continued, “but there’s no need to assume this is a certainty. You should consider your own health more seriously so that your body can support you as you age. Especially should I be unable to heal you in the future.”
“Old school, Deano. And you’re going to have to be the hands.” He wiggled his fingers. “These cuffs make things difficult.”
He’d uncovered portions of two coffins next to each with the wrong numbers, adjusted where he was digging, and hit pay dirt on the next coffin. Knowing he was close, he doubled his efforts, and in less than an hour, he had the coffin mostly uncovered. Taking up the pickaxe again, he cut through the rotted coffin lid, opening it wide enough to cover the bones with salt and gasoline. But just in case GJPD came around on patrol, or should security over at the Department of Energy complex see the fire, he packed up his tools first, getting ready to run for the SUV as soon as he lit up the grave.
The gun was nothing but doubt. An all-too-human twitch of his index finger, a badly-aimed shot, someone moving into his sights before he could abort the trigger pull—any of it could mean a loss of life that he never intended. And there had been so much loss already, some intended, some not. Some intended at the time but so deeply regretted later.
“Of course not.” Bela sounded affronted. “I have a private table. Come with me.”
Scowling, Sam narrowed his eyes.
Castiel shook his head and offered a tiny smile. “Stress relief.”
“No.” Dean grinned. “Never have, really.”
He rested his forearms on the table and played with his coffee cup. “Uh…” he said softly so no one else could hear. “Michael? I don’t know if you can hear me. Dean would be even more pissed if he knew I was talking to you, but I don’t know where else to turn. And, um…no offense, but you seem more like the kind of angel I grew up believing in than any that I’ve actually met. Like wanting to help and all. So… I could really use some guidance. Or advice. Or anything, really.”
“Do they realize that they’re not only killing the angels but also the vessel’s owner?” Castiel asked, anger clear in his voice.
Immediately, Sam recognized the beginning of a spell, the vial likely containing all the necessary ingredients. “No!” he shouted, starting toward her.
Dean’s tongue made a tentative swipe against his lips, and Castiel parted them slightly, his own tongue moving forward to meet Dean’s. He lost all ability to track their movements then, aware only of Dean’s mouth and tongue moving against his, of Dean being too far away. He reached out and splayed his hand behind Dean’s head, pulling him in closer, shifting his own vessel forward to minimize the amount of space between them. He could feel heat building between them, a fiery tightness that hummed across his skin and produced the most unusual sensations. Barely able to tell where his lips ended and Dean’s began, he chased Dean’s heat, seeking more. He felt Dean’s fingers in his hair, lightly scratching his scalp, then grabbing fistfuls and pulling Castiel’s head back so Dean could mouth against his jaw, his neck, over to his ear.
“Okay.” Sam took the bill and went up to the counter, ordering Izzy’s chai tea, and an Americano coffee and an egg and spinach wrap breakfast sandwich for himself. He paid and received a number to take back to the table.
“Is this the lead-in to a joke, Cas?”
“Nuh uh. What happened to your face?”
. Man, that was a trip. And now this…demon part. I know it’s not really a demon, but it’s easier to think of that way. That makes, what, seven?”
Castiel rushed to Dean’s side, crouching down next to the bed. “Dean. I would have come sooner if I could.”
“Cas, do we really have to have this conversation tonight?” Dean
At that moment, someone stealthily took the chair on the far right. Dean glanced over to see the guy from the bar. Cas. And he hadn’t bothered to change into more professional attire. Dean gave him a puzzled look and Cas raised an eyebrow in return.
“Oh…” Castiel partially extended the healing wing, feeling a dull ache where Dean had excised the bullets. “It’s continuing to heal. I’ll be able to hide them again soon.”
“I will tell you tomorrow,
Dean’s tongue probed at his lips, and when Castiel opened his mouth, Dean dove in, running his tongue over Castiel’s teeth and tongue and the roof of his mouth. Dean tilted his head and managed to deepen the kiss farther, groaning into while pressing his entire body into Castiel’s.
“I’d rather talk and walk. I was looking at a map of Minneapolis earlier. This street we’re on—Nicolet Mall—is pedestrian-only and goes almost to the river. I figure it’s about a half-hour walk to the river. What do you say? You want to walk with me?”
Sam was building a turkey sandwich with extra vegetables, some of which Gabriel was materializing out of thin air, when Dean strolled into the war room with a more-rumpled-than-usual Castiel.
“I don’t know how!” Gabe whined.
“No,” Castiel said, giving them all the signal to circle around Demon Dean.
“Mmm. And what time is your flight?”
“Three words, Castiel,” Gabriel said. “Home. Made. Cake. You don’t have to convince me.”
“Yeah. Go ahead.”
“No. You come in. It’s unlocked.”
“Okay. I’m going to bandage these like Kaye told me. If the hole that caused your lung to collapse is really small, it’ll heal on its own with rest. But if it’s too big for that, you

.” He kissed Castiel. “In
“We don’t have weeks, much less months,” Dean said. He started to ask Jack about his power when a painful twist in his abdomen caused him to wince and curl in on himself.
Dean broke off as Cas’ hand squeezed back. “Cas? You back with us? You had another flashback. You’re safe.”
“Hey, Cas.”
“And a half,” Dean added.
“Farmer Guy,” Dean said. “Who, as it turns out, is an angel.”
“No, nothing like that. Just a couple of cuts on my back. But I can’t reach them.”
“Be still, my cold, dead heart.” Crowley reached into his coat’s inside pocket and produced what looked like a large needle. “You’re going to need this.”
.” Castiel stood, soothing the inflicted headache with a bit of his grace, and checking to make sure he wasn’t too low. It might not be a bad idea to eat something, or sleep while Sam kept watch, if they were going to have to deal with a demon part. His grace was not up for this long-term.
“Dean… I would not ask you to assist me in rescuing all of the angels who have been…subjected to this. It’s impractical even for me to attempt it. But if we can find a way, perhaps a spell, to render the implants useless, and Gabriel and I can communicate this method to them, then we could free all of them.”
Michael smiled. “George Lucas listened to his guides too.” He returned his attention to Jack and raised his hand to shoulder height. “May I?”
“He’ll be fine until we get there, as long as you can make it there in the next hundred minutes or so.”
Jack shook his head emphatically. “No. I can’t be trusted with choice. I can’t… I’ve hurt too many people. I keep trying to do the right thing, and I keep hurting people. I don’t
“Hey, Sammy.”
“Biscuits?” Dean asked.
“Mmm, yes,” Gabe replied. “Definitely helps.”
Gabriel shrugged and shook his head.
“’Cause you always do, Cas. I mean, I thought you knew you were our family, but something comes up and you keep going back there. I can’t compete, man. And honestly, I’ve got nothin’ to offer you. I’m a broken hunter.”
Once he filtered out all the junk news asserting that non-Christians and anyone not of European descent were demonic non-humans who deserved to die, it was pretty quiet. He sent out a few emails to other hunter networks, just in case. He logged into his Facebook account, checked his privacy settings as he always did every time he logged in, making sure he wasn’t searchable or visible and that location was still disabled. Several paranormal investigation groups had a Facebook presence and sometimes Sam could pick out a real case among all the attention-whores. As he scrolled past the posts, one video post from a woman in Colorado caught his eye.
“Okay, Sam, that’s enough.” Dean held his hand up. “I don’t need to know any more.”
A chorus of ‘yes’ came from around the room.
Sam initially had his concerns set on the ragged holes in Gabe’s wings, but he was distracted by the angry red abrasions circling his wrists. Reaching down, rather than out, he gently took Gabriel’s hands in his, noting for the first time how delicate those wrists were. “Let me start with these,” he said. “I’ll grab our kit.”
?” The surprised look on Dean’s face was endearing.
“If it hadn’t been for Dean and me, you’d be dead right now. So a little gratitude in the form of help would go a long way.”
Dean was at a loss for words. Finally, he managed to say, “Now?
. The rest are for Dean.”
After the fourth fry Cas stole, Dean pushed the second plate across the table. “Just take the damn plate, Cas.”
“That’s it,” Raphael snapped. He turned on his heel and walked away.
A shaky breath. “Yes. I will be.”
Cas’ face was close—too close—his blue eyes too intense, and Dean felt trapped, a prey boxed in by a predator. “No. I want you to let life in again, in whatever form it needs to take for you.”
Gabe smiled but didn’t open his eyes. “Sam. How was your run?”
He wanted to close his eyes, pretend this wasn’t happening, pretend Dean couldn’t see how out of control he’d become, pretend he wasn’t disappointing Dean with his weakness, or worse, frightening him. But not knowing had its own form of anxiety, and it was always better to face fear head-on.
“What? I guess.”
or some suggestions of his own. But he remained silent. “I suppose,” he began, “my grace acts as a kind of barrier between all of those things you mentioned and my experiences. Were I still at full power, I doubt I would have these flashbacks. Perhaps it is because of my depleted grace that I am experiencing this at all. Or perhaps it’s because I’ve fallen before and had the experience of being completely human. At any rate, I’m not sure I know any techniques other than drawing upon my grace and simply making any intrusions cease to exist.”
“Your whole…” Gabriel waved his hand at Sam, “feeling just changed.”
Sam was shocked by what he saw.
“So, what do I owe this call to?” Jody asked. “If you’re not in trouble or dying. This something hunting related?”
He licked at Cas’ lips, felt them part almost immediately, and pressed his tongue further, finding Cas’ own, warm and strong, and humming with that electricity. Dean wasn’t sure if that was part of Cas’ grace, if Cas might lose it when he depleted his grace. If he was honest,
“Grab that gun and anything else important,” Gabe directed. “I’ll get Cas to the car. I can stop the bleeding manually, but those bullets are doing some damage.”
“One of two compounds that make up the scent of petrichor,” Cas confirmed with a nod.
“You want me to—”
“What did you notice?”
“That was…uh…” Dean began.
“Well, we’re not gonna get that from some Kansas farmer.” Dean hotwired the van again and pulled back onto the road, past the farmhouse and toward Lebanon.
“Aww, someone a little jealous? Is Dean not treating you right? Do I need to give him the big brother talk?”
“Maybe.” Sam shrugged. “Maybe not. Ready to go again?” At Castiel’s nod, Sam raised his hand. “Just notice.”
Carefully, Castiel relayed what happened, the spell, the different parts, then Castiel dream walking with him, only to find this house with all the doors. “I’ve met with the two younger Deans. One is four; the other is about nine.”
“But I have another idea,” Gabe offered. “And this one is more fun.”
“I tried.”
“Are you sure, Dean? I had hoped that one day we might move in together, but even I recognize this is exceedingly fast.”
“You know what? I’m—” Dean shook his head. “Let’s go, Cas.”
“Cas, no,” Dean warned as Cas reached his free hand out.
“Pamela Barnes,” the woman said with a broad smile. “I’m your moderator. Thanks for coming early. As I said in my last email, I’m not interested in any surprises. This panel was picked specifically to have someone from different aspects of publishing talk about what it’s like for them. I want to save the last half of the panel for questions from the audience. I’m sure we’ll have a lot.”
“Safer than you are right now. Here.” Gabriel held out a cup of water and a bendy straw. “This will help.”
“What’s that?”
"Pineal, Dean."
TRIVIA AND REFERENCES (in order of appearance)
Sam was quiet for a moment. “There might be a way around it.”
Castiel nodded. “Yes, the process was unpleasant.”
“Mm hmm,” Dean mumbled around a full mouth.
“Thought so.” Sam stood and made sure he left plenty of cash for their meals. “You suppose we can walk out of here without getting mobbed by fans of people who are not us?”
“Sure it does, Dean,” Sam argued. “You don’t think there are a million candles and airsprays and dryer sheets with ‘spring’ in the name?”
“And why would I want those? Nobody wants those. Sam keeps telling me to
“I… My wings. I don’t know why I thought about them. I remembered what it was like to fly. How it felt. And then my wings started to hurt.”
, Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean’s hips and pulled Dean into him with one strong movement.
A lopsided smile graced Cas’ mouth. “Actually, I’m not straight.”
Cas shrugged off his trench coat, avoiding Dean’s gaze.
Reasonably certain Dean was not asking what might be above them, Castiel proceeded with his initial intention. “I have tried to make amends for all I have put you through, all the ways I have harmed you, but I fear it may not be enough. And I may have hurt you even more recently. If there’s any chance at all of earning your forgiveness, please tell me what I need to do.”
needed. What do you suppose
“And what if we can’t agree?” Gabriel argued.
to clean up. Certainly not one
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Intimate? I know that they know they're, like, the only real part of an angel, not just their vessel.”
“What the hell is he doing here?”
“It’s not that bad,” Bela said. “I mean, yes, we do have to cut royalties across the board, what with the rising costs of paper and shipping. But that’s why we’re increasing the number of titles, to offset the reduction in royalties.”
Dean returned to the driver’s door, but watched as the uniformed man returned to Castiel, looking him up and down. He reached out, lifting one of Castiel’s long feathers with his hand, then clenching it in his fist and pulling upwards slowly until the feather snapped at the base. Castiel cried out but remained standing, head down, hands at his sides. The uniformed man nodded at the guardsman, then returned to his post as Dean climbed in the driver’s seat, gripping the steering wheel hard enough to hurt.
Silently, he brought his wings into the physical plane, lay back down on the bed so that he was facing Dean, his right wing comfortably behind him and resting on the bed. Slowly, he reached out his left wing, angled it so that it would cover all but Dean’s head, and rested it lightly over Dean’s body. He smiled at the profound sense of
“A lot of things, but… The other night, when he said what we believed about ourselves was keeping us stuck. Trapped. I think we’re starting to understand that. And he told me that what’s in our way
“And teen,” Tween Dean interrupted.
“These are all of them, I think,” Dean said, holding out a bunch of torn pieces. He sniffled again.
“Yes. I would have thought you’d have more to say about my arguing with the camel, especially when it insisted on speaking only ancient Akkadian.”
“Gabe, I’m not in the mood for—”
Dean leaned forward and met Cas’ lips with his own. There was an immediate spark, a tingle in his lips, as if Cas was covered in static electricity. He pulled away just enough to ask, “You doing anything with your grace right now?”
“Then you’re as much of an idiot as he is. I see the way he mother-hens you. That whole thing with you driving his precious car? That was about him being scared for
my powers.”
“Well, Cas did a really good job of hiding himself, and I think maybe it was someone else’s error on a website that was the problem. He’s a member of the Pacific Northwest Book Publishers Association as CJ Novak, which is fine. The only mailing address I can find for him in a general search is a post office box in Chicago, though it’s registered to a Celeste Middleton. I’m thinking maybe she’s someone he trusts and she sends his mail to him. But at one point, the PNBPA website had a residential mailing address listed for him in Bellingham, Washington, which is about two hours north of Seattle. The apartment number traces to a Balthazar Adler.”
Castiel nodded. “Go on.”
He had a sinking feeling that if the new Secretary of Angel Affairs was actually Lucifer riding a duped pro-civil-rights journalist, he could find a way to use the extra grace with truly terrifying consequences. Possibly, even Chuck and Amara couldn’t stop him, if they cared enough to come back.
sound, Deano,” Gabriel said. “Can’t do both until I get freed from all
At that, the tension was back, and Castiel pinned him with a steely look. “You mean when they take him to be executed.”
“Yeah.” Dean barked a short laugh. “Two broken hunters, two former angels, and a half-angel who can send us to the wrong universe but can’t float a pencil. Go team.”
Silently congratulating himself for remembering to plug his phone into the charger—and the charger into the wall outlet—Castiel made his way over to the far side of the bed. He carefully lay down on the edge, on top of the covers, trying to give Dean as much space as he might need.
like a hologram,” Gabe corrected. “A hologram is a three-dimensional image formed by the interference pattern of at least two light beams from a light source. A
“You called me brother,” Cas added, hoping to make some connection.
What they needed was a way to ask Dean questions so that they could get some answers. If he still had enough of his grace, he could simply
“What do you mean?”
Dean’s confusion deepened. “I thought…that time in the barn…”
“Okay, okay,” Dean grumbled, pushing himself up. “Let me just grab my stuff.” He threw his few toiletries into his duffel as Castiel redressed himself in the fleece jacket and scarf. Grabbing both duffels, Dean tossed the hotel key onto the desk, checked to make sure Cas was ready, and nodded his head toward the door.
“You could simply ask,” the stranger said with a slight smile as he brushed excess water off his arm.
“So maybe the president isn’t a demon,” Dean added. “Just a narcissist.”
“I talked to my attorney, yes. And I’ve thought about it. I’m not happy, Bela. You should know that. And if you screw with me again, that may be it for us. But for now, here you go.” He pulled the signed amendment out from his sport coat pocket and handed it to her. She tried to take it, but before he let go of the paper, he raised his eyebrows and added, “Don’t screw with me, Bela.”
“They’re already feeling better.”
“Ice keem! Spinkuhs!”
As Gabriel sat down, Sam turned on the water and adjusted the temperature. “If it’s too cold or too hot, let me know. I’m starting with the temperature I usually use.”
Gabriel tried manipulating the tool into the hole in the cuffs and nearly dropped it before Cas grabbed it out of his hands, and deftly inserted it into the lock. With a loud click, the cuffs opened and clanged to the floor. Exhaling loudly, Gabriel rubbed his wrists where they were raw and abraded, then turned his back to Cas with an air of impatience. “Get ‘em off, Castiel. Please.”
“Cas! Castiel!”
Dean shrugged. “Can’t complain.”
Still, he began a mental list of what Dean’s soulmate must be like. Female, of course. Athletic. Aware of the supernatural. Familiar with hunters, and possibly able to hunt as well. Strong enough to keep Dean in line when he inevitably got stuck in his way of thinking. Someone who knew when Dean needed to be told what to do and when he needed to take the lead. Someone who understood his moods, his wounds. Someone who enjoyed cheeseburgers and beer. Someone who would never, ever leave.
“When, Gabriel? When is the execution set?”
“In what world,” Cas said, coming back while securing the top of the container, “is colored gelatin considered a salad ingredient?”
“What are you saying, Cas? You’re however millennia old and you need help operating a shower?”
“I get it, Gabriel. I do. Sometimes you just know. It doesn’t matter what your eyes tell you.”
“Your choice. Count of three or I make the choice for you.”
Dean thought about that. “No. I didn’t give him any of Bela’s information.” He snapped his fingers. “But Cas said the most recent copy of my book was missing too. My acknowledgments page thanks Bela as my editor.” He groaned. “And Crowley as my agent. Shit.”
The connection was broken as Dean ripped his hand away. “Get out!”
Cas had assured him that the electromagnetic pulse would disable all the law enforcement vehicles’ computer-controlled engines, their radios, cell phones, and any other electronic equipment long enough for them to get away. By the time the cops’ radios or cell phones could connect again, and they could call for backup, the Impala would be out of traffic camera range, lost somewhere in a hundred thousand acres of farmland.
.” At Dean’s blank look, he added, “Samurai swordsmanship.”
Dean sat, looking dejected. “Can… Can we spend some time together? If I’m gonna go off to my not-death shortly, don’t I get, like, a last meal or something?”
“I wasn’t aware you wanted a show. I can indeed handle a knife like normal people.”
“I understand. I don’t agree, but I understand.” Cas rested his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “You going to the keynote address?”
“So do I.” Castiel raised his hand to trace the contours of Dean’s face. The laugh lines next to his eyes. The perfect cheekbones. Those lips that had entranced Castiel for years. Dean’s eyes shimmered with tears to which Dean would never admit, and Castiel gently caressed beneath Dean’s eyes with his thumbs, trying to say
“I do. And you’ve never felt anything that soft since?”
Cas took a step closer, narrowing his eyes. “I know how to drive, Dean. Your car is
“Like a hologram,” Dean finished.
“Love has the highest vibrational frequency,” Michael corrected. “By itself, however, it has no power. It must be chosen. Is there power in being commanded to love? Forced to love?
“Who said that?”
This was one of those times he wished he could still call up Bobby. Bobby would have had some sage advice that would be obvious in its simplicity, and Dean would be ready to call himself an ‘idjit’ for not thinking of it first. But no sage advice popped into his brain, and he knew of no telephone that could reach Bobby in Heaven.
“You should try the cake,” another voice sang out from behind the bakery display. “Angel food. I’ve been perfecting it for
him, Sam. I set some boundaries. That’s a good thing.”
. Who the hell expects
“Getting your
“How does he just disappear without flapping out of here?” Dean asked. “Is this what teleportation in this universe is like?”
Sam tried to put himself back into what he remembered of his childhood. A lot had happened since then. Things this Dean wouldn’t know about. “How long’s Dad been gone this time?” he asked.
“Any change?” Sam asked. It had been a couple-hour drive back to the bunker, and Dean hadn’t stirred once. Cas had laid Dean down in his bed, going to obvious pains to try and make Dean comfortable.
“I need to go back, Sam. I need to know what he was going to say.”
“Angels don’t have halos?” Mary asked.
“I think Dean’s concern,” Sam said, “is that it’s based on human brain science. I don’t know how it would affect angels. I mean, your memories aren’t exactly stored in your vessel’s brain, right?”
“Has anyone ever cleaned your wings before?” Sam asked without thinking.
helped.”
“Same.”
“Oh. You don’t have to, you know.”
“I think I need something new.”
“We’ll keep the movie volume low, so as not to offend your sensitive ears.”
“What war?” Jess asked at the same time Sam asked, “Against whom?”
“Eh.” Gabriel shrugged. “It would be impolite to turn him down.” He followed the man—Lot—into the city, and gestured for Castiel to catch up.
Taking the crayon gently, Dean sat up, his Adam’s apple jumping with the effort of holding back more sobs.
“It was taken!” Castiel shouted. “I didn’t
Gabriel gave him a sad smile, cut off a piece of the cake, and held it out. “Open up.”
“What if he’s scary?” nine-year-old Dean asked.
after that.”
Castiel felt one side of his mouth turn up in a smile. “Your double entendres aside, I don’t know how to answer what happens to you, except that I know you don’t go away or die. You become
“At least I’m still fighting on the side of good,” Castiel shot back. “You’re fighting on the side of Gabriel.”
Sam let out a long sigh and wished he had his laptop with him. His phone was going to have to do.
“And you, Cas?” Lover Dean asked. “Can you accept him? Even if he wants to kill you more than us?”
“Planes? Not airplanes, though, right?”
“I hear he’s demanding,” Tessa said.
“He’s going to be okay, though, right?” Finally, the onramp to I-35E southbound was in view. If he could get them out of the city before the cops could scramble helicopters and get other departments involved, they had a chance.
“Dean,” Castiel said, watching Dean retreat toward the bedrooms.
He allowed Dean to peel the coat off, followed by his suit coat. Fingers at his tie, Dean kissed him again while loosening it.
Back inside, Gabriel made a disgusted face. “You ready to be done with this?”
“Mate?” Dean repeated, a red tinge standing out on his face.
“Sam,” Castiel said as he came into the library, “I know I have done indescribable harm to you over the years, and I have tried to do what I can to make it right, but I’m concerned I’ve done more harm than I’m unaware of. If so, please tell me so I can make amends.”
“My apologies, Dean. What are you regretting?”
“What now?” Sam asked. “What can we do to help?”
“I’m saying this guy’s got a threat hanging over him and it’s not going away anytime soon. You sure you’re up for this?”
“You drove my—?” No, he was definitely scared of the answer. “You drove
“Um...” Sam laughed shortly. “Cas lives here.”
inside of your body. Like reaching in to touch your soul.”
As he sat in a chair in the library, with Sam across from him and Dean getting comfortable next to him again, he tried to clear his mind for this session.
Dean reached forward and ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair, the motion sending a shudder through Castiel’s body. “I’m not sorry. I’m glad. You got my card?”
“Awesome,” Dean said. “But I’m starving. You want to share it during or after waffles?” He looked around the kitchen again. “Babe? Where’d you put the waffle iron?” He suddenly perked up when he looked at the metal shelving rack just beyond where Mary was sitting. “Never mind!”
him. I saw your reaction.”
“A coworker offered to take them for the night.” Barb ducked her head, looking embarrassed. “I told her about what was going on after she found me falling asleep on break. I work at the Walmart about three miles from here. I can’t take this anymore: the crying, the nightmares, feeling helpless. I don’t trust people easily.”
“Like you haven’t? Or Sam?” Bobby snorted. “You know he’s sorry. Hell, even I know he’s sorry. He’s learned from it. So have you.”
“Uh…” Sam double-checked the information before he continued. “It’s owned by a trust, but only the widow lives there.” He opened a new tab and searched death records. “See? Guy died ten years ago. And he was in his seventies.”
The orders were simple enough.
, as you call it, removed memories, feelings, experiences. A clean, cold, unfeeling slate on which to write new orders.”
“What do you want me to do?” Cas asked.
Cas looked away. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Okay.” Dean yawned. “Well, I think we can do this tonight. See how far we get.”
“None of that, Dean. I want to hear it all,” Cas growled in his ear.
“Oh.”
Dean returned the kiss, then cupped his face and rested his forehead against Castiel’s. “Go, before I have my way with you again.”
“Ignore him,” Sam said, raising his hand again. “Just notice.”
“TMI, Gabe,” Dean warned.
“Fine. I’ll order two cheeseburgers with fries and you can steal half off my plate.” He stood and held a hand out to Cas to help him up.
“Yeah, well, vulnerability isn’t high on my list of things to be,” Hunter Dean said. “It’s right after
“Dean, you can’t hurt me,” Cas said, watching Dean’s hands with undisguised interest. “My grace will—” He stopped abruptly, his eyes going wide.
“All right. Let me see this hole.”
“No. It’s… what you say? On the house.”
“Hi everyone, my name is Krissy Chambers, and my first novel is called
“I don’t know. It’s a lot to process right now.”
“Well, they wouldn’t know a good angel if he stabbed them in the ass,” Dean said as he plated his food and brought it over to the table. “You always try to do the right thing, even if the methods…”
Cas reached forward, then sat back with a spiral notebook in his hand. “I’m going to take some notes. These won’t leave my possession.”
“You might as well leave, Cas. I’m not gonna be here much longer.”
“Do you remember what I said about my grace? How it creates a barrier and keeps emotions at a distance from us? How angels don’t experience trauma because of their grace?”
“I can do some more research,” Sam offered.
Gabriel held his cuffed hands up. “No mind reading here. It’s written all over your face. Besides, you said you had questions earlier.”
“Someone you met?”
The angel gave a warm smile this time. “You’re looking with the wrong sight, Gabriel.”
“Are you declaring a thumb war with me, Cas?”
“Did you have someone you wanted me to see for this?” Castiel asked, not really liking the idea of walking into another office and subjecting himself to another
Gabriel snorted and examined the ceiling. “Don’t go assigning me too many emotions, Sam.”
“About?” Dean asked as he raised his eyebrows.
“And where do you stand on religion, Cas?”
With barely a nod to Jonathan, he flew to Naomi’s office to find her waiting for him. With her drill. He bowed his head in shame.
“It’s my pleasure. I’m Isobel Roth, but you can call me Izzy.” She smiled, revealing matching dimples on her cheeks and laugh lines around her brown eyes. Her dark brown hair was past her shoulders and hung in tight curls that miraculously didn’t frizz in the dry winter air. Sam nearly asked what she used for hair product when she pulled a portfolio out from her large tote bag and set it down in front of her, then asked, “Would you like to get something to eat or drink before I give you the lowdown?”
“I did, for a while.”
laws. I just…I think we need a plan.”
“I’m not takin’ that chance, Cas. You deserve to be happy. You don’t need that threat hanging over your head forever. And I really hope you know by now that we don’t want you around just ‘cause of your grace.”
“Badass, Cas,” Dean finished. “Just like you. And I, uh… I kinda like seeing you with ’em.”
“Come on!” Dean tugged harder and Castiel allowed himself to be pulled along.
“Good.” Cas devoured the rest of the pineapple chunk and stabbed a cantaloupe cube with his fork. “Then we make a plan.”
“So check this out,” Sam began, his finger moving on the touchpad. “The new law allows state government to hold their own executions, as laid out by the law. Some states have filed lawsuits because they don’t allow the death penalty, but opponents are arguing that this only applies to humans, not angels. There’ve been three states so far that have held executions: Texas, Oklahoma, and California, all of them today. And get this: there were signs of demonic activity just before every case where an angel was turned in under this law.”
“Want to what? You’re killin’ me here.”
“I don’t think he is,” Castiel said. “I’m going to go speak to him.”
“And the art,” Sam continued, remembering some of the things he’d seen. “Really talented artists putting you guys in some compromising positions. Graphic positions.”
“Sam is looking after him. I promise. And you’re in a very safe place.”
“No.” Michael shook his head. “You have power now. Those times you were thinking about? You
And damn, if that didn’t get things going again. “Okay. Yeah. Do it.”
“I think mostly they’re just there to make sure the patient is safe, keep them grounded, and avoid making the trauma worse. EMDR can bring up a lot of old stuff and it can lead to a crisis if not handled correctly.”
“Castiel! Come in.” Gabriel welcomed him in with a flourish, and Castiel immediately noticed that Gabriel’s wings were no longer visible in the physical plane.
“Okay.” Sam picked up his pad and pen. “What’s the new image?”
“Me? Why?”
“Uh…yeah. I can take the couch,” he said, nodding toward the green couch in the corner. It wasn’t particularly comfortable, but with what Cas was going through, he could have the memory foam for a night.
“You were sent with a simple message, Castiel,” Naomi said. “Remind the man Cain that his offering was inadequate, and to correct his careless ways. That was all.”
“I told you the truth, Dean. I can’t turn off neural input from them. And the undersides are more sensitive. It’s not that they’re erogenous zones, but rather that when the feelings are pleasurable, I feel that pleasure everywhere.”
Cas sat leaned back in his chair in the war room, one hand gripping the arm so tightly that his knuckles were white, the other waving around wildly, nearly knocking Sam across the room.
“That
“Why should I?”
Castiel chaperoned her through to the war room, where she went over to give Sam a hug as well.
“Dean,” Castiel said, getting up to go to him.
“That’s not an answer.” Dean guided the Impala onto another highway headed west.
“Okay.” Dean shrugged.
“You don’t need my permission,” Michael said.
“He ever lie to you?” Hunter Dean asked.
” Dean demanded.
“Those two and two others.”

“Nice to see you getting out, Cassie,” Balthazar said. “Although maybe hang out with humans who
“I think what Dean’s trying to say,” Sam jumped in, “is that family has always been in your way. It’s what you’ve been avoiding. If what Michael said is true, then
Dean shrugged. “I guess.”
“You really think I’m gonna judge you based on what your wings look like? After
“And a half.”
“When you find it, let me know,” Dean said. “I’d pay money to see that. Well, someone else’s money, but still…”
He wondered which debut author Cas had chosen, but decided it didn’t matter. They’d spent several hours talking the night before, making it all the way down to the river and back, and while they didn’t agree on everything, Cas’ perspective was unique and his passion was inspiring. It was nice, for once, to be appreciated not for what he could do for someone else, but just for who he was.
“How do you know, Cas?” Dean pressed. “I mean, you could’ve figured out free will on your own.”
“You won’t regret this, sweetheart. I’m already working on getting you your own publicist. I’ll look forward to your next manuscript.” She pivoted on her stiletto heel and sauntered away.
Gabe giggled and ran off.
“Yeah,” Sam agreed. “I’m worried.”
“And then you told him to stay on his side.”
“And this is Gabriel,” Sam said, rubbing Gabe’s chin with one finger.
“Excellent.” Sam raised his hand. “Just notice.”
Castiel managed to slow his breathing. “Angels don’t have foreplay. Neither do they mate. Not in our true form. It’s both attractive and repulsive for angels to take a vessel, to consider experiencing human sexuality. We are not to even try. The vessels are not ours, simply on loan, and even if the soul gave their permission, it’s a gray area.”
Dean found the laptop in the library. He figured he’d queue up the movie before he got back in his room, just to have it ready to go, but first he had to exit out of all the browser tabs Sam had open. One caught his attention:
“I think that is all we can do for now, yes.” Cas picked Dean up in a fireman's carry. He may not have much of his grace left, but Sam was grateful that Cas was still more powerful than the average human, or even the average hunter.
Dean got a beer out of the fridge and had downed a few swallows before he remembered he still had half a bottle in the rec room. He wandered back to the TV, turned it on, realized he hadn’t been paying attention to the game after all, and thumbed the remote’s off button before tossing the remote back on the sofa. Sitting down heavily, he drank some more, just focusing on the feeling of the cool liquid as it coated his throat. His mind wandered back to Bobby, to Ellen, even to John, anyone who could give him some direction on what to do next.
was not a sexy sound, and Dean jostled Cas with his shoulder, trying to wake him.
“What do you mean, reports?” asked Dean.
“When you come back, we can go next door to the diner,” Dean said, not meeting his gaze.
“Free will changed some of my grace into a soul. It’s the only explanation.”
“He did. I think he also bought out the store’s supply of Lucky Charms.” Castiel tiled his head in confusion. “Why?”
“D—Dean…” Castiel said softly in a tone Dean had never heard before.
“Dean.”
“Can I
Castiel took another long breath like the ones after each set. “Yes. I can do this.”
“Shut up.”
“We, Cas and I,” Sam motioned between them, “think that there may be some other people who need help, and they might be right outside your—our—motel room door. Maybe even a young child. I know you can’t leave me alone to go check it out, but maybe keep an ear out? Let us know what you hear?”
“Why would I do that?”
“I don’t know, Sam. Okay? I don’t know.” Dean looked away as he ground his teeth. “Fine. Call him. But I’m still not giving him anything.”
As in Egypt?”
Traffic slowed to a crawl just outside of Sioux City, Iowa, and Dean tried to take a detour across the Missouri River, only to find that traffic was backed up here too, just this side of the river.
Dean laughed. “All right. Well, let’s celebrate freedom for both of us. I got pie.”
“Not my dad? Or Bobby? Sam’s wife and kids?”
“I’d kinda like to kiss you now,” Dean said.
“Yeah, of course.” Barb quickly went across the hall and opened the door, gesturing him inside while looking at the floor.
He crawled up Castiel’s body and leaned down to kiss him again, and everywhere that skin met skin, Castiel was certain there were visible sparks. Dean began to explore his wings then, fingers digging into the feathers and combing through them, kissing the arches when Castiel raised them to brush along Dean’s arms.
“I will need to report this,” Raphael warned.
“Your brother loves you, Cain.”
Dean looked away. He couldn’t bear to see Cas’ reaction. Dude was an angel, even if most of Heaven hated him. He never really belonged here. “Unless you don’t want to stay.”
“I vowed to keep you safe,” Cas said, barely above a whisper. “To protect you. But I can’t even do that anymore.”
Dean struggled, grunting and bellowing, and Castiel had to keep adjusting his hold, tapping into his grace to keep up with Dean’s strength and flexibility. “I’ll finish you off, Sam,” Dean yelled. “I’ll find that hammer and finish what I started!”
“What, what?” Sam returned.
Dean let out a carefully controlled breath. “Fine. I don’t know. Giver?”
“Yes, well, good luck with this one,” Crowley said, backing out of Dean’s room and chuckling. “Call me if you want a date, Dean. Offer’s still open.” With a grin on his face, he disappeared.
Suicidal Dean nodded. “I know how to help him. I know his weakness.”
He was about to clean the upper wound in the second wing when the lights all came back on, followed a few minutes later by a loud knocking at the bathroom entrance.
“Gabriel!” he called out, jogging over toward him.
“Gabee-el!” Gabe shouted from the back seat.
You are the best thing to happen to me, and I can never thank you enough for this weekend.
“Get these cuffs off me and this implant out, and I’d be happy to show you where you’re wrong.” Gabe scooted closer and rested his arms awkwardly on the seat back. “You know where my name comes from?”
Gabriel looked at Dean for a long moment, then turned his attention to Cas. “You okay, Castiel?”
“Are you sure…?”
“My condolences.”
“I never forgot it, if that’s what you’re saying. But I haven’t thought about it in a long time either.”
“I’d rather hear from Dean.”
“No!” Dean crossed his arms over his chest and slouched in his chair.
“So, do I just pin this up?” he asked as he stood up from the desk.
“I’ll stop teasing. Come on. I’ve got snacks. One of the best movies ever made. And a shoulder to rest on. You being all the way over there feels weird.”
“Good. Well… Sam, do you want to explain it?”
“Six,” Dean said, packing the two covered pies he’d baked into a shallow basket with plenty of cushioning. “They’re about forty-five minutes away, so we need to leave as soon as possible.” He carried the basket out to the Impala, checked to make sure the car cover was still over Cas’ old beater in the carport, and came back, expecting Cas to be ready to go. He wasn’t.
. I never forsook my mission.” He glanced around, from the cosmic entity to Naomi, Metatron to Chuck. “I am
Once Cas was safely seated in the passenger seat of the Impala, Dean relaxed a bit. One challenge down. Next: get Cas home and figure out what the hell happened. He looked at Sam. “You good to drive the truck?”
“Right. Dean also says you agreed to let me do what I can to help.”
He kept the kisses cautious at first, but when he felt Cas’ hand cup the side of his head, he tried an experimental lick. Almost immediately, Cas opened and pulled him even closer, crushing their mouths together and teasing Dean’s tongue with his own. Dean felt the tension in his shoulders give way completely as he held Cas close, the knots in his abdomen spark into something exciting and light, and the ache in his chest swell until reality slipped away and all of his senses were filled with Cas.
“So, like, maybe
“Why didn’t you catch this when I first got the contract?” Dean wanted to know.
The rest of the table attendees introduced themselves, revealing about half authors and half fans. The other authors were respectful toward Dean, but were overflowing with questions and praise for Cas.
Now that he’d mentioned it, Dean noticed Sam was wearing his running shorts and a sweaty t-shirt. He poured himself a cup of coffee and drank half of it, eyes closed, before he allowed himself to think, speak, or notice anything else. Caffeine bolus started, he shifted into breakfast mode, digging out eggs and bacon from the fridge.
“I don’t know,” Castiel replied honestly. “He’s not… He can’t be. It’s a part.”
only to lose her. Again. It being her choice only twisted the knife in deeper. The rejection was palpable. So that was it. Just give up, knowing she was in harm’s way, in another universe. And it wasn’t like there was a revolving door to go visit her. Jack was powerful, but lacked finesse. Aiming for Lebanon, Kansas and winding up in New Lebanon…
him but
“I saw you from the house,” the stranger said. “Perhaps you are lost? I can help with directions.”
Castiel licked his lips. “And what happens if they’re turned in?”
“It’s a movie. It’s to enjoy, not pick apart for inaccuracies.”
. My best friend is a real, live angel, with actual wings. That makes me one hell of a lucky man. But I don’t want to—”
Dean chuckled and shrugged one shoulder. “I kinda was. Wait, why would he think that?”
“Because I can.”
wings, and who
“We’ll make a plan,” Dean assured him. “
Gabriel glared at him. “You just wait. Karma’s a bitch.”
Dean chewed his lip in thought. “Okay, how about we just kinda hang out on the bed and watch something? And if you fall asleep…” Dean couldn’t help the grin. “I’ll watch over you.”
“I’m here.” The angel’s voice came from the back of the office building, as if he’d been leaning against the wall, watching them all this time.
“And my characters get to take him down?” Dean asked.
“I brought you some Hot Pockets.” He pointed to the dish on Dean’s desk. “They might be cold now, but I could heat them up. Or—” he broke off as Dean nearly leaped off the bed and started stuffing Hot Pockets into his mouth. “You could just eat them. Okay… So Cas and I are going to go talk for a few minutes while you eat. We won’t leave the building.”
The royalty rates that Sam goes over with Dean—earning between ninety cents and two dollars and fifty cents per book at his old royalty rates—are absolutely true, based on current typical royalty percentages in the traditional publishing market and current book prices. The breakdown is this:
“Yes.”
“Okay, first,” Dean interrupted, holding up one finger. “Do not
“Yeah. You’re safe. You okay if I sit back down? The floor is hell on my knees.”
Cas chuckled. “Time for the other side, Dean. I need you to roll over.”
“How do you cash a page?” Dean asked.
“Hands off my ass!” Dean growled, bumping into Sam’s side as he twisted away from an overeager fan.
Dean looked away and visibly swallowed. “Yeah. It just clearly isn’t me.”
“They don’t have high tea in the Pleiades,” Cas said.
Dean returned to eating, not sure why that exchange left a tingling warmth spreading through his chest and into his shoulders and upper arms, little sparks of light and something else unidentifiable gently vibrating under his skin.
Finally Castiel let out a soft sigh and opened his eyes, looking suddenly shy and anywhere but at Dean. He seemed to start to roll his shoulders and then slowly both wings extended out to the side, feathers rustling as he tried to navigate them around furniture.
“Emotions affect us all that way, champ,” Gabriel said. “We’re not unemotional because we don’t care. We’re unemotional because we could destroy the world a few times over if we get too excited. Catch my drift?”
Castiel wanted to explain, but the need for Dean’s forgiveness was like that one feather that was out of place, twisted just the wrong way, and he was unable to concentrate on anything else. He had to make this right. “It would be easier for me to explain if I knew how to earn your forgiveness.”
“When in fact, the very opposite is true, Dean. I perhaps care too much.”
“C’mon over here. I’m not gonna bite.” Dean paused. “Unless you’re into that sort of thing.”
“Dean.” Castiel waited for Dean to put the lasagna pan in the oven and check the dials.
“Then you missed what I said about it. That handout was a list of
As Sam moved his hand slowly, barely shifting side to side, Castiel repeated the affirmation to himself, then had the thought that
“I feel like I might need to.”
time, Gabriel,” Castiel said, breaking his silence. “And I had a very good reason. It wasn’t an indulgence so much as a very poor attempt at escape.”
Gabriel paused, looking bashful for a moment. “Remember that promise I made you?”
“Oh, come on, Castiel. You’ve got a fraction of your grace, and everyone upstairs wants you dead. Go back to your playmates and leave Heaven to the real angels.”
help, so you can stop following us around.”
Meg moved on to another one of the panelists, Marv Simon, who was also published by a big New York house, and who insisted that an author’s job is to set up interesting characters and see where they lead, not publish. “Everybody needs to play their part,” he said. He clearly held Cas in disdain, calling self-publishers ‘wannabe authors’ and ‘writers who weren’t good enough to be published by a real publisher.’
“Yep! Gosh, I’m not sure how I’m going to do this in one sentence, except I’m really good with conjunctions—have that whole
After gathering up his belongings and equipment, he jogged back across Highway 50 to his motel room. From the nearly empty parking lot, he figured he was likely the only guest. He tossed his gear on the bed and started a cup of instant coffee, then plugged the recorder into his laptop and launched an app. The coffee finished brewing while the app initialized, and he imported the recording, allowing him to see a visual representation of any sound captured, which would save him from having to listen to long periods of silence.
“Right, but if you
Sam nodded. “Lung’s better.”
Nodding again, Castiel settled against Dean’s side, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder. He relaxed into the half-embrace, his inner tumult easing a little and giving way to an unfamiliar fatigue. Allowing himself to get lost in the story, he didn’t speak again until the Ark of the Covenant was revealed. “That is not what the Ark looked like.”
versions? What the hell, Cas?”
“Apologies,” Castiel mumbled, not altering his gaze from Dean’s. “Thank you for your assistance.”
“No, you’re fine.”
“He’s worried about Cas and taking it out on everyone.”
had to clean up.”
“Yeah. You sayin’ you don’t trust me?”
“Hm?” Cas didn’t open his eyes, as if he was drifting off to sleep.
“I don’t need that image in my head, Gabe,” Sam warned.
“I don’t know, Sam. I’m not the one playing psychologist here.”
“What do you mean?” Dean’s confusion was clearly sincere, and somehow that gave Castiel a warm feeling.
the series name, or that their right to use the series name survives termination of the contract.”
The panel went quickly, with questions ranging from “Do I have to finish my book before I try to find an agent?” to “What’s the point of having a publisher these days when you can get your work directly out to your readers?” Dean was exhausted at the end, a dull headache starting to pound behind his eyes. He felt a little defensive, as if traditional publishing was being put on trial and he was its sole defender.
“Your mother,” Sam spat out. “She went after Cas and got Dean instead.”
“Yeah. Uh…whatever, um…whatever you decide to do about it, if anything…or nothing…you know, I’ll, um…I’ll support it.”
“Not like that’s a Winchester trait,” Gabe observed. “But I’m sticking to this. You get him to say yes, I’ll see what I can do. Otherwise, hands off.”
way of seeing the world. I’m just a hick from the Kansas countryside, and an introvert to boot. I don’t see that social media strategy working for me.”
Dumah scoffed. “I don’t need to locate him. I already know where he is. We’ve been keeping track of him, which is more than I can say for any of you.” She glanced at Dean and Sam. “I’ve no idea why he considers you his parents. You’re negligent at best.”
A few taps on his phone later, he knew that Manhattan, Kansas, had no fewer than two dozen churches, a synagogue, and a mosque. And a university with a renowned religious studies professor in their philosophy department. At only two-and-a-half hours away, he could do this and be back by nightfall.
Opening his eyes, Gabriel grinned. “You gave me a happy ending in more ways than one, Sammoose. The implant’s toast.”
“Yeah, I could use some food too,” Sam said, already tapping on his phone. “There’s a mall up ahead on the outskirts of Richmond, just across the Indiana border. Could switch plates there as well.”
“And then he’ll just take you,” Dean added, hoping to hurry along the decision-making process.
He saw Cas’ truck parked at an angle in some sort of pull-out off the highway, but it looked empty. Even pulling up alongside it, he could see no movement inside. “Dammit, Cas, where are you?” he muttered.
“I didn’t lie to you about needing your grace.”
“Yes, he is,” Castiel agreed. “I will go talk to the other one and return shortly.”
He’d convinced Cas to hand over the truck keys to Mary, giving her an excuse about Cas still recovering, and not caring if she believed him or not. Her look was more
her in that world? With
“You, angel, you can be my first.” Demon Dean licked his lips in a gross parody of Lover Dean’s. “Your wings are already damaged. You won’t mind if I pull all the feathers out, peel off all the skin, and break all the bones, will you? Then I’ll cut them off before I start on the rest of your body.”
. “How’re we gonna get him into the right place? If he’s that powerful, maybe he’ll sniff out the holy oil or something.” He turned to Cas. “Can you guys do that?”
“If I initiate it, then yes, Cas, you can take that as consent to respond in kind. And I guess—I mean, you
As Dean made his way through waffles and bacon and eggs, and Cas toyed with a bowl of fruit and a cup of plain yogurt, Dean thought about bringing up the one topic they hadn’t yet broached.
“A bit. I’m not trained in it or anything, but I learned about it during a CNA clinical program I did recently in a psychiatric care unit.”
“Four.”
“He’s…all energy. Though we perceive him as solid.”
“I’m gonna pack up,” Dean informed them as he hefted the cooler. “We can stop by the gas station and refuel Baby and the snack stash.”
“So’s my bladder. And it’s winning.”
Scoffing, Demon Dean turned on nine-year-old Dean. “Yeah, I heard your pathetic prayers. No one’s coming for you. No one ever will.”
“Yeah, we could use the help,” Dean agreed.
“But I realize that was wrong. Free will isn’t just doing whatever we want to do. It’s making educated decisions. Responding, not reacting. When I didn’t involve you, I wasn’t making fully informed choices. Jack is still a child, even if his vessel—his body—is grown. It’s my responsibility as a parent, as his guardian, to teach him how to make informed choices. How to take many perspectives into consideration and only then make a choice.”
The stranger nodded once and was silent for a moment. “I can see I need to convince you another way. I
“Exactly. This is like the planes. The physical plane would be the skin, the outermost covering. What you’d see with your eyes. The etheric plane is the next page, the one you’d see when you peel the skin page away.”
“What did he say?”
“Good at this, Cas,” he mumbled.
The young woman smiled grimly and led him to a small living area. “Barb, please.” She cleared an armful of toys off a worn, lumpy sofa and gestured hesitantly. “Sit. Can I get you anything to drink? Eat?”
That time it was familiar. Sam opened his eyes to see a pair of golden irises only inches from his own.
be released. We have plans for him. This one?” He indicated Jonathan. “Expendable. You will
“I think the question is more whether you’re up to asking them,” Gabriel replied.
Dean managed to cover his mouth before he spit out his beer. Swallowing hastily, he choked a bit before answering. “No!”
“After doing EMDR, you guys watch a movie in your room, right?”
“I—” Castiel felt himself slump as if defeated. “No. My truck doesn’t have anything to play it on.”
“The only pain is of his own doing,” Michael said. “This is not punishment. It’s entirely the opposite. You will understand too.” He looked around the group. “All of you. What you believe about yourselves is keeping you trapped. The only way to free yourselves is to face it. This is what you must do. This is the only way I can help. It begins now.”
“That was
“What’s going on Gabriel?”
Castiel felt a plunging disappointment, and he wished his wings still worked so he could leave this conversation before it became any more painful. “Yes. You have.”
“I’m sensing a theme here. But I’m still…I’m afraid of what I’d do if I had a lot of power.”
“You want to dig around in my head? You know I don’t like that, Cas.”
, of joy and freedom and reverence. For several bites, he felt childish, incompetent, and something about allowing himself to be fed this way—about allowing Gabriel to
“Home would be nice,” Sam said. “But before you go pick up your ring, can I talk to you for a minute?”
“Weird doesn’t even begin to describe what I’ve seen.”
happen? When Michael touched you?”
“I don’t want to infringe on your bro time.”
don’t have to do anything about it. But I wanted you to know.”
“Also impervious to angel grace,” Crowley supplied. “Quite proud of that.”
“You’re shittin’ me,” Dean said. “That’s like twelve hours. Did you stop for gas?”
“Right,” Dean grumbled, getting to his feet and punching off the TV. “I’m gonna thank you for some brain-eating amoeba.”
“Checkpoints?” Dean echoed. “Why is no one protesting this?”
, and
Dean jerked away from him, scooting himself toward the head of the bed and bringing his knees up to his chest. “Who are you?” he asked in a small voice.
“I can’t, Dean. I need to know you’re okay.” He glanced at Cas, who returned the look with a nod. “And then we’re going to help you clean up.” He picked up the couch and brought it back over to its place.
“He reminded me of some stuff I’d forgotten,” Tween Dean said with a half-smile. “Good stuff.” He glanced over at the Dean still holding Castiel’s hand and sighed. “I remember you. Kind of a crap life right now, huh?”
As he made his way through the grayness toward what he believed was the correct door, he saw movement just outside another door. Wings raised slightly in instinctive readiness, he strode toward the figure, only to see the flash of a handgun as the figure disappeared back into the room. Hunter Dean, then. And that Dean now knew Castiel was here. Inside.
brother, I think the entire universe would breathe a sigh of relief.”
“Well, that’s a shame.”
on me.”
“I went looking for God.”
we’ve been through together?”
Castiel sat down at the kitchen table. “I don’t know, Sam. I’ve been thinking about that as well. I was hoping that one of them would be able to hear or see the others. That would make it much easier. But it seems they are all unaware of each other. And we’re not any farther along in finding this helping part. I think that’s where we need to start. I did have some success by simply asking for the twelve-and-a-half-year-old, rather than calling out that you needed help. Perhaps there’s a way to call for this helping part?”
“Which is?” Sam asked.
,” Cas said. “You’re the one who drew the picture.”
“Then make a platypus.” Sam’s voice was becoming frustrated.
“But you need to tell us everything you know about the demons at all the state border crossing checkpoints,” Dean added. “Or I
“I have some you can use. If you feel you need them. But honest truth, Dean, I’m just thinking a hot soak with massaging jets. I’m not going to pressure you into anything.”
Dean looked up at the ceiling, confirming what was, in fact, up, then sat down at the table and gestured with his beer that Cas should do the same. “’Kay, I’m not sayin’ that I’m not forgiving you. Just… I thought we put this behind us: the lies and betrayals, leaving without telling us and then not even a phone call. What’s bringin’ this up again?”
Castiel opened the door and walked with Dean through the mist to the other end of the hallway. At the door on the end, he knocked.
Licking his lips, Dean lowered his hands to Cas’ tie, untying it and slipping it from around Cas’ neck. Then he went to work on Cas’ shirt buttons, feeling the thrum of need flowing through his body. He darted in for another kiss as Cas ran his hands down Dean’s chest, fingertips grazing his nipples, tracing over ribs, then around Dean’s back as Cas crushed him in a tight hug.
“Pfft. They’re already in Heaven because of their choices. Give them more freedom, more choices, and it comes with a bit of responsibility to keep Heaven open. The sheer number of souls there is going to mean an individual soul won’t notice it at all. And we’ll be honest about it. Transparent. No tricks.”
“Then I will try again to contact God. I don’t know how long I’ll be gone.” Castiel turned to leave, but Sam was faster, grabbing his coat sleeve long enough for Castiel to stop and turn around.
Castiel told himself that the suicidal part might take a while to help, so he should go to that Dean’s room first. Or perhaps he was taking the easy way out and not confronting Hunter Dean first. But there did seem to be some validity to Suicidal Dean needing time.
“I…can’t. Okay? The line of work I’m in… Just trust me. All I need are a few bandages.”
“I think I should be the one who decides whom I love,” Cas said, his voice even lower than normal, causing chills to run down Dean’s spine. “I don’t see cowardice, Dean. I see your courage and your selflessness. I see someone worthy of my love, someone worthy of my life.”
Castiel felt a smile stretch his vessel’s lips. “I would like that very much, Dean.”
Cas watched him from where he sat on the edge of the bed. “You wanted to talk, Dean?”
Sam caught the immediate look Cas gave him. This appeared to be news to Cas as well, which Sam found odd. He figured they had a
Dean opened the door and unfolded himself as he got out, trying to return circulation to all his extremities. “You sure you didn’t make a wrong turn, Sam? You gotta be tired.”
“That didn’t work,” Castiel observed.
“Cookware turns him on?” Dean joked, still not comfortable with what Cas was saying.
