Wow. John's eyebrows lifted as he read the last text, his lips pursed. Ignoring that last call was definitely the right move. Definitely not an emergency, and not exactly something he's in the mood to respond to right now. He switches off the mobile and slips it back into his pocket. That whiskey can't come around soon enough.
“Now I see where you get your decorating abilities,” said John, just a bit awestruck with the scene.
“John, please. Don’t let this woman manipulate you!” Sherlock exclaimed. Both Debbie and John turned to the detective, their mouths dropping open in surprise.
Thanks, Mike. You’re a good mate, you know?
Made it to the hotel, mate! What room are you in?
"Going to Miami on holiday, then?" questioned John. How could he find out if Sherlock was seeing someone? Probably best to just ask straight out. "Meeting your girlfriend there? His cheeks felt hot. That wasn't subtle at all, but he never was one for playing games. I’ve probably had enough whiskey, he thought. Who knows what he would say if his inhibitions slipped any lower.
John leaned back in his chair comfortably, crossing his right leg over his left knee. He sipped his drink and sighed in pleasure. "All right, let's get into it. What's the plan? What did Mr. Hudson do to end up in jail in the first place, and why would he send a hit man after his wife?" John asked.
"She told me this morning. We've kind of been…off…for a bit now, but it was still a bit of a shock. So, yeah. We're done. I'll be looking for a new place when we get back from Miami. I'm actually thinking of changing my ticket to leave tonight after work, I'm already packed." John pushed his bowl of soup away and took a last gulp of his tea. "With the time difference, I could still get in at a reasonable hour tonight. I just really don't want to see her right now. Work has been a nightmare, honestly."
There was live music tonight, a solo Spanish acoustic guitar set a romantic and relaxing mood, exactly what John was hoping for. Sherlock ordered drinks for them, and John chose a few of the delicious tapas on offer. Once settled in, they took a moment and just gazed at each other.
-What do you need? Are you hurt?
“He reminds me of a dog I knew when I was a boy,” said Dad. “I think we’ll call him Archie.” Mummy stood, depositing Archie on Dad’s lap. “Nice to meet you, Archie. All right, I’m going to take a nap before Christmas lunch. See you all in a bit.” Mummy gathered some gifts to carry upstairs with her. Dad settled back on the sofa, closing his eyes as he ran his hand over Archie’s back. The sounds of light snoring could soon be heard from their direction.
John unpacked their purchases, and dragged out the bin with wrapping paper, gift bags and ribbons they had collected over the last few years. Surprisingly, gift wrapping was an activity that Sherlock thoroughly enjoyed. He took great care in choosing complementary paper and ribbons, making exact corners when folding the paper, and using minimal amounts of cellotape. The gifts were wrapped in no time, and set amidst the piles of case folders and scientific journals on the desk.
Ridiculous. - SH
Work faster. - SH
Mother requested my help with this. You know as well as I do that if I  were to let her down, I  would never hear the end of it. - SH
"Either!... Both!... How did you guess those things about me?" John rubbed his palms on his thighs self-consciously.
Sherlock met John’s eyes, sharing a small, shy smile with him. “Thank you, John.” Sherlock said, softly. Turning his attention to Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock set down his tea and stood up. “Mrs. Hudson, John and I will be leaving tomorrow morning for the duration of the holidays. We have gifts for you, if John agrees, I’d like to give them to you now?” John nodded his agreement as Sherlock pulled the gifts from the pile on the desk. “Oh my boys, that is so kind of you! I’ll be going to my sister’s myself on Christmas Eve.” Mrs. Hudson sat down on the sofa to unwrap her gifts. She carefully lifted the decanter from its box, the crystal hit with sunlight creating a prism effect, spreading tiny rainbows all over the ceiling. “Oh, isn’t this stunning? I’ll have to start entertaining more so I can show this set off!” Mrs. Hudson tucked the piece back into the box and set it down, then picked up a thick envelope with her name on it. “Sherlock and I agreed last night, Mrs. H., that you should have a rest and pamper yourself a bit, so we hope you’ll enjoy this voucher.” John was happy with their decision to purchase a spa weekend for Mrs. Hudson and a guest, and even better, they were able to print the details from the website. “The Lime Wood Hotel? Oh my, this looks so lovely!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed. “Oh you boys, you shouldn’t have gone to such an expense!” She stood up, hugging both John and Sherlock in turn. “Don’t be silly, Mrs. Hudson. What would we ever do without you?” Sherlock picked up his violin. “Any requests?”
“No, not wrong Sherlock...but usually when it’s two people who are unrelated, there are romantic feelings involved.” John set the bags down, lifting a hand to rub the back of his neck. “Do you…” John was interrupted by the front door swinging open, revealing a beautiful older woman.
“Oh John, we had the best time. I only needed a few bits and bobs, you know, but we had fun window shopping.” Mrs. Hudson turned, looking around the kitchen. “Where has Sherlock gone? I thought I heard him talking to someone...I only noticed because it was quite early, you know.” She picked up a cloth and started wiping the kitchen counters, then filled the electric kettle and switched it on. John glanced around the sitting room, but didn’t see anything that would indicate Sherlock’s current whereabouts. He glanced down the hallway, where Sherlock’s bedroom door was completely closed. That’s unusual, he thought.
Sherlock sat down on the bench. He was having a nice time with it being just the two of them, but maybe that wasn’t enough for John? He didn’t want to deprive John time with his friends. “John...I...I don’t know…” he stumbled. He felt uncomfortable and embarrassed at the anxiety a simple question had caused. John sat down next to Sherlock, putting a calming hand on his knee. “Hey, Sherlock....hey now, look at me.” John dipped his head down to try and catch the detective’s eye. “Hey, it’s fine. I’ll just text him back ‘thanks but we’re busy tonight’, no big deal.” John sent the text, then shoved his phone back into his pocket. “I’m having a great time just walking around with you tonight.” He could see that Sherlock felt awkward, and wanted to restore their easy, relaxed energy. “I have an idea of how to finish this evening...let’s catch a cab back to Baker Street, okay?” John stood up and held his hand out for Sherlock. Sherlock was grateful that John understood him so well. He took John’s offered hand, standing up and gathering the shopping bags. “Very well, John. Back to Baker Street.”
John huffed a small laugh. "Well, you're not wrong there. Although the extra room to stretch is always welcome." He sat back and closed his eyes, hoping for a little more rest before they arrived.
The bell from the door downstairs rang, breaking through John’s trance-like state. He sucked in a quick breath and turned away from the sitting room door, wondering who it could be. As far as he knew, Mrs. Hudson was still out, so he dropped his kit on the floor and took the stairs down, two at a time. He threw open the front door to find a courier standing on the step.
“Oh, please. Call me Debbie. I’m nowhere near professional, but it’s good exercise.” John raised his eyebrows at the marked Southern drawl, finding it more pronounced than others he had encountered on the trip thus far.
"…O-kay…So what is it that you do then, you know, if you're not properly employed?" John asked, his voice colored with amusement.
Sherlock pulled out his phone and ordered an Uber while John got dressed. When the doctor emerged from the bathroom, he had donned dark, slim-fit jeans and a tight fitting V-neck tee in charcoal gray. He had added a bit of gel to his hair, and smiled self-consciously as the detective gave him an appreciative once-over. Sherlock hummed his approval.
CHAPTER 1
7:21 PM
John woke a few hours later to Sherlock playing his violin. He didn't recognize the tune, but it was something slow and melodic, not terrible to wake up to, he thought to himself. He was grateful to find that Sherlock had draped the blanket over him as he slept. He opened his eyes and stretched, his gaze falling upon the mantle. It took a moment for him to realize what he was seeing..."Umm, Sherlock?" He stood up and walked over to his friend at the window.
"What did you do to get banished all the way back here?" asked John. "I'm John, by the way. John Watson." John held out his hand in greeting.
CHAPTER 6
You have a reservation at the Hotel Beaux Arts-I believe it is the Bay View Suite. Just please remember,  Sherlock, this is not a vacation. - MH
His phone chirped a text alert.
Mummy took it, and pulled him closer. “John, you must call me Mummy, or Mum is fine, too. Sherlock has raved about you, and we consider you part of the family now. Daddy can’t wait to meet you.” Mummy was so warm and genuine, John couldn’t help but feel at ease. Sherlock caught his eye and gave him a look that John could only describe as tender. He felt his cheeks go pink as he smiled at them both.
John groaned as he rolled over, the first rays of sunlight assaulting his eyes. The puppy had kept both him and Sherlock busy most of the night, John didn’t even remember getting himself into Sherlock’s bed.
After they bid Mrs. Hudson goodbye, John had followed Sherlock into a waiting cab. Sherlock turned to John, noting that he had grabbed his lighter jacket. John’s voice echoed in his head - wrap up, don’t want to be feeling sick at Christmas! - Sherlock unwound his scarf, leaning close to John. “Here, John. Allow me.” Sherlock gently wrapped the scarf around John’s neck, adjusting it carefully. “I don’t want you to catch a cold.”
John nodded once. Sherlock reached over and placed a cool hand in Johns' lap. The long fingers wrapped slowly around John’s fist, Sherlock rubbing his thumb lightly over the back of John’s hand in an attempt to soothe him.
"I'll fill you in on what I've learned so far, and we'll decide on a plan together, all right?" Sherlock sipped his drink, then placed it on the small table and leaned forward, his elbows on his knees and his fingers clasped. "Richard Hudson and his business partner, Mr. Timothy Ayers, ran a moderately successful import/export business. It started as a small operation, dealing mostly with Caribbean suppliers. Unfortunately, Richard is also a heavy gambler. He owed a lot of money to some very nasty people. As I understand it, he was approached by someone - most likely also involved with those nasty people - with an idea of how he could make good on his debts. It didn't take much persuasion for old Rich to start trafficking drugs through his business." Sherlock paused for a sip of his drink.
Dad set the bag on the floor, removing the fluff of tissue paper from the top. “Oh my word, look Katy! It’s a puppy!” He scooped the little beast from the gift bag. “I’ve been missing having a dog around the place. Oh, he’s sleepy.”
“Just water for me, thanks.” John crossed his legs, vaguely wishing he had brought something to take notes with. “You look like a professional out there, Mrs. Ayers.” Flattery is always a good policy, he thought.
His shoulder aches, but it feels good to keep going - pushing himself beyond comfort. His arms are working hard, pulling his body smoothly through the water. He can hear his own breath, feel his lungs straining against his ribs. There’s a light splash of water accompanying each stroke as he propels himself to finish his last lap strong. He hangs on the edge for a few moments, gasping to catch his breath before pulling himself up and out of the pool.
John was preparing for bed when he was interrupted by a pounding on the door. It startled him, as Mike wasn't arriving until tomorrow. He had just texted to warn him about the shockingly high heat and humidity. He heard a voice in the hallway as he padded barefoot through the entryway. Standing on tiptoe and leaning forward to see through the peephole, John was pleasantly surprised at the face staring  back at him.
Sherlock whipped the door open, his lower half now wrapped in a towel. “It’s fine, John. My parents know me, they know we’ll get there when we can.” Sherlock brushed his sweaty curls off his forehead, leaning on the doorframe.
John opened the door and ushered Mike inside. He gave him a sideways smile, but didn't verbally acknowledge the sorry attempt at a joke. "I'll text you tonight, Mike. And thanks, mate, you're a good friend." John stopped at the check-in desk to pick up files for his last few appointments. The love of his life, right. Who would want to be with an emotionless robot like him?
Sherlock turned to face John with a smile. “Case, John. We’ve got a case!” he exclaimed. “Christmas has come early!” He rubbed his hands together in anticipation.
"John. Yes, of course. I'm fine." Sherlock finished his drink in one long swallow. "I sometimes get lost in my thoughts. I confess, I am feeling quite exhausted. The time change is affecting me more than usual." Sherlock rubbed his hands on his thighs unconsciously.
John sat down on the end of his bed. "So let me get this straight. You came to Miami to catch an assassin? And what, get Mr. Hudson out of jail?" John tilted his head, his eyes narrowing as he tried to make sense of Sherlock's thoughts.
CHAPTER 6
They stopped to admire the breathtakingly gorgeous chandelier, then continued through the lobby to the 1930's House. John had read about this place online, and was not disappointed. It was a restored Florida style bungalow turned cocktail/tapas bar. The living room had been cozily furnished, and sported wood beam ceilings and a limestone fireplace. The club chairs near the (thankfully unlit) fireplace looked wonderfully comfortable. John planned to use the intimate setting to his advantage and get to know Sherlock better.
“You’ve been fidgeting with your wedding ring throughout our conversation, a sure sign that you’re feeling guilty. I suspect that rather than visiting your mother in Charleston, you were indulging in a romantic getaway with your lover.” Sherlock said, scornfully.
"John, I certainly hope you packed your gun! We are going to need it." Sherlock looked up and met John's excited grin.
They stood, leaning into one another, indulging in this first moment of mutual understanding, enjoying the shift from friends to more than. Sherlock was the first to step back, leaving John feeling the chill of his absence.
"Yes?" questioned Sherlock.
CHAPTER 2
Sherlock took the folder, setting it aside. “That’s good, John, because we leave after lunch. Did you happen to pack your gun?” He asked, ignoring the incredulous look John gave him.
"I am a consulting detective. Only one in the world." Sherlock announced proudly, with just a hint of shyness creeping in. He found himself wanting to impress this man. That's unusual, he thought. "I created the job, and I am quite good at it." His eyes narrowed as he tried to gauge John's reaction. It was incredibly hard to predict what he was thinking.
John gave her a final questioning glance, then went to follow his detective.
John handed him a steaming mug, then took a sip from his own. "Well, that's okay. Do you have other plans? Which is fine, by the way."
Dad looked at her over the edge of his mug, harrumphing in amusement. Sherlock narrowed his eyes in inquiry, studying his mother. She returned his look defensively, shooting an annoyed glance at her husband.
John felt flustered. He took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “Okay, well...we need to have something to eat and get some sleep before we leave, at least a few hours. I’ll make us a snack while you shower.” He turned and headed back to the kitchen, calling back over his shoulder “And don’t take all day styling your hair!” John giggled as he heard the detective swear at him good-naturedly.
Mary looked at him sadly. "Really, John? That's it?" her eyes tearing up. "You don't have anything else to say?" she asked. "This emotionless robot routine? This is why we won't work out!" She pushed away from the table, standing up and turning away from him to hide her tears. "I would work on this with you if you showed any desire at all, any love for me AT ALL!" her voice escalating to a shout at the end. "I tell you that I've been cheating on you, and you act like I forgot to pick up the milk on the way home." Mary wiped her eyes with tight knuckles. "Well. So that's it then. I can't believe this is really over." She sobbed tightly, trying to control her reactions.
Silver-gray and dark blue eyes met, and both men felt the frisson of attraction between them. Sherlock's body was betraying him, his cheeks flushed a bright pink. His fingers stretched as if to take the doctor's hand in his, but just as quickly he retracted them and shoved them into his pocket. Did John notice that? He thought to himself.
He tried to keep a serious face, but Sherlock met his eyes, and the scolding look quickly turned into a staring contest between the two. They both made increasingly ridiculous faces, trying to get the other to laugh, while holding the stare. As usual, John broke first. Sherlock got him to crack by lifting the tip of his nose up with his finger, so that he looked like a strange beaver/pig hybrid. John cracked up every time he saw it, and this time was no exception. He laughed so hard, his eyes started watering. Sherlock smiled indulgently, calmly waiting for John's fit of giggles to subside.
Still want to meet up tonight?
"So he's a drug trafficking middle-man. What about his partner? Is Ayers in jail as well? He must have realized what was going on. And what, they got busted, right? What happened, a raid on their local warehouse?"  John sat back in his chair.
-Also, tea. -SH
She gave him a sympathetic look, but started heading his way, leading the troublesome passenger. John watched their progress up the aisle, but he couldn't get a good look at the guy from where he was sitting. He found himself feeling torn between mourning the loss of his extra leg-room, and his curiosity over this new development on what had been (let's be honest) a pretty boring and uneventful flight so far.
Sherlock turned his attention back to Debbie. “Did you speak to him at all while you were away?” he asked impatiently.
Sherlock stopped to look at some intricate glass art. “She and my mother have been friends since their school days, so she’s always been in my life”. He skirted around some shoppers to look at the items on the far side of the stall. “And you know she had a bit of trouble that I was able to help out with, with her husband”. Sherlock picked up a beautiful crystal sherry decanter, part of a set with two glasses on a wooden tray. “What if we get her this, and some dance lessons?” He asked. John was surprised at Sherlock’s use of “we”...would it be weird for them to give gifts together, like, as a couple? It makes sense, I guess, he thought, but it will definitely add fuel to Mrs. Hudson’s fire about our relationship status. John nodded slowly, reaching for his wallet. Sherlock shook his head, “Don’t worry about it John, we’ll figure it out later”. Sherlock went to negotiate with the stall owner, who was soon wrapping up their gift.
Sherlock and John agreed, heading off on their own in the crisp air, snow cracking under their boots.
"Your skull?" John felt he was struggling to keep up with this conversation.
CHAPTER 10
His new friend was easy to spot...everyone in the vicinity - male and female - were stealing glances. Sherlock looked like a GQ model, leaning on the side of a black Audi S5, his feet crossed at the ankles and hands in his pockets. He raised a hand when he saw John, then moved to take control in the driver’s seat.
John retrieved the puppy supplies from the car, and followed Sherlock up to his room. John set up puppy pads in and around the basket, which they decided would be safest on the floor inside Sherlock’s closet. Sherlock wrapped the pup in a fleece blanket, tucking him in while John filled a small dish of water. They carefully closed the closet door, agreeing to meet downstairs for a nightcap.
"It's all true, John." stated Sherlock, as the blindsided Bill continued to gape at him in shock.
Are you kidding me?! John shook his head slightly.
"No problem. Happy Christmas." He hesitated, considering asking her name, maybe inviting her for a coffee. The last few dates he had been on had been unsuccessful, never progressing past the first awkward drinks or dinner. This girl was cute and friendly, why not enjoy his unexpected afternoon off?
It was at this point (right...those are his nipples!) that John realized his flatmate was wearing nothing but his trousers. “Hang on, how did you get out of your clothes so fast...even your socks!” John felt his face flush with heat. He turned to grab the tea bags, hoping that Sherlock wouldn’t notice the effect that the proximity of his body was having.
"My deducing thing.” Sherlock huffed. “Fine." The detective turned in his seat, focusing his silver gaze on his seatmate. John felt all at once that he was under a microscope, the world narrowed down to the small space between himself and the detective, and experienced a momentary inability to breathe.
John hoped that Sherlock was getting more from this woman than he was. “So...that’s when you called the police?” he asked.
Sherlock dropped the pillow onto John, then threw himself down to cover the doctor. He was rewarded with a surprised squawk, which quickly turned into John’s signature giggle. John threw his elbow back, connecting sharply with Sherlock’s midriff, which earned him a loud “Ooofffhhh!” in return. John twisted himself around, pulling Sherlock into a more comfortable position. John lay his head down in the crook of Sherlock’s arm, resting on his shoulder. Sherlock wrapped his arms around the doctor, gently squeezing him and kissing John’s temple.
John leaned his head back and closed his eyes. The beginnings of a headache were just starting to take shape. "I'm going to try and get a nap in before we land. I really appreciate your kindness, Sherlock. I guess it was a lucky thing for me that you got disciplined by that flight attendant." the smirk was evident in John's tone.
"Sorry, didn't realize I was." John did know he was staring, but really, he couldn't help it. The man sat next to him was the most beautiful person he had ever seen.
"Yes, it helps me to talk through my thoughts out loud. You would be a passable stand-in." Sherlock ruffled his hair with both hands, then swung himself into an armchair. His legs bounced with barely restrained energy.
Mike's mouth dropped open in surprise. "Mary? No!" he said incredulously. "Are you all right? How did you find out?"
He and Sherlock had changed into pyjama pants and old sweaters when they got home, and John made homemade hot chocolate. He opened a package of cookies while Sherlock lit the sitting room fire. They turned on the telly and sat down on the couch, deciding to watch a rerun of the 2008 Gavin & Stacey Christmas Special, which was just beginning.
The cab delivered them to meet Lestrade at an address near Chelsea Bridge, where they encountered a horrific scene. The subsequent 36 hours had been non-stop, unraveling the multiple homicide case - which turned out to be the aftermath of a fatal disagreement among members of an international counterfeiting syndicate.
"Yeah, let's get this day over with! I could go the rest of my life without seeing another runny nose. Give me a strange, unexplained rash any day!" Mike had jumped up, sauntering to the front of the café. He held the door open for a couple of giggling girls. John followed him out to the pavement, and turned to head back to the clinic. "Of course I'll help you find a new flat," continued Mike. "You can kip at mine as long as you need to, you know Karen would be happy to have you. She's an amazing cook as well." Mike patted his rounded belly ruefully. "So send me a text tonight and let me know when you get to the hotel, yeah? Karen and I are on tomorrow’s flight, so maybe we can meet for dinner or something." Mike stopped abruptly outside the clinic entrance. "Who knows, maybe you'll meet the love of your life on this trip!" he chuckled.
"I know that you were in the military, RAMC, most likely. You were injured and sent home unwillingly. You must have been shot, but where and under what circumstances? I need more information to determine that. Once home, you took a job beneath your skill level. You find it unbearably boring. You also just broke up with your girlfriend, lucky for you, I'd say, because you found her unbearably boring as well. You planned on this trip saving the relationship, but ended up leaving early and alone…so she must have told you something upsetting. Right, she was seeing another man. You've decided to move out when you get back from the conference, but don't have the funds to live on your own." He smiled broadly at John, the corners of his eyes crinkling. "How did I do?" he asked.
Hey Mike, change of plans. I’ve actually met someone.
John spluttered, spraying his tea in an impressive arc. “Sorry, sorry…” he took the napkin Sherlock offered and began to wipe up his mess. “I just didn’t expect that description!” He began to laugh, along with both Dad and Sherlock. Mummy eyed all three of them in miffed silence.
Sherlock observed John’s abrupt discomfort with a feeling of confusion. He knew John had a fear of flying, but the man looked as if he was suffering a severe panic attack. It seemed out of proportion to…Ahhh, something happened in Afghanistan, that must be it. Some form of PTSD, perhaps? That would explain the distress John seemed to be in at the moment.
"My client is Mrs. Martha Hudson. Her husband Richard is currently incarcerated at the Federal Detention Center here in Miami. She was visiting relatives in Hampshire when an attempt was made on her life. She was lucky, the would be assassin turned out to be a terrible shot. My mother and Mrs. Hudson are old school friends - she remembered that our family estate was nearby, and made her way to the relative safety of my family's parlor. After considerable prompting and frankly an appalling amount of tea, my mother was able to piece together the details of her predicament. Knowing of my brilliant professional record for solving mysteries, of course Mummy called me and asked me to take her case." Sherlock spoke quickly and expressively, his hands helping to emphasize and embellish his story.
No better than you deserve, John! Text me on Tuesday to confirm details.
So...I wrote chapters 1-6 of this story almost 5 years ago. This is the first "new" chapter. The chapter count has gone up, and the rating may change as we move along. My writing style has evolved a bit - I tried my best to match the tone of the story, so I hope you still enjoy reading it. If you do...kudos and comments, please!
“I know, Dad. Believe me, I know.” John suddenly wanted nothing more than to wrap his arms around his detective. “I think I’ll go find him, if you don’t mind?” John stood up, putting his hand out to Dad.
John turned his head, propping his chin on Sherlock’s chest, in order to look the detective in the eye. “I love you, too, you know?” John squeezed his eyes shut, feeling more emotion than he could express out loud. “So much, Sherlock. I just love you so much.” His voice was low and husky as he reached up to kiss Sherlock’s lips. This felt so right, the two of them together, like this.
“Yes, like a Dickensian ghost, perhaps.” Sherlock earned a swat from Mummy.
“I called him, you know, when I got there. He didn’t answer, I figured he was on the golf course and didn’t want the interruption.” Debbie stopped talking, crossing her arms in front of her chest. This action pressed her full breasts together, her tank top showing off a healthy amount of cleavage. John’s eyes dropped from her face momentarily, until he turned his gaze to the detective - who was glaring at him in irritation. John smiled at him sheepishly, he should have known Sherlock would catch him taking a peek. I’m only human, he thought.
John frowned. Had his eccentric flatmate injured himself, or did he just need a pen handed to him? With Sherlock, he had learned it was better to ask before he panicked.

John was exhausted from a number of short nights on top of the time change, but Sherlock's excitement was giving him a second wind. He pulled on his shoes, bending over to tie them. Sherlock couldn't help a quick perusal of John's fit backside. The physical reactions to arousal that he was experiencing first hand were unexpected for him, but he couldn't deny that that's exactly what was happening.
John was overwhelmed at the Holmes’ welcome and their effortless affection. It was just such a different home dynamic than he had experienced growing up. He had to admit, Sherlock’s parents were not at all what he had expected...they were so loving and kind to each other! I’ve seen glimpses of them in Sherlock, he realizes, glancing at his detective, especially recently.
6:27 PM
John grabbed a pillow from behind himself and threw it at Sherlock, hitting him squarely in the face. “What was that for?!” Sherlock squawked indignantly.
-SHismyBFF

Far from being annoyed by this, the detective found himself oddly pleased. No one had touched him this much in years, at least not willingly. There was the occasional full body tackle in his training gym, but that was nothing compared to this. John looked peaceful and almost…sweet. He had obviously needed the sleep.
Sherlock transferred the warm bundle of fur to John’s hands. John instinctually cradled the pup to his chest, rubbing his nose on the puppy’s head. “I believe he is so young that I could carry him in my coat in the car, and no one would be the wiser.” Sherlock looked around the shop, quickly locating an assistant. “Excuse me, Miss…”
Sherlock took the opportunity to study John, his cheeks flushed and his face peaceful. I want him to always look this happy, Sherlock thought. I'd do anything for him to always be this happy. His feelings for John had taken him by surprise at first, but had grown from what he classified as lustful (immediately following their first case together) to something much deeper, more meaningful. He had cataloged a number of shifts in their relationship over the past months, and felt confident that he was experiencing something unprecedented, definitely unplanned.
John opened his eyes slowly, finally realizing what was happening, where they were.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s mobile buzzed just as they were pulling into traffic. He held up a silencing finger to John as he answered. “Lestrade.” Sherlock spoke quietly yet tersely. “Address?...Yes, we’re on our way.” He pocketed the mobile, calling out the change of destination to the driver.
He pulled the door open and Sherlock swept past him, already in the middle of a sentence."...could be dangerous, should definitely be carrying a weapon..."
John glanced at the time, surprised to see it was already half one. He wiped his hands on the towel, then answered Mike.
"I cannot allow you to keep harassing your fellow passengers, Mr. Holmes. You have already upset a number of people and been asked to move seats twice. This is the last straw, sir. There is only one other empty seat on this flight, I'm afraid I have to ask you to remove yourself from this row and follow me towards the rear of the plane." The attendant turned her head, scanning the back rows, and caught John's eye.
"Thank you." John's voice was low and scratchy, as if he were trying not to cry. "You have no idea how much that means to me, Sherlock. I'd love to go with you to your parents for the holidays." John squeezed Sherlock's arms once more in affection before letting go and sitting back down.
"I'm quite tired as well, it's understandable. Would you mind if we rested for a few hours, and continued this discussion over breakfast tomorrow?" John leaned over to place his empty glass on the table, his knee brushing along the side of Sherlock's long thigh.
I’ve run into him a few times in the labs at Bart’s - he’s a smart fella - right up your alley :)
-Where are you? -SH
Exhausted and drained, Sherlock finally found himself alone in his suite. He checked the bedroom, finding his bags already unpacked for him. Mycroft must be feeling generous, he thought. His footsteps echoed on the hardwood floor as he made his way back into the sitting room.
But this was pretty freaking scary.
Mary again. He thumbed across to ignore the call. He checked the text icon…5 new texts. What could she possibly want from him?! She's the one that cheated. He sent her a text on his way to the airport, letting her know that he was leaving tonight, and that he would contact her when he was back to pick up his things from the flat. As far as he's concerned, that's it.
“There hasn’t been a dog in the house for years, John. I know Dad wants one, and Mummy can’t say no if he’s a gift.” Sherlock tucked the puppy into the folds of his great coat.
Mycroft would get to you first. -SH
“Call me Dad, please, John. I look forward to getting to know you in person, we’ve heard such amazing stories from Sherlock. And of course, we read your blog.” Daddy Holmes turned towards the kitchen, following Mummy. “I have my Katy to thank for these monstrosities,” he did a shuffling dance to show off the slippers. “That’s what love does to you, John. You end up wearing ridiculous holiday slippers!” Daddy chuckled, bending down to kiss Mummy’s cheek.
“Ah...yes, um...sorry, Mum. I had trouble sleeping last night. I hope we didn’t bother you too much?” John didn’t have to feign the embarrassed blush staining his cheeks.
John interrupted Dad, reaching his hand out to touch the arm of his chair. “Sir...I think I know what you’re getting at. I assure you, I would never do anything to hurt Sherlock.” John stared down at his hands, now clasped tightly around his knees. “In fact, I owe him my life. I’d do anything for your son, sir. He’s the most brilliant, surprising, resourceful...kind, caring and beautiful person I’ve ever known.” John made eye contact with Dad, deciding to share something extremely personal with him. “Sherlock and I...he told me he loves me.” John paused, still in wonder that Sherlock felt this way about him. “Tonight, he just told me tonight. Sir, I believe I...feel the same about him.” John didn’t want to say the actual words aloud until he had said them to Sherlock. “He’s been my best friend for as long as I’ve known him. Being in his life has been a great adventure so far, and I’m looking forward to a future with him in it.” John sat back, downing the rest of his whiskey in one big gulp. “As long as he’ll have me.”
Okay, be brave, Watson. John lifted his face to make eye contact with Sherlock. “Would you sit down, Sherlock? I think we need to talk.”
John straightened up, grabbed his wallet from the bedside table, and slipped it into his back pocket. "Ready to go." he stated, turning a bright smile on Sherlock. "I looked up a few places we could try on my phone, I'd love to buy you a drink while you catch me up on the case." John was trying desperately to sound calm and nonchalant, aware that the younger man could read his every thought on his face. He didn't want to come on too strong and scare the detective away, after all.
John had been watching the entire exchange with his mouth hanging open and his eyes wide. He shook his head a bit, standing to leave. “Umm...thanks for meeting with us, Debbie, good luck with...ummm…” He trailed off, not sure what to say.
John saw his shivering friend's distress, and took a blanket from the back of his armchair. "Here, wrap up. Between breathing these fumes and walking around the flat barefoot in the middle of December, you're going to make yourself sick. Don't want to be feeling poorly at Christmas!" John helped tuck the blanket around Sherlock's feet, running his hands up Sherlock's legs and stopping at his hip, making sure he was wrapped up tight. "I'll get a fire going, and try to sort out some tea for us." He turned away, just missing the faint blush that his lingering touch brought to his flatmate's cheeks.
Sherlock hated leaving John behind.  His older brother Mycroft, who occupied a small role in the British government, had helpfully seen to it that Sherlock's trek through Customs was quick and painless. He grabbed his luggage from the carousel and located the private driver that was waiting for him.
That’s some quick work, LOL
Snow crunched under John’s feet as he carried their bags up the front steps. The sky was a brilliant, shining blue and the air smelled like wood smoke. Despite the idyllic setting, John’s stomach was a bundle of nerves. Get it together, Watson, he thought.
He clicked to open the texts, vaguely concerned it might be an emergency.
“Oh good, you’re awake.” Sherlock was on his hands and knees, wiping up yet another accident. “I am loathe to admit this, but Mummy may have had a point. We are never getting a dog, John.”
John looked at Sherlock, raising his eyebrows. “What’s this then?” He leaned into Sherlock’s side, holding up the flat package.
"Repetition is boring. Know which, that you have a fear of flying, or that you are a doctor?" questioned Sherlock.
Debbie could barely get a word out, she was so incensed. She stood up, spluttering and waving her arm at the detective. John thought Sherlock was lucky he wasn’t wearing the remainder of her tea...yet.
John loved helping out on cases, being able to observe Sherlock’s brilliance in action. The changes he was noticing in Sherlock’s behavior...well, that conversation could wait. Sherlock typically wouldn’t eat or sleep while on a case. Somehow, John doubted an in-depth discussion about feelings would be a priority.
"Umm, John…" Sherlock addressed his new acquaintance uncomfortably. "I must confess that I don't know what to do in this situation. I have been called a sociopath before, I don't know how to assist when there are emotions involved…" Sherlock broke off as the plane dipped and shook rapidly.
He’s roused from relaxed, languid dreams by his text alert. Fumbling on the ground next to his lounge, his fingers finally wrapped around his mobile.
A bit late for that now...
“John has nightmares, Mummy. We apologize for disturbing you.” Sherlock glared at John meaningfully.
Mummy glanced around the room suspiciously. “Merry Christmas, boys...is everything alright in here? Daddy and I thought we heard noises last night…?” Mummy scrunched her nose delicately, unsure what she was smelling in the room.
It was almost too comfortable, between the quiet music and the delicious food and drink, he was fighting the need to drop off. Staying awake was challenging, but watching the animated detective lay out the facts of the case was interesting - almost as interesting as the play of light on Sherlock's dark curls and sharp cheekbones. God, I just want to run my hands through those curls…I wonder what his lips feel like… John shook his head, trying to clear it of these thoughts before he got too far involved in the images they were creating.
John couldn't believe his good luck. It was the week before Christmas, and he was actually leaving work early. The clinic had been overrun with colds and flu, and most of the staff were taking their vacation days, so he had expected a long (and boring) week. He could never have predicted the cold snap, burst pipes and collapsed roof section that followed. Thankfully no one had been injured, but the clinic couldn't operate in its current state. The staff had all been sent home until further notice, which likely meant after the holidays.
“Pedestrian?” Sherlock supplied. “Tiresome, tedious…take your pick.”
The Uber driver was waiting for them in front of the hotel. Sherlock slid over to the far window as John settled in and pulled the rear door shut. The driver turned his head to face them. "Hey, would one of you want to sit up front? I promise I won't bite." Bill Jasper was a middle-aged man with a hopeful comb over and a pastel pink golf shirt. "I hate feeling like I'm Driving Miss Daisy, hah." He exclaimed.
“Of course he’s asleep now,” complained Sherlock. “He kept John and I up all night!”
Meet me outside. I have a car. - SH
“Not for the four people that were killed it wasn’t.” John removed his own jacket and Sherlock’s scarf, hanging them up before moving to fill the kettle. “You were brilliant as usual, the way you deduced that poor parking attendant in front of his boss though...he’ll be looking for a new job come New Year’s!” John chuckled wearily.
"Did you stop in and check on Mrs. Hudson before you came up? I was positive I heard her banging things around earlier this morning." Sherlock stood up and moved into the sitting room, where he proceeded to flop on his back on the sofa, with his legs hanging over the end. "Then again, it could have been the dustman, I wasn't paying close attention." Sherlock turned on his side to face John, and tried unsuccessfully to tuck his bare feet up into his pyjama pants.
CHAPTER 3
Sherlock continued chastising her. “Oh please, spare us the theatrics. I believe that you truly have no idea where he is, but your acting skills are stretched thin convincing us that you really care all that much.” He stopped behind John’s chair, putting his hand on the doctor’s shoulder. “You see John, she discovered when she returned from her clandestine tryst that Tim hadn’t been home since Friday night. Yet she waited another whole day to report him missing.” The detective turned his back on them, pausing his exhibition. Look who’s talking about theatrics, thought John.
Sherlock looked down at John, sharing a wry grin. “I would also like to...ummm...talk...about some things, John.” Sherlock shifted a little uncomfortably. “Mummy’s timing is nothing if not inopportune...to be continued?” he asked, sounding hopeful.
Their shoulders bumped companionably as they made their way along the crowded walkway. Sherlock had suggested the Christmas market at the Tate Modern, where they could grab a bite to eat and then browse the stalls for gifts. He didn’t enjoy holiday merrymaking as a general rule, but the thought of walking with John through the beautiful wooden chalets, looking at the lights and enjoying the music...well. That was a different matter. “Would you like mulled wine, or perhaps a cider?” Sherlock placed his hand on John’s elbow to get his attention.
They joined Mummy and Dad at the kitchen table for tea and a staggering array of holiday treats. Sherlock nabbed more than a few mince pies before they had even sat down, greedily eyeing up the plate of stollen as well.
Sherlock fell backwards into the armchair, steepling his fingers under his chin. His mouth quirked in a small smile. He knew John would agree to help him, but hearing John agree gave him a warm feeling. It was novel, and entirely unfamiliar. This is the beginning of something new, he thought with excitement.
He could see the effect his body was having on John, and he was enjoying it. “I’ll text Mummy at a more reasonable hour to let her know we’re on our way.”
Obviously.  Where am I being taken? - SH
The carol sing turned out to be quite a joyous gathering. Apparently, feuds could be set aside for the enjoyment of holiday festivities. It was nice to see Mum and Dad socialize with so many of their neighbors, they were obviously well-liked and respected by many. (Although it wasn’t hard for John to identify Kath, who did indeed stand out in her role as the village busybody.)
“Thanks, Mum.” John took the offered mug, enjoying the way it felt to address her as ‘Mum’, it was unexpectedly comforting. “Is that peppermint fudge? That’s my favorite!” John helped himself to a piece of the rich dessert. “Did you make this yourself?” he asked.
Sherlock took John's warm hand in his, and slowly unfolded his long frame from the chair. "We'll have to call a cab this time, John. I refuse to be separated just to cater to a driver for hire." Sherlock sniffed indignantly.
My apologies if you were hoping for a Christmas quickie, but the chapter count has gone up! I hope you don't mind too much :) Also, I took artistic license in naming Sherlock's parents. I just like those names. Thanks for reading!
"Mmm...yes." replied John with a sharp nod.
John grinned, his friend knew him too well.
“You’re being ridiculous, John.” Sherlock’s tone was embarrassed but pleased. “Any progress obtaining a gun?” He tried to steer the conversation to safer ground. “I don’t expect this interview to become violent, but one never knows.”
His text alert interrupted his thoughts. "Oh um, excuse me a moment…" John turned away from the girl, pulling his mobile from his pocket.
“Why are you texting me when I can hear you!” John called up in amused exasperation. He climbed the stairs, meeting Sherlock at the top. John handed Sherlock the package and bent down to retrieve his dressing gown from the floor. “A surprise from your brother sounds a bit scary,” John remarked as he turned, heading down the hallway to the bathroom. “Is it something to do with a case?” he asked. Sherlock moved to sit in his armchair, propping the delivery on the mantle along the way. “It’s Christmas, John. You should know better than to ask questions” Sherlock turned with a smile, falling back into his chair. He crossed his legs, briefly steepling his fingers in front of his mouth. “Do hurry John, I can hear your stomach grumbling from here”.
John smiled as he flipped through the brochure, imagining swimming in the Caribbean with Sherlock, drinking a cold beer on the beach, napping in hammocks…”That sounds perfect, Sherlock. I can’t wait.” John lay his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, the long night beginning to catch up with him.
As they moved to the next stall, John heard his mobile chime. “Don’t tell me that’s from you”. He looked up at Sherlock and laughed, setting down the shopping bags on a nearby bench and pulling the phone from his pocket. “Huh. How social are you feeling right now?” he asked Sherlock. The look Sherlock gave him said it all, and set John laughing again. “Alright, alright...I only ask because I’ve just got a text from Lestrade, a few of the lads are getting together for holiday drinks tonight, and he’s invited us along”. John shifted the phone to his other hand so he could type in the address of the pub. “It’s not far from here, we could probably walk over if we wanted to join them.”
“It’s not for
“Which was it – Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“What are you doing with coca?” he sneered down at Sherlock. “All of the coca in this jungle belongs to us.”
"I think two hours," Sherlock corrected. "Lovely chat, much too dangerous while I’m driving, what with everything on the wrong side of the road and all of the moose wandering about—" he hung up mid-sentence to emphasize his point.
“Yes, I
What are you doing here? Don’t you know you shouldn’t be out after dark?”
“You plant types are all the same,” she said with a laugh, and took the terra cotta pot from him. “Back in a jiff.” He watched her retreat and swiftly turned to the stacks around him, rapidly rifling through all of the papers, searching for the black spine of his notebook. His notes
“Bickering with you and slurred speech in the middle of the afternoon.”
"Canada."

“Thanks. It’s sort of…oozing.” Dimmock looked fleetingly horrified.
“I’ll call if I have more questions.” The men shook hands again and John watched as the officer’s car pulled out of the lot. John turned and went back into the exam room, where Sarah was gently prodding and moving Sherlock’s ankle.
“Yes,” Sherlock said.
“I’m…” Sherlock decided to tell the truth, or something close to it. “I’m looking for a…friend. Her name is Irene. Dr. Irene Adler. She disappeared, and that,” he pointed, “is her car.”
“Did you find anything?” Sherlock shook his head.
“There’s no one in it. Nothing in it. Glove box is open, it’s empty.” He could hear crunching as John edged close enough to look. John circled back to the truck in a wide arc, standing at Sherlock’s door and crossing his arms.
“How are we doing this, John?” Archie asked, looking down at Sherlock.
❦ ❦ ❦ ❦ ❦
“John!” Stifling an eye roll, John turned and trudged uphill a few steps, Sherlock’s loose arm slapping against his thigh.
“Destroy his little arts and crafts project,” the commander called, and the soldiers were tearing up the specimens with gusto, grinding scraps into the mud under their boots. “We catch you with our coca again and you’re going to rot in this jungle. You’re going to wish your slut mother had never given birth to you. You’re going to beg for your life and for your
“Copy. See you soon, over.”
“Let’s go! Some bastard is fucking my wife!” the commander yelled. And just like that, they were gone.
“I can help you, Mister Holmes,” Archie said gamely.
“Of course. Also, you owe me a meeting. We’re due to go over your finances for your last expedition. There are a few…lines in your budget that need a better explanation than ‘drugs,’ or the director will have my head.”
❦ ❦ ❦ ❦ ❦
“Can’t you stitch it here?” John swallowed, and then his eyes narrowed.
“What? No idea. Named him after the town in Manitoba where I found him. Fought a fire out there in 2012.” He picked up the radio and flicked it on. “Harry, I’ve got a lost botanist with me? Over.”
❦ ❦ ❦ ❦ ❦
"It's rather late," she said, crushing the cigarette butt under the toe of her stiletto heel. He reached out for her arm.
“Don’t worry,” John said. “I’ll call it in myself, then. Weird that I didn’t see it at first. Must not have had my eyes on.” He flashed a grin at Sherlock, who was suddenly even more sure he was sunburned.
Smokejumping. He set the phone down and stared out the window of his cabin into the dark forest beyond. Bill Murray must be nuts to think he could do it. Murray was the one who had dragged him out of the line of fire over in Panjwaii, he knew about the hole the sniper’s bullet had punched through his shoulder, had heard all about the injuries once John was conscious and recovering, first at Landstuhl in Germany and then at Petawawa back home.
He turned down a gravel track and the quality of the road quickly deteriorated, forcing him to weave back and forth to avoid the largest of the rocks and potholes. A loud scraping sound came from in front of him and he came to a stop, worried he was stuck or had lost the oil pan. He cut the engine and stepped out, only to see that the cheap plastic bumper of the car had become dislodged by a rock. He shook his head and snapped the bumper back on before stepping back to take a look at the road.
He reclined in his first-class seat, courtesy of his brother's credit card (why Mycroft hadn't noticed his credit card was missing was certainly a topic for later discussion). He couldn't possibly afford such accommodation on an academic's salary, of course.
He jogged down the steps and hurried to his car, feeling the weight of the GPS unit bump against his leg. Once safely back in his rental, he pulled it out and stared at the brightly-coloured face. He clicked through it, looking at the saved data points.
“We’ll have to leave it to the authorities, then. I am sorry about your friend, Sherlock Holmes,” she told him. “We’re all hoping for good news.”
“I’m going to let Dr. Sawyer finish,” John said carefully, “and then you’re going to finish telling me who you are and what the
“Very funny,” came the crackling response.
“I’m a botanist and I was—!” Sherlock was interrupted by pain as John wiggled his shoe off. “Working!”
It looked even worse ahead and he could hear running water, probably a stream. If he had known he’d be lucky enough to find the GPS, he would have sprung (well, Mycroft would have sprung) for an SUV. He glanced down at his leather shoes, already caked in dust, and his dirty trouser cuffs ringed with mud, and reached in the car for his day pack and the GPS. Hefting the bag onto his shoulders, he rolled up his sleeves and set off down the road, looking for the next site and any sign of Irene.
“Do be obvious, Irene,” he said, and started the engine.
“Bloody hell, Sherlock, she’s the most well-known authority on
“Trust me.” He turned John toward the exam door, and caught a glimpse of something at the small of his back, tucked into his waistband. Something that looked like a gun.
“Those are important specimens,” Sherlock called out. The soldier looked up from his task, made eye contact, and ripped an herbarium sheet in two.
I mean, just look at this inspiring art from TheTwelfthPanda:
“Stay there.” The commanding tone in his voice made Sherlock’s spine straighten. “I see it.” John stalked over to the car, evidently a green Subaru parked among the dense serviceberry bushes. “There are branches piled on top,” he called.
“That and Harry is my brother, not my sister,” John said, and smiled. Sherlock appeared to take this into consideration, clearly wondering how he had got it wrong. “No, no! Just kidding. Though it’s fine, by the way.”
“He means suitcase. Fucking Air Canada.” John commiserated, and smiled. “Time to go. Let’s get you back into town. My guess is the way that’s bleeding, you’re going to need some stitches.” John handed his kit to Tommy, and Archie scrambled to take Sherlock’s pack and discarded shoe.
“Wait!” Sherlock called, and John paused. “
“Oh, the Mounties’ve been all over her office, but I haven’t heard anything yet.” She shook her head. “Asked me loads of questions. She’s always going off to the woods, usually takes someone with her, usually her field tech Kate, but not this time. Most of her plots are south of here, that’s where they’ve been looking.”
That was the last he'd seen of her. And the last he'd seen of his field notes, the only real proof of his discovery, aside from the unverifiable research on his laptop.
“They’re gone, Nino. Do you think you can sit up?” Sherlock brought him water from the truck and they sat together in the dark, swatting mosquitoes and passing the water bottle back and forth.
“I’d bet, eh. Ok, well, better see that doctor.”
This wasn’t the first time he’d been confronted by an angry man with a gun. And, given his basic ability to generally
He bumped down the road, blaring the Beatles and singing along, Gladstone propped against his side. His radio crackled on the dash and he picked up.
“Your uniform…still stiff from soap…she’s not washing your clothes well.” He coughed. “Either she is terrible at laundry or she is taking care of someone else.” Sherlock gulped in air, bracing for another blow. He looked up after a moment, only to see the commander laughing silently.

“There!” Sherlock pointed, dropping one hand to grab the collar of an exuberant Gladstone, who was climbing over him. “It’s in that stand of
“Fantastic!” John said, surprised at the dark whorl of leaves near his feet. “I take it back, that is...amazing.”
Straightening his legs in front of him, he surveyed the damage. The left knee of his trousers was torn and he could see he was bleeding, a dark stain spreading as he watched. He growled in annoyance and pulled a handkerchief from his pocket, folding it in half and tying it around the bleeding wound. One ankle was fine, but the other was protesting loudly and wouldn’t obey his command when he tried to point his toes.
cacorro = fag
Sherlock picked up his phone and glanced down, sneering before he swiped the screen to answer. “What do you want?” Sherlock said peevishly, his phone propped on the dash.
About that little plant Sherlock spotted: finding an endangered species in a patch of forest means that forest now is protected land--so no more logging. Sorry, John.
There were many wildflowers in bloom, and Sherlock had stopped more than once to admire the delicate green inflorescences of the wintergreen
“You already know my name, John, really.” He was rewarded with a wolfish grin.
Sherlock was moving as quickly as he could, despite the increasing humidity of the day and his progressive
He’d already been to two of Irene’s sites, without much to show for it. Yes, there was ginseng growing there, but they were isolated patches in the woods, not telling him much of anything. There was nothing and no one nearby, no smashed vegetation from a fight or struggle, no recent tire tracks in the mud besides his own. He didn’t even see signs of herbivory, though he looked for traces of passing rabbits or deer.
“Wouldn’t be the first time,” John said lightly, as he hoisted Sherlock up by lifting under his arms.

Irene's disappearance was problematic. Their relationship, such as it was, had ended abruptly after he had made the mistake of mentioning the real subject of his research to her one night. They had stood in the cold London air, leaning against the brick to share a cigarette, Sherlock's cocaine high ebbing while the music throbbed behind them.

John wiped his brow, securing one of the chains on the log truck, and looked up towards the woods. Archie, the crew’s tree planter, and Tommy, the swamper, looked up, too.

“Weird name like that? No, I’d notice.” He clutched the bandage on his head just as it threatened to slip down and cover his eye.
“I’m Janine,” she said with another flash of a smile. “Just Janine. Umm,” she paused nervously. “So, you haven’t heard the news, then?”

“Are you all right, Mr. Watson? Sorry to come find you like this, I just had some questions."
He took a deep breath and looked John in the eye.

“Doctor Lestrade?” It was Sally Donovan, his latest graduate student, glaring openly at Sherlock. “Are we still meeting?”
The ginseng itself was in flower and the plants were quite mature. The patch of 15 plants he saw would have been worth hundreds of pounds if it were found and harvested. He had scattered dried leaves over the patch as he left, hoping to keep it hidden from the eyes of hikers or bikers.
“And you’ve called the police,” John stated.
"Irene." It was a warning.
to be here. There wasn’t a safe, was there? He crouched and looked under the desk, and found no sign of a false drawer bottom or any other hiding place. He slid open all the drawers and, in the back of one, he found a small black case. It looked like a pencil case to an untrained eye, but he flipped it open, and sure enough, inside was a handheld GPS unit. He pressed the power button and waited for it to light up.
“Who’s this skinny
“Don’t panic,” Sherlock said quietly to his field assistant, Antonio, who had visibly blanched in the driver’s seat. “Let me handle them.” Antonio shook his head, closing his eyes for a long beat. Sherlock felt beads of sweat break out on his brow.
“Hello, officer,” John said, stepping into the waiting room. “Dr. Sawyer here was just patching me up."
.” He moved to open the door and get out, when John turned back to him.
“Keep talking, Tommy. CALL OUT TO US!” John yelled.
“I stepped in a hole and went arse over tit,” he replied with a grin. “Landed on a rock.” John moved to his ankle and noted how swollen it was.
“I did want to be clear on one thing, though. I’m a forester. Trained before I went off to the Army. I run a logging business, but we’re clearing out trees to reduce the fire risk out here.”
“Well, Sherlock Holmes, let’s get you down off this trail, then.” He pulled out a roll of gauze, then reached for the bandage on Sherlock’s knee. “I’ll take a better look at this when you’re not sitting in the dirt,” he remarked, and untied it to put a wad of bandaging on top, compressing the bleeding wound, glancing up and meeting the calculating gaze again. He looked down and deftly wrapped the knee with the gauze. “Can you tell me what happened?”
“I think he’s less thirsty now,” Janine announced, just as he slid the device into his pocket. “He can keep me company up front in case he needs a top-up.” Sherlock nodded approvingly, and met her in the hallway, closing Irene’s office door behind him.
“Please don’t tell me I have to manage any traumatic amputations.” Sarah looked into the truck and down at Sherlock’s bandaged knee. “Not again.”
He followed the small map as the tarmac ended, his car bumping along. He was less worried about being pulled over now that he was this far back into the woods, though he continued to glance in his rear view mirror for…Mounties? Park rangers? He wondered who would bother to be out here.
“Thanks for seeing him after hours, Sarah.”

“Did they take the radio?” Sherlock nodded soberly. “Okay,

“You got knocked in the head. I’ll stay awake tonight and keep an eye on you. We walk back to town in the morning. Get a mechanic.”

“They know. Mounties are involved.” John was on the edge of the road, tying the neon flagging to an overhanging branch, his shirt lifting to reveal a glimpse of his taut stomach.
“Mounties.” John’s worry was written across his features. “Sarah, can you talk to them? Just…we need a minute.”
“Not so loud. I’m sure they want to ask you about Irene’s car,” Sherlock whispered. “You called them, and they know you are here because your truck is in front. That’s it.”
“Good morning,” he began, “I wonder if you can help me. I’m looking for a friend of mine.” He forced a smile, trying to imagine it reaching his eyes.
“Nope. Just needs some stitching,” John said. “Maybe an X-ray. Sherlock, Dr. Sarah Sawyer, and Sarah, this is Sherlock.”
“Hello, I’m John. Can you tell me your name?”
"If what you're saying is true, it's worth billions of pounds."
“The name is Sherlock Holmes,” he said, and held out his hand. “I’m afraid I’ve sprained my ankle rather badly.” John shook his hand and then slid to his wrist, taking his pulse. His heart rate was elevated.
He looked back at his mobile and checked his texts. The last one from Irene.
“Sure thing, John.” They crashed along through the undergrowth towards the voice, John in the lead now, Tommy calling out at intervals. John could see a flash of white through the woods and knew they were close.
“Not if it could help find her, I’m sure,” Janine said, nodding, and retrieved keys from her desk. “I’ll show you in.” She led Sherlock down the hall, who was quickly calculating how much would be a reasonable amount of time to look like he was helping. “The Mounties tried not to make too much of a mess,” Janine was saying as she unlocked it. “These dear Canadians, trying to be polite even while they turn a place upside-down.”

Word was that she was carrying on with a graduate student 8 years her junior and they’d been frequenting London’s various BDSM clubs, though only Sherlock knew that Irene was the one who’d started the rumours about herself. True, he’d spotted them together, but the clubs were part of his research, it was only a coincidence.
“Those trees jump out in front of ya, do they?” They chuckled together. “Did you touch the car at all?”
Three days ago. Dr Lestrade must have got word quickly. Sherlock hovered near his seat until most of the faculty had left the room, approaching Dr Lestrade swiftly.

“Jesus, Sherlock.”
“John? What is it?”
He watched in what felt like slow motion as the device tumbled down the embankment and came to rest under a honeysuckle bush. He stared at his hands, watching as a mosquito alit on his knuckle and unfurled its proboscis. Pain bloomed in his knee and ankle, rousing him, and he tried to stand. His legs gave way and he slumped back onto the ground, trying to unfold from his painful, crumpled heap.
“Someone’s up there,” Tommy agreed. “IS SOMEONE THERE?” he called, waiting. John heard a chainsaw fire up again and whistled sharply through his teeth, waving at the nearby sawyer to stop. “IS ANYONE THERE?” Tommy tried again in the silence.
He flipped down the driver’s side visor, running his hands through his hair for a moment to be sure he didn’t look too suspiciously dishevelled, though on an academic campus he doubted anyone would mind. The airline had lost his
"Have you found your notes, yet?" Sherlock didn’t reply, his expression growing pinched. "No, of course not. And you haven’t found your Doctor Adler, either. Good luck finding her without my help, and you’ll be needing a new ticket to get yourself home. My guess is you’ve got about…three hours until you are pulled over for driving a car you hired with a nicked credit card."
“Driving home from work. I saw it from the forest road. Tied up some flagging and radioed it in. Looked abandoned.”
“I thought your name was familiar. You poor man, I’m sorry.” She stood and was next to him, resting a hand on his arm. He ignored the feeling of his skin crawling in response and continued trying to look stricken.
“I want know why you’re currently,” there was a pause, “60 kilometres west of
“It’s just that…she’s gone missing.”
“Fieldwork in…?”
“This guy needs stitches, Harry, stop being impossible, over and out.” He switched the radio off and put his truck into gear. “Sorry about that.”
“I’M HERE!” The voice had an accent to it, something British, maybe? He rounded a large beech a moment later and looked down. A man was sprawled on the ground in the loam, his tailored shirt hanging open, muddied trousers tied at the knee with what looked like a bit of silk cloth stained with blood, and wearing leather shoes.
