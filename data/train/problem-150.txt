The news of their relationship broke in the week between Christmas and New Years. They’d been spotted looking rather cosy, John supposed, and their pictures had been plastered all over the papers. Sherlock had clipped the headlines and had them couriered to Mycroft. It rather did beat a chocolate cake.
John was glad that at just that moment, he could snap away, and count to fifteen. Stupid fucking tossers. John turned back. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Ireland. Bosnia. Too many places in Africa to count. The Eastern fucking bloc. Seven. Eight. Nine. He could hear the two men arguing. “--cut off my crime scenes!”
Lestrade nodded. “Sherlock, we can’t stay much longer off the books. Mycroft’s going to talk to the doctors. After that…”
“Nope, you’re both going in.” Greg cut through what he clearly saw as Sherlockian bullshit, “And we’re talking about that cryptic phone call, believe you me.”
On the walk back to the hotel, she texted Mycroft. Needs must, and the kevlar vests soldiers in the field were receiving were subpar, and John, even though he was here on some act of espionage at great risk to his person, was more concerned about better kevlar and injury prevention for the young men and women he worked with in he field. Sherlock had no personal investment in their welfare, and was more concerned about John’s own protection. However, she understood that any member of the armed forces wellness and survival meant a great deal to Great Britain as a whole. That was her rationale to Piecroft, for it was as sound and as commendable as anything.
By the time Sherlock returned from her deduction hour and afternoon run with MacPherson, John had unpacked a rather large set of vintage Globetrotter luggage. They were clearly items that had belonged to some member of the Holmes ancestry on one side or another. They were fashioned out of leather and straps, though they were entirely pristine and their patina was free of stickers or stamps.
John felt like the world’s worst person for telling her, “Sherlock, we cannot keep him.”
“And your pedestrian lover will never leave his wife for you.” Lucy blandly noted, “So now we both know the score, huh?”
He needed a plan, here. A honest, open, plan.
John merely gestured forward as Sherlock shoved her way through the door. Greg was already coming up the side of the wide building in the fading light. Darkness was beginning to fall around them, and it stood to reason that MacPherson had been moved. John was not going to let his mind articulate what had been done with that tape.
“And in his eyes, I will forever be a twelve year old girl with knocking knees and a collection of bunsen burners.” Sherlock surmised as the rounded the corridor and came to a cluster of doors, “You’re in the room next to mine. I felt it best for MacPherson.”
John picked up his bag. It was the only thing that marked him as military, and Sherlock knew in her bones that much of what he was doing was a cover for something bigger in service to his country. It infuriated her. Why should John risk himself? Why, when he was unique amongst all people and there were hundreds of other idiots who were hopped up on patriotism? Why did they deserve the very best the world had to offer?
Like hell they would. Sherlock was a grown woman, and if she wanted to do something she chose to do, Mycroft had exactly zero right to say anything beyond words of support, and even those John knew Sherlock would find puzzling and creepy. The idea that Mycroft had any right to an opinion over any facet of another person’s health was absurd.
Sherlock swanned out of the bathroom, muttering to herself about a lack of conditioners on offer in decontaminating showers. John called out, “Communication is very important, you know!”
He knew, too, that there was an intentional distance between parents and children. The Holmes parents loved their children, but it was clear that they thought them so capable and well-versed that to offer them assistance was beyond consideration. John had long ago wondered why Sherlock never vented or sulked around her parents, and it had become increasingly clear that she did not feel comfortable doing so.
“I do not need security. I need cases!” Sherlock hissed, “If you hadn’t stolen my DI, I would not be in this fix!”
John huffed. “Lucy.”
Feeling like a wrung out flannel but somehow invigorated when he was finished, John was expected to hang around for any further remarks. He noted April lingering in the back of the room, though she seemed to be telling him to stay put. John obeyed this directive, though it was not hard to do with many people wanting to speak to him about points of his speech.
She didn’t even look at him, “Ask your question.”
“I don’t do what’s right for money.” John cut him off, “Consider the fact that I have specialized training I’d theoretically put to use if I deem necessary one of the quirks of my personality, and we’ll get along.”
He looked rather sheepish, “I sat down to work on some paperwork and realized that I’d written down what I’d heard. I meant to toss it, but perhaps there is a providential reason I forgot.” He extended a folded piece of paper, “Maybe it will jog your memory.”
John couldn’t help but ask, “Someone said that to you?”
Adopting the ideal persona for her mission, she addressed the waitress. She blunted parts of her accents so as to slide from public school to utterly forgettable, and asked, “That man in the corner. He asked me to flag you, said you looked terribly busy, and if it wasn’t too much trouble, could he have some PG Tips?”
“Meaning she helped Harry get sober, arranged for various governmental inquests during the war…” John reached for his gloves where they were stuffed in his pockets, unwilling to reveal more private interventions. “I should thank her.”
John wanted to snigger like a twelve year old boy at the good natured joking, but he paused. The look of confusion on Sherlock’s face was clear for a moment, just before her brain put together the insinuation, and she primly fiddled with her eyepiece.
John picked up the brush, and looked at MacPherson's curly hair. “Well, we should probably find you a different comb. You’ll frizz, mate.”
“I call that predatory, not simple.” John was fixated on the fact that Victor had been pursuing her for years without her consent, “You’re not required to put up with that, ever.”
John wanted to go home to the farm, but he wasn’t ready. He wasn’t mature enough. He didn’t yet know who he was, nor had he yet cured the restlessness that consumed his soul. “My future’s in London, for now.”
Sherlock had expanded her Mind Palace since October. She had left Cambridge for New York in December, and had been here since, Ph.D. in hand. Molly was due to land this afternoon for what she called a ‘girls weekend.’ She had not dissuaded Molly from the notion that she had gone through a breakup after getting something Molly called a reverse ‘Dear John’ letter.
“I…” John knew that from earliest childhood, Sherlock had been educated by example in terms of sociability, and been quite contented to do the logical thing rather than the expected thing. However, it had never occurred to him that she had made a scientific study of social behaviors. Then again, doing so was really only logical, at least from Sherlock’s worldview. He could hardly imagine her speed dating.
“I’ve had enough practice.” John replied, putting MacPherson’s bed down in the corner. He unearthed his bowls as Sherlock measured his food, medication, and supplements. MacPherson hopped around happily, and underneath his happy munching, John felt the electricity in the air.
They had long ago released a statement that they did not want pictures of MacPherson popping up on the web, or being sold to the press. MacPherson hadn’t chosen their path, and he would not suffer for it, not when people coming up to him made him anxious from time to time. Pasting a smile on as he freed MacPherson and used his body to ruin any photos of the dog, they three headed inside to go to see Mrs. Hudson. John was keen for a bit of assurance that she would be well in their absence. Mrs. Hudson was happy to have their farewells, but seemed fixated on the traffic in only the way that someone with no pressing schedule could go on about the potentialities of sitting on the motorway for ages. The prospect of a bored Sherlock in a car was horrifying, and John hoped the traffic reports held true.
“Right.” She began to tap away on her computer with spanking clean and clipped nails, “Well, this is a commercial port, held to the highest of international standards. Were there anything of that nature here—”
“Don’t…” Sherlock seemed to be shaken by the reference to her data, “Don’t unless…this is not a game, John. Don’t do this unless you want it.”
Of course, the evening papers were filed with news of Victor’s duplicity and his death. John was almost certain his father would be bringing some kind of spurious suit, so he left a message for their much beleaguered legal professional, and tried to keep his head down in the London crowds. He was spotted twice on the tube, and accosted in the Tesco Express. John felt that he was rather aggressively hounded for getting the milk, boneless chicken breasts, and some garlic, but what did he know?
With a quick glance at Sherlock, John prepared to take their new friend by surprise. Easily enough, just before the man could call out, John had him by the throat, “I’m going to be nice and let you go, but you’re going to stay where I put you, yeah?”
John let his spinning head loll back against the bed. The nurse came back in a minute to collect his refuse and asked him, “How’s your pain level, Captain?”
Sherlock looked at him as if to question his sanity. “I was a debutante.”
“No, darling.” Mummy replied, “John is my guest. You are, and shall ever remain, my only beloved daughter. As such, you carry your own luggage whilst you are under my roof.”
“You think—” John laughed in outright shock, “I’m fully aware, Sherlock.”
“I cannot think what you would presume to use as cause.” Sherlock declared, shoving her hands back into mittens like a sensible person, “It is perfectly reasonable to be out for a stroll.”
“Are you kidding?” Greg blurted as they headed for the door, out into the wintery night, “She’d just glare and put salt in your coffee.”
John still felt like he had sand in his socks, even in dress shoes and not his thick boots. He felt strange in New York. It was weird to be in America, where the war was almost a non-entity in that people went along with their daily lives without fear of bombs and sunburn. He didn’t have to worry so much about watching his cover, but John would have preferred to be in a sandstorm that at the UN HQ. He was never one for much of playing nice, though of course he knew how to do it. He’d been raised with Harriet Watson, after all, and spent his life smoothing over her indiscretions.
John was certain she would mention nothing of that, not here, anyway. He simply hid any confusion, and replied, “I see?”
John easily surmised that James had, out of concern, stuck his nose in her personal affairs. When James’s assistant headed out of the bar, John took the final gulp of his beer, “I’ve warned off a girl or two from Harry in my time.”
“Alright!” Greg cried as bodies moved around them, “I want to know just what the hell is going on here, before—”
Sherlock’s lithe figure shifted as she remained sitting, to address him softly. “You can take the left side.”
Sherlock spoke then, “Not a friend, then. Relative. Cousin. Maternal side. Two degrees. You’re a doctor. Same age as John. You like me.”
“Well.” John rocked back on his heels, “Nan’s going on a bit of holiday to Greece and needs someone up at the farm. I rather thought we might make a holiday of it.”
John paid for the milk and biscuits in cash, and headed home, avoiding eye contact with the Baker Street memorabilia now stocked in the shop.
He didn’t want to give her control over him. He didn’t reply to her question, because he had no intention of opening himself up to her, even if this little conversation hadn’t been a test. She was not his ally.
Lestrade hopped out of the car and came running. A man with an umbrella followed at a more sedate pace. Umbrella Man had been around barracks a lot lately. John had heard through the grapevine that he was conducting a security assessment. John called him Umbrella Man because he never went anywhere without that thing.
She had only just begun going on about -9.8m/s^2 when the silver frame hit the floor. Just like that, her ire was focused in a new direction and she came bolting out of the room as John picked up the photograph of a grinning Sherlock and Mycroft at some college do. “Must you be so clumsy?”
“It was lucky that I saw Skinny Pete…” John murmured.
“Weapon?” Sherlock demanded, studying everything about the placement of Gloria’s body.
Shot in the shoulder. Shattered. Broken leg, in two places, compound fracture. He had significant soft tissue, probably some bruised organs. He was relatively confident he no longer had a spleen. He was superficially banged up. John refused to let himself consider anything but the facts of his situation. He was not going to make guesses about his prognosis, not even when they were educated. Based on his awareness, he would venture to guess that he needed at least two more surgeries.
Sherlock was tense, and stepped away to have a word with Mycroft. John had observed the flurry of messages and assumed that the older Holmes had a case for his sister. John hoped he knew that like the blogger, the dog was a package deal, and if he wanted Sherlock’s help it, he would take it the way she was comfortable offering it, or not at all.
She turned and stalked away, muttering about freaks. She rather reminded Lucy of Petunia Dursley. Or Vernon. Yes, Vernon.
“Perhaps it would be more merciful to shoot you dead.” Sherlock mused, patting MacPherson as she finished slicing the tape on his back legs, “Then again, you deserve only the mercy you extend.”
Somehow John knew the accent had been genuine. His gut knew that, somehow. She was British, and she hadn’t tried to hide an accent, which meant she hadn’t cared who connected them, who remembered her. She hadn’t thought to put together any sort of cover. It rankled John that as a spy he wasn’t even worth a clean kill.
The hotel staff was already looking Sherlock’s way. Set the smoke alarm off once, and these imbeciles never left one alone. She could have gotten a flat, but the committee insisted she be here for the final rehearsals as part of international bonding and togetherness. Sherlock had met at least two semi-passable young women with whom to converse and deduce, so at least the stricture wasn’t altogether absurd.
As he did, he saw in the eerily lit entrance, massive amounts of spray painted concrete to enter into the drain, a rushing river of water flowing on the ground between his now-separated feet.
John woke with a start.
“When he returns to London, he will be in need of a new profession.” Mycroft broke this news in his cold, impersonal way. Sherlock did not blame him personally. She blamed so many others that the only person to which she could affix her rage was herself.
There were so many boxes that Sherlock often dreamed of them burying her, of drowning in the knowledge and truth of John Watson. It was sometimes enough to make her brain slow and her breathing even. When everything was too much or not enough, she surrounded herself with every bit she had of John Watson, and for a single second, she felt enough balance to go onward. It was simply that she had been deducing John for years, and the way she organized him in her mind reminded her of systems and logical deduction.
John’s sleep was deep, and calm. He woke in the dark, to the sound of a pen moving against paper next to him. He cracked an eye to make Sherlock writing down a composition with fluid movements.
He did not like how HM’s official birthday mucked with his routines. He had a certain personal gratitude to the occasion, that was true, but he hardly wanted tourists filling London in preparation for said event on the one night he hoped to get home early. In any case, if push came to shove, he’d commander the black car that seemed to trail him overly obviously on date nights. He wasn’t above taking advantage of Mycroft’s childish teasing.
John had not been able to do anything reach out to various contacts. He had made some progress, but felt useless. There had been no communication. He knew the ports and motorways were on alert, but what little Carter had been able to remember about the vehicle had yielded nothing thus far. Evie had driven a shaken Carter home for the night.
Sherlock found she could not muster up anger towards John. Anger would be rational. And yet, she could not be angry. He was happy. There was a lightness to his bearing that told Sherlock he felt that he was on top of the world, and there was nothing she could deduce to detract from that finding. John was being sensible.
And…he walked right by her, unseeing, not noticing her. That absolute prat! How could he care more about making polite chat with some American political blonde? How could he do this to her? Sherlock fumed as her guide escorted her to the lifts, only to find that the APB and John boarded the same lift.
“Despite your assertions, I am a grown woman.” Sherlock snapped, her ire clear even through her door and the space between them. It was almost enough to make John wince. “I will be back around ten. Please do attempt to clear out by then. I have to correlate data relating to cigarette ash.”
She grinned over at Sherlock, and the implication was not lost on him.  “So am I.”
John nodded, “He has what he needs, what he wants, and there’s where his contentment is rooted. We could go to China and he’d still be as at home as we are in Baker Street.”
“No?” The word came out confused, as though John had spoken the refusal in Farsi.
John knew Debbie, but he did not want to get drawn into an hour’s worth of conversation with Mickey about everything under the sun. Mickey was one to talk, and talk, and talk. John had been tempted to thank Sherlock on the many occasions she’d told him in no uncertain terms to be quiet, but poor Mickey was a bit afraid of Sherlock. Well, that, or bowled over by her. John knew it to be both, and hardly blamed the kid. Sherlock would have terrified him at Mickey’s age.
John knew that Sherlock and Molly had made friends largely because Sherlock had found companionship within the graduate students in her various subjects, though he had only ever  known Molly to be a lasting relationship from those days. “Molly?”
Sherlock’s confusion was as adorable as John’s shock.
John floundered, wondering if he should take the chair to wait until MacPherson fell asleep. In the slanted light spilling faintly into the window, John felt as though he were here on a hit. He’d sooner die than hurt Sherlock, but he knew that this moment, whatever it was, was changing him as war had changed him.
They smiled at the security and made sure to mention that Walter had sent them. John still couldn’t believe that the walrus’s name was Walter. He’d called him Vernon in his head. The security staff escorted them right to the door of Michael’s on-ship dining room.
John wondered how the hell Harry was paying for a place like this, one of the most cutting-edge rehab facilities in Europe, but he figured that Mum had seen sense and taken out a policy. Though there had been no help with her funeral costs, he was glad to see that Mum’s last gift to them both had been the chance to have each other once again.
John caught snippets of their conversation, fleeting words about this and that, topics he wasn’t able to follow as he went up and down the stairs in multiple trips. Sherlock’s voice lilted crisply over Nan’s comfortable tones, but John heard joy in their voices that was genuine and unrestrained. He wished he’d thought to linger in the doorway, because conversation died when he came into the room.
John knew he wouldn’t eat, so he tried to force himself to eat bland foods he could pack with calories. He couldn’t jump out and carry a dozen eggs, a loaf of bread, his gun, and his Tim Tam. Damn if he was leaving his one treat behind. Oddly, all of these counter surveillance efforts made him hungry.
John looked away from Sherlock and back at Greg. He knew what was coming, he just hadn’t expected it be coming in this moment. John thought Greg would give Sherlock some time to retreat into her Mind Palace, to process, to think, to analyze, to plan. She needed that space, but it was clear that Greg was not prepared to offer her any of it.
“We’ve more interesting things to listen to today,” John smiled, turning on the doppler wand as the young woman lifted her oversized shirt quickly. John placed the doppler wand, and in a moment or so after finding a heartbeat, spoke, “Like young Timothy.”
Quickly, and yet so slowly that Sherlock wanted to scream, she was let out in front of the building that would lead her to the ICU. Her phone had a floor, and the name of a person who was to meet her. Still, when she went inside, there was someone waiting for her directly. He was a man religious, who believed in a God of goodness despite the fact that he stood on the front line of a war and witnessed carnage and loss. Sherlock kept her deductions to herself.
Sherlock tapped send.
“Just for that I won’t tell you that Mummy has a scheme all cooked up.” Lestrade informed him, “I’ll let you flounder and try to wiggle out of a week in the country.”
John swallowed his tea. She was involved with this somehow, she of the blue dress and the bluer eyes.
It was just that to Victor. He fired shots without thought and consideration, killed anything that moved. He’d unflinchingly pushed off illegal kills onto other hunters in the party. He moaned about ear protection, moaned about everything, really. John had observed an endorphin rush in him way outside of the range of normal responses to hunting. His instincts were confirmed. John wondered if he was overreacting when he decided he was staring at a killer. Mrs. Scott could well be alive, and so John withheld that conclusion.
“I doubt he could snap anything with his bones, but it did, somehow,” John admitted, “seem fitting.”
John watched as the waitress finally approached him. She had a shy look on her face and was already carrying a tray for another table, but made a point to stop here first. She was eyeing him speculatively, and John found that it had been a long time since he’d seen a woman who wasn’t either a patient or a fellow solider or doctor. John wasn’t interested in a good time with a student on gap year from Manchester, though she had a penchant for older men who were mysterious due to commitment issues. Hence, John concluded, the gap year, when she couldn’t take the plunge on going to her final year Uni. In the first place, he hardly had the time or inclination for a girlfriend, and in the second, he didn’t have the energy for a shag.
That said, John made a large gesture of moving the phone away from his ear.
“I said no!” Sherlock screamed, and underneath it, John heard something breaking in her voice. He knew that Mycroft had to have heard it as well, and before he knew what he was about he’d thrown open the door. There was a time for shock and awe, and this was one of those times. Sherlock was enraged, white-faced, and standing, spine ram-rod straight by the fireplace, as Mycroft sat at his desk, with yet another of his damn files. John wanted to grab the damn thing and make him eat it, shove it down his throat. Rage surged, cool and clarifying, in his blood.
Before Sherlock could make her displeasure more fully known, a woman of color in a sleek summer jacket came to the entry. “It’s not a bomb.”
He hurried away, back into the hive of people. Sherlock looked at the desk at the front of the ward, and back at the locked doors that she had come through mere seconds ago. Swallowing, she approached the desk. The nurse looked up. She deduced, however badly, that she had not been expecting a young woman wearing workout kit, flats, and a horribly tatty Barbour, who was mumbling to herself unless spoken to in direct tones.
Sherlock rarely wanted Greek. They almost never had it. John revealed this as he rifled through the menus, providing this information so as to promote conversation. He looked up, triumphant at having found the menu in the haphazardly arranged stack, and found that there was front in Sarah’s eyes.  Ah, well, he knew how to make up for whatever gaffe he’d committed.
“Sherlock, the glasses are meant for you, not the dog.” John sighed. It was too bloody early in the morning for this drama. He was of half a mind to put something on the blog just to shut people up, but everyone who needed to know they were together had known for some time.
“Oh, shut up.” Sherlock bit out, “Why would I want
John stepped inside. Books lined the wall behind him, and a man in a bespoke suit with an umbrella by his side gestured to the opposite chair, “Dr. Watson.”
“Look. I was going to take the cash in the morning.” Weston began, “Take the fucking dog. I don’t give a shit. I got my money. I don’t need their business anyway.”
And yet, here he was, in June, wearing his bloody dress uniform, at Trooping the Colour. John wasn’t a fool. When a box lands at your front door, with an engraved invitation from the Powers that Be, you dust off your medals and report for duty. It was the Queen’s official birthday, and if someone demanded on her behalf that John be there, he was not going to question it.
John wasn’t sure what to make of Sherlock’s behavior. MacPherson was still in the veterinary hospital, and Sherlock had hacked their security cameras to observe his living space. She watched the feed continually, making notes and bringing up various concerns on her daily visit. John glanced down at her notebook, a moleskin that was plum, and had spidery writing on the cover: MWH. John pondered the monogram for a long second, wondering what middle name she had given the dog. Something like Wisteria, surely, given her family history of floral names.
They headed companionably down the stairs, stopped for a biscuit and a pat at Mrs. Hudson’s, and began to walk down Baker Street. The Boots was right next to the station, and so they made quick work of purchasing the essentials John had previously considered.
“I sat on the sofa.” Sherlock then recounted various medical responses, the rate of her breathing, how many times she blinked, her pulse rate, the way she began to sweat and feel increasing nausea as her blood pressure slowly dropped as the drug took effect. She then continued on, “Victor ransacked my room, my things, until he found my shelf of notes. He didn’t chiefly want my chemistry notes, though he took them in a box when he left and made significant use of them, which led to his dismissal.”
“Your work!” Trevor snapped, adopting a girlish tone that was manic, “‘I’m married to my work, Victor. I’ve no time for men, Victor, I love only the work.’” Victor’s eyes darted between them as the shoe dropped, and John realized that the work to which Sherlock had been referencing was him. She had cleverly told the truth, and kept herself away from Victor.
As John made his way towards the kitchen, he was stopped another five times. One person wanted him to look at a scrape, another had a rash, and so on and so forth. John answered what he could then and there, and told the others that as soon as he saw to the people who had asked for a moment of his time first.
“Of course.” The Landstuhl chaplain’s phone buzzed, and he looked bereft for a second before he hid it, in service to what he considered his duty, “You will excuse me, for a moment?”
The dream he’d been having was reality. He opened his eyes to find that the sun was peeking through the window, and that MacPherson was lounging on the sofa in the corner. For his part, John had his arms wrapped around Sherlock’s body, her slim frame pressed to his own. Carefully, hating himself, John extricated his hold, and freed his feet from the tangle of sheets and blankets. It took him a long moment, because he was loathe to interrupt her slumber, something she found so rarely. He was also, he knew, loathe to let go.
Anyway, she wasn’t serious about consulting with them. It was just fun to rile John. And, on the upside, she could start planting surrogacy ideas. Good providers went fast, and nobody got the drop on a Woodbine.
John broke into laughter as Sherlock’s eyes narrowed in glee. “You made him work for information?”
John cut off the phone. It was abundantly clear to Lucy that no one ever told him how to silence the thing. Lucy looked over, trying to peer at his texts, but before she could see anything, it buzzed again.
“I was an officer, Sherlock, and I grew up principally on a farm. Some of my earliest memories—” John broke off, those memories more painful than even the darkest days in the Army. He was okay talking about the council estate, there was no shame in his mother’s struggle to do her best, but he had never found a way to talk about the farm.
John felt himself biting down a grin as he spied something sticking out of the DI’s bag, where he’d left it on the only clean space on the counter. There was a file sticking out of it. “That your file, then?”
“Basically.” Greg agreed, rising and adjusting his own coat and scarf, “He sent you that invitation to Trooping the Colour. Sherlock went ballistic. She said we were forcing you when you were vulnerable. She never once manipulated your free will, though I will admit she did…arrange a few things in your life to her satisfaction.”
However, one does as one must, and she tolerated the process that marked her as an official visitor. She had long ago discerned that it was time to introduce herself to John, and if that meant attending a meeting about what she herself might do on behalf on the United Nations, she was willing to do it. After all, if things went according to her present conjectures, there was every reason she should be based in the Middle East, and she might as well go with something worthwhile to do between cases. Damn Aunt Marian for insisting she learn how to be charitable. It was something she found she valued, though of course so long as it didn’t interfere with the Work.
She would go and stay with Aunt Sophie or get a flat, depending on the location.  No matter what, she intended to get a position at the hospital where John ended up spending his convalesce. He would not wish to know her as he coped with the trauma he had experienced, but she assured herself that she would be nearby. She would stand for nothing less.
John chuckled, “What, a one-stop shop for anyone’s medical and deductive needs?”
John’s expression shifted, and he knew his thoughts were easily read. He could not just flee to go romp around the garden. Sherlock had lost her shoes at some point, and her stockinged feet were bare in the grass. Clearly, they both knew she had the better end of the stick, though it jarred John a little bit to see her quite so free so soon after their arrival.
He’d been in the field for about three months and two days, six hours, and forty-seven minutes when a letter came. John stuffed it in his pocket and forgot about it until he was halfway through shoveling some cottage pie into his sunburnt face. Murray was chatting with Gupta about something or other, and so John felt comfortable opening the letter at the table.
The beefy man, weak as a walrus, nodded as John drove him easily to his knees on the floor, “I don’t want no drama.”
She hopped off of her stool, and went to a crooked mirror, hanging partly off the wall, near her front door, swinging her arms as she did so.
Good man. John surveyed the crowd. Maybe giving an unstable man a gun and the ability to scream at people wasn’t the best idea.
“Well, we’ve got two away on holiday this week, and one’s just left to have a baby. Might be a bit mundane for you.” She hedged, and John knew that he had it in the bag. Thank God.
John would never tell, but the blog that was most astute regularly received blinds from a source in the know, one who was sitting across the table from him. Sherlock said that if her Aunt Mari was going to force her to play nice with celebrities for charity, at least she should get something out of it. John thought it one of her more benign hobbies. He could have lived, however, without knowing that his favorite singer was actually a shit human being.
Still, they had a plan. Sherlock’s brain had taken over, and her deductions had flown thick and fast. She was focused as a laser, and as deadly as a missile. What John knew now about Michael Weston was enough to make his blood boil. Government reports came through quickly when he had a name. Had he waited another twenty minutes, he would have had voice-matching evidence rendering a name unneeded, but time was of the essence.
John blinked hard. He wasn’t hearing this, was he? Some brilliant, blindingly amazing, nutter was standing before him. John took in the £1000 coat the man wore over a bespoke suit. Certainly Seville Row. Bond street, maybe? John knew enough, given the fucking class divide in Her Majesty's Army. He could pass, if he had to, and he made it a point never to have to do so. He’d earned his rank, his degrees, same as any public school boy.
He’d done his Army training at Bart’s, and they were glad to have him as volunteer, even though they couldn’t offer him a job on staff as a consultant. He was considering locum work, but the idea filled John with apathy. He was trying very hard to listen to his feelings.
MacPherson looked happily to Sherlock, and John supposed that the dog must be happy simply to hear her voice. John was glad to be corrected and know that it was not human hair she was examining under her microscope.
“That’s what you think.” Sherlock hopped down from her stool, “I’ve decided your plan is adequate. Mrs. Hudson’s flat is vacant. 221B Baker Street. 7 o’clock.”
There was a loud thud that had John on his feet, and spinning around carefully so that he was on the defensive, ready to grab his gun, instinct and training coming to the fore. Two people, John gathered from the sounds coming down the hall. Someone, a male, was shouting for another person to stop. The second person was lighter, faster, but was moving with a slightly hesitant, pained, quality. There was a scuffle in the hallway.
Sherlock stared straight ahead, and began to set the scene very factually. “I did not willingly relinquish my data or my notes. I was very close to the final breakthrough on an extraction process I had been perfecting for my dissertation. As ever, Victor was present in the lab.”
MacPherson entered 221B Baker Street under his own power, medicated and groggy, but aware all the same of the changes in his life. After weeks in hospital, he walked into his new home with something of a patchy grooming job, wearing a collar given to him by Sherlock’s father, fashioned by whomever made his saddles. John had to admit that the giant of a dog looked quite sporting.
Pete let food fall off of his fork as he spoke, “There's this guy who came around, not sure what to do about warning the others. Any advice?”
Sherlock seemed to notice this, because she made Sarah no offer to pet the dog that had once again returned to chewing his bone. It was entirely evident by the way that she was clutching her bag that she wanted nothing to do with MacPherson.
Running a hand over his face, John knew it was probably his eyes. Nan had always said he had an old soul’s eyes. She was a bit airy fairy about things, but she meant well and she always tried to give him space to talk about what he was going through across his life. There was nothing he could do about them. He knew he’d hardly seen war, and had only been working with oversight as a doctor, but he knew his choices in life had changed him. He would never lose the solider’s glint in his eyes, not even when humbled by the random gift of a stranger, who expected nothing in return.
“I thought this was a food kitchen…” John blinked back at her, wondering how he had just stumbled into a job offer, “Do you employ—”
John readily agreed to the week in the country once Sherlock had done so. MacPherson would have ample space to run  and play, and he would get a week to clear his head and consider what on earth had happened in Mycroft’s study. It would also give Sherlock some time to ride her horses, experiment in her lab in one of the outbuildings, and perhaps sleep more than three hours a night while exploring local cases that came her way.
John watched Mr. McGowan study them both for a single second. He stepped forward and took the horse from Sherlock after nodding once, leading the horse away, muttering to himself about dinner for the horses.
“Sherlock.” John did not want her to explain elementary bomb making to a bunch of suits. There were things even they did not need to know. “Your mold cultures...”
In her haste, she knocked into a body who was also headed for her spot, her spot with cell reception, colliding chest to chest with a stocky man wearing a button-down. A steely hand with a gentle grip steadied her, and her apple juice, just before the force knocked her backwards, “You alright there, Luce?”
He picked up the menu card, and his hand shook. John stilled his involuntary show of fatigue quickly. He hadn’t slept in something like three days, and now, on his one day ‘off’ he was trying in vain to keep a normal schedule so that tomorrow wouldn’t be so rough. It was going to be difficult. He simply had to compartmentalize and consider tomorrow another new start, and hope that he could land on his feet. He needed to stop thinking, just for five bloody seconds, and he’d hoped a cafe stuffed with people to observe would distract him.
He’d sworn not to tell her anything they’d discussed. He hadn’t been there to ask permission or for a blessing after all. He’d been there on Father’s invitation, as the man had warnings to issue. John knew well why. If Mummy knew, Sherlock would know. They hadn’t even discussed the possibility. John didn’t want to leap and land on his face. He thought a few conversations were the best way to come to a joint, mutual, decision. He wasn’t saying they had to happen this week, but he wasn’t going to pass the opportunity by if they did come round.
He didn’t know why, but he hadn’t been able to pick out the patron that had sent him this meal that reminded him of home. Everyone he’d glanced at hadn’t fit the profile, though there was an empty table just out of his line of sight that called to John. He’d not noticed who was sitting there, but he knew his benefactor had been in that seat before slipping into the crowds, unnoticed but not unappreciated. Though it should have put him on alert, it calmed something within him. Maybe, just maybe, he didn't see everything. The reminder that he was not always as analytical as he had been trained to be reminded John that there was more to him than
“John is no longer my concern. As you say. he never was my concern in the first place.” Sherlock insisted, trying not to let her mind recall all of those hateful discussions at Christmas. Why she had ever gone home was beyond her. “I refuse to continue this conversation unless you tell me why you have chosen now, after all this time, to discuss him.”
“The operative term being ‘was.’” Sherlock replied, “I solved it. Now.” She held up two dresses, the same except for the color, “Cornflower or bittersweet?”
John was done.
“Mycroft.” It was then that John gained the satisfaction of ratting the elder Holmes out to his partner. He’d seen him around before, but had always called him Umbrella Man.  “I thought you promised to let him figure his friendships out by himself. He’s a big boy, doesn’t need us setting up playdates anymore. Poor sod.”
He refused to admit it to himself, but he liked to think that if there had been a mass hallucination in the ICU at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, that it had been she of the care packages. Of course, that was utter insanity. John chose to believe that whatever was coming his way, that he would know it when he saw it. Whether or not he’d be able to face it was another question entirely.
John blinked. Had he been flirting? He didn’t think so. He’d only ever flirted during his ops.  “I wasn’t aware that I was flirting.”
Getting involved with the peer support program was tough emotionally, sometimes, but that didn’t mean he hid from it. One evening as he was packing up and returning the meeting room to rights, there came a knock on the closed door. John called out, “It’s open!”
Gossip John overheard said Trevor’s mother lived most of the year in Italy. No one blamed her. John would have fled the Western hemisphere to avoid Victor, had he been his parent. As breakfast concluded and Molly’s bargaining chatter had eventually relented to hand over the fingers, Victor came to them. He pulled out the empty chair next to Sherlock and sank down, taking ownership of the space in the way that spoke to his very fragile masculinity.
“You were in an industrial kitchen.” Sherlock rattled off a few more facts, including the fact that Janet had an orange cat, and quickly came to the conclusion that he had been providing medical services there, “I will allow you to tell me your news in your own fashion, so as to preserve communication and allow for emotional bonding.”
They passed the evening in companionable silence. John took MacPherson for a run, blogged, and pretended not to watch the trashy show Sherlock was decidedly not watching. He considered it a win when the bowl of ice cream he’d pressed into her hands was mindlessly consumed before MacPherson sniffed at the dish.
Sherlock was sitting with her microscope, the only thing she’d unpacked herself. “I’m off, Sherlock.”
They were done. Greg shut off the recording devices, but he did not remind them of dinner, or sigh and tell them to call when they got home. Sherlock did not remove the ice he’d all but shoved under her crisp shirt after their decontamination showers and patching her up, nor did she stand.
It was her.
“It’s your fault, or were you so busy inserting cake into your face that your forgot?” Sherlock hefted her bag, and pulled out her phone. She had banking arrangements to put into place, and she did not need meddling getting in the way of her plans.
“Right, then.” John tried to shove away feeling as though he’d asked Sherlock to live with him. This had to be work. She wanted a doctor to assist her cases, her family wanted his army background for her safety. Sherlock didn’t want him. “So you’ll move? Somewhere with, uh, space?”
It was then that John saw, via the lantern light, the pitiful body she was cradling in her lap, above the water. He was a waterlogged mite of a dog, who moved pitifully toward the ink-stained fingers that were gently patting his matted coat, if his patches of fur could be considered a coat.
“MacPherson’s been abducted.” John was already out the door doing a sweep. There were tyre tracks in the grass, as though his abductor had peeled out of there quickly. He berated himself for being so focused on Sherlock that he’d observed nothing of note on their journey home. John spotted something in the grass, and felt his gut clench. MacPherson’s moose was being pecked at by one of the more dotty chickens.
“The tents were nicer than your hellhole.” John returned. They’d spent the night on their feet, and John was glad, if only because it meant having the ability to avoid her apartment.
He’d arranged their absence from NSY with Lestrade, recruited a few friends to cover his practice, and made sure the farm had acceptable internet speeds. He’d begun the process of hiring a car, but as per usual, keys had shown up in the post before he could call the firm back to arrange details. He and MacPherson had been a team in planning it all, even if MacPherson was something of a silent partner.
“He is a lovely boy.” Nan returned, ordering Chowley to stay in his basket, “He changed lightbulbs all through the house and moved the sofas before rolling back the carpet in Spring.”
Mummy was watching them with interest, and John knew in an instant that she had set both he and Mycroft up, and she was killing two birds with one stone via this exchange. John hoped the information would serve her well, because as a guest in her home, he would play the game to a respectable extent. It was, in a way, a hostess gift.
“Hardly. I will, however, assist you in facilitation.” Sherlock declared, as MacPherson’s panting resounded around the flat, “MacPherson, please do not try to fit yourself in Grandmere’s  suitcase, you are not a liquid.”
John slid in, cane first, and shut the door. The driver ignored him. John knew he could overtake the car easily. There was only one man, and he had to drive. Dispatching him would be child’s play, as would taking over the driving. How shoddy was this operation? John wanted to laugh.
Sherlock merely chuckled and headed up the stairs. “You have to be up hideously early for the shoot.”
Sherlock deduced him for a single second, and nodded, reaching for her mug of tea. John fleetingly hoped she’d gotten enough fluids today. It was extremely easy to become dehydrated in the winter, and tea was a diuretic. Sherlock huffed fondly.
John saw the thick tome in Sherlock’s grasp, clutched to her chest from where she was tied to a kitchen chair. There were countless other notebooks on the table, each and every one flipped open and rifled through or shoved aside to find the one she was clutching protectively. Thick piles of findings and reports had been shoved to the floor around their kitchen table to find the correct book, and he could see Sherlock in his mind’s eye almost falling upon the table to make sure that one book end safe in her grasp. It was that gesture that told John everything he needed to know.
John had been to this cafe only once before, but he’d kept it in his back pocket for moments like this one. It sometimes helped to have a place to go where he wasn’t working and this place was banal and nondescript enough to be overlooked on a busy street. The small space was easily scanned for safety, and the crowded occupancy meant anything anyone said was not likely to be overheard without equipment John would probably spot.
Not, of course, that this was a game. He knew what this was, what she, in all likelihood was. After all this setup was textbook, so textbook that he could see his instructors, and hear them lecturing about...John did not give further thought to those memories. They were classified. Best to keep up the front, all the while knowing that these were basic tactics, taught the first week.
John was a bit bemused by her reaction to a simple database combing. She hadn’t really seen the gamut of what he could have done, and intended to do, to bring Victor down,
They went round and round in this fashion. Sherlock wanted to deduce them all to a pile of rubble, and perhaps she did, at least to Marshall and his cronies on this panel. It was only logical that those in this room who held them in esteem understood that they were the embodiment of the issues facing the NHS and their medical community in general.
Never again would Weston and his superiors make an animal suffer. If seeing to that made John a bad person, then so be it. He had long ago made peace with the darkness inside of him. He would not be silent in the face of these abuses. The courts would never, and could never, track down and charge people with enough power to disappear at will and assume identities as easily as he bought a new jumper on Etsy.
“Sure.” Murray agreed, “You shouldn’t look so horrified about the idea. They don’t call you Three Continents Watson because you fuck everything that moves, John. You’re the marrying type, you just don’t know it.”
Carefully, Sherlock shepherded MacPherson into the car, so as provide him with a safe place to rest, see his people, and be out of the range of nosey parkers snapping pictures. So began the hard work of shoving, stuffing, and pushing. Between the two of them, they got the boot to close. Primly, Sherlock placed her hatbox and train case on the bench seat beside a wagging MacPherson. John took a scant second to check Twitter, and noted that his blog account, which had been blue checked in the last few months, was blowing up with speculation as to their destination. People were split 50/50 on their reasons for leaving Baker Street, with neither the work or play winning out in the debate.
MacPherson was with Molly, largely because Sherlock and John both knew they were in deep. MacPherson was not allowed within a mile of this case, and they were of the opinion that if anything happened, at least the dog would be safe. “Why would you bring a dog out in this, Greg?”
Sherlock licked her lips gently, “I’m sure this is being recorded, somewhere.”
Fifteen. Fifteen and five. What the everlasting hell? Sherlock was young enough to still be in Uni. What had happened? She was brilliant, with a mind made for deep thinking. A university might stifle her, but it was also a place he’d bet she’d love if left to explore her own mind rather than what some tutor told her she needed to know.
“Oh, don’t be an agony aunt, John.” Sherlock demanded, her voice low and for his ears only as she moved slightly closer to facilitate conversation, “Victor’s motives are simple. He hates women, hates that I am his better in every possible way, and he thinks that a sexual relationship would assert his dominance.”
Mycroft grumbled, looking away from where he was conferring with his father over grouse John had intentionally scared off to better observe Victor under the stress of not getting what he wanted, not that they knew why the poor things had startled and bolted. “Gregory, don’t encourage him.”
There was never any name, never any personal interaction, though she seemed more open over time. However, John could not help but feel he was being given glimpses into this woman’s soul. He had to remind himself on several occasions that she was likely married, working in a governmental office, prone to indulging in sweets, and was also possibly gay. Still, it was good to have a friend. Being half in love with someone he’d never met was his own damn problem and he wasn’t going to let his weirdness cloud something good.
John berated himself for not seeing the dried blood on her trouser leg before now. Inwardly, he knew a tetanus booster was the first order of the day. By now, it was after eleven, and he wasn’t about to haul her to the A&E.
Sherlock looked down at the journal Grandmere had given her two Christmases ago, upon the occasion of her thirteenth year. A young lady, Grandmere had said, deserved a sacred space for her innermost thoughts and feelings. Though Sherlock did not wish to waste paper on such banal things, she did tuck it away until a case arose that suited its format. Sherlock had only unearthed this book when the idiot Mycroft had set something into motion. After much consideration, she was ready to add to her body of research.
“Are you attempting with any level of seriousness to furnish me with what is colloquially known as the sex talk, John?” Sherlock took in their present location, and the twist of her eyebrow seemed to say that it was a bit late for all that, “I do assure you that I did have a nanny, and while Molly may project a certain primness, she is in fact very sexually open and was more than willing to furnish me with information that my nanny neglected to provide.”
“I was seconds away from killing him.” Sherlock said, by way of greeting. “I fear you have done the world a disservice by cutting in, John.”
As he made his way to the marina with John, Greg shook his head, “Just when I think I’ve seen it all, I meet an animal trafficker.”
He smiled at Sarah, who seemed charmed, possibly intrigued by the idea that they’d have the flat to themselves, for the first time ever. He thought surely that all their near misses added up to a date or so, making the likelihood of sex well within the range of possibilities for the evening.
He stamped in just the way that terrified tourists. Well, some. Others laughed, despite the fact that he was a solider. And had a fucking gun and had killed people with his bare fucking hands.
Mycroft would be happy. She had just saved him several thousand pounds on a new wardrobe. With the wedding coming up, surely he would consider her lack of spending as an ideal wedding gift. After all, she wasn’t buying them a toaster.
BAMF!Sherlock, Awesome!Molly, and Spy!John in full supply...
He was hiding himself from everyone, except from the one person who saw the world as he saw it. He was hiding everything from everyone, except the one person who saw him in the sum totality of who he was, as a person, as the only other person in the entire world who was not simple and predictable. Stepping away from where she had been covertly observing John, she made a decision on the basis of her tea break deductions.
Sherlock retreated to her Mind Palace the second she was ushered onto the plane. She visited in her way with the Doctor Watson in her mind. As ever, he was full of vigor and sparkled with intelligence. He was forever after to eat more, to move more, to drink water, to go outside, to tell people what she thought, to sleep. This time, however, she found him standing in a operating theatre in her mind, explaining all of the things that could be wrong with him. This John in her mind couldn’t be worried, for he dealt in medical facts, in statistics. He didn’t understand her terror, her fear.
John digested her words, “I suppose you see a lot of do-gooders thinking they’re the answer to homelessness, and then they get burned out and leave?”
John draped her jacket, abandoned in the dirt, over her. “So you are agreed.”
His date had already binned her waffle. “I’m coming.”
Molly plunked down her glass. “I’d love to shove my heel up his—”
John shoved away his thoughts as he drove. Sherlock was quiet. He didn’t dare ask if she, too, was nervous. She wouldn’t deign to answer such an obvious question, and he’d about hit his insult quota for the day, given that his own brain had been firing them off since they’d pulled away from Baker Street.
“Do I?” John sought clarification, if for no other reason to keep hear her speaking. Her mind was a beautiful place, and to hear her express its inner workings for his ears alone was a gift beyond measure.
Cup passibly consumed, John rose. Sherlock had long ago slipped away, and he was curious as to her whereabouts. Though he enjoyed visiting with Mummy and Father, he found it best to limit time spent in Mycroft’s company, if only to avoid getting drawn into sibling squabbles. “If you’ll excuse me…”
John chuckled, stepping back and stealing a biscuit off of her plate. “Why are you my favorite cousin?”
“God, yes.” John had to force himself to look away. It wasn’t right to mix business with friendship, or whatever the hell this was that he felt, this alien flutter in his stomach and calmness in his soul. Still, he would do it, if it meant access to a war zone in London with this confusing woman at his six.
Sherlock said nothing as she passed the bag to Mycroft. John’s rage made him languid as they followed impressions of muddy footprints to the fire exit. In a quick glance, he saw that it had been disabled. Mycroft stepped back to finish their search.
“Our Sherly graduated Newham at 16 with a first, did her graduate studies, went to Vienna, spent time in New York, don’t mention it, she hated that city, and came home.” The Holmes father was so proud. John could hear it in his voice,  “She was let go from her research post for becoming too involved, shall we say? The rest is hers to tell, but I’ll see that you get a file. School records, hospital reports, etc. etc. etc.”
“You left him in a drainage tunnel to die!” Sherlock screamed, the phone nearly sliding from her grasp as she hissed between ragged breaths, “What was the purpose in that?”
“MacPherson.” John sighed, “MacPherson Holmes.”
Somehow knowing that Sherlock was mere feet away, actively trying to sleep shook him and kicked his mind and his observational skills into hyperdrive. In this place, it was a side of her he had never experienced. Still, John would rather his own private torment than MacPherson’s pain.
John shook his head, “Actually, it’s time for MacPherson to have a bit of postprandial playtime.” He looked to the dog who was standing at attention at his left, “Say goodnight to Uncle Myc, MacPherson.”
“How would you know what my nanny did, Geoff?” Sherlock queried, genuine confusion on her face. “She was hateful.”
Still, John looked, and did, in fact, see black mold. Jesus. She needed a full workup and psychical, which he was not, not, not, not, not going to be overseeing. When he was leaning over the eyepiece Sherlock whispered, “I found it under the sink in the loo.”
Victor stood behind Sherlock, and moved his gun to her temple. The cold metal against her pale flesh brought out the blueness of her veins, even those that clasped a knife behind her back. John blinked out a bit of morse code, and began to count to thirty in his head as he heard boots coming up the stairs under Victor’s maniacal cackling, “Oh, she tried! She tried! In New York—”
John felt instantly relived. He excused himself to the bathroom, and slipped into his bedroom thereafter to slide his Browning in the back of his trousers.
Lucy edged her way closer to the barrier. She was going to slide under the tape, weave towards the scene, but the same woman stopped her, “This is a crime scene!”
He pushed quickly to his feet, “I’ll put on some tea.”
John studied the handwriting. It was female, feminine, but not feminine in a way that spoke of a woman desperate to prove her gender performance to the world. The paper, though clearly high street, was thick enough to hold the weight of a fountain pen’s ink. It was as though she had found it, considered it nondescript, and decided it would do.
“We’ll put a screenshot on the Christmas card to Mycroft.” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips, “With a chocolate cake. Happy Christmas from Baker Street.”
Lestrade’s arms wrapped around her as Sherlock realized she had crumpled to her knees on the cold hospital floor. Those horrible, rasping, keening sounds were coming from her own body. The sobs that ripped through her soul, if she actually had one left, were agonized because John had lost everything he loved. The other part of her soul rejoiced that John lived, John lived, and he would live. A planet that held John Watson was the only fitting place for Sherlock Holmes.
“I’m quite aware.” Lucy said, cooly, dragging up her hair into a bun on the top of her head, “And you are?”
John returned the sentiment, and watched as she swanned away. It was only then that he realized that his champagne flute had been held steady in his hand the entire time she’d been next to him. John knew it didn’t have anything to do with the cost of her suit.
Greg’s voice dropped, grew thicker, “And then, she stopped. She stopped. It was like a wall had come down, and she was a tower of steel, a laser beam of purpose.”
Sherlock pressed herself against him, the darkness heightening his awareness of her touch. “Ask Lestrade.”
“Mycroft got a phone call when you were shot.” Greg revealed, “We waited. We were certain you were going to die, and Sherlock was in fucking Vienna. I had watched her grow into herself, grow more confident, grow into a young woman, and I knew that your loss would decimate her.”
She simply thrusted the mug in his direction, “Are you looking for a job? If so, I’m looking for a doctor.”
John wedged himself onto the small vacant space on the sofa. Sherlock set down MacPherson’s medical bag, not trusting even John to carry it properly, never mind the fact that he had carried far more volatile substances than pain medication, antibiotics, and anti-nausea medications. Nevertheless, Sherlock had appointed herself in charge of MacPherson’s medication schedule, and John was fine with letting her have at it. He was fine with treating humans, but felt something of a cad for making animals take medications, owing likely to a childhood cat who had taken her diabetes diagnosis as a personal insult.
Lucy looked up to see Sherlock staring at her, his rapid fire speech halting.
There was a knife jammed low in Sherlock’s belly. It looked rusted, even from the hilt.  “You fucking prat. You stupid fucking prat. You’ve gone and opened your mouth and fucking gotten stabbed. Fuck, fuck.”
John could just imagine a young Sherlock, so befuddled and disgusted by Victor’s attentions. It made him sick. “He made passes at her?”
Sherlock Holmes was, whether anyone knew it, a frequent visitor to John Watson’s medical records. She occasionally visited the physiotherapy rooms, occasionally noted that there was a blond man in the pool or standing in agony at the parallel bars. She was a ghost on the edge of his vision during the months of his stay, never noticed, but always near.
John found himself watching her as they drove off, wondering how a man who was involved in at least one noteworthy crime a fortnight could be perceived as boring and staid. John looked down at the hen at his side, “I won’t tell her if you don’t.”
There was no number, no name, no directive, no warning, no code. John propped it up on the edge of the teapot and put to, figuring that if there was a bullet headed his way on his day off, he might as well enjoy his last meal. John stared at the note as he ate, wondering who would have sent it, who would have paid for his meal, and how they had pegged him for a solider.
When they were done with the meeting and the tour of the buildings that ended in Assembly Hall, she checked her watch, and headed to the toilets to bide her time. If she reapplied lip balm, and refreshed her hair, it was merely to have something to do whilst standing in the loos. Sherlock ran through several possible openings as she stared at herself in the mirror, watching her hands smooth and twist.
John knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if Mycroft knew any of this, he would have made the bastard disappear. Even if his bloodlust had made him miss the mark as to his reactions, John knew that Victor Trevor wouldn’t be here if any of this truth had come to light.
“Why do I put up with your absurdities?” Sherlock rolled her eyes as she stalked knowledgeably about the section, devoted to the designs of someone named Diane, “Mummy masterminded throwing MacPherson a welcoming shower, though of course she is not the hostess. I am expected to go and participate in banal socialization with women I wouldn’t let within 500 feet of MacPherson. You are not required to go. I blame the patriarchy.”
“That is unacceptable.” Sherlock declared, MacPherson flying after the ball that was arcing through the air, “You will grow increasingly depressed and angry, and our discourses will devolve into arguments, biting silences, and angry sex. None of this is permissible.”
He’d been doing his bloody job, what he been paid to do.
Inside the box were a myriad of practical items, unscented nappy wipes, foot warmer snaps, and various and sundry items that somebody had probably asked around and determined soldiers needed. John checked again to make sure it was addressed to him when he spied tins in the bottom of the box, nestled amongst paperback books that could be shared. Between the two metal tins, there was a entire carton of candies to pass out to the kids, and so whoever had packed this was a pretty thoughtful person.
After doing a bit of tidying, John threw their clothes in the hamper near the bathroom sink, and figured Sherlock’s huff was permission enough to use the shower she was abandoning. “I don’t understand that at all.”
He did not seem offended though John knew he could not tell for certain what the man was thinking, “I went into public service after Cambridge, and thereby, occupy a minor position in the government.”
A dark haired woman said something sharp, and John almost imperceptibly recoiled. Lucy was quite ready to give the woman a slice of her well honed vocabulary, but she didn’t want to miss the chance to see John in his element. John smiled, a cold, chilling smile, and dismissed the woman with one or two quiet words.
Sherlock agreed, “In this we are alike.”
“Quid pro quo is not an option at this time.” Sherlock called from the loo, answering the question he had not voiced. “I’m going out.”
He questioned it when his leg began to ache from the rigid seat, and he felt his cane’s rubber tip melting against the heat of the stands.
John whirled, not bothering to ask the Holmes matriarch how she had done that to him. MI-6, indeed. “Hello, Violet.”
Was that supposed to intimidate him? Millions of people took their tea in the same way. His umbrella didn’t make him all knowing. John had never felt more energized, not since he’d left Helmand. If someone wanted to be evaded and ditched on the way to grabbing his dry cleaning, well, at least it gave John an excuse to do as they asked. It kept him sharp, gave him a goal, a purpose.
“This is not the most outlandish reason a woman has invited you into her bed.” Sherlock replied, rather grumpily shoving pillows in his direction, “I assure you your virtue is safe.”
With that, John began to reply to comments on the post. With thoughts of Sherlock and MacPherson, he agreed to meet his sister for lunch next week. When she texted to confirm it, he actually replied. Lunch with his sister wasn’t something he had done for months, but if they were making changes for MacPherson, John knew that this was the right step to take.
There was an Americanness to the street signs as she moved towards her destination, weaving through streets, past buildings, past men and women in military dress. Sherlock tried to remember what she and John had discussed, though she felt slightly detached from herself. Doctor John had told her she was in shock.
They sat in cold silence for a long while.
“Where’d you hide my laptop?’ John asked, ignoring Sherlock’s skeptical look.
Then, he shouldered the rucksack marked Watson, and headed for the security line. Once in the doorway, he swore he heard someone call out, “John…” in a broken, shocked, sort of voice that felt like a plea. Instantly, he turned around to look for Harry.
As they were finishing the visit, Mr. Frank noted, “I guess I’ll head home and tell my wife all her fussing was for nothing.”
MacPherson sniffed upon entering Baker Street, accepted a pat from Mrs. Hudson, and promptly lifted his great body with a single pained hop onto the sofa.
and moved onward, knowing that such a sign might as well have read:
Sherlock scoffed, “You may have done, within your capabilities.”
John stiffened slightly. He wasn’t sure he wanted to go back there. Sherlock just squeezed his hand as the lift opened, and she led him onward, guiding them through the wide doors onto the pavement. There was a black car stopped by the entrance, its rear door open. Mycroft himself was climbing out as they approached, and John knew this was no accident. Sherlock had, after all, summoned him for Greg’s sake.
John sighed as MacPherson corrected himself. This trip was off to a lovely start. MacPherson had left a hostess gift on his Nan’s shoes. John ate his cake.
John knew they weren’t talking about MacPherson’s bed and toys. Sherlock studied him blandly for a moment, and finding what she sought his face, turned away and began to talk about the creasing ability of cotton fibers when packed under certain conditions.
Sherlock’s expression revealed her disbelief and her doubt.
John was a nanosecond from grabbing the door and reaching for his gun when the door flew open and a woman stood in the doorway as the door hit the wall.
When they came to a particularly location with spotty coverage, Sherlock sat down primly on a stone bench and settled her skirts around her. John very carefully looked away, and cleared his throat.
John didn’t ask her what boy she meant. He knew he would figure it out. She’d done him a service and confirmed a few things for him, but that didn’t give her power over him. He was being watched? Why tell him? Was she the one at the top?
Sherlock was on her feet and heading toward the door. Instead of rattling off deductions, she merely demanded, “Let’s go.”
“So Google tells me, Doctor.” Sherlock snapped, but there was no venom in it. “I’m fine.”
He could see her now, flitting about Europe as he had once done, on the wind, trying to stay two steps ahead of death as she dove from bolthole to rendezvous spot. He could not consign her to that future. She was not to be harmed any more by the sights of what had awaited them in the cargo hold. The investigations would be overseen personally by her brother, and loose ends would be tied.
“Finally, some sense has been spoken.” Sherlock exclaimed. John realized something, when she sent him a smile that was as real as it was crooked.
John said nothing. It wasn’t a platitude. It was a promise, with everything that entailed.
“My aim!” He screamed, “James Armitage is the alter-ego I developed as a nom de plume for work, actual work, that was mine to be published. But no!” John saw that his alter-ego had been his murdering guise, never used to create, but to destroy. James, and thus Victor, was wanted on several major drug charges, and was wanted in the assault of several sex workers. “Professor Barten gave you authorship, her pet, a woman boosting  up a woman on the basis of gender and not merit. Now, just as I’m off to Australia, I find that my identity has been frozen. It seems big brother is still watching you!”
Something was off about this whole bloody fucking thing.
Harry ventured, as they drove along, “Well, I don’t know. People mostly come for the food. They stay for other reasons, but they come for the nibbles.”
“Got herself fired for watching over you.” Greg took one last look at the untouched food between them, “She never told me the details but that I know.”
Halfway to opening his mouth to decline, he realized that he needed to get out of the lab to think. The dead body and Sherlock’s enthusiasm were crowding his mind. “Molly?”
The deerhound would go into Sherlock’s room, settle for approximately ninety seconds, only to cry in a deep whine for an equal period time, and come scurrying back on his long legs, and repeat the process. Sherlock had tried petting him, tried the violin, tried everything. They had moved MacPherson’s bed three times, fluffed his blanket, squeaked his toy. Sherlock had even gone so far as to hum MacPherson’s song, though John knew he was not supposed to have heard the gentle notes crossing her lips. She had a lovely voice, but never sang.
John knew that he had inserted himself everywhere, and having met the man, John could just picture him sticking his nose into whatever anyone else was doing, so as to position himself to steal the credit. John could just see him rifling through people’s bags and violating basic lab etiquette to get ahead. He could also see a young Sherlock training herself to ignore him as she had long ago trained herself to ignore irrelevant annoyances, like a draft or a burnt out light bulb.
John scrambled quickly towards her, not caring that his shoes were soaked, now, nor that these were his good trousers. He had to fold himself up even more to fit in the space next to her, as it was little more than a cranny that opened up a few feet back, but he did it. The walls were tight around him, and he forced himself to look at Sherlock, whose head was mere centimeters away from the top of the tunnel as she sat in the shallow water.
“It’s going to be all right, Sherlock.” John tried, for he knew that there hadn’t been a major case in some weeks, and that the lack of a puzzle meant that every bit of her brainpower was solely focused on their dog’s welfare.
Harry’s sobriety would not stick if she went it alone, again. Clara was not in a position to help her, as she enabled her in the way of a loved one in a dysfunctional dynamic. Sherlock quickly added variables to her projections, and selected a new course of action with ease. She wrote yet more information on the note, and concluded with a simple directive. Harry was to call this number, posthaste. In time, Harry would assume John had done this for her, and in essence, he did deserve the credit.
John barely resisted the urge to snap the man’s arm in three places, rip it off, and shove it down his throat as he pocketed the silver frame that held the aforementioned photo. John knew this was a long game, and so he asked, “Would you care for an autograph?”
Back to the present in this chapter...
“No promises.” John reminded him that he had said he would try. However, Hawker seemed to have this sense that anything John said he would try to do, he would succeed at doing. John blamed The Lady’s mystique for that, as her Network all thought she hung the moon, not that she paid an ounce of attention to lunar cycles.
John replied,  “Is that what you’d call this?” For his part, John thought this was as experiment. He admitted at much, and Mrs. Hudson paused in passing him a spoon and fork.
“Er…” Carter shoved his hands in his back pockets, looking to John for guidance, “Chicken.”
That didn’t mean anything, he told himself.
In jest, he said, “Mike, about the person you mentioned?”
John made a note to put the word out, in a thinly veiled post, that printing pictures of MacPherson would be met with legal action. The picture had been stolen. The American press had teeth, but they also had scruples, at least when it came to dogs, horses, and Father Christmas. He was very aware of most of the journalists that came sniffing around, and Mr. Macon wasn’t one of them. Still, Atlanta was a growing entertainment city of the American Southeast, and so it could be someone new looking to make a splash.
“That’s remarkably forward thinking.” John commended her, “In that case, I’m happy to accept. Do you have a clinic space?”
Sherlock did not budge from the waiting area, not even as they drip dried onto the floor, her hair wild and curly around her in a frizzy nimbus. He wondered if he should tell her she looked like a lion.
When John finished his sweep of the yard, moose in hand, he came round to the front of the house and heard Sherlock yelling, “There’s a reason the papers call him a silver fox! You’ve got a Tumblr! You’ve certainly encountered Sherlockians! Why didn’t you call?”
He had less than 15 minutes before Sarah was meeting him here. He sniffed at his shirt, and determined a quick change and shave would do well enough. John shoved a bunch of academic journals into something resembling a pile, and gathered up a few mugs and deposited them in the thankfully empty basin. Thank God Sherlock had sterilized it in order to test some theory or other.
“Good lord.” John glanced at Lucy, and Lucy took some pity on his poor soul. They were close in age, the same year in school. “Lucy?”
Harry retorted, “Fuck off.”
This stranger had done this for him, and in a single instant, John felt slightly more understood and less alone in this vast universe. They would never know his story, his successes, or his failures, but he felt strangely accepted in the delivery of his favorite tea and biscuits. This person had no way of knowing any of these details, but that tiny twist of fate reminded John that he was a part of something bigger, something grander. He wasn’t a religious man, but he valued meaning, and he found personally valuable meaning in the kindness of that gesture that was merely enhanced by the details soothing some aching part of soul.
After a long moment, she looked to the nurse and forced out, “We’re best on our own, now.”
Dr. 1980’s-big-collar-floral-dress made a strangled noise. Lucy smiled at her, glad to know that if she had some kind of fit, there was a roomful of doctors to assist her. Not Lucy, naturally, but someone, surely.
Lestrade’s gaze narrowed. “Which one of you shall I arrest? One of you is going in, and we’re not leaving until I get something more than, ‘Greg, we’ve a case, don’t ask questions…’ even as Myc wakes me up in the middle of the bloody night that you two have stepped in it again.”
He glanced back at his flatmate. “It appears we’ve acquired a dog. I know the lease—” He didn’t know exactly how to approach this, because the fact that they lived at Baker Street and now had a dog were immutable facts to Sherlock. He didn’t fancy living on the street, or worse, in the Holmes house, after losing their flat. He somehow knew the flat would go before the dog.
“I’m sorry we don’t have longer to visit.” Sherlock added, “You’re welcome at Baker Street.”
Sherlock was the proud owner of freshly cared for curls when he came into the flat. There was paper taped up on the wall, and various chemical reactions made plain in various colors of ink. “The third one on the left isn’t properly balanced.” John noted, setting the groceries on the counter and petting MacPherson in greeting.
Sherlock was ice and condescension, “I have been reliably informed that I don't have one.”
Sherlock recoiled as though she had been slapped. John reached over and grasped her shoulder gently. “His name is MacPherson.”
He faked a laugh, forced levity into his shoulders, and walked off. Sally didn’t like Sherlock, and he wasn’t going to feed her ire. It was better just to play dumb until he figured out his game plan.
John often thought about his blog as London swirled around him.
John took inventory of his stock, making a mental list of the supplies he would need, as the basic tools he would really rather have to begin a practice. A lot of more modern tools walked a line for him between a want and a need, and so he made another mental list and decided to discuss them with Sherlock.
Of course, the routines themselves changed over time, but they emerged after a period of change without fail. Once settled, became part of the fabric of his day, only to be changed by things like bombings, shootings, or the acquisition of a pet from a drainage tunnel. John appreciated his routines, valued how they bookended utter insanity.
“Why didn’t you come home, Mina?” Greg asked. It was the first time John had ever heard anyone reference Sherlock’s legal name, much less call her a diminutive of the long mouthful. It spoke volumes, “You never—”
“We’re good?” Janet asked, and stated, before stirring the oats one more time, and declaring them finished, began to lift the pot.
John would have liked to give him several tips. Instead, he simply nodded, and strode away, satisfied that he had not given Tom the respect of a farewell. The old guy had been bothering since the day after Gramps had died, and she had vowed then she’d burn the place to the ground before selling to him.
“Oh, John. This isn’t a novel, and life isn’t that simple.” Sherlock smiled almost sadly, and fell silent. “If only we could manufacture a case that only I could solve, and thusly use that proximity in order to facilitate their retrieval.”
He barely ducked in time. “Oi!”
His hand was shaking. She saw a slight tremor in the menu card before he set it down.
Lestrade’s hand went to his hair, “Jesus, Sherlock.”
John hid a small smile at that, knowing full well that she spoke of herself. “I’m still sorry you got fired.”
John inclined his head. How nice to have her blessing. Now he wouldn’t have to be the least bit sneaky about pulling his fingernails out of their beds.
“You cook entrails in our best kettle, but refuse to scoop poop.” John observed, “Did you get her number?”
More at ease, John smiled at Sarah. This date was not a wrong thing, it was just that the timing was wrong. How could he have possibly given anyone else, even Sarah, his full attention when he knew that Sherlock was out there somewhere? It was completely sensible.
Another long awaited update...
Mummy had hauled her to Brussels for half-term, but it suited Sherlock just fine. Thereby, she packed her luggage, stowed her violin, and accompanied Mummy with only token protests regarding her holiday plans. Typically, Mummy had left her to her own devices for much of their stay, as she was attending a summit. Under no circumstances was Sherlock permitted to even know that this summit was taking place.
“I was flattered by your insistence that you needed to remain with Sarah.” Sherlock replied, brushing her fingers through his hair with heartbreaking tenderness, “It’s rooted in your subconscious.”
“I will have you know I was the best of my set. It was an experiment and nothing more.” Sherlock asserted, “I won’t have it said otherwise.”
“And I tried to remember if I had been working an op, but I couldn’t remember anything.” John searched his memory, “She told me that Sarah had a lovely voice.”
John knew that now was not the time to discuss the massive amount of privilege in that statement. Though Sherlock spent a lot of time with impoverished people, she did not understand what it was to need to work so as to have food on the table. “What you’re saying is that anywhere that hires me is lucky to have me.”
“I’ve loved you longer.” Sherlock replied, “Really, my devotion is a thing worthy of great study.”
Sherlock reigned her scorn and rage. Did he have to do the man’s job for him? Was this the kind of care the United Kingdom felt their best and most heroic deserved?
John’s gaze met Sherlock’s, and he swallowed. She had changed him. Her very presence in his life was a chemical reaction that had refined him elementally. The John Watson he had been seconds before bumping into her in that corridor bore little resemblance to the man he was today. She had changed him, helped him become more himself, more of his fundamental self, simply by accepting him.
The Army had made fine use of that, John knew, fast tracking him and pushing him through his training in hospital, at Broomfield, UCHL, and Bart’s. He’d not broken, not even when they’d expected it, warned him that this sort of clandestine roles had decimated lesser people. He’d risen above and excelled, ignored anyone who said they were expecting too much to ask him to be both soldier and doctor. Fuck them all. He’d proven himself, and he was going to do everything he knew he could do. People were counting on him.
They reached the top, and John dusted off his hands. He held them up in a placating gesture. Nowhere had he mentioned banal DINKs living in Camden. “I didn’t say--”
Lucy held her own, cradling it against her breasts, and fending off Dr. Grabby with her splayed elbows. He was terrified of breasts, had been since she’d come into her own, and he wouldn’t dare risk grabbing the phone and ending up making contact.
“Oh, don’t be absurd, John.” Sherlock sniffed, “I’ve hired it out. But as it stands, I must supervise the entire process, because imbeciles make an utter mess of even the simplest tasks.”
Tonight was his pub night with Greg. His mates had their own schedule, but he and Greg had found over time that they met once every other week, and it was a habit they had cultivated. John started their rounds off, as it was his turn, and ensconced himself in a corner with Greg, keeping an eye on the entrance as they talked about everything and nothing for a good while.
John found himself blogging increasingly about MacPherson’s recovery, and the animal hospital began to receive cards to decorate his space and charitable donations from MacPherson’s growing fanbase. A girl in university stopped him on the tube to ask after him and he had his own hashtag on Twitter. It surely seemed that people had rallied behind him, but it was nothing on the exactitude with which Sherlock approached pet ownership.
They arrived back at the farm, to find Carter Snapchatting who knew what in the kitchen with Sherlock’s makeshift lab in the background, “Hullo.”
“Hello.” Sarah greeted Sherlock, her navy skirt and prim blouse a stark contrast to Sherlock’s denim encased legs and black top, which showed her slim figure to its best advantage. Objectively, of course.
The man poured a cup of tea and added just the right amount of John’s additions. John didn’t roll his eyes at the confirmation of whom had been behind the ongoing surveillance. It was so bloody showy and obvious.
“Well, now.” Victor declared, “Aren’t you going to warn me off? Despite Sherlock’s precious little schoolgirl crush, I can assure you, our bond runs deep.”
Within two days, they had determined that Victor was indeed unhinged. Sherlock had found a real case underneath the veneer of the assignment, just as they had expected. Not only was Victor blackmailing her, he was desperate to keep the disappearance of his boss under wraps. He was setting himself up as her successor at the bank, and was in debt up to his eyeballs, and was intent on blackmailing the aforementioned client to pay him off.
“Oh, John.” Mrs. Hudson sighed, “I’m sure it’ll all work out in the end.”
John pulled down his shirt, and realized that the run about London, desperate to find Sherlock, desperate to see her, desperate to hold her, and the resolution with Jefferson Hope had revealed to John two things. One, his limp was gone, had been the second he’d walked into that drawing room. Two, he could not ever consent to be on Mycroft Holmes’ payroll. He would not be paid to spy on a friend, and though he had not signed a contract, he knew that’s what it would come to be.
John jolted when he saw the pale expense of her chest appear between the buttons she was parting very casually, as if her mind was still on her deductions. “I’ll just wait out there until you pick one.”
John merely reached around her to steady her as she kicked off her shoes, and grabbed the fabric to raise the edge of her Saab gown. Their eyes met, and John knew that the only thing glorious about this moment was her joy, her laughter, the power she felt restored within herself, power that Victor in vain to cause her to question. “You’re glorious.”
John took stock of himself, and found that he could not move, nor do anything to sit up. He felt like he was going to vomit, and made that plain in the only way he knew how. “Basin—” he dry heaved, trying to keep everything that was welling up inside of him from coming forth until there was a basin underneath him.
“MacPherson would like it.” John replied, near the doorway to the room in question, “If Sherlock wants to go, it might be nice.”
John counted to three in his head as his eyes adjusted to the darkness around Greg’s torch. There were rare and exotic animals shoved in a cargo hold. It was swealtering down here, for the ship was meant to hold timber and other goods and was instead a jail to several suffering creatures. They were in abject terror and misery, and it made his gut clench to shine his torch in their direction.
“He came to my flat the following weekend. He expressed to me that he regretted his behavior in the past and wished to make amends. Though I did not believe him, he…” Sherlock shook once, and then found the steel within herself, and continued, as though she was talking about the difference between lavender and mauve. “He…compelled me to share tea with him. The tea was dosed with what I later determined to be a oral dose of midazolam.”
Sherlock’s teeth clenched together. “By my calculations, MacPherson will be released Saturday. It is Thursday. Preparations must be made, and as he cannot manage stairs, his recuperation space will be in my bedroom.” She sighed heavily, “One cannot have a medically fragile animal in anything less than pristine surroundings.”
John felt Molly’s hand trembling in his own, and he knew that Sherlock had been so desperate to prove that she was able to hold her own at school that she would have sooner died than ever admit to needing help. She couldn’t have gone to her parents for support, as their dynamic would have seen anything other than self-sufficiency as a weakness. “What’s he doing here?”
John gritted his teeth and tried to shake off his sister so he could go buy a fucking Mars bar, get on the goddamned plane, and go to fucking Afghanistan. “Harry, please don’t make a fuss of this. We knew this would be my life when I joined up, and I’m glad I did. The Army suits me.”
“And if I don’t?” Sherlock retorted, calmly and coldly, as though her back wasn’t pressed to library bookcases, as though there wasn’t some man looming in her space, a predator.
“John lived!” Sherlock retorted, “He’s alive! What more proof do you require? The fact that he smiled last Tuesday or has begun to lead peer support groups on his ward? The fact that he talked to his sister? What do you want? A cake with your picture on it? The only person who deserves commendation for John’s recovery is John, for you were content to abandon him to the vagaries of a system not designed for exceptionalities.”
“You sent flowers to her funeral.” Sherlock paused, and tilted her head in consideration. “Why?”
Lucy Woodbine hated London. She clicked at her phone’s home button again, and almost growled as it displayed an alert. She hated London. It wasn’t done to admit it, but it was true. London ranked only above the Atlanta airport at three in the morning. That place still gave her nightmares. And people say the Tube is complicated. Still, getting lost in Atlanta aside, she hated London.
In any case, once he got out of bed, he spoke to MacPherson, filed his water bowl if it was empty, showered, dressed, walked MacPherson, came inside, interacted in varying ways with the aforementioned consulting detective with whom he shared bed and board, attempted to read the paper while MacPherson cried out at the indignity of not being given his morning paper to roll around upon, and consumed some form of carb with some form of protein with tea. The tea was a fixture, as was tracking a grumpy or energized mad genius either who was either happy or exasperated, depending on the circumstances of the day.
Quickly, Lucy gathered her things, and slid to the door, slipping out of the row without bashing anyone, even though she did earn several glares. “It can’t be that interesting.” Lucy muttered, stepping over bodies in the row, “Christ.”
Sherlock thought that utter tripe. She was Sherlock Holmes. When would Mummy learn that nothing, especially something as critical as an international summit relating to war and peace, escaped her notice? Mummy was an excellent spy, and stateswoman, but all things told, she knew very little practical information about her youngest child.
Using supplies he begged from the woman at the intake desk, John cleaned and bandaged the cut, made a mental note on the size of the bruising, and let Sherlock sulk.
Sherlock had no hesitation in speaking, “I’ve been analyzing dog hair, and of course the in-process DNA testing will confirm it, but we have evidence to believe he’s a Scottish Deerhound.”
“No, ma’am.” The cleaner replied dryly, “Only mold and inches of dust.”
She was a twenty year old woman, with choices and options, and by rights, especially at her age, she should have them. She shouldn’t be put in this position, though he age did make Mycroft and Greg slightly more relatable.
He met Sherlock in the park, to let MacPherson blow off some steam and burn off some excess energy that came with being a consulting canine without an active case. John threw the ball, and told Sherlock that he had resigned his post. “I’m not sure what I’ll do next. I just hope it doesn’t make the fucking papers.”
John shook his head, “I’m not a lab assistant. I don’t get paid enough to become your lab rat.”
“How pleased I am to see you!” She carried a small shopping bag, “I’ve ordered some things to arrive for MacPherson. I just thought you should know, so as not to worry about his belongings.”
Sherlock studied him, and John knew that he’d just turned this discussion into something of an experiment. Adoration and desire sparked low in John’s belly as Sherlock smiled. Confusion joined them, though, when she simply sipped her tea, and revealed, “My middle name is Sarah, John. I have been known to use it as an alias.”
Sherlock rose and strode from the doctor’s study, and went back to her office. She was confident that she had done all she might do for the moment, but all the same she kept an eye on Dr. Norwood. It never occurred to her that Dr. Norwood was keeping an eye on her.
Sherlock replied, “I do like to clean out the mind palace from time to time. You know how I abhor clutter and detritus.” She pulled her phone from her pocket, “I am going now.”
John knew that there was surveillance everywhere, and so he kept his voice low and his eyes downcast, “What are you trying to say, Greg?”
“You’re a very literary sort, John.” Mrs. H winked, “It gets you the dates, I’m sure.”
“Will do!” Sarah smiled, “Ready, John?”
He wondered if Mycroft had seen the
They weren’t going to be discussing the cops in the apartment then. Still, John had to mention something. A tech pulled open a drawer, “Common spaces and visible objects only!” Sherlock snapped, without bothering to look up form her pristine microscope.
John unfolded himself just before MacPherson’s eager licks made contact with his face, “He’s a psychopath, Sherlock.”
John opened his mouth to speak, to deny his relationship, but Lucy gestured gently, and the wind left John’s sails. Mike looked so happy that poor old Johnny couldn’t say one word.
“Father, you know as I do that the journey was not significantly delayed. We arrived precisely as we said we would do.” Sherlock accepted her father’s greeting in her typical fashion, “You will excuse me, I am taking MacPherson to the garden.”
“Gregory…” Mycroft came into the room, interrupting his husband in a pained voice, “I told you they shouldn’t have met until she was at least thirty-two. But you convinced me not to interfere, and now this is what you’ve done.”
“Good man, Doc.” Pete returned, leading him nosily and confidently in through the exit.
Sherlock merely watched the animal ambulance doors swing shut. As if on cue, a black SUV pulled up. In this case, John was glad to get out of the rain and only cursed Mycroft once.
Sherlock sobbed in Lestrade’s arms. She had not cried in front of another living soul in her memory. And yet, she cried openly and brokenly for John Watson. Tears still seeped from her body with every other sob. She shook so hard that Lestrade physically placed her in the chair and then shoved his partner out of the door to give them a minute.
“Dr. Holmes…” The review board’s chair glared at Sherlock, “We have no choice but to let you go. You are a brilliant scientist, but are perhaps not suited to the interpersonal boundaries that must be maintained in a hospital setting.”
From behind a few canisters, Sherlock retrieved the pilfered laptop. John powered it on as usual, and tapped a few key sequences at the login screen, enabling a hidden authentication portal to appear. Really, this was child’s play, but if it allowed him to eventually plant a facer on Mr. Trevor, he would do almost anything.
It did little but remind him that he was an alien, little but remind him that he wasn’t here on holiday. Vaguely, John wondered how he’d ever feel fully qualified, knowing as he did that his training was only one part of his life. People called him doctor, but he felt like he was playing make-believe sometimes, when someone was gushing blood and he was the only thing standing between that soldier and death.  He wished he were back in the tents sewing someone up. At least there he felt he was doing some good.
John simply shook his head, and slid his hand under hers. “Support his hindquarters. I’ll take the head.”
“Tea!” Came the demand, “These slides are critical.”
The penny dropped then, and he realized that he was having a very frank discussion with Sherlock, not as a professional, but as someone whom she felt needed to know that she was taking this step. The probabilities of future occurrences, clearly, related to either sex or pregnancy, and given that she was taking steps to prevent pregnancy, he felt it very obvious that she was informing that she was open to a sexual relationship. In theory. With someone.With him?
John placed his copy in the rubbish bin not far from the door to 221B, and watched with some satisfaction as six cameras swiveled to read the headline. Once inside the flat, he asked, “Not bad for an afternoon’s work, huh, MacPherson?”
“The fucking dog—” John growled, “has a name. You will use it.”
“I’m glad to remain that, John.” Sarah affirmed, “I do wish you and Sherlock the very best.”
Sherlock nodded, “I offered to give him a sterilized needle, but he said would keep his eye out for you.” She flopped down on the sofa, cuddling up to the dog, “Do you know what this means?”
“I’d just popped by to see if you wanted to go to dinner, actually.” Sarah returned, “But I’d hate for you to waste your chicken. Some other time.”
“Sherlock…” John sought her gaze, and found it vulnerable beneath the steel in her eyes, “I hardly knew him when I made that suggestion. I was wrong. He’s a consulting canine, just as you are consulting detective.”
He wanted her be as free an unfettered to do as she wished as possible, within the the laws of the UK and the Geneva Convention, and he rather saw friendship as supporting that desire. He wanted for her to want what she wanted, and for himself, he wanted to support her goals if she, and only if she herself, asked.
“Shut up, Sherlock.” John ordered, as the paramedics took over. John provided what little information he had. Sherlock was awake, but that didn’t say much about his condition internally, not really. Sherlock was amazing, and if he wanted to stay awake, he would.  “He’s packed and ready for transport. Internal bleed, though. I’d run a line.”
When he stopped moving, John had a shoe on the grocery carrier’s back. His palm burned from where it had come into contact with smooth skin as he’d hauled her behind him. The man was cowed by John’s foot, but his tone was indignant, even muffled by the carpet, “This is a gentleman’s club, Mr. Holmes.”
“You care not one bit for social convention.” The man was icy, coolly assessing John, “Or else you would have not spoken to a young girl in the halls of Buckingham.”
Sherlock looked up then, and John saw that she had a smudge of dirt on the edge of her cheekbone. Frostily, Sherlock replied, “It will improve flock dynamics. If my hypothesis proves true as it did for my parents, then the hens will begin to adjust their patterns with an eye towards increased egg-laying. Gwen’s told me they have been irregular as of late and her dietary changes have not altered that trend.”
John shoved his bearskin at Mycroft. “Yeah, actually. I do.”
Sherlock sniffed, “A boring home.”
He saw Nan off in the morning, glad they were alone. She went on about how much she liked Sherlock, and John knew had Sherlock heard it, she would have been glad to provide Nan with a thousand reasons to loathe her. “Now, John, you have a nice time and mind the girls.”
John had never needed to tell her that the farm was one place that made him vulnerable. She knew that, in some way, they were going back to the nucleus of who he was, in seeing the place that had shaped him from earliest childhood. “Nan’s expecting us tomorrow. That’s not too soon, is it?”
Sherlock insisted on staying on the boat with MacPherson. It was a close thing, but in the end her fierce desire to protect MacPherson won out over her desire for vengeance. Mycroft stayed behind to help the requisite authorities work out how to return stolen animals to their homes and habitats.
“I was not the one in danger at the time, John.” Sherlock returned. Underneath their banter, John was quickly and carefully decoding what she was saying, though he was having very little luck in contextualizing it. He knew that she was referencing the danger of his work, and had one question he needed to put to rest. “Please tell me you weren’t in an active war zone.”
He’d gone grocery shopping with the last of his funds. Might as well go to hell with a full belly, after all. John reached to tap at the window, just as it rolled down, “Something you’d like? There’s a sale on milk at Sainsbury’s.”
John plonked himself down on an upholstered bench, where he would be able to see Sherlock when she came out of the dressing room. He was not thinking about the way silk and chiffon would feel against her trim body. Rather, he was mindfully considering his next blog post. Though he did not normally mention personal events or outings, he decided that he would compile a post of the deductions she’d made whilst shopping into a post called
John wished he had half of her certitude, her confidence. He wished he could simply not give a shit about anything other than the truth. “It’s been a shit day.”
Nothing could shake John’s sense of rightness, not the media swarm, not the kid who’d vomited on him at the clinic, not the spilled coffee on the tube. Sherlock had once again told him that he was still experiencing the chemical highs of a new relationship, but as she’d said this in the midst of boiling entrails and an ensuing argument about health codes and basic human behaviors, John quite doubted her explanation.
“Wilhelmina,” Said she, who was supposedly the leader of a country, though Sherlock could never remember which one, only because there were more important things to deduce. The woman was on personal terms with Mummy, and had known Sherlock long enough that Sherlock considered it unless to inform her that she did not use that hateful forename. “I would simply say hello.”
