Two people are at Mycroft's desk. Or to be more accurate, bending over it. Naked.
"If he refuses, we simply have to make out in front of him, until he gives us the documents. We'll try to avoid shagging on his desk though, we don't want to have to exile ourselves to Siberia."
He tickles Jack as revenge for the amount of poking he has suffered for the past twenty minutes and Jack squeals, delighted. They end up rolling all over the floor, both laughing loudly and John eventually hears the sound of Sherlock heading towards them.
They stare at him. The Witch is shaking with uncontrolled rage, the only thing stopping her is the raised hand of her partner. Then she turns and storms over to Wardrobe. Sherlock is on his feet without making the conscious decision to do so.
He throws the door open and walks into the room before Mike can stop him. “Hello Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, I need you to open your eyes. Can you squeeze my hand? Can you do that for me? Squeeze my hand.”
"You were hoping to make them suffer longer."
Lestrade stops the rubbing motion but keeps his hands covering his face. "Sometimes," he says, voice gruff and thick with emotion, "sometimes there are cases so horrific that even as someone merely investigating, you can't help but look at everyone in the street and wonder who has people locked up in a basement." His hands slide away from his face and his red rimmed eyes bore into John's. "Sometimes, no matter what your involvement in the case, you know you're going to have nightmares for a very long time. This one will haunt me to my grave. And what I feel is nothing compared to what Sherlock is going through." He looks away and swallows. "Hell, you're having to live with it."
Sherlock smirks and raises one eyebrow. 'Not so quick, John,' he mutters. 'You want to draw it out? Trust me, so do I. And don't dare fall asleep after your first orgasm.' While he talks, he's slowly pulling off his socks and trousers. The bulge in his briefs is obvious.
“Very good. Is there anything else?”
“Mycroft. To what do I owe the pleasure?” Sherlock had asked before the door to his room (cell) had opened. Slow, deliberate steps punctuated by the occasional tap of an umbrella reverberated down the corridor. Obvious.
“Thank you.” And then he drifted off to sleep.
Of course, he’d be a fool to deny that accusation had some merit. Yet, more often than not, there was physical intimacy. Nothing remotely sexual, of course, the withdrawal process tended to numb most of those impulses.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jim did something that surprised both of them, then. He crossed the space between them and crushed their lips together.
“Sherlock. Please.”
He had no doubt that Jim knew how to kill a man and had no doubt that he had in the past. But Sherlock’s neck was bared, and he tilted it every so often so Jim had better access. He could rip his throat out right now, and the dangerous thing was that Sherlock really didn’t mind too much. He trusted Jim. Less than ten hours together all together and he trusted him.
“Am I okay to stay here?”
Sherlock nodded and he left again - bolting the door as he did. He had to remain outside until his brother had either left or he was forced to intervene. Sherlock was, obviously, a liability. A potential threat.
“You’re slowly dwindling the dose you’re giving them?”
Jim chuckled and Sherlock felt it reverberate through his entirety. It was oddly… pleasant.
"You've not given me much of a chance, little brother."
Scanning him up, but not rising in greeting, he wasn’t surprised to see how little his older brother had changed over the three months, outside of the extra three pounds.
“Hey, pretty boy. Why don’t you come and sit with us?”
“Hm. You’re not doing a very good job."
After a week, for the first time in a month, Sherlock found himself wishing their break was longer. Their ward was small, only fifteen of them altogether, and they had all just ended up cuddling up together until their time was over.
“Keep it on standby. I would hate to have nothing if this new scheme isn’t as successful as my brother believes it will be.”
Mycroft worked fast. In the early hours of the next morning, Seb had come in to see Sherlock and briefed him on the changes to the establishment:
Mycroft considered this for a moment.
“Yes you can, you’re the British Government.”
Always observant of his surroundings, Sherlock saw before he felt a small body tuck into his side. At first, he had assumed it was an attack, but the passive look on the young man’s face hardly denoted signs of aggression.
Ignoring the remarks, Sherlock flopped back onto his bed and retrieved his phone. He made no overt effort to hide it now that all of the guards were on his side - no wonder it had been easy for Mycroft to spot it, he’d left it poking out under his pillow.
“And how would you know that, hm?”
He shook his head and stood, evidently as fearful as getting caught as Sherlock was.
He remembered the first time it happened, in only his third week. He’d already broken out several times but Seb would always bring him back - it had gotten boring by his fifth, so he’d given up. He only had a few months there, after all.
“Tomorrow,” Sherlock replied before they were both dragged back to their respective areas.
Something that had managed to surprise Sherlock about rehab was the amount of affection present there. He was never one to buy into rumours of legends, heedless of how widely-believed they were, but all evidence whilst outside pointed to rehab as a place where aggression and mania were commonplace.
In their shared space, they were given a selection of books and other things to keep them entertained. Sherlock sat on the floor, silently reading a non-fiction in the corner.
He would have been lying if he said the words were going in.
He’d finished all of the books of that he knew would possibly hold his interest by now. He tried re-reading one of them, but nothing was holding his attention. He collapsed on one of the sofas - feeling something a quiet voice in his head told him was loneliness.
“And, that,” Jim spoke breathlessly when they both broke away for air, “was the first kiss you’ve given willingly in your entire life.”
“You know what I want.”
“Is this an intervention?”
Sherlock smirked and pulled Jim closer to him, book entirely forgotten on the floor by his feet. Both men content to just bask in each other's warmth and the feeling of being understood - finding their equal.
It was almost caring. Almost. Mycroft shuddered at the thought.
I feel like I tried too hard with this chapter lol
They were sitting in an intimate position, one he would never have dreamed of being in with anyone he knew outside of those walls. Distantly, Sherlock realised how vulnerable, both emotionally and physically, it was.
The man gave him a warm smile. “Don’t worry - I’ll see what I can do.”
Sherlock nodded before his brain could catch and create an objection. What was he doing? He began reading his book again as he felt thin arms wrap around his equally thin waist.
A tree that’s never seen the sun never knew it lived in the shade, he supposed.
“Your turn to be laid bare now, Sherlock,” he began. “You’re evidently a privately educated, gay man who went to University in Scotland but, besides that, has lived in England, no - London, his whole life. Chemistry student, obviously - Doctorate, perhaps. You’re an only child. No… you have an older brother, one you don’t particularly like.” Sherlock let a small smile creep on to his face. “Poison of choice? Heroin. Sometimes cocaine, depending on your mood but you certainly had enough money for both. Far too much money for expensive cigarettes, too.” Jim paused, thinking. “That was until Mummy and Daddy handed you an ultimatum, wasn’t it? Rehab or no more money. So, here you are - albeit reluctantly.”
“So what will it be?” Sherlock almost spat the words. “What’s my punishment, Officer?”
He didn’t want to hear Sherlock’s objections, so he spoke quickly, still leaning close.
Jim found a smirk forming and repositioned himself to face the brilliant mind besides him. “You could tell all of that, and I don’t even know your name.”
Perhaps he did get too relaxed there. He didn’t want to admit it, but Mycroft’s threat of making life here more uncomfortable for him, however empty it was, frightened him slightly.
He considered going back to his cell until he was approached by one of the guards. The guards weren’t allowed in their area, they had to stay by the door unless a threat was posed. Sherlock opened his eyes to see Sebastian looking down at him.
“But, believe me, Sherlock, if you do not stop your mini-cartel, I can make life far more uncomfortable for you in here.”
Hm, Sherlock thought, so this was kissing.
They spent over an hour that day just talking. Sherlock didn’t find himself bored once as he usually did in conversations with idles, and it allowed him to realise that Jim was quite like him in a way - just a man who wished to stop being bored. A genius and a social outcast.
“I can tell you’re a bisexual, Irish immigrant who suffers from night terrors, panic attacks and occasional hallucinations.” Sherlock began, and Jim looked up at him - suddenly engaged, sleep forgotten. “I’m no psychiatrist, so I won’t attempt to perform a diagnosis; although, naturally, I do have some ideas. Your family were religious, but you were, are, definitely not. You were the youngest by quite a fair margin; four older brothers, I want to say - none of them alive now, however. They never liked you, or your sexuality. Their death was the why and when behind you moving to England, which was when you found your poison of choice. Fun, at first, like for most of us - then you got dependant and well, here we are.” He gestured around, to the facility at large.
But at least it was something. Something to keep him occupied, something to do.
But he had always appreciated his personal space. Before he could voice this objection, however, a soft, cracking voice spoke up to him, killing the objection in his throat.
- The facility was going to begin implementing a program, akin to Sherlock’s own, to help with the withdrawal process. It was to rely on regulated, and therefore safe, versions of the substances they had become dependant on the outside - instead of the current prescriptions that served as ineffectual alternatives.
The part of Sherlock’s brain that remembered him before he was admitted distantly questioned what he was doing.
“I used to.” Sherlock didn’t ask.
Seb was Sherlock’s unofficial personal guard whilst he was inside. He was ex-marines and suffered from an undiagnosed PTSD; he wasn’t one of small talk, and that suited Sherlock just fine. Evidently, he had memorised his sleeping pattern and thought to inform him of the changes before all of the inmates were informed later on.
Sherlocked didn’t know what to say. No, absolutely not, go and cuddle someone else, would have worked, but also - that voice was the embodiment of desolation. It was so small, just like the man, and something within him told him that this man had already faced too much rejection in his life.
- Half of the management head team had been fired. They had been replaced with psychologists, general medical professionals, sociologists and doctors.
Sherlock replied. “I love you too.”
Constructive feedback is more than welcome!!
There were pairs, like them, but, surprisingly, a few groups too. Thirteen other bodies laid, curled around each other - desperate to find some comfort when their heads kept telling them they were going to die and that nobody was ever going to love them.
Sherlock hummed. “But you don’t seem one to follow the rules at least outside of a place like this, Jim.”
Evidently.
Sherlock Holmes was a (recovering) drug addict. He got discharged from rehab earlier in the year and has, since, found himself incredibly bored. This isn’t to say that he was particularly entertained while inside, no - the group exercises, therapy and documented self-reflections did nothing for him in terms of recovery or intellectual stimulation.
He doesn’t muse on what could have been if they would have met in a different place or time.
On the sixth day, Sherlock arrived early for once and found himself waiting by the door for Jim. He didn’t think why - if the last two days were anything to go by, it was not likely Jim was going to be there. Regardless of what the guard told him yesterday.
“I wouldn’t sit. You won’t be here long.”
“Mm.” Sherlock didn’t feel up to talking much.
Sherlocked huffed and rapped on the door, alerting Seb that he wished for Mycroft to leave now.
Mycroft’s anger subsided.
“I have my theories, of course. But I don’t have the time. Some of us actually have work to be doing, hm?”
He was content to have his face nuzzled into the crook of Sherlock’s neck, settled comfortably on his lap. His arms were wrapped around Sherlock’s neck and he let himself press lazy, blooming kisses along the pale expanse whenever he saw fit.
“Ran out of books, eh?”
A pointed silence served as his reply.
He was texting, arranging for the next batch of heroin to be delivered, slightly more diluted than the last, as he realised that - yes. Life had become passable.
“Can I see him?”
- This was to operate in the blindspot of the British Government despite the illegality of it.
“I can get you internet access again. I know you’ve got a phone.” Sherlocked turned around. “And no, I’m not interested in taking it from you. Name your price.”
Absently, Sherlock noted that they weren’t getting any looks. It wasn’t exactly decent, Jim was straddling him and turning his neck all shades of purple and blue. The guards weren’t interrupting and nobody even glanced at them.
The fourth day, Jim stayed in his room during the break. Sherlock pretended not to miss the comforting presence of the small man as he settled into his, their, corner and read to himself.
“Freedom, Mycroft. Let me out of this place and I promise you it will never see a whiff of narcotics ever again.”
He nuzzled into Sherlock’s side and muttered into the side of his ribcage.
“I do.” He paused. “Do you?”
They didn’t talk again until the alarm that signalled the end of the break went off. Time passed too fast between them, dancing away like a jealous lover.
Sherlock stood, moving to stand closer to his brother. Nearer, he could detect a slight sweat forming around his hairline. Interesting.
“So that’s what this is about, is it? You’re trying to, to help them?”
But there was a closeness and easy camaraderie that he assumed would be foreign within these walls.
Mycroft smirked - Sherlock’s display of ignorance earlier now nullified. He tried another tactic.
Sherlock ignored that. "Shouldn’t it be the responsibility of the guards,” he waved towards the door, “or the higher-ups, to sort this out? I wonder why they sent you, hm?”
Obviously not taking the bait, Mycroft remained in the room and shuffled towards a different tactic. Stooping to bribery was something he was usually against, but desperate times and all that.
“Brother mine. How have you been?”
- All of this meant Sherlock would no longer have to carry on his services, but Seb and the others offered their support him if he chose to for any reason.
The fifth day, Jim wasn’t there again. Sherlock cursed for allowing himself to feel a knot to form in the pit of his stomach. For allowing himself to feel at all.
“You could,” Sherlock replied, steepling his finger under his chin.
“I think allowing them to go entirely cold turkey is risky and can cause more difficulties than they are aware of. Not enough research has been done by this facility into the withdrawal process - they treat us like children.”
“You read a lot.”
Mycroft settled into the chair across from the bed, barely suppressing an eye roll.
“I will talk to management.” He turned to face Sherlock once more before he was escorted out of the room by the blonde. “Goodbye, brother dear. Keep out of trouble now, will you? I do worry.”
Mycroft stood, heeding the warning in his tone but having no true inclination to leave. At least not until he’d completed his task.
The question was probably rhetorical, the man was just ramblingly exhausted. But Sherlock, for all he had changed in here, was still a meretricious bastard at heart.
“I can’t.”
The guard, Sebestian, unlocked the door and Mycroft walked in - out of place in his three-piece suit. Seb looked to Sherlock, a silent question of if he was okay to be left alone.
“Sherlock.”
“I love you, Sherlock,” Jim muttered, oh so lightly, as he licked the shell of his ear. “I love you so goddamn much.”
Jim tried Sherlock’s facial expression after he finished. He looked… confused? Annoyed? Hurt? Maybe Jim had taken it too far this time and he’d just pushed him away. He didn’t want that, no, he really didn’t want -
Sherlock scoffed and collapsed back onto the bed.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes but nodded. The strange guard sat next to him then. He lowered his voice. “Jim’ll be ‘right, you know. He’s just not be sleeping well.”
“You need to stop.”
“Attempting to appeal to the better nature of a recovering junkie, Mycroft?” He let himself chuckle lightly. “They must be getting desperate.”
Mycroft smiled back, not letting himself be rattled. “Ah, little brother, it is heartening to hear you talk so… positively. This place must be doing wonders for you.”
Mycroft ran a hand through his thinning hair. It was a gesture that had supposedly been effectively stamped out by his parents, and then his PR team - Sherlock knew it only arose in moments of great stress now.
“Hm. Certainly appears that way, doesn’t it?” Sherlocked whipped. “And, in turn, that means you’re an active obstruction to the one shred of decent assistance they’re receiving.”
Sherlock flopped and faced the wall - he had not missed Mycroft’s company.
“Be realistic.”
A few months after Mycroft’s visit, the program was well underway. It proved a huge success. Even though Sherlock despised that Mycroft had named it ‘Project Holmes’.
The rest of their time they cuddled, but not how they had done before. Sherlock allowed Jim’s small body to rest on his lap and, without thinking about the book he was reading, they tangled their limbs around each other’s.
“Spare me the pretence of acting as if you don’t have half of the guards wrapped around your little finger - they’re all protecting you. None of them will admit they’re involved. every ‘random check’ comes back with nothing. Without the information or their cooperation, management cannot figure it out.”
Later, he casually questioned whether this was what the gentle pull towards insanity truly was - laced with comfort and the welcoming embrace of many.
And he meant it.
“Of sorts.” Mycroft posed.
Sherlock shook his head and didn’t feel inclined to watch him leave. Sherlock liked Seb - he was a steady man. An advantageous ally.
Mycroft took a deep breath and rolled back his shoulders. Sherlock was attempting to frustrate him to have him leave sooner. A clever tactic, yes, but sometimes he was almost laughably transparent. He stood his ground.
That night, Sherlock dreamed of Jim, of his brothers and of bullets.
'Yeah, okay… At least he couldn't get visual context.'
'YES I KNOW, JOHN. I KNOW EVERYTHING.'
'You were trying to flirt with that line?' John asks, grinning in amusement.
'John,' Sherlock says while pulling on gloves. 'Help me up and over so I can kneel down.'
Sherlock's heart stops.
'I… listen, I'm not gay!' And he's been dead for a couple of months, at least three.
'God, yes.'
Suppressing a flash of doubt in the Special Moment™ and a sigh, John gets up and walks over to the open plan kitchen. He ignores all the weird things (that thing swimming in the half-filled cup of coffee looks suspiciously like an eyeball) and grabs the opened envelope. After returning to the sofa, he leans against the backrest from the backside. Sherlock looks up at him, a bit excitedly but also like there's a silly booby trap inside the envelope. John takes out a sheet of paper and unfolds it. He feels Sherlock's eyes on him as he reads the title.
But in the second coffee break on this Thursday afternoon, John is not in Sherlock's room. Instead, he's suffering the third time of
'Your second name isn't Hamish?!'
'Boring.'
'Thrilling.'
'I love you, John,' Sherlock says quietly, like he often does at random moments now. Sometimes he taps it out in Morse code, on the tabletop, on John's skin or on his phone when it's on standby.
'He cares. And he knows the both of us.'
'No, I won't do it.'
As to be expected, the he can't keep hold of the glass. It drops when he tries to drink and by the time that John catches it, it's already empty. He sighs a little and walks back to the table to refill it. His brain has shoved the OH MY GOD HE IS AWAKE AND ALIVE AND COMMUNICATING away to switch to the Professional Mode™. There's still an awkward silence though.
'Thank you for saving me,' Sherlock says and suddenly sounds very genuine. 'And for forgiving me.'
'Sorry, what?' He scurries back.
'What, why?'
Mycroft frowns. 'He doesn't have a flat.'
'You wanting to date me was what helped me through the whole thing with finding out everything had been a dream. It was one of the few good changes,' Sherlock says and tips his chin up.
'Go on then.'
'Please, John. It's Christmas. Don't let him alone. Call me if there are any changes.' He hangs up.
'I will. Get some rest.' John smiles, even though he feels like he's losing something important.
'It's a cat, Sherlock.'
'Sorry, what?'
'You're in no position to talk to me like that,' he mutters. She's a nurse after all. He's the doctor. And this is his Sherlock–has John really just thought that? He straightens. 'Mr Holmes woke up from his coma last night. I talked to him and as it appears, he was able to hear what happened around him and thus knows about his state.'
'Why? Flirting doesn't work with you anyway.'
Watson.' Sherlock gives John a sour look.
Sherlock has dropped the file and tries to sit up again. 'Where's my coat?'
'Let me relax. Let me… do it again. Yes!'
'You know a lot of things I wouldn't bother to waste brain capacity on. What relevance does it have if we have a queen or a king?'
'Sherlock doesn't even know you, Dr Watson.'
'I know,' Sherlock says. He dips his head down to peck John's lips. 'You've never had sex with a man and I've never been this much–' He stops himself and frowns. 'You're important,' he says then and John knows what Sherlock means. Best friend. Love interest. Adventure companion. And Doctor, stupidly.
John mutters an apology and pays the cabbie as they stop. When he gets out of the cab and helps Sherlock into the wheelchair, the atmosphere is tense. Sherlock barely speaks until they're in his room.
For his own part, John has come to terms with his bisexuality by now. He's watched gay porn, bought magazines, allowed himself to imagine certain things, he's done research and twice he's gone to a gay bar. Once, he went as far as making out with a good-looking black man but he refused to go to the guy's apartment with him.
'Stop being so smug, you were dreaming about … what was it at that time? Running after a killer with me? Defeating a monstrous dog with me? Being saved by me?' he teases.
'Was that a swearword coming ou-ouh-t of your mouth?' John mocks which is undermined by the groans and gasps that are escaping his throat.
'Can we go home then?'
John stares at him.
'Do you have a secret pleasure like romances from the fifties?'
'I waited for this for a long time, John.' Groaning, he sits up. John watches him get up and walk to the en-suite bathroom to toss their used condoms.
Sally comes in suddenly and John tries to appear busy; checking this and that, taking the new bag with certain liquid she brought and replacing the old one.
Sherlock doesn't reply, just observing John with a slight frown on his face.
'Asked me stupid questions about that case from last week today,' Greg says and looks at John. 'He knows that I gave you the file! Man, Anderson and Donovan can both go fuck themselves.'
'Yes, Doctor Stapleton would be here, and no, no emergency, but Doctor Watson, you're just–'
'You want me to smuggle you out of the hospital?' he repeats dumbly.
'And?'
'You're free to greet me like this every time from now on,' Sherlock says eventually.
'Watch it, Holmes. You locked me in a military base and made me have hallucinations about a monster dog. I'm not going to forget that.'
'Right here,' Lestrade says after two corridors, pointing at an open door. In a rather small room, there's a man, leaning against the wall. The eyes are open and a trail of dried blood runs from his mouth down his chin and neck. John doesn't see a big wound, nor is the shirt very soaked so it has to be either a wound on the back or just internal bleeding.
John turns his head. Oh god.
Mike laughs again. 'Man, I didn't mean that time! I meant when you were hiding in a literal closet with him. To be fair, you were dead drunk.'
'You don't have a phone, as far as I'm informed,' John says.
'A woman?!'
Yet, right now, he finds himself feeling as if he's drunken five energy drinks. Not my Sherlock, he thinks as he jumped up and rushes over to the bed (walking stick? What walking stick? What limp?). He checks the monitor again, then the tubes and everything. He's John Watson, he knows what to do.
Sherlock gives him an annoyed look. 'You think I'd really do that?'
Fuck, John thinks. He didn't want a date with me, he thinks we're really just friends or anything. Fuck,
'What?'
'John?' Sherlock asks quietly.
'Uh, leave her out of this, for god's sake.' He clenches hard again.
'Thinking about me being naked probably.'
'Gottle of geer,' someone in the telly chants. 'Gottle of geer. Gottle-' One of the nurses turns the telly off. At least, she doesn't have time right now to ask why the hell John was watching TV in a coma patient's room.
'Greg Lestrade.'
'You know what,' Lestrade says, 'at least he never had to be serious with you while looking at that stupid moustache.'
Now he does glance at John, the small smile gone. 'He's certainly not. Make a guess. What do you think he does?'
Sherlock leads him around a building and there are police cars and yellow tape. Obviously, John shouldn't be excited about this but he can't help it. When Lestrade brought him case files, he imagined going with Sherlock to the cases. Lestrade said that Sherlock came several times before the coma.
John huffs a laugh and steps away. This is not the standard procedure for a patient waking up from the coma. He should be going home anyway and leave this to a doctor whose shift is now. He should call Mycroft.
'He may be servant for the tea.'
They quickly make their way to an elevator. Luckily, their cab is already waiting outside. Even if Sherlock didn't do anything himself, the short trip already exhausted him and he leans back and closes his eyes as the driver leaves the parking of the hospital.
Well. While Sherlock's blood levels seem to be on the way to getting better, his heart beat loses the steadiness it once possessed.
'You got married? To whom?'
After leaning the walking stick against the small table and sitting down, John opens the paper to start reading the case to Sherlock.
There's a small smile on Sherlock's face. 'You really think you're falling… in love with me?' he asks sheepishly. 'You didn't just say that, did you? Be honest.'
John chews on his lip, packing the phone away, and then turns to Jeanette. 'I'm really sorry,' he says.
'I'm your Doctor.'
John snickers. 'How's my writing style?'
The man just smirks. 'Reminds us of something, doesn't it?'
'I have to be there when they question Smith. You know the imbeciles at Scotland Yard! They'll ask only stupid questions, in the end he'll talk himself out of it! That's a serial killer, John!
'The woman woman!'
'He smoked regularly, here's a small pack of cigarettes, that window over there is wide open and on the sill are remnants of ash. If we assume he worked here, this room was where he smoked in his break. Where's his lighter and how did he lose it?' John elaborates. From the corner of his eye he sees a proud smile on Sherlock's face.
'You and Jeanette broke up over … me?' he asks at one point, frowning.
'Bottom drawer of the bedstand,' he mutters, sliding his hands to John's belt. 'Mind if I…?'
'But…
'This is nice,' he says when they leave the elevator. 'I've been in that room for too long.'
Sherlock is sitting in a wheelchair near the ticket counters, waiting. The wheels are small and there's a joystick on one armrest. John walks faster. It feels like he's the only Londoner here.
'You had four months to overthink,' John says. 'I thought you're good at that; thinking.'
Sherlock thinks for a moment. 'I was attracted right away,' he says, 'and I really wanted to be friends with you. But I didn't dare hope for more, especially not as you went out with one woman after the other. I think I was still in denial of my jealousy the first time we celebrated Christmas together but I accepted it eventually. Then I needed to fake my own death and when I returned, I interrupted your proposal to Mary.' There's a faint smile playing on his lips. 'You asked me to be your best man once you were done being angry with me.'
'John? John, who is it?' Mary asks behind him, probably following.
'I'll tell you when Lestrade calls.'
'I'm not gay, Mike!'
Mycroft becomes serious again. 'It's a new mixture called “Moriarty”. The dealer who sold it to Sherlock is a certain Bruce Partington, but the origin isn't clear. I'll have them found and imprisoned, don't you worry.'
John grins, closing the door of the cab and leaning back in the seat. 'It's nice to know something you don't.'
It's his turn to toss the condoms, Sherlock declares and John indulges. When he returns, Sherlock's lying under the blankets and as soon as John is in reach, he gets pulled closer.
No answer, but John has quitted feeling foolish for talking to Sherlock a long time ago.
'Nobody else here to take care? Or is it an emergency?'
Sherlock sighs. 'I think there are unused bowls in the freezer. I wanted to use them for an experiment. Oh, maybe we can just use one and share it?'
They stare at each other for several moments.
Sherlock's smile grows wistful and sad. 'We were just flatmates but on the second day, you killed a man to save my life.'
'Oh, what's his name?' a certain nurse asks him when he tells her. She's the only one here he genuinely likes.
'Yes,' Sherlock mutters, running his hands over John's chest. 'God, yes, I've dreamt about this too many times.'
'You can go harder than that, don't worry,' he breathes, gripping John's arms. 'More… more… fuck, yes.'
'I managed to make you laugh a bit. Does that not mean I was successful?' Sherlock shoots back.
'Fifteen,' Sherlock replies. 'You?'
'This was a bad idea,' he says. 'Why am I doing this? What if I lose my job in the end?'
'She told me to make dinner for you.'
It's heavy and deep, hands are running over backs, chests and arses, pulling slightly at hair. John's lying on top of Sherlock on the sofa eventually, enjoying the easy slide of tongues.
'Just … just go for it,' Sherlock finally manages out and smiles a bit, trying to catch his breath.
Sherlock carefully slides out of his wheelchair, kneeling on the floor by the victim's feet. From a pocket he draws a small magnifying glass and examines the soles of the old trainers. He lifts the hem of the jeans to take a sniff before waving at John, giving him the sign to come over.
'You care.'
'I'm your doctor.' But he realises he likes Sherlock calling him a friend. John has often thought that when Sherlock wakes up, he'd just stalk out of the room. It's undeniable that he means something to John, but he'd always thought that it wasn't like this the other way around, even if he'd pretended things to be different. John clears his throat. 'Detective Inspector Lestrade.'
He keeps on thrusting, gentler though, slower, but god, John's close, too.
It's been nearly four months, when he gets a text from an unknown number while doing the dishes:
John helps him into it. He's brought the wheelchair right away so he pushed it next to the bed and lifts Sherlock by reaching around his torso. This time, Sherlock clutches onto him and feels less limp in John's arms. John's weirdly conscious of every place where they touch, especially when Sherlock's thigh presses against John's crotch. Now John is almost sure he's bisexual.
'I doubt John Clive Watson will like being your substitute for someone else.'
John closes his eyes for a moment, considering jumping from the rooftop. 'Yes, yes, sorry for that,' he mumbles, but suddenly remembers Sherlock's excited “yes”. He looks at him and squints his eyes a bit. 'You were totally in for it,' he says incredulously. 'You thought we're best friends and nearly died together a couple of times and, and you were surprised by my terrible flirting but you…' John stops because Sherlock looks utterly mortified. 'Sorry,' he mutters again, stepping back.
He grabs Sherlock's thigh, hitching it higher on his hip to change the angle.
'What?'
John clears his throat. 'I was joking. About the sexy thing. I didn't mean anything, it's all just fine,' he rambles.
you. Makes it hard to get used to the thought that we didn't really go through all those things together.'
'Maybe I'll introduce you to the joy of having a cock up your arse,' Sherlock whispers when he breaks away. 'Pressing over your prostrate with every single thrust.' He highlights the last three words with a grind of his hips each.
- “I know, Sherlock. I do too. But it’s in good way… right?”
- “Thank you, Sherlock. That’s very nice of you.”
They ate slowly while talking about the case and both of them began relaxing as their stomachs filled and the wine left them with a tingling sensation in their bodies. When they were done with their food, they took their wine glasses and moved over to sit in their chairs across from each other. They sat there looking at the fire and each other and talked about everything and nothing all at once and at some point they realised that the wine bottle was empty, so Sherlock went into the kitchen to retrieve another.
They had had to relearn everything they thought they knew about themselves. It hadn’t been an easy process and both of them had fought it with everything they had for years. But after everything that had happened – the fall, Mary, Rosie, Eurus – that should have torn them apart, they somehow only grew closer, and lately they had been fighting the change in dynamics much less. Somehow they had both come to the realization that maybe – just maybe – they belonged together and that they actually deserved love and peace in their lives. But they had yet to take the biggest step; To actually acknowledge this out loud to each other. Both of them had a strong suspicion that the other felt the same, but years of doubt and self-criticism still crept under their skin and prevented them from actually taking that leap of faith. From actually standing in front of the other – stripped from their suit of armour and with all of their guards down – and laying their love on the line. They were both still too scared. So for now they settled with what they had. They showed their affection by little touches here and there – a hand at the small of a back when going out the door, a squeeze of an arm when giving the other a cup of tea, a brush of a hand on a shoulder when passing each other – and by lingering looks and warm and affectionate smiles. But oh how they both hungered for more.
John could feel the warmth emanating from Sherlock and, longing to be even closer to him, pulled him in a little bit. It was as if they somehow melted into each other and John could hardly tell where he ended and where Sherlock began.
- “Yes. It’s very pleasant. It’s nice with a change from the violin and the classical music.”
Sherlock gave John a soft smile, when he realised he had put on music, and went over to pour some wine in John’s glass. They both sat back down and shared a tentative smile over their glasses.
Sherlock smiled a half-smile at John and got a light red tint to his cheeks at John’s touch. They stood there and looked at each other with small smiles and warm eyes, until Sherlock lightly cleared his throat and broke the spell. They started fixing plates of food and brought it to the table in the living room. John went back into the kitchen and opened a bottle of red wine and brought that and two wine glasses to the table and sat down across from Sherlock.
"Tissue. Please."
The door is already open and he finds himself outside.
“Hmm?”
He gently picks the baby up and, for the first time outside of feeding, holds it against his chest. The boy’s breathing is shaky but slowly calms. Sherlock awkwardly rocks him, until his breathing slows and he falls asleep.
"He doesn't seem upset."
“No, John. No. I… I did this. I made this decision. I just wanted the pain to go away… I’m not a good father. Mycroft said… Mycroft said it was my fault they died…”
A familiar voice answers. “Lestrade. Who is this?”
Shaking his head, Sherlock hurries to reassure him. "No, all the walls in this place are soundproof, especially the office. Mycroft can't be too careful in his line of work."
John turns back and raises his gun towards the man in question. He notices the look of panic that strikes the royal family member's face.
"As the months went by, she became less interested in sex. I was relieved, to put it mildly. There was a routine, but not the same as with Jack; she insisted on interacting with him. She was pleased because he looked like me; dark curls and blue eyes. She knew why I called him William and it pleased her. I was doing anything to keep her happy. But then, about two years later, when I was ninteen I was asleep and..."
“I like your dreams, Pa.”
“Here,” says John, holding out his arms, “You need medical attention. Let me take Jack. I’ll stay right here, I promise.”
John holds up his hand, cutting him off. He leans towards Sherlock, studying his face. The man’s eyes are twitching, and John suddenly notices a few beads of sweat. He’s breathing far too fast. He’s starting to lose it.
She smiles and hugs me tight. “He has to be the one to decide that dear. But in my eyes, he is very special to me.”
"Shut up," hisses John, but he lowers his weapon, "You have no idea what I live with everyday."
John ventures lower down to Sherlock’s belly button, where he dips his tongue in, making Sherlock grip his head tighter. He chuckles, causing Sherlock to wriggle and bite his lip.
Stamford smiles unpatronizingly and scribbles some notes. "Excellent, that's brilliant news. Okay, all yours, detective."
The Witch looks at Old Magnussen. “I believe you were tired of the passenger seat.” She grins. “It’s your go.” She glances back at Sherlock. “Face him, not me.”
Anyway, thank you all (if there are Indeed any of you left), for your patience and understanding (if you have any left) because so many of you told me to put the story on hold so I embraced me schoolwork, wrote 50 pages about innovations in British Libraries and whether or not they would work in France, got a 16/20, am now nominated for an award for best thésis. And then I fell into a coma consisting of ice-cream and johnlock fanfics, drooling at my screen.
"Sherlock? Sherlock! Snap out of it!"
Sherlock doesn’t solve all of his cases. Simply because if there’s an important clue that only he would be able to recognise and no one sees it for him, he cannot conclude his theories for Lestrade. But he’s done well. According to the infamous detective, he’s solved 59 of his 63 cases. He should probably be in the Guinness world record book for most cases solved by a blind detective or something. Sherlock would probably sneer at the mere idea of it. Maybe he should just suggest it anyway, just to watch those artistically shaped lips curl. Oh boy, has he fallen hard or what? He’s
“No pulse,” he states quietly and reaches to pull the rest of Rug off Jack’s face.
"A boy." Lestrade nods encouragingly and John holds him tighter. "I called him William; that's my first name. It seemed fitting. When he was born, I had to help deliver the baby. She wouldn't go to hospital for fear of suspicion. She blamed them for the death of her first child, but I think her daughter was stillborn."
"You alright, mate?" he asks, for the second time that day.
Anthea grabs Mary and Lestrade grabs Magnussen. They drag the pair kicking and screaming to the edge of the six-foot-deep hole and push them in.
Squawking from Mycroft interrupts them. It's obvious who's losing. "Do we have to? Things are getting better."
- “John…” Sherlock said in a half sigh and it was the most beautiful way John had ever heard his name being said. “John, I… I feel…” Sherlock’s words died at that, but John knew what he was trying to say.
John chuckled at him and lightly put his hand between Sherlock’s shoulder blades as he was getting plates from the cabinet.
- “Is it okay? The music I mean?”
For a few moments, John is quiet (part of him is still wondering how he can stand like this, without the cane). 'So… you do … remember everything that happened?' he asked slowly. It is indeed quite possible: a coma where the person hears and feels everything but cannot react.
'Yes, yes. The desk!'
'It looked good!' John complains.
John turns. 'Which suit do you want then?'
Mycroft grips the bar at the end of the bed hard, his knuckles almost white. 'Of everything. Everything he's taken. There's always been a list.'
'Why?'
They all go to that woman's place after finding out her address and Sherlock doesn't need more than one look around her bathroom to prove her guilt. His cold and analytical demeanour towards her is a new side of him. It almost scares John but then Sherlock turns around to look at him, just as if he wants appreciation. John smiles a bit.
Sherlock gives John disconcerted look. 'Not that I'm an expert on babies, but I believe that's not what you're supposed to do with them.'
'Rosie shoved the Thatcher bust off the mantle of the fireplace but we forgave her right away.'
They've just reached a room, the stretcher stilling finally as the man opens his eyes, staring directly at John. 'Of course Wilson is the killer, you must have seen the ink in the victim's lymph knots!' He speaks confusingly quickly, voice dark and clear, just a bit rough. Probably from previous vomiting.
'There wasn't one.'
Sherlock glares. 'Go away.'
'Well,
John chuckles.
He looks away, a little nervous suddenly. He wanted to ask the question later. 'So, er … listen, um…' Calm down Watson, he tells himself off, you're not proposing or so, you're just asking if she'd like to move in with you. 'I know it hasn't been long, but … if you see me almost every day now, I moved into a bigger flat, so could you imagine… um, could you see your way to…'
'It was my fault that Mary died,' Sherlock said, stiffening. 'You said so, too. That I killed her.'
Once he's done, he doesn't exactly know what to do next. Are they gonna do it like this? Another position?
'But as I gathered,' Sherlock says when they break apart several minutes later, 'you used to talk to me a lot. In reality. You said you didn't just read out case files and novels but you told me about your day and thoughts. Considering that I showed no sign of understanding, you probably didn't fake anything. And you must have interacted with other people in my presence. Friends, girlfriends, colleagues, Mycroft, Lestrade… That should have given me a relatively broad spectrum and obviously, my vast intellect makes up for the fact I had no visual context.'
'Yeah, why not? I'm your doctor, I know what you can eat.'
'Solve the case. I'm going to get some coffee.' Because he wants to stay. It's the middle of the night but John wants to be the one taking care of his patient and he wants to see if Sherlock is really as good as they say. He doesn't want to go home yet.
John shifts closer, putting a leg over Sherlock's waist and turning his head with a hand on his cheek. 'Well, I'm definitely falling now, I think,' he says quietly.
'This is even worse than in my mind!' Sherlock says loudly. 'I am glad you didn't keep that.'
He returns to him. 'No, I'm not,' he says softly. Why would he be angry at a patient for spilling some water?! 'I don't approve of the drugs, though.'
He finishes as they're nearly back at the hospital. John's absolutely amazed. And he has to admit, he likes the version of them in that story. 'Your mind came up with all of that? That's–'
'Yes!' Sherlock says immediately. 'We'll text.'
'I'd rather have no-one dying at all,' he replies and she smiles a little. She's right though.
In the tube he would have missed his stop if it wasn't for the routine that makes him get out at the same stop every day. He would take the right stop if he were a brainless zombie.
'I’m his doctor, let me come through,' he mumbles frantically and reaches the bed. 'Let me come through, please. No, he’s my patient. He’s mine. Please.'
John looks at it as if it's suddenly alive as well. His gaze flicks back to Sherlock, then he grabs one of the glasses and the water bottle that is also standing there for visitors. He gets up and brings the filled glass to Sherlock. By now, Sherlock has figured out how to use the remote to lift the top end of the bed to make him sit up.
Sherlock sighs and slumps back in the bed. 'Can we go out and smoke?'
'I'll rather take it with me then, I guess. All the other nurses and visitors, you know. I have to come here every day anyway.'
Confident now, John thrusts faster, establishing a rhythm. Sherlock moans with every roll of John's hips.
'No, I said…' John stops himself. 'I mean. I…'
'I don't need luck, it's going to be fun.'
Sherlock actually blushes. 'Semantics.'
It's easier to stick with the facts: Sherlock Holmes didn't die right away. They found out several of his organs were irrecoverably damaged. His brother managed to get him transferred to another hospital, not in London. John hasn't heard of Mycroft ever since, nor of Lestrade.
Sherlock pulls a face. 'That sounds awful.'
John gives him a look. 'New to going on dates with men. Hence the awful flirting.' He feels his pulse going fast after he's made it clear he considers this a date.
John smiles back. This is going better than he thought. So Sherlock is into men. Apparently. Unless he meant that he isn't the kind of person for relationships…? John reads the same line in the menu for the third time.
Finally John's reached Sherlock's room, stepped in and shut the door into Anderson's face. Ah, silence. He has indeed watched TV with Sherlock yesterday. When his shift was over, he stopped by again and told Sherlock about those abducted kids. It had been in the news. And oh, they were on right then, so within a few seconds the TV was switched on. The volume was turned down however. Just in case there might come an alarm sound from the monitor. They watched the telly together because there was indeed a report about the kidnapped children. After the news, a film started, some modern thriller mash-up of Grimm's fairy tales and the legendary Round Table of King Arthur. John left it on for Sherlock when he went home.
Sherlock blinks and nods.
'I'm trying to help you, mate.'
'You like it, that's enough.'
Three months.
John laughs. 'Are you taking a cab?' he asks then and gets a nod for an answer. 'I'm taking the tube.'
They are five people standing around a hospital bed, talking about the man lying there and trying to ignore that their impromptu Christmas party seems a bit like a funeral. It's not because he could wake up anytime. He's breathing and alive, after all. But the conversations die out nevertheless eventually. Molly has to leave, the nurse does. Lestrade tells John how he got it sorted with his wife now, since she's cheated on him a while ago. John drinks away Sherlock's champagne and Jeanette eats the biscuit, he stops the music and puts the phone into his pocket. It's turning dark outside when they leave the hospital and head for the nearest tube station. It's snowing, so they rush.
'Me. Well, the other me.'
John leans forward to read it. 'Yes,' he says then. 'Yes, you can,
'No!'
'No! You can't-'
In the real world, John's there, as usual. And Sherlock doesn't move. Nothing happens at all. The crime novel he's reading (out loud) is exciting though. In the end he goes back home late, very late. John
John takes a deep breath. 'You came to the hospital about one year ago,' John starts. 'With an ambulance. You had an overdose of a drug called “Moriarty” and after telling me about a killer and the victim's lymph knots you fell unconscious. That was the first time we met. I'm your doctor.'
'Any new tasks from the therapist? I didn't ask the other day.'
'He did call you when he needed help for writing his best man speech for my wedding.'
'I don't care, give me a case!' He tilts his head a bit. 'Please?'
'I did save your life more than once, you know.' He sits down in the armchair by the window.
'You mentioned him last week!'
The novel of the mysterious ghost hound is the first that John reads aloud again. It's a good one, he feels like sharing it with Sherlock, having thought of him when he bought it. They watch telly together sometimes, Lestrade doesn't stop by very often anymore, but shoots John a text now and then. Peace returns. Or as peaceful as it could get with Sherlock still being in a god-damn coma.
'John, John! The woman is on TV!'
It's in the cab when they go quiet, and in the lights of the cars and lamps, John sees how Sherlock's eyes glistening with tears.
When it vibrates again, he nearly drops the phone into the sink.
'You OK?' Mary asks.
'Need to look at the flat as well,' Sherlock says.
'Why me?'
'How did he react?' Mike asks curiously, ordering another set of beers for them. 'My money is on him hanging up.'
When they leave the pub much later, the silence is a bit awkward.
'Oh, but he's your date tonight,' John quips, opening the fourth cupboard.
'Hey! It's a perfectly normal name.'
'I was thinking of starting with the Serial Suicides and the cabbie. Mike Stamford introducing us to each other, the first case.'
He really is damn tired the next morning.
In hopes to make him smile, John shows Sherlock a picture on his phone.
'Moriarty is back?!'
'You pay tonight.'
John shakes his head. 'But I know a fair bit in theory.'
'Oh, so you found what I said sexy?' Sherlock asks, raising an eyebrow.
John glances at Lestrade. 'Is it okay?'
Sherlock swallows and opens his mouth, but then he just shrugs and looks to the window. 'No. Go ahead.'
'I changed you last week, I still remember what you look like naked.' After he's said it, John realises that this is not date flirting.
Especially, when Sherlock returns and fires off one deduction after the other. Suspect number one is apparently a colleague's sister.
'Do you think, Saturday is going to be the glorious night, Doctor John Watson finally gets a cock up his arse?'
'That's horrendously sentimental,' Sherlock says and starts tuning his instrument. 'You're going to get it mixed up anyway.'
, for one, am not going to fire you,' Sherlock says and gives John a crooked smile.
'Didn't need cigarettes or cocaine when I had a good case.'
'No!' John says and pulls the wheelchair back and away from the door.
'John?'
Sherlock doesn't react.
'Don't wanna kiss a Clive?' John says and puts the certificate and the envelope on a cupboard nearby.
Not stopping the kiss, John slips his fingers between his legs again, the other hand lying on the small of Sherlock's back. Sherlock moans into John's mouth when John carefully presses the tip of his digit into him. Slowly, he pushes his finger further until it's as far in as possible.
John looks up, offended. 'Hey!'
'Then don't stress yourself over it. Don't think too much.'
John huffs. 'Only because you didn't get it up in your wedding night.'
'Not what your therapist thinks.'
'We have a body waiting,' Sherlock says and tries to steer the wheelchair through the crowd.
Mycroft rolls his eyes but plays along. 'MP3-Player, he likes classics. Violin.'
'Oh, come on, John.' Sherlock's voice sounds weirdly seductive.
Sherlock leans forward, putting a hand on John's arm. 'You keep seeing her, don't you?'
John laughs. 'Nope, but he must know and if he minded, I'd know for sure.'
'Hi,' he says when he reaches Sherlock. They haven't seen each other for months but Sherlock looks just like John remembers him. His curls are wild and he's wearing a suit, his coat and a scarf over it. His gaze is piercing as if he can look right into John's soul. There's this sour look on Sherlock's face when John greets him with a grin.
John can't help a small smile, leaning against his kitchen counter as he types.
'Mary lied to me about something and we had a fight.' On this day, he stays at Sherlock's for a while after finishing work.
'What for?'
'Yeah. I am gay, by the way, just to get that straight.'
'That would be good. Call a nurse to get me changed, okay?'
John wonders if Sherlock still wants his number but he doesn't dare to ask so he just nods and turns to leave. None of the two says another word.
'But John, this–'
It is day three and now they have officially identified this as a coma. John stops by with his cup of coffee and a newspaper. Unsurprisingly, it is comfortably quiet in Sherlock's room.
But there aren't any flat lines. This isn't an American cliché film after all, this is Sherlock Holmes in a real coma with one computer by his side that showed one steady heartbeat line and several numbers and symbols. It's those. They are, just like the beeping sound, rather alarming and would have about the same effect as a double espresso on John.
'Let me try…' Sherlock's arms shake but he manages sitting up at the second attempt.
John has told him about other cases, too, reading out the papers to him. He's also installed a coffee machine in Sherlock's room. For visitors, of course. Mycroft Holmes or Detective Inspector Lestrade, who appears rather in need for Sherlock to wake up. Once he even brought a full case file. 'We never know when the day comes and Sherlock wakes up,' he muttered and placed the folder on a shelf. 'What if it's today, John? I'll just leave this here, keep it secret, yeah?'
It is still comfortably quiet in Sherlock's room. He's still in the coma. John has to go there regularly, to make this clear. It's his patient and he has to check twice a day. But he's still in the coma. Status quo, no change at all.
'I want a case!'
'Ready to go, Mr Holmes?' He asks when Sherlock's in the wheelchair.
'YOU JUST WOKE UP!' …oh for fuck's sake. What's this? Shouting at patients?
He's only walking up the corridor the late afternoon, in casual clothes and on the way home when he sees people go in and come out of Sherlock's room in a hurry. Anxiously he speeds up, nearly bumping into Sally Donovan. 'What’s going on?'
'His name's Greg?'
It is John's turn to sigh then, getting up as well. A bit later, he goes home and the next day, today, is his day off so he stays at home. The small, dark flat is downright depressing.
'Who?'
When Sherlock sits down, John steps over to the light switch and suddenly it's less dark in the room. The wallpaper though is of a dark, cold blue and Sherlock's pale face is a stark contrast against the shadows behind him. He's beautiful, smiling up at John like that. It's not the first time John's here: two weeks ago there's been a case and they pulled an all nighter. It had been half seven in the morning when they got to Sherlock's flat, excitement wearing off and exhaustion taking over. Especially with Sherlock. He hadn't said anything apart from a small, muttered “thanks” when John helped him into bed. John himself had been tired so after making sure Sherlock was fine, he left to go home. He'd barely even looked around the flat then but now, he glances at the furniture, the open kitchen and the tall windows. It's far from tidy in the flat. When John's gaze focuses on a microscope on the kitchen table, Sherlock's dark voice cuts the silence.
His heart isn't beating anymore.
'Harry is not short for Harriet?' Sherlock asks, looking absolutely irritated.
'John…'
'What you mean is wanked about it.'
There isn't an MP3-Player, though. The music that fills the room comes from John's phone. It's a spontaneous act, really: on Christmas Eve, two weeks after the encounter with Mycroft, John's at work, but free to go in the late afternoon. He'd already got rid off the white doctor clothes and Jeanette had just arrived to fetch him. They were on their way down the corridor when John saw a familiar face walking up to him. There was a brief round of 'Hello's and 'Merry Christmas's, John introducing Detective Inspector Lestrade to Jeanette, and his lovely girlfriend Jeanette to Lestrade. Who was on the way to Sherlock, as it turned out.
'No.'
'Well, I had a great evening,' John says and smiles. 'I started out as a very unusual date, but I had a great time.'
John stops. 'I'm a doctor. I see naked people often enough, it's no difference. I've seen you naked before, too.' There's a pause. 'Of course, we don't have to do this. You can just stay here.'
Just when they reach the platform, John phone chimes. Jeanette rolls her eyes but grins a little. Her mood is getting better since they headed off for an evening with nobody else but them.
'Doctor, I know–'
'It's gonna come very soon, isn't it? His end.' She pats John's back and he knows she's mocking him. 'But don't be scared, John. He'll by lying down just like now, except there's less of a need for medical help.'
'I thought your full name is John
He opens his mouth to say something, but she shakes her head. 'You don't even know him,' she says. 'Yet you keep mentioning him. Don't make me compete with a stranger, John. You know what? Don't call me again. Merry Christmas.' She storms off and John's left alone in midst the crowd.
Sherlock slowly sinks down again, not looking at John. 'Ah, yes,' he says, tone emotionless. 'Yes, it makes sense to say that. It was very good.'
Mycroft sighs.
'Lean back a bit or lie down,' Sherlock instructs. He has his knees on either of John's hips and lifts a bit, curling his long fingers around John's cock to position himself above it. Leaning on his arms, John watches, making a quiet sound when the tip of his erection slides against Sherlock's rim.
Sherlock cocks his head to the side. 'Can I have a glass of water?'
'Me too.' Sherlock smiles back. 'It's weird to look up at you. I'm rather tall actually, you know?'
Sherlock rolls his eyes and leans back, obviously exhausted. 'You're so much like the version of you I know,' he mutters. 'Well, that
John thinks for a few moments, before turning around and asking Lestrade about the victim's lighter.
When John enters Sherlock's room Friday night, he's wearing nice clothes. Sherlock is not. Sherlock isn't wearing any clothes, to be precise.
Sherlock presses his face against John's chest.
He goes back to the hospital, picks up a book he's forgotten there the other day and reads it. Silently.
'John.'
John searches desperately for the right answer.
Sherlock shakes his head, gripping John's shoulder as he moves forward and carefully let's his hands wander over the dead man's chest. 'I want your medical opinion,' Sherlock whispers back and then gives John all the information he has. 'So? What would you say?'
Sherlock shrugs. 'Thank you for dinner,' he mutters, lips shaking. He turns his head and looks out of the window. 'At least I didn't have to make you believe I was dead.'
'The junkie's stopped breathing.'
'You might want to see what's in the envelope on the kitchen counter,' Sherlock announces. By now the smile is in fact rather smug and pleased.
'He's indeed over the moon to hear that you're awake,' John informs Sherlock after anding the call. 'He'll come by tomorrow.'
'Don't go away,' he mumbles against John's lips and breaks away again. 'But don't call me stupid again. And put more sugar into my tea next time, while we're at it.'
One of the elder nurses came in, as well, and just at the same time, a young woman arrived, too. She's been here before, a pathologist called Molly Hooper. Sherlock used to examine the corpses or experiment with them, she said. Beat one up with a riding crop once. And to leave the topic of dead people with bruises and get back to a joyful Christmas mood, John then selected a playlist on YouTube. The nurse fetches some of the cookies she's made the other day and hands them around, John catches Lestrade placing a case file with a little red ribbon somewhere and Molly has brought a bar of chocolate that she hides in the pocket of the Belstaff coat that's been hanging in the corner since day one. The only thing John has is a bottle of champagne that's meant for later but Molly agrees to fetch paper cups from a water dispenser. Jeanette isn't exactly pleased until John mutters a promise to buy another bottle on the way to her place. They fill a cup for Sherlock, too. Because what if today's the day? What if? That's why there's also a biscuit lying next to the drink.
'Oh. Good to now. I mean, it's fine. It's all fine.'
'No! Here! Now! Why is Mary alive? What is Moriarty? What this thing with the coma?'
John gave a weak smile. 'I'll even describe the pictures to him, I promise.'
'Have you had your special moment then?' Slumping back into the couch, Sherlock sighs heavily.
'And you call your therapist ridiculous?' John asks after reading it. He can't help but snicker. 'Or are you just doing this to piss her off?'
'That's good,' Sherlock says. 'I suppose, I'm five years ahead of you. Well, I thought it was five years.' He swallows, watching John with uncertainty in his expression. 'I duly apologise for ruining the mood.'
No yes and no no.
John wonders how he can ask about the whole thing with the dream. Actually, he is dying to ask Sherlock to tell him more about their adventures. They're inspired by the reality and over the past months, John couldn't stop fantasising.
Sherlock groans. 'I didn't have much material to go by, especially not considering my brain was only hearing you, not seeing anything. Besides, it was years ago!'
Sherlock smirks. 'We'll see how well you'll do.'
'Why didn't you say something last week then?' Sherlock snaps, pouting a bit. This should be considered childish, but John finds it cute.
Sherlock freezes.
'Baskerville?'
Sherlock asks more questions and slowly, John gets an idea of what his dream has been like. He kind of wishes it could have been the truth. They order food eventually and John makes Sherlock eat something as they keep talking. It's amazing how Sherlock stays this calm and attentive. His whole world is out of joint.
. 'One that misses the war and loves the thrill.'
'You're a sweet person, Sherlock Holmes.'
'Boooh! Hypocrite!'
'Cleared my name!'
'Get up and see for yourself, Watson.'
John stares for a moment. 'For the records,
'I'm making tea, do you have any clean cups?' he calls over.
Sherlock nods. 'Even though you spent the better half of the evening looking at my lips and thinking about it,' he says. The cocky smirk returns and he doesn't allow John to reply.
John laughs nervously. 'I… I just want to make it good for you.' He presses his lips to Sherlock's neck, maybe mostly to hide his face for a moment.
Of course, John could text Mycroft, but Mycroft could just as well give Sherlock John's number if Sherlock wanted to talk to him again.
With a muttered apology he takes the mobile out of the coat pocket and accepts the call, turning a bit away.
They stare at each other for several moments.
Sherlock smirks. 'Just tick the right box, John.'
John nods and tucks the clipboard under the leg of the trembling man on the stretcher so it won't get lost. The nurse does most of the work, John rather steering with one hand (the other one on the bloody walking cane).
'Mycroft? No, thanks.' With remarkable strength, he shifts to the edge. Sherlock tilts over when he attempts to get up and John catches him. The wet fabric of the gown is pressed against his own shirt and he feels Sherlock's fast breath against his neck.
She and John are standing at the end of Sherlock's bed, watching him breathe and do nothing. He's still the coma, but doing much better than before his “death”. During a call half an hour later Mycroft has told John that he'd brought his younger brother to a secret government whatever-John's-better-off-not-knowing-any-details place. There he had experts implant a new heart, a new liver and a new set of kidneys, as well as special medicine. The newest there was. John personally thinks Mycroft had scientists develop it just for Sherlock. Someone so close to death wouldn't have got new organs normally either, but Mycroft had easily got some from a criminal network in Serbia. After the biggest danger was over, the younger Holmes brother had still enjoyed special treatment for the past months but now, according to Mycroft, it was time to reunite him with a doctor who genuinely cares. 'Do I?' John had asked and snorted, to which Mycroft had laughed a little and said, 'Admit it, you missed him.' And so, John took care of Sherlock himself and was now standing there with Mary and looking at him.
John forces a smile, eyes back on Sherlock. Did he call it a date to make sure John would come or does he actually consider it one? Had he had big feelings for the John he knew? Is this actually going somewhere?
'From experiments, too,' Sherlock says with a shrug. 'Molly Hooper managed to get me a heap of fresh toes from pathology.'
'Well, it would be coping mechanism to deal with the loss of my heroic John Hamish Watson.'
'The man with that story is in drug rehab now,' John continues. 'But the action was like advertisement. The mixture itself is still being sold, big client list…'
'I'll explain it to you when I've found something.'
The frown deepens.
'I met Greg! He's glad you're not gone,' John tells him another time.
'Ah, Sherlock, fuck!'
'Never liked you,' John mutters under his breath as she leaves.
'Tell me everything you know so far,' Sherlock commands and Lestrade gives him a notepad. 'John, push me so I can focus on this.'
'Are you nervous?'
'Turns out, you're the loud one,' Sherlock bites out, smirking.
'I'm your best friend?' John asks. 'Are you trying to friend-zone me?'
Which started a discussion about Sherlock doing his own shopping and John not being his maid to run errands for him. Obviously, John agreed eventually and it earned him another thorough bout of snogging just when the doors to the elevator opened. They had to call it again minutes later and John grinned at Sherlock before the doors were closed. Sherlock had grinned back.
'Shut up.'
'221B Bakerstreet,' Sherlock mutters. He turns his head to look at John. 'I need to ask Mrs Hudson a few questions.'
?' John asks when he meets Molly in Sherlock's room.
'I'll bring “Casablanca” next week. We might need to watch it on my laptop if your TV doesn't have a DVD player.' He sighs. 'Pity you can't see anything.'
When John slowly shakes his head, Sherlock looks disappointed but he wipes that expression off his face within a split second.
'John… Ah. Finally. God, you slept for an eternity. Tedious.'
'How's therapy going?' John asks.
When he gets no reply he continues talking, telling him in more detail what drugs they've been able to find in Sherlock's blood, what they know about the drugs he'd been taking before.
'Yes!' Sherlock says, then he frowns at himself. 'I mean.' He stops and blinks. 'What is going on? You want to get … romantically involved with me? Sexually?'
'No, tell him when you see him!'
'Now, then, what did you want to ask me?'
'Well, clearly
'Anyone
Sherlock smirks. 'Well,
'We got the cat.' He sighs. 'To be honest, I would rather have a dog. Well, we wouldn't have the time to walk it anyway, I guess.'
When they arrive, Sherlock is much more awake again but Mrs Hudson isn't at home. Or she's sleeping. Nobody opens the door anyway.
'Nope,' Sherlock mutters, and pops the p. He focuses on the menu.
'John?' he says, smile growing now and his voice is that quiet, dark rumble that John… fell in love with? No! Came to love? No, no. Not gonna use the L-Word. Likes? Yeah… well, more than “like” though. Adores? Hm. Sherlock's deep voice is perfect and that's what it is. Also, John's attention is drawn to his lips and those are perfect as well. What would ensue now is some waxing about the cupid bow and the shape of the lower lip as well, but Sherlock has in fact more asked than said John's name so he looks to the (perfect) eyes again.
, it's six thirty and he can call it a day. John hurries to take off his white coat and change into jeans and a casual shirt, but then he has to wait. Mary has agreed to picking him up right in the hospital at a certain place so he's standing there and trying to look busy with his smartphone. People walk past him, a hospital bed is shoved into an empty room right by his side and the door remains open because of a nurse running in and out. John didn't pay attention but in the from the corner of his eye he saw a mop of unruly dark curls that reminded him of someone. He forces himself not to look (because he's
"I need you to look at the photo, Sherlock."
“Stabbed from the front, twice from what I can see. She was stabbed below her right breast first, here.” He brings their joined hands over the wound and holds them a few inches above the body. “Most likely nicked the lung. Second injury was fatal, right through the heart over here.” He moves their hands over the second stab wound. “From the amount of blood on her coat and the defensive wounds on her hands, I’d say she put up a fight between each stab, she definitely tried to fight him off, probably couldn’t run due to her injuries. If you want my opinion, I think she’s a sad lady who met a sad ending.” He sighs. “But that’s just my opinion, of course. Oh, we’d better get up, Greg’s here.”
owed you?”
Sherlock yawns as Mycroft helps him over to his bed, his body stiff from a lack of movement. He shuffles over and falls onto it awkwardly. “I never want to see Mummy and Father again.”
Hello everyone, I'm still alive (Incredible, I know) I've been ill as many of you know. So I want to say, thank you thank you thank you! for all your support. I hope this chapter is true to the story you have all loved. And I hope there is someone out there who still wants to read this! I love you all!
"Don't you have a medic? Your plan was to capture me, was it?"
"Yes!" screeches Jack. "I will fight you mister government!" He waves his sword around.
John wakes up shrieking and runs for the shower. That’s plan A down the toilet.
He reaches out and touches Sherlock's face, the skin having aged remarkably well in spite of years of imprisonment. As his gaze wanders over his peaceful features, Mycroft clears his throat to interrupt him. The look he's giving him sends shivers down his spine.
“Careful! He’s been through enough already, take it easy! Sherlock, it’s okay, we’ll be as gentle as possible, just squeeze my hand when it gets too much, yeah? How bad are his injuries?”
“We call it the science of Deduction. I wrote a paper about it at school.” Sherlock sighs. “That was a long time ago now.”
Sherlock is now sat on the floor, his face buried in John's jumper. It's soft and smells of safety and pirates and tea. He buries his face deeper.
“No, Jack, for real, in a real house with a garden and I went to a real school with real people. The people on TV are real, Jack, they’re being filmed, that’s why we can see them, that’s why everyone can see them.”
Jack runs into his Pa's arms crying and John knows they've still got a long way to go. They've made good progress though.
There's an awkward pause. John blinks. Mrs. Hudson beams. “And you must be Jack!” she exclaims, peering behind Sherlock.
He leads Sherlock to the foot of the bed and cups his face with both hands. Sherlock’s eyes are on the floor. John wishes Sherlock could see him. He wishes he could give him the ability to see him.
“Do you want sex?”
Sherlock huffs crossly. “Of course, the North pole
The taller man turns around and reaches out like a blind man. "John?"
“No,” says the Witch. “I don’t want to see his face, don’t do that.”
Jack stares in wonder at the cake; his first birthday cake! Then disappointment grips him. “Where are the candles and lights?” he asks.
His heart sinks and Jack cries all the way to the hospital.
Shaking his head, John smiled. Perhaps he could live with this madman. He still needed to be sure though.
"See something you like, John?" baring his teeth in a nightmare of a grin. Mycroft's head snaps toward John and he
Sherlock’s phone buzzes. It’s Lestrade. John hates
“I’m not saying you said it directly, but by saying that he needs to earn respect, he may have believed that you meant that he doesn’t already. People hear unintended messages sometimes. Especially if they’re already feeling vulnerable.”
"I wonder," he says loudly, a small glance confirming that Jack is still spying on him, "I wonder if I can find something to eat? My poor stomach!" He makes a show of grabbing it.
Sherlock overhears Mycroft and John’s conversation in the kitchen. His brother’s statement that he is unable to make good choices hurt. But his threats of locking him in Baker Street just to keep him safe frightened him even more. Did Mycroft truly believe that he wouldn’t be hurting him just because he wasn’t physically abusing him? Sherlock was afraid of his brother for the first time since the rescue.
Sherlock turns green again and glares in the direction of Lestrade's voice. "How in the world..."
John smiles. “I understand. We’ll take this one step at a time.” Hand in hand, they make their way to Sherlock’s bedroom. Once inside, John’s heart starts pounding and he feels as nervous as Sherlock appears. He’s beginning to wish he’s googled this beforehand. What would he have typed? ‘Gay sex with blind man’? That would make an interesting Wikipedia page. He’s create an account tomorrow. Right now however…
The small boy stares at his panda. “Thank you.” he whispers, before burying his face in his Pa's chest. Sherlock kisses the top of his head and wraps the scarf around his own neck. “ I love it, Mrs. Hudson,” he smiles. “Now I just need a good coat to go with it.”
For the first time since his brother went missing, he covers his face with his hands and weeps.
But now I'm back suckers!!!! Thank you for all your support, and thankd to those who discovered it during my Hiatus!!! I WILL FINISH THIS!!!!!!!! I WILL MAKE YOU PROUD.
The next hour passes to fast for Jack’s liking. He isn’t sick anymore, but he doesn’t feel well and the temperature in Room is only just starting to feel normal again. He watches Strip Light as it flickers like a pulse. He wonders if the World has a Strip Light too, to stop the dark. He clutches Pa’s tooth in his hand. If he has to leave Room, then he’ll just have to take a piece of Pa with him. But he’s scared of Them. He doesn’t want to go anywhere with Them, not without his Pa for safety.
Mycroft's phone rings.
John doesn’t know what to say to that.
The rest of the car ride is silent except for Anthea's furious tapping.
John was safe. It helped that he was smaller.
Mike beat him to it. “This is John Watson, we...”
Sherlock is panicking. Jack’s thrown up three times and the last time there was nothing left to throw up. The only good news is that they have all power and water back. Room is warming up again, but too slowly and Jack has a temperature. They’ve been sharing body heat, clothes and blankets. But Sherlock is worried out of his mind. They have no medicine. He can’t make this better. But he does have a plan. A plan to save Jack.
We stare at each other for a long time. Then he picks me up and carries me back to the armchair and sits me between his legs, because I’m small enough. He places his laptop on both our legs and shows me some photographs.
Sherlock moves out of Jack’s sight and They follow him. Jack lies back down with a huff and counts sheep to fall asleep. When he opens his eyes again, he’s in Bed and Pa has a new bruise on his right arm. Jack doesn’t know how it happens. It just does.
I AM STILL ALIVE!!! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT WITH THIS STORY; IT'S A PLEASURE TO WRITE IT.
Sherlock’s heart misses a beat. He can tell they’re planning something, but he doesn’t know what. He attempts to squash down the rising panic. “Jack is smart. He’s curious and inquisitive.” His voice shakes. “He’s also a little boy who would like a present.”
The silence in 221B was deafening. Sherlock sat on the floor shaking, waiting for someone to tell him he was a failiure, that he didn't deserve Jack...
They glare at each other, breathing harshly, aware of the silence around them. “I don’t like your story,” whines Jack, “Tell me another one.”
“Well after that, I wanted to be a detective. But not an ordinary detective, no, I wanted to be a consulting detective, the first one in the world. The only one in the world. I was going to invent the job. But to start, I had to solve a case. My first one didn’t go as well as planned. A boy drowned in a swimming pool, which is like a bath but bigger, but his shoes were missing. I talked with the police, but no one listened to me,” his expression was faraway and wistful. “I never did get to solve it. I imagine it’s still a cold case. But anyway, I didn’t give up my dream. I started putting out ads, talking to people, trying to get someone to notice me, to let me solve their problems. And one day, a woman contacted me from America. She’d heard about me through her sister and she needed my help. She wanted me to prove that her husband was guilty of the crime he was on trial for. He was abusive and she wanted him to be executed, to get him out of her life.” Again, his smile was wistful. “Mrs. Hudson was a lovely lady. It took me two months, but eventually I found the evidence necessary and long story short, Mr. Hudson received the death sentence. And I was in the newspaper and all other media for my exploits. I’d proven everyone wrong, especially my family. I could do it.”
"Mycroft, get out! Jack needs you! Anthea, call an ambul-"
“I’m afraid Jack isn’t available this evening. Or any other evening for that matter.” His heart pounds in his chest.
They’re both so warm.
John pets his hair. "It's okay, once Greg is over the high of his testosterone, I'm sure he'll be really embarrassed about the whole thing and this incident will never be mentioned again. But now you'll never to break into your brother's home or office again, I suppose, hey?
The grey haired man tips his head back whimpering and John stares at the lax and aroused face of one DI Lestrade.
John tries to gather himself, blushing and avoiding eye contact. “If you really want to thank me, you can just keep working hard at getting better. That’s all. Just keep getting better for your own sake.”
He's still in his pyjamas; they all are. Grabbing the hem of his T-Shirt, he braces himself and pulls it off.
They’ve taken William. He waits on his knees in front of the door, waits for Them to bring him back. When They return, his son is not with Them.
in John's humble opinion: "Come on, Myc, four days of this and I'm still not feeling the wild times you promised me."
When all seems hopeless, a ray of light enters.
"Err..." says John, glancing at Sherlock who's starting to grin.
The man shuffles uncomfortably. Prince Charles coughs quietly.
“Details, John. Give me details.”
Mycroft can't stop it. He moves to the bin and throws up, all his hatred and misery trying to leave with it. A small hand rubs his back as his mother tries to comfort him. He wonders why Anthea would have told them to come. Perhaps she knew that visual proof of the ordeal would snap his parents out of their denial.
It takes John less than a second to follow him and to gape in absolute
, I need to know you’re okay… I had… I had to resta- I had to restart… restart your heart. I had to perform CPR and you were
The cab pulls up outside a beautiful expensive manor. John gapes as he admires the structure.
When he was growing up, he never thought of himself as capable of being a father. He had been raised in a cold and distant family. Mycroft had always said the family motto was ‘Caring is a disadvantage’. Their parents had loved them in their own strange way, but Sherlock had always known that he simply wasn’t equipped to settle down with a wife, child and dog. He’d been too smart, too interested in his experiments and what he’d called the Science of Deduction to care about that. But then he’d been locked in Room and Jack had been born. Sherlock can only hope that he’s done right by Jack. Would his parents be proud?
“And what do you suggest?” he asks eventually.
From the corner of his eye, he can see Stamford lean forward. "But I know now that there's nothing for me to understand. I will never know why she did any of this and what his involvement was, but They enjoyed it and I know that what happened wasn't right and it wasn't my fault."
Let me know what you think!
Three cuts later, he drops the blade and allows himself to float. His eyes start to droop. Good. Good.
Uncle Mycroft stares down at me even harder. I know he’s in his Mind Palace. He doesn’t disagree with my idea. John knows this too, without even seeing him. “I CAN HEAR YOU THINKING MYCROFT HOLMES! DON’T YOU DARE!”
“No Jack, Gregory is… he has a very difficult job. Very trying, and even when he catches the Monsters, that doesn’t always mean he can feel like he has won. And now that his job has become a part of his life…” He takes a deep, loud breath. “He simply needs some time to process. He doesn’t want to view us as… work.” He continues to make his keyboard click.
He wipes his face with a tea towel and throws it into the wash basket for later. “Well, let’s just say that you implied, quite unintentionally, that Mycroft isn’t respected.”
She can’t finish her sentence as Sherlock runs to her and wraps Chain around her neck and
“I’m not too sure what that means exactly, but yes, according to Jack, I’m the Somebody. So what does it mean?”
"Do you recognize the man you were holding at gunpoint, doctor Watson?"
"I have an idea actually. Headphones. Spend some time today working out what music Jack likes and put it on your or Sherlock's phone. Two hours playlist max should do, just so he can lay on the couch but be unawares of what is said. Probably even better if Sherlock has his back to him. Whilst the investigation is still ongoing, it'll be better for everyone if we make this as easy as possible for them." He rubs his face with both hands. There's a tiredness that weighs on him and John regrets not having asked before.
“Thank you, William. I love you.”
Sherlock scoops him up into a hug, a smile plastered onto his face. They make a deal: Sherlock will tell only the truth and Jack will believe him. He tells Jack of Mycroft, Redbeard and his life before Room and Chain.
He blinks. I’ve surprised him again. I can tell he wants to lie, so I put on my Attitude Face that John finds a bit scary. He smiles. “Just some difficulty with work. You don’t need to worry. I have everything under control.”
“No, Jack, it’s only us. We’re not supposed to be here,” he swallows and looks Jack in the eye, “We’re prisoners, Jack. We’re being controlled. It’s Them that make the rules, but They’re not allowed to. If I hadn’t been kidnapped, neither of us would be here.”
His heart plummets to his stomach. “Oh,” he breathes. “You didn’t look for me.”
“I’m tired, John. I need to go.”
John re-ran the conversation through his head. “So when you said that you understood the killer had taken her suitcase, was that your way of thanking me?”
“Say please.”
“No peeking,” promises Jack and covers his face with his hands.
“Yes. It’s Jack’s birthday.”
Jack doesn't understand what that means exactly. Maybe his Pa was trapped for too long to belong in the real world now. It's a good thing he will always be there for his Pa. He hugs his leg and looks up at John as he approaches them smiling.
His eyes droop shut. He reaches out blindly and finds John’s hand. “Thank you. You can’t possibly imagine what you’ve done.”
“Very well, I’ll have the nurse bring you some clothes. Oh, and there’s a man outside, friend of mine, can’t get him to leave, John Watson, you probably remember him from last night. Jack responded well to him, can he come in and say hello?”
His parents take a slightly longer look at the screaming and scrambling pair before they step back. Then the digger roars to life and scoops up mud and soil. The screaming and pleading get louder. Mycroft stares down at them, the lights from the machines shining down on him, making him appear larger than life in the artificial light. Mary Morstan screams up at him, her eyes mad. They're nothing like Jack's.
“That’s right. I tried to leave Room because you weren’t here yet and I was lonely and sad. I was-“ he pauses as he gives his answer more thought. “I was jealous because Old Magnussen and the Witch could leave Room together and I… I wanted company. Sometimes I got very angry at Them and I tried to fight Them. Even with Chain I would fight Them. So one day, to help me, after you were born, they gave me tablets that I still have to take.”
He reaches out to Sherlock who flinches away from him back towards John. Sherlock is too tired to deduce anyone’s intentions, but Jack trusts John. Therefore, he can trust John too. They make their way slowly to the lift, ignoring everyone’s stares and whispers, the other patients and visitors pointing at TV screens and muttering excitedly. Soon they are standing in a private room, but Sherlock can’t see very well. He blinks against the onslaught of light that appears to bother no one else. He’s vaguely aware of John talking and some of the lights are turned off. He looks around. The room is large, or at least, larger than what he’s used to and he sees two beds side by side set up near to the bathroom. He’s guided over to the beds and someone tells him to put down Jack. Put down Jack? When hell freezes over.
“It’s ugly. It has to go.”
“Take you vitamin, it’s the last one,” says Sherlock, tipping it out into his hand and holding it out to Jack, who takes it happily.
I want to have a hard think and I don’t know what ‘criteria’ is, but I didn’t come here to talk about this, so I stash it in my Mind Palace on the shelf next to the information about Pa and John. “Do I look like a girl?”
When he looks back at Pa, Sherlock is sat down on the edge of Bed, his eyelids drooping, even more tired than he usually is at this time of day.
“You breathe heavily through your nose when you're happy. It's incredibly irritating.”
“I have an uncle?” asks Jack, enthusiastically.
She hands him an envelope, the word 'copy' on the front and he sighs. She leaves before he can stop her.
Lestrade shifts to regain his attention. "Was it the same every time?"
"Ours. But you're going to need to watch Sherlock 24/7. This is going to be unpleasant."
Suddenly aware that his leg is shouting abuse at him, he stumbles abruptly and the person behind collides with him. He watches in mild fascination as the world spins and he wonders if he can keep that bee buzzing along over there…
"I promise."
Sherlock snorts an amused laugh. He really wants to see that. “You’re forgetting Lestrade.”
He sighs. Blood is seeping into his mouth and he doesn’t have a free hand, so he licks it off. “Do we have to do this?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just like my vitamins. Except you swallow yours with water.”
"John?" calls the tall one again, reaching out further.
A long, sleek black tank pulls up and it's the weirdest thing John has ever seen. However he lowers his gun.
Sherlock nods, stunned into silence. Jack is growing too fast. "Mycroft gave that to me."
“Right, I’ll call him in.” He turns and walks over to the door. He murmurs something to someone outside and steps back as John walks in, a nervous smile on his face. “Hello, um, you probably don’t really want me here, but I just wanted to make sure you were both okay before I headed home.”
"What are you going to do?"
I nod, because I feel too sick to speak. I close my eyes tight shut and hope that she’s right. Then she tugs my hair and there’s a loud SNIP SNIP SNIP! And suddenly I feel something’s missing. Then she pushes something hairy into my hand and I look. My ponytail! I reach back to check and it’s definitely not on my head anymore. She tells me to sit still and she finishes. I keep my eyes open now. I wish I could see but the mirror is too high. She gets my cut hair everywhere and I laugh because it’s all wet and tickly. She rubs it dry and brushes it for me. Then she gets a small mirror and holds it up.
They all fall silent as Jack’s arm flops out from under the last layer of Rug. Old Magnussen and the Witch seem surprised by this sudden turn of events. Old Magnussen searches for a pulse in Jack’s wrist.
“Sherlock, I was saying that there is someone here to see you.”
John gets mad. “SON OF A -!” Uncle Mycroft quickly covers my ears. Although I’m curious, I don’t want to accidently end up on the naughty step again. It’s the dullest thing in the World, more than boring TV. John marches in like a real soldier and stops yelling. He talks very quietly so I can’t hear with my ears covered. I know that quiet people are sometimes scarier than the loud ones. The Monsters were very quiet. I hug uncle Mycroft’s leg tighter and hide my face until the hands let my ears go.
"We're fine, Mrs. Hudson." John eyes her weapon of choice wearily. "I was playing with Jack and I injured myself. It's not a problem. But thank you for, uh, rescuing us."
John nudges Sherlock backwards until the back of his knees hit the mattress and he collapses onto it, dragging John down with him. They’re both lost for breath and then they’re giggling like they do ever so inappropriately at crime scenes. Sherlock’s face is flushed, his lips are damp and stained red and John feels unmanly tears threatening to spill. He gulps and locks lips with Sherlock.
Mycroft watches as Sherlock cries silently. He knows his brother only half grieved a long time ago. To his right, John stands there, a constant presence. Mycroft knows something must have happened, because the good doctor is stressed. Sherlock also seems hesitant around him.
John stares. "You're having me on."
Old Magnussen watches him and Sherlock knows he’s being deduced down to the last detail. He’s known for thirteen years. “Something’s bothering you.” Says the man, glancing at his companion, then back at Sherlock. “Care to share?”
Sherlock opens his eyes and looks at his brother. He'd been twenty-three when Sherlock had been taken. So young and inexperienced himself. The kidnapping changed him too. Behind Mycroft, Stamford stands and hurries to Jack's side. Footsteps leave heading towards their shared bedroom and Sherlock calms instantly. He takes a deep stuttering breath, anguish threatening to overwhelm him. Oh god.
Is he on fire? They’re both so hot, something must be on fire.
John grips his shoulder, giving him a reassuring smile. “Nothing to worry about. Besides, what are best friends for?”
John's grin turns feral. "I'm not wearing it today. I don't wear it on days I kill scum like you."
Jack snatches the book. "Thank you," he whispers and pushes his long hair away from his face and switches on the puppy eyes for Mycroft. "Will you read me the book? Please?"
He gets his breathing under control, managing to fight off an incoming panic attack and takes deep breaths. Sherlock is in pain, he’s the one who needs help. He has to be strong.
He sees John scoop up Jack and carry him to the car. Did Jack run to John? He must have done. Why would his son want a careless man, a bad decision maker for a father?
No, really, I love you all. This chapter was hard. Some angst is present.
Uncle Mycroft stretches his fingers out and curls them back in. “I’m handling it. You don’t need to worry.”
John has a flashback with disastrous conséquences. Part 1 of 2.
so much.”
Mycroft stares at the boy like the first time they met. Reaching out, he runs his fingers through the newly cut hair, never breaking eye contact. John can see the pride stretched undisguised across his face. “You look wonderful, Jack. As you have always.”
“PA! PA, I’M IN THIS ONE!”
Sherlock chokes back a sob and pulls Jack against him, giving Mycroft a watery smile, grateful for his approval. Doctor Stamford watches them quietly. Mycroft doesn’t attempt to touch Sherlock again, but watches Jack with a certain amount of emotion that Sherlock can’t recognize. He turns to Mike. “How are they, Doctor?”
“I'm real in the real world?”
“NEVER TOUCH THIS! DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU ARE HER CHILD! THOSE ARE HER EYES! You’re here because She wants leverage and for that reason alone, I will never want you!
The door shuts and They’re gone. The baby cries.
Sherlock’s voice is thick with emotion. “I know you will. Thank you.”
“We weren’t raised to be overly emotional,” he concurs, rubbing his bandaged wrists. “I don’t know how to ask for help. I hurt myself and you lash out at others. It’s what we were taught. We are Holmes’.”
"He needs me! Let me go with him! Please... Mycroft... Please..."
(See the end of the chapter for
Cold air blows around him, bright lights flash everywhere, all different colours and even in the dark he can see a swarm of people turn to face him. The crowd goes quiet and they stare at him and he stares back,
Doctors swarm towards them as they enter and Sherlock feels overwhelmed. Lestrade notices his discomfort and steps between them, trying to explain the situation. There’s a warm hand on Sherlock’s elbow. He looks at John, who gives him a small, reassuring smile.
Sherlock growled, infuriated. “Only if you want to stay. Which we'll find out in about an hour's time.”
“We can’t have a dog, there’s not enough room… I mean space, there’s not enough space in Room for a dog. And I can’t just ask for things, Jack, because They always want something in return.”
Sherlock winces and sits on the edge of the bed. “Jack, do you remember the story I told you about how I wanted to be a detective? This is the lady I was telling you about. This is Mrs. Hudson. Why don't you say hello?”
John hadn't realised how much noise there had been up until the point where he'd drawn his gun. Now, the silence is a loud reminder of how much danger he is now in. Breathe.
"Yes. The day she was born."
“Shut up. I want to see you.”
“You're a doctor.” he said, adjusting his scarf around his neck. “An army doctor.”
Jack picks that moment to run into the kitchen, wearing an old pirate hat from Sherlock's childhood. It slips down past his eyes and it takes Sherlock a moment to realize that this is the one Mycroft gave him when Redbeard died. His son must have uncovered it in one of the boxes Mycroft and his goons had brought round when they first moved in.
Sherlock, John and Lestrade stare in bemusment as a small five year old, armed with tin foil attacks a middle aged man armed with an umbrella. Sherlock reaches for his phone and manages to snap a photo. He can tell Mycroft is going easy on Jack due to his superior weapon. Well.
Lestrade rubs his back and keeps walking towards the exit, and out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock can see that the detective is shedding tears of his own. Sherlock can’t deduce why. He just focuses on putting one foot in front of the other so as not to be carried out. After what feels like an eternity, they go up a flight of stairs, through a living room and they’re facing the front glass doors.
“But if he’s a bad guy, he might know how good guys think, and that’s how he always escapes. Maybe you need to try something different. If he’s expecting you and what you always do, then he’ll know how to ignore you.”
“Pa?”
“Sherlock Holmes. We've already established that I know everything about you. And you will follow me. You can't help yourself.” He left the room with grace and ease.
In Room, boys always seemed to have short hair on TV. But back then I didn’t know they were real. Then I escaped in the truck and I ran to John, our Somebody, and deduced him. I remember he asked the Monsters if I was their daughter. He told Old Magnussen to put “her” down. He was surprised when I told him my name. John had thought I was a girl too, because he hadn’t observed. Pa would say that John’s an imbecile for not seeing, but uncle Mycroft just said that even big bad guys would get confused. Did I not look like other boys? But uncle Mycroft said it was “uncommon”, not impossible. John read me my dictionary, and it said they are two different words.
Sherlock thinks he must be flying. Jack’s laugh is infectious and they’re giggling like they’re both five year olds. Everything seems to be getting brighter and brighter. Sherlock snatches his son up into the air and spins him around. As the end approaches, they waltz towards eternity.
Sherlock? SHERLOCK? Oh
Said child is small enough to stand at full height under the table and is now on tiptoe trying to peek over the top of it. John smiles. "Hello there! I found a yummy breakfast to eat! Would you like to share it with me?"
“I’ve put it in my Mind Palace, Pa.”
Sherlock glances at John. "At lunch. John made sandwiches and I ate everything, drank my tea and he watched me take them. I didn't feel so bad about eating today."
He half runs, half falls down the flight of steps until his bare feet are on soft and well cut grass. He runs towards the nearest person, vaguely aware that he’s screaming
His whispering draws a chuckle from the other person, who ensnares him in a fierce hug and rolls onto his back. “You’re five! You’re so old now!”
John gets his phone and pauses. He hasn’t been able to speak to Sherlock since… his hands shake. Would Sherlock even want to speak to him? He knows he hurt him, even unintentionally. Sherlock had tried to take his own life because John hadn’t considered the impact of his words. Because he’d
No one moves, Jack still sobs loudly into John’s neck. Mycroft somehow ages ten years. He turns, picks up his umbrella with shaking hands and walks slowly to the door. Before leaving, he turns back to the pair who haven’t moved. His voice is no more than a whisper. “I’m so sorry, Jack.” Then he’s gone.
Lestrade grins. "You'd better."
John swallows and presses the phone closer to his face. “That’s okay. Just rest, alright? I’ll take care of Jack, I swear.”
"You already knew that, Mummy. You and father chose to ignore it. And you hurt Sherlock even more in the process. Now you know. I hope you're proud."
Sherlock drops a cereal packet onto the table. “Yes, I get it,” he grumbles. They take their usual chairs and sit down, Jack pulling up one of his legs and tucking it under his body. They face each other, as they always do, twenty-four hours every day.
Implied Non-con scene at the end, but it is merely mentionned, nothing graphic.
Mycroft reaches out and grips his knee; their eyes lock. “You cannot change what has happened. I wish I could change our parents. I wish I could take away all the horror you endured at the monsters’ hands. But I wouldn’t swap Jack for anything the world. Whilst I wish he had been born under happier circumstances, I wouldn’t want a world without him, or you. Or John. Even Mrs. Hudson, despite the fact that she has taken a liking to beating me with her handbag every time she sees me, since I punched John in the face.”
Next to him, Sherlock closes his eyes as if he admits to losing a battle against disbelief and covers his mouth and nose with both hands. His skin turns an unhealthy green tinge.
“In your memories, Jack. I’ll always be there for you in your Mind Palace.”
Uncle Mycroft turns slowly to face me. He looks sad, but he is also trying to hide how he feels. “No, Jack. Lestrade is taking a slight… vacation.”
"The medical examiner hasn't identified the gender yet... She died during infancy?"
“Doctor Watson, I have no intention of endangering my nephew. If you do not cause me bodily harm, I have no doubt Sherlock will. I’m simply considering the surprise element of Jack’s theory. Besides, using Jack to speak for me would only make me look like a fool.”
“What about Lestrade?”
“But, Pa, who are you worried about?” Jack ponders what his Pa has said and the expressions on his face and tries to deduce. He reaches a strange conclusion. “Why are you worried about me, Pa?” But Sherlock is already asleep.
John's laughter dies in his throat. "Wait. What?"
The door starts to beep.
"With this new evidence, there probably won't be a trial with a jury. It'll make the whole process less complicated for Sherlock and help us fend off the press."
Sherlock’s hands shake as he tries to coax Jack into looking at Mycroft. He needs Mycroft’s approval, to accept Jack as family, as a Holmes.
Smirking again and ignoring Sherlock's bemused face, they left the flat together. Sherlock needed him, and vice versa. He would start his blog tomorrow.
John is leaning over a coffee, black, no sugar, hospital brand and quite frankly disgusting. His elbows are resting on the table and he can't make eye contact with anyone in the room. Lestrade is taking notes. Mycroft is gripping his umbrella so tightly his knuckles are white. Only Sherlock is talking. Mike is watching him for any signs, but Sherlock is talking as fast as he can, blurting out words as fast as his brain and mouth will let him. He tells them everything from the beginning, the moment he first woke up aged just sixteen, naked and chained up, unable to move, with a gag in his mouth, his ears covered and blindfolded, only able to feel the hand and body of a woman who molested and raped him over and over again. How he was beaten every time he tried to speak. How for the first three months of his captivity, he was not allowed to talk, scream or make any vocal sounds at all. How he had deduced that she had lost a child as she would try to breast feed him when he behaved well. How he was forced to pleasure her, and she would rape him up to twenty times a day…
“But, Pa, I’m scared. I don’t want to be Half-Real.”
Lestrade lets out a shaky laugh. “Thanks a lot. Just don’t move, okay? You really don’t look too good. Just keep your eyes open and focused on me. Helps on the way.” He turns as footsteps approach them. “We’re gonna need the bolt cutters. Have you got them? Well done.”
It bothers him more than he expected it to.
Mycroft raises both eyebrows and turns to Anthea. She doesn't raise her eyes from her phone. Guilty as charged.
“I trained for years, John, years to perfect my hearing, all my senses and my knowledge of every route in London. I only started working with Lestrade two years ago. It's not always easy, because they're all a bunch of idiots. My blindness means that I miss a lot of important details, and when no one is willing to help me, then of course they never catch their killer . Bunch of morons the lot of them. Thank god you were there tonight, or I never would have realized that the killer had taken her suitcase. Has he replied yet?”
Jack rolls off Pa and drops to his knees to look under the bed. “Good morning, Eggsnake! Good morning, Bed! Good morning, Plant! Good morning, Sink!” He slowly makes his way around the room. “Good morning, Telly! Good morning, Rug! Good morning, Toilet!” He doesn’t notice the look of despair etched across his roommate’s face. “It’s my birthday!”
John walks to the bed, cataloging his friend's injuries. Ringing in ears, due to blow, causing temporary deafness. Punch to the throat damaged vocal cords, temorary inability to speak. John has just detroyed everything Sherlock loves about himself. A concussion the size of Mycroft's ego and stitches on his face are also things he will never be forgiven for.
He almost collapses to his knees with the effort and his hands are shaking so hard he’s having trouble choking her. He doesn’t hear the door open and is only aware of the older man’s presence as he takes a fist to the jaw. His head clips the edge of Table and he hits the floor hard. He stares at Jack’s School Box and Eggsnake. Desolation and horror flood him and grasp his heart. He’s never going to see his son again. He’s going to be nothing but a curiosity in Jack’s mind and one day Jack will stop thinking about him. He’s going to be nothing more than a question to which no one will know the answer. He’ll be a cold case and a distant memory.
I need more data.
He nods, not entirely satisfied. "Watch him, Dr. Watson."
He raises an eyebrow. “Yes?”
But why do They cut your hair, but not mine?”
“But I want a present. I’ve never had a present before, only the ones you make me. I want a dog, like Redbeard.”
“Sit down and close your eyes. No peeking.”
John couldn't answer.
“Sherlock, there is a little boy outside waiting for you. He’s very worried. I need you to…”
“Yes, we are. But you see, from now on, Bed is home and Table is school,” he takes Jack’s hand, “are you ready?”
"Err..." John wonders if he should purchase a thesaurus.
Uncle Mycroft packs his computer away. “Firstly, this man is a Monster, different from the Monsters you knew, but similar and I would never ask you to face such cruelty. Secondly, surprising him is good, but if I have a child speak for me, he will not respect me. Thirdly, even if that did work, he wouldn’t be convinced by you anyway, since he would wonder why I picked a girl for the job.”
“Well dear, a good father plays with you, takes care of you, teaches you, feeds you… and most importantly loves you. Your Pa ticks all the criteria.”
Mycroft tips his head back and stares at the ceiling. He remains silent for a moment. And then, “Ah, yes. I never thought I would… that I
The door closes behind Them. Sherlock leaps to his feet and bangs on it desperately, his right leg stretched out behind him as Chain refuses to let him get closer to the exit. Jack watches him silently. Sherlock eventually collapses onto the floor and buries his face in his hands. He’d been so sure. He’d been
A noise behind him makes him glance up just in time to see a small figure disappear. A very small head appears and John pretends not to notice.
Violet Holmes sighs. “We thought your disappearance had something to do with drugs. It was the easiest thing to tell everyone. It was the only thing that would get the police off our backs. It wasn’t very hard to convince them.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, Jack, you’re talking about yourself, remember? You say ‘My father and I have been locked in a vault in Appledore.’”
He grabs John by the armpits and with surprising strength, he hauls him back up so they’re face to face and tries to pull John’s jumper over his head. He tosses it to the floor and goes for his shirt which he simply rips open, buttons flying everywhere.
Sherlock spits in her face. “He was never your son. He’s mine, he’s always been mine,” he cries harder.
Jack insists on being next to the window so that he can see everything and ask questions about
The room goes awfully quiet. A high-pitched ringing makes itself known in his ears. Anthea stops typing and makes a quick call. "She sat on him and buried him alive?"
Time stops. Sherlock has stopped breathing and so has John. There’s nothing else except them. Sherlock swallows and turns his head slightly. “Angelo,” he calls, voice scratchy and startled, “bill please.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Somehow, he succeeds at making Mycroft soften slightly. "Very well. Pass me the book please."
John is still reeling and needs leverage. "He must like you a lot. No wonder he smiles so much around you. Hope that doesn't put
“I won’t say those words.” I tell him, because I know the Somebody sometimes says things that will get me into trouble. But now uncle Mycroft is having a hard think about what I said and looks at me like I’m super interesting.
“That would not work. I have tried to contact him, but I cannot get through to him. I know how to talk to bad people like him, and trust me, telling him off will not work.”
Until…
The Witch steps forward. “You let my son die?” she hisses.
“The dream you’re telling me now. I wish my dreams were as good as yours.”
"My brain." moans Sherlock. "My
"Anderson only found the camera in the vault... the room today, but Sherlock said the boy was taken away, so all I can tell you is that he also died from suffocation."
Sherlock can’t believe it; he knew, deep down he knew, but hearing it is… “Are you sure? Are you sure?”
“All your school books, toys, pirate outfit for Jack, journals, everything that was yours. Including what you asked for.” He holds out a large envelope.
John spies on the gorgeous git for the rest of the day. He becomes unnaturally jealous when Sherlock strokes the corpse of a victim like a lover when he’s trying to the determine the cause of death, while Molly relays everything she can see to him. All these feelings are very embarrassing and he’s certain Sherlock knows something is wrong, because Sherlock
Sherlock glares at Him with all the contempt and hate he can muster. The feeling is overwhelming. But he gives in. For Jack. Always for Jack.
“NO!” he shouts. “Do not touch that!”
For half an hour, Sherlock doesn’t move. The reality of his situation doesn’t set in until he hears Jack stir in Wardrobe. Panic grips him and he stumbles over to Bath, only too aware of the pain flaring up his backside. It takes colossal effort, but he eventually sinks into the tub, wincing as the hot water burns his injuries. He scrubs himself clean vigorously. He doesn’t cry. Jack will know if he’s cried. Once he’s rid the air of the foul smell and rearranged Bed, he picks up Jack and tucks him in without waking him. He lays there for hours, staring up at the Strip Light they can never switch off.
“Please take him away. I can’t bear it, just take him and bury him somewhere safe, please,” he sobs in despair. He cries, his limbs wrapped around the small form. Then gently this time, the Witch drags him away, while Old Magnussen picks up the rolled up Rug. He grunts as he lifts it.
Arriving at the hospital
It only takes a couple of minutes to calm down. Mycroft watches him sadly. Lestrade makes a show of putting his files and equipment away, giving him privacy. Stamford hasn't returned. Perhaps Jack woke up.
“Sherlock,” he announces, “We should probably have sex. For my own health and safety, if not for yours.”
“Appreciate what you have.” Mumbles Jack.
“I’m sorry” mumbles Sherlock.
He pauses to sip more water. Refusing to make eye contact with anyone, he dives back into the story.
“Please, you have to take him to a hospital. I can’t do anything for him here, I’m not a doctor. It could be serious, I-“
Let me know what you think!
Mycroft leaves the flat. He climbs into his limousine and sits back as they drive past the dwindling number of journalists. Once his car is clear and on its way to Bart's, he grabs his umbrella and stabs holes into the leather seats of the car, fury boiling his blood.
By now, he and Sherlock were inches apart and he swallowed at their sudden closeness. And then Sherlock's eyes met his own, taking his breath away, reading his secrets and taking a peek at his soul. The blue was intense and John was almost convinced Sherlock could see him.
There's a knock at the door startling the three of them. "Yoohoo! Boys! Your guests are here!"
“Yes it is, Jack, I promise you, everything is real. Where do you think Old Magnussen and the Witch go when They leave Room? They go back into their house. Room is a part of Their house, it’s a part of Appledore.”
“You have to, it’s the only way to get you out of here, it’s all I can do for you.”
, and drifts off to sleep.
“Your brother left his wife Clara, because he kept the phone before passing it onto you; you're not close, but he's worried, wants you to stay in touch. Scratches on the charging end, indicate he's an alcoholic. Never see a drunk's phone without them, and they most certainly didn't come from you.” His phone was thrust back into his hands. “An army doctor.” The unseeing eyes were confident. “I can only assume that I'm right.”
Sorry for the delay, been very busy my end. Enjoy!
Mycroft walks silently behind the desk to stand behind the members of New Scotland Yard. He stares quietly at the computer screen.
“Just like TV. Do you think you can help me?”
“Yes, I mean… uh, if I…eh…”
Mycroft’s hands pause in pulling the sheet over him. “And you won’t. But you should know that if you ever change your mind, they’ll be there for you and in spite of their many flaws, they do love you.”
They rip the cello tape off and pull apart the paper. Jack forgets about hiding and peers inside. He holds up a round fluffy toy.
Enjoy!
A small blur shoots across the space between them and Jack crawls up onto Mycroft's lap before the man can stop him. He hides his face against his uncle's expensive suit.
“No! Please don’t hang up. Please. I just… I need to hear your voice. I need to know you’re okay. After what happened… I haven’t slept, and I know all of this is my fault, and I know you hate me, but please don’t hang up,
“No!” He runs after me. “Get back here. This is beyond you or John. There is no need to get him involved.”
"He was born about a year after they took me. I told you they removed my chains after three months... That's because..." he stops, recalling her joy and his horror at the situation. "I kept telling myself it was all a lie, that it wasn't mine, but she wasn't lying. I delivered him. I didn't want to, but they made me read books and on the day Old Magnussen brought a knife in and said he'd think of something creative if I didn't cooperate. I was seventeen and I was scared so I did what I'd read in the books. I just held him and when she asked if it was a girl, she was relieved when I said no. Overjoyed even."
I help John wash up. I think about asking him, but I know he’ll just try to reassure me. I need to ask someone wise and honest. There’s only one person that fits. I go and get my encyclopaedia and go down all the stairs to Mrs. Hudson’s apartment.
There’s a pause where Jack worries his lip and cocks his head. “I don’t know if I’ll remember any of that. There’s too much data.”
Now he's started, he can't stop. He'll tell them everything and then he'll face their wrath and disappointment afterwards.
The silence becomes concerned. "You're our medic, John."
“I’m going to need to keep them here for a little while Mr. Holmes. I need time to assess them, especially Jack.”
“Doctor Watson says they are ready, sir. However…”
“Does old Magnussen cut you hair, Pa?”
"What about Pa?
As they enter the building, John glances around at the designs and decorations furnishing the home. "Is this a museum?" he asks before he can stop himself. Sherlock grunts.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack pulls on his ponytail. “But we’re supposed to be in Room because Room is real. You’re not making sense, Pa.”
"SHERLOCK! SHERLOCK? Please don't do this to me! PLEASE! SHERLOCK! JOHN! JOHN! I need-"
“I love you.” He says before he can stop himself. “I
Sherlock’s gaze is like ice. “Nothing happened to Jack, there’s nothing wrong with him.”
His eyes land on the photo in Lestrade's outstretched hand. A small patch of grass with flowers on top.
Old Magnussen steps forward and shoves him roughly aside. Sherlock watches with wide eyes as They unroll Rug. “Please,” he whispers, “please don’t make me look at the body. I don’t want to remember him like that, you’re not allowed to touch him…”
“Do I have a mother? Did your parents live in Room too?”
The doctor recovers quickly. “So could you and Lestrade. Didn’t know you had penguin contacts in Antarctica. How is Mrs. Lestrade?”
yes.”
Mycroft, for the first time in his life, doesn't understand.
There's a long silence, that's no longer glacial but pitying. "I'm so sorry, John."
It's early morning when John wakes up with a gasp, the taste of Afghanistan and death in his tongue. He hasn't dreamt about that for a month and he had hoped, very stupidly, that the dreams wouldn't come back. He spends ten minutes hugging his knees, trying not to cry before he pulls back the covers and creeps down the stairs. A quick trip to the bathroom mirror confirms his suspicions that yes, he does indeed look like crap. Splashing his face with water, he hears someone knocking at the door and freezes, wondering who it could be. Mrs. Husdon answers and John feels guilty for letting her face the media and possible danger alone. But with the amount of security Mycroft has at his disposition, it's very unlikely.
“Exactly.” Pa strokes Jack’s hair. “Come on now, I’ll cut you a slice.”
Together they lay side by side, until Sherlock timidly wraps his hand around their penises. John’s hand joins his and together, they finish off what they started. They come at the same time, John with his eyes wide open, watching Sherlock as Sherlock observes John’s features with the pads of his fingers.
"Okay, roll him onto the stretcher in three, two,-"
When the time comes, Sherlock has him dressed in his warmest jumper and socks, his best trousers and T-shirt. He tucks him in Bed and comforts him, reassuring him. Sherlock tries not to think their plan through. They’ve had no time to prepare what Jack will tell the police or the possibilities of what Old Magnussen and the Witch will do to stop him. But there is no other way. Getting Jack to a hospital could save him from further illness and both of them from captivity, if they’re lucky. But only if the police stop
A lone eyebrow crawls up his forehead. “Your point, if you please?”
“It would appear he has a fever. What happened?”
As he speaks, the slur starts to fade, as if the thought of having something to do is giving him drive. John knows how important that is. These Holmes boys are his motivation to live. “He sits in the chair, doesn’t answer when spoken to. Seems sad, almost depressed… erm, said a criminal was giving him grief. Misses Greg.”
“What about you, Pa?”
"I know Charles Magnussen, son, and so do you. Even if you jail him, he'll never stop. He's the most perverted bastard out there. We can't let him haunt Sherlock for the rest of his life."
Sherlock stiffens like he’s been electrocuted and John’s angry all over again. He rounds on Donovan like an angry bull, but is stopped by Sherlock gripping his hand tighter.
“It’s the only way to get you help, Jack. It could be serious and I can’t do anything for you.”
He feels like he's just taken his heart out if his chest and shown all of its ugliness to John. He knows the other man has had a rough time, but John can still go out in public, get a job and make friends. His wound hurt, but it was physical. A month after his rescue, Sherlock feels like he's hanging onto the edge by his fingernails. It's terrifying. He's already in the deepest, blackest hole, but there's still an edge. If he goes over... He can't think about it. He has to think about Jack...
His has his back turned to Sherlock, and doesn’t see how the other man trembles. “If I were to go outside, all by myself, do you think I would cope?”
"It's the Queen." replies John. The man he's no longer threatening looks relieved. John honest to God hopes the Queen throws her crown at him for his insolence.
Strong language for Mystrade people. Ye be warned!
She gasps and approaches him, straightening his clothes and inspecting his fading bruises. “Oh my poor boy, what did they do to you?” She pats his cheek. “When you went missing, I moved back to britain, because I wanted to thank you in person and I didn't find out until I met your parents. But now you've been found safe and sound and I can hopefully return the favour. I hear you have a little boy with you?”
Sherlock woke feeling like he'd been punched in the stomach. Gasping for breath, he tenses as the footsteps approach. Someone kneels opposite him but makes no attempt to touch him.
(See the end of the chapter for
at the scene in front of him.
I wake up from my sleep and push my hair away from my face. I’m in John’s bed. I remember I came to find him in the night because I was lonely and scared. I’m not used to sleeping all by myself. John said I must learn, but I’m scared. I’m not used to the dark. Dark means Monsters are punishing us. Uncle Mycroft had bought me a night light, but I’m not used to being alone either. John is sleeping on the floor. He says he mustn’t share a bed with me because he’s not my Pa. He says he could get into trouble. But I just want cuddles. And more than anything, I want Pa. Pa was always there in Room.
“Of course not. I wouldn’t do it otherwise. I’ll start by cutting your ponytail off, and then I’ll trim up the rest to make it look neat. Not too short, perhaps a little longer than what your Pa has now. Ready?”
Now it's John's turn to stare. “Are you serious? Oh my god, those things are so rare!”
Jack mulls over this new information, processing it and putting it on a shelf in his Mind Palace. “But you don’t need to fight anymore, Pa, because you’ve got me. That way you won’t have to take bad tablets anymore.”
"Doctor Watson, should you harm that man, I can assure you that the consequences you will suffer shall be
Sherlock rubs his face in frustration. “No, Jack. The people we deduce on TV, they’re real. Room is inside Appledore. Room isn’t just a room, Jack. Room is a vault. We’re being locked and kept in a vault. That’s why only They can open the door.”
They head back to the lounge where Mycroft sits as still as a snake ready to strike. Jack glares at his storybook like it's somehow offended him.
Sherlock’s sure it’s a ruse. He calls the boy Jack, because it’s the most boring and common name he can think of, yet somehow he believes Jack might be able to defeat the giants. Sometimes she will make threats about using Jack if he doesn’t obey her, but she never actually carries them out.
Sherlock lets out a breath as he takes in the aged faces of his parents. Mycroft stands to the side watching them all. Time seems to have frozen as their mother steps towards Sherlock and reaches out to touch his face. He holds still, his expression unreadable behind the sunglasses as she skims her fingers over the bruises on his jaw. The silence is deafening and he can’t breathe. They only have eyes for each other. Tears well up in her eyes as she takes in his appearance. Her hand runs over his short hair and she swallows to contain her emotion. Sigar Holmes steps forward and places a supportive hand on his wife’s shoulder.
"...talk to me! Sherlock, can you tell me where you are?"
Although Sherlock has decided he will not form a bond with this child, will not allow it to call him Dada, for that was William and only William, he still must provide basic needs. Hygiene, nutrition, clothing. What They bring he gives the child, knowing that if he doesn’t She will beat him. When he has finished giving it basic necessities, he puts in the wardrobe where it can cry to its hearts content.
“Want to see some more?”
He holds out his hand, before curling it into a fist and leaving his pinky out. John doesn't give him time to feel stupid and locks his own pinky around Sherlock's. They look at each other and start giggling, breaking the weighted tension that had settled.
Mycroft straightens, his entire posture screaming outrage at John’s low blow. “Careful where you tread, Doctor Watson. Like you said, any doctor could do your job.”
Sherlock raises his head. Except it’s not Sherlock, but Mycroft.
“Hm hm,” nods Jack.
A pause.
“That’s right. Now, we need to prepare what you’re going to say.”
“Take off your clothes.” Says the Witch.
Jack had never expressed the desire to have his hair cut before. For him to do this
“You're wonderful to Jack and that's what people do isn't it? Have sex when they owe you something? You've been so kind, it's only logical… ”
Three heads whip around to face the source of this question. Wardrobe’s door is open and Jack is standing outside, facing the three of them. He rubs the sleep out of his eyes and stares at the three adults curiously, uncomprehendingly. “Pa?”
John pulled him with him until they were in the middle of the living room, and then he pulled Sherlock close to him, putting his hand at the small of his back while he continued to hold his hand with the other hand. Sherlock mimicked John’s movements and put his hand firmly at Johns back.
They had both been feeling it for awhile now. That sense of awakening. That feeling of everything finally coming together for them. They gravitated towards each other with a force that grew stronger by the minute. It felt as inevitable as the sun giving way to the moon each night. They were meant to be together and that was all that mattered. Everything else felt insignificant by comparison. Neither of them had initially thought that this was in the cards for them. Sherlock had never valued romantic entanglement and had always thought his life would be better without it. John had never before been attracted to a man. It had only ever been women that had caught his attention, and it had always been more of a distraction and for fun than it had been about finding someone to spend his life with. But this was all before. Before the world had screeched to a halt and turned itself upside down. Before they had met each other.
At this part of the song, their eyes found each other and they each got lost in the others’ adoring gaze while dancing slowly to the rhythm of the song. John’s hand slowly moved from Sherlock’s back to his neck, his thumb caressing Sherlock’s cheekbone. Sherlock’s breath hitched at his touch and he lowered his head until his forehead rested on John’s. John could feel Sherlock’s hand caressing his back and got goose bumps on his arms. He felt drawn to Sherlock’s mouth like a moth to a flame and he lowered his hand slightly, so he could run his thumb over Sherlock’s lips. Those beautiful full lips that he had longed to feel the touch of for so long. Sherlock parted his lips ever so slightly and let out a sigh that went straight to John’s stomach and made it do a cartwheel.
John took the lead and started to move slowly just as the singing started. He hoped Sherlock would listen to the lyrics and understand why John had chosen to dance to this song.
'No need to rub it in, John,' Sherlock interrupts him and looks away. He sighs.
'Wasn't there any list?' Mycroft interrupts him suddenly, though without turning. He just keeps staring at Sherlock. 'There should have been a list.'
'Boring.'
The door falls shut behind them and John grins at Sherlock. He takes off his socks quickly, then Sherlock backs him up against the door. 'I believe you wanted to take it slow,' Sherlock says in his deep baritone. God, it's hot. 'Take me apart, get to know my body.'
'New to what?' Sherlock asks, frowning.
John nods again. 'He wanted to go to his flat to get himself proof and clearing.'
'Why?' John asked, frowning.
'No, seriously,' he interrupts her. 'I've finished for today, I'm on my way home.'
'John…' Sherlock pushes his hips up, one of his hands on John's arse.
Sherlock chuckles. 'Nah, I don't think so. He's going to be annoyed like usual.' He glances around the room, eyes lingering on the walking cane leaned against the table. 'He's got the recording of Smith's confession, right?'
'No wallet or phone. He's been unresponsive since we fetched him at St Paul's. Civilian called,' the paramedic says and looks at John. 'Can you take over?'
Even Lestrade is getting pissed off. 'I hate Anderson!' he rants, entering Sherlock's new room where he finds John. 'And Donovan, too!'
'It. I… I meant the sex,' John forces himself to say. He feels guilty and stupid. 'But I…' Is he in love? Already?
'At least I'm not a
And there, John could have sworn the corners of Mycroft's mouth curl into a smile, barely noticeable, but it's the first time that John sees something like affection in his face. 'Oh right, the tattoo murder. We should tell the police, shouldn't we?'
'Goodnight, Sherlock.'
'You're a lunatic,' he said but it's gentle teasing.
'I thought you're gay,' he mutters and lies down again, turning on his front. 'Turn it off, I want to sleep.'
John winces. 'Jeanette, please…'
At this moment, John loses all hesitancy and nervousness. It has been pretty predictable so far, yes. He feels more relaxed now though. They're going to get somewhere tonight, kissing or further and it will be fine.
'I'm sincerely sorry,' he says quietly.
'I discovered I didn't like not knowing things about you.'
'Jesus,' John mutters, slightly embarrassed now. 'I didn't mean to be a desperate teenager.'
Sherlock grumbles to himself. 'John Clive Watson.
'Don't order me around.'
It's enough to draw a soft moan out of Sherlock's throat.
John remembers that Sherlock can't hear him because of the coma. Well, most likely can't hear him. 'Because I had a row in the shop with the chip and PIN machine,' he admits.
Now that was almost flirting, wasn't it? John slowly pushes the chair forward. When they reach the door, Sherlock leans forward to open it.
Soon after, Sherlock is put in a wheelchair, now wearing a coat and a scarf. It was John's idea to gel back his hair and Sherlock suggests glasses and a small fake moustache. He says something about John not having recognised him like that the last time and while he gets that it's a joke he doesn't understand it at all. He doesn't agree to steal glasses, hair product and eyeliner either. Well, he borrows it instead.
'Not a problem, John,' he says smoothly, grinning.
Mary chuckles.
'Yes, I know,' he says with a roll. 'Anyway. Do you have any more interrogation questions?'
'A whole weekend! It's not even Christmas!' he rants during a phone call on Saturday. 'Mycroft obviously approves of me leaving the city for a few days. Idiot. I'm going to tell Mummy he's fucked up the South Korean government last week!'
John looks at the bloody tissues before raising an eyebrow at Sherlock.
'Sorry that took so long.'
Today, when he's seen Sherlock there was no doubt John was attracted to him. Their banter was as easy as four months ago as well. Sherlock is a very strange man, but John finds himself being drawn to him.
'But… Mary's alive,' John says confusedly, blinking. Is this brain damage speaking?
John raises an eyebrow and holds the glass away from him, even though he knows he's being childish and totally not professional. What is wrong with him?
'Someone under the influence of the drug broke into the Tower of London in an attempt to steal the crown jewels,' John tells Sherlock on a rainy day in February. 'The guy danced, and then actually managed to break the glass with a diamond and a fire extinguisher, Mycroft said. When police arrived he just said there and told them 'not to rush'. They call it the Royal Drug now. It's special, I don't know how exactly, but it opens you up in new ways or whatever. As if your brain is a world full of locked doors…'
