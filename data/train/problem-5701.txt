"Why, hello to you too, Pep. Great hearing from you."
He cradled his head in his hands, finding solace in the darkness. He had known Steve would leave eventually, but he had thought he still had time! They’d wake up and Steve would be back to his normal mindset, but at least Tony could have had breakfast with the man first. Made sure he felt okay, take him down to the labs for Bruce to perform some tests, and
They approached the stairwell as cautiously as they could in their current conditions, Steve insisting upon taking the front position in case any stragglers happened to be hiding out and ready to attack. Tony rolled his eyes but let the stubborn idiot take the lead.
"Before you say anything," Tony said warily, "you ought to remember who fixes your armor."
The colonel moved Tony’s hand from his forehead and inspected the spot for himself, seemingly content that no grave damage had been wrought. The ease and comfort between the two was palpable even across the room and Steve wondered how long they’d known one another.
"No worries though. I've yet to meet a problem I couldn't solve or a machine I couldn't fix." The man moved back over to his cart, grabbing a screwdriver, and went back to the locker in question. With a few feverish hand movements, the locker popped open. Steve looked on, mouth agape, and was again overcome by admiration.
"Tony? Sorry it's so late. The dinner with the mayor took
“Yeah. Maybe it’ll help. My ma used to, when I was a tiny rapscallion.”
Thor barked out a laugh. “Patience, my friend. I am almost to that portion of the tale.”
“Gee, thanks.”
Many things had changed during the years Steve lay frozen, but the bright lights of New York City at Christmas time had steadfastly remained. They were brighter now, and more prevalent. The glowing blues and reds, greens and whites, brought a smile to his face every time he walked the streets. A steaming cup of hot cider in hand, Steve would wander through neighborhoods with an air of wonder and awe. Giant inflatable reindeer and snowmen, countless light displays, and Christmas carols echoing in the air were things he would never grow tired of.
Steve bowed his head for a moment, Tony watching wordlessly. Steve's Irish Catholic upbringing emerged every now and then, Tony joked in his head. Steve raised his gaze after a few seconds, lifting his chin in Tony's direction with a small grin. "Bon appetit."
“Isn’t it? It’s an old recipe. The best I ever had as a kid.” Tony took a bite of his own. Steve watched the other man’s features, looking for the smallest indication of anything belying the words bound to come out of Tony’s mouth. “Delicious.”
Bucky chose that moment to bump into Steve's side, a smug grin on his face. Steve squinted at him, part of their telepathic communication that had developed over the years:
"Bullet, they were aiming at the hinge in the armor where the neck plate snaps in. Didn't want to take any chances." Before Tony could respond that he could handle himself just fine, the other man was already on his feet and trading punches with the agent who had pulled the trigger.
Peter stepped in before the father-daughter duo could get carried away by one of their patented quip wars. They'd been known to last hours if they were both in the right mood.
But other times, like right now, three hours felt like an eternity. Steve stood by Tony's side, hands loosely held behind his back as someone -- a director or prime minister or something -- countered Tony's argument about something. Steve probably should have been listening. Oh well.
He arrived at the locker he'd put his clothing in and began fiddling with the lock mechanism. For some reason it wouldn't open, and Steve could feel anxiety rising in his gut. Why wasn't it opening? It had worked fine an hour ago! Then, to his shock and dismay, the tiny golden key broke right in half, the teeth stuck inside the lock itself.
He returned his attention to the man beside him, his heart beating fast behind his ribs. He forced himself to take a few deep breaths because having an asthma attack now wouldn’t do anyone any good. Then he caught the other man’s gaze and… wow. The man’s dark brown eyes were framed by some of the longest lashes Steve had ever seen.
Steve’s lips lift in the quickest smile Tony has ever seen before they fall back into a neutral expression. “This is all your fault.”
With the other Avengers following through with individual plans, only Steve and Tony remained at the Tower for Christmas Eve. In the beginning Steve had nearly fled, worried being the only other resident may make things unbearably awkward. But Tony had asked him to stay. Well, JARVIS had passed along the message that Tony had invited Steve to join him for his traditional Hallmark movie marathon. Steve had offered to make dinner and the rest was history.
Tony spared the woman a glance and a smile before returning his attention to Steve. "Just stand there and look pretty. I'll do the talking."
Steve cracked a smile that wasn't nearly big enough, in Tony's humble opinion. "Yeah, I do. Mind if I walk you down?"
"Are you okay?" Those blue eyes frilled with concern.
"We need to stop with this one-upmanship we've got going before one of us really does end up dead."
? That I didn't wonder if you'd just leave, never speak to me again?"
But that didn't lessen Steve's desire to stare them down with his patented glare of disappointment and see them cower as their words slowly faded into silence.
“Tell me a story,” Steve requested.
Tony sobered at that comment, absently taking a bite of fluffy sugary goodness. The pastry melted against his tongue, sugar crystals tingling pleasantly on his taste buds. “Are you? Hopelessly nostalgic, I mean.”
Well, that was quick.
Tony squawked in protest, but kept his body still in order to avoid putting his perilous position in any further danger. Steve lengthened his strides as he walked down the deserted hallway, taking care to cushion Tony from being jarred too badly with every step.
"Okay. Remember to stay quiet until your father fully opens his eyes."
Steve dressed himself slowly, wondering what he could possibly break that wouldn't be too suspicious or get him kicked out of the resort.
“As I was saying,” Thor continued, “through trial and error they discovered a potion that seemed to reverse the effects of the magic.”
"Mr. Rogers is in the building, sir. He says he brought lunch?" Tony couldn't help but smile at a bit at the intern's uncertainty. Wasn't every day, or any day at all, that Steve came to SI.
“Whoa. What happened? When did we get a dog?”
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDY!" Morgan shrieked joyously. She climbed into the bed without preamble, miraculously without incident, and held out her prize. "I made breakfast."
Steve could feel a tear pushing against his eyelid as he closed his eyes, so moved by the touching moment of pure adoration. Boy howdy did he miss his mom right now.
Steve felt his cheeks heat up once more. “Right. Yeah, I’m sure Sam has some spare clothes that’ll fit you.” Steve gestured at himself with a wry grin. “I’m afraid any of my stuff would be a bit too small.”
“Tony –”
“Did you do a taste test?”
"Could I... Possibly... Sleep in your bed?"
Steve kept moving, not in the mood to deal with the man who had brought this whole scenario into being. He looked down at Tony to check on his progress, startled to see Tony already gazing upward.
“Thanks, Tony. I would have swallowed it, trusted Thor implicitly, but you’re right to be skeptical. Who knows what that stuff might do?”
“Is the great savior of our country
Oh. Fuck. Had Steve caught him staring!? How long had he been staring?!
anyway hi I'm back from the dead zone
The first snow fell the week before, bringing along childlike wonder and snowball fights. Soon it turned to slush and ice, though those developments did little to dampen Steve's positive mood. Some may call him cheesy or overly sentimental, but something about the holiday spirit was infectious.
Bruce gave his thanks. Natasha smiled softly up at the ceiling. Interacting with Jarvis was the only time Tony ever saw such a gentle expression on her face. He had a sneaking suspicion, that he could not confirm via security footage and valued his life too much to ask her about directly, that she and Jarvis talked late at night when she couldn't sleep. Where else would Jarvis have learned a Russian lullaby?
Steve yawned loudly, like the word sleep had triggered an irresistible impulse. “Okay,” he murmured. “Goodnight, Tony.”
Steve paused, sparing the visibly upset prince a dry stare. "I'll deal with you later."
Steve had the decency to look sheepish as he stopped to lean against the battered cement wall. "Your suit was down. What else was I supposed to do?"
"Finally decided to wake up from your nap, Petey? Wanted to rejoin the land of the living once the food was ready?" Tony softly brushed his fingers across the baby's forehead, smiling when the little eyes blinked sleepily back up at him. "You're lucky you're cute, otherwise I'd be going crazy taking care of you. I love you so much, kiddo. And someday you're gonna be able to do all sorts of cool experiments with me and I'll never get tired of pulling your hands away from the soldering iron until you're actually old enough to use it. I can't wait to build things with you."
Did Tony not think about the fight they'd had on the plane last night? The disagreement weeks ago that initiated all this sour tension between them in the first place, did that mean nothing to him? It kept Steve awake at night, unable to focus on anything else.
"Did Mr. Throw Myself On A Live Grenade just tell me
"Guess we should be going," Tony reluctantly admitted. He was so not looking forward to spending the next hour in traffic with a douche Brit. Not that he had anything against Brits. He just had a bad feeling about this particular one. The kind of vibes that said he'd be hearing a lot about Gregory and not very much else.
“Magic such as this is delicate. It affects every being differently,” Thor explained patiently. “My people did thorough research to ensure to the best of our ability that this concoction would be attuned to the Captain.”
“Go to sleep, Steve.”
Steve seemed to take the opportunity to give Tony a glance over, gaze hovering around his wrists and collarbones, both exposed despite the button up shirt he wore. The best thing about being Tony Stark? He never had to iron his clothes, even though a lovely drawing from Clint implied otherwise. (Said drawing hung in the workshop above the Mark 1, an ode to what could have been had the name been a bit more literal.)
“On your left!”
As they walked through the threshold beneath the heat of wildly flashing cameras, Steve couldn't help but wonder if he had just made the biggest mistake of his life or the best decision he could have ever hoped for.
The wolf watched the object soar and then land with a hollow thud. Its gaze shifted to Clint, completely bored and uninterested. Tony bit back a laugh at the silent dismissal, and another at the way Clint’s expression fell. After a few moments of Clint giving his best pleading look, the wolf finally took pity on the man and dutifully trotted over to the abandoned shield. He picked the object up, the gleaming wood looking oddly comfortable between lupine jaws. He dropped it at Clint’s feet with a wolfish smile.
Steve followed him out, saying something about the diner having the best meatloaf he'd ever had (and that was saying something), when a male voice Tony didn't recognize called for his attention. Tony jerked himself into Anthony Stark, Millionaire Playboy Philanthropist mode, all the while inwardly steaming that some random pap had managed to track him down after all.
Bucky stepped fully into the room, shoving his arms carelessly through his sweater sleeves. He chuckled at the look of betrayal upon his best friend’s face. “Okay, okay. Let’s go then.”
"Definitely good." Tony turned back to Steve, his skin glowing in the soft light from the vanity. A song by Taylor Swift hummed softly in the background, bringing the moment into sharp relief when Tony stepped into Steve's space. "Ready for bed, soldier?"
Tony shrugged. He couldn't exactly say "well no one bothered us because I explicitly told them not to, or else," so he said the next best thing. "Probably another slow day at the office."
“Wait,” Tony said, his gaze ripped from the vial. “What do you mean this ‘
This, the third event of the
obvious about his discomfort in the situation.
Tom, the poor kid, stumbles over his parting words. “That sounds great, Mr. Stark. Hope you have a safe flight.” Then he turns back to the camera, eyes wide. “That’s all we have time for folks. A big thanks to Tony Stark for joining us. Make sure you pick up your own Immortal Tamagotchi this Friday in a toy store near you.”
Bruce: I’m surprised he lasted this long to be honest.
same room, obviously, but Tony's own little homage to it. He had mixed feelings where Howard was concerned, to put it lightly, but when the decorator had originally asked if Tony had any specific requests for the room... images of his father's office came unbidden: the mahogany desk with the brown leather wingback chair set regally behind it, the overflowing bookshelves, the personal bar in the corner, the landscape art prints his mother had picked out at various estate sales and charity auctions. Tony had said the words aloud, describing his memories without even realizing he was doing it. The end result left him with a sense of closure, somehow, so he'd kept it this way ever since.
A lapse of silence, which Tony knew meant Jarvis was carefully wording what he would say next.
"Come on, Cap. Work with me here. I may be Iron Man but I can't drag your dead weight around without the suit."
Steve ground his teeth behind the polite plastic smile stretching his lips. This person was going way too far. Possibly even worse than Christine Everhart, which wasn't something Steve thought possible. He instinctively took a step closer to Tony.
“Don’t I know it,” Tony replied. “My kid’s not even a year old yet, so I know I have a lot to look forward to in that regard.”
“Tony.”
Tony drew his gaze away from broad shoulders, which looked especially broad just now, and met the other man’s eyes instead. He dreaded taking this hope away from Steve, but some things had to be done. Plus, Tony was a bad news professional.
A flash of bright white light emanated from the portal, illuminating the room like a miniature sun, before dissipating just as quickly as it appeared. Left in its wake stood Thor, hair windblown like a surfer on their way home from a good day at the beach. In one hand he held Mjolnir, and in the other was an empty goblet which Thor causally tossed over his shoulder.
Steve covered his mouth to hide his chuckle but apparently he didn't succeed because at that moment Tony turned to face him, eyes wide like a deer caught in headlights. The toothbrush hung from the corner of his mouth, residual toothpaste dotting the corner of his lips, as the music continued to play at a softer volume.
"I'm sure," Gregory replied, his tone mirthful. "Have you eaten? You must be famished."
"Doesn't matter what his rank is. He shouldn't be treating people that way."
"Penny movies were always my favorites," Steve said as he said beside Tony. He removed the engineer's hands as to get a full analysis of the situation at hand. Tony huffed at the treatment but allowed Steve to look his fill.
"Of course, sir. Pleasant dreams, Captain."
The screen crackles to life in his lap, bringing Steve’s attention to a plush couch. A young man in a sharp suit holds a microphone and looks straight at the camera. To the man’s left is an empty cushion’s worth of space, and there, right on the edge of the screen, Steve can see the outline of Tony’s thigh bundled in tailored dress slacks. Would it be weird to say he could recognize the slope of that leg anywhere?
"We've been here less than two hours and you already have lay of the land?" Tony quipped. "I shouldn't be surprised. Boy Scout to the bone."
Somehow lying in a tub filled with hot mud, two technicians working on his hands and feet while he relaxed, made sense. Steve had never been the type for pampering. He kept his facial hair and nails clean to give a presentable and professional appearance, but all these lotions and oils and candles were out of his usual territory. He didn't think he'd enjoy something like this. He'd only taken the voucher when Fury mentioned deep tissue massages and jacuzzi tubs. But now… well, Steve could get used to this.
Tony held his breath. Silence enveloped the room, both men unsure what would happen next. Ten minutes passed with no visible effect.
“Forget I said anything,” Steve said as he rose to his feet amidst their newfound silence. He’d eaten the other half of his doughnut sometime during Tony’s emotional crisis. The glazed goodness in Tony’s hand suddenly felt heavy as a brick. “I’ll see you around, Tony.”
"Steve, fix your face."
"It might," Steve muttered shyly. Was he nervous? Embarrassed? Ashamed? Tony couldn't really tell. "Look, Tony." There it was, finally making an appearance: his Captain America voice. "I know this isn't exactly... normal."
Steve left the kitchen to meet Tony in the hallway. He’d just thrown his coat over the back of the nearest couch, JARVIS’ long-suffering sigh going unheeded, and now strode toward Steve with a covered dish in his hands.
Steve twisted further to follow the bullet's trajectory, landing on both feet in the direction of oblivious men and women gathered nearby. Suddenly his stomach dropped to the floor.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You’re no fun today.” When Jarvis didn’t grace him with a reply, Tony resigned himself to a night of cliché rom coms and a healthy dose of rocky road ice cream. He didn’t even like it much, but after years of eating it at MIT with Rhodey it had unironically become his comfort food in times of emotional stress. He wasn’t mourning the loss of Steve’s newfound friendship, no sir. It just felt like a “You’ve Got Mail” and “Crazy Stupid Love” kind of night.
“Yes, actually. Now eat.”
"How about a tour of the facility?" Tony interjected. Did he sound desperate? "I mean, that
"I'm sure you're a great dad, Tony."
"Mr. Stark?" came a tinny voice from somewhere behind Tony. In that moment it sounded more like a chorus of angels than an adolescent boy. Thank fuck.
Gregory laughed, like Tony was a stand up comedian at the Apollo telling the best joke the world had ever heard. "You jest, surely."
Steve felt himself relaxing, melting into Tony's embrace, stress lifted from shoulders. Finally he had an answer. The timbre of Tony's voice managed to calm him like nothing else had. Not since his ma had lulled him to sleep with lullabies when he couldn't stop coughing an hour past midnight on a school night.
He turned to face the other man anyway, attempting to keep a visible look of distaste off his features. He'd dealt with worse. "I do that," Tony offered as explanation. "Things to do, people to avoid. The work of Tony Stark never ends."
With every step Clint took, Tony’s shoulders tensed a bit further. Any second now, the archer would put the pieces together. He may be willfully dense at times, but Tony knew better than to think the man stupid. Silence hung in the air as he waited for Clint to speak.
Tony’s scientific mind felt validated, even as his logical mind became disappointed. “That sucks. All that hype for nothing?”
Were all the interns of Stark Industries otherwise detained? Tony's savior should have arrived by now. Apparently he needed to create a position entirely for pulling himself out of awkward situations. Make sure they were paid well for their service. Rhodey would throw a fit. "Where's my paycheck?" he would cry. "I've been saving your ass longer than half of these kids have been alive!"
With Tony still otherwise occupied, Steve decided to take matters into his own hands. Tony would be fine without him.
A clang from the other side of the bank of lockers sounded throughout the otherwise quiet room, causing Steve to jerk out of his moping and look around. Maybe this person could help?
Following an old hardwired protocol he and Bucky had developed in the days of their youth, Steve approached the couple casually. Best not to spook anyone before he could even get a word in. Once within earshot he directed a small smile at the woman and asked, "Nice shindig, don't you think?"
Tony stretched his arms as he laughed. Time to get out of bed. Unfortunately. Sleeping with Steve curled so close to his side had left behind a lingering warmth he wasn't quite ready or willing to rid himself of.
“Really?”
"Sit and rest, Tony. I can keep watch until rescue gets here to pick us up."
“Sounds on brand,” Clint commented.
“As adorable as this may be,” Tony said wryly, “I believe you have better things to do.”
Steve would be worried. Five hours with no food was nothing to Tony; he could, and had, go for entire days without sustenance of any kind beyond the ever-present pot of coffee. Steve, with his super serum enhanced metabolism, would probably get eaten alive from the inside in the same situation. And wasn’t
"You're telling me."
“I’m a well-rounded talent. Only the best for you, Spangles.” Tony motioned to the bed, hand hovering over what had quickly become Steve’s side of the mattress. “Get comfortable. I’ll grab the liquid moonlight and a yummy snack.” He went over to the mini-fridge, grabbed the Chinese takeout he’d saved from earlier with one hand and the small vial with the other hand, his fingers tightening their grasp subconsciously around smooth glass before loosening again.
"Hi. I'm Steve Rogers. I have a reservation here this weekend."
"Excuse me, sir."
“Back to the matter at hand, if I may,” Thor interjected. Tony scoffed at the interruption, but respectfully refrained from continuing his debate. “The potion will take effect within six hours of consumption. Once ingested, it should send you into a deep slumber. You may see some things. When you awaken, we will know one way or the other if it succeeded.”
"I have more than - "
“Steve! Steve? You’re here.”
Steve's smile faltered but he wished Tony a good night before heading off to the gym or wherever Steve went to unwind after a mission. Tony didn't really understand the reaction, but figured the man was probably tired and sad to see his only form of entertainment go. Fair enough.
Something in Steve snapped.
"Can't say I do," Steve replied breezily. "Should I?"
"What?"
“Short answer? I made it up. Long answer? I took some solid theories, ran a handful of equations with varying factors, ate some Cheetos I found in DUM-E’s cubby, and picked the number that made the most sense. Not my finest moment, what with the Cheetos, but I made it work.”
“Language!”
. Forever.
"Steve!"
"Yeah, he's the center of my universe," Tony replied. And with the reverence in his voice, Steve could tell instantly just how true that was. "Never pegged myself as the fatherly type, to be honest. Can't say I regret it."
"Well that was fun," Clint announced when it was apparent no one else planned on breaking the silence that had fallen following Thor's departure. He idly wiped his mouth with the back of his hand before standing. "I'm going to bed." Tony watched with an amused smile as Clint stopped in the kitchen to grab a snack on his way out. A snack sounded good right about now. And also some coffee. An entire pot of it.
"There seems to be an ongoing blaze in the common kitchen, sir. Sir Odinson is quite admirably attempting to extinguish it without outside assistance."
Thor: Congratulations my dear friend! It seems you will be reunited with your love soon!
Taking the route he knew to be cowardly, Tony left his office and headed straight to the private elevator coded to ride directly to his penthouse. Three steps forward and ten steps backward, aka the story of his life.
“Whatever, birdbrain.”
“I would hazard to guess he has forgiven me, albeit reluctantly. Our good Captain is pure hearted, indeed.” Thor stood, returning his attention to Tony. “My friend, please tell me what has happened in my short absence. Did he awaken as such?”
"Shoot."
. Tony could have
"Already done, sir."
With nothing else to do, Steve took in their surroundings fully. He could use some electrical tape and another fragment of his already destroyed button down to fashion a makeshift bandage to place over the break in Tony's skin. Not his best work, but it was the best he could do in the moment.
Of course, Clint takes this response as encouragement to go on an endless tirade, pinging back and forth between gourmet hot dogs being a conspiracy by the wealthy to gentrify even the foods they looked down upon and describing in detail how badly Steve has it for Tony. Answer: very badly. The others put in their two cents every other message, and while their words are amusing, Steve decides to put his phone down for a while and grab something to eat.
What. Was. That?
“Already done, sir. The Captain should arrive shortly.”
Steve grunted in response.
“I find myself quite fond of such delicacies and wished to share their existence with you. I believe you may have similar tastes to mine, as evidenced by previous experiences.”
Tony took his mug of freshly brewed coffee in hand, walking over to bump Steve's shoulder gently. The man grumbled under his breath but didn't move away. "You're adorable in the mornings, you know that?"
A cabinet slammed shut across the room, jerking Tony's attention from the warm, pliant supersoldier currently leaning against him. His eyes landed on a ruffled looking Clint, the man half asleep but completely unrepentant.
“Guess that settles things,” Clint said idly. “Have fun with your new pet, Ironsides.” He turned to leave the room and Tony couldn’t help the words that left his mouth.
After forty minutes they finally approached the man who'd given Steve reason to be suspicious. The man's smile was reminiscent of a moray eel, and his demeanor seemed just as slippery.
A small shuffling sound behind him reminded Tony about the coffee and doughnuts that had magically appeared and brought him fully out of his peaceful slumber. He twisted his chair in the appropriate direction with eager anticipation. He did
Steve chuckled. "No, but I'd like to thank my hero properly. If that's alright."
"Fine, put that flamethrower on its ass already so I can get back in there."
"Is finding you in my bed going to become a regular occurrence?"
The kid's eyes lit up, so Tony guessed he remembered the right name after all. "You're welcome, sir. Should I tell Mr. Rogers you'll be right up?"
"Are you alright?"
Steve, Tony noticed belatedly, looked almost like a surfer fresh off the waves. His skin had a slight glow to it and the scent of ocean spray, probably his soap, filled Tony's nostrils when he took a breath. The man in question had his hair pushed up in multiple directions like he'd run his fingers through it rather than a towel. Tony mentally berated himself for losing focus. Clever wit, yes. Speechless gawking, no.
“Welcome everyone. I’m Tom, reporting for Tech Moguls, and we have a treat tonight! The legendary Stark Industries President and CEO –“
"What are you waiting for?" the disgruntled royal interjected. "Arrest him! He not only verbally disrespected me, but he laid hands on me!"
," he muttered. "Tony, are you okay?" Steve got to his knees, quickly running his hands over every inch of Tony he could reach. No head wounds, no vital organs hit, no loss of breath or consciousness. Good signs so far.
Tony smirked before saying, "Are you going to sleep at the foot of the bed like a good boy?"
“No one says that anymore,” Tony replied good-naturedly. “But sure, get going. We’ll be here, impatiently awaiting your triumphant homecoming.”
"Your boss? Are you not your own boss?"
“Sorry,” Steve said. “Habit. I used to help out at the orphanage when I was younger and kids have an uncanny ability for getting messy.”
"You're both idiots," he slurred tiredly, pointing first to Steve and then to Tony. "But I'm glad you finally got your heads out of your asses."
Tony told himself. He hated being the center of attention anyway.
Tony looked completely unimpressed by the show of emotion. "Why do you even care?" he asked tiredly.
Tony smiled as his heart twisted in his chest. “I know the feeling.”
But of course, Tony's mind was probably playing tricks on him. Sleep deprivation and agitated injuries had that effect on a person.
Donning his resort provided robe over his t-shirt and board shorts, Steve left the comfort of his bed and went in search of the correct spa facilities. This place, spread out as it was, needed a map. Eventually he ended up back at the reception desk to ask for directions. Turned out there
They spent the remainder of the night on the couch, a tub of popcorn between them, their previous food induced traumas forgotten as they argued over who would save New York City from a soulless corporation executive who hated Christmas.
"Comrade, I am glad you have come."
The ride up in the elevator to the twenty-third floor seemed to last only a minute with the way Tony's thoughts swirled. Steve brought lunch. For the two of them.
“I’d like to point out that the Captain hasn’t left this room since he arrived.”
Steve thought. "Thanks, squirt. I feel like a king!" He looked left and right, as if expecting a scepter and adoring crowd to appear. "Where's my golden goblet?"
onto the bookcase in its rightful place between
"That's not a surprise," Tony scoffed, pulling out of Steve's grasp to rinse his mouth and drop the toothbrush back into its holder. "Did he at least say anything worthwhile?"
Luckily it seemed like the bullet had grazed Tony's side rather than lodging itself inside flesh. Steve ripped a strip of fabric from his dress shirt and wiped down the area as best he could.
Steve chuckled, fondness oozing from the sound. Or maybe Tony was projecting? “Felt weird watching Star Trek without you.”
Tony forced himself to close his eyes, focus on the rhythm of his breathing. Within the span of a few breaths, Steve was fast asleep. A couple of heartbeats later, Tony followed suit.
“Excuse me for interrupting,” the AI said gently, using the same as to pull Tony from his zone while embroiled in a project. “But I believe it would be prudent to inform Sir Odinson of the current circumstances, seeing as he may have the best idea of how to proceed.”
“Nope! Good guess though.”
Tony tossed a careless farewell in old Greg's general direction, charting his course for the private elevator that led up to his personal office. He could feel the Brit's disbelieving stare and had to stop himself from fist-pumping the air in self-satisfaction. That could not have gone better, really. TJ had a thank you basket in his future.
“Okay,” Steve responded, stretching out each letter slowly. “You still have cheese dust on your fingertips, by the way.”
Thor shook his head. “Not if I can help it. If my estimates are correct, all should be well soon. Within a fortnight, two at most.”
“All signs would seem to support that hypothesis.”
Soft cooing sounds from the other room caught Steve's attention and he found himself following them to discover the source of the noise, leaving his raucous group of friends behind.
Tony gaped at the man now laid out on the floor. "Are they even conscious right now?"
that? Did that truly just happen?
"It was all Steve, I swear!"
outside of the refuge of his mind just yet – rose to its feet as well, letting its head drop in what could be perceived as a sort of bowing movement. “Are you nodding at me?” Tony clarified. The wolf looked him in the eye before turning its head toward the door with a snort. “Okay, okay, we’re going.”
Tony ran the fingers of his free hand across the top of Steve's hair, then let the strands slide between thumb and forefinger. "Sounds like a plan," he replied, smiling when Steve nearly purred the moment Tony scratched gently against his scalp. "Can't think of a better person to be stuck with, if I'm being honest."
“It would seem you are upset regarding Captain Rogers’ disappearance. If I may direct your attention elsewhere for just a moment, I believe you will see that distress is unwarranted.”
Shirako loosely translates to "white children" and is fish sperm, or sometimes the actual testes themselves.
He owed Fury a thank you note.
He had lived and loved longer than most people, by any normal standards, but no other moment in time could compare to this.
Steve had this endearing habit where he talked to the owners of virtually every family run restaurant he went to regularly, got to know them a bit, and made a point of keeping up with their lives. Seeing as Frankie's was just a block or so from the tower, it was safe to say they all went there often enough to warrant such a camaraderie in Steve's books. Their daughter, Frankie, had a birthday card signed by all of them that she kept framed in her bedroom. If Frank was to be believed. The man had a knack for tall tales so who knew.
When he arrived at the designated room, they directed him to the men's lockers to disrobe. No one had mentioned the sauna was a
Tony's eyes slowly fluttered open after a moment, his lips mirroring the soft expression Steve was sure resided on his own face.
Tony loved having an extremely competent AI in moments like this. He really did. He deserved a pat on the back. And so did Jarvis. He'd have to do something about getting Jarvis a physical form at some point.
to do things for Tony; Tony would just smile, and thank Steve, and pretend it wouldn’t hurt when Steve was cured and they went back to the friendly distance they’d shared prior to all the magic nonsense.
Steve looked from Tony on the floor to the gathering of shocked speechless onlookers, to the man who had accidentally shot Iron Man, and back to Tony. "Kind of late for that."
"Papa?"
JARVIS welcoming him into the tower was nice, but he craved the warm embrace of Tony's arms.
The woman nodded demurely, typing something into the computer set up in front of her. "Yes, here we are. Will you be staying the entire weekend?"
"He's at my office already?" A nod. "Yeah, tell him I'll be there in two shakes." Tony slipped himself out of Gregory's grasp, which had loosened throughout the exchange, and moved to give the kid a handshake. "Thank you," he said as he looked TJ straight in the eye. He flicked a dismissive glance toward Gregory and added, "Take care of our guest, will you?"
Tony awoke from his work induced nap to the smell of freshly pressed coffee and doughnuts. He didn’t even remember falling asleep in the workshop. After lunch with Steve he’d sneaked into the R&D labs of SI in order to keep up his lucky streak of avoiding Gregory. A handful of company scientists had openly gaped at his appearance, but the few who’d been with him since his younger years went back to their work like he was an annoying fly that would see itself out of the room eventually. Tony had kept up appearances for the newbies, checked on the progress of each project, then congratulated everyone on a job well done.
"Of course, my highness. Please forgive my misstep."
“Put the shop on lockdown, J. And don’t let anyone into the suite. Unless it’s Thor with a cure.”
With no further ado, he lifted Tony up into a comfortable perch in his arms and left the room.
"You sure taught him a lesson, didn't you?"
"You look like you just ate a pound of lemons," Tony murmured softly enough for just Steve to hear.
Steve found his room and got settled in, looking over the various items in the room. Sam would get a kick out of the fruit bowl. By the time Steve had surfed through all the channels on the TV and found nothing interesting, it was time for him to enjoy his first organized activity of the weekend: a mud bath and facial.

“The moment of truth,” Tony intoned as Steve popped the metal stopper from the mouth of the vial. Silver liquid sloshed ominously as Steve lifted the container to his lips. He lifted it higher in a mock salute to Tony, uttered “down the hatch,” and swallowed it all in one gulp.
As soon as he sat down, he closed his eyes and let out a contented sigh. The attendant would call in on the intercom to tell him when his time was over, so Steve let his mind wander. His hands drifted of their own accord, marveling over how loose and pliant his muscles felt beneath his fingers. He hadn't felt this relaxed since… ever, maybe?
"Gladly."
"Guess I should be going," the super soldier said. He gathered the debris left in the wake of their meal, ignoring Tony's assertions he could handle it, and tossed it all back into its original home. Tony eyed the bag wearily. Stupid bag. "We've been up here for a couple hours," Steve remarked, drawing Tony's gaze. "I'm surprised no one called in or barged up here with some emergency for you to handle."
Steve entered the room, placing their lunch on the coffee table positioned in the middle of the room. Then he walked the perimeter, taking in the various paintings on the walls as well as the clutter spanning the bookshelves that Tony had come to love. Gifts from clients, photographs with diplomats, an old paperweight that once belonged to Maria. Odds and ends of wire or metal he'd tinkered with in his spare time but had never thrown away.
I made myself sit down and write this out because all you wonderful people deserve better
Tony's lips were somehow softer than Steve had imagined. Maybe there would be a next time -- would there be a next time? -- and he'd be able to sink into it for a while. Truly relish having Tony in his arms. Even with lips numb from nerves and his fingers spasming against Tony's nape, it was easily the most explosive Steve had ever felt. As quickly as it began, Steve forced himself to pull away.
“What’s in the bowl?” Steve asked, reaching out to take it from Tony with the manners his mother had hammered into his mind decades ago.
his subconscious pondered. She would say to find the reason at the bottom of all this. She would do whatever she could to help. She would make Steve as comfortable as possible.
The nine year old grinned proudly as he presented a plate towering with scrambled eggs and bacon strips. "I've got it, Dad," he assured. Grabbing a fork from the nearby drawer, he walked over to stand beside his sister.
“Thanks, I think.” Clint bent to pick up the training shield, gasping dramatically before dropping it as if it burned him. “Ewwwww, wolf spit.”
Morgan twitched her nose in displeasure. "Daddy, I told you I'm too old to be a pumpkin. I don't eat them either."
“What? No teasing? No telling me you look forward to the wedding so you can bring dog treats?”
“J, can you test this stuff?” Tony snatched the vial from Steve’s grasp. “No way it’s going anywhere near Steve if we don’t even know what it’s capable of.”
“Journey?” Tony questioned. “You mean him going to sleep?”
Thor eating traditional Japanese delicacies is something that my brain wanted to happen. I've never had either of them myself, but according to Google they are "acquired tastes".
Tony opened his mouth -- to say something scathing, Steve was sure -- and moved to face the reporter once more. Steve could feel all the eyes on them. His blood thrummed in his eardrums. Hand sliding down to the base of Tony's neck, Steve did the one thing he promised himself he'd never do: he kissed Tony Stark.
to happen, I’m sure I could fix it. I’m great at that sort of thing.”
“Last question.”
Tony collapsed onto the sofa with a relieved sigh, feeling utterly exhausted after the Avengers' nasty tussle with a group of alien warlocks. Everyone else followed suit, excepting Thor who stood in the midst of them all.
“Bruce recommended the books, Clint forced me to watch the musicals.” Steve spread his hands casually, as if this wasn’t some mind-blowing information. “I had a lot of time to kill.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sweet freedom," he murmured, one safely outside the range of Pepper's hearing. Ears like an elephant, that one had, and the memory to match. It wasn't that he didn't like being updated on the state of his company. He just preferred the solace and comfort of his workshop to being judged and graded by people he didn't really care for.
Steve flushed, cursing his fair complexion and traitorous skin. “Uh, no. I’m Steve.”
TJ's eyes widened, probably because of the twenty dollar bill Tony had just palmed him, but he nodded and promised to have the man safely delivered to his destination.
“Right,” Tony said aloud, remembering he had company and needed to speak. “I’ll deal with my snitch AI later. In my defense, some of that time included sleeping. If that makes you feel any better.”
"Ugh," Tony grumbled, then rejoined the fray himself.
“Anything you want, Tony. I’m just here to listen.”
"Time?"
"Frank and Diane say hello, by the way."
Less than twenty minutes ago he had been willing to take a bullet, maybe even die, for Tony. But Tony had been the one who had jumped into harm's way on Steve's account for no reason other than to protect him. Steve was the super solider.
couldn't resist adding another note
"Your usual, I'm guessing?"
"I did. As well as the third, fourth, and fifth sleep aids. None of them worked."
Tony, eyes glazed, looked so vulnerable in that moment Steve wanted to tear the world in two. He could count on one hand the amount of times he'd truly seen the man before him in a raw, open state of being. So no one could blame him for moving to hunch over Tony, to protect him from the pain Steve himself had caused. The tears threatening to spill from his eyes didn't matter. He'd just laid his cards out on the table, offered his heavy heart to a man he had despised and admired and slowly come to love.
“You’re going right now? What am I supposed to do about Steve? How long will you be gone this time? Do I feed him human food or wolf food? What about missions and disasters?” Tony began to pace as the words spilled out of him. He was so overwrought he didn’t even notice the wolf begin to pace beside him, keeping even steps though Tony’s gait sped up and faltered in intervals. “What do I tell the team? Fury? What if he gets sick while you’re gone? Is there such a thing as a magical veterinarian?”
Steve took a calming breath. Looking around and seeing no one, he banged on the locker a couple times in hopes of a miracle. Nothing happened. He tried jiggling the handle back and forth, up and down, side to side. Nothing. He tried pushing inward and pulling outward. He pleaded with it, threatened it, offered some ice cream. Nothing changed.
the two of them. He knew he was being ridiculous, reading into things. Cap couldn't help himself. The spell made him need to spend time with Tony. Sooner or later this would all be over and things would go back to normal. No more bed sharing or work lunches or hand holding. And that was
He rolled onto his back, looking blankly at the ceiling as tears welled in the corners of his eyes against his will.
“Fine,” Steve acquiesced. He lifted a lump of potatoes to his mouth and muffled a displeased groan. He forced himself to swallow the gritty mess that not even copious amounts of butter could mask. “They’re fine.”
in my bedroom? Did Steve decide to adopt his next of kin without telling me?” Tony paused and closed his eyes, forcing himself to take a deep breath. He could be calm and collected. Just a larger than average wolf, no big deal.
“Go for it.”
"Ignoring Jarvis for the sake of beauty sleep isn't acceptable."
“Be a good boy and eat your dinner,” Tony quipped as he turned back toward Steve. The sight that met his eyes brought his brain to a momentary standstill, which was a feat on its own.
with the urge to shake the man in front of him. All of the anxiety and bottled up anger from the last few days, hell the last few
"Mr. Stark," the voice called out again. This time Tony actually looked at the guy. He wore a dark pinstripe suit, black oxfords, and a white necktie. Business attire. Maybe not a pap? His blond hair and slight British accent made something click in Tony's mind and he vaguely remembered Pepper mentioning this guy before. Some man from the U.K. who was fascinated by the company and wanted to pay a visit to HQ, and maybe invest some capital if he liked what he saw. Blah, blah, blah. Usually he left it to Pep to entertain potential investors and the like, but apparently this guy had asked for him specifically and wouldn't take no for an answer. And what with the amount of materials (and general destruction) the Avengers went through on a regular basis, a bit more money in the company was never really a bad thing.
Steve rolled his eyes in the way only Steve could manage. "How was work?"
Peter led the way through the hall and up the stairs on bare feet, followed by Morgan in her fluffy slippers. Steve pulled up the rear, eyes peeled for any potential mishaps. Other than a near incident when Morgan's big toe hit the banister, they successfully reached their destination.
Steve filed away the fact that the man was a father to an infant as they entered the house together. Bucky stood at the doorway, giving Steve a knowing look that did nothing for the flush of heat still lingering in Steve’s cheeks. He couldn’t have a crush on a man he’d literally just met, he just couldn’t.
"I'm fine, Cap. It's just a scratch. It'll quit bleeding soon."
"I was thinking of going for a run, since I slept through my usual routine. Then probably grab something for lunch at the diner down the street," Steve explained as they reached the elevator. The doors dinged open as soon as Steve stretched out his hand. "Thanks, Jarvis. After you," he said to Tony with a sweep of his arm. Tony obliged him. "Want me to pick you up anything?"
"Gregory, wasn't it?" Tony asked cautiously, but made himself sound more disinterested than unsure. He had a reputation to uphold, after all.
"Love you too," he intoned before slipping the phone back into his pocket. Checking to ensure he had everything he needed, Tony left the office portion of his workshop. And walked smack dab into a wall of muscle.
Tony met the man halfway to the black sedan parked conspicuously at the curb, Steve by his side. Tony could have sworn he heard something like a growl escape the soldier's lips, but he'd probably just imagined it. "My boss likes to keep me informed," Tony replied succinctly. No need to give the guy a bigger ego.
“Yep. Muscles here will pop on over, grab the reverse wolfsbane, and everything will be back to normal in no time,” Tony reassured.
Tony, on the other hand, didn't receive the same luxury. Everywhere he went the man was tailed by paparazzi, accosted by reporters, approached by fans, and the interactions on social media were above and beyond Steve's reach. Tony gave press conferences, smiled for every camera in his sight line, and always had some witty one liners up his sleeve to bring his audience to a friendly state of mind. Steve couldn't imagine being as graceful as Tony if he were in the same situation.
“Sir, if I may?”
"Grazie." Tony excitedly lifted the lid of his dish, sighing happily when linguine doused in white sauce with chunks of chicken greeted his eager eyes. Chicken alfredo held a special place in his heart, so sue him. He picked up his fork and dug in, the fact that he hadn't eaten anything in the past twelve hours hitting him hard. Belatedly he realized he probably looked like a crazed dog capitalizing on an unsupervised steak dinner. But at the moment he didn't really care.
Steve fought the grip on his shoulders enough to catch Tony's eye. The wounded man stood in the doorway of the closet now, leaning half his weight on the door jamb.
Steve dropped his hands and turned his body to the right, leaving the man and woman safely ensconced behind two security guards. The third watched open-mouthed as the bullet soared right past Steve into the crowd of other men of import.
"As long as one of them isn't wetting the bed, I'll survive. Bye, Tony. See you at home."
“Something like that.”
"I don't see how." Tony waited for a scathing quip from the AI in question but none came. Apparently he would let it slide. "How's the search for a cure going?"
“Sure,” Tony replied easily enough, one eyebrow lifting of its own accord.
"Yes. This strudel of the toaster is more wily than I anticipated."
"Say that again," Tony rasped. "I'm hallucinating from a combination of shock, dehydration, and blood loss. That's the only viable explanation for what I just heard. But say it again anyway. It'll be a nice sendoff, to have the last words I ever hear be a love confession from god damn Captain fucking America."
"You wouldn't though."
"By all means," Steve replied, sweeping his arms out in a gesture of invitation.
“Rhodey bear! Do you truly think so little of me?” Tony placed his free hand over his heart, a long suffering sigh leaving his lips. “I thought what we had was special.”
"Of course. See you later, Tony." And then another impossible thing happened: Steve leaned down and hugged him. A lingering, more than the customary ten second, sort of hug that left Tony breathless. Steve smiled at him when he broke the embrace, completely ignoring Gregory as he walked away.
“Thor has returned from his journey and claims to have the antidote he spoke of previously. He asks for the team to join him on the common floor.”
Tony followed suit, his face immediately scrunching into a look of displeasure. “Uh, yeah. Just fine.” He went for a bite of mashed potatoes and instantly took a long sip of wine. “Jesus, Cap. What did you put in these potatoes? Sand?”
Tony rounded the corner of the hallway, mentally telling the Rhodey voice to stop being so damn right all the time.
"You're a rare one, Steve," Tony said teasingly, "but sure. Who am I to deny a man paying off a debt."
“You know what? I’m not even going to ask.” Tony threw up his arms, more and more done with this whole ordeal with every passing second. “I’ve done enough worrying for one night.” He paused, looking up at one of the cameras in the corner of the room to address Jarvis directly. “And don’t even consider whatever it is you’re thinking right now, J.”
“Excuse my form of entrance, dear friends,” Thor said as he placed Mjolnir on the floor and then patted his shoulders free of any debris left from his travels. “I have just dined with the Supremest of Sorcerers. His insistence to provide transportation for my safe passage from the far lands of the Eastern Skies would not be denied. I apologize for startling you.” The god paused when Steve growled audibly, smiling down on the wolf as he would an old friend. “It is good to see you, Captain, though I wish I had not alarmed you so. Man of Iron, I wonder if I can ask a question of you?”
Quietly, he crouched down and dug his hands into the snow. He packed it into a decently sized snowball and aimed it at Bucky’s back. A smile took over his features as he called, “Hey, Buck?”
Tony released a breath in relief. “Thank Odin — and whatever other god there is that relates to wolves – that you decided to not eat me. Not that I thought you would,” he reassured when Steve tilted his head thoughtfully to one side. “This is weird. I’m talking to a wolf. Is this how Little Red Riding Hood felt?” He didn’t know anything significant about wolves – zoology wasn’t really his specialty – but literally having Steve’s head in his hands felt like an ultimate show of trust.
Jarvis didn't need body language to convey a healthy dose of sarcasm. His reply of, "Fondly, sir," could freeze the Eye of Sauron with no problems.
“Of course.”
Bucky peeked around the corner, his head halfway through the neck hole of his puce green sweater bedecked with light up reindeer antlers. “Relax, Stevie. They love us too much to cut off our dicks.”
“As ready as I’ll ever be.”
The last activity for the day was one Steve had been very much looking forward to: the sauna. An entire hour of just sitting in a room of steam, letting the stress sweat itself out of him. Even better was the fact Steve would have the room all to himself, no need for idle small talk with strangers.
“After I take it, would it be alright for me to… if I stayed with you?” Oh, those blue irises and soft gaze would be Tony’s death. “If it’s too much, I understand.”
From the stove a line of smoke drifted up into the exhaust vent, the contents of the pan bubbling ominously.
“What brings you here anyway?” Tony doubted Steve came by (Twice! In the same day!) just to make sure Tony ate something substantial. “Aside from your heroic endeavors to ensure I don’t starve myself.”
"It's a good one," Tony agreed fondly. "I still think he posed that way on purpose. Even bots know their good side."
Unsurprisingly, the wolf took an interest in the punching bags and weight station that Steve favored whenever he came into the gym to burn some steam. Tony held in a laugh when the wolf snorted derisively at a sweaty towel someone had left behind.
“As far as I could tell, the potion should work and return you to your previous state of mind, Captain. Considering your strength, there should be no other consequences.”
Steve chuckled. Tony relished the sound. He was screwed and he might as well enjoy this easy camaraderie with Steve while it lasted.
Tony, despite his better judgment screaming about how bad of an idea this was, heard himself say, "You can stay."
They ate in companionable silence after that, more focused on finishing the fries before they ended up cold and essentially inedible. Clint asserted they tasted just as good if reheated in the toaster over, but he was the only heathen among them to truly believe that blasphemy. In the meantime, Steve ate his way through three cheeseburgers while Tony polished off the remainder of his pasta.
Tony glanced at the clock. One hour and eleven minutes into a new day. “He couldn’t wait until a more reasonable hour?”
Tony twisted around just in time to be pushed to the ground, a mound of supersoldier laying on top of him. He coughed as the full brunt of Steve's weight knocked the air from his lungs. "Ow. What the fuck, Cap?!"
Tony made his way to the kitchen on the common floor, blinking against the sudden change of lighting. Usually JARVIS would lower the brightness, but since nothing happened Tony assumed someone else already occupied the kitchen. His hypothesis was proven correct when he turned the corner and spotted Steve sitting at the counter and rubbing at his eyes.
The wolf stood, pushing its muzzle into Tony’s hand. Then it walked to the door and sat, looking at Tony expectantly. Tony looked up the ceiling in supplication, but his genius AI had nothing to say. “Alright,” he acquiesced. “Lead the way, Cap.”
"Thanks." Tony rose to his feet. "Time to eat. I gotta get something in me before the kid realizes he's hungry too."
Tony's inner Pepper chose that moment to flash a big red alarm, reminding him of his imminent evisceration if he didn't get a move on. He shook himself from within his inner turmoil, compartmentalizing his current predicament to be dealt with later.
Steve huffed a breath through his nose, returning to Tony’s side. Tony’s hand fell to his side, instinctively running his fingers through the thick, wiry fur brushing against his fingertips. The action soothed him as much as it soothed Steve.
Steve couldn't help glancing over at the man in question every few minutes. The "financial advisor" role fit Tony like a second skin. Though he wore many hats and many faces depending on the situation, Steve liked this one the least. Seeing Tony mingling and chatting up various people with an engaging smile and intrepid charm rubbed against Steve's already frayed nerves.
Tony tossed the shield toward the opposite side of the room, knowing the wolf would be able to retrieve it easily no matter who threw it. Wait… maybe he could ask Bruce to hulk out. That would be a fun experiment.
After a few hours of discussing various topics, Bruce went to his room for the night. Natasha stuck around for a further half hour before she too left for the solace of her room. The quirk of her lips as she bid Steve goodnight wasn't lost on Tony, but he still had no idea exactly what it meant. In her defense, one did not often see Steven Grant Rogers curled on his side and snoozing comfortably on the lap of Anthony Edward Stark. Truly a sight to behold, in Tony's humble opinion.
"Sure it will."
"You saw what I saw. He was obviously genetically enhanced, and we don't have time for another stretched out battle. I don't know about you but I'm starting to get exhausted, which means we've been at this at least two hours too long."
Five more steps cleared the distance between them. Tony crouched down to put himself at the wolf’s eye level, consistently chanting in his mind: this is Steve, this is Steve, this is
“Wait. Is that Cap?”
Tony opened the door wide without really thinking about it. The sight that met his eyes nearly melted the last cynical remnants of his overly abused heart.
"I couldn't imagine --"
When Fury had given them all vouchers for a free weekend at the spa resort forty minutes outside of town, Steve had been suspicious. His boss rarely showed sympathy, so why did he suddenly tell his employees to take a load off after a hectic season? It seemed fishy, even Sam thought so. But who was he to look a gift horse in the mouth and question his sudden fortune?
"You're late, Tony," came the oft heard sigh of disapproval.
hated magic.
Sakura Niku loosely translates to "cherry blossom meat" and is horse meat.
Curious, Steve followed the sound. It felt vaguely familiar, though he wasn't sure why. Peeking his head around the doorway, Steve smiled at the sight that met his gaze.
“You’re absurd.”
Clint: Sam grow up you’re ruining the vibe supportive friends only
The man turned to face him and Steve couldn't help but feel awed to be in the presence of a man so beautiful. He could write odes about those wide, expressive eyes, the plush lips sliding into a knowing smirk. Steve blinked.
Tony shook his head fondly as the wolf loped off at a speedy pace, perhaps hoping to impress his spectators. Steve, as modest as he could be, was such a show-off.
As Steve bustled around the kitchen on the common floor, he wondered what had possessed him to offer to cook for the both of them. He hadn't cooked a full meal since… before crashing headfirst into a seventy year long nap. Tony made sure the kitchens were well stocked, and ordering food was as simple as speaking aloud to JARVIS about any craving he may have. Between missions and being out and about the city, he rarely stayed around the Tower long enough to have a full meal.
“Has he spoken to you?”
"As lovely as this is," Sam said from the doorway to the kitchen, "food's done. We should probably eat it before it gets cold and gross."
Steve nodded, giving a standard "you're welcome" in return.
"Yeah sure. What did you break this time?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"You know the serum makes a lie in nearly impossible," Steve muttered. "I hate it some days but there's nothing I can do."
Settling for a swig of mouthwash instead, Tony halfheartedly rinsed leftover rocky road from his taste buds. He should probably talk to Steve about this latest development between them. He would apologize for overreacting, assure Steve things were still fine between them, and then everything could go back to the way it had been before Tony’s minor freak out. Steve could say things like how he
Steve reached out a hand and helped to haul the other man to his feet, dusting off the excess snow still lingering on his jacket and jeans. The gesture was so second nature that Steve didn’t even realize he was doing it until the other man laughed softly.
As Tony stared, the lump of fur
Clint held up his hands in the universal gesture of “sorry, my bad” and said nothing further.
"This is my favorite," Steve remarked, his hand softly tracing the frame of a photo consisting of DUM-E's first successful attempt at putting out a fire in Tony's MIT-era workshop. Tony himself could be seen in the corner, clapping. He remembered Rhodey letting out a supportive "WHOOP" as he snapped the photo.
“I’ll see what Jarvis comes up with,” Steve declared. “I’ll let you all know in the morning.”
"Just going to open the door, sir. It might take a little force."
Tony flapped a hand. "Great. Less talking, more going."
"Oh! I remember!" Steve held a finger to his lips and Morgan's voice dropped back to a whisper. "You said we could make breakfast and surprise!" She happily grabbed the plate of toast from the kitchen counter and brandished it like a knight's blade.
"Can I come in?"
"But," Steve continued, his voice steely with determination to get through his next set of words, "I think it would be best to just accommodate this... abnormality, so to speak... while it lasts. So if you could take this seriously for a second, and sincerely consider if sharing your bed would be something you'd be comfortable doing for however long it takes to find some reversal spell, I would greatly appreciate that."
"And tea for Dr. Banner and Miss Romanov, of course."
"Yeah, because tyrannical princes always settle things peacefully," Tony muttered in Steve's ear.
To anyone who’s kept this story in your minds or hearts, you’re incredible and I don’t deserve you.
"Thor set the toaster on fire," Tony rebutted.
“I’m fine, J. I know you’re worried about me, and I appreciate that very much, but I’ll be fine. It’s not my first heartbreak rodeo.”
Steve, bless him. "That would be great. Thanks." Two cakes. One wouldn't be enough for his heightened metabolism anyway.
"Mr. Stark! Over here, please!"
"Hey there, Capsicle. Long day?"
“We’ll get the alien CapriSun lecture from Thor, tuck you up nice and cozy in bed, have you take your medicine with some food, and you’ll be out like a light before you know it. By the time Clint wakes up, I swear he’s the only person here who sleeps somewhat normal hours, we’ll know whether this worked or failed terribly.”
"Time to go inside, sweetheart."
He mentally debated whether waking Steve up was a good idea. Eventually his need to pee won out, so he cautiously lifted one leg to see how Steve would react. The slumbering man grunted, resettled himself, then stretched out one arm to wrap himself securely within Tony's space.
"It's fine, Tony. Don't worry about it." Steve stood to leave. A part of Tony didn't want him to go. "I'll make do. Maybe go down to the gym and tire myself out."
originally this chapter went in a different direction but since it was accidentally deleted and i had to start from scratch, this is what came out
basting anyway? -- though the pork chops he'd thrown together had turned out alright. Since the risotto was unsalvageable, that left mashed potatoes as their only side dish. At least he could still boil potatoes without incident. The dessert he'd planned, a majestic peppermint cheesecake, had stubbornly remained a mystery. He couldn't get it to set, no matter what he tried, so he'd grudgingly admitted defeat and purchased one. Maybe Tony wouldn't notice.
He stood up and went to grab the tape, feeling Tony's eyes on him. When he returned to Tony's side, crouched with his hand extended, Tony pushed him away.
“It’s okay, Steve, it’s just Thor being Thor,” he assured, hands falling to pet the fur atop the wolf’s head. “People say I’m the one who has to be center of attention, but they’ve clearly never been in the same room as Asgardian royalty.”
The wolf returned the favor, snuffling gently against Tony’s palm. He nosed his way across Tony’s wrist, and Tony fought a shiver at the touch. Then that inquisitive snout made its way up his arm, to the juncture of his neck and shoulder. He pushed his way out of Tony’s grip and stretched up to sniff at Tony’s hair. Oddly enough, Tony felt the urge to lean into it.
“Fantastic. Allow me to take it into my grasp and examine it,” Thor replied. Tony blinked as a rush of wind surrounded them, then blinked again as Thor stood before him with the vial in hand. How did he do that? Tony wondered. Did he learn how to bend air while he was away?
"You're an idiot, Rogers," he grumbled as Steve continued to inch them further away from the scene of the incident. "Do you know who that man is?"
As soon as steel touched the ground, Steve was swarmed by men dressed head to toe in tactical military gear. One man held him still by the shoulders as another wrenched Steve's hands behind his back and slapped a pair of cuffs around both wrists. Two other soldiers stood on either side, guns pointed steadily at his chest. Two more men stood further down the hall, flanking the elevator that led down to the ground floor. At the midway point, Fury stood in his typical all black attire, expression blank. To anyone unfamiliar with him, the director looked unbothered. But Steve had experience enough with the minuscule twitch of the man's jaw to know better. Fury would probably let him sit in the facility for a few days out of spite.
"We do," Steve agreed. The smile on Tony's face was worth the sharp jolt of discomfort when his new keeper tugged him in the opposite direction.
"Thank you for coming to my rescue, Tony Stark."
Once Tony took off his headband and slipped out of his fuzzy socks, they fell into bed together with a satisfied sigh. Tony nuzzled his way under Steve's arm, wiggling around until he found the perfect spot. Steve obliged, dropping a kiss to the crown of Tony's head once the other man settled.
