Dean draws in smoke but can't help the comment, "Well this one is aging like fine wine." Amusement radiates beside him and he rolls his eyes. "Just because I don't drink it, don't mean I can't appreciate it."
"Yeah, well." Without a good excuse, his brother pushes back from the table, disturbing all their findings and strolls out. He wants to shout that it's not safe but honestly, he has no proof to support that. Shaking his head, he leafs through their journal as a lighter clicks outside. The smell of smoke drifts in and combined with the mist, he wonders when he'll get a gulp of pure air again.
"This wasn't enough?" Claire laughs, pointing her drink around at the unwrapped presents and cake claiming she was having a,
Dad grunts in consideration. "That plan will work if everyone stays in the hall. If one person leaves, it could possess their body and move out of the shadows.” And then it’d head straight for the people controlling the lights, Sammy.
Cas nods understandingly, seemingly in a similar situation and suddenly he wishes states weren't separating them, so they could share the sunset settling on his angels' features. His fingers flick aggressively at the ash, seeing his smile tilt into something softer.
"Look, hey. The interval's probably over by now, so no slacking. Otherwise that goth girl might have her own machete." Deans' split lip quirks up and so does Sams'.
Machete tucked in his jacket, he bursts into the booth filled with stagelight switches, Sammy laughing over shared sweets with his friend. He turns around at Dean’s abrupt entrance and it breaks his damn heart to see his brothers’ confusion morph into anger and then awful acceptance, reaching down to get his bag.
"Not that bad?" Dean doubts, shoving a jumper into his arms as he steadies a lopsided seat. "Did you see those roads? No, you didn't, because it's like
Sam gives up writing, his pen scrawling as grit rattles their tyres. They had veered off the main road when Deans' stomach started speaking, rumbling down an endless stretch of sand.
"Sorry," Dean smiles apologetically, detaching themselves from this busybody. "We haven't seen anyone."
Peering down into the hall, Sam spots two figures hurrying back to their seats - that's the guy he'd seen hanging around Dean. His eyes kept flicking to the door, distracted and worried. He'd seen the monster, meaning his brother was in trouble.
Sam nods, like he'd been expecting that. "Bernadettes' injuries happened when she hit the mirror her husband had been taken through. That thing stepped out instead." He tugs the thread. "So, I reckon we free them by breaking the mirrors."
"The fires are why you came, right?" Gunner asks, voice low in confiding. "Well, I got something to tell you. Daryn believes I put out those flames, but the house was ablaze. I saw him passed out and thought it was too late."
Disposing the last bloody and bleached tissues, tying up the black bag, throwing it into the trash outside - Dean stops as the mounting pressure finally spills over. "Fuck." He whispers into the bins. "Fuck,
He leans against the column with it’s lone lamp and rapidly inhales, nerves shaking his chest. He’d never forgive himself if this thing got hold of him and made him hurt Sammy. Whistling in air, he sees someone pacing idly between the shadows.
"Someone put a hit out on us." He realises. "Fake us, anyway." From the corner of his eye, he sees Sam lean almost nose to nose with the thing, condensation on the inside of the mirror where the creature pants.
Alright, nothing freaky going on. He convinces himself, letting go of the mossy handrail and stepping off the last step into the sinking mud. It's impossible not to make noise, but he tries, following the trail carefully around the shelves.
Gunner grins, leaning back on the sunny sliding of his house. "You said that to me before you left. I thought it then and I think it now - when a blood covered boy holding a machete tells you to have a nice life, you get one, because you're scared to become him."
Eventually the gleam dims although the touch lingers, a flash of unholy blue in his pupils. "It's worth it." Cas promises, skimming his shoulder where a healed inked enochian symbol settled over an old handprint scar.
"Never." He leans down to smack her forehead with a kiss but groans about his shoulder like an old man. It doesn't get any sympathy from her, knowing it had long healed from the bullet, but Cas crosses the crowded room to lay a hand on him.
"It's rude to take back gifts." She grins, verging on a cackle as her thunderous father curses the other for teaching her manners. She plays keep-away with it all the way back to the kitchen, until Eileen trips her and it devolves into a wrestling match.
The bite slackens but fighting back seems to excite it, scrabbling for another attack as Dean heaves away from the sinking mud.
The thunderous feat of nature pelts down precarious rockside, plunging into a vast lake surrounded by viridian pines, swaying boats upon the surface. Beneath their tires, twigs and leaves crunch consistently, a welcoming chorus as they roll up to their rental house.
. "Do you want to build a new home? Y'know, in there." He taps a finger to a suited chest, receiving a fond look.
Turning, he leans back on the map table, not enough energy to restrain himself from checking Cas over. Dark scruff had grown in, just a few weeks without shaving made his shadow more permanent. Curls of black hair around his ears where it was growing out, that his fingers twitch to tangle in. He leaves the best for last, letting himself be anointed by adoring blue eyes.
Daryn drifts his fingers over the frame, head tilting softly in remembrance. "This was the Clayton House in Scottsdale… oh, everyone was stunning that day." Sam stops when the glossy image filled with floating lights and an arch of flowers slides under his gaze. It beams, each catch of light shining on another person's smile. "That's all my side and then of course, Gunners' sisters there." His finger taps two smiling faces, one who's black hair curled into a bun and the other who's blonde curls fell forwards.
"No, it always feels a cough away from annihilation in here." She huffs, pointing down to the stage where Scarlet was reading her lines. "The hexes are for her."
"I'm never going to need this." He sighs defeatedly to his brother, who's scooping another serving of instant mac into his bowl.
They must be the hottest thing on the menu, because it will not look away. People at the library pass by without even a shiver at the thing staring straight at them. Any of these same people, could be the one who didn't like the Winchesters sniffing around, who wanted them dead.
He shudders into the backseat, staring at the shadow of Dad as it silhouettes the streaking rain outside.
"No, just muddy." Sam says, ditching him in the backseat and the delayed realisation he'd be getting mud all over Baby makes him groan. "Where did it get you?" He asks, unzipping the first aid kit and pulling out a threaded needle with its driver.
"A woman, unburned by the flames." Daryn whispers, clinching his gown tighter to him. "I swear, she was blocking my escape." He grows more animated, pointing to where she supposedly appeared, not a foot from them. "It's only when my husband arrived that the fire stopped."
. The white plastic bag on his lap even felt familiar, but he sure as shit knows he's never bought anything from a store that pricey.
to be better than down here. She gasps by his ear, sluggish movements speeding up, a frantic shout as her shoulder slams against the door.
"I think you're going to get me more coffee." Dean grunts, shoving the empty into his hands. "And, I think I'm going to say goodbye to Cas."
Dean glances to him, thumbing the matches. "Sometimes parents need secrets man, things the kid can't know to protect them."
Movement in the corner of the reflection spins him around. Shining light on a still body, blood dried and caked onto her forehead, disorientated brown eyes squinting against him. Shit.
"It's Mr Dunnel nowadays." He corrects, taking a steadying burgundy sip. The name swills in his brain, circling around a plug hole. "Call me Daryn. I suppose you're here about the attack?" He asks, stepping into his house.
So what, he's going to be somebody's secret again. Just because this has been one of his better catches didn't mean he got to hold on. He struggles in the silence, knowing he can't keep him hooked forever.
His shoulder spasms and he drops the surrender, to concerned shouts down below. These new recruits for his brothers' network weren't exactly Einsteins.
"Who's asking?" Dean demands, barbed wire covering every syllable. The man outside launches a tirade about not meeting their payments, his brother brushing him off, fighting him on it but eventually slams the door shut in aggravation.
Dean curls a smile at that, flecks of blood on his cheek. "Probably for the best." He agrees and watches him push a hand through his hair in disbelief. He shifts on the spot. "Look, Sam and I aren't hanging around, we're leaving tonight."
The memory comes back like a jolt of electricity, shuttering on a distant past. "I think I knew her." Daryn turns now to him, hands clasped in delight, as the faded scenes return. "And her cousin, Scarlet, I used to go to
, no, instead he's in some state charming the shit out of hunters he'd never met, who wouldn't think twice about making an angel a prized possession.
"Not ringing any bells here." Dean answers distractedly, turning into the diner of the day and parking under a patch of shade.
Sam tests fading pens, while they wait in reception chairs, confused school admins hunting for their classes. When the teacher talks animatedly about their 'new student' he waves, to no one in particular. Another wash of faces for his mind to forget, footprints in the sand.
Gunners' eyes crinkle with crowfeet, somehow sad. "You're a very hard man to forget." His tone turns more jovial, hooking his thumb at the Impala prominently gleaming black on a beige yard. "And so is that car."
The low visibility suddenly raises in threat, threading through the trees beyond the thin panel windows in the kitchen. "It's the fog?"
"Oh, hi." His pen hovers, unsure how to explain himself. "These are runes right? It's just my brothers big into… witch stuff." He doesn't feel bad about throwing Dean under the bus for this one. "This rune means 'burning'. Were you trying to hex the room?"
They don't have food money but Dean crinkles a bag from an expensive shop on the other side of town, trying to hide it before he can see. The buzzing motel sign and occasional shouts fill the space between their words, scarfing down their stolen goods.
Before he can convince himself not to, he flicks off the overhead so only distant lights leave slivers of outlines around them. He tilts his chin up and Gunner meets him halfway, in a bruising kiss. Concern, loss, fear tangles with fond, lust, care.
Pleasant heat from the sun settles on his skin as they walk, wind wisping sand grains off the ground to drift along. There's something achingly familiar about this expansive desert plain, the ridge and start of shrubbery in the distance, but he can't place it.
Sam slings his canvas bag over one shoulder, leaning down to listen to an excited Eileen over a detailed run-down of the hunting networks' progress. He holds her hand, almost as an after thought.
"Beautiful venue - is it around here?" Sam asks about a wedding picture on the shelf, investigating by sight for bags of bones or strange markings.
It was a long game, involving many hands, where Dean had to keep track of their points. Jack confessed that his father was typically in charge of this task, as well as shuffling the cards. And while Dean was more than happy to help, it wasn’t without his notice that Jack was still doing very well for his age. In fact, he had to admit that even if it was his first time playing the game, that six-year-old freaking owned him.
There was another short pause and Sam said, “Cas? Why do you ask?” Castiel swallowed, weighing on what to say. “Cas?”
They both sat at the edge of the bed. After a series of sweet kisses, Dean’s mouth slowly ventured down Castiel’s neck. His chest. His stomach. And just as Dean was moving his head towards Castiel’s cock, he was stopped midway when Castiel, smirking at him, gently leaned Dean’s head upwards and kissed him on his chin.
Dean watched them cross the street and once he was positive that they were no longer paying attention to him, he quickened his pace as he continued his route.
Dean, evidently reflecting on the matter, had hesitated with his answer. Almost as if he had been tempted by the offer. But he said, “I—I’ll be fine.”
“Because, what if I tell you that… look, I wouldn’t give up just yet, Cas. You may think his mind is on someone else, but you might be surprised.”
While Dean quickly inspected the cabin to make sure everything was in order, Castiel did as Dean had suggested and took a seat at the table. He then noticed a note on the table.
If you’re reading this, it means that I am no longer with you and your brother. I am so sorry that I had to leave you.
“You mean the fact that we are hunting down people to be put back in cryo sleep, which we now know is a lot more complicated than a long nap? Or that we are literally doing their leg work even though we didn’t do anything?”
They watched in horror the house burning away, as responders and concerned neighbors were attempting to put out the fire.
It turned out that while everyone had kept their hands to themselves, so-to-speak, Bela had nonetheless took the opportunity to let Sam know of her availability. And interest.
Even though Dean had a lot to say about the fact that Samuel was already keeping Sam at the shop far too late for his taste, he bit his lips hard and decided to change the subject.
Castiel bit on his lip and repositioned himself, looking straight ahead. And before he could stop himself, he said, “Dean, did you mean it? What you said on the day we met, about you—about the engagement rings? I’m sure you were just teasing, but were you serious?”
His hand over his own heart, Castiel fell silent, lost in thoughts for a brief moment, until he finally said, “I don’t feel it. This emptiness. I—I don’t think I can explain it into words. But it was like this overwhelming feeling that I had to constantly fight against until it was too tiresome and I had to return. I'm tired, but not...That’s gone. I don’t sense it anymore. So maybe…”
Sam wasn’t sure if her silence on the matter was a good thing or not. On the one hand, as far as he knew, she had been one of the rare people of the office to not spread any stories, which Sam appreciated greatly.
While Sam would have loved nothing more than to get lost in that moment forever, he knew that he had to let go of Gabriel and step away as far as possible from this window or he would get in even bigger trouble than he most likely already was.
So close to the victory they could almost taste it, they grew more anxious as they neared the deadline. Which was why they opted to hit the pause button on their relationship.
“And you made sure I knew exactly where to find you.” Castiel retrieved something from his pocket and showed it to Dean.
Castiel laughed. “You’re in need of a place to stay and Kali, of all people, finds herself on her own and you suggested to throw a party?”
“And I’m super aware,” he continued, cutting him off, “that this says much more about me than it says about you.” He lowered his eyes a moment. “As you might have noticed, I have a thing about lying. And when—I just assumed the worse. That you were—because that’s been my general experience so far when it comes to lying. But I should have given you the benefit of the doubt. And as for why you didn’t tell me the truth right away, I get why you did it. I’m—I’m just sorry that you felt like you had to do that to feel comfortable, and I feel even worse that I apparently proved your point.”
Then with a wave of Godstiel’s hand, one of the curse boxes manifested itself in Deanmon’s possession.
Becky immediately volunteered to give the grand tour to the hunters and the Ghostfacers, as well as to clarify the situation for those who needed it. Chuck and Sam hesitated on that idea, but before either of them could voice their uncertainty, she had already left the table and headed towards the merchandise booths at an impressive speed, calling for their attention.
, whatever it is you are referring to, I think it would be wise to hear what your kind visitor has to say.” And he tapped sympathetically on his shoulder, only to then nudge him away from the cash register.
He had tried his best to read the book he had picked at random, but his mind often wondered with apprehension at the evening to come. Social gatherings such as these made him nervous, even more so when there were expectations attached to it.
No, he was quiet and seemingly trapped in his own mind, evidently mulling things over by himself, and Sam wasn’t sure it was an improvement.
On the bed next to his, Sam was still sound asleep, looking exactly how Dean had found him on his return.
Castiel gasped. This house was impressive. It wasn’t overdone and it didn’t look out of place. It had a rustic, comfortable vibe, with large stone and warm wood. But this was in no way a
As though Samuel was following his thought process, he then said, “You were right about it happening shortly after you and Sam arrived here. It was weeks after you got here. Not even a month after that. I never could decide if that was a weird upside to this.” Dean frowned at him again, completely lost. “I’m not saying it didn’t faze you, but you had a lot on your mind already. Your plate was full and there was no room for anything else at that point.”
“There is only one person except you that I’d consider doing that with, for different intentions, of course, and that person isn’t here,” he said, looking at the ground.
Although Dean was still wearing his sweat pants, its thin material didn’t leave much to the imagination, thought Castiel, as he felt Dean’s erection press against his every time Dean made the slightest of movements.
At an expeditious pace, Dean and Castiel reached the Wings Storage Facility, about twenty minutes later.
Not knowing what else to do, he stood up and said, “I think I need to lie down for a while. I—I need to think. And sleep. I don’t know.”
But before he could request that they discuss the matter in the morning again, Dean said, “I thought we were—I thought we were getting along.”
Castiel turned his head and saw his sister, Anna, sitting next to him. He stared at her in disbelief, not moving a muscle. Her hair was still of a bright red color, but much longer than since he had last seen her. With the exception of a line or two around her eyes, and her grown-up attire, she looked exactly the same.
And he was filled with a mixture of peace and excitement when Castiel wrapped his arms around him, deepening the kiss by gluing himself to him, as they rose higher.
Taking hold of his arm, Castiel pulled Dean upwards and started to rock into him. Holding him tightly by his torso, feeling his warm sweat, he teethed his neck. Dean attempted to keep up with him, but once Castiel quickened the pace, Dean clutched on to Castiel’s arm and let Castiel do whatever he wanted.
“I’m not sure about that,” he said in all honesty. And then he smiled, and said, “That’s certainly what Kelly wanted though. For me to—anyway.”
Dean swore as they anxiously glanced around them for any potential threat. They reluctantly joined the applauding crowd and listened to that asshole’s speech.
Dean swallowed. He pulled Castiel towards him by his shirt, rested one hand on his cheek, grazing the corner of his mouth gently with his thumb, and after a short hesitation, they kissed again. Castiel slightly opened his mouth and Dean took the initiative to slide in a bit of tongue. Dean heard himself moan, as he tasted Castiel’s tongue. It was sweet, like peach, from a drink he must have had earlier, no doubt.
While that might have been the truth, the fact remained that Castiel was still staring blankly at his kitchen window, unable to not think about said kiss. Done innocently or not, out of tradition or not, and harboring platonic feelings for Dean
Unlike during his last visit, Castiel hadn’t changed his clothes yet. And while the sight of him in his pajama pants, with a neat house coat exposing his bare chest, had been burned into Dean’s mind forever, his current attire wasn’t anything to be upset about, either.
They ate their breakfast, but not in a hurry. Dean had already prepared most of what they needed for their mysterious trip, and as they ate their pancakes, he gave Castiel pointers for packing.
And before they both left the bar, Deanmon twirled his blade and smiled, as he felt a rush spreading in his chest.
Dean nodded with a smile, but it soon disappeared when he noticed Castiel’s confused look. “I thought it would be nice.”
His sole comfort, save perhaps his very brief conversation with Dean, had been Gabriel’s daily texts. Which always made him smile.
“I’m sorry too,” said Dean, looking downwards again. “You didn’t lose it. Everything you said was true. And you have every right to be upset. Fuck, I’m upset for you. I’m the one who went way overboard yesterday when—” he stopped, shifting on his feet. “And then last night—I don’t know—I’m sorry for my behavior last night.”
“But that was a while ago,” she continued, ignoring his last comment. “I know he has new investors, and given he’s confortable enough to leave the ranch, that might mean a good thing, no?”
“I mean the supervisor of each and every one of you. The one person who is charge and can do something.”
I’ll begin by explaining the package I’ve sent you. After you mentioned your fall in your last letter, I decided to finally inquire of my peers something to aid your comfort with your leg. Many had interesting takes on it, but after consideration, given your circumstances, your best bet is to mix an herb blend and oils in your bathwater, as well as to drink one cup of a particular blend of tea leaves, preferably before sleep. I took the liberty to send it all to you, and was assured by Mr. Davies that it should last you the month. I’ve included the instructions, and with hope that it will benefit you, I’m already putting together the package for next month. I can picture you shaking your head in stubbornness and telling me that this was unnecessary, but I am stubborn too. I don’t see the point of you enduring discomfort when a simple remedy could help. So, please, if not for you, try it for me this month, and honestly let me know if it helped.
But Dean held it. Like in a fucking tormenting way, as he moaned, panted, and shuddered under Castiel’s touch, but he kept himself in check. His cock was hard again, and he was determined to not repeat what had happened earlier.
Dean let out a laugh. “No, we don’t.” They were facing each other again and Dean rested his hand on his chest, smiling brightly. “We don’t even need to decide right away.”
Which had been why Dean, wanting to do the same on his end, had taken the liberty to look under the hood and do other quick check-ups every time he picked up the vehicle. Not that he doubted its condition, but the last thing he wanted was to blindly drive a broken car, however stunning it was. But Dean never found an issue. The brakes worked to perfection, the engine never stalled, and even the radio was on point.
. And they kept parking in my parking spot. Another one moved out across the country, with my television and I—I swear it was like I was cursed. No matter how careful and thorough I was in the selection, it just—I felt like an idiot.”
had been detectable years before he had made this forsaken cup of tea. Not only by him, but by the other Hunters, as well. Surely, that counted for something.
When Sam had returned to the library, he let himself drop on the closest armchair out of exhaustion, and Jack and Rowena let him doze off as they continued working.
“Right. Well, about that,” said Gabriel, letting out a short laugh, “I have good news and bad news. The good news is that I know Crowley and his location.”
“Cas is a friend, Sam. I promise he won’t hurt you. No one is ever fucking going to hurt you. I’m—I’m so sorry this happened,” said Dean, feeling his voice breaking. “I’m sorry. That was my fault. I was supposed to protect you and I—I can’t believe I let this happen….”
“Partial luck. I know a lot of the pilots and the airport staff. I asked some of them to be on the lookout. I was trying to reach you before you left. Since everything was overbooked, at first, I thought I’d have a shot. And just as I was about to leave, Benny informed me of a last-minute passenger. So, I begged him to wait for me. I grabbed my suitcase—I always have one ready. Old habit. And I immediately called Donna to let her know of the situation. I was already planning on coming here this weekend but not the whole—just the weekend. And I knew she was supposed to leave that morning, bu—anyway. And then, I just…showed up at the airport and there you were.”
After a long series of burning kisses, they took a moment to catch their breaths. Dean pulled on the sheets and blankets to cover themselves up, which inadvertently made the bed squeak once more.
Thus, in addition to coming to work one hour earlier than usual (to compensate for his tricky schedule of December), he would now also stay another hour on the days he could manage to catch up.
Dean wasn’t stupid. He glared at Castiel a little more, shook his head and turned his attention back to the lawless city unfolding in front of them. He let the matter drop.
“I probably should,” he said grimly. “I certainly will have to at some point to explain things.” He lifted his eyes to meet Dean’s. “It’s Hannah,” he explained.
It wasn’t until very late in the night, when the grim daylight had already vanished, that Castiel abruptly stood up from his chair and kept still.
“I overheard her mentioning it to one of her friends when they passed by my locker,” said Dean, after helping himself with a big bite of his sandwich.
“Thank you,” he mumbled. But despite being famished, Dean froze, utensils in hands, and simply stared at his plate.
To the point where Dean wondered if he had said anything wrong. Or had misread their previous afternoon.
“Okay, okay. You don’t have to. But Cas, Gabriel is right. Please, you have to tell us where you are. You have to come back home with us. You can’t stay outside and alone, okay?”
“That’s true. But Jack mentioned that you celebrated the holiday the other day with Mrs. Butters. We were discussing the concept of Christmas and that got me thinking. I realized that I had never taken part in the tradition before. So, I thought of changing that even if I missed the celebration the other day.”
After a few pictures with a few confused fans, Castiel left Gabriel’s company and headed towards the parking lot when he overheard a group mentioning a “collection of Impalas.”
Castiel, gazing out the window, said, “No. But they wouldn’t approach me about this sort of thing. They know it’s pointless. Which was why I wondered.”
Lunchtime was still a couple of hours away, but it would get here fast and Castiel deduced it may be less noisy in a coffee shop than in a pub.
Not sure what Castiel meant by that, Dean was about to ask additional questions, but Castiel then said, “I feel uncomfortable having that car now.”
That being said, Dean also knew that, sooner or later, he ought to have another conversation with Castiel.
“Your very kind neighbour stopped by,” Daphne said, as she stood up to get Castiel a plate and signaled him to take a seat.
“I wanted to help you,” she said. “I could see you were getting desperate to find a new roommate, so I made flyers and left a bunch in your neighborhood. It was old school and perhaps less effective than an online ad, but I thought if I left them in places that had good vibes, maybe the people responding to them would be better too. And that bookstore was on top of my list.”
“I know how this sounds. It’s nuts. But I’m desperate. You would literally save my life. And the workers too.”
“Oh right, I forgot. You mean the part where you’ll be chilling on an awesome ranch, surrounded by money, with your husband? I repeat, why the hell are you not saying ‘yes’ to this?”
And Dean could sit there and mull it over as long as he wanted, he would never find a solution as efficient—and without grave repercussion—as what Zachariah was offering him.
“I had to be a creep and check from your other footwear. It was that or bringing you directly to the store, but then it wouldn’t have been a surprise. Though, that way you could have chosen the pair yourself. So there was that option.”
“Okay, um, thank you. I’ll keep that in mind. Do you want to wait for Dean or should I just tell him to call you back?”
And while his day turned out to be rather uneventful, as he spent it skimming through the old journals, Dean was surprised how quickly it flew by.
“Likewise.” There was a moment of silence, during which they simply stared at each other, until Castiel spoke again. “I meant to thank you. People keep showing up at the clinic on your recommendation. The Loughlin and the Chambers even called this afternoon requesting an appointment with me and no one else.”
But Dean lifted his hand up and pledged, “I promise.” His stare turned serious, though not grim—far from it—and he still conveyed the same adoring expression. “I just said we’d take things slow. I meant it. So, I promise.”
Castiel hoisted him on his waist, ceasing his tickles and looked at him, faking a serious stern. “Hmmm. I guess I’ll have to take your word for it.”
“Sammy!” he yelled as best as he could, once he had spotted him inert on the other side of the room.
“Yes, right. You stay here and man the front desk, and I’ll see what I can do. What seemed to be the problem?”
And since Castiel wasn’t doing anything to stop him, that was when Dean had had enough and stepped in.
“Of course. It’s Christmas,” said Dean, taking off his boots. “I got you and your Dad a little something.”
And now, it’s too late. I miss them more than I ever thought I could miss someone and I don’t know what to do to change that.
“And then you were nice enough to offer us presents, which you really didn’t have to. So, I—we thought we could have another go at it. With you this time.”
The point I was trying to make is that Castiel was clearly desperate to reassure Dean that no one, even him, would bring him any harm.
Dean took a deep breath. “I just haven’t been feeling it these days. I guess that the new job is taking its toll on me way more than I’d like to admit even if I work a little bit less.”
A short hallway led to a cozy bedroom, right next to the bathroom and compact “laundry room,” accessible via a sliding door.
And while he had found some form of comfort in his friends’ words, Castiel still felt incredibly confused on how to proceed from that point on.
“I—if I know them like I think I do, Gordon or not, they probably would have made you that offer no matter what. They were just waiting for the right time.”
Dean took a deep breath. His voice was wavering and his eyes were turning red, and all Castiel could do was to stand still and let him finish.
Well, let’s just say for now that he’s been there before and he didn’t really plan on repeating the experience.
“The usual stuff you bring with you on a trip. But don’t over do it. We’re good. And comfy clothes. And warm, too.”
“Awesome. Now that that’s out of the way,” said Dean, obscuring Patrick’s view of Castiel, as he practically stepped in front of him, “mind telling us what the deal is here? Can you really do it? Can you bring our Mom back or are you just screwing with us?”
“And you could stay,” said Dean softly. He glanced at Castiel. “With the threat gone, and if Michael doesn’t—like you said—”
“No, I thought you—I don’t know. That’s not what I was expecting. I—I don’t know why, but I’m just surprised. But that’s cool. So tea, huh? How did you get into that?”
“I’m aware you guys were here this morning,” said Gabriel. “It’s as if I have trapped you in a time loop on this wonderful Tuesday.” He turned to Sam and winked at him. “My apologies, Sam.”
“Terrific.” Zachariah, leaving his spot by the window, picked up the phone, turned it on for a second, just to make sure it was still operational, and shoved it into one of his desk drawers.
“There’s actually a story behind it,” said Dean after putting down Jack. “Sam made it when we were kids.”
“What about the people working on the ranch then? Can you tell me about them? I’ll have to catch up with everybody’s names quickly I suppose.”
. We should be fine. It’s not like anyone saw us step out of the Mustang, but given that the streets aren’t exactly crowded at the moment, I feel like we’re neon signs.”
So, it turned out that being over cautious had paid off because the unfinished potion had remained untouched on the shelf.
“Sorry. I forgot. Habit, I suppose—I just did it without thinking.” He let out a faint laugh. But Dean wasn’t laughing, so Castiel sat up and pushed off the covers. “I’m sorry, I just find this funny for some reason.”
“Sam, no. I—I suck. I’m so sorry about that. Well, I’m sorry about a lot of things, but I’m really sorry about that. I’ve been…preoccupied with—I’ve been very bad at managing everything at once. I feel terrible that you thought I didn’t care or—the point is that I’ll try to do better. And in return, don’t be shy to tell me if I mess up again, okay? I’m hoping I won’t, but you know? And a driving test! I can’t believe we’re here! This is awesome! Are you looking forward to it?”
And even though he could clearly see that Sam was still wearing pajamas, his brain could only focus on the fact that someone’s arm was resting comfortably across Sam’s chest.
“Okay,” Balthazar stopped him. “So, basically, everything you just said about Dean, that’s something you’re seeking for yourself. It’s what you want.”
But he was granted a surprise on the morning of Christmas Eve. He woke up alone in bed, as had been the case for the last few weeks. He got up, put on thick slippers (because the floor had gotten really cold) and a housecoat that Dean had lent him, and dragged his feet to the kitchen nearly upset at eating his breakfast on his own again.
But despite the jolly vibe in the air and the numerous children present, Dean hadn’t been too keen on exploring on his own.
Castiel hesitated a moment, and then, unable to stop himself, he just stepped outside and went down his porch, towards Dean’s house.
“I did what I came here to do,” he said, pointing at the First Blade, resting on the counter, next the second curse box and a small pouch. “And then, I felt like celebrating,” he continued, pouring himself a drink. “I was ready to give the performance of a lifetime, but one thing led to another and people got really carried away.”
“That’s fine,” said Samuel. “You can come anytime after the four days. Or have someone else pick it up for you. As long as they have the receipt, there’s no issue there.”
He waited patiently, returned smiles to the customers who saluted him in the same fashion, and was grateful that someone had managed to change the music playing all over the store. Though, he was sure that it would only be a short respite.
in the morning. Which Castiel thought was interesting as it was the only time Dean ever cooked breakfast. Lunches, snacks, or dinners? Sure. But breakfast? A strong black coffee was usually the way to start the day for Dean.
Castiel brought his hand to his face, so gently, almost as though he was expecting Dean to lean back.
And soon, Castiel felt Dean’s hand move up to the back of his neck. When fingers fondling his hair in the most soothing, adoring way, Castiel felt tingles on his lower back, and tightened his embrace of Dean.
“I’m sorry. It was,” she said, biting her lip. “But then something came up. One of my friends wanted to hang out this afternoon, and you never said exactly when you’d be here, so she came by. It was only supposed to be in the meantime, but then another of my friends had some drama to relay, and well…” She gestured at her group of friends. “I know I should have told you, but I really wanted to see you. You are obviously off the hook for the rain check. You kept your word. I’m the one who owes you one now.”
Sam took a moment to ponder on Gabriel’s invitation, but his response remained the same as the last time.
Unknown: Hey. Ephraim, here, to put you out of your misery. Gabe told me you were looking for another place to stay because you have a problem with your roommate?
“So I have your confirmation, then? I know how Cas feels and I always suspected it was the same with Dean.”
“No. Few times a week at the most. Nearly always at night. Irregular schedule, however. We will let you know in advance, don’t worry. But if you accept, I’d keep my evenings open just in case.”
And when Sam arrived from school, the only thing Dean mastered to do was nod and mumble monosyllabic words.
Dean, staring at him, shook his head slowly. “Only when it happened.” And then something occurred to him. “Did you—after the branding, did you help me? Like you had done when I was attacked?”
But given the company and that his mother insisted on him staying within her sight, he knew he most likely wouldn’t be able to do so until the baking was done.
“They don’t even care. They—I swear I’m going to rip out the lungs of everyone who had anything to do with this,” said Dean, his voice wavering.
Castiel knew that was true, and yet, he couldn’t help thinking there must be more to the story than this.
Aggravated, Castiel nonetheless sat on the free armchair, while Dean sat at the edge of the other one, making sure to not damage the painting.
Castiel: How the hell am I supposed to deal with being casual when I can barely handle what’s happening right now?
But as his hands began to wander over Castiel’s shirt, exploring his biceps, chest and lower abdomen, Dean’s kisses deepened.
Soon, Castiel was swirling his tongue on Dean’s throat, and Dean tried to delicately nudge Castiel onto his back, with his other hand easing up his thigh, close to his cock.
“Aside from piggy backing on our lives, you mean,” said Dean. “Which we’re totally gonna have a discussion about.”
“But—it would have to be someone incredibly powerful in order to shield him from you,” said Castiel.
Both relieved that they had convinced Jack that there wasn’t any bad blood between them, Castiel and Dean locked eyes again.
But the thing was that we just needed to keep him occupied long enough, until Venandi and the brigade of good righteous troop showed up.
I was just surprised to hear it from Sam. But know that you can tell me anything. And I really mean anything, even if it’s awkward.
As Samuel was expected to start his position in Sioux Falls in the last week of the month, they hadn’t delayed with the process of the moving. So, for the next two weeks, Dean had kept busy with packing and the closure of the store.
“Fuck, I don’t know, Cas. Anything. That’s the point of those. You don’t really have to over think it. It depends on the person. Their vibe. You can just compliment them on something. How physically attractive they are or—”
He finally reached the house, burst through the door, and saw Hannah waiting for him in the living room, observing the mantel of the giant fireplace.
So, he told Castiel to use the ornaments and other decorations as he saw fit, even if they would have to make do without a tree.
“Know-it-all.” And then he added, lowering the tone of his voice even more, “At least they aren’t killer clowns, huh, Sammy?”
Sam and Gabriel had cozily sunk themselves into the couch, their feet rested on the coffee table (with Sam’s feet nearly sticking off the other end of it), and Gabriel’s head was partially resting against Sam’s shoulder.
He rested his uninjured hand softly on Dean’s cheek. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, which made Dean’s heartbeat increase.
“The thing is, technically speaking, right now, you do own the place, Cas. As long as you’re married to Dean, you are.” Then she rolled her eyes, and added, “Not like—you know what I mean. And I know you weren’t going all power trip on us.” She leaned in closer, whispering, “You gave him what he wanted: an owner.
It is unfortunate to say, however, that Castiel’s good fortune ended there, as the issues began piling up one after the other.
In the attempt of getting rid of it, Castiel had taken it upon himself to explore a series of new activities and hobbies, from learning a new language to taking kick-boxing classes, thinking one of them would do the trick.
He hoped that people wouldn’t judge his last-minute costume too harshly. Castiel had questioned Dean about it during dinner a few days before Halloween.
His jeans were getting extremely uncomfortable and he heard himself moan when Castiel continued fondling his hair.
The truth was that he genuinely liked Dean. And while the circumstances in which they met were less than ideal, he had enjoyed his time with him so far.
, to be more exact. Not necessarily because of the sense of duty, or praise the heroes got. It was about saving people. The compassion attached to it. I always appreciated and admired people like that. That’s—that’s why I always liked
“Anyways,” continued Dean, “I called him this afternoon after you mentioned he had tried to reach me and he insisted on stopping by to chat in person.”
Sam, thanking Samuel and granting him a hug, had clearly been pleased by his grandfather’s gesture. And when Dean and Samuel looked at each other, Dean gave him a kind nod, showing him his appreciation for his effort.
Feeling his heart racing, Castiel reached the rim of Dean’s underwear. Just like he had done earlier, he licked Dean’s cock over his underwear. He slowly spread Dean’s legs once his tongue reached his balls, and wrapped his mouth around them, sucking through the material.
But Castiel put one hand on his chest keeping him still. Just as Dean had done, he took a moment to fully take in Dean in all his glory.
Like the idiots that they are, they were armed, psyching themselves up, two stupid seconds away from slapping each other, and then charged in, bracing themselves for some really disturbing stuff.
“Look, I—just between you and me, I know we will probably fail. This is…too big. Last year was insane and we all know what happened. Even if we find the Colt, even if you or someone else that’s got the juice help us, we still have to go against heaven and hell. So, yeah, it feels impossible. Probably because it is.”
Dean felt his stomach drop at the idea that Castiel could have injured himself. After a moment of reflection, however, which was followed by a shy glance at his parents, he then shook his head once more.
“I believe every opportunity is subject to a learning experience, sir. Even if it doesn’t appear so at first.”
“You tell him,” said Dean, finally picking up his drink, exasperated. “I fucking can’t with all of this."
Dean seemed busy speaking with Aaron and Tasha, while Donna was talking with animation to Sam and Jessica right next to them.
But I'm back now! No more deadlines on the horizon lol, so I'm back to post on a weekly (ish) basis.
His break being over, he thanked his friends for the chat and informed them that he would get back to them later on.
They heard a few trinkets hit the ground at the brisk movement, as they both tried to regain their balance.
Castiel let out a laugh. “Yes. I mean, not here. I’m usually the one who sleeps-over.” He paused a moment. “Not that I actually sleepov—I mean, I do, but not—”
“I don’t think the key codes will be an issue. We simply have to meet Crowley’s contact at the rendezvous.”
At the beginning of the second hour of their evening, they found themselves in a small, yet charming, clothing store. Not really what Dean had intended on shopping for, but he followed Castiel through the store all the same.
And as he was about to call Gabriel to tell him the rest of his message, Sam was then hit with another idea.
Dean nodded, lifting his eyebrow. “Yes. Yes, you did.” He wasn’t smiling, but Castiel could tell he was trying to fight it.
When they arrived at said museum, Dean was pleasantly surprised by the fact that Sam appeared to be acquainted with the pretty blond who was wearing a volunteer badge. Sam awkwardly waved at her, as she stepped into the gift shop.
But then again, it wasn’t without his notice, that Sam was the embodiment of a man of a few words. And oddly enough, the more Gabriel was speaking to him, the quieter Sam seemed to get.
Convinced that it was simply a mild adjustment to deal with, Castiel did his best to power through it and keep it to himself.
With this in mind, Sam politely requested Patrick to give them a moment to discuss the matter between themselves, and they slowly moved closer to the entrance for a bit of privacy.
They had taken a lot of pictures during their months together. Most of it had just been for fun memories.
Castiel sat next to him and they remained silent, side by side, in that fashion for quite some time.
“Of course. I can’t force you. And I—I don’t know if you can. But I hope so. And I think we all deserve a fresh start.”
Castiel took a deep breath trying to think of something fast. “Dean, I can’t—I cannot say with absolute certainty what I’ll do after, but—but that doesn’t mean that—the point is, I don’t know yet. And if I don’t know, it means you don’t either.”
Gabriel opened his mouth, ready to blurt out the answer, but he then shut it quickly, not uttering a sound. A mischievous smile appeared on his face as Gabriel was then inspired by an idea. “Maybe I should let you guess.”
Seeing him earlier that day had been unexpected. The best kind of surprise. And even though they hadn’t ended on a bad note, he knew there was more to be said.
Nearly startled at hearing is full name, Castiel looked up from his desk, puzzled. The man in question was looking right at him with a kind smile on his face. It took Castiel a moment before placing him.
“S’okay.” He paused a moment, gathering his courage to ask the next question. “Does that happen often?”
Castiel let out a deep and exaggerated sigh, and climbed onto the bed next to Dean. But before pulling up the covers, he hastily put one pillow in-between them as a statement. Dean lifted an eyebrow, but stayed quiet. Castiel settled himself properly, pulled the covers up to his chin and turned his back to Dean.
Shifting on his seat, Sam said, “Jack? I know the last few days have been eventful. So, if you don’t feel like you’re up to it, that’s okay.” He paused. “But if you’d like, I—”
Castiel shook his head, turned to the mirror right next the front entrance and saw with shock the poor state he was in. Dirt on his forehead and cheek. And his hair was all over the place. And he was still wearing his jumpsuit.
Since the incident had occurred a couple of days before he was to meet the volunteer, in a moment of excitement, Dean had eagerly included the event in his letter to Sam. Given the
Castiel suggested that they amble down the street, keeping on one side, and make their way back on the other.
But before Castiel could answer, his phone buzzed. One look at Castiel was all Dean needed to know what it was concerning and that his night was now over.
“And Mom said to tell you that there’s plenty of leftovers in the fridge, if you’re hungry for something more sustainable than this. She’s downstairs tending to Devereaux’ boxes.”
Castiel: And since I don’t think this feeling will vanish anytime soon, I think moving out might be helpful.
And for the past minute or so, they both had to witness Dean’s frustration rise as he attempted to add cherry tomatoes and shredded cheese with great effort. No matter how Dean tried to keep them in place, most of the shredded cheese kept falling next to his taco and the tomatoes were simply rolling off onto his plate.
“I know, I know,” sighed Sam. “And I’m aware that the longer I wait, the more awkward the situation might get. On the other hand, blurting this out in the open, right now, when I’m barely—” Sam stopped talking and sighed loudly. “The point is that I will. Just—we’re taking things slow for now, and as much as I hate to say it, it’s probably the right thing to do.”
“Yes, I saw that and I don’t understand why. It was not at your request. It was management’s, really higher up management, but there evidently wasn’t anything negative attached to it. You seemed to be bounced back and forth, up until a few years ago, when Mr. Inias left. Then you asked to be at the reception, which you did impeccably and moved up to front desk manager. That’s the first time you were able to actually move up the food chain.”
“Don’t be so sure,” said Dean, making a face of disgust at no less than four guys walking in front of him, all wearing leather jackets and similar amulets.
And eventually, he felt himself slowly drifting off, before falling to sleep, as he prayed this would be night when he would finally get the good night sleep he had yearned for all week.
“She wasn’t lying. I am supposed to be in History right now and that always puts me right to sleep. So, instead of getting myself in trouble in class, I figured I’d skip the middle part for once.”
Dean was still staring at him. Sam let out of sigh as Jessica was grinning next to him. “I’ll send you the info about everything so you can double check. But maybe try to chill for once?”
“Okay, but Sam’s room? I mean, Cas is m—” Dean stopped himself before the word came out of his mouth, but he knew it didn’t take a genius to figure out what he had been about to say.
“Thanks. And Dean?” asked Sam, tilting his head to the side. “I know this is totally off topic, but am I seeing this right? The boxes behind you. Are they the ones Benny left you to bring to his friend…like months ago?”
“But why?” he said softly. After a moment of silence, he continued, “I—I can give you—I can give you space, Dean. But I can’t pretend that I haven’t heard—I’ve—I passed my whole life pretending I didn’t hear what people were saying about me. Or my family. I don’t want to do this here.”
Doing as he was told, Dean slid himself higher on the bed, while Castiel quickly grabbed a large and thick sweater for him. He went back the bathroom and came back with another glass of water, which he put on Dean’s nightstand, right before handing Dean his sweater. Dean, with some misery, managed to put it on, got himself under the covers and dropped on his back, one arm covering his eyes.
Castiel assured Dean that he would send him the link once the power was back, and they then continued the rest of their meal discussing lighter topics. Dean was surprised to learn that Castiel had rode all the way into town, particularly given the intense heat records they were plagued with. He immediately told him that if he ever needed a lift into town or back home, to let him know.
Castiel looked down, nodding. “I know, but…I knew—I’m not surprised this happened. But I’m grateful you’re not like that. It really means a lot.”
Not sure of what he should do or what was happening to him, he simply stood up, let go of the letter, didn’t touch the boots and left his apartment. After locking the door, he left the building and went down the street.
As they had cleared most of the hallway, the Boy King took a moment to catch his breath. Deanmon, who had been crushing someone’s skull, stood up, holding his blade in one hand and something bloody in the other.
He nodded and pursued with his order, which consisted of waffles with fruits, all the while he was still focused on his drawing.
Dean, noticing his struggle, slowly slid his hand over his shoulder for comfort and said, “What is it?”
I kicked in the door. The room was dark. No lights. No windows. No furniture or anything. Might as well have been a broom compartment. An oversized one, but you know.
Nevertheless, Castiel was still impressed with his selection and after hearing Dean’s selling speech about them, he would gladly go to any of these places. They all seemed interesting and beautiful. And he certainly had never been before, so he was eager to go.
Between helping setting up the rooms and the tables, and making sure there weren’t any overall issues with the rooms they were staying in, it had been an incredibly busy day.
Not particularly thrilled with the topic of discussion, but resolute to not lie, Castiel took in a deep breath. “I’m not opposed to it, if that’s what you mean. But marriage has never really been something I aspired for that deeply. Why do you ask, Dean?”
While Jack listened attentively to Sam, down in the deep corners of hell, Team Free Dark, as Dean had named the deranged trio, was making its way to the throne room by slaughtering nearly everyone in their path.
“All this footage was taken over a decade ago,” announced Roman. Enthusiasm filled the room. “And that was simply a child fighting for a bowl of soup. We eventually figured out one correlation. Trauma. If someone had endured trauma, the bigger it was the better, they can become susceptible. It is not true of all trauma victims. But everyone who is susceptible to those side effects is a trauma victim. Most of them are practical, but tame.”
So far, Castiel and Dean had never returned to the same address. But they often frequented the same neighborhoods, and something told Dean that they would most likely revisit these locations eventually.
“Don’t apologize,” he said, almost laughing. “Just give yourself a break. Okay? And—and as for Cas, Dean, just clarify the situation for him. I have no doubt he will understand, and then simply ask him if another night could work with him. That’s all. Okay? Dean?”
During his first week after his arrival, Castiel had learned rather quickly that most people were aware of his identity. Some had been eager to share a few words, while some had contented themselves with a warm smile from afar.
Feeling his eyes almost prickling at the “For Rent” sign in the window, even though it had been hanging for weeks, he cleared his throat and ran his hand over his face, hoping it would help the situation.
But he had to stop circling the man if there was evidently no hope of this ever yielding in the direction he was so aching for.
. But Castiel had insisted on waiting for a special occasion to wear them properly, and he decided that now was the time.
“Homework,” answered Sam, quickly, after taking a massive bite of his sandwich. “Had to finish a lab report with Garth. It’s due this afternoon, and we tried to finish it this morning but it took longer than we thought. All good now.”
consisted of, Castiel, despite his best effort to remain focused on the gorgeous man before him, found himself involuntarily glancing in Dean’s direction. It appeared that both he and Charlie were no longer seated at their table. Scanning the room quickly, he couldn’t see Charlie anywhere. Dean, on the other hand, was standing near the booths, flirting with a tall brunette wearing a mini-skirt.
“I—” he swallowed hard, glancing around him, slightly panicking. “I’d rather not, Amara. It’s been years since—”
Castiel shut his eyes. “Shit, I—Dean, no. Okay, I—I completely forgot you had that number. My phone is paid by my company. So, the moment I returned their call informing them I would soon be on my way, they closed my account. It was the first thing I had to hand back when I returned to the office.”
The bathroom door was shut, and while he didn’t hear anything, no water running, the light was creeping from under the door.
that’s how he found out.” He paused a moment and took a deep breath. “Cas, I—believe me, I know how much of a pain it is to deal with the fam’s rep, and I’m sure that Dean’s reaction doesn’t seem too comforting right now, but these were really unusual circumstances. Even for our standards. And this is not the first time you’ve dealt with this, and you had time to mull it over. Dean didn’t. He’s…” Gabriel swallowed hard. “He’s still processing. I can’t promise that he’ll turn around. But if you care about him as much as I think you do, without giving up, letting him catch his breath for two seconds might be worth the try since you say everything else failed…I—I don’t know.”
“I thought the point was for you to convince me to go through with this, Dean,” said Castiel, amused. “Not the other way around.”
I know the hardest thing to do is to let the people we love go for their own well-being, as well as for our own. But do not think that their decision—or circumstances forcing them—to stay away automatically implies their lack of love for you.
“I don’t think that’s going to solve anything, Dean. I—I don’t want to say I don’t want my job back anymore, because that would be a lie. But even if I knew that going there to plead my case would guarantee me my job back, I know it will never be the same. Too much has happened. I would still have to deal with the other stuff. And frankly,” he swallowed hard, “after what they did, it just tells me they never really cared about me. None of them. I got passed over for so long there, and I knew why. And I never questioned it because I’m just—used to it. If that’s how they treated me before, I’m not particularly eager to find out how they would treat me if I crawled back there.”
“And festive drinks or food,” he said, smirking. “I think it will be good to remind myself that not everything about this holiday is annoying. Especially since I usually like this time of year.”
“If you tell me you have Wi-Fi here, I will be both incredibly impressed for the range and almost disappointed by it too,” said Castiel.
For a brief moment, Dean felt his heart jump, worried that there was a particular reason why Samuel kept on the subject.
“I didn’t see either of them,” Jack continued saying, seemingly unaware of his father’s lack of attention, “but if Belphegor said so, I think it’s because it’s true.”
Uriel leaned his head backwards as though he had finally understood what Zachariah meant. “Interesting choice. However noteworthy, the skills of a mechanic don’t exactly sell what we were looking for.”
“Yes. I’m sure that you do,” huffed Naomi. She stepped onto the porch, pushing Dean further back from the entrance, and shut the door behind her. This was worse than Lucifer’s interaction. After taking a good look at him, she said, “You can’t see him, Dean. The answer is no.”
And the moment he had finally stepped inside that house, Dean had not been able to stop smiling. It smelled like pine and cranberries. And something else that Dean couldn’t quite figure out. The place was warm. Cozy. Lived-in. It wasn’t messy, but it didn’t appear
“So, um, Dean? I’m curious.” Castiel shifted on his seat, changing his whole body position. Dean, now officially worried, braced himself for Castiel to reveal that he had known all along about Dean’s massive crush on him.
“The six months deadline has now officially passed. I am no longer required to stay.” His eyes were glued to the ground and he could not believe he was actually saying these words out loud. “And if I leave, it seems that it would be most beneficial for the ranch. Which was the purpose of our agreement. To help you with the ranch.”
“Yes, maybe.” Dean turned himself on his back again. Looking at the ceiling, he said, “I don’t know. What do you think? Good idea or did I just make it even weirder?”
Sam stared at Gabriel like it was a trick question. He wasn’t sure what he was getting at, so he decided to approach the topic with precaution.
Castiel let go of Dean’s shirt and eased his hands to his neck, gently nudging him to face him again, and kissed him harshly on the mouth, demanding more. After Dean let out a moan, they broke the kiss, needing to catch their breaths.
. And this guy showed up just a few days before Christmas for additional help there, and from that moment on, all Dean did was constantly stare at his pretty face.”
While Deanmon was busy slicing souls in half, as he whistled a joyful tune, the Boy King was killing demons with a stolen angel blade, with the help of Godstiel, as they were both trying to spare their powers for the moment. The Boy King needed to be full strength for Asmodeus, and their departure from the bunker had taken its toll on Godstiel.
Castiel, feeling uneasy on which way this conversation was heading to, nonetheless took a moment to find the right words, hoping it would clarify the situation for Dean. “I stopped because I had a moment of self-awareness. Of what was happening. Of what was about to happen between us. Of what I had done. With you.”
Castiel: Or I try with Dean, and whatever happens, I will most likely end up needing a new place to stay.
The fact that Dean had his own vehicle, however, had brought them some respite in completing their tasks.
“I have no problem with that,” said Dean, resting a hand on his waist. “But, um, you won’t need anything?”
With the heat already weighing him down, he stayed in his underwear, and simply put on a thin top after washing his face quickly.
The month of November proved itself to be laborious at the ranch, as the pressure of the holidays grew exponentially with every passing day.
“Nothing,” he said, still staring at him. He nodded at Sam’s remote. “Let’s get this show on the road.”
There was a faint hint of confusion over Dean’s face, and after a short hesitation, he said, “He—he didn’t. Ca—Mr. Novak wishes to stay here with us.”
“While we wait, I’d really like to know who that is. You see, I’m not really a fan of people who drop in unannounced.”
“I haven’t dealt much with grief, Dean. But I don’t think there is a right or wrong way to react to this. I don’t think you should beat yourself up or question yourself by comparing the two.” He paused, briefly hesitating if he should continue. He then said, “Do you want to tell me how it was with your parents?”
Gabriel chuckled. “Your heart is in the right place, pal, but you must know that there isn’t much we can do against what
Castiel had to think about it for a short instant, but yes, he informed Dean that he had made those as well. Dean stared at Castiel. He opened his mouth as though he was about to say something, but shut it quickly and remained quiet.
The sudden presence made Castiel open his eyes, just in time to see Dean settling at the other end of the tub, facing him. Dean kept to his side of the tub, with his hands wrapped around his legs, with his knees under his chin, as if he was trying hide himself. Castiel smirked and pushed himself further back to give Dean some room.
“Angels. It wouldn’t be the first time that they have intervened. I know, for instance, that Zachariah forbade Chuck to warn you two about the angels’ real involvement in the Apocalypse, as well as the whole ordeal regarding Lilith being the last seal.”
“I had a lot of practice,” Castiel informed him, as he helped himself to one. Dean was frowning. “What?”
He felt soft fingertips on his waist. A small breath against his chest. Thick, yet soft hair under his chin as that something—
Sam gestured for Castiel to take a seat at the kitchen table and asked him if he was hungry. “I found a box of taco shells stashed in the top cupboard, and after a quick look at what you guys had in the fridge, I figured I could pull this off.”
I—I didn’t even know that was possible. How? And the Mountain! It’s gone and I—I don’t understand—I—I know I must have messed up somewhere and—”
He felt bad about lying, especially when he knew his mother wouldn’t have objected to the idea of him meeting Castiel, but he knew that the truth would have raised questions. He tried to lessen his guilt by telling himself that he was after all simply meeting a friend and not doing anything actually dishonest.
The ropes went up in smoke, thus finally freeing him. The door shut behind Jack. He watched with horror the devil’s trap break as a massive fissure formed itself across the floor.
cosplay, which was in fact ironic. Thus, following these comments, many of them were then quite inexplicably wearing a trench coat and tie instead of their flannel and leather jacket.
Anyway, while he did this, the three of us took care of the rest that had managed to escape Crowley’s pull.
Gabriel slammed the door in their faces. He swiftly locked the door, pushed a chair up against it for good measure and dropped onto the foot of the bed, as the other three were pounding on the other side of the door, yelling inaudible things all at once.
Unfortunately, they both immediately fell to the ground, shaking and in pain, after they both simultaneously got zapped in their backs.
He admired the breathtaking scenery while they listened to old music cassette tapes that Dean had tucked away in a shoebox under the passenger seat.
“Here, I’ll hold it,” said Dean. With his left arm resting across his chest, he took hold of the gel pack over his shoulder with his right hand, freeing Castiel’s hand.
“No. Obviously, just—come on, dude. You know what I mean. Just, speak clearly and with confidence, and that’s it.”
One look at Dean next to him, who had his arms clutched against himself and his eyes shut, Castiel knew he couldn’t help himself.
“Someone is very popular tonight,” chanted Dean. “And you wanted to stay in,” he snorted at Castiel. “Well, what are you waiting for?”
Castiel stepped into the doorway to peek and he let out a small gasp. He entered the room to have a better look.
“I should have—I shouldn’t have just walked in.” He remained still, unsure if he should leave or not.
The first two who replied were Balthazar and Hannah, of course. He doubted they would be able to step away from their job for very long, but considering the entire trip would be paid, he thought that perhaps that possibility wasn’t completely impossible.
On the outskirts of the town, where they had access to the lake and near the town’s library, a large crowd had gathered around. Multiple bonfires were already blazing to warm up the crowd. People were ice-skating on the frozen lake. There were games, local shops and food stands all around. And this was what Castiel and Dean could discern at first glance.
Nearly dropping his bowl, Dean froze and listened. His heart pounding in his chest, he held his breath.
“I understand this is very unusual. I also evidently know that it might mean I will have to pass on the very generous promotion down the line. This I regret greatly. I hope you know I truly appreciate the opportunity and that you don’t see this as ungratefulness. It’s simply an issue of timing.” He cleared his throat, after pausing. “But I think this would also be a great opportunity to learn.”
But since Castiel, while still displaying his eternal deadpan expression, didn’t appear to know what it was about either, Sam, in an attempt to smooth things over, said, “How about we go eat like we said? And Chuck, maybe you can help us convince Gabriel to join us against Lucifer and the other angels. That’s why he’s here. To listen to us.”
Except for when John had raked his lawn in the fall, a task dutifully assisted by Dean—though he had mainly played in the pile of dead leaves while his father had done most of the work—Dean hadn’t had much interaction with Mr. Redfield.
Crowley pursed his lips. “That’s a complicated question. Many probably believe they do. But it’s more like a team effort.”
Castiel happily obliged with her request. He hadn’t stated where he slept, but he clearly identified the rooms as “Dean’s bedroom” and “the guest room.”
“I’ve spoken to Michael, yes. And, um, he had a lot to say. All venting and there’s nothing much to it.”
Castiel was not surprised by this statement. He knew the Winchesters were caring and generous people, and even if Castiel had benefited far more of their generosity and kindness than Gabriel ever had, he knew this treatment wasn’t solely reserved for him alone.
Which reminded Dean of something else. “How was the doctor by the way? Was he nice? Sorry I couldn’t get in with you.”
“Gabe, no, I can’t. I just—I just want to sleep. Or pass out. Everything hurts, even my hair. I told you what happened last night, like you wanted. I can now die of embarrassment in peace.”
Your fate, and the one of your family, was cruel and unfair. I tried to help your father—I tried to help every one of you as much as I could—but I am afraid too many bad things at once destroyed his spirit to make him see it. I often thought I should have tried harder and feel regret every time I think of this failure.
And if he hadn’t dared driving by Castiel’s by then, even if it was what he desperately wanted, he knew he never would.
Dean’s feet were no longer touching the ground and it didn’t matter how much he tried to free himself from Lucifer’s grip, it wasn’t working.
“Why didn’t you just ask someone else then?” asked Michael. “It’s not that hard, Cas. Literally anyone would do. That’s what I did.”
Dean snapped out of his reverie, however, when he found a new car waiting for him for their next drive. One he had never seen before: a black Chevy Equinox. An SUV. A vehicle that borderline looked like government property.
But he let out a groan of disappointment when he woke up the next morning and could still hear the rain pouring. Nevertheless, he waited. He continued his morning just as planned. He showered, got dressed, and ate his breakfast. He checked his emails and fixed the cupboard door that needed tending.
Unless he suddenly saw Dean looking like he needed rescuing, he figured he could give him his space for now and enjoy the stories the group at the table were sharing.
He breathed deeply, relieved that Sam was ready to help him. “Thank you. And thanks for, um, not having told Samuel about Cas, too.”
Once home, Castiel took a quick shower to feel better, and dressed himself in the costume he had purchased a few days ago, when he had a tagged along with Kevin and Ash for a quick errand in town.
And while Dean worried immensely about what Zachariah might say at their next weekly meeting, the thought of facing Castiel was far more troubling.
To Dean’s surprise, she started laughing. “Why does this always happen to me? I thought I was making progress. I thought you were different. That’s why I went to you.”
“Not yet,” said Castiel, sliding himself out. Panting, Dean let out a groan of frustration. Castiel loosened his hold on Dean and sat on his heels, only to have Dean twisting around to face him. He leaned towards him and kissed his jaw.
And even though it’s probably not what happened, that is what I’m going with. As far as I’m concerned, by not telling me, it’s like they were practically begging me to say it like that.
Castiel leaned in closer to Sam. “I don’t know what happened between you and Gabe, and knowing him and the conversation we last had it makes me nervous, but at least it seems like you two are getting along perfectly.”
“I—I live in a nice apartment not far from here. I love my job. The people are nice. I appreciate the chance they gave me here.” Henry nodded, and for the briefest of moments Castiel thought he had seen Henry pursed his lips, but if it had happened, it was done very quickly. “I have nice friends. I can’t really complain.”
“In part.” Dean began walking down the hallway again. “I was also hoping he would know what to make of this mess because I sure as hell don’t. I have no clue how we’re supposed to stop them, just like I don’t know what they want. Like, let’s take the bunker. If they came here to tear us a new one, what was the point turning this place upside down and why leave so abruptly when they could have easily ended us right there and then?”
It wasn’t the first time that intruders had found their way into the bunker. Some had left clear evidence of their trespass, while others had tried to remain undetected. The British Men of Letters, including Arthur Ketch himself, had just pulled such a stunt on them not that long ago, actually.
Not knowing what else to do, he hastily walked past them, grateful that she hadn’t noticed him. At the other end of the counter, he paused a moment and glimpsed back at them with caution. Bela had her arms wrapped around his shoulders and leaned in for a kiss.
Without uttering a word, Dean stepped towards him and gently wrapped his arms around his torso, hugging him tightly.
Castiel lifted his eyes, tilting his head. “We don’t always agree, no. And this, on too many subjects for my liking. And given that we are a large group, it comes to be unbearable rather quickly.”
“Imagine our surprise,” she continued, “when we realized an anomaly in our system indicating that there are two James Novaks listed in our records. This James Novak,” she said, projecting a frame onto the wall of a man in cryo sleep, “is serving his sentence at the facility we hold in our headquarters. You two look alike.”
One look at Gabriel, who was comfortably resting against the edge, sipping on his coconut, pretty much told Sam that he was in no hurry to do such a thing.
Perhaps it was all in Dean’s mind though. Judging by Sam’s attitude, he didn’t seem to notice anything unusual.
Castiel took a deep breath. He bit his lip and looked at Dean who was watching him, awaiting his story. “There’s nothing much to say about it, really.”
“I’m not kidding. I mean, it would be kinda weird, but I will hug the hell out of you right now. Come on, I’ll make sure Dean will see,” said Sam, shifting in his seat.
“So, Gabriel, Sam wanted to know something,” he said loudly, after clearing his throat, causing Sam to stop talking mid-sentence.
While Dean was helping Jack shake off most of the snow from him, Castiel, mildly exhausted, was trying to put the toboggan back in the trunk of the car, but appeared to be failing after a few attempts, as it kept slipping from his hands.
“I did what I was supposed to do,” he blurted out. “I helped him secure the fate of his ranch. And like it was planned, I came back. That’s what happened.”
He was calm and ready to explode all at once. He couldn’t move. Just fixed in time, right there. And yet, he felt the urge to tear down a brick wall with his bare hands.
“It—it already has,” said Dean, nearly apologetic. “It will come back, but only at—only at the very end of the summer.”
Dean, with his arms still crossed over his chest, swallowed with difficulty as he felt his throat tighten. And after staring at Castiel for a long minute, he said, “I meant every word.” He cleared his voice and took another moment to make sure his voice wouldn’t break. “And Cas, what you said about when we—but it was more than just that moment, too. It was everything. I couldn’t stop reading your blog. I couldn’t get over how you just made everything better. I tried so hard not to like you, because I thought—” Feeling his eyes prickling, Dean stopped mid-sentence and turned his head, hoping to regain his composure.
Missouri had chosen to not give any additional information on the matter and told them to simply take her tip or not.
“Of course,” said Dean, frowning. “I’m super invested now. It’s like, you’re spoiling me. It’s becoming a daily thing.”
Castiel slid his hands underneath his thighs, and once he had reached the back of his knees, he raised them slightly, tugging Dean closer to him, as he slowly rolled his hips against him.
The morning light had arrived, bringing along the noise of the city rumpus caused by traffic and the like, much to Dean’s annoyance.
Dean bit the inside of his cheek. He knew if he repeated Naomi’s words to his father, John would get out of his truck, burst into that house and demand to see Castiel right away, and not leave without having a heated discussion with the Novaks.
“Hi. We have a reservation under my name, Dean Winchester,” he said, reaching for his credit card, and identification, after he pulled out his wallet.
“Ew, gross. Good night, Sam,” said Castiel, turning to his side, ready to end the conversation there, as Sam was roaring with laughter.
Dean, pursing his lips, let out a deep sigh. “I never got to. As it was the last days before Christmas, I didn’t have one second to myself. I don’t even know his name or even exchanged a few words with him. And I didn’t work here after Christmas. I, um, did stop by the store a few times, but…and since I’ve been back, I tried to find out if anyone knew anything, but I haven’t had much luck so far.”
“Dean, letting you down is about the last thing I want to do. After what happened when—well, when I followed through with Crowley’s Purgatory scheme, I promised myself I would do anything in my power to never repeat that mistake.” There was a short pause, and then he added in a gentle voice, “I fear that I did just that with Jack, so I’m sorry.”
His knees nearly gave out at the pain. He gripped Castiel by the waist and buried his face into Castiel’s neck.
While Sam wasn’t sure he was getting the whole scoop, he believed Castiel was telling him the truth.
