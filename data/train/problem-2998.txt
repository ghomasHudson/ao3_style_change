“Better,” he said, finally.
“’Fraid so,” said Dean.
“Are you kidding?” he demanded, delighted.
He stepped out of the way.
“What is?” Cas asked.
Cas opened his mouth to explain, but another voice broke in, also British. “Castiel,” it said.
The Mother Goddess existed across dimensions. In every reality, she was Mother, just as Father was Father in every reality. It’s rather mind-bending for humans to think about. Don’t hurt yourself.
“Yeah, really not liking the sound of that,” said Dean.
“Not here,” Cas said urgently, and he rubbed Dean’s back. It felt surprisingly not horrible, and it was more affectionate than Cas had been back home. Weird. “Not with Crowley. There’s never a catch, with Crowley
Well, that was a reasonable and measured response, she thought dryly. Hadn’t Dean just said that that would send the world out of balance? Then again, he
“Trial and error,” she grimaced. “And Lucifer explained some of it, though he’s pretty bad at this sort of thing,” she added, amused. “Linda and I compare notes, too, and Trixie learns fast. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know—you’re not alone in this. Angel Network is big, and there’s a bunch of other humans in it, too. It’s kind of overwhelming at first but you get the hang of it. We need more humans, though.” She smirked. “The angels are all disasters. Please, we need more humans.”
Cas’s low sound stopped. Dean stirred, wanting it back.
Lucifer made a weird sound, something low and deep in his chest. In was very soft and decidedly not human. Cas never made sounds like that. Dean eyed him, curious. “Darling,” Lucifer was saying quietly, “If it’s not safe—”
sound, an angel sound. “That’s in the past. That can change.”
possible. The only one he trusted was Cas, anyway.  At least Cas didn’t seem alarmed.
What even. Dean gave up trying to understand. Daydream World, man. Totally insane.
There was something interesting about this one, Michael thought, intrigued, as he watched those eyes. A pull, like this human could be his as Chloe was Lucifer’s, if he played his cards right. He would obviously have to share with that Castiel. That bond was precious, and nigh unbreakable. Where Lucifer’s gift was desire, Michael’s was passion, and he could see that in this human’s posture. His past was murky, and also terribly sad, Michael could tell. Dean Winchester had the weight of great, terrible tragedies, one after another, heavy on his shoulders. He looked like he needed cheering or comforting. Mostly comforting. That could be a fun project. For Michael, comforting usually involved sex. He wondered if Castiel would let him get that close. Probably not. Still, could be fun to try.
Dean pressed his nose into Cas’s neck, and he thought
He was a little freaked out at the violence that coiled tense in Dean’s shoulders, but angry enough on behalf of his Pigeon to keep on shouting.
“Made some modifications,” said Ella, eyes on the road. “Not
Hedgewitch. Of course. He was thinking like a hedgewitch. A hunter.
“When Jack died,” Cas scowled, finally. “I came here when I left.”
“Yes,” said Cas. “Or, rather, I did. Before everything went wrong.”
“Not Hell,” said Cas. He’d straightened. “The core of the Earth. The heat will distort His perception of you. And if you could perform a spell that radiated outward, mimicking an explosion—but how to hide the Earth afterwards?”
It felt like a case. Cas was at his side and he didn’t have Sam, but Ella was there, a bit subdued because of the dead angel.
“Not your fault,” growled Chloe. “You know, I wondered. That’s what an antichrist
wings were made to be touched; Cas went all puddly and thrumy when Dean ran his fingers through the feathers. It was an absolute crime that Cas couldn’t manifest them back home.
“Amenadiel’s girlfriend,” said Chloe. “Also, Lucifer’s therapist.”
“Who’s Belial?” Dean asked Ella as they got downstairs. “Is he—Angel Network?”
, anyway. Michael’s eyes were blue, blue as the sky, and deeply compelling. Dean could fall into those eyes. Was this a vessel thing? Could be. Felt like it was, like there was a pull there. This was enough to seriously freak Dean out, but Michael didn’t ask anything of him. Instead he deliberated.
?” he breathed, visibly horrified.
of all people was defending them?
“Crowley,” said Cas. “He doesn’t have—”
“Don’t you bloody dare—Aziraphale!” Bright laughter down the hall
“Uh,” said Dean, “Lady God?”
She listened. She smiled. “Yeah,” she said. “Later.” She hung up.
? Do you have any idea the sort of
“Will that work?” Aziraphale asked softly.
“We have to go to Lucifer,” Ella had said, insistent. “If you won’t, I will. He’s gonna freak, but he has to know.”
“Also not okay!” Dean shouted, finally angry, angry enough to blurt the truth. “My damned kid lost his soul! He killed my
“Nnnnnope.”
Lucifer put the backs of his first two fingers her forehead, concerned. He knew this was a thing people did for their sick loved ones, but he had no idea why.  Something about a fever; didn’t matter. She smiled at him.
“Sometimes,” said Cas. “Michael, once, long ago. It is not serious, and it heals very quickly, though it does sting.”
“Cast the spell; we haven’t time for this,” said the voice of this other Lucifer. “Unless you want to leave Dean Winchester to rot?” The last was hopeful. “Azazel would love to chew on him. It might even break him out of his funk.”
This was just. It was too weird for words. Dean glanced at Cas, but Cas didn’t seem phased at all. If anything, he seemed relieved. Relieved about what? That
“I mean,” Sam said, reading the letter upside down, “He’s not wrong.” He quirked a weird smile. “It is insanity. And, I mean, Cas does love him. That’s a point in his favor, right?”
“Crowley,” he murmured, also rising.
“Yeah,” said Dean. “Take care of the kid?”
He broke into Raphael’s study, because Raphael kept records of this sort of thing. Amenadiel would never break into a room belonging to one of his nestmates, but Michael had no compunction. Raphael was always annoyed with him, anyway; what was one more thing?
Crowley was right, Dean realized, horrified. He had not been good to Cas.
Aziraphale hissed again, eyes flaring blue. “Do not,” he said sharply, “enter this room. I assure you, it will be the very last thing you do.”
“Anyway,” said Aziraphale, sitting on the arm of a chair occupied by Crowley. Cas always said that those two were attached at the hip, but it was weird actually seeing them together, visibly opposites in every way, and even more visibly together. “Castiel, do you know anything about why Him Above might order Raguel to do such a thing?” He paused. “Or you, Dean. What is happening in your world? What is this about the other universes collapsing?”
“Yeah. But he was brought back by a Reaper
Cas pulled back.
Dean shook his head. This world was so bizarre, but like, it was bizarre in the nicest ways. It was hard to believe – an angel and a demon playing chasing games, and Cas was sitting calmly petting a Hellhound. His lack of alarm was soothing.
As if on cue, from down the hall came a shout. “
“Yes, you can,” said Michael. “Your human is standing beside you. Don’t you see? An angel and a demon, a human and a devil—and an angel and a human. It will be nigh unbreakable.”
Cas rolled his eyes. He definitely did not seem appropriately alarmed. “Don’t antagonize him,” he said, but Dean wasn’t sure who he was talking to. He snapped his finger.
“Really evil,” Dean agreed.
and he did not take it out on me! Bakt sang us both to sleep! That is how you deal with loss! A prostitute and a thief treated me better than you ever treated him, Dean Winchester. And he still trusts you enough to let you fix his wings! He’s a sodding miracle, our Castiel. I have no idea what that makes
“Whatever, man, do what you gotta,” Dean said, and braced himself.
Chloe barked a laugh, more bitter than amused. “Right. You’re right, why am I even surprised anymore.” She sat again. “Lucifer doesn’t like kids, and anyway I wasn’t planning on—yeah. I can’t
He finished that second wing eventually. He was loath to wake Cas up, but when he folded the other wing he stirred, and the thrums tapered off. Too bad. It was a good sound.
He?” He paused, glaring at the far wall as if collecting himself. “You’ll be useless if we try to do this right now. I certainly was right after my first one,” he added, still growling a little. “Stay together. And then I want a full report. Alright?”
By this point Lucifer had got rid of Raguel’s mutts, leaving only Shepherd, who was exhausted from playing with them all morning. He’d got the dogs to good homes, even, dammit. Bloody Angel Network.
Dean chewed on his sausage and shrugged. He was pretty freaked, but he’d reached a level of freaked, what with the whole Chuck smashing worlds thing, where he was approaching critical mass. He could not physically be more freaked, so what was one more thing? As far as he could tell, Jack having his soul back was
“Probably,” said Lucifer, shrugging.
“Like Hell! Let me see!”
“What the Hell man?” Dean sputtered to Cas.
He took a deep breath and stepped back. Dean felt a chill in the warm California day. He blinked at Cas, a little bewildered. He wanted to be close.
“You really think Lucifer doesn’t do that?” Dean waved his hand at the little pile of clothes to indicate power or miracles or whatever.
Dean grumbled. He curled a little closer to Cas, trying to get the moment back.
“That is the only reason I’m not furious,” said Crowley, but he still sounded pissed.
“From Heaven,” growled Lucifer. “Not nowhere. You said he came from Heaven. An act of war.” He clenched a fist, visibly angry. His eyes glowed red, just a little.  Dean had seen that red glow on Nightmare Lucifer before; it was unsettling to see it here, too, on Daydream Lucifer. “I will not be manipulated.”
“Castiel,” called Ella. “Was the stab wound the only contact you had with this angel?”
“Goes without saying, angel, goes without saying,” Crowley replied, nearly giggling, what the Hell? “Lucifer always has good
“They’re here,” he said, and got to his feet. “Are you sure you want to come, darling?” he asked Chloe anxiously. “It will be—incredibly dangerous, and—and not even close to human—”
“Winchester,” Crowley said through the door. “You gotta come downstairs. Your angel’s an idiot who’s never going to ask, but you really do have to learn how to do this.”
“You’re not angry because you need a therapist,” Crowley told him frankly. “I can see that you’re bonded tight enough for a paradox, and you hang on to that, Pidge, that’s rare, but you need to teach him some bleeding manners. Lesson the first.” He rounded on Dean again. “He is more than the sum of his parts! Just like you!  Which means he doesn’t need to be
“No one’s thrummed in our Heaven in thousands of years – at least not that I’ve heard,” Cas replied, slurring a little. “Affection drained away. It’s a love-sound, a content-sound. Good things.”
--------------------
Ella, of course, floored her sleeper car until they reached the highway, where they promptly got stuck in LA traffic. Dean glanced in the rearview, watching Cas fidget with apparent nerves. Was it Lucifer? Did he not want to see Lucifer? No, he seemed perfectly fine with Lucifer before, when Lucifer met them in Hell. Maybe Chloe? Dean had no idea. He’d never seen Cas nervous before, not really, not expressing it like that.
Dean blinked, thrown. The warm fuzzies from the preening were dissolving. “What’s your problem, man?”
Paradoxes, he thought woozily. Paradoxes were
“You know what it’s like?” Crowley snapped, and now he was in Dean’s face. What the Hell? Dean held his ground and glared. “Let me tell you what it’s like. It’s
“Honored. Alright then.” A weird sort of lump rose in his throat. Honored. It was clear that this meant something, something about trust and family, but put like that—put like that, this was something significant indeed. Trying and mostly failing to banish the deep-seated feeling, tangled and complicated and big, that was tugging his heart, Dean pulled out the last big clump of powder down. He contemplated some of the smaller clumps but called Aziraphale back over anyway.
Which Aziraphale had done himself, of course, the last time Castiel had been here.
Crowley nodded. His yellow eyes were red rimmed. He took off his apron and sat next to Aziraphale.
His wings slumped. Then, at last, he said, “Chloe and her bloodline. They’re key. Blessed by Father, carried by Amenadiel, the strongest of us. They’re immune to Lucifer and to some degree, Father. They can’t keep Father out entirely, but they can make it harder for him to be here, for his orders to be heard. That is why only the First Circle heard him; he was blocked.”
“Point to you,” Crowley drawled. “Showing interest. That’s the right question. He means fix them. Preen them. We’ll show you how to do it, too.”
“Beatrice,” said Lucifer.
Cas chuckled. “It’s just how they do it. The chair is not actually necessary.”
, do you understand? We will not do this if you do not want to.”
“The second,” Ella said, firm. “Say it again.”
Chloe smiled a little, like it was a fond memory. “Well. It was a murder, actually. One of his friends was killed, and I was on the case. He didn’t do it.” She added this wryly, raising an eyebrow at Dean. He smiled kind of sheepishly. He
. Perhaps it is different here, but it is—not done, at home.”
“Has Castiel—taught you anything about angels?” Now her eyes were laser focused again; this was why she’d brought him outside. To be fair, Dean was hungry for this information, even though it was a weird time to be talking about it. The antichrist thing tugged at him, too. Tell her or not?
Dean had no idea what this meant, but Cas seemed to. “He
“I would appreciate it,” Cas said, perking up a little.
Chloe and Beatrice.” That wing flexed and curled around the girl protectively and he downed a glass of something golden. Whiskey?
“What just happened?” Dean asked. At his feet, Watchdog whined unhappily.
Angels didn’t have last names. They had epithets. You could sort of pick and choose with epithets. Michael liked Taxiarch. It had an x in it.
In front of him, Crowley whistled, a birdlike sound. Enochian? It sounded kind of Enochian-ish. Weird to hear Enochian used like the sort of language you speak.
Cas nodded. “Yes. This one doesn’t lie. He stretches the truth and obfuscates, but he does not lie. I was possessed by our Lucifer, Dean.” This he said very seriously. “This one is nothing like him. I recommend caution, because he has powers here that the other did not at home, but he will not harm you.”
“Hand made,” he said, “Got it.”
Then Cas did something odd. He pulled one of his actual-factual wings forward. They were patterned like a falcon or something, Dean realized, as Cas stretched one of them. They were actually pretty kickass. He brushed his feathers against Crowley’s side, careful and deliberate. Dean didn’t really understand the gesture; it was entirely foreign. It must have been an angel thing. Weird that there were still things about Cas that he didn’t know.  “I’m fine,” Cas said. “You’re panicking.”
“Yes, Dean. And you apologized.”
.” He met Dean’s eyes and held them, for a moment.
“Oh! There are three different kinds. I guess you don’t have that in your world?” When Dean shook his head, Ella continued, “Well, a Greater Demon’s a Fallen Angel. So, Crowley and Lucifer and Belial are all Fallen, so technically they’re Greater Demons. Well, Lucifer’s an archdemon—like an archangel but backwards, right? I think Belial is too, come to think of it.”
“Impossible,” said Michael. “Father has always had his whims, but this is—cruel—”
Dean let out a breath. “We’re going to win,” he whispered. With something like this? As strong and as good as this? There was no way bastard Chuck could ever beat them.
to be
Look. Crowley had been there, okay. Dean Winchester was an arse, and Crowley had no idea what Castiel saw in him, but he wasn’t going to ruin this for either of them. Winchester would spook if pushed too hard, that much was obvious. Easy does it, for these two.
grave and solemn but with that twinkle that Dean secretly treasured. Hearing Cas sing, clear and bell-like as an angel, raspy and uncertain as a human; now it sat somewhere in the middle. Hunting together, winning, cleaning each other up. Wanting Cas near.
Cas gave him sad eyes, but otherwise made no sound. Chloe tilted her head, and Dean followed out of the room. He glanced back at Cas, a little concerned because he was leaving him alone with
“I’m fine, Dean.”
There were feathers at his side; Cas had nudged him with his wing, gently. Dean blinked, startled at the gesture, but he looked at Cas. “I can tell you the story of how our universes differ,” Cas told him in an undertone. “But it will take some time. It involves the angel Raguel, who isn’t here.”
Not anymore.
Dean gaped at her, and then he laughed. A sleeper car! It was a sleeper car! The exterior was a boring old Volvo, but she’d changed the interior! Of course! That was why the console was so modern, why the seats were so cushy. It purred like a kitten. He felt himself start to grin with delight. Ella Lopez was full of surprises. “What modifications?”
She actually had the nerve to scoff. “Not a racer, though.”
. But I think it might be a lot of blood and also, killing things.” She made a face.
Holy shit, they were actually really good, even though they had vegetables in them. There was some kind of sauce and spice that was unfamiliar, and the veggies were still kind of crunchy. Also, he was really, really hungry.
Cas asked, way too loud.
“Yes,” said Cas, and now he seemed anxious.
“That is just how I feel, my dear,” Aziraphale sighed. He patted her shoulder. “But they have been saying as much from Nightmare World, and now you say Lucifer has confirmed it. That the lights of the other worlds—they are going out.”
and didn’t look back. Somewhere in his heart he knew that label was a lie, though.
“No,” said Cas, amused. “She’ll hurt anyone trying to harm Aziraphale or Crowley. That’s it. But she doesn’t hurt humans.”
“I see,” said Cas, sitting back. “I’ll think on it, then. There must be a solution.”
But on the other hand, he knew about Crowley and Aziraphale. He knew what they meant to Cas, and he’d been reading and even replying to their letters for years. He wasn’t sure he’d trust them with his life right off the bat, but they clearly loved Cas, for real, and that was enough to go on for now.
“It was a great miracle I carried that day,” Amenadiel said. Dean had no idea what the Hell he was talking about. “It was not my miracle. I carried one of Father’s.”
“Following the primaries,” Aziraphale said, tapping more feathers, “are the secondaries. These provide lift and are also important for flying. Lastly are the tertiaries, also important for flight, but not as much as the others. Everyone is different; Castiel prefers we start here. The feathers here—” he ran his dowel through the smaller feathers above, “are coverts. They are for air flow, but they also help with powder down, which we shall get to in a moment. Lastly is the alula, which helps with control.” Aziraphale smiled. “Now, most importantly, is the powder down.” He slid his dowel underneath the smaller feathers – coverts – and lifted them. Underneath was a bunch of matted gray stuff.
“Lucifer gives good hugs,” Dean echoed as they got to the front door. Inside, Watchdog barked once, twice.
“What the Hell?” Dean spluttered. He waved a hand vaguely at Decker, unable to really articulate he was trying to ask.
“The Hell?” Dean spluttered.
“Amenadiel suggested a mock battle with Michael,” Cas said. “Instead of trapping God, we could make it appear that the planet has already been destroyed. An illusion. It can buy us time.”
Lucifer was leaning on the far wall of the hallway, knee bent, one foot braced against the wall. He looked totally different from Nightmare Lucifer, especially since Nightmare Lucifer had possessed a bunch of people, but the weirdness hadn't worn off. He held himself differently, Dean thought, watching him. He couldn't put his finger on how, though.
“I’m fine,” she said, “Really. Just—you know, feeling weird. Maybe it’s a Hell thing.”
“No.”
Overwhelmed and not wanting to die! This was a dream and a nightmare all at once! He needed to talk to Crowley, because Crowley would know what to do—maybe? Sometimes Crowley knew things—except that Crowley would also shout at him so he was putting it off.
Ella gave him a weird look. “So, what are you doing here? Not that I’m not happy to meet you! But Nightmare World guys don’t usually show up unless it’s really bad.”
and hid behind Cas. This was objectively ridiculous because its head came up past Cas’ waist. It was a really, really big dog. Also, it was a
“But for how long, Lucifer?” she demanded. “If I can’t work, how long? Trixie has to go to school, and I can’t just—you can’t just put us somewhere safe and wait for it to pass! What if it never passes?”
“Why, angel! I thought lust was a sin!” Crowley cackled.
And everything kind of went neon.
He’d fussed at Cas’s clothes before, of course. Had Cas interpreted it as preening? He must have. He’d let Dean do it, anyway. Now, Dean fussed with his coverts. Some of the feathers on the leading edge had gone all twisted from the bed, so he fixed it.
“I told him that Chuck was destroying the alternate worlds. What do you think I told him? He has a right to know, Cas.”
do battle against my Father,” he said, but he sounded heartbroken. “Please don’t ask me to.”
“Huh,” said Dean, and followed him through the hole.
“It’s a start.”
“No catch,” said Aziraphale.  “This is my universe, not yours. It has exactly as much meaning as you place into it. For example, my dowel is made of braided papyrus from the River Nile. I clipped it and braided it and dried it. I melted gold to shape the tip, and to bind it at the top. There is a miracle to preserve it, of course, so I did cheat a little, but Crowley doesn’t begrudge me that.” He smiled. “Crowley’s is mahogany. It has protective properties, and it is a strong, beautiful wood. He cut the branch himself, and he carved it himself. It took him months. This requires effort.” He paused thoughtfully and added, “Lucifer made one for Chloe. Now, Chloe doesn’t have wings, but it was a gesture. He made it from blown glass. Chloe’s is made of porcelain and glazed to look like stars. Linda had a bamboo plant in her house that had grown large; she used the wood from that to make one for Amenadiel. Amenadiel has had one for eons; it’s made of silver and looks like a vine. So, you see, it is personal, and as difficult as you make it.”
Dean shrugged. “I’ve fought some big nasties,” he said. “And I’ve won. I killed
“Uh, yeah, okay, is someone gonna explain to me what the Hell a paradox is?” Dean burst out, finally.
Aziraphale beckoned him, and he followed. Aziraphale made a fist, and then lightly tapped Cas’s spine with his smallest knuckle. Dutifully, Cas spread both his wings. They were huge, Dean marveled, nearly reaching the walls on either side of the room. He’d seen that they were brown and banded like a falcon’s before, of course, but up close and stretched like this—wow. That was really something. They were really awesome. Aziraphale turned to Dean.
“Oh, I don’t
“Likely something about Lucifer, I daresay,” said Aziraphale with a sigh.  “Castiel wore much the same expression when we first told him about Lucifer, didn’t you, Pigeon?” He gave Dean the stink eye. What the Hell did he do now?
Cas settled a little more solidly next to Dean. He reached out and caught one of the sparks, and he began to sing. He had a nice voice, Dean thought, and leaned into him, tentative. Clear like an angel, with just a hint of human imperfection. Cas leaned back right away, and Dean sighed, more relieved than he dared to acknowledge.
Hello SPN friends. I have feelings. Do you have feelings? My feelings are mostly about Dean, and they are not positive ones. This fic was written long before the finale so in THIS universe, Dean's getting a kick in the pants about like, actually valuing people. *grumble grumble grumble*
“Yes, Dean,” Cas said, amused. “And if you called one Hunter, it would become a hunter by your side.”
“Oh, few little things go a long way,” she said, cheery. She turned off the ignition. “I can get parts really easy, you know, just small stuff.” She smiled, mischevious.
“How do you build somebody up to the fact that their world’s going to explode?” Sam asked.
Dean followed him and then reached to put his left hand where Aziraphale’s had been. Cas’s wing
“Then the imps,” gritted Lucifer, glaring at Cas.
“The join of your arm is ticklish,” Cas said, still sounding sulky. That was. The funniest damn thing that Dean had encountered in a long, long time. He grinned at Cas’s back, feeling—well, rather tender. Ugh that was an awful word, what was he, sixteen?
Trixie lifted her chin. “Mom’s going with you,” she said.
And Dean was just going to keep telling himself that.
Michael smelled like whatever a human liked best. Chloe Decker and her bloodline, of course, were immune, but according to a certain Dorothy Winters, the smell got stronger when he was in heat. Dean was a little immune too - Michael had a similar effect on most humans as Lucifer, and Dean wasn't thrown in the throes of passion or a little hypnotized like a regular human might be. Still, he could definitely smell it. Michael was very intrigued by this Dean, after all.
how Cas rose and fell in the air a little with each sweep. The wind howled around them, hot and sulfurous and ahead of them—
This was also kind of weird. Dean’s head was clearing, regretfully, and the hand-holding thing was starting to have more—weight. It was kind of girly, wasn’t it? But he wanted it. He wanted it really badly, and from the way Cas clutched at him, he wanted it, too.
“What?” Cas asked.
“And he’s—destroying alternate universes?” Ella said. “Why?”
Cas put his cheek against Dean’s hair. “Does this mean you’re mine? Crowley says that one’s always special, and that’s you, but—”
“Crowley?” asked Cas, confused. The Fallen Angel Crowley pronounced his name differently than the King of Hell Crowley had, thankfully. It made it less confusing.
They’d all gathered in Crowley and Aziraphale’s master bedroom, sitting on the floor in a circle. Dean sent Sam the letter saying they were coming home but didn’t need the portal opened. In the meanwhile, Dean did his best to ignore prickly, jumpy Lucifer.
“That would be great,” Chloe said. She leaned forward. “Linda’s been trying to pull some out of Amenadiel, but Amenadiel still thinks that it’s not for humans.” She rolled her eyes.
“Hi,” Ella told Cas when they were out on the lawn. “I’m Ella. Thank you for saving Crowley.” She threw her arms around Cas’s neck, much as she had done to Dean.
“I can’t believe that,” Ella whispered. “I just—I can’t.” She reached up and touched her necklace—it was a cross.
They were in some weird back corner of Hell, all stone and uncomfortably large glowing things. Lichen? Whatever. Misery radiated around them, because of course it did; it was Hell. Dead in front of them was a crack in reality, but it was unlike the any of the ones Dean had seen before. This one was darker than dark and it kind of hurt to look at. It twisted in the air in a weird kind of spiral with offshoots, cracks of darkness reaching out. That probably didn’t bode well.
He took Lucifer’s letter, flipped it over, and wrote a quick missive. Zephyr took it, thankfully without bothering to ask another stupid riddle
This didn’t seem to satisfy Chloe.
Lucifer glanced over when Cas pulled himself up and sat near Dean. He snapped his fingers, and those familiar red lights, like burning fireflies, whispered up into the air.
“He needs you,” she said. “I’ll be here, with Maze and Crowley. They said it’s bloodlines, mom. If I’m here, I protect this world. If you’re in Nightmare World, you protect that one. And you just said there are like no angels, right?” she raised an eyebrow at Cas. “Nobody to attack. We can keep more people safe this way. And if you find Lucifer’s mom—well, good. Besides, you have to watch his back.”
HI!! I'm too sleepy to finish up replying; if I haven't got back to you yet, I haven't forgotten about you!! I still love you!! I just wanted to get the next chapter up!! :D
. Nobody seemed alarmed by this. She kicked her legs, perfectly at ease and not scared at all. Lucifer nudged her gently with that wing, and she scratched something that must have been itchy. “According to the note his dog delivered this morning," Lucifer continued scornfully, "he’s currently on a ship headed to the middle of the Pacific, because he got the order to
Cas shuffled his feet. Dean turned to him.
“You also lied,” said Michael, amused, still on the grass.
She nodded. “Crowley showed me. They need it weekly, you know. Preening. It really matters.”
, an angry bird-sound that had Dean taking a startled step back. What the Hell?
“Evil eggs,” Dean chuckled. “Cas, we gotta come back after this. We gotta bring Sam.”
“Belial,” said Aziraphale, softly. His voice was tight, like he was deliberately controlling himself, like it cost him will. “It’s alright. You remember Castiel? Castiel is a friend, and the two humans are with him. Don’t attack.” This coming from the guy who had
“I think it was Turiel,” Cas said. “I am unsure. It’s difficult—the parallels—Aziraphale, I am
“Well, that’s settled,” said Aziraphale, who had slipped up to Cas’ other side.
dignity!
Cas sighed. There was a rustling sound. Dean blinked his eyes open.
“That’s awful,” Ella said. “No wonder you were so scared of our Lucifer.”
Dean nodded. He noticed that Cas said
This was an easier lie than one about Crowley: Lucifer’s Left Hand was part of treaties and things; he was more likely to be seen by officials. Chloe was mortal. Presumably.
“Good,” said Dean.
“Yes,” said Cas, amused. He shifted in his chair and stretched one of his legs. Was that--just the smallest amount of blood on his foot? It disappeared before Dean's eyes. That was weird and likely something Dean should ask him about. “You probably see it in spell books as Angel Dust.”
Watchdog led them up some stairs and to what was clearly the master bedroom. When Dean peered into the door, Aziraphale looked up. He was sitting beside a great bed, with a weird kind of extension on it
“Very carefully,” Cas gritted.  He groaned. “Lucifer is going to panic too,” he said.
“There you are, dear,” said Aziraphale, sitting at the table and looking at Cas. “Everything alright?” Watchdog had her head in his lap, and he was scratching her ears.
. They need

” Crowley snapped. Beside him, Aziraphale made an upset sound. “Oh,
“Sometimes he answers,” Michael insisted. “He makes bets with me. We gamble all the time.
He wasn’t doing very much, truth be told. He’d got soup all over his hands—Aziraphale had made soup for Crowley, of course, because that was what you did when someone was not feeling well. Belial had promptly spilled it, but he'd cleaned up the mess, so there was that. He’d also brought a questionable five headed fish from the River Styx whose still-beating heart apparently had some Hellish something about good luck. It was enormous, nearly six feet long, and slimy and squirming. Aziraphale had quietly vanished that. He’d meant well, anyway.
Castiel shrugged.
“We can try,” Amenadiel said. He shrugged. “Linda and I have tried. We can produce one. I am unsure how I feel about it, however; it is not one of my Father’s creations, and it does not follow His laws. And sometimes, Linda dislikes it
“What do I do?” Dean asked, just as hushed.
He kept an eye on Crowley, out of bed with his wing bandaged. He looked downright miserable and very small, especially for a demon. It was a lot to ask, to trust a yellow eyed demon, and it had only been three days, but Dean was starting to get it. Crowley leaned into Aziraphale’s side, uncharacteristically silent. Aziraphale kissed his temple and passed him more Mexican food, since they’d ordered in. Those two could paradox. That said a lot. Dean was kind of fascinated.
“Adults are stupid,” she said, crossing her arms. “I’m going to go live with Maze when you move to the penthouse. She has sense.”
“I will,” said Castiel. “How do we get in?” he asked, eyeing the doorway.
“Huh,” said Ella. “And I know Gabriel’s been bullying Aziraphale since time immemorial, so he’s on my shit list, too. And Sandalphon, he did Gomorrah. Michael picks on Lucifer so I owe him a knuckle sandwich, but otherwise he doesn’t hurt people, provided you don’t pick a fight with him
Cas shifted his feet. The wings on his back twitched, like that was a nervous habit, like Dean was going to have to learn body language for an extra set of limbs. “Not dead,” he managed, looking away. “But Crowley is—right. A life without wings and feathers is a sort of half-life, for an angel
It wasn’t that she didn’t like it. She liked it quite a bit, actually. Linda had a lot of supernatural in her life, and she liked to think she’d adjusted pretty well. But a paradox was intimate. It was right there close in her heart, and it was kind of overwhelming. Good, but overwhelming--sometimes too overwhelming. It was private. She was definitely not up to a public one like that.
Dean was starting to regret his life choices. “And you trust him?” he asked.
“What the Hell are you even talking about?” Dean sighed.
“Ms. Lopez?” called Aziraphale. At least somebody knew what the Hell was going on.
the Rebellion, Pidge. It wasn’t pretty. We already had an apocalypse! We were supposed to be done!” He turned around to face them and scrubbed his hands through his dark hair. He was wearing an apron that said
Yep. Definitely heard him. The little ball uncurled, somehow, in his chest and in his mind’s eye, and wrapped itself around Dean like a very friendly snake.
This was comforting and not horrifying. Castiel felt like gunpowder, and the metallic edge of a blade, and powdery, fresh air. All of these things were fine; they were his Pigeon. Crowley had come a long way, and he was far less skittish with his friends, these days.
The orange winged guy next to him had a wide-eyed, moronic look on his face
Dean watched her face harden, fascinated. “Trying to kill Crowley,” she said. “Right. Okay. Let’s do this.” She took her foot off the break, and she guided the car to a parking spot.
Weird.
Cas quirked a half smile. “It is difficult to preen alone,” he said. “I find it unpleasant. And in the other world my wings would blind you or Sam; I worry that the light through the door might hurt you, or that you might walk in.”
That made sense. “What do they mean?”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said, raspy.
He finished Cas’s wings slowly. He was starting to see Aziraphale’s point: Cas had a lot of crooked feathers, and a lot of that clumped up powder down. Couldn’t be comfortable. That one wing, front and back, took forever, and when he closed it at Aziraphale’s direction, Cas going even more puddly at the gesture, he saw the difference.
“Cas,” he hissed. “What is he talking about?”
“You’re not allowed to kill my best general; he’s the only one with half a teaspoon of common sense Down There.” Lucifer shook a finger at Dean. “If you kill him, I’m stuck with
.  Right. That should have been easy to remember, given their own Crowley, but for some reason it wasn’t.
“Baby—” blurted Chloe, and lunged, hugging her daughter. “No, I can’t leave you here, of course not.”
Dean could feel Cas’s glare over his shoulder.
She blinked at him. “He has?”
“Good lad,” said Aziraphale. “I am happy to help, if you need it. I’m just a letter away.”
“Crowley, he apologized,” Cas said. “I am no longer angry.”
Aziraphale hushed him. “If an angel attacked Crowley, I would do the same. Crowley, where is the wound, my dear? Let me see.”
Most of the high had worn off, though Dean still kind of wanted to chase and play games and make out with Cas more. Making out was
“I can’t cast a paradox,” said Cas, sounding alarmed.
“I have the gift of foresight,” Michael told her kindly. “I know things, but they come to me in a—scattered manner. Also, I found the paperwork in Heaven
Dean rubbed his hand against his pants, wiping the drool away. “You traumatized a Hellhound. Cas, this place keeps getting weirder.”
“Watch it!” hissed Lucifer, too late: she had scraped her hand on Castiel’s sharpened primary. Castiel jumped, apologies writ large on his face as he pulled his wing away. His eyes had gone round with horror, though he didn’t stop singing.
Dean huffed a laugh. “I barely even know what it is, man.” Cas opened his mouth to explain, looking concerned, and Dean interrupted him. “Union of two opposites, I know. So, how do we do it?”
“Hello, Watchdog,” said Cas, gravely.
“He’s destroying universes,” Amenadiel said, and he sounded sick, “We know he hasn’t touched this one. His order was to destroy Chloe and her bloodline instead.”
“I thought Jack was dead,” said Lucifer.
“This is a really bad idea, guys,” Sam said.
Dean didn’t really have a good answer to that. The honest answer was that he didn’t give a damn about alternate universes. He cared about Sammy. This was probably selfish, but it was the truth.
“Ugh,” said Dean.
“Yeah, I’m here with Castiel and his human, got a quick angel question for you,” she said casually.
“Angel, we’re gonna have to go soon,” Crowley whispered. “Lucifer already called. I mean, to paradox the—”
“And he was
. Dean despised him.
, Cas?” This Lucifer had sung so Dean didn’t go nuts in Hell, and he’d cuddled that Chloe Decker with his big white wings and Ella didn’t seem afraid of him, but he was still
Dean wanted to call back
Dean looked at him harder. He inhaled. Something—
“He’s the demon,” Sam replied
. “We fly with two humans today; if any harm comes to them, I will have your head; is that clear?”
Not even close but it was a funny coincidence.
YOU GUYS!! I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy from all the discussion in the comments. You are all great, you are all wonderful, you all brought up REALLY INTERESTING points on all sides of this argument!!! I love reading what you wrote and chatting with you!  And, best of all, nobody had a "you're wrong on the internet" fight!!
“In this universe, God is neither male nor female,” Aziraphale explained. “Different for everybody, you understand. I have always seen a Woman.”
“That’s—a really good idea,” Chloe said. “I don’t know why we didn’t do that.”
. He’s the
“It’s hard. You have to go as deep as you can go and then go deeper. There’s kind of a vibration, too.  Honestly, I found videos of a bass guitar and tried to mimic it. Uh, also, they don’t like it when you do it as a demonstration. Apparently, it
you. Right? Cas?”
“Belial,” said Cas cordially. “What are you doing here?”
” blurted Dean. “Okay, look, no one’s explained this—what the Hell is a Greater Demon?”
“Well, we shall rectify that now,” said Aziraphale. He finished his last bite, clearing his plate. “Crowley, we should go. Lucifer and Chloe have done the first layer.”
Dean Winchester, how fast you go. It is always a shock, and the loss lasts for decades.” He glared. “There is pain in your boy’s future, and that is inevitable, that’s part of it, but I will not
Michael thought about this. “An illusion, maybe,” he murmured. “If Lucifer and I faked a battle. If we fell down into Hell and hid.”
“No,” said Lucifer, sounding totally freaked. “Ah—no. We just paradoxed this house so you’d be safe! Now you want to come to Nightmare World?
“Sock on the doorknob, dude,” said Dean.
Zephyr was rather disappointed about this, but it could tell that now was not the time.
“Hang on.” She took off her gloves and pulled out her phone.
“Uh, yeah, sure,” said Dean. He watched them leave, and then took a second helping of the eggs. They were really good, okay, and also still warm.
“The rules in Daydream World are different than they are here,” Cas said, though more gently. “Living humans can’t walk through their Hell without going mad. And we have to go through our Hell, because that’s where the portal is, and then to their Hell and their Earth. Apparently, there’s a door in the First Circle.”
Dean was annoyed with that demon. But he could see that the life was worth saving. Demon with a good soul. Who knew?
“And you can see her,” Cas continued, and he really did sound worried. “When I first met her, I locked her in a cage, so she is slightly wary of me, but she loves humans. Don’t hurt her, she is—a good dog.” The last was clearly a quote from Crowley.
“Favors?” Dean asked sharply. That sounded an awful lot like a deal.
--------------
“I will,” said Dean, and he meant it.
“The end of the world,” said Dean darkly. “You’re looking at the end of the world.”
All told, Dean Winchester spent three days in Daydream World, and every single one of them changed his life. Like, his whole freaking life.
“Right, that’s an angel thing,” she said. She pulled on a blue exam glove that she seemed to have produced from thin air. “Let’s get this party started.” She strode up to the dead angel.
Cas’s retirement plan. It filled Dean with a weird kind of peace and sorrow to know that Cas had one. Who would have thought? Sam’s didn’t work out, Bobby’s didn’t work out, nobody’s worked out really but Cas—Cas had a good, solid plan and people who loved him. People who would live forever, and who were waiting for him, who he could return to any time he liked. Good.
. “I never told you. I’m sorry. I will tell you.” He ran two fingers lightly through the fringe of Dean’s hair. Dean recognized the gesture, because he had done it; preening, as best as Cas could do since Dean had no wings.  It was an absent gesture, a natural one. Cas didn’t have a lot of natural gestures; his mimicry of a human was still a little stilted, even after all this time.  Of course, he wasn’t mimicking anything here. It made something in Dean’s heart twist.
. He’s very diff—”
The tertiaries were finicky and layered close to Cas’s back and his warm skin. Cas shifted them a little, trying to make them easier to access. It helped. Dean ran the backs of his fingers against Cas’s skin, where the wing joined, both in thanks and in curiosity.
“Forensic scientist, huh,” Dean asked Ella.
“Not strong enough,” said Lucifer. “And He’ll know the way out.”
“Oh for—Monkey, what did he say?” Chloe asked.
“Yeah, whatever,” he sighed. “Bring on the ritual.”
. Now back off.”
“There’s something you should know,” Dean said, frowning. “Michael. He went to Heaven. He said—he said that the two of you could—well—” Make an evil baby? How do you even describe that? “If you have kids it could be the antichrist,” he blurted. There. He’d said it.
“How is that settled?” Decker spluttered
” blurted Dean, who knew enough about Michael after all that research for that first apocalypse, and then everything that came after, to fill a book. He even knew what
“Lucifer?” she asked.
Dean was kind of starting to get the hang of this. “It’s terrible,” he said gruffly and frankly it was: he was starting to see why Cas liked this place so much, Crowley shouting at him notwithstanding.
“And—you’re in the same room,” Dean said faintly. Pie-smelling Michael and Lucifer snuggling a beautiful woman and her daughter. What the Hell was this world, man.
“I don’t like how you keep taking bits from Castiel and not giving them back! Give me my dowel, please.” The last was a growl, and he held out his hand.
Lucifer made a sad, chirrupy angel noise at her as she moved away from him. To Dean’s absolute surprise, she whistled back, the way Crowley and Aziraphale had whistled.
“Uh, yeah,” said Dean. “I’m sorry, did you say
Crowley sighed. “Yeah. I’m going to leave Watchie here with you, okay? You can play fetch or something. No hurting my dog.” This was directed to Dean. He stood up.
“I don’t know,” said Cas, frowning. “But with the support of Angel Network behind him, maybe.”
Cas cocked his head thoughtfully. “It’s not far from here,” he said slowly. “Let me call Amenadiel about this, and then we’ll—investigate.” He looked at Dean, questioning.
“You certainly can,” said Aziraphale. “Now, while Lucifer is arranging for a safe house for Chloe and Beatrice, we’ll need one for both of you, as well. You are, of course, welcome to stay with us; we’re staying in the Sunset House. Crowley bought it from Lucifer last year.”
“I have friends,” Castiel said, bewildered.
and then the vertigo seized him again and he shut his eyes tight. The wind, blessedly free of sulfur, ruffled his hair. Cas beat his wings again so they bobbed in the air, and he really had to focus on not hurling.
. Cas, Billie has that plan to kill God with Jack. What if we twist it around? Killing God will upset the balance anyway. Do you think Jack can entrap him?”
. Like, way more awesome than Dean had expected. He’d learned that Cas’s wings had blades – how cool was that? – and how Cas’s powder down had coated his fingers. He’d fought with Crowley about that, but that wasn’t what he was doing here; he remembered pulling out the clumps, how Cas relaxed, and straightening the feathers, and how Cas relaxed more. It had been good, having Cas soft and sighing under his hands. He remembered how he went all puddly, how Aziraphale poked Cas ‘til Cas thrummed, what a good sound it was, how Dean could feel it in his chest—
“Cas?” Dean asked.
“Looks like,” said Dean. Cuddly? Seriously? Dean would use a lot of words to describe Crowley, but cuddly wasn’t one of them. People kept telling him about all the great things that Crowley had done, but all Dean kept seeing was a douchebag.
He’d been human, before. Or, well, he’d called it human. He’d been fairly sure he was human, with human weaknesses and foibles and tastes and feelings and everything. This was a half-life, for an angel, though he’d liked many aspects of it a great deal.
Dean made a kind of
“Have you gotten all you can from it?” Cas asked her gently.
“Yes, and also I hate her,” said Lucifer conversationally. “But she’s his match. And she’s very angry at him. I gave her a new universe for her very own with Azrael’s Blade. If I could just find her, find the entrance to her universe again, and tell her what Dad’s doing—there’s a good chance she’ll help. Dad is, after all, murdering all of her children. Angels,” he added to Chloe.  “She doesn’t much care for humans, though she definitely cares for my wretched siblings
He was definitely worried Dean would vomit again. How much could one human vomit? Had he broken Dean? He hoped not. Dean was his favorite human.
,” Aziraphale murmured softly from the chair. He was leaning on its arm, watching them. “He’s not wrong.”
From inside, there was a shout. “
Lucifer had gone inside. They were standing on this big balcony of an extremely swanky apartment. Cas had a wing half-extended again, and that demon was fussily fidgeting with his feathers. That was just—weird.
Such as, for example, setting a starving tiger on the captain of a Privateer ship sometime in the seventeenth century.
, and the reply was immediate.
“I eat here,” Cas said. “Different rules. I can taste here. It’s not all—molecules.” Dean tried not to be fond of that nose-scrunch, he really did. It didn’t go so well.
“Aziraphale,” Castiel said, not at all alarmed for some reason.
Sam, on the other hand, had a healthy correspondence with Aziraphale, and always kept an eye (and a nose) out for cocoa, which Aziraphale sometimes sent over when he thought Sam needed comforting. Letters from Daydream World were not so unusual for him.
Lucifer looked back at Chloe. She seemed puzzled. “Are you alright?” he asked softly.
Dean slapped the dowel into Crowley’s hand. “What the Hell do you know, anyway?” Dean snapped. “You’re a demon.”
Lucifer’s voice sniffed. “Uninspired nickname. Cast the spell, Pigeon.”
Oddly enough, that was kind of reassuring. Too bad it came from freaking
was very soft.
Yeah, he realized abruptly, he needed to talk to her. He slipped from Cas’s side.
. It’s not the kind of thing you can force.”
Banding together. That was nice.
Made to make an antichrist, he thought uneasily. Should he tell her? “So how did you get caught up in all this?” he asked instead. “I mean.
; he’ll be able to get out.”
“Daydream Lucifer loves Earth,” he said. “He doesn’t lie, and he will go to great lengths to preserve the life of a single innocent human. All of Hell marched in protection of one living human at his command. I was there for it. He is nothing at all like our Lucifer. All they share is a name and an occupation.”
They stood there.
A good sound
with him?” Dean blurted. “What the Hell demon tells you to see a therapist?”
“We don’t know that,” said the black angel.
“It’s only a theory, Chloe,” Amenadiel said apologetically. “But with Castiel’s information, on top of what we already know from Raguel—there might be some connection. You might be the reason our world still stands.”
Dean gave him a weird look. “What?”
“The right spell?” asked Chloe, coming in behind Dean.
“He did apologize,” Cas said.
Dean did trust Cas. He trusted Cas with his life. The thing was, Cas had made a lot of questionable decisions over the years.
Dean followed him down a hall. He was worried he was going to hear, like, loud sex or something, because of how loopy Crowley and Aziraphale had been, but there was no sound
“I’m driving!”
“Celestial hearing,” she said, rolling her eyes. “They’ll have a harder time hearing us out here, unless they snoop. Is Castiel the snooping kind?”
“Castiel, we will need more information from you,” Michael added, dark eyes fixed on Cas. “But later. First, we must find a safe place for Chloe and Beatrice. A paradox. A strong one.”
“Loneliness,” said Chloe. “Fear of abandonment. Low self-esteem. That’s what Linda said, anyway. Apparently, they started fighting. Not—not physically or anything, they would never, but over stupid things. It’s that low self-esteem. You can get by on monthly—Crowley told me once that you can do monthly—but it hurts them. It’s like being starved, I think.” She shook her head. “Crowley has no idea what he’s talking about
“Just tear it, Dean,” Cas said, gruff. “It does not hurt. It has been bothering me for some time.”
Dean blinked. That was good to know, and the guitar thing was an excellent idea. “I—am going to do that,” he said.
“I know,” Cas said.
“Shh,” said Michael, again.
Aziraphale chuckled. “Crowley and I have been on Earth for its entire history,” he said. “As we changed humanity, humanity changed us. He is remarkable, in truth, my Crowley. But don’t fret.” He met Dean’s eye. “He’ll warm to you. If Castiel has found it in him to love you, then Crowley will find a way, too. He’s a terribly soft heart, underneath it all.”
“Yeah, you are!” said Crowley cheerfully. He clambered up onto the railing of the balcony. Just watching him up there made Dean’s stomach turn. “It’s fine; it’s endearing. I was the same with Bakt. Let’s get out of here, yeah? Like ripping off a band-aid.” He jumped off the railing. Dean could hear his huge black wings flapping open below.
speaking legal but you’d really have to go looking to find it.”
“Michael Taxiarch.” His blue eyes twinkled with mischief. He didn’t rise but he leaned forward conspiratorially. “Means ‘brigadier,’” he said, like he was sharing a secret
“What is it, Amenadiel?” asked Aziraphale.
“So, I had a fight with Crowley,” said Dean, and he was suddenly reevaluating Crowley too; yellow eyed demon or not, Cas loved him, and also Crowley was capable of
Warm fuzzies gone. “Ouch,” said Dean, a little horrified. The thought of Cas’s hunter’s wings, with their incredible blades, cut in half like that—
“Good riddance,” agreed Cas.
“Oops,” Crowley said, and Aziraphale positively cackled.
Chloe smiled at him. “We really need to talk, you and me,” she said. “I’ve got questions and I’m sure you do too. What about Islington’s Cage?” This she directed to Lucifer.
“The angel who sank Atlantis. It’s in Heaven now. Crowley bit it – he’s venomous – so it shall be very ill for at least a decade, and even then, the other angels have it locked away. Michael made sure of it. Its Cage sits empty in London Below. I am its keeper, alongside an order of friars.” A beat. “I won’t really lock him away,” he added. “But I will be quite cross.”
“Thought so. What the Hell sort of name is Watchdog?”
This was why Cas was so bashful about the paradox, Dean realized in some corner of his mind. He knew it was like this. He’d tried to tell Dean it was like this but hadn’t had the words. Stupid Cas, he thought, very tenderly. Dean had even seen Crowley and Aziraphale like this and hadn’t made the connection.
“Uh,” said Dean. It wasn’t like he didn’t know Cas had wings. He’d seen their shadows. But knowing and seeing the real deal were two very different things. Dean tried not to gape. Folded, they reached down to Cas’s calves. They were brown but patterned in the red light of Hell. Under Dean’s gaze, they shifted, alive, and he met Cas’s eyes.
“Of course he does,” scowled Dean, glaring at the well-manicured grass in front of him. He did
It occurred to him, when Crowley caught his eye and glared from one of the sleek armchairs in the room, that none of these people thought
“Lucifer,” Castiel replied. Dean felt his spine go tense, his fists clench. He didn’t trust
“It won’t be safe,” said Lucifer, sounding horrified. “For either of you!”
“Yeah, yeah, I don’t believe you,” said the voice of the demon Crowley.
. Even alternate universe, bizarre Lucifer with wings. The kid kicked her legs again, smiling around the straw of her juicebox.
“Oh, no, not at all,” Aziraphale said. “We just happen to have more luck than you do, it seems.”
It was a weird thing for Dean, but definitely not sad. He watched Ella put a hand over her mouth.
Lesser Demon. Surgat was basically a chauffeur.
Dean nodded. “Alright.”
Cas groaned again. “Different Lucifer,” he said, “I was building you up to that too
“Nothing,” Aziraphale said, like an unhappy mom. “You do this dish beautifully, dear.” He managed a smile. “Castiel, would you like me to do your wings when we get back?” he said, changing the subject. “They can’t be comfortable.”
Cas had kind of expressed that too. “Okay,” he said, braced for this to go in an embarrassing direction.
Chloe nodded. “Lucifer was like that, too. It kind of does things to them. Psychologically, you know. Linda—she’s been trying to write up notes on angels. She had Aziraphale and Crowley do an experiment, once, where they skipped preening and they apparently nosedived. She stopped it after three weeks.”
Silence.
“Ticklish,” Cas muttered sullenly, and the concern melted. Dean laughed.
. Dean, who was, in fact, worse than Castiel, was snuggling back, tentative in the way only an extremely sexually repressed human male could be tentative. Poor thing probably still thought he was straight.
“I know you’re here for a reason,” said the voice. Dean burrowed closer.
“No,” Cas said. He rolled his eyes, “Just—” He reached out and, very gently, surprisingly gently, he took Dean’s wrist and pressed their palms together, before twining their fingers.
Anyway. I am like beyond delighted so surprise! Have another chapter. Happy whatever harvest festival you celebrate, and if you don't celebrate one, happy Thursday!!
.” She shrugged.
“You never said he was a prince of Hell,” Dean hissed at Cas, watching those yellow eyes warily.
Cas winced when Aziraphale clipped the feather, but otherwise didn’t complain. Not liking that flinch, Dean found himself petting the leading edge of the wing soothingly afterward, high towards the alula and away from Cas’s awesome blades. He breathed in the comforting dusty honey smell of the down, ordering the feathers gently. Cas kind of became a puddle on the chair, wing pressing upward into Dean’s hand.
Dean gave a grim laugh. “Yeah, guess I am. I don’t know. I don’t know enough about this world. I’d go after Chuck, if I could. If I can. He’s the root of it all.”
“Yes, the paradox, Michael!” Amenadiel cried. “The paradox hiding the house!”
“No,” Dean said, chuckling. Oh, Cas. “That’s a chick thing. I got this.”
“They all needed to know,” Crowley said, strolling out onto the balcony. It was warm and sunny, and his step was not at all urgent. “Lucifer will stop freaking out when people stop trying to hurt Chloe; a paradox will help. This triple paradox thing sounds a bit far-fetched, though.”
Look, Crowley had picked up Midsummer Night’s Dream like two weeks ago in the bookshop and he’d re-read it. Sue him, but it was on the brain.
“Dean,” said Cas, while Dean was brushing. Dean hummed at him.
“Zephyr,” Dean murmured. He leaned his chair back on two legs and held up the letter. “Feresne Crowlei, amabo te?” It always helped to be polite to the winds, after all.
“I know so,” Cas said. “I—spent some time with him, when I was here last. He was reluctant to even light a dark tunnel.”
“Go directly to the safehouse,” Lucifer told them. “We’ll be back soon.”
Cas opened the door, and something huge and black barreled out. This was surprising, since Hellhounds were invisible at home. It—well, it just looked like a really, really big dog, like a massive Doberman or something, and it bounced around Cas with delight. Dean blinked. What?
Cas made a funny
“What do you mean, do your wings?” Dean asked.
like he was a resident of this universe. He didn’t correct him. “Alright,” he said, “I’m game.”
“And Dean?”
“But,” Crowley was saying slowly, “If Him Above is destroying the alternate universes, what about
“I’m sorry, the archangel
“How did you figure this out?” Dean demanded.
-----------------------
on this thing was amazing. Wow. They really did have to do it again immediately.
“It’ll go to his head,” Michael drawled.
Cas, who had tucked his wings away to sit in the chair, tugged on Dean’s arm. He stretched it out and positioned it, elbow and wrist bent as if it were a wing, and then tapped on his wrist. It was touchier than he usually was. It was nice. “They slice here,” he said. “You never fly again.”
“Oh,” said the black angel, clearly realizing something.
Cas looked relieved. “I would like to shower when you are finished,” he said. “If they’re going to fix my wings, it—helps.”
“Pinion?” Dean asked.
They were meeting their ride in the Sunset House because apparently, nothing from Hell would be able to find Lucifer and Chloe’s paradox-warded house. This was kind of amusing, except that Lucifer was all glowing eyes and stiff back. He’d got his wings out at one point, and they prickled like pinecones, protective.
of what He deserves.”
“Don’t you look refreshed,” Lucifer leered, meeting his eyes.
“Alright! Alright. Come here, Lucifer,” said Chloe, rolling her eyes.
“Dean,” hissed Cas.
Jimmy be damned—Cas had some idea of what he was doing but not a whole lot, and he went gaspy and surprised when Dean hit it right. It was great. And those
Dean thought about this, about the mark of Cas’ hand that had once been on his arm. That was a tight bond. Cas had said so himself. Alright. That wasn’t so bad. He relaxed. “Weird properties?” he asked Cas.
“Apparently other people having sex is upsetting for humans, in some but not all circumstances,” said Cas.
By the time the chariot arrived, everyone was tense as anything, even Dean, and this wasn’t even his damned world. Lucifer perked up, though.
“Of course she is. It’s Daydream World,” Dean muttered.
She sighed. “I’m sorry everything went wrong, Castiel. You should definitely stay here. Less things went wrong here.”
“Can you trap him?” asked Beatrice, leaning on Lucifer’s shoulder, completely unafraid. “In like a crystal or something? Mom and Lucifer once trapped like a bazillion imps in a big water jug. If he’s trapped, he’s not dead, and the lights stay on.”
“Except for Raguel,” said Lucifer, who had migrated with Beatrice to what was definitely a
Dean nodded. “Yeah. He can paradox. I know. It’s alright, Cas.” Cas nodded. He shooed Dean up into the chariot and then followed.
“I’m mad that he was
“And the monsters?” growled Lucifer.
Cas looked back at him, impassive, but one of his wings twitched. Dean gave him bigger, sadder eyes—and then something thumped him. He jumped.
“I’m safe in this house,” insisted Trixie, very brave for such a small girl. “Three paradoxes all layered—nobody can touch me here. We need you to save everyone, mom.” She smiled, wobbly.
Cas scowled at him, but otherwise didn't argue.
thing, that was freaky, and it hurt somewhere in the pit of his stomach. Dean couldn’t—he could
but she let it lie. It was probably something terrible. Poor Nightmare World.
and Cas kept up with him, easy as breathing and apparently unconscious. Dean chuckled, pleased. If Crowley and Aziraphale hadn’t been over there, he would have busted out into song, but he didn’t, aware of the eyes on him.
“Then we’ll take our leave,” said Michael.
Got it.
His first one with Chloe had been absolutely spectacular, but they hadn’t been able to curl up together for hours. She’d been magnificent. Lucifer had ached, but he’d been afraid to touch her, afraid to tarnish her, for she’d shone so brightly. He hadn’t realized that the burning, ripping sensation in his chest had been because he’d been physically separated from Chloe until after they’d nestled together somewhere safe, and the pain had been soothed. The high had been amazing; he hadn’t been able to stop looking at her, but the fear of that day had crept up on him, distracted him. That paradox had been marvelous, and he would treasure it, but otherwise it had been a terrible bloody day.  Their subsequent paradoxes were better, though, and also included snuggles, so that was alright. Still, he was hardly going to put Crowley’s Pigeon through that sort of pain if he didn’t have to.
So, there were options here. There was a loveseat, but also there was an armchair. It was a big, ridiculous room. Anyway, Lucifer was all snugged up next to his human, so, presumably, that was an okay thing here. Dean wasn’t quite comfortable with it, but he
sound at him again. He sounded pleased. Dean was going to have to figure out what that meant.
“Oh, lay off him, you prat,” Crowley said casually. “Relax, no boinking necessary. He’s yanking your chain
“What is it with this universe?” Dean muttered.
“Um, I’m sorry, you listen to
to banter with people who weren’t Sam and Dean?
“Uh, we have to go through Hell for some reason?” Dean asked, not knowing what it meant.
“Lucifer,” Cas warned, almost a growl. Lucifer ignored him.
Cas gave him a weird half-smile and they strolled across the lawn and up to the door of the house.
Sam shrugged at him
“Something to do with my wings,” Cas muttered. He was embarrassed! That—was actually kind of glorious.
“It won’t,” said Dean darkly. “Not until we stop Chuck.”
Sammy would
“He’s a nutjob!” Dean spluttered. “I didn’t almost
. “That did not go very well, the last time I tried it.”
“Yeah,” said Dean. “About that.”
“I have no idea what any of you are talking about,” Dean grumbled.
Dean and Cas walked over. She had manipulated the angel’s arm so they could see it. The forearm was bruised and slashed all to Hell.  “Defensive wounds,” said Ella. She raised her arm as if protecting her eyes from an invisible blow. “And there’s some kind of—” She reached into her purse, rummaging. She pulled out a pair of tweezers. “Never know when these’ll come in handy,” she said lightly, and used the tweezers to pull something out of one of the wounds.
“You want me to high-five you?” Dean asked, skeptical.
Hold up, what?
“It’s much better,” said Cas.
“Course they are,” Crowley muttered peevishly. “I’ve had two thousand years to perfect them.”
“I think you’re prejudiced because she’s a demon.”
Lucifer until a few years ago. It wasn’t like he didn’t tell me all the time, but who would believe that? Anyway, I got there eventually. And I freaked out, of course.”
She listened. She frowned. “Pretty big order,” she said slowly, like she was commenting on something. “Oh,” she added with a nervous laugh, “You know, just came up in conversation. No, really.” She looked desperately at the dead angel. “Yep, totally normal conversation about angels busting out of Heaven. We’re, uh, in a park. You know. Chatting? I told Crowley about the universes, and the light. It sounds pretty bad.” She listened. She smiled. “We’ll figure it out, buddy,” she said earnestly. “We’re the best and the brightest, right? We’ve got Angel Network and the Nightmare Universe guys on it! They’ve faced worse stuff than this. We’ve got this.”
Of course, Lucifer had taken in Raguel’s dogs for now; he’d only just left that night. And of course, they liked Michael better, the traitors. They were shy creatures, beaten down. Apparently Raguel liked the sad ones. There were two more hiding in his bedroom. Lucifer would find homes for them.  Bloody Angel Network.
Dean looked at Watchdog, who was napping in a patch of sunlight, belly up. She kicked in her sleep. She didn’t look even a little bit threatening.
meant. It meant that this guy was a major douchebag.
or they go nuts.”
“Is this true?” Cas asked Amenadiel. They already knew this, of course, but it was good to hear it confirmed. Well, it was crap to hear it confirmed, actually, but still.
“Lucifer,” Cas hissed. Dean looked around, alarmed; at first, he thought Cas had seen him.
“What is
—” she growled, cut herself off. “Does Lucifer know?”
right now? Oh, wait, Cas was dude-shaped and Dean had made a lifetime out of shouting that he wasn’t gay to cover up the fact that he was way confused about the whole thing. Also, the body was Jimmy’s. Screw it. Jimmy was dead; it was just Cas in there and Cas was worth it. It would still be glorious. They’d figure it out.
“Yeah, we do,” said Dean. “He’s pissed because I’m not cooperating in his cute little story.”
“Uh,” said Dean, looking at Crowley. “What are you--?”
Yeah, Dean definitely felt it, like a tug to his heart. “We’re fine,” he said, gruff. He really was fine. It hurt, but he could walk away. There was work to do. Dean could work.
“There aren’t enough,” Cas said. “They’re needed in Heaven. They won’t attack either way.”
“Oh, he’s the best friend ever,” she was saying lightly. “Never mind that he’s the best to hang out with—he tells great stories, and he really listens, you know?—anyway, I get free drinks at Lux. That’s his night club. He also gives the
douche,” Dean agreed. “Like, major.”
Something in Dean wrenched hard, though he wasn’t sure what it was. Cas could have left them. The thought hurt. He could have left them at any time, and come here, where he was clearly loved. “Why didn’t you stay, then?”
“With him.” Dean jerked a thumb at Michael, who blinked at him placidly. “We’ll think of something. We always do.”
Beside Lucifer was another angel, shirtless and olive skinned, with orange wings. He was fidgeting with something that looked weirdly like a tootsie-pop wrapper. He said nothing, but he was looking at Crowley like he was expecting orders.
“No,” said Cas. He frowned. “That—can occur if an angel of high standing focuses too hard on an angel of much lower standing. The equivalent may be a shouted order – if an archangel were to shout an order too harshly on a lower angel, some of his joints might bleed a little
“There you are,” Cas murmured. “I see. Think about fixing them, Dean. Think about how it felt.”
“What, angel,” Crowley muttered.
“They’re a mess,” the demon said, and he actually sounded angry. What the Hell could he possibly be angry about? “He doesn’t fix his wings when he’s in your world for some reason. I suspect this reason is you.”
“No,” said Dean, abruptly switching gears entirely. “Where the Hell did you get one of those?”
“Liar,” said Michael. “I think I could do it, too, but you’d have to let me within ten feet of Dean Winchester.” He said Dean’s name with a weird relish
Twin guilty stares. Now that was something. Dean suppressed a laugh and did his best to look severe.
Dean was special. Dean belonged to him. Michael knew it. It would take some cultivating, but he wanted the human in his life. He’d even share with Castiel. He was good at sharing!
“Detective—” Lucifer gasped. He pulled Chloe’s hand close; those feathers were very sharp, they could cut through bone, they could—
“How do you know that?” asked Ella, for the first time, kind of reading Dean’s mind. It was a great damn question, because this was crazy, even by Dean’s standards and that was saying something. He felt Cas shift his weight next to him, restless.
The preened wing looked sleek and smooth. The other one was a mess. He hadn’t known what it was supposed to look like, before. Dean got to work, and he thought about Cas, Cas not doing this, Cas not fixing it. Hard to reach by yourself, probably, and there was the whole eyeball-burning thing, but they could have found a way. If Cas needed this, and he definitely did—it was clear he did—they could have found a way. He raked his fingers through the coverts and listened to Cas thrum, deep and soft. Happy noises. Happy noises that he was going to tuck close to his heart, frankly, and let’s not look at that too closely.
His cheeks went all red; that was adorable. What the Hell were they even talking about? “Michael. It is not—we are not—”
Crowley really should have been wearing his sunglasses, but he’d left them by the bed that morning, because he and Aziraphale had gone to fly together and greet the dawn. Then he’d got that weird letter from Castiel upon their windswept return, and it had all spiraled wildly out of control from there. Anyway, they were still upstairs.
. Cas was awesome, and he seemed very snuggly, and right now he was the best thing in the world, so Dean snuggled.
thing. Lucifer didn’t thrum like he did with a full preening, but he did get a little cuddlier. It was nice.
“That indicates sex, Dean,” Cas sighed.
Watchdog was standing on the other side, of course. She wagged her tail.
“I can’t stop him,” Michael said, shaking his head. “He does as he pleases. I recommend you stay hidden from him, Chloe.”
“Can I come?” Lucifer leered.
Wanting to be near. Wanting to be near always, wings folded close around this bright, marvelous little human—
On the other side, still singing, the Devil shook his head emphatically in a clear
“But it’s impossible,” the black angel, apparently called Amenadiel, said. “Ridiculous. Surely not.”
“It will cost you your wings if I can’t get in touch with Father,” said Michael. “I have no desire to be the Eldest, Amenadiel.” Now he opened his eyes and glared at Amenadiel. “I’ve seen what it does to me, in the other world. I don’t want to become that.” He closed his eyes again and took a big, showy breath. “I would rather die,” he said on the long, slow exhale.
“I’m going to fly us to the tear,” Cas said. He looked concerned, like Dean’s hatred of this place was all over his face. It probably was.
“Wake up and smell the whiskey, brother,” spat Lucifer, “He’s always been cruel!”
“They have a different accent,” Cas murmured, as if reading his mind. He must have had a weird look on his face. “Come on.”
What the fuck ever. Dean didn’t drop Cas’s hand, but he did step up to Cas, closer, and buried his face into Cas’s shoulder. Jimmy’s shoulder, but those gorgeous wings came up around him right away, warm and feathery and
Though he had to say that the weirdest was the last night, when a goddamn chariot pulled by two
Cas actually giggled, and it was the best sound ever. Dean giggled back, unable to do anything but grip his hand.
At least the Mexican food was good. Like, really good. Even Cas ate it. Apparently Aziraphale was a snob about food.
harder than Crowley’s entire outfit did. He looked like a goddamned club owner, or a high-class pimp. This was, admittedly, a very different look than the Lucifer of their world. Dean wasn’t exactly reassured, but it was – well – something to see so clearly that this one was different. He sang beautifully, though he scowled at Cas through it.
“Uh,” said Ella, coming up alongside Dean. “Is he okay?”
“Call her sometime,” said Michael. “She misses you.”
“Lucifer better treat you right,” Dean said, as he got his breath back. He got out of the seriously cool car, resisted his urge to look under the hood, and followed her inside, Cas at his back.
“Not at all, Dean,” Cas replied, a twinkle in his eye.
“You are not wrong,” said Dean, merrily, and he ran his fingers through the tertiaries again, amused. Cas settled, and Dean chuckled.
Cas blinked at Dean. He still looked very surprised. “Dean, if this is something he’s making you do—”
“Hmph,” said Crowley, who had clearly heard this exchange. He stalked right up to Cas. Dean tensed, but it turned out he didn’t need to; Crowley threw his arms around Cas’s shoulders, and then curled dark, feathered wings around him, too. A hug. An experienced hug from someone who knew how to hug, and how to hug with wings. Cas returned it, awkwardly, like he always did with hugs. Why did this demon know how to hug better than Cas did?
Dean huffed. “And you? Are you pissed too?”
It occurred to him that he was comparing paradoxes to sex. To better-than-sex, actually. Cas was thrumming away at Dean, who suddenly wanted to make that sound back, because he was feeling all lovey and happy and content too, and Cas should know that. He tried, but it came out all wrong, and Cas giggled at him, also stoned.
Crowley
, Detective? Are you insane?”
“Zachariah is the douchebag that took Raguel’s wings,” Ella said.
that. He’d been dying for a dog for years. And honestly, Dean might like that too—a Hellhound on their side, really on their side, would be awesome. “What are the odds we can get one for Sam?”
The sign had cracked some years ago and try as they might the city had been unable to fix it. Unbeknownst to them, in a few universes over where the rules changed
Cas chuckled. “Someday, I will,” he told her.
“Oh—no,” said Ella. “Belial’s Crowley’s secretary. In Hell, I mean. He’s a Greater Demon, like Crowley. Crowley apparently won him over by giving him a bunch of candy. Lucifer says that Belial is loyal to the bone once he likes you
“Stop!” This was Crowley. “You’ll upset—literally all the angels, okay, boss, not worth it. Castiel, why is Him Above destroying the alternate universes? There must be a story there. A reason.”
Humans had opinions about how they were carried? Belial always carried humans over his shoulders so he could hear them kicking and screaming, but he kind of thought that Castiel wouldn’t enjoy that.
Dean told him, as loud as he could. He shoved everything forward—rage and pain and confusion, he was so bad at feelings, so bad, and they were sticky and they landed in all sorts of places they weren’t supposed to, even the people he loved best, and he was sorry, he was sorry, he was sorry, he
Cas stormed into the kitchen, a letter crumpled in his hand. “Dean. He is panicking. What did you tell him?”
“That was
“He was trying to kill Crowley,” said Cas.
“You can call Amenadiel,” Aziraphale said. “Do not call Lucifer just yet. This is an act of war, and Lucifer has been so on edge that we risk him responding as such. Amenadiel will know what to do, and Amenadiel will be able to tell us why.”
They went down the stairs—tricky while holding hands, which was still girly but fuck it—and made it to what looked like a foyer. Lucifer led them back and around to a sort of living room full of sleek couches. Chloe Decker and her daughter Beatrice were sprawled on one of the couches, watching a movie.
Hang on.
Dean gagged again. Fuck it. “Fine,” he rasped.
Amenadiel snuggling Linda was just weird because. It was Linda. His therapist. And while she was a wonderful, generous lover, it was just a little bizarre to see her with his brother—his nestmate.
But also, some part of Dean thought, this was one Hell of an ally. He held out a hand.
“I’m dating the devil.”
Dean had no idea what they were talking about, but he was not a fan.
“Fine,” Dean muttered.
“I think it’s time for bed,” Cas said. “There should be other rooms?”
. Dean had a sneaking suspicion that that was another Hellhound, the one Ella had mentioned. So maybe the woman and the girl on the couch weren’t so normal after all, he thought, amused.
“Very good,” Aziraphale said. “Here is your next task; now that you’ve cleaned him up, you have to straighten his feathers. Like so.” He spread his fingers, and showed Dean how to do it, and how to use the smaller clumps to cover them with the remaining powder down in the process. “Tertiaries first,” he insisted, and Dean obeyed.
“Okay,” said Dean. Forensic scientist. Very handy. They needed to befriend one of those. Imagine what a forensic scientist could tell, if they knew about various monsters? Could cut out so much research. “So, he was diving out of Heaven. Didn’t use the pearly gate, so maybe he was breaking out? Rogue angel?”
Ella was right, he thought, looking up at the dead angel. It was kind of sad. Had someone preened this guy’s wings; had he gone soft and sleepy? Not that Dean particularly liked angels who weren’t Cas, but still.
“And Trixie,” Ella said casually. “Trixie’s also there. Not really? I’ve already been. It’s a really nice place with a big giant yard and stuff. Their Hellhound, Shepherd, is there too. I think Lucifer’s trying to make it as comfortable as he can, if they’re going to be stuck there. I mean, not being able to work is gonna suck for both of them. Chloe and Lucifer love working. Also, like, income is a problem. Chloe has a ridiculous amount of time banked, but still.” They crawled forward.
Sex was
Cas looked down, embarrassed. “They’re saying I dote on you,” he said.
Dean nodded slowly. “Alright. Hey, shouldn’t we be worrying about, you know, the end of the universe?”
“Not mad? No insanity? No little rats scratching at your brain?” Lucifer asked, slanting an accusatory glance to Castiel. Castiel didn’t notice, as all his attention was on Dean.
“No, you just—oh for Whoever’s sake,” Crowley muttered. “It’s fine. We’ll fix it. Took me a while, too. Boss! We’re nicking Castiel and his human. Call when you need us.”
Ella swallowed.
It occurred to Dean as they reached the stairwell, that Watchdog wasn’t so much following them as monitoring them. She wasn’t bouncing and wagging her tail like she had before. She was doing her job. She was watching them—being sure they didn’t attack her demon. She and Aziraphale were behaving as if Dean were the threat, here
“Oh, now he joins us,” Dean drawled.
“Uh, not a witch,” said Dean.
Dean blinked. “What?” he said intelligently. There was a kid? Where did a kid come from?
“Aziraphale!” cried Cas. He sounded panicked, panicked enough for Dean’s breath to catch. Without another word, Aziraphale bolted from Dean’s side, and Dean was hot on his heels. He didn’t like that note of fear. Behind him, Ella scrambled to keep up.
Dean still had no idea what he was talking about. He looked to Cas, but Cas only shrugged at him.
“This is dangerous,” Cas whispered, pulling away a little
“Very little,” Cas admitted.
“Excellent. Place your left hand here, please.” Carefully, Aziraphale stepped over to one side and then rested his hand at the top of Cas’s huge, spread wing. “This is called the leading edge. It’s essential for flight. It’s also where you push to fold the wing.” He took his hand away and arched an eyebrow.
“Alright,” he said. “Alright, Cas.”
“Stop,” said Decker, tugging lightly on Lucifer’s feathers. “That’s enough. I want to—” she swallowed. “So, what’s this going to look like? Some kind of—of safehouse? Can I still work?”
“Crowley tells me that angels who spend a lot of time on Earth sort of—make friends. But one human is special.” She shrugged.
This was an angel thing, Trixie knew. Lucifer spluttered and made a fuss, but he liked it when you pulled on his feathers. Not enough to hurt, of course, just as like a fidgeting thing. Crowley and Aziraphale liked it, too. Trixie had gone to a cave on a field trip, once, and she’d seen a bunch of bats all clustered together at the roof of it, jostling and snuggling. She thought it was kind of like that—a friendly thing, a
“I’m not sure,” muttered Cas.
“He’s pissed because I won’t kill my brother,” Dean said.
“Are you alright?” Cas called, and there were twin thumps, like two people who were making out falling over.
?” Lucifer screeched, because it was Lucifer, of course.  “Is Crowley alright?”
Materials. Dean had thought he could whittle something, and he probably still could, in a pinch. He knew how to do that. But he was kind of getting what Aziraphale was saying, that you had to put some effort into this thing. This was significant. This was an angel thing. It would ultimately make Cas make that strange thrumming noise, which he should never stop making.
“Your world is terrible.”
“I meant besides a Fall,” she said softly. “Like, say, an order.”
” growled another voice.
The world faded back in slowly. Someone
“Because Love is always better than Hate,” Ella chirped, like that made any sense. “That’s the difference, you know. Our Universe got Love. Yours got Hate. Bada-bing-bada-boom, better universe.”
Cas didn’t argue, but he seemed to get what Dean was trying to do. Sure enough, after Dean sat, Cas leaned up and into him, just a little. Dean leaned back, pleased. How had he dismissed this as brotherly? How? How had he ignored it, denied it, refused it? Abused just like Cas was.
“Well, it won’t work then,” Lucifer drawled. “You need the full cock. It’s Dad.”
. He was still looking wistfully at Dean. Dean could probably give a report now, but Cas was gazing at him like he was the best thing he’d ever seen, and it was kind of making Dean feel wobbly somewhere in his stomach. Screw it. Dean would take that half-hour; reports could clearly wait, on wonderful, peaceful Daydream World.
It wasn’t like thrumming, it was a weird floaty feeling, just there near his heart. Kind of silvery, though of course he couldn’t see it. Dean balked at first, startled, but then Cas made a small sound in his throat, distressed.
Cas nodded. “Alright.” He looked at Dean and tilted his head, indicating that they should go outside. Ella followed, and they left Aziraphale to care for Crowley. Everything from his protective posture to his flashing eyes told Dean that this was exactly what Aziraphale had wanted. He trailed behind Cas, back out the front door. Once they were out, Cas hid his wings. Cool trick.
“You can’t turn it off,” said Cas. “I never turned it on.”
Cas nodded. “It’s an extra sense in this world. It’s strange to get used to. We can sense when something or someone is beloved. Your car, for instance,” he said, a little sly. “If it were here, I would be able to feel how you love it.”
a ball. It was trembly all over. Cas couldn’t hide the anxiety this close, worries of pain or rejection, that he might hurt or coerce Dean by accident, that Dean might be frightened.
“Lucifer lies,” said Dean. “Also, that Chuck’s destroying alternate universes.”
Cas led him through the door and down a short hall. “Say the word, Dean,” he said. “I would love to.” It was clear that he meant it, clear that he was dying to live here even, with his friends. Dean thought about it as they crossed into a large dining room/kitchen, where sure enough Crowley had made some kind of massive omelet-like dish.
than you ever could.”
It was the getting him to like you that was the tricky part. Usually kindness did the trick, a strange, rare thing in Hell, but Crowley had won him over with sweets, too. Who knew?
“Send a letter when you need me to open it again,” Sam said. He was closing the door behind them, because Cas didn’t know how long they’d be gone.
“Oh, Crowley burns hot. I burn cold. I’ve been told that I’m the more dangerous of the two of us.” He smiled. It wasn’t a nice smile.
And he thought of those soft wings, Cas’s happy thrums. He swallowed.
Cas smiled at Dean, just little. “We should go inside. They’ll be waiting. Crowley’s probably made eggs. He makes them when he’s stressed.”
“Well met, Surgat,” Lucifer said gravely
Lucifer. Dean should have clocked his location right away, but he'd been distracted by all the wings and the hugging, so wildly out of character from a demon. Now, he turned to him.
“We should do that again,” said Cas, eyes bright with wonder. “Immediately.”
Sam kind of inferred that when Cas said, “building you up,” he actually meant, “Putting It Off.”
“Divinity is different here?” Dean asked. He hadn’t noticed anything.
“Paradox,” said Cas quietly, a little reverently, at Dean’s side. “He didn’t make the paradox.”
” he added severely to Cas, “It builds up and can cause terrible discomfort, and it can twist your coverts as well. This, for example, is a disaster.”
Crowley would definitely not know what to do, but he would shout, so Castiel was right about that at least.
. “Yeah, yeah,” he grumbled. Cas fussed at his clothes, fixing where they were askew. Preening, Dean realized, that was preening again. How had he missed this? He reached out and ran his fingers through Cas’s feathers, the ones that had gone crooked, and he fixed some of Cas’s clothes, too.
“No,” said Amenadiel, shaking his head. “No, I—I won’t either. But—” he thought about it, forehead wrinkling. “If we can stop him from coming here at all, if we can hide ourselves, perhaps we won’t need to.”
She gulped and stepped back. “Yeah. Who would do this? Crowley would never hurt anyone!” Suddenly she straightened. “Is there a body? The angel you killed, I mean. I’m a forensic scientist. Maybe there’s a clue.”
?” Dean blurted again. “I thought you trusted this guy? Cas?”
“Michael says that you can’t stop Chuck from coming here, but that you—inhibit him, a little,” Cas added to Chloe. “It’s why He’s sending angels instead of coming himself.”
The bunker, the Impala—home was in the other world, but this place seemed so peaceful. A place where Lucifer and Michael had a truce, one strong enough to let them sit calmly in the same room. Where Lucifer had a girlfriend, and said girlfriend came up to Dean looking casual and hot and unafraid. He wasn’t sure he trusted that yet, but Cas clearly did, and that went a long way.
“That would be appreciated,” Cas said, firm.
“We are nearly extinct, in our world,” said Cas.
“What?”
Small Corvette engine, maybe, he thought. Turbocharged, even. Dean was fairly certain her work was masterful. The car fairly purred. If he could just get a look under the hood—
“It takes more energy at home than it does here. This world is more malleable. The others—some use it more, some less.” He tapped the counter again, thinking. “Crowley and Aziraphale do it the most, so perhaps I imitate them. Lucifer and Amenadiel don’t use it at all. I’m told Amenadiel once brought a man back to life and it went poorly, so he is wary. Lucifer—” He shrugged. “He says it has something to do with Chuck. Raguel has no powers, and I don’t know Michael at all.”
as if surprised, and pushed up into his hand.

Dean grinned, because he’d got Cas to say sex. “Here’s different, though,” he said, slowly. “I mean.” He waved at Cas’s wings, because he could see them and stuff.
“Cas,” Dean hissed, “what the Hell is this paradox thing, anyway?”
Whatever.
“Shh,” said Michael, eyes closed. “I’m picking up on something. Feels like eggs.”
. It—happened often, in Nightmare World.”
“I’m fine; I was not expecting that.” He let out a breath. “You’re supposed to push it closed.”
There were so many things wrong with that statement, Dean didn’t even know where to begin. What the fuck was a nestmom? Instead, the words that came out of his mouth were, “You’re mad that I hurt his
“I did not wish to see you blinded, Dean!” Cas snapped back.
She nodded. “I think so,” she said, but she said it with confidence.
It was about 15 minutes.
Cas blinked. “Yes,” he said.
“Absolutely baffling. I’m going now.” The door clicked shut.
. It was alright, though—more than alright. It was a good in a way Dean couldn’t quite define, excellent even, pressed close on this couch. He was incredibly comfortable, and being this close to Cas felt
“The house is hidden by those paradoxes,” Ella chirped. “But this is where they are.”
“With cases in between, though, dude,” said Dean. “Something to do.”
“What do you do about it?” Chloe asked. She seemed genuinely curious, too, like she had been thinking about it for a while. Who knew? Involved with someone like Lucifer—she probably had.
“Thank you,” Aziraphale breathed. He was shaking a little as he wrapped his arms around Crowley, taking his weight from Cas. “Pigeon. Thank you. You very likely saved his life.”
“Uh-huh. Mostly he does it because he likes following Chloe around like a puppy, you know, but I think he really started to actually like it for what it was.”
“Cas?” Dean asked again, alarmed. He was acutely aware that the alien feathery thing he was holding in his hand was part of Cas and maybe this was more than he’d signed up for.
he must know that, he must—
That was doable, because fixing them had been
, I found more information on the miracle that made Detective Decker.  It was intended to make Lucifer human, or human enough to produce another Antichrist. But the power required for something like that—it affects other Celestials, too.”
“Saving the lives of two humans? Yes, Dean, that was the important war-meeting,” Cas said, his voice warm. “Death happens—less, here. Human lives hold more meaning. And it is important for Amenadiel to know about Chuck.” He paused. “And Michael, I suppose.”
Dean chuckled. “Am I insulted if you fall asleep?”
“Lucifer always does the opposite of what He wants. But if we don’t tell him, he might jump into a war without knowing all the facts and—well—” she gulped again.
Cas pinched his nose. “An angel who hasn’t left the nest. Crowley, we are the same age.”
” This was clearly Enochian, though a word Dean did not recognize, “Eat. You’ll feel better with some food in you.” He looked at Dean. “You too. You must be hungry. You’ve been sick quite a lot. You need your strength.”
“My world is terrible,” said Dean, wry.
“Always,” said Cas fiercely, a vow. “What can I do?”
“You’re telling me
Read: Lucifer. Lucifer Morningstar was making a lot of noise nearby. Lucifer Morningstar had a lot of opinions about people doing gunpowder-and-pudding paradoxes on his front lawn, even if it did strengthen the wards. It was a good thing, too, because the complaining was distracting Castiel, just a little. Just enough.
“They get very affectionate after something like that,” Cas said, shrugging. “Apparently it happens to Lucifer and Chloe, too.”
“Yes, hello, Aziraphale,” Cas said, very warmly, accepting a hug. He even seemed pleased about it.
“We have time for me to give you a piece of my mind,” snapped Crowley. “You’ve been treating my eyas like dirt and I am calling you out.” He smoothed down some of Cas’s feathers carefully.
And Cas hadn’t been doing it for years. “What happened?”
“No,” whispered Ella, eyes fixed on the body.
Lucifer chuckled. It looked like the time had done him good, too. He seemed less likely to break things, which was surprising, given that he was Lucifer. “Oh, relax, Pigeon, I have my own. Mine’s better. I have no need for your little hedgewitch; keep him.  Chloe is a great believer in monogamy anyway, more’s the pity. Shall we go downstairs? They’re waiting.”
“Demon,” Dean gritted around another wave of nausea. “
“This is not something I’m supposed to tell them, is it?” asked Cas in a hiss.
“It’s—easier here,” he said, apropos to nothing. “I can make you more clothes. If you need them.”
“He’s not,” said Castiel. “The rules are different here. Very different. It’s a coincidence. He’s a snake at heart, Dean, that’s all
“You have a retirement plan,” said Dean with a slow smile.
Dean was wide awake. “What do I need to do?”
Dean sighed. He regretted telling her. “We should go back in.”
“Dean, Watchdog,” said Cas, clearly amused. “Watchie, this is Dean Winchester. He is my friend. Human, but a hunter. I think you call them hedgewitches, here.”
“You need more time,” Lucifer said, looking back and forth between them. He had his wings out, all ruffled and he looked
Car man?”
He was a douchebag in every world. Some things were constant. Chuck had a weird sense of humor.
Cas showed the letter to Dean. “Do you know what this means?” he asked gravely.
Dean took a step back.
Dean stumbled out of bed, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. He opened the door. “What?”
“Oh, not that again,” muttered Crowley from somewhere.
“You are,” Aziraphale told Cas’s back, “the most ridiculous creature. Stop, stop, stop.” He poked his back with a finger. “It’s
“Crowley is my master,” said Belial, lifting his chin. “I came to help.”
“No pain?” Cas asked urgently.
“Loopy?” Dean muttered.
for you to make that pain worse by abusing him, do you understand?”
It wasn’t so much bravery as it was stupidity.
“So!”
were Cas. Dean leaned into him and nuzzled. Cas thrummed at him, and Cas should always be thrumming, always, every day. It resonated in Dean’s chest, the perfect sound.
Dean looked him up and down, from his frowning, familiar face to the foreign, fluffy wings on his back. “You like it here,” he said. This was obvious, but it deserved saying.
Cas nodded.
” snapped Crowley. “Where were
now?” Dean blurted. “Alternate Lucifer, whatever.” He had no idea who Mazikeen was, but it didn’t sound good.
“He’s trying to get in touch with our Father,” said Amenadiel. “When he knows perfectly well that our Father has not been in Heaven in
“You sure he wasn’t lying?”
“Who,” Aziraphale demanded, dark and surprisingly dangerous, running his fingers through Crowley’s feathers.
“Alright!” said Lucifer, hopping off his stool. “I have a house that will be suitable for just this purpose. And I’m not telling any of you busy bodies where it is. Crowley, Aziraphale, I’ll give you a call when we’re ready. Pigeon, get your act together and boink your human so you can cast the paradox, will you?”
“So,” said Dean. “Someone yelled at him and he jumped to the order – so fast that he didn’t bother with the pearly gates and smashed through the First Sphere.”
And then there was Lucifer, sitting cross-legged on the floor with the rest of them and clearly annoyed about it. Chloe was next to him, and he’d curled a ruffled wing around her too. He looked ready to jump out of his skin. They were all taking a risk, out in the open like this. It was a tense dinner, but it was kind of important that their ride actually find them. Dean wasn’t really sure what Crowley and Aziraphale were doing here, though. They should have gone to the safe house for sure, but it looked like they were being stubborn
“Yeah, we’re just gonna teach you how to do it, Pidge,” said Crowley, coming nearer. Dean tensed and coughed around the nausea. He didn’t like the demon so close when he was down. “I don’t know why this always falls to me
That was
Castiel!”
Sammy wasn’t happy about it, and neither was Dean, but he did the ritual to get them to Hell. Castiel marched through the door like a soldier off to war.
“Oh, no,” whispered Ella, stopping the car mid street. She swallowed. “That’s—I think that’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.”
Michael swallowed. He opened his eyes and fixed them on Dean, serious and sad. The pie smell intensified. What even was that? Smelled
“Lucifer, didn’t you say she tried to kill me?” Chloe asked.
“I once saw Chloe and Lucifer trap Amenadiel, when he was under a spell,” Castiel said softly. “Frightfully powerful, to capture an angel like Amenadiel. He is the Eldest, in this world. It’s like trapping Michael in ours.”
“Yeah, but he’s a demon,” said Dean. He could be lying. It was easy to lie in a letter.
“We have a truce,” said Michael, still patting the dog beside his chair. Looked like some kind of pit bull. “We both like the world.”
“Uh—wait—” said that second voice, the one that Dean suspected was Crowley. “Pidge, healing works differently here. Will you let me do it?”
“You are not a spell ingredient,” Crowley told him firmly. “You are Castiel. What do you think he is, a walking apothecary?” He glared at Dean, rage rising in his posture.
, and not the other way around.
“Sandalphon destroyed Gomorrah,” Aziraphale told Dean and Cas in an undertone.
Apparently.
Lucifer looked into Chloe’s eyes, worried, but he saw only his Detective. He twined their fingers, sparked the smallest paradox; saw Castiel grimace, and Surgat retch a little. Chloe gave him a small, confused smile, though of course she responded: love and wonder and delight curled around his heart, made his breath catch. There was no faking that. He squeezed her hand a little, relieved and wanting the contact. It was such a small paradox that the high was hardly more than a joyful a leap of his heart, but it was still good. She was still herself, and leaning into him affectionately. Just—not injured. Just the smallest scratch when there should be a gash—
. You pulled back. Where are you?”
“She won’t like that at all,” said Lucifer. He looked back at Chloe. “She’s our best bet, darling.”
Cas looked like he was actually considering this. What the Hell? “Cas,” Dean hissed. “
Dean shrugged. “They’re under Rowena’s thumb. They won’t bother us either.” Chloe in Nightmare World, keeping Chuck away while they looked for a solution, was not sounding like a bad plan.
Gentle soul, Dean thought. Cas always said that Crowley had a gentle soul.
“We’ll think about it,” said Dean. “I can bring it to Sam. And—” he blinked. “And Jack.
One day, Dean thought, amused, he was going to meet this Maze. He strolled past Chloe and back into the living room. He found Lucifer and Cas huddled together, talking urgently. “What’s this about Lucifer coming back to our world?” he asked.
Cas chuckled. “Someday,” he said, “someday.”
They roared down a side street, and then another, and then another. Dean was pretty sure all LA suburbs looked the same. Finally, they pulled up on a patch of grass—an empty lot. Amenadiel was there, and so was Michael. Dean shared a look with Cas in the rearview and got out of the car.
“He’s a prat and you know it,” Lucifer told Amenadiel, amused.
“Yeah, He’s not big on making sense,” Dean replied, dry as dust.
Three kinds of demons. That sounded damn exhausting. There were probably three different ways to kill them, too. Jeeze. “Yeah,” said Dean. “Only imps, I guess. Well, and Lucifer. We had a Lucifer, but he was a major dick.” Understatement.
Lucifer looked at Chloe. Chloe shrugged.
. Did you really think I was just going to let you show up here and make a fool of yourself? Besides, nobody lets Lucifer out in the open in the Eighth Circle by himself, the lucky bastard. Too many monsters. Belial! Go fetch the king! Castiel’s here! I’ll have you know,” he added, back to Cas apparently, “that Azazel is currently hiding somewhere in the Fourth Circle. This is his second breakdown this millennia. Apparently, this is a record. I’m blaming you, Pigeon.”
. “Well, he can’t have her,” he snarled.
Lucifer hugged his girlfriend and Beatrice closer and fluffed his feathers proudly. What even.
Ella perpetually owed Michael a knuckle sandwich. She wasn’t stupid enough to pick a real fight with an archangel, but she did glare at him a lot.
? Dean shot an alarmed glare at Cas.
He offered his hand reluctantly, and she took it, rising. “Thanks for dinner, guys.”
“It’s really bad,” Dean said dryly.
“We—tried it once,” he said slowly. “Kind of a half-cocked plan, though.”
and humans fought
“Sit,” said Chloe, quiet and civil, perfectly normal. “Tell us what happened. Can I leave yet?”
Dean watched Cas put his cheek against Amenadiel’s shoulder and give a heartfelt sigh. That was a surprising gesture of trust, though Dean chastised himself; he should know this by now. Cas trusted these people. “Me too. I know you spoke yesterday, but I’d like to introduce you to Dean?” He pulled back and beckoned Dean over. “Dean, this is Amenadiel. He’s the Eldest. He was also Eldest in our world, but he was killed in the first Rebellion; Michael took his place when Lucifer Fell. He is the highest-ranking angel in Heaven.”
“Go upstairs and get changed,” Aziraphale told Dean gently, because he was still wearing a sleep shirt. “And then we shall go.”
--------------
Stepping from the master bathroom, another angel, shirtless, olive skinned with great orange wings, glared at Dean out of deep dark eyes. Those wings rose a little and fluffed out, an aggressive move if Dean ever saw one, for all that the guy was wiping his hands on a tiny little towel. He was kind of familiar, too. This one had met them in Hell, hadn’t he?
“He is very different from our Lucifer, Dean,” Cas said, a little apologetically.
“What’s that?”
“What do you mean, vessel?” Ella asked, mimicking Dean’s tone. She frowned. “I feel like Crowley mentioned this, once.”
“Yes,” said Aziraphale without missing a beat. “If he has wings, then he needs it. If Castiel has never preened him I am going to lock him in Islington’s Cage until he thinks about what he’s done.”
messy. There were reasons they stuck to paradoxes and games. He and Aziraphale woke up, stared at each other, and laughed themselves silly while stumbling to the shower. “Why did we do that?” Aziraphale had wailed, amused, as he rubbed conditioner into Crowley’s hair.
“What
The feathers smoothed, and those dark eyes went to Cas. “Castiel,” he said, low like a growl.
“Lucifer works murder cases,” Dean echoed.
“Not far,” said Cas. “This way.” He set off on foot.
“Not if you like them?” Cas asked. “I’ve stayed in the bunker for—weeks—?”
“Privacy! Got it! I’ll go pick up some lunch. Call me when you’re done!” She bounced away, back to her car. Dean watched her go, bemused.
They were absolutely being stubborn. Heaven and Hell were terrifying but Castiel and Lucifer were important, okay, and they would see them off, come Hell or High Water. Aziraphale was fiercer than he looked and Watchdog was with them. They would be fine. Probably.
“Here’s something you’re not understanding,” said Lucifer, eyes narrowed. “I know about your body count, Dean Winchester.”
Dean stared at her and then laughed, quietly. “You say that like my life isn’t already a shitshow,” he said.
Chloe thought about this. She looked down at Trixie, clearly thinking and thinking hard
“You have no idea how to do this, do you?” Dean asked, wry.
“The Hell?” Dean asked Cas.
“Michael has the gift of foresight,” Aziraphale said lightly. “He tends to be correct about these things.”
Cas chuckled. “Spell ingredients are useful,” he said.
Pigeon? You think Chloe treats Lucifer that way? Or that Abida did that to Aziraphale? Linda
“You okay?” Dean asked, startled. The wings were attached to Cas, of course, and they’d moved before but—it was different. The wing was warm and
Castiel didn’t bring up the Left Hand thing because it had nothing to do with Crowley’s appearance and also nothing to do with his personality. Right now, it would only worry Dean. Best to tell him later.
Aziraphale paused and looked at him thoughtfully. There was approval there. Dean felt like maybe he just scored a point, somehow. “I can get you something,” he said lightly.
. “Amenadiel says it was God’s order, and we believe God was attempting to start a war here, and an apocalypse. Dean, your hair smells wonderful.”
“Trixie!” hissed Chloe.
Dean nodded, still feeling bewildered. With one last backwards look at Cas, he went upstairs.
“I’ll explain later,” Cas muttered. He sounded embarrassed.
“Watchdog won’t actually hurt you, Dean,” Cas said from the chair, exasperated. “She doesn’t hurt humans.”
“So,” he asked, “What’s your Lucifer like?” He hadn’t spoken to him for very long, after all. She’d said he was a good friend, that he listened, before, and that was—mind boggling.
“I’m sorry, did you just say Dad ordered an angel to attack my Left Hand as an act of war to start an
“Paradox!” she beamed.
“She’s very friendly,” Cas said, doggedly.
It went on, and on, and on.
“Castiel!” gasped the strange angel. “You made it!”
“That’s where he threw you,” Chloe murmured. Lucifer nodded, wordless, eyes fixed on hers. “But this isn’t about revenge,” she said quietly. Dean was kind of astounded; she held Lucifer rapt, still, and calm. The Lucifer from home would have been spitting and snarling, rambling. “This is about safety. If you make it about revenge, Lucifer, you’ll make a mistake. We need to think.” She gave a little, kind of shocked chuckle. “About trapping
“And that is—worth letting every other universe die?” the black angel asked, pained. It was not accusatory. It was sad.
Dean looked around the empty lot. That was some pretty good warding. Lucifer had said there were demons in the street – Lesser Demons and Hellhounds – but he didn’t see anyone. “Okay, that’s one question.”
“Yeah, probably.” She sighed explosively. “This is so—” She cut herself off and got to her feet, paced two quick laps. “So typical. Just—the level of—
It was also—Cas. Those wings were Cas. Not Jimmy. Something in Dean clenched, a little, at the realization. This was the angel, not the vessel. His angel, kind of – the one who answered his call and hung out in the bunker and smiled. He petted the coverts, a little struck with it. They were very soft.
He came up on the stone again, kicked it. Watchdog lunged to catch it
; apparently, they didn’t grow back until the next molt, whenever that was.
how is this my life?”
There was a breeze, from nowhere, rushing through the kitchen. It had a bite to it, like the first whiff of winter. This was a familiar bite: after all these years, Dean could recognize Boreas by temperature alone, even if he couldn’t see the creature itself. A letter, old, heavy parchment, appeared from nothing and fell gracefully to the table. Dean blinked at it, startled.
Next to Dean, Cas shuddered.
“I’m fine,” growled Dean, “just give me a minute.”
“Yours is more so,” said Aziraphale, watching Watchdog run. “Now. What were you thinking for this dowel?”
“Great, let me tell him,” she said. She sounded really pissed. Which—wasn’t quite what Dean had expected, somehow. He’d expected, like—angst, not anger.
“Fair point,” she replied. “How are you feeling? I was a bit freaked out after my first paradox
The thing was. The thing was. Dean actually knew this. Cas had even said as much before. And he knew he loved Cas, too. And normally he wouldn’t find the words, but just now, safe under Cas’s wing—“I do too. Love you.” That was hard to say, but important. “And. And same. I’m not good at this stuff, Cas. I haven’t even been good to
Michael had said.
“Good,” said Dean, again.
Dean followed Cas to the door. “Eggs?”
version of Lucifer, no matter what Cas said. This whole
Dean slammed his eyes shut, and he reached for that funny, silvery floaty thing. It was like—a little ball, or a little creature curled
Beatrice—Trixie—was waiting for them by the door. “Lucifer’s going to do something stupid again,” she announced, on no uncertain terms. “I think Castiel is enabling him.”
“The good demon,” Dean murmured thoughtfully. Cas always said
Lucifer thought about this. “As lovely as that sounds, I don’t think we could hold him indefinitely. I also want my Detective to have a life.” He stroked Chloe’s knee. “Which might be difficult if we have to continually maintain it.”
This was a blatant lie. Aziraphale was terrified about the end of the world! This was a much better distraction!
“Dean,” said Cas, grave and soft. “I have been yours from the start.” His wing fluttered a little, pleased
“Your humans are not Dean,” said Cas. A cool hand rested on his back.
Both Amenadiel and Linda's uncertainty made their paradoxes rather unpredictable. They would get there, with time.
Did it count as gay if Cas was technically not a dude? Because he really, really wasn’t—Dean could see that now. Cas was a dude because Jimmy was a dude. Cas didn’t have a gender at all; he wasn’t human, and still didn’t really get it, though he tried. Cas was a fucking—a tornado, a hurricane, a force of nature. Forces of nature didn’t have genders. Cas should stop trying; he didn’t have to try just to fit, if he didn’t want to, if it didn’t come naturally
Two chapters! Because they're both real short :D
“What did you tell him?” Sam asked.
“Ugh, because the Volvo was
but Dean felt like an idiot saying it like that.
Chloe, on the other hand, felt her spine stiffen in alarm. Dean had killed Alternate Lucifer?!
“And if you have sex, keep it down,” Lucifer continued blithely. Dean choked. “The Detective says that it’s upsetting for the spawn, but the little urchin has shown no indication, so I have no idea what she’s talking about.”
Cas sighed. “Let’s go, then. Dean, I’m going to need to carry you again.”
Angel Air was
Dean didn’t know how to explain it, how to explain that he was strong enough to endure something as stupid as this, of course he was. It sucked the big one, but he was going to live. Besides, that was
“Yeah, Lucifer said you do strategy, right?” Ella asked, glancing in the rearview. They inched closer to their exit.
“Ask Lucifer,” Cas said. “Or Crowley. When he’s not—” he waved a hand down the hall.
“No,” said Michael, but he sounded uncertain. The dog next to him whined.
“Yeah, he’s learning, no excuses,” said Crowley. He strolled from Dean’s side and tapped Cas on the head with the second baton, playful, before passing it to Aziraphale.
--it didn’t bear thinking about. There were, like,
“Crowley,” he said slowly, “How do I--?”
“What do you mean, use this stuff?” Crowley asked.
. But this angel was fussing at Cas very kindly, and Dean liked anyone who treated Cas well.
“Well, that’s never good,” Ella sighed. “No offence,” she said to Dean. “Where’s Crowley? Wait, if you’re here, is Castiel here? I haven’t met him yet!”
Chuck couldn’t touch it either.
“I—don’t know you,” Cas said, frowning at overalls-guy.
He felt it in his chest.
“And he’s just—killing everyone—because you won’t--?”
“No!” Ella rolled her eyes. “Helping people. Catching the bad guy. He’s got a thing about punishing the guilty.”
“You, too,” Michael said, looking dead at Cas. “You should cast one, too.”
“No kidding! You should stay here.” Ella nodded to herself, like that was her final decision.
That was weirdly familiar. “You know,” Dean said dryly, “the Lucifer that I knew liked to explode people.”
“Huh,” said Dean.
“Perhaps you should try reaching back,” said Cas stiffly
Meanwhile Cas is alive by the skin of his teeth. He is also kind of stupid haha.
Cas perked up.
Dean was a little freaked out. But Michael had said he’d be scared, and fuck that guy, so he was determined to not be scared. Also, he didn’t like Cas this worried.
