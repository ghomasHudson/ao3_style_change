‘’Right, okay. Just tell us when you need a break.’’
Not the slightest movement.
‘’I know… ‘’
‘’Dean could you not stop stroking my head? It helps with the pain.’’
‘’What’s wrong?’’
They both looked at Gabriel.
‘’He’s not an 8 year old anymore Dean, I can assure you that the older he gets the more he’s gonna complain about it.’’
‘’Noami.’’ He answered
badly that paying the teachers off to spy on their son was a choice they choose to make.
The Empty smiled creepily.
''That's not true, think you're a great role model. You're really good with people, and if Sam is so smart, you helped him get this far, without your support and
Louise yelled and aimed the gun at him but Castiel was faster and he grabbed an angelblade of the tray.
After 43.530 seconds the door of the back of the car opened, blinding Castiel with the sudden daylight.
‘’Louise, my name is Louise. And yes I do, you may not be the one who took him from me, but you’re close enough. You work together with those…
‘’Cas, Buddy I’m sorry… It must’ve been though-‘’
No no no, not know. Not like this.
‘’Most of it.’’
''Well, I'm suprised you guys have managed to get this far. But what exactly.. Is your plan? You thought I was just going to leave. Dissapear and leave Dean's mind clean and tidy with a bow around it? I'm sorry, but this time.. I won't let go that easy.''
‘’Don’t be so happy. I won’t let it go there.’’'
''Owh and Bitch?''
''Yes? ..Jerk.''
‘’Okay.. uhm here then.’’ Sam handed Dean the knife.
Sam had started to count.
‘’Sometimes’’
‘’He- he would’ve gotten to me another way. He wanted me Dean, so he would have done whatever it takes..’’
He had just pushed most of it to the back of Castiel’s mind, locked it in place and healed some of the damage it had already done.
Because it had been malfunctioning quite a lot lately.
Now Cas was paying the price.
‘’Well… These are looking rather rough aren’t they Cassie? Who clipped your wings? Ouch- Sorry I forgot, that was your own fault.’’
''Yes.''
Chuck took his hand again and a calmer, whiter light filled the room, after it was gone Castiel’s eyelids had closed and Chuck left the room.
And it broke Dean a little inside.
A black slimy portal opened,
‘’Hello Castiel.’’
''Don't.''
‘’That’s because you didn’t ask a question.’’
‘’Sam!’’ Dean yelled for his younger brother, because the damn remote was missing again.
‘’Sam found a button that’s gonna open all the cages and run, told me to go because ‘’He had bigger feet and is ‘’faster’’.’’
‘’You did a pretty lousy job though.’’
A tv screen appeared out of nowhere and showed what happened to Cas, from him getting knocked out til Zachariah and Uriel guarding him.
‘’You’re right!’’
No Dean, I don’t want that.’’
''I know this sound shitty, but I'm glad you're not happy man. We need you.''
It was a soft kiss, a slow kiss, a good kiss, and a long overdue- kiss.
‘’I prayed to you, when you were in the Empty, but I guess it didn’t go trough.’’
gonna dry out because you forgot to blink.’’
His heart broke a little as he actually saw tears making their way on Castiel’s face.
‘’The paramedics said he wouldn’t be able to walk for five months.’’
''Jack?'' he asked.
‘’Shut up and take the joint.’’
Deans eyes sparkled, and Cas couldn’t take his off of Dean.
Dean smiled and pulled something out of his pocket.
‘’When was the last time he called you?’’
‘’Sammy?!’’’
He couldn’t stop crying.
He didn’t want to ruin the mood.
''There's no need Dean, my vessel will heal itself like normal.''
Who shook his head sadly.
He felt it heal the wound, he felt the skin close again and his grace calm down.
‘’It’s scary to see him like this.’’
‘’You kiddin' right? How the fuck could we be having fun when we’re looking over our shoulders for your stupid ass?!’’
And Sam left the room.
Cas cupped his face and, Cas kissed him.
‘’Some ancient jewels, for his freaking wife. I don’t get it though, the guy is successful and had no connections
''If there's no such thing, than use your powers and destroy me.''
''We'll figure something out. We always do.'' Sam said.
Castiel woke up because of a slow steady dripping of what he assumed was a leaking pipe.
After that he warded the scythe with the warding Joshua had left in his head, it were symbols Castiel did not recognise.
‘’And this…’’ Luke put an arm around Meg.
‘’I’m sorry. I’m sorry for being an asshole to you lately. I know Jack’s death was hard on you and I had no right to blame you for Mary. You did more for us than she did.
‘’Sam! Dean!’’ He shouted. Dean was busy holding a piece of fabric against Sam’s leg.. was he wounded? At least it’s better than the alternative, maybe Louise had decided to keep the younger Winchester alive? Castiel could only hope.
‘’It’s not
Chapter 8
‘’What about your Sam, you know he’s somewhere save right?’’ he asked instead.
Although his selfish side was glad that the brother are on their way… It was a lost cause.

''Then I suposse you all die.'' Michael left the room, he let Castiel hang and bleed.
‘’Ah, that’s why you’re this grumpy. Have you had your coffee yet? We can go and get some if you want.’’
‘’No! Dean I’m serious! I can’t stop working on this.’’
‘’I don’t think I’ve ever danced like this either.’’ Dean laughed. ‘’It’s good though, you’re good.’’
Chuck looked at the brothers their horrified expressions and felt satisfied.
‘’Thank you Sam.’’
‘’I know.’’ Castiel smiled.
exhausted.
____________
This time Dean brought his lips to Cas’s.
‘’Yes you do. Traitors belong in hell.’’
They were lost. Ready to completely give up and call Chuck when out of nowhere..
She guided him into a room, he felt her taking off his handcuffs but before he could react to it she had already muttered the Enochian phrase that made him loose all control over his vessel and once again he was dropping to the ground, unable to move.
''Dean. Asmodeus had him for a long time, don't forget that. He took a big one for the team, and I really hope he isn't dead, that he managed to pull another trick on Lucifer.''
well.
Dean’s music wasn’t there to brighten up the mood, or Sam’s light snoring that somehow seemed relaxing to the angel, as he could focus on it instead of his complicated thoughts.
Dean didn’t keep his promise of sleeping in the car,
‘’I- ‘’ Dean carefully placed a hand before Cas’s mouth and sighed from relief when hot air was blew onto it.
Sam huffed. ‘’That’s the biggest lie I’ve ever heard.’’
‘’I know Dean likes this song.’’ Luke said, stubbornly refusing to drop the subject, because if there was one thing he was good at it was not minding his own business.
‘’No, it won’t.’’
‘’How are you feeling?’’
Cas threw him to the ground, and Dean was no match for the heavily angel powered strength.
Woah! I'm really suprised at how much I liked this chapter, this may be my favourite I wrote so far :)
Dean was relieved to saw a board that said;
So he was going to be able to kill her with his angelblade.
‘’I-uhh.. ‘’ Castiel scratched the back of his neck but before he knew it Dean had pulled him from the bed and was holding onto
‘’Maybe not with any regular blade.’’ Dean grinned as he jumped off the bed and grabbed the scythe. ‘’But this bad boy oughta do the trick.’’
He closed his eyes and a coordinate suddenly popped up inside his head.
He’s the only one I’m scared of right now. That’s why I’m doing all this.’’
Castiel thought it was best to follow that order and the three ate breakfast in bed, well.. Dean and Cas enjoyed breakfast in bed. Sam was sitting on the chair and shooting them looks every 3 seconds.
They pulled up in the parking lot of an almost empty dinner.
‘’Don’t. Interrupt. Me. Okay? I’m your father. You will listen to me. Or I will cut your tongue out of your mouth and we will see how free you can be without words.’’
He didn’t know what to do.
torn.’’
''No? Nothing? Well, let's do it my way then.'' Michael picked up the angel blade that had fallen out of Dean's jacket and pushed it through Castiel's wing.
‘’But what about… ‘’
‘’We should’ve done this so much sooner.’’
''So we can fight him.''
‘’I’m deeply disappointed in you father.’’
‘’so it’s not like I can easily get another shirt.’’
_______
‘’Or yours.’’ She grinned, but went to open the door with a key she’d kept in her bra.
Michael searched for Dean in Castiel's contacts.
‘’Say that again you fucking creep.’’
''Of course I do.''

‘’The Empty, he, he made a deal. To save Jack.’’
‘’I assume you know that my fath-
Castiel will never forget the feeling of flying, it relaxed him, helped him remember who he was and what he stood for.
if they were impossible to get and not up for sale.’’
‘’Then we’ll do it the hard way.’’ Chuck went to pick Castiel up, but before his hand got even close to Castiel’s shoulder, the angel had pulled himself into the corner of the room while yelling;
‘’No.
‘’Luke, please fuck off.’’
Castiel and Dean had ended up drinking at least a little more than half of the bottle mixed together with sprite before they really started to feel it, they had been passing it along while making small talk and jokes, lots of jokes, because Dean was a funny guy, or well, he tried his best to make Castiel laugh, but Cas shared a room with Luke so he was used to the weirdest and dumbest taste of humor someone could think of, so it left Dean with a challenge he gladly took on.
Jack ran forward and let himself fall into Cas’s arms, Cas catching him with ease.
‘’Okay, but you’re gonna. Or I will, and I’m not kidding.’’
Dean didn’t have the patience for this.
It was distant, and not as loud as it normally was.
He saw Sam in a simulair postition across the room.
Maybe it would be Dean's black coffee, or his pie.
‘’Uhh… GOD!’’
‘’He wasn’t.’’
He just took all that crap thinking his grace would be gone forever.
He looked up with an annoyed grunt and glanced angrily at his alarm clock.
''Michael was right. I made an deal with the empty. But I didn't have a choose, it was gonna take Jack, and I couldn't let that happen. So I told it to take me instead.''
But he also knew Sam was right, Cas needed help and he needed it now.
‘’Fine, okay, you win. Let’s go.’’
''I think I do.
‘’Go get him tiger!’’ Luke encouraged.
Sam had a vague idea what that might be, but if they were having this conversation, Dean needed to talk, Sam wasn’t going to pry to get there.
The scream echoed in the room, and both Sam and Dean were silent for a moment before Sam said ; ‘’He scourged him. With holy fire.’’ while not being able to look at Chuck.
Dean nodded and squeezed his hand, giving Cas a bit of reassurement he didn’t know he needed doing so.
with any criminals, until he decided he wanted to become one by stealing jewels he could easily afford the replica’s of.’’
The eyes closed for a second. Thinking. Hurt showing on his face.
‘’Owh no, but you are. You’re mine. For now and forever, just like Dean will be. But for now I want to see the look on your face as I explain what I’m going to do to you and him. So let me break it down for you halo. First I’ll force out your wings.. or what’s left of them. Just so everybody knows what you really are; a bird trapped in a cage. Then I’m going to give you a new look and now the fun part, have you noticed the temperature around here?’’
‘’Don’t try to fight it okay? I will explain everything later, right now, just breath, you’re save.’’
‘’It’s weird. It feels weird.’’
''What happened? Is he gone?''
Sam walked over to his laptop and begin his research.
‘’You got my blessing.”
The hunts seemed reasonably easier, Dean guessed it was because Chuck made them harder for them, and now that he was gone, Dean and Sam really noticed how experienced they were at this.
But eventually, they made it.
As far as he knew, she was a human.
''Owh, I wouldn't be so sure about escaping.'' Castiel said, still haven't broken eye contact with Michael.
‘’Which is probably the reason you came up with the brilliant, self destructing plan to summon me, isn’t it? Well good job dumbass, because your little angel isn’t going anywhere and I
Castiel hoped the world didn't end for at least another 20 years, because he finally had what he wanted. His little broken family.
‘’Bad comeback bro.’’
‘’Yes. Did he tell you?’’
''There was no other option Sam, and I don't regret it.''
it wasn’t that funny, it simply looked ridiculous.
She rolled her eyes. ’’Well then get back on planet earth Cas, it’s time to party.’’
''This is not gonna end well Dean.''
Dean?’’
It cracked here and there, and he spoke slowly, as if testing the words, to see if they were the right ones.
‘’..Yes.’’
He couldn’t believe the things that Dean had said to him.
Surprisingly, the wings didn't weigh that much, Castiel was another story, he always seemed like a skinny guy, but he had a lot of muscle.
‘’Yes that too… but look around you.’’
He was not about to lose his shit in front of Gabriel.
‘’It’s okay. I know. We’ll find him. Believe me Dean, we’ll kill Chuck for this.’’
‘’Just that… she seemed interested enough in you.’’
‘’Angelradio- it’s, it’s, loud.’’
‘’No, no Deaning me. You better enjoy it while you can still taste it.’’
Dean got closer to Cas and pulled an arm around the angel, cuddling up against his side.
‘’I know. This is taking way too long.’’
They tied him to the chair quickly.
‘’Prayers don’t get through into the Empty, and even if they did, I wouldn’t be conscious enough to hear them.’’
‘’Fine, you’re right, I don’t want the bitch to haunt my ass.’’
They went into the warehouse, guns in front of them. If they came across Michael they knew it wasn't going to hurt the archangel, but going in with guns first had become more of a habit. And who know what other creatures could be lurking in the shadows.
‘’Fuck you.’’ Sam said.
‘’Oh you little bastard!’’
Yes, Dean and Cas managed to get the Spear and Jack and Sam got the generator...
‘’Because you were always there.’’
Chuck waved his hand and Sam fell silent while an invisible force pinned him to the wall.
Castiel could hear the muffled shouts through the glass.
''He's unconscious, shit. Michael really did a number on him.''
‘’She had a spell. I couldn’t control my vessel anymore. I- I couldn’t move. She handcuffed me with Enochian cuffs and dumped me in the back of the van. I should’ve seen it coming.. I should’ve.. ’’
Dean and Sam walked through the dark hallways with filled cages.
Chapter 6
''Yes Dean?''
Everyone on freaking campus knew it too for some reason.
is Castiel!’’ Jack screamed.
‘’Yes, might.. work.’’
Castiel looked at him with shock his eyes, and confusion on his face.
…Dean was not in the mood for that.
I could promise that the next chapter is going to make up for that...
‘’I’m such an idiot for making you feel like I don’t but..I do care..and god..’’
He hoped he didn’t have to wake Castiel to do this.
‘’Can.. Can I ask who the kid from the picture is?’’ Castiel tried out carefully.
(See the end of the chapter for
''Jack.'' Castiel gasped.
But he wasn’t going to because he was not that selfish.
And it still felt just as amazing as the first time.
''Are you begging Castiel? You still don't see it? Dean Winchester has made you weak. You're broken, completly destroyed by humanity.''
Dean pulled his gun an aimed it at her.
Dean laughed while a tear made its way down his cheek.
In a crypt where he had been brainwashed and lost and had thought that Dean was going to say something else.
his mistakes. All the times he was killed playing over and over again, the times he'd let the Winchesters down. the times he'd let himself down and all seen from Dean's eye.
Castiel tightened the grip on his angel blade but said nothing in return.
Of course not.
''They go to the empty. And I've told you before, Castiel is claimed by it. He traited himself for Jack, and he's going to die. I can give you all mercy, kill him now. That way he doesn't have to suffer anymore. Or.. you can say yes Dean. And ...maybe I'll let him live happily ever after.''
Maybe he should tell Gabriel about this?
‘’Was she really Dean?’’
‘’Get Dean.’’
‘’Zachariah, he brought you back too?’’
‘’Good.’’ Castiel nodded.
''I'm not at full power, but my ''mojo'' is the strongest it's been in a long time. I haven't stopped bleeding because these wounds are made by an angelblade, they are meant to cause me a lot of harm. Which they did.''
It was the same song the entirety of Redwood College loved.
‘’It was nice to just be with you, and Cas, I promise you, we’re going to be together again. I’m gonna get you back.’’
‘’You have no idea.’’ Cas laughed.
‘’Chuck?’’
‘’Leave her body to rot, like she wanted to do with Cas.’’
Dean was tired of goodbyes, had heard and said them for more than 10 life times.
‘’What?’’
Gabriel still couldn’t figure out what Chuck had done.
‘’Please tell me you’re talking about Cas.’’ Dean said.
And it was horrifying.
‘’What are you doing!?’’
‘’I don’t hate it.’’
‘’What?’’ Castiel and Uriel said at the same time.
‘’A lot. But that’s not important now.. I’ve written an ending for your story.’’
Zachariah whipped him on his chest.
‘’Do you think he’ll be able to?’’
‘’I call upon every angel that Chuck has unfairly judged.
‘’Jack, why don’t you sit down buddy?’’
He opened his eyes and stared right into Cas's, not saying a word until Sam got back with the chains.
He punched Castiel in the face, 1 time, 2 time, and when Castiel started to see double Zachariah jumped in.
Dean smiled sadly.
Castiel had been told it was gonna be just a few friends, some beers and good music, but because news spread fast around campus, the dorm room he shared was now filled to the brim with loud adolescents screaming along to a song everybody knew because it came out five years ago but recently started to go viral again, with the singer being involved in a robbery or something, Castiel hadn’t cared enough to read the entire article making its rounds on social media, he didn’t even like the song, or the artist.
''I know.''
They stood like for that for a while, just hugging each other and whispering words of relief.
Anyways hope you liked this chapter!
He was not going to show his ex superiors he was scared.
Sam walked around Cas and Dean to reach the other wings, he himself also took a deep breath and pulled the other hook out.
But it's not the same as waiting for that episode when you get home from a long day of school. Waiting for it all day and avoiding (then saying fuck it) spoilers on social media.
‘’Okay, that’s good Dean. But you won’t be off any use to him if you fall down and let yourself get hurt so.. please just sleep for a few hours.’’
‘’Cas. Please tell me what he did.’’
‘’After Gadreel resurrected him that is. And this time, we probably won’t be as lucky.’’
‘’I am. It was selfish of me.’’
Didn’t even look up from his homework. He still had had a deadline tonight and couldn’t afford to be distracted right now.
‘’Well! I was.. gonna get to that.’’ Luke crossed his arm.
‘’What Chuck said, when- when I was stabbed. What did he mean by that?’’
Dean closed his laptop, and walked over to the bed next to were Cas was sitting on.
And it doesn’t hurt that it tastes amazing.
Sam didn't feel the eletrics immediately, it was like falling asleep.
They also don’t feel weird like the way he does right now.
‘’Chuck.’’
Jack and Sam left the room. Leaving Michael and Cas alone.
‘’But yeah, a hunter killed Jim. He was innocent, he didn’t even know monsters walked the earth. A vampire grabbed him, to feed from him, and when hunters came to kill the vampires, they killed Jim too. And you know why? Because they thought he was one of them. He wasn’t! He was human! He didn’t have vampire blood anywhere near him! He had no fangs!’’
The extra weight made walking a bit.. clumsy. And he doubted he could do more with them than just flap them around a bit.
Castiel tried to hold back the sound of his real form screaming as another bloody hole appeared in his right wing.
Dean had decided to keep Cas company as Sam ordered a salad, and two cheeseburgers.
‘’Mind me joining you?’’ Dean asked, distracting Gabriel from his invading thoughts.
‘’No. I’m done playing some role in your story. Stick those empty promises up in your ass where they came from.’’
‘’I have no plan.’’ Castiel wished he was lying, but now that being stubborn didn’t work, he figured that playing stupid would probably be the next best thing, even though he knew he wasn’t going to get out of here unarmed.
Dean didn’t know where to begin… Yes. Heaven seemed like a good place, but what would they do when they got there?
‘’What can I get for you?’’ She said while looking at Sam.
Once again showing Cas.
''Dean isn't coming back.'' Michael snarled.
When he suddenly hesitated.
machine now.’’ He whispered into Cas’ ear with a sneer.
‘’What?’’
Chuck chuckled before stepping closer.
''Should we do something?'' Sam asked.
They would deal with it in time.
His old superiors walked in and he sighed;
‘’I do not deserve this.’’
Dean swallowed.
‘’CAS!’’
And it scared Dean more than anything else.
But he was too smart for his own good. He got in trouble a lot, got punished for it and became less energetic, less curious, he had no one who understood. Because no one was going through the same as Cas. He needed someone to talk to. So I did. I listened. And then I kinda took him under my wing. ’’ Gabriel huffed.
‘’The price was my life, when I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me forever.’’
‘’Writing your name down doesn’t count.’’
So he’d been right.
‘’What?’’ Castiel whispered, his voice hoarse and soft.
''Have been for a while know, Sam is here too.'' Castiel forced a small smile.
‘’Jack, you need to know what happened.’’ Dean said.
Deep down Dean knew what Cas was talking about, but he couldn’t he, just couldn’t if Cas was planning on… no, not now. He couldn’t loose Cas again.
‘’I’m so sorry Jack, Cas, he- he’s gone. ’’
‘’Cas death’s isn’t in vain, we still got Jack, and we’re gonna get him back.’’
The room was spinning and it began to grow hard for Castiel to focus on anything. His head was aching and words and language got mixed up in his head.
With something like that fresh in the back in his head (or at least, as fresh as the alcohol allowed him to remember it) a major hangover, and zero sleep, it was no wonder he couldn’t focus.
‘’Wha?’’
‘’The entire time I kept getting weaker because he was draining my grace, and from what Gabriel just said, apparently using it himself. It explains a lot, I could always feel him hunger for it…’’
Again.
we’re in shady club and you think we’re gonna get robbed.’’
‘’He might be, but you’re not dumb either.’’
He hated whenever this happened, whenever nightmares plagues his nights and he would be left disoriented and distracted for the entire day, it was one of the worst feeling in the world and could make what could've been good days, start and end as bad ones.
‘’Only one bed.’’
And it was enough.
Uriel said as he kept inching closer.
. Sacrifice yourself. And I will heal him. Completely.’’
‘’You have quite an advantage with those huh?’’
Did he feel regret for her death? She hadn’t been .. kind to him, she also couldn’t really be considered an innocent. But she was still a human, and Castiel never liked to kill his fathers creations. So yes, he felt regretful about killing her, but it was necessary, if he hadn’t she had probably hurt a lot more people, including Dean. And Castiel automatically hated anybody who tried to hurt Dean.
‘’Why?’’
But when I woke up, it was open. You know anything about that?’’
Cas back. His big win,
Dean did so immediately. He went to stand next to Sam and his brother squeezed his shoulder briefly as he gave him an understanding look.
Then they got to the next part, the part where Dean had almost said It.
He kinda wished Michael's dead hadn't been that fast.
act like were his brainless rag dolls, he can try and tear us apart. But he won’t… He can’t.’’
he just met this guy, this was gonna end so badly…
‘’I don’t know Cas.’’
He hated using Cas’s full name, it reminded him of a time before he invented the nickname, where Cas still had his stick up his ass and was still a full angel under heaven’s strict orders.
''You're divance will not help you, Dean and Sam will come for you, and they will see you standing by my side.''
He wasn’t in any pain he couldn’t handle- of course the nightmares had been strange.
‘’I know you’re god, but do you have to be
I’m not made to feel the way I feel about you. And I’m tired of it being left unsaid…’
‘’Well… do tell!’’
‘’I mean it Gabe. It- it’s not men. I mean yes, once or twice… But not like him. It’s just.. It’s Cas. It’s him.’’
‘’What?’’
‘’Too bad, did the pancakes taste like monocles?’’
Some things will never change.
Sam and Dean stared at Gabriel and the angel winked back.
‘’Get Sam and Jack. Now.’’
‘’Hey Cassie.’’
''Don't you remember what happened?'' Sam asked.
Sam and him we're waiting for Dean to wake, it worried Castiel that he wasn't awake already.
He snapped his fingers and the restrains disappeared.
‘’Yeah, It really is. Bobby has helped us a lot, I think we both see him as our real dad.’’
''I think he always was Dean. He was just scared, which I get. His family was even more messed up than ours.'' Sam said.
‘’Ta-ta-ta. I’m not gonna break a deal over nothing. If you want Casti-feel back, you need to make a deal with me.’’
before we took you in as one of our own.’’
‘’Cravings kicking in?’’
‘’At least it smells fresh, not many other people here can say that.’’
Sam noticed how Dean was having trouble keeping his voice normal.
Chuck’s mood shifted and became cheerful.
Gabriel’s eyes were red.
‘’Looking for someone?’’ Meg asked while snapping her fingers in front of his face.
An old couple was eating fries in the corner of the restaurant and a bored looking waitress leaning against the counter, typing something on her phone.
‘’I don’t need sleep Dean.’’
Eventually after a while, he talked again.
‘’Stop this madness. You won’t succeed, and you know it.’’
‘’You kidding? He’s an archangel. He’s supposed to be scary.’’
He eventually choose to go on.
‘’What the hell do you mean?’’
Purple appeared.
They hurried over to were Dean had been sitting.
‘’Shut your damn mouth.’’
Something about this wasn't right.
Jack frowned, hand still on the doorknob and gripping it tightly.
‘’No, of course you don’t.’’ Dean rolled his eyes. ‘’But Sam bought it and everybody loves pancakes. So you’re gonna shut up and stuff your mouth.’’
Cas was humming something under his breath when Luke suddenly appeared next to him. Castiel
Again
‘’I have an update on our favourite feathered friend. But I think this will come across better if Dean sobers up.’’
‘’Dean, don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed last night. But I’d be crazy to ditch working on one of the most heavy hitting assignments due
It was cold enough in this building to contain frozen bodies without them going to waste.
Nobody answered that question, because if you are a Winchester the answer was always the same: A lot.
‘’I get it though.’’
‘’Dean, I’m not angry.
Weird. He couldn’t remember this had ever happened.
Dean kissed Cas.
Castiel thought about what home meant for Dean, a little while back it would've been his car, and the brother sitting beside him in that car.
‘’No.’’
‘’Look man I- I hate those flying ass monkeys just as much as you do but-..’’
‘’I’m good.’’
Cas saw no point in reacting, he did prefer the taste of real food over monocles, and he was already starting to feel better, a few stitches had fallen out of his wings and soon the rest would follow. Then his grace would also be intact again and food would taste awful once again.
‘’Wouldn’t want to have Cassie miss the show now would we?’’
He was still dreaming.
This chapter used to be longer but then my dumb ass decided to accidentally delete everything.
‘’When I walked out, Uriel found me. I could’ve taken him on my own but- ‘’
bridge.
Which was wrong on its own, he was supposed to be dead, forever, stuck in the Empty, because he saved the life of the man he loved.
‘’When I’m asking you a question you can answer.’’
Even Michael knows Destiel is real.
Xoxo Laura
He jumped out of his seat and grabbed his gun from the back.
Castiel wished she could just kill him already.
‘’Oh god.’’ Sam rubbed at the space between his eyebrows.
It looked like the angel completely gave up.
With a snap of his finger the whip was on fire.
‘’Please, Father! Have mercy! I know I went too far, but he was asking for it.’’
‘’If you would feel that.’’
''Sure! I'm going to get my boxer gloves right now. Let me rest man, I need some damn sleep.''
‘’You want something to drink with that?’’
She was met by silence as Castiel refused to give her the satisfaction of an answer.
‘’You need to rest Dean, C’mon, I’m gonna get you to your room.’’
(or their faces..?)
‘’…Is why I think you’re one of the brightest minds of our
He was hanging in chains, covered in cuts and bruises.
‘’My wings will heal, but I can’t put them back while they are doing so.’’
''I'll be with Jack.. uhm.. find us if you two are done.. Or don't? Just.. uhm yeah talk.''
This looks like something straight out of another bad Dracula movie.’’
Dean even tried begging, but nothing worked.
There was no question in that sentence, and Chuck was glad that Castiel noticed that.
Castiel sagged in the chains and tried to ignore the burning off his back.
Castiel took a deep breath and started to talk.
He debated on telling Dean about his nightmare as the atmosphere around them shifted into something more serious,
''Sam, we need to hurry. He knows we're here.'' Castiel announced.
''Go to hell.''
And although Sam was still standing behind his brother, acting like he didn’t know Dean wasn’t going to give up, Gabriel had sneaked behind Chuck’s back to the still glowing Castiel, he had healed his brother as best as he could while Dean distracted Chuck.
This time Gabriel stormed past Sam.
‘’Hello Dean.’’ The Empty said mockingly, using Cas voice to do so.
Castiel grunted as Michaels feet was taken off his back.
The voice switched to Castiel’s again as it said. ‘’You’re a bad man Dean Winchester.’’
‘’what about your other siblings?  He should be able to talk to someone in his family, right?’’
Or crying for that matter.
‘’So.. looks like you got custody.’’
He drew the sigil carefully, then double checked to see if there were no open spaces or little spots that could become a problem.
Dean was taken aback for that for a second, but he recovered.
‘’He’s still very much asleep. But I’m keeping an eye on him from here. Kinda felt like I needed to talk to you.’’
‘’Not like this.’’
Cas turned his head around and gave Dean bitchface 34
‘’...And I fought Dad but he already had most of your real form inside of him, I had to cast it out before killing him.’’
A shiver went dow his spine as he recognised the voice.
He’s got feelings too, they’re just more difficult for him to understand. And I know it seems like he’s been with us forever now, but we’re just a small part of his long life, and he’s new to this.’’
‘’I think it’s better you sit in the car and heal up a bit, I can pray to you if we need you.’’
‘’You wanted to
‘’You don’t give up easily do you?’’
Castiel stopped to sit on a bench.
‘’She was fucking Crazy Cas, I have never seen a monster so mad as her- ‘’
''SNAP''
''You are smiling.''
He wanted to move but he couldn’t, he was stuck to the ground, wishing he could disappear into it.
Castiel smiled as he put his hand on Dean’s hips and placed their other intertwined hands on Dean’s chest.
''We are standing in the center of Dean's mind, if i'm correct we need to find a way to his memories. When I was possessed by Lucifer he locked me in one of my memories. I think hat in order to keep Dean quiet, Michael has done the same to him.''
been gone for two days, he’s gone off the radar before, for like months. He always comes back.’’
At first he thought it was coming from the hall,
‘’You changed me Dean.’’
Cas gave Dean a small smile.
__________
How did he take it when you left?''
''Sammy?''
It was wearing familiar clothes, had short brown hair, and a killer jawline.
But they didn’t register.
‘’I didn’t know if Cas needed some food to recharge, so I brought some pancakes and Coffee.
_______________
Sam got out of the shower and found Cas and Dean asleep like that.
''But Cas-''
‘’Who forgot to blink?’’ Luke joined in, handing a shot of vodka to both Meg and Cas.
‘’Great.’’
Dean never knew that Cas started caring about humans, about the world, about what happened to everyone on it, because he started caring about Dean.
The cold was biting on Castiel’s skin and his wings. He tried to keep moving, and had slowly unfolded his wings, curiously flapping them around.
Hope you ate a lot of food and didn't get too drunk,
‘’Yeah. And I see that now, and it wasn’t only then.. It’s.. I’ve been treating him like dirt for a long time. Because I figured that if I couldn’t face me feeling what I feel for him, I might as well push him away.’’
I can't say that only because Dean Calls you that Chuck thought bitterly.
Castiel’s eyes glowed blue for a second but his pained expression didn’t leave his face after, making Dean worried.
‘’No…’’
He grunted and doubled over in pain.
Castiel seemed to think about that for a minute.
‘’I’ll make all the damn t-shirts I want. We fucking did it.’’
‘’WHAT!?’’
Not on the same level as Cas knew him.
_____
It was even more amusing, because what nobody knew, not even the Winchesters, was that the grace Castiel was losing, Chuck gained.
‘’What else is new.’ Dean said with an eye roll.
‘’Prepare yourself dude, we’re storming heaven.’’
Surely the angel would choice peace.
‘’Oh Gabriel, dear old Gabriel. I’m not going anywhere. And Neither are the Winchesters. Or
Things ended, things died.
Dean didn’t like the idea of being locked up in the same building as this crazy maniac bitch, but he couldn’t let Cas die.
Gabriel demonstrated that last part by pointing upward.
The next morning it was like Castiel was flying once again, although he probably would never be able to fly for real again, this feeling was probably the closest he was ever going to get again.
'’Thanks for that.’’
‘’Cas, I’ve never felt more seen by anyone in this world, you’re the one person on this earth who’s seen everything I did, who I am, and still loves me.’’
He needed to know Cas was okay. And he needed to know now.
I promise that longer chapters are waiting :)
‘’Looks like you also need that second cup of coffee right about now.’’
''Is everything okay? You seem a bit quiet.''
''G'morning sunshine.'' Dean said as he walked over to Cas and planted a kiss on Castiel's cheek.
''I know Cas.''
After that Dean and Cas
''He's in there. Give him some time.''
Chapter 1
‘’It’s okay, I’m here Cas.’’
‘’But we didn’t kill that man? Or did we.. ?’’ Sam asked carefully.
‘’We wait.’’
‘’I wanted to split this with you.’’
‘’I’m not a child Dean.’’
When he looked over to where Michael had been standing, he saw another familair face.
''Can we talk?''
Everything seemed perfect, and Castiel was sure he’d never experienced something that felt so close to flying.
Because I do care.. I care so much…’’
And they didn’t have to wait long.
‘’Well, with all the other celestial or human beings, It does seem to work that way.. you.. not so much.’’
Dean wasn’t going to leave Castiel in nothingness, not when the angel deserved the world, deserved to live, even if it was forever.
‘’And you think you can match his powers?’’
‘’Great!’’ Gabriel clapped his hands.
''I took... a bus.''
‘’I love you you big sap.’’ Dean brought his forehead to Cas and the angel wiped away a tear.
He needed to do this.
‘’Cas! C’mon! Wake up!’’
Castiel tried to focus on the texture of the towel so he didn't have to think about what was about to happen.
Billie’s scythe.
''Dean'' breaks the spear in half (Kaia was not gonna be happy about that)
‘’Charlie’s gone.’’
''It's true Dean, we are made for each other.''
generation.’’
‘’Playing the silent game huh? We’ll fix that soon enough. Let’s get you settled in your new home first.’’
‘’All angels have that fate Dean! I’m not an exceptions just because you want me to be!’’
Castiel could feel the blade in his back, and with his grace bound he didn’t risk to play games, so he walked.
And at that very moment, Zachariah decide to come back.
‘’Then you need some real food too.’’
He’d been holding this back for so long, and finally saying it out loud was scaring, and weird, but it also was everything Dean has ever wanted since he met Castiel.
Maybe as a fledgling? But that couldn't have been long, heaven had gone rotten soon after he was born.
The only thing you still need is a fake moustache and a restraining order and you’re good to go!’’
‘’Because I’m fun!’’
Cas had mentioned once that the Empty had its ways of getting into your head, probably where the self destructing part and the creepy smile Dean never wanted to see on his own face ever again came from.
‘’Until God comes bac-’’
‘’Is that true? Do you not love Castiel.. do you .. maybe even.. hate him?’’
Dean pulled Castiel out of the door by his hand.
It had been silent for a few weeks.
Oh boiii here it comes
‘’Something brought to life again by nothing, will live until everything is nothing.’’
''Have you learned your lesson Castiel? Will you stand by me?''
Dean and Sam would probably be better off without him and none of the two brothers would have to die.
‘’I though we were storming Heaven…?’’
Sam turned around and yes, there he stood, right behind them.
Sam and Dean stood up from the booth but when the door opened two inches, it flew right back to being closed.
‘’You sick motherfucker.’’ Dean said with clenched teeth. He was barely holding it together, but he knew that if he tried anything, god would just snap his fingers and he wouldn’t be able to do anything.
‘’But I won’t kill you if you bring Cas back, so that won’t happen.’’
it felt like yesterday you
Eventually they stumbled across a door with what looked like Enochian signils on it.
Im such a dumbass, I updated this story 5 days ago but with the wrong chapter.
‘’And we’re the Winchesters, he can fucking try to control us, he can try and
‘’Looks like it, yeah.’’
‘’I don’t know.. It all felt like pain.’’
‘’Tag along.’’
you don’t deserve him. You think you save the world. But you bring nothing but chaos and destruction. And you will feel the same pain I felt when your kind took my Jim away from me, and you will feel the pain of seeing him, every night, every day, but never being able to say sorry, to admit what you feel. Castiel suffers because of our blindness Dean. I want you to know that before you see what I’m going to do with him. This is all your fault.’’
''What are you talking about?''
‘’Okay.’’
''Dean-...''
But he was at a lost for words, he hated the way Cas seemed to know him down to his core, knew what he feared and who he was so well, It scared him to death.
Sam was next to Dean and supporting his arm within 6 seconds. (Dean almost crashed to the ground in those seconds)
this wasn’t too unpleasant.
‘’No. You’re dead. And I will be the one to kill you, that’s a damn promise.’’
''Sam thinks he can do it. We have to give it a shot.''
Castiel’s space was filled with photo’s of his friends, posters of some of the bands he liked, lots of plants he’d memorised the original names from and took good care of, art he created, and random trinkets he’d found or Luke got for him, Meg would get him things too- although she mostly saved his presents for holidays and his birthday, and of course every time they got him something, Cas would return the favour, even though he never had that much money, having saved up and paying for College all on his own.
place.. It sounded so familiar.
Michael was going to scourge him with holy fire.
Cas took the receipt out of his pocket and smiled before closing his door.
‘’He’s gone Sammy.. he’s gone.’’
It was something darker.
‘’Sometimes I thought that it was just because he’s an angel, and he didn’t know it was rude to stare or something, but later on I understood that you only look at someone like that, when…
‘’She conjured my wings. I didn’t think that was possible for a human to do. But she knew so much, I can’t help but be a bit impressed.’’
But he eventually nodded with a hesitant smile.
‘’Hi Sam, hi Dean. Uh, I was actually looking for Cas, have you seen him?’’
’’There wasn’t much falling in your arms, more stumbling into you while trying to find the right class but you and Meg refused to let me get on with my day.’’
He’d known for a long time that there was more than friendship building between the two, but the process of it was so slow that Sam wondered how many more he could take before he’d have to step in.
''Jack?'' Cas suddenly remembered.
‘’You hear that? He’s really ride or die for you now Castiel. You need to wake up.’’
But it wasn’t.
‘’Cas-‘’
‘’I didn’t know words could hurt so much.’’
''I WAS possesed by Michael.'' Dean corrected.
Or the taste of blood in his mouth which reminded him of heaven?
‘’No. And you fucking know it! And apparently.. So does Zachariah.. You.. you let this happen! You enjoyed this! He doesn’t know! I couldn’t say it.. but.. I- i.. ‘’
‘’See you in hell.’’ Lucifer smirked.
‘’Sorry Dean, I’m with Cas here. We don’t know if those monsters are actually.. well uhm.. monsters.’’
‘’True happiness.’’
‘’How?’’ Dean asked, his voice full of desperation.
‘’If you didn’t want me to be making noises. I wouldn’t have been making noises. I think you made your place and status quite clear.
‘’He gave me a vague clue about why I could never be there when you guys needed me.’’
I don't bite and love to read your opinions.
‘’Not a single word.’’ Luke ‘’zipped’’ his mouth shut to illustrate his point.
His feet easily followed Deans, he felt light and safe, slightly tipsy and giggly from the butterflies in his stomach, but safe, in Dean’s hand.
''If you used an banishing sigil, how am I still here?''
‘’You will see where that doomed Winchester attitude will bring you! And you will not like it!’’
‘’Goodluck with that essay, and if you wanna text, call or whatever, I left my number on the back of that receipt in your ass pocket!’’ Dean shouted before entering his dorm at the end of the hallway.
‘’You can join me? It’s big enough.’’ Castiel didn’t say he wanted Dean next to him, that he still felt cold, like he could be back there, at any minute. He needed Dean next to him to remind him he was save.
''Gabriel gave it to me before he died, he said I could use it on Lucifer if it came to a point where it was needed.''
''I couldn't stay in Heaven, I belong somewhere else.''
‘’I’m gonna slap you.’’ Castiel warned, with a smile on his face.
‘’You would’ve been eaten alive in the first week.’’
So I had to write it again by memory and added some stuff but I just wasn't able to save everything.
Dean shouted along with Castiel, making threads and loosing track of how many times he’d said the word bitch.
Hot fiery pain shot through Castiel’s body.
‘’I’m fine Dean, what happened to Sam?’’
But Dean had a point, he wasn’t going to get anywhere tonight,
‘’Dean?’’
He muttered another phrase and the feeling of being ripped apart stopped, leaving Castiel sweaty and gasping for breath.
Dean couldn't stand this, he needed to do something.
came here Cassie?’’ Luke asked, being ever so helpful.
They weren’t even needed as much anymore, Jody and her girls could handle most hunts, and sometimes Jack would tag along with them, like he was doing tonight.
‘’I think we still have myrrh in the back of the impala, and we found his angelblade remember? Let’s get this party started Sammy!’
‘’Nothing. But I had to check something.’’
''Do you want me to? Don't you like them?''
‘’Yes, my little bro needs me. And dad hasn’t been himself lately. He needs to be dealt with.’’
''You got me tied up. Now what is the great plan? You're not going to kill me, because it would kill Dean too, but we all know he's not coming back soon, or... If I manage to escape which is likely... he may never come back.''
‘’Luckily. There was no way in hell I was gonna leave him with my dad, he’s with my uncle, Bobby, he’s a really good guy, and besides me the only one I would trust
‘’Want us to stitch it up for you Cas?’’ Sam asked.
‘’Jack wait!’’ Sam screamed.
Dean knew that Cas cared severely about Jack, and that he would go to extremes to show it.
It was completely dark outside, the Winchesters could use this to their advantage, because they had a black car and Dean would make sure to put the headlights out if they could see the building.
‘’Fine. Listen up
to?’’
‘’We also attract a hell of a lot of danger.’
Cas was going to talk. And Dean would listen.
Would he shut down? Or would he want to know about Cas’s important things too?
''Well, it would make sense.''
‘’Uriel?’’
‘’GROSB, uhh… OL IPAMIS GOHO..’’
Dean had went and gotten an towel out of the bathroom which was now placed in Castiel's mouth.
Dean did seem to hear his shouts, he made a knot in the fabric around Sam’s leg and ran over to the glass.
and turns around, anouncing Dean to be gone.
‘’Was planning on doing that anyways.’’ She shrugged with an annoying and way too cocky look on her face.
Dean seemed to sprint out of the shower in record time.
''So.. What now?''
should be doing.’’
‘’Thanks, but I’m not exaggerating. He sees things no one would think twice about, and yet he's sincere and a good kid.
‘’Oh Chuck, you will pay for this one.’’ Gabriel whispered before focusing on Castiel again.
''Don't use that tone when talking about them. You said the word humans as if they are something poisonous. We we're supposed to guard them, keep them save. They aren't any less than us. But you had to make this... mess. You and Lucifer, you are both just as bad. When will you accept the mission our father gave? To watch over humanity.''
It wouldn’t stop him from freezing but it may just take a little longer.
No problem. Castiel had been been up against those a million times before.
Sam entered the car with a bag of warm food.
The whip landed.
‘’Nahh, I’ve seen you drive. You won’t crash baby. What do you like about stars?’’
Castiel has been wandering around for a few days.
Dean gave Gabriel a concerned look.
The whip was growing hotter as it also went through the flames keeping Castiel in his place.
‘’It’s very tempting to put my fist on your face right now.’’
She opened the door and pushed Castiel inside.
‘’Until what?’’
I don’t know Enochian, so I used a translator with the few words Cas said, there is no Enochian way to say ‘’I don’t know’’ So I changed it to I Cannot say, and GROSB means hurt so the entire sentence ‘’GROSB, uhh… OL IPAMIS GOHO..’’  means: ‘’Hurt, uhh.. I cannot say’’
Castiel turned around but before he had the change to react, hot white pain shot through his head and the last thing he heard was his own shout before everything went black.
‘’Or, maybe- you should’ve bought a bigger joint.’’
''Then kill me.'' Cas said, stepping forwards and looking Michael in the face daringly.
‘’I accept.’’
‘’Because I grew fond of you Castiel, I still am.’’
It felt like hundreds of angel blades were tearing into every cell, bringing fire to his body, his being. His grace.
Dean fell asleep naked that night, with Cas' arms and wings around him.
Dean did that immediately too.
But they say it's bad to make promises you can't keep so I won't.
Cas was begging Dean to tell him.
She closed the door on the room Sam and Dean where in and put Cas back in his old one before walking away.
A glow lit up the room, and Castiel’s eyes shone a very dim, barely noticeable blue.
‘’Every star has it’s own place, yet there’s not always there. I like to see which ones are missing and why. It nice to kill the time until you and Sam are awake.’’
He’d heard about it from another angel, not in person no-.. the celestial beings he once called his family all hated him now. But that was okay, Castiel had let that go a long time ago.
''Get used to it.'' Dean said before kissing Cas on the mouth, Castiel almost dropped his coffee on the floor.
''Uhm.. no? Should he be? Because to be honest Cas, I think that I have had enough Michael for the next 200 years.''
‘’Why?’’ She let out a laugh.
this chapter was supposed to be longer but I thought that something is better than nothing.
Gabriel huffed. ‘’Figures.’’
‘’Your room is ready! I’m very sad that Dean hasn’t shown up yet. I think that after you’re done and set, I’m going to have to go out and hunt him after all.’’
Dean almost went to rush Chuck but Sam pulled him back with one arm.
‘’I got the picture from it, yeah.’’
‘’Are you sure? Because I think it will be hilarious to see your faces when Chuck comes back.’’
he had completely forgotten that Dean was not the only person in the room.
‘’Yes?’’
He hoped Sam and Dean would be there when he woke up.
They lost everyone and everything tonight.
And some fresh air could do the both of them some good.
‘’Yeah, a demon in Jack’s body.’’
‘’Dean, calm down. Cas has
‘’No- but-.. That?’’
‘’You want to talk to me about it?’’
‘’Maybe they followed him? I don’t know Sammy, I just know we need to find him.’’
''You think you can fight me with that? I'm too powerfull. Just give up already.''
Castiel had never felt this nervous in his life before, okay- well, that would be a lie, Luke and Meg had put him in some pretty nerve wrecking situations, so let’s just say he’s never been this nervous to talk to a stranger in his life instead.
Or even worse..
‘’I summoned my alternate universe bro look alike before we left trough the rift. He turns out to be really chill, not busy with the war there at all. We went to get a beer before we swapped. Felt kinda bad about him dying.’’
Sam closed the refrigerator and turned to face Gabriel.
He already had scars from when he fell and his wings disappeared, but now- he was going to have to life with countless other ones.. If he even got out of here alive.
Normally he would desperately turn to god. He would never voice it but somehow his father would
‘’Sam’s brought an emergency kit and there’s thread ’n shit in it.’’
He wouldn’t get out of this one, not like this.
''Dean. I- well.. In my short period of humanity, i've learned a lot about feelings. I know that they are complicated, and hard to understand. Just when I think I got the grip of them.. It turns out I'm wrong. But I also noticed that our friendsh- ...our bond, Is something else, something stronger. Dean.. what I'm trying to say is.. that I know what you mean, and that I feel the same way.''
‘’Well, I’m goddamn supposed to protect you. We protect each other. That’s how this works okay? Tell me everything Cas, so I can do better at my job.’
Castiel remember that voice.
''Yeah it's me. Are you okay?''
‘’So, nobody has seen Cas...’’
He also couldn't watch Cas suffer anymore.
Castiel gritted his teeth and closed his eyes when he saw Michael raise the scourge.
Dean put the bottle down before dramatically offering his hand to Castiel.
‘’Probably, do you have some more here?’’
‘’Oh! My beloved rebel son! Back so soon? How was your little trip to the empty? Heard the weather there is.. well nothing really.’’
''I'm sorry Jack, but... not really. You all had to know I wasn't going to let him go that easily.''
Dean lifted Castiel to take the weight of the wings, Sam was tall enough to reach the hooks in Castiel's wings.
''I will always find my way back to you Dean.''
‘’And you’ve always protected me, you made me feel safe.’’
So, I used the trailer for 14x10 for a lil bit of help, in the next chapter that's also going to come back a little bit.
‘’You were close to Cas weren’t you?’’ Dean joined in.
Maybe it did.
He didn't want to be possesed again, he didn't want to be trapped inside is own head and helpless again.
Chuck waved his hand again and Jack too could say nothing as he joined the wall next to Sam.
and when faced with the chair a little hesitation crept on Castiel’s face.
Dean was shocked, scared, and hopeful at the same time.
‘’No one fucks with my Cas, especially not if they want to fuck you.’’
‘’Do you know what happens when you
(See the end of the chapter for
Enochian cuffs. Gabriel gave them to me, they are strong enough to contain Lucifer. So you, aren't going anywhere anytime soon.''
But point is, I never had anyone to protect me, until you started to watch over me, and although I acted like a child about it, and like it wasn’t appreciated, for the first time in my life, I knew what it felt like to feel safe, to be able to go to sleep without being scared to wake up covered in blood, or be scared to not wake up at all, I felt how nice it was to be, to just be.’’
''I know you praise them, praise Dean Winchester.. and I'm saddened by my timing. But you have to understand .. I saved you.
''We have to let Dean know we haven't given up, and that he can fight Michael. He's done it before, and Michael left because of his strugelling. If he really tries he can banish him. I'm sure of that.''
''So.. how do we find his memories?''
Suddenly Cas noticed how oddly silent Jack had been during the conversation.
Again Dean probably didn’t notice he was silently praying to Cas.
‘’It looks angelic. Now shut up and let me do my work.’’
Hiya!  Woaaah 2 chapters in a week? It’s like I suddenly came up with where I wanted to go in the middle of the night…
But no one except for Cas was going to know that.
‘’You’re lying.’’
Zachariah was talking absolute shit...
(See the end of the chapter for
‘’Sure.’’
‘’No, you’re
Cas grunted in the backseat.
like he’d already guessed he saw Dean staring at him in the corner of his eye. (its what people tended to
‘’From strangers like you.’’ Castiel answered before he went in for another round.
‘’Don’t. Don’t.’’ Jack looked at Sam, tears forming in the corner of his eyes.
And now, sitting at the bunkermap, the bunker looked so empty without Cas.
‘’Mr I don’t need sleep.’’
‘’I just- I was too shocked to do anything about it. I didn’t stop him, and he left. Because of me. Because I pushed him away too far. Because I was angry at the world. ’’
Castiel had always been able to read Dean by just looking into those green eyes, Dean couldn’t look at him when he lied because Castiel could always get a hold of the truth in those eyes. And Castiel really needed to look at those eyes right now, he’d missed them a lot the last 4 days, had thought about them a lot. But whenever he tried to picture them, they always failed to be close to their real beauty, Dean’s green eyes were truly wonderful.
‘’Me. Because you know it from Dean.’’
Sam was getting himself something healthy to eat in the kitchen…
‘’Goodluck Castiel, and for what it’s worth, I’m rooting for you, you and the Winchester boys.’’
Castiel screamed in Agony when he felt the impact of it.
''Keep walking until we find doors.''
Anger, fear, pain, desire, love.. He’d experienced them all, without really understanding them.
“Yeah?”
They were worse in real life, on the tv screen it didn’t look half as bad as this.
‘’I’m really not in the right state of mind to deal with your games right now Chuck.’’
‘’Wait- i’m… what?’’
‘’Won’t hurt to try. And even if you don’t want pancakes, I do.’’
‘’Do you like to dance Castiel?’’
‘’You what?’’
''Okay, so.. how do we fix your wings? Do we just stitch them up?''
Dean walked into the kitchen interuppting Cas's thoughts.
''What's on your mind Jack?''
to like it.
Sam sighed.
What would Dean think about his wings?
‘’And you won’t tell Meg?’’
Dean seemed to think this over.
‘’Dean!’’ Sam ran over and crouched in front of him, snapping a finger in his face while doing so.
‘’Yeah, you did.’’
‘’Go!’’ Gabriel yelled.
''Good. Well, we also have a small win on Michael, although I don't like it one bit, Garth is gonna be our inside man.''
He looked Dean straight in the eye.
‘’You really think that? That’s funny.’’
A cold laugh felt the room.
He was as good as human, so if he tried he could probably drift away into peaceful darkness.
‘’Cas.. I don’t think that’s a good idea.’’
The heels clacked across the room once again, Michael was doing something away from Castiel's view. 5 minutes later he came back with a tray of torture devices.
Eventually Louise came back, she was pushing a tray with painful looking things and Castiel swallowed.
After drawing the sigil on the table Sam placed a bowl on top of it, he carefully placed three pieces of myrrh in the middle and brought a knife up to his hand when Dean stopped it.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘’Yes. I’ll heal you and let you rest. You’re going to be human soon- ‘’
''Isn't there a spell to make his wings dissapear? I don't think they are gonna fit in the impala.''
No words were spoken, but there was no need too. The silence was not uncomfortable, it was comforting. Dean wasn’t mad that Cas took the impala, he (and maybe Sam sometimes) were the only ones he would ever trust with baby.
‘’Yes smart boy! I’m going to freeze you Cassie. You won’t age or die, which when I think about it is nothing new for you. But you also won’t be able to move. You can only think.. you’ll be trapped inside your head. Just you, your thoughts and the never ending cold.’’
‘’Hello Luke, it’s busier here then I expected, I thought we were just gonna keep it
‘’Okay.’’
But his relief turned into worry because Louise was dangerous, Sam and Dean couldn’t possibly know what they were walking into.
‘’Okay. C’mon Sam, I think Dean needs to talk to him alone.’’
‘’Do it.’’
Hi everyone!
And that’s when it dawned in on Castiel.
'''He screams very nicely. I will certainly enjoy my time with him.''
‘’Well, you can’t really blame him, he’s gone centuries without.’’
Dean got an idea.
''So, what does little Jack think about all this? You made a mistake young boy, you could've been in heaven. With your mummy.''
Hell even he had tried to kill Sam a few times.
Gabriel placed his glowing hand on Cas’s shoulder and Castiel seemed to calm down a bit, gasping heavily while doing so.
''I can't promise I won't let Michael in, but we're gonna put up a hell of a fight before it even comes to that point it's my last option. I won't go willingly.''
‘’No, I mean it Dean. You look like a zombie, I can take it from here. Just get some sleep.’’
He was met by silence.
‘’I-I don’t think so… but Angelbullet means longer- heal.’’
Even when Castiel was alone, and being tortured. Maybe even dying… Dean still wouldn’t admit it.
‘’No. You’re not.’’
‘’You guys should really learn how to knock.’’ Dean said, rolling his eyes.
''How? I didn't say yes.. Well that one time, but you left, I should've received an invatation before you decided to ride my body again.''
They finally found a door, in white big cursive letters there was a name on it; ''Cas''
Merry Christmas everybody!
He was going to have to wait until the right moment, and then he would attack.
‘’Dean, they didn’t deserve to live their lives in cages. They may be monsters, but they’re not someones pets.’’
‘’But he’s gone. You’re save.’’ Dean smiled softly at Cas and squeezed his hand briefly.
Dean woke up because of small whimpers and words hanging in the air,
‘’Yes, I made some before I fell asleep, and even if I didn't where would we get coffee right now? Once again, It’s literally 3am.’’
So this one was a brain wrecker.
The scream echoed in the room for what Dean thought was way too long.
So he looked Uriel straight in the face and said:
''Huh, still doesn't seem right the guy was on our side all along after all.''
Dean didn’t stop watching his friend, just to be sure he didn’t die in the process.
‘’Set them free.’’ Castiel said determined.
Dean looked up to snap back at the intruder when…
Cas also liked the way the nickname sounded in Dean’s voice, he hoped to hear it more.
‘’Then let me go.’’
But it couldn’t be..
But this isn't the end of my story yet. :)
It was a gift from Gabriel.
That seemed to do the trick.
‘’..What?’’ Could it be…
‘’Well, he was a Demon. Not Jack.’’
