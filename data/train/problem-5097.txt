Dean smiled, sitting down in a chair next to the bed. “Well I don’t got two nickels to rub together, so I guess we just better get you all patched up and back in shape before she kicks me to the curb.”
They drifted into a companionable silence as the scenery changed around them.
“So then you must know everything that happened already,” Dean growled.
“Look brother, I’m here for you. Understand? You’re not going into this one alone. I see you drowning, I’m sending the lifeboat. Understand? I won’t let you go under.”
Since we met you were my
Heart gave way to Deep Purple and Bad Company. Highway interchanges faded into the distance in favor of county routes and byways as the city transformed into suburbs surrounding Cas’s home. Dean stopped once for gas, and a quick smoke break away from Baby to steel his nerves before turning down the final few streets.
After graduating pre-med Cas at first felt unmoored and mutinous to the idea of furthering his studies in medicine. Adrift that summer with Balthazar, he at times felt like he’d been all but pushed into it by his father and the idea of pursuing it any further seemed wasteful.
Cas chuckled. “I didn’t know we were fighting,” the corner of his mouth lifted. “But yeah okay, truce,” His eyes gleamed. “Should we turn this off and put on some music?”
“Can’t we stay here a little longer?” Dean had peered hopefully up at his father.
Sam made Dean some toast and scrambled eggs. “Take this Dean. You’ll need it.” He handed Dean a bottle of aspirin and refilled his coffee.
The next morning Dean drove early and went straight to the shop without stopping home first. He counted the hours agonizing over what he would say to Cas when he called him that night. On the way up to his apartment he grabbed the mail, tossing it on the table, and running in to take a hot shower.
If Dean hadn’t been so upset and afraid he might have laughed. What better life? Dean and Sam had been fed and held and happy with Darlene. John wasn’t capable of being happy. Dean tried….but no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t make his father happy. No matter how hard he tried he couldn’t make his father love him.
“He said you were a known sodomite and not to be trusted to act decently around our guests and families.”
The day after Dean left, Cas wished more than anything he had a job to go to. But it was Sunday. The warehouse was closed, and he had yet to replace the job he lost at the country club. It left him with nothing to distract him. Nothing to stop him from
The morning stillness was disrupted as a busload of tourists flooded the tea garden but it was okay. Cas felt the buzz of life around him and was ready to step back into it. He rose and brushed off his pants, walking in silence, mentally rehearsing what he might say to Balthazar later in the day.
“What?” He was confused. There was no way Dean meant ‘come over’ did he?
Mildred, flashed him a smile as she closed the door.
working at Bobby’s shop, is more the question,” Dean frowned. “Feels like my life is sleep and work lately. Although I have a lot of time to make up for after being sick.” Dean popped a meatball into his mouth, nearly swallowing it whole. “Shop’s been keeping me busy enough. When there isn’t something here there’s usually something Bobby will send me to do in San Francisco.”
“I think they worked their way around to the cul-de-sac on the next street,” Hannah told him, nodding off to their left. “Shouldn’t be too long now.”
Once Dean Winchester gave him his trust, Rufus knew he wanted to see it through. Even if the bureaucrats and the VA said it was enough. Rufus knew better.
(See the end of the chapter for
Men like him weren’t legally entitled to information about their partners. Dean’s panic deepened as he understood what Missouri clearly had. Balthazar was
Dean woke to the sound of his own voice screaming Cas’s name.
**********
"What's wrong?"
“You have a lot of nerve calling here after what you put him through.”
“I remember watching those movies with you when they would come on. It was nice.”
“Dean was in the ER the morning you were brought in. He saw you. Saw us.” Balthazar continued.
Cas didn't finish, only looked quizzically at Dean.
Dean cleared his throat, enough to be heard if Fred was awake but softly enough to let him sleep if he was already dreaming. Fred’s eyes popped open.
“Benny?”
“You nearly died Mr. Winchester. Did die, technically on the table before by some miracle we got you back.”
Cas crossed his arms on his chest defensively now as memory flooded him. Like holding your breath underwater for as long as you could before bursting, he wondered how long he could listen.
It's September 18th Dearies! Happy Birthday Cas!
Cas stared for a moment, worrying his bottom lip, then let out a sigh. “I’ll meet you on the back deck when we’re done. It’s private. We can talk there.”
Dean didn’t know the first thing about whores or about his mother for that matter. John Winchester never allowed Dean or Sam to ask about her. He only knew his mother had held him and kissed him and made him feel safe and loved….the same way Darlene had.
Cas’s accusing stared bored into Dean looking to see if he understood. Dean glanced away, slowly putting the pieces together.
Cas nodded, giving Balthazar a weak smile. “I promise. I have an earlier shift than yesterday. I’ll be home by five.”
“Stop this!” he uttered out loud, quickly looking around him to see who might have heard, but he was alone. Dean looked up again, a flurry of feelings and realizations again bombarding him. The dream was
Cas reasoned,
Charlie smirked, pretending to swoon, “We heard all about his green eyes, the sun- what was it sun-kissed?”
Dean was desperate to kiss him. He wanted to do this right...take it slow this time for real,
he told himself. But did it matter? It was the truth.
He had never waited tables before so he had nothing to compare it to. He just knew he found it preferable to hauling boxes at the warehouse. Not that either of these activities would be a long-term gig for him. With no one around to pressure him with expectations, Cas had had time to think about the future.
A short young woman with a buzz cut, leather jacket and jeans came next and recited some poems. The words “Fuck” featured heavily in one of them and Dean seemed to approve...because
“‘She’ huh? Baby, Janis - You know for a guy who likes dick you sure have a lot of fake women in your life.”
. The details were variable - the
April 1973
“Sol Invictus,” Benny said cryptically, looking around the circle.
“How do you always seem to know the words to every song?” Dean took his hand again now that it rested on the table.
Balthazar glowered petulantly, rinsing the shot glass. He rounded the counter that divided the kitchen from the rest of their living space, flopping into a chair by the couch and mumbling something about needing to be drunk to deal with “The Dean Show.”
Dean, swallowed, unwilling to meet Cas’s eyes, his voice tight as he addressed him.
He glanced to her.
She had a worried look on her face and right away Cas knew there was trouble.
“Thanks,” Dean said.
"Yeah?"
to be with him. It was almost perfect.
Benny put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed.

“Yes...Hello, I’m calling to see if a patient is registered with you...Castiel Novak?”
The instant he looked up, Cas leaned into him, pressing him slowly back against the seat cushions, one hand on Dean’s shoulder, the other on his chest, palm pressed flat and riding the pulse of Dean’s heartbeat beneath his skin.
Dean decided. Shooting one last glare at Benny for starting this he got up to cheers from the room, and rounded the table. Jess, pulling him by the hand and Sam slapping his back in encouragement as he walked by.
Dean allowed himself to breathe a little and his shoulders to relax a bit. It made sense. Cas had been stabbed with a lance made to kill an archangel. Made by his brother, to produce the maximum amount of damage, the maximum amount of suffering before death. Jesus - what dicks angels were. And Dean thought his family was screwed up at times.
Dean sighed, “Yeah, okay Cas...eyes closed. What did you have in mind.”
Gabriel sighed, his eyes softening, “What
“Okay.." Dean wasn't ready to hang up, he had more to say.
Did people do this? It was odd, but Cas couldn’t help but break a smile as he settled back into the cushions of the couch. Somehow Dean hadn’t made it seem awkward. Just an ordinary thing friends would do. Maybe.
“It’s no trouble,” Cas said bunching up the used sheets and tossing them in the laundry bag that was already perched near the door. “Do you have any other clothes with you?
They played for a while, the silence between them punctuated only by an occasional “Nice shot.” or “Sonnuva bitch!”
“Cas,” Dean interrupted, putting a hand up, and shaking his head. “We’ve been over this. Water under the bridge.”
“Hiya Cas.” Dean managed, barely breathing as every nerve prickled, electric throughout his body. He swallowed.
So they finally did it! They went on an official date and Dean put up with (and managed to enjoy a little) DISCO FFS! You know that means he'll do ANYTHING to get his Cas back! I have to personally agree with Dean that disco isn't exactly my thing, but it was the mid-seventies and Cas is a crazy sexy bitch on the dance floor so what are you gonna do right? Thankfully for Dean, in their timeline Tom Petty has just released his debut album, and Fleetwood Mac's Rumours (of which I have on good authority Cas, in particular, will be a big fan) will be released in a few short months, so hold on Dean and Cas - the music scene is about to change again!
“I’m so sorry Dean...but I’m glad that they think he’s going to be okay. That’s good at least.”
Two weeks!...Two weeks and he would drive to see Cas and spend the afternoon with him. Away from San Francisco and Sacramento. A new place, Cas’s place - away from the shadows of their past, maybe a place of new possibilities. Two weeks….It couldn’t come soon enough - but then Dean almost fucked it all up.
A look of recognition dawned on him as he looked from Castiel to Michael and back with confusion.
“He just said you’d left and he was worried about you.” Sam continued, “Jess and I tried calling and then came here but when we couldn’t find you we drove around. We were about to come back here when she spotted your car in Crowley’s lot. Dean, why was he worried about you?”
Cas smiled. “It was.”
“You’re not fucked up Dean,” She’d countered, shaking her head. “I just thought it would be good since we are still establishing this therapist - client relationship to get some work in sooner rather than later. The holidays can be difficult for some people but we don’t have to meet so soon if you don’t want to.”
Still, Rufus seemed to trust her, and he’d promised Rufus he’d give her a chance.
Bobby turned so he could still see the road but glance at Dean. Dean was distraught. He pulled over.
Dean’s arms swept up pulling the hem of Cas’s shirt with them, and Cas raised his arms over his head, allowing Dean to strip him bare. Tossing Cas’s shirt aside, Dean looked at him with pupils blown. Cas brought his hands back to Dean’s waist, pulling their hips together again. His breath quickened into little huffs as he tried to rut. He whined softly as Dean pulled his hips back away from him.
Before Dean arrived at Sam’s he took a route around the town to where he and Cas used to live. There were lights in the apartment above the street. His heart stopped briefly as he wondered if Cas was up there. He pulled over to the curb and cut the motor, watching. A shadow moved across the window casement. Dean took a breath and swung his leg over, getting off the bike. What would he say?
got propositioned by some Dom in the bathroom.”
Dean knew it was a bad idea
Cas’s eyes went round at Dean’s use of the title, but Dean only winked at him in response, clearly enjoying the startled look on Cas’s face.
“Stay put a second!” Dean threw a reassuring smile Cas’s way before opening the door and stepping out. He rounded the front of the car again quickly to open Cas’s door, taking Cas’s hand briefly as he stepped out, then closing the door behind him. Cas looked at him with awe.
Balthazar too had been preparing for this conversation since the night before. It seemed to go easier than Cas anticipated. Like each of them was more relieved that the pretending could stop. Cas still had a small bit of money from his parents' estate that he'd been using judiciously between school and part-time jobs. He would leave Balthazar with enough of his share of the rent to cover the lease until it expired, two months worth.
make it home. Home to his wife and family.”
Dean looked quickly away. When Dean didn’t move or respond Cas dropped his hand, struggling for what to say next.
Dean was yelling into the phone now. “What the hell happened Balthazar? Why was he in the hospital and don’t bullshit me!”
He looked from its sparse contents to the growing heap of clothing in the basket on the floor, calculating that he could put off doing laundry for another two or three days, max. This is what his life was now - work and tv and the occasional dinner at Sam's. The most momentous thing he had to plan around was laundry night. His guitar was the closest thing Dean had to regular company, and even
For his part, Cas remained in bed, just long enough for Dean to believe that he slept through his exit. In a short while, when he joined Sam and Dean in the kitchen, Cas wouldn’t let Dean know that he was already awake when in the throes of a nightmare Dean had cried out his name in the night. Cas would pretend, for Dean’s sake that Cas hadn’t desperately clung to him as Dean drew him close in the dark.
….looking for Cas, unable to find him anywhere but then Rufus was there and drove him in a taxi to the Palace of Fine Arts, and Dean wandered there now looking and he saw Cas up ahead...but now he was running but not able to move, and yelling but no sound came out as Cas disappeared around the turn. He awoke to the sound of his own voice shouting for Cas, but it was just a nightmare.
“Just get better baby, then we can start over.”
Dean’s attention was drawn to something up ahead.
Dean’s eyes relaxed, a broad smile blooming across his face. His gaze drifted suddenly past Cas, his expression falling into a look of disgust. Cas’s eyes widened, wondering what just changed.
Besides, it made Dean feel better about himself. His education had been so disrupted by constant movement growing up that he’d never done particularly well in any subject, eventually dropping out in favor of work. In some small way he figured he was rectifying that. It might not be a formal education, but Dean would at least be able to converse intelligently and understand references. Jessica and Sam had made a list of the top “must read” texts from their literary experience. While he wasn’t sure he could forgive them for inflicting 1984 on him, he did secretly like the dark gothic mood of Jane Eyre. No way in hell he’d ever admit it though. Besides, Jane was a good heroine but Rochester was a manipulative bastard. Dean thought Jane could do better.
Dean knew Sam had his own things to worry about. Jessica still hadn’t moved back in with him but had at least agreed that she wanted to spend Thanksgiving with Sam at Bobby’s place. Maybe this was Sam’s wake up call. Dean hoped at least he’d follow through on the promises he was making to change. Jessica was too good to lose, she, like Cas, was already family.
“I gotta go,” he told her apologetically. “I need to shower and get to Rachel’s.”
Dean’s body ached, perhaps from the chill in the air that was deepening as the dark set in. He blinked as the street lamps popped on and his eyes searched again for Cas and the children, spotting them down a block across the street a few houses from home.
Sam had hugged Cas, wished him good luck. Cas hadn’t asked about Dean. But before he got in the car he turned and said. “Say goodbye to Jess for me, and to Dean when you see him again.”
Dean’s eyes shifted back to the garage to avoid Bobby’s glare.
“I promise you Cas, I’m gonna find a way to make it up to you.”
Hanging up the phone, he headed to the bathroom to splash water on his face and brush his teeth. Checking the medicine cabinet he found shaving cream and a pack of razors and quickly shaved the stubble off his face adding a splash of aftershave. What should he wear? Cas hadn’t said and Dean realized it didn’t really matter as he rifled through his duffle bag since all he had hastily packed were jeans, a few t-shirts and a grey and white flannel. He hoped Cas wouldn’t think he looked like a lumberjack.
and not just the word itself, but the sound of Dean’s voice as he said it sent a warm humming feeling from his chest through his limbs. It made his head swim like rich wine. Cas could feel his smile glow with it.
“Mmmm.” Charlie hummed. “Simpler times that weren’t so simple right?”
Dean thought back to the brief tinge of despair he’d felt on that otherwise perfect day as he looked out at Cas through the lens of the camera. Cas was beautiful and happy and Dean’s heart was full, and yet a shadow of foreboding flickered in him like everything was about to be lost.
.” Cas spat bringing his hand to his face to rub away the fatigue. “I don’t need, nor do I want your guilt Dean. It's the
“I think...Cas is in the hospital.”
Cas wouldn’t pry it open, but he couldn’t help feeling sad that there were things Dean would never help him understand. A sorrow pulled at him from within, but Dean had made his apologies weeks ago and if that was all Dean could give it would be enough for Cas.
“Yes and no…. those stories, they come from the experience of man. I take it you’re not familiar yet with Joseph Campbell? Carl Jung? There’ll be some downtime here. You might want to check out the reading room.”
It was documented time after time in every conflict from Vietnam, to the Hundred Year’s War, to the Pelopponesean and beyond. Called by different names…. war neurosis, shell shock, combat fatigue, soldier’s heart…. Every era and culture had a different name for it, most recently “Post Vietnam Syndrome”. Still as far as many in the government were concerned if wounds and scars weren’t physical then they didn’t exist. No empirical evidence meant no need to throw money at it. To the bureaucrats it wasn’t a casualty of war, it was a personal human weakness.
Then there were the closeted ones. They tended to be kinder on the surface. Wedding rings on their fingers and family pictures in the wallet but all eyes or hands in the wrong places when someone wasn’t looking, as if a hand job from the waitstaff or even an after shift motel tryst was something you could order a la carte. Dean wished he could say he’d never acquiesced, but sometimes John would be gone for weeks without leaving them means for survival and Sam needed clothes on his back and food in his belly and at seventeen Dean had exhausted every source of funds just keeping the heat and the lights on in winter.
“Thank you for taking them around for me Cas!”
“Hello?”
“Dammit!” Dean banged his head on the chassis as he rolled out to change the station. Grabbing a clean rag to blot the blood from his brow. Dean decided to pack it in for the night.
He had just pulled on warm, clean socks when the phone rang again. Dean went into the living room to answer it and made it this time.
Cas’s lips immediately tightened into a line. He felt like he had been punched hard in the center of his chest. He couldn’t believe this was happening...again.
“You’re a real wise-ass Castiel Novak.” Dean laughed, grabbing the towel and change of clothes he disappeared down the hall to the bathroom to shower.
“Jess, can we help you with something?” Sam yelled from the doorway.
Cas would have been happy with literally
“Easy Cas!” Dean gasped, breaking away momentarily to catch his breath, grabbing Cas’s hands to stay them. “This was supposed to be dessert,” he laughed.
“It's so great to finally meet you!” Jess said as Cas looked on curiously.
Dean’s voice gentled now, as he looked back into Cas’s eyes “I know that you’re more than what you let people see, and I’m just a fuck up but you make me want to be a better person...and I know enough to know that….that I love you, and you might not believe it, but if you give me time I’ll prove it to you Cas.” Dean took Cas’s hand again, pressing his knuckles to his lips. “I’ll prove it. I’ll be so good to you.”
“Course I remember.” Dean grabbed Cas’s hand gently on the seat. “It was our first day together in our place.”
Dean caught himself immediately.
***********
“No...well yes..sort of.” It wasn’t entirely what Dean meant but there WAS that.
He froze.
**********
“See ya, Dean,” Cas smiled warmly.
Cas didn’t respond, and when the door closed, taking the sliver of light from the hallway with it, Cas laid back down and welcomed the darkness. It somehow made it easier to deny the tears that streaked his face and wet the pillow beneath his head. He could still feel, but not have to see, the effect of the sobs that silently wracked his body. Cas had sworn to himself so many times that he would be stronger than this. He was just so
Dean looked back to Cas, testing the movement of his jaw, settling the frozen pack back into place before answering.
Cas’s eyes traveled to Dean’s split lip and then lower to where a purple-blue bruise had settled along his jawbone.
Despite the heat he felt rising in his cheeks, Dean shivered as he took a swig from the bottle of diet cola.
“Yes...feels good to think about you doing it.” Dean breathed deeply, his eyes closed, trying to conjure the vision and feeling of laying his head on Cas’s lap - just resting and finding comfort in holding each other like they once could. Suddenly he felt his breath about to hitch but swallowed it, not wanting Cas to hear.
Rufus heard Dean exhale. He gathered his thoughts and told Rufus again, in more detail about meeting up with Cas at his apartment and everything that transpired. Rufus listened attentively, asking for greater detail on occasion.
“She’s amazing isn’t she?” Stephen chimed in, smiling and handing Cas his drink.
Waking in this way, coming to his awareness, he suddenly felt anything but safe. He felt a familiar flush on his neck and cheeks. He was in bed, tangled in the arms of his best friend, and Dean had been the one responsible.
“Call him a fucking cab then,” the man now on Dean’s left, the one in the red baseball cap, complained coming closer. "Else let 'im sit there till he sobers up."
Since his father died, he’d been dipping into some of the money he’d gotten from his parents' estate. There was nothing directly from his father. He’d essentially given Cas tuition for pre-med to expel him from the house with a clear conscience and had written him off.
“Why didn’t you just tell me?” he asked, closing his eyes, his face flushing with renewed anger and embarrassment. Opening his eyes he glared at Dean and demanded, “Why
Cas’s eyes snapped open as Meg cried out falling back against the floor, the rig flew across the room hitting the window. Standing above him, looking more furious than he’d ever seen him was Dean.
“Dean Winchester, How are you enjoying your stay in this fine country club so far?”
“What can I say?” he shrugged. “You inspire me.” Dean was nervous, almost fearful. This really was out of his comfort zone, but Cas loved romantic movies and songs where the guy always did this kind of shit. The thought of surprising Cas with something soft and sweet like he deserved had buoyed Dean through an otherwise frustrating week.
Seeing Cas here among the stone structures and gardens, a combined feeling of reverence and desolation welled up in him, but whether because of the melancholic beauty of this place or because of Cas, he wasn’t sure. Maybe it was both.
Dean smoothed his hand through Cas’s hair, leaning in and gently pulling him closer, laying tender kisses on his lips, again and again.
wasn’t doomed like these statues to forever hide his head in sorrow.  Unlike them, he
Cas stepped away and Dean’s attention was caught up in the swirling colors of animation on the television screen briefly before he drifted into a fitful sleep. Cas changed into pajamas and settled into a chair near the couch, propping his feet on the coffee table to stretch out, determined to watch over him.
“It's handled, Dean.” Cas chided, warmed nonetheless at Dean’s desire to protect him.
Once Dean arrived in Cas’s neighborhood he used a payphone to call all the numbers Balthazar left with him. Getting no results he rode around and sought out the more sordid hangouts he’d told him about in search of Cas or Meg or anyone who knew them. He stopped near an alley outside of a shitty motel frequented by drifters when someone asked “Hey you looking for something in particular?”
She'd set herself up with a chair and a giant bowl of candy on the front steps of her house. Having sprained her ankle at work last week she was grateful she wouldn’t have to hobble through the neighborhood on crutches. Cas offered to take Tommy and Jenny up and down a few streets in the neighborhood for her.
Dean” he breathed, closing his eyes. After a moment Cas got up, poured himself some water, and popped some aspirin.
He decided to skip the phone. Cas grabbed his jacket, locked the apartment behind him and headed down the stairs and out into the street. The rain had passed taking any lingering warmth from the day with it. He shivered, pulling up his collar as he walked the few blocks to the apartment where Meg sometimes crashed.
He spent most of the day walking and thinking. He would normally find a place to sit at the Palace of Fine Arts but the memory of last night and all of its mixed baggage meant that was not a viable option. He settled instead for the Japanese Tea Garden at Golden Gate Park. Packed with visitors most days over the summer, he was able to find a quiet spot given it was still early and an off-peak day of the week.
When the meetings officially "ended" for the evening many of the guys hung back to shoot the shit about less serious topics, often grabbing another coffee or one of the leftover baked goods left out for them by the local chapter of the Unitarian Women's League who met before them. Benny pulled Dean aside on one such occasion.
And then the rain had thundered on the roof, and he’d curled up on the couch with an old movie and his heart made him glaringly aware of the thing he most wanted at that moment, the thing...or rather the person he ached for. The void that had once been filled by Dean was still a void.
Eyes shifting back quickly to the application in front of him, Cas stiffened. That easily, all the emotion he’d held back crashed in on him like a wave. He’d forgotten about those fucking pumpkins. Cas pressed his lips together for a moment to gather himself.
A fault line inside of Dean the size of San Andreas opened up. He was never gonna hear from Cas again.
Dean instinctively bit back a response, but finally he put it out there. “And what if it wasn’t the
“Well, your letter for one. You said we had to say goodbye. Basically told me to stay away. Besides I heard you on the phone before. I didn’t mean to spy but  you were talking loud enough to hear you from the hall.”
The back of Dean’s hand brushed against Cas’s as they lay awkwardly side by side between them. Cas couldn’t help but feel it was intentional. He forced himself to breathe more deeply, not knowing if Dean realized what he was doing, always on the edge of certainty. He looked everywhere but at Dean.
“So that's a yes?”
Dean was nodding. Yes…yes..
him if he’s queer over shakes and fries?” Amusement glinted in Cas’s eyes as he gave Dean a lopsided smile.
“Hey…” Cas said softly, turning to Dean. “Let’s go have a seat on the deck and we can talk.”
Balthazar glared silently.
“Sure thing Cas.”
All because Dean fucked up. All because Dean didn’t know when to keep his stupid mouth shut.
"I can't wait to light it up." Cas broke in looking up and smiling at him suddenly, interrupting whatever thoughts had stolen the joy from Dean's face. "It'll be nice to celebrate something again this year... Thank you."
Balthazar looked over at Cas surprised. He’d told him he was looking into it. He must have learned he got the job before his drug binge with Meg.

“I have to get back. Gotta go to work tomorrow,” his face ashen, his teeth chattering now as he said it.
Dean couldn’t even get that fucking right.
“Dean let’s go!” he said before placing a hand on Dean’s chest to break the connection, if only to grab his hand and lead him off the floor.
Cas told Dean more about his brother Gabriel. He’d been married and divorced already. Cas thought seeing Gabriel again would be awkward but after the first few minutes of stilted conversation they both relaxed and he forgot how funny his brother actually was. Gabriel seemed contrite for having been estranged from Cas all those years. Cas couldn’t help but forgive him. Something in Gabriel was always a little damaged, even though he put up a facade. Gabriel could never handle the pressure of family fights and tension; he usually avoided it by running away. Away from the heavy influence of his father and older brother Gabriel was so much more at ease.
??” He yelled back.
May 1965
“No!” Dean cried, turning back to look for Cas, but he was gone.
You always used to tell me how proud you were of me and I never understood it because no one had ever been proud of me before you, except my mother, and she died when I was still young. Seeing you again, broke open all the old pain, but I guess I needed that because I realized I had just been hiding all of this time. I didn’t belong where I was. I was just stuck. For years I was doing everything I could to just numb the pain of losing you, but it meant I wasn’t able to feel anything for anyone else either.
Cas bucked his hips upwards, fucking faster into the tight circle of Dean’s fist, grunting and moaning sweetly with each thrust, his free hand to grip Dean’s ass, his chest, his hair - anything and everything he could reach until his body locked up and he cried out convulsing, his eyes wide, reverent, and locked on Dean as he spilled into his hand.
. Except now he realized he hadn’t been keeping it just for himself. He’d been keeping it for himself
man Cas had ever laid eyes upon.
After trying around at a few places he found someone who could help him with what he needed.
Cas is not in a good headspace. This author does not in any way endorse his methods of coping!
“Was he mad?”
Cas turned his attention back to the tv, watching as Watson and Holmes tried to deduce what type of person the mysterious owner of a walking stick left at 221B Baker St. might be.
“I’m sure you’re right,” Cas told him.
“I can lock up tonight Bobby, I just wanna work on one more.”
Cas looked confused, then “Oh!” Cas chuckled. “Well, I never did understand your obsession with anthropomorphizing vehicles,” he added, a smile settling on his face.
“It’s fine...I heard you were in the hospital.” Dean decided not to tell him he saw him rolled in. “Are you okay?”
... didn’t you? When I freaked out?”
“I did?”
for them both. Cas had been so excited to go to the beach that day, and Dean so proud to be able to take him. Maybe that explained the smile.
“I’m sure,” he spoke as he leaned in, lips brushing Dean’s softly, hovering, his head slowly tilted and moved as if to nuzzle in but kept just a teasing breadth apart.
Cas chuckled as he saw the slow realization dawn on Dean’s face as his eyes went wide.
Sam looked up and let his hands fall away.
He flushed, realizing that Dean was still waiting for some kind of verbal response. He knew Dean could fix just about anything, without breaking a sweat, still, he was touched by the offer.
They sat and ate, Dean making all manner of approving mouth sounds, as he tasted the soup.
Dean motioned forward with his hands to the road.
“Cassie, I’m sorry. I missed you and I lashed out,” he said.
Dean looked at Cas like he wanted to argue but just then Sam tossed a pair of sweats and a tee on the bed for Cas. “I raided your drawer Dean since Cas is closer to your size.” Dean nodded. Dean applied a gauze bandage with some tape to cover Cas’s still angry wound.
“Prob’ly be working…But try me and I can call you if I  don’t hear from you. How late is too late?”
Dean took Rachel’s number and promised to call.
“Mmmmm that’s it Cas….sweetheart,
“Yeah, hang on,” Dean heard a shuffling from Sam’s end.
Ante bellum, post bellum, post absentia. A Holy Trinity of Deans. Despite the pain and heartbreak implicit in it, Cas still loved them all.
“s’that your professionn-nal opinion D-doc?” Dean joked as he took the pills and sipped some water, his hands still shaking, threatening to spill it. Cas smirked back at him but then was taking the glass and fluffing pillows on the end of the couch and easing Dean down onto them.
Dean did his homework. He wanted this night to be perfect for Cas so thought about the planning for days before actually calling him.
Dean put down his tools and wiped his hands on the rag he had just for that purpose.
“Yeah…” Dean said, taking a breath.
, not past him, or into some void. The man opposite him was different for sure, but a person again, not a shell. Still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.
Dean stared at his hands, still cradled in Cas’s own.
“Thanks Sammy, but when I’m done with this mess I really need to sleep off this headache.”
He felt his hand brush against Cas’s as they sat close. Why was he so frozen by the past? Why couldn’t he just take Cas’s hand? He wanted so desperately to do that but he lacked the courage. He’d never lacked courage in that regard before.
"No Cas....Castiel. It's you I want...
“All right big guy,” Dean teased, easing himself out of Sam’s grasp and turning to Jessica. “This is the hug I’ve been waiting for.”
“Dean” Castiel spoke softly, bringing his other hand to hold Dean’s cheek."What’s wrong.”
Dean loved anything deep battered and fried. Between his hunger and the smells coming from the small building behind the cafe seating, his mouth was already watering. The rain had passed for now so they took an outside table. Their waitress rattled off the specials including a “Fisherman’s Platter” which was a giant plate of every kind of fried seafood the cooks could get their hands on. “It’s really meant for two people. We usually bring out two plates.” The waitress added.
“Yeah Cas. I’d love that. Should be home from bringing Mildred back around nine, okay?”
Dean said under his breath.
“Hey!” the man yelled.
“That was so nice of him!” She said smiling. “You should bring him by for dinner so we can thank him in person. I’d love to meet him.”
than scared by them. “Before that...I was having a great time...I think you were too...it was so nice just
“Are you watching The Hound of the Baskervilles?”
“I’ll walk, thanks,” he said flatly and Dean awkwardly followed, pushing his bike the four-block route to Cas’s apartment, not even sure if that's what he should be doing, or if Cas was simply done for the night and done with him too.
Cas propped himself up on one arm, stroking Dean’s side with his other hand. He reached for Dean’s hand and brought it up to kiss his fingers. “I’ve never loved anyone before either Dean...but I love you...I love you too.”
Sam closed his eyes, breathing in deep as he ran a hand through his hair. Dean watched curiously as he walked to the window, leaning his hand against the frame and looking out absently at the city lights in the distance. “Love like that...please Dean, it’s special,” Sam’s voice was quiet. He seemed to be speaking to himself as much as to Dean, “It’s profound…..” Finally he turned back to Dean, a far-off look still in his eyes. “Don’t fuck it up.”
Dean shivered again and bit down to keep his teeth from chattering. He felt like a fool, practically quaking with fear, hoping he hadn’t yet run out of chances with Cas.
Cas stiffened, looking in the mirror’s reflection to see a man around his own age, sizing him up from behind. Cas turned.
“You must be his brother, dear” she offered, gently.
Cas diligently sliced through some pepper jack for the tray. “So how have you been Rachel?”
to be with him as more than friends. Now the ball was in Dean’s court and there was some relief in that. He thought about calling Rachel back but it was after 10 now and although she was probably up still he knew she had work tomorrow and didn’t want to run the risk of waking her. Besides, he wasn’t sure he wanted to unpack any of this yet with anyone. His stomach was churning from nerves and he went to pour himself a drink. He saw the note and the box on the kitchen counter.
Dean watched Cas’s eyes follow the curve of his neck up to his jaw and lips. All the while Dean felt like a small bird being sized up by a hawk deciding where best to strike.
“That’s the spirit Cas,” Dean said, “stay paw-sitive.” He tried but failed to bite back the grin that broke over his face as Cas scrunched up his nose at him.

“This is bullshit.” Dean muttered. Getting up and making to walk out of the room bare assed in the hospital gown if he had to. He was grabbed by the bigger of the two orderlies and restrained.
Cas waited, then took it from Dean to read it- 102.9. “Better,” he said, “but still way too high. You should sleep and rest Dean. Do you want the television on?”
“Oh him? Yeah, I’ve been watching you two out there. There’s room for both of you if you want to have a more personal party.”
Cas couldn’t help but notice the way the sides of Dean’s eyes sparkled and his mouth quirked upwards despite him biting his lip.
A woman got up first to welcoming applause and sang acapella in what sounded like Arabic - the club was mesmerized, Dean chanced a glance at Cas. His blue eyes gazing ahead as if following some far off  treasure.
The city faded into the distance behind them, the air taking on the scent of pines the further they got from the thick murky heat of its asphalt streets and traversed into country back roads. The trees, at first sparse, now surrounded them in legions and Dean finally pulled into a hiker’s lot.
“A twenty of LBJ”
The last year of pre-med included several shadowing programs where Cas and other students made rounds with doctors in different fields of medicine. At the time he was still struggling with the profound loss of Dean, and could barely drag himself out of bed each day to show up for rounds. Looking back at it now, he remembered moments where he became so absorbed in the work he observed that more than just a few times the day flew by in what seemed like mere moments. Cas knew work like this could give him the sense of purpose he wanted for himself.
to be swept away.
“I don’t care.”
Cas’s eyes narrowed, not understanding where Balthazar was going.
“No. Because you care about people.”
“So for now I guess we’ll have to settle for me kissing my own palm and listening to the witty banter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles. You’re a cruel mistress Cas, teasing me like this.”
But Darlene had been paid to take care of them, and now Dean wondered, the hugs, the kisses, the smiles at breakfast….he wondered if any of it had been real.
Once he realized this wasn’t a new emergency he relaxed.
“Dean...I’m so sorry I hit-”
“That’s a good plan Dean, though I doubt you really mean it as such. Anyway - Odysseus, the point is, he
Cas caught the change and put Dean out of his misery fast, “A girlfriend, from high school - you know, like,
Dean was really glad that Sam couldn’t see him as tears came unbidden and sudden. He schooled his voice to hide it, “Yeah...I want that.”
“How about I meet you at that shop on the corner of West and Main at nine?”
Cas sighed. Michael was nothing if not vindictive, he wouldn’t put anything past his eldest brother now.
?” Cas was trying and failing to steady his voice now that the full storm of memory was overtaking him. All the hurt that he hadn’t expressed, pouring from him, choking his breaths.  “You do realize, right?  You realize I was just going to wake up tomorrow, or sometime during the night and find out you were
FYI - 1970’s appetizers were weird.
Cas's eyed Dean sideways, a small grin on his lips, a knowing tilt to his chin, "What, you don't think I can do manual labor?"
But that night Dean came home with two bags of groceries and Sam’s eyes lit up like it was Christmas. There was milk and cereal and apples, and fresh bread and baloney, and Dean made them hamburgers for dinner with a side of potato chips and it was the first time in days they had eaten anything other than stale saltine crackers.
“You three, outta here, now, or I’m calling the cops.”
Dean pressed his lips together, but stayed silent, returning the glare.
“You have to promise me you’ll stop the drugs Sam...and if you can’t I’ll get you in a program. I don’t care how much it costs.”
“You say you don’t feel,” Rufus stared at him challengingly.
. The son that was corrupted to the core.
car!” Dean strode past the group, eyeballing the powder blue 68 Volkswagen 411 behind them.
Cas laughed then joined in and they both sang along with Don Mclean for a few bars.
Dean took off on his bike, making his way to the garage. He said a quick hello at the office and got some confused looks.
“What?” Cas turned his attention back to Dean “Oh, no. That was actually my first time.” he said.
“I’m just wondering if that's the real problem.”
Cas shifted himself, turning his body around so that he could wrap his arms around Dean again, the slight stubble of his jaw now teasing along Dean’s cheek as his mouth, languid and open, caressed, and licked, and sucked gently along the space near Dean’s ear, toying with his earlobe, before releasing it and moving further down. Dean bared his neck to give Cas better access, humming with the pleasure of it, and still the music pulsed, it's fevered tempo transporting them to some ethereal plane.
Dean was quiet for a moment….then, “I’m meeting Cas.”
Cas shook his head. “I can’t do this now.”
“So she likes chicks?”
He didn’t wait for more of an explanation. There was no higher power to appeal to. He was fired because he was gay. His own brother had been the instrument. He strode from the restaurant to his ugly powder blue long-term rental and drove home.
Cas laughed and grabbed the door. “You know I have more poetry for you.” he said.
“Hey Bobby, what’s going on,” Dean tried to keep the disappointment from his voice.
Holy shit! What was happening? This couldn’t be his Cas. Dean’s hands began forming into tight fists as he willed himself to listen when every part of him was screaming to throw this Balthazar up against a wall and demand to know what the fuck had happened. What the fuck did he do to Cas!”
know that?” At Dean’s blank stare he asked, “Flags? You’re telling me you’ve never heard of that? How do you think people let others know what they’re interested in.”
“No charge,” she said.
“I’d just throw it up,” the words choked in Dean’s throat.
“This needs to be celebrated, Sweet Cheeks - and I know just the place!”
Dean felt the years lift from his shoulders. He breathed deeply, surprising himself as a laugh broke out of him for the first time since their date last night.
Dean had joked about it and now it was happening, and
“Whatever crack you’re about to make about my car,” Cas shot Dean a knowing glance.
Dean beamed again, giving a wave with his hand, before turning back towards the building.
Cas was a far cry from the adorably awkward teenager he’d seen across the room at the Delta party, who looked like he had no idea what to do with his hands, and was always a half-second off the beat. Nor was Cas like one of those ridiculous attention-seeking types strutting the latest disco moves in the center of the dance floor. Cas moved simply and confidently like the music was part of him, or maybe
Stevie grabbed the coffee carafe to bring back into the living room teasing, “Don’t worry honey, you only told me, Charlie, Alfie, those twins who tried to buy you a drink, the bartenders, let’s see, who else.”
“Are you doing it?”
he saw him.
Dean closed his eyes tight and nodded again, breathing deeply. "A little. Enough to get me out of there I guess."
“I don’t think I’m ever going to see him again Hannah,” Cas managed to get out.
Her hair was askew, her eyes were wet, and reddened with marks of fatigue beneath so dark they might have been bruises. Despite her age Mildred always had a natural vibrance and youthfulness. Seeing her here now like this he was struck by how much smaller, how much more fragile she seemed. It unsettled him and made him want to build a fortress around her to protect them all from frailty and time and loss. He rubbed her back slightly as he hugged her, as if hoping to transfer some of his strength to her.
I understand that now Dean. I understand why you needed to go. I didn’t for a long time. I was angry and hurt and I blamed you. I know now it wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t mine either. This thing that happened, it happened to the whole world, and we were just caught up in it all.
place of employment at the Emporium. After not showing up for two shifts he was certain to have been fired by now. The real reason for his early exit however was to do some soul searching - something that honestly Cas had tried to avoid for a really long time, seeking out diversions or parties or drugs anytime he was threatened with a period of introspection that had the potential to cut too deep.
Cas took a sip of his coffee, swallowing down the last flares of the hope he'd foolishly allowed to build in his chest since awakening this morning. His stomach felt like a mixture of acid and brimstone and bile.
...isn’t it Dean?”
The salad plates and drinks served, Cas gave a nod and retreated to the kitchen. He took a moment to cover his face with his hands to rub the tension out of his forehead and eyes before grabbing the order for table six and heading out.
Dean knew that was a possibility, and to be honest he didn’t really know what he wanted. “Look Sam. Right now, I’m just going crazy not knowing if Cas is safe...if he’s well. Something put him in that hospital and I need to know that he’s going to be okay. If he doesn’t want to see me...well then, I could understand that. At least I’ll know.”
Mildred returned to the lounge.
“I miss you.
Cas’s glare went from threatening to troubled - eyes widening as if waking up in the middle of a dream. He could see lines of blood trickling from Dean’s lips.
“You’re a lifesaver!” She’d told him, but really Cas felt like he was the one making out with the better end of the deal. The little kid in him was thrilled and as always he was grateful for the diversion.
“It’s okay,” he yelled. He knew it was stupid. Nothing was okay. His breath came in stutters again. "It's okay..." he whispered to himself now, shutting his eyes and
Once inside Dean stood looking around as if unsure what to do next. He looked utterly exhausted...could barely bring himself to look at Cas.
Dean’s face smiled up at him from the photograph on the table.
Dean felt like he’d been punched in the gut.
been lonely, desperately so, in the apartment he shared with Dean after he left. He had been lonely in the apartment he shared with Balthazar, even with Balthazar right there, next to him, talking with him and sharing a meal. But when he woke up today in his own place he’d felt great. That is until Charlie started picking at old wounds. He pushed it from his mind. There was no room in him today for “lonely.” Something else was filling him instead. Maybe it was pride or purpose or something. Maybe it was a rare feeling of contentment. He couldn’t say for sure but it was ….nice. It was good.
Fuck this, he was going to find out. But just as Dean started to rise up to approach, the doctor motioned for Balthazar to follow him behind the ER doors to where the patients' rooms were. And just like that, it was over.
“Is there anyone we can call, to let them know you’re here?”
“Then I hid around the corner in the next room and Dean blasted the radio and TV at full volume, flicked on the lights and ran out of the room before our old man knew what was happening!”
He shook the thought away. He couldn’t just come on to Cas like that. Once upon a time he would have, without a second thought, but he owed Cas more than that now. He counted himself lucky that Cas was willing to consider him a friend. Dean was losing his grip. The sooner they got back outside and on the road the better.
“Let’s go,” Cas repeated, giving him a nod.
Cas’s eyes widened at the sweet timbre of their voices blending on the chorus.
Cas’s hand went to the spot where he felt the painful throb, sure enough, there was blood on his fingers as he pulled them away.
Dean closed his eyes and sighed, “Look fine, I’ll play along. I won’t run. Just get these off and let me take a piss okay?”
He needed to have a space where he could be ‘home’ without seeing or feeling the echo of Dean.
Rachel was undeterred. “Dean,” she said, giving him a quick hug, also careful to grab him from his cleaner side. “Thank you for giving Cas my number.”
Dean swallowed, “Yeah,” he breathed. “Yeah, okay…I think...maybe we can be...maybe we
“You were born for it Cas,” Dean winked. “Being a doctor I mean..caring for people. You took really good care of me before I bolted like a fool.”
He remembered not caring.
“Bees?” that got Dean to pop both eyes open.
Jessica took the next part.
“I thought you couldn’t make it?” Dean said. “What are you doing here?”
Dean looked incredulous,  but then scanned the crowd again. Most people weren’t flagging but a few were visible on occasion.
“I’m in London. Cas hasn’t answered the phone in two days.”
“I came up here to warn you Cas. That’s all.” Hannah gave a sympathetic smile, grabbing his hand and squeezing it.
“This is
“So that’s good right?” Sam said.
The music changed and Cas felt disoriented. The flickering of lights from the dance floor, the smell of Dean’s skin, a mixture of rich musky cologne and sweat, and the fluttering sensation in his chest as his breathing became more rapid threatened to overwhelm his senses. He closed his eyes as Dean’s hand reached up to trace around Cas’s ear with his fingers, threading his fingers through his hair before bringing his hand to cup his cheek.  Cas leaned into it and let his lips caress along Dean’s fingers. He took the tip of Dean’s pinky gently between his teeth to taste, and opened his eyes to see Dean staring back at him, lips parted and glassy-eyed as he swayed with him to the beat.
“Really?” Dean sounded skeptical.
“Me too,” Cas said finally, and Dean’s heart lept a little
“Well, no congrats in order yet. Don’t want to jinx me now,” He joked.
“I don’t know.” Dean shook his head as if Cas could read his body language over the phone. “He’s kind of messed up right now. I don’t know how I could have missed it.”
“Hey - you called me! But it's good to know you’re still a belligerent wise ass,” he smiled. “I think you’re afraid...you’re afraid to let yourself have anything good because it might be taken from you. You had a good life with Cas. You were happy together, and then the war took you away. But you’ve grown Dean...you’ve learned so much about yourself and learned to work through so many of these things. Sounds to me like you may have the chance for real happiness again...but I think the idea that you might lose it all over scares you to death.”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “Well….’night then Cas. Talk to you soon?” He posed it as a question.
“Okay then….” he said finally. “This was nice....See ya Dean.”
Cas hushed, “it’s okay. We’ll be together soon...I promise.”
“Wh..wh..wait okay,” Marv whimpered, cowering against the wall.
“Actually it is.” Cas smiled, shrugging  “I’ve walked by it a few times and always thought one day I’d like to try it. So I figured it's as good a time as any.”
“Excuse me, but you look very familiar son,” he said.
“How is he?”
“No please….It's my fault for not being totally honest with you in the first place, and I’m sorry if I made trouble for you and Balthazar….I just….I want you to be happy Cas.” he could say it...he needed to say it, “and I just wanted you to know that I had a really nice time..the best I’ve had
“Are you a relative of the patient?”
“That’s … that’s fantastic...Congratulations man.” Dean said. He was simultaneously excited for Benny and disappointed for himself.
The only person he had ever confided all of this to was Cas. Sammy of course remembered Darlene, but Sam never found out how Dean had gotten the money for groceries - Dean wanted to keep it that way - but Cas knew.
“Wish I could…” Dean shrugged at him, then looked back to his battered reflection. “I don’t remember.”
David sighed in annoyance, said “okay then,” and Cas nodded and went on his way.
“We’ll miss you buddy.”
“But that part’s not life threatening right?” Garth asked.
Rufus knew that emotional damage coupled with shame was likely killing more young men and women than bullets and bombs.
They passed a while longer like this talking about everything and nothing all at the same time pausing occasionally to comment on the plot of the soap or yell at the characters through the screen.
Cas’s voice somewhere between a shudder and a growl, the fingers of his free hand twisting through Dean's hair, pinning him with a heavy-lidded stare as Dean wildly chased an orgasm, fucking up into his hand.
They were in the kitchen one night after dinner and Dean was washing dishes while Mildred put away the leftover food. A song came on the radio and he stopped to turn the station. Elvis, he always turned off Elvis. Mildred noticed his eyes were sad.
“Of course!” She pointed down the hall, “Use the one in my bedroom, it’ll be quieter in there.”
“Mmm..” Dean hummed.
“Get these restraints off me.” Dean glared.
Silence…..then “Who is this?”
“Discharged,” Dean repeated, “As in he’s okay?”
Dean shifted his pointer finger just slightly instead, first as if it might just be an accidental twitch that left him brushing against Cas...then over to touch Cas’s own, sneaking it across some invisible boundary line, as if the trespass of a single finger somehow left Dean less emotionally vulnerable than the grip of an entire hand.
Sam decided to let the matter rest and they settled back into a relaxed silence for a few more rounds. Although his perfect luck didn’t hold, Dean was merciless to his brother in every game, and to be fair, Sam was a little too rattled at having witnessed his brother all but proposition a total stranger in front of him with body language alone.
poet had written in a way that stood out to him - made him turn down the corner of the page, like she understood the dirty secret Cas was still trying so hard to hide. If Balthazar had known the effect the words would have on him, he would have regretted giving Cas the book. Opening the closet, Cas could hear the familiar verses in his mind - his hands shaking as he reached to find what he was looking for.
Dean opened the door a few moments later, edging by Cas as he looked at the scraped and cut knuckles of Dean’s hand and glanced, open-mouthed at the broken mirror over the sink. “I’m sorry Cas...I’ll pay to have that fixed.”
“Lonely?” Dean finished for him, shrugging, grabbing another onion ring.
“Cas!” Dean called, stopping him.
“Hmmp” Rufus sounded thoughtful.
“Thank you for tonight.” Cas shed his jacket, hanging it on a rack by the door inside their apartment. He ran his fingers through his damp hair to ruffle out the raindrops that still clung there smiling softly. “This was a good night.”
“Dean?”
“Benny you’re gonna have to give us a little more,” Dean said. “You know, for the non-Oxford educated in the group?”
“Things are great! Really good. You?”
“Dean called last night,” he finally said, not meeting his eyes.
Dean considered it, if only to see that Cas was okay through the night. Everything about being here in this apartment made him feel awkward and alien. Dean found himself looking around, searching for anything familiar. A plant or an old quilt - a picture frame - something from when he and Cas shared a life and a home. He found nothing. It
As soon as he got into Valens he stopped at a phone booth and tried again. There was no answer. Cas was probably working a late shift, he told himself. The night before Thanksgiving was always a big night for bars and restaurants with so many people traveling to visit friends and family for the holiday and drinking late into the night. Failing to reach Cas, he called Sam, hoping Sam could keep trying for him until Dean could reach Cas himself later.
“Or in,” Dean huffed.
“Whatever - You want a beer? Whiskey? Water? Pie? Anything?”
He hoped Dean’s friend would be fine. Cas told himself it all made sense. Of course it did! Dean wouldn’t have had Sam call if he was just standing him up. He just wouldn’t….It was fine...
Dean’s eyes snapped to his, questioning.
No Castiel.
“Everyone, this is Benny,” Dean said. Sam and Jess both smiled in welcome.
. They all were. Everyone but him. Dean wasn’t even in the same league. He hadn’t even finished high school. Why did he ever think he would be enough for someone like Cas?
Finally Dean caved, “Look man, I can’t sleep….I don’t even
Dean swallowed.
“It’s not the flowers that have me smiling, it’s the man who thought enough of me to send them.”
Cas whispered, his eyes closed, as if wishing hard enough could scrub away the guilt and pain of everything past.
“Stay with me tonight Cas.”
Cas sat down on the end of the couch closest to Dean, their knees almost touching. “You should eat something.” He nodded at the banana.
The restaurant was a small family business that specialized in fried seafood, and burgers.
“I’m just...I’m the luckiest guy in this whole place.” Dean shyly dropped his eyes to their still joined hands.
“Please Dean! I want the world to see how good you are!” Jess smiled, and the crowd, seeing her attempts to entice Dean into performing as he shook his head “No”, cheered them on loudly.
Of all the things said during their phone call, it was
Crowley was definitely curious about Dean’s sullen arrival without his usual cadre. Clearly in a state, he briefly wondered if the chance would arise to chat him up. When it came to sex Crowley was a ‘bon vivant,’ and an ass like Dean’s was always worth paying attention. Crowley had been an admirer every chance he got on previous visits as Dean sauntered away from the bar with a round of drinks for him and his friends. If the look of pain and longing in Dean’s countenance was any indication, he was clearly feeling vulnerable. Always the opportunist Crowley wasn’t above using that to his advantage for a little taste of fun.
He wanted to crawl in a hole and not be seen. He didn’t want to come out of the bathroom and have Cas pretend to care and give Dean smiles and laughs when clearly he really just wanted Dean gone. Dean threw cold water on his face before going back out into the hall. Cas was coming out of his bedroom.
Cas smiled to himself. Cas could be patient, for Dean.
Dean suddenly realized glancing down, with
Cas heard the smile again in Dean’s voice and couldn’t help but agree. He asked Dean about his guitar.
“Yeah?” Dean shifted, his eyes popping open, intrigued.
.” Dean couldn’t tell if that made it better or worse. It just
“Not this weekend.. gotta deal with something at the other shop this weekend for Bobby. Next weekend I mean.”
“Just please,” Dean gave his home number to Gabriel, adding. “Tell him I just wanted to make sure he’s okay.”
Charlie sat cross-legged in an upholstered chair in the living area of Cas’s new place and raised her eyebrows expectantly.  He’d been the proud tenant of the upstairs of a two-story ranch for three weeks. On moving closer to Yuba City to be nearer to Rachel he’d reconnected with Charlie, whom he hadn’t seen since high school.  They had just finished unpacking the last of his things and were listening to Van Morrison and sharing a pizza. Well, ‘sharing’ Cas thought, was a relative term. Charlie, despite her diminutive size, was picking up her 5th slice of the day.
“Cops’ll be here any minute boys!” Crowley announced, sparing a glance to Sam, “Best get him out of here” he said, nodding at Dean.
“You’re not gonna go telling anybody about this are you Cas?”
Cas didn’t remember exactly when or how it happened, but it seemed he awoke one day, finding himself in a daily routine of life with Balthazar. He no longer recognized himself in any of the actions he performed with almost ritual precision. Cas felt like a supporting character in someone else's story. Somehow, without him realizing it, a path had been chosen for him by something or somebody else.
Cas got up and turned on the tv flipping channels to try to find something that Dean might like, not that he could keep track of much with the raging fever disorienting him. Cas flipped past a few news shows and settled on a Scooby Doo Halloween special. He came back to Dean with juice and made him drink some to hydrate before letting him lay back down.
“Hey! Hey! Cas!” Dean said reaching out and steadying Cas with a hand to his shoulder.
“NO!” Dean yelled struggling again, terrified  “I don’t wanna go to sleep! Don’t make me sleep!”
“How did you know?” Dean's voice broke over the tears.
“Dammit Cas.” Dean sighed, gesturing at the blanket and its contents. “I’ve never made fried chicken before. Never done this crazy sappy shit before. Not for a girl, not for  Sammy not for anyone, ‘cept you,” Dean’s shoulders slumped a little, his eyebrows drawing together. “And obviously I suck at it ‘cause I’m doing it all wrong if I can’t make you see how special you are.”
Dean brought his hands together to rub the fatigue from the bridge of his nose and eyes.
“Dean, ….Dean Winchester.”
“Near Yuba City,” Cas said.
“Your hand,” Dean said simply. “And how long I’ve wanted to hold it again....I meant it that night at Cafe Luna when I sang to you."
“Stirring and stirring and stirring my brew.
‘..Maybe.’
They were back at the cable car stop, just in time to hop on if they hurried. Cas paid the driver who no doubt assumed they were stoned as Dean got out still laughing.
Nodding to Dean he said politely  “It was nice to see you Dean. It really was. You seriously don’t have to worry about me anymore. You have good things going on in your life,” Cas’s tone had softened, but the warmth was gone from his voice. “Give Sam and Jess my love.”
He let out a long, slow breath.
“Thank you Dean,” she smiled softly, turning.”Sleep tight.”
“Admit it Dean, you're a spoiled brat who spots someone else playing with a long lost toy and suddenly decides he wants it back.” turning to Cas he added, “You know, if you hadn’t been rushed in right at that moment Dean would still be doing whatever he does with whomever he does it with in Sacramento.”
“Holy shit.” This was all worse than Benny thought, “Did you ground yourself? What did you do?”
Cas lost his spark of anger. He was just sad now...desperately sad. “I sent you a letter. I tried to explain. Just….just read the letter...please Dean.....I can’t...”  All things considered, Cas had been strong since Dean stormed out. Now with Dean back here he was losing it fast. Cas turned to walk back towards the house.
He thought about Mildred and the love of her life, sleeping just a few rooms down the hall. If not for this man, Dean wouldn’t have a second chance with Cas at all. Wouldn’t have anything. Dean would have ended up a John Doe, found on a beach the morning after he drank and drugged himself into the next world. Probably would’ve scarred some young family for life, finding him bloated and blue from the tide with his eyes plucked out by seagulls or some crap.
surprised Dean once in such a way.
**********
A tired laugh escaped Dean, “Don’t worry. It was overdue. I’d have hit me long ago.”
He put down the receiver and stared for a minute at the phone. He didn’t know whether to be pissed, or whether he should actually “sod off” - whatever the fuck that meant. I mean what would he say if the situation were reversed?
“You taste amazing Cas..”
If Dean were being honest with himself he might have acknowledged that relaying the number would give him one more chance to hear Cas’s voice, which he deeply desired to hear, angry or not. If he were being honest with himself, which of course he wasn’t.
Cas had no idea what to say to make it different this time. Part of him knew what was happening was out of his control and that terrified him.
Hannah looked startled at his declaration and was about to speak but Cas cut her off.
“Cas wait…” Dean begged. “I got the letter.”
Dean couldn’t help but grin back at that, “Course I thought of you...think about you all the time,” he added softly, causing a matching blush to rise in Cas’s cheeks. Dean briefly basked in the glow of it, then remembered himself, stepping out of the way to allow Cas to climb into the passenger’s seat, before closing the door for him and rounding to the driver's side.
“Okay,” Dean laughed. “Just call me first before you go car shopping, yeah?”
Dean seemed to be foundering now.
“Holy shit Cas!” Dean stuttered between ragged breaths as Cas’s muscles clenched and unclenched around him. “So tight...oh god, you feel so good...so perfect Cas..Sweetheart.” Dean murmured as he started to move, feeling each exquisite inch of Cas as he slid slowly in and out. “My sweetheart,” Dean whispered catching Cas’s eyes, heavy with desire. He looked utterly debauched, whining sweetly as Dean nailed his prostate with the next stroke.
“You gonna be okay for now?”

Dean huffed a laugh knowing he wasn’t fooling Cas in the slightest with his show of bravado, but how could he care? Cas was glowing, so nothing else mattered. Cas was
“I’ll be okay Dean.” Cas answered softly after a moment “I think I just need to rest. A weapon from Heaven’s arsenal is bound to have an after-effect.”
“Not what I asked.”
“You know he thinks of you like a son, sweetheart. We both do,” Mildred’s voice broke over the words and Dean pulled her in tightly again and held her close until he could feel her silent sobs subside. He grabbed at the corners of his eyes with his fingers as he stepped back, clearing his throat. He wasn’t gonna let himself cry. Not now. Not in front of Mildred. His throat locked too tight for words, he nodded meaningfully back.
