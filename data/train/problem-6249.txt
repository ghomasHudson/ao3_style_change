And yeah, that was how they ended up like how they were now. Everyone was pissed at Tony and they weren't afraid to show it either. Even Bruce, who showed up later, was giving him disappointed looks. Tony didn't bother to say anything, he just got up when they reached the tower and left. He heard Steve shouting from behind him but he didn't care. He was starting to get a little anxious, and he knew that if he didn't do something about it quickly, he'd go into a full on panic attack.
Bruce, hearing the conversation, quickly butted in. "Steve, I'll come with you. I can't believe Tony's behavior today..."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve only shook his head and in his Captain America voice said to the rest of the team, "Everyone back to the Quinjet. Clint we'll get you to medical as soon as possible."
Helen pursed her lips and told him, "I wasn't the one that found you."
He took his seat back next to Steve and pretended not to notice the worried look the blond gave him. He noticed that there was once slice of pizza left. As he stared at it, it felt like it was taunting him. His stomach made annoying pangs but, he ignored it and continued to watch the movie. After all, wasn't the pizza what had gotten Tony into this mess in the first place?
Bruce, finally unable to take anymore, spoke up for the first time. "Tony..."
Steve shook his head. "Tony... I don't even deserve to be talking to you right now. God, why are you still talking to me? You have every right to be angry at me right now. I was wrong. We were all wrong about you. You deserve better..."
"I understand. I"ll do my best to show you I'm worthy of your forgiveness," Steve promised, a determind glint in his eyes.
Thor wasted no time and picked Tony up gently, following Steve out of the bathroom. Back in the lab, Natasha and Clint were waiting to see what had happened. When they saw Steve come out, they walked over to him. "What happened, man? We heard you yelling, and Bruce just ran out!" Clint said worried.
Tony flicked on the light, and his eye caught the razor that was on the sink. He grabbed it and slid up his sleeve, slowly, already feeling relieved. What he didn't know was that JARVIS was taking drastic measures, and alerting the others of what was about to happen.
Tony wasn't sure whether he felt flattered or overwhelmed. But, he agreed to watch the movie with them. Steve gave him a gentle smile and Tony couldn't keep the blush off his face. He masked it by looking down.
Steve blinked, unsure, and looked at everyone else. They all had a look of determination in their eyes.
He quickly ran into the lab, stripped off his suit, and collapsed to the floor, breathing heavily. Jarvis was desperately trying to communicate to him but in his haze he heard himself say, "Mute."
"Mute," Tony snapped.
Steve catches Tony in the act.
Natasha cursed in Russian. She looked over to Steve. "What happened to him?"
Tony didn't even
Tony gaped. Steve had cleaned up the mess? But why? Jarvis, noticing Tony's surprise, said, "Perhaps he would like to make up for his past mistakes, Sir."
They all looked incredibly guilty and Clint said, "But no more of that! You have to come from now on!"
Tony didn't respond. Steve motioned to the others, and they all left Tony to sleep. As they walked out into the hallway, Clint yelled, "This is such bullshit!"
He looked up and stared into Tony's eyes. "We would all go crazy if you died Tony. So please... don't waste your life. We care about you..."
Tony learns something about himself after a nightmare.
When the team got to medical, Tony was quickly placed on a bed, and Helen, a fellow ally of the Avengers who had medical experience, checked his vitals. She looked worried. "He is very anxious. We may have to sedate him," Helen told the Avengers.
"And none of you guys could?" Tony snapped.
Tony shook his head sadly. "You don't. Nobody cares. Everyone leaves..."
Everyone gasped. "What!"
Anyway, sorry this took so long! I'll try and get the chapters out quicker! Hope you enjoyed!
Steve sighed and then looked at the team again. "Then it's settled. We will all stay with Tony. He needs us, all of us."
Tony scowled and yelled back, "I had to save a kid-"
When Tony came back from medical, he went straight to the lab. He knew the rest of the team was trying to apologize, but he didn't want to hear any of it. Feelings made gave him headaches, and headaches made him annoyed.
"Who did then?" Tony asked slowly.
He made sure to look as relaxed as possible as he walked back into the room. Everyone's eyes were quickly on him. "You okay?" Clint asked as he walked in.
"Mr. Rogers, please come back later. Sir is sleeping right now."
Bruce contemplated something for a moment and then looked Tony in the eye and said, "I'm sorry."
Finally some fluff! Or is this just more angst? Idk :(
"It's been a while since we had team movie night," was all Steve said.
Steve apologizes.
"No. I... I want to give you a chance. I want... I want to forgive you but I-"
Tony groaned and laid his head down in his arms on the desk. He felt a headache coming on. He closed his eyes, his thoughts silencing. He felt himself relax and couldn't help but drift off to sleep.
Natasha shook her head. "Why would he go to such lengths to gain attention?"
He made sure to lock the doors and restrict anyone access from coming in. After all, he'd made that mistake before and look what had happened. Now Steve and the team gave him sad looks and he knew they felt pity. But, he didn't want pity from anyone, especially not the people that caused him to cut in the first place.
Steve frowned in confusion. Why was the smell so strong? And why hadn't Jarvis alerted them that something was going on in Tony's lab? Suddenly, Steve felt himself grow worried. "Tony!" He shouted.
"Please call me Steve."
"Tony!" Steve growled, quietly.
"And maybe that's a good thing, J!" Tony snapped.
The team nodded, and went to find places in the room to sit down. Steve sad down on the bed, feeling as it dipped with his weight. He stared sadly at Tony. We wont leave you alone again, he thought, determined to help Tony get better. Because Tony deserved it. And Steve needed to show him that.
Why was Tony on the floor? When Steve looked down, what he saw almost made him throw up. Lying at an odd angle on the floor was no other than Tony, but that's not what surprised Steve.
The rest of them nodded and set off for medical, confused and worried. However something was going through Clint's mind. He knew Tony didn't self harm for attention. As he stared at the passed out billionaire he couldn't help but ask himself the same question. Was Tony really who Clint thought he was?
"Thank you, sir," Jarvis stated.
Someone, possibly Steve, made a choked sound at what Tony had said. Bruce didn't look deterred. "Tony, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for not noticing that one of my best friends, the only person who ever really understood me, the only person that never feared me, the only person that enjoyed being around me, was in pain. I'm sorry that I didn't try and help you, and I'm sorry I ignored all the signs. I-" Bruce choked up. "I s-should've been there for you... I should've tried to understand. I should've showed my support. You always say that it's never my fault, but... this time... I think it really was."
that he was amazing. He always thought Tony was arrogant and stuck-up always making it seem like he was the best.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve stared at her in shock. "But, he's passed out!"
Clint, who was still holding his leg but no longer moaning in pain. shouted, "That's a load of bullshit and you know it, Stark!"
"Sir-"
Steve was shouting and asking him why he left, Clint was moaning in pain, Natasha was whispering obscenities, Thor was desperately trying to comfort Clint, and Bruce was nowhere to be seen, or rather, heard. Tony quickly flew back to the Avengers where he noticed Loki was gone. Steve ran up to him, fury on his face. Tony lowered himself to the ground and pushed up his face plate, just when Steve had caught up to him. "Where the hell did you go? If you had been there, Clint wouldn't be injured right now! Loki put something on his leg and you weren't there to stop him!" Steve growled out.
The Alpha retreated from the strong hug and placed her hands firmly on Tony’s shoulders, looking him up and down. “You’re not in heat yet.”
Please leave comments and kudos if you liked the new chapter <3<3<3 it would mean a lot and keep me motivated!
The Alpha in fact, took in the image of a sleepy Tony Stark in front of him, his favourite look of the genius if he had to choose. The ruffled hair, dishevelled clothes and sleepy big eyes staring up at the blond. A perfect Omega right in front of him. Steve was close to purring. Though he caught himself before letting loose such a private and intimate sound, not today he kept reminding himself. Not with their family in the other room, being able to listen to every word.
Hell no. This was way too early, too early for Tony to accept what happened and move on. For heaven's sake he had an anxiety attack this very morning and even had to run to Natasha for help, like a true helpless pup.
Natasha saw the realization in his eyes and jumped down from the table, coming to a stand beside the speechless Omega.
Tony reacted instantly and presented to some extent, though not much, and purred in delight, instincts happy of being in such close proximity to the Alpha.
“Oi Pete, you’re not the only one in the nest!”, Harley remarked with a slight grin on his face while retreating from his mother’s neck.
“Alpha,” Tony mewled into the blond’s ear as he arched into the touch of the man, biting his lip at the sudden squeeze of his ass. “Can you do something for me, Alpha?” With another purr Tony planted several kisses against Steve’s cheek, everything to get what he wanted.
But since no one was around no one could stop the group.
Taking in the scents beside the domiering Alpha pheromones, the Omega’s brain alarmed him of the scared and frightened smell coming from his pups, the scene about to unfold surely being too much for the young kids to take in.
“Alpha please”, he breathed out.
The Alpha nibbled at the Omega’s neck absent minded and grunted with every trust against Tony’s cloth covered hole. It should be illegal, he noted, for the Omega to wear clothes in bed. Steve would love to keep the sweet Omega naked at all times, just in his presence of course. No one was allowed to the man naked but him.
“First of all ‘perfect’ Omega? I’m pretty sure such an old timer ideal shouldn’t come from someone who calls himself a futurist, Tony. And damaged? You seem very much intact to me”, Steve explained with a pointed look.
Now, he could also feel the concerned blue eyes directed at his face and the Omega smiled up at the blond to ensure him everything was alright. How could he not? Just seeing Steve’s gleaming eyes and flawless expression would make anyone smile out of sheer reflex, that man was truly blessed look wise.
God, did Tony make for such a sight.
Pulling his fingers out the man reached them in front of his face and slowly sucked them into his mouth. Moaning at the taste, his Omega’s taste.
So he took a deep breath on the day the assignment was announced, clenched his fists, and walked up to the boy. Matt, his name turned out to be, smiled up at him, probably comforted by the fact that someone as responsible as Peter was his partner.
Suddenly a strong, big hand reached out for him, making Tony’s eyes go wide. The Alpha was taking his chin in between his fingers, stroking across his face with a careful touch, such a contrast to his feral behaviour a few seconds ago.
A moment later the waitress returned to their table with the drinks and took their food orders at the same time. The beta beamed at the two men at the table, obviously having noticed who she was serving tonight and by the looks of it the night was quite serious. A date she giggled internally as she wrote down the orders for the two heroes.
Pulling his foot upwards as fast as he could Tony paled at the cause of his suffering. A lego brick was laying on the floor as innocent as ever, partly hidden by the soft carpet and right in that second the Omega got a heap of flashbacks.
Thor only scratched his head at the sight and shrugged his shoulder. Well, there was always another day to continue the thrilling fight against the head Alpha of the team. But the god surely did not want to disturb the pair at the moment, aware how treasured a bond like that was.
“I WASN’T COWERING!”, Clint screeched, reminding Tony weirdly of Peter in that moment. “I was just...analyzing the situation, like the talented spy I am.”
And he was prepared, having picked out a gift that wasn’t edible this time, having learned from the situation with Clint. Leaving food out in the open with hungry heroes roaming the building truly wasn’t the smartest idea, the blond admitted.
Kissing has never been as great as this, Tony thought pleasantly.
Well, here went nothing.
It was kind of nice even. The close contact to Peter, who smelled faintly of Tony and even a small bit of Harley. Family.
“Ahhh, Alpha”, he whimpered at the sensation.
Only the other part of him, something significant stronger was stopping him from doing just that.
God, the Omega was so close, Steve could easily make out his heavenly scent now, thick and rich in the air of the lab, a room Tony occupied daily. The room where everything started, Steve only just realized. The room where the man’s heat brought them together for the first time.
“Tony you need to step in, RIGHT NOW!”, the voice of another Omega distracted him momentarily and only then did Tony noticed Clint in the room.
Still, he was too far gone to be thinking about this for longer, his hard dick a constant reminder of his situation. He had to get to his bedroom, the bedroom with all his heat toys, one being his favourite blue knotting dildo that always managed to make his toes curl in delight. Fuck, why did he even hide in the lab in the first place?
Pheromones thickened in the room as both men panted from the movements, moans and grunts loudly sounding off as both chased their highs.
And, well, Tony has always been proud of his oldest in that way.
“Mr. Stark, care to explain your shenanigans,” the gruff voice of his history teacher reached his ears. And here we go, Peter thought bitterly.
Steve reacted immediately and stepped around the kitchen island, posture straight and intimidating, complementing his with aggression spiking scent and noticeable fangs shown through his dominant snarls.
Maybe it was because Tony was simply taken back by the sheer beauty of the courting gift -a fucking courting gift- Steve presented him with those exceptionally looking blue eyes, blue eyes that always managed to hypnotize the genius like no one else ever could.
Thankfully a metallic sound could be heard right way, Bucky, due to his quick reflexes, was able to catch the mug before it could create a big mess right beneath Peter’s feet.
If the man found out Peter kind of blackmailed Captain America for his own personal advantages he’d sure be grounded for life. Or for till College according to his mother, he thought amused.
A few minutes passed with heavy breathing sounding through the dark room. Both men tried to catch their breaths, being exhausted from the sheer blissful orgasms both just experimented.
It was simply overwhelming the young pup.
Not because his AI alarmed him or Steve’s Super Soldier ass, who was asleep already snoring on the couch, sensed any danger.
For once something was working out. Now he only had to face Tony and present his courting gift, in hopes of scouring a date in the end.
Tony, he was stunning like that.
Steve was just too much for him.
A few seconds later Steve’s grunts got louder, muffled moans sounding through the room.
With that the Omega kept walking through the living room on, clearly steering for Steve’s bedroom. The Alpha was gazing at the determined looking man and grinned lightly while releasing another purr. Such a thoughtful Omega he had.
Tony presented his neck at the slight use of the Alpha voice and moaned out in want and lust. Head resting on the bedding and throat including scent glands in perfect view for the Alpha, he stared at the man beneath his lashes with a loose grin. “Okie dokie, Alpha.”
Peter squinted his doe eyes at the tall man and whined loudly at the implication. “Clumsy?! I’m pretty sure I have more qualities than that!”
After a few moments though they accidentally nudged Thor, who was still sat at the counter just finishing his breakfast. The god now ridden with energy jumped up excitedly and with not even straining a single muscle, lifted all three of them up in the air.
Steve gasped loudly. “I wouldn’t ‘offer myself up’, it’s not like that,” he said. “Uhm- can I be bold?”
The headspace was literally only a certain amount of time in which an Omega could only concentrate on an Alpha’s presence close to them, a prominent need to seek comfort which did not leave any room for other thought. It was usually caused by trauma, panic or pain, so it wasn’t a surprise the pup dropped.
“You better have a good excuse for the fact that it’s nearly noon and none of you have eaten anything sooner,” the low threatening voice of Natasha reached the Omega’s ears.
Thor joined Clint’s laughter and even the two boys, who looked spooked just a few moments ago, sported grins, clearly amused at a grown adult being dealt with by their mother.
They did it.
“However sometimes I even managed to convince my ma to come along with me, which was quite an act, since she wasn’t the type to eat anywhere other than home”, Steve smiled fondly at the memory. “After she died I never really visited the place again, so when I woke up after, you know, I was a little desperate to just find something that had the ability to link the future to the past other than a few objects”.
Natasha sighed into the disheveled hair of her chaotic friend and traced his neck along the man’s nape, keeping a lookout for any new changes, which have happened more than ever since both her teammates got their shit together more or less.
Tony was happy, having his kid so close all the time. He might won’t say it out loud, but he just wanted to protect Peter and having him around during the week calmed down his anxiety immensely. And besides, getting up every morning, or rather getting pulled off the bed by Steve after sleeping through his alarm, to make Peter breakfast and send him off to school was so domestic. Sickly, sweet, domestic. Tony was, to his own bafflement, a sucker for domestic and could happily get used to their new spiel for the rest of his life.
“Sir, you’ve reached the penthouse”, the calming voice of Jarvis cut through his messed up thoughts, which Tony honestly was thankful for. Having a mental breakdown twice after spending the night with Captain America really wasn’t on his bucket list.
It was all so confusing!
His heart yearned innerly at the thought of snuggling his pups and just caring for them, taking in the scent of family and content pups.
The still growling Alpha stopped as soon as the loud high pitched moan left the heat struck Omega in front of him.
Only moments later the scent of Omega slick reached his nose as a familiar, round ass was shoved into his face. And oh damn. The Omega positioned himself above the Alpha, facing his oozing cock and presenting his still clothed hole to the Alpha’s face. It was just like Steve always imagined it would be like and so much more at the same time. The scent, the thick smell of just Tony, his sweet slick, covered him seemingly and the Alpha looked on in a blissful state.
A few seconds later Tony managed to look out of the windows without wincing at the light every time he merely blinked and finally noticed the great city skyline of New York, the many skyscrapers and their windows glimmering in the early morning rays of light. A view, Tony was sure, you could only take in like that from the Avengers tower. One reason he and Pepper designed the tower with a certain height in the middle of Manhattan, wanting to experience a dash of freedom and tranquility in a busy and stressful city.
And just like that his kids were openly awake. He should have guessed.
Tony, clearly not satisfied with the non existing response walked up to the boy carefully and to his horror he didn’t even notice. “Peter have you been awake the whole night?”, he placed a hand on the small boy’s shoulder and shook him ever so slowly.
Maybe he should get Steve a gift as well. Just to change some things up, not as traditional, but the genius really just wanted to give something back, to show his appreciation. Steve has done a damn lot since they started this whole thing and it was starting to weight on Tony’s conscience.
The genius smiled at her placing his hands above hers, his scent glands emitting a calming  omegan smell. “It’s fine Tasha, just a little later than usual I guess. And regarding breakfast, you know it’s nest Sunday,” Tony answered easily. “If anything it was the pups’ fault I couldn’t leave the nest sooner.”
“Mom, where were you after the date? We waited in the nest for you!”, the question coming from his youngest who was currently pressing his face against the man’s neck broke Tony’s heart somewhat. How selfish he was! His pups, they waited for him god knows for how long and what did Tony do in the meantime? Fuck Captain America.
And maybe, a big maybe, he longed for the soothing presence of the tall Alpha.
An energy drink. Hallelujah.
Steve listened to the shrieks and laughs coming from the kitchen and sighed deeply. Well, time for plan B.
“I. Do. Not. Snore”, Tony hissed and god, did he wish he could glare at the blond right now, but due to their position it was impossible. “Why can’t you mindlessly look at your phone like everyone else does after waking up?”
“Mom? Is Harley alright?”, Peter asked carefully and stepped closer slowly, the need to make sure his older brother was alright overpowering him completely.
Steve cleared his throat awkwardly, feeling the presence of the Omega beside him, affecting him strongly with the thickening sweet pheromones in the close space. The sweet, sweet smell Steve was able to smell once before. Innerly he growled wanting to just claim, take and possess. The Omega was so easily getting to him.
The pup looked at his brother once again with worry filled eyes, his older brother, his Alpha brother. He never really got sick, it was rather unusual for Harley to catch something, so why now? The whole thing didn’t seem right.
A few minutes later Steve’s trusts got more sloppy as the base of his cock kept swelling more and more, catching on the rim of the hole a few times. The Alpha sped up his strokes, making the mess of an Omega moan out once again.
The brown haired Omega beside Rhodey watched the unusual behaviour of the Alpha closely, whatever made the man speechless he shrugged mentally.
Ideally with a certain blond, muscular Alpha.
Though when he opened the door to the car the sight that greeted him brought back the excitement from the morning.
Mentally the Alpha cheered, already planning to thank Peter wholeheartedly afterwards.
The boy wanted to cry.
Ahh guys, I wanted to update this chapter way sooner than today but I've been staying at a hospital for nearly three weeks now and I really didn't have the time to write as much as I would have liked to.
His cock was twitching at only the thought.
A few low mumbles escaped the pup’s mouth and Tony’s ears strained to pick up a few words. The hatred in the pup’s voice chilled Tony to the core, only making him purr more, wishing the child would finally calm down.
“This was a mistake”, the Omega stated simply with his eyes trained on his plate.
Peter yawned once more before answering. “Yeah I did! What time is it anyway?”.
Clint erupted into mocking laughter on the counter and Tony shrieked at the displace. “SIDEKICK?!”
The Omega’s eyes widened once more at the Alpha’s words and he gulped audible. “You don’t mean that”. His Omega instincts were going crazy inside his head, making the man dizzy from its sheer pressure.
“Ohh genius against genius, the take down of the century!”, Clint all of sudden hollered across the room, riling up the kids even more so.
“Always, Steve, as long as it’s you.”
Yet, the intertwined hands on the table did prove the exact opposite.
“Morning Mr. America! Morning Happy!”, he waved while buckling his seat belt.
His boyfriend was already waiting in the hallway, extending his hand wordlessly, nodding towards their bedroom.
Like that all of them got back to preparing breakfast, with Steve cooking away at the stove, still with an embarrassed blush on his cheeks, Tony making much needed coffee and the other for trying to set the table. Setting the table wasn’t easy, Tony had to admit, since it wasn’t always clear how many people who lived in the tower would actually join.
“And what would that be?”
The close touch to his back made goose bumps appear on the man’s skin. The hands were big and warm, the hands of his Alpha, as they wandered downwards, grasping his rear in a firm hold and presenting Tony’s gaping hole.
“Captain, sir, what-”, the teacher got pale and stammered at the presence of the famous living legend.
“At least I didn’t get kicked out of preschool for blowing up the break room.”
Steve didn’t like this, didn’t like using his Alpha voice. But seeing Tony like a submissive Omega, similar to the ones in those old movies he liked, turned him on to no end. His cock was throbbing painfully, eyes darkening the more seconds passed.
Slowly he lifted the blonds arms from his waist and put the arm back down, carefully not to wake the sleeping beauty. The man just let out a groan and rolled over. Thank god.
It was hopeless in Tony’s eyes.
For him, curious as he was, he invented the perfect all nighter shake.
“However the damage was done nonetheless. I had two pups who grew up without their father and Harley took it even worse, the Alpha figure in his life being ripped from him once again. Both of them are as clingy as they are because I couldn’t offer them more. offer them a real family. And as you noticed Harley still doesn’t really know how to act as an Alpha even though he’s already fourteen. And that all because of me.”
At least no one wiped his face full of sauce afterwards, Peter kept thinking absently.
“Alpha, Steve, fuck me already you coward.”
Tony begged innerly that Steve wouldn’t judge him too much after he finished his story. Many Alphas wouldn’t hesitate to slutshame him cruelly due to the conception of Harley, old notion still firmly set inside their heads that an Omega shouldn’t have sex outside of a mating.
“Thank you Happy, you’re the best!”, Peter cheered to which Steve gave him a thumbs up, nothing could stand in the way of the boy’s plans now.
The Omega blinked at the unfamiliar pressure around his throat, it was, well, weird. But his instincts flared at the material that was covering up his scent marks, like he as an Omega achieved something great. On the way to being mated. Tony had a hard time wrapping his head around the idea. A few weeks ago he never would have thought at some point in his life he’d be wearing a collar given to him by Captain America.
I left this fic for a while, and I honestly wasn't going to update. But then I remembered how many ppl that have read this and have been unsatisfied because I gave up on a story they enjoyed. I have felt that way myself about many incomplete stories. Thats why I wanted to update, fo atleast give you guys something. I know its really late and over a year has passed and im really sorry. I hope you enjoyed the chapter.
He tried to stand up, but his arms were unable to support his weight, and he fell back down. Was he getting fatter?
Helen raised her head and glared at him. "Why would he do it for attention?"
Tony's recovery definitely wouldn't be easy, but Steve likes to do things the hard way anyway.
Tony mumbled something inaudible.
"Please tell us. We want to help him," Natasha quietly begged.
(See the end of the chapter for
Nobody disagreed. Tomorrow, when Tony was well-rested, they would show him just how much he meant to them.
Bruce nodded. "Tell me what Tony says..."
Steve shook his head. "No Bruce, I think it would be best if you stayed with Clint. You have the most medical experience out of all of us, after all."
As the team settled on the couch, Tony noticed that they all sat very close to him. Not that he minded. Steve was sitting the closest to him, with his arm brushing against Tony's at every move. Tony carefully didn't come any closer to him and kept his face on this TV as the movie started.
He walked into the bathroom to see the damage, but to his surprise, there was no blood. Who cleaned it?
Steve nodded. "I know, but he shouldn't be able to get away with some like this either."
Bruce stood up. "Do what, Tony?"
When Steve woke up, he felt a body close to his and quickly opened his eyes tensing. However, when he saw who is was, he held on tighter. His arms were wrapped around Tony's body. Tony shifted a bit in his arms.
All over Tony's limp arms were cuts, obviously self inflicted. And Steve quickly saw Tony's legs, in a worse condition than the brunette's arms. Steve exhaled, and his eyes caught sight of a sharp knife with dried blood on it.
Tony's face quickly because red as he saw that Steve was laying next to him. The proximity made his skin tingle... Just as he was about to get up, Steve wrapped his arms around him sleepily. Tony let out a small gasp. Steve brought him closer and whispered, "Stay..."
To his surprise the man out of time actually had some game! Who would have thought?
Thank you for sticking with me tho!!!
So when his aunt May told him, she’d be gone for two weeks, her job demanding her to go to the west coast for a few meetings, he already knew where he was going to stay. Obviously his Dad’s place, the Avengers tower.
“Oh, Mr. Roger, sir! Could I have a word with you in private for a second there?” Mr. Johnson asked eagerly as he rushed over to the two.
“If I didn’t want you I wouldn’t be standing here right now, presenting the makeshift gift of mine in hopes of you accepting my courtship”, Steve called out, slowly stepping closer to the trembling Omega across the room. “And god, Tony, you don’t even know how many times I’ve tried to give you a courting gift this week. But turns out you’re harder to reach than I would have thought”, Steve admitted with a light smile, scent of hope flooding the room, combining both scents once again, similar to the heat they spend together.
Next thing he knows a hot mouth pressed against his own with a brute, filthy force. The Alpha was forcing his tongue into the Omega’s mouth right away, wanting to taste everything the man had to offer and more.
It was so fucking coupley, Tony wanted to scream. Though, out of joy or panic he wasn’t totally sure. However he was sure that he loved the feel of Steve’s warm and soft lips against his own.
Thanks for reading and all the sweet comments on the previous chapter!
Ah, Steve remembered. The code, the only reason he’s gotten this far with Tony the past days. Well, he should have guessed the small Stark planned something and wouldn’t just give him the numbers without having a repayment in mind.
Clint fucking Barton was sitting cross legged on the counter, plate in his left hand and muffin half eaten in his right. Steve wanted to scream at the sight.
Tony snorted. “Coffee and an energy drink combined with a superpowered kid, that is.”
His heat must have ended and, oh, right.
Tony just knew it, he knew his youngest pup was plotting something.
The brown haired boy didn’t quite catch the sentences directed at him at first, content to bury his face into his mother’s stomach again while letting out a string of small, high pitched, whines. Noises typical for an awakening pup, full of annoyance but satisfaction nevertheless. Yet, after a while of Tony raking his hand through his hair and Harley smiling down at him, having rested his head on the older Omega’s shoulder again, Peter bleakley opened his eyes.
Not in front of the Omega he was so desperately trying to court.
Tony snorted at the cheesy answer but let the topic slide. If this was something you had to get used to when dating Steve, he’d gladly comply.
Only he didn’t and rather wanted to fuck himself on the perfect, all-American dick once again. Repetitiously, of course.
Turns out the office was more of a small home library, with rows and rows of old looking cupboards filled with books and historic looking desk between the rows. Steve was honestly in awe at the sight.
Him and relationships just didn’t get along. Never before and Tony highly doubted this time would be any different.
Tony interrupted both of his, now rambling, kids. “Okay, you know what?! I’ll just make both before you two kill each other,” he stated exasperated as a deep sigh left his lips. So much for a peaceful Sunday morning. Not in this family, apparently.
‘Alphas’, Tony thought annoyed while rolling his eyes.
“Uhh- are you- is everything- uhh alright?”, Steve timidly asked from beside the couch, looking at the pup with wide eyes.
A hand on his arm suddenly ripped him out of his, probably self loathing, thoughts and okay, Tony noted duly. The touch was warm and dare he even say inviting as Steve’s strong arms settled on his waist, Super Soldier surrounding him from all sides. No fair game play, though Tony couldn’t seem to care.
Steve only hoped his first date after being awoken from the ice wasn't going to be a total disaster.
“Do you expect me to throw my shield at the kid?”
“You’re still not eating,” the blond Alpha stated matter of fact, raising an eyebrow. “Omega,” he said while gazing into his eyes, the comment clear as day within the taunting word.
And shamefully it was working on Tony, making him emit a purr in appreciation, a blush quickly covered his cheeks as he reached for the Alpha’s hand once again to be pulled up. No one ever, in his whole goddamn life, went out of his way like this for Tony.
Tony’s eyes gazed at the bag immediately, like it was some kind of bomb waiting to go off, like something dangerous and not to be trusted. The wariness on his face explained it all.
“Steveee, what are we doing?”, Tony asked as another whine left his mouth and the grip on his waist tightened.
Now he just had to do one more thing to officially declare this lunch date a complete success.
Steve smiled at the man politely and promptly stood up to offer the older man his hand in a greeting. “It’s nice to meet you Mr. Johnson, I hope you don’t mind me tagging along with Peter today, I’m part of his project,” the blond finished with a flashing smile, putting on his Captain America charm. Everything to keep the gruff teacher from scolding Peter one more time.
Like that the blond slowly lowered the band around the man’s neck, taking in the goosebumps that promptly appeared on the Omega’s skin at the contact, Steve smoothly buckled the collar. Taking in the sight Steve lost his breath.
Steve would back him up for sure.
Tony couldn’t believe the view in front of him. The Alpha greedily lapping his slick of his fingers, while letting out deep purrs. The Omega was close to howling.
Tony’s reaction was intense, his cock shooting out cum just at the mere touch of the Alpha.
Steve was feeling similar, clenching his eyes shut and concentrating on the tight, hot grip around his cock. Shit, did the Omega feel good. The Alpha could already feel his knot forming, after a mere minute! That never happened before!
After two days, he was exhausted and he still wasn’t nearly done with the essay. Dark, purple bags under his eyes and trembling hands reached for the coffee machine on the counter, while his ears were slightly ringing.
Steve stepped in right away, taking the boy out of his lover’s arms and hoisting him into his arms. “No school today.”, he stated.
Hell just thinking about their eating habits when the Omega wasn’t available during his heat send warning signals to his brain. Without him both boys would probably end up dying from scurvy at one point.
Nest mornings were their favourite.
Leaning down his head just above the wet hole, Steve simply couldn’t stop himself. Having to taste the Omega one more time before finally being able to breed him.
“I thought you were a genius, but honestly, you’re acting like such an idiot.”
“Your friends are truly something kid,” the blond sighed out and scratched his head lightly.
Tony instinctively held the boy closer and rubbed his nose against the pups scent glands, taking in his scent. “Alphas riling each other up. That’s what happened.”
In that moment Steve was breathless as he stared at the Omega. So beautiful. So beautiful and all his. His to take and call his own.
“You better prove it then, Alpha”, he looked up with a nervous grin.
“Let me accompany you through your heat. I’m not the most experienced and I tend to get lost in my instincts, making me rather feral, as you’ve already seen. But I know I can satisfy you,” the Alpha cockily grinned at his last statement, crossing his arms in front of his muscled chest with a growl. He splayed his legs open, clearing the view to his rather well endowed cock.
A tingling tension that made both men heat up and look at anything but each other.
Best gift ever.
Jason only rolled around on the floor with a bared neck and wide eyes but did not answer the Captain.
The blond smiled openly at the sight in front of him, the smart Omega working on something Steve had no clue about, god, he was so bright and it made his inner instincts preen proudly.
He totally strayed away from everything, wrapped up by Steve’s usual sweetheart act and their previous friendship. The bitter taste of realization spread in his mouth and the man had to put down his cutlery for a second to not be swallowed up by overwhelmingness.
Now the whole family was sat in the common room in front of the huge, especially designed, TV, currently deciding on what to watch.
“It was Peter.”
At least now he had a bit of quiet and peace, since the other Avengers left for a mission a few minutes ago and wouldn’t be back until tomorrow morning. Thank god.
And maybe a part of him was, perhaps, a little jealous.
Though the voice of the young Omega pup cut through the tension thankfully. “Uncle Clint, have you ever seen this really old movie with the guy in the goth diving suit and the inaccurate physical laws in space?”
It wasn’t that anything was wrong with his living arrangement, or the other Avengers or, hell even his Dad. No, turns out, school was the culprit, trying to ruin his life all over again.
Steve’s eyes dilated at the hot sight in front of him. Tony getting himself off and smelling like the tastiest treat in history, a perfect Omega in heat.
The young Alpha was leaning against the doorframe of his mother’s bedroom, intensely staring at the two adults and especially the dressed up Omega in the middle of the room. A happy scent, he was already able to smell down the hallway a few seconds ago, clouded his mind and making his own instincts react positively.
Though the genius had no time contemplating the adorable sight of his pup as a much deeper and loud growl reached his ears.
Tony couldn’t stop the voices that escaped him, too caught up in the pure bliss he was feeling, the Alpha playing his body like a fine instrument.
However it didn’t. The only thing the Alpha did was spur his inner Alpha side on like crazy, a boiling feeling of anger settling in his stomach with a strong side of possessiveness and the need to protect. Protect his family.
“So yeah, basically he yelled at me to get rid of it, that a child would ruin his oncoming career. He didn’t want to do anything with it and kept blaming me for not taking birth control like ‘every Omega should be on at all times’. His words not mine”, Tony said with a shrug.
His heart warmed at the thought but at the same time his mind drowned in anxiety and panic.
“It’s probably from the grocery store, Thor’s purchase if I had to guess. Guy loves sweet stuff”, Tony explained. “Now put it away or so help me you two will live of vegetables the rest of your lives!”
“Hey, watch it! You were the one who spilled the drink in the first place!!”
The Avengers, or rather the awake ones, Tony, Steve, Natasha and Bucky looked on in horror as the zombie like teen filled his mug to the brim.
A comforting scent reached Tony’s nose, replacing the sour and bitter smell of disappointment as he was softly embraced by the Alpha, the familiar feeling of his friend’s close contact settled his nerves for the moment as he took in the surrounding smell.
There was no turning back was it? Steve sighed once more and began walking alongside Peter, who was walking with his head cast downwards avoiding the many unbelievable stares of his baffled classmates.
Why the hell was Peter helping Steve court his mother?
The other Alpha at the table reacted similarly, gripping the table even tighter and Tony could have sworn he heard a crack. But before Steve could open his mouth Tony continued.
A sudden knock sounded through his room. making the pup pull his warm blanket over his face in frustration. “Pete, get up or else you’ll be late for school!”, the voice of his mother called as the man opened the door to his son’s room.
“260418, thank me later”, the pup said, gleaming at Steve brightly.
What a day, the blond thought exasperated.
And what?
This time, plan D, he prepared to give the Omega something more personal, which took the man more time than he’d like to admit.
But, yeah, apparently Steve just couldn’t be a team player for once.
“Tony, what did you do?”, the wary voice of his best friend reached Tony’s ears,
Taking the boy from Tony’s arms he carried him to his room and tucked him in, letting out a deep sighed as he finally closed the door.
Tony, still having his balled fists in front of his face, grimaced at the sudden intensified pressure against his side and the pair of blue eyes trained on his face. Too soon, fuck, he thought the man would be asleep longer, leaving enough time for Tony to calm down.
Thankfully though Peter’s mind was bad at staying focused on one thing for too long, so a few minutes into the drive he was looking out of the window again and excitedly pointing out a few buildings he seemed interesting enough to direct Steve’s eyes at. Questions like ‘Was that building already there back in your days, Mr. Captain?’, ‘Do you know where the first Mc Donald’s opened in Manhatten?’ and ‘Even though Superheroes are a real life thing, isn’t it weird that cities are absent of any statues build in their honor? Wouldn’t you want a statue, Cap?’ soon followed the pup’s excitement. Steve was for all that mattered quite overwhelmed, but also so very fond of the curious nature of the child next to him as he tried to answer any single question he threw at him, while Happy occasionally let out a light chuckle.
His mother waited expectantly and the pup exhaled with still rosy cheeks.
Oh, one more thing! Is it obvious that English isn't my first language???
Tony wasn’t the talking kind.
With a sour look he retreated, mumbling out a quick “I’m sorry Tony” and fleeing from the office.
Peter was really happy how his life turned out to be.
“TONY!”, Steve cut through the rambling with a sudden booming voice. “God, what are you even talking about?”
Not even a second later an alarm sounded off in the living room, making Tony cry out himself in pain. “Jarvis, what the hell?”
“You better start fucking me now Steve,” the genius moaned out, hand reaching down to rub his palm against his aching cock.
God, Steve was freaking out innerly, if nothing he could still pretend it was all a joke and call the whole thing off.
Not wanting to tell his Dad, because, well, he’s Tony Stark, someone who’d call his teachers explaining for over one hour why his son deserved better. Peter just couldn’t risk it.
But after a while he got thirsty, walking up to the sink he quickly filled a glass with cool water. However, when he turned around it was already too late.
Tony didn’t wait one second and promptly licked across the glistening head, tasting the precum on his tongue, something he didn't get to do last time. Then he slowly lowered his mouth around the whole tip, moving his lips and tongue in a massaging manner. His hands travelled up the firm, muscled thighs of the Alpha and  finally settled on the base. With a tight grip he losened the Alpha’s own hands from around the cock and placed his around the girth instead, moving his hands up and down in a steady motion.
An Omega that owned many of the typical Alpha traits. It was a turn off.
Considering everything Peter was glad he asked Steve to do this.
That was truly his kid up there.
Maybe it was his heat sabotaged Omega brain but the next think he knew Tony was crawling towards Steve, like a cat advancing its prey. He was feeling even warmer now, his cock still painfully hard but now his slick was mainly the problem, leaving his whole backside wet.
“It’s fucking obvious Steve! You and me, we just don’t fit, it’s- I’m not made out to be a proper mate”, Tony quickly forced out with eyes downcast. “You can’t be that ignorant not to see it. Which is why we shouldn’t be here right now, pretending this date could evolve into something else, something unspeakably stupid.”
The man in the front just rolled his eyes fondly at the kid’s antics but didn’t say anything else. Oh and mentioning kids. “Anyway, where’s your brother, has he gotten lost on the way to the car once again?”
The others, still watching the scene delighted, began laughing as soon as Thor swept up the three, awe struck geniuses, with ease. Clint adding a quick ‘Thor 1 - Starks 0’ between laughter. The God just grinned with triumph and even Tony, Harley and Peter, having forgotten the fight prior, were cackling.
“Not many people know, probably only a handful at best, which I intended from the start. So you’re probably aware that I got pregnant with Harley when I was only twenty, still in college working on my second phd and trying to wrangle the remains of Stark Industries after my parents passed two year earlier. It wasn’t planned obviously, not the right timing at all and besides that I wasn’t even in a proper relationship during that time”, Tony explained slowly with a grimace, ot daring to cast one look at the other man.
The boy, in question, at first didn’t react at all, way too concentrated on his webs to be paying any attention to the adult in the room. Though, a loud cough, thanks to Steve, pulled the teen from his deep thoughts.
(See the end of the chapter for
A loud sneeze interrupted the man suddenly. The Omega was sneezing loudly, not seeming to stop all of sudden.
Moaning like the little slut in heat he was, Steve continued his spiel, tongue sneaking deeper and rubbing against his walls hotly. A mess of spit and slick was pooling out of the hole and creating a puddle on the bedding beneath them.
Stopping right between Steve’s legs the Omega leaned down shortly. The spicy scent of Steve’s raising arousal hit his nose straight on, their pheromones mingling together due to their closeness. And like that he placed small licks over the still clothed bulge in the Alpha’s scent, making him groan in anticipation.
Quickly he hoisted up the Omega into his arms and walked through the door of his bedroom, all while keeping a firm grip on the round ass in his hands. As soon as the door closed Steve placed the whining Omega down on his soft mattress, now looking down at the whimpering figure with a smirk.
Peter was amusingly watching the stumbling Alpha, who kept his eyes traced on the ground and scent with a strong bitter hint.
“But first I gotta get you ready.”
Yeah, Tony truly was fucked.
Taking in the scene in front of him, still with a half asleep brain, the pup started purring right away out of pure happiness. The warmth and close proximity to his Omega parent and sibling made his scent glands emit a strong wave of content Omega smell, branding the whole nest. Peter nuzzled closer to his family, damn, he could stay like that forever.
“He’s not my fucking Alpha”, Tony grumbled lowly at Clint’s words but continued walking closer nonetheless.
“Three days?!”
Steve groaned, the Omega clenching down on his cock once again. The heat, the closeness, Steve simply couldn’t get enough.
The silence that followed covered the table in an awkward atmosphere, everyone now concentrated on their food.
Steve nodded perplexed at his Omega and complied, not wanting to feel another exasperated look from the man. Damn, this must be how the pups felt plenty of times during the day.
Turns out he was right. The boy waved him off right away, saying he wasn’t good at writing essays anyway and if Peter wanted a good grade he’s have to do it, plain and simple.
It was times like this Steve cursed his limited understanding of technology.
Tony briefly looked around the small place and shook his head as an answer. “Not that I know of, no”.
“Harley”, Tony warned from beside him, not wanting another fight to happen so soon after the other one.
“I used the code”, the taller man admitted easily with a shrug and before Tony could open his mouth to ask any questions the Alpha stretched out his palm, opening it and revealing a small black satin bag.
The Alpha just grinned sheepishly at him. “You looked like you could need a hand?”
“Just making sure you get the perfect treatment you deserve, Omega”, he replied easily and held out his hand in question. “Shall we go?”
“And whose fault was that because-”
When they reached their home Steve parked the car in the garage once again and got out of the vehicle quickly to open the door for Tony once more. After all the date wasn’t over yet and the Alpha loved acting around the Omega like that, his instincts guiding him.
“That’s fair, I guess. What do you have in mind?”
Steve growled lightly at the comment, his inner Alpha not taking lightly to the boldness of the Omega’s comment, for it usually being a threat to his abilities as an Alpha. Still, with Tony it was different he forced to remind himself. The challenge was a part of the brunette, the snarky attitude what made Tony the way he was.
The other man stared at the strong hand in front of him, the hand that has touched him already in the most intimate way. He sighed internally, just wanting it to be over with now and slowly placed his hand onto Steve’s. “Sure, whenever you’re ready”.
Then the car was already off again and leaving both standing in front of the school, one wearing a grin and the other looking worriedly at the building.
Steve looked at Peter with a shrug and nodded at the teacher, who was already pulling out sheets of paper, probably to be signed by the hero.
Steve’s mind took in the words and well yes it was true sometimes he missed his past, the time before the ice and most importantly his friends, who were mostly dead now.
However Harley clearly challenged the older Alpha and Steve wasn’t having it.
In hindsight he probably shouldn’t have been left alone in the kitchen, otherwise he would have never gotten the idea. Though, roughly five minutes later he was brewing coffee eagerly.
No one was bothering them, probably already aware what was going on and food being no problem since Tony, to no one’s surprise, always had a small stocked fridge in his room.
As he reached the living room again he felt a pair of curious eyes on him.
Bruce thought about it for a second before answering the young Omega. “Well, according to the rules of pack dynamics the place of team leader, just another title for pack Alpha, can be-”
Yet, when the food arrived and Steve happily asked the Omega if he wanted to try his meal Tony was brought back to reality.
Ready to be wrecked, ready to be taken.
The Alpha was looking at him with hopeful eyes clearly waiting on an answer. And Tony, well, his mind was in pieces. One part of himself screamed at him to run and hide, not worthy enough to date the Alpha and far too messed up to be the Omega mate of someone like Captain America.
“Twelve years ago, after Peter was born”, Tony breathed out, staring at the cold food in front of him, memories from his past swimming in his head, clouding his scent in sorrow. It never meant to get to this point, the point of him having to tell Steve about his past relationships and especially how his pups came to be.
The Alpha growled playfully at the reaction, carefully placing his hands on the man’s waist, squeezing the flesh lightly.
Soo lots of angst..
A small smile graced Tony’s lips. “Tired”, he mumbled before a yawn came out of his mouth.
Steve smiled awkwardly at the pissed expression of his Omega. “I’m just gonna go, I promised Bucky we’d train together after lunch.”
But only a few hours later a loud ringing sounded off in the room and both of them were ripped from their precious sleep. Ugh.
Soon enough they arrived at a big brick building with several kids in front, Midtown Middle School, a school focused on science and technology. A perfect place for kids like Harley and Peter.
Like that the boy cried out a meekly ‘yes’ and quickly vanished from the Alpha’s sight when he nodded at him to go with his strong Alpha demander.
Thankfully the Beta didn’t ask any more questions and simply told him he’d be in front of the school as soon as possible.
The Alpha chuckled at the man and rolled her eyes fondly
And, well, what was Tony supposed to say after receiving the gift?
What time was it he thought groggily. He followed a pleasant smell towards the kitchen blindly and came to a stop in the doorway. His Dad and Steve were both working at the counter, cooking what looked and smelled like homemade Spaghetti.
“Goodnight, Tony.”
“It’s fine Steve”, Tony interrupted the starting apology in a flash, not wanting the Alpha to be caught in such a moment. “I like listening to your old man stories even if it’s hard to believe”, he offered with honest eyes, a grin prominent on his face. The fresh, sweet scent of serenity underlined the Omega’s feelings and simultaneously eased the Alpha’s mind.
God, he needed his face to move closer, tasting the sweet creature above him just like he did during Tony’s heat. He needed a constant reminder of the Omega’s slick.
Tony’s purrs halted to a stop as his ears picked up the feral sounding growls coming from his neck all out of the blue. His pup, was tightening his hold while his scent turned into a bitter, pissed off smell. What the? The Omega looked at the child confused, but pressed himself closer nonetheless. Stroking through his blond locks with one hair and purring once again while rubbing his head lovingly against the Alpha’s scent glands Tony hoped it would calm the growls down to a certain degree.
“Good Morning Peter, I hope you have slept well,” the voice of Captain America greeted him welcoming. America’s smile really could lift everyone’s spirit.
The man was his mother, for god’s sake.
Though this time he couldn’t seem to find any regret flooding his mind. With that comforting thought Tony fell into a peaceful slumber with Steve by his side.
The next morning Tony awoke drowsy, lying on a harder mattress than he was used to and feeling a warm pressure behind him pressed up to his backside. The presence of a heavy arm weighted down his side, caging the Omega’s body in, the firm grip on his waist making the genius frown lightly out of surprise.
“I’m aware lover boy. It’s alright I’ll call the school and you bring the kid to bed.”
Next chapter will feature the pups and clarify why Peter even helped Steve in the first place.
Yeah, that Peter.
A few hours later after everyone settled down and, yes to Steve’s satisfaction, Tony did eat breakfast, the team decided on a lazy afternoon. Meaning movie marathon in the common room, much to Peter’s and Harley’s delight.
Also this chapter is so freaking long it kinda even surprised myself. The usual chapters of this work aren't that long, it just turned out like this because many important things happen this time.
Just like that both men breathed out exhausted, lying on the bed in a sweaty heap of limbs, at a loss for words and just plainly staring off into nothingness.
Tony grinned, facing his oldest, Natasha standing beside him now with a small smirk on her lips as well. “Sure cuddle bear.”
In the process of turning the Omega managed, like the graceful person Tony was, to turn widely and ultimately rub up against the Alpha’s crotch. Which was, hard, rock hard. The blond let out a low grumble at the contact and Tony could feel heat rushing to his cheeks, pheromones spiking at the sudden wave of pleasure.
The deep sigh from the front of the car caught his attention immediately, though not an unusual occurrence in the morning. Happy, the ever tired looking man, who has dealt with their mother for a long time now and consequently also dealt with his kids, was gazing at the brown haired boy through the rearview mirror with a cocked eyebrow.
The beautiful Omega silently provoked him, the now pleasant, content smell from the man, which replaced the anxiety ridden smell, was tickling his nose in the most teasing manner and he had to stop himself from sniffing loudly every few seconds.
Steve growled impatiently and snarled loudly at the whimpering kid. “I said UNDERSTOOD?!”
“Omega, would you like to go onto a date with me?”, Steve suddenly asked with a serious look, taking Tony’s wrist into his hands, stroking the bracelet and his skin tenderly.
Raising his hands to calm down the blabbering pup Tony cleared his throat. “Slow down pup, you’re making your old Ma’s head spin. What idea are we talking about?”
Soon both reached Peter’s homeroom after whispers followed them wherever they went, now rumors already probably spreading around the school in a flash. The second ring of the bell went off just as Peter and Steve sat down at a table in the back with stares, of course, wordlessly gazing at them surprised. Peter’s phone was also constantly vibrating, texts from Ned surely being the cause.
Tony, now being able to see the situation was in, furrowed his brows in surprise. “Yeah I’m over here, stuck in...Peter’s webs?”
He didn’t plan on having sex with him twice in less than 24 hours period.
Hearing the unmistakable title coming from the Omega’s voice as the pressure on his hardening cock intensified ripped a deep moan from Steve. Out of instinct he trusted forward, chasing the sweet smell coming from the man lying in front of him.
However, as he stood in his living room, or rather the common room of the Avengers Tower and looked at the feathers scattered across the floor and footprints decorating his ceiling, he wasn’t so sure anymore.
“Turns out he had rather old fashioned ideas of Omegas and he tried to force me to be a ‘perfect house omega’. I was already pregnant with Peter during that time, which just spurred him on even more until the point he dared to use his Alpha voice to forbid me from entering my lab. Rhodey and Pepper thankfully stepped in and kicked him out right before Peter was born”, Tony sighed tiredly at the memory.
So, yeah, in that case why bring a person like Captain America to school, someone that’s draw the attention to him like the light attract mosquitoes?
“I will pick something to wear for you tonight and you go shower in the meantime, alright?”, she asked gently.
“Pathetic,” Jason spat as he leaned downwards to face the trembling Omega with an aggressive growl.
Around 3 am in the morning both, overly exhausted and panting heroes, got the kid down from the high ceiling and hugged the still rambling boy tightly. Content he was safe now, but mostly afraid he would run off again.
Finally the Alpha shook his hand one more time and nodded towards the present in his hand, expecting the Omega to take it off him. Though nothing like that happened and the genius rather took a few steps back, raising his hands as if trying to defend himself.
Strong arms then hoisted him up and turned the Omega around carefully. Tony came face to face with a sweetly grinning Alpha. And if it weren’t for the drying slick on Steve’s chin Tony would have bought the innocent look the blond was wearing once again.
“Meet me in the common room in half an hour and I’ll have breakfast ready”, the blond smiled sweetly at the Omega, a content rumble being carried across the room reaching Tony.
His maternal instincts kicked in at the scene unfolding. His pup was in danger, his brain kept screaming at him. Challenging an older Alpha ranked way higher than Harley was dangerous and so, so stupid. The distressed Omega mother could only watch in fear.
He didn’t plan on running into Steve only a few hours after his heat. A few hours after the Alpha fucked him full of his cum, marked him up and knotted his hole, like the heat struck Omega he was.
Tony looked up, and stared at Bruce with wet eyes. "Bruce..."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony himself knew that he hadn't disobeyed orders just to be annoying. While Loki was busy annoying the rest of the team, he spotted a child no older than 5 walking alone on the sidewalk. But, that's not what made his heart stop. Behind the child about three feet away was a very angry man with a gun in his hand, pointing at the child head. Tony immediately went into action.
Steve felt his patience growing thin as he pleaded for access to Tony's lab. "Jarvis please! I need to see him!"
Now, Tony would argue that he wasn't depressed. And, he definitely wasn't suicidal. This was just an experiment. He just wanted to know how to feel again. His hand shaking, he slowly brought the knife down to his arm, rolled up his sleeve, and pressed it into his skin. It burned and he couldn't help but cry out at the pain. But, it also felt good in a way, and for once, he could really feel something. He quickly sliced another line into his arm and admired his work.
Tony ignored Clint and focused on Steve. "Steve, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I'm so fucking stupid. I know you're gonna kick me off the team for this but... please. This is all I have. You're all I have. Pepper's annoyed with me and Rhodey's been away at the army for months now. I know you guys hate me too, and I'm sorry I'm so worthless but please... at least let me stay at the tower. It's all I have," Tony said, close to crying.
Jarvis, that smug ass, said, "Sir, you never specified whether I could or could not disclose your location."
Tony stared at Steve for several moments, taking in his honest eyes and gentle, but guilty smile. Tony knew what his answer was.
He gave a bright smile that he knew looked a little forced and mumbled, "Fine, Birdbrain."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony blinked and said wetly, "Y-you're not kicking me off?"
He didn't wait to hear the team's reply as he bolted towards the bathroom, busting the door open and then slamming it shut. He grabbed a toothbrush from a cup on the sink and sat in front of the toilet. But he didn't even need to use to toothbrush because immediately he sat down, the pizza that he ate came out full force.
