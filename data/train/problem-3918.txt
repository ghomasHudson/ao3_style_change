you mean happiness to me
you’re the light of my life
We didn’t talk much at the breakfast or dinner table to not raise any suspicion among our colleagues, but whenever we sat there together he would give me that charming smile, or that cheeky grin that he always did when stealing food from my plate. Without me even having to ask for it he would pass me things. He just knew, maybe he could tell from my eyes scanning the table or he was familiar with my eating habits, either way he knew when to pass me the salt, and that made me appreciated and understood as never before.
"Yeah?" Dean asked, chewing down a piece of his cheeseburger.
Cas ran into him when he went into the kitchen to grab a glass of water. Dean was there at the counter when Cas came in, sneaking a handful of sweets out of the bowl next to the sink.
Dean asked Jo a thing or two about some calls she should have gotten and how they went, and while talking to her, he sneaked his arm around Cas's waist, pulling him a bit closer into him. Cas's response was a little smile with a glance over to Dean, but Jo showed no reaction.
“He knows,” I shrugged, “he’s suspected it for a while already and when he saw us last night, that was only the final proof. But we talked, and he said that he won’t make a fuss about it. As long as we keep it secret, he won’t make it public either”
"It's a compliment," he said, "you can take it"
it makes me sleep better.
everything. He understood why others before him had turned their backs to heaven, had betrayed the Great Plan, had betrayed God himself. He understood, because Humanity – or that one single human, in his case – was definitely worth it.
His grip around the phone immediately tightens. He stares at the comment for a second, his heart beating violently. His smile is gone.
Another little small talk chat during that Cas mostly learned that Garth, other than him, wasn’t directly employed by WMR music but that he was a freelancer who just spent most of his time working with Dean, then Garth started introducing Cas to the work that was expecting him. He gave him a short overview about what his job was exactly and what he did, then showed him some more detailed examples from previous songs' lyrics.
Cas read that note, and he read the lyrics again that said Dean wanted to spend the rest of his life with him, and he smiled. He smiled, and he pulled out another blue post-it.
“Sorry,” he immediately apologized. “I didn’t-“
"What should I have done in your opinion?" He chuckled. "I wasn't allowed to tell you that I know him. And apart from that, you were absolutely right, so ..."
"Great," Dean grinned. "Did you hear that, Claire? We're gonna get you some new ice cream"
and I can't, because this stupid hunt doesn't give me
This second of distraction gave me the chance to hastily close the notebook and push it off to the side before Dean looked down to me again.
"I'd love to be there, though," he said. "And Claire, too. She loves watching you"
out of hand. This was way too much smiling and staring, way too much of that warm, comfortable feeling Dean’s smile gave him. This wasn't-
"We're aware that this isn't a regular job and that it cuts deep into your personal life," he said. "I know we're asking a lot of you, and I'm really glad you agreed nevertheless. So, we're of course gonna appreciate your input financially"
Cas looked up and met Dean's eyes for a moment. "Thank you," he breathed. Then it was quiet again.
“Lies,” Dean mumbled.
“Why should I?” he asked. “What for?”
"I never said it has to be a one-night stand," Jo replied. "Who knows what it could be, or what it could become after the first step"
None of us spoke for a minute or two. We were just walking next to each other in silence, walking across the fields, now on the way back to the school again but still far enough away for the buildings to be hidden behind a group of trees.
"It really wasn't much effort for me," Dean smiled, "and definitely not hard work. I enjoyed it, really. It was fun. Though I do have some Disney songs stuck in my head"
"So my friend Jo," Cas explained, "you know, the one who signed the confidentiality agreement. She was really excited about the tour because she knows I worked on the songs and she wanted to come see one show, but that would've had to be the Topeka show, and that was the first one that sold out"
it makes me feel like home
And they continued to walk down the corridor until they reached the end. To the right, the woman had said. So, Cas turned to the right and knocked on the door.
Without hesitation he threw the sponge back into the sink and dried his hands on his shirt while running over into the living room. He found Claire sitting on the ground, covered in paint, a puddle of blue paint on the floor around her. The other three cups of paint were sitting off to the side untouched, and a sheet of paper with the start of a picture on it was to her left. In the midst of that chaos was Claire, blue stripes on her face, and her clothes one big stain, tears running down her face.
Mentioned it, yes, that was one way to put it. Just like
"Mh," Jo made, "Yeah, it's ... I mean it can be hard work, definitely, but Dean really kinda hit the bull’s eye. And he lives for it, that's for sure. He's in it with a lot of passion"
It was only a quick brush of skin against skin, of his lips against mine, but it made me feel like I would explode. My heart was suddenly beating faster, it felt like it would jump out of my chest at any moment, and there was that strange feeling sparkling in my stomach that must have been what people mean when they talk about butterflies.
"Yeah," Dean said. "I'm still working on it. I'm a bit stuck at the moment, though"
"Yeah," he agreed, "sure." And he followed Charlie through the heavy door, back down the stairs.
As I finally arrived, I came to stop right next to him. None of us said a word, we just stood there next to each other in silence.
"You're writing lyrics for Dean Winchester?" She breathed.
He eyed Cas for a moment in complete silence. He was looking into his eyes, and Cas just silently kept the eye contact. It felt good. Weird, in a way, but at the same time, good. Dean's eyes seemed familiar to him at this point.
That unexpected compliment immediately made Cas smile.
“Yeah,” I sighed. “There definitely are quite a number of those.” Then, after just a second, I added: “Do you want to talk about your father?”
I'm at the door now.
you're an idiot, that's what you are
Charlie and the other Jo were further in the back, silently discussing something, both of them with headsets on to be able to communicate with the security people and sound engineers.
"Me too," Dean said with a soft smile. It seemed like he wanted to add something, but they were interrupted by Charlie coming down the aisle and falling down in the seat next to Dean.
It was pretty much the same as the day before, and Cas felt pretty similar to how he did during their first kiss. He could feel his heart skipping a beat and then suddenly racing, and again he wished Dean would just stay with him like that forever.
“Well, I see you’ll get along,” Charles commented on our exchange. “Some company among the young folk, isn’t that nice?”
Dean sighed deeply before he finally turned to me.
"A really old friend, then"
First, he asked about how our break was so far, and if we celebrated Christmas. We only gave short answers (not necessarily to be rude, but really, what even was there to say?), and he soon went over to telling us about how his family was spending the holidays.
At the studio building, they met Dean and Jo who were waiting in Jo's office already. Jo patiently, Dean visibly nervously. He did calm down for a second when Claire noticed him and immediately ran towards him. With a smile he leaned down to greet her with a boop on the nose that made her chuckle, but as soon as the little girl had run over to Jo, he was back to his tense mood.
"Yeah, you know, I avoid bringing up legal advisor and brother in the same sentence, because sometimes people get sceptical about it. But also people are confused a lot when they don't know he's my brother and overhear us talking"
Looking at Dean's grin made Cas smile slightly as well.
They had an entire day scheduled with a professional photographer to shoot the album cover and some promotional pictures, and Dean wanted him to come. Cas didn't understand why exactly, since they would be inside a studio and there wouldn't be any people they weren't working with, but he decided to just go with it - as if he would've had any other option.
"You won't?"
"Okay," Dean replied. He kept the eye contact with Cas, and mirrored his smile. None of the two looked away, and none of them said anything.
Together, the two of them made some minor changes, like changing a preposition here and exchanging a word for one with a syllable more there, and at the fourth run, both were happy with the outcome.
He told Claire they were going to visit Dean's friend Jo, and Claire's mood lightened up immediately. Cas got himself cleaned up and changed his clothes, and right when he was helping Claire to get into her shoes, the doorbell rang.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright," Jo finally commented on it, "what is it? Are you guys doing a test run or something?"
"Novak?"
"Does it go both ways?" Cas now asked, looking at Dean again. "I mean, is it the same for me? Or is it just you touching me?"
Cas laughed out loud at that. "I highly doubt that," he laughed.
"Mh," Cas commented with a smirk to lighten the mood, "I'm rather sure most people are pretty serious about their thirst tweets"
"I didn't even do anything," Cas chuckled.
It was three paragraphs, three blocks of lines, nothing else. There was no title yet, but that wasn't anything unusual. They mostly added the titles only after the lyrics were finished.
a quick brush of Dean's lips to cause his heart to almost burst.
"No," Dean smiled, "but I want to, and honestly, my wallet won't even notice. So, just say yes and don't feel too bad about it. Consider it an apology for the paparazzi incident"
Cas's job would be, as Garth explained, to help him with the reviewing and improving of the texts. Cas was openly insecure about how that would work and he told him he had no experience at all, but Garth calmed him with the advice, similar to what Dean had said, to just trust his gut and go with what sounded good.
"Oh no the poor little angel!" Jo exclaimed. "She was all fine yesterday"
"Yes, Daddy," Claire said, and Cas quickly kissed her head before he stood back up and turned to Dean with a smile.
"Probably, yeah," Cas chuckled.
We were walking through the nightly village on our way back to the school, and only after a few steps outside the bar, Dean linked arms with me. We usually never did anything like that, even though it could have still been platonic. Even right now, it could have been just two platonic friends supporting each other after having maybe a bit too many drinks at the bar together. But we usually never did, just to be safe.
"Daddy my ice cream," she said.
"That's it," he said to Jo, "Your favourite one, right?"
Walking through the lobby, they both put on the friendliest smile possible for the receptionist, and then they stood there in awkward silence again, staring at closed metal doors, waiting for the elevator to finally arrive and hide them from everyone.
Dean shuddered at the cold feeling it gave him when Cas dripped some more lube on his hole.
Cas didn't buy that and in his immediate response he asked "really?", to which Dean confirmed with a chuckle that yes, he really thought that, he liked the things that Cas had changed and there were some parts that did sound a lot better now than when he had initially thought about.
"Okay," she said. "Bye Dean! You're funny!"
"Now Dean," the moderator said, "as we're talking personal, I know that is a very personal question to ask, but there have been rumours recently, and many of your fans are dying to know: Who is the man you have repeatedly been seen with?"
Then, finally, a couple hours later, they were back in Dean's car. As soon as both doors had closed, an awkward silence fell over them. Inside, them not talking hadn't been so strikingly quiet, since there had been lots of other noise around, but now, in the quiet privacy of the car, it became almost crushing.
"No," Jo said quietly, "you're right. I've never been through that. I can't tell you what is okay to feel and what isn't. I just ... what I wanted to say is, without invalidating anything you feel, that you've definitely got the moral high, and you're successful, Cas, you're there with
"Oh come on," Cas groaned, now slightly offended, "Do you think I'd let anyone in my pants just for a job? Do you really think that?"
Dean looked up. He saw himself in the mirror, a familiar face, and over his shoulder one that was even more familiar. Cas was standing right behind him, and as his deep blue eyes met Dean’s in the mirror, there was something in them, there was that honesty, that soft truth, and for just a second, he felt … yes, what? Ease, maybe. Like there wasn’t that weight pressing on his mind, holding him back. That fear, that constant fear of judgement.
"Mh?" Cas made, surprised by that start to the conversation.
you’re the best that ever happened
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"What's that?" Dean asked.
"Yeah," Dean confirmed, "Well, our parents knew each other. Weird sort of relationship. But we've been friends since I was in middle school"
She was sitting in her office chair, leaned back and her feet on the desk, Netflix on the computer, and a sleeping Claire in her lap.
"Huh?" He made. What had she told Dean?
"No," Cas replied with a soft smile. And he meant it. A couple days ago, that would have probably scared him. But right now, it just felt good. He was okay with it. It felt right.
"Mr. Winchester!" She said with the most intense talking-to-a-customer-smile Cas had ever seen, "Welcome back! We didn't expect you until tomorrow, though"
"Oh god you should see your faces right now," Dean laughed. "So, Cas here is on the one hand our badly needed support on the lyrics issues, but at the same time he's gonna help me out with the PR fiasco we talked about"
“I’m sorry I let you down, Dean…” Castiel whispered softly, his face buried in Dean’s shoulder.
“Nothing any of us want, I can guarantee that. Stop,
However, Dean's face shut down and he looked at him blankly, his only tell the slight squinting of his eyes. “Well, Daddy Cas isn’t here is he to assist, now is he?”
Instead of fear, Delaney's face flashed with annoyance and disbelief. “An
Claire rolled her eyes as she huffed. “Well, that’s convenient for
. Dean watched with slightly unfocused eyes as Cas arched his back off the seat to get the belt undone, and the sound of the zipper sliding down made Dean’s mouth fill with saliva like he was one of Pavlov’s dogs. He thought Cas might have just sent a teasing video but one glance and the length of the video said otherwise. He leaned back in the seat and cradled his phone in his hands as he watched with bated breath as Cas shoved down his underwear with both thumbs and tucked it under his balls before slowly stroking over his length, going from half chub to erect like a magic trick. Dean squirmed in his seat as he chubbed up inside the cock cage, grateful it wasn’t nighttime yet. The temptation might have broken him. Dean turned the volume up, his muscles tensing at the sound of skin on skin as Cas stroked himself and he strained, feeling his cheeks flush at the small huffs of breath he could hear Cas letting out. He zoned in, lost in the sound and sight of Cas beating off in his vehicle, not even realizing his own hand was pressing down onto his crotch, giving him some greatly wanted friction. He was dizzy with want already but when Cas began moaning his name as his hand sped up, Dean buckled over and groaned in newfound desperation.
“You are so good for me. My good boy,” Cas purred praise in his ear any time Dean faded back into wakefulness, enough that Dean almost whimpered in embarrassment, squirming against him and hiding his face. The last time he woke from his drifting slumber, his eyes were still closed when Cas leaned in. “You are also a good
“So…. Lizzie bit her lip and looked to the three of them. “Do you think if I figure out somewhere to keep my sister safe and away from hunting…maybe I could hunt with you guys sometimes? You guys have batshit crazy lives…and I’m not one to fangirl over hunter stories…but come on, I’m only human here.”
by one. You’ve harbored one within you.”
“I’m flattered, but no thank you,” Cas said kindly but firmly as he took her hand off his leg without timidness. “I’ve already got plans for this evening and I think they’d be rather upset with me if I took you up on your very generous offer…though I hear Dean there is good for more than a couple of good hours if you can talk him into it,” Cas smirked before taking another swig of his beer and grinning only for Dean to see.
of it torturing you.”
kind. The look of pity and concern he’d see on his face was too much for Dean to stomach. This…this was nothing. He’d held an archangel at bay inside his mind. He’d taken on an ancient curse. He’d been a damn demon. A couple of voices weren't going to take him down.
“We didn’t…that’s
“Me too,” Dean sighed out, letting out a soft whimper as Cas turned his head to kiss him with a tenderness that made him ache. Dean had made a mistake. This wasn’t part of their game. This softness, this tenderness, it was just them. They’d both become ridiculous saps. A few tender touches and Dean Winchester, the deadliest hunter, was putty in Cas’ hands. “Faster,” Dean gasped out as he parted their kiss for a breath. Cas nodded against his cheek and began popping his hips in a faster rhythm, his breaths ragged in Dean's ear. It was going to be agony not letting Cas jack him off as he finished, but Dean did still earn a reward, and they didn’t often get the opportunity to be alone uninterrupted. He was going to take full advantage of both events. He decided he wanted something else…to see
“I like…” Dean started, straining as Cas’ dick rubbed against his prostate now, stroking over it and making him lose his focus. “I, uh…Oh fuck,” Dean groaned in desperation before composing himself. “I like being good for you.” Cas threw his head back, letting out a ragged breath at Dean's confession. Dean wasn’t one for words during sex. Too many feelings slipped out but Cas was one to slip praise in when he thought Dean was most receptive to hearing it…times like now. It was an effective strategy and Dean wanted to try it… “I like that I make you lose…” He whined as Cas lifted his legs so that his feet were flat on the bed and he could fuck up into him with more leverage. “…lose that fucking self-control you have…and I love that you’re so fucking good to me. I like being treated good,” Dean huffed out the last on a strangled breath. He leaned down as far as he could while still riding him. “and you’re
“No Doubt.” Benny said as he started walking in the direction of the rift.
Benny stood.
"Two, I am not going there a third time God is defused."
After Benny came out of his memories, he could feel something was wrong. Like the very air around him was wrong. With his weapon in hand, he started walking, needing to find the source of his unease.
“Awe does that mean we are friends now?”
He laughed as Dean slipped behind Baby’s steering wheel.
They also noticed that some of the people working on the place were Hunters. some young but most of them older and looking lucky to be alive. All of them stopping to give a nod or handshake to the Winchesters' and the Angel.
“As soon as she tells me when, Sir.”
“Cas says stop being an AssButt!”
Flashback:
“I understand.” the Golem said.
That was when Aaron threw back both shots and whispered.
It was Aaron that spoke. “Big John will take you to it. He will make sure you are not disturbed. Take all the time you need.”
The Golem raised an eyebrow and spoke.
Dean swallowed hard. “Cas I, I can’t do that...Michael.” was all he could get out.
Chapter 8
“After that it won’t matter.” Dean said over his shoulder heading back downstairs.
“Ok Dean” Benny said. “What are you here for this time. I will help you get it, and you can leave.” He finished.
Dean swallowed the lump in his throat “Why didn’t you tell me you needed help up here instead of letting me brush you off?”
They could hear talking downstairs.
“Get some men and get that cement lid off of Benny. We will be coming in Hot.”
Yep, Benny knew, and he hoped they finally pulled their perspective heads out of their asses.
“Wait, you were alive then?” Dean asked.
Liz cut in “He deserved that much after saving my life and what he did for you.”
After the noise settled down and Dean's brain was functioning again, and his eye were back in his head he looked at Liz like she grew a second head, it was all mouth with pointy teeth. All he could do was shake his head at her. When words finally came, they were not addressed to her. "EVERYONE GET OUT" he yelled. And just like that, tools dropped, power tools went quiet, and feet Ran out the door.
It was not long before he found a werewolf hiding the bushes. Pulling it out and pinning it to a tree.
“Taking him to the Angel as I was instructed.”
“Why should I do anything YOU want me to do?” the Leviathan sneered.
When Dean stepped outside, he was in front of a construction trailer (he had seen enough of them while he was with Lisa and Ben). Once the others had joined them Liz took them inside. The trailer was set up as a blood donor center. There were already coolers filled with different blood types from –A, B, AB, and O. Dean was amazed. He looked at Liz and Aaron for an explanation. Aaron finally said. “This is all Liz’s doing and I have to agree with her reasoning, or she won’t Marry me. They heard a grunt from Big John and when they looked at him there was a grin (if you could call it that) on his face. Liz continued. "All of this was donated by Hunters.”  She waited a moment in case there were questions. That is when Sam piped up. “Dean there are Hunters and Vamps out there working...Together to apparently make this place work.”
Cas walked up to Liz and extended his hand.
Chapter 2
“You and Angel boy come visit so I can laugh some more.”
Stepping up to Castiel she looked at him a knowing glint in her eyes. "I do hope you are taking care of De...Um these boys here." she said. Cas step forward extending his hand and said, "As much as they will let me."  As she took his hand in hers, she could see the moment he knew but was unable to stop his next words. "Congratulations on your pregnancy."
Benny just nodded his head yes.
He was still laughing when Baby’s taillights disappeared in a cloud of dust.
With a smile on her face, she handed out shots of whiskey. Aaron held what was supposed to be her shot.
“Well, what do you say. Are you coming home or what?”
Chapter 10
As it dropped to the ground Dean looked up to see Benny standing several feet away from him, weapon raised.
Aaron started. “When Liz bought the Plantation and the property that went with it the first thing, she did was have Benny dug up and placed in the Lafitte Crypt.”
Dean and Sam both shook the golem's hand wincing from the strength its hand.
They all piled into a truck (Big John in the truck bed) and the Impala. When they started driving following Aaron and Liz Dean turn to Sam and Cas “She is crazy, right? Her plan can never work out.” He was looking for support, but they were silent. He shook his head looking back at the car in front of them.
“Liz wants you back there. She has a good set up waiting for you. Thanks to Hunters who know how you helped me get out of this place she was able to buy the diner and the old Lafitte plantation.”
Days, Weeks, Months, Years. He was not sure how much time has passed since his return to Purgatory. All he knew was that it was pure, and he was good at surviving in this place.
The three of them walked up the steps to what used to be Guidry's Gumbo Shack. Dean and Sam both noticed the face lift the exterior received. Some of the outside walls had been replaced due to age, but were left unpainted so that eventually it would weather like the rest of the old building and blending in. But the most notable change was the name on the outside.
“Now you take them to find that blossom they need and then make sure they get back to that rift. And if they ask about me, I AM DEAD. Got it?”
“Wait, What? Twins” Aaron sputtered out.
Before Dean went thru Benny heard him whisper
“I ran to draw them away from you.”
Once the Grace started flowing from Cas’ body it entered thru Dean's mouth. Dean struggled against it at first his mind going back to when Michael had possessed him. After a moment he heard Cas in his head.
“No, he will not. It will be me who sends you back. I will not let Dean send you back a second time. The first time nearly broke him.”
Dean just grinned in answer.
“Dean please relax remember Michael is dead. You beat him.”
Benny thought for a moment and then with a glint in his eyes he asked Dean.
"Three Benny died, Sam said he saw him die and when I was there the second time the Leviathan, we captured said Benny was DEAD."  His voice raising on the last word.
“They are looking for a Leviathan blossom, something about killing God with it.” the Monster choked out.
“Let me bottom line it for you, I’m not leaving without you.”
When they reached the room, Cas was still laying on the bed. Big John put Dean's limp body beside Cas’ and stepped back.
It was Castiel who spoke. “I will not let you go alone Dean.”
“Where is the crypt?” Dean asked quietly. It was not that he did not believe her, he just needed to make sure it was done properly, that Benny was not salted and burned.
Dean’s one thought, ‘Holy Shit, he’s alive.’
Benny
“What are you doing?” Sam asked.
Noone questioned Dean at all about his revelation. the only question was who was going with him? Elizabeth was out of the question with a firm “Not in your condition.”
After that is when Benny saw the Leviathan trailing them. He snuck around and just before it attacked Benny had him in a headlock from behind.
“Nothing escapes your Angel, does it?”
The leviathan was in fact caught by Dean and Cas. And told them exactly what Benny told him to. And When Dean asked about Benny you could see Dean's sorrow on his face when the thing said Benny died fighting. He led them to the blossoms, but they were inside An Angel trap. Dean was knocked unconscious and Castiel taken prisoner.
Dean more fell into the rift than ran. When he landed it was on the floor of the manor house. He tried to relax so Cas could leave Dean’s body. Apparently, Cas’ Grace and Benny’s soul were at odds with each other. Dean was convulsing when Cas’ Grace finally departed Dean’s body and floated upstairs to his vessel.
Liz looked at Dean there were tears in her eyes as she said, “I wanted him to have his home." She let her tears fall “I want him home if he is still alive in Purgatory.” and she continued “If he is dead at least he can rest here on his Family Home where it will be peaceful for him.”
Dean started spouting orders. “Sam get the ingredients ready. We should have just enough of Lucifer’s Grace left to pull this off.
The residents of Purgatory had quit hunting him. They figured it was safer that way, why take the chance of dying, again.
He was a legend in Purgatory.
“Cas said that was Blackmail.” Dean said.
Sam arched his eyebrows up and said, "So Do you have a real name now?'
Chapter 9
“What the hell is going on? Why are you and most every other thing in this place hiding?” Benny growled out.
“How long we been out?” Dean asked.
Dean would not leave him though.
“Cas wants to know if it was you that took out his captors and left the blossom and knife for him.”
Before Benny walked away to fight the three Vamps coming their way Sam handed him Dean’s weapon. That weapon and the Vampire that wielded it were legends. No monster came after him unless they had a death wish, which was really a moot point because to wind up in Purgatory you, as a monster had to die.
“Yea, laugh it up Benny.” Dean groused.
“Thank you both so much for bringing him home.”
Benny took a moment to take in what Castiel had said and started laughing.
Aaron took another shot off the tray and downed it.
Benny grinned. “Well, that remark right there helped. Only Dean Winchester would give Purgatory a nickname. But, still not enough to convince me.”
The day they finally found the Angel Benny knew, there was a Profound Bond between the two. He knew it was more for the Angel when he said.
Benny met Dean shortly after he arrived in Purgatory. He had fashioned the weapon that he himself carried now. Benny discovered that Dean was on a mission to find the Angel other Monsters were talking about. Occasionally, he would hear about a mass smiting of Purgatory's’ residence. It was not often because that much power drew Leviathan like a beacon. But it would also draw Dean.
“Golem, Big John, you protect his vessel with your life.” Dean said.
They both just smiled down at her glad that she was happy with her Family being together.
Cas woke first. He did what he always does. He watched over Dean as he slept. When Dean started to awaken Cas turn away from him. He knew Dean thought that was just creepy. Cas never tired of looking at Dean.
"One, no you are not going there. Not in your condition."
After a moment or two Dean asked.
“What?” Benny asked.
“YOU DUG HIM UP.” Dean was livid. “HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?”
Big John was also a No. The rift they created may let him in but, the gate on the other side may not spit him back out.
Benny let go shock on his face. “Shit the Angel is riding you, isn’t he?
“Yes Benny. Her exact words to me were ‘Don’t come back without him or I will go in there and drag him out myself.’ Dean quoted with a smile.
“Why are you here Dean? I know last time you were looking for a Leviathan blossom. But why are you here now.”
Dean just stood there unable to answer, still in shock. It was Sam who spoke next.
It was on a day were he just wanted to kill something that he saw them. Dean and the Angel looking for all the world like they were taking a leisurely walk thru Purgatory. What he heard was something akin to a lovers spat but he could not be sure.
“What, ok YOU watch for monsters, or whatever just do it quietly.”
Benny grinned.
Dean was quiet. Like he was thinking and then he said. “Castiel. And for the record he said you would be dead before you could raise your weapon to me.” he finished with a smile.
“Yea So?” Dean said (he might have let Hunters know what happened so they would Look after Lizabeth).
Once in the Door they were greeted by Aaron Bass. He had become a well-established Hunter in the years following his grandfather's death. The Golem was beside Aaron in just an instant and upon recognizing the Winchesters extended his hand out to shake theirs.
“You heard the Question. Who do you Love? And do not lie because I have known since the first time you were in this hellhole. And I will drop you right here if the answer is wrong. So, answer the question. Who. Do. You. Love.”
“YOU.”
Benny was laughing so hard Dean thought he had to be hurting.
Dean grinned.
Sam had safely stored Bobby’s soul inside himself and was going to store Benny’s soul for the ride back topside when Benny just looked at Sam and spoke.
“Just a little,” Dean answered honestly, ducking his face into Cas’ shoulder. “You know it’s hard for me.”
Dean gave Cas a confused look over her shoulder and he shrugged before his mouth tugged up in a friendly smile. “Speaking of siblings, you should go talk to Dean’s brother Sam. He’s a big reader. I’m sure he’s probably done some reading on auras. He enjoys research.”
Lizzie's smile was genuine and friendly as she spoke. “I had a lot of fun swapping lore and stories with you last night, Sam. So many of these hunters don’t see the beauty in the stories and legends, and they think I’m nuts for my interests. It's refreshing to have someone appreciate them. If the other hunters knew I even dabbled in…” She lowered her voice and leaned in, “magic…they’d probably try to hunt me too.” She studied Sam’s face cautiously as if trying to gauge his reaction as she spoke. Her face was turned up toward Sam's but behind the caution was a glint of defiance, like she was prepared for his disapproval already.
“I mean, how could we with a little kid with us?” Claire asked reasonably.
Dean’s hand stilled. “Burns…from the pit.”
She propped her sister up more securely against the wall and then immediately stood rigid, staring at the three of them. “I’ve got questions.”
Cas got still and smiled with a soft, knowing smile as he leaned in and whispered in his ear. “I can have sex with you anywhere I
Dean couldn’t find Cas, which wasn’t like him. Since they had become…whatever the hell they were now…neither seemed to want to let the other out of their sight for long. Perhaps years of losing one another had led to a need to be in one another’s radius…but Dean had patiently packed his own duffle and laid Cas’ out beside his own on the bed…but no Cas appeared. He went searching through the winding corridors of the bunker until he heard a familiar sound and knew where to find him.
Dean stopped, his face hard and his mouth opened and closed once without a word before he put a hand on each of Cas’ shoulders. “I don’t want any of them.” He shook his head as he forced eye contact with Cas. Cas looked down at the ground and kicked the dirt with the toe of his shoe, refusing to lock eyes with him.  “Cas…come on. What’s actually wrong?” Castiel sighed and looked at him, shaking his head softly. “You’re jealous, aren’t you? You’ve never had to be before because no one at home wants to talk to me anymore and we don’t go out much,” Dean started laughing and Cas glared like the avenging Angel he’d once been. “You’re jealous and YOU’RE the one flirting with a pretty girl right in front of me.”
combine. They have the unique marker of the one they were created to inhabit, even if Grace itself is all from the same original source of celestial energy.”
“Worth it,” Dean said with a happy growl as he pulled away and slipped his shirt over his head. Cas caught it before it could hit the floor and left it at the end of the bed as he began wrestling with his belt.
“Let’s say I did ask her out and it got serious…What then?” Sam said with growing frustration at their meddling.  “Here, let me take you back to the secret underground bunker I live in with my brother and his boyfriend who have EXTREMELY loud sex at all hours of the night? Oh, and one of them used to be an Angel. Yeah, I see her really going for that.”
today.
The smile stretched to devious, frightening proportions, morphing Dean's face into a monstrous parody. “Oh, he prays, whether he calls them prayers or not. Because he needs help, not because he
“I told you, Dean,” Sam jabbed back. “He was supposed to tell you about this before we came.”
Jack sipped on his drink, sulking. “When do I get to drink beer? Dean lets me at the bunker…” He said as he dropped his voice.
“Not necessarily,” Cas murmured softly as he traced Dean’s stomach with the tips of his fingers as he took the water bottle from his hand. “There are other ways to orgasm, as you well know. Now, put your arms above your head and hold your wrists.”
in the Empty, like last time? Is that why we're hearing him?”
Dean had no idea what Cas was talking about but he took a calming breath and listened, as distracted as he was by Cas’ weight on him. In the distance, he heard the soft rumble of thunder. “Storm?”
pay. Did you know your little connection to Dean, that
“I bet he would show me his wings. I mean, honestly, he’d show me everything he’s
Lizzie hedged awkwardly at Dean's inquiry. “Uh, well, I already told Sam all of his…but I’d be happy to read one of you. I never did get to tell you about your aura, Dean…if you wanted.”
“Beautiful” He whispered
“Not a portal, a rift. They came in through a rift. It will close in a few hours. Some of us are hunting them to get a ride out. The rift is warded so we die if we attempt to enter it without a ride out.” The thing said.
Benny released the werewolf but before he could run his head was removed from his shoulders and Benny went in search of Dean Winchester.
“Benny, I am not the WIFE in this relationship Dean Is.”
“Kinda precise there aren’t Ya Cas.” Dean quipped.
When Dean had calmed himself, Cas motioned for the others to come forward.
Dean went silent, Cas stepped up to him "Dean are you alright?" Cas whispered.
Work suddenly stopped and whispers started. Most hunters knew of the Angel but, it was rare to see him out with the Winchesters. But these days they did not let Cas out of their sight. He was wanted by every monster out there. It was not anyone's business as to why he was always around and that was all that was said.
“So, what will it be. Home or this place.”
IT nodded again.
Benny was shaking his head no, but Dean went on talking.
Dean understood. Things were not always what they seemed in this place. So instead he asked “What will convince you that I am Dean Winchester and not something from this Funhouse?”
Once in the crypt Big John held Dean's arm over Benny's bones and cut with the Angel Blade.
Benny stared into what were now the Angels eyes.
His hand touches her stomach with a soft glow. When he pulled it away, he said with a smile.
Aaron shook his head with a smirk on his face and said, "We were listening to some really old Ballads and Big Bad John Caught his attention."
That left Sam or Cas. To Dean they were both a hard no. It looked like Dean was going alone.
“Explain.” was all Dean said.
“When I touched the cement cover it vibrated. He Is Alive.” Dean said.
Benny sat there for a moment in shock and then threw back the whiskey shot and swallowed.
“Noone goes in that room for the next twenty-four hours.”
“Rest in peace my friend.”
He touched the cement cover protecting the casket Dean could almost feel it vibrating causing him to jerk his hand away.
There were tears shining in Benny’s eyes when he asked.
“I think I just said that.” Castiel said.
“He has a duffle full of weapons but instead of using them he is smiting our kind.” The monster finished.
“Dean Winchester and apparently he is looking for you.”
After a day or two of relaxing at the manor house the Winchester and Castiel prepared to leave. The bags were in Baby’s trunk, and everyone was on the veranda Saying their goodbyes.
Chapter 4
Big John stood watch outside the crypt while Dean went inside.
“Dean” She paused for only a moment “When he was here, when we were working together, I kept thinking I knew him from somewhere, but I couldn’t figure out where from. It took me months to remember only because Hunters were coming right and left it was hard to keep up with them.”
And so, Benny lived in purgatory in relative peace. But when Benny got bored, he hunted them. Some days just taking out one monster was enough other days it had to be dozens and that is when they would hide from him.
“Answer my Questions and I might let you live.” Benny growled low enough for ‘IT’ to hear him but not Dean or the Angel (though he wondered about the Angel because, well Angel).
Benny did just as he was told as Dean let Castiel power up for a mass smiting. When Dean came back to himself, he cut his forearm and chanted the Latin that pulled Benny’s soul into him.
Dean’s mouth was agape.
It was then that Elizabeth (or Liz as Dean had known her) came walking up to Dean and wrapped her arms around him. He hugged her back with equal heart felt emotion. She then turned to Sam with a smile and said "You must be Sam" stepping forward and hugging him. "We didn't meet when you were in town last time. Dean said you had to leave on and important errand."
And the Angel nodded in defeat.
“I am not Michael; I will not stay inside against your will. This I WILL promise you.”
Hey Cas. Good to see you.” Dean yawned out.
The End
“I am trying to keep a look out for monsters, and I can't do that while you are distracting me.”
Dean yelled as he came to a sudden stop in front of the group. They were all shocked.
Dean looked at Aaron, still holding Cas close to himself.
When Dean brought the Angel blade up to make the incision his hands were shaking. Cas had to wrap his hands around Deans to help him.
Chapter 1
“You two sound like an old married couple.”
The diner was set to re-open in a week and Benny was testing all his old recipes.
They all watched in amazement as Dean quit convulsing and Benny’s Body started to reform.
“I am.”
Cas took his Angel Blade from his trench coat and laid on the bed and spoke.
Dean looked Benny in the eye.
“What choice do we have?” Dean shot back at him, regretting his tone immediately.
It was then that Liz said "Let everyone come back in to work and I will show you what I Have set up. I think you will like it."
“I will Smite that Cajun.”
As they walked down the step to get into Baby Castiel turned to Benny and spoke.
"Dean, I said three Vamps took Benny down. I didn't see him die and you know that the Leviathans would not tell the truth especially to you."
“What will convince you?” Dean questioned warily.
Everyone was laughing. Aaron was  leaning on the Golem for support.
“And after that?” big John Asked.
“I’ll be watching you. Do not make me hunt you down.”
“What, What about the Anti-Possession symbol. Should I scar it?” Dean stalled with that question.
“Yeah,” I smiled at him, “I’d love to”
Cas left about 15 minutes after Dean, like he always did. He dropped Claire off at school, wished her a nice day, and then he was off to work as well.
was still on there, and Dean had commented on the bottom of the same post-it as well.
Dean was like a fine painting, Cas liked to think. He was so aesthetically pretty to look at, he was like the masterpiece of a hard-working artist, every freckle on his face the result of the well-thought-through tap of a brush, the shape of his face carefully drawn on canvas, every single hair added with a careful movement of hand, and his eyes, his mesmerizing green eyes, the result of long hours of work, with every little variation of colour being carefully thought of and added, colours mixed with the tip of a fine brush, making those eyes as deep and beautiful as they were.
"Good," Cas grinned and leaned over to grab the box.
Dean chuckled.
the big elephant in the room?
Dean opened the box, revealing a plain, simple ring. It was simple, yes, but it was pretty. It was grey, a darker grey, with a thin green line going all around it right in the middle.
he had called me. Obviously a shortened version of my name, but it made me wonder where he might have picked that up – or did he make it up himself? No one had ever nicknamed me. All my life, it had always been
"Yeah," Dean only said with a soft smile at Cas, "Yeah, it is"
"Yeah," Cas said.
I immediately grabbed Dean’s shoulders and pushed him away, forced him off of me. He stood there, visibly irritated as I pushed him aside and ran out of the alley, onto the main street – that was now empty.
“Get up,” Cas said. “You may not have a family Christmas tradition to remember, but just because your father was a bitter alcoholic don’t mean that we can’t make our own tradition. As a family. You and me. You know.”
If anyone would have told me that back in October, I wouldn’t have believed a word of it. And yet, here I was, holding Dean’s hand while on a romantic walk around the snow-covered fields after kissing him for the very first time.
And right as he had answered, Dean had already leaned in even closer and pressed a first quick kiss on his cheek.
“No,” he chuckled. “No, I’m not. I’m from Kansas.”
"She said we can use the back door," Dean said. "In case there's still someone waiting outside. If you wanna."
"Great," Dean smiled and nodded towards Charlie, who noted something down on one of her papers. "Then, details. Now this of course has no legal validity, but we've prepared a list of things that I can ask you to do and things that I absolutely can't. I'd like to go through that with you, maybe twitch it, depending on your comfort zone, maybe adding something that's important to you."
“Well that isn’t exactly new either,” he said with a little smirk.
"That's exactly what I'm saying," Dean smirked. "Keep my thousand-dollar suit. That you've put in a nice supermarket plastic bag, by the way"
Cas spent some time looking out the window in silence, his eyes following the buildings they were passing.
Cas shook his head and absentmindedly closed the browser.
, or at least that was what he kept telling himself. And why would he? He was Dean Winchester, who could have pretty much anyone he wanted, why on earth would he ever only look at a boring normal guy like Cas?
"No," Cas said. "We haven't mentioned it again. We didn't even ... not even right after it happened. It was really awkward for a moment, then we went back inside and Dean got all closed up and didn't speak another word with me for the rest of the night. And I just ... I thought for hours ... I was worried that maybe I had done something wrong that upset him. But literally all that happened between a good conversation and him being grumpy was that kiss, and it was
"Thank you," he then said quietly.
"Right," Claire now understood, "because sometimes, men want a boyfriend, or women want a girlfriend"
"Uhm ..." Cas made, "Yeah. That, uhm ... that'd be great. I guess?"
"You're telling me to just keep your thousand-dollar suit because it looks good on me?"
Cas drifted off into his thoughts again various times throughout dinner, and he repeatedly zoned out from the conversation that Jo and Claire were having about the highlights of their cooking process and Claire's enthusiasm for cutting vegetables.
Cas had forgotten about her. Not about Claire, well not entirely. But totally about Jo, and especially about the two of them being right next door. They had been right next door the entire time, he realized. They had been right next door to Dean moaning his name, to Dean moaning all those things that definitely hadn't been supposed to ever reach Claire's ears, and Jo really shouldn't have heard any of that either.
I pulled back after just a second, after just that slight brush of lips. My face still only a few centimeters away from his I opened my eyes again, meeting Dean’s with a nervous, insecure look.
"I..." Cas shrugged, "It's not that easy. Do I want it? I mean I want him, yeah. But I can only have him with all the attention that comes with him, and I don't know if I can handle that"
Maybe, Cas thought, maybe he could just mention that he saw people pointing this out, and leave it to Dean to carry on the conversation.
Dean rolled his eyes at that, but didn't argue.
"You're familiar with the building, then?" Cas asked with a nod to the wedge.
(See the end of the chapter for
I hadn’t told him about my sexuality, I hadn’t told anyone. But I still knew that if I had told him, he would have been fine with it. I always remembered that one time he had said to me, after people had been arrested at a gay bar and their names had been published in every newspaper in the area, causing them to lose their jobs and ruining their entire existence, he had said to me, “It’s unfair. Those people are doing nothing wrong, it’s just who they are. It’s who God intended them to be, and everyone should accept God’s choices, don’t you think, Castiel?”
"I'll call," he said.
“That doesn’t automatically make you a man,” Cas said.
Sure, there were all my work notes in it. But what was even more important: There was that one page in the back of it where I had written about Dean.
“Yeah,” Dean shrugged, “Yeah, of course”
"I, uhm ..." he started, "well I've wanted to ask you for a while now, but I ... I didn't know how to do it. I just ... I knew you wouldn't like one of those big proposal things, you know, so I decided to just wait for the right moment. Just ... you know, when it's just us, all private and quiet and ...
you’re the best that ever happened
The woman stepped inside the kitchen and picked the little girl up with a laugh.
There was a single piece of paper sitting on his desk, and it had a green post-it note attached to it. Coming closer, Cas recognized Dean's handwriting on both the paper and the post-it note.
"Yeah," Jo said. "I'm gonna ..." she pointed to the door, "you know, my own bed waits"
Cas heard a sigh through the line, and he knew Dean wasn't happy with that answer. It was silent for just a second, then: "Charlie is gonna pick you up"
"What you said," he hesitantly started asking a question, "on the phone, earlier. About the negative articles, and that jilted ex making comments … what’s it with that?"
Chewing on his pen, Cas read through the few lines Dean had scribbled down.
"Sure," Dean replied with a smile.
Dean made a short pause.
Dean chuckled as he followed Cas's eyeline to the two girls that were still whispering and trying to steal inconspicuous looks.
But the kiss, a little voice in his head tried to argue again and again, what was that about? It doesn't matter, he always silenced it, he doesn't like me back.
"What?" He asked with a smirk.
"A couple months, maybe," Dean said. "You didn't know that?"
"Sure," she smiled.
"Mh," Dean smirked, "she's a fan. I told you"
With his teeth nervously biting his tongue, Castiel decides to just give it a shot. A risky shot, admittedly. But a shot.
you take my breath away
Jo let herself in when Cas was in the kitchen with Claire at the table, colouring another picture in her colouring book. As usual, his best friend went to greet his daughter first, and Cas watched from the side how Claire excitedly jumped into a hug.
They had talked about it, they had had multiple long and intensive talks, and in the end, they had agreed on something.
“Evil sonofabitch,” Dean grumbled with a pretended pout as he slid his hand under the cover. This was going to take more willpower than he was sure he had.
Dean shrugged in silent agreement as he sagged tiredly against the wall of the stairwell. “What’s a little Heavenly wrath compared to that?”
. Of course you're parent material. You helped raise him once already!”
“He’s probably got residual memories of it, Dean. He was there for a while…”
Lizzie looked down at her sister, clenched her hands into fists then looked up at him. “Do it…Please…It’s that or she hurts someone else, and I don’t know if I could kill her if it came to that.”
“Dean, I told you…” Sam smiled smugly as he shrugged, patting Jack's back comfortingly as he started to squirm awake.
“You…” She said as she grabbed the wall to stand up. “You’re an
Cas had a way of saying his name during sex that felt like a combination of prayer and an obscenity mingled into one amazing sound…and Cas knew how Dean felt about it. Devious bastard. Dean mirrored Cas’ moans, however, his were hollow with want. He bucked into the flat of his palm before he realized what he was doing and he curled it into a fist and drug it onto his thigh, the small of his back and his palms sweating as the torture continued. Cas was talking now, murmuring about how much he missed his good boy, things he wanted to do to him, praise to his body.…and Dean endured it all with gritted teeth as if in physical pain, yearning to touch the skin Cas was flaunting over video. He finally watched Cas use his free hand to pull his shirt up, revealing his muscular chest and stomach, the flesh Dean most liked to pepper with soft kisses. Dean watched his rhythm falter and he watched in rapt fascination as Cas came, streaking across his stomach and moaning his name as he did so. He gripped the steering wheel like a lifeline, not hearing his own breathing matching Cas’ ragged ones before resting his head on the steering wheel as he watched Cas’ hand reach for the phone and turn off the recording. Suddenly he found himself in the deafening silence of the car breathing as if he’d just been running for his life, white-knuckling the steering wheel as his dick tried desperately to grow bigger than the cock cage would allow. He tried for calming breaths as his face stayed flushed and sweat beaded on his neck. As he stared at the text screen, now looking innocently up at him, a text popped up under the video.
Truly puzzled now, Sam looked back at her again. “What does Eileen have to do with Cas?”
“Um, sexy dreams…with you. Always in different places and you always left me hanging, you bastard. You know I’ve been kinda strung out and horny, though. Dreams like that are normal,” Dean added defensively.
However, Claire's reaction was not what Sam expected. “You gave him Cas’ room? That’s a little abrupt huh?” Dean bit back a small smile of validation, having asked Sam the same thing.
“Oh, you’ve heard of that one, eh?” Delaney grinned up at him, her eyes alight with mischief instead of the fear that would have been more expected. “What witch did you have a run-in with before me, Angel?” Her eyes were heated as she stared at him, lover-like.
Castiel shrugged nonchalantly. “She is very attractive.. I can’t argue with facts, nor do I feel threatened by her as she showed no interest in Dean.”
They pulled up in the driveway of Jody’s house, Jack had fallen asleep an hour ago after they’d stopped for lunch and a bathroom break. While Dean headed to the front door, stretching his arms out and cracking his knuckles, Sam went to the back seat and slung Jack’s bag over one shoulder before unbuckling the sleeping toddler and gently holding him against him, letting his head rest on his shoulder.
“Dean…” Sam frowned as Jack looked up at them, his pencil motionless on the paper. “I know you’re angry but this is the hand we’ve been dealt and we gotta deal with it, okay?”
offense but you know how long it took you to accept your feelings for me because of what I am. You can’t blame me for being hesitant to point out those same differences that made this so hard for you in the first place.”
you to be gentle, Dean. Fuck me the way you
“Now we get each other’s dicks up our asses. That’s an upgrade.” Dean’s joke made Cas laugh out loud, a happy, warm sound that made Dean’s heart simultaneously ache with joy and his continued absence. “Come home soon.”
Dean had the grace to look a bit like he'd been caught red handed, but he quickly played it off with a toothy grin. “Hook up? No. Find a wonderful, lasting relationship, maybe…” He said with a wink as he looked to Cas for backup, but when Cas simply shrugged in response, Dean huffed in pretended annoyance at him.
Castiel shook his head, immediately defensive of his child. “Jack…he’s powerless. It wasn’t him.”
tease him. And he did. He stroked over his prostate with practiced fingers and Cas gritted his teeth, letting a whimper escape his throat. Dean stroked himself with his other hand while he made Cas writhe on his fingers. Watching him tense his muscles and let out breathy gasps of pleasure was making him hungry for more.
“Did you rest well?” Cas asked softly and Dean felt fingers glide through his hair before he slowly opened them to find Cas watching him.
Dean coughed out a laugh. “What, you mean you don’t want to keep me in the bed all day?”
“Well, Cas planned to raise him for Kelly when he thought he’d be born a baby. Cas
Dean groaned and stretched, carding a hand through Cas’ mussed up hair. “And you said those things when you knew I would agree to anything you said. You’re an evil son of a bitch.”
…unsurprising to Dean.
Dean debated continuing his bratty attitude, but he'd pay for it in the long run, and he didn't want Cas to take it to heart. Teasing was allowed. Hurting him with his words was something he was trying very hard to grow out of as a person.
“Hopefully so. Goodnight Dean…I love you.” Cas said the last shyly, words they had said but were not confident in yet. This was still unsure territory over the phone.
“Silentium!” She hissed out and Dean was made speechless. He continued to try to jerk free then whirled to look at Sam in silent desperation.
“Yeah,” Dean croaked out, licking his lower lip as he locked eyes with him. “Yeah, I want that.”
for losing him any more than I do, kid.
Jody shot a look between them, getting ready to stand and break up the glaring match. “I thought…You told me he died saving
Dean walked into the room and leaned against the door frame, watching Cas chuck blade after blade down into the target, all hitting with deadly accuracy. He shook his head as he watched him. He might be human now, but he moved with such grace and skill that he’d swear he wasn’t human if he didn’t know different, oh but he knew. He pressed his palm over the vial of grace that hung from his neck as a habit. It was now just like checking that he had his wallet and keys, something he panicked if he didn’t know where it was in the rare moments he took it off. Cas sensed the movement and he looked over, sheathing the unthrown knives in his wrist sheaths as he walked over to the target to retrieve the others.
“Liar,” Dean whispered softly in his ear as they opened the door and were again assaulted by the noise. They hugged the wall to get to their table and there smiling at them was a familiar face.
Dean grinned to himself.
“How’d you end up with them? I’m sorry…I’m so rude. My name’s Nelson. I retired a few years ago from hunting.” he extended his hand and Cas shook it as he answered, getting a feel for Nelson’s warmth and friendliness in the shaking of his hand.
“Night night,” Jack murmured as he snuggled down and Dean tucked the comforter around him before exiting the room and leaving the door cracked.
“I don’t need it. Haven’t even-“ Dean began but Cas cut him off immediately.
“And you can’t be a snarky asshole with your head thrown back moaning my name like you do when I do that thing you like…” Cas groaned and threw his head back and stroked himself fast. “Yep. That thing. You know, when I take my tongue and I-“ Cas grunted and moaned his name, interrupting him. “Yeah, you
, Dean. I was talking to the person who barely said Cas’ name once in two days.”
Castiel lifted his shirt and the Enochian tattoo peeked out. Lizzie raised her eyebrows in question, but Cas let the shirt fall without answering it. “Still there but…”
. If that hadn’t happened…”
Sam helped Lizzie off the bed, and they watched Dean take a full assessment of Cas’ health, fussing over him. “So, a last heads up. We live in a secret underground bunker and those two have extremely loud sex at all hours.”
“Well, then just come sooner. Win-win.”
you,” Cas whispered in his ear and Dean shivered like he’d slid an ice cube down his naked spine. “Do you understand?” Dean nodded, their eyes locking as the heat rose to his face again. Fuck but he’d be the death of him.
Cas smiled more broadly as Dean lingered near his shoulder. “You’d be surprised what the group of us believe in compared to other hunters. Eventually you see enough, you just have to be open to believing anything is possible, and some things you must take on faith.”
Cas laughed deeply now, a pleased noise. “Would if I could, I promise you. But enough about me. How are you? Have you been doing what I asked?”
“You’re serious right now?” Dean rolled his eyes in frustration. “I’ve been fucked six ways to Sunday today by you and you actually think I’m gonna see your feathers and freak the fuck out?
“I wasn’t talking to
“Okay. Then it’s settled,” Dean said with a smile at Cas, but he stopped when he saw the thunder clouds in his eyes. Winning an argument was sometimes just not worth it. “I’ll book two rooms.”
my responsibility.” Dean turned and went to storm out as Sam called to him.
“You too,” Dean strangled out and the line went dead.
Jody put her hands on her knees, leaning forward as Claire snorted a laugh in the doorway. “You came here expecting me to take on a
“He doesn’t-“ Cas began.
Cas raised an eyebrow and gave her a sly half smile as he nodded. “It very much aligns with my life events, yes. Perhaps it’s best we do not delve further though…”
“One second…One for the road,” Castiel said as he laid a hand on her knee lightly and her scratches and scrapes from the fight were healed. She gasped as she felt his Grace knit her small wounds back together, never having felt the sensation before. He then went to Sam and laid a hand on his shoulder, doing the same. Lastly, he stepped to Dean and softly cupped his cheek, laying a soft kiss on his lips and letting his power heal the cut on Dean’s forehead from the glass…and a few other minor tweaks Dean wouldn’t miss…such as the soreness in the small of his back and the arterial buildup he’d been developing. His own little secret. Dean sighed into the almost chaste kiss, feeling the electricity of Cas’ kiss and having to remind himself there were others in the room.
“Oh, I told her I was coming here. I do try to check in and invite her but she’s just in one of her moods. She’s working on something and doesn’t want to be interrupted. Or so she says. She gets like this sometimes.” Lizzie stabbed at the ice in her glass as she spoke. “It gets lonely for sure.”
Cas nodded to Dean, pressing a palm to Dean's hand as he turned to Lizzie. “What would you have me do, Lizzie? She has proven that she is a danger to herself and others. Do you know what would have happened had she successfully absorbed Grace? She’d have burned away from the inside out, the Grace eating away at her until she died writhing in agony. Is that what you wish for her? Is that what you want? As for the plans she had for me…” His face hardened and his jaw flexed as he looked to Dean.
“This is what I want, Dean. I want to live a human life with you. My power is convenient, but it only brings us trouble in the end.” Cas stroked a thumb down Dean’s jaw. “You know this is true. I don’t need to be an Angel. I just need to be with you.”
“No. Nothing like that…” Dean hedged and Claire watched him steadily even as he shuffled and ran his fingers through his hair nervously. “But he said once we had a profound bond, after him rescuing me from Hell.”
Cas’ face got the familiar look of insecurity that Dean thought he’d chased away forever. The Angel absently scratched between his shoulder blades like talking about wings was causing him actual physical discomfort before sitting down and gesturing for Dean to follow suit. They sat together under the overhang, knees knocking against one another as Cas searched for the words he wanted.
Lizzie swallowed hard as she looked at Dean’s face. “I’m sure. I won’t let you down. If you want to sit on the other bed that might be the best place.”
The first dream took place in a backdrop Dean didn't recall but must have seen at some point for it to be locked in his brain...Maybe on tv? It was an ancient forest, with trees whose branches reached toward Heaven and seemed to go on forever. Their branches laced together to form a natural canopy of leaves, shading the forest floor below. He found himself walking slowly through the shade, his feet crunching the leaves that carpeted the ground below him...and he was barefoot. An odd choice for his dreams. He wore his jeans and a form-fitting, white long-sleeved Henley. Fewer layers than he typically wore but it was a dream after all. He padded through the forest, his fingertips tracing the rough bark of the ancient trees until he heard a sound behind him, something else disturbing the forest floor. He turned, the cool Autumn air crisp in his throat, and was pushed into one of the trunks by Cas. The tree was big enough that even Cas' strength didn't budge it as he shoved Dean's back into it, the bark biting into the thin shirt protecting his skin.
Cas stood, defiant with his hands in fists at his side. “I have a right to my concerns and insecurities, Dean, just as you do.”
“Not as easy as it looks is it?” Sam said with a grin after he swallowed his last glug of water, grinning at the two of them.
Dean groaned out wordlessly as Cas jacked him off, folding over on himself. He felt Cas come before he heard him moan his name in release, almost prayerful…and it pushed Dean over as well as they locked eyes, mouths agape. They had only a moment to recover, panting, before their phones dinged again. He caught his breath and rolled off, tangling his limbs with Cas’ and their fingers intermingled together in a quiet moment.
“You’re very nice when you aren’t being a jealous asshole,” Dean murmured in his ear, making him shudder as his hand snaked under his jacket. “You are soft in all the places that matter,” He pushed them closer to the back wall as he spoke now, making Cas walk backwards. “And you smell exactly like the cologne I bought you last week.” Dean kissed Cas’ neck and attempted to press him against the dark building. “I am not at all interested in anyone else in there.” Cas dodged his attempt and held his hand a moment before letting it go.
“One thing at a time, Cas…” Sam murmured as he sat on the bed next to her, looking at her increasingly pale face.
“We’ll
Dean's eyes widened. He really needed to learn to not type out every thought he had. Well, fuck, he was all in now.
Delaney refused to look over at him as she read over her notes, cradling the vial in her left hand as she traced through her words with her right pointer finger. “Let’s pretend you’re right. It’s masterless. My spell will make me its master. Witchcraft is so much more than your tiny minds can understand.”
As Castiel took in Lizzie's face, he cocked his head and smiled apologetically. “My apologies... I broke with Heaven to help Sam and Dean stop the Apocalypse. I’ve been banished to Earth ever since. That changes Angels. It changed me. Sam and Dean changed me.” He looked to Dean who was playfully rolling his eyes at his sentiment.
Dean’s face turned cold. “You wanna see a monster, kid? Start with the Cabbage Patch in Sam’s lap. He murdered our mother. That mean anything to
dog, witch!” Castiel spat out dangerously as he held her arms down beside her, glaring down at her with disapproval and thinly veiled anger.
“You’re still my Angel,” Dean added sappily as he pulled the comforter up to his armpits, the sappiness of their conversation helping to distract his dick into taking a rest.
“Do you hear that?” Castiel growled lowly in Dean’s ear as he broke their kiss.
“I can do it. I’ll be good…for you.” Dean swallowed thickly as Cas stroked along his jawline like he really was tempted to stay, and the heated look he gave him as he gently pulled away was proof too.
That night, Dean closed his bedroom door and leaned against it as he shimmied off his jeans and pulled his underwear down below his balls. He arched his back as he looked at himself, locked away in a pretty package, remembering Cas’ words the first time they’d done this. He’d had his reservations, but the moment he saw Cas’ face as he took him in, locked away for Cas’ later use, he’d been willing to try. This was the first time he was wearing it for more than a day, but with the night breaks Cas was insisting on, he wasn’t worried. He turned the lock on his door and got on all fours to pull out the box and extract the key. When he unclicked the tiny lock and gently popped off the cage, he immediately started chubbing up. Wait. Cas might not have been giving him night breaks just for his health. This was going to make nights
much harder.
“You come on my dick or you don’t come. I’ve given you everything you wanted today, now I want you to come for me one last time today. The way I want. You hear me?”
“Gotcha, come on Jack.” Mary stood over Jack who looked to Sam.
Dean and Cas have one last tryst before the end of the day, and Cas gives Dean something he's been asking for.
“Real smooth, you moron,” Dean growled out to himself as he reached under his seat and grabbed his pistol before exiting the car. He couldn’t argue with Cas’ logic as to why flaunting their relationship might be a bad idea. Some hunters were open minded and some of the most loving people in the world, minus the whole monsters things. Others he'd met just seemed to use monster hunting as an excuse to kill anything they didn’t like or agree with. There were extremes in every crowd. Going into an unknown situation, he was right. Dean knew it but damn if it didn’t sting. As he went to the trunk and began putting on his own knife sheath on his ankle and checking the rounds in his gun the rest of his family walked up to the car.
. They saw the mask you wear. Not their fault
,” Sam dropped his voice at the end.
Dean stopped in his tracks and leaned against the hall wall before sliding down and sitting, his legs partially stretched out in front of him. Was he losing it? Was this a remnant of the Mark? He couldn’t tell Sam he was hearing voices…especially not
Dean did finish the reorganizing in the kitchen and to be honest, the comforting pressure of the cage and the knowledge that he couldn’t comfortably get hard right now helped him focus and stop vibrating around the bunker. Sam noted the difference and teased him, assuming it was because he had gotten to talk to Cas. Well, he was half right.
Cas shrugged nonchalantly as he grabbed the neck of his sweat-soaked shirt and worked it over his head. “I wouldn’t know about that, considering I was not raised by a mother or father. You text your mom. I’m going to go shower….” He walked out of the kitchen doorway, his shirt bunched in his hand and Dean's eyes rose to follow him.
The photos he sent were closeups, fingers wrapped around him, angles where he’d moved his bowed legs so he was spread eagle, an angle that showed off the smooth expanse of his stomach while his dick lay thick, heavy, and neglected against it. That one was his favorite. He sent them and then threw the comforter over himself to prevent further temptation. He was very quickly rewarded for his actions. Cas Facetimed him immediately. It was dark outside so the lighting was bad and Cas was fumbling the phone around with frustrated energy, dropping it unceremoniously into the cupholder with a loud clank.
Dean sighed worriedly and nodded. “But then you can’t heal the slit throat, yeah, I know. A damn catch twenty-two there. Lizzie, do you know how to heal?” He turned on his heel and looked to her on the bed, where she had been watching their exchange. She sat up straight as Dean addressed her.
“I am no one’s dog and I belong only to you,” Castiel growled out desperately as he dug his fingers in, his lips moving to Dean’s neck, kissing and biting with an unusually frantic need.
“Don’t go, okay?” Dean grumbled sleepily as he turned on his side and laid his head on Cas’ shoulder.
good. From your mind to your heart…to your soul. You are good, for
“You had a last question?” Castiel prodded softly.
“Yeah, I figured you would,” Sam said in defeat as he pushed his own hair back with his hand nervously.
Dean leaned back in his chair, hearing his unhappiness but not understanding it. “Always are, and since it seems the hunters have gotten over the grudge they held against us way back when, it might be a good opportunity…”
Lizzie awkwardly began again, looking between the three of them with growing confusion and intrigue. “Umm, there’s also some emerald green, which also means you are a love-centered person.” Lizzie looked even puzzled by the end and Dean coughed uncomfortably as Cas looked at him across the table.
Suddenly Sam’s eyes narrowed suspiciously, and his mouth drew into a tight line. “Wait…are you two TRYING to get me to hook up with Lizzie?” He said this softly, a venomous whisper, as she was still loading up into her vehicle nearby, lingering as she stole glances to Sam and his family.
‘Holy shit, it’s the Winchesters!” roared an unseen voice from the crowd, then more joined in.
Jack shrank away, clutching it so tightly that his knuckles were turning white. “I
“Shit…” Lizzie shivered as she shook her head and ran her hand up her goosebump-covered arms, putting her other hand on the duffel and digging through it. “My sister keeps healing poultices but I need….Aha!” She held up a tiny bag made of burlap. “I’ve got what I need. I’m ready.”
"You're not worthless," Dean spoke softly, frowning at his words.
“Do I…” Dean licked his lips at Cas’ proximity, his breath ghosting along his neck and making his pulse jump. “Do I have to wear the cage the whole time?”
Anger brewed up so quickly, Dean couldn't let Sam even say the word, cutting him off abruptly. “So what about all the pieces they left behind? Do they just get a pass because they’re dead?”
you to wear it because I said so. I want you to have a reminder of who you are playing this game for since it’s been so easy…” There was no anger in his tone because he wasn't angry. The jerk was amused and making the game harder because of it.
“The other Angels aren’t giving you a hard time are they?” Dean asked with true concern now, seeing the tiredness in Cas’ eyes.
Dean swallowed back the grief that came from people saying Cas' name in the past tense, his mouth pulling up in one corner in understanding. “It’s okay. I’ve had a little more time to come to grips with it than you guys have, everyone in the world but me, Sam, and Jack being dead and all. To be fair, though, you’re right. He did have a way of reeling me in." Looking to lighten the mood, he leaned forward with a soft, forced smile. "Wanna know a secret, though? When he and Sam were alone together. Batshit crazy. Can’t explain it. They were like Dumb and Dumber. I swear.” Jody smiled as Dean forced a laugh, hiding the sadness that ripped through him.
. By an Angel…an Angel who'd seen him at his worst...and some days he even felt worthy of the devotion Cas bestowed upon him, and he tried to return it as fervently. Without thinking, Dean reached up the trace his hand along the upper…arch? Hell, he’d study bird anatomy tonight just so he didn’t look like an idiot to his winged lover. Cas buckled under the gentlest of touches and Dean, shocked, hit his knees as well. “Wha-“
Lizzie was fine enough company, leading the conversation and Dean and Cas exchanged smiles as Sam seemed engrossed in her stories about auras, chakras, and lore. So much lore. Dean began to relax and was able to eventually fenagle the seating arrangement so that he was next to Cas, after sending Sam and Mary both for beer rounds a few times. He’d smiled charmingly at his brother after the last time he’d left and Dean had swiped his seat next to Cas, making his Angel squeeze his thigh under the table to stifle a laugh.  Dean did find it odd that Lizzie brought up her sister so much, but that she never appeared. When he brought it up, she waved her hand dismissively and laughed, insisting her sister wasn’t much for hunter gatherings. He understood that…the beer was beginning to leave a fuzzy feeling in his mouth and the constant noise was making his head throb. He didn’t feel much for hunter gatherings either at the moment. He really just wanted to grab a pizza and some sodas and go back to the hotel room and crash with Cas and watch garbage tv, but they were on a mission. A mission that seemed to be going well by the way Sam was laughing. Dean relaxed eventually, leaning back in the chair, and relegating most of his attention to Cas now that it seemed natural to do so.
Cas tried to smile disarmingly as Lizzie took a dejected sip of her soda, her hair loosely hanging in front her face as a shield. “No, it’s okay. I just have some very private matters about my past I like to keep that way, at least until I know someone better, and you seem to do very well at hitting things very much on the nose. That is a gift for sure.”
good.”
“Castiel…” Dean whispered immediately as Cas pulled his finger away.
“No more than I expected. This time together is by far the highlight of my week, though. I forget that other Angels are so….”
are the only thing I could hear other than her,” Castiel said as he shuddered in Dean’s grasp. “I just couldn’t
Sam came over slowly, holding Jack carefully in his arms, answering slowly and cautiously. “Jody, this is Jack.”
"I’m sure Eileen filled him in on my arrival when you didn’t respond so he wouldn’t worry.” Cas’ eyes lit with humor as he saw the text. Dean shrugged and took another bite of his sandwich and chased it down with a sip of beer.
Claire saw the look on Dean's face, intrigue in her eyes. “What about
“Seriously dude. The shit you say gives me a headache and a boner at the same time.” Dean’s stomach growled and he dramatically rolled his eyes. “Food and drink first and then we can plan our evening.”
Dean winked and continued. “Anyway, mom and Jack are out hunting…and mom made some friends back when she helped the Dicks of Letters. If anyone knows any…it’d be her…” Dean said as he pulled his phone out from his shorts pocket.
“Did you break her?” Castiel said with a mixture of amusement and concern as he dropped the duffel next to her.
That voice might. Angry voices, voices that spit venom his way…that he could handle, but that gentle nudging voice that slid right over those walls he'd built…It would bring him to his knees if he let it, so he’d block it out. Nothing would bring Dean Winchester to his knees. “Not even you,” Dean growled low as he crouched to stand and ran a hand through his hair to retain his composure.
“Touch yourself with me,” Cas said, low and commanding.
shit…or being bi.”
“To see your wings, like your teasing me with you
Dean huffed in exasperation and gave Cas a puzzled look of his own. “Excuse me? I was actually talking to my friend Cas…”
? Please. A group of kill first ask questions later hunters would rather kill an Angel than study them. Please spare me your ridiculous lies.”
“Dude…You’ve been using Angel Grace to keep me horny all day. I’m pretty familiar with the fact that you
They came back in to find Jody sitting on the floor with Jack, the cheap plastic dinosaurs Sam had bought him strewn across the floor in colorful disarray.
“If you want, yes. Otherwise, a nap…then I keep you coming until you’ve had enough…or I decide you’ve had enough.” Dean gasped as Cas let Grace slide through his hand where he gripped his dick, feeling the rushing thrill of Cas’ healing touch…but this was definitely the first time Cas gripped him
Sam lifted one eyebrow, surprised. “Thanks to

be in question.”
“Still here guys…” Sam said loudly, annoyance thick in his tone now.
“It’s a really good thing Sam decided to go see Eileen before you got home,” Dean murmured as he rested his head on Cas’ arm, unwilling to move to clean up for a little longer.
The concrete roof became slick as the rain fell harder and Cas reached an arm around his stomach and pulled him up flush to his chest and brought his wings around to shield their faces from the rain, never missing a beat in his rhythm, now just seating Dean on his thighs as he fucked into him. Dean rested his head on his shoulder and eagerly stroked his fingers through the rain-slick feathers, loving Cas’ harsh breaths as he did. The building vibrated with the next thunderclap, Heaven’s storm drawing closer, but Dean could only care about the orgasm Cas was working out of him as his movements stroked along his prostate. He dropped his hands from his wings and clumsily tried to grab his dick but Cas knocked it away before taking both his wrists in his hands and thrusting them back into his wings.
The text from Cas that night didn’t even bring it up. He must have known day one was going to be easy. He gave Dean a rundown of where he was, their standard safety protocols, and a sappy, sweet message just for him. He shook his head as he texted back, still baffled as to how he could write such heart-skippingly sweet things and say the most
