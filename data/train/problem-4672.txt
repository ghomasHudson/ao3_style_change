all over again, maybe it’s not going to be a smooth ride. “What if I remember being a serial killer or something?”
They’re elderly, so it takes them a slow, uncomfortable minute to answer the door. Michael glances at her, nervous.
Adam turned out to be, considering he was related to the Winchesters. But he guesses being eaten alive by a ghoul kind of evens things out on the Winchester curse deal.
He waited for it, half-anticipated it, but it never came. This wasn’t like the other times, then. There was a wound, like a limb torn off all over, but now there was no feeling of drowning. There was pain, but when it lifted on occasion it left him feeling in colors, instead of in gray and deep, deep black, and after a while it was no longer a constant vise around his heart or the pressure of cinderblocks on his chest.
The comments from last night are still sitting strangely in his head. “What does that mean? You keep talking about Dean and Sam like they’re, I dunno, cursed.”
“A spirit that takes on the forms of the people it eats,” Kevin explains as fast as he can, as if that will somehow mitigate the fact that he is literally confirming the existing of flesh-eating shapeshifting zombies as they speak. “Most of them go for corpses, but someone told me about a case forever ago where they started going after people who were still alive. It probably ate your mom and then… uh.”
They are in Nebraska, driving west on I-80, nothing in sight but flat plains of dry yellow grass and dark leafless trees that splinter out of the ground. It is winter, but the sky is summer-blue and cloudless. He watches the country speed past through half-opened eyes from under a fringe of dark hair – he woke up a good fifteen minutes ago but he hasn’t found the energy to actually sit up. His chin leans against his chest and his arms are folded, and Dean hasn’t stuck a spoon in his mouth or anything, so all in all it’s a very comfortable position.
He still had the bearing of an angel, Sam noticed with some sadness. He wore Jimmy Novak’s body like a mask and a cloak. The preternatural poise and stillness of his body were the clear imprints of an angel’s presence, but if what he had been saying was true, then he could almost see the dead weight of two folded wings hanging from his back, and hear the clatter of brittle bones, and the rustle of papery, glossless feathers.
your help. I’ve been asking for it because you are good at what you do, and someone I consider – a friend.”
“So,” Kevin says when he’s halfway through his salad. “This kind of depends on what we find, but I don’t think you should stick around here too long.”
They actually miss the house the first time they drive past it, so Kevin has to make another trip around the block to make sure he knows where they’ll walk to. He leaves the car in a church parking lot and then they’re walking, insisting that Michael turn up his collar so it’ll be harder to recognize him, and Michael is leading the way.
“So, what’s the deal?” Susie somehow manages to make her whispers drill right through a person’s ear in search of their brain. “I saw you talking to that trucker, do you know him?”
. Something heavy slams down on his head and for a few good minutes all the thoughts are knocked out of his brain.
“Okay, now hold on a minute. You were just laying into me two minutes ago about how I was bothering you, telling me to scram, and now I’m invited on your next road trip? How do I know you’re not going to just up and murder me and chuck my body in a ditch, huh?” Which is a logical concern. He knows he’s just being kind of petty, though, because the alarms that have been going off in his head about the cops and hospitals are for some reason silent around this complete stranger who just snapped at him to leave a hospital after he got hit by a car.
“Sucks,” Kevin says with a note of sympathy in his voice. “I know the feeling. My mom could take care of herself, though. She was tough as nails.”
Her gaze is so sharp that it could cut. Val has to give credit to Michael for not squirming where she would have.
“Well, that’s the thing, isn’t it?” Kevin drops his duffel bag down on the bed and starts packing. Michael gets another look at the enormous Morton’s. Nope, not a hallucination. “What
“I dunno. Well, you listen to classical music, you’re not really... you don’t look like the kind of guy who goes around stabbing creatures of the night. No offense, I guess.”
Then, in the distance, he sees – and slows down. He stops about thirty feet out from a herd of deer, crossing the two-lane country road, tawny, and striped by the sunlight falling between the bare branches of the trees. Mist pooling around their thin legs, their cautious steps. A buck follows the herd, moss and leaves hanging from his antlers. He stops, turns to look at them, then slowly raises his head and bellows, breath pouring out puffs of white vapor. The sound is like a trumpet, and echoes and echoes off the sides of the mountains. For a moment, everything is still; Roger’s heart skips a beat in awe. In decades of trucking, there’s hardly anything that he hasn’t seen on the road, but this – it seems like the stag is telling them something, acknowledging them like fellow travelers.
The ride to the bus depot is practically silent except for the fuzz on the radio. David’s hands rest on the bottom half of the steering wheel, fingers occasionally tapping on the worn vinyl. Martha’s eyes sweep over the empty road, over the dense forest that surrounds them on all sides, worrying about one thing and then another.
“Valerie drove him here. Apparently he hitchhiked to Adelphi and she recognized your old shirt on him when he sat down at the diner.”
But as they pass through the endless forests of Wisconsin, nothing but gray sky overhead, Scott’s face becomes indistinct. He digs back further and finds he can’t quite remember what Martha or Roger looked like, either, and falls asleep with his fingers wrapped around her amulet.
“Nope. But after some detective work by yours truly, we recovered his actual name, and it’s not Michael. Want to guess what it was?”
Kevin leaves him in charge of watching the gas pump while he takes his bag into the gas station bathroom. After a few minutes, during which the pump handle clicks and stops dispensing gas, he re-emerges in a slightly-wrinkled, slightly-too-large suit and tie.
Internal injuries might not be a joke to Mr. Asshole Driver or the EMTs, but anything that comes out of Michael’s mouth seems to be. He has a sulk of moderate length and intensity in a shock blanket while the ambulance takes him to the nearest hospital and a confused technician checks him over again for broken bones and signs of internal bleeding. Under the lights of the ambulance, he sure
His eyes flick over to the two guys across from him. One of them is ancient, the quintessential white Midwestern pop-pop in an old windbreaker and a trucker hat, and the other is an Asian dude in a ratty OSU hoodie and jeans who looks like death warmed over.
He roots through the duffel bag to the sound of Kevin’s snoring. Apart from an absurdly big can of Morton’s and a weird number of water bottles, he can’t find any potential tools that a serial killer could use, so he figures he’s actually safe. All the shirts are definitely too small, but there is, in fact, an Illinois University sweatshirt that is kind of loose on him. He doesn’t even try the pants. The jeans will just have to stay on for an additional night.
in heaven just a little bit, that although no one down here knew who got in or got left out for sure, there was at least some kind of invisible Oprah Winfrey Show In The Sky going on and Dean had been awarded a ticket to paradise by virtue of having martyred himself time after time for his shithead little brother.
Castiel has this thing where he just lets his arms hang by his sides. Sure, he uses them to emote, but not very well, and not very often. It draws attention to him, not that he notices. Most people fidget or fold their arms or put a hand on their hip, but not the angels. Their arms are basically deactivated when they’re not being used. With the tone he takes, Castiel should be gesturing at him, but he doesn’t.
It’s only about half an hour in by the time he starts drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. He’s not averse to some quiet, but it really, honestly feels like he’s sitting next to a trauma time bomb. It’s unfair, but the kid relived getting eaten alive, and if he has a violent side, Kevin reaaaally doesn’t want to discover that while going a very illegal eighty-five on the interstate. But people cope with life changes in different ways, and stuff like that, so he just keeps quiet and hums along to a waltz.
cassette has been rewound, then pushes it into the deck. The opening riff snarls through the speakers and he sits back, stretching. Dean hums along again and bobs his head, then flashes a grin at him.
There’s a weirdly tense pause, and then Sam takes the wheel again. “Uh, we’ll get them settled in, and then… I guess it would be better to do it now, before Allison gets home? I mean, Beth might not want to see it either, because of the… you know.” The last comment is directed at Dean, who nods.
It troubled him sometimes because he had no idea what it meant – if Cas had chosen to go down the Sam road, the Dean road, or the John road. Once or twice he prayed to him but he never came, and Sam suspected that he couldn’t hear him anymore. So all he had were the stories of half-drunk hunters and an emergency contact number.
His thoughts spiral into flashes of feeling, peeling away from the pain that saturates every nerve ending, and he’s waited for this, for the first time in his life he’s wanted it – it’s fading. It’s cold. His mother leans over him, her long hair matted with his blood, and color is gone, then shape, and he’s small, now, the size of a pinhead, small enough for a thousand angels to stand on, and then smaller even than that, and then he isn’t.
“So it turns out that I was right,” he says, buckling his seat belt and turning the key in the admission. He’s given up on telling Adam to buckle up for now – if he wants to go out the windshield, he’ll go out the windshield. “You have family.”
“Morning,” he croaks, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and stretching his arms and legs as far as the car will let him.
“Sometimes I forget that you’re still so young, even though you’re capable of so much. Sam wasn’t the first one to save the world. Sam’s not going to be the last.”
“I think so. Or maybe – I guess I’m trying to find Sam, sometimes. But there’s a lot of moments where it’s just nothing. Like,
Dean turns to share a glance with Castiel that he can’t see. When he looks back at Adam, he looks a little wary. “Okay. I’m Sam’s older brother, Dean, and I, uh, met you. A long time ago. Twice, actually. One time it wasn’t you.”
“I don’t know. Either you’re a world-class scam artist, or you can actually help me figure out what the hell’s going on. I have no connections and nothing to lose, and you can’t kill me, as far as I know, so yeah, I’ll bite on the whole freakshow deal.”
“It’s settled, then,” Martha declares. “I think I’ve got some of Rodney’s spare clothes in the attic. Those should suit you much more nicely. Don’t you think he’s closer to Rodney’s size?”
But three wings erupt from the earth, spraying him with loose soil and small stones, wings made of clasping golden hands with eyes in their palms, wings that are three stories tall. The rest of the thing rises from the earth like from water, another set of wings, shimmering in the light. Each wing is connected to a ring, and the rings form a chain around a face – three faces – a hundred faces – they shift, become one another, become lions and horses and eagles. Behemoth is just one creature. This is an angel; this is Castiel.
Martha unties her apron and folds it up, placing it on the counter. “He’s lost almost all of his memory. We haven’t been able to figure out how he ended up here.”
“You’re hiding something.” Adam presents this as a statement, not an accusation. Kevin can feel the guy’s unblinking stare drilling twin holes in his face.
After what seems like an eternity, David presses two tickets into his hand, along with a wad of twenty-dollar bills and a slip of paper.
“You’re retired, aren’t you? And I’m an elderly dude! I have a right to gamble all of my money away.”
Spring Mill is a very small town. The population, Adam estimates, is probably just under two thousand. The town itself is nestled in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia (or so Kevin tells him) and there’s a river flowing somewhere nearby. The buildings are pretty small-town, some of them more upkept than others but all of them worn. Once they pull off the main street, the houses are very humble affairs, verging on run-down. There aren’t very many people here.
“If both of them got to come down here, they’d end up destroying the world. So I refused to let Michael use me. I didn’t know they were gonna get you as a backup, and I sure as hell thought we were going to be able to protect you from them.” There’s some bitterness that creeps in at the end, which Adam appreciates, because now he can start blaming people for the weird shit that’s been going on since he woke up incredibly naked in a random forest in Ohio, but at least he knows this guy feels kinda bad about it, maybe. “Did Sam tell you about his memories?”
Luckily enough, they just sit him down in a waiting room because he hasn’t sustained any injuries that could be detected in the ambulance, and he’s not goddamn dead, so all he does is sit there with one or two other people and wonder if he could just leave without them noticing. The lady at the counter is always in and out for some reason.
He stares out at the lake, each glimmer of light making his head throb. Everything here is so familiar, well-worn, like the handlebars of an old bicycle. But he doesn’t belong here anymore, does he? It’s been ten years at least, and everyone must have moved on without him. They’ve smoothed over the missing Milligans, and life has gone on. He can’t just pick up where he left off. He died in the basement of his own house, and no one knows.
Kevin’s a nice guy. When Michael is done with his shower, he towels off and pulls on his sweatpants and falls asleep instantly on the other bed, then wakes up thrashing out of his bedsheets.
“What, the people who hung my mom out to dry once they found out she had a kid out of wedlock? Hell no.”
Adam takes a deep breath. “Yeah. I mean, the alternative is sitting around twiddling my thumbs, and I – I want to know what the h—
There’s an extended awkward silence as Dean scratches his chin. The sound of it sets his nerves on edge. He’s not sure why until his irritation crystallizes into a big
gramps wants to get a word in. The younger guy cuts him off, though. “Not now, Barry.” And then he circles back. “I’m not in the mood for a visitation right now. And if you’re just going to sit there and play dumb until I say the magic words, well, you’re in the right place to do some waiting.”
“That’s the thing,” Adam replies. “I had a couple of best friends in high school. We were in the Scouts together until they quit, and we’d come here to the beach late at night and have a couple of beers, light some fireworks or something. Responsibly.” He takes a deep breath and puts his elbows down on the railing next to Kevin, leaning out over the lake. “I remember all of it. We used to drop by the sandwich place near that café we went to. Next to the gas station. We thought we were cool because we didn’t eat the cafeteria food.”
He watched her fall asleep, listened to her breathing and smoothed her hair from her face. That night, like so many other nights, he couldn’t sleep. He remembered long drives in the Impala. Stitches in his hand. An enormous moon shining down on a deserted road. A furtive Christmas in Illinois. Sunlight glinting off broken glass in the salvage yard and the smell of hot asphalt. Apple pie under plastic wrap at the convenience store. Arms that held him tight as he died.
There’s a grunt from the lump on the bed, and then snoring after a few minutes, which means Michael is free to do as he pleases.
Sam clears his throat. “Let’s, uh, table that for now. The number one priority is Adam’s safety. This house is pretty solid, don’t get me wrong, but it’s no…”
And then the mack daddy of concerning questions. Can he actually die? Did he just dream up getting robbed yesterday, or was it all just a wild hallucination? His duffel might still be on the bus.
“It was like going to sleep. I didn’t dream. I think he just kept me knocked out all the time, and I’d wake up if he got distracted… I’d – I’d try to find Sam, if I could. And then he was just gone, one day, and – I never… never went back to sleep.” He bites his lip. That’s the impression he gets from the dreams, but it still doesn’t feel quite right. Like he’s removed from it, when he knows he’d felt things so intensely that it almost burned him right up.
For some reason, that question freezes him. Not even the muscles in his throat can move. Every muscle in his body has locked up at the mere thought of
Other hunters sometimes can’t pin him as a hunter because of the way he dresses, which he finds hilarious. A clean-shaven (usually) twenty-something with close-cropped hair, kinda short, dressed like a college student? Not your normal fare. And Asians are pretty rare in the business, too. It does get him some flack, though, and he likes keeping to himself.
Her sharp teeth sink into his belly and his muscles spasm all at once as she comes away with a mouthful of flesh. It hurts so bad that he can’t breathe, she must be ripping his stomach out – and not-Barton is laughing, he knows that laugh, her smile is wrong wrong wrong all blood-stained teeth she draws the knife across his stomach
Well, since there’s no other apparent choice, he has to go with the road trip option, and just pray that the guy isn’t about to go postal on him. Not that it would matter, apparently, but his previous two brushes with death weren’t pleasant, so. He takes a deep breath.
The forest grows thinner and thinner and he can see now that the road runs between the feet of gentle hills. A house stands on the side of the road, two stories, white siding and blue shutters. The lights are on inside, on the second floor, and the curtains are drawn, but faint silhouettes move back and forth behind them. Laundry flutters gently from clotheslines in the yard, linens and shirts, dresses and pants. The sun is low in the west at the end of the valley and is quickly sinking, broken up by the spreading trees standing here and there around the houses. Suddenly he feels exposed – he is naked, after all – and he takes care that no one sees when he slips in between the clotheslines and takes a pair of jeans and an old, worn shirt. The shirt is gray and says
“Over there, in the back,” she says, pointing at the door with her finger. “There’s a trash can in there, too.”
Reluctantly, he leans the rake against the wall and slips his hands into the pockets of Rodney’s jacket. She can’t quite tell whether he looks guilty or suspicious or simply put-upon.
He spends a week drinking in scummy, smoky, poorly-lit dive bars where the whiskey is watered down and every bartender is an ex-Marine. He doesn’t talk to anyone except to hustle some locals at pool for a couple bucks, which is converted almost immediately into alcohol. It’s easy to let the drinks burn down his throat and smoke up his brain. He doesn’t think, just drives from place to place on the long, straight roads of the midwest and ends the day at the bottom of a bottle. He avoids the headlines, doesn’t allow his mind to linger on the issue of Cas – until he gets thrown out of a bar in Colorado for picking a fight.
“Not really, no,” he admits. “You can drop me off in St. Paul or something, doesn’t matter. Somehow I just know that’s where I need to be.”
“All right. Well, you’re not staying with me, because I’m not gonna be responsible for dragging you into my career, and I work better solo, anyway. And I’d rather drop you off with someone you know than in the middle of Nowhere, Minnesota. So at least give me his name. Maybe he has a Facebook or something.”
He is not visited by angels for a full year, during which the edges of the world start to crumble. Tornado Alley is patrolled by weather anomalies and fault lines quiver all over the States. Mountains shed rocks in landslides and tides come in higher and rougher. The Behemoth is pulling at the fabric of reality from the abyss beneath Purgatory. Dean drinks and gets tired, gets used to the absence of Sam like the absence of a limb – slowly, through false starts and sleepless nights, with his teeth gritted. The sun and moon wheel over his head faster and faster, accelerating him through the seasons as he drives and remembers everything. Plastic wrap on apple pies from the gas station, cider from roadside markets, gunpowder burns on Sam’s hand like freckles, a handful of silver bullets glinting in the evening sun. They come to him in dreams and on the road, in the bar, at the rest stop. At the lip of a bottle and beneath the treads of a tire. It’s heaven on earth and sometimes he thinks he’ll never die but continue through eternity watching scenes from his life replay on the backs of his eyelids as he lies sleeplessly in dingy motel rooms.
Michael turns to the old man in hopes that someone will interpret this babble for him. “Is he okay? Do you know if they’re gonna take him soon?”
“Neither have I,” Martha agrees. “I don’t think we’ve opened those boxes in years. Should have carted them off to charity a long time ago, but you’re welcome to keep them, if you like.”
“Right. And you definitely remember how to hand out the lip,” Kevin says, rolling his eyes. “But that’s a good sign, right? Like, it’s all coming back.”
“She was a good mother. Knew how to push me, knew when I needed sympathy and when I needed to get my ass in gear. It wasn’t all sunshine but I wouldn’t change it for a thing.”
“Nothing to be concerned about,” Cas says, as if he can sense Adam’s discomfort. Well, he’s an angel, so he probably can.
Beth had been possessed by a demon once, almost fifteen years ago. It had taken her body for a spin around the neighborhood and killed three people (Rachel, high school teacher, mother; Sierra, sheriff, parishioner; Brendan, frog enthusiast, twelve) before a local hunter had recognized Father Correias’s daughter beneath the blood smeared on her face and the vulgar taunts spewing from her mouth. Daniel brought her father to the place where he had tricked her into a devil’s trap. The exorcism was fast and brutal and left her unconscious for two days. Father Correias explained it as a sudden flu bug. No one ever found out.
“Uh.” Adam doesn’t look at him, scratches his head. “My freshman year in college. I was standing in line at the dining hall, and I was thinking about – like, mundane stuff. Grades. Plans. What I was going to do that week. I was dating Daisy at the time and we were supposed to meet up tomorrow afternoon to go someplace.” He shrugs. “Not spectacular.”
she reminds herself sternly. Well, that’s what watching reruns of murder investigation shows tells her, at least.
“I’m fine,” Michael says, and half-believes it. “I, uh. Felt pretty weird, but… I think I’m okay now. Do you know what happened?”
Adam sits on the bed as Cas takes a marker out of his pocket and begins to sketch out a sigil in quick, precise strokes on top of the wallpaper. He can’t imagine Sam will be happy about that. “Protections from what?”
“I have no idea what the hell you’re talking about.” Where’s the receptionist? She should be getting an earful right about now.
They all file into the living room – he guesses he should have expected Castiel to come along, too – and sit down awkwardly, Adam in the armchair and Dean and Castiel on the sofa. Castiel has great posture, but Dean kind of slouches and puts his elbows on his knees.
“Yep. All the big ones. I thought I had it all figured out. Turns out some asshole dug up an angelic Rosetta Stone, and I got divinely autopiloted to it for some reason. Try telling your parents that you’re a prophet of God. Doesn’t go over as well as a full ride from Princeton.”
Michael folds his hands on his lap, looking like a chastened schoolboy. “I, uh… when I woke up, I didn’t have any clothes. So I walked around and… found some on a clothesline. So I put ‘em on. And then I saw that the shed was open, so I slept in there for the night. Woke up early, and… here I am.” He watches Valerie’s expression. “I really didn’t know, ma’am, I wasn’t in my right mind.”
“Yeah, I’m gonna say no to that.” Kevin pulls a face. “I’m headed out after this. You could come with, if you want.”
“Yeah. If you died in – wait, how would you remember it was 2010 if you’ve been missing since 2009?”
They don’t talk much about him, since there’s really nothing to say, and he’s kind of wary about giving away his memory problem. Scott seems like the type of guy to worry about that. He lives in an apartment with two roommates; he’s a college dropout; he’s one of the only people who contributes income to his family after his sister ran away from home. He talks about his family a lot. Fourth of July celebrations when he was a kid and they lived in Naperville. Birthdays, anniversaries, graduations. Stories that stir something up in Michael’s memory, like blowing dust off of the cover of an old book.
A thought occurs to him, sluggish and unwieldy, that even he doesn’t really know who’s dying here. Who he is. Who his parents are. What he did before waking up in this field. Michael. Minnesota. Doesn’t even know his age. His shoe size. His address.
“It took the last of my strength, and help from one of my sisters, but I considered it a sort of last trip home.” He drank. Sam decided not to question it any further, but he didn’t know where to start, otherwise.
She put her hand over his, stroked her thumb across his knuckles. “I might visit my grandparents soon.”
He groans silently into his hands and sits in the Burger King until four in the morning, napping intermittently, before deciding to try his luck at the gas station across the street when a U-Haul rolls in.
at the wound like a leech and it feels like she’s ripping out his muscles and veins through the open wound and he can’t. stop. screaming. He tries to rip his arm away but not-Officer-Barton puts his hands on his shoulders, keeps him clamped down and he can’t move away from the pulling, burning
“Short story, yes. I knew what you were in the ER for, I knew no one would stop you from leaving, and I knew that there was something weird about you. And usually, people who just appear around me with that kind of off-ness about them? They want something. But you just kept going on about how you got hit by a car.”
Kevin gives the house a once-over, without much expression, and nods. “Okay. You wanna wait down the street while I do some recon?”
“Ran the gamut while he was passed out. Salt, holy water, silver, consecrated iron, and no signs of sucking out my life force so far. He’s just a little spaced out.”
He wants to throw up again but all he can manage is a pathetic dry heave. His lungs and throat are burning and the room is spinning around him. His body snaps back to attention as his bonds are severed and he tries to kick out against not-Barton but those old hands are like iron and he’s tossed on the floor like a heap of trash. It knocks the wind out of him and he manages to keep his chin tucked in so he doesn’t crack it open on the floor, but he can’t focus his eyes and he gasps for breath like a fish out of water. His attempt to get on his hands and knees and get
He did not retire; every hunter knows there is no turn-off from the road. But afterwards, everything left him alone, which was what he’d been hoping and praying for all along, even if it was only in secret hopes and furtive prayers. Monsters gave up and ran off and a door swung shut behind them, closing with a weary thud. He knew it was different this time because before, in a month or two, he’d have found himself driving down a quiet country byway with no one but the trees and the plains and the sky to watch him stagger from motel to motel, sleeping with a gun under a pillow that smelled like cigarette smoke.
this like the back of his hand, flashes of memories. Walking to school in the morning darkness, festivals by the river, Cousin Oliver’s Diner, the auto parts store. The car dealership where he got his pickup. It does nothing to stop his gut from tying itself in knots.
Adam nods, and Kevin thinks he might drift off again, but the thousand-yard stare is gone and he seems to be processing all of this new information.
“Just my mom. She passed a couple of years ago. It was peaceful, though. No monster, no spirit, nothing. Just... normal. It’s basically unheard of for a hunter who has any family left, but she could keep herself safe. She knew a couple of tricks. I had some cousins, too, but we never really kept in contact.”
“Good,” Sam replied. For the first time in a while he felt light, and he’d been fighting gravity for so long that he had forgotten what it felt like to be sure of himself. “You never said – how are you?”
“He’s like fifteen years older than me, and anyway, I wouldn’t date anyone who tried to kill my mom. I have
doesn’t ring any bells, and he’s not sure he’s going to like what they find when they solve this mystery. But it’s like looking at a rotting corpse and being overcome by morbid curiosity, unable to look away in horrified fascination, except the body is his own.
Kevin surveys him and clearly doubts what he’s saying, but switches the topic anyway, maybe because he’s feeling considerate. “Okay. Well, it seems like you’re getting a lot of your subconscious memory back, or something. I mean, you know about Godzilla, you know about Taco Bell.”
He tries. He really does. He can’t make it out, can’t keep the memory in his head long enough. It skitters around, like it doesn’t want to be exposed to his scrutiny.
Kevin nods as he turns them around, heading back into town. “Okay.” He reaches a hand out across the center console, and Adam takes it. They shake hands. “Nice to meet you, Adam.”
“Wait. Where are you going? I mean, it’s nice of you to offer, but I was trying to get further up into Minnesota, so…”
The boy flinches and almost drops the casserole, startled, while Martha comes over to kiss him on the cheek.
She raises the pendant up to the window to look through it. The moon, it seems, fits perfectly within the hole, and for a moment, the engravings catch the light, and glow.
Michael’s stomach does a flip. Now that the purpose of his journey north actually has an end goal, and a very specific ETA, he’s getting some jitters. What the hell are they going to find? Is his brain just shutting down his memory because it’s protecting him from some really bad stuff?
“Sam told me. Thanks, I guess,” he says, because that seems like the appropriate thing to say, and they lapse into silence again.
He’s in the back room of the Seven-Eleven. It’s bright, and his skin feels like it’s being pricked with needles all over. He tries to flex his hands where it hurts the most, but the blood seems set on returning in its own time.
“I have a sense for that kind of thing. Someone like you is usually linked to a higher power with a god complex who thinks I’m still in the business.”
Castiel doesn’t contact him. Dean is sure that he knows he’s there, though, and he tries to go about his business as usual to show that he’s not worried. Except he is worried. And he thinks about praying, but what is he going to do? He can’t fight, won’t fight anymore. Lisa made him feel this, years ago, like he couldn’t pick up a gun again, but not in this way, not because the fight had gone out of him. He’s an old dog, now, no good for hunting anymore, who would rather lie by the fireside and sleep. Three days pass in a haze of cold air, smoke from the fireplace, and black coffee.
He wipes his mouth with his napkin and folds his hands thoughtfully. “That waitress almost recognized you. You’re a murder victim, and until we know whether they found an identifiable body, we don’t want to raise any suspicion.”
“Absolutely.” Val knows for a fact that her husband wasn’t built like this kid, but in relative terms, it’d be a step in the right direction.
Kevin blows out a long breath while dialing Sam’s number. “I’m guessing it was Castiel’s angelic presence.”
I know what I said about updating "in a few months," but I finally managed to watch The Episode and was motivated to clean up this chapter. I guess I have mixed feelings about it? Great performances, but if we're all supposed to have closure after a single episode, man, I dunno. Anyway! Hope this provides some intrigue. I still can't promise a consistent update schedule, although I currently have about ~30k+ more written that needs to be made presentable before posting, so who knows!
“I don’t know, you just do.” Kevin has a little laugh to himself and shuts his laptop. “Okay. Cop time. Good thing I shaved today, I’m gonna need a minute to change.”
“You’re a very instinctual person, Valerie, and I admire that about you, as it’s something we share,” Martha says. She’s never been one to sugarcoat… well, anything. She turns her hawklike gaze back onto Michael. “My instinct is that Michael is a fine boy who has fallen on some hard circumstances, which might not be alleviated by the poking and prodding of policemen.”
“Thank you,” he mumbles, getting up from the table. She can see his bare feet, the soles dark with dirt, as he walks across the diner and pushes the door of the bathroom open, disappearing momentarily.
He felt strange. Everything had become quiet and he couldn’t pin down when it had started to be that way. Something was wrong, or nothing was wrong. There was no way of knowing.
“You’re related to the Winchesters. All that life was gonna come back to bite you in the ass someday.”
“Let a guy wake up before dropping the existential crap, man.” He kicks off the blanket and cracks what feels like every vertebra in his spinal column, then tosses the pillow back on the bed and folds the pullout back in. You’d think sleeping in a bed for the first time in a couple of days would actually be good for his back, but apparently every cramp and bump in the road just exorcized itself out through his spine.
“Not fuckin’ funny, asshole,” he breathes, right before the nagging pressure in his head explodes into roaring fire and white light.
On the morning of Christmas Eve, Beth took Allison to Day Mass and he was alone in the house. Usually he went with them on Sundays, at first more out of obligation than anything else, but then because it gave him a chance to connect with his neighbors, if not the divine. Beth’s father was a priest in Arkansas and very familiar with hunters, and as a consequence she had grown up with very tangible reasons to pray, knowing that shadows could have teeth and claws. She knew how to stitch up a wound and tie a tourniquet and fire a rifle, and had an arsenal of prayers besides.
him. They’re not exactly having a heart-to-heart, here, which he’s glad for, but at the same time Kevin maintains a vast amount of emotional distance between them and it would be kind of frightening if he wasn’t so friendly. It’s because he says everything the same way – his voice never drops into sadness. His face is always a little distant, and he talks like he’s relating a story someone told him a long time ago. The more they talk, the more Michael runs into barriers that prevent him from getting a good look at this guy.
He doesn’t stop for breaks and it’s late in the night by the time he gets home, every permutation of every horrific scenario he can think of racing through his head. He desperately hopes beyond hope that he’ll walk right through that door and she’ll be standing there in her green scrubs, tired but healthy and whole and
“Around nine years. I haven’t spoken to him in a couple, though. I’ve been going from hunt to hunt for the past few years.”
“I won’t know until I see it for myself. But it’s probably a screen of some kind, to prevent you from accessing more… damaging memories. Do you ever remember seeing Michael?”
“That’s one of the things we’ll have to discuss. Dean said that the last time he saw you before you were possessed, you were running from Michael and not in the mindset of a consenting vessel.”
Val chokes on her cookie momentarily, and clears the blockage with a swig of milk. “I thought you’d like to see him first.”
Things around them start to seem familiar. Street signs, houses, the distances between turns. He doesn’t even realize he’s tensed up until his arm starts to ache, and he unclenches his hands and takes a deep breath. His nails have left red crescent marks on his palms. He can’t pin the source of his anxiety down because he doesn’t
that Dean had finally gotten what he deserved and no more of this life-on-earth bullshit, no more eternal weight of the world. He couldn’t imagine it, though, and wanted to ask Cas every single question he could think of – what was he doing, what was it like, who did they see, everything
“Maybe. It’s just a hunch.” He drags his fork through the remains of the casserole on his plate, deep in thought.
He’s been running for a year. Weightless, and free, but only in the way a feather is weightless, only in the way that a message in a bottle is free. Aimless, for the first time in his life, letting the armory in the trunk rust, collecting bottles in the shotgun-side footwell. He’s gotten used to Sam being dead, but he hasn’t dealt with it, only thinks about it when he’s too far gone to remember. He wonders if this is what Sam felt when he’d been blasted into Purgatory. He’d driven, too, long and blank across the silent highways, following his highbeams through the night. This, Dean realizes, is the moment Sam hits the dog with his car: he wakes up, starts fixing things, and falls in love.
Kevin shrugs. He doesn’t want to elaborate about the Winchester curse or anything like that. “We just fell out of contact.” That’s the easiest way to explain how Sam Winchester works. “It was a bad time for everyone and we just kind of went our separate ways. But now there’s you, so I guess I’ll be paying him a visit.”
He walks around to the other side of the car, gets in the driver’s seat, and pulls away, and they leave Windom behind.
“Why don’t you rake some leaves for me, Michael?” She points to the rake leaning against the shed. David should have done it before he left, but there’s no relying on that man’s memory these days. “I’m going to sweep up here.”
“Hitchhiker,” he says, shaking his head. “Apparently he can’t remember anything, not even his own name. I picked him up walking on the road about half an hour out.”
in precise red letters. They nab a seat in the corner, away from the counter and the one teenage girl texting there, two untouched black coffees standing between them on the table.
Castiel blinks. “Yes. My vessel’s name is James Novak. His soul is in Heaven, so he no longer has use for this body.”
Kevin almost freezes at the wheel, but his survival instincts thankfully kick in just in time to prevent them from certain death. “You’re right, actually. Shit. I thought they might have had something to do with this, but since none of them showed up… Maybe I was just being optimistic. We might have to have Cas put in a call.”
The lights inside are bright enough to make him squint, and the LCD menu screens – wow, fancy – don’t help. He stands there for a couple of minutes, thumbing through the five bucks and change in his jacket pocket, before ordering a coffee and sitting down in a booth. Not too different from the bench, but it’s warm. He stares down at the white lid, then presses his fingers against his right eye, where a headache is just starting to form.
He shakes his head and looks back at the road. What an odd memory. He hasn’t been back to All Saints Episcopal in decades. It frightens him a little, the sudden intensity of the image. It hangs in the back of his mind. Saint Michael, with his long spear pointing toward heaven, multicolored wings folded up behind him, the head of Satan crushed under his foot. The air around him has changed. Roger sits up a little straighter, as if he’s in a pew and the minister’s eyes are on him, and the eyes of a hundred spirits.
“Calm down, calm down,” Kevin hisses, grabbing him by the shoulders. Something in his brain snaps back into place and he chills out, taking deep breaths while Kevin turns the lamp on and sits down across from him, rubbing his eyes. Michael untangles himself from his sheets and sits up, head suddenly throbbing.
on it, with a list of names running down the back. It looks old—the print is flaking off in some places. When he puts it on, the sleeves hang halfway down his hands. The jeans barely fit him. Neither of them do much to keep the cold out.
“Uh, sure.” Adam throws a look back over his shoulder to the kitchen. Sam and Kevin are talking shop. Suddenly, he feels very alone.
“I think they stock them at the diner. Oh, land, I should call Valerie today and tell her about all of this.”
“I don’t know,” she replies. “All I know is that the police won’t be able to help him. This doesn’t seem like that sort of problem.”
The last time is at night, and the gas station he’s ejected from is remote, to say the least. He doesn’t know where he is, just that he’s probably still somehere in Wisconsin, and the next town over is a couple of miles away. He decides he can probably get there in a night – just follow the road, right? There’s no pedestrian walkway, but the path he chooses doesn’t go along a highway. It’s local-ish. Four lanes and only occasional street lights.
Fortunately for Kevin, what he pleases to do is take a hot shower and get some clothes on. Clothes he hasn’t been murdered in. The hotel shampoo makes his hair squeak under his fingers, but he doesn’t care. Oh, man, the hot water feels good. He’s sure that lathering, rinsing, and repeating has never brought anyone this much joy.
At six in the morning, heading to Adelphi, Roger picks up a kid on the side of the road who doesn’t know his own name. It looks like he’s been sleeping on the ground, what with the grass sticking out of his hair and the dirt stains on his shirt. He’s got a lot of theories: lost hiker, kidnapping victim, escaped from a caretaker, victim of a prank gone wrong. Maybe Roger’s the one being pranked – maybe he’s on candid camera. He doesn’t know how much entertainment an old trucker can give the people nowadays. He’s picked up hitchhikers of every creed and color in his time. Nothing is a surprise anymore.
“Where to start. Um, well, as I said, he’s a hunter. He’s married, last I heard, one kid. He should be about – thirty-nine by now. He lives in West Virginia, where we are currently headed… like, what do you want to know?”
A spark of anger flares in his chest. “What do you want me to say? That you’re right? That the world’s going to end? Sure. Do you know whose fault this is? Not ours. Yours, God’s, the angels’. You let your family hate each other and you screwed humanity because of, what, sibling rivalry?
The field is empty and quiet but the earth shivers every so often and sets the leaves rustling. He stands at the edge of the clearing, chest heaving, breath leaving his lungs in puffs of mist. It’s around two in the afternoon by the sun. He shades his eyes, trying to find the stone they stood on. He locates it at the other end of the clearing and heads for it. The tremors get stronger and stronger as he crosses the center of the field, and he stumbles a few times. When he looks up at the ring of clouds he sees a star shining bright in the blue sky. He doesn’t know why, but it fills him with a sense of foreboding. When he climbs up on the rock, the earth shakes once, so violently that he lies flat on his stomach to avoid falling off. It happens two more times and then there’s nothing for the longest time. The sun begins to fall. He shivers. Wonders how Cas is doing, or if he’s dead already and he’s going to wait out here until the world ends.
They drive for hours, stopping occasionally to fill the tank – Kevin pays in cash at the counter – and finally stop to eat at a dingy Taco Bell attached to a gas station. Kevin’s a vegan, Michael learns, so he practically worships the place, and Michael lets him order for both of them. It’s another few hours to the middle of Minnesota, and by then the sky is dark and their way is lit by street lamps. Kevin powers through an entire performance of
“Not really. It’s – complicated. You could probably say I’m a cross between pest control, a hunter, and…” His fingers drum on the steering wheel. “A detective, I guess. For all your spooky needs. Exorcisms, banishments, weird murders, kids who summon a vengeful spirit to beat up the class bully, you name it, I deal with it.”
“There’s something strange about him,” she says, and Val prepares to retort with some facts. “I don’t know what it is. Not bad, but strange, still. I’ll keep an eye out for you, dear, and don’t worry about the other tables.” And she pats Val on the shoulder and leaves. Her words leave a sense of foreboding at the bottom of her stomach.
“Kate.” Kevin hums. “Michael and Kate from Minnesota. Cases have been built on less.” He arches an eyebrow. “You’re taking this pretty well, by the way. Usually people start yelling at this point.”
“I can’t drive around Windom looking for a house in the suburbs. Everything looks the same. Can you remember, like, a house number?”
Grass stalks and twigs dig into his feet as he walks, and walks, and walks, and eventually he leaves the field behind and the grass gives way to leaves and dirt. The forest is quiet around him but the trees seem to be sighing, settling their roots deep in the ground and preparing for the coming cold. And even these pass, as through the trees he finds a road, a mud-streaked gray ribbon of asphalt twisting into the distance, halved by a dotted yellow line. He follows it at a distance, unwilling to leave the cover of the trees. The occasional car passes below, unsuspecting.
“Mm. You look like shit. Did you sleep at all?” The left door opened with a swoosh of suction and she fumbled around for the creamer.
“And another question,” Kevin continues. “But I guess this one doesn’t matter as much. Why’d you take Michael as your name?”
and above the Y in “family” there’s a red stain from when her father-in-law accidentally spilled chili on himself during dinner last week. It looks like Martha couldn’t manage to get it out after all.
David leans back in his chair. “I think,” he says slowly, “that we should figure this out in the morning.”
When he finally brought himself to touch the lighter to the gasoline-soaked cloth, Cas was there, too, so silent that he could have been a mirage in the heat of the fire, every word that came to their mind in the tongues of angels and humans crumbling to dust in the flickering light. Sam watched, even though the smoke made his eyes sting and water, and he didn’t bother to wipe his face. When the flames had their fill and only burned in embers, Cas stood next to him.
“Black dog. Appropriate, right? Portents of death, oooh, and crap. I saw it around town a few times while I was huntin’ it down.”
if anything, he didn’t know. Family, for a Winchester. He’d never seen God, just good people and monsters and sometimes a mix of both. Sometimes he wished for the amulet back, just to see, but Beth wore her rosary and scapular with such confidence and faith that hanging around her seemed like a better bet.
They head for California the next morning and drive down the coast, aimless, drifting, but content. The waves crash endlessly on the white shore. Gulls perch on the piers and rocks. Sandpipers dash in and out of the water. Castiel looks through the old cassette bin in the glove box meticulously, examining every tape until he finds one he likes. It’s one of Sam’s, of course – Cas hasn’t learned to appreciate the real classics yet, but he’ll come around. The tape opens with Dewey Bunnell crooning about alligator lizards and changing his name, and plays them down onto the Pacific Coast Highway.
He does. Kevin sits down across from him, looking haggard and definitely not up for dealing with some teenager’s bullshit, which other people would maybe call
He was... all right. Surprisingly. It was almost like learning to walk again after having his knees blown out. The foremost thoughts in his head became less
“That doesn’t surprise me. It wasn’t built for humans. You would have trouble comprehending it without the interference of an archangel.”
“I don’t know.” He sounds tired. “I just got this headache, and then… it just came to me. It was strong, familiar. I don’t know what else it could be… except my name.”
“Is there – do you have a last name? We could use that to help you find your way back… wherever you’re supposed to be.”
“Pretty sure there’s a pullout,” Kevin says, and chucks a pillow and a blanket from the closet at the tiny couch. Michael is about a hundred percent sure he’s not going to fit on that thing. “Feel free to use the shower or whatever.”
There’s no response, but the fingers on his hands curl. Roger can only watch as his arms begin to shake with tension. He can see the kid’s clenched jaw, hear his quiet but erratic breathing – he’s got to be in pain. For a long, horrible moment, he just watches while he grasps for different words. And then it stops, and the kid relaxes a little, runs his still-trembling hands through his hair. He takes a deep breath and looks straight at him with a chillingly clear gaze.
Since Alexandria isn’t the goal, he asks George to drop him at the nearest rest stop. George shoots him a weird look, but just makes a face and says okay, and in about two hours he’s off on his own again, watching George’s taillights disappear on the highway.
“Hey,” Kevin says, twisted around in the driver’s seat. Adam props himself up on one elbow groggily, wiping his face down with the sleeve of his hoodie. “You ready to go to Goodwill?”
He goes up over the hood, slamming his head on something before coming back down onto the road on the other side, and everything goes white.
“Everyone knows you could take on a sharptooth,” Sam said, letting his head fall back against the decrepit wooden rail. “What was it?”
“I mean, kind of. Remember all that bloodline stuff? It’s ancient history. Trouble always finds those guys. But despite all of that, they’ve pretty much come out on top, so.”
“There’s no safer place. That thing is spooky-proofed. Crank the seat down, take a nap. We’ll be done in no time.”
His mom, in a black business suit, taught him how to pay respects to his grandmother at her grave. He visited his father’s grave for the first time when he was twelve, and she was proud of him for knowing just what to do. He still has her driver’s license in his wallet.
He shakes his head. Mostly because he doesn’t want Kevin to confirm that he’s died multiple times from supernatural causes. “Maybe later.”
“We’re not sure.” Dean takes the reins back. “Maybe supernatural PTSD. Like Lucifer was still connected to him in some way before Cas cleaned up the memories.”
“Yeah.” He looks down at the remains of his pancakes. “It’s just weird, I guess. Like I had all this life before, but now it doesn’t count. And I’m starting over again for the second time in a month.”
Adam Milligan wakes up in the back seat of Kevin Tran’s car, parked in the middle of nowhere, head still throbbing, face wet with tears.
He frowns. “They can do shit like that? Wiping memories? And you said they’re usually involved in resurrections, right?”
“I thought they were supposed to be, like, messengers of God or whatever. Bunch of blond dudes with wings.”
Nothing changes about Castiel’s expression, and that’s a relief, actually, because it’s better than pity or confusion. It feels like he might actually know something, and even the idea of that helps keep him calm.
The snallygaster, or so the locals said, was half-lizard and half-bird, with a metal beak full of sharp teeth, and one horrible eye in the middle of its forehead. It had wings like an eagle’s and four taloned feet, yellow-and-black striped scales on its skin like armor, and a long whiplike tail. It drank human blood and ate chickens, but the bloodsucking part was the main concern.
He sits up. He is in the middle of a vast field, and when he stands the grass brushes at his calves. The hills are a faded yellow, dotted here and there with trees shaking off red and yellow leaves, and in all directions lies the misty suggestion of a forest. A brown creek is marked off with the standing husks of cattails and reeds. And the wind – the wind starts as a whisper, far away, growing louder and louder until it seems to howl straight through him, and he shivers.
But only for a brief, sharp moment. By the time the car’s driver reaches him, everything broken has knitted back together. Doesn’t stop his nerves from screeching in alarm.
Cas doesn’t leave and Dean doesn’t say anything else. It feels like hours pass in silence and he can almost pretend nothing has happened between them. The sky, away from city lights, is dark and dusted with silver stars. Some of the bigger ones glimmer red and blue, like the lights on police car sirens. He can see Orion, the Big Dipper – if he looks harder, Leo and Pisces. The dusty belt of the Milky Way divides the sky in half and the moon is large and bright, the gray imprints of craters sharp on its face. It reminds him of the moon over the road in Heaven, in their Heaven, where Sam is now. He wonders if they’re watching the same night pass over their heads. He wonders if stargazing with Dad is one of Sam’s good memories.
They spent a couple of months in Iowa when Dad was on a hunt, when they were young. He’s come to realize that it’s the same wherever there’s corn – when you drive to school or work in the morning in June it’s barely out of the ground, calf-high, and with each passing morning you look out the window and see the fields covered in early mist, growing higher and higher, knee-high, waist-high. Then one day, down in the guts of August, it reaches over your head, dark green stalks and long, broad leaves in a forest rising up on the side of the road. Then someday in October, when fog pools between the hills, it’s gone, and the fields lie brown and bare for winter. That’s how he feels: past the prime of summer, stalled on the side of a country road as leaves fall silently from tree branches tangled with power lines. He used to kiss girls on nights like these, against the hood of his car. He wonders how many of them made it out of their hometowns.
“I’m sorry,” he says after a moment. “I think – I have a headache. It’s – sorry.” He rubs his eyes and the bridge of his nose.
The police department is a squat red brick building that looks extremely inoffensive, and he’s about to protest being left in the car again before he remembers Martha talking about her no-cops hunch. Out of respect for the old lady whose son’s stuff he lost, he is nice and quiet and stays in the car twiddling his fingers while Kevin marches off to bamboozle the boys in blue.
“Nah, man, you’re good. It’s just…” He shrugs and shoulders the duffel. “Let’s talk about it in the car, okay? I gotta check out.”
she scolds herself. They’re eating pretty slowly. The boy has his head cradled in one hand, fork in the other; Roger is reading the local newspaper. They almost look like father and son, really – well, adopted, a white kid and his black dad – and no one else except Susie seems to pick up on anything abnormal about the shoeless amnesiac boy. Confirmation bias, maybe. Paranoia, also maybe.
Dean stares at the words and notes all of the empty space. There’s not even a picture like Jessica’s stone had. Their lives are marked with long stretches of emptiness punctuated by death and struggle, like lone trees on a long, wide plain. He reaches down to touch it and lets his hand linger for a second. Sam’s not here. Sam’s happy somewhere up there, and if he has to haul himself up through Hell to see him again with no help this time, then he will. But that can wait. Someday he’ll go home, but maybe not today.
“He’ll have to contact someone who still belongs in the Heavenly Host and might know what’s going on,” Kevin explains. “Heaven is just a constant chess game with a thousand players nowadays.”
Valerie, being of relatively sound mind and body, knows there won’t be anyone at home for a while, so she takes Michael back to the scene of the crime: her in-laws’ house, about forty-five minutes out of town. Michael doesn’t say anything, preferring to stare out of the window. That’s fine by her – he’s probably been through some kind of unspeakable
Well, he’s fairly sure he won’t have a stroke, so he just nods and gives her what must be the weakest smile in the history of smiles. She gives him an awkward thumbs-up, and soon there’s a cup of water on the table next to the coffee. He manages to chug it all in one go, with a coffee chaser to counteract the fresh-from-the-dispenser-cold water.
That name sounds so familiar. Kate’s his mom, he guesses. He wishes he’d been able to see their faces in the memory, but any real part of his past remains frustratingly out of reach. What’s the point of putting up with these headaches and dreams if the memories aren’t going to come pouring back in?
Kevin says that Spring Mill is located in the east, but everything blends together in trees and mountains and small towns, one after the other, dressed in orange and yellow and brown. It’s miles and miles of this, and the road to Spring Mill hugs the side of a mountain covered in trees. His ears start popping every so often. Kevin’s probably going to break his jaw if he clenches it any tighter.
“You have approximately sixty percent of your life ahead of you, Dean, so I wouldn’t advise that.” Castiel has that serious look on his face and Dean decides to humor him for now.
The doubts in the car come rushing back, along with a familiar pressure at the back of his eyes. “If I’m even me.”
We'll encounter a lot of OCs in this chapter and the next; if that's not your cup of tea, rest assured that we're returning to the main cast shortly. :)
“Well, all right.” He puts his arm around her waist. “You have a good heart, Martha. I’m sure it’ll all work out somehow.”
It’s the middle of November. Things are only going to get colder from here on out, and he gets the feeling that sleeping in random sheds isn’t always going to turn out so well for him. He needs places to stay at night, which means he needs money.
They leave the table to go upstairs to Rodney’s old room. All of the decorations have been taken down – his football posters, science fair medals, OSU gear – to complete the conversion into a guest room. His old clothes are in plastic storage containers that Michael fishes out of the closet under Martha’s instruction, and they rummage through them for a bit before laying out a few outfits and putting the rest of the clothes back. Val and Martha go back downstairs to allow Michael some privacy while he changes and washes up.
“It does scare me. It scares the shit out of me. But not more than I can handle. Okay? So just do it. Whatever you’re going to do.”
“I see.” This is a lot. He hangs his jacket on the back of one of the chairs and turns to the sink to wash his hands. “Well, I’m curious as to why you took my clothes.”
“Of what?” Michael sets his burger down on the plate and puts his elbow on the table. “Look, what if someone does recognize me? If I’m officially dead, it doesn’t matter. I can just say I’m not the guy who died. It’s not like they’re going to arrest me for being alive.”
“Maybe community college? State school, even?” Kevin scratches his chin again. “I dunno. Depends on how everything pans out.”
“The cash is in his fucking coat,” someone says. They try to take the coat off of his back, but he lashes out with his leg and catches one of them in the stomach. Finally, he gets a good look at his attackers: two guys in hoodies and sweats, one reaching for his coat again.
“If you can’t find whatever it is you’re looking for, just call,” Martha says. “You can come by anytime.”
Adam counts in his head. “Applying to college? Means you were a junior. So you were, like, sixteen.”
things, not just sudden flashes of whatever. He knows the missing parts of him are out there, somewhere.
nonsense. He fought to protect you for a very, very long time, since you were just a clump of cells swimming in a tidal pool. But he wanted to be a good son, even if it meant ending your world and killing you.”
The flutter of wings catches him off-guard. He turns his head to see Cas sitting next to him, trenchcoat and all, unruffled, like there isn’t a war going on right now.
“That’s dangerous shit, dude,” Scott says, mouth pinching in concern. “Look, I already thought I found your dead body behind the dumpster tonight, okay? And if you won’t let me take you to the cops or a hospital, the least I can do is make sure you don’t die on your way to catching the next bus.”
“No, you shut up.” He reached one hand over to swat his brother’s head without taking his eyes off of the road. Sam retaliated by fucking biting his finger. Dean yanked it back with a yelp. “I’m driving, asshole!”
It’s Castiel who breaks the silence this time. “So, you don’t remember anything about… Angels? Satan? Heaven and Hell?”
He’s silent for a while. The lack of – anything, terror, even nostalgia, even homesickness, terrifies him. It’s like he’s not quite in himself, like he’s wearing someone else’s skin and looking at someone else’s house through their eyes, with a whole slew of dormant memories waiting to burst into his consciousness like a trauma volcano.
It leads to a covered bridge, where the rush of water from the river below fills the air and rebounds off of the wooden boards – it forces him out of the woods for a brief moment. He sees telephone poles, a pair of ratty shoes tied together at the laces and dangling from the wires. The land slopes beneath his feet, and he goes down, down, down through golden woods and quiet streams, past giant boulders covered in moss and lichens, past abandoned birds’ nests and once or twice a grazing deer. When the road flattens out, his feet ache and the sky blazes orange in the sunset, diffuse light glowing through sheets of frozen cloud. For a moment his breath catches in his chest because it looks like a great fire. It is steady and silent and in some places it looks like the sunlight is catching on veins of gold and making them shine white-hot.
Kevin keeps chipping at the blank slate that covers his memories as they drive. Nothing surfaces that’s anywhere near the one that screwed up his brain for hours, the flash of which he has locked firmly in the back of his head and refuses to revisit.
“The books are better,” Kevin says snidely. “But for real, dude, there’s a lot of stuff that I don’t know how to explain on my own. And I’m sure Sam is holding onto some crucial stuff as well. You’re missing a year, we don’t know how you got back, and we don’t know who brought you back or why, so I’d say we still have a lot of mystery to solve.”
The coffee machine makes a gargling noise as it starts to brew in earnest. Adam puts his plate and silverware in the sink, folding up the sleeves of his Goodwill shirt before twisting the tap. It’s almost soothing, rubbing at spots of syrup with the sponge. He does the other plates, too, and the lone mug with blue flowers. Instead of loading up the dishwasher, he grabs a dishtowel from the counter and starts drying. He can feel Kevin watching him.
He ends up on the Wisconsin border with ten dollars in cash, which was all Scott could spare. Five of those dollars gets spent on a gas station lunch, and the last five is used to (lamely, he’ll admit) try to bribe a trucker to take him out of the city.
Sam rolled down the passenger window and stuck his head out of the car, effectively muting the radio. Dean groaned and rolled his eyes but he didn’t do anything. At least they were driving through a field and not a forest so he wouldn’t get his head knocked off by a stray branch. There was nothing he could say that would pry Sam out of his shell at the moment, so he’d just have to wait until he got bored in about twenty minutes. He reached over to his right and nudged the volume control with his finger so he could hear the opening riff to “Paradise City” over the wind.
Michael squints in the half-light and combs through the memory like it’s so many pieces of shattered glass.
of them, since I’m assuming you don’t have the big-ass handprint scar, but resurrections are rare enough that I thought someone would have come sniffing around by now.”
He seems like a good kid. Enough that, given everything else wiped from his brain, he’s seemingly hard-wired to
“Look, can you just tell me what’s going on?” he snaps. “Everyone keeps beating around the bush about what happened to me. And what’s
He rubs at the dark shadows under his eyes in an attempt to restore some circulation, then leaves the rest stop with two large coffees and a bunch of granola bars for the road. The late autumn air is freezing on his damp face and wakes him up like a slap to both cheeks. The poor dinged-up Camry is sitting in the parking space where he left it, with lots of concealed weapons and one kid with a wiped brain. Wild to admit that Adam is chronologically older than him, and should be around, oh, thirty by now. He still looks and acts like a teenager, though, for all the world.
Sam folded his hands over his face so that the heels of his hands met over his mouth, and made an incredible farting noise.
Mom-not-Mom strokes his hair as Joe-Barton-not-really takes a deep pull from his arm. He’s crying. And everywhere the smell of vomit and blood and antiseptic.
The sky is blue and the air is cold and biting. His feet move independent of his thoughts. It’s like he’s been transported back to high school and he’s just a sixteen-year-old kid with a knack for biology.
Three years where everything was right, and the world didn’t need saving, and that had been enough to – to what. He didn’t hear anything from Dean for weeks at a time except for voicemails, didn’t see him except once every few months. Held him when he died, after he died, took three days for him to get up the courage to give him a hunter’s send-off. Unlike last time (and before that and before that and before that). And he didn’t – want him back this time.
“Some arcane ritual. Put some blood on a bone and stabbed their boss in the neck. He exploded, and it was over just like that.”
“Small towns like these don’t change too much from year to year. Might not show too much.” David turns to her. “Maybe we should get him one of those Columbus papers.”
Michael wants to tag him back with a retort (he may be an amnesiac who woke up naked in the woods and got hit by a soccer mom driving a minivan, but he’s not a child) but the apparent exhaustion on Kevin’s face makes him think twice about it. They both feel like shit. Who cares why he’s helping? What else is there to do?
Adam shrugs. “I – I miss my mom,” he says, half-laughing because it sounds so childish, but somehow getting closer and closer to actually crying.
Bit by bit, the feeling recedes, like waves on the shore, and then they vanish entirely. Michael heaves in a huge breath and manages to get his legs under him, leaning on the counter as he splashes his face with water from the sink tap. He shakes his head to clear the last remnants of fog, and realizes he has no idea what the hell is going on.
He offered Cas a beer and, to his surprise, he took it, palming the cap off as Sam sat across from him at the dinner table.
“I’m fine, actually,” Michael wheezes, pushing himself up from the asphalt on his elbows. He really is. Not a skin cell out of place. Well, there are still some scrapes and probably some bruises, but all of the serious stuff has been put neatly back into place. It’s kind of messed up, actually. “I really am. It’s okay.”
He takes a look through the hotel window. Looks like they’re in a small town or suburb. Across from the hotel parking lot is a general store and a couple of restaurants. Chipotle, McD’s, Wendy’s, a T.G.I. Friday’s. Office fronts. Another parking garage.
The sunset colors the sky gold and blue and purple, sets the clouds aflame, throws silver dust into the oncoming night. The last beams light up the field when the ring dissipates outward with a dull boom, like a gunshot in the distance, and the daytime star grows brighter and brighter until it sends a pillar of light lancing down to the earth. Dean shields his eyes and hangs on to the boulder for dear life as it sends a shockwave through the clearing on impact. It doesn’t help. He’s rattled around and then flung from the top like a die in a cup. Luckily he isn’t that far from the ground, but it’s enough to knock the wind out of him for a few minutes. He tries to sit up, brushing bits of sticks and leaves off of his hair and face, and stands up, coughing. Where the light struck the earth is a smoking crater.
Val thinks Michael has gone into shock by the time Martha turns around and puts a plate of chocolate chip cookies between them, pouring three glasses of milk.
All right then. “I don’t know what your problem is, dude. Is it so hard to believe that a guy gets taken to the ER after getting hit by a minivan?”
Martha doesn’t seem in the least bit perturbed by any of this, not even that a strange boy showed up on her doorstep in a stolen outfit with no memory. It’s possibly even the opposite. She is… well, perhaps not
Cas is silent, but he can tell that he’s angry. He’s been in Jimmy Novak’s body for so long that he’s become fluent in human expressions and can’t turn it off – the clenched jaw and the slightly narrowed eyes. If this was just any guy in a bar, he’d be trying to disarm him with some buddy-buddy talk before socking him in the jaw, but it’s Cas and he’s drunk and he doesn’t
The silence in the car is deafening. Whatever he found out couldn’t have been good, or at least not mostly good. Michael tries to focus on the buildings they pass, to see if they trigger any new memories. They don’t. Eventually, Kevin pulls up in front of a place with a hand-painted signboard that says
The response is immediate and deafening. Castiel’s true voice sounds like bells ringing inside of bells, turning in on themselves. He shoves his fingers into his ears and grits his teeth until it’s over, then reaches up and touches one of the rings.
The duffel is gone. The money in his coat is gone. He’s still got the two scraps of paper in his pocket, but he can’t get up. Too tired. Pain deep in his muscles. Can’t get up, can’t call. His right lung flutters with each breath, like a wind sock. Almost feels like the knife is still in him, twisting.
“Yes,” Martha admits. “But she lived to a ripe old age, so I think it couldn’t hurt. Just a little family tradition to help him along.”
Adam puts his beer down and wipes his hand on his jeans, then shrugs and says, “And that’s it? We just wait?”
“I have nightmares about Hell, I think. Sam’s usually there, but not always. And… Saint Michael, apparently.”
“Good to meet you, Valerie. I’m on a delivery, so I can’t guarantee that I can keep him here for too long. But you’re welcome to try to get some sense out of him, if you like.”
He read that in a book, once, although the when and where elude him, as usual. And near the lake, there are benches. He trots down a gentle slope and sits down on one of them, rubbing at his ankles and wrists. Even in the moonlight, he can see his breath puffing out in white clouds. The lake is dark and quiet. No birds swimming at this time of night, and probably not in this season.
“I’m Michael.” They shake hands as she sits down, smoothing her skirt beneath her. He shakes his head. “Look, about the shirt, I’m sorry, I really am…”
The coffee machine gurgles to life and begins to cough up black coffee into a glass carafe. David comes downstairs a few minutes later, greeting both of them gruffly and turning the stove on for eggs. She puts a few slices of bread in the toaster and watches Michael yawn for the fifth time. It must have been a terrible dream to give him such determination in staying awake. Light is just beginning to creep through the curtains, now, and he has a very long way to go.
Castiel nods gravely. “The spiritual essence of them. I have been able to safely neutralize and contain his memories, but it was difficult, and he still remembers everything that happened. He simply doesn’t suffer the other effects.”
“Hey, Susie, can I take that table?” she says quietly, catching the other waitress’s arm. Susie wrinkles her brow questioningly. “I’ll explain later. Just take my next table. It’s important, I promise.”
Dean,” Castiel says testily. “I think we’re all much better acquainted with the gravity of our circumstances now. Anyway, we would have to summon one of the more highly-ranked demons—”
He turns to her suddenly, face creased with worry. “You’re not going to turn me in to the police?” When she shakes her head, he twists his hands around the handle of the rake. “I mean, I appreciate it, but I guess I don’t understand. I could be a murderer or something.”
Michael looks at them for a long moment until it clicks, and then he sighs, swinging his legs over the side of the bed and wiping sweat off of his forehead. “I… I don’t know.”
A chill runs down his spine. No, probably not. The feeling of his guts getting pulled out like a chain of scarves says it was impossible for him to survive. And yet here he is. “You think she could have been brought back to life?”
Officer Barton calls him to tell him that his mom is missing. He’s automatically terrified and Daisy Murphy, who is in his gen chem class and also studying with him right now for a quiz, calms him down a little bit by forcing him to sit down and tell her what’s going on. About fifteen minutes later she walks him to the parking lot near his dorm, tells him not to do anything stupid on the road, and waves goodbye as he tears out of Wisconsin and west toward Minnesota.
things. Like, you know your mom, and you probably know your dad. Maybe you have some kind of a – a sense for where you guys lived.”
Despite how small and cramped the pullout is, and despite Kevin’s droning snore, once his head hits the spare pillow, Michael is blessedly out like a light.
The both of them head back inside, and, true to his word, the victim(?) is out of the operation room in forty-three minutes (he’s been staring at the clock on the waiting room wall, bored out of his skull). Soon after that, Barry and Kevin get to visit the patient, and only Kevin returns while Barry elects to stay with his anesthetized daughter for the night. They say some quiet goodbyes before Kevin collects Michael with a quick nod, and then they’re pulling into the hotel parking lot and heading up to his second-floor room.
