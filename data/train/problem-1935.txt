"I could tell. You've been sneaking glances at me all afternoon."
And call on Mary Morstan they did. They went to a small piece of land that had on its plot a home much more elegant than that of Molly's home or her parents'. John drank in the surroundings, eyes flickering over the lovely still-life paintings that adorned the walls. He was rather shocked by just how widely different Molly's life was in comparison to this "friend" of hers.
Finally, they made it to the marketplace. Jane was expecting that Sherlock was going to browse one of the shops or stalls but instead he merely sat on a bench and watched people as they went by. Jane found it peculiar and she sat down next to him, watching the people for a few minutes before her curiosity became too much for her to bare.
His mind went blank in that moment as he stared back at all of his comrades who were in the middle of an intense battle while he stood there with a blank expression on his face as if he were at the cinema watching a war documentary with a disconnected haze. Shock, his mind supplies blankly as the world fell out from under him. He fell and the world around him faded to black.
(See the end of the chapter for
child,” Jane added, slowly running a hand over her stomach. Up until this point, she had been trying not to get attached but saying those words unleashed a flood a love for the child growing inside her. How could she not love the baby, knowing how beautifully impossible it was?
As expected, Molly's presence in the household staff brought the house to life for Jane. Her limp had managed to, except for on bad days, disappear once again. Molly didn't ask about it. Sherlock was never home so she knew the limp wasn't something he'd done. Even in the absence of Christmas decorations, six months later, Jane was always in a good mood when Molly was around. Six months since Christmas, Jane could hardly believe it but she'd been there for more than a year now. And other than having a frequently absent husband, it had been a wonderful change in her life.
"I can't believe you did this for me..." Jane mumbled, slowly hugging back.
The halls were painted light blue, with molding across the rim of the ceiling. Potted plants and a sofa sat in a room with a table and a fully-stocked bookshelf. It looked picturesque with the sun peaking through the windows to illuminate the room.
"Is a Duke allowed to marry out of his status?" Jane asked seriously, not wanting to be the voice of reason, but knowing that someone had to be in this case.
"Have a good night's rest, Mr. Holmes."
"If he even shows. Moriarty says he's been quite reclusive since I vanished..."
“It smells delicious!” She replied back with a sweet smile. “Thank you again, Ms. Hooper.”
"Not particularly."
"What are you doing?"
Jane sat at a table on the lawn lightly set for afternoon tea, quill in hand as her children ran about the garden chasing one another. It was a perfect, sunny, springtime afternoon; one reserved for family. Sherlock was sitting across from her, legs stretched out under the table as he indulged the subtle contact of their brushing ankles. He had a book poised in his hands, but curiosity as to whatever his wife was thoughtfully writing would catch him every time he turned a page. He dare not disturb her. It was rare to see her so concentrated. In fact, he mused that the last time he had seen her so narrowly attentive to anything was the day she had stitched his arm up. There was some amusement to be found in the fact that she made the same face during surgery as she did, scribbling away on that piece of parchment.
"Not now, Sherlock. I need some tea with rosemary. I know it's odd, but it will help her." she ordered and he narrowed his eyes before rushing to the kitchen.
"You really are." she countered, laughter dying down. Slowly, her hand reached for his member, starting to stroke him slowly.
"I'm not following. What does this have to do with you?"
"I haven't been recently and I'm certain you wouldn't find documentation of my four year education there, but yes." She said, guiding his good arm over her shoulder and starting to slowly lead him back to Reichenbach Manor.
"No, of course not. That wouldn't help you at all. I merely sprained it. It will be fine in four to six days depending on how much you use it." Jane dismissed, batting her hand with a small chuckle. She lifted her skirts a bit to adjust the multiple layers of fabric as she crouched down to examine his foot.
When he reached the edge of the forest he halted, trying to think of the best way to look presentable. He was wearing a white tank top under his button up shirt and decided that would probably be the most natural thing to wear since it was hanging to his mid thighs instead of his hips like it should. He stripped himself of everything except the tank top and continued walking into town. The looks he got from people weren't encouraging, not that they had room to judge him when they were dressed so strangely. What was with their clothes?
"So, a wedding tomorrow. Can we really pull that off?"
"I will lead." Sherlock assured, offering his arm to her. "The only one likely to judge you for it will be Mycroft and it's been a while since I watched my mother try to beat him with a shoe. It could prove to be fun." Jane reluctantly took Sherlock's arm and followed as he lead her to the ballroom. His touches were light as he gently guided her into the starting stance. Musicians scrambled in through a side door and started to play.
Jane braved her greatest fear that the owner of the hand wouldn’t be Sherlock at all, that reality would flood in and she’d wake up and realize that the last four years of her life had been a dream, and turned to look. Sherlock was indeed standing before her, trying to hide the fear in his eyes of what she would do or say.
"It's Doctor... Watson..." Even his last name felt foreign on his tongue. Hell, his voice sounded wrong, felt wrong.
"J-Jane!" he moaned her name loudly, fingers seeking out her hair. The sensation was unfamiliar to him and yet he found himself enjoying it completely. "I... oh, god!"
"Does this have to do with helping you?"
"Ms. Watson, you're looking as lovely as ever." Jim greeted, smirking at her. "Red is definitely your color."
"Well, Sherlock is more than welcome to stay as long as you need." Amanda promised stepping closer and giving the man a hug. This was very surprising to John. She didn't hug anyone but him and Harry. The man hugged her back and it looked like he was doing everything in his power to keep from crying.
Murray gave a shaky nod, and John carefully scooped the limp man into his arms with a determined grunt. Bill was quite a bit bigger than him in every regard and so every step was a battle in itself as he forced himself forward to the medical tent with his dying best friend in his arms.
"Don't you, I don’t know, hate me?"
John didn’t really believe in ghosts. He held it with the same level of skepticism as he did magic and fortune telling. Still, whatever that voice had actually been unnerved him and he decided that though he had intended to wait until morning, he should wander the woods that he had chosen as his final destination.
"Jane."
"If there's anything I can do for you, anything at all, just let me know, dear." the old woman said sweetly, offering Jane a smile that she only reserved for Sherlock usually.
"Don't worry about it, Jane. I'm sure you'll know soon enough." Molly had a mischievous smirk on her face and Jane blushed and threw a pillow at her friend.
"You would rather be doing the dishes than reading with me?"
Soon he grew more confident and the noises he elicited from her were moans, rather than simple hums. He shifted until he was settled between her legs and slowly pressed inside of her. The pleasant sensation through them both off guard but not nearly as much as the moan that left Sherlock as he buried himself in her warmth.
"Wow?” Sherlock asked, bewildered. “ What on earth does 'wow' mean?"
"Twenty months from now."
"Ironic. Since we'll be married soon." Jane mused.
Jane paused, swallowing thickly. She slowly looked over her shoulder at Sherlock who had obviously stood from his chair, the book that had been in his lap, indelicately displayed on the floor by his foot.
"She died in childbirth, then?" Jane inferred, raising an eyebrow as she learned more about the man she had come to see at her door so frequently.
"Halt! Moriarty wins." The man mediating the duel shouted, rushing between them to stop any further swings that might happen.
"I was just doing the decent thing, Ms. Morstan." Mary's brow furrowed.
With a sigh of resignation, he pulled up his trousers and walked to the town, a blush creeping over his features and tinting the edges of his ears. How humiliating!
"And would it be dull if I just went back the way I came and left you here to fend for yourself?" she asked, deriving quite a bit of delight from the image of this prick of a man fighting off wolves rather poorly without her aid. She wasn't that cruel, but it was funny to imagine, nonetheless. This man was by far the rudest acquaintance she had ever had the displeasure of knowing.
"Normally it would pose quite the issue, but since Mr. Lestrade inherited his title from his wife, may she rest in peace, he isn't bound by the rules of royalty. It's mostly out of respect that he has the title and land that he keeps, but he does such a good job running our little village that he's able to keep his title and everything that comes with it."
"That's a great relief," she said sincerely, daring to look into his eyes. They were distant, cold, and just a little hurt. God, the way she had unintentionally left him pained her.
"Jane, I'm..."
"He didn't get away completely unscathed either. I'm sure he's still cradling the family jewels." Jane answered, swallowing thickly and fighting off tears. "I've never been sexually harassed before..."
"I... got you something too." Sherlock's eyebrows quirked upwards and he stared at her in disbelief.
"Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey." Jane cooed with a giant smirk, fingers shifting to prod at his ribs. Sherlock shot up out of bed quickly, glaring at her. She giggled. "Ha! Tickle spot!"
"Very well, you may continue reading until you find something more fascinating." Sherlock gave an amused chuckle. Jane turned the page as if to egg him on. A fiery glint appeared in Sherlock's eyes, though Jane could not see it as she focused on her book. She felt his weight come off her legs and she smirked.
"Alright then, let's go." he agreed, and they started running off to a tree house in the distance.
With another disapproving shake of his head, John wiped any stray butter from his lips with a napkin. He shoved his hand into his pocket, pulled out a couple pounds, and left them near his empty plate to pay for the meal before limping his way out onto the street.
“Erm… Is that scar from today..?” He asked finally, gesturing to the patch of flesh that clearly stuck out on her shoulder.
"Yes, and you need to be since we're going out." Sherlock chuckled, grabbing her usual undergarments and helping her put them on while she adjusted to being awake this early.
"John!" Queen Amanda of Summerdale called sweetly. "Come, sweetheart, we have some very important guests coming today and I need you by my side to greet them."
"May I?" he asked, lifting up the letter. "I'm curious what you wrote." Jane nodded.
"I learned at King's College in London." Jane stated, standing up and once again straightening out her dress before offering her hand to him. "I recommend putting all of your weight on your good foot when I pull you up."
He broke the kiss after a moment, panting softly as he looked her over from head to toe.
The words sent a jolt of excitement through her. Finally, something exciting, she could tell by the urgency in his voice. Was he in danger? God, she'd give anything to fight off a wolf or something with a stick. Anything to break the tedium that came with manners, and etiquette, and the dull day-to-day life she had somehow grown accustomed to.
"In that case, try to pay attention to when you start to feel sick and when you don't, and eat when you don't," she instructed and Molly nodded to show that she understood. "Also, your last physician was probably not aware that exercising daily can make the birthing process easier. Just don't overwork yourself and it will be fine. Walks daily should suffice. The fresh air will help you with any mood swings because you'll be in better spirits."
“You’re very welcome.” Ms. Hooper replied with a grin.
“I wouldn’t normally say this, but the ‘fun version,’ please.” He requested and the woman nodded, holding out her hands.
"Wow. That's... You're going to leave again?"

"To make up for my appalling behavior last time we saw each other and to give as genuine an apology as I am capable of."
"I wasn't, admittedly. I just... did not wish to witness that horrific display of his disregard for your opinions." Jane sighed softly, biting her lip.
"You are lovely." he murmured, starting to gently massage her back.
He clambered over to the piano, sat down, cracked his knuckles, and started playing what one would kindly describe as badly, and in a voice that made nails on a chalkboard seem pleasant, began to sing. It was an excruciating performance but manners bound everyone in the room to pay attention to it.
"No! He's far from being my type." she shuddered at the thought. Jane had experimented with her sexuality during her old life at uni as John Watson with mixed results. She wasn't opposed to dating men, exactly, but it certainly wasn't an experience she'd go out of her way to repeat again, new genitalia or no.
“Oh, good morning, Ms. Watson.” Molly greeted as Jane stepped out of the bedroom. “I was just about to come fetch you. Breakfast is ready.”
"Um... without your help, this will be the third." Sherlock admitted, fiddling with his hands. Jane realized he'd been doing it the entire conversation and had only now noticed. He never really played about with his hands when they spent that first week together. It was a strange thing to pick up on, but it just felt... off.
He wasn’t quite ready to believe that fortune telling and ghosts were real, but maybe he could swallow enough of his pride to admit some magic existed in the world, and he had somehow ended up in the middle of a bit of it.
"My office?" Jane blinked as Moriarty sat down across from her.
"Stay with me, Holmes. I need you to remain conscious." Jane murmured, trying to maintain eye contact with him.
"Of course, Jane." Mary agreed, draping Jane's curls in such a way that no one would be able to tell the scar was there and pinned it in such a way that she could turn her head but the hair wouldn't move.
"Well, it's just a weird memory I have that I'd forgotten about popped up in my mind when you said that and it got me wondering if there's more truth to that statement than either of us realize." she confessed, brushing his hair out of his face with her fingers.
Jane nodded as she processed it all. "So because he was not born into the royal family, he can marry who he wants. How long has he been a widower?"
"You're so shy, it's cute." she giggled, climbing out of bed and fetching a dressing gown from her dresser, but not before bending over to show off her arse. Sherlock's face was bright red. "I'm not sure you're allowed to be this shy after being so commandeering last night, Holmes."
"Hello, Jane. Has Sherlock made you aware of the stakes of this duel?"
“It’s a lot to take in and it sounds like a load of nonsense, I know…” Jane agreed, wishing she had the courage to dare to reach for his hand.
"Dr. Watson." He greeted, offering her a glass of champagne that he'd scooped up for her during his determined trek to her.
She had never once anticipated marriage after the way things ended in Afghanistan. No one would want a washed up 'war hero' with depression. Then again, Sherlock never really saw that side of her. Jane's life had changed so drastically in the last few months that it was almost difficult to imagine that she'd been the shell of John Watson less than half a year ago. She wasn't completely content, but somehow Sherlock entering her life in the last week had managed to eliminate any last qualms she had about this situation.
Moriarty ushered her inside but soon disappeared in the crowd to get an early start at finding Jane’s husband in the large estate. All eyes fell on her for two reasons: firstly, it was probably the most unusual sight to see a man’s former wife at an engagement celebration to his newest fiancee, and secondly, while everyone around her was also dressed in expensive clothes, it was quite obvious that Jane’s dress was a cut above the normal standard set for this evening.
"My mistake." She said in the most even tone she could manage, though she could hardly put focus towards the novel she'd been reading. It became ten times harder when she felt his warm breath just inches away from her already excited pussy. "Are you doing what I think you're about do?"
"I want us to be married as soon as possible. I had in mind this Sunday."
"You've had a trying day. Try to get some rest."
"Jane is fine, Mr. Lestrade." Jane gave him a sympathetic smile and he nodded after sharing a glance at Molly as if asking permission.
Jane was making her way over to Reichenbach Manor for the next day's work. She expected it to be quiet when she entered the estate. And at first it was. She was quietly closing the door behind her when she heard a calm and collected voice behind her; a voice she hadn't anticipated hearing ever again.
"Jane, you have become the most important person in my life since then. I never used to care what anyone thought of me, and I still particularly don't, but you are the exception. Your smile has become the staple of my day, your laugh, my greatest desire... your voice, my source of inspiration, and your touch has become something so important to me that I feel like I'm suffocating if I'm apart from you for too long." His thumb brushed against her wedding band and a gentle, reminiscent smile appeared on his lips. "I was so sure that stories of love and romance had it wrong, that it was a trick of the mind or perhaps just how infatuation worked at first, that those things wouldn't last, but I was wrong. This is so much more than infatuation, I've known you were different from the very first moment that I saw you and to call it infatuation would be an insult to what I feel for you... Jane, nine days from now, is our wedding anniversary and yet, I cannot think of a better time than now to tell you how I feel..." The sun started peeking over the treetops, making the fog glow gold. "Jane Holmes, with all that I am I love you, ardently."
"So funny I forgot to laugh." Jane grumbled, rubbing the sleep from her eyes, and letting out a small yawn. Sherlock smiled softly, digging a straw spill out from the bedside table and poking the dim embers in the fireplace until the tip caught fire before lighting the candles by the bed. "You're dressed."
“Why are you here, Dr. Watson?” he asked coldly, not particularly in the mood to play social games with anyone, let alone the woman who had ripped his heart out. Jane winced at her old name. What would she give to be called Mrs. Holmes by him again? To be called Jane at a time where he wasn’t surprised to see her?
Jane thought for sure that the chaos of the day before would be the last time she'd ever see Sherlock Holmes, which had her feeling relieved. She didn't want to imagine the consequences if Holmes suddenly decided that he didn't want to cover for her anymore.
"I'm being completely sincere. If you don't believe me that's fine, it will heal fine on its own either way. However, you're going to have to help me get you home as I don't have a clue where you live."
The first sight that Jane woke up to was a snoozing Sherlock cuddled against her with one arm affectionately draped over her middle. A little over a year ago, she would've been incredibly startled to be in this position with any man, and yet, she couldn't be more content. She gently caressed his rather messy set of curls and he let out a quiet groan, snuggling ever closer to her.
“I… um… well… I suppose…” The tailor seemed a little shocked but she nodded her head despite her moral dilemma.
"The burns hurt?" Sherlock asked, obviously concerned. It was funny, actually. Jane couldn't recall a time that she had seen Sherlock concerned about anything.
"He told me he loved me, Harry... For the first time, he said it and everything just felt so right..." John was crying again, wiping the tears from his cheeks with a shaky breath.
"Damn your detestably smart brain." Jane grumbled, sighing and getting up to open the door, but not without first grabbing a pillow to hug to her chest.
“How so?”
I also have a tumblr and on both platforms, I let people know I've updated so please feel free to check out either or both:
Part of the reason that it took me so long to pump out this last chapter is due to the fact that BlanchLemur asked me if she could translate my story into her native language, an exceptionally flattering honor I never expected. I wanted to proofread as much of my fic as possible so that she would have a smoother time translating it. It took me quite a while to proofread everything, tweaking parts I was unsatisfied with in the process. But it took even longer when my computer gave out officially in November. Before that, I had thought it had died in June.
The day passed in a flurry as Molly bustled around him, leaving for a time on occasion to tend to the horses before coming back to check on her shell-shocked guest. She wouldn’t bother him much, only glancing his way while she was cleaning as if she would be able to read his secrets if she stared at him long enough.
“Molly’s outside with someone who wants to see you,” Greg says, still curled around the doorframe like he doesn’t quite want to step inside. “We thought we’d bring her, she was pretty persistent... If that’s okay, John?”
Never has Sherlock been so happy to be proven wrong, as John climbs back onto the bed beside him, offering out his hand. Wordlessly he takes the pills, swallowing them with the glass of water handed to him. As the chemicals break down in his blood, Sherlock watches John take off his own shirt and trousers, dropping them both carelessly over the edge of the bed without a second thought.
“I just meant –”
He doesn’t though, just leans back slightly into John’s fingers as he pushes them to thread through the curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck. They’re losing sight of their purpose now, John’s breath loud in his ear as he seemingly searches Sherlock’s skin for a reason to stop.
John’s stood outside their front door, Rosie shoving her nose into the snowdrops flanking either side. His incredulous look is met with warm smiles and a low chuckle from the senior Mr Holmes. Evidently, Sherlock going on a hike is nothing unusual. Except John’s never seen him go more than a couple of miles without hailing a taxi, and the thought of the man in walking boots and a raincoat is truly baffling.
Of course, Sherlock can see it. Scribed across his face in helpful subtitles. Both hands slip from the hair at the back of John’s head to cup his cheek and jaw, beckoning him away from the path his lips have been making. John allows himself to be pulled away, hovers there, looking down at Sherlock with only centimetres between them, their eyes level and so close they’re almost blurry. When they focus, he finds some of his own anxiety reflected in the lines on Sherlock’s forehead. Concern and understanding and nerves too, all painted there on the canvas of a face he knows so well. As Sherlock kisses him softly John attempts to still his heart, takes a long steadying breath when their foreheads meet and press together.
Sherlock waits for the realisation to dawn, as John takes in the room around him, noting the binds on the wall behind them and the lack of any meaningful light source.
Fuck it.
It looks safe and familiar, and something in John’s gut kicks.
Rosie is smiling from ear to ear, clearly chuffed that her gift has been received so well. John wonders for a moment if her present has a secondary motivation. It’s no secret they have missed having his daughter around, the constant bustle of a child in the house a learning curve they both grew to enjoy and become dependant on. Soon she will be off to university, and if Rosie gets her first choice across the Scottish border, there will be miles and miles between them, not just a moderate drive up the motorway.
John wants to kiss him, but when he glances at Sherlock again the man is fast asleep. He can feel his chest rising and falling beneath the blanket, quiet exhales.
John watches the booze travel down Sherlock’s throat, slower this time, and wonders how many bottles he’s been through in his absence, if he needs to search every corner of the flat for crueller vices.
Sherlock’s hands are steady again now, so he moves slow and gentle in the fragile air, presses them both to the damage at the back of John’s ribs. All he wants to do is heal. Heal his skin, heal his wounds, heal the frail life they share.
Perfect. What a brilliant way to be spending a Saturday evening, confronting every possible nightmarish fear in the tiny space of a makeshift coffin. John reaches up again just to double check and yeah, they’re in a bloody box. Hopes raised momentarily, he pats himself down, anticipating the feel of a phone. Except his jacket isn’t on his shoulders anymore, and the spare burner he’s been keeping in his trouser pocket isn’t there.
“I really hope those security cameras don’t actually feed to Downing Street” John says absentmindedly, noticing a small blinking light in the corner of the ceiling.
“Comfortable?” Sherlock ventures, eyes glued to the storyline he’s now invested in. “Now be quiet and stop moving”
Sherlock huffs a laugh and then kisses him, leisurely and sweetly. John smiles against it, placing small presses of his lips to the corners of the man’s mouth.
John cuts himself off, scrubs hands across his face and through his hair. The greys are startling in the dull of the kitchen. Sherlock wants to smooth them out and say he’s sorry, but he doesn’t know what for. Here they are again, trapped in an infinite loop of hurt, their pressure points both naked and wanting in the artificial light. John sighs and it isn’t just a release of air, but a valve on the pressure building between them, forfeiting the game. He turns and places both hands on the kitchen table, bowing his head in defeat.
“To feel something” John whispers. “I just wanted to feel something”
to me”
“When it comes to you, yeah” He agrees, following Sherlock out of the tub and taking an offered towel, blissfully warmed from the radiator.
“Not yet, no”
– trapped within walls that speak of past hurts. Except, that pain isn’t quite there, somehow. All John had felt when he’d let his daughter wander into the cottage her mother once visited was warmth, a reassurance that he had long ago been a good man, had made the effort at least, to make things right. Mary isn’t there anymore. She is part of him, part of Rosie and will always be, but John finds he has control now. Only conjures her spirit when he needs it, and often does not.
“He’s doing better, Doctor Greyson thinks he should be able to come home in a few days”
“Are you okay?” He asks Sherlock, cheeks flushed and eyes so wanton that Sherlock doesn’t believe he could stop, even if asked.
Mrs Hudson’s lights are off when he finally opens the door. It’s only then Sherlock realises the hour. Somehow it’s gone eleven, despite leaving Ella’s office just after eight. Vaguely he wonders why his phone hasn’t lit up with texts from John, who normally flips his lid if he’s so much as an hour late from anywhere nowadays. The vulnerability of their relationship is sometimes all too apparent, even now. Secure but frayed at the edges, one sharp tug could begin the unravelling.
Sherlock chuckles quietly, their arms brushing against each other as he reaches for some item of clothing to clean himself, handing it to John wordlessly to do the same. There should probably be some kind of talk now, John thinks. Regular people would definitely need to clarify a few things, check everything is sound after wanking each other off on a four poster bed in a mansion frequented by a relative and a possibly undead butler.
The string of cute but ultimately functionless lights seems to have ended, and suddenly everything is a bit dimmer than it was a couple of minutes ago. Less Christmas cheer land and more murdering psychopath playground. John’s sure he’s seen a film with this plotline, following the one character that always splits off from the group and gets killed first by their own idiocy.
It’s not quite morning, but some indistinct place; John’s shirt still smells almost-deceased, the duct tape residue tacky-sticky on the buttons when he presses his fingers to them. There’s still a decidedly elastic air thrumming between them. Sharing a cab back to Baker Street as per usual after a crime scene has done nothing to improve the mood, or the normality. Maybe because John’s limbs echo with the shakes, and Sherlock’s left thigh is pressed stone close to his own in the back of the cab, unmoving - but more probably, it’s because this time they actually
“Yes” He replies through gritted teeth, trying his best to keep sarcasm at bay in an attempt not to prolong the inevitable.
Partially blind, John props himself up on his elbows, the torch now at a safe distance behind Sherlock’s outstretched frame.
“I’m not losing you again” John says plainly, swallowing as he meets Sherlock’s eyes.
“…so this scorpion comes along, and Orion plays with it because he fears nothing, absolutely nothing, until it kills him, beats him at his own game -“
The tile squeaks as Sherlock flattens his hand against it, trying to find purchase while John’s palm works around him. Those eyes are still closed so John moves closer, kisses his sternum and neck and face and lips, Sherlock’s mouth open and wet as their tongues slide together. John feels his own cock, trapped between them, brush Sherlock’s thigh, achingly close to the hand hanging limp there.
And now – finally toeing off his shoes and socks and flexing bare toes against the rug – he can taste the bile rising in his throat again.
John watches and doesn’t know what to say. Cannot remember what he wanted, back when he was the one crumbling slowly from the inside out.
They stand there for a moment, John looking over Sherlock’s shoulder at some undetermined point in space, with one hand gripping the edge of the kitchen table to steady himself. Sherlock waits until the tendons in his hand stop jumping before he takes a few steps and begins to sterilise the wounds.
“I’m sorry, John, I –“ Sherlock pauses, unsure as to what he actually is.
John says, begins to circle his way round the table and deliberately keeps his gaze from the papers because he frankly doesn’t care, couldn’t give a toss what case Sherlock’s been pretending to solve and more so for the fear of seeing Mary’s name there, in black and white deceit. He’s so engrossed in his own careful footsteps and guarded avoidance that he doesn’t hear the laptop snap shut, or a chair pull out, or any extraneous noise, until the smell of peat and strength catches his attention and there’s a tumbler of whisky in his hand.
John’s not even being dramatic. Well, perhaps a little. It’s been snowing since they got here early this morning, flakes of it already coming down when they were unceremoniously dragged from Baker Street and bundled into one of Mycroft’s cars. The roads will be pretty treacherous now, but surely they have snow ploughs in Chichester, or at least some grit. There must be some way they can get back home, even if it’s by train. John’s certain of it. And if not, he’ll go out there and carve a path back to 221B, one shovel at a time.
For a moment John wonders why he didn’t bring a suitcase of clothes with him. It seems stupid, actually, that he didn’t. Mary is alone in their bed but for the growing person inside her. John’s taken his wallet, keys and even turned off his alarm and he has no intention, he realises now, of going back there. Perhaps this would be easier with the right props to hand, a safety blanket of belongings and comforts that serve no purpose.
it still doesn’t sound right, as if his body is shutting down slowly from the inside out so silently that no one else notices.
Wine red gently ebbs from the tiny wound and he watches it, the slow purposeful path it makes down the ridges of the wrinkles in his flesh. He blinks and suddenly feels that nausea again, like he’s breathing backwards and the world is moving too fast beneath his feet. Like a quick fast rush of air all his choices pass before him and he falters, senses the sea sick feeling that this one little decision could mean so much. Yet how can it, this insignificant post-it note, a dead tree shredded and pressed, dyed a sickening neon. But then, how could it not,
“Do you need another?” Sherlock asks, raising a brow to the empty vessel in John’s hand.
He must look it, too, because John’s eyes grow concerned. Suddenly there’s a hand pulling at his own, the firm grip of John’s palm tugging him through the throng of dancers, until they reach a more secluded area at the edge of the room. They’re near the toilets now but it’s absolutely preferable, far away enough from the large speakers that Sherlock can hear his own thoughts again and doesn’t have to flinch at every unwanted touch from the strangers around them.
“Yes?” Sherlock asks, hovers behind him, connects them by the flat of his palm all the way to John’s arm chair, and it’s not really a question for him so he doesn’t answer it; slips down into the plush seat and doesn’t let out his breath until Sherlock reluctantly breaks contact, flicks the kettle on with no purpose whatsoever.
“I can’t ever forgive her, for nearly taking away the one person who means-“
John wets his bottom lip and finds his own breathing struggling now, the oxygen getting trapped somewhere in his sternum as he fights the dwindling atmosphere and his own wavering resolve. Sherlock’s thumb has stopped its idle path across the back of his hand, fingers barely there as he huffs what could be a laugh, if it wasn’t painted with sadness.
, Sherlock” It’s all he can whisper, tumbles out of his mouth like the words have forgotten to arrange themselves properly, everything is melding into one and John feels himself, tipping blindly towards space.
“Yes, your majesty”
Relief floods John’s face and swiftly turns to mild annoyance, despite the smile upturning his mouth. He shakes his head and wets his bottom lip, breathing sharply through his nose as he shoots Sherlock murderous eyes.
Rosie follows as if she’s already forgotten her father exists, the promise of sugar and the tempting presence of a mother figure too good to resist. John throws on the coat and it absolutely swamps him, but it is efficiently warm.
“Just hold on, Sherlock”
He opens his mouth but Sherlock cuts in, closes fingers around John’s wrist and takes his clenched fist from the table, holds it just there in front of them and John can feel his own blood beating, jumping in his veins against Sherlock’s grip.
Just as he’s about to venture into the fridge, Sherlock notices a soft beam of light coming from under the bathroom door. It flickers, unmistakably candlelight.
The scratchy emergency blankets they were both wrapped in six hours ago were not nearly enough to remove the chill of well water entirely. John shivers, standing there in the quiet living room. Watches without comment, as Sherlock begins to light a fire, still wearing his coat.
It’s not like they haven’t slept in the same room before. In fact, they’ve fallen asleep on the sofa together more than once recently, passed out after a case with Rosie between them, only the early morning light rousing John enough to move. They share space and touch without thinking on a daily basis more and more, yet this feels different. This is a four poster bed with ridiculous drapery and dangerous darkness and Sherlock, his shirt collar open and curls straying over his forehead in the phone’s bright glow.
“You really are – “ John bites back a moan as Sherlock smears pre-come over his head and begins to move his hand purposefully slowly. “–
Sherlock doesn’t believe it will be, the inability to move his upper body more than a few inches is already pooling heat in his belly. There’s nothing for him to do, here. No role he needs to fulfil or mission he has to complete, nothing to fight against except the tension gathering in his own body. Sherlock doesn’t have to solve any problems, save anyone or make any life changing decisions, choose whether to make someone feel better or worse – all authority has been stripped from him, and all that is left, is John.
, but he holds his tongue. The concept of leaving his dead wife’s house is fragile still, how can it not be. There are memories in those rooms that Sherlock is not privy to, and a couple he wishes he could forget.
“Your lip,” John starts, noticing the cut splitting sensitive flesh.
There’s no question he means to follow Sherlock. Whatever the potential outcome, he’s not about to leave him alone again, out in the cold expanse of misery waiting for John to find his moral compass. This time he doesn’t need a well constructed plan to trick him into action. Doesn’t need to think twice before going to save his friend. He will never make that mistake again.
“Mycroft did offer a car, you know” John repeats for the second time, as the taxi hurtles over another speed bump.
“I can’t –“
He spends the night on Molly’s sofa with no explanation, his daughter fast asleep upstairs. In the morning he wakes from no sleep and showers, standing in the hot water for so long that he begins to drift away.
There’s a silence that transcends the stars, and Sherlock is able to read through it, hears the change in John’s voice before it comes forth from his throat, a lengthy swallow of unwavering anguish, and since when did emotions become palpable? Sherlock can hear them drumming a distorted beat in his head, somewhere to the right, a staccato of not quite yet forgiven deeds. For John, now, he is Orion, the foolish game player; and though it’s utterly ridiculous and makes no sense and is in no way even relevant,
There are no words here, only that precious potential, and he collects every second of it, imprints it into his nerves, into his heart - and if Moriarty burns out Sherlock’s then he can have John’s, wholly, already does.
“Am a Doctor” She professes, beaming with pride at her own legible words.
The ghost of smoke on his coat lingers as he reaches for his keys. John will surely notice. His sense of smell seems to increase tenfold every time Sherlock’s resolve bends a little. He wafts his hands in his pockets like wings in the cold air, as if the gesture will help to dissipate his slip up. It does nothing.
In an attempt to push down the anger, Sherlock flips back through the picture book of blemishes and scars he remembers from John's skin, compares any changes there have been since the last time. Most are faded, or coloured purple anew from the force of a booted kick to the stomach.
“I won’t break”
” John starts, rubs a sweaty hand across his face because now Sherlock’s gone so far as to get two cups out, throwing in sugar that John doesn’t take and spilling milk over the rim of the porcelain.
John seems to need audible confirmation this time, circling Sherlock’s wrists with strong hands, but unwilling to bring them further than the mattress above his head without approval. It’s telling that John has managed to read him so well, despite the continents that have stretched between them recently, all the things Sherlock thought he’d kept so well hidden that are apparently common knowledge to the man above him. Every second he was away from Baker Street was spent in a tight knot of self-discipline, commanding dominance over his own wants and needs in order to get the job done. To be able to return, in one piece and as quickly as possible. It had taken too long, and much more fortitude than he had expected to give. The thought of letting go of that resolve, handing it over to John, is more than alluring.
“Little Watson” He smiles, craning his head down as much as he possibly can to take in her wide eyes and pink cheeks.
“Right, come on then children” John says, straightening up with some effort and taking Loki’s lead in his hand. “A feast awaits”
Well, not here exactly. But south of sober, stumbling around Baker Street trying to both keep each other awake and also secretly fall asleep. John can’t find the post-it notes so that one’s out of the window, the memory of the last time they played is almost too traumatic, anyway. Cluedo is a definite no. In fact, he’s not even certain that particular game survived the explosive remodel of the flat last year. Hopefully not.
But they’re still them. People who die and kill for each other, the puckered flesh near Sherlock’s heart says as much. They are recovering, still not wholly right, and yet Sherlock hasn’t shoved him away, is watching him with hooded eyes as John reveals the plane of his chest inch by inch. Bends down to kiss the space below John’s ear that he must know, somehow, makes John want to tear him apart and piece him right back together again.
John looks up suddenly, his mouth about to part and then there’s a loud knock, sharp and unignorable. Whatever was about to spill from John’s tongue gets lost, as Lestrade pushes into the room, peering around the open door unaware of his interruption.
“We only need to overhear where he’s stashed the necklace,” Sherlock explains, voice low enough that passers-by can’t hear him. “From what we know about him, he’s cocky. He’ll probably drink and brag enough to let some details slip”
Sherlock braces himself for the fallout because he hasn’t really had it yet. John punched him, the morning he arose from his empty coffin, and said things that Sherlock never really thought he’d say - (“I wish you hadn’t come back, I don’t want you here anymore”) - but then the metallic rage left, vanished in the breeze of a sigh pressed to his shoulder, a loose arm around his chest and strong, strong fingers curling into his coat. John had been angry about Sherlock’s none-death, his half-life; devastated and broken and sad, but not for long enough, not deep enough or nearly as bad as Sherlock had expected. As he had
Something deep in John twists a little, struggles with the ebbing adrenaline and the building tension in his gut - they’re alive, they’re safe and it’s all fine, really - except there was
“I’m going to kill my mother” Sherlock groans, running a gloved thumb along John’s jawline.
if John is not there to keep it whole, and he can
And it’s easy. Much easier than he thought – because he knows this man, knows what he wants, if he really thinks about it. The same thing John wants. Everything, all at once. To be alive and in pain and in joy all at the same time, to find relief and then know, finally, that he is needed, more than anyone else.
Sherlock flicks an eyebrow up at this news, and John hums in agreement. Despite Rosie’s creative and adventurous nature, she is rarely late.
Only a second of hesitation, and then John accepts the invitation. Presses his mouth, warm and knowing, against Sherlock’s own. John kisses him like he has indeed wanted it all this time, those many months apart only awakening something that laid dormant, waiting for permission to exist. Every sensation Sherlock thought he didn’t want or need crashes over him in one unrelenting wave. John wastes no time, darting his tongue across the wound on his lip and into Sherlock’s mouth, pushing a hand under the hem of his expensive silk shirt. One of them moans and it’s not clear who, maybe both, details seem irrelevant for the first time, as Sherlock feels himself being pushed back against the mattress.
John’s glad he’s still wearing his jacket. The temperature has dropped somewhat from the heated rooms upstairs, the damp tickling slightly at the back of his throat. He takes the bottle from Sherlock as he offers it, struggling to read the label in the dim light.
Sherlock hears the latch of the lock as the three men walk away, leaving them trapped in the dully lit room. Immediately he falls to his knees next to John’s body, frantically checking his pulse and searching for any sign of a more serious injury. Thankfully his head seems fine, likely just knocked out from the impact of concrete against his skull. Sherlock takes in the small room around them. The walls are papered in purple damask, a double bed draped in satin sheets of the same colour sits in the middle, no other furniture but a large chest next to it. He doesn’t need to open the box to know its contents. Judging from the handcuffs hanging from the wall behind the bed, and the ankle restraints at each corner, the room has a very particular use.
Sherlock turns off the faucet and John’s instantly cold again, the absence of plumes of steam and skin against his own is noticeable.
Apparently, that’s all the encouragement the other man requires. Sherlock emits a small needy sound and moves his hand between them, palm squeezing at the muscular flesh of John’s buttocks. His thumb slides tentatively towards that gap between his cheeks, following the line carved there, gently at first and then becoming more insistent, pushing further into it.
What John finds in Sherlock’s eyes, as he finally manages to open them, is indecipherable. They remain that way even as he dances his fingers along Sherlock’s waistband and flicks open the buttons there. John draws him out slowly and spits into his palm. Sherlock’s body shakes as if he’s about to tell him to stop, but he doesn’t. He just looks, watches John as he builds up a steady rhythm, deliberately taking his time.
Somehow, John smiles.
He can only manage the first syllable of Sherlock’s name as he lets him leave, weighted down against the sofa by his own immediate regret. The door to the bedroom at the back of the kitchen is slamming before John can even exhale, the harsh catch of the lock making him physically jump.
Nothing can be allowed to ruin that, the extremely thin plastic wrap that holds them together now. Sometimes it twists and stretches, but it’s strong enough to hold out, eventually relaxing back into its original shape. Just tethering them there, connected as they always have been. Most days it feels too good to be true and too painful to be good, all at the same time.
Fingers closing over his own pull Sherlock from his thoughts. With his heart hammering he watches John thread their fingers together atop his own leg, the joining of their hands familiar yet completely different to any time before. This is with intention, with promise, not just a necessary contact but a desired one.
Sherlock follows suit, now distanced enough that his brain can form features on faces rather than just a blur of flushed skin. The outside of the club may have reminded him of Prague, but inside is the complete opposite. Sherlock had spent his time as a ghost in dingy bars filled with cigarette smoke and older men, not writhing twenty year olds and fake clouds of whatever the hell they’re breathing in right now. All at once he feels a bit out of his depth, realising they’re perhaps some of the oldest drinkers in the room. John seems to have come to the same conclusion, downing the rest of his glass in one.
“Get in, you’re letting the heat out” John says, gesturing with his eyebrows to the empty half of the bathtub.
- guilt to spike in Sherlock’s chest, for his pulse not to feel wrong and heavy in his veins.
“Excellent” John tries to breathe, catch his pulse before it swims out of control in the little space around them.
Then John’s fingers are back circling his cock, thumb teasing the head and all thoughts of hurting himself again disappear from Sherlock’s mind. He concentrates everything on the feeling building in the deepest parts of his body, gradually letting go of every bit of tension his muscles have been storing. John kisses Sherlock’s chin and the space below his ear, buries his face into the curls of his hair and works his hand with finesse.
, John thinks. He’s been wrong about so many things, but thankfully his sense of direction still works as it should. John zips up the coat and thanks the elder Holmes again, looking to the sky briefly as a flake of snow falls ominously onto his nose.
“John, he’s heading this way” Sherlock warns, preparing himself for conflict.
“Because I like danger, right?”
“It is what it is” Sherlock says, an echo of everything all at once.
Another few nearly unbearable moments, and Sherlock sees the room blacken and implode, spilling over John’s hand as he finishes with curses on his tongue. When the tremors ease off, Sherlock pushes it into John’s mouth instead, pulling at the man’s bottom lip with his teeth until he gasps and gasps, coming onto Sherlock’s stomach.
Sherlock blows out the candles as they leave the bathroom. He follows John to their bed and climbs in next to him, buries his nose in the other man’s clean hair. He finds as many points of contact to John’s body as he can, content as the gesture is reciprocated. They fall asleep in silence, the small box under the floorboard by the sink not crossing Sherlock’s mind again. The thought of it isn’t tempting anymore, and he realises – finally – that it was never the solution he needed anyway.
Eventually they part and Sherlock leads him by the wrist to his bedroom. John says
“He’s gone on a hike, my dear”
“He became the greatest hunter in the world, but he had a massive ego, boasted he could kill just about anything…”
“John,” Groaned against his ear lobe, through wet shiny lips, somehow managing to produce words like only Sherlock could at such a moment, intelligent even with his cock straining and heavy.
Sherlock takes another stuttering breath through his nose, and John uses the sound of it to locate his position in the smothering darkness. He must be on his back too, also without his coat, John discovers, as he carefully moves his hand blindly along Sherlock’s bicep.
Clearly it’s a strip bar, or at least what Sherlock imagines such a place would look like, modelled after something from the 1920s. It’s not a large room by any means, but there are two small circular platforms in the middle, each showcasing a half-naked male dancer, muscles shining in the low light. Crescent moon shaped booths line the walls, most of them taken, waiters carrying trays of whisky and champagne to their occupants. It’s quiet enough in here to perceive the shaky inhale of John’s breath, the music sensual and at a much more manageable volume than it had been in the main club.
at all.
Even if John were brave enough to slow it down he couldn’t. Sherlock is like a vast still lake, inky black and inexplicable, a body of deep waters that John’s disturbed with his lips and hands, gentle surface ripples turning to violent waves and now there’s no stopping it - a tsunami of pent up desire that John can do nothing but swim in, swim swim swim until his arms give in and he drowns from the pull of it on his lungs and heart.
“Am a Doctor” She repeats, her tone more serious, face set in determination this time.
More days and more boxes go by, but Sherlock doesn’t push. If he does, then John might just fall right back into the well of misery he’s been methodically crawling out of, one brick at a time. They’ve come so far, and it’s taken so long, that Sherlock’s just grateful for progress.
Sherlock settles for tracing tiny circles on the space above John’s knee, moving the barest amount to distract himself, until he is able to fall asleep again.
- such a brutal connection between the celestial and himself. They haven’t talked about it enough, yet, for the unfounded -
John offers a small smile, most of it lost in the darkness. It certainly would have been preferable to be with his daughter right now, reading her bedtime stories as she falls asleep in his arms. However, John finds his frustration at their current situation has lessened somewhat. Despite the guilt of not being there for Rosie, he’s managed to spend an entire evening in Sherlock’s company without ruining anything, just enjoying being alone together for a few hours. And if his chest feels uncomfortably tight sometimes, the tension of anxiety biting his veins, well that’s just too bad. He’ll put up with it, force himself to ride the tornado of doubt in his head until it settles into calmer skies.
“She’s seen worse”
“Scotland Yard caught up to him eventually” John clears his throat, eyes dropping to his own crossed arms.
John lets Sherlock guide them out of the bustle of pines, somehow finding their original path with ease. They head back, the stars bright in the clear sky above them. It’s almost sickeningly romantic, the definition of Christmas. Oh –
“You’re hurt,” He starts, turning over onto his side in the small square of space he has available. “Where?”
He picks up Sherlock’s gloves from the snow and hands them back to him. For a whisper of a second he thinks about kissing him again, running his tongue along that cupids bow one last time. Better not, though.
“You’re an
“Jesus fucking Christ,” John responds, immediately reaching for the button on his jeans and shoving his hand into his boxers.
“Okay?” Sherlock murmurs into his hair, slickened thumb rubbing tiny circles over John’s hole.
“Should probably get some sleep” John drops his gaze, arms tightening around his own chest as regret tugs at his gut.
” Sherlock finishes, purposefully stressing the last four words.
Well, that’s alright then, isn’t it. John rolls his eyes at the darkness, those words not entirely reassuring but at least good enough to make him forget about the potential charge for indecent exposure. Sometimes Sherlock’s ability to make ridiculous calculations in his head comes in useful. He rolls his hips back in encouragement as Sherlock’s fingers hover over his cock, wordlessly waiting for consent before they wrap around him.
“I’d better get an Oscar for this,” John smiles, attempting to catch Sherlock’s eye. “Or at least a BAFTA”
Really John can’t be blamed for questioning it, even as Sherlock’s touch reaches his thigh. As much as the doctor has defended his heterosexuality over the years, Sherlock has proclaimed to be uninterested in any affection just as ardently. But his fingers are still travelling along John’s jeans, his palm smoothing flat against denim.
For a moment Sherlock thinks he may actually protest, but instead John wets his bottom lip and looks at him, blank.
It’s not purely the shock of John’s suggestion that causes a shiver to crawl down his spine, but also the dark pools of the man’s pupils, large caverns so tempting that Sherlock would agree to almost anything. They remind him of the enticing possibility that had been there at Baker Street – only here, in this room, they’re allowed to explore it, closed off in this entirely different world, away from prying eyes and any sense of normality.
“Greg brought you grapes” John states flatly, as if he doesn’t know what else to say.
Words die in Sherlock’s mouth as John’s lips meet his jaw, barely there yet full of intention, travelling along the sharp of his chin. He tries to speak again but the mouth pressing below his ear now is too consuming, becoming more purposeful as John kisses a line down the tendon of his throat, fingers once again weaving into his hair.
“Hmm” John confirms, flicking his gaze across Sherlock’s no doubt tired looking face. “Should ask you the same thing”
Rough stone threatens holes in the back of his shirt, the cold of it steady and grounding as hands press him back harder.
John Watson and his daughter are sitting in 221B so Sherlock can’t practice this ritual, and he isn’t even sure if that square of space just to the right of the sink is empty or not anymore. It’s been so long since he last checked, months in fact, and he can hardly remember the shine of the silver or the weight of it in his hands.
Sherlock hears his own breathing speed up as if it doesn’t belong to him, the needy noises coming from his mouth foreign. He catches John’s eyes as they seek out his own, and that’s enough, the peak breaks over him in a sudden rush of euphoria.

"Can I look?" You said going around the table to his side, he moved and you looked, it was glowing a brilliant golden and moving around alot, that was in your new feathers? Beep beep, the electronic kettle startled you, Sherlock got up and poured himself a cup,
"Huh, I never thought I could amaze the great Sherlock Holmes." You said, still grinning.
WARNING :  VIOLENT CONTENT AHEAD YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
"Tea?" He asked you.
"Wow." Said John
I'm sorry to say this, but most people who read this story saw this coming. I'm going to discontinue this series. It wasn't really going anywhere plot wise and it just sort of fell apart, I got discouraged and unmotivated and I had been going through a sort of depressive state. Again I am really sorry for those who have been looking forward to a new chapter, but I just can't finish this. I hope to to write other stories on here though. Thank you for reading.
"You're here for recovery, your injuries are not bad enough that you need a hospital, and we have a doctor right here," Sherlock said as he gestured to John. "You're going to want to stay here for awhile, you hit your head when you fell to the concrete, not enough for a concussion but enough to make you nauseous if you move too quickly." He said talking really fast but slow enough for you to understand him. You assumed he didn't know you were injected with something when fighting that guy.The pain in your shoulders got worse, it felt like something was pulling at your skin, you had to bite down on your lip to stop from screaming as you vision started to get blurry.
"Hey! What do you think you're doing?"
"(Y/N) could I take a feather from one of your wings? I'd like to do some testing on it." He said casually.
"I wonder if you can fly with those?" Said John jokingly while pointing at your wings. Realization hit you like a bag of bricks, you have wings, which means you can fly, your hopes got up, you could fly, you can fulfill man's biggest dream.
"H-hello?" You said trying to sound casual but failed miserably, another man walked into the room he was shorter and was wearing a jumper, he had bags under his eyes like he's seen a lot of bad things.
"(Y/n), we are going to have to cut your skin, okay?" John said breathlessly, your muffled screams were reduced to loud sobs, you nodded. Sherlock was dumbfounded, he had never seen anything like this, "Sherlock, go get a sharp knife." Said John snapping Sherlock out of his mesmerized state,
"The eye balls, as you already know would combust in the microwave, and I timed it to about 2 minutes and 45 seconds, but if you microwave it before that time and then quickly put it in a cold area then you get a melted eye ball, hello john, and..." and he just went on and on and you listened to every word of it.
"Thanks sherlock." You said, your words dripping with sarcasm. "I would still like to try though, it would be a fun experiment." You said.
"Oh, you were awake?" Said Sherlock while still concentrating on his work. John didn't answer because he was busy with getting up and learning how to little coffee machine worked.
"Oh please John, she would get frightened sooner or later, what with being in a strangershow house and all," the man who you assumed was called Sherlock said while turning to John.
"Oh! S-sorry!" You said cursing yourself for stuttering. "I didn't know someone else was here!" You said. You saw a face come out of the darkness illuminated by the soft glow of nearby street lamp.
You all went back to the hotel, you currently sleeping in one one the beds, and Sherlock was in the other in his mind palace and John was reading a book that he always meant to read but never found the time. Speaking of time, it was close to eleven, and if he wanted to enjoy this experiment/vacation, he was going to need some sleep. You're in one bed with your wings spread out, so no sleeping there, but Sherlock was on the other bed, taking up a small space.
I am sssoooooo sorry I haven't updated in 15 million years, but I had just been in a lot of drama because my house has burnt down and my mom was injured, but she's fine now, but now I hope that I can find time to write more of this story! And sorry for how short this is too! And also, thank you all who gave kudos to me! It's actually what motivated me to write more!
After a little while you guys picked a location that was in the middle of nowhere somewhere in whales. It took a long time to get there though, you had to hide your wings in a large back pack to keep people from seeing them and you had to travel by boat, (it was less expensive and not a whole lot of people were there anyway). After you three got to the old hotel you were staying at you decided before the sun goes down that you should go to the private field.
"John I am perfectly fine with sharing a bed with you if that is what you're asking." Said Sherlock bluntly. John didn't really have a response, had he not been so tired he would have denied the whole thing, but he just wanted to sleep, so he got ready for bed. He crawled into bed, Sherlock was still under the covers in his mind palace, so everything was fine. John turned out the light and fell asleep.
"Alright. Let's pick a location." Said Sherlock getting up.
"How is that possible?" Asked John.
You had just lost your flat, you didn't have a part time job, and you can't get a hold of your family. Life at that moment sucked. You had been wandering the streets of London finding small ally ways and sleeping on a flat cardboard box for a week now, and you had no hope of finding a job with your shabby clothes, so it was unlikely that things would get better.
"Juss, take one, and let me sleep." You said half awake. Sherlock plucked one of your feathers and put it under the microscope.
"Uh, yes please, two sugars." You said to him still baffled by his discovery. He brought over the two cups and handed one to you, then you sat down in your original chair.
"So you're sleeping there then?"
Again it took a million years, but, thanks for sticking with me! Im hoping that things will get better, and thanks for the kudos, it really means a lot to me!
"Not very likely, no." He said back.
"The feather is glowing." Said John
"Oh, uh, o-okay" you said nervously, you walked over to him and he got up
"Not likely, unless your bones are hollow there is no chance in you flying, along with the wing span, your wings would need to be at least twice the size of your body to catch enough wind to lift you off the ground." Sherlock said.
"A-alright then, um I'm (y/n), why am I here?" You said while sitting up on the sofa, and noticing pain on your shoulders that you thought wasn't gonna go away any time soon.
"Now I need to figure out what this is." Said Sherlock, getting back to work.
You were in a bad part of London, you had picked up a shard of glass to use as a knife and a piece of cloth to keep you from cutting yourself if you were ever to use it. You were lost in thought and bumped shoulders with a tall man in a black trench coat.
"(Y/n), I need one of your feathers." He said softly to you.
John woke up, got dressed and went downstairs to have himself a fresh cup of tea. As he came downstairs he heard Sherlock talking a mile a minute, and then he heard your voice showing that you understand what he was saying. He went into the kitchen to see you and sherlock sitting across from each other and having a very interesting conversation.
"So what did you 'get'" John said sitting down in a chair next to Sherlock.
"sorry" you quietly said as you kept walking, silence from him. You turned to look back and saw that he had a friend who was a lot shorter than him, and the shorter one was quietly scolding the tall one for not saying sorry.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sherlock? Sherlock, are you going to be up all night?"  He asked Sherlock.
An Angel Gets her wings
"Yeah, you can tell?" You said sarcastically. He started to look confused.
"Uh-huh." You said to him once sherlock stopped. There was a pause of silence while john drank his tea and you drank your 3rd cup.
"Good morning to you too." Said John sarcastically.
"It feels soo good to stretch my wings!" You said taking off the back pack. Sherlock and John decided to go with you, they just wanted to see what happens. You stated flapping your wings with all your might, and you felt yourself going up slightly, you stopped, and decided that if you could do that while just standing then if you took a running start then you could get off the ground. You went to the far end of the field and started running as fast as you could, once you reached your top speed you started flapping your wings as hard as you could, you felt the ground fall beneath your feet, the air got colder, you looked down you could just barely see their faces of shock. You felt amazing, the wind rushing through your hair, the freedom to stretch and use your wings, like you were born to do this. You glided through the air, purposely not flapping your wings so you could land on the ground again. You landed, not too gracefully but you landed, and walked over to Sherlock and John with a stupid grin on your face.
"I got it!" Sherlock said, it was slightly muffled because his face was smashed into John's chest. Sherlock let go of John and jumped out of bed, he went to his bag and rummaged through it, he eventually pulled out a microscope and set it on the table, he proceeded to walk over to (Y/n) and started waking her up.
....................................................................................................................
You tried to lay down on the bed, your back bandaged and sore along with your throat from the screaming, or trying not to scream. You were in Sherlock's room, John was helping you to bed, as a good doctor like him self does, he told you to lay on your stomach while your back was healing then told you that he was going to get you some pain medication. So there you were waiting and comprehending what had just happened, big black wings had just sprouted from your back after you were attacked and taken to a strangers house, things were moving so quickly, you started to get headache, your thoughts were interrupted by John walking into the room and setting down a glass of water and some pills
“So be gentle then, Doctor”
, I know” Sherlock smirks and looks up at him, the twinkle in his eye nothing to do with the glass of wine on the counter, and everything to do with the pride reflected on John’s face.
He tries to keep the hours of a normal human being as much as he can, re-arranging the duvet softly over John’s sleeping body and closing the door gently behind him when he can’t. When he’s still hunched over the kitchen table in the early hours, Sherlock discovers a cooked breakfast in front of him and John’s sure lips on his cheek. In return for these kind moments, Sherlock makes more tea than he ever has in his life and tries to touch John whenever he can. He finds himself unable to stop. Even the need to shut himself away for hours inside the decadent walls of his mind palace is outweighed, replaced instead by watching John write up their cases on his laptop, his feet resting in Sherlock’s lap.
Those words take Sherlock over the edge, spilling onto John’s hand and stomach, cursing silently. The slick feeling of it against John’s skin is warm and filthy, and he lets his fingers slip away to grip the bedsheet instead, taking pressure off his other wrist and allowing him to thrust quicker into Sherlock’s palm. When Sherlock opens his eyes again, John watches his gaze fall to his own fingers around John’s cock, observing the movement of skin and the slick of come smeared across sparse chest hair. Then, those blue greens drag upwards and John loses it as they meet there, caught in inky blown pupils as his moans rough out across Sherlock’s face.
“Yeah, completely dead” John replies, in answer to Sherlock’s questioning eyebrow. “Not even sure it has a torch function, to be honest”
“You little –“
, Sherlock relives, as he closes his eyes and waits for the inevitable.
If Sherlock feels the same, he doesn’t show it. Turns on the shower faucet and steps back towards him, smooths hands up and along John’s biceps and to his face again. Then they’re kissing. John is melting, quickly disintegrating into Sherlock’s touch. The sure placement of his palms and the meeting of their hips as closeness becomes inevitable, the ease at which Sherlock moulds into him like he isn’t fearful at all. As if he has been the rock all this time, and John has just been clinging on like wave battered seaweed, nothing without the strength of the man pressed against him.
John swallows and means to take a step back but instead the electric pulls him closer, a foot or so and he’s back in the confusing orbit of Sherlock’s presence, back where he belongs and where he never should have left.
Eventually, as falling leaves turn to bare branches and white out skies, the tape catches and things start playing again.
The four of them stay for a while longer, Sherlock mostly just listening to the idle chat as Rosie fusses with the edges of his bedsheet. An hour passes by somehow and Sherlock only realises his eyes are closing when John suddenly rises, ushering the other three out of the door with a whisper.
“You saved me, in here” Sherlock reaches two fingers to press at his own forehead, the movement straining muscles that should not hurt so much. “For the third time”
“So, you didn’t actually solve the case then?” Greg says, a bit too smugly.
Sentiment, the old version of himself would say. Sherlock doesn’t pull away from it anymore.
Greg picks up on the same clues, but thankfully they don’t seem to lead anywhere in his head. Sherlock explains the events of the evening to the both of them using as little actual information as he can, handing over the business card and watching the blush threatening to creep across John’s cheeks. When he’s finished they share a small smile, neither the inspector or his brother willing to question it.
Without invitation, Sherlock pushes it open. John lies in the bath, head back against the tiles with his eyes closed and his grey hair slicked back. Tiny droplets of water roll down the walls, the steam instantly overwhelming.
John makes a small sound in the back of his throat, obviously clearing it of something he would regret saying. Sherlock watches as he carefully folds the paper back in two, places it on the side table next to his tea, and stands. Somehow, John appears tall despite the height difference, chin lifted and never-ending eyes set on Sherlock’s own as he takes a short stride towards him. Oxygen constricts for a moment in Sherlock’s lungs and he almost jumps when John reaches to circle his left wrist, tugging it gently so he falls forwards a step. He's caught off guard as fingertips begin to trail across his bare skin, whispering along his forearm.
Potential, is thrilling.
Then everything is bright. Too empty, as Sherlock peels away from him, tugging up the zip of John’s jeans before his own. The safety of his coat disappears, and all is numb.
, John thinks,
“Sherlock, how –“
Sherlock can’t help the guttural noise that comes from his mouth, completely undone by John’s honest confessions. He tugs at his wrists again, letting out sharp rough breaths as the hard edges of the cuffs dig pleasurably into his skin. The line between pain and satisfaction becomes blurry, the sight of John pleasing himself only intensifying the uncomfortable throb of his own cock.
Porn abound, but for good reason ;)
“You forgave
Something still lingers there in the middle of them, but Sherlock can now take Rosie from her father’s arms without anxiety seizing his entire body. John even makes them food now and again too and smiles when Sherlock pulls faces at his daughter across the table. Cases become more frequent finally, and they see more of Molly. They get calls from Greg and he even shows up a couple of times. It’s all becoming easier and settled - and it’s all fine except when it isn’t - but that’s okay, for now.
So, John gives that to him. Lets his other hand fall to the round of Sherlock’s arse, digs his nails in until Sherlock hisses, goes faster and firmer along the length of his cock until he feels him quivering and then stops – holds Sherlock’s gaze as his eyes fly open and he gasps, the look on his face wicked and disbelieving and caught somewhere John wishes he could be, always.
when every small breath he’s taken for the past five years has lead him to it?
“I need to sleep” Sherlock says, the husk of his tone confirming the statement.
Perhaps the burgeoning worry in his gut is an overreaction. In the past, three days would mean nothing. Sherlock used to be apt at disappearing for over a week at a time, not leaving so much as note. Even in real people terms, not hearing from your friend for a couple of days isn’t exactly unusual. Except, things are different now. They don’t do that to each other anymore. It was a silent agreement made in the back of an ambulance, John still damp with well water and Sherlock still shaking slightly at the edges. Some unspoken pact, fuelled by years of letting each other down.
They breathe together, and with each in and out John finds himself relaxing. Finds his knees have slotted either side of one of Sherlock’s bent legs, the closeness not as awkward or unwelcome as it once would have been.
it) and now he's paying the price, penance for not having the courage to hurt and hurt until Sherlock found it right to come home.
John doesn’t want to falter anymore. Has his nose buried and smelling everything they’ve been through in the last twenty four hours, everything underneath that’s unmistakably Sherlock, the sweet of his skin and woody tones of his shampoo.
“Sherlock needs to be careful at the moment, sweetheart” John explains, brushing the stray blonde hair off her forehead. “But why don’t you give him a magic kiss on the cheek, make him better?”
There’s no use in lying. They’re trapped, definitely a few feet underground John registers finally, the lack of sound a bit of a giveaway. Their only real hope is the slim chance that Sherlock’s fingers were quick enough on his keyboard and the signal was strong enough to penetrate the warehouse walls. They’ll run out of air soon, too. He’s no expert but the tightness in his own chest predicts they have maybe a couple of hours, depending on how long they’ve already been here for. He doesn’t ask for clarification on that, the shallowness of the breaths coming from Sherlock tell him enough. The man must be in agony, the stab wound likely one of many injuries.
The periods of silence are almost creepier than the slight rustling he can hear. Almost. For a moment John regrets getting out of the habit of taking his gun everywhere, just the weight of it would be comforting. As that thought occurs to him, the ominous noise gets louder and closer, the direction indeterminable in the acoustic oddness of tightly packed trees.
For a second there’s a flicker of sadness, the vein beside John’s left eye jumps and his nostrils flare momentarily. Then the soldier is back, and he snatches his wrists out of Sherlock’s grip. Purses his lips, and nods as the wave of conflicting emotions tide over his face.
“That was… Unexpected” He admits, lips turning into a smile.
Something sad blooms across Sherlock’s face, and John isn’t sure why. Wets his bottom lip and reaches out fingers to Sherlock’s elbow.
So John does, describing the ins and outs of David Jason’s character, eyes watering at Sherlock’s slightly inebriated attempts at Cockney Rhyming Slang. At some point he’s slouched down and toed his shoes off, crammed into the corner of the couch by Sherlock sitting at the other end, long legs stretched between them. The heels of his feet press into John’s thigh and he’s reminded of the same touch all those years ago, days before his wedding. He clears his throat and shifts a little, attempting to dislodge the pressure. All it does however, is make Sherlock slump down further in his seat, placing his ankles over John’s knee and into his lap.
“They’re too far away” Sherlock concludes, willing himself to move from John’s grasp.
Somehow Sherlock is radiating warmth, though John’s sure he’s probably cold. Those hands are usually ice, cool to the touch even in the summer months. He looks comfortable there, stretched out the length of the bed, one arm under his head, regarding John with contemplative eyes.
Holds on, even though his insides are shaking. Even though his bottom lip is too, as he tests it gently to Sherlock’s. Does what he couldn’t do last time, but wanted to. Slides their noses together and parts his mouth, steals air from the pliant man beneath him. Sherlock – who is still and open, somehow allowing John to do this, break through to something else, on the edge of more. And he keeps going, the barest of touches, trying not to be consumed by the gravity pulling him down, almost over the line but not quite – until he feels his knees give way.
A little inconvenient, though not unexpected. Sherlock hadn’t managed to conceal any weapons on his person either, opting for similarly body emphasising dress. The slim cut black trousers he’s wearing are far too revealing, and it’s so damn warm outside, neither of them could get away with pretending to need a jacket all night. Sherlock isn’t wearing a t-shirt though. The silk shirt he has on is wine red and breathable and more expensive than John’s entire wardrobe.
Whatever mess was about to come next is silenced by Sherlock’s mouth again. Slower, claiming each word and folding them away back into the recesses of John’s mind, where they can take care of them another time. Not now, while there’s just the right cocktail of agony and need to keep going, and exhaustion enough to let them both relent to something that’s always been there.
Cuddling under blankets isn’t on John’s list of things he thought he’d ever do with Sherlock, but the inviting blurriness of sleep on his smile is too hard to resist. John nudges his shins with a bat of his hand and Sherlock shifts, making room for him in the vacant seat. The plush sofa is much comfier than the second hand bed of rocks they have at Baker Street, and John sinks into it. Sherlock swings his legs back and into John’s lap. This time, John doesn’t keep his arm at the safe distance of the backrest. Instead, he rests a hand on Sherlock’s thigh and the other on his shin, marvelling at the sudden ease of it.
When he’s standing in an air field not saying any of the things he wants to, John wonders how many times he’s supposed to let Sherlock leave him before he’s allowed to give up. Before he’s allowed to move into Sherlock’s heart completely, sit there in his old chair and close the doors behind him.
Oh, he hasn’t been this needing ever, not once - and it rolls through him like a first breath, shatters any illusions he might still have that this isn’t right; that he hasn’t always needed Sherlock and always will, somehow, in some way, like this, yes yes yes,
Something wet warms John’s cheek and he brushes it away, blinks it back as Sherlock continues to search in the darkness for more thoughts, moving pictures that neither of them will ever truly know are real or not.
“Oh –“ John suddenly starts, yanking the bottle from Sherlock’s hand with little grace. “What the hell is the deal with Stanley?”
Part of John feels like he can’t stop. If he does, maybe this all goes away and becomes another trick of the light. Perhaps this never actually was, and he did fall asleep, a corpse on the floor at the foot of Sherlock’s bed. He’ll wake up and none of this will have happened, or worse it did and Sherlock regrets it, leaving him cold and more alone than he ever was to begin with. The dread doesn’t creep but rather tides over John in a wash of sudden bitterness, the pollution of those thoughts causing pain in his sternum and forcing his eyes to screw tight shut. Absolutely brilliant time for a panic attack, with his mouth near Sherlock’s navel and his knee pressing against the hardening cock beneath him.
That comprehension in eyes that seldom give anything away is just about too much, and John kind of hates it - not because it's not genuine but because it's the same deep understanding look that Mary had given him two days after Sherlock's return.
Sherlock's hand is cool and smooth, and John imagines that he can feel the calluses on his fingertips against his own fingers. It's not even the length of a breath but it feels like an age that they stand there before Sherlock brings his face up to look at John. With a delightfully pink tinge to his cheeks and another quirk of a smile he withdraws his hand.
“I insist, John,” he murmurs and picks up his hat, clearly herding John towards the door. “Now if you don’t mind, I have things I need to attend to.”
John swallows, prays for some self control and steps closer to the tree again to wrap his arms around Sherlock's thighs, almost getting a posh walking boot in the teeth for his trouble.
“Go and jump in the shower. I’ll bring you in your pyjamas.”
“Sherlock, I love our life here – you and me. I love
John pats the spot beside him, his eyes half on the rugby. Sherlock can’t help but be drawn to the invitation and drops onto the sofa, swivelling immediately to lay his head in John’s lap. He sighs and straightens his legs, stretching his feet out over the end and rolling his head to get the best angle. John’s fingers waste no time in finding and toying with the curl beside Sherlock’s ear that won’t stop sticking out, no matter what he does.
"I was counting on being home in time to surprise you," Sherlock says softly, his voice going low already.
Sherlock Holmes.
has done that has finally brought this period of his life to an end. He’s an idiot for ever thinking that he could hold on to such happiness as he’s felt since John moved in. Of course it could never have been the permanent situation that Sherlock had wished for in his most private thoughts - that’s not for the likes of him. John deserves better than that. He’s remorseful and embarrassed this morning, but at the heart of it, he’s said those words and they cannot be unheard or unsaid.
“To sell?”
John must have done this lots of times - he's very good at it - and any lingering reservations that Sherlock had about kissing being wet, unhygienic and alarming are finally laid to rest. John's mouth is warm and insistent without being demanding, his tongue touches against the centre of Sherlock's lower lip and he cannot help but make a small involuntary sound at the shock and the thrill of it. He practically falls into John's chest in his haste to receive more of his warmth and breath and attention. But John is sturdy, and doesn't give an inch even when Sherlock crowds him with his taller frame.
John looks moved, and Sherlock is surprised to realise that he feels the same; his throat strangely full and his eyes are slightly swimmy.
He falls for it every time and he knows he shouldn't. Sherlock says something infuriating and John reacts. Every. Damn. Time. It's almost Pavlovian. He can't help himself. The man drives him utterly demented when he's like this.
A sudden draught of bitterly air and the bang of the front door closing make John blink almost as if awakening. Sherlock’s footsteps on the stairs send him scurrying into the kitchen, pulling down a plate and a jar of jam to fill his restless, guilty hands.
"Because I want to kiss you and I can't reach," John explains.
"This wasn't the kind of thing that comes up in conversation," Sherlock counters, frowning slightly, and John wants to ruffle his hair and hug him. How can a man who picks up strangers for sex be so reluctant to speak his mind?
Sherlock is watching him, hands in his pockets, snow gathering in his hair and on his shoulders, catching the scattered light and John’s breath. For a moment, he thinks he is going to offer him an arm, but instead, Sherlock gestures him to take the lead and John begins the thousand-mile journey to the front door, up the stairs and into their sitting room. He makes a pretty good go of it, and only accepts Sherlock’s help when the stairs turn on the little landing and he is faced with one more climb before he can collapse.
John manages to grunt an acknowledgement and Sherlock’s embrace slowly loosens but is quickly returned. He has dragged a blanket from the bed and has draped it haphazardly across them both.
Sherlock's music speaks for itself.
John ran.
“I dreamed. Of you,” he whispers.
"You know why."
is it here?”
John swallows, pressing his lips together and tries to look away.
“I hadn’t bargained for anything, John. I’m glad you let me in.”
At one o'clock the doorbell rings and John is on the stairs in seconds but as fast as he is, Mrs Hudson is faster, tricky hip notwithstanding, and she accepts the armful of roses from the courier with a coo of delight. She thanks the driver and closes the door, turning to see John.
Mycroft strikes, snake-like, as if he already knew what John would say. He lifts an eyebrow and asks without missing a beat. “Even if he chooses to settle for less than he wants rather than risk trying for more and finding that he hasn’t earned it?”
They exchange one more round of Merry Christmas wishes and by the time the door clicks shut behind him, Mrs Hudson singing something indistinct from within, John is already half way up the stairs to their flat making Sherlock hurry to catch up. The ache in his groin is sweet and low and not at all unpleasant. John’s behaviour though is perplexing and it is with some trepidation that he follows him up to their flat.
Sherlock took him into his mouth carefully, closing his eyes as if he were savouring the flavour and temperature and texture of him. John’s hand flailed behind him for support and found the edge of the upper bunk to clutch as his other hand took a convulsive fistful of Sherlock’s curls, trying to remind himself not to tug on them too hard.
“Hello? Mr Holmes?” John calls trying to catch up.
John's excellent plan is foiled by his horrifically early rising relatives.
“Sherlock,” John warns, propping an elbow on the arm of his chair and resting his jaw on his fist.
Sherlock counters.
“I just did,” Sherlock protests.
Crispian tips his head to one side. "Plenty of that around here. John says..."
>>><<<
By nine that evening, Sherlock has had enough. After the emotion of this morning and a day of watching John while avoiding being caught doing so, Sherlock wants nothing more than to hide in his darkening bedroom.
Sherlock doesn’t react to that, only asks his next question in the same, level tone, establishing facts and testing theories.
Sherlock walks down the stairs and into the kitchen, making more noise than he needs to, John knows. It makes a ridiculously soft smile break across his face, but he keeps it hidden, facing the door as Sherlock takes the place beside him to inspect the aftermath.
“Are you all right?”
"I wouldn't miss it," John smiles, still scanning the garden for Sherlock as politely as he can. Molly is a good friend and John somehow feels that he has a lot of making up to do for how Sherlock used to spurn her advances - he clearly had no interest in her in that respect, but he had been so blunt about his lack of interest.When it became common knowledge that he and Sherlock were together he had half expected Molly to cool towards him, but she hadn’t and John is grateful for that.
Sherlock looks up at him and wonders at the miracle of John Watson. A chance encounter in a chaotic universe had put them together – provided the answer to each other’s questions, the fulfillment of each other’s shortcomings. The odds against meeting the one person on the planet who can see beyond the persona and recognise his hidden heart despite the deflections and the obstacles are incalculable. For that person to then love him in the same way that he is learning to love John is nothing short of miraculous.
"What? Why didn't you tell me that?" John protests pointlessly.
There’s an odd expression on John’s face - there is anguish and sorrow there, but also an inwardly directed anger, and Sherlock is taken aback enough to answer candidly.
When he opens them, Sherlock is there too, holding out his pyjama bottoms and a t-shirt. John stares at them stupidly.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and sits down in the chair next to John’s, who eyes him with ill-concealed concern.
Oh god!
“Hello! Hope I’m not interrupting anything,” John ventures with a careful smile. Does the man not remember him from only a week ago?
“Mmmm. Fine. Mycroft has sorted everything out, proving that he is useful for something other than eating cake. She’s going to stay with him while father’s here. They’re both delighted by this. We’re just waiting to talk to his doctor, then I was coming home. I should have texted you but my battery…”
“Right,” John snarls then catches sight of exactly what it is that the man is watching.
He’d acted in self-defence, John knew now. Sherlock was Sherlock, and John didn’t want to change him, but that meant accepting the flaws along with the joys, and with Sherlock those came in polar opposites –being ignored or being the sole focus of his considerable attention; being forgotten or being put above all others; there was no middle way with him. John was a quietly confident man, but Sherlock’s mercurial changes of direction had bruised him more than once. Could he endure that variability from a lover?
But this evening feels different - the edges are blurred and his love for this impossible, infuriating man is bleeding into everything they say and do.
Greg looks between them, but answers John. "Yeah, it's a beautiful place they have here. Garden looks amazing. Very kind of you to invite me," this last, said to Mycroft comes off as slightly confused and John realises that Greg, at least, doesn't realise the reason he has been invited to some stranger's anniversary party.
How ironic, he thinks, for all the times he thought that he’d driven John away for good with his oddities, his obsessive personality and his thoughtlessness, that it should be something that
John turns away from the desk and he shakes his head slowly. “I don’t know, but you’re starting to worry me. Maybe whatever that…thing you just described is your subconscious trying to tell you something? You can’t stay cooped up in the flat forever, love.
Even this much was a mistake, he recognises too late. Much too late.
He rises quietly and takes himself to his own room without waking John. On his bedside table is the faded hardback copy of an anthology of Taylor-Coleridge’s work, well cared for but clearly old. It is a familiar weight in his hands and the pages are pleasingly thin and soft between his fingertips as the book falls open to past favourites. John must have put it there when Sherlock came home from the hospital.
With Dr Watson fully focused on him and his recovery, it’s easy to imagine this fragile state in which his hospitalisation is allowing John to cross certain boundaries, might continue. But what if he lets slip something John isn’t ready for, or actively doesn’t want? Sherlock’s always been quick-witted, had an extensive vocabulary, but his language is that of fact and science, not at all suited to expressing sentiment. He has no idea how to put his regard for John into gentle words; he wouldn’t have known even had he been in optimum health. To attempt it now would be foolhardy in the extreme.
“There was no need,” Sherlock murmurs without looking up from his mobile. John’s long past wondering how he does it, but somehow Sherlock knows what John’s been thinking.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hums softly, sipping from his glass. The dark red wine tints his lips for a second before his tongue delicately wipes away any trace of it.
John clears his throat again.
John shakes his head without pausing in his tea ingestion and holds up an imperious finger in a wait or stay gesture, then proceeds to drink half his mug, placing it with precision, back onto the table.
"Good. Great. Glad to hear it," John says trying to keep the irritation and sarcasm out of his voice. He doesn't want to provoke the man further, especially when he is in a mood like this one. He's seen these before and they escalate quickly, often ending in Sherlock sulking and John needing a very long walk.
“Oh, I knew he had a soft spot for you. So when are you seeing him again?”
“Well?” he asks, and at least his voice is admirably calm and dismissive, even if his mind is currently employed in an epic meltdown. He scratches the corner of his mouth with a thumb nail and blinks at John. “If you’re going to ask me about last night, I’m afraid I cannot help you. You were making absolutely no sense whatsoever. Really, John, you were lucky not to be picked up by the police.”
Sherlock is pleased to be discharged after a little under a week later. He’s continually pestered by people coming to measure things, dress things, discuss things and is heartily sick of being on show the whole time. Home sounds indescribably good to him and he counts the minutes from the moment the subject is raised to the moment Mycroft’s car drops them outside the flat. In all that has happened subsequently, he had almost forgotten the explosion that blew in the windows of 221B at the beginning of those fractured days, but John tells him that his brother has seen to the repair of the flat and everything seems to be much as it ever was only tidier and a lot less dusty after his Mycroft’s attentions.
"Nonsense. If you just give me a bunk up, I'll be able to climb onto the bottom branch and reach it easily."
“I thought you said that a cat would be considerably less…”
“So how about you, then? Your sister only told me you’d be arriving on Tuesday or I’d have been in to make the place a bit more welcoming. Of course, they didn’t use the place last year. Such a pity about those two, they seemed so happy.”
"And the beginning of many passionate and long lasting love affairs," Crispian corrects him. "You know, festive high spirits, too much fizz, meeting someone you would never normally have the courage to approach under the mistletoe and the rest is history in the making."
John should have been prepared for this – of course Sherlock would know that his brother had visited.  He runs through the surreal conversation with Mycroft in his head, searching for something truthful but insignificant, but he can tell from the way Sherlock tips his head at John’s hesitation that it would be pointless to deflect. He chooses the least of this morning’s revelations. “To let us know that we’ve missed one of his little toys,” he says finally.
John is left to his thoughts, as erratic and overwhelmed as they are - elation and excitement locked in a struggle to the death with nerves and trepidation. So it’s a good minute before he notices that Sherlock has left his t-shirt beside him on the coffee table, where he cannot fail to see it.
“Coming then?”
He had the head of his cock tucked just out of sight and even though there was room to slide his long, slender hand in there too, it was easy to see every stroke of his fist, every twist of his wrist and every squeeze. He spread his thighs a little more and edged the waistband of John’s fatigues further down, showing a little more of his hips and surely his cock had to spring free then, but however John tipped his head, he couldn’t quite make it out.
“Errr… I’ve forgo’en the question.”
“I disagree...” Sherlock recites, trying to complete their little game.
“Then you’d better assess my performance…very… quietly,” Sherlock replied into John’s ear, tugging him back in against his hips.
"I don't want your forgiveness.” He pauses and pulls in a deep breath. “No, that's not true... I do. I do want you to forgive me but... not now. It's more important to me that I have apologised than to have your forgiveness. That part of the equation isn't in my hands, and I only have control over my own actions not yours. I am sorry for every time I have caused you pain, and now you know that."
"And the baby?"
"And?"
John nods along as Sherlock struggles with words.
The truth is that John hesitates and the reasons are twofold:
John shrugs off the unexpected and unlooked for kindness. He's not that man anymore anyway.
,” he husks.
A warm, sweaty palm alights on his arm. The sensory information is incontrovertible – it cannot be anything else, yet he cannot see the hand. Sherlock raises his arm and looks,
And this is better. Jobs sound good. Something to take his mind off... the thing he's not thinking about.
“Just the coat?” he says, eyebrows arched and an extraordinary expression on his face – humour and seduction and challenge and... Sherlock isn’t even going to try to decipher that.
Why is he justifying his excuses? Why didn't he just say no at the outset? And why in the hell has he asked about John's wife? He doesn't want to know - whatever it is. He doesn't want to hear that she's hugely pregnant and all is rosy in their corner of Nirvana as much as he doesn't want to hear that things are not good between them and all the emotional floodgates that will crack open again.
Chasing the taste of it, John closed his lips over the head of Sherlock’s cock through the material, kissing and sucking gently as his boyfriend’s breath hitched. He drew back again to look at the damp patch he’d made, feeling rather proud that he had only built upon Sherlock’s reaction to him.
John can see that his boyfriend should be with someone as graceful and smart and refined as he is, but Sherlock has never once given any indication that he sees that. He’s never before made John feel inadequate or less, but in all the years they have been together, Sherlock has kept family and John separate. John, being an idiot, thought that was down to Sherlock being averse to family reunions, but now he’s not so sure.
He makes an ambiguous sound, trying not to notice that John has looked quickly away to fiddle with the pile of napkins. They don’t go out together anymore unless it is related to the work. Married men, as a rule, don’t frequent intimate restaurants of an evening with a friend. Not even with friends who they are currently living with and nursing back to health.
He needs to think but has no idea where to start. At a loss for anything else to help, John continues with his day’s routine in a distracted, unsettled fog. Perhaps the commonplace application of soap and water, toothpaste and some clothes will settle him and help him sort out his own feelings from the mess that Mycroft has landed him with.
“I never said thank you.”
"I heard that." Mycroft calls, but doesn't turn away from his conversation.
"Oh... yeah, it's fine. I've been taking on a few extra shifts, covering for colleagues. It's a nice practice and not too far from the flat."
Sherlock hissed, scowled and withdrew his finger sharply.
"Sherlock," he begins and has to stop to clear his throat. "Sherlock, you only asked me to marry you five hours ago and even that felt like too long to wait. And now we have the rest of our lives to look forward to, our first kiss as married men, our first breakfast as husbands, our first Christmas, our first anniversary, our first argument, our first compromise, I’m eager to begin.  As your friend, your assistant, your partner and now as your husband, I am grateful every day for what we have. I love you - I always have and I always will.
"John, " Sherlock says seriously but pauses, and John is grateful.
trousers.
John’s cock, snugged up against Sherlock’s hip, gives a hefty twitch at the sound and Sherlock chuckles.
“It was a spare that the client lent me. Why do you ask?” Sherlock enquired, stopping in his tracks, suddenly alert, his eyes pinning John.
But this isn’t that John.
Writing gives him a level of security he craves; he can read back to himself in his head what he’s saying, and can be more certain that nothing unintended is contained in the message. Connecting words to speech… making sure nothing that comes out of his mouth is a danger to this fragile peace is… too hard.
Wow! So I got it done in a day - it didn't need as much heavy lifting as I recalled. Thank you Lina and 88thParallel for listening to me angst about this story and to you, dear reader for giving this story a go.
Sherlock carefully moves closer, placing his hand on John’s hip. John mirrors him and moves closer too. He’s hardening inside his pyjama trousers and feels that it’s a good bet that Sherlock is in the same state, shifting restlessly as he is on the mattress.
On legs that don’t fail him, even for an instant, John stands.
And, like straws on camels, that is the phrase that breaks the doctor’s back, his remaining, microscopically thin veneer of reason gone with an ill-judged word.
"Please, John, I
“Of course not,” Sherlock agrees just to see John’s pleased little nod, knowing that the likelihood of him still being on this time thread by the time dinner is ready is minimal.
. It’s about him seeing clearly for the first time how very vital John is to him. Fire and brimstone have rained upon them and revealed his priorities, not diminished him – at least not in the way that John thinks. He sees John not as a blogger or an assistant or a flatmate, but as a partner, an object of affection, a loved one. It’s not that Sherlock didn’t know John’s importance in his life, it’s just that he hadn’t recognised the scope of that importance before now, nor had he considered the potential of being courageous enough to accept all of it.
“You were there all along,” Sherlock says and reaches out a hand to John’s face, hesitating momentarily before he brushes a thumb across his bottom lip, sending lightning tendrils of want snaking between John’s legs. He tries to calm himself – this is Sherlock he’s dealing with – he cannot keep up with him intellectually at the best of times – so how can he possibly know what his intentions are in this action?
Two chapters today as they were both short and quick to tidy up. B xxx
John nods, "That's great. Did he teach you to play?"
“Well,” Mme Hudson huffs and looks quite pleased for some reason. “He does produce some lovely honey. He sells it to restaurants and hotels all over France - very sought after it is. Very expensive. You must have made quite the impression on him.”
about this? Sherlock thinks that John is the one being unreasonable for asking him to stay out of the few possessions he has brought to the flat they share?
Life has a way of getting away from you, John thinks. It seems that if he’d stopped to think, at the Landmark, at the hospital, at Leinster Gardens, then he would have stopped events from snowballing, called time on the farce his life had become.
"He was looking for drugs because you were acting up and withholding evidence again - not deliberately searching for things that are personal to you. It's different."
"I think I've primed myself for expecting it to be your hands on me tonight."
, how he hopes - that it wasn't a rebuff, no matter how gently delivered or kindly meant.
“Oh, should I…?” Sherlock gestures toward the bathroom.
"One of the advantages... the only one I can currently bring to mind actually... is that my brother happens to be the British Government, with all that entails. He can start you a small war, give you intel on any number of indiscretions perpetrated by any number of heads of state, rustle up a knighthood, cover up most legal misdemeanours you might need sorting... or he can ensure that our names are on the requisite piece of paper with however much or little regard to tradition as we care to name. In short; name your poison."
This, in itself, is unremarkable but Sherlock has never been able to indulge himself in his current activity before, which is to openly stare at his flatmate
"I'll be there in seven hours," Sherlock grins and the screen goes blank.
"Up," Sherlock says and straightens, turning to John and pointing overhead.
“Hmm?”
Leaving him on the sofa, Sherlock stirs some life into the dormant fire, throws his coat over a chair and clatters off to boil the kettle.
All it had taken in the end was some happy memories, some hints of their connection, a little wine and a little intimacy. John had seemed especially receptive, and the journal had been very effective with its cream pages the colour of Sherlock’s skin and the tactile cover the colour of his hair – John had always had a thing for Sherlock’s curls.
“Well, if you’d taken the time to explain the concept to me earlier than I would have understood. So, since about February perhaps?”
…the love of his life is stirring. He thinks he’s being terribly devious and outwitting poor pedestrian John again.
They step apart hurriedly, neither catching the other’s eye. John has brought the back of his hand to his mouth and Sherlock wishes he could do the same without drawing further attention to their activities. His lips retain the lingering warmth and taste of John Watson, something he has idly considered so many times before firmly pushing such fantasies aside.
The disembodied voices are back, sounding from just outside the door. One of them is John’s, and Sherlock presses his ear flat against the worn wood to listen.
"Feel better?" Sherlock asks, his drawl ever so condescending.
Bridesmaids? Signatures? Vows? Please don't let him have got this wrong, John thinks, or he is about to look like the biggest version of the idiot Sherlock always accuses him of being.
"Whatever you like, just get me to a place to lie down." The man is clearly in some distress. His jolly tone and ready smile have been replaced with tight features and short, panted sentences.
Damn it.
"Sherlock, are there any long tunnels between Edinburgh and here?"
John is about to go and knock on the most likely looking door but out of the corner of his eye he spots movement off to the side of the house. He diverts to follow as a figure disappears around behind a bed planted with something tall and dried out at this time of year. He recognises the battered old straw hat which is all he can now see of the person.
"You don't need to atone - I have already forgiven you. At least half of the blame was mine anyway. My knowledge of interpersonal relationships was insufficient in this instance. I misread..."
John is nodding, but won't meet his eyes to say their goodbyes. Sherlock steps back, taking one more long look at the man he changed the habits of a lifetime for, the one he thought would still be there for him, even after the necessity of making him think he'd taken his own life - ridiculous really, on his part. He and John had made no promises, had never discussed their complex relationship, in fact - not even when that relationship had turned into something more, something physical. Now Sherlock understands, finally and worthlessly, that John never discussed it with him, because to him there was nothing to discuss. John cares for him in his own ways - and one of those ways was to take Sherlock to his bed, to dissolve the very last of his barriers like mist, to teach him with his hands and mouth, to show him all the ways that two men could be together, could please each other.
Sherlock moves back suddenly, his eyes curious and wary as he comes around to stand before John. His lips roll in between his teeth and his smile is tentative when he gestures for him to continue. “Try again,” he suggests.
Sherlock doesn't respond and John shakes his head, "Sorry, sorry. Of course he... I'm sorry."
creep into his cheeks. It always amused Sherlock how mortified he could become over something so “obvious”.
"John, I hope you know that I never considered myself as someone who might marry. For numerous  reasons I thought this would be something that I would never experience and I felt no remorse for that. And then I met you and - well - a lot of things I'd thought outside the realms of possibility, suddenly changed. In you I found that rarest of gifts; a true friend. So you will forgive me if I was slower on the uptake than I should have been because my expectations were already exceeded by quite some magnitude in that friendship. The possibility that your regard might stretch to affection or love seemed so far beyond the realms of probability that I had to consider the possibility that you were delusional when first you made it clear that you found me worthy of your love. It took me some time to understand the extent of my good fortune and no time at all to return the sentiment, once I had understood. You have made me a better person and I will strive every day to be worthy of your love.
Sherlock spots him immediately - new jacket, barely touched tea, has been running his hands through his recently trimmed hair. Clearly nervous. Hasn't been sleeping well, has lost weight and seems to have taken some care over what he has chosen to wear. He hasn't noticed Sherlock yet though - he's looking at the clock, working out how long he should wait - how long it is acceptable to linger before his actions appear pathetic. He swipes his palms over his thighs - a habit of his when he's stressed. It’s interesting, although Sherlock would really rather it wasn't.
When John finally makes it down the stairs, the party is indeed in full swing. There are a decent number of people in the garden and John realises that he doesn't actually know any of them until he spots Greg talking to Mycroft. While Sherlock's brother isn't who he would normally seek out for any reason, Greg is a friend. Besides, if Mycroft is about to become his brother-in-law, he'd better start learning to be more civil to the man.
Sherlock merely smiled, not even bothering to open his eyes.
By the time he returned upstairs, Sherlock’s supper was an empty bowl and a plate of crusts and crumbs, and he was slumped in his chair, toasting his toes in the glow from the fire.
It takes ten minutes for his heartbeat to settle, for his body to accept what his mind already has – that his presence here is allowed. He understands this is kindness and nothing more, but as he shuffles in beside John, the warmth of the duvet reminds him how cold he had felt alone downstairs.
Rolling the scant sip he takes across his tongue before swallowing, John takes a breath.
“So, how did it go yesterday?” she asks, settling herself with a steaming cup and a slice of tarte.
Something wakes him, some vague awareness of change. Maybe it’s the light, maybe it’s the noise from Mrs Hudson’s radio, a distant, unintelligible burble, maybe it’s the chilly nip of the flat now the fire is reduced to cinders and soot.
“Just. Let this happen. Please. Just, let it”
“We may have missed dinner” Sherlock says, avoiding his eyes.
Any way he tries to justify his aching body and greedy hands doesn't make it feel better; every point at which Sherlock touches him (chest to elbow to bicep and shoulder) is painful and delicious and puts more cracks in John's already fractured nature, leylines of trauma that he's sure will be visible afterwards, will mark him out to Mary and Greg and every person in the street as a bad man, a fraud.
But Sherlock is still. Unmoving under his touch, fingers relaxing on the curve of John’s neck. The sound from John’s throat is anguish, burns from his gut into the emptiness around him, alone as his very being splits apart. Desolation blooms and breaks even as John’s hands leave Sherlock’s wound to pinch his nose closed, attempting to undo the damage and trip a restart in the unworkable space. He tries and tries, sharing his remaining recycled breaths, intermittently checking the fading pulse beneath his fingertips.
Like Sherlock’s shin under his palm. Somehow, traitorously just sitting there.
“Well, just about” The man continues, putting the coffee cup clutched in his hand onto the side table.
The distressed gasp from the back of Sherlock’s throat tumbles into John’s mouth unwillingly, vibrating off the backs of his teeth as they kiss. He tries to hold onto him, intwines their fingers tightly in an effort to show John that he is fine, he doesn’t need to stop, he doesn’t care about the bolts of electricity snapping at his tendons. The other man draws back momentarily, breathing heavy against Sherlock’s cheek.

"right." He said running to the kitchen.
You flinched almost screaming, the man was in a chair by the cluttered coffee table by your right arm, leaning so his elbows were to his knees and his hands in a praying-like position, he was observing you.
You opened your eyes slightly, sad that your good dream is over, your back was kinda sore but it was all fine from there, you found a bandage wrapped around your back and your wings and you decided not to take that off sense it was the only thing covering you. You got up shakily sense you were not used to the new weight on your back. You got into a sitting position then stood up glad that you had on socks to cover your feet from the cold. You opened the bed room door and peered around outside, you found a bathroom and decided to go into it, folding your wings so you could fit through the door after finding it extremely painful when you hit the door frame. After you did your business you looked at yourself in the mirror, you had large bags under your eyes and you looked more pale than usual. You decided to go out of the bathroom and maybe find something to do other than staring at yourself. You went into the kitchen and turned on the light sense it was still dark out, you looked at the clock on the microwave 5:14am ugh, you noticed something in the microwave so you opened it which you soon regretted because you found a jar of what looked to be human eyes. Quickly closing and walking away from the microwave you looked at the table, it was filled with lots of test tunes and a microscope and various other things of that sort, 'these people must be scientists or just be insane.' You thought. You walked out of the kitchen and into the living room, the first thing you saw was a soft and comfy looking chair and across from it is a modern looking leather chair, you looked to your left and almost flinched to see a wide awake Sherlock Holmes sitting on the couch reading something from his laptop. You stared at him for a while not sure what to do or say until he looked up from his laptop,
(See the end of the chapter for
"(Y/n), are you okay?" Said John coming toward you with a concerned look on his face. You fell off the sofa almost falling on to the coffee table but Sherlock moved it before you could hit it. You were on your knees, your face low to the ground you felt tears run down your cheeks onto the wood floor, something was under your skin and it wanted out.
"Yes and that is how (Y/n) is able to fly, whatever this stuff on her feathers is, it aids her in flying, despite her wings being to small to lift her." Sherlock said quickly.
It was late and the sun was just about setting when you bumped into the man so you quickly found an ally way that wasn't too wet, looked around for a piece of cardboard, then found one in the darkness, but as soon as you pulled on it you heard I gruff voice say,
"I don't know..." said Sherlock.
"U-um" they both turned toward the sound of your voice " I have some questions... w-who are you?" You said in a small voice.
"Sherlock get cold water, now!" Yelled John as Sherlock ran to the kitchen, John knelt beside you.  "(y/n), (y/n)? What's going on?" Asked John
