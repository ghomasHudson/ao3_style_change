"The Indonesian black chicken. That isn't a cooking method, the feathers, skin, even the meat and organs are all actually the same colour as or darker than my coat. I had a bit of bother getting it. My Javanese is a rather rusty. At first they thought I wanted fish then they thought I wanted noodles. I finally had to show them a picture."
The first time, they were holding each other so close that John didn't get the opportunity to see the magnificence that was an aroused Sherlock Holmes. It was very close to when he was just about to solve a locked room serial murder. In his face, at least. John hadn't any idea if this was what, in some measure, was going on with the rest of his body, the strawberries and cream skin, his scars, old and new, standing out further, his lean muscles taught, his chest expanding and contracting with his breath as he sat there on John, holding his eyes hostage... it was devastating.
"Yeah but... Never mind." George showed mercy then, picking up a file and holding it up in front of him to read so there was an illusion of privacy. Like the confessionals at church, Sherlock could express his feelings without feeling like he was being watched, with a solution in sight. "So what's the problem?" Sherlock sighed and fiddled with the arm of his chair.
Sherlock even tested him, teasing his exposed neck with the tip of his tongue and grinning, being sure to fill his eyes with sex whenever they were facing each other and not touching. It was the only way he could stay in control of himself. Because, not only did John smell like a hot Summer night in a field, all musk and heat and soft earth, he tasted like pure fornication. It was doing Sherlock's head in.
"Did I sell myself? No. Traded sometimes. And sometimes it would just happen under the influence if we were in the mood or someone added an aphrodisiatic element to whatever we were taking."
As part of his character(Sherlock hoped), John warned him to calm down in public or he would be in real trouble. Sherlock of course pushed it, purposely rubbing what he'd been informed by the same 'They' that drove his costume choice, was a rather plush backside deliberately against John's crotch. He was absolutely chastised when John began moving his hips in a slow circle, though still to the beat, clutching at Sherlock's hips so as to keep him anchored in place. Once establishing that Sherlock wasn't to move, he dragged his clever doctor's hands up Sherlock's thighs, barely missing the crotch, up the front of his torso, deliberately not missing his nipples and up the underside of his arms, pulling them up and around the back of his neck. John then set about the sensuous touching and groping of innocent places like his stomach and hips and waist. Sherlock had never been so glad in his life, as he was of the volume and repetitiveness of the music that thoroughly drowned his helpless moans.
"John's so much more subtle, but you're behaving as if you've never been... You haven't, have you? You've never been in love?"
"Someone in the bathroom did ask if we were having a domestic," he pondered, his usual nose bridge wrinkles firmly in place as they were whenever he was thinking extra hard, usually about something he didn't understand. "Probably because I'd wandered into the ladies on accident."
"Right. So I read that children and teen-agers often compare their genitals, and, I have it on good authority that adult men are considered somewhat equivalent, behaviourally speaking." John could only shrug. He wasn't wrong. "So... it comes down to the proverbial, 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours'." That was a bit better. He knew he had nothing to worry about in that department, despite knowing, medically, size had very little to do with the ability to give and receive pleasure. It was just nice to know that he'd never had to experience wondering whether or not he was a good size. Every girl he'd ever been with seemed rather impressed.
"Oi! Get this down you," John directed tossing one of the bottles that surprisingly landed perfectly between the man's knees before downing half of another one in one go. He let the others fall onto the corner of the bed closest to him and began cautiously undressing as he watched Sherlock open his bottle one-handed and take rather dainty sips. He was beginning to suspect that Sherlock may not have been as drunk as he was behaving earlier, but then that wouldn't leave no explanation for the new development in their intimate contact introduced earlier. He re-sheathed his uniform in the garment bag and retrieved a couple paracetamol packets. He took his and removed Sherlock's from the other before having a piss and returning to the bedside.
"Thank you." Sherlock straightened his shirt and cleared his throat, still comically wobbling a little even sitting. John could tell he really wanted to pace as usual but wouldn't be able to concentrate on walking and talking at the same time in this rare moment of what was, for him, un-coordination. "I have one at my left Trapezius muscle. Only the left, coincidentally just where my moles are." He put his fingertips to the spot to indicate what he was talking of. "Other rather normal places, ears, nipples, well, my whole pectoral area, actually. They function much like female breasts in that capacity. Penis of course. One place that may be considered 'odd' by the Western world is the axillary area." It was John's turn to blink for a moment.
As soon as he saw that door however, John figured out what that little scrap of disinclination was. Fear. He found himself mildly terrified that once they'd properly entered their flat, all would be revealed as still a sham, and Sherlock just added the last bit about actually wanting him to make it more real so that John wouldn't give up on it and start pulling away too early. As usual, Sherlock took only the bag he'd kept with him inside the cab(containing the mysterious package), leaving the several others as well as the driver payment to him as he unlocked the door and went in saying something about how Mrs. Hudson wasn't in. John watched him disappear by increments up the first ten steps of the seventeen that led to the sitting room and kitchen doors and he could at first only stand there taking deep breaths.
. Sherlock leaned back as John balanced the computer on his thigh. He then proceeded to watch a Youtube video forwarded to the bit where a massively muscled 'actor', obviously from Southeast Austria, was having issues dealing with a classroom full of small children.
"Fine. Just... adjusting," he retorted in a voice that John felt more than heard. "It's been... a while." The rumble and thud against his chest, the heat of his skin against skin, how he wrapped those long legs tightly about John's hips, it was nearly too much to bear. Until a single roll of his hips drew a high-pitched noise from him that would have been conducive to a bride indeed. Conversely, Sherlock's sound was delicious, sharp, dark and smokey, like scotch mixed with molten chocolate. "You can move now, John," he informed him bossily, but John was trying to make sure he wouldn't immediately fall apart as soon as he did so. It would have been embarrassing. However Sherlock is as Sherlock does and, as he went to protest again, John countered with a slow circle that turned his haughty words to a garbled mess from which only 'I love you' and 'oh god yes' and some sort of swear were discernible.
"My John isn't an adulterous idiot like your ex wife," Sherlock spouted. "Do you honestly think I would even bother if he was even a little similar? Now, will you help me or not, Greg?!" Sherlock nearly shouted, his voice barely contained within the glass walls of the office. The Detective Inspector went very still for some reason.
"That was the first proper kiss you've given me since we got here," Sherlock mentioned. "Normally, we'd be slipping away to snog at every opportunity. I'm sure there's a cupboard or two you wouldn't mind showing me, for old time's sake." It was so odd that they now had a snogging 'norm' and what he came to label as Sherlock's Private Smile surfaced, making him feel a bit more jittery, but in a pleasanter way.  He put his left hand over Sherlock's right as it remained on his face and rubbed the back with his thumb.
"Well of course you were," she said. Of course he was. Probably. "That's practically down the road from us," Margie continued. It was a bit titillating and very slightly disappointing to think, though a few years his junior, he may have come across a young Sherlock Holmes much sooner in life. Maybe even right around the time of that Carl Powers boy. The most trouble he ever got into was defending someone who was getting picked on by beating the bully into the ground, and even that went away since he was very careful to drag the boy just off campus in order to carry out justice. The trust fund wanker's father tried everything to intimidate the school into expelling him, but John had endeared himself to nearly everyone, staff and student alike and got off with a warning. The warning was to take him farther away so no one's time would be wasted again, and punctuated with a secret wink from the head teacher at which he refused to smile outwardly, though his insides were. The boy ended up going to Harrow the next term, and suddenly, if Sherlock was anywhere around at the time, John was sorry to have thrown another potential Sebastian Wilkes into his path. The man had enough trouble as an adult, so it was difficult to imagine the navigation of all of that brain power plus the hormonal tsunami that was the teen years. John may have taken up drugs too, in that situation.
"Hm? Why wouldn't I be?" He could possibly have sounded more offended, but it would have been a difficult task. Used to it, John just smiled warmly.
"Quite the contrary. He'd neglected to inform me of the probable reason you'd left and so I only had a few people on it. He'd interrogated them all every week. But when a year had passed he was... angry there had been so little progress made. That was when he gave me the jump-drive from which he'd been attempting to extract the corrupted files on his own." John thought he'd destroyed it, smashed it to bits under his boot, and with it, Mary's identity, therefore leaving no trace of the experiment she was a part of, how she'd been black-mailed by an unknown party who wanted to get to Sherlock through killing him.
"She's advanced," Sherlock argued, drawing John in front of him then between his knees by the wrist, then seeming not to know what to do with him, so he settled for fingering John's dressing gown sleeve. The fact that Sherlock's knees were bare when he opened his legs to admit him was not lost on this new John, the one allowed to ogle openly. John reflexively began to card through inky curls, still slightly damp.
"You haven't opened it yet. And don't go spouting some bollocks about it being the thought that counts. If you don't open it, you won't know just how much thought went into it."
John met his fervor kiss for kiss, devouring his mouth in the same manner without hesitation. He had no idea how this orgasm was as strong as the others without knocking him unconscious. He carefully helped John wash after and watched him dry off and wrap the towel around his hips before rinsing Sherlock's hair for him and beginning to drain the tub so that he could finish whilst he checked on the stew he smelled. He must have brought it up from Mrs. Hudson's when he was asleep. John came back into the room and immediately took over the ointment application, complete with a brief but effective massage that nearly put him down again but for the unbelievable arousal. But John wouldn't give in this time, praising his virulence, but insisting on boring things like eating. Sherlock's lean belly rumbled loudly even as he protested.
colour again. His charming lips were slightly parted, and he could practically see John's heart rate rise in his neck.
" accompanied the filling of his mouth. He stopped the sucking and just lapped at it after swallowing until John began weakly tugging on whatever he could reach of him, panting for him to rejoin him at the head of the bed. "I'd be jealous that you're so brilliant at everything, if I wasn't so satisfied," he mentioned once they'd thrown the duvet over themselves from the waist down. He'd noticed Sherlock's prodigal erection and, giver that he was, began sluggishly stroking it with small kisses to Sherlock's lips and face. "You're brave as well," he said.
"Yes," he said finally. "Another night safe." Sealing it with a kiss to her brow, john rolled onto his back for a stretch and nearly jumped out of his skin, simultaneously bundling Willa most of the way to the floor on the other side of the bed before registering that it was Sherlock, sitting in the arm chair which he had turned to face the bed rather than the window. He was dressed as usual, his white button up flawless, black jacket and trousers a second skin.
"You know the chef, I'd wager." John set the orange juice on the provided coaster on the beside table so there would be less of a chance of spillage.
"Perhaps I've tricked you into thinking so." John touched his face and he could hold the facade no longer. "I have to try."
"Sure," he conceded, completely truthful, but not believing for a moment Sherlock would find a quick solution to
"Yes." John turned onto his right side and slipped down into the mounds of cloud-like covers, leaning his temple against the fist still containing Sherlock's dose as he gazed at his flatmate cum business partner cum best friend cum fake romantic partner. His profile as he concentrated was fascinating, the small constellation of moles on the side of his neck and jaw-line intriguing. His chest rising and falling, tremoring ever so slightly with the strong beat of his heart, the heart John swore had ceased not very long before that. That's what a man in love would be thinking anyway, his mind automatically supplied in these cases. So as not to be as forward as he wished and interrupt Sherlock's movements, John began slowly trailing the fingers of his empty left hand along Sherlock's arm, from wrist to bicep to shoulder, to those beauty marks. He didn't stop talking, only slowed, seemingly leaning in to the caresses and taking deeper, more relaxed breaths.
'Luckily' Sherlock had decided to handle that bit for him when he sailed into the sitting room, John's olive drab counterpane, which was draped around him only over one shoulder as if he were some sort of Roman consulate member, billowing behind him. The mussed curls didn't at all counter the visual as he only needed a laurel-leaf crown to complete the picture. John had to lean his elbows on his thighs and put his head down in order to somehow rub some sense into it with his hands. Sherlock tossed John's mobile in a manner that had it land perfectly to his right before seating himself next to him on the other side, much as he had in Buckingham palace that other time, only much closer, the majority of their thighs touching. John didn't look up until after Sherlock spoke once more.
"Oh! I've made all sorts of social media pages for us. We also have a wedding planning site. Thinking about going through with it for the Bugatti Vera alone."
"I'll run you one before I go down and see if I can use Mrs. Hudson's so that-" Sherlock was looming over him before he finished what he was saying.
"What's all this then," John asked with another long drink from his glass, nearly finishing it. Sherlock poured him another and then darted off again, only to reappear with a large tumbler of banana Lassi for each of them to at least take the edge of the spice and... a candle in an ornate silver holder. He lit the wick and took his own seat across from John.
"I... Brilliant!" He glanced into the kitchen after an exchanged smirk and saw three huge pots on the table in there. "Looks like we'll be eating curry for the foreseeable future."
"Nothing," John fibbed, standing up and looking around for his dressing gown with his hands on his hips. It wasn't where it had been tossed the night before. He then thought of the fact that he didn't really know where that was as he was otherwise occupied at the time.
"Jealous?" John smirked jocularly, having to somehow get rid of the tiny seed of tension he felt at the bit of uncertainty regarding what may have been peeking out between the lines.
"I mean, yeah we were both pretty drunk but I don't think you were as drunk as I was. The things we... It couldn't have been very comfortable when I had so little control over myself."
The sweat on his brow wasn't just a reaction to the drugs. It really was that warm. The sound the door made when John kicked it shut behind himself was amplified by Sherlock's thoughts. It was as the closing of a jailhouse door, sealing his fate, whatever it may be, in his prison cell. John stood in only blood red football shorts and a deep blue tee shirt that made his eyes pop. He'd had an unexpected bout of extra grooming. He'd clipped his toe and fingernails and had shaved again. His silvered honey hair feathered comfortably into its usual military cut, and he smelled of his most sparingly used, more expensive toiletries. Sherlock could hardly breathe for the sight of him, his lizard brain causing him to nearly drool for just a taste.
and pulling his foot down so the server could set their drinks down. John handed her a twenty pound note and thoroughly ripped his attention from her to settle it back on Sherlock. Sherlock took a larger sip of his drink than he'd originally intended, as did John it seemed. John also tried a sip of Sherlock's, declaring it strangely delicious despite the odd ingredients. Just as Sherlock was reaching his breaking point, where he'd have to flee to the loo for a moment's respite from the animal attraction he was currently experiencing, owner Trevor Jones appeared, looking for all the world like a TV presenter with his crisply tailored bespoke suit(the only person in wearing one that Sherlock had seen), perfectly coiffed and manicured. Sherlock made a mental note to get the contact information of his tailor.
"Okay. So you're not jealous, but you're suddenly coming with me to the bar now that she's in the room."
"Well... yeah. I mean the spontaneity was good and it was really sweet, but in a ... school yard game sort of way. It was innocent. There was no... promise... of something deeper."
He bolted awake, alone in his bed and annoyed somewhere in the back of his mind at the slight relief of having nightmares about something other than his time in the war for a change. Mostly he was on high alert. Someone was banging on the door of his extremely secluded cabin, sat on an island off the coast of Scotland, on which he and his little daughter were the only human residents.
"I love it when you do that, Babe," John said truthfully, smiling up at him, and turned for yet another pleasant kiss. It was actually quite provocative, Sherlock talking that quickly, passionately flexing his big, beautiful brain. They were soon joined by Margie and a woman to whom Sherlock had been introduced as Jessica. They were on their way to the cue for the bar right by where the two men stood.
He left the blender roaring on its highest setting and rushed to Sherlock, only having to bend a little to get a look at his face. In the gently commanding way he had, John begged him to let him see, asking if something hit him somehow or if he'd been getting these headaches often, etc. Sherlock couldn't get the words out that it wasn't actually a headache when John was pressing cool fingers to his temples, stroking the brow bone, standing so close and smelling like-
"Nooo!" Sherlock stepped a little closer. "Our partnership, like all great partnerships, is based on knowledge of self and each other."
"John?" came the rather velvet voice, raised slightly in order to more adequately penetrate the barrier, "I know it's spacious in there and you're quite small, but I'd think your military training enough to allow you to be able to navigate-" John yanked open the door and was kissing him before he even fully stepped over the threshold, nearly toppling them over. It had the desired effects, shutting up Sherlock Holmes and subsequently, turning him into putty as the man sagged comfortably in his arms. Yep. He still had it. When John released him, Sherlock stumbled backward a bit and fumbled with his jacket button, clearing his throat.
on top of it all. They were no longer young men, either of them. Not that John's next actions supported this point, for he sprung to his feet with apologies and slightly disheveled hair, whose silvering didn't even make a dent in how youthful his face was. He hauled Sherlock to his own feet, seeming impossibly taller than himself, who had a full six inches on the condensed battle machine that was John Watson. Only now, he seemed more like a cat, a grizzled pride leader that, even in his later years no one could take down. Sherlock pushed the top half of the ring onto the appropriate finger and set the box carefully in the window sill. Only when it was stable did John grab him by the arm in order to toss him almost casually onto the bed.
"I don't know why I even asked," he said fondly, so low it was nearly a whisper. "I know you. I know how you are. I know how you operate and what you need. The only thing I ever get confused about is what you
"Babe," John said, kissing Sherlock's jaw on his way by to retrieve wipes from his bag for a final once over, "you're a brat."
As if to cement his acquiescence, John took the lead, grabbing his hand and walking ahead of him toward his bed. John was taking him to bed. The thought was a bit staggering, but at least they were already there when they fell onto it. The fire had sufficiently warmed the area and he kissed John gently in the combined dim light of it and his bedside lamp. Sherlock undid John's jeans, gently tugging them off and leaving his pants for the moment. He also left the vest, determined to live out at least part of his fantasy of putting his mouth there, the side of his face, then his mouth again on John's now rather distended pants. It was so much better when John was erect. John wanting him was lovely to think about in the abstract, but this physical representation was almost more than Sherlock could wrap his mind around.
He couldn't think of anything to do or say, his mind sheathed in a fog of emotion. This is why he hated caring! He swore under his breath and departed abruptly, not slamming the door even though he really wanted to, as it would affect the pies. He took his frustrations out on his own bedroom door, however, slamming it repeatedly then flopping onto his bed to rub his eyes. That didn't go well. He bloody
He called Sherlock's name and strained to try and look about the room without actually putting any part of himself in it. He called again, but still there was no answer, no movement, and no Sherlock, as far as he could see anyway. He was suddenly yanked through the door by the lapels of his jacket and barreled back against it, slamming it shut. His impulse to take immediate control of the situation was quelled with the introduction of a foreign yet welcome tongue into his mouth and hands that seemed to be simultaneously stripping off his jacket and undoing his shirt buttons. To be fair, he was no longer sure which hands belong to whom as the single goal seemed to be getting him naked and subsequently orgasming as soon as possible. Sherlock was murmuring things into his ears and mouth that were only filthy by implication and that extra grumble he seemed to have in his speaking voice whenever he was aroused. It usually followed his erection noise if he wasn't concentrating on controlling it, but now he allowed it to remain for the purpose of asking what took John so long, and reminding him that not only was he not wearing pants, but if it were up to him, neither one of them would wear them ever again if it wasn't for practicality's sake.
"Well, it's a night club, isn't it? Part of what we had to do in the beginning of the training was be able to deploy despite the barriers of being impaired. So the lads... well there were a couple of ladies who could put most of them down without a second thought I knew..." John trailed off, recalling something pleasant for a moment and Sherlock barely repressed a sneer. "Anyways, we all went on an all-night bender. They dressed me for the occasion and... well it worked." John described the scene without batting an eye. Of course he did. He was the calmest in the face of danger, and there was real danger that Sherlock would explode with sudden realizations and panic over what to do with the information. John even stood differently. He wasn't the ever-present soldier at the moment, he was...
"Don't start getting awkward," he warned. "We both wanted this. I knew what I was getting into before we even started."
"How you two became engaged. I'll need a good romance story to remind me why I still... love my husband through all of this shite!" He glanced at Sherlock who, upon returning from whatever tasks he'd been set to, was designated as her hand hold. He squatted behind her after removing his own fine jacket and supported her leaning back between his knees as he sat on the back of the sofa, the distressed woman attempting to break both of his hands in her grips. Sherlock first shook his head against mentioning the fact that the mother and father weren't together at the moment, then nodded giving the green light for the engagement story John so drunkenly created. After having her switch to a position where she kneeled so that she could lay forward on the sofa, John began telling what Sherlock would consider a more embellished tale of how he'd actually proposed the night before with his dog tags. In actuality, all he did was leave out exactly when it took place, the fact of their intoxication, and that it was all a charade. John had told his genuine heart at the time, or rather what he would feel if it had been real; how very much he felt for Sherlock and wanted to express it in every way possible.
"Hello, Margie," he said, accepting the continental dual cheek kiss greeting after the woman practically knocked the table over getting around it with what was a massive belly. "You didn't have to get up," he indicated by gesturing to her form.
Sherlock was incorporated into Willa's bedtime routine, her Papa staying a bit longer with her after lights out. John emerged from a luxurious bath to a freshly showered and dressing gown clad Sherlock, the familiar blue one that did things to his already remarkable eyes. John had been provided with a brand new matching one in a deeper blue, which flowed silkily, sliding pleasantly over his skin as he moved toward the other part of his heart.
"Yes, it is." It was his military photo along with a poppy and a forget-me-not. "Hey, bonus points if you can tell me what kind of cancer killed Tom Smith," John entreated, face aching form trying not to smile so widely at this fascinating demonstration. Performing monkey he wasn't, but what Sherlock
"Yes?" he answered his hand, then glanced up at him long enough for his eyes to be captured. His... smoldering eyes, nearly all grey in the current light.
After a rousing discussion about her silver chain, they were informed that it was now calm enough to travel. First stop, The Holmes childhood estate. Sherlock refused to release the child the entire time, Willa unexpectedly allowing herself to be carried until they reached the field before the front door of the manor. Nor would he be more than an inch away from John, mostly laying a free hand on what he could.
"You what? John you what?" His heart began beating much more quickly than he was sure was necessary. Fear was a terrible thing, but no one could evoke it so thoroughly in him as even the very
I actually would be embarrassed. I take back everything I ever said about the mustache." John's laughter echoed against the tiles and Sherlock stormed out of the kitchen to throw himself haughtily into his chair. The man had no right to do all those things he did that made Sherlock feel. Emotions were so very useless to him and he wished they could be removed so that he could get on with The Work. But, no, he had to spend precious brain power being angry about John needing air after an argument turning into a mission for Mycroft in a classified location. He had to further worry about John's safety regardless of the fact that it was meant to be a benign assignment. The worrying bit lead to him breaking his protest fast, as he began snacking on leftover takeaway as he was rotted from the inside by watching some horrid television program rerun. The rather large, homely Scottish woman with all the cats had at least
"What gave it away? The the logo on my bag or the work out clothes?" John asked smugly after a sigh someone may have interpreted as 'fond'. Sherlock did sit up then, and the reality of what John looked like was infinitely more disgraceful than anything he could have imagined. That he was constantly surprised by this was irritating. The silvering honey of John's hair spoke of constant fingers being pushed through it due to perceived discomfort associated with a missed hair cut. He sported an olive drab tank top and Arsenal red football shorts, the team's crest a patch on the right leg near the hem. The fact that Sherlock recognized just the symbol made him inwardly flinch, though he was soothed by the rest of his senses exercise in non-visual deducing through sound and smell.
"I don't see why it's so funny to you. Children aspire to be all sorts of things when they're small. Even impossible things. I'm sure you wanted to be a lion tamer or some such rubbish."
"I understand this is the sort of thing couples usually discuss," Sherlock said turning his manual exploration into a light massage. "How far you want to go, what you'd like to try and the like."
deigned to actually let the small staff they kept, as they were elderly and it was rather a large place, cook the meal. They all stared expectantly, trying their best to keep quiet, lest they somehow miss the announcement. Mrs. Hudson had even joined them, in order to give her a bit of a holiday from her sister whilst Baker Street went through its transformation.
"Alone is what I have," he said, parroting words Sherlock had once told him right before he 'died'. "Alone protects me."
He first smelled it when he opened the door to the building. At least Sherlock had eaten recently, going by the scent of the particularly strong curry Sherlock enjoyed most from the take away around the corner. Just lingering in his nose made his eyes water by the time he got to the top of the stairs to enter the sitting room. It was oddly devoid of any food that he could see. He called Sherlock's name as he put his keys in their place close to the door, but got no response at first, though he could clearly hear someone puttering around behind the closed sliding stained glass panels of the kitchen doors. Without thinking about it, he launched into the beginning of whatever they usually talked about when he got in, this time being a question of whether he should get more milk. Sherlock had once requested the curry so spicy that he'd burned his tongue because none of the milk in the house was viable at the time. He giggled to himself a bit about how Sherlock couldn't even stop talking after John had to carefully wrap his tongue to keep the salve in place.
"And I love you, John Watson. Hamish and everything." Just as the sealing kiss was again going to go past a point of no return, Sherlock unceremoniously dumped the parcel, which John vaguely remembered being somewhere on the the side away from where he was sitting, into John's lap. He was reminded of their state of undress as he looked down at it, yet didn't much care in light of this new yet inevitable and timeless development.
"These were made by my great great grandfather on my mother's side, from materials found whilst traveling in Africa. It's said to have a spell on it, that controls who may wear it. Ridiculous really but, it is said that rings made from it are only to be worn by people in a true partnership. The jewelry made from it is never to be re-sized, nor has it ever been. I checked the history of it when I was told the story. The enchantment dictates it must fit whomever it is given to at the time of the betrothal without having to be re-sized. That person is with whom you are supposed to be for the rest of your days." He slid it onto John's finger, holding his hand up to the light.
"She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Sherlock. It's highly possible that whilst in a depressive episode she-"
"It's human nature," Sherlock explained in a whisper, his breath humid in John's ear, though not unpleasant. "Still appalling, though." He settled back again in his seat after a playful lobe nip, John probably making his own sound, this one more surprised than anything else at how quickly he went to half mast at that small action. Sherlock had surprisingly drunk every glass of wine poured, and John grudgingly admitted he had a hard time keeping up. They slipped out just before the end of everything, including right before the last of the alcohol hit John's system.
"Wait! Sherlock please," He stopped immediately, unable to actually let go yet, though he set him more stably on his feet again. John's face was a mixture of confusion, fear, and, dare he say elation, with an undertone of pure desire. Sherlock understood his trepidation, knew the basis of everything he saw there.
, pushed up on the balls of his socked feet, wrapping his arms around his neck, enveloping him in everything that was 'John' as far as was possible without being inside him. And that thought immediately caused the latch Sherlock had used to lock away the part about John being so incredibly arousing so that he could have a normal conversation with him, to break spectacularly, the desire bursting free and running rampant with little he could do to stop it, only confine it to a large room. Barely.
It was as cozy and homespun as it looked on the outside, the decor and overwhelming air of simplicity making it seem much smaller than it was, but in a warm, familial way. By the time they reached one of several sitting rooms (the library, judging by the thousands of volumes lining the walls three storeys high)Willa was perched on her grandfather's knee, nibbling primly on a biscuit and, between swallowing bites, so she wouldn't talk with her mouth full, was relaying the story of her necklace yet again, but in full this time. She told her rapt listeners about how no matter what happened, where they went or who with they could or could not engage, she was loved by everyone represented. She'd memorized that, in case of emergency, she was to contact Sherlock Holmes and say 'Vatican Cameos', as "Papa may not pay attention to a child trying to contact him." That earned Sherlock an icy stare from everyone in the room except John, who could only smile proudly. There was no time to be angry over Sherlock's idiosyncrasies when trying to keep their daughter safe and John said so after a moment. Sherlock seemed surprised that he did, sat closer to his father than he probably had since he was a boy himself with John firmly at his right so that their thighs pressed up against each other. John couldn't blame him. He himself had to be able to touch them both at any time at the moment, too.
"No," Sherlock said finally, a bit annoyed that John didn't realize that he'd never put him in actual danger in their own home. It was a sanctuary of sorts, despite the many crimes which took place there. Some of them, Sherlock wasn't even responsible for.
"Sh." He briefly lay his jaw against John's temple then walked forward, hand at the small of John's back. His prominent eyebrows raised up into the curls on his forehead at the feel of John's trusty Browning in it's standard place. John only had time for a quick grin before wiping his face, and tried his best to gather words and carriage at least adequate for the occasion. By the time the proud grandparents were reached by the adults, Willa had been passed to her grandfather and Violet Vernet Holmes stood with her hands clasped in front of her, every bit as stately as her sons. It's where they got it from.
"We've only just begun, and that isn't what I've brought you in here for." With a heated kiss, he corrected himself. "Not the initial reason, anyway." John smiled through another kiss before he allowed himself to be walked to the foot of the bed and his attention directed to the wall above the headboard. Four seemingly empty 11x17 frames were hung in a row and, just beneath it, a long, rectangular frame housing a continuous piece of paper with zig-zagging markings on it from one end to the other. On the bed itself was a letter, on good stationary, John's name written with a flourish on it in forest-green ink. Sherlock then left him alone, shutting the door and seating himself at the kitchen table to wait the amount of time he estimated it would take for the letter to be read, its instructions followed, and to gather himself after.
"I'll be the same amount of comfortable either way," he said truthfully. It didn't exactly fill Sherlock with confidence but he went with it, unable to walk properly with what was going on in his trousers at the prospect. His greatest comfort at the moment was John's matching state.
He'd not only survived, but thrived after the lowest he'd ever been, getting exactly what he needed in the way of adrenaline and genuinely helping people beyond his medical training. It wasn't exactly the war he missed. Mycroft wasn't precisely correct about that. No, it was the aspects surrounding it, the rush of helping fix a human being who may have had much more to offer the world than his or her life at the time. As long as there was a tomorrow, there was always hope for anything, from curing diseases to mending relationships on a minor/major scale.
"Papa let me put the chocolate on the toast." There it was, that familiar stress storm after the quiet of placation. John hadn't missed that at all. Well... Perhaps a bit.
John straddled his lap, keeping his hips elevated to hover just above his mound of tumescence, and put the sandwich to his lips. As he chewed, John went for the tea. He'd already swallowed and so licked and then bit his lips as John blew on the liquid then lifted it to his mouth. Sherlock took several sips, keeping his eyes shut to the attractiveness before him, hoping it came off as mere enjoyment of the food. "You should try it," John said, getting the sandwich once more.
"I was fifteen before my voice even began to change instead of the others who started perhaps two years earlier. I tried to get it to do so prematurely with the smoking. Of course, being an addict, it didn't really matter after a while."
"Christmas. I was going to have a photo taken including everyone and print it out immediately on photo paper, then gift you a frame in which to put it." John's eyes went contemplative, his lovely thin were lips wet, then wet again by his tongue, but Sherlock couldn't stop talking, despite not knowing whether or not it was a good thing. He knew the present would be perfect but now the data was all jumbled, the timeline off. "Then, I planned to lure you under the mistletoe under perfectly believable false pretenses and... reveal my feelings then." John bolted to his feet, nearly knocking the chair over but didn't face him yet.
"I should have... given her up... when I found out. You... I knew you didn't actually want a child and you... you didn't actually want...
"Just needed to take the edge off," John explained, going over to the full-length mirror to make sure his hair sat correctly and ribbons were straight on his chest. Sherlock had somehow talked him into getting permission  to wear his uniform, an allowance that was expedited thanks to a certain sibling. He could barely squeeze into it when they started, but exercise on top of the rigorous activity of solving cases had tightened him up a bit in all the right places. He had the rare pleasure of catching Sherlock staring at him through their mirrored reflections. He knew it was unintentional because Sherlock hurriedly snatched his eyes back to his cuffs and jacket hem. "Ready, Babe?" John offered his arm. Sherlock threaded his through and allowed himself to be lead down to the hall in which the introduction dinner was taking place.
"If Mary's past caught up with her, then you had no reason to be able to trust that Mycroft could protect you and our child," he murmured, staying perfectly still, hands stuffed into his pockets then stepping much closer. John confirmed his words with a nod. "He would have, you know?"
"Fuck! Sherlock! I'm going to come," John blurted, but suddenly, he wasn't anymore. Sherlock grasped the base, pulling off with another wet noise, and just examined it, throbbing and leaking, copious amounts of the aforementioned lubricant combined with an abundance of saliva dripping in goopy waves, as he wheezed over the spectacle that was the result of his mouth's work. John had his head thrown back and was whining quietly at the ceiling, getting a little louder when Sherlock began unbuttoning his top for him, laying open-mouthed kisses on each subsequent inch of bared flesh.
"Yes, Daddy?" There was the slightest lisp. Sherlock struggled with one in his childhood. She was currently examining her uncle's green and black diagonally striped tie.
But in the time it took for him to think this, Sherlock already had him fully erect, foreskin retracted, a combination of saliva and beads of fluid from his slit serving as lubricant. The infuriating man continued looking for all the world like he was boredly browsing telly channels instead of furiously wanking John past the point of coherency. He knew exactly what to do, where to rub, how much pressure to use.  He even had the
"Hm, let me see... something along the lines of, this never has to happen again, you can learn to be satisfied with just this once, and you love me beyond all measure and would have me any way I wanted you. Close enough?" John sighed and tensed slightly, about to pull away, but that was the last thing he would allow until he'd finished. He insisted on talking now, when words were still so few, so they would talk.
"You do a bit," he smirked, letting his hand fall onto his own left shoulder, tracing the large scar he was obviously self-conscious about beneath the shirt there. It told Sherlock that he wasn't the only one laid completely bare now. "It really just means you need people, friends, family. You'll always need someone else. Everyone does."
"I just said so, didn't I? I can cook, John, it's simple science. I just usually have more important things to occupy my mind."
"Which would be a comfort if we KNEW WHERE THE BLOODY HELL WE WERE GOING!" His shouting rang in his ears and he was about to make good on his fantasy of throttling Sherlock when he saw the apathetic look on the consulting detective's face. One more blink. Just one more of those opalescent eyes and he'd do it.
John felt himself being shoved back up that proverbial mountain, off the beaten path, the stones and soil abrading his apparently bare hands and feet. Sherlock was staring intently at the center console just above the radio as John yanked the map out, enduring the
wants me to put 'something more on'?" Apparently the heat had affected both his mind and his modesty because he hooked his thumbs between the waistband of the shorts and his pants and
"Please, John. I won't go any further without your express permission, but know that I very much want to. Please. My John, my Darling, please?" This new development, accompanied by his special pet name purred, octopus-like pawing, and sensuous feline-ish licking in areas seemingly designated for maximum convincing power pushed him right over the edge of the hedonism he couldn't quite bring himself to feel guilty about in the moment.
"You don't usually ask stupid questions, Sherlock," he said. Sherlock nodded once, then stepped deftly past him, entering the house and expecting them all to know to follow, which of course they did. It's what he did. Lead. Mycroft had, at some point, told Willa to go back into the bedroom and wait, so as not to overwhelm her already fragile father. Everyone just sort of stood around for a bit, looking at each other in silent tension. It was killing him. So John did the only thing he could think of to break the ice. Small talk. "You lot look really well."
"What this mystery... I dunno, condition is." He could. He could tell John everything and he would be extremely sympathetic and perhaps let him-
"Well you could have just asked," he heard John murmur, and found himself smiling at it. He stopped that immediately.
"You apparently don't have to." John was reasonably sure Sherlock wasn't talking about them. "Your very name seems to inspire pregnancies. Besides she's recently separated from her children's father and still carries a torch for you. Probably has all these years, and though she'd probably never act on it, and has given him nearly three healthy children with whom they've built a life, the husband finally got tired of playing second fiddle to a high school memory.
"Well if it's connected to a case or something interesting like that..." John stopped his 'fantasizing' and leaned over for the sole purpose of giving Sherlock a hard look. "Oh don't look so scandalised. Do you honestly think I wouldn't be all for that bit?" The laughter this time was full on and cathartic. With a final pat, John went to make tea and Sherlock suddenly retrieved his laptop and holed himself up in his room. It wasn't unusual, so John took no special note of it. As he re-scrubbed his favourite mug with bleach to counteract the potential danger of any lingering experiment components, he paused.
"What exactly are you suggesting?" He didn't really have to ask, because his mind had immediately gone there. But he had to hear it. The suggestion had to be all John's.
"Touché," John said. "Please, continue." Please. What was he even begging for? In his own mind, no less?
"Well. Alright then." John heard Mycroft's unspoken question, but God forbid he admit he didn't know something. He waited for the answer to be revealed, which it was in the next moment when John pulled the only thing that was hung up out of the closet. A tiny three piece skirt suit complete with tie.
"Oopsie." The only indication of any reaction was that his lean shoulders tightened minutely when John shouted. It meant a modicum of contrition, despite the fact that it probably would happen again. Also, when did John get so in tune with the smallest of gestures? He rushed over to where the offending appendage was stored and yanked open the door, thinking twice before donning a pair of Marigold washing up gloves with which to handle the specimen. "John!" Sherlock cried out, getting to his feet so quickly, he nearly upset the entire table. John, being smaller, twisted away from his long, grabbing hands and went around the other side of the table. "That has to maintain a certain temperature in order to tell me what I need to know. You're ruining it!" he explained rapidly.
The car pulled up in front of the familiar black door the knocker jauntily to the left meaning Mycroft hadn't visited. Sherlock didn't really touch him more than usual, well more than what had become the new norm which was loads more than before, but then he was almost never one for unnecessary public displays. He did allow John's hand on his thigh, even putting his hand on top of it and absently moving it up closer to his groin when John tried to show a bit more decorum and initially just pat his knee. He said little other than confirming his older brother wasn't laying in wait for them, poised to give them an earful about their relationship.
John attempted to throw himself into the farce even more, to see if that helped. He clutched Sherlock's hand and pointed out what had changed and what remained the same since he'd been a student and joked around more with old sports mates who had done well for themselves in high-paying positions in which a lot of exotic travel was involved. As a precaution, he was much more gentle with Sherlock, as he worked out whether or not he had reason to. Sherlock returned the soft, rather chaste kisses and touches, but demonstrated how not fooled he was when he pulled the ex-soldier aside to ask what was wrong. John was reluctant to answer at first, merely shrugging. Sherlock tugged him behind a tree and leaned back against it, placing a hand on either side of John's jaw to pull him close. John fell much farther into the kiss than he'd planned, but that was the underlying theme to everything he did with Sherlock. No matter what limits he set on how far he'd go, John always ended up in much deeper than anticipated, and strangely not sorry for it, given his current reservations.
Then they were both topless, chest to chest, deeply into each other's mouths, their legs slotted comfortably. The way John clutched at him and rocked his hips slightly down into his all but drove Sherlock over the edge already. He had to begin his descent in order to keep it together for long enough to get John off at least once. He was so glad he shaved that day for seemingly no reason. Sherlock had read something about unpleasantness akin to rug burn back in that time and place.
Margie could only repeat, "Oh John! My baby! My beautiful baby! Thank you! Thank you so much!" She was turned over once again and Sherlock, just staring at the entire scenario, automatically slid down onto the floor behind her as she clutched the calming infant. There was applause in the makeshift cubicle which spread and went from being interspersed with relieved gasps at the healthy squall to thunderous when Jessica went out to announce all was well.
long. Of course, with Sherlock's propensity toward experimenting with memory manipulating chemicals, one couldn't rightfully be certain. It was a wooden ring box, carved intricately with what looked like perhaps lilies, but weren't quite right to be. Inside, nestled in what had to be a silk pillow were a pair of rings that espoused simplicity and glamour. They should have been gaudy and cumbersome but they weren't somehow. The bands were silver, probably platinum if Sherlock was the purchaser, and each had a discreet notch, and were etched with the likeness of a plant. The one that was obviously John's was immediately recognizable as a thistle, referencing John's Scottish blood. Sherlock's matched the carving on the box.
Title(and the name of the bar based on the band of the same name-only 1 'x' though). They are a delight and sing:
"No you can't but this man had children; children who need to know what happened to their father as soon as possible." Sherlock looked genuinely contrite.
"John... May I see her?" John gave a great heaving sigh, swiped his hands roughly over his face, and blew his nose before making use of the hand sanitizer. John stood as if preparing to face an inquisition and entered the small bedroom they shared. As before, she wasn't in the bed. Mycroft gave him a curious look and he couldn't help the little smile of pride as John pulled out his own mobile to text a happy face emoticon. Slowly, a panel, the hinges of which were hidden by the curtain of the window set deep into the logs, opened noiselessly and a giant dark eye crested with tousled curls not as dark as Sherlock's, cautiously peeked out.
"Yes, I believe you care for me a great deal," he said. Then, surprisingly, "And I you, and, according to, well almost everyone, it seems we're practically married now. " John's jokes had much more of an hysterical edge when he was trying to keep some sort of fear of Sherlock's ignorance at bay and talk the rather socially inept man through something important. John really was a marvel, often pushing aside his own great discomfort in favour of making sure Sherlock understood a piece of knowledge. "But it's not the right
During one particularly steamy bout, he attempted to get more control of himself by conversing with John between kisses, genuinely trying to work out what would get him to finally agree.
"Okay, let me just get this done then do the egg whites." John traded back again and Sherlock set the disc up in the sitting room as John poured batter and whipped egg whites with cream of tartar to get them to foam up. Mrs. Hudson returned just then. She was always needing to send someone out or go next door herself for some ingredient or other and usually thought it was easier for her to just do it herself as opposed to making sense and sending the younger, sprier generation. She exclaimed in delight upon discovering Sherlock's presence and made him listen to some rambling story about her eldest sister whom she wished lived closer for the holidays and wondering if this year would be her last year being able to travel. All whilst holding a dish into which she was separating... something into. He rolled his eyes repeatedly at John and he'd just smile chastisingly back.
"The only reason you come up here is because you know I'm more likely to listen to you bitch and moan until you fucking make me attempt to entertain you. Do you need a swab of my arm pit or something before I shower?" Good idea, actually. Perhaps he could find out what was so alluring to him about John's scent in particular. Interesting. He meant interesting, not alluring.
"I do now," John admitted, voice thick with unspent tears. "But I was afraid. I couldn't risk the baby," A small sob that sounded almost like a laugh escaped him. "Or Mrs. Hudson, or Mycroft. So you see how none of it was you. You're not to blame for any of it because I'd just been given the only reason I had left to live. Until now." He was at last silent for an entire minute.
"I have," John confirmed, as if trying to be patient with a child in trouble and began undoing Sherlock's shirt buttons from the bottom until his tautly muscled torso was bared, the surprisingly auburn hairs curling thinly in a vague 't'-shape. He ran deft doctor's fingers over them, avoiding Sherlock's nipples, which were already hardened with the aforementioned eagerness. With a chaste kiss to his high, pale forehead, John began the punishment in earnest.
John snatched the keys out of the ignition, ignoring Sherlock's indignant noise and, extremely quietly said, "I'll show you old fashioned. Get in back." Sherlock blinked at him again, only this time it was wide-eyed surprise and assessment.
"Women are actually meant to give birth in a similar position," he explained lightly. "Gravity makes everything easier for you. Do you know if it's a boy or girl?" It was all more distraction tactics, as he could already see the answer.
with that. Anyone who came into his life Post Sherlock would also have to be so. He handed Sherlock back his laptop and got on his once more, musing aloud that he probably should just take Sherlock. Despite a potential for disaster at least as high as it would be with one of these young ladies, it was at least guaranteed to be
"Alright, fine!" He said sharply, then sighed. "But you'll have to... restrain me." It was almost a squeak at the end and he cleared his throat. So many possibilities.
"Hmm," Sherlock mused into his ear, causing the tiniest of pleasurable chills as his pointing finger indicated of whom he was talking. "Cancer, car crash, line of duty, obvious."
He sighed deeply, "Alright a little, but I haven't many friends and I demand all of their attention."
"You shouldn't... you shouldn't lay on your back since you've vomited," John drawled, the alcohol making his tongue thick and his vision somewhat blurry. When one got past a certain level of intoxication, one's brain tended to gag that little voice that announced when one had had quite enough to drink.
"Doesn't make it not the case," Lestrade had said in that infuriating know-it-all tone. Is that what Sherlock sounded like to other people? It
At precisely the right moment, Sherlock pulled with his fingers and mouth, flicked his tongue and finger tips, and, with a curse and strange combination of a whisper and a moan of his name, there it was. He'd gotten John over the edge, bucking his rather lovely hips so that Sherlock had to move his face back to avoid choking. He just couldn't bear to be separated from John's delectable skin, and so set to work kissing his way back up until he could gather his new lover to him. John clutched at him, squeezed him, shaking so hard it rattled his teeth. Words and kisses poured directly from Sherlock's heart in an unstoppable manner, denoting how exquisite John was, how beautiful, how clever and good he was. If it had been anyone else, if they had been much further into their relationship, he wouldn't have hesitated in preparing and plunging himself inside John to the hilt or, more likely, vice-versa, and been finished way too quickly with the image of how he looked whilst in the throws of orgasm forever burned into his mind.
From that point on, John felt as if there was a great burden lifted from his shoulders, though he wasn't quite sure what the actual basis had been. When put in the special way Sherlock had of putting things, usually involving a derivative of the word 'idiot', it did seem a bit silly. And they'd shared an actual orgasm by which Sherlock didn't seem negatively affected in the least. John knew he wasn't, except for the bit where this was all nonsense, despite Sherlock's confession of... begging. To counteract the unexplained cynicism he felt coming up, he became more genuinely socially engaged. Even as he noticed Sherlock becoming less so.
"Looks like a speakeasy," John commented. Sherlock spent most of the cab ride over there trying to get himself under control, but then John would... say something and all of his hard work was dashed like so much delicate glass. In turn, Sherlock said nothing until they were at the top of the stairs.
"I suppose not," he said finally, sniffing at the slide he chose and held up to the desk light he'd moved in there for the time being.
It was familiar and domestic and comforting, all cornerstones of the fact that this was a dream; a very vivid dream in which all five senses were fully stimulated. Even within the unconscious illusion, he could tell his eyes were shut, the orange glow of early morning sunlight on the other side of his lids serving as a gentle incitement to wakefulness. It didn't demand, but bade him open his eyes in his own time, however long it took. He was enveloped in what he could only think of as 'the fragrance of dawn'. It spoke of not only newness, but the history of time, the rebirth of light after death. Basically, how someone extremely dear to someone else would smell at first light, whether they be lover, parent, sibling, or child, clean sweat and warm with impending enthusiasm for the day ahead. There was also a rather octopus-like quality to the embrace, as if there were many arms holding him at once. His mouth tasted of security in the fact that whoever was his bed-mate wouldn't object to an affectionate kiss, no matter how heinous his breath, or how they would playfully inform him of how offended they were by it.
"Tell me when to stop," Sherlock breathed into the skin of his neck, his words basting it before he went back for another taste.
"Doesn't it just? The next day, we... have... John, what are you doing?" John had sat back up, pushed the papers and bag off the bed, plucked Sherlock's phone from his long-lithe fingers, and put it gently aside on the bedside table, before straddling his lap.
"Who's weirder, the weirdo or the one who chooses to spend all of his time with him?" He almost had him there. Only it wasn't exactly a choice. Sherlock seemed to get into one's life through the smallest chink, then slowly begin to expand until he filled every corner of it. A few years ago, it would have annoyed him. Maybe. All that mattered, however, was the here and now and, in the here and now, it was just part of their odd, yet incredibly well-running relationship. The image of Sherlock being shagged while swearing popped involuntarily into John's head and refused to go away. He was only able to bury it. For science.
"Also you ran home and, if you recall, I never actually saw you today," he said in a way that was matter-of-fact, but would no doubt be interpreted as rude. John was now taking off his brand new blue and white trainers and socks.
Sherlock then cloistered himself in his room for a week whenever he was at home and not working on a case. During these times, he would only allow John to accompany him when he needed help with the experiment, which his partner diligently did, having no idea what it was actually for. John was actually good about that, contrary to popular belief. As long as no one was getting permanently harmed physically or emotionally, he was a sight more logical about experiment participation than Sherlock's other peers. John even began giving him an orgasm whenever his mind was racing too fast to think properly after the first time it worked, citing that it always helped him relax when his mind was going wonky.
They stepped out only when the water grew frigid, drying each other off slowly despite the goosebumps and other hardened skin. They then each donned their old dressing gowns, as the others were still packed and downstairs, and when John went into the bedroom, Sherlock went into the kitchen, returning moments later with two steaming mugs of tea, just the way John took his. Upon smelling his, John noticed an extra element, the pungent odor of whiskey prevailed and John grinned, only taking two long sips before setting it aside and pushing down further beneath the sheet and duvet. Sherlock copied his actions and there, under the covers, it fully began.
"Mm." John scooped a bit of the other two onto his dish and tore off a piece of naan with which to sop up the sauces. "It's fine. Get the worst of it out of the way early, I guess. What's Ay... Ayam...?"
Ever the scientist, however, the experiment wasn't abandoned as, just as John came hard, missing his expensive top by the skin of his teeth by pulling it up as far as possible and Sherlock catching most of it in his hand, Sherlock looked at his watch. John's trousers weren't as lucky. He was in awe all over again as Sherlock began lapping up his emissions with that deft tongue.
He was properly leaking now, the damp patch in his pants growing with every word he uttered, nearly gushing when John formed the word 'masturbation'. "Wait!"
"Perhaps I'll have to." He tried his best to keep his thoughts specifically of John to himself as the man patiently helped him work his way through the sandwich and tea. "Also, perhaps a spot of whatever you've been drinking in my next cup."
"Oh look, he's blushing," Margie pointed out, sparking another round of cackling that cut off dramatically just as John turned and raised himself from his seat in order to flee the table.
Sherlock came again, babbling incoherently, yanking John over the edge with him, swearing the entire way.
"I see." Sherlock looked a bit far away, but thankfully didn't remove his hands, so John knew he was still listening, just going into analysis mode.
"Another night safe," she said per route. It was a little bit heartbreaking, but their reality, nevertheless. John suddenly had a hazy yet exceedingly joyful memory of the point at which Willa climbed into bed with them, squirming her way into the middle and fitting perfectly.
"She was murdered, John." He may as well have said 'Darling' again instead of 'John', going by his tone, but this was sort of business and Sherlock fell back on his default brand of professionalism of a sort. "By a stalker, most likely."
"For what it's worth, John, you didn't seem at all... not ready." John couldn't help his grin at the rare straightforward praise.
"People have been known to do the silliest things in the name of sentiment. We deal with it all the time."
Sherlock couldn't help his return smile, wasn't even aware he was doing it until about the third time it happened, which apparently made him pull a face and John subsequently burst out laughing a little at what must have been an inappropriate time in the story. John apologised profusely and promptly blamed it on Sherlock, as usual. Mrs Hudson forgave him the instant she saw the face for herself. She shook her head with a little titter, not knowing what she was going to do with "you boys" before asking no one in particular where the fresh nutmeg she required was. As if summoned, Lestrade came in with a large brown paper sack, complaining about the holiday hoards. He set it on the table's only clean spot and fished out the jar of whole nutmeg, holding out his acquisition proudly. Mrs. Hudson didn't take it, only handed him a metal grater and a paper towel. He sighed, slipped off his coat, and draped it over the back of the chair he was to sit in.  His help was apparently part of an ongoing apology for his part in Sherlock's downfall. As soon as he finished telling how he was trapped, looking for Sherlock but no one knowing where he was for sure, so he was to join John in the gallows to wait for him to get back in or make his presence known, Sherlock pounced, so to speak. "It can't be all that interesting as you're not begging," Sherlock stated dismissively. "I'm in the middle of something just now, Lestrade. I'll look at your cold case later. John, the experiment-"
John slowly kissed his way back up his body, taking as much time as possible to cover as much of his skin as possible. Between the things he did orally to him and the preparation going on almost without his knowledge, it made it so Sherlock thought he'd never be without an erection in John's presence again. They locked eyes, John cradling the back of his head with his non-dominant right hand, holding his own thick cock  with the other so he could sink slowly into his consulting detective, a combination of suddenly appearing and natural lubrication easing the way nicely. John's expression... he'd never seen anything so beautiful as John Watson enjoying his body. He was still a moment when he was fully seated and seeming to... revel... in the sensation. Sherlock begged his hands release so he could touch back.
"I'm sorry you're afraid to marry me." John grew extremely still for a moment then continued stroking the bird's head. "This isn't the proposal. I just... I admit that I've given you every reason to be. But please believe me when I say that fear of me is the last thing I want."
No streetlamps and no warm lights from scattered farm houses in the vicinity probably meant little to no phone coverage. Sherlock pulled the vehicle over(an all wheel drive SUV, thank God for small miracles)as John checked his phone for the tenth time in the short span of time it took for Sherlock's phone battery, the phone with the Sat Nav they were relying on, to give out. He himself hadn't had any bars since, roughly, the first hour outside of the London area. He really needed an upgrade, especially now that they had a more than comfortable income.
"Not even a half truth," he promised. "Now hurry up! Her Highness is bellowing for a royal dresser."
"Not really. I mean it wasn't real yet." Sherlock lifted his head, causing John to turn his and they locked eyes.
It was said in a matter-of-fact manner that gave John pause. Sherlock couldn't actually see John that way. He didn't even really work that way. It was all part of the play and John just needed to get out of his head about it. Interaction with the outside world always helped with that, and so he accepted the sweet kiss that followed and let him finish doing up his tie emblazoned with the school crest so they could catch the coach with the rest of the reunion-goers. It gave him the warmest feeling to see a bit of the metal chain of his tags poking from beneath Sherlock's crisp collar, hear the metal disks clink and slide against each other softly with more extreme movements.
being the most prominent. He knew when his partner was close and, for whatever reason, more complex thoughts broke through the haze, causing him to slow then stop altogether. Sherlock made the most frustrated sound, a low, brief growl with which John wholeheartedly agreed, though this had to be discussed.
"No," he said seriously, all traces of humor gone from his voice. He raised himself again to capture Sherlock's eyes. "You are good person. Whether or not you want to be."
"I... not much really," John admitted, smiling that annoyingly gorgeous little smile he had when he found Sherlock fascinating. Which was often. "It's still pretty much the standard holds, sweeps, and throws."
John wore crimson Y-fronts trimmed in white that day, which, upon removal, revealed the light gold and and silver hairs sprouting from it. They were neatly trimmed the night before so that it was a perfect frame for a substantial cock, a light toast colour and magnificently engorged. A tentative bead of clear fluid had formed and Sherlock momentarily didn't know whether to keep looking or taste, incensed that he couldn't do both at once. Finally he began kissing around it, John's inner thighs trembling a little at his lips' light caresses. Sherlock firmed them up a bit, then gave the base a simple open-mouthed one. When he looked up, those eyes were on his. Good. John was present. Even when he closed his eyes to the sensations and started making the sweetest little noises in the back of his throat, John was with him in a way he wouldn't have been with anyone else performing this act. John was grabbing at his hair, trying not to pull it out of his head with strong, capable hands or shove himself too hard down Sherlock's throat, choking him to death. Sherlock could think of worse ways to go, if he was honest.
"She's called Willa," Sherlock blurted, taking copious mental notes about what Lestrade was doing to make her sound so happy. "She's named for me."
"Good thing it's a light colour." The last couple of buttons were still fastened over Sherlock's lower belly and abdomen, cock so hard it hovered over it, but pre-ejaculate connecting the head to a little pool on it with a gossamer string.
"Please." With yet another great, heaving sigh, he returned, avoiding looking into Sherlock's face. Sherlock shut the door behind him and locked it before leaning against it, watching John look out of the sitting room's right hand window. "I... I don't know how else to do things," he admitted. John turned at that but still didn't look at him. "I need data, information, concrete facts."
John kept looking briefly up at his other, trying to asses whether or not Sherlock was being upset as it was the last thing John wanted to do. Sherlock's face was frustratingly blank as murmured comforts slipped mechanically from those shapely lips. He'd remained on the couch, only slid forward to sit on it properly and having her use his legs to lean on now that she'd turned around. Sherlock had previously approved the story, as far as John remembered, but had in the past always complained about how much John romanticized him. It was considerably more stressful to believe that some things were alright in certain situations but still be unsure. He hadn't time to work out his own heart at the moment as he had two others on which to focus. Sherlock facilitated the whole thing by giving him a genuine, reassuring grin, despite the potential tragedy unfolding before him. He could tell Sherlock knew something was wrong.
"It's a different world out there in a desert wasteland of a war zone. There were extremely few women and they were in separate areas most of the time. The number was halved by the dead and those that got up the duff simply because we didn't really have the luxury of birth control and everyone was lonely and upset." It was difficult for Sherlock to be offended when it was something associated with such a painful time in John's life, but he was nothing if not clever and managed it just fine. Especially when John continued with a casual sniff, "No, I'm not gay. I don't even consider myself bisexual because even when doing that in Afghanistan, I had to picture women."
"You lads will be the death of me," she complained, accepting John's hurried cheek peck before making her way into position.
"Alright, Einstein, I'll leave it," John smirked, acknowledging how he didn't call her 'it' as he would if he was completely separating himself from the experience. However he was dissatisfied that it wasn't the entire explanation. Something else was up, though the signs were extremely subtle. Well subtle for most others.
"You wouldn't be you without some sort of official experiment having to do with every aspect of your life," John smiled fondly. "Even that."
"Do you understand what's happening?" John had always explained everything as simply as he could to her, no matter how uncomfortable the topic. In turn he had a virtually fearless yet somehow extremely empathetic child.
"They've... never even met me. They weren't even at Sherlock's funeral. Of course we know why now, but still." He absently took Mycroft's coat and ever-present umbrella to hang on hooks by the door.
He came to the conclusion that if it was this bad when just pretending, a real relationship of this nature with Sherlock would be disastrous. John would probably lose his usefulness, unable to get anything accomplished with thoughts of romantic interludes constantly spreading to and stretching every corner of his mind.  He couldn't even fathom what taking Sherlock to bed would be like. Well, he could(more often than usual that week)but he'd never really know. He had to concentrate on being able to make a clean break when this was finished, somehow going back to how it was before. In theory it should have been easy, but he'd always been known as the heart of their partnership, unable to logic his way out of sentiment as easily as the mind bit.
"What? Why me?" Sherlock steeled himself with a deep breath and looked back into eyes as wide and deep as the ocean.
They walked to the lifts as carefully as possible, barely brushing arms, but fell on each other as soon as the doors began to close. He thought to at least mention the cameras most likely present, but Sherlock's declaration that cited how the figurative meter with which he measured his ability to provide metaphorical congress was no longer operational, easily pushed any negativity out of John's mind. It wasn't as if they had their cocks out or anything, though before they got to their door, it was an extremely near thing, the way his was straining against his flies. He noticed Sherlock in the same predicament, and took special note of how his kisses grew impossibly deeper when several others from the reunion showed on their floor. Sherlock fumbled with the key card and bundled him into the room as they attempted to quiet their giggles between kisses, John grabbing the front of the man's expensive shirt and yanking him inside. The consulting detective then allowed a few more seconds, during which the new and titillating element of grinding a bit was implemented, before breaking off to make his way to the bedroom whilst John retrieved a few £10 water bottles. What the hell, this was all on Mycroft anyways.
"Sherlock. Please." For reasons that no mere mortal could understand, Sherlock pulled out his mobile and asked if she'd like her photo taken with John. She eagerly complied and after, Sherlock himself helped her back to her seat. She opened one of several canvas hold-all bags which bore the school crest and were displayed on the table, and extracted a booklet. She produced a yellow highlighter and flipped through the pages, explaining that the booklet contained everyone's contact information before highlighting her own.
He fought the urge to thrust with the heaving instructions coming from somewhere close above him telling him not to move. He distracted himself with the bit of milky skin and sparse chest hairs before him, mouthing at them, and re-positioning his hands so that his thumbs could brush the nipples as well as lightly tease the main areas. "
"The way you're moving, you're still trying to hide how much you're aching. Therefore you must have done some sparring," he noted. "So what did you learn?"
But John was still... confused? Yes. Sherlock had actually seen this look on his friend several times, and not just in his mind's eye. Of course John would never do anything about it. Despite his ability to acquire it, he wasn't really one for casual sex as a personal choice. Sherlock knew John wasn't gay, but, according to some of the things he saw when he was bored and alone and hacked John's private journal, out there, in the middle of all that war, dividers were broken down. They had to be, because whenever they rose again, so did other problems. The easiest thing for everyone was to, whenever and however they could manage, eliminate them for a brief moment's peace. Whether it was a cigar and whisky saturated card game with people that possibly didn't speak the same language, or an orgasm at the hands(or mouth)of a living, breathing person other than one's self.
"Neither am I." Finally, Sherlock understood and dismissed it completely for being too simple for him to pay any further attention to.
"I... Sherlock," John propped himself up on his left elbow to look down at him, his hair even more hopelessly, adorably disheveled, "I just don't want you to feel obligated to-"
"You told me about a younger man you met in the pub two nights ago. Mentioned some regrets over how fit you used to be. Not difficult to assume you'd discussed his regime and, as you love a good bargain judging by your almost comical fashion sense, there had to have been a military discount for you to even consider it. The closing factor for you was that the place is frequented and staffed by military personnel. You were right at home."
"Your conditions are completely understandable as well as acceptable. If you lost your peace of mind, I'm sure we would all suffer greatly." John bluntly nodded once. "There are six weeks left in the renovation of Baker Street to accommodate our new addition as well as bolster your confidence a bit in the security measures being taken. Until such time as they are complete, you may stay here or at a hotel in London if you can't bear to be away for any longer."
"Perhaps, but is that not part of a relationship? Especially one in which sexual activity is implied?"
"I'm sorry?" Sherlock almost never just asked, but this situation was getting away from him and he wouldn't have it.
"Oh, Mrs. Hudson is already disturbed," Sherlock said matter-of-factly. John had to stop in the middle of pouring so he wouldn't spill everything for the boyish laughter they burst out into. It was sort of the way of their relationship, now, more than ever, a constant flux of rising tension and the breaking of it. "I'll meet you up there," John said, once they'd calmed a bit.
"I did a little experiment in university where I had applicants for a study I was doing on what ingesting certain things would do to the flavour, texture and smell of semen. So I had these blokes over to my dormitory room and-"
He told Lestrade in order to hurry the process along. John was nothing if not inspirational and, right now, Sherlock was running low on that. But asking his lover incessantly how to prove himself would probably annoy his oft-irritated... boyfriend? Is that what he was now? He'd have to work out what they'd call themselves at a later date.
"I read somewhere while we were preparing, that an engagement and/or wedding gift is often exchanged. I thought of what I would give you in this position and wanted something... unique."
John opened his own shirt the rest of the way and slid it partially off his shoulders, for once not thinking about his bullet wound. He undid the rest of Sherlock's buttons as well, pushing aside the soiled flaps and using his tongue to clean up the rest, lingering on Sherlock's neck moles as the man continued to writhe and mewl in a most enticing manner. He kissed and licked and gently brushed wet curls back from Sherlock's reddened face, not quite reaching it for a kiss he desperately wanted.
"Besides," John tried to find something, anything that would lighten the mood, as this was dangerously close to pain, "you know of the two of us, people would be much more interested in you."
"You are an absolute menace, Sherlock Holmes," John murmured, staring at his face and running his hand tenderly along the side of it.
He had John roll over onto his back, and it was then that he got his first eyeful of John's torso. He looked up at his face and saw that John was going away again, becoming embarrassed about his scar and, if the new health kick was to be believed, probably his weight, though he was perfect. He was stocky and soft and firm in all the right places. Also his scar, all of them really, were just the thing. Sherlock could spend hours on
"They don't need you at the surgery today, if you don't feel like going in. Which is just as well. There's an obligation I must fulfill for Mycroft and it promises to be perfectly boring. At least if you're there, I'll have someone to talk to." John took up his phone at this point and began scrolling through it as if he'd be able to tell how Sherlock once again circumnavigated not only his password, but his fingerprint identification. He gave up almost immediately and just checked other messages, glancing intermittently over at his flatmate who was going through his own phone.
"Mind palace agreement doesn't count, you know that!" He nearly bowled over Mrs. Hudson coming out to see what all the commotion was about. John swiftly tugged her into her flat and locked the door behind them. He tucked the foot in the freezer before their landlady saw what it was and silently hushed her with a finger to his lips. There were scratching noises at the front door but John knew his best mate, waiting until he heard the direction of quiet footsteps, though the scratching continued. He looked at his watch before very quietly instructing Mrs. Hudson to wait exactly two minutes after he'd closed the front door, then yank the back door open.
He convinced John to wash again(slowly)by way of a shower whilst he watched, and couldn't help stroking himself to the vision of him, rubbing soap all over his gorgeous body. That body brought Sherlock back up and over the brink and he begged a kiss before rinsing quickly and following him out.
In fact, everything about him at first seemed to be under his complete control and John knew Sherlock did that on purpose. He knew a uniform when he saw one, despite its non-traditional aspect. Everything that Sherlock had that was opposite to him turned out to be a compliment. The yin to his yang, their similarities and differences fit together seamlessly to make a whole, the base aspect of one central to the other.
written in beautiful calligraphy on the cover. Where the mirror used to be over the fire place now hung their wedding portrait. It was this on which his eyes lingered.
"You can't resist me," Sherlock smirked. They got out of the back seat both using the doors this time and got back to their original places.
"Hm. I suppose it is," John said, leaning against the door frame in order to observe Sherlock as he did whenever he got the opportunity. "But that's not where I got it from. It's quite normal, as far as pet names go." Sherlock looked at him then, eyes uncertain. Or perhaps John was the one unable to decipher what they meant. The taller man got off of the bed, shed his jacket, and went to stare at his reflection in the full-length mirror, touching his face in various places as if trying to determine any porcine similarities. "Look, I'll stop calling you that if you like; well I'll try, anyway. But can't you just... logic your way out of being offended or something? I mean if you are offended, that is." John, who had kicked off his shoes as soon as he crossed the room's main threshold, went up behind him and wrapped his arms about his waist from behind. "You clearly aren't a pig. It's a wonder I can get anything into you sometimes." He lay his lips on Sherlock's shoulder as he looked over it, the heat of him clear through the shirt material and loving the seemingly unwitting little smile that broke out on Sherlock's face. Sherlock turned to his right and John came around so they could face each other for a proper kiss that got impossibly deeper when they caught each other peeking at themselves in the mirror. John moved him toward the bed and lay with him on it, touching his face and lightly tracing his beautiful lips with a thumb.
He had to have his full attention, however. "John?" The name rolled off of his tongue as easily as anything. If it were possible for a word to taste good, it would be John's name.
"Do friends not flatshare and go into business together?" John crossed his arms and pursed and unpursed his lips a couple of times before lightly clearing his throat.
He'd had some drinks that day, but even with the two large ones in a row minutes before, it was barely enough to do anything other than lower his inhibitions a bit further, make him think, surprisingly, a bit more clearly. Except for when he had Sherlock's tongue in his mouth and the fingers of his right hand tangled in Sherlock's curls and their free hands on each other's pricks. Only the basest of thoughts survived in this state at first,
doing much better." Sherlock noticed that, more often, John always threw in a kind word. "I'm just... I'm just giving you permission now. And it's on a case by case basis, so don't think this is how you're to behave all the time." They looked at each other for a long moment before Sherlock finally took the seat opposite, finding a bit of comfort in clearing the area between them of his work as he began speaking, keeping one eye on John's lovely, healing hands as they fiddled with the grain of the wood and stealing glances at Sherlock's face.
"Come back in here," Sherlock said, not meaning for it to sound like so much of a command. He was toting his jumper, his sleeves still rolled up, jeans covered in ingredients. He looked like that suburban dad who, at first glance, made those who didn't know what to look for wonder how he had seven kids with his supermodel wife. It was unreasonably attractive.
"You're a difficult man to find, doctor Watson." He brushed a bit of unseen dirt off of his lapel with an imperious expression.
." His tone was dour but the look Sherlock gave him was heartbreaking. "It just shouldn't have been like that," he repeated. "I should have taken you with me."
"I've enough room for the both of us I think," he said, frowning briefly into the distance as the phrase sounded like innuendo, but not quite. Sherlock turned to him, following his far off eyeline. Without thinking about it, his eyes had settled on Margie, who was asking a question of a taller woman in a striking deep blue dress.
"I'm hardly doing anything," John said soothingly, sitting up as Sherlock resumed properly impaling himself over and over again. "You're doing all the hard work."
"I need a shower." He got to his feet and pulled his bottoms up before retrieving his dressing gown as John watched from a sitting position that had his knees drawn up to his chest. He looked like a photograph or a painting, nude but covered precisely by his positioning, hair wild. He pulled John by the hand to his feet and made a great show of looking him over appreciatively whilst helping him back on with his soiled work out clothes, forcing John's eyes back to his face whenever he would look away, embarrassed by something on which Sherlock's eyes lingered.
"You had your reasons. I made peace with that long ago. You didn't leave me to leave me, you left to protect me from something."
"Sherlock..." he whispered, but was unable to do anything else other than hold him more tightly and press their foreheads together.
"So I have to officially say the words or it doesn't count?" He was just teasing at this point and felt an abiding guilt at Sherlock's near panicked expression.
"In one place in the world or another. Pay attention, John." Good 'ol Sherlock, confusing and degrading him for being confused by his cryptic and often unnecessarily complicated talk. "One of my experiments was to have people from all around the world. Like what you have a reputation for with your old Army mates."
"You're still defining yourself according to someone else," Sherlock explained, closing his laptop and standing to gaze into the mirror above the fireplace, cold for the mild, dry weather. "You are saying, however unintentionally, that you're only not gay because your sister is." John felt his eyes on him for a moment before he looked up to see Sherlock's usual Mask Of Analysis. "Is the problem that people think you're gay, or that you're with me?" Sherlock continued to surprise him with the unusual subtlety of his probing questions. Well, subtle for the consulting detective, anyways. This was, to date, not only the strangest conversation they'd ever had, but the most emotionally based. John supposed it wasn't weird that it was... well... weird.
"Really? What branch?" John queried, trying his best not to see what Sherlock was doing behind him after plucking his gun from his hands and putting it back in its spot in secret.
"Funny," John pondered, glad that their words were clearing a bit. "I always wanted to be a doctor and a soldier." Sherlock paused to search his countenance on his way back to his now established spot.
"Well if I'm doing this, it would be fine for you to help yourself. It's only fair." Before his surprise at the statement could register on his face, John took himself in hand with long, extremely slow strokes, a sound of slight relief coming out of his mouth as he did so. Both of them were leaking at this point and John used his as lubrication, adding a bit of saliva for perfect friction. Once he was steadily stroking, Sherlock continued talking to him, speaking as if his only purpose was to make him orgasm. It was all so surreal. "You want to fuck me, don't you John?" Yes.
"It's not that you're necessarily attracted. You just like to see anyone being pleasured," he stated.
"Right. Well we'll have to do this in my bedroom. There's more bare floor and we won't disturb Mrs. Hudson."
Sherlock would steal kisses, backing John up against a wall in a secluded area and kissing him breathless before leading him back into the fray. The problem with sex, Sherlock had explained in a low voice as his parents were occupied with their daughter, was that the more one had it, the more one wanted it. At one point, they had managed to go just short of an orgasm and struggled to compose themselves before rejoining the group. All seemed fine until the doting grandparents agreed that, when it came to child-rearing, parents needed to have a proper rest sometimes to keep their batteries charged. They volunteered to take the littlest Holmes back to town after breakfast the next day and encourage everyone else to accompany them. All day.
"Yep," John nodded slowly. Too fast would have made the room spin, yet holding onto Sherlock's head, staring into his remarkably jeweled eyes, grounded him and made it worse all at once. "You are the most brilliant, clever, beautiful hearted man I've ever known. If you consent to be my husband, I'll swear on anything you hold dear to spend the rest of my life, trying as hard as I can to be worthy of you."
"No. I'm just sorry so much time was wasted." John could hardly breathe for Sherlock's eyes on him in that soft manner, his ample brow furrowed as he concentrated. He fought the urge to cross his arms, allowing Sherlock to look his fill. "Your Work is going to be pissed you cheated." John briefly arched an eyebrow and kept from smiling at his joke by the skin of his teeth.
"You're not drinking your water," he said lightly, though his tongue was a bit too big for his mouth. He decided, in his rather slowed mind, that it would probably be more easily contained if shared between two mouths. John pushed the little pain relief pills between those shapely pink lips, took a long pull off of his water bottle, and lowered his mouth onto Sherlock's. Once their lips were properly sealed together, he slowly pushed the water into Sherlock's mouth until his tongue was in there and the water, pills and all were swallowed. With another deep kiss, he sat back a bit, satisfied with Sherlock's erection indicator going off, and pulled the silver chain, the only other thing John wore besides pants, from around his neck over his head. He looped it over Sherlock's and indulged in digging into the raven coils and waves for a bit whilst he kissed him once more.
"A bit young, aren't they?" was all he could come up with after scrolling through a few, all of whom looked like virtual teen-agers to him. He leaned over to hand the computer back.
"You say you're not gay but that surely wasn't the first time you've done that," he stated. The fellatio had been rather devastating for someone who was a self-proclaimed (rather shouty) heterosexual.
"Oh, right." John's eyebrows suddenly shot up into his hairline once he realized what Sherlock was talking about. "Oh!"
"Huh." John then sighed, relieved though the dash of disappointment remained for whatever reason. "I should have known you weren't actually drunk or didn't beg," he grinned up at him.
"Point taken," Sherlock apologised before giving John a coy look then baring his throat. It was somehow just the right thing, as John dug his teeth into it almost savagely, at the last minute pulling back enough to just suck hard. Sherlock's gutteral utterances only served to encourage him, though that was the only actual mark left. Although there was still no venture into the penetration bit, there was still plenty of involuntary swearing. Well, it was at first as far as Sherlock was concerned, but he found it urged John to higher passion and experimented with which words applied where in what voice seemed to do the most for his libido.
"You have my word, remember, John," Mycroft reminded him. He nodded stiffly, he and Sherlock each receiving a sweet kiss for their trouble. Sherlock looked back and forth between his brother and John but stayed quiet. John knew he was just now noticing the shift in his brother's relationship with John. "Now, as to the child's future-"
limp and sense of impending doom. All after maybe ten minutes altogether in two days in the man's rather dramatic presence. John had let him use his phone and the rest, as they say, was history.
"No more than anyone would be hurt in the situation without having any information." John approached him very slowly, cautiously.
No, that was too cheesy even for him. John racked his not inconsiderable mind for an opening to the blog post this little adventure would produce. He didn't embellish, as his best/flatmate enjoyed accusing him of doing. He just winnowed the pile of information, leaving the interesting grain whilst letting the chaff blow away. The chaff often included petty arguments, slightly illegal activity, and certain mistakes, such as the huge one he made getting into a hire car with Sherlock Holmes in the dead of Winter, during a snowstorm. They were far from the meager dusting London was getting and John was pretty convinced they'd ended up somewhere between the North Pole and the ice planet of Hoth.
The next few weeks were a plethora of experiments John just... allowed to happen, at this point. None of them hurt or were too embarrassing, as they were only pretending. The tests and adjustments were conducted mostly in the flat, but sometimes, when they were walking somewhere, Sherlock would reach out and give his hand a squeeze, without even stopping whatever he was saying or not saying anything at all. After a while, John began reciprocating, behaving as he would in any relationship. He would playfully call Sherlock 'Babe', pet names a thing in which Sherlock refused to participate at first. However, once that initial(rather posh)'Darling' slipped out, it was established as John's title. Though, if he was to be completely honest with himself, the way Sherlock just said his name in different situations would convey, at least to him, a plethora of different emotions. At the moment, within their play, it was as good as any 'luv' or 'dear' or 'sweetheart'. The 'Darling' became that much more special because of it actually being said.
"Really? Don't think that just because I'm not as skilled as you are, that I don't notice things, especially when it comes to you."
The box contained loads of padding of the air-filled plastic variety and a large, heavy wooden box, lightly finished and carved with some sort of crest he only recognised vaguely as his family's. 'Watson' being written on the scroll beneath helped tremendously, yet he vaguely recalled from childhood, the hands holding the tree branches as well as the family motto
"John please!" He'd smelled it earlier, and dismissed it as a side effect. But no. The hint of smoke, the tang of alcohol... It explained the extra grooming. John had been out, probably with Lestrade, drinking, and had come home, not too long ago still a bit tipsy. That's when the rest of everything went South. Literally.
"What did you expect us to do? Sherlock I... Of course I still..." Oh God not the tears. John cleared his throat and tried again. "You almost took me with you. I almost died with you. I almost.... to be with you I nearly..." Sherlock pushed himself between John's thighs and slid his arms around his waist, resting his head just above his right pectoral. John held on tightly, willing the tears back down as they ached in his throat. "If I didn't still care, I wouldn't have been so angry. You just needed to be patient with me, which, truth be told, isn't your strong suit."
"I can walk, thank you." John shrugged at Sherlock's rather panicked, questioning look. John could tell he was already wondering why she didn't like him anymore all of a sudden and was this normal behaviour for her. Willa was pretty independent as far as getting around went, her pushchair more of a rolling storage unit, impromptu napping quarters, and exercise equipment since she first attempted to learn walking. She comforted her Papa immediately by slipping her tiny hand into Sherlock's to be lead out of the room, pausing only to let John open the door for them first. She released Sherlock's hand in order to approach Lestrade on her own.
"Sherlock," he warned. Sherlock was quiet a moment longer, searching John's face, then sighed and pulled him aside. "What is it really?" He tried again. "You've been off ever since you told me we didn't really..." Sherlock opened and closed his mouth as he did whenever he attempted to discuss anything sentiment-related. John took pity, as usual. He took a lanky, yet muscular arm and leaned in to make sure he was heard. "Do you think I didn't want you?" Sherlock confirmed by closing his mouth once more and keeping it that way as he looked off to the side, hands somehow shoved in the pockets of his rather closely fitting trousers. If John could see clearly under the whirling coloured lights, he would have known for sure that Sherlock was blushing instead of just speculating. For now, he just pictured it, as it was a rare and sweet image. "Sherlock, to be honest I have never been so turned on. Especially by a bloke."
Loving Sherlock Holmes was not for the faint of heart. Discounting the more enjoyable bits, it was basically measured in an endless mountain range of frustration. The good parts were an early Summer stroll about the base, all serenity and surrounded by the natural order of things, which always included a defined, yet chaotic trail for balance, in the form of a surprise experiment in the bath, or the adrenaline rush of playing The Game. Sometimes, however, Sherlock would lead him to a series of crags, shoving him farther and farther up to the pinnacle and either unable to see(fat chance), or ignoring the increased agitation in him. The joke seemed to be on John, however, because he still needed Sherlock to be able to breathe. Not for the first time that trip, he considered seeing a therapist more regularly to try and suss out why that was and, yet again, he dismissed the thought. Why they worked didn't matter. They just did.
"And I you, if I'm honest. You saying you're not proud of it implies it just sort of happened. The begging bit, I mean. It was rather... yeah."
"Of course. Three marriages won't ever change my name. Sherlock Holmes. So glad to finally meet you. You and your partner are the talk of the town. I do keep up with English news despite my residence." Aside from a glance at the wall then a rather briny sweep of the eyes over her form, Sherlock was a perfect gentleman, though John felt plenty of tension coming from his direction. He even spoke a bit of French with her and John smiled and nodded politely as he often did when it was being spoken so rapidly. He just hoped Sherlock wasn't using the language to hide being awful to her while at the same time being quite sure he was.
The funniest thing was that Sherlock was laughing along with John after the line was uttered. The majority of the film's elements were abhorrent, but John...
"Come along, John," he called as he moved swiftly through the sitting room as he completed the look with a black leather bomber as opposed to his now more recognizable Belstaff.
"You're thinking too loudly," it complained. "This is simply an attempt to become more comfortable with being in closer than usual proximity." The next bit was slightly distorted by a yawn. "If we're going to be a convincing couple, that is."
"Because it was obviously the first time you felt safe enough to properly rest in a long time. Everyone in this house understands that. You're up now, however, and I'm told there's to be a grand spread for lunch. I'm sure you're hungry."
"Of course I did! I've tried everything and apparently it just has to... run its course or whatever."
He lay his forehead on Sherlock's chest for a moment, just trying to catch his breath before exchanging with him a coveted kiss that was sheer perfection despite it being so undoubtedly out of order. Despite all they'd just done, it was the kiss that actually sealed his fate. It was the point of no return. Any modicum of a delusion of possible reconciliation, let alone being with anyone else ever that may have been left over, was obliterated entirely by that kiss. His caregiver mode kicked in, having him locate the spare handcuff key Sherlock always had on him in some place people usually passed over when searching and releasing him. He briefly massaged the man's arms and hands, pointedly avoiding the pit area. Even when he got close, Sherlock's spent penis, soldier that it was, made a tiny jerk. He buttoned Sherlock's shirt and, with much effort, moved to be able to pull his trousers and pants back up. Only when Sherlock was completely set to rights, only moving minimally to help until John replaced the cushion and had him lay back down on the bench, did he work on himself. Then he was back to his own original position. The coolness of the wall even more welcome. What had even happened? Was this some sort of surreal dream? All he knew was that, if it was a dream, he hadn't gotten
"Obviously." John had a difficult time hiding his smirk when he was about to chastise her for being rude. "I'm sorry, Daddy, but it really is." Then Mycroft...
"Oh yes, loads of hair. No idea where it came from. I was told my maternal great, great grandmother and her siblings had a lot of it." As she went on, distracting herself with her genetic pondering, John quickly ordered more of the easier to clean plastic cloths to be put on the floor in front of the sofa as well as a clean sheet, an unused tablecloth, and some fresh bath towels that were to remain on hand.
"Between that and the... prom-themed dance we'll have a few hours of free time, during which I've booked us appointments in the spa. We're going to be seen as spoiling each other."
"Champagne and chocolate glazed strawberries, Dr. Watson, courtesy of the new parents," he announced with a flourish, removing the metal dome in the same manner. As Sherlock examined the fare as well as the cart for reasons that were his own, the champagne was opened and poured. "May I say you do great things, sir. The two of you do."
"Yeah. God yeah," came the reply before he could properly think. They were already going further than ever and they were more than under the influence. The basement of influence. The
"Oh God, please don't." There was an epic sigh and a legendary eye roll, but Sherlock, interestingly enough didn't move from under his kneading hands.
"I, uh..." He wasn't prepared for that, but, they did know about the child and it was just like the two of them to assume he'd return. Who was he kidding? Somewhere, deep down, he also assumed he'd return somehow. "You'll have to ask your brother about that." The man in question had calmed down by now, Greg still chuckling and wiping his eyes.
John pressed the round red 'end call' button on his mobile screen and lay it down on the little tea table next to his chair as he stared across at his husband of five years as of that past May, who was nervously playing with his lush bottom lip. He stood to look at their collection of romantic memorabilia. There was the prom photo and, on the other side of his antique pistol, a copy of their wedding invite, '
As they lay with the sheet draped loosely over their cooling bodies, limbs tangled, John contemplated the madness that was not only the past few weeks, but their entire life. He had a thousand questions, but very few seemed important enough to actually ask just then. He wanted to know precisely when Sherlock first fell for him, or at least realised it, because it was certainly long before this particular adventure, if memory served as to how he behaved toward someone he had more than platonic feelings for. He wanted to know if Sherlock was actually attempting a seduction or if he was just planning on never doing anything about it. Most likely the latter, going by his track record regarding emotional entanglements. Above all, he wanted to know what exactly Sherlock saw in the older, greying, broken ex-soldier, and if he knew that he'd saved John's life, for what it was worth, just as much, if not more than he talked of John saving his...
. His compact firebrand of a flatmate and best friend, who, while looking like a school teacher in one of his horrid jumpers and rather well-fitting jeans, could take someone three times his size down with his bare hands, let alone a bullet from far away. His dark blue eyes would focus precisely, his scrupulous hand steady as he took aim and he would squeeze the trigger almost nonchalantly. Once, when they'd gotten captured and stripped down to their underclothes, John made good on a promise to render one of their guards unconscious for backhanding Sherlock. In nothing but a cotton tank top and a pair of alarmingly red Y-fronts("I hadn't any other's clean and got interrupted during the laundry, if you recall, Sherlock"), he choked the man out as Sherlock procured the keys to the makeshift cell. John didn't stop until the man went pliant, his biceps and face straining to keep pressure in the correct place and -
"You were so relieved," Sherlock contested, tone uncharacteristically unsure. John couldn't help but slip his right arm around the narrow waist and use his left to direct those eyes back to his. They only lighted a few times, returning to their uncertain route around the room.
John watched the rather textbook show of the stages of grief play out right before him. He turned on the interior light, fog obscuring the falling snow outside, and basked in the 'No no you can't do this to me's. He then let the string of expletives and berating pour over him like a refreshing wave of cool water after an afternoon of manual labour in the sun. Sherlock's speech turned into the sticky sweet tone of bargaining, begging that he would try harder to control himself if John would '
John basically dragged them through the spa visit which, but for the way Sherlock's attitude about being pampered in that instance had changed oddly for the worse, was incredibly rejuvenating. Especially after the nap the massage brought on. The consulting detective's poor attitude continued through dressing for the prom-themed dinner dance. Their tuxedos matched in all but the velour jacket colour. John's was a decadent blue, darker than even the shirt he wore that day, and Sherlock's was the colour of de-oxygenated blood, a deep blue-based red. Their lapels, trim, slacks, bow tie and shoes were black, whilst their shirts a crisp white. The ensemble was another 'gift' from Sherlock 'for keeping up appearances'. Regardless of Sherlock's pouting, John caught him looking several times as he stood in the full length mirror arranging his jacket and his now more silver than gold hair so it fell just so. John wasn't subtle at all about his admiration.
He did most of the talking, Sherlock taking his cues to murmur into his ear when he had something to ask and playing the perfect support companion. He didn't even miss a beat when Sherlock was referred to as 'Billy', remembering his legal first name was William. John was quite the wonder to observe, putting everything he'd learned combined with everything he already knew into full effect. Even Sherlock was almost convinced that, when they left, it would be in a rush to get him home, into bed, and thoroughly ravished.
"It's not!" He grabbed two fist fulls of black curls and sat hard on the side of the bed. John sighed and sucked his teeth, feeling a little guilty for joking around when the man was obviously so upset. "I... left you. I left you alone."
"Yes, sir." Her legs were going before she was set down again, in her usual manner, and she bolted off through the adjoining door.
"I hope so," was all John said, and they quietly held each other until his backside began numbing even in the plush rug that had been under the bed to save the wood floors. Also,
"John, how is it a punishment to give me the public sex you've been aware I've so desperately been wanting?" he asked in that endearingly little shit way he had.
"I'm enjoying it where it is at the moment," he smirked. Two could play at that game. Without another thought, John went through with gathering what he needed, avoiding looking, but feeling Sherlock watching so very intently. John made especially sure to look underneath things, with his arse, clothed only in thin cotton material, pointed directly at his lover. He had to get around him to reach the chair on which his jeans were laying, just happening to brush his hand over Sherlock's hip or crotch. John kept it up until, finally, Sherlock turned his head away and thrust the dressing gown at him. He didn't want to leave, just was apparently not having as easy a time as he thought he would, resisting John's form. John accused him of being embarrassed. Sherlock informed him, that at bedtime, he would show John in no uncertain terms how embarrassed he was. He would in fact be showing John for the whole of the day, as soon as he got his sexy little arse in gear. John had to pause then.
However, when that was taken from him, despite the knowledge always in the back of his mind that it could happen with the situations in which he immersed himself, he was... well... lost. He drifted through life like a ghost, with daily contemplation on whether or not it was time to make himself into a real one. The only thing that kept him alive at that point was disappointing his Mum, though she'd been gone several years by then, the cancer he thought at first was so aggressive that she didn't even have time for options, actually having lived within her the whole time he was in. She just never told him or his sister, citing they had enough to worry about. All he had left by the time she went was a drunken Skype call from Harry, berating him for not being there, for insisting on having to be away from her and Mum. He could have helped her, she'd screamed at him. Logic dictated that of course he couldn't have done. Mum hadn't even said anything until it was too late. That didn't stop his heart from complete agreement with his sister.
"I was always extremely selective," he conceded. Always used condoms, my own needles, if they were required. Always had a home made miniature test kit with me. Drugs addicts aren't exactly the most reliable people." John couldn't control his shock, barely reigning in his horror at what he was being told. He was concerned his friend wouldn't confide in him again if he had any extreme reaction. Sherlock was still talking, however, seemingly oblivious to John's inner turmoil. He must have been fine with the way the conversation was going, but then again, John was hard pressed to dismiss the possibility that Sherlock knew exactly what he was thinking, and was just content with the response. Why did everything have to be so complicated? With all of these words, Sherlock hadn't even answered the question yet. This was the most personal information John had ever gotten out of his flat mate and it made his sentimental heart throb.
he said in a near perfect imitation of the man standing there. The truth. Mycroft rolled his eyes just as his brother and niece did.
"I don't have to." That statement, an echo of one in the beginning of their relationship, also talking about important emotional definitions, sobered them immensely. "There's also something else I'm not," John continued quickly.
"What? What is it?" Sherlock was only mildly irritated but, as John had blurted once, he was a drama queen. His brand new lover took it as such per the usual.
"A baker's dozen. I figured the extra ones would be good for experiments." John scrolled down the page a bit.
John knew Sherlock, knew his body, but not even all the patchwork and the past few weeks of above average intimacy revealed to him all he took the time to examine now. Every scar, mole, and hair served as a familiar marker as he mapped the mans body through cleansing it. He then allowed Sherlock to do the same, answering his anticipated questions including those he'd shielded John from at the reunion. Some answers had to be put off for another time, as they would corrupt what John was trying to do. He would reply to those with slow kisses, a language to which Sherlock adapted immediately.
Without missing a beat, John responded, "Which sounds practical on paper until you consider that these same people tend to think love is sexual arousal." He really was Sherlock's perfect match.
He shut his eyes and turned his head as John lifted the pillow, hearing a hitch in his breathing and a quiet, "Oh." John cleared his throat and he could feel him unable to take his eyes off of it in a way that superseded medical curiosity. That only served to further aggravate things. "Did you try a sedative?" he inquired, only a little tremor to the silken voice he used as a means of comforting his patients.
"I knew what you meant." John wasn't sure, but the other man sounded extremely disappointed. Probably at how John was just like everyone else and let sentiment get in the way of everything he wanted to do. John would take on the villain role if it meant he could keep his best friend.
Before that deadline, however, Sherlock reached across him and released his seat back so it fell to a much a wider angle. Before he could figure out what was going on, Sherlock had John's trousers open and his flaccid cock out through the slit of his pants. Well flaccid wasn't exactly correct. He frequently went to half mast when he was expressing passion toward Sherlock, his body not seeming to be able to differentiate between positive and negative emotion, only that his blood was up and Sherlock was interacting with him. Definitely more therapy because that didn't sound right at all.
to look after as, their association with him now actually did put them in danger. Dead or alive, it seemed. He was better off when his only real friend was the drugs. They were always there and they didn't pretend and their impending destruction, while it would be disappointing, it wouldn't cause him to fake his own death in order to save them. The whole thing caused him to make a disgusted sound.
"For science," Sherlock repeated as if it were a toast. It officially became one when they decided on a finger or two of a lovely single malt just after that.
"I don't care about the genitals either way," he continued, flood gates seemingly opened now, information pouring forth in a great deluge. "I just wanted to see and experience differences outside of pornographic fantasy. I think I still have the journal somewhere in the attic of my parent's house." John imagined that Sherlock, if he was anything like he was now, left behind a string of broken-hearted co-eds. He then had another rather sobering thought.
"And apparently I was always yours." John blinked at him, not really surprised. For Sherlock, to fall in love was the most inconvenient thing ever to happen to anyone. John understood. He really did. But it still hurt a little.
He should have known better than to allow himself to go this far. He was an addict, and his current drug of choice was John Hamish Watson. He just had to figure out how to go directly back to 'normal' and never tell John.
"Of course I am," Sherlock almost spat. John smiled indulgently at him and, as he shut the little kit they kept in the kitchen for just such occasions, Sherlock grabbed his head in both hands and kissed him. Hard. John was a bit surprised at himself for not recoiling, as that's what he expected to do if that ever occurred in that manner. He was a bit stiff at first, but quickly relaxed and kissed Sherlock back the way he was supposed to. He let Sherlock end it, per his own MO, as he found that everything was more pleasant when his partner felt the most in control of the situation. "I... I've noticed," Sherlock explained, stuttering ever so slightly, "that every time you're about to kiss me on the mouth, you stop. I tried presenting you with increasingly thoughtful gestures thinking perhaps you'd forget yourself a bit and just go for it, as I know you prefer to initiate, but... no dice."
"You look gorgeous, Babe," he praised, Sherlock only responding with preening when John turned back to the mirror so as not to destroy his brooding image. John then went to stand in front of him for one last assessment, holding his hands out in presentation.
"How did you know what I'd been thinking about?" Sherlock's reply was a look from beneath his eyebrows that made John laugh. They took their seats, the other eight seats still empty. He looked over Sherlock's shoulder as he sent the photo and smiled, pressing a soft kiss to his jaw line.
do, but it won't kill you for me to keep some things to myself for a while. What if I want to... I dunno, throw you a surprise party or something." That garnered another round of sudden and acute scrutiny. Sherlock put his palms flat on the table as if the gesture gave him extra leverage to stare extra hard.
"You've been eating the tinned pineapples meant for Mrs. Hudson's cake," Sherlock blurted with a sigh and a low groan. John didn't stop, but he did prop the side of his head on his right palm in order to look down at Sherlock with a lazily puzzled expression. Sherlock knew he wanted more information but he'd be damned if he was going to just give it up so easily. He was still Sherlock Holmes. Instead, he reached into the beside table closest to him and extracted a bottle of lubricant filled to approximately the half-way mark. He applied it to the proper area and settled back to enjoy John touching him where, less than twenty-four hours before, he was only imagining it as he did it himself. That thought caused him to promptly open his eyes to confirm he wasn't still fantasizing it, and was satisfied enough to shut them again after seeing John was still there.
Yet another guard left his colleague at the door to lead them to a VIP booth, cleverly built so that one could be heard over the music when in conversation without having to speak too loudly. He was more than happy to demonstrate this feat of acoustic manipulation by asking John what he wanted to drink, and taking in his expression when he realized he'd heard him clearly.
"It means," John said slowly, "you're the only one in the world. I invented the identity." Sherlock had to look at him then. They gazed at each other for a moment then dissolved into mirth before they started kissing again. Sherlock supposed he shouldn't have been surprised that this was exactly like the rest of their relationship, all difficult and strange and adrenaline rushes.
