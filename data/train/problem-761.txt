“When did you get so wise? Last I remember, you wouldn’t be caught dead giving advice. Especially about romance.”
not able to fucking remember what the shots of alcohol were. Yet the number eight seems to be tattooed in the undersides of his eyelids, and eight shots of anything isn’t good.
I begin swirling coffee with the spoon. Be one with the coffee and the spoon. Maybe if I ignore this, it will all go away. Everything will go back to normal.
Sherlock’s mouth opens long enough to register his surprise before he closes it with a comical sound. Irene’s chuckles fill the room. He turns and opens the door once more, despite already knowing what he’ll find on the other side. This time, he opens the door marked number 29, and sure enough, as he steps through the doorway, the same lilac dressed room is there to greet him. Irene is in the same place, smiling serenely.
was, and now they’re back to normal? Well, at least as normal as they can be. Or is Sherlock expecting that to happen again? John’s not even sure which option is better, but they need to talk this through.
John hadn’t realised how much of his life was intertwined with the detective, and, for the first time, he wonders if that was part of the problem. He was with Sherlock twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. They worked together, lived together, slept together and everything in between. The most time John ever had to himself was the occasional drink with Greg, or the rare occasions Sherlock passed out before him.
Harry lives alone so John can shout at her without disrupting the peace of a partner. He plans on doing a fair bit of shouting because he decided on the very long and expensive trip back to his sister’s part of town that last night is just as much her fault as his.
“Done what before?”
John feels bowled over by the question. He thinks for a moment, very conscious of Harry watching him as he runs through all the times he witnessed Sherlock filing data within his mind palace and in the outside world.
Sherlock was babbling now, and he hated himself for that. He didn’t know how to formulate his sentences enough to tell John that he was going to come. A warning was needed for this, and yet his mind was offline and blissfully blank. He had forgotten how this felt, the blissful silence of his brain, rushing with dopamine and oxytocin. Each neuron was fluttering, focused only on the sensation of John’s mouth on his cock. Gone were the usual frenzy of thoughts, the constant barrage of information; useless deductions and errant case notes. His mind could relax, focused only on his army-doctor.
“Sher…” John panted, his eyes closed and mouth open. “God...wait...I want you to come too.”
Eventually, they break away; Sherlock’s lips and cheeks stained with a rosiness that looks extraordinary against his lily-white skin. God, how John’s entire body and soul loves this man, and he’s lucky enough to drift off to the vision of Sherlock sleeping right beside him.
“So, this script,” John begins, his tone casual. “Is this just like...a list of places that we’re going, or something more involved?”
Lestrade gives John a weary smile and places his hand on John’s shoulder.
“When have you had a concern about discussing food and wine preferences?”
Sherlock felt a heated curl of want creep within him, and he flicked his eyes to the back of the cab driver’s head before looking over to John once more.
Blindly, Sherlock reached into the bedside table, pulling out a small bottle of lube. He made a mental note to buy more as he squirted a generous amount over his fingers and palm, before grasping both of their cocks and stroking. Sherlock grinned when John let out a lewd chuckle and quickened the pace, his lips parting as his breathing increased.
Sherlock never thought that he could care about the solar system, but of course it takes John Watson to do it.
"And before you start," Sherlock continued, now facing John. "Sebastian Moran has been clean and sober for the last two years, hasn't ever been transmitted with anything more dangerous than a really bad case of hookworms - though that's more out of dumb luck than his virtue -  and just so happens to be the way for you to get into that exclusive sex club. He has also saved my life twice since I've known him."
“Okay.” The sofa would be a great place to segue into something more physical, and at least this way, both of them would be happy. John would have the pleasure of release, and Sherlock would have a few hours to himself to retreat into his mind palace and find something he’d missed.
Sherlock predicted Lestrade’s eye roll before it happened, although the sigh of frustration before the DI rose to his feet was a surprise. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant one, since Lestrade moved away enough for Sherlock to continue his work in relative peace. A small victory, but a victory all the same.
He was slipping. He was distracted — so much so that he’d missed a vital clue. How could he be so stupid?
This question was a little more tricky. Yes,
They fell into their own sort of routine, and it was lovely. John would place medical books or bags from Tesco’s on the table. His head bowed as he’d read and took bites of whatever Mrs. Hudson put next to him. Every once in a while John would glance up to notice Martha looking at him and he’d smile back. The circles under his eyes wouldn’t fade away completely, but enough for Martha to stop texting Greg as often as she did. Instead, she would use the time that John was away to pull out old books that Sherlock had given her over the years. Old and dusty and he had claimed were still important enough to keep safe, but not important enough to keep on his already overstuffed bookcases.
“What...what are you doing?” Molly eventually asks, still standing in the kitchen doorway, frozen with disbelief. She slowly makes her way to the basket, warily inspecting its contents, her mouth falling open at the artisan items inside. “Gorau Glas? That’s almost £60 a kilo!” She exclaims.
was dimly lit but very busy considering it was nearly ten pm, with a tough crowd of people. Mostly bikers with the occasional seedier bloke, but nothing that Lestrade couldn’t handle. Plus, the pints were good and cheap. Once they were by themselves at the table, Greg leaned over to John.
“Hey there,” Leah says happily as she opens the back door and slides into the cab. Her styled hair and makeup make her appear slightly younger than when she is in her hospital scrubs, and to John’s slight relief, even more approachable.
“So is this how it is now?” she asked, the tone unnervingly innocent. “Trading one favour for another until we either end up bored or dead? Seems a trite fatalistic.”
that was able to do or say something that granted her a small peek inside that warmth of him. The tiny glimpses into the sunny glow of what happened when he forgot about Sherlock Holmes. Never more than a passing moment or two. Mary realized that she would never be that lucky. Sherlock would always be there. Lingering around the embers of John's bandaged soul. Whether the mere memory of him was what was keeping him going was something that Mary would wonder as she watched John sleep.
Sherlock nodded, his brain running over him and John. Should they make the effort? Do something different once the Work stopped calling? But the Work was always calling, for one of them.
“You don’t owe me an explanation, Sherlock. I’m sorry I snapped at you at all. I’m...taking a shower. I’ll see you in the morning, yeah?” John nodded as if he needed to assure himself of this. Sherlock’s chest tightened. “Yeah,” John repeated. “The morning.”
“That robbery was an inside job,” Sherlock mumbles, his body relaxing further into his chair. “Barely a level two, John. No. This is about a forgery in High Wycombe. Lestrade texted me about it earlier today.”
“Initial misgivings?”
“Because...it shouldn’t be this cut and dry, yeah? I mean, do you want to stay friends?”
“Knew knocking wasn’t your style,” John muttered as he threw his coat down towards the nearest chair. “But surprised by an
He glances back at John before looking into the mirror again, then bites his bottom lip before giving them a tentative flap.
value your opinion you’re still angry. What the hell do you want from me, John?” Sherlock asks, waving his hand through the air, his face tightly pinched with frustration.
John stares at his sister. Maybe this is still the doppelgänger after all.
Where is this coming from? Yesterday, they could barely stand to be in the same room as each other, and now they’re making tea and cracking jokes? John sips warily, his eyes flickering over every inch of the detective, trying to figure out what is different. It can’t  have been that simple — one unintended declaration of love and everything was back to normal. John had been up half the night imagining the worst scenarios — Sherlock asking him to move out, or calling an end to this attempt at friendship. His mind had conjured up every situation possible, anticipated every argument, yet he hadn’t considered this.
let another cock touch him again? You are sleeping with
“Shut up,” Sherlock smiles warmly into his mug.
“The first bar, then. Let’s go.”
However, there is a limit to everything.
“Well, this time was evidently different, and...he knows. About us.”  Sherlock frowns and turns back to the files. It feels partly like their break up all over again, and the sick feeling is returning to John’s stomach.  “Did you tell him?”
Sherlock reacts as if John had called him a nasty name, but recovers quickly. Then in a fluid motion, he reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a bouquet of purple flowers, and throws them onto John’s bed as if they were a broadsword.
“My phone was off. I’m sorry, John. I would have been here sooner—”
Irene smirks, then shakes her head. “No...anytime. Just thought you might need a further incentive. Seems like what you want to say is really special, and I am very curious to hear it.”
“It’s 4:30 in the afternoon,” I shout in exasperation, but the only answer I get is a flood of curse words and groans. I stomp off to the kitchen and heavily contemplate leaving the country for a while. I hear France is nice this time of year.
“I want to say something.” He begins, and curiosity begins to gather on Sherlock’s face. John can see the moment Sherlock stops himself from launching into a series of deductions, and he smirks at the sight. They’d agreed that Sherlock had to let John speak of his own accord sometimes, rather than Sherlock deducing everything he’s thinking. It was a challenge for Sherlock in normal situations, but John could tell that today it seemed even harder for Sherlock to keep quiet.
“You’re home,” John muttered, his tone oddly fragile, as if Sherlock were indeed a ghost that might disappear if John spoke too loudly.
Over the next few weeks, John tries to push the thoughts away; he really does. But now Mycroft has planted the idea, it begins to nestle deep in his mind. It grows and grows until he can’t ignore it anymore, which is probably why he sees it this time. The subtle changes in their reactions; a gradual fall into the Sherlock and John of the past. He notices, because he’s searching for it.
- weight in his arms as he made his way home.
“Yes, we did.” John’s grin was infectious, and it wasn’t long before they were in fits of giggles again, the leftover adrenaline finally leaving their system. “You were brilliant.”
“We have to stop meeting like this.” The familiar voice calls out behind John, startling him from his daydream.
“What the hell does drawing me stretched out have to do with the case?” John grunts. “I feel like Rose in Titanic.”
Molly can’t help but smile, then follows it up with a tearful little laugh. This is exactly why she needs Irene in ways that make the inside of her chest feel like a million stubborn butterflies are trying to escape it.
John would not have been surprised if the bloody thing began to glow.
“And what, you just couldn’t be bothered to tell me about it?”
John is surprised that he’s not more worked up
“Are you planning on using that as a tablecloth after the parade?”
What irritated him beyond all else, however, were the things he couldn’t control. Sex was quantifiable. There was a ratio: Sherlock could control how much pleasure was derived, could maximise the happiness gained and measure that against the success of their relationship. John couldn’t fake the results; they were easy to measure and hard to misinterpret. John’s emotions, however, were not. Sherlock found it difficult to understand John’s layered messages when the smile on his face didn’t match the look in his eyes. His moods were not easy to plot and measure. Sherlock could not, despite trying, predict which days John would have a short fuse — those days he would wake with a dark cloud above his head, or the nights where he’d be wrenched from sleep by his own screaming. Sherlock desperately wanted to plot them out — find formulas and build graphs to help him predict when those days were coming, so he could reduce their frequency as much as possible. Yet they were seemingly patternless, coming out of the blue when Sherlock least expected them. So he made a point of playing his violin when John became restless, or kissing him more the day after the night time terrors. Little blue ticks went into the calendar when these strategies were successful, and red lines through the days when nothing seemed to work at all.
At first, Sherlock would ignore them. John would toss the garments into the laundry basket when he had the time and was less exhausted from the surgery. Eventually, however, Sherlock would pick them up on his own and hold them close. Press the woollen blend up to his nose and inhale deep and long and silently pray that John didn’t make a surprise appearance to ask him what the hell he was doing. As if Sherlock could even answer that himself.
"Like this," he said, his desire molten and burning in his stomach. He needed Sherlock back inside of him now. "Won't be long like this, so don't hold back."
“There now,” John whispers as Sherlock’s head falls back onto the pillow. The softness of everything is all-consuming and has him feeling woozy. “Just have a little more of a lie-in before you do anything crazy...like walking.”
As it happened, murder had a way of fixing Sherlock’s problems. The yard found another body, and Lestrade had wasted no time texting Sherlock. This one was badly decomposed and left out in a child’s playground, an obvious deviation from the killer’s previous MO. John was already grabbing his coat before Sherlock could give him all of the general information.
made a horrible mistake was to break into my bedsit and…do what exactly? Leave rose petals on my mattress?”
of its contents to me in the morning? It would be unfortunate if the hospital asked me to step through a metal detector with that or my coat in my possession."
Sherlock hesitated, and Irene jumped on the concession like a dog with a bone. He’d forgotten how stubborn she could be -- identifying a sore spot and clamping onto it with all her might. There would be no arguing with her. John had tried that and failed. Besides, she wasn’t far from the truth. Even if John wasn’t his, wasn’t he effectively asking her for a way to fix that? To find a way to keep his scent, keep everything about him, available whenever he wanted? To understand what the hell his body was doing to him?
With a surge of satisfaction at John’s deep frown, Sherlock waved over the server and asked for the bill. They spent the cab ride home in silence, John staring soldier-like out of the front window, and Sherlock leaning his chin on his hand, watching the lampposts as they passed by. He recognised an adjacent street and asked the cabbie to stop, ignoring John’s confused glare as he slid out of his seat.
John nodded, and the female officer turned to look at her older companion. He cleared his throat.
“By the way, I flirted my way to the top shelf stuff from the guy at the bar. I think that should be worth at least two points in my column, don’t you?”
The relief in Greg’s voice is going to be shattered, and for once, it isn’t Sherlock doing it. How very strange indeed.
It had been only a number of times that Philip had seen Dr. John Watson since the funeral. The copper blonde head bowed and huddled up next to Martha Hudson. Hard to tell who was holding up the other from collapse on that ironically sunny day. Of course, Sherlock Holmes wasn’t
"Live-in client?" Greg repeated. "That serious, eh? And oh, that reminds me, we are having Sherlock's landlady stay longer at her sister's. We don't need her getting closer to trouble than we need until all this is over. Baker Street will have all the surveillance we can give it. Honestly, it's best to keep you two in a familiar location."
No, what he needed was to speak to someone directly. Usually, John would be his first call -- the doctor knew more about these things than the detective himself, but Sherlock wasn’t ready to broach the topic with his friend. Nor could he speak to Mrs Hudson or Lestrade; whilst they might have the enthusiasm, they lacked the insight Sherlock required. And Mycroft was out of the question. That left only one other person Sherlock trusted to broach the topic with.
Irene presses buttons on the mobile in her palm before she answers. The light of the screen illuminates her face with a ghost-blue glow.
“Is it not the right one for me?” John asks; his nerves are too raw to already be making a mistake this early in the day.
“Don’t use—“ His eyes blow wide as he sees John already on the laptop, scrolling through the pages and pages of information. John can barely pull his eyes away to look at him. Was this all he was to Sherlock? Some experiment; a source of data for him to analyse?
A giant thank you to beta reader SherlockWatson_Holmes for their help on such a short notice! Also, a huge shout out to DAngeles who will be creating some artwork connected with this chapter and whose inspirational drawings helped me get my slow arse moving to finish this chapter!
“What do you mean? I don’t—”
Sherlock blinks a few times as John sticks out his hand for a handshake.
The freezing water washes over him, and Sherlock uses the last of his strength trying to remain upright. Water fills his nose and mouth, stealing his breath, and somewhere above him, he’s sure he can hear deep echoing laughter. He ignores it, closing his eyes and focusing on one thought; John.
(See the end of the chapter for
, the test results to their STI screenings had come in just as Sherlock was signing his discharge papers. From that moment, all John could think about was getting his mouth around Sherlock's perfect cock, and feeling his orgasm against his tongue.
“Good…” Sherlock whispers. “Then I have your permission to carry on?”
"I imagined you like this moments after seeing you in the lab," Sherlock admitted. "You in the shadows, staring at me as I worked…" Sherlock moved further down the bed, opened up John's legs, and made his way between them. His own cock rubbed up against John's warm entrance. "In the restaurant," Sherlock went on, popping the top of the lubricant and rubbing a liberal amount on his hand. "Your power over everyone you meet is the best aphrodisiac I've ever experienced."
. He had three minutes until it was time to move. His current job wasn’t a person or even an animal. Nor was it exactly
Lestrade hums in contemplation. Takes another swig of his drink and then settles it back onto the table, dark eyes sympathetic. “Yeah...true. And he’s been acting even more of an arse ever since?”
We swear they weren't supposed to discuss moving in together THIS quickly
He hauled himself off the sofa and made it to his bedroom, but the door was already ajar, a clear sign that John was there. Sherlock had long connected that John’s deep-seeded military training required him to keep tabs on his surroundings. Usually, that manifested in him sleeping lightly in new places, never trusting that they wouldn’t be ambushed in the middle of the night. He slept by the door at home, ready to spring out of bed in case of an emergency. Now, whilst Sherlock was absent, the door must have been left open so John could hear Sherlock the moment he returned. It was a level of protection Sherlock never knew he could appreciate, wrapped in the arms of an ever-present soldier.
“John, I told you that all was forgiven. We both acted -”
The word always felt right when John said it, and Sherlock began to take slower and deeper breaths. Seb looked to John for guidance because he wouldn't dare let go of Sherlock unless John gave the word that all was ok. Greg took a tentative step towards the three of them on the floor with the tablet in hand.
“What if I don’t want to be friends?”
let it happen again.
many boxes," Sherlock grumbled.
The key didn’t actually unlock anything. It was just another part of the story. How could John have missed that? The real key had
“Don’t worry, John. It’s a script...a plan for tonight. Trust me, it will fit.”
“Two, er, beers, please.” Sherlock's eyes scan over the rows of beer taps, unsure which one he should choose. This really isn’t his area. What if the different brands react differently? Then Molly’s calculations could be inaccurate.
“Stop telling me that. I’m trying. A thousand thoughts are running through my head and I don’t know which of them are real, and I can’t hold onto them long enough to deduce anything. It’s you, you’re standing in the middle of them all, and if you would just move —”
The tea that John made was now cold, but Sherlock drank it anyway. He realised, a bit later than he usual due to his focus on the spreadsheet, that John bought more of the ginger lemon black tea that Sherlock had raved about a few months ago, but didn’t seem available at any of the local shops. Sherlock sighed as he finished off the last few drops, knowing that John clearly had gotten the tea in an apologetic gesture.
A smirk appeared on John's lips as Sherlock kissed a trail down the middle of John's chest. John groaned in response and fiddled with the button of Sherlock's trousers as best he could. Sherlock shimmed his hips to assist, and soon after they were both completely naked. Sherlock rocked his hips, moaning into John’s mouth when he mimicked the motion.
"Basic stripping is just that. Basic," Sherlock whispered. "These were a gift from a runway designer whom I assisted whilst on holiday in Italy. I never came up with a good enough reason to test them out until now."
He tilted his head and nibbled John's neck as he aimed all of his energy to smack against John's prostate as much as humanly possible. His right hand pressed to the wall to keep his balance, and his left hand made its way to John's cock and began to jack him off in earnest.
As he loaded up his laptop and connected to the motel’s wifi, he thought, and not for the first time, that if anyone knew of his pass time, they might fight it odd. After a long day at work, most men opted to watch a bit of porn or take part in some internet gambling. John, for his part, liked to read obituaries. Partly it was to see what families had to say about their lost loved one. But mostly, he liked to check that his client’s names never appeared in the list of the recently departed.
Sally darted her eyes away from the latest report to see that same John Watson looking back at her. There were hints of the man she had once known back when giggling at crime scenes was apparently in fashion. His hair was more honey blonde then, and the lines on his face less noticeable from across an empty room.
“Yes you are!” Sherlock exclaims when he can breathe again, laughter pouring from his mouth and tears dripping from his eyes.
Sherlock pushed forward again, his hands frantically roaming the doctor’s body, hungrily working his mouth open. John’s head hit the wall, but he didn’t pull away; instead, he wrapped his hands around the detective’s waist and pulled him even closer. Heat swelled up into the kiss; a steady glow of burning need that had John hitch a breath into Sherlock’s open mouth.
As time passed and John became more settled in 221B, his scent began to change. Slowly at first, almost imperceptibly, before it appeared to change all at once. The cheap shampoo was replaced by another, slightly more expensive product, which smelt of sea salt and cedarwood. The damp completely disappeared, and instead, John’s clothes smelt like honeysuckle from the washing powder they used.
“Thank you,” John goes to take a sip, but pauses before his lips touch the mug. “There’s nothing in this, right?”
“This might sound weird, but you smell different. I’ve been trying to put my finger on it all day. Did you buy new cologne?”
“I feel that I should apologise for not telling you about the spreadsheet. Even though I had not theorised your specific reaction...in hindsight, it would have been more honest to be more transparent.”
John was strong and brave and so beautiful that Sherlock could hardly bear it. His body rolled as wave after wave of controlled explosions hit, and he
“No,” John whispered to himself as he left the living room to gather the better medical supplies from the bathroom. “He’s injured,” John continued, his mind clearing at the words. “He’s a patient in medical need and you will treat him that way.”
"Fuck," it was the only thing John could think to say. As if Sherlock had ripped every other word from the English language from his memory with his cock. "Fuuck," he said again, then his right hand grabbed hold of Sherlock's hips, and they were moving. There weren't the awkward few seconds where each person attempted to match the other's rhythm. There was just perfect harmony as they moved in unison. John's hand slid across Sherlock's erection simply from the force of their movements, and he was pitifully aware that this would not last long. John angled his thumb so it would slide perfectly across the glans on the tip of Sherlock's cock, and managed a wicked grin at the string of curses that rose up out of Sherlock's throat.
A couple of weeks into their new arrangement, John feels fairly smug after a late-night snog that quickly gave way to Sherlock babbling something during his orgasm that sounded vaguely French. John can't help smiling off and on at the surgery, much to a few of the other doctors' curious eyes.
“To a very interesting night,” John chuckles, then throws a small smile Sherlock’s way before taking a very large swallow. Sherlock watches the amber liquid pass John’s lips, realising that this will be an interesting night indeed.
He was prattling out nonsense and he had no idea how to stop himself. Did the articles give any advice as to how to pull your foot out of your mouth?
John just had to find him first.
“You already know the answer to that question, so why ask it?”
He is not prepared for what he sees.
“Greg said something about Pierce’s alibi leaving town recently,” John began. They both must have been sitting at the kitchen table for close to an hour without saying a word. Sherlock hummed to show that he was listening, even though he’d already considered and dismissed Pierce’s girlfriend as a possible lead.
dirty things to the man sharing his chair with him.
John gives a quick nod before he starts to take off his clothing, ignoring Sherlock’s slight look of surprise.
"There aren't
"Not taking her on myself," John clarified. While he was a lone wolf, he wasn't suicidal. His time as
Sherlock gives a tight grin, diligently pulling out his planning folder and assigning John two extra points. The conversation moves to safer subjects, and the time begins to slip past like water. They eventually get kicked out of the club, after John challenges Sherlock to start an argument about something stupid with a bunch of guys on the dancefloor.
The only problem? The repo men weren’t exactly stupid. They’d hired a security company to watch the outside of the building, making it harder for John to get inside. Difficult, but not impossible. The time came, and he watched the security guard pass by the door. As soon as he was out of sight, John moved. All he had to do was get in, take the package from the woman, and get out. He’d drop the bundle off at a locker at Victoria Coach Station where his payment was waiting, then wash his hands of the job.
“The killer made an appearance,” Sherlock concluded. “And we arrived within five minutes of this photo being taken, the killer needed to be close enough to the crime scene to escape undetected.”
“This is just what I am now,” John replies, his voice soft and distant, as if on his deathbed. “A collection of twitches and gay wokeness overload.”
“If one of us was a woman, you would never have thought that we were merely friends. You would have automatically assumed that we were on a date. So, why did you not make the same conclusion about us?”
“I’ve been working.”
"How do you take your tea?" He called out as he went off to find the kettle and inspect the milk.
“Sure, but I’m staying here.”
“So how does he know?”
She chuckles, but there’s a sparkle in her eyes that makes him realise that she doesn’t mind.
“You’re the groom to be.”
to be paying attention?”
the type to go racing off after a one-night stand.
“I’m with you.”
There’s a pause, a moment of silence as the pair acknowledge each other, before John’s mouth runs away with itself.
“Yes.” Sherlock replied, brushing his thumb over John’s and relishing the feel of the warm skin beneath his. They began walking again, their hands intertwined and their hearts open. As they walked, they discussed their boundaries and needs, trying to determine exactly what their relationship would be. As they moved idly home, something shifted between them, and a love Sherlock never thought he’d feel swelled in his heart.
As they break apart there’s a spattering of applause from behind them; the small group of people stood at the end of the road watching them in wonder. It hits John how un-self-conscious he feels, even knowing that they have witnessed such an intimate moment. He feels free, unlimited by the judgements of others, confident in himself and his partnership.
Unfortunately, The Work needs me, and Lestrade or Mycroft would drag me back here even if I chose a life away from Baker Street. Besides, I would miss John too much.
Bending over and making sure that the curve of his arse was very well within John's view from the kitchen table, Sherlock opened up the side table drawer and took out a pair of intensely sharp scissors and slinked back to where John still sat trembling in his chair.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Sherlock asks, desperately ignoring the fact that, despite the deep cold nestled within him, the shivers have ceased. He can’t have long now.
He had solved crimes for years without the aid of chemical diversion, but there was a factor that hadn’t been present back then.
That wasn’t what Sherlock wanted at all, but it appeared that was precisely what kept occurring when Irene Adler was involved. There was a constant tit for tat in their relationship, dictated by the darker parts of what Sherlock was willing to do to solve a case and prove that he had the sharper mind. However, this situation was irritatingly different. Anything involving John was.
"Maybe one girl in the first year of Uni. We went out nearly the whole year. Dates, movies, she came to my games. And Chet in year thirteen, but we never went public. But it was just a schoolyard crush, both of them. Having a dad in the army, we moved a bit when he got shipped from base to base when I was really young. Then later. Well, Harry and I… erm, we moved around a lot. By the time Uni came around, I learned not to make lasting connections. Easier that way."
"But what does
The cracking sound returns. Like bundles of sticks but with a deeper resonance.
“Fear is whatever space it takes up. It can hollow out bones and stop a heartbeat. It is what destroys civilisations and protects advancement.”
“Are we toasting to anything specific? Your desire to drive me nuts before entrees, or something different?”
“Brooding is usually my area,” Sherlock muttered. John’s glare was instantaneous.
“Give me a minute. Need to just check before I…”
We love each and every one of your comments, thank you for all your kind words 🥰
“Bastard,” John curses, looking up and down the road for another cab.
Another crash from behind them. Molly needed to stop pretending not to be overhearing their conversation, for the sake of all of Barts laboratory equipment.
It wasn’t anything planned, and that was the start of the problem. The case was one of the most thrilling that they'd ever been part of, and their defences dropped among the tremendous insanity of really almost being killed this time. Perhaps that’s why they were still laughing when they raced up the stairs of 221b, the slam of the door slightly muffled from their giggles.
“Come in then,” Irene mentions. “Or would you prefer to stay here and keep the alcohol company?”
The smell of tea pushes John’s brain back to the present, and he sniffs the air as if he must have imagined the initial whiff. No, it’s definitely there. The slightly spicy smell of the teas he had bought at Tesco the previous week, and the scent is coming from downstairs.
The room had taken the brunt of John’s desperation and fury. Splintered bits of wood littered the floor along with what looked like torn up pages from books and newsprint. Greg carefully stepped around as much as he could. The occasional recognition of John’s handwriting or articles with the headlines
“Talk to me, John...please,” I rasp. I need some sort of concrete proof that I haven’t left my body because of what this man is doing to it with his mouth. A puff of a giggle lands on my inner thigh.
“Next bar then?” he says, his voice oddly high-pitched. “Right after I get some water to go. Meet you outside, yeah?”
"Fuck…" he rasped into the thicket of blonde hair.
“Why don’t you find out?”
“As long as it’s quick. You see that I’m being buried at the moment.”
The lump of fabric moves lazily and despite himself, John stares as the heavy duvet falls from the mattress enough to reveal a long section of slender pale leg and part of a very supple arse. A bright red handprint is near the curve of the right cheek and John barely catches his breath at the sight.
“I got a job interview for head of Neurology, and I just had to come see this old place! It looks exactly the same.” She casually brushed a strand of dark blonde hair behind her ear, and her eyes flickered over to Sherlock, before returning to John. “Do you work here? Which department are you in? You wanted to do trauma surgery, didn’t you?”
"I can't get close enough to him to have him fucking take anything, Mycroft. Can't you hear the racket he's making? I thought you said the comedown would be smooth."
John shuffles his feet to give himself an action to focus on. It isn’t enough.
The same sensation of honeybees travelling across his skin returned. Sherlock opened his mouth but found that he was quite speechless. Would John ever cease to surprise him?
“Does that mean you’re officially dating? Only, I have a bet with the yard, and I need to get my facts straight…”
“It’s...no,” he muttered back, but his usual air of impertinence made the lie ring particularly hollow in the morgue. He was getting tired of so many insistent emotions clouding his judgement. “I mean...maybe. I have been having difficulty with splitting up my time for The Work and John. He states that he understands that the Work comes first, but then he gets angry whenever it interferes.”
"Going to tattoo my name on your arse, so everyone knows who you belong to," John growled as he jumped from table to bed.
This is what John never thought was possible, but it is. Here and now and wrapped up in a beautiful new shade of acceptance. They’re actually making it as a couple. They fell at the same time, and now together they fly.
“I’m already so close,” John admits. His tongue swipes over his lips, and the bed dips beside him as Sherlock adjusts his position. Sherlock takes the head of John’s cock into his mouth and smoothly slides down. John chokes out a cry at the feeling, and his hips take on a life of their own and give a small thrust.
of last night’s activities that the
John inhales a deep breath before exhaling out. The scent of Sherlock’s cologne clings to his nose and chin, and he nods as well as he can while being hugged.
She’d sit them next to John instead of extra helpings of homemade scones or Yorkshire pudding. Well worn testaments that Sherlock still existed in the spaces between then and now, and John absorbed it all. The surgical hands swept the scratchy notes off to the edges of specific passages as if he just pressed hard enough, he could lift up the letters that Sherlock once thought was important enough to form.
Thanks to what John would fondly refer to as
It didn't bother John one bit that Mycroft didn't like him. At the end of the day, he wasn't here for Mycroft. What was bothering him was how Mycroft seemed to be hindering any development, rather than aiding thanks to his hatred.
“Don’t you still have the forgery case?” John asks, placing his cup of tea on the fireplace and looking around for his jacket.
“Sherlock, what was all that — are you smoking?” John stops in his tracks at the sight of the detective, half hanging out the window, a smoldering cigarette perched between his slender fingers. He’s already changed into his pyjamas and dressing gown and it’s wrong that even now, when John has no idea what’s about to happen next, how gorgeous Sherlock looks in his robe. Especially with the backdrop of London behind him in the window.
Soft kisses settled along the lining of Sherlock’s spine as John travelled north, until he reached the nape of Sherlock’s neck and settled there. Sherlock moaned as he turned in John’s embrace and witnessed John’s eyes open up into the early sunrise.
"You left," Sherlock rasped, looking at John. "I didn't know where you went. You didn't say when you'd be back...just that you would come back and Lestrade wouldn't tell me anything and John. I broke...the toaster? I believe that's what it was. And I need a hug and a cigarette, and I hate that horrible woman so much."
“No,” Sherlock snaps as he lifts himself up to his full height and glowers at John. “You are not about to take this away from me because...you got wrapped up in the moment!”
John smiles back, ears still pink but definitely no longer embarrassed. “Well, I haven’t any complaints, but I am ready to be the one who only makes those sounds for you...if you’re amenable?”
“I just want to know how you’ve been doing since - “
Greg huffs out a laugh. Sherlock paces roughly ten metres away, his coat billowing behind him as the murder victim lies flat on his back on the asphalt. The untamed curls bounce in time with the long strides as the detective moves back and forth as he collects pieces of information for later deductions. John can tell that he’s cursing due to the deeply low grumblings and thinks it best to keep his distance.
After several long minutes of simply groaning into his mattress, he rolled onto his back and reached for his laptop. He was too full to even think about getting up to undress, and he needed to distract himself from the discomfort before he began to contemplate bending over the toilet or the nearest bin.
"Mary will understand that I'm asking her to meet me there. It's going to be messy on both sides, she'll expect a trap, and she'll know I'm expecting one. But, if Sherlock is right, she won't be able to resist the opportunity to see me. And," John said grimly, "unless you have a secret twin of mine hidden away, I'm going to have to show up, or she'll never show her face."
Waking up from death can be a challenge for someone who rarely sleeps. Thankfully John is there to lend a hand, and to tell his story.
“Ah.”
been the Stradivarius.
Sherlock paused to enjoy Lestrade’s bewilderment before continuing on.
Anderson crosses his arms and makes a deliberate decision to not look at Sherlock at all when he speaks. “My deductions are just as valid as anyone here...including his.”
that you don't have any other weapons hidden in some crevice. Seb, toss your switchblade, pepper spray and that ridiculous mini flamethrower you carry onto the floor and out of reach. It's too bloody late in the night  for this nonsense, and I need everyone alive in this room for anything to get accomplished."
“I want you to stop sleeping with my brother.”
"Whatever you say, I'll give it to you. If I'm going too slow or fast, tell me, and I'll adjust accordingly. This is for you; every second of this is for you. I want to watch you melt into a puddle of your own desire, Sherlock."
John glances up from his breakfast to see an expression on Harry’s face that he is way too familiar with, and he sighs.
“What are you up to?” John chuckled as Sherlock shifted to place small kisses higher up, towards John’s ear. His hands grabbed at Sherlock’s hips and tightened as Sherlock continued his explorations.
He groans again, but this time with the effort of trying to figure out where the hell he ended up. Awareness of him not being in his musty bedsit on the edge of the city is slowly sinking in. It’s not an overwhelming surprise. The room is too spacious and the bed is way too large and comfortable to be his own.
"He's something special, the other half to my crazy. He makes life worth living. I haven't officially known him long, but Christ, Greg, what I feel isn't a schoolyard crush. I want to grab his hand and never let go. In the short amount of time I've known him, I haven't been able to keep my hands off him or him me. You should see the state of his bedroom… it rather looks like an earthquake knocked all the pictures off his walls."
“Wait, was that a compliment?”
would protect you, your cat, your dog, and your favourite necklace from any danger for the right amount of money. He didn’t ask questions, and he reserved the right to deny any client he thought might not be worthy of his time.
And if the closeness meant Sherlock’s moans fell directly into his mouth? All the better.
"Forensic scientist?" John hummed aloud, then went on to search for the other officer who'd passed away two weeks ago.
John knows how he sounds. Part of him wants to shut up and be grateful that Sherlock is obviously putting the effort in, but he can’t. This isn’t the man he met in that lab -- the one that will deduce the smallest details of your life without a care for how you feel; the man who leaves thumbs in the fridge and never ever cleans up after himself. Not the man he fell in love with. Sherlock may be a pain in the arse sometimes, but he’s
“Back when I told you that I realised I was bisexual,” he says, and his hands wrap around my wrists and give them a gentle squeeze. “I didn’t tell you everything because...I already was a balling mess about it and you already spent most of the night being the friend that I needed.”
Sherlock closes the gap from his lips to the space between John’s inner thigh and left testicle, and gives a long lick. John gasps at the heat and clever tongue work.
Sex. Right...that. This chapter is full of it. Not so much a warning as a humble brag. Sort of. Ignore me, everyone. It's been a long week. Comments and kudos are the breath of life and make the bees happy. I promise that I will finally get to responding to all of the lovely comments I have received very soon.
The first flaw in judgment was that she hadn't stayed in bed. Allowed John’s rhythmic breathing to lull her back to slumber and them both to begin the day together. Instead, she had gotten up. Too excited to keep still at the dazzling possibilities in front of her. The steps down to the kitchen to make coffee and eggs. As domestic as those old magazines that her mum used to leave on the table for guests to ignore.
It was all because of Sherlock Holmes. With his eyes sharpened to such a fine point that he could stab the wrong person with just a well-placed look. With his voice as heavy as marble dipped in winter honey and John was trapped underneath its weight from the start.
“Oh fuck...oh holy f—“
“My God, are you’re ridiculous,” John whispers. He leans down so they are too close to not make this into something much more explicit.
A word that seemed to leave it’s residue on every piece of furniture in the flat. The smell a seamless blend of nightly rants and daily conversations, and it
"You're fucking gorgeous," John muttered, resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder as he began to pump himself furiously, "Christ, you're better than any drug."
The pieces of clothing that still managed to cling to the body looked reasonably expensive, although the man inside of them looked very down on his luck. He had a scraggly beard and very long fingernails, along with shoes that appeared to have been worn out to the point of falling apart. The clothes didn’t match the man's appearance — someone wearing what was, at one point, a nice three-piece suit would have taken better care of their general appearance. A decoy, perhaps?
“Don’t move.” the voice was deep and stern in his ear, and with a jolt of comprehension, Sherlock knew that John wasn’t near him anymore. He froze as the blade pressed in a little more, with the position and pressure of an obviously left-handed person. “And you, come out where I can see you.”
“Bollocks to history, and whatever the hell else you’re going to give as an excuse.” Harry downs the rest of her coffee, then places the empty mug on the table and turns to face him. “Look, Johnny...I couldn’t put the effort in. I was drowning myself in a bottle of vodka every night for God’s sake; I couldn’t even begin to repair our relationship until I’d taken a good look at myself. You can. If you want to keep him, you have to try. It won’t be easy, but if you really love him, you owe him that. Do the work.”
Then Mary put finality to it all by blocking his number. It was the last bit of kindness that she could give, and John gulped it down like broken glass.
The only door into the room opened and two more officers walked inside. The first one was a woman whom John would absolutely have pursued if this was a different time, place, and alternate reality. Her dark blue eyes peered over to John’s overnight bag and then to Harold before narrowing in on John in heavy judgment. She radiated the no-nonsense quality that probably made her very good at stopping both high-level drug smugglers and twitchy vacationers trying to avoid customs taxes.
There was clear bruising around the neck, made before death; obvious strangulation. Dirt caked under the fingernails, but no DNA had come back in the lab report, so the victim wasn’t facing the killer. She struggled, grasping at the ground, but couldn’t see who was attacking her. Bruising on the neck was consistent, there was a pattern of fingerprints over her trachea, and a small concentration of bruising on the nape of her neck, where two thumbs had pushed against her spine.
John couldn't remember a time when another's body had ever possessed this much pull on him. He couldn't take his eyes off Sherlock. Not that he'd even wanted to. From the perfect curve of his arse to the taught fabric at Sherlock's shoulders, the man was a sight to behold. One worthy of an exhibit in all of the most prestigious museums across the world. Though, if John had his way, that would
“Hey, do you want to get some coffee before we head home? Could do with a pick me up.” John asked, pressing the call button for the lift.
John found peace in the second year with Mary. She’d allow John to ramble on about old murder mysteries and ignored that John still kept a Belstaff coat in his closet. She was funny and smart and then she was gone. It should have mattered more that she left. That the scorecard of those who fled from John Watson had gained another point on their side, and yet John instead went into autopilot. Apologized with the methodical precision of a surgeon, and all of the clinical coldness as well.
“That’s fine.”
John stops talking at the extremely puzzled expression his sister is giving him. It takes a moment for John to realise what has happened, and he readjusts his incredulity into something softer and more understanding. Harry’s memory is perfectly serviceable in most situations, but adding alcohol turns her into Dory from
"The nurse said he's in observation," she said, her voice slightly more tender. "I'm sure he's fine, but you should head over, dear."
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“No,” John mumbles. “It’s just...something’s wrong. Off about all of this.”
John wrenches Sherlock up to his lips and kisses him with the impact of a barrage of bullets. The ricochet absorbing all aspects of Sherlock’s body and soul and sex with John might be the most extraordinary activity that he has
“Last night shouldn’t have happened,” John says, trying his best to keep as calm as possible. “I was drunk and...I’m sorry if you assumed that there would be more.”
John chuckled, a low laugh that made his chest vibrate. Perhaps Sherlock was right. Maybe he needed to stop asking for permission and give the man what he so clearly wanted. It was the moan that made him act. The sound had hardly begun when John's finger slid deep inside Sherlock. Soft heat squeezed around his finger, and John found himself wondering how he'd ever fit in there without hurting Sherlock.
The violin exuded expensive quality and posh aloofness, much like the man who once played it. The dark honey tone with rich auburn hues within the polished wood. The bow alongside it sturdy enough to survive midnight musings from elegant hands. Handspun lullabies to combat John's nightmares of war.
"That's the spot, yeah, Two bullets back to back. I think she meant the second to hit my heart, but I dove right, and she missed." John's chest rose as he sucked in a deep breath. He didn't like thinking about that moment. He'd trusted her, so had everyone else. And after so many successful operations, no one had seen her betrayal coming. "Bitch ruined my favourite tattoo. It was a sloth with a briefcase. Not sure I can ever forgive her for that."
(See the end of the chapter for
In an attempt to rectify all of these racing thoughts, Sherlock did what came most natural. He shuffled onto his back and steepled his fingers beneath his chin and refiled all of the most cluttered evidence.
John’s eyes glistened with understanding. You mean — “
"You really mean all of that, don't you, about how you feel about him," Greg mused. It wasn't a question but a statement. "Good then. Sherlock deserves to be happy, and I've known him long enough to tell you that he's never looked at anyone the way he looks at you, mate. Like you are the only person in the room….hell, on the planet."
They push through a group of people dressed head to toe in leather and a couple wearing dog masks until they reach the steps of the National Gallery. From the top, they can see over the heads of the crowd beneath them, so by the time the first float comes round the corner, they can see everything clearly. Music blares out from all different directions, even as the temporary speakers switch off. There’s a group of teenagers playing music from a portable speaker round the corner, and each float has its own sound system. The lyrics all blur into each other, and what should be an auditory nightmare makes John’s heart flutter with joy.
“You heard, Dr Watson.”
“Mums the word.” He taps his nose and leans back against the wall, the coldness of the bricks seeping through his jacket. They stay in silence for a few minutes, small clouds of smoke billowing in front of them. The scent of tobacco feels familiar, but he shoves that thought down quickly before he has a chance to dwell on it. Not here. Not now.
"I sort of broke into NSY today. Proved to him just how easy it would be to get to him. I didn't drop my visitor pass in the toilets. I simply never had one in the first place. All I needed was his name, a nice suit, and a quick smile. Basic knowledge regarding his disgust towards Anderson helped as well."
“Sherlock,” John said, half chuckling. “Why do you keep staring at me?”
mean?" John barked back, his fingers curled into his hair, and came very close to pulling it out. "Why the bloody
“For your sanity,” Mycroft replied. “Or what’s left of it.”
The woman sighed and gestured for John to turn around and face Harold again. His duffel bag sat innocently on a long wooden table and Harold began to pull on latex gloves. Never a good sign.
“You are beautiful,” John goes on, his hands now pushing the edges of the wispy dark curls near Sherlock’s v-line. “To think I have the gift to see you like this. Underneath my fingertips to do whatever I want to see your stunning face in pleasure.”
With a huff, John begins to get out of his chair. If Sherlock decides to involve him in the case at some point, that would be grand. Right now, he has old cases to write up.
“Sherlock, I just mean as your friend. Surely there’s something I can do to make things easier, maybe talk things through with you—”
“You’re exceedingly judgemental of what people use to cope. Especially since you chose Miss Adler as
“He isn’t
John sighs into the empty space, his chest aching with the loss. It hadn’t hit him before; the finality of it. He knew what he was asking for, when he’d initiated the conversation downstairs, but he hadn’t fully appreciated its consequences. Sherlock may think that ending a relationship only means refraining from sex, but John knows better. They will never share a bed again, for sex or sleep. His nights will be spent alone, without the detectives long slender body to keep him warm. John won’t be able to run his fingers through those dark curls, or slide his feet into Sherlock’s lap. There will be a barrier between them: one John knows will be hard to keep.
“Been a while since my last time,” Sherlock answered dryly.
John lifted his chin up, and steadied his gaze. “Then why do you of all people decide to tell me now? You hated him...and barely tolerated me up until he fell.”
John was bisexual, or at least somewhere on that spectrum; deduction proven both in generalised hypothesis and in practical application.
Greg chewed and swallowed a bite of food and stabbed his fork at another piece.
He considers brushing past it, leaving things there and trusting Sherlock to do whatever he needs to do. Eventually, John holds his hand out, palm up, and Sherlock deduces what he wants without even asking. The detective reaches under the bed, and there’s a harsh clunk as a floorboard is pulled from its place. Before long, a small bag of white powder is placed gently into John’s outstretched hand.
He pulled out his mobile to send a quick Twitter post about getting take away after work when his eyes caught a reply to his latest diatribe about Philip. Usually, followers were kind and sympathetic, but @CJW197104 response was in a category of its own.
John’s eyes are very much the same as they are in human form. Bright blue with shadows of a deep hazel, only now they are perfectly round and huge in size.
The last part of the insult was thrust away by a twist of John's hips that Sherlock knew must be illegal. He'd add that to the list of charges to give to his legal team. That was if he survived this in the end. Murder by orgasms may have to be added to the filings.
He cleared his mind, knowing it was the way he absorbed information best, and fell into the rhythmic motions of bobbing his head. It was more muscle memory than anything else by now, so the act took very little concentration. After three months spent on his knees worshipping this man, he knew what his lover needed. Sherlock would shift his weight to his left foot when he wanted to be teased. While equal weight on both feet meant he wanted it quick and dirty, which is what he was asking for now.
Yet another error to add to the pile.
“...I even thought that maybe I might just want to sleep with you and no other man, because well, you’re brilliant and gorgeous and hilarious…”
“Oh…” Greg says, after a very long pause.
“Rectified,” she repeated. “As in corrected. Do you consider your feelings towards the doctor something to be corrected?”
“For how long?”
“Salt water,” he mutters. “Fairly common thing to view through a microscope.”
He’d told Sherlock he loved him. John had said those words less than two bloody months ago; had looked this bastard in the eye and told him he
This was what an existence with Sherlock Holmes did to everything it touched. It bent and twisted sensibilities and sexualities in the shapes of enveloping scenarios. So that a perfectly well-adjusted ex-army doctor with a documented limp now raced down the streets of Rome.
on the reply.
, that’s nice. A cool wave of the calmness Sherlock desperately needs filling his veins and helping his breathing to even out.
“What’s this?” John asks, battling his way past canvases and a pile of paint trays to the kettle. He fills it, and flicks it on.
“Getting anywhere?”
When his timeline began to show him things he’d already read, John turned off his computer. Placing it back in the travel case, he laid back on the bed and absently stuck a hand down his pants. He couldn’t get the tweet out of his head. Cheating was, in John’s opinion, an all-time low. Granted, without it, he’d be out of a job more often than not. A decent chunk of his clients were women trying to escape their cheating partners or abusive relationships. Still, even in his worst relationship (a boy in his thirteenth year), cheating on him had
Sherlock was relieved that John couldn't see his pinkening cheeks. Whatever Mary Morstan gave him was powerful, but the effects were obviously melded so the person under the influence would remember everything that had been said and done. Sherlock would need to delve into the darker aspects of that later, but for now, he just wanted John to be the only one in the flat so that they could just be together in the best possible ways.
“I don’t understand,” John says. “I mean…your artistic eye is stunning but there are so much lovelier things to paint than me.”
John had the grace to look sheepishly up at Greg as he admitted the next bit.
The amount of warning in John’s voice does the trick, and Sherlock stops in his tracks. He looks like he’s readying himself for an argument. He wouldn’t be wrong to prepare.
The wink Sherlock gives doesn’t help John’s imagination of how lovely that vision would be.
“I’m fine. I’ll call the Yard.”
“...Kraig stormed out in a huff because of you and I want to know why.”
“That I want to continue to paint you John, obviously…if you will still allow me to do so.”
early into their relationship that if Sherlock could have knitting needles squirrelled away for emergencies, he could have a few emergency items of his own. Before diving forward to claim those full lips as his own, John smirked and pulled out a single-use packet of lube from his pocket. If asked, John would confess that he thought his emergency items were a bit more logical. At the very least, they were used far more often than knitting needles.
He had always known he was different. Had always known where his attractions lay, and it had never been a big deal, for him. His parents had been progressive enough to not ask invasive questions or expect him to come home with anyone he fancied. But still, they never talked about it. No one mentioned how he never brought girlfriends home like Mycroft, or how the pictures of Alan Turing and Steven Pinker on his wall weren’t purely ‘for science’. It was as if he didn’t exist.
“Uh, The Honey Pot, over in Soho.” John chokes slightly on his water, but once he’s finished coughing, there’s a sly smile on his face. “What?” Sherlock asks, not understanding John’s reaction, but all he gets is a “Nothing.” in response.
John raises an eyebrow, a sly smile reaches his lips. “You’re not supposed to know about that.” He sighs, pushing his left hand into his trouser pocket. “That’s exactly why I have to try. We’ve been through so much already, surely there’s still something worth fighting for.”
John could come right now from the way Sherlock looks underneath him. Dark curls splashed all over the light blue linens and pale skin glistening with sweat and arousal that John Watson caused. The cheekbones that John cherishes striking in the low light of Sherlock’s bedroom.
“Sherlock?” John says after he yawns into the semidarkness. “No.”
"You're asking if I loved Mary?" John looked to Sherlock for clarification then gave a snort of disgust. "Absolutely not. She was good in bed and liberal with her wine. But there was nothing between us. I told her from the start that I didn't do relationships, that if sex happened more than once between us, it would simply be out of convenience. I had sex with other women during those three months we were working together. She never seemed bothered by it until the end. It was as if something snapped in her brain. One day she was laughing with me. The next, she was possessive and snapping at me if I did so much as look at a female patient. Complete night and day reaction, no one on the ward could figure out what caused the change."
“Very much so.” I grin, slipping my hand into his and entwining our fingers. He gives a gentle squeeze back. Who knows if this will work, if he’ll stop getting booty calls from his previous exploits, but I had fun. And I think he did too.
“Awwwwwwww!!!”
Well, not quite the topic Sherlock wanted, but at least it keeps Mary in between them in the best of ways.
His mind keeps wandering to Baker street, wondering what Sherlock is up to without him. Has he solved the case yet? Perhaps without John’s distraction, the detective could have solved the case and moved onto the next one by now. He hopes Lestrade will update him when they finally catch the guy, but John realises that the DI would have no reason to. John’s not on the case anymore, he’s not even a detective, so he has no rights over information pertaining to an open case.
“Yes, but what does it matter? They all end in the same thing. Sweat and other bodily fluids.”
“What the bloody hell does that even mean?”
“I never take offence to what people do and say,” Irene sighs. “Closure and acceptance takes many forms and faces. Contrary to your folklore, I am not evil. I am just a vessel. A reflection of what the soul needs to see before they make their choice. That is, if they get a choice. Some are not so fortunate.”
The comments and kudos for this story have given me life and thank you for them. Also as always thank you to the lovely and supportive SherlockWatson_Holmes for their beta work!!
and it had lived up to its name. The bright lights and atmosphere screamed of Pride, beautiful bodies, and Lady Gaga. Just behind Harry’s cheesy group photo with a couple of heavily tattooed older ladies, John was stood next to a slender man with dark curly hair and very familiar cheekbones.
He spends the rest of the day alone, checking his phone every five minutes, hoping for a reply. He sends three more texts, each more desperate than the last. At around three o’clock, he heads out to the supermarket, hoping that the flat won’t be empty when he returns. He’s disappointed. John struggles up the stairs with the shopping bags, and his stomach sinks to find that no one has been in the flat since he left.
Molly wasn’t the type to lie to people. Lies gave her the lurching sense of missing a step going down a staircase, and falling towards something dark and painful and way way too cold. And she didn’t deserve that. No one did.
He was a little surprised to see the man who’d been stalking Sylvia De Grace listed among the dead. But his surprise faded when he read that it had been from an overdose. Men rarely assumed they were in a relationship with a celebrity if they were sober and of sound mind, so his means of demise made sense. Part of him, the part that was a doctor, felt pity for the man. With the right help and support system, maybe he could have turned his life around.
And no one has fallen harder than John. But if he and Sherlock really tried, cut through the bullshit and started being honest with each other, perhaps they could fall together.
Years of drug abuse, never once caring for his own life, and this is how everything ends? No. He won’t let it.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
He scans around the room, trying to decide where the infernal noise is coming from. He attempts to isolate the sounds from each other. The shouts are in his mind, but everything else is coming from someplace specific, and painfully close.
As the floats travel past his heart begins to settle, still full of joy but no longer threatening to burst out of his chest. They sing along to ‘This Is Me’ as a Greatest Showman themed float drives past, their throats growing hoarse as they shout out the lyrics as loud as they can.
They spend the next few hours reacquainting themselves with the other, letting fingers brush through hair, pressing kisses to every inch of bare skin. They don’t undress, never allowing the moment to broach from affection to lust; they simply explore every inch of each other, whispering promises into the dusk. At some point, they fall into bed, still holding on for dear life, afraid to let each other go.
Sherlock glared as Anderson turned on his heel and headed out of the door. Only the echoing of his footfalls and the deep gulps of black coffee were the only sounds to be heard, which was perfectly fine.
“You corrected everyone before. You were faultless about it.”
“Well then,” John giggled. “Praise kink officially confirmed.”
“Excellent,” John says, looking and sounding much more like the Captain he was in the army. “Now, what I want you to do is pay close attention to me once I have transformed. I’m fairly small, so try to do your best to watch my wing movements.”
"Two sugars and a splash of milk," Sherlock called back. He flipped the book to page 214 and began to read.
Had he been doing that? John hasn’t consciously been avoiding the detective, but the more he thinks about it, the more he realises that he’s been finding excuses not to be alone with Sherlock. Each time they find themselves alone, John has to work harder and harder to keep himself in check. If anyone had asked, he would have never said they were an overly affectionate couple, but he hadn’t realised until now just how much they would casually touch. The loss feels like an hole in his heart, one he’s not sure how to fill.
“I’m sure that once I run some blood tests and get some fingerprints, it’ll be shown that the dead man was gravely ill and recently purchased a gun. The person who came out here probably cared for him greatly and didn’t want the rest of his family to know that his death was by his own hands. Or perhaps they just wanted his life insurance, Lestrade. The whys of people doing idiotic things is not my area of expertise. As if I would ever want it to be.”
“I…” John begins, his mouth so dry that he has to wet his lips. “I don’t know what to even…what am I supposed to deem from all of what you just said?”
“I need to explain?” John retorts, with an unmistakable hint of menace in his tone. “If anything it’s

They showered together, and by some miracle, John managed to keep his hands to himself. However, he did
“It’s the bisexual colours, yes…” Sherlock begins before lowering his voice so that only John can hear him. “But this...isn’t the type of belt one wears around their waist.”
this,” John parrots, the white heat of his words burning his mouth and tongue as he says them. “Like I’m something to be endured...like a chore? Is that it?”
“Did...was that a compliment?”
“Sort of.” He said, shoving his hands in his pockets and smirking at John’s confused expression. “What do you think of it?”
compared to you getting anywhere near Sherlock's pants. Not that I really wanted all the details, but you have no idea what he’s  like on a regular week. I have it on good authority that he's tried to poison Anderson on at least three occasions…not that I can really blame Sherlock for that. Phillip is scum for what he did."
“It seems as if our relationship is destined to be improbable, but never impossible, John. That I can embrace and accept, as long as you do as well.”
At first, he thinks it’s the alcohol — one beer too many keeping him awake, but then he readjusts his position, and realises.
“I’m having a shower and going to bed. Have fun with the case.”
of it.
His gaze stayed steady on the gravel on the otherwise immaculate dark blue carpeting. His slender magnifying glass shook slightly as Lestrade took another step closer and bent over next to him. Sherlock already knew that the DI was glaring at him for not answering, but Sherlock barely cared.
John’s quiet chuckle has Sherlock grinning in spite of himself, and he can’t seem to get his scowl to reform. The sensation of John’s fingers interlacing with his own doesn’t help this either, but Sherlock for once sees no real segue into another complaint.
Never in his life had John uttered those words to anyone save his parents and his sister when they were little. No girlfriend, or onetime lover, had ever had those words directed at them from his lips. Yet, he'd said it willingly, freely, and had meant it completely. "Three words that only my immediate family has ever heard uttered from my lips," John spoke slowly but with purpose. It didn't matter that a man who'd just tried to kill him sat within punching distance. Sherlock deserved to hear this. "Granted, this might not be word for word, but I think I said
The marathon of sex is going on in the upper bedroom, and I am trying not to break things, including my teeth from all of the clenching. The rhythmic banging of John’s headboard reverberates through the flat and is a metronome that screams over and over again that he is fucking someone. And
“So you don’t want to go to Angelo’s tonight?”
The sun had already set by the time they made it to the garden. They kept to the hedgerows, staying out of sight of the house, despite there being no lights on in any of the windows.
“Body found an hour ago,” Sherlock muttered, going back to his phone. “Victim in his late thirties to early forties. Shot multiple times at medium range. The witness claimed she heard a scream and then two gunshots and called 999.”
They pause as a couple of cars go by, then cross at the pedestrian crossing. Their steady pace will have them at the next club within about five minutes if they keep up their stride.
“Depends on the case. I’m sure you deal with the same type of issues.”
“I believe number six is a good one for this crowd.”
The wooden floor creaks beneath their feet as they cross the threshold into the first bar. A few people sitting near the door look up as they enter, but quickly return to their drinks.
So much for Sherlock just having a lovely and smutty time with John...
Thank you so much for reading! We hope you’ve enjoyed reading our fic baby, we’ve had so much fun writing this story.
Later that night, John nearly had to roll himself back into his hotel room. He kicked off his shoes, loosened the bowtie around his collar, and flopped headfirst onto the double bed.
“He was complimenting my shoes, Greg. It’s clearly a cry for help.”
"Oh," John whispered, caught off guard by the crisp white paper in his hand. John might have a history of sleeping around, but consent was always required with any of his partners. Seeing the look of morbid curiosity on Greg's face, it had occurred to him that outsiders might not understand Sherlock's unique condition. "This is perfect, Sherlock."
“Perhaps not, but you want him to be.”
“I was running along the dock, chasing after Briggs. He jumped onto a nearby boat and I followed. I was halfway across the deck when—”
“Well, I highly doubt I committed anything to you other than a good time. Which I’m sure we both had, so unless you — hell, I don’t know — have a notarized document or something from me that I said that I’d hang around for coffee and eggs, then bugger off before I call the police.”
Then in the early hours of the morning, John found it. The Italian poet Dante Alighieri had written
“Anyway, what did he say?”
John wanders into Sherlock’s bedroom and quickly finds the machine under a stack of case files. He could swear they were reproducing by the day. Absentmindedly, he sits on the edge of the bed and types in what he hopes is the password. For all Sherlock’s whining that John can’t create a secure password, the man never changes his own. It takes John a few tries, but he successfully logs in.
“Hey, come with me a second?” John murmurs into Sherlock’s ear, pulling at his hand and leading him off the steps. They walk around the back of the gallery until John finds a relatively quiet street. A few people are milling at the end, but they ignore the two men.
“No, I made it.”
“I…” Sherlock began, but his throat was too dry to continue. John placed his hand onto Sherlock’s closest thigh and kept it there.
“He got me out in a hurry all right,” John murmurs to the room. “So much for sentiment, the bastard...”
The next chapter of Behind Closed Doors is finally here!! We are so excited to share it with you!! 😍😍😍 Hope you all love it and can let us know with some kudos and comments 😘 thanks so much for your continued support!!
"Jesus," John sighed breathlessly, uncaring that his chin was still damp from Sherlock's release. "Oh holy fuck, this is going to make a mess…" He caught sight of his jumper, torn beyond repair on the floor, and hooked a toe under it. Spreading the already ruined fabric over his lap, he did his best to aim as he threw his head back in a growl.
“John, I’ve been thinking and--”
“Hi,” John replies, returning her smile. “You look great.”
If it was possible to be more beside himself than Sherlock was already, he didn't know it. So much for a nice relaxing day in the flat. This was warfare from Mycroft, and Sherlock was not going to deal with it without at least being tipsy.
“No...even worse. He’s been cleaning the flat, making tea and...hugging me.”
John rolled his shoulders at her question. As if trying it on for size to see if he was able to handle even more weight on top of them.
“Got you, you bastard,” John growled. Pierce squirmed for a second, but John held him steadfast, refusing to yield. “Are you okay?” John turned now to Sherlock, who was inspecting the back of his coat, checking for tears.
John lets out a sigh, toeing off his shoes and settling onto his back. The ceiling stretches in front of him, and his eyes trace the cracks in the paint, desperately trying to gather himself. What did he want? Harry seemed convinced that it all came down to John working harder at listening, and things would just fall into place. As if all of their collected baggage could be fixed with communication, and while it’s true that both of them are shit at talking about anything deeply, it’s not that simple. Sherlock’s definitely not that simple. He’s an enigma draped in fine tailoring and snarky retorts. He’s so infuriating that John spends most days shouting himself to the point of hoarseness at just being his flatmate, let alone his lover.
“I can explain—”
The bed is unfamiliar.
Sherlock freezes, tilting his head slightly and blinking far too fast.
of her belongings before they were sent off to auction to pay off her late husband’s debts.
“Sherlock...” John groaned, his free hand scrubbing his face as Harold’s chuckles fill the room once more. “You’re on speakerphone.”
Within an instant John is in front of him, his dark blue eyes looking up into Sherlock’s face. Their intensity is almost too much for Sherlock to bear.
“What’s going on?” Lestrade asks breathlessly, his eyes flickering between the detective and Anderson, both sporting thunderous looks.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied. “I’m taking us to Angelo’s and then we’ll head back to the flat. You usually enjoy a good meal and red wine before fornication.”
Irene's smile brightens, which should be impossible. Irene’s smile could already outshine the sun.
Sherlock tries to inhale a shock of breath that his body can no longer handle, but nothing happens, and darkness falls before he even hits the cold concrete morgue floor.
It was like that with John. At least, up until the last hour. That John had accepted him regardless. His idiosyncrasies had been brilliant and extraordinary, yet it obviously wasn’t enough. He shivered at that, though he half excused it on the evening chill. The lights of the nearest club beckoned him with promises of warm drinks and faded memories. He strode towards it with a stiff nod to the couple of people he passed along the way.
“Wait, we need ground rules —” Sherlock gives an annoyed groan and lifts himself off, his eyes flickering back and forth over John’s face. “No staying the night. That was a mistake last time, it can’t happen again. We’re not together anymore, we can’t fall back into that routine.”
“So that’s it then?” he whispered. “You just tell me this and nothing else? No ideas as to where he is now, or hidden dangers? Was he hurt when you last - “
John raises an eyebrow at ‘
“I’m sorry I yelled,” John whispers, “it’s just…I thought that you told me that you’d had sex before, so the shock of - “
A young woman across the room stands up and raises her glass.
“Not just the soup…but yes.”
He can’t. His brain gets stuck each time he tries to deconstruct the problem, tripping over those graphs, now burned into his brain.
“Ho voglia di te.  Mi fai impazzire.” Sherlock frowned, and then looked into John’s bemused expression. “Parlando Italiano?”
“It was never like this before. You’ve changed me.”
“You seem troubled by that” she continued, the whip tapping on her right thigh  “Care to talk about it while I show off my skills, my good doctor?”
He frowned as he watched John shake his head. The dark blue eyes still processing all of the new information. "No, it was more than respect. The way he would look when he played his violin. It was the closest thing to love that I'd ever witnessed. That violin might as well have been his…"
A blaze of warmth floods through Sherlock’s veins, followed by a rustling of wings.
John opens his mouth to argue, but there has been way too much of that today. He’s cold and tired and wants things to be like they used to be. Either before that first kiss or the last fight that got them here, he isn’t sure which has the most appeal.
"Aren't you supposed to be all about a good time," Sherlock asked, pointing an accusatory finger in John's direction. "When did you turn into such a stick in the mud? Is it the socks I knitted? Did they drain all your
“Git,” John mumbled. “Can’t help what...happens when you kiss me, and you bloody well know it.”
Irene continued to watch his every move and listened for any inflexion that indicated weakness and vulnerability. Sherlock forced himself to appear as neutral as possible, but there were cracks in the veneer. Tiny pinpoints that Irene would be able to tap on with her delicately polished fingernails until Sherlock was truly broken open.
Once inside the garden, there was nowhere to hide. In order to get a good look at the ground, they needed to come within sight of the back windows and pray that no one was home. A wide patio spread out from the base of the house, spreading about five metres in each direction. Sherlock took out a small vial from his pocket and collected a sample of soil from where the patio met the grass and took another from the far end of the garden, right at the base of the fence. He’d take it back to the lab and cross-reference it with their existing sample. That would give them a definite idea of if the body was ever here.
John gives a soft chuckle. “Fine, you were right. You win.”
Sherlock glances over to the entrance of the bar before looking back over at John, who seems to be chewing his bottom lip as if swallowing back something a little too hard to keep down. The expression is one Sherlock recognises all too well.
“Well, I put a tea bag in, and some hot water—”
Lestrade called out to the rest of the team, gathering their attention, as Sherlock headed back to the main road. He’d look more over the particulars of this case when the body was back at the lab. Right now, he just wanted to get back into real civilisation.
Sherlock had known John long enough to see the signs of him struggling for a valid answer. The sick feeling inside of him doubled in intensity.
“Right then...” Anderson began, and Sherlock knew the man for way too long to know what those two words meant. Philip was preparing himself to make another apology, and unlike the last fifteen apologies before it, this time Sherlock was trapped at work.
A knock on his front door was a rare thing nowadays. Most people who took the energy to know his home address rarely ever came around anymore. Not unless they wanted their eyes bombarded with cryptic notes until they found an excuse to leave. Only the like-minded or masochistic would be knocking even louder now. Yet apparently John Watson's insistence was enough to get Anderson allowing him in and apologetically pushing his latest theory of bungee cord and a rubber mask of Moriarty's face off of the other kitchen chair. The scraps of paper clung onto the bottom of the doctor's Loake oxford shoes. The expensive leather of them battling the contrast casualness of rigid dark blue jeans and cable knit jumper.
"Ready when you are, Mr Holmes and Dr Watson," the driver said after shutting the boot. "Anywhere we need to head before I take you back to Baker Street?"
To his annoyance, however, Sherlock is still absorbed in the case when John finally gets home.
“I don’t fucking believe you,” John muttered. He was moving, and not towards Sherlock. Away from him. The space between them grew, and Sherlock searched for something to say. To fix this. “Not that you should do anything that you don’t want...I mean, I...I should go.”
John gets the omega - Sherlock - back to his flat and begins emergency care. Can he beat his biological clock and tend to his patient before the Alpha inside of him takes full control?
“Mine was in the bedroom.”
detective work, and how he was his
Irene sighs once more, and Sherlock wants to throw things at her now. His frustration and terror eats away at whatever is left of his brain and skin in equal measure.
He slipped into a concealed alleyway, stretching his neck to check none of the nearby houses overlooked the street. The area was eerily quiet for the middle part of the day, but that was in Sherlock's favour. After another quick look, he opened up the small bag and examined the cocaine. Even years later, he could tell that it was reasonably good quality, and though he’d rather have a sterilised needle, he’d have to settle for inhalation. Never his preferred method, but desperate times called for desperate measures.
There was an ache in Sherlock’s heart; one that he wasn’t sure how to shake. It felt torn — one half broken and bleeding in his chest, and the other half across London, alone in a cab, headed to Baker Street. For the first time, he didn’t want the chase. Didn’t want the adrenaline pumping in his system as he followed a stranger across the bar; didn’t want the uncertainty, the wondering if this would be the one he took home. Didn’t want to be alone, wondering where the next hit, either pharmaceutical or biological, would come from. What he wanted — he didn’t want to think about what he wanted. The implications felt too heavy. To admit that somehow, this was different. That he cared about the man residing at Baker Street, that more than anything, more than sex and drugs and cases and criminals, he wanted to be home, with him.
“No, but I am your friend.”
“Well, I’ve had a lot of practice.”
"Tell me everything you have so far," Sherlock demanded, his attention still laser focussed on the victim. Finally, there was something he could work with.
She stood up from her chair and walked to the door and opened it. John stood up as well. The intermittent tremor caught Sally’s eye as he headed towards the door, walked through it, and spun around to face Sally once more.
Sherlock stared at her, nonplussed. “Well, obviously…it’s The Work, Molly. There are constantly cases to be investigated, and Lestrade knows that the rest of the Yard is wholly incompetent without the assistance of John and myself.”
“That was the intention.”
12:30am: Harry was dancing with a cute blonde while John chatted up a stunning brunette. Her lips were painted in a brilliant shade of red and she suggested shots of —
Of course he'd have emergency lube.... Of course.
“And you think that there’s a solution?”
John followed Sherlock into the realm of oblivious bliss. He kept his eyes on Sherlock for as long as he could. But when the pleasure demanded he close them, he obeyed. Keeping an image of Sherlock imprinted to the inside of his eyelid, he rode the final waves of pleasure and collapsed, spent, against the sofa. When he finally opened his eyes a few minutes later, he shook his head at the state of them both and laughed.
“Yeah, that’s — everything.” John stands, his fists curling loosely at his sides, unsure of what to do. There was no guide for this. “I’m, uh, gonna get some air.”  He grabs his jacket from the rack, swallowing back the ache in his throat.
“Sorry for all that I said,” he continues, looking crestfallen. “That was a lot to spring on you at once and I’m shit at confessing my feelings about these things. First time at it and I terrify you into a dead faint.”
“Good morning,” Sherlock says brightly once John hurries into the kitchen. John feels his mouth open in shock. The kitchen is spotless except for two empty mugs on the table. Even the floor looks as if it has been freshly cleaned. “Sit down, then. I’ll have tea ready in a few minutes.” He flicks the kettle switch, and the water inside immediately starts boiling. He must have used it recently, then. Had Sherlock been waiting for John to wake?
Sherlock rolled his eyes as Seb took a step towards where John was standing. Sherlock stopped him with a well placed arm and hissed at him to
“I’m aware. Besides, John, why do you care? You’re not my boyfriend.”
“Put your trousers back on before you catch a chill,” John said with one final kiss, then took a step back, careful not to trip on his own clothing.
“Has he ever done that before?” She asks, her eyes once again full of a bright curiosity that reminds John of a much younger Harry.
Sherlock undulated his hips in time to the up and down motions of his hand. His body quivered at how natural all of this was and how remarkably raw John's voice was when truly aroused. With a sultry hum, Sherlock dipped down to touch his forehead to John's. He yearned to document it all. The slight fluttering of John's closed eyelids. The sweet taste of his opened lips.
"Since I didn't get a clear answer the first time, why are you here?"
The time passed quickly, and John’s annoyance soon faded. They barely spoke a word that wasn’t about the case, and Molly mercifully didn’t bring up their earlier conversation.
Fifteen minutes later, Harry’s phone is in John’s left hand. The photos of the previous night show what happens when an ex-army doctor decides to let his guard down. At least John is smiling in
"Now," John said in a tone that would have been better suited for scolding a toddler who had thought it smart to stick his fingers near an electrical outlet, "Will you be leaving Miss Sylvia alone? Or do I need to end this here and now?"
No, this was the right thing to do, no matter how much he wishes otherwise. John needs his life back; needs to feel like his own man again. Whatever that means. He just hopes he can do that without losing Sherlock completely.

It's BACK! lol Little by little we are chipping away at this thing :) Enterthetadpole and I are so excited to share the next update of this lovely story with you all. We hope it is all that you've been waiting for and we can't wait to add more to it! :) Thank you all for sticking with us while we navigate school, work, and just life in general as things slowly get back to "normal". We appreciate your support and are lucky to have such wonderful readers! xoxo
John sighs, digging his hands further into his pockets and adjusting his back against the wall. “Because I don’t know if Sherlock is here.”
The woman was wearing a suit and trousers, expensive, but not ridiculously so — money to spend, but not vain enough to care about labels. No rings or jewellery below the wrists and she was wearing flat shoes; not a paper-pusher then. Judging by the apparent size of her pay packet, and the sensible choice in accessories, she was a doctor — a surgeon, if he had to guess.
He watches me the entire time. Pupils dilated and lips the deepest shade of pink. His mouth on every part of me he can reach. Hands, edges of my ankles, my eyebrows and my neck. Nothing is left untouched, and this is what I hadn’t expected. That John Watson to be this doting of a lover, but how incredible it is to behold. When he comes, it is a dazzling display of lust and relief bathed in a sunny afterglow. He collapses on top of me and remarkably, I climax for a second time.
Sherlock shows all the warning signs of a patient about to throw up right where they stand. His face is slightly green, and he is swaying slightly from side to side. John watches Sherlock grip onto the side of his office desk to steady himself.
John’s eyebrows raise to his hairline.
*BEEP*
Sherlock lifted John’s hand and entwined it with his fingers, relishing the feeling of skin against skin.
“Hello?” John calls out, sitting forward in his chair and switching the television off.
John shifted where he lay and slid a single hand down Sherlock's back, tracing the line of his spine. He never wanted to stop touching Sherlock. Just his fingers on Sherlock's skin was a drug, both grounding him and making him think unclearly at the same time. It soothed the ache in his heart brought on from talking about his mother while giving him clarity to focus on the task at hand. What was it about Sherlock that affected him so? It was like being ripped into two men who still inhabited the same body.
Much to his relief, when he floated into the bedroom on his makeshift raft, Sherlock was sprawled out on the covers, grinning up at him, overtly proud of the game of chase they'd just played.
Ellie’s smile widens even more before taking John’s credit card and processing the charge. All the while, John discreetly puts the ring box in his back pocket and secures it properly this time.
“What are you—”
A small part of him reminded Mycroft that they hadn’t tried stealing classified information at the very least. Not that this was any better. Mycroft hadn’t been able to negotiate to prevent the Major General from viewing the session, though Anthea had managed to cut his feed quickly. Not quickly enough, considering the slew of text alerts on Mycroft’s phone.
“We are so right when we’re on the same page,” John mutters in frustration. “I can’t see myself going back to who I was before; I feel so alive when I’m with him. He helps me see that I am so much more than a broken soldier who somehow made it back from the war.”
John hadn't known true pleasure before the moment Sherlock's finger breached him. Every orgasm, or cry of pleasure, had simply been research before this moment. His vision swam, which was preposterous because he was 99% sure his eyes were closed and tried as he might no sound would come out of his spent throat.
"I'm probably going to be jailed over this insanity," and in hindsight that was said a bit louder than he meant, but bollocks to privacy at this point. "Call me back,
"Shit, what," John snapped, still groggy and unable to differentiate sleep and dreams from reality. He lifted his head from Sherlock's sticky chest, forcing his brain to focus. Sherlock had both hands on John's shoulders. It was obvious he'd been trying to wake him. Judging by the position John had fallen asleep in, it was no doubt to get John's weight off his chest.
It’s been a good day for John Watson. All the patients he saw today had relatively minor conditions; nothing a course of antibiotics or a few weeks rest couldn’t sort out. When he stopped off at Sainsbury’s on the way home, the self-service checkout had actually worked, and the infamous chip and pin machine gave him no trouble. Overall, a good day.
Pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger in a last ditch effort to ward off a rather nasty headache, John let out a heavy sigh before bundling up the mess of blood-stained clothing at his feet and dumping it into the hamper at the end of the hall. He would wash them later, once all of this had blown over and he was able to return to his normal life again.
He’d miss that.
This is him. It really is, and it is better than fine. It’s everything in the stratosphere and beyond. And it feels like every glance in his direction from a stranger isn’t from a stranger anymore. It’s as if they all share a spark that is carried somewhere deep within them that shines so brightly that it causes even their eyes to shimmer with it.
Then John blinks before suddenly turning pink in the face. Sherlock stares, trying to will out the rest of John’s sentence, but John is already standing up and grabbing his coat.
Making sure Sherlock wouldn't fall off the sofa and hurt himself further. John hurried into the kitchen to see what their options were. The first thing he spotted was the half-finished bottle of scotch sitting on the table. He reached for it but stopped with his fingers around the neck of the bottle.
“Okay.” John’s smile spread as he leaned back into his chair, picking up his wine glass and taking a sip.
“Whatever you and Sherlock had was special,” she continues. “And regardless of what comes next, you should close that door before you open a new one. I’m sad that the new door doesn’t have me on the other side, but I’m happy to stay friends, ok?”
"Sherlock, I told you that John took all the weapons out of the flat before he left with Seb."
But now, finally, there was a lead. The soil on the base of Jacob Nelson’s shoe could tell them exactly where he had been initially buried. After three victims and no mistakes, the killer had slipped up and given Sherlock enough information to find him. All he had to do was trace the soil.
When it came to scents, Sherlock was an expert. There were at least six different articles on important scents on The Science of Deduction, and he prided himself on being able to identify a brand of perfume within six seconds of being close to an individual. Mrs Hudson wore a muted floral perfume on a day to day basis, and Sherlock could tell when she was visiting Mr Chatterjee down the road because she would apply a small spray of the Marc Jacobs perfume her sister had bought her along her neckline. Mycroft often wore Ralph Lauren, a tradition he had inherited from their Father, and Lestrade rarely wore anything at all. Instead, he could be identified by the constant aroma of slightly burnt coffee and the deodorant he liberally used.
John’s hand was warm when he did what she hadn’t been able to do minutes before. Perhaps this type of touch was what Sherlock had felt then too. John’s strong fingers held the weaker parts of the other person in place until they were strong enough themselves.
Just a short tease because tomorrow's chapter is pretty juicy.
of it, and then do it…"
"You're something else," John said, and it was not in the least bit an insult.
“I’ll pass, thank you.”
know. What I do know is he's sick and tired of being bullied by his brother. Mycroft's help comes with a price, and that price for Sherlock is something I don't think he'll be willing to keep paying. So… if I can help, no strings attached, and he willingly lets me? Yeah, I'll help. But, Jesus, Mycroft hates my guts."
“Jesus hell, you scared me,” he sighs, his index and middle fingers on the side of my neck. Checking my pulse like — oh right, he
John makes a low groan deep in his throat, and his fists begin to clench at his sides.
Much to John’s surprise, they stick to the rest of the ground rules. He hadn’t really expected Sherlock to listen to him, but it is the detective who frequently reminds him not to stay the night or get too comfortable with platonic physical contact.
Irene sighs gently and continues her energetic monologue, outlining the plans for tomorrow and instructing Molly what she should bring. As she speaks, Molly feels a stone grow heavier and heavier in her stomach. Although she knows these plans are for her, it feels too much like breaking Irene’s heart to cancel now.
Sherlock gapes back at him and John gives an over-exaggerated shrug. “Might as well get into the full spirit of the night, and anyway...less money that one of us has to spend. I’ll make sure it’s something top shelf.”
“Why not?” Sherlock replied at a normal volume. “Are you embarrassed to be here with me?”
“Still so many unanswered questions,” John muttered, glancing at the contents of Sherlock’s wallet one more time before setting it next to the envelope containing his pitiful excuse for an explanation. It had been more difficult than he had thought trying to write out everything that had transpired in the last few hours, not to mention who the hell he was and how Sherlock had come to be with him in the first place. What was worse was the fact that he had had to do so without knowing much of anything about Sherlock or how he would handle the information being presented to him at all, but somehow he’d managed to convince himself that this was better than the alternative: leaving the omega to wake in a strange location, in the midst of his heat, without any context whatsoever.
this season." He said coolly, then looked to Sherlock for guidance. "I'd rather not have my throat slit tonight. Is it necessary for him to be here?"
” Here, in my bedroom, I can hear John’s voice more clearly. His sentences are whispers in my ear, instructing me how to touch myself; where to squeeze, where to pull, and all the while he’d be pushing inside of me, filling every crevice. He’d lick the sweat from my neck, right from my collar all the way to my ear, and my mind would dissociate as we came together; thick sticky white exploding on our bellies. However, when I open my eyes, I am alone, covered in the remnants of my fantasy.
John nodded absently, and Sherlock gave a small huff.
Instead of answering, Sherlock takes John’s hand in his and pulls him gently into the room. There’s a moment where they pause, each looking into the other’s eyes, searching for some reason not to do this. John can think of a million, but he pushes them aside and leans forward until their lips finally meet. John feels the tension leave his body with the first quivering touch, and he melts into Sherlock's hands. This. More of this.
John laughed again. This time much less restrained. Warm and loving. The kind that Sherlock heard after long nights of crap telly with John on the sofa.
John snorts.
He pulled his hand away and turned to look out of the window. Sherlock was so shaken that he forgot to text Molly all together. What was that about?
“I — I meant it, by the way.” He stuttered. The words felt wrong in his mouth — casual conversation had never been his strong suit. At least with anyone who wasn’t John.
I need to know up close and personal what I have been missing for the past five weeks.
was going to retire. Do you still have a key to Anderson's flat? I'm going to need a place to dump all my weapons. His is a good enough place as any."
Sherlock scanned John's face and thickly muscled shoulders, with the smallest of pauses to the bullet scar on the left. It more than likely was a haunting reminder of what war could do to the soldiers who survived it.
It took a few weeks of trial and error, but he finally arrived on a mixture that, when he inhaled, gave him a very familiar feeling of what John did when so near that Sherlock could hold him if he dared. It wasn’t exactly the same, because at the end of things it was just a cologne, but it was strikingly close.
home."
This time John couldn't shield the tremor even if he had tried. Mycroft had prepared for resistance. Would have been surprised if John had accepted such help so easily. What Mycroft didn't expect was the doctor leaving the room and returning a few moments later with the one item that Mycroft had planned on taking from the flat. The short and nimble fingers on John's now steady left hand tightly wound around the neck of the Stradivarius.
“Have you got a new cologne?” They spoke at the same time, their words tripping over each other. “Sorry,” John apologised, but Sherlock waved him off, indicating that he should continue.
With timing that was irritatingly precise, Sherlock’s mobile buzzed with an incoming call. Sherlock glanced at it, before sending it straight to voicemail.
This tit for tat was getting John nowhere, and both of the people in this overpriced sex den knew it. He sensed that he was running out of time, even though technically there had never been a ticking bomb. On his chest or otherwise.
John furrowed his brow before clearing his throat. “I’m just...your hands were busy with texts so I figured that you’d be all right with...sorry.”
“Right, I’m off to the surgery, then I’ll get more of my stuff off Molly on the way home. I’ll see you later.”
Sherlock blinked back into the present to the glare of his own cab driver. He tossed over some money before hopping out of the car and moving towards the entrance. Images of John in various states of pain flitted across his mind, and he felt the intense need to vomit. He took the stairs two steps at a time, growing impatient when the automatic doors took too long to open. Sherlock snapped John’s name at the receptionist, practically bursting into a run once he had the room and floor number.
this man will be the death of him.
“I’m sorry about what…” John began, his words somewhat muffled as his lips were against Sherlock’s neck. “...it’s...I have no excuse for how I acted, or more how I
John deserved better.
The sound of John’s apology  sounded far away and muffled. How could Sherlock have missed such an obvious thing as an accomplice? The previous crime scenes flashed across his mind as he tried to look for missing data. All of the evidence pointed only to Pierce, but if Lestrade was correct, then there was another killer out in the streets of London.
Sherlock steps back, using his body weight to close the door behind him. The latch clicks softly into place, and he leans his head back, closing his eyes and gently counting to ten. He needs to stay calm, so he can figure out what the hell is going on. Best to start off with a simple question first.
Hard and firm reminders that John’s heart was a complicated series of muscles and blood vessels. Occasional valleys opened wide with eager tongues and willing words and John dove in head and hips first. Running erections and motivations until both were satisfied.
“Nothing, I just—” John gave a little sigh, and his shoulders fell a couple of centimetres. “I’m trying to make an effort, that’s all. After what happened...”
direct.
how people react.”
Sherlock wraps his arm around John’s waist, and it’s enough to pull John out from what is clearly the beginnings of a self-inflicted emotional breakdown. The other voices within the shop are suddenly louder as John’s tunnel vision clears to look over at Sherlock’s concerned expression.
“Not until you tell me what’s going on.”
When John drops some items off to Mrs Hudson, he casually asks if she’s seen Sherlock. She informs him she hasn’t, but she’d heard someone shut the front door in the early hours of the morning. They spend the rest of the evening at 221a, Mrs Hudson beating him at card games and John trying to squash his climbing fears. Sherlock was fine. Something important had probably come up, he could handle it himself.
He slipped back out of the door and into the cool evening air. It washed over his face and he closed his eyes, taking in a deep lungful and relishing the burn that seeped into the crevices of his lungs. There was a time, not long ago, that Sherlock wouldn’t have thought twice about following the man home, or into a by-the-hour hotel room. It surprised him now, that the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind. He had wished, beyond reason, that John had been beside him, ready to tell the young bloke exactly where he could put his drink. He could almost hear the giggles that would erupt from them afterwards, once that thirst trap wannabe had retreated with his tail between his legs.
They didn't talk directly about the restaurant again. John had seemed as if he’d wanted to, that first night, twisted around each other, but come morning, he never mentioned a word. Sherlock didn’t push it. He was unsure how he’d bring it up, how to resolve the tension that he was now carrying around with him. As the days passed, it became harder and harder to broach the conversation. So he didn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re very...organised doesn’t seem like the proper word, but that’s all I got at the moment.”

John takes a deep breath as Sherlock waits for an answer. The conversation he’d had with Mycroft has been on a loop in his head for the majority of his day, and yet now, all he wants to do is pretend none of it happened. Like it was an odd fever dream brought on by too many long hours between the surgery and this exhausting reopened case.
almost looks as human as he achingly feels.
Irene’s still talking, but her voice has faded into background noise. Sherlock can’t distinguish one word from another; the only sound he can hear is the cracking of his ribs as John attempts to push the life back into him. The hairs on his neck rise and the rhythmic cracking grates against his skin.
“Oh no, you are taking me to dinner. I plan to be truly wined and dined before I show you what that mouth is good for.” With that, John opened the door and slid out, leaving Sherlock to pay. He hovered for a moment, baffled by John’s last statement. One minute John didn’t want anyone to know about their sex life, then he made cavalier innuendos within earshot of their driver. Had Sherlock missed something? Over the years, he had become better accustomed at learning social conventions, but was this another custom he had yet to learn?
No amount of late-night touches or heated sighs could rival what the tall man with the haunting eyes gave John. Mary knew this as well, and although she absolutely had John's body, it was Sherlock's heart inside of John's rib cage.
“Fine...I am, but I can at least handle getting us some water,” John retorts, looking very proud of that fact. A few moments later, he is back holding two cups of water, their contents sloshing around as he hands one to Sherlock before slumping down in his chair and drinking fast.
“None of your concern. I’ll give you extra to not ask any more questions.”
“He’s going to be a nightmare, you know.”
It was John’s idea, although, in hindsight, he might have been joking. Anyway, it gets the idea across to anyone who thinks John is still available.
“Unfortunately, yes.”
“Has Greg...what?”
Holmes now - smoothly took a seat on the couch. As if he bought it centuries ago and finally came round to place it in some third formal living space in a summer mansion. John feared that the prickly entitlement might just pierce the cushions.
“It’s
Soft classical music fills his ears as he lifts himself into a sitting position and looks around. The dock and Briggs are gone, and in their place is a sprawling hotel lobby. The building is modern and expensive by the look of the dark blue carpeting and large chandeliers, and the light hits the glass in just the right ways to remind Sherlock vividly of a sunrise dancing on the surface of water. He turns just enough for the chestnut coloured leather sofa to shift with his weight, and he places his feet on the floor.
John’s head drops into his hands as he groans, a new wave of embarrassment washing over him. Why had his stupid brain insisted on present tense?  “Oh dear God, yeah.”
couldn't the git just
“Dublin, Ireland. Three nights and four days for a medical conference.”
At once John’s face goes from quiet reflection to absolute comprehension, and it is quite a sight to behold. I may have to stop him from fainting next.
Sherlock’s breath hitched, and why the bloody hell wasn’t this driver getting them home faster?
*BEEP*
“I tried to stay away, I tried so hard, but not one day goes past where I don’t think of you.” John lets out a breath through his nose, forcing himself to stay focused on Sherlock. His face is drawn closed, giving John no indication of how the detective is reacting. “I went on a date, I tried to move on, but every time I close my eyes, all I see is you. I want
Sherlock slinked his hands down onto John’s trembling shoulders. “Mine is closer. If you prefer it.”
On the other side of the city, Sherlock was about to throw an ancient coffee maker out of the nearest window he could find. This would involve having to go up a flight of stairs to get out of the morgue, but caffeine was more than worth it.
Only he did not sit on the leather cushion. He sat very carefully astride Sherlock’s lap. Making sure he didn't put any weight on Sherlock's legs so as not to disturb the stitches. He leaned forward and pressed his nose against Sherlock's.
Sherlock grunted as he finished typing out a new entry on the spreadsheet, documenting confirmation of John’s quirofilia. He still wanted to cross-reference it with indoor activities that would involve heavy use of Sherlock’s hands. Clay pottery, perhaps?
“How well do you know this Ms. Adler?”
Eyes still shut, John tries to focus on the thoughts running wild through his mind.
He doesn’t have long to ponder before John remerges, clutching two plastic pint glasses of water. He wordlessly hands one to Sherlock, gulping back half of his own in the process.
. She’s clutching a large hourglass in her hand, tapping her finger absent-mindedly against the glass. Sherlock’s stomach lurches, his brain winding tighter around itself as he tries to work out what's happening. How can she be here? Where even
“It’s fine,” John muttered. “It’s all fine. I want you to.” He took Sherlock into his mouth again, sinking all the way to the base, swirling his tongue around the shaft as he did so. One more sensual lick, and Sherlock came, his muscles contracting in waves as his hands fisted into John’s hair.
“Dead, last I heard from every credible source out there. For quite a while too. A shame for such devastating cheekbones.”
So she did know who he was. Good. That always saved time.
“Yes.”
Hope that you enjoy!
“Erm…” John began, trying to push all thoughts of Sherlock’s nakedness out of his mind. “Three suits and two pairs of dress shoes. My laptop and some medical textbooks. A tie?”
“He could still be in there!” John had angrily whispered as he pulled Sherlock out of the house’s view line. He had a point, but Sherlock was beginning to get restless. He had to force himself to take a deep breath and calm down — rushing would only make the whole case collapse around them.
“No? I mean, it’s annoying sometimes, when you had plans, but we both knew this before we started dating. We’ve accepted it, and we make the next time we see each other even more special.”
“...you’d what?” John asks, his hands now on his hips and glaring again. “Is this your way of telling me that you don’t want me here? You want me to move out?”
He was floating on a piece of driftwood throughout 221b. Only, he realised, it wasn't driftwood, but the table he'd thrown through the window. He was using the pieces of broken toaster to paddle after Sherlock, trying to catch his elusive lover, who ran before him giggling and quite naked.
“John, I...wait...I…”
But Lestrade was implying something more. Was there some unspoken rule of relationships that Sherlock didn’t understand? In his experience, regular coitus defined relationships. How else were they distinguished from average friendships?
John grumbled something that sounded very much like piss off, and Sherlock chuckled back before picking up his own glass of wine and waiting for John to follow suit. John did, with a soft smile before raising his eyebrows.
The next song is something heavy on the bass, and even though Sherlock has no idea what the song is, the crowd around him are happily bobbing their heads to the rhythmic beat. Even though Sherlock can’t hear John’s laughter because of the music, he clearly can see the telltale motions of John’s body and mouth in a fit of giggles. Sherlock tosses back his head and begins to do what is pointedly a waltz. His body moves to and fro, absolutely at odds with the song. The lyrics are a mix of grunts and groans with the occasional
“I’m the same since the last time you tried to open up this can of worms,” Sherlock hissed.
He grabs my wrist and pulls me over to the bed, accurately predicting that my knees will give out sooner or later. His knees nudge my legs open and my trousers and pants are pulled down to my knees. He slides a condom over my already hard length, and I glance down to see him between my legs. John kisses my stomach, then travels lower until his mouth envelopes me whole. I groan and my hips push instinctively up and in. His mouth is a simmering fire and everything on me feels too tight. He moves his hands and gently pinches my nipples, all the while rolling his tongue around my shaft with a skill that should not be possible.
“That boyfriend of yours needs house training.” Anderson sneers from behind him. John turns to see the forensic technician standing a few metres away, his hands in his pockets.
He remembers pouring over all the books he could find, venturing to the city when the materials he wanted were absent from his local library. Mother had helped him, driving him back and forth to bookshops and libraries, but to no avail. Everything he found was either so brief it was not worth reading, or was filled with horror stories — other men who had suffered the same fate as Alan Turing. He tried asking his teachers, innocently asking them questions about the gay community, but each time he was told in no uncertain terms to keep his mouth shut. One particularly kindly teacher, Mr Trevor, had snuck a small pamphlet in his bag — an advertisement for a gay bookshop in London, halfway down Marchmont street. One weekend, he and Mother drove into the city, and he spent hours scouring the shelves, buying as many books as he was allowed.
"About us like this," Sherlock responds, and he interweaves the fingers of his free hand into John's. "My head feels less noisy when we kiss...goes completely quiet when we do more. But you're aware of those facts."
“How have things been?” she asked as John settled down in the seat right across from her. His smile faltered a bit by the question. As if he was rearranging the answer to something softer to spare her from the sharpness of the truth, and Molly hated that so many people did that. Assumed that she needed to be handled with care.
John sits back down.
“That’s it. That’s all I remember. One moment I was airborne and the next I was here, and —
Sherlock took John's hand touching his face and turned just enough to be able to place a soft kiss into the centre of his palm. He interlocked their fingers before inhaling a deep sigh. The focus that John gave him was all-encompassing and disorientating but so wondrous in so many ways.
“Did you find out why Sherlock was so worked up yesterday?” Greg inquires after a long gulp of his own drink.
John considers watching television before deciding against it. The noise of a football game is libel to have Sherlock throwing something at the screen, and with most of the easy to grab items within his reach being heavy art books or dozens of paint bottles — the television wouldn’t survive the onslaught.
Sherlock tilted his head but then moved it back into a less confused position. Unfortunately, Lestrade still felt the need to smirk.
Each book he read filled him with deep-seated confusion; the more he learnt, the more connected he felt — but at the same time, the more alone he became. He was living in a world that didn’t want him to exist. Still, there was some joy to be found, and the older he got, the more comfortable he felt.
“I can’t concentrate, John. Not with you—” Sherlock flaps his hand in front of him. “—hovering around all the time!”
, which Sherlock called it on his spreadsheet, Sherlock laid out his carefully constructed theories. The ways John smiled at certain things Sherlock said, and how John licked his lips when Sherlock wore certain clothing. Each piece of information was a wealth of knowledge on how to make himself as appealing as possible.
Sherlock moves to press delicate kisses along his jaw, behind his ear, and down his neck. Each one makes John shiver, and he feels his knees become weak. It takes everything to remind himself that he’s not finished, that there’s more he has to say. They can’t just plough forward with abandon, they need to work this out properly.
“Alright,
John never defended him, and Sherlock didn’t expect him to. He was — a lot. He knew that. Throughout his life, he had been painfully aware of how
Over the next few weeks, Sherlock is almost constantly creating something, all in the name of the case. Sometimes it’s art, sometimes it’s just a mess, but he seems to settle on using oil paints on medium-sized canvases. He tried a larger canvas, one that was almost the size of his entire body, but it took days to paint and took up far too much space in the sitting room. Mostly, Sherlock paints John. John at his laptop, John drinking his tea with steam unfurling beneath his nose, John sat in his chair by the fire.
Sherlock grunted as he pressed the brew button again. The coffee maker gave a small and pitiful splutter but gratefully began to work this time. Sherlock barely allowed the last drops of coffee to collect in the pot before pulling it off the warmer.
"Put the gun down and sit down before you tear more stitches out." His voice was deadly serious, bordering on anger. Already he could see a dark patch of blood seeping through the left leg of his trousers. "Don't make me sedate you again because I can, and I will."
“You solved the forgery case and you weren’t going to tell me?”
“Happy now?” John huffs as we get into another cab about an hour later, but there is no real annoyance behind his words. Besides, I’ll make it up to him when we get back to the flat. Repeatedly, if my stamina can keep up with his.
"I should have heard the shower," John shook his head, brushing off the apology. "In the two days I've known you, I've forgotten every ounce of my training. Got you injured, failed to keep a calm head before clearing the flat, what next? Truthfully, I'm surprised someone like Seb hasn't tried to cut my dick off before now. If we can get Julia's number, or arrange a meeting in a public place, I'll talk with her. Just
John doesn’t realise that he’s made up his mind until he’s walking back down the stairs, cringing at each creak of the steps under his feet.
“Ah, I see. Classic dodge. Did it with my ex-husband all the time. Made the mistake of working in the same hospital, even after we separated.” She shakes her head with a disdain John relates to far too well, before she conspiratorially whispers, “Well, if I see him, I never saw you.”
“See,” John said, his voice thankfully confident. “Nothing out of the ordinary at -- “
“Fucking hell, Sherlock. You were fine for months, but suddenly now you can’t think? Why I love you, I don’t kno—” John bites the words off, realising too late what he’s said.
John could see Greg about to ask what was in the bag, but the officer decided ignorance was bliss and simply nodded. When they got out to the car, John stuffed his coat and his two guns into the bag, then tossed it into the boot. He'd have to rely on his fists tonight or Mycroft's man if Mary decided to break her pattern. Greg gave him a lift to the hospital, and John found himself mildly surprised when he readily agreed to have a non-work related pint with Greg when this was all over.
he had said to himself, retreating to grab an oversized jumper and a pair of ill-fitting sweatpants he’d received from an aunt several Christmases ago. They hadn’t fit Sherlock exactly right - a bit too short in the legs and arms - but they would do for now.
“I wanted things to be back to how they were before. To remind you that we can still be — friends.”
“Later. You can tell me how brilliant I am when I have you alone.” He half growled into John’s ear, before walking back towards Lestrade and smirking at the shiver that ran down John’s spine.
“Sherlock, I don’t give a shit about being woken up to go with you for The Work or even you going off without me; I care that you didn’t leave so much as a note to tell me where you were! I was worried, you could have been dead in a ditch for all I knew.”
“I bought drugs, John. When you were in the hospital, I was buying drugs. Do you still want to be with me?” His voice is soft and tentative, as if anything too loud will scare John off for good.
“I do, but I don’t want you to do it as a one off. I don’t want to be one of your one night stands, forgotten by the time you bring the next one home. That’s not who I am. That’s not how I see you.”
Thankfully, none of them are as brave as John Watson, who is settling in on Sherlock’s right side. A warm and sure hand rubs the middle of Sherlock’s back, careful to avoid the wings as much as possible.
"I wanted to stare at you when I first walked into that lab, drink you in and just watch for hours." John sighed and rocked his hips forward, encouraging Sherlock to go deeper, faster.
There was now a very sour taste in Sherlock’s mouth that he wanted desperately to get rid of. Molly meant well. She always did, but she was crossing the line in any opinions she had regarding what cases Sherlock should and shouldn’t take.
With one more kiss to the inside of Sherlock's leg, John reached for the lube and flicked the cap open. He didn't just coat Sherlock's entrance; he poured a liberal amount over Sherlock's cock as well. With his left hand on Sherlock's shaft, he circled the index finger of his right hand over the tight ring of muscles, waiting for Sherlock to give him permission.
So, with such a colourful history, John does his level best not to feel cornered. Unfortunately for the person who John now knows as Sherlock Holmes — consulting detective of Scotland Yard — is not aware of any of this.
“Yes, you do. Better than I sing, that’s for sure.”
“How many times did you sleep with her?”
"How is everything about you so warm?" Sherlock whispered, his voice breaking around the edges. "Radiant…like a beacon of light."
Sherlock felt the splash of John's climax flood him to his core, and he was so close as well, but he wanted to try something that he only read about. He hoisted John's limp form up his arms, with a giggle at the small sound of confusion that left John's lips. Then with a swipe of the extra lubricant left on Sherlock's inner thigh, he placed a hand on John's left arsecheek, pushed a single index finger in John's entrance, and curved in just the right way to press against John's prostate.
Irene raises her hand, and there, clasped tightly in her palm, is a short, thick riding crop. In that moment, faced with the full force of The Woman, he realises why he chose her. Why, out of all the people she could have been, all the friends and family who love him, he chose the one person who knows how to manipulate him.
Lestrade gives a soft chuckle, adjusting his coat collar. “Very true. Are you two still going to live together?”
It’s John’s turn to huff out a breath.
"Both of you need to listen," Sherlock sighed, "because both of you are connected to me, and regardless of how much you may loathe each other, I happen to be fond of the both of you...as insane as the two of you are."
. I thought that it was enough to just show you that I loved you, and
“Or they could be an ignorant twat who isn’t worth such a wonderful woman like you coddling them with excuses for their awful behavior?”
Of course Sherlock would take a small annoyance John had mentioned in the past and decide that there was only one way to deal with the situation.
Sherlock’s expression goes nearly apologetic. Yet another rare sight.
“I’m fine. Let's go.” He began to walk towards the door, grabbing his coat from the hook and pulling it on without hesitation.
“I don’t want to die.” Sherlock whispers, leaning his head back, resisting the urge to turn back to the projections on the wall. They’re still flickering through his life, recounting all the time spent in the shadows, flirting with the line between life and death.
“What’s going on?” He demanded; his eyes flickering back and forth across the doctor’s face.
"The alcohol… God, yeah? You're willing?"
"The music of his violin won't give me answers," John agreed, and he lifted the violin up like a weapon over his head, and Mycroft stared. "Because it isn't about music. It's about the item itself, and you're terrified about my discovery of that. Your words have ratted you out."
“Ah, so you did hear me. So we have Ms Trambles information if we need to speak to her-”
“This is just gravel from the driveway. There’s nothing here, Lestrade. Nothing we haven’t already found.”
Anderson frowned and then took a small step backwards. It seemed to just occur to him that Sherlock was armed with hot liquid, and he definitely was in splashing range.
“I’m dying, and John's love is strong enough for me to sense it.” He whispers, backing himself as far away from the corpse as he can.
Irene Adler, now under the close watch of the British Government, had struck a deal with Mycroft following the death of Moriarty, which granted her a pardon and entitled her to protection under certain conditions. She could no longer take home powerful clients, nor leave the country without prior authorisation, but neither of these things appeared to limit her. She used her endless connections to build her own empire -- casting her hand at whatever she fancied. The previous summer, she had designed a new fashion line; the winter before that, she had assisted in some consulting work in the East.
This chapter is dedicated to Fandoms_Unite whom we killed with the last chapter.
A few more days pass, and John does his best to roll with this new Sherlock, but there’s a constant nagging in his chest. This isn’t right. This isn’t the Sherlock he knows — the one that never noticed what he was wearing, let alone mentioned it. He’s not even sure if it’s better than the Sherlock of before, the one that would switch from hot to cold in a matter of seconds. The one that, whenever a case emerged, would throw on his mask and erect his walls, not letting anyone in until it was solved. That Sherlock was hard to be around, hard to love — but this version of the detective is just as scary. Everything feels so false, so forced.
"Oh fuck…" John swore and was torn between tipping his head back or surging up to capture Sherlock's lips. But to lean forward and kiss the beautiful creature above would be to deny him his desire to look, to see just what his hand was doing to him.
John makes a point to check the time before knocking on Harry’s front door. Not that it matters. His sister’s sleep patterns have always been sporadic for as long as John has known her. It’s as if she decided long ago that the responsibility of adulthood would have more trouble hitting a moving target.
John sighed, the photo fluttering in his fingers with a sudden breeze.
I need to breathe and ignore this. I have to ignore what John’s hands are doing when they have a purpose like bringing pleasure. I have to ignore how his face must look in the throes of passion. Dark blue eyes the colour of a winter bound storm, and how his heart races as his hips swivel as he is just skittering on the edge of a glorious climax. Curvy arse undulating as he goes deeper and harder and my hands on the small of his back and hanging on for dear life and—
John's eyes dragged up Sherlock's stomach, past the dusty hair on his breastbone, up that long neck to meet silvery eyes. He didn't remove his mouth from Sherlock's cock, or release his grip. His French was rusty at best, but he caught the gist of it, a desperate plea to keep going. He didn't quite get the second half of Sherlock's benediction, so he hoped he was not wrong in assuming it was an encouragement to continue his worship.
I’m sitting on the sofa, slowly emerging from my mind palace, when hurried, heavy footsteps rush up the stairs. A door slams above me; John’s bedroom sealing closed for the night.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock called after him, even though it was obvious what was happening. He’d failed. Again.
Over the next few weeks, he’d poured over the books, learning everything he could about the community to which he belonged. He learnt about Stonewall, the riots that helped kickstart the queer civil rights movement in America; the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK, barring the clause that insisted that the age of consent for gay men was 21 rather than the ordinary 16; section 28, which forbade local authorities from ‘promoting sexuality’. It made sense now, why all his teachers had side-stepped his questions. They legally weren’t allowed to answer.
John wanted to laugh off what she was implied, but he had done that for far too long and in too many avoidable situations.
“You’ve had plenty of opportunity to do what you were planning for at least the better part of a month by my quick estimation,” Sherlock continues; his voice is still terse, but his face has definitely softened. “And a few...beautiful songs and pride floats and us holding hands out in the afternoon sun gets you all…”
“How?” Sherlock hissed. “Give me one instance where you pointedly told anyone, on your own accord, that we’re romantically involved.”
“John’s in the hospital, that’s what’s happened. They’ve been trying to reach you for hours; your phone goes straight to voicemail.”
“Yes.” John interrupts, “Yes you stupid git, of course I’ll marry you.” He rushes forwards, taking Sherlock’s face in his hands and crashing their lips together. The kiss is desperate and deep, both of them pouring their unspoken thoughts into the other. John winds his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and feels his feet leave the ground as he is gently lifted into Sherlock’s sturdy embrace. Even now, Sherlock has to be a bloody show-off.
“It’s nothing, John. I only desire you to orgasm tonight.”
“Oh,” Sherlock whispered, despite his fierce need to stay silent. “I...oh…”
“And...it interferes often?”
Sherlock wasn’t used to being blindsided. It was part of what came with being a detective. He was built for connecting minuscule clues into insurmountable evidence, so when he came to the conclusion that John’s scent was drawing him even closer to the ex-army soldier, Sherlock physically had to sit down. Breathe in and out until the world became slightly less hazy, and figure out how to compartmentalise the new information.
"And Mary? You said that you would tell me everything about you and her, but honestly, I don't need to know any more than you have already shared. Especially after you told me that you love me." Sherlock inhaled a breath. "Secrets for secrets, though, like we agreed. Anderson was not only my last lover before you, but my first one as well. I lost my virginity to him, and within a month of us about to get engaged, I found out that he had been sleeping with eight people. All of them who I thought were my friends."
Another call — John was being persistent today. Sherlock declined it without hesitation before holding the home button and powering down his phone. No more distractions. He could do this. Just one hit, solve the case, then he’d walk away. No falling down the pit, no chasing highs until he couldn’t breathe, just one, solitary fix. For the case.
Sherlock turns his sketchpad over wordlessly, revealing the rough form of a figure, sitting on the sofa, holding a newspaper.
“If it helps,” Harry mentions, taking back her phone. “He’s a self-admitted sociopath from what I’ve heard. Prattles on about how working cases is all he cares about so...it was probably a good thing that you scampered off afterward.”
“Did you even get my text?”
Instead of lunging forward to kiss and hold Sherlock, John stays put. His body trembles and he grabs the back of his chair for balance, forcing himself to remain still. To get everything out on the table before he shuts down like he usually does. Like they both usually do.
John quirks an eyebrow and my mouth is too damn big for its own bloody good.
“The night I phoned you to go out to the pub.”
Sherlock frowned and leaned down for a kiss that John dodged. His expression became even more deeply wary.
It was a perfectly replicated portion of a male pelvic region. The type that was made to fuck with the expert precision and the pride of being a very expensive and detailed sexual aid. The curves of the hips fit perfectly in Harold’s large gloved hands. He held it up for the other three adults in the room to feast their eyes upon.
“He asks enough questions to check off the appropriate boxes, yes. Otherwise, I am graciously left to my own devices.” She replied, shutting the door gently behind her and gesturing into the sitting room. As they entered, her eyes flicked to what was clearly a new mobile phone on the nearby coffee table. Sherlock could only imagine what secrets were inside of it this time.
“This steak tartar is the price of a small house in Bristol. I’m sure of it.”
A horn honks inches away from Sherlock’s ear. It appears that walking out into traffic when only focused on John Watson is a bit not good. A firm grip on his arm pulls him back onto the pavement, and he stumbles, tripping over the curb, almost ending up sprawled face-first on the asphalt. He instinctively grabs at John, who wraps an arm around his waist to steady him.
“Has my brother’s treatment of you been satisfactory?”
“John? Your left eye is twitching.”
“I’d say so,” John confirmed, and Sherlock was about to turn away and bark orders at Lestrade when John stretched his hand out, palm upwards. It took Sherlock a moment to realise that he wanted help getting to his feet. He obliged, brow furrowing as John placed his other hand between Sherlock’s shoulder blades and let it slide to the small of his back. Lestrade coughed and unsubtly raised an eyebrow, and it was the last straw for the detective. He grabbed John’s upper arm and pulled him away from the scene.
John jumped at the information, then twisted his body around from his chair to glower at the hall.
John nods so quickly Harry can’t help but laugh. It’s almost odd that John can meld so easily with Harry after all this time, as if the last years of turmoil have been simply wiped away. A part of John wants to pretend that the Harry he was angry at for so long was an alcoholic doppelgänger, and his actual sister has finally managed to escape from wherever she had been held captive. Maybe, in a small way, that’s exactly what happened.
It was exhausting to wait for the other shoe to drop, and yet Sally did so. Made her rounds or pleasantries with a slightly softer edge. That was what made her more approachable as of late. A new attitude to go with the new promotion, and she needed both of them to hang on for the long haul.
Sherlock rounds on John and hisses. “I told you that I knew a competent tailor who could make adjustments for my wings by the end of the week.”
Mycroft tapped the floor of 221b with the point of his umbrella. His polished shoes juxtaposed to the unswept floors, and his movements froze as the lock of the front door clicked open.
“I need to catalogue what happens,” Sherlock whispered into John’s neck. John gasped as Sherlock gently brushed  the tip of his cock with his thumb. “Need to know what makes your pupils blow wide and moan out my name. Tell me, John…”
“I am not!” John protests, but his sentiment is undercut by him tripping over his feet and barely remaining upright.
"John," Sherlock rasped, which was astronomically stupid because, of course, that was John in between his legs. Sherlock's hands were on each side of John's bowed head, gently gripping him as John nuzzled in even deeper. The first actual sensation of a miraculous tongue on the side of Sherlock's shaft sent a jolt up his spine, and the bell clappers broke free from their bowls.
“You couldn’t have known. It happens, sometimes. It’s not your fault.” John murmured.
The server made a fast getaway with a hasty excuse about getting them more wine. “On the house!” Sherlock’s gaze stayed frozen on John.
The last part of the accusation was lost to the sound that Mycroft Holmes made when his patience had run dry. The resemblance to Sherlock was uncanny, and one wondered if pacing was a hereditary trait. Mycroft dropped his umbrella along with any lingering politeness.
Miss Sylvia was none other than Sylvia De Grace, a well-known actress who’d had a five year run as a lead actress for a french television drama. For the past several weeks, she'd been the unhappy recipient of Eugine Darby's obsessive behaviour. At first, he'd come across as a normal fan. He'd show up whenever she made a public appearance, shout his well wishes, and simply let her leave.  But his behaviour had quickly escalated to an obsession, where he believed himself to be in a relationship with Sylvia. Twice now, he’d found his way into her dressing room in an attempt to get close to her.
In all seriousness though, thank you to all of you who read, give kudos, leave comments or just lurk in the background. You're amazing!
“I’m aware. You liked him very vigorously until at least four in the morning.”
“Sherlock?” John calls out, but there is no answer. Instead, as he moves down the stairs, he hears the small shufflings of the kettle, the padding of bare feet on the wooden floor, and lastly the most disturbing thing he has ever heard since moving in with Sherlock. The sound of Sherlock whistling. What the hell?
Admiration. Lust. Devotion. And something else he couldn’t quite put his finger on.  It was all there, behind John’s eyes. Those deep blue, beautiful eyes. God, is this what he had become?
This isn’t the end of the conversation at all, and John bloody well knows it. Even if Greg wasn’t a detective himself, they have been friends for long enough for Greg to want to know more. For a few minutes they seem to be biding their time, the only sounds between them sips of coffee. John searches for a Sherlock-free topic, and struggles to find one. How has Sherlock become so much a part of everything he thinks and does?
They swayed until they somehow made their way into the kitchen. Sherlock lifted John onto  the table, desperate to remove the height difference. A pile of papers slid to the floor, exploding into a flurry of noise as they hit the tile. The sound mixed with John’s moans, heady and deep as Sherlock’s clever fingers unzipped his fly. He paused, his hand hovering over John’s underwear, the fabric wet with pre-come.
John met Seb's eyes and nodded once. Together they both let go of Sherlock's arms, and John lifted his weight from Sherlock's legs, though he remained in place in case anything went pear-shaped.
The bedroom door creaks open seconds later, and John opens his eyes once more to find Sherlock slinking in and crawling onto the mattress. His ebony curls are tousled by sleep, but still lovely to behold.
John eyes him in that way Sherlock has seen before. When John is trying to figure out if Sherlock is being thick on purpose or if it’s genuine puzzlement. There's an oddness in seeing it from this intimate of a space, where he and John appear to be sharing the same intense yearning for disclosure.
Sherlock doesn’t reply. He busies himself with the kettle, pouring the water into the mugs and straining the teabags.
“Room 44. I’d head over now. She doesn’t like it when people drag their feet.”
"Tell me as much as you can about as much as you know about this Morstan woman, and also…what are you
No. Sherlock apparently knows nothing about this man in front of him. This mysterious beacon of light which shines a light for him to follow through the world has evidently shimmered in twinkling shades of LGBTQ+.
“Nothing but superfluous data,” Sherlock grumbled as John placed the cup beside him on the examination table. “As if Lestrade requesting me to go over the same information is anything other than an exercise in insanity.”
"He listens to me maybe five percent more than Mycroft, so not great. Why, though? What are you planning to do? You must know that taking her on by yourself is suicidal, right?"
The purple-haired girl smiles warmly at him when he places the items on the counter. She has a square name tag pinned to her chest:
She slipped her palm underneath the instrument, much like one would cradle a newborn baby. With slight trepidation wrapped in a soft sheen of reverence. The strings shone in the light of daybreak and reflected in her own widened eyes. Something this cherished belonged where it could always be adored.
“The place belongs to Ms. Adler,” John says to Sherlock’s questioning look. “We’ll be meeting her in the morning to give some input on how you might have become a Belstaff vampire.”
“When have you ever been one to give advice on talking about feelings?”
“Oh, I understand completely. Sometimes we have cases that will last for days on end, without a break.” He pauses, realising his mistake too late. “Had. We had cases.”
“That’s not what —“ John started and then threw up his arms. “Mad...I’m mad for all of this. Can we focus back on the body and not our sex life? Please? Anyone other than me and the corpse on the table want to get on with the case?”
