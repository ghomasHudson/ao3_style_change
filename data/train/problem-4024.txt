Furrowed brows suggest serious pondering on the little girl’s part, before shaking her head profusely.
Cas attempts to calm the large, and highly excited (that’s not a euphemism) golden terrier mix. Dean supposes the current lavishing of Cas’s face with his tongue serves as ample punishment for his husband's teasing.
"What’s that, sweetheart?" He asks Cas to repeat himself, still in a dazed limbo between wake and sleep.
"Yeah, so, when I wake up, before you, that is… I, well, I. Fuck it," He takes a readying breath, before hurrying out, "I try and remember the blues in your eyes."
Dean chuckles lightly, grazing his fingers along the line of Cas’s back, nearing closer and closer to the waistband of his boxers in every downstroke.
Cas doesn’t do that. He talks to Miracle, and all the animals at the clinic, really any living thing he’s come across, as though they’re just as capable of conversing as humans.
"I told you the carpet was better than hardwood," Cas deadpans, before rolling his lips to stifle his own amusement, and they barely get themselves tucked back in before the door swings open. He’s lucky, as Dean had just started formulating his revenge plan to drag him to the floor as well, finish what they goddamn started.
on that train, even if it is just Cas looking for a distraction. They'll definitely be coming back to this later. Surveying the door, he falls back into Cas’ eyes and says, "How much time do you think we have?"
Just as he is about to step out their door, Dean clears his throat with a sudden burst of confidence. He feels a nervous blush, though, when those sapphire eyes look to him, patiently waiting.
"I know, Dean." Cas is breathing hoarsely into his neck, short bursts of heat he barely feels over the curling in his gut, the simmering of a pot about to burst. Cas pulls away slightly, face barely a couple inches from Dean. His blue eyes navy, rich with lust, dark hair curled from sweat, lips bruised red beneath half-a-week stubble. He watches intently as he starts to roll in time with Dean’s movements, gazing down in awe as Dean cries out from the sensation.
“C’mon Cas.” He encourages further, jerking his shoulder lightly to jostle the dark-haired man, “What were ya doing, huh?”
His darling pulls away in a broken gasp when Dean finally wraps his hand around his cock, already hard, leaking precome from the head. Dean would feel smug at how far-gone Cas is already, if he wasn’t just as himself, practically vibrating in his grind against the body under him.
Dean laughs at the deadpanned reply, and the sound reverberates through their room, causing his husband’s frown to deepen. Even with his knitted brows and pinched lips, the expression in Cas’ eyes never fails to overpower it all. Eyes that tell of a similar, if not restrained, mirth.
“Ah yeah? And what have you been doing all day?” Dean thought as clear as possible and with more anger than he intended.
Instead, he was trying to remember if his mom had ever said anything about that sort of thing and then again why he cared. She was his mom, and he loved her, but she didn't raise him and therefore had no say in his love life.
At first, he didn't see anything unusual. There were his normal weapons, some riffles his dad had used for hunting and a collection of knives his brother had gathered during his childhood. They were perfectly aligned, and if anyone ever opened this secret trunk he would be in jail before he could say 'demon'.
Dean blinked and realized at first, that Cas was not, as he had assumed, standing next to him and shaking him awake. Instead, he was alone and the light was way too bright for his pounding head.
It should have been completely dark, but some constant flickering came from above, what explained why the hunter had been able to see the eyes of the demon.
“I… I need your help, Dean,” Cas said with his gravelly voice looking down and then at Mia for reassuring. “Mia had her first bad dream, I think and now she is a little bit cranky. We woke up her mother, so we cannot stay and I thought since you have a couch maybe we could stay here.” Before Dean could even open his mouth, the blue-eyed man in front of him hurried on. “I know, you have your own garrison to keep you awake right now but we promise we try to be silent and don’t disturb you further.”
He, Dean Winchester, confirmed bachelor, proud non-traditional omega had a mate. The longest commitment he had made prior was the Batman-shampoo abonnement he had forgotten to cancel after a month. But there was no time to freak out about this.
They would have to care for a small alive human being in a short time and it was written on all their faces, that they rather liked to face a monster in a direct fight than eighteen years, and probably all of their lives in constant fear.
“Wait, are you Dean?” the lady suddenly asked as realisation drew across her face. It was now Deans turn to be confused, so he just nodded.
It was one day later and therefore a Sunday when Dean took the trash out because party people always left a lot of garbage behind.
Instead of thinking about it for too long, Dean settled his mind to the task at hand and started to unbutton Cas white dress shirt. It was normally accompanied by a blue tie, but the alpha had supposedly tried for a more casual look today. The skin of Cas bare torso felt wonderful under Dean's hands, and he would have continued exploring it if Cas hadn't leaned down to kiss him again. The arousal in their mixed scents was more than obvious in the room, but Dean only felt himself slick as soon as Cas pushed forwards and brought their erections together.
As Cas spotted the Impala, he said his goodbyes to the disappointed looking girls and approached the car.
Shit, Dean thought as he killed the engine and helped Jo out of the car. Saying that he was afraid of his mother in law was a big understatement; he was utterly terrified of her since he had met her after their wedding. He could understand that she had been pissed that her only daughter had married without her being there, but she also had a big collection of rifles and knives and a stare that could possibly make hot springs freeze.
“So, the ultrasound seems to be excellent,” the doctor started and Dean suddenly noticed Glynn fidgeting around nervously with her sleeve. At the same time Cas went unnaturally still. “Do you have any complaint, problems or pains? Maybe we can find something to make your life easier.” The doctor directed this question only at Glynn, who seemed to take a very deep breath to brace herself.
She was now standing in front of them breathing heavily and having a very angry expression on her face.
After doing what was necessary, Cas send a last smile to the older hunter in his mind and transported himself in his own vessel.
Although he promised. Every time he left, the last thing he said to Dean was that he would do everything to come back to them. Sam knitted his brows together the first time but gave up afterwards.
“Dude,” Dean greeted his brother chuckling. “You don’t have to pick up the phone when you’re in the middle of-“
“Let’s go,” he said to Sam and started into the direction of the exit. As he passed the guy, whatever his name was, the other opened his mouth to say something, but Dean patted him on the shoulder. “And no more going out in the dark for you, boy.”
Sam’s eyebrows rose so high that the older Winchester worried for a moment, that they would lift of. “Dean, do you really think that is a good idea,” he asked. At Dean’s confused look, he added: “With you know…” and gestured with his hand to his temple, in a manner, that normally displayed, that somebody was crazy.
He closed his eyes and suddenly heard a crash above his head. It was accompanied by a blinding purple light and a shock wave so strong that it blew the werewolf off Dean and the others against the walls.
The worst thing was the pain in his head shortly followed by his left leg. He tried to remember how he had gotten in a bed under a blanket, but every second of thinking, the pain got worse. He wanted to open his mouth and ask where the hell he was but remembered that he should probably open his eyes first.
"Well, you're his true mate," she stated as if it was an unavoidable fact. It probably was. "And I think it's a pretty dick move to let him go through all of this pain of rejection if you're just going to show up on our doorstep again."
The big night comes, and there are only two possible outcomes: Either Dean gets free or he dies. Or is there another one?
On his left side, a small bed was set up, in which a very small looking Mia was sleeping in enlightened by the light under the ceiling in the shape of a bee. Dean was almost melting as he followed the apparently hand-painted figures on the bright yellow walls, that told stories about bears and squirrels and all the animals in the world.
As they walked into the Winchesters living room, Mia was already giggling again. It was still shy and silent, but Dean was really happy to have her content again.
The older hunter wondered for a moment, why Cas was not correcting his mind brabbling, when he suddenly heard a voice in the church speaking.
“So, she will not like this, but we need to get her a little bit cleaner. It’s almost fall, that means it’s not nice and warm,” indicating by his voice he was now talking to the half-a-day old person of them, “but we will be fast, all right?”
They had found out the day after the open house with Sam and they couldn’t have been happier. Whoever bought Dean in that bar seven month back, was a saint. He now had everything he had wished for and even more. Because Jo was kind and wonderful and caring and he loved her, but not in a romantic way.
“Well, I have these weird pains,” she started and the brothers stared at her while the angel had his gaze fixed on an imaginary point on the opposite wall.
Coming closer and ignoring Jo’s Mum in the process, he crouched down next to his wife and his twins. The baby girl seemed to have herself exhausted, seemingly asleep to gather new strength to annoy her parents, whereas her brother blinked up at Dean with clear baby-blue eyes. Man, the two of them really needed names to address them better.
“I will come back to you.” Cas didn’t even skip a beat. He took another step forward wrinkling his forehead as if in concentration.
But it was too late for that now, as a message on his phone alerted him of the arrival of Benny in front of his apartment. Well, wasn't it a beautiful day to go down?
“I can not heal you directly, Dean.” This seemed to frustrate him very much, as the Winchester noticed. “So, Sam and I decided to preserve my… vessel for an unknown amount of time and keep you alive by having an angel inside of you. Only if you consent of course.”
Actually, he wanted the other to touch him very, very badly. That was not good. The omega licked his lips unconsciously and stepped another step back, even if everything inside of him urged him to get closer to his alpha.
“Yes,” Cas said, smiling slightly at the sight in front of him. All the fluttery feelings in his stomach from the last time they had seen each other came back to Dean with a great force and he couldn’t do anything but stare into blue eyes for several minutes.
The patchwork families first Christmas passed and it was everything, Dean had secretly wished for as a kid. They had a big tree, glittering full of lights and ornaments, gifts for everybody and a wonderful dinner cooked by the older Winchester himself.
“Are you ready to meet the family?” Dean asked and grinned a little bit at the prospect of seeing the sheriff and the girls again. They always had too much to do to drive over and when they did, there was a crisis or somebody was dying.
“Wait, I need to…” Cas seemed to be at a loss for words, something that was rarely seen in him, even as he became more human. The hunter tried to not look too hopeful but probably failed completely.
Cas sky-blue eyes flitted shortly to Dean’s face before looking away again. It seemed as if the dark-haired man was not sure how the other would react to something he was about to say and it made Dean’s hands sweaty.
And that was that. They said their goodbyes and Dean stood thinking in his front yard until Jo called for him and he headed back inside.
“Back then, right on the day of the funeral, Zachariah offered the exact same contract, I just signed to me after my brother Gabriel declined. He wasn’t as… insisting back then, and I thought after I said no, he would leave my family and me alone, considering I had no idea he had been behind their deaths.” There was a sadness in their bond that Dean wished to get rid of right now, by hugging the shit out of his mate preferably, but of course, he couldn’t.
“She also said, she sets me free,” Cas said blue eyes full of adoration and wonder. How could this wonderful man ever like me, Dean thought, but voicing his thoughts as: ”Cas, you don’t have to…” he was quickly cut off by the press of the other's lips to his.
“So, what do we have here?” Dean asked as soon as he had approached the mostly covered body of a bald man in his mid-thirties.
He had to tell someone. Of course, Dean always seemed like the guy, that never talked about feelings, that was too manly and strong to admit them, but Dean really needed somebody to listen and give him some advice.
“Hi, Cas, say hello to Skylar,” Dean whispered and the angel looked up to him as if he had noticed the man just now. The hunter couldn’t blame him, since he couldn’t agree more to the fact that their daughter was the most mesmerizing being in heaven, hell, purgatory, earth and whatever weird place there was in addition.
“Yeah,” the older hunter voiced with a full mouth. He had been trying the garlic bread, and it was as awesome, as he had expected. Cas just looked back and forth between them holding a spoon and standing next to the tomato sauce, as if he had been forced to try the red substance. “Had a really nice burger there. Or was it the other one?”
“Well, the record this guy gave me, or maybe I took it without asking, but I didn’t understand the human concept that well back then-“
Out of the window Dean had watched the sunrise for a while until they came across a sign, that said “Sioux city 30 miles”. They needed gas, they needed baby stuff and they needed food. There was no better place to buy stuff anonymously than good ol’ shitty Walmart.
The first thing Dean recognized, was that some of them had partly burned faces, some of them not even healed and he ha to swallowed thickly. Then he noticed, that something was off. It was as if some kind of energy was pulling him to the middle of the group, but that couldn't be since there were only some guys talking to Zachariah, who turned around as he heard their footsteps.
"I don't care much about gender, but I do like being...penetrated." Castiel stared at Dean who was blushing at Castiel's bluntness. "Besides, I think I want to have a connection with the person I'm having sex with."
"And I would do the same for you. But listen, Dean. This Other Dean? He can't do that. Not anymore, because his Universe is destroyed meaning his husband, whom he left behind, is destroyed too. There's nothing of him left to bring back." Castiel looked Dean in the eye, it felt like he was staring into his soul. "He can't do that. He could've died next to the person he devoted his life to but he didn't because he thought he was doing the right thing. And he turned out to be wrong."
"Thanks." Dean looked Jack up and down, grabbed the beer, and moved to let the younger boy in. Jack hurried and sat down on the spinning chair, he rocked side to side and watched Dean situate himself back on the bed where it was dipped slightly.
Other Dean was okay with his room. His brother's turned out to be bigger but he assumed it was because Sammy needs more leg room. It was somewhere around 4 in the morning when Other Dean quickly stood out of bed and shuffled to the kitchen for a glass of water. He couldn't stop thinking of his dad who had held their heads, pressing their foreheads together and whispering assurrances—promises, that were never met.
"Good. Delightful. Seven it is." Balthazar disappeared, Dean was sporting an angry expression and Sam was quite surprised but laughing. Castiel was in pure shock.
Castiel looked up from the cat but didn't stop scratching. "I can't." The man who Castiel now recognized as the bartender looked a bit surprised, his eyebrows shot up and his lips pursed slightly.
It had been more than 8 hours of board games and movies when Other Dean walked in the living and sat next to Cas who was watching more Netflix with Jack. Castiel turned to look at him. "What movie did you and your husband like to watch?"
"You like my gift?" Dean mumbled into Cas'ear. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's neck and leaned back.
Except, he knew Sam didn't mean that. He knew Sam wasn't assuming. Sam's intelligence and inuition had always amazed Dean. In this case, Sam was practically telling Dean he knew. He knew Dean was afraid to even make a move with Cas, and if he was embarrassed it was because he was trying something he had never tried before. He was encouraging Dean to continue, to not let the emotion stop him because who knows for how long Cas would endure being avoided?
"You two take care, yeah? And you tell me whenever you need help with that little devil. You better tell me the due date because I'm gonna be the first one to make it laugh, you watch." Dean forced himself to laugh as he felt his eyed water.
Castiel frowned as he served food on a plate for Dean. He set the plate down and turned off the stove. "He's not a wacko."
After Castiel left to his room, Dean re-locked the door and tossed himself into bed. His face in his pillow and his hand snaking into his loose joggers. He was half-hard, he began stroking himself slowly. He closed his eyes and imagined Castiel in a cowboy hat and boots, chest glistening in sweat, thighs spread wide and flexing as he bounces up and down. Dean's forehead creased and his mouth opened into an 'O', drool sliding onto his pillow. His strokes getting faster until he came into pants. He groaned quietly.
"Do you think they'll be big like me? Or a baby?" Jack asked, smiling. The older man shrugged in response, still not looking at Jack. "I kind of hope Castiel tells Other Dean. They could be this great big family -- you know? Normal, like in the movies. Maybe they'll buy a house with a lot of backyard space and --"
Castiel hadn't paid much attention, but now (while he faced it) he realized how well endowed Dean is. "Suck." Dean ordered.
"You can't stay here." That's what Dean had said. Dean didn't want Cas, he didn't need another thing to worry about. Right now, the way he was, Castiel was truly a burden. A "baby in a trenchcoat" except he had no trenchcoat. His chest tightened again. He felt naked. He wondered if this was how Dean felt when Castiel asked to borrow his necklace to find God? It all seems so silly now.
At some point Castiel stumbled into a library, much like the ones Sam and Dean would visit to do research for hunts before they had found the bunker. Cas didn't trust computers much, but he supposed he didn't have many other options. What was the saying? Beggers can't be choosers. Dean had said that once or twice, he was sure. He entered the building, nicely air conditioned and quiet. The lights were dim but bright enough to read in and it smelled of pages of a new book. The receptionist looked up briefly at Castiel, smiled, and said hello. He greeted her and looked off to the left to the table of computers. Two of the six were being occupied, one by a teen boy and another by an older woman. Cas sat at the farthest computer, not wanting to make them uncomfortable.
Other Dean nodded, scanned the text and grabbed a book. He felt the tension rising between Cas and Dean so he decided to share. His heart was heavy and maybe if he just talked about it...
Poor Sam was stuck in the middle of all of this. He was either talking to Castiel about angel things, like how not all angels were related and how very few have children. How bondings worked and how garrisons were run. When he wasn't with Cas, he was with a very panicky Dean. Lately, Dean has been wanting to hang out with Sam way more than with Cas. Which wasn't too weird, except for the fact that Dean never pestered Sam this much. Hell, he even goes out with Sam on runs. To be fair, Dean doesn't run, but he goes out with him. Sam assumed that he does this to not be alone with Cas in the bunker. Whatever it is they need to discuss, he hopes they do it soon.
Castiel nearly fainted when Balthazar said: "Oh! Be sure, I tapped that." He sent a wink Castiel's way making the angel stumble as he stood up in a hurry. "Quite the freak in the sheets, aren't you Castiel?"
Dean tried to help, he really did. The day after Other Dean and Sam left, Dean took Castiel to a bee farm and to eat burgers. They spent the night watching animal documentaries Cas had always been interested in watching. Dean spent days hanging out with Castiel, but he begun to tire.
"Did you not hear me earlier? I said, even though he in a male vessel, he is still very much able to carry a nephilim."
"Thank you. It's...embarrassing but I feel like I want to talk about it. Balthazar and I were doing fine, and we got to the point where we were going to engage in...sexual intercourse." He looked briefly at Dean, who now had a stern look on his face. He looked away. "I got lost in the heat of things...and I may have said someone elses' name." Again, a glance at Dean before staring at the wall.
The door swung open, Cas felt his knees tuck in closer to his chest in attempts to hide from the stranger's line of sight. A woman, tall and sparkly, stepped out. A deep voice was shouting from behind her: "GET OUTTA HERE FREAK!"
"You look so beautiful." Dean whispered before grunting and cumming into Castiel. Cas felt a hot stream hit his insides and when Dean pulled out he felt something trickle down his thighs. "So beautiful.." Dean said again.
It was clear, to Sam at least, since highschool that Dean wasn't just into girls. He remembers being around Dean and Lee, how inseperable they were and how uncomfortable Sam would feel as a third-wheel. Much like how Sam felt with Dean and Cas.
Dean swung the door open, his eyes squinting because of the brightness of the hall compared to his dark room. "Whad'ya want?" Dean mumbled.
"Okay." Other Dean moved his hand away and Castiel frowned at the loss. Castiel sighed, how easy it is for him to love this new relationship only for it to ripped away.
Castiel stiffened, he turned his head slowly to look at Dean. Dean noticed the confusion on Castiel's face, but the effort to refrain from showing too much emotion in fear of making Dean feel judged.
It's been a while! I've been busy lol, hope you like this chapter! Comment your thoughts! If you want 😅
"So uh..." Dean kept his eyes on the screen. "What size? I'm thinking we get you one without all the fancy stuff to start. But do you want, like, a specific size?"
Dean chuckled softly and set the bowl down on the floor, he turned his body to face Cas. "Yeah, I get that. Sometimes I feel that way too, about Lisa. She was the closest I got to a real relationship." Castiel nodded in understanding. "You know, you could always try Grindr?" Dean suggested with a smirk. "Or Tindr, if you wanna try dating a girl."
"Y-yes! Right there! Fuck—" Castiel looked down towards where the action was happening. "Dean, I need more!" He pleaded— no, he begged.
"Anytime!" He nearly squeaked. He heard Cas chuckle and felt Cas lean his head onto Dean's shoulder. They had done this before, but Dean couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the touch. He didn't say anything, though, because he was enjoying Cas' company.
"Well, what ARE you doing up? Was I at least half correct?" Castiel asked, moving around Other Dean to open the fridge for a cup.
The following days, Castiel spent most of his time moping. Sam and Jack would do their best to distract him, but Castiel wouldn't budge. What he had with Other Dean was like finally eating after being starved for weeks only for the food to be ripped away from you once you were allowing yourself to enjoy it. He hadn't known he was that starving until he had his first bite.
"Oh, I'm sure you'll have more than words in your mouth tonight." Dean said with a tone laced with venom. He watched as Castiel went stiff. Dean felt the guilt pang against him, but he couldn't go back now, so he kept a hard face on.
"Hell yeah I am! This guy is stealing my thunder. I haven't been flirting with Cas for 11 friggin' years for some computer nerd to come along and sweep him off his feet in two seconds." Dean huffed and grabbed the Kareoke equipment off the shelf and dropped it into his cart, still holding his cell phone with his other hand.
"I guess that means I really mean it." Other Dean said with a grin. He watched as Castiel glanced at the clock.
It was day 8 without Other Dean and Castiel finally managed to make his own breakfast. He woke up before everyone, feeling guilty about being so useless.
"Okay! Okay, so...in the meantime, to lighten the load..." Dean hummed in thought "maybe you should try some toys?"
Castiel blinked a few times, he reevaluated his words. Strange. He usually said things more carefully, he hardly ever let his words run that way. "I..." he started awkwardly, "I'm sorry, too. I don't know what came over me." He held his slightly pounding head. "I just got angry."
Castiel turned some shade of red. Balthazar cackled and walked farther from the trio, slightly intimidated by Dean. "Oh yes, Castiel and I were quite the couple."
They all watched as Sergei walked away and out the bunker. Dean turned to see Cas' tired face, he felt awful that Cas was about to go through this. "Let's get you some rest Cas."
Both of them went stiff. Cas could feel Balthazar's heavy pants against his skin, and he could feel as the angel pulled away slowly because it got colder as he did. Castiel's eyes were wide in panic.
"I won't." Dean said, his tone matching Cas'. "I realized that I was being an idiot." He chuckled. "I was just embarrassed and I'm sorry for avoiding you."
"Why don't you start up some Netflix in the man cave?" Dean suggested. "We can watch that stupid cartoon you like so much."
"I want to side with Cas on this one, but it is a little bizarre." Sam turned his head to glance at Cas with a small smile. "You never talk about your past with us unless it's absolutely necessary, but you're our friend Cas. We should know more about you."
Once he did find the bathroom, he had to wait about an hour until he was able to use it privately. It wasn't the best smelling, or the cleanest, but he was beginning to get used to that.
"Would you like to try it?" Castiel asked with a grin, turning to face Dean in his criss-cross position. Dean turned to face him as well.
Jack waited a moment before speaking. "It would be so cool to have a little sibling." Dean looked up from the beer briefly before looking back down and opening the bottle.
"That was nice of you, to let them stay." Castiel said with a smile trying to make up for what he knows Dean heard them say.
Another half an hour was spent finding benches only to realize it was useless because of its design. Most of them had handles in the middle of it (which no one probably used) and others were too round and thin for him to lay on.
"Where are you now, old man?" Other Dean chuckled while he took a sip of the glass of water he didn't even notice he had served.
Cas hurried into the bunker, his eyes red but not yet crying. He stopped when he saw Sam and Dean drinking and lounging near the map table. Dean raised a curious brow and Sam looked visibly concerned. "Cas?"
Not another word was said as Other Sam and Dean walked out the bunker. The door closed and Castiel felt sadness. He felt his heart gripped in a tight, firm hold only to be squished. Castiel began to sob. Jack attempted to console him but Castiel shook his head and left the room. He made his way to the room Dean had given him when Castiel first moved in. He sat on his bed and cried.
"Watch your shit." Tom said simply before looking back down. Castiel stared, really taking in what Tom was doing. He wasn't sharpening his blade, he was whittling. Bits of wood fell to the floor or onto his pants. He was making a bird. At least, that's what it looked like.
"I think you should try and get some rest. It's late and people tend to wake up early in this place." Castiel said with a smile. "If you'd like, I can watch over you."
The man hummed. "Well, Castiel, I hope that I see you again. And that when I do you are in a better situation. But should you need any more help, come to me, yes?"
He found a dry area opposite the dumpster and sat down, resting his back on the wall. Had he been paying attention he would notice the artwork behind him was of a demon -- or at least the human depiction of it. Horns and pointy tail stuck out in loops of red.
Castiel bounced a final time, falling harshly onto Dean's cock and came onto their chests. Quickly, Dean flipped them over and thrusted into Castiel fast and hard. "Oh, Dean!" Castiel felt overstimulated. Never had he done this.
"Yes, thank you for coming Dean." Castiel interjected. "We got a call from Claire, another hunter, she needs help with a hunt. You can pick up one of these books. We're looking for some shapeshifter with specific abilities, the details are in the text she sent. Sam has it open on his laptop."
Night came and everyone was asleep except for Cas and Other Dean. They were playing poker. Castiel was doing his best to keep his head up.
Admitting defeat had never come so quickly for Castiel, but he supposed he never really had to admit defeat for such little things like this. Before, with his powers, should he ever had needed to find a bench to sleep on he could have scanned the whole state in less than 10 seconds and found one. But then, he never had to sleep before.
"Okay, Angel, hold on okay? I want to do something." Dean slipped the fingers out and grabbed Castiel. He sat him up and told him to kneel on the floor. Castiel did as told and found his face facing Dean's cock
Castiel raised an eyebrow while he poured some water from the jug into the glass. "I asked what you were doing up."
Dean scoffed and kissed Castiel's forehead. He kept his lips pressed against Cas'skin when he mumbled. "Little fucker."
The town really was small, he had hit the highway by midday. The end was marked by a sign bidding him farewell and a busstop. He supposed he could wait and hope he didn't need a bus fare.
. His boyfriend that he can’t even go three fucking days without before turning into some worried housewife.
“Right…” Dean says a little awkwardly. “Well, since this is happening, apparently, what’s your name?”
“Where’s your bag, man? You know my clothes ain’t gonna fit you, and you’d complain about the smell even if they did.”
Dean looks at the side of Cas’s face where it’s partially buried in the pillow, at the messy nest of his hair, down the expanse of his loose body, and finds he can’t resist anymore. He kisses Cas’s head just above his ear, and then down to his bare shoulder. The kisses multiply out as easily as anything until Cas is covered in their butterfly ghosts.
“I agree,” Cas seems pleased, and that warm energy is radiating off of him in a way that Dean can’t tell if it’s an angel thing or if Dean’s just in love.
When he looks down at Dean’s cock, it’s halfway erect against his thigh. Castiel eyes it up rather obviously, even though he doesn’t think Dean can see it from the angle his head is at.
And Castiel wants to touch, wants to feel all of the solid lines of muscle that shift under Dean’s clothes. He cups a hand around the opposite side of Dean’s neck before trailing it downwards over the smooth bump of his pec. He can feel where Dean’s nipple has hardened under the shirt, and when he rubs his pinkie finger over it, Dean quakes beneath him.
Dean extends his leg to nudge Cas’s shoe with his. They share a smile that feels like a tentative beginning.
The soft, happy spark that rises at Cas’s words douses itself out in rapid succession. The paranoia crawling under his skin represses the warmth trying to rise with a desperate fear like drowning, like waking up and realizing your nightmare was actually a memory. All that comes out of Dean’s mouth is a noncommittal, “Ah.”
“Yes, I ran into them on my way through to find you. They went out for lunch, I’m assuming to give us some privacy.”
Cas purses his lips in indignation, but sits down at the desk by the door as requested, turning the chair around to face the bed.
“I want-” Castiel gulps, “I want to spoil you. I want every cell in your body to recognize me on the most unconscious of levels, and know that my presence means something wonderful is going to happen. Something that makes you feel good in one way or another.”
“Good,” Finley says definitively, and then she stands. “Now stop stalling, Lover Boy. There’re some people on the other side of the fire who probably wanna hang out with you.”
Cas’s hands move up further, putting pressure in the soft flesh that gives just below the solidity of Dean’s skull. It feels good, and Dean finds himself sighing against his own volition. Of course, Cas notices, because he redoubles his efforts on the area. His fingers are deft and succinct, lingering only as long as they’re welcome before pulling away to move to the next spot.
Dean’s gaze drops down to his own thumb just to the right of Cas’s lips because if he holds eye contact for even a second longer he’ll lose all of his courage. Instead, he focuses on how close he is to Cas’s lips. Right there. So slowly that Dean’s stomach writhes in disbelief and heavy cream wanting, he drags the pad across Cas’s bottom lip, all the way to the other side of his mouth. In response to Dean’s gentle imploration, Cas’s lips part sweetly
might be too nice of a word, to be honest.” Dean smiles. “But you. You might just be good enough to balance us out. You always have been.” He lets the tip of his nose trace up the blue vein in the middle of Cas’s wrist until he hits the wrinkled cuff of his trenchcoat sleeve. He chuckles sarcastically. “I don’t think I was ever angry, Cas, just off balance, hmm? You took all the good shit with you.”
There’ll be bells ringing and candles lit and moments of silence that Dean can’t even figure out if he appreciates or not. Maybe he would if these people weren’t mourning in such a laughably performative way. Every business closed against the ‘Woe is me’ grief and handkerchiefs wiping dry eyes as if that’s not Dean’s fucking mom. To them, all Mary has become is a social symbol of tragedy. As if his real goddamn mom didn’t die.
He cries one night when Cas holds his hand because it feels so good. He cries when Eileen takes a bite of his homemade cinnamon rolls and wiggles happily in her seat because he has someone who cares enough to try them. He cries when Sam buys a calendar because they actually have a long enough life to look forward to that they need one. He cries when the lady at the bakery in town calls him “Honey” like she means it, like she’s looking out for him (and that one had been awkward as hell).
This seems to catch the angel's attention because he pulls his head back just far enough that he can look Dean in the eyes without focus, the tips of their noses brushing together. Cas’s hips continue to hitch into him. It weirdly reminds Dean of how you would slow dance with someone.
Castiel rolls his eyes where Dean can’t see before he pulls away. He looks at Dean who finally meets his eyes and feels his face screw up. There’s a clench in Dean’s jaw and his brow is low with some sort of self-loathing suspicion that seems to be his default. But, of course, there is a hidden vulnerability underneath.
It is almost uncomfortably easy to imagine Dean stooped over Charlie’s bedside caring for her. Maybe Dean rubs her back when she coughs too hard. Maybe he holes up beside her under the covers to keep her warm when her fever makes her shiver.
“It sounds like she had quite the vocal range for someone her age. She may have actually been showing off. Or trying a mating call she had found in a wildlife book,” Castiel adds.
There’s a knock on Castiel’s door ten hours later. It’s almost six o’clock according to Castiel’s phone.
“Hi, Jack,” Dean calls up to the ceiling and laughs when he receives an excited flickering of his lamp. “I miss you, too, kiddo.”
“You are wonderful. Even when you’re tired, you are here cooking for those you care about. You are… a natural provider. It doesn’t require someone knowing you for more than nineteen hours to see that. I may not remember what we have gone through together,” the lie feels clumsy in his mouth, “but I hope that I- when I did remember- that I told you how appreciated you are.”
And when Dean looks down the line of his arm to his hand, it’s to see the pads of his fingertips in contact with Cas’s orb, just like he knew they would be. “Hah,” he says very articulately.
Dean’s hands find his own pants to start unbuttoning them. His progress is stopped, however, by Cas grabbing them.
If there is one thing Castiel realized from the events of yesterday, it is that he’s tired of the intricate dance he and Dean have been doing all of these years.
Eyes full of stars. Oh, that’s Cas to a tee. Sometimes when Dean looks at him, he swears he can see constellations from lightyears away, before their shine ever reaches Earth, leaving a hole behind of time that’s warped and bent. One of the only ways time travel is possible, according to science.
“I’m dreaming,” Cas breaks the silence to say, something sad in his voice that doesn’t belong there right now.
Dean has to force back a blush, and when he’s unsuccessful, he uses the shaving cream on his hands to cover it up. “Heh,” he responds bashfully. He clears his throat and watches himself apply the shaving cream in the mirror to avoid meeting Cas’s gaze. “How’s heaven?”
Finally, Dean shakes his head, still grinning. “Alright, I really can’t do this anymore.” His weight lifts from Castiel’s body as he rolls off to the side, leaving Castiel with a view of the blue sky and blinding sun. He squints his eyes against it. “What’s the game plan?” Dean asks.
Cas’s left hand raises from Dean’s chest to cradle his damp cheek instead, and Dean lets the weight of his head rest into it. Dean blinks slowly. “I love you, Cas.”
And Cas hasn’t said a single word to prompt Dean, but somehow that’s what makes this easier. Suddenly, Dean can see exactly how easy it must have been for him to talk to Linden on that stream.
“I’ll let them know,” Cas replies, nodding as if to himself, the weariness that had been hanging on his face since he returned all but gone.
He doesn’t know how to respond to that, so he elects to stay silent. When he approaches the table, he realizes there’s a large map across the top of it.
Dean gasps, and Castiel sucks wetly at his pulse point. He moves his hand faster, the slide so easy and satisfying, like touching silk.
And, God, if that isn’t Cas in a nutshell. Love for every last creature, every living thing, down to even the most forgettable of nature’s interactions. Dean has never once in his life seen a bee pollinating a flower and given it a second thought, much less considered the bee as a little creature with its own soul, and here Cas is trying to create a whole heaven for it. Sometimes, Dean wonders if Cas feels the same way about humans. Both must be just a blink in his lifetime, billions of them, all the same, all disposable to an angel, and yet Cas values each one individually, with a soul and identity. Dean feels exactly as insignificant as those honey bees when he looks at Cas and tries to imagine the vastness of him.
He pushes himself up off of his elbow, using his hip for leverage against the bed as he swings his leg over both of Cas’s. His momentum takes him all the way up until his knees are aligned with Cas’s and his chest is a pillar against Cas’s back. He lets all of his weight bear down, knows that Cas can take it unflinchingly.
Anna squints at him before her expression sinks into a sympathetic frown. She rubs Castiel’s back. “I’m here to listen if you ever feel like talking about it.” She sighs when she gets no response. “I’m leaving to check on the Acacia apiary, so I’ll be gone for an hour or two. I should be back in time for you to go eat dinner.” She passes a hand across her forehead to wipe away the small amount of sweat that has gathered there. It’s not unbearably hot, but warm for a spring day all the same. The first real heat the season has seen.
Castiel pets his fingers through the hair at the back of Dean’s head, using the leverage of their placement to hold Dean steady as he licks further into Dean’s mouth. His other hand curls around one of Dean’s protruding shoulder blades. It makes him imagine Dean’s wings hidden somewhere in there, somehow, and he wonders if it is selfish of him to want to touch them.
When Cas turns back to him, his eyebrows are drawn together. His eyes rove Dean’s face before falling down to where their hands are still overlapped on Dean’s chest. Dean doesn’t know if anyone he hasn’t ended up fucking has touched him for this long.
But Dean just chuckles, and there’s light amusement in his expression. “Your face, man. Listen, I’m not young enough or dumb enough to think that people don’t recognize me and know who I am. Any of us for that matter.” Dean squeezes Charlie with his arm, and she nods along happily. “I promise it’s okay. I mean, it is my name.”
“That still doesn’t sound that weird to me, Cas. Like, meditation or whatever hippie crap Sam is into?”
“It’s sorta funny, ‘cause I always think the water feels good, but my swan brain goes nutso for it.”
Dean’s eyes catch his in a flick through the rearview mirror before they’re on the road again. “Yeah, and?”
The door opens and a slightly apprehensive Castiel peeks his head through, before entering fully. He walks to the foot of Dean’s bed and stands there, looking down at him. Dean opens his mouth to say something, but Cas standing over him is just too damn weird, so what comes out instead is, “Sit down, Cas, you’re makin’ me nervous.”
Dean’s jaw drops a little. “Right,” he finally answers. With an awkward twist to his body, he reaches across to Cas’s bedside table and opens the drawer. Sure enough, there’s a small glass bottle full of a clear gel with a clicky cap on it. Also in Cas’s drawer is a paperback book, a few loose pencils, and a sewing kit. Dean grabs the bottle out, and when he closes the drawer the pencils inside of it make a clacking noise against each other.
held.” Castiel has the oddest urge to bare his teeth. “I’m holding you.” His hand trails down blindly until he finds Dean’s sensitive and soft cock, which he grips. Dean whimpers beside his ear and the arousal in Castiel’s gut returns tenfold.
Dean nods against Castiel’s shoulder and his hand clings to the fabric of Castiel’s shirt just above his ribs. “This’s better, though.”
Dean’s chest tightens up again and he moves his nose from Cas’s neck to the vulnerable skin behind his ear where his hair curls in. He thinks about the fact that Cas could leave him. He thinks about the fact that Cas hasn’t yet. Lets out a flickering breath into Cas’s skin.
“Yes, I- I infused it with honey from the Buckwheat apiary and then jarred it to sit for the last few days. Honey, in general, can be used as a moisturizer, and it’s very good for sensitive skin when it’s diluted.”
Dean pushes the gun back and forth across the countertop with his fingertips. It takes him swallowing three times before he feels like he can get his voice together. When he speaks, his voice is rusty.
Castiel presses his face into Dean’s neck again, leaving fluttering kisses against the stubble. He feels so wonderful in Castiel’s hold, a sweet burning brand that brings pleasure.
“I can’t,” Cas says, opening his eyes again to look at Dean. They’re softer this time, and it’s worse than the blankness. “You said that I can’t. But in what context? Of course, I can. ‘Can’ implies capability, and I am very capable of loving you, Dean. It is, so it seems, the only thing that I can do correctly.”
“Thank you for letting me do that,” Castiel finally murmurs. He takes another calming inhale. “It was even more fulfilling than I thought it’d be.”
Cas’s hand trembles where it moves from Dean’s hair down to his ear and across his temple. It finds its resting place broad on Dean’s cheek. “I don’t know how to have this,” he confesses.
Dean’s movements intensify, and Castiel works in tandem with them. He lets his hand tighten the way that he likes when he’s touching himself, down at the base. It drags a primal noise out of Dean’s mouth that echoes in Cas’s ear.
Finally, to the come smeared across Dean’s front. Castiel uses his grace to refresh the washrag, and passes it gingerly across Dean’s stomach, up to where some of the come has reached the center of Dean’s chest. For a moment, Castiel just lets his hand rest there over Dean’s heart.
For a moment longer, he watches Dean, acutely aware that the man knows he is being watched. “What did you decide to make?”
, I know exactly what this calls for.” With no further explanation, Dean flops over onto his other side so that his back is to Castiel, a position that also hides his face.
He’s about to start shading in the basic blocking he has done when he feels a presence just over his shoulder. To be honest, Dean’s surprised it took this long for someone to start spying on him.
They kiss until Dean can feel his pulse in his lips, and the wet friction is enough to make him want to crawl out of his skin. His hands spread across Cas’s back, molding over the sharp angles of each shoulder blade and then holding onto the nape of his neck. Dean wants more, wants
“So, right, the two of us are walking along, and Sam tells this lady that I was ‘really interested’. Cas, this lady was ancient, and I think she had a mouth disease. I’m talking sores and no teeth. And Sam told her I wanted to ask her out for drinks! So now I have to turn her down even though she thinks
constants, letting them hiss and stick on his teeth, “let me tell you how I make them. How about I tell you how I make them, and then you just listen? You just listen, and I’ll tell you how I make them. It’s pretty simple.
When Dean nods, Castiel wraps his arms back around him and lays them both down gingerly. Dean lets it happen. These days, he doesn’t try to fight it. All of Cas’s strength, resilience, both in terms of grace and in terms of spirit, is something that Dean is allowed to lean on. So he does.
“When were you gonna tell me- Us?” Dean frowns. “Doesn’t that bother you? That Sam and I think you just- I don’t know, look like Jimmy?”
Cas swells like a prodded bruise, like maybe now he is the stray dog. “The universe does not care for reason. Reason caused the near extinction of my species. Me, Dean. I did that. And you think that this reality is better off with me in it? As if I am not a slaughterer.”
This makes Charlie pause and frown. She does a sweep of the market with her eyes as if trying to come up with an idea that would be realistic enough for Dean to let her stay. Suddenly, she’s looking at Castiel, and her face lights up.
“First, you have to get out all the ingredients. It’s good to see what you’re working with when you’re cooking. If I don’t have everything out, I’ll forget to add somethin’ important. Cinnamon pancakes are easy to make, but they’re not very good when you forget to put sugar in them. That is a mistake I have made more times than I’d like to admit, especially if I’m off my game in the morning. Lucky for me and everyone else, the second batch always seems to turn out alright.
Dean expects shock, shyness maybe, not the fond long-suffering sigh that comes from Castiel. The angel puts his book back down and leans back in the chair, focused on Dean once again.
How funny. Yeah, this is funny. The irony of believing that crying is some unforgivable thing because his father was a piece of work, and then crying over that very same man. Thinking about him down in his grave. Thinking about him when he was still alive, when Dean was seven years old, hell, up until the day John Winchester died, and how Dean wasn’t enough. He was always too much like Mary and his dad hated it. But Dean would do anything for him, to get that approval that never came. This wound that never healed, and instead got pushed to the side by bigger, uglier things. But it’s bleeding with a vengeance now.
“I was walking home on broken cobblestones just thinking of you when she pulled up like a figment of my worst intentions. She said, ‘James, get in, let’s drive’. Those days t-”
The words startle an unkind laugh out of him. “Why? Why do I have to be okay?” Castiel finally looks up at Dean through narrowed and swollen eyes.
He gazes back up to Dean’s placid face, then to his broad chest where Castiel places a hand. “I’m going to take care of you,” he promises.
Finley looks at Dean sharply like she heard everything he didn’t say just from his tone of voice. He doesn’t even have time to open his mouth to defend himself before she turns back to where Charlie and Cas are sitting.
It’s been a while since Dean’s been held, he’s certainly never been held like this, and all of the tension seems to be cut loose from his limbs. When Cas starts moving inside of him, he can tell he’s not going to last long.
Dean stares at him with something unreadable and astonished in his eyes. He pushes up, and places an almost solemn kiss to Castiel’s lips.
Cas looks all shy again at that. “I assure you, it’s nothing inappropriate. From what I understand, there is a physical sensation that some people feel when they watch videos like this.”
Sam doesn’t wait for an answer before he looks to where Cas is standing. “Morning, Castiel. Got back into the honey butter?”
He doesn’t know how a man could look so guarded and so open at the same time. Dean stares at him for a second longer and then looks away like he can’t stand it anymore.
“I’m just gonna say it. The old man wasn’t always right, Dean. He was almost never right. And if I tried to live my whole life wondering whether he’d like the way I was living, I would stay miserable trying to please him. Because I love Eileen, and I’m not fucking ashamed of it. I love the new Taylor Swift album. I love that I have my family here with me all of the time and that we have dinner together and watch Disney movies.”
. The truth being all sorts of mushy things that Dean usually keeps buried under his ribs and behind walls of arteries, that he’s sure Cas knows but that Dean never actually tells him. But positive affirmations had been a factor in at least two of Cas’s most-watched videos, and if Dean’s going to deliver, he’s going to fucking
Cas eyes him up, just staring at him, and Dean feels his slightly terrified smile drop with nerves. Cas’s damp hand lands on his shoulder to give a squeeze before it trails up to cup the side of Dean’s neck. “I’m sure it’s lovely, Dean. Now hand me the cup you’ve been washing for the past five minutes while you were pretending not to look at me.”
So Dean lets his own sniffle out, which makes Sam look up curiously. He startles when he finds Dean already looking at him, but his face smooths into something that almost says
Dean’s eyes spark. He opens his mouth, but when nothing comes out, his brow furrows. He licks his lips and tries again. “
“I’m very glad.” Cas looks so proud of himself, just for a split second, and Dean just wants to wrap him up in his arms and never let go. But the pleased expression settles out quickly into something content and serious as Cas dips his three middle fingers back into the water bowl and brings them up to Dean’s face again.
“Very sensitive, I know,” he comforts quietly. “Even more so, I would guess, with the knowledge that you are vulnerable to my touch. Does that excite you?” Castiel returns to Dean’s right nipple and rubs across it more firmly. “So unassuming, but you get harder when I handle them just right.”
“Uh- Hey, Cas,” he greets with a nervous and excited energy that he barely conceals. His hands fiddle together just in front of his stomach like they didn’t get the message that Dean should be all steady confidence right now. Seeing those little bits of the softened Dean he knows seeping out into the summer air makes Castiel’s own fingers twitch with the want to reach out and touch Dean’s warm skin.
Castiel’s stomach drops, drops, faster and more focused than a bullet before it launches back up at rapid acceleration into his throat.
And Dean can feel the way Cas is trembling acutely from the closeness of their position. The hands on his hips are grasping harder now, each of Cas’s thrusts just a little bit more impactful. His breath is coming out in frantic, bitten back whines against Dean’s lips.
“Yes, I-” Castiel pretends to look around in confusion before his gaze lands back on Dean’s face. “I remember everything.”
It builds and it builds until Dean is nodding his head and mumbling, “Fuck yeah,” under his breath. And then it drops so suddenly to a whisper on the last word, and Dean sits in it for a second. Somehow finds himself smiling only minutes after being a sobbing wreck. A new favorite, he thinks.
“Ella!” Dean greeted in delight. Even Castiel’s stomach had warmed underneath it. He felt stuck in place, holding his breath, watching. “That’s an awesome name.”
Not for the first time, and certainly not the last, Dean looks up at the sky above him to mumble, “You did real good, kid.” His hands warm against the now nipping night air in response, and his eyes sting with tears that he blinks away.
Castiel waits for their shock, and instead gets two matching placated expressions. Perhaps the men were related to each other. That makes the nearly identical plaid shirts even weirder.
Because right now, the new Dean is crying to a Taylor Swift album while he cuddles with his boyfriend's pillow. The old Dean wouldn’t have even known Taylor Swift had a new album out. For some reason, that makes Dean sad, too.
“Well, Mrs. Pogany was watering all of her potted plants with a hose as I was walking by. And I don’t know why but my brain was telling me I just had to feel it for myself, ya know? Before I even knew what I was doing I went right up to her and grabbed it out of her hand and sprayed the water all over my face. I was so damn embarrassed I just walked away, never said another word to the lady.”
Like this, Dean is all smooth lines and parted lips. There is no crease between his brows and the dimples that appear above his chin when he frowns are nonexistent. It’s almost impossible to imagine the traces of violence Castiel has seen on this face before.
He’s laying in his bed staring up at the ceiling and trying to figure out what he’s going to say when Cas shows up. To be honest, he doesn’t really feel like saying anything. It’s just, there’s an itch in Dean’s brain that he can’t seem to scratch, a part of him that wants Cas so close and in his presence that there is no mistaking the fact that Cas is back. There is no mistaking that Cas is real. He’s lost the guy so many times it’s all he can do not to latch on and never let him out of his sight again.
Dean’s fingers dance across the outcroppings of Cas’s shoulder blades, and he tries to imagine the enormous wings he knows are there but that he can’t see.
The syrupy blur that follows those kinds of dreams is a lingering safety that keeps Dean company all through Thursday.
Something like horror paints Dean’s expression. “You ever-” he clears his throat- “You remember hugs, don’t you?” Pleading.
Before Anna can respond, Cas speaks dryly. “What Anna means is that I’m not exactly a… ‘social butterfly’. I tend to spend most of my time in the stall or at the apiaries. I haven’t attended a town fire in many years.”
“If I were to show you a mirror, you’d agree with me.” A pause where the teasing deflates into Cas’s softer demeanor, those crushed velvet eyes. “You said that you had a bad dream?”
Finally, Cas relents, and Dean doesn’t know if he’s grateful or not when that warm palm leaves his dick in favor of shoving his pants down his legs and to the floor. Dean kicks them off his ankles and then pulls Cas bodily to him so that they’re pressed together naked all the way down. They’ve sorta done this before, but it’s real different now that they’re both hard. It’s weirdly fucking intimate, at the same time that his nerves are firing a thousand times per second. Dean grinds his dick into Cas’s, and his toes curl into the carpeting under him.
. Next, he draws the zipper of his pants down slowly enough that each snick of metallic teeth is audible. “I’m preparing myself for you.”
“I am so sorry, sir,” he says, and even manages to make it sound earnest. “I didn’t mean to surprise you. My buddy back here,” Dean motions over his shoulder with a pointed thumb, “he’s drunk as all get out. Completely wasted. Called me up to tell me where he was and when I got here he was passed out.”
“I don’t know,” he tries to joke, but his voice is thin, “it’s been a while for me, Cas. Not sure if I remember how to or not.”
“I wasn’t a child so much as I was just new to the universe. Very new.” Cas’s chimes are weary now, sad in a distant sort of way like mourning yourself, mourning the things that other people did to you. But there’s no going back, and maybe that’s the tragic part. You can mourn yourself for as long as you like, but that child, that new being, is on a path towards destruction that only you now have the exact roadmap for. A four-year-old not knowing his mom would die. A little moon not knowing it’d be outcasted by its family.
“It has nothing to do with the hard work or practice of the players,” Eileen agrees. “If we weren’t here, Sam would probably forget how to throw a frisbee.”
Something upset flashes across Dean’s face, through one of the holes in his shell, but it’s gone in the next second. “I’m Dean Winchester, he’s Sam Winchester. We’re brothers. We met you when you were still an angel and you pulled me out of Hell.”
And then she’s off again, and she does something that should not be legal in the nonexistent rulebook of Hands, but Dean knows if he tried to argue it, Charlie would outsmart him with a defending argument that’s probably right anyway. Which is really uncool considering it’s technically Dean’s game. But that doesn’t change the fact that he doesn’t know whether she just hit him with a half-pump or a full squeeze in the middle of her rests and holds. Somehow, he predicts a beer run in his future.
It hits Dean in the chest where it stops his heart with the sweetest of twists. Little strings being played on a violin the size of his aorta in a drizzling performance. Cas is- Cas is warm. A solid weight for Dean to push against in resistance so perfect that they could balance in the middle if they wanted to. With stubble that tickles against Dean’s shaved face.
So maybe Dean could have handled that situation better. Maybe Dean fucked up a little bit. He still has Charlie. Dean squeezes her arm gently in his. They continue the market walk together in defiance of the prying eyes.
“Uh- well, it- uh- sorta? Yeah. I mean, it’s like the swan parts of my brain reacting to how I actually feel about you. So… I guess that means I think about you as my mate, since… yeah.” Dean juts his chin forwards and scratches it anxiously. “I hope that’s not too freaky.”
“You watching porn without me?” Dean asks with his most charming smile and leans a little closer over the table.
“Very, very close,” he confirms again. He leans in to look at Dean’s hardness even nearer, rests his stubbled cheek on Dean’s thigh, drags it across the skin in the scratchy way that he knows Dean likes.
Dean watches as if he’s hanging onto every word that Castiel is saying. His lips are parted unconsciously, just the slightest bit where they are so plush and pink and-
“We’ll just tell them we’re in here making out,” he grunts, dragging his chair so it’s directly across from hers.
His words inspire a low-pitched hum in the back of Dean’s throat. From the corner of his eye, Castiel sees Dean’s cock move between his thighs. That pleases Castiel endlessly at the same time that it irons away the last of his doubts, his worries that Dean won’t enjoy this.
Because Dean had come back to the honey stall. He had asked for Cas specifically to thank him for his honey recommendation. And then, miraculously, he had seemed to understand Castiel in a way that no one else ever had, like it was the easiest thing Dean had ever done. So natural that it became thoughtless. He’d looked so lovely, so at peace in the early gray morning with no one watching him, as he’d told Castiel all about how the Acacia varietal was his favorite.
As per Sam’s suggestion, Dean stays standing a few feet away. “You sure you’re good? I know this is probably freaky as fuck, us knowing you and you not knowing us. But, uh, it’s temporary.”
"What are you doing here?" the omega asked, noticing too late that it sounded quite rude. Well, no brother here now to stop him from saying stuff that made the alpha go. Which he apparently didn't.
“Pretty exciting, huh,” he said, sounding a little bit desperate, as if he wanted the other to look between the lines, so he wouldn’t have to speak out loud what was hidden underneath the words. Dean did that too often himself to not recognize it.
After having fled the scene in the bunker, Sam, Cas, Dean, and the little Skylar make their ways whole Winchester style: In the Impala and down the highway. With the night being over, new plans have to be made as well as supplies have to be organized.
Dean didn’t want to admit it, but she was actually right. He hadn’t expected to care this much for the little bean already, but he did. Wait, correct that, the baby was already bigger than a bean, he reminded himself.
At that, Dean had to swallow. He suddenly noticed the fries in front of him and started to chew on one. “Never?” he asked disbelievingly.
"Let them go," Dean just replied as if it wasn't his side that was completely outnumbered. Fake self-confidence was what had brought him to where he was now.
“You probably cannot imagine how much I would like to do this because of the right reasons, but when is it ever easy.” He grinned at her questioning face, but she didn’t seem disgusted. Good.
"Nothing's wrong, Sammy," Dean replied and tried to figure out how to tell him. He actually hadn't allowed himself to think about anything else on his drive home and the ten minutes he had paced in his apartment.
When Dean was allowed to go home after another week, he was at same parts euphorically and dreadful. It had been so easy to talk to Cas in the hospital, no way they could give in to their desire to touch each other. Save ground so to say.
“Mary Ellen Winchester and William Bobby Winchester,” Dean grinned at his wife, sitting on her hospital bed and holding a piece of paper and a pen in his hands. Outside of the window, the sun was shining and both of them couldn’t wait to go out and show their children the world.
"Uh, dunno, I mean, I didn't have time to ask him about it, but he's kind of in this famous family business, so it's probably Milton, I suppose," Dean heard himself brabble as he watched the other's expression change from confusion to horror.
"What if I had eight vessels full of Heaven's water, the drug, Zachariah's people promoted so persistent but never sold. What if the reason it never went viral was that my dad stole it from them."
There was a silence after that. Both men were so much engaged in each other’s eyes, that they didn’t even notice the waitress delivering their food. He somehow had expected that, Dean’s mind supplied helpfully.
“Dean,” Sam replied but not replied. When the older Winchester turned around to him, he could see the full on bitchface his brother was already sporting. “I already told you all about it in the car. On our way here. Did you listen to any of that?”
Dean just turned around and ran. He didn’t know how the angel could command so many of the underworld’s children, but it didn’t seem relevant for their escape right now.
“After a few months, we found out that she was pregnant and told our parents immediately. They were quite happy, but it apparently wasn’t, what my wife had expected. She never talked to me again afterwards.”
So, when they finally went to the register office to marry, Dean had had a big bump on his forehead and the lack of kissing irritated even the bored guy that took their ‘I will’s. Nonetheless, they both had the feeling that this was somehow right, and they weren’t missing much in their new life plan.
“Yes, let’s go and set up the table, dinner is probably ready any time,” the younger Winchester said after a moment of silence, in which he had probably regarded his brother.
They had talked a little more with Crowley and the other higher positioned angels and the shorter man cut Dean free of all the debts his father had ever caused. They destroyed the drugs, a last order of the actual leader, and then left as fast as they could. There was a quiet life waiting for them, and Dean was actually excited to embrace it.
Everything he said made Dean think the alpha was too good, too pure for him and take his stuff and run as far away as possible.
Cas face lit up immediately like it had done yesterday and Dean thought of the sun coming up. “Congratulations,” he said. “It will be great to have more little kids in this area.”
Glynn, the crazy but good-looking alien girl the older Winchester had met in a bar during the hunt and who knew the drummer of Queen.
The hunter was standing now and cleaning his hands on his pants as he saw, that a decision was being made, written right across the angel’s face.
“I know, that you don’t want to believe, that sometimes something good happens to us,” Dean said as he turned the corner to the Cas’ bedroom, where they put his body after preserving it from decay. “But even if you are right, we can face it sometimes else. Let’s just take a break for once. Read a non-research book, catch up with all those TV-shows and movies.”
His arms were getting tired from holding the one on top of him away, their faces now inches from one another. The hunter managed to kick his leg out again but only hit a shin of someone who growled an then kicked back with a lot more force.
“We are very lucky to have her.” The angel’s voice carried so much love in it that Dean couldn't have looked away from his gaze if he wanted to. It was so nice and warm in this room, and the hunter was really tired, which was why he was honestly contemplating putting his hand on the angel’s next to Sky’s tiny frame.
The woman entered the house, and the older Winchester saw a glimpse of his hopefully-soon-lover in the darkness of the entrance hall. He sighed and turned around. He would have loved to support Cas during this talk, but that would only make things more complicated.
The two brothers almost made it to the room spoken of when they heard the scream of a woman down a corridor to their right. They fell into a run automatically. Their movements would have almost been beautifully synchrony if there wasn’t somebody in immediate danger.
The next morning Dean woke up with a feeling of excitement in his stomach. He tried to remember, where it came from until a set of blue eyes flickered across his mind. Castiel. Right.
He would have driven but Sam offered to go for a few more hours and to be honest, the older hunter wasn’t sure if he would be able to concentrate on the road right now. The last twelve hours had probably been the most emotionally draining of his life. He smiled a little, tired smile at the angel entering behind him, who returned it even sleepier. Ah yes how could Dean have forgotten that he had held up a ceiling for them.
After Cas got in and closed the door, Dean tried to ease the tension a little bit by saying: “Hey, Cas, you nervous?” Of course, Cas reacted differently than Dean thought and instead of shrugging and denying it, he let out a silent chuckle.
“Spit it out,” Dean mocked in his good mood, turning around with the spatula in one hand, beer in the other, opening his arms wide.
“I’m not young anymore, and I don’t want to wait anymore.” Jo hesitated for a moment as if she hadn’t ever said the following out loud.
The blue-eyed alpha, who had followed his movements, apparently with great interest seemed to take a deep breath.
For a second it was silent while Dean stared at the others determined to make them accept his words. “And if I don’t come back in ten minutes, lock the doors.”
The three hunters (and hunters in training) gathered in a corner to discuss, what they thought about the story.
"There is only one way to find out," the younger Winchester answered visibly constraining his anger and fished something out of his jacket pocket. It was a very crumpled exemplar of 'Busty Asian Beauties'.
"Hi, Dean," the addressed answered and Dean was confused for a second at the missing question about what was wrong.
The guy asserted to just have wandered around at night, because of course he couldn’t sleep with all that was going on without people knowing and he had passed a church and there he stood. Or she, he stammered, it had been too dark.
The real life, physical Cas, Dean had missed for the last months, woke up with a startled intake of breath.
The other thought that kept him from calling his brother was that Sam was a beta and probably knew just as much about this kind of stuff as Dean did. No, he had to deal with it alone, in his own way.
“Dean,” Cas whispered from the backseat to not wake a very asleep Sam in the front. “I know you hate this, but don’t you think we should talk about this?”
Dean wanted to run over and punch the older man in the face for touching his mate, but Benny held him back.
And it was not as if he wasn’t in control. He yelled “Sammy!” a few times to make sure the witch thought he was in panic and then rounded the corner, just in time to see Mr. Witch complete a spell for his tied up younger brother. Of course, he shot him with witch-killing bullets immediately. And of course, the witch turned to him and fired the spell in his direction instead of in Sam’s. At least, that was a win.
"Um, yeah, alright. Dean, move as you please," he said, and the alpha voice brought shivers down the addressed's spine. Dean felt himself loosen up and dropped back down on the bench next to Cas.
After they passed the border to Kansas, Dean remembered for a split second, that they didn’t really clean up the church and what the priest might think, if there were two sets of wings burned into his changing room. “Sakristy,” a voice said and the hunter chuckled.
He tried his best to fake a smile but probably failed miserably. Even Jess was now looking at them with pity in her eyes. Dean wanted to comfort his neighbor, that somehow also had become his friend, but he really needed some air right now. He stood up and walked wordlessly through their open back door.
“Not necessarily,” Cas answered and his arm brushed Dean’s as he shifted, what made the hunter impossible aware of this particular body part. “Heaven is very unorganized these days. I don’t even think there are a lot of angels left, but those who are, don’t have a strong connection to each other.”
After Cas had taken his daughter, Dean continued by introducing his family. “So, the giant here is Sam, my little brother and this is his almost-wife Jess. And back there on the couch is my very pregnant Jo, who apparently can’t stand up anymore.”
“I saw some black-eyed bastards,” Dean continued as none of them spoke and licked his lips, “and an angel of the Lord told me in my head, that he wants to use our daughter as a weapon.” At this Cas frowned so deeply, that the older hunter would have almost laughed if they weren’t in such a bad situation.
Dean nodded for his daughter and unwrapped her from her cocoon of warmth, at what she protested loudly.
"He can't do that, can he?" Crowley asked from Dean's left as soon as most of the angels were occupied with the contract being signed. "I mean, he can alpha control you, but I'm still the leader." Dean sighed. He had had enough of Crowley's drama a long time ago, but he also hated that Zachariah was right.
“All right,” the younger Winchester voiced and then turned solely to Cas, what didn’t really mean anything because the older hunter and the angel were standing so close to each other. “Can you erase his memory of us? We can’t get to the angel he is in contact with if he doesn’t think he is safe.”
"I want out," Dean said as soon as he sat down opposite to Crowley at the other's large business desk.
“Agent May and Taylor,” Sam said after he had opened the right door and Dean looked at him funny as he passed by him into the room. “We are sorry for the interruption, but we need to ask a few questions to Michael Foster.” He read the name from the notebook in his hands.
"Excuse me, what?" the beta split out, trying to keep his posture in sight of irritation. It was funny to watch how he just stared at his second as if the other was about to break his heart. Weird guy.
There’s a tag sticking out over the collar of the soft cotton, and it’s an easy distraction from Sam’s droning voice. Dean stares at it for a second before reaching over and tucking it back into its rightful spot, his fingertips brushing the back of Cas’s neck in the process.
Dean rolls his eyes even though the corners of his lips are pulling upwards. “That’s pretty much all I ever call you, buddy. I’ve known you for a decade and I could count on my fingers and toes how many times I’ve called you Castiel.”
“If you don’t want that, then we don’t have to. We can, ya know, keep it under wraps, I get it. But I just feel like- it’s gonna happen eventually, won’t it?” Dean’s eyebrows pull up almost helplessly, hopelessly. “Neither of us are stupid, or blind. We can keep doing this as a secret, but what happens if it comes out? What happens if we try to hold hands one day and someone sees? I want it to be on our terms. I want- For once, I want to be selfish. Fuck all those people, Cas. I don’t care about all the goddamn people who see me as a- a living sex doll, I want to be able to kiss you. So- so I understand if you don’t wanna be dragged into this, but-”
Their eyes lock, hold, this suspended and unshakeable moment that lasts only a second but feels like a lifetime, before Castiel tears his gaze away to look at Eileen’s smiling face instead. And, oh, Castiel had been so captivated by Dean that it’s only now as he focuses on Eileen that he realizes they’re wearing matching face paint. Both of them have one white streak on their left cheeks and one red streak on their right, an inch or so below their eyes. Together, they look like two giddy children. That inescapable fondness that Castiel feels when he sees Dean like this, so seemingly himself, rears its head again.
“Yeah, alright, I got it,” Dean rolls his eyes. “This one’s on me and my fragile humanity. Either way, let’s cram this cat back into the bag, huh?” He rubs his hands together.
With an outstretched arm, he brushes his finger through the feathers of Dean’s left wing. They leave behind iridescent sap in the shape of his hand, clear and dripping in the spots he’s come into contact with.
Castiel holds him in place as he presses their lips together. It’s dry and warm, both of their mouths closed to it, and it is all Castiel could ever ask for. Dean takes a sharp breath in through his nose and goes to move, but Castiel stops him by pulling away. Just two inches. He presses in again. Their lips are flat planes against each other, a stamp against heavy paper.
“It’s more than good, Dean.” A pause, then more hesitantly, “I don’t think I have ever felt so treasured in my millennia of living.”
“Okay, I’m leaving now.” Dean finally wanders off into the crowd, only letting his grin grow when he knows Cas and Charlie can’t see him anymore.
, he misses Jack. The kid was nothing but trouble, and yet, he was still his kid. He never thought he’d get any of this, a chance at being a dad, not even in the unexpected way that it all happened. The son of Lucifer. Go figure. He thinks about the day when Cas brought Jack back to them, how good it had been to see his boy’s face again. His chest feels so tight, and it’s odd to think that those little moments are over. He’s been told that it’s never easy when your kid flies the coop, but no one told him how to handle his son becoming the literal God.
“For who?” Cas says it so sternly that Dean’s eyes startle open at the tone, only to find Cas looking through him again. “From what I understand, there has to be an entity of judgment for there to be the result of embarrassment. And the last thing I’m doing right now is judging you.”
Another moment of silence. “Is there… anything I can do?” Cas asks. He’s so good. He’s too good to Dean, when Dean is being such a little bitch even though Cas is just trying to help.
Dean scowls, so Castiel must have done something wrong. The idea of making Dean mad sits somewhere like panic, like fear. “I meant,” Castiel fumbles, looks at the side of the shining car like a beetle under the sun, “hello, Baby.”
, so Dean tugs down on his hips until Cas’s full weight falls on him. They’re touching all over now, with their hard-ons pinned between them, and Dean is alight with it. He couldn’t even hold in his pleased noise if he tried. It still doesn’t feel like enough, but it’s more than he could have ever hoped for.
When Castiel looks to his right in the directions of the voices, his stomach lurches when his eyes land on-
Dean opens his mouth almost preemptively to argue with whatever he thought Charlie was going to say, but when he hears her words he closes it again, eyebrows furrowing. Then he turns to look at Castiel as well.
Charlie sniffles and wipes her nose on her long-sleeve top. “I got bored,” she says with congestion obvious in her voice. She’s even paler now than Castiel can recall her looking from the few times he’s seen her, with pronounced dark circles under her eyes.
His thrusts start off slow, for both his and Dean’s sake. They build to a loving pace, the rhythm of a tap dripping water into the basin of a sink.
It’s already all over his chest, but Cas is still fucking into him, and Dean feels like a ragdoll choking on his own tongue.
“Going like candy,” Mr. Davis says. He grins with slightly yellowed teeth, his scraggly eyebrows jumping to his forehead. “Have any interest in one?”
Or maybe he does. Maybe whatever he is can see right through Dean and all of the things he pretends to be.
He grazes it down the side of her face, down her cheek and across her jawline, around the whole perimeter of her face. When he gets back to his starting point on her forehead, he stops again.
“Then I suppose,” Castiel brings his voice back down to a hum, “that I’ll have to see to the Linden apiary in a few hours.”
It takes Dean and Cas walking a few feet closer to the enthralled couple for Sam to look up at the sound of their footsteps. Whatever he sees makes him gawk. Dean wonders if it’s their wild hair, the hickeys on Dean’s neck, or the fact that Cas is wearing Dean’s clothes. Probably all of the above.
They pass through the door one after the other with Castiel in the back. The air is cooler quite suddenly in a way that takes the sting off of the glaring sun outside that is only now starting to ebb with the evening.
and take the rest of the day to collect himself off of the ground. He itches with too many emotions all at once that are bright and shining. There are soft things in his chest that have nowhere to go.
This time, he pushes two fingers in, and they enter just as readily as one had. Ten more thrusts. He can already add a third. It hasn’t been long since they did this last, anyway, just the other night. Dean is so relaxed. Another minute, and then Castiel’s pulling his fingers out carefully.
, and closes the distance between them until he has both hands balled in Cas’s dress shirt, resting back onto his heels. Even like this, Cas still has a good half-foot on him, and Dean has to look up to meet his eyes. And he looks up, and he sees heaven in the tenderness of Cas’s expression.
Dean walks past the confused angel to shut the still open bedroom door to buy himself more time, but it’s not much, and then he’s face to face with Cas again.
The confirmation is overwhelming, overbearing, the ageless vastness of Castiel. Until Dean doesn’t know how to handle the fact that a being that held stars in its hands is also Dean’s best friend who Dean has made ride in the backseat of the Impala. A being that’s currently riding in Dean.
But Cas just makes a low, happy noise, and somehow manages to press even closer until Dean’s chest and stomach are lined up against Cas’s side. It’s like Cas’s contentedness is seeping out of him and into Dean, because he finds himself settling deeper into the memory foam as he continues.
The sound of dry dirt under shoes ebbs and flows like ocean waves as people make their way home or to the slowly filling bars for the night. A rhythm of these footfalls draws closer and closer, and Castiel waits to watch the pedestrian walk past.
A hush falls across the kitchen. This was a mistake, Castiel thinks, and yet such a weight has been lifted from him with the admittance.
Cas still looks decidedly chastised, but less embarrassed. Sam sighs and then shoots Dean a look that says
Castiel startles to a halt. Floating in the lazily moving stream in front of him, about ten feet in, is a swan. Castiel closes his eyes. Opens them again.
So Dean enjoys his solo time under the water until it turns relaxing and steamy, at which point he grabs Cas’s arm and pulls him in. They wash each other gently, taking their time touching each other’s wet skin, shampooing each other’s hair like a couple of saps before they towel off and stumble (in Dean’s case, limp a little) back to Cas’s bedroom where Dean pulls on his old boxers and Cas gets a new, clean pair out of his drawer.
But Castiel takes pity and eases the fly of Dean’s jeans down. He looks even more delectable through the flimsy material of his boxers, and Castiel drags his knuckles down the area tentatively. Dean shakes like he’s crumbling apart, his stuttering breath puffing hot against Castiel’s cheek.
black mare named Baby. And, God, can she travel, handles so smooth if you closed your eyes you’d almost think you were on a train. I like my thrills, I just prefer them to not be from ten stories up.”
“Yes,” Dean cackles in glee. “And Eileen never let it slip! Not ever! That’s one of the reasons she’s my favorite.”
It starts tearing Castiel apart between its fingernails. It stretches the light into unnatural taffy strands that burn hot enough that Dean feels the singe of his eyebrows. There’s vomit in his mouth. And the shrieking. Cas is- Cas is shrieking, being torn apart by the molecule. Louder until it is a ringing that deafens Dean to anything else. It’s the sound of torture, the sound of Castiel being maimed alive.
“Always a pleasure, Sam Winchester. My address is still the same if you ever see a gift basket at the market that you think I’d enjoy.”
Castiel shakes his head incredulously. “You are insatiable, do you know that? Only Dean Winchester. I’d assume most people would have fallen asleep by now, but not the Righteous Man, not the most stubborn being on planet Earth.”
So the man crouching in front of Castiel is named Dean. He wonders if that’s supposed to mean something to him.
Again, the brief piano intro starts, but Taylor wastes no time and begins singing. It’s a beautiful song, really. But that’s Taylor for you. Most of her songs are.
Before he can get a clear image, Cas’s gravel voice floats towards the bed almost as disembodied as the orb was. “Dean, you- you just-”
“Don't you understand?” Castiel snarls. He fists Dean’s shirt and shakes the man bodily with all that anger, all of that hurt. “This is what I had. This is what I had.” Those messy tears are across his face now, sliding in all directions until his cheeks are flooded by shallow water. “This is all that I had.”
They end up in the Dean Cave after Cas changes into some of Dean’s old, worn clothes. Cas is sitting on the couch while Dean lays across it with his head in Cas’s lap. Tombstone plays in the background with the volume turned almost all the way down.
He wipes the slickness that’s left over on his erection, getting more from the bottle and lubing himself up fully before cleaning his fingers on Dean’s comforter and throwing the bottle to the floor. Then, Castiel moves back up the length of Dean’s body until he overlaps him, lining himself up to Dean’s hole with one hand, the other holding his weight next to Dean’s head. “May I?”
“I meant everything that I said to you, Dean, before the Empty took me. Do not- Do not think so lowly of yourself. You are loving and inherently worthy of love.”
“Not too shabby at all,” Dean lies through his teeth. Before Mr. Davis can say anything else, Dean continues firmly, “Listen, is there any way that I could ask you a favor?”
The sensation moves with his hands, a trapped constellation in the area of each finger pad that burns on and on. Upwards, to the hinge where Dean’s femur meets its socket, and then in, closer, closer to trimmed wiry hair.
Castiel cannot look away from those green eyes as he feels something hot in his throat. It burns uncomfortably even when he swallows. His eyes are warm, too, with some sort of itchy dampness. His face creases in confusion.
When Dean looks up again, Cas is smiling. “Yes, she’s very beautiful,” he says, like he’s glad that Dean agrees. “She is one of my favorites.”
Before Dean can explain that that’s really not what he meant at all, Cas is standing back up and shedding his pants and underwear. If there’s one thing that can be said for Dean, it’s that he never looks a gift horse in the mouth. Cas may have completely misunderstood what Dean was trying to get at, but at least he’s naked.
“Ahh,” Castiel says calmly. “Yes, I understand. I feel that way about some of her songs that you play in the Bunker. It can be easy to get overwhelmed by it.” His lips pinch. “Maybe it would help if I listened to it with you?”
Cas purses his lips, but scoots all of his gloriously shirtless body onto the bed, maneuvering himself so that the crown of his skull is just pressed into Dean’s crotch.
And suddenly, whatever is still left of the tension between them eases. Castiel can’t resist leaning in for a warm kiss. It lingers in its stillness where they breathe down each other’s cheeks before they finally part.
Dean’s hands tighten around the ends of the armrests of the chair. “You might have to try again. I don’t think I got it the first time.” His voice is weak despite the bravado of the words.
“I have to-” Sam sputters, “I gotta get a cake! Pie! Whatever! If we hadn’t already killed God, this may have been one of the best days of my life.”
Dean is raw all over. Exposed like a live wire and lit up like a Christmas tree under the look Cas’s giving him now. Like maybe Castiel understands or gives a shit.
Castiel uses the hand on Dean’s shoulder to turn him around, and he moves willingly with the pressure. Still, Dean’s head is hung towards the ground like he doesn’t know how to meet Cas’s eyes.
“Mornin’, Cas,” he replies, maybe softer than he intended to. Not like there’s anyone here to call him on it anyway. “Just getting ready to shave.” He raises his messy hands as if in proof.
That makes Dean laugh out loud, and something about the farmer reminds him a little bit of Bobby. “Absolutely, sir, I appreciate the offer. If all goes according to plan, we’ll be out of your hair before sunrise.”
Venturing deeper almost unconsciously, Dean spans the distance to the opposite side of the stall where the serving window looks out onto part of the market. The stall itself is lifted a foot and a half off of the ground, so that whenever Dean was on the other side of this window, he had to look up at Cas’s face.
He can’t find the words to respond, as he leans all of his weight back against Dean and raises his hips to free the fabric as he pushes it down his thighs with trembling hands. Once they’re past his knees, he kicks out of them until they’re nothing more than a gray pile at the foot of the bed.
like it.” Castiel doesn’t know how to respond to that either, but Dean takes his silence as confirmation. “So, what, do you jerk off while I’m out?”
With fingers surer than they feel, Castiel rolls the tight fabric of his own dirty boxers down his legs to the ground where he steps out of them. It is very strange to be naked so plainly in front of someone else. And Castiel supposes he shouldn’t be all that embarrassed about staring because Dean is staring right back.
Dean sits upright, startled, and snaps his head to see Cas standing at the end of his bed, looking concerned through a furrowed brow. When he sees Dean’s blotchy face, his eyes widen. He moves to get closer, arms outstretched before his hands settle on Dean’s shoulders.
“Yes. Yes, Dean. You’re-” The hand on Dean’s chest twitches under his own. “I wish I could make you understand half of what I see when I look at you. How good you are.”
The only sound in the kitchen is the spitting whine of the coffee machine while they stare at each other.
“Well- uh, I’m not exactly opposed. Or opposed at all, um, really. That sounds… anyway. I don’t know how easy it’ll be. You already know what a light sleeper I am, no way you stick your dick up my ass and I just don’t wake up.” His head tilts as if in thought. “And in that case, you could probably just use your Angelic Anesthesia on me, but then I would be out for the whole thing. And if we’re doing this, I wanna be able to feel it.”
He looks to Dean’s face and almost startles at the fact that Dean is watching him back. For a long moment, they look at each other in the quiet and the weight of their gaze holds an understanding.
When Dean falls asleep with his sheets twisted up between his legs at the end of this Wednesday that didn’t hurt as much as he thought it was going to, he dreams about Castiel.
“And, uh, sometimes you like the idea of something more than you actually wanna do it.” Dean squirms around as if he’s slightly embarrassed to be talking about this at all, but his voice stays thoughtful. “Sometimes things are just fantasies for fun and it’s not any deeper than that. You know, something to think about in the shower but that you wouldn’t really want to act on. That’s okay, too.”
Dean swallows again. “Every day.” And it’s so stupidly cliche and obvious, but maybe cliches are overused for a reason, and maybe the reason is that they’re true. Because if it’s not the memories of her, it’s the hole she left, and if it’s not the hole she left, it’s the way that Dean had to fill it.
“I can give you a tour of the place while Dean makes dinner,” Sam says from behind Castiel’s back. “It’ll be cool to see your reaction to everything.”
Her words hang warm in the kitchen air, well past the end of the conversation. They eat together with the idea of butterflies becoming a cocoon in its own right. The burgers are good. The cocktails are better, and Eileen keeps them coming until Dean feels fluid and loose.
“I know that it doesn’t fix everything… or maybe anything, but I’m here now. And I don’t plan on leaving.”
Charlie’s arm is a warm tether where it’s wrapped around Dean’s, their elbows locked as they meander the steadily darkening marketplace. The breeze pushes Charlie’s hair around and every once in a while the long strands whip out against his neck and cheek. It tickles a little bit.
“Most call me her majesty,” she grins and holds out a hand that Castiel shakes, “but you can call me Charlie on the account that you think I’m dashing.”
“Cas? Like, Casper The Friendly Ghost?” Dean internally cracks himself up with that shit. He’s yet to meet a friendly ghost.
.” There isn’t a part of Dean that isn’t singing. It pitches up higher when Cas’s hand squeezes his dick. “Oooohhh!”
The closest he ever gets to that disappearance is Cas’s stream on the days that Cas eats his lunch there.
He hears more than sees Cas shuffling through the pages as if marking his spot, before closing the book and setting it down on the desk, like he wants to give Dean all of his attention. That twists a knot in Dean’s chest that walks a thin line between nervous and elated.
With a final nip at Dean’s neck, Cas pulls away, forcing Dean out of his hiding place so that he can look Dean in the eyes. His hips haven’t stopped moving, though, and a particularly hard thrust with unnatural strength sends Dean spiraling. His whole body tenses, his sweaty hands clutching desperately for purchase on Cas’s back. “Oh, f-fuck.”
“I couldn’t help but notice you have your apples out in these wood crates. You happen to have one in the back that you could lend me for a minute?”
He wasn’t expecting Cas to show up because today is not a Monday or a Friday. Or maybe he was expecting Cas to show up on this Wednesday even though Cas never has before. Maybe he knew all along that Cas would come, and that’s why he ended up here. Maybe Mom sent him. Dean would believe that.
Cas’s harsh panting blows warm onto Dean’s face as his grip on Dean finally loosens. His whole body seems to loosen too, because he sags down further so that his head is resting on Dean’s shoulder. The change in position sets Dean’s previously trapped arms free, and he holds Cas tight with them, carding the fingers of his right hand through Cas’s dark hair.
“Castiel,” he repeats, trying to mimic the calming cadence of A.L.B.’s voice. It’s smoother and slower in its quietness, the gravel usually lodged there all but gone, leaving behind the weathered soft wet sand of the beach. “Angel of Jack. Angel who loves so big that the world had to bend around you to compensate. I’m sure you noticed, but Eileen’s sign for your name is Lover. I liked that a lot when I figured it out, ‘cause that’s what you are, Cas. And you love me, too, you weirdo.”
Cas carefully holds the now much more depleted bowl of water as he stands, sets it down on the nearby end table of the couch, before he reaches out his hand to help Dean stand as well. He doesn’t let go even when Dean’s up, instead using their joined hands to guide Dean down a short hallway that dead ends to a set of stairs. Up those, into another short hallway that breaks into three rooms. Cas leads Dean through one of the doorways to the right, and there’s Cas’s bed.
“Cas,” comes desperate and wrecked off of his lips, and he doesn’t even have time to blink before Cas is hovering above him again, bringing them face to face. He looks down at Dean fearfully, as his eyes dart back and forth between Dean’s.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Cas replies thoughtfully. Some of his yellow, his brightness, has returned.
“Mmm,” Dean hums, his voice rough and warmer for it. That makes Castiel even harder. It makes him hungry, a certain sort of sedated need to consume. He wants to grind against the soft skin stretched over Dean’s hipbone and come up his side, let it drip and cause a mess in their bed. See the way his semen marks Dean’s skin and know Dean is happy to see it there, too. “Morning,” Dean adds, cutting through Castiel’s fantasy.
The way that Dean had held his chin, the way he had leaned closer. Castiel closes his eyes as he swallows around swollen, tender emotions. He cannot remember a single ache that has cherished this much. Because it is unbelievable at the same time that Castiel could never have made this up on his own, could never have predicted the softness of coming together in the middle across two wooden stools. Lovely Dean had kissed him. And somehow, knowing that it will happen again does not make that kiss any less special. Any more fathomable in its transference from fantasy to reality.
, he prays just to hear the name in his head. Most of the time, he doesn’t pray about anything. Just Cas’s name. Maybe, if he prays loud and hard enough, all of the angels will hear him, and none of them will ever be able to forget Castiel’s legacy. They shouldn’t be allowed to.
And Dean really should learn to never underestimate this woman because she just shrugs her shoulders and says, “I had a good time.”
Ugh. Charlie and her stupid ability to pull at his heartstrings and to rationalize situations. Because as much as Dean hates to admit it with the way his stomach is churning, Charlie has a point. If Dean doesn’t do this now, then when will he? In months, in years, of hiding his and Cas’s relationship? Of being even more paranoid than he already is at every turn that someone will see something they shouldn’t, or even just get the wrong sorts of ideas?
it. It’s like Cas’s newly blooming hickeys on his neck, but so much more. Every cell in his body recreated and mended by Cas’s gentle hands. A mark so much deeper than a handprint on his shoulder, until no one can see it besides maybe Castiel himself.
The visage of Dean’s erection, more of the suggestion of an erection that turns to understanding that arouses Castiel endlessly, leaks messily. It is that shining iridescent liquid that drips from the tip down the length of it.
“Basically it’s when something you’re drawing is coming at you. So,” Dean points his finger towards her so she’s looking down the line of it, “when I hold my finger like this, you only see the tip of it, but you know,” he points his finger towards the fire so that it’s to Finley lengthwise, “that there’s more to it, right?”
“And lucky for everyone, they’re pretty easy to make. Let me tell you, Cas, Castiel.” The use of Cas’s full name earns Dean a small shiver. He grins. “Castiel,” Dean puts emphasis on the
Of course, there is no actual response to his question as he passes his hand across the silk hair that lays smooth down her neck. He pats it once, twice. “I’m coming up.” Dean doesn’t even have to put thought into the easy movement that he’s performed a hundred times over as he mounts Baby’s saddle. She shifts gently under him.
There’s a knock on the bathroom door that cuts Dean’s singing off short even if Taylor continues on without him.
The word echoes through the barren store, off of its linoleum floors and too-high ceilings, until it becomes hollow in radio. The hair on Dean’s arms stands on end. He blinks down at the treacle pie. It feels like everything is moving in slow motion where his eyelashes catch on dust particles and the closing of his eyes lasts almost a full second before they open again. Slowly, he looks towards the ceiling where the PA speaker is.
“I used it the right way in that sentence and that’s what matters. It also doesn’t change the fact that I’m right.”
Castiel carefully straightens them on the counter and tries (fails) not to think about how close his hand is to Dean’s where it now rests flat and to the side.
“Say no more, little brother,” Dean cuts Sam off with a sleazy grin and a clap on the arm. “I got it taken care of.”
But Cas’s voice is soothing from above him. Dean can’t make out what he’s saying, thinks that some of it’s in English and some is in Enochian. It’s as warm and familiar as the rumble of Baby’s engine, and Dean floats on top of it while he tries to catch his breath. Tremors are still working through his body, but Cas’s fingers trace them and work them away, rubbing at the muscles of his neck and arms, over his chest, and down to his waist.
Because Dean remembers how he likes his eggs because Dean cares about him. And even though Castiel has his memories back, it still feels significant. “Yes,” Castiel says distantly, “that sounds good.”
Castiel is being split in twain. Home is a word that means as much to him as a word like friendship: something made for other people. He is solemn, he knows, in a way that most don’t enjoy. Even when he was in heaven, his brothers and sisters left him to be by himself. Castiel always felt too big, always thought too small, and Heaven was home the same way that scientists decide which hunks of rock are planets and which ones are moons. Heaven was home the way someone blindfolded throws a dart at a bullseye.
Dean stares at him, and when the silence between them stretches too long, he says suspiciously, “Should it bother me?”
Charlie jabs him with the elbow already pressed up against his side between their bodies. Still, she tilts her head and stretches her neck upwards, offering her cheek to Dean in a silent request that he grants by leaving a softer kiss there as well.
“I’m incredibly aroused watching you. I’m so hard, Dean. I can’t explain it, but your eyes… they are exposed like this. They are glossy and unfocused, but I know you can hear my voice. You are absorbing everything I say and you are helpless to do anything but let me touch you, let me speak to you lovingly.” He moans softly to himself, “
“Like that, baby,” Dean encourages, breathless, caught in awe of the heavens unraveling right here inches in front of him. He bears down against Cas and rushes, “Let it go, let it go, let it go.”
But then, it almost looks like Dean is hiding a smile with his chin tucked to his chest. It is so bizarre and fitting on Dean’s soft features, calloused attitude, and it makes Castiel curious and itchy to the point of insanity. Being human is so full of half-satisfied wants. He wants to hold Dean, freeze him right there so that Castiel can stoop down below him and look up at his secret smile that the man is trying to hide until it is not a secret anymore.
It’s the way Cas says it, the way he looks at Dean with mirth shining in those blue eyes without pity, like they both know exactly how fucked up this whole situation is, that sets Dean off. He howls with laughter, almost doubling over with the force of it. It’s like a release that Cas has set off and Dean’s a leaky hose that’s suddenly gushing water. All of the tension and the built-up emotions shed themselves as he laughs until tears form in his eyes. Cas watches with warm affection and pride, pleased with his own successful attempt at humor.
Maybe-… But Dean wants. And maybe it could be okay. Cas is so much better than all of this, though, so much better than the flimsy rumors of this town. He’s carved in stone against every brittle, breaking insincerity. Until Dean knows that Cas wouldn’t buckle under the weight of it, but he isn’t so sure that Cas would even want to be placed under that weight in the first place.
“The point stands,” Castiel interjects, “that both Dean and Sam are experiencing an uptick in the pleasures of restorative emotional releases, that neither seems to be handling very well.”
“Cas, you dumb son of a bitch,” and words that are meant to come out teasing are breaking over crests instead. There are tears in Dean’s eyes that never really went away and there is a swollen lump in his throat. “
“You remind me so much of him,” Castiel says. His voice is reverent and heartbroken and Dean wonders how this- whatever Cas is- could be so many different things at once.
to do is tell me if you get goosebumps and what did it so that I can, uh-” Dean feels inexplicably embarrassed- “take notes.” He taps his temple with his pointer finger.
“I was able to get both myself and my vessel somewhere safe before I was expelled. I’ve already been this way for three days and nothing of interest has happened yet. I’m sure a few days longer won’t change anything-”
And Dean’s soul shifts this soft gold, almost cream, that only rears its head when Dean sleeps. Castiel thinks that perhaps the Pearly Gates are not even as magnificent.
Castiel makes up his mind. He wipes the remaining wetness from his eyes, his cheeks, and stands. Dean watches and doesn’t try to touch him. Instead, he blows out a breath like he’s relieved that Castiel is cooperating.
Now Castiel really does pet Dean’s cock. Up and over, from root to tip, a rhythm that leaves Dean’s erection to bounce back between each broad stroke until Castiel presses it down again. It slips silkily under Castiel's palm. From above him, a whining sort of noise slips from Dean’s lips.
Dean stares into Castiel’s empty expression. “Maybe I liked being here with you. You didn’t know who I was or what I was, and you talked to me more like a fucking person when I was that bird than most people in town do when I actually am a person. So, yeah, maybe I milked it. Maybe I stuck around even after I realized what you were doing because I wanted a little bit of fucking peace for myself. Somewhere that I didn’t have to be The Dean Winchester.”
But there are none of those things now as Cas almost seems to deflate a little bit as though he’s giving a big sigh of contentment. “It’s been a very long time since anyone has interacted with my grace like this.”
“You don’t need to answer out loud. I understand. Take as long as you need. That was, perhaps, more intense than we intended it to be. It may be a few minutes before you become accustomed to the movement of your muscles again. I’ll keep watching. Don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere. I’m just going to clean you off.”
Because this isn’t some fearful thing, a hair from danger. It’s the exact opposite. At this moment, Dean is defenseless by choice, and Castiel himself is the one who administered the medicine. That is the most important part. That is part of the trust.
Instead of following Dean’s prompting, Castiel moves to stand over him before settling down above him, straddling one of Dean’s thighs and propping his knee up on the edge of the bed to the side of Dean’s body to take some of his weight. Dean seems pleased either way.
“I’ll keep that in mind, Cas,” Dean says. With one final squeeze that turns Castiel’s insides into rabbit’s fur, Dean pulls away, too. “Now, it’s Breakfast for Dinner time.”
Cas pushes all the way into the bathroom, closing the door again behind him. When he scoots past Dean to get to the other side of the room, his hand presses briefly against Dean’s lower back as if in greeting. “You’re always interesting, Dean,” Cas says simply, and then closes the toilet lid to sit on top of it.
Dean huffs a single tired chuckle. “That’s what I thought. Can’t say that I get it, man, but you do you.”
It is just him and the lazy crickets. He doesn’t know if that makes it any easier to breathe. His brain is still fuzzy around the edges like it doesn’t want to snap all the way back to reality, like it’s still clinging to the false warmth of his dream.
There’s a pause, a hesitant beat before Cas chimes, “The sensation, I imagine, would be comparable to the way a cat feels when it’s being pet.”
With a deep breath, he sets the wooden box down on the ground with its closed, flat bottom facing upwards.
He’s been thinking about how he was gonna say this for the last three days, almost obsessively, but now it’s like the words leave him floundering.
It’s a whiplash from the confidence Cas had just a second ago, the confidence Cas had two nights ago when he was drilling Dean into the sheets and telling him he “shone like the brightest star in the night sky”.
He knows he has Sam, but it’s not the same. Sam won’t weirdly pity him or try to apologize for his loss, but Sam also doesn’t really… understand. Sam may have lost a mother, but he was too young to remember losing a mom. And so Dean bears it alone. Will keep bearing it alone.
“You don’t need to work for this feeling, do you understand? It comes naturally to you because it’s already within you. You don’t have to do anything to deserve it, because you deserve it inherently, Dean. This pleasure is easy. It comes to you and asks for nothing in return.”
No.” Now it’s Sam’s turn to look annoyed. “I mean, most swans do mate for life, but it’s more of a successful egg-laying thing than a romantic thing. Besides, we’re not actually swans. I mean, think of all the people you’ve slept with, and you’ve never gotten on one knee for any of them.” Dean glares, but Sam continues unperturbed. “The wing thing basically just means that you like the person enough for it to rub off on your weird swan mannerisms.”
Another set of strong arms wrap around him, a point of counterbalance to Dean’s embrace. There are intersections of limbs at certain points, like over the center of Castiel’s chest, and it reminds Castiel of a woven basket, the type he has seen humans picnic with. Sam curls up on himself to bend over Castiel until his temple rests against the back of Castiel’s neck, and Castiel can feel Sam’s damp breath puffing down between his shoulder blades.
If these people wanna waste their time following Dean around in circles while he buys groceries, then by all means. In most cases, none of them bother him anyway, some even trying to pretend that they aren’t following him in the first place, and he’ll take what he can get.
Cas looks up lazily, until his eyes land on Dean’s face and suddenly they go wide as he guiltily rips the earbuds out of his ears. It’s panic, and not even the bad kind, more like ‘I forgot to leave a sock on the door’ kind. And Dean’s always been a curious son of a bitch, even before he and Cas (well, mostly Cas) sacked up and got together. Now, that alarmed expression is as tempting as the apple to Eve, and sets all types of gears turning in Dean’s head.
So it’s Cas’s sweet blue eyes glazing over with wet tears as he looks at Dean with the most feeble sort of hope. Dean’s thumb rubs over Cas’s high cheekbone.
He knows exactly what he wants, but he can’t get his mouth to form the words. The shame in his gut swells up and he hates that he’s so pathetic, can’t just say the stupid fucking thing that in reality, Cas would never judge him for. Cas has specifically not judged him for a lot worse.
Castiel turns back around and tries to stop his heart from catching. He sets the jar down on the window counter in front of Dean. “This should be enough for you to make a practice cake as well.”
“We literally just humped each other like teenagers until we came in our pants. You can call it a dick. A dick you’re about to see, by the way.”
Eileen nods, quick and enthusiastic, “It’s awesome.” She curls her fingers in slightly and motions back and forth across her mouth.
Still, it’s familiar, too. Comforting. That light scent of it. Dean pauses his digging to raise his nose high into the air and take a deep lungful.
“Yeah, just like that, Cas,” Dean encourages him. Each thrust sends a twinge up his back, makes his spent dick ache, but even those feelings are welcome when he gets to keep Cas close like this. If Dean were ten years younger, he might even have been able to get hard again.
“So that’s how it is,” Dean exaggerates even as he grins. “Aaaaaand,” he winds his arm back as he bends at his waist, “scoop!” He snatches her off of the ground easily, her fragile frame so light it makes that mothering part of him get all worried about if she’s eating enough. Once he has Ella in his arms, he settles her on his hip the way he used to hold Sam during the sweet spot of their age difference when Dean was just strong enough to hold him and Sam was just small enough to be held. “You wanted front row seats, huh? Can’t argue with that one. These bad boys are pretty magnificent if I do say so myself.”
There Dean stands in glory under a sun that no longer seems jealous of him, but that has come to his aid gracefully. Its light hums a melody off of the tanned skin across Dean’s shoulders and hip bones until the air is buzzing yellow with Dean’s resonance. And Dean is here at Castiel’s apiary with only the sunshine covering him. Oh, without question it becomes a dream.
“I didn’t intend to worry you.” Castiel hesitates. He dredges up his memories from last night at the dinner table, words that he means and wants to say but doesn’t know how to air. He will air them here, he decides, with his forgotten memories like a shield to protect him. “I simply wanted to-to thank both of you. There is much that I don’t remember, and I have to assume that is because you were in a large part of my memories. In Heaven, we did not display any sort of affection or care for each other the way that it seems you two care for me. You have shown me more kindness in this short time than I have been witness to in my entire life. And I am very old.”
And even though Dean is thoroughly unhappy with the way things are going, he also knows that Cas isn’t going to hurt him, so the fight seeps out of his body to make way for something much older, much more tired. He’s been tired since he was born.
Suddenly, Dean feels a little hand grab at him just above his bare knee, and the sensation very nearly makes him yelp out loud. When he looks down a young girl with blonde hair stares back up at him. Squinting, it takes Dean a second before he recognizes who she is, but when he does a grin spreads across his face.
But the man just waves Dean off even as he turns to start walking away. “Take as long as you need, son. Hell, grab a few apples if you want. Just don’t piss on any of my trees.” And with that, the farmer disappears into the night.
he thinks he hears from the mouth of a young woman to her friends with stars in her eyes while they walk in front of his stall.
Most certainly, almost terribly, Castiel wants to reach out to him. Wants to touch this soft, glowing Dean that he’s sure only a handful of others get to see. But he won’t. He won’t ruin this with greedy hands. Dean’s company is too wonderful to lose, so he will sit on his own traitorous fingers even as they itch to cradle Dean’s cheek.
Castiel lets out a breath through his nose. “I think… there was a part of me that never forgot you in the first place. I was very drawn to you. Perhaps even more so in some ways, because I was unaware that there was a reason not to be. Even when I didn’t know you, I found you extremely attractive.”
He waits until one of those blue eyes peek up from their hiding spot, glaring at him above rosy cheeks. "I mean, I know we’re married, having a helluva' time, honestly. And you’ve always had this weird lack of knowledge about, ya know, personal space and shit. But sweetheart," Dean smiles through a sigh, "What are you doing prodding me in my sleep?"
Neither fall back asleep. Instead, they lie together in a quiet lull. Almost like they cut out a piece of time all for themselves. Dean’s not even sure how much has passed until Cas speaks again, albeit the quiet murmuring that it is.
"Yes, five," Claire repeats, "A whole hand. Two fingers is not all my fingers on this hand, but five is. So, five makes me a grown-up."
"C’mon, angel," Dean rasps, as he starts jerking into the hold of Cas, his length burning where it meets Cas’s; the need for release overpowering his ability to keep a rhythm. "Haven’t got all day."
Blue eyes peek up at him from where they’re resting on his bare chest, putting the dawning ocean of azure beyond the window to a depressing shame. Caught out, they anxiously flick from both of his own forest greens to his cheek.
Claire, for her part, seems to be actually offended. Standing up on the mattress, looking precious (though Dean believes she’s going for intimidating) in her fluffy Star Trek pyjamas, she plants her hands on her hips in that funny way kids do, and pronounces, "I am five." Pointing to Miracle, she continues, "Mirgle is two. That makes me a grown-up."
Cas begins, timbre voice still muffled into Dean’s skin. He lifts his head one more time and looks at Dean with an inordinate amount of determination. "I was counting your freckles."
He reaches up with one hand, lacing it through Cas’s hair, curling at the nape of his neck before dragging him back down so their lips collide in a brutal crash once again.
Once he’s quietened down, Cas goes back to nestling in the crook of his neck, circling absent patterns into Dean’s chest. Dean ghosts his hand across Cas’s back a few times, eventually resting in the small base of it, with his other hand on the sharp jut of his hip bone. Dean really loves Cas’ hip bones.
Cas leans over Dean, presumably to take a look at the clock on his bedside table. He shrugs, frowning in thought. "Don’t know, it’s only half seven, they usually storm the capital around eight."
"I just wanted to let you know,’ He bites his lip, but continues despite his hesitancy, ‘You don’t wake up before me every morning."
"Hey, that’s my line," Dean teases, feigning offence. For it, he receives a withering glare that screams
He kisses Cas until his lips are red and swollen, and he lets his hands find those hip bones, gripping them with an iron strength, pinning Cas beneath and he moves his mouth over to Cas’ ear, following the line of his jaw, and over his Adam’s apple to nibble down the crook of his neck.
"Fa, why - why’d you push Da - Dad off da bed?" Claire keeps her blue gaze on Cas as she wrestles out of Dean’s arms and into the empty space between her two dads.
Eyes twinkling, Cas’ gummy smile only shows a hint of smugness. Cocky bastard who knows Dean too well, that’s what he is. "You think it’s sweet?"
Dean sits up as Cas comes to crawl onto the bed over him, and with both hands, he takes Dean’s face in his reverent hold. He kisses him. Not with heat or crazed lust, but still powerful in its strength. He only pulls back enough to lean his forehead against Dean’s, who's still in his grasp.
Dean falls back into the bed, relishing in a drowsy warmth as he watches Cas get dressed. With his bedhead hair rumpled and cheeks exerting a healthy flush, he looks more gorgeous than anyone has the right to in black sweatpants and a maroon hoodie.
Cas moans again, his head falling back, face the frozen vision of ecstasy; eyes closed, cheeks flush with sweat collecting on his temple. He’s lost in the moment, unapologetic in his audible pleasure. Usually, Dean loves hearing Cas’s rasped moans, he practically gets off on it. But he can’t have Cas making too much noise this morning, he’ll cut their time short.
"Love you," Cas replies in the same hushed tone, before giving Dean a peck of his own. Turning to the two blonde bundles of joy practically in his lap, he huffs, shaking his head fondly. "Come now, Claire, Miracle, we’re going to go for our walk."
His voice becomes softer as he goes on, losing himself in remembering all the colours he’s seen. Colours he knows off by heart, yet never wants to miss the chance to pick them out all over again.
His fingers, which had a bruising hold on Cas’s hips, now slowly inch around the elastic of the waistbands they hide beneath. Skirting his fingers around it, he rubs comforting circles into his husband’s v-line, continuing to plunder Cas’ mouth all the while.
With a wolfish grin, Dean flips Cas over so he's on top. Leaning down until his mouth is a breadth away from Cas’s, he flicks his tongue once, grazing Cas’ bottom lip; enough to ripple a shiver through the man underneath him. "Perfect," He whispers, as he captures his husband’s lips in his. Cas opens for him beautifully, twirling his tongue with Dean's as he moans raggedly.
Castiel sighs. “I want to come home and find him there. The bees will make honey without me. Christmas time should be spent with those you love.”
“I thought about how shitty it would be for me to just ignore what you told me. ‘Cause if you thought it was true, and you thought it was important enough to use your last minute of living to tell me, who was I to shit on your grave? And maybe,” Dean takes a deep shuddering breath, “maybe if it was you saying it, Cas, I could believe it. I wanted to believe it for you. You deserved that.”
It’s with a quiet sticky noise that their lips finally separate. Their hands fall into their respective laps. When Dean opens his eyes, it’s to the painting of Cas’s face, his lips swollen like they would be tender to the touch. Those eternity eyes blinking back at him through thick brown lashes.
He takes Dean’s face in his hands and kisses him again. Dean pushes up into it with an open sound where their tongues touch, wet and splendid. It is warm in this place. Castiel wants to curl up in Dean’s molars and rot away. It’s sloppy, lazy, and the hair on the back of Castiel’s neck stands on end.
“Yeah,” Dean rushes, raising a hand out as if to steady her, “yeah, sorry, everything’s good.” He brings the hand to his chin, before moving it down into the cradle of his other palm.
When Dean brings the razor up to his neck, his humming peters to nothing and he holds himself still, jutting his chin out to stretch the skin taut. It’s meditative, and the harder task of maneuvering around the bumps of his chin and lips is out of the way. The next stroke of the razor holds the weight of Cas’s eyes with it.
The navy-painted wood of the honey stall is visible along the path now, about twenty yards up. Dean’s heart beats a little harder even as he tries to convince himself that it isn’t, like if he tells himself enough times that there’s nothing to be nervous about, he just won’t be nervous anymore. But he’s not nervous. He’s just antsy.
Dean huffs out a laugh and scratches his chin. He looks a little lost, a little nervous. “Yeah, you could say that.”
And that’s it, isn’t it? John Winchester tolerated him. Maybe before, Dean could have fooled himself. But not here, on the other side of forty and being a Full House father to a couple of kids. Hindsight is 20/20, and looking back it seems so obvious that Dean made all that love up in his head. How fucked. That back when their biggest worry was the yellow-eyed demon, John was just going to let Dean die. Dean thinks about all of the people he loves now, the priority they have in his life, and wonders if he could ever do something like that to them even when he knows the answer is no. You don’t do that to someone you love.
Castiel stares at him. Dean’s pinned in place with that steady gaze that gives light to only a fraction of the power Cas holds. It’s so intense, in a way that Dean would have made a joke about if this had been before. Instead, Dean holds Cas’s eyes and resists the urge to squirm.
“So,” Dean fumbles awkwardly, “so I’m saying you can. Look at me, I mean. I won’t make it weird, promise. And I’m sorry that I got on you for it earlier.”
“Hmm,” she hums almost contentedly. She looks down at the drawing one more time. “I can see why you wanted to save them like this, ya know? This moment.”
“If you need to cry, then I’ll just cry with you. That way, you can’t feel weird about it because I’m doing it, too.”
Well. Dean isn’t so sure he’s ever felt this exact emotion before. The way his body reacts before his brain does. The way his jaw ticks and the skin of his scalp tightens. His foot steps off of the wooden crate into dirt, then the other. He doesn’t really notice the people between him and the guy, but Dean thinks that they’ve parted for him. Until Dean is right there in front of the dumb fucker. It’s funny, ‘cause Dean has at least four inches on him.
Alright, now Dean’s feeling pissy. But when he looks up to give Sam a piece of his mind, Sam is looking back at him with genuine confusion. Dean deflates. “Should I?”
Dean holds up his hands in surrender. He feels light with it, with this new discovery that he can make people feel something pleasant with the fingers that some days he swears he can still see blood on no matter how clean they are. “How about we break out the makeup brushes? Apparently, those are, like, pretty sweet.”
Sure enough, when Dean looks over at the neighboring house about a dozen yards off through the window that he knows leads into the kitchen, Eileen is peering out. She waves when she realizes he’s looking at her and he waves back much more happily than he would have if it were Sam looking out at him.
Castiel finds himself smiling again unbiddenly. “My sister and I own four apiaries around the outskirts of the town, where we get our four main varietals, and we do business with other beekeepers in the kingdom for the varietals that correspond with fauna that doesn’t grow near here.”
"Hi, I'm searching for Cas- uhh, Castiel," Dean managed to awkwardly blur out and tried to keep his posture as straight as possible afterwards. He got this far, he wouldn't back down now.
Observing from the outside, Dean hadn’t been able to detect the blue-eyed guy, and he was usually very good at finding people, so he decided to go inside. He had put all the scent blockers on he could have gathered in the short time, just to make sure nobody smelled anything they had smelled before. Even if he had been on blockers said evening about a week ago as well, so there should be no traces to follow.
"I'm gonna order some burgers and call Jess, alright?" Sam asked, and the omega could just nod. Maybe he had gotten rid of the alpha for good this time.
When he got out at the Gas'n Sip, he contemplated for the umpteenth time this day if the risk of getting caught was really worth it. Something deep inside of him told him it was.
Every single black-eyed bastard, who seemed to come ten feet or less close to them was hurled into the air and send flying out and away from them.
The older Winchester really wanted to pray to Cas as shit went down and Sam got separated from him, but refrained from it, because the guy probably had better stuff to do. With those dicks, who called themselves angels for example.
"Have you ever heard of 'True Mates'?" the alpha asked and Dean almost grinned because of air quotes and all. Then he remembered the question required an answer, and he shook his head and nodded at the same time.
“I will go outside and make it look as if we all left together in a car. They will follow me if I bind a piece of Glynn, preferable her blood to my grace because it will seem as if there was an unprotected Nephilim with me.”
On the Friday of Jody’s, Claire’s and Alex arrival, Dean tried to get over his nervousness by cooking the best feast any of them had ever seen. His brother had taken the angel to clean some long-forgotten gore out of the war room and ready the rooms for their guests, what left the older hunter alone in the kitchen with Glynn.
“I have about two weeks left,” Glynn said suddenly startling the male hunters in the room. Man, she was so much braver than them, Dean thought. She would have made a very good Winchester.
If Dean should recall afterward how many hours it had taken, he couldn’t. After Hours of pain for his wife and supporting words whispered by him, Dean finally held his daughter in his arms. Her face was wrinkled, and she had a very red color as well as a white substance all over her, what was because she was born before the due date, as Dean remembered.
"You're in rut," Dean stated the obvious and Anna, who had been turned towards her brother, rolled her eyes.
There were tears in her eyes, and Dean could feel his wet cheeks as well. Whatever he had done wrong at any point in his life, this moment was definitively worth it.
He jumped one guy, held a hand over his mouth, while he used the momentum, to kick the other person, a woman, in the face. Then he pressed his arm around the first person's neck to cut off his airways until he stopped moving.
"No, nothing too bad. Just t a- a car accident." Dean shrugged at the eye roll his brother directed at him. What, was he supposed to tell this gas station worker, that he had blown up a warehouse because his boss had gone to a gang meeting with too few people and too less ammo?
“It took you an awkwardly long time to find it, regarding the two angels we ganked back when it, err, came into being.” The hunter tried to bring himself into a sitting position against the trunk, when the other stepped closer.
When Cas emerged from one of the front doors he was alone, but almost every student looked after him as he approached the eye-catching car. It was probably weird for them to see their teacher walking with such a fast and energetic step, meeting some guy in a black car. Whereas they probably couldn’t even see Dean.
“Dean, we can’t take the Impala, the pregnant women beneath us have problems to get in or out,” Sam voiced from across the car and his brother just glared at him. Cas made a sound, that came close to a chuckle as he lowered Glynn into the passenger seat.
"Wait," Dean suddenly interrupted, following a horrifying train of thoughts. "Zack doesn't have any children. Doesn't that make you the legitimate heir of the leadership of the angels? Holy hell."
“Maybe she is like Mary, the virgin, you know?” he asked gazing dreamily into space. Yeah sure, it was easy enough to get into her bed, Dean thought. They were sitting in another motel room than the one they had their stuff in, to not reveal their secrets to anyone who might be watching.
The guy, that probably had a wife at home, whom he had a daughter with. That guy that was most likely straight. Even imagining him with any woman, or generally in bed with anybody else than Dean, made him strangely jealous. Goddamnit, he should just forget him. His beautiful blue eyes, his strangely arranged hair, that always looked like he just got up, his lean shoulders…
On their way back, they passed a local bar, only three hundred meters from the motel, and as Dean saw a familiar form disappearing through the doors he held his brother back. “Hey, I will go for a drink,” he said and licked his lips at the prospect. He could do some investigating in his favourite environment with girls around him and some booze in his hand.
Dean almost lifted his hand to facepalm himself. Of course, the doctor in the hospital had explained to him, while he had been only half-listening as usual, that they gave omegas and alphas suppressants after big surgeries so they wouldn't put too much stress on their bodies. Damn, why hadn't he thought of that?
"Ah, why, but you must know about it," Zack replied. "He must have handed it down to you with his death." Well, you didn't know my dad then, Dean thought and was very aware of the fact, that he was not far enough away from the bombs he had deposited not to get hurt when they got off. He really had to trust at least in the fact, that Crowley wanted one thing above all: his own survival.
“Wow, that’s wonderful, Dean,” he said, his smile clearly leaking into his voice. Dean’s breathless laughter mad the others in the room turn to him.
“Okay, well, she left for grandmas with the bus in front of our flat, so she should be one town over already. Do you want me to give you the address? It’s three hours from here.” Dean made a choking sign, before his brother could even think of going there.
“This is stupid.” It was night, and the Winchester brothers were sitting on a wall opposite the church in front of which Michael Foster claimed to have seen the angel. They had decided to better not take the Impala, since the motel was just around the corner and since every angel and every monster knew by now, who was sitting in said vehicle.
"You-" he started but was interrupted by an especially hard thrust, "you need to bite me as soon as it pops, alright?" Cas just nodded but was otherwise quiet, burying his face in Dean's neck again. As the omega pulled him closer by tangling his fingers in the other's hair and his alpha let out a moan, that was shaking him in his core.
“If he is not already,” Sam countered. “It’s possible, that they had contact after my investigation yesterday and I suppose, that everyone in heaven and hell knows, that we normally travel as FBI agents.”
"Just some- some guy asked for something dad apparently has stolen from them. Wouldn't tell me what it was but it seemed to be pretty important." Dean swallowed a sip of his tea. Buah, he'd never liked that stuff. Maybe he could convince his brother, that Bourbon would be better for his healing process.
“I don’t know. We have no idea what exactly the witches spell was about,” his brother rambled behind him and he rolled his eyes. “What if she wanted to harm us. What if it has negative long-term consequences.”
“Hi,” Dean said and cleared his throat. Get it together, man, he’s probably married. Of course, he had spent the rest of the evening yesterday with thinking of reasons to not flirt with his hot neighbor, but he seemed to forget every one of them.
"Dean," the omega said without thinking and immediately scrunched up his face. He had told his real first name, and that was dangerous. Everything about him was dangerous for the other.
Dean somehow felt like one of these high school students himself. He came back to inspect Cas car, a dark blue Prius, that he didn’t like in an instant. I’m going to get rid of this car, he thought to himself.
So, when Cas came back one day with a piece of paper in his one hand and the rest of the mail in the other, he was trembling. Dean immediately got up from the couch approaching him but not quite daring to touch the other. With her head leaned on the armchair, Jo was looking up from the floor, where she had been reading a magazine on hunting while playing with her baby’s feet.
The older hunter untangled himself from the angel and turned around towards his brother, who seemed to be very occupied with a map and their records of old hiding places.
the bees. And for the love of God, use a condom!” Before Sam can get out another word, Dean closes the garage door between them as he laughs to himself. It’ll be a lonely trip, but at least he won’t have to listen to Sam complain about Zeppelin playing the entire time.
It’s a Tuesday night. A bad day before what’s about to be an even worse one. Dean hadn’t even bothered to pretend to be friendly with every person he had passed when he went into town to get more drawing charcoal. Tomorrow, they’ll all be avoiding his eyes anyway, for once. For once, the people of this town will have a little bit of shame.
Things that should make sense don’t, flit in and out Castiel’s head with fervor. “Earlier today, you referred to me as Cas. Why?”
Dean mock pouts at him. “What? I’m not allowed to want to sit with my devastatingly handsome boyfriend?”
“It’s strange,” Cas finally breaks through the moment quietly. “I find watching you shave arousing.” There’s no heat in his voice, though, just mild curiosity.
She blushes again, but this time she scoots a little closer on the bench so that she can see his page more easily. “Okay.”
In Castiel’s mind, he can still see the way that Dean had held that little girl on his hip. Ella, the same one from that first night that had begun a shift in Castiel that has yet to stop its erosion on landscape.
Dean thinks about Cas’s words from before, and how he hasn’t been touched like this in thousands of years. The fact that Cas had to sneak away to be touched with care in the first place. Lonely, lonely, lonely.
Ella pouts like she’s thinking and says, “I know… I know! My mama said magic people can- sometimes they can be- um- birds.”
, because it feels like all there’s ever been between him and Cas is too much space. He tries to get the point across by pulling down on Cas’s neck, and it seems to work because Cas’s lips leave his in favor of kissing along his jaw.
But then he sees the dark navy stall ahead with its little light on like a beacon through the mist and he smiles to himself. It’s yellow where it shines out welcomingly, a single spot of warmth in the colorless morning and sea of stalls.
They walk through another doorway into a completely dark little room. “Well, I’m going to have to put you down to turn the lights on.”
“We’re going home, Cas-Castiel. Like, home home. Now that you’re human, you live with us in this massive underground bunker that used to belong to a group of hunters.”
And then Cas looks so insufferably Cas when he says, “Oh, Dean, it’s sweet that you threw the word ‘trying’ in there. I think you meant, ‘succeeding’.”
Dean is watching Castiel pointedly, but eventually nods. “Sam’s right. You’re our family, and we take care of our family, period. And I don’t make my World Famous Pancakes for just anyone.” With that, he turns back to the stove and cracks another egg into the pan.
Castiel mulls their conversation over in his head. It is even the vaguest notion of belonging that sets a fresh wave of tears into his eyes. “I think… I am very happy to be Cas.”
“I suppose it depends on whether or not you’re any good at baking,” Castiel deadpans on instinct, and before he can even panic about how rude that sounded Dean is laughing.
Dean imagines it, a sweet little Cas before he became a warrior, before he became depended on, when his most basic nature was to find a way to be gentle with others like him. Others who wanted to be gentle too even when they were condemned for it.
Dean’s hand turns into a white-knuckled fist that he raps against the table in feigned nonchalance while his cheeks puff out with the breath he’s holding. When he lets it out, there’s a whining “Heh,” on the end of it. He nods, clears his throat. Cas is looking way too smug. “Mmm, mmhmm, yep. You’re a quick learner, Cas.” Dean can’t help the way his voice comes out strangled.
“That’s high praise,” Cas replies, not an ounce of sarcasm in his voice. “I’ll have to do this more often from now on.”
“Butterflies,” he says at the same time Cas does, except there were more voices that spoke than just them. Four voices. Dean shoots a look over his shoulder to where Eileen and Sam are huddled close and staring at him and Cas in awe.
Dean falls back into him like he’s jumping out of an airplane without a parachute. No more barriers, no more trivial bodies to get in the way. They’re blending down to the atom, down to where Dean can feel his soul crawling out and unraveling. He’s so sensitive, he realizes distantly. Everything is raw like newly healed skin that hasn’t seen the light of day. But it feels so good.
There’s the quiet twinkling of water dripping into itself before Dean feels the touch of Cas’s fingers again. They come back soaking, like Cas got them as wet as he possibly could before touching Dean again. It feels like it’s two fingers, the middle and pointer, that Cas sweeps in a long stroke across Dean’s forehead. The water falls down Dean’s face in rivets, into the hollows of his eyes and down the line of his nose until it drips off the tip into his lap.
But it’s so obvious that that’s only part of it. Maybe Cas really doesn’t want to intrude, but Dean thinks it’s more that he’s anxious over even stepping foot into center square, out of his lonely comfort zone. Lonely, but at least no one can hurt him there. Dean gets it. He also won’t let Cas get away with it.
“What if I told you that you were holy? That, to me, this is as consecrated as ceremony?” Castiel pauses, then breathes, “That the inside of this body becomes a place for unity? Here.” He presses his finger all the way in before drawing it out with little effort. “Right here. Where you become a vessel not through lineage, and not through coercion, but through the desire for us to be closer.”
"I suppose I can, but first --" Balthazar snapped his fingers and suddenly Sam and Dean came tumbling into the room "I don't like spies, Castiel. You know this."
