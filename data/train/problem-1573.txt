"Why would you answer it?" Lestrade asked causing John to shrug.
"So dramatic," Molly whispers in amusment causing everyone who heard her to chuckle.
John would be lying if he said that he hadn’t thought about it. But Sherlock had been so disappointed when she was dead that he hadn’t gone through with it. Not that John ever bothered to answer Kitty.
"What if someone had just found the phone and rang the person to find out who's phone it is," Molly asks, her head tiltied to the side.
"Manners, Sherlock," Mrs Hudson muttered.
The Yarders all sigh at Sherlock’s actions, shaking their heads but not even a bit surprised at him.
"That poor man," Molly whispers as they watch the time flicker by and no one noticing the corpse.
"This wasn't a horror movie," John pointed out.
John huffs as his friends send him amused and teasing looks. Though Lestrade looked almost like he understood John's joy.
“Honestly, I’m just surprised that Sherlock knew that reference,” Anderson commented, not to be mean, just stating a fact.
"Aww, look at Sherlock, protecting John," Everyone chuckles at John.
"Anyone who actually knows what they are doing would always perform their own interviews," Lestrade muttered to himself. Wondering why Henry would think the Documentary would be good enough.
Kitty blinked in shock at Sherlock wondering if there was something wrong with him. That didn’t seem very in character of the Sherlock she knew.
"Wait what?" Molly questions, as the others all blink shock. Because how the hell did he get that from a corpse?
"What is with these people and strangling Sherlock?"
A few people sighed, sad that John was leaving. As they refused to believe that Sherlock actually meant that.
Everyone couldn't help but snort at Henry accidentally insulting Sherlock, especially since he was a fan.
"Oh John," Mrs Hudson says, glancing down at John's knee.
"I'm honestly suprised we didn't notice it before," John commented, a couple people hum in reponse.
"Which case is next?" Lestrade asks curiously, turning to face John, who frowned in response.
"Oh my god," Molly gasps, a hand going to cover her mouth. Tears quickly filling her eyes. The otehrs all shake their heads, sadness filling them. And with Lestrade and John, also guilt at not being able to save her in time.
“Where’s Mrs Hudson?” Molly questioned fearfully, dreading the answer.
"Oh, you have no idea" John muttered remembering all the weird and stupid things Sherlock did when he was bored.
"Why is there always someone sleeping with their worker in these things?" Lestrade asks fully expecting the silence that followed.
“A lot, apparently,” Lestrade teases.
"Ha ha very funny,"
"You know, I'm suprised it took my little brother so long to figure it out, I mean it's was so obvious," Mycroft comment absetmindedly.
"Sherlock never needs any incentive," Molly points out a small on her face as she watches the screen.
A few people cringed when it was revealed that the present was for Sherlock.
“Because I find it relaxing,” John muttered slightly.
“It was hard not to,” John defended himself.
“That sounds like you’re talking from experience,” Lestrade says, in a questioning tone.
"My brother, can be an idiot sometimes," Mycroft agreed, disappointment filling his voice. Everyone else muttered words of agreement, even Donovan, though quieter and less passionate, was yelling at the past Sherlock.
Sadness quickly gave way to anger as Irene dares to insult Sherlock. Though a few of them can’t help but wonder if Sherlock was right or not.
John sighs, Sherlock was of course right, but it had been nice to hope for once.
"What's Sherlock looking for?" Donovan questioned, trying to keep the disgust out of her voice. No one answers her anyway.
"Otherwise he would be more careful," Mycroft added absentmindedly either ignoring or not hearing Molly.
"How did it take you that long to figure out?" Kitty questioned snidely.
Once again everyone starts laughing. Even John laughed, though his was more awkward then actual laughter.
Despite being annoyed at Frankland, they all chuckled in amusement at Frankland calling John, Sherlock’s PA. None of them had thought of John as that, and now they couldn’t think of John as anything else.
"Why is it jumping around so much? Why not just explain everything all at once?" Molly asks, slight annoyance in her voice.
“Of course you’re not John,” Mrs Hudson reassured John, who grinned back at the old woman.
"I don't understand, if she was being comparative why couldn't she just say the name, instead of just saying he?" Mrs Hudson tuts. "It's not like Sherlock wasn't going to ask,"
"Why didn't you run?" Lestrade asks, as everyone else chuckles at John's misfortune.
"Because he doesn't care,"
"Why would he see Liberty?" Anderson questioned in confusion. Correctly guessing that the silence meant that he would find out.]
"John," Mrs Hudson muttered, disappointment lacing her words.
"Oh," Molly whispers, grinning slighlty.
"That's what's happening to that Henry, isn't it?" Mrs Hudson questioned, concern filling her voice.
Donovan frowned harder, all her previous doubts filling her, becoming almost unbearable, because what if they were true? Then she condemned an innocent man. Then she had caused Sherlock's suicide.
"The last date you guys went on she almost died, most girls would leave before you could say 'stay'" Donovan pointed out, shaking her head slightly.
"How the hell did he get there?" Anderson questioned, one hand covering his heart.
"Keep watching," John responds with a small smile, and Molly nods, blushing slightly.
“I would not have expected her to say that,” Donovan commented in shock. John winced, remembering that fight.
"To be fair, me and Mrs Hudson would always watch it, so Sherlock might have ended up seeing it when he came to talk to us," John pointed out. Anderson nods slightly and hums.
"What do you think she saw?" Molly asked curiously, and everyone, even Mycroft though he was probably just following the crowd, looked over at John.
"Yeah well obviously, cause he was behind the whole thing from the start!" Donovan yells.
"Very Dramatic," Someone mutters with a snicker, sounding amused.
"How the hell is the dog still alive?" Anderson grumbled, sick of all the jumpscares in this case.
"Unfortuantly that's so true," Mrs. Hudson murmurs quietly.
“Apparently not,” Donovan answered, with a frown.
"Sherlock," Mrs Hudson mutters. Everyone, even Donavan frowned, it being to soon to his death.
"Why can she say it?" Donovan snapped.
"So that's how he knew," Molly murmed, saying what half of them where thinking of.
“Of course Sherlock has the phone on him,” Lestrade mutters to himself fondly.
"Yep," John muttered in resignation.
"It really was," John muses to himself, a fond smile on his face as he looks at his best friend.
"Do you think he actually has seen it?" Molly mused out loud.
"It usually works with Sherlock," John defended himself.
"I thought he hated her," Molly said, thought it was more of a question than a statement.
"John?" Lestrade asks curiously, John moves forward slightly, nodding.
"But you shot with your right,"
Mycroft couldn't help but wince at how horrible his relationship with his brother had been.
"Well he's not wrong," Donovan huffed under her breath.
“Wait, they actually have a dog?” Molly questions in shock.
Molly gasps in shock nd even though the Yards, John and Mrs Hudson know that Sherlock will be okay, they can't help but feel worry as they stare at the scene on the screen.
"Sherlock is being nice, he's up to something," Molly jokes causing everyone to laugh even harder.
"Somehow,"
"Not another one!" Donovan protested.
"That girl doesn't take a hint does she?" Anderson commented, "It's painstakingly obvious that Sherlock's hates her,"
"What's Sherlock looking at?" Anderson questioned worriedly. No one answered him. Which only increased his and everyone else's worry.
“Help,” John replied in a clipped tone.
"Sherlock looks like hee's going to kiss you," Molly comments, almost wistfully, her words causing John to blush.
Everyone flinched as Sherlock suddenly yelled. More at the sudden loud noise than Sherlock actually yelling.
A few snorted at John agreeing to help Sherlock only because of how beautiful the therapist was. Though Mrs. Hudson shakes her head at him.
“Yep,” John grumbled, glaring slightly at the man.
"What's he talking about?" Kitty, ever the reporter asked. Mycroft smirks over at her but doesn't speak, no one else bothering to help her.
“I’m tougher than I look,” Mrs Hudson responded, smiling slightly that Sherlock wanted her around so badly.
"Why would you waste the effort to break into a high security bank just to send a message?" Lestrade asks, mostly in annoyance.
"Just seems really anti-climatic," He admitted with a sigh. John rolled his eyes at the officer.
“That would be annoying, not being able to talk about the things that you do,” Donovan mused, knowing that she would hate to have keep the biggest achievements of her career a secret.
"Yes,"
"He went to go looking around," John grumbled slightly.
He had never said that aloud, never told anyone about the feelings he had been trying so hard to squash. Arms wrapped around him, and it took longer than he would like to realise that they belonged to Mrs Hudson and Molly.
"Why was the last one longer?" Anderson questions.
"They're not trying," Mycroft couldn't help but comment, sounding a lot like a prick, which is normal.
"I wonder why," Anderson muttered. "It's not like you look like a serial killer or something,"
"Sherlock is innocent," John hissed at her. Kitty snorted and rolled her eyes but didn't answer.
“Apparently he didn’t,” Lestrade confirmed.
More worry filled the room as yet another person came up. Everyone thinks along the same lines that the more people who see them, the more likely they would get caught.
"Only an idiot would give their actual name," Anderson pointed put.
"Jennifer Wilsons,"
“Um,” Anderson muttered as everyone stared at the screen in shock. Surprised that Irene was completely naked.
"Arrogrant much?" Kitty hisses under her breath. The other's huff in amusement, because that was Sherlock for you.
Mycroft frowned, he was pretty sure he just saw the shadowy figure stiffen in anger, but he couldn't be sure.
"Where do you normally eat?" Molly asks.
Wait a minute!" Mycroft informed them.
"Maybe she could but she just wanted to be nice to the freak," Donovan replied, disbleif filling her voice towards the end.
John blushes as everyone laughs at him.
"He hasn't figured it out yet," Mycroft commented, finally sounding amused, yet still uptight.
"What? Is he going to start a book club?" Molly jokes slightly still feeling slightly uncomfortable. A couple people chuckle, smiling over at her.
"Why would NATO care?" Anderson questioned.
"You're so proud of yourself," Lestrade teases. John flushes slightly, his head bowing.
“Oh,”
"Miss Riley, if, as you believe, Sherlock is behind everything, wouldn't that make him the killer of Carl Powers, which happened when Sherlock was a kid, who Sherlock only knew after Carl had died," Mycroft stated, Kitty frowned in response. Donovan, sitting off to the side listened quietly. Her opnions moving slightly at the realisation.
"Where the hell are we?" Donovan demanded as she spun around, surveying the room.
"That's the same one that Sherlock got caught in right?" Molly questions.
"*cough* awkward *cough*" Anderson 'coughed' causing a lot of people to chuckle.
“Huh, I guess he did know human ash,” Anderson muses quietly to himself.
--3rd P.O.V.--
“Do you guys still don’t know?” Kitty questioned, for once there was no hatred or disgust in her voice as she talked about Sherlock.
"He's like a child!" Kitty exclaimed in a mixture of shock and disgust.
As they reached the road, a black fancy car pulled in front of them. It's windows tinted black to stop intruders from peering in, and a pretty girl stepped out of the car, from the passenger's door. John sighed in annoyance at the sight. "I'm not going with you, I don't want anything to do with him." John all but growled as anger replaced the annoyance, after all, it was his fault. If he hadn't of sold out his own brother for information, Moriarty never would have been able to pull it off and John didn't care what anybody said, Sherlock was not a fraud.
"Since when has he noticed something like that?" Lestrade asks in shock, not remembering a time that Sherlock ever noticed if someone was wearing lipstick or not, or even being interested in someone like that.
"John, subtly!" Lestrade laughs slightly at John who just blushes even more, the officers laughing even more.
"Wasn't he just complaining about being bored?" Molly questioned.
"That wasn't very nice," Molly muttered, and both John and Lestrade shot an apologetic look over to Mrs Hudson who just waves them off.
"Please tell me you don't get into that car, and instead walk away like a normal person with any common sense!" Lestrade shouts and the other Yarders hum in agreement. John ducks his head sheepishly.
Everyone but John's eyes widen at Sherlock being there. Even Mycroft was surprised that his baby brother had followed John.
Anderson, Donovan and Kitty can't help but blink in surprise as they stared at Sherlock. He went on a fan site. They knew that it was for a case but still, it was surprising in a funny kind of way.
"Hey!" John shouted, frowning slightly.
"It was how he worded it," John admitted, not wanting to give too much away as he remembered how Moriarty had lost his voice that way.
Despite how absurd everything sounded, those with a conscience, still winced at the flashbacks. Feeling sorry that Henry had to witness such a traumatic event.
"Seriously? Your just going to leave her?" Lestrade asks in shock.
And everyone proceeds to try and tear their hair out and scream profanities as Sherlock goes against their wishes.
"Alot of people," John muttered, "Until they all turned on him," He added.
“Oh my god,” Molly gasped, with the Yarder's eyes widening. More than a few of them looked like they were ready to kill Neilson.
“Oh thank god,” Molly whispered in relief, glad that Sherlock hadn’t been harmed.
The Yarders, Molly, Mrs Hudson and John can't help but smile, because Sherlock realy did have a heart.
Everyone winces at that, and even Kitty looked slightly disgust. But she brushed it off as Jim being a good actor, even though a little seed of doubt planted itself in her mind.
Everyone except for John, Mycroft and Mrs Hudson frowned, curious as to why Sherlock was so angry and irritated. More so than usual, anyway.
Donovan snorts and rolls her eyes as the others chuckle at John's expense.
"What is he talking about?” Molly questioned turning to look at Lestrade. Having forgotten that other things could happen during this case.
"And who are you?" Lestrade asks.
--3rd P.O.V.--
More laughter filled the room at John's deflection.
Donovan and Anderson both blush slightly, remembering what happened afterwards.
"What like you?" Donovan joked slightly, causing Anderson to frown at her.
Everyone snorted at the very obvious lie. Wondering how anyone could actually believe that.
“Didn’t you live with him?” Kitty questioned in shock.
"We were never together!" John hisses, and that definitely wasn't a tinge of bitterness in John's voice. Nope totally not.
"How did you know that?" Kitty questions in shock. John sent her an annoyed look, not wanting to answer that, not because of the question but because of the annoying person asking it.
"Awkward," Anderson muttered under his breath, causing them all to burst out laughing.
"Yeah, why?" John questioned, frowning over at him in confusion. After all, ever since this had started, Anderson hadn't doubted Sherlock before.
"That's Sherlock, he never did have any patience," John replied wistfully, his voice soft more like he was looking fondly back on old meomeries then having a conversation.
“Let me guess, it’s the second one,” Anderson muttered, with a lot less contempt in his voice than before.
"He likes talking aloud," John muttered though not really giving an answer.
“Huh,” Lestrade mutters to himself, figuring out what Sherlock was getting at.
“I needed to talk to John about my brother,” Mycroft answered.
The room blinks in shock as they watch the fight, even John had no idea what was going on.
"Hey, those were the vases I was talking about," Lestrade announces.
"Poor Dimmock," Molly commented though she her voice was teasing which was sounded weird with her normal nice girl attiuide.
"Sherlock used the same clues as I did!" Donovan pointed out.
"What's so bad about Cluedo?" Anderson questioned, causing John, Mrs Hudson and Mycroft to all huff and shake their heads in varying degrees of annoyance.
"How did you get my number?" John questioned, realizing he never got an answer to that. Mycroft smirked in response.
A few people blink in shock, but most, like the Yarders weren’t all that surprised at Sherlock’s announcement.
Those that actually cared all sighed at seeing Sherlock not eating.
"What the hell is he talking about?!? Sherlock was super polite!" Molly yells in annoyance.
"Wait, what the fuck is that?" Almost everyone screeched as they stare at the white words that had appeared. Though no one bothers to even try and answer the questions, to shocked to speak as they stared at the screen. After a couple of seconds, of everyone in shocked silence, the screen turns black and words appear.
“Why is it showing Irene’s death?” Kitty questioned curiously as Mycroft and John leaned forward in their seats.
Everyone had kinda stopped laughing at John only to start laughing even harder, making John squirm in his seat yet again.
"I'm so confused," Anderson mutters.
"What are you doing?" Donovan asks, curosity getting the better of her.
Transcript: Arainedevere
"You stopped doing that," Lestrade mutters, causing John to raise an eyebrow at him. "You stopped saying praises about what Sherlock does," He elebrated and John shrugged, not knowing what to say.
"Your in trouble" Mrs Hudson says causing everyone, even John to chuckle, as Lestrade wakes up and laughs not actually knowing what everyone was laughing at.
John sighed sadly at the mention of them being together. Genuinely surprised when no one teased him about it. Slightly happy that they didn't, while also hating that they felt bad for him.
A grin formed on Lestrade’s face at Sherlock making sure that the men actually left, he knew that Sherlock could look after himself, but he was still glad.
"Why is he in a different shirt?" Donavan questioned, no one answered her. Mostly because a lot of them hadn't even noticed. Anderson squinted at the image of Sherlock before gasping in shock.
"Poor Sherlock," Mrs Hudson murmed sadly at the look of utter pain on his face.
Snorts filled the room at Sherlock already having guessed John's question. A lot of them having relaxed, praying that Sherlock is alright now.
"He really does get bored easy," Anderson mutters, almost shocked.
"Why on earth would Sherlock want you to text the victim?" Anderson asked incrediously.
"What?" Donooan questioned with a frown. John shrugged, having no idea either.
“Do you think that could be Bluebell?” Molly questioned curiously.
"Dramatic?"
Despite seeing evidence of the fact that Henry was rich, it was still surprising to find out that Henry was rich.
Everyone's faces immediantly drop, a sad sigh on their face. Especially for those who remembered how it ended.
"What? John was right?" Anderson blurts out, confusion lacing his voice.
"Hey, you! What are you doing?"
“In case you haven’t noticed, Sherlock is a very private person, and it didn’t exactly come up,” John answered, his tone clipped.
Everyone frowned at Frankland, the man being there again seemed to be too much of a coincidence.
"What is that book?" Molly asks, a little unnerved. No one bothers to answer her, mostly as the only person who knows the answer was Mycroft, who couldn't be bother answering him.
"He's got a point John, how do you say spectacularly ignorant in a nice way?" Lestrade teases causing John to frown slightly.
"You're a terrible liar John,"
Everyone who was now fond of Sherlock, chuckled at him not understanding sentiment, in fondness.
"He explains soon," John replied to Anderson, not wanting to explain or really remembering what happened.
"Did we see that?" Molly questioned with a frown, wondering if that was the bit they saw, or something else had happened to Henry.
"The woods near Dartmoor," Lestrade answered, remembering that case.
Everyone blinks in shock, confused as to why Bluebell had suddenly been brought up again. Especially seeing as a few had to remember who Bluebell was.
Snorts filled the room at John’s words. The male so obviously lying.
"He left John, he does that," Donovan answered, causing Molly to frown.
"Well of course Sherlock knows that theres a suitcase, I mean the freak is behind it all," Donovan's use of the word Sherlock, caused a soft smile to come to the Yarders only to harden once again when she said freak.
"Suspensful?"
"Please tell them you actually knew that it wasn't an accident and you were just humoring Sherlock," Donovan pressed. Lestrade shrugs.
“Wow,” Donovan whispered in shock before turning to an embarrassed Molly. “Even if the dress is a little overkill, it looks good,” She compliments, helping ease Molly’s embarrassment.
"Sherlock makes observations and estimates based on all the facts, he doesn't simply jump to an idea and stick with it," Mycroft explained.
"What?"
But before anyone could react further the words disappeared revealing....
"His using all his senses." He snapped.
“He can,” John defended his friend.
Any good mood was instantly gone when they notice the woman in sadness, wishing they could do something to help.
“Hey!” Mrs Hudson shouted, as everyone, well everyone but Moriarty, glared at the screen. With Mycroft and Kitty’s being a little more subtle, but they still glared.
Molly was the first to move closer to the food. Hunger getting the better of her. "Do you really think that it's safe to eat?" Molly asks curiously. When all she gets are shrugs Molly sighs but starts filling her plate. Gingerly, she takes a bit out of some corn, and she doesn't immediantly die she sits back down and starts eating.
No one was surprised at the confused look on Sherlock’s face, though it did elicit some sympathy from John and Molly.
They all laughed at John’s offhand comment.
"Who knows," Was the vague response that Donovan, who wanted specifics, didn't want.
"Rude," Molly can't help but comment.
“He just got an idea, didn’t he?” Donovan guessed.
"Just walk away," Mrs Hudson mutters over and over again like a prayer.
"They could have just saw John run off," Donovan pointed out causing Anderson to shrug.
“I wasn’t expecting that,” Anderson muttered in shock, but wasn’t all that surprised that Sherlock had managed to figure that out.
Almost everyone winced as Sherlock pointed the harpoon at her. Even though they knew Sherlock wouldn't hit Mrs Hudson, it was still unnerving.
"Yeah this is just before I met Sherlock," John muttered and Molly, Lestrade and Mrs Hudson gave him a small pitying look. John adverted his eyes and shuffled awkwardly before looking back at the screen.
Almost everyone hissed in annoyance as the message popped up. Everyone knew that when it finished processing they would be caught.
--3rd P.O.V.--
“Mycroft,” Mrs Hudson chided, “you shouldn’t be annoyed at your little brother calling for christmas,”
"And Sherlock is busy with what?" Donovan questioned, not really expecting an answer to Sherlock's weird ways.
"Why is he crying?" Molly questioned, slightly afraid and shocked. No one answered her, mostly because they were just as confused as she was.
"Freak,"
Everyone frowned in confusion. After all no one knew why or had even seen Sherlock like this.
was looking for the murderer but she probably thought he was," Anderson replied, stressing the word Sherlock with a pointed look.
"Most likely,"
A few people smile at Sherlock rolling his eyes, relaxing slightly as they come to the conclusion that they would be alright.
"No," John answered, his tone clipped.
"Your finally gettting it," Molly teased, amusement crinkling in her eyes.
"Why is she looking for Neptune?" Molly questions confused.
"Karma is a bitch,
“Sorry about that,” John commented, looking over at Mycroft.
"He sent me a text earlier,"
"Don't worry John, soon you'll never have a break," Anderson jokes, causing John to chuckle and hum in agreement.
“I know I said this before, but I’m glad you’re lying to him, and that you actually went through with it,” Molly commented quietly, smiling warmly over at John.
"Kind of? What do you mean kind of?" Anderson asked, turning to face John.
"He always seem to do that," John muses.
A few people huffed at John going into the room without bothering to read the sign. Mrs Hudson hitting him over the back of the head for being an idiot.
"Why would you say something so awful?" Molly asks turning to face the Sargent.
"Yeah, not my best moment."
"Anything you want us to tell us?" Lestrade teases causes him to blush even more.
"Is he?" Lestrade trails off, as he notices his colleagues embarrassed looks and sighs.
“How can he get nothing from her?” Anderson questioned in shock, his eyes widening. He had never heard of Sherlock not getting a deduction.
Mrs Hudson's antics have everyone at least smiling happily at the screen.
"His worried about what his sister thinks? Not about the fact that he just killed a guy or that his going to prison," Anderson couldn't help but comment.
I know this is a little late, but does anyone have any ships they want for this fanfic?
"Aww his proud of you," Anderson teases causing a blush to form on John's face.
Anderson couldn’t quite help but grin, glad that he wasn’t the only person Sherlock would suddenly kick out of the open so he could focus better.
A few people chuckle at the indirect mention of John and Sherlock being together, much to John’s annoyance.
"The killer, the name was on the files," Anderson comments, causing everyone to be shocked at him.
John cringed at not being able to remember which girlfriend was which. His eyes stayed firmly on the screen though, avoiding all the looks he knew the others would give him.
“It’s Irene isn’t it?” Anderson question, to which, John nodded with a sigh.
Laughter filled the room as they finally realised what the flashing lights had been. The laughter getting louder when John sunk into his chair, embarrassed.
"Why does
"You mean besides the freak," Donovan hisses, at the same time that John replies with;
Molly sighs sadly at Sherlock’s response to her arrival. Wondering why he always seemed to be annoyed with her.
Suscipicously, everyone but Mycroft and John suddenly had a sudden outburst of coughing.
"Did you ever tell Sherlock about that?" Molly asks, John frowns slightly trying to think back.
"You sound like a five year old," Mrs Hudson commented causing John to blush slightly and everyone else laughing slightly.
Kitty was frowning up at the tv, clearly thinking about something. Moriarty was quiet, though whether that was by choice or because everyone bar Kitty didn’t like him, Donovan had no way to tell. Lestrade and Molly were joking and laughing as they filled their plates, while Mycroft watched them quietly. The shadowy figure still had yet to move or speak, and Donovan quickly looked away, feeling creeped out. Beside her, Anderson was talking to Mrs Hudson about Sherlock. And beside her, John was… well he was glaring daggers at the now blank screen.
"He really needs to learn how to flirt," Anderson comments almost snidely, kinda like Mycroft. A couple people, mainly the men hum in agreement, cringing as the screen.
Everyone chuckles as Sherlock once again doesn’t notice John leaving. John shaking his head in amusement at his late best-friend.
"You're looking for a serial killer and you didn't bring your gun?" Lestrade chides, shaking his head at John.
"Because I knew he would, one way or the other," Mycroft states cryptically.
“I’m so confused,” Anderson admitted, frowning at the screen. “So what Sherlock and Henry saw, that wasn’t the dog?”
"There's more than one way to open a door without a key," Moriarty mused quietly. Though everyone heard. John glared over at him.
"Of course Doctor Mortimer was his therapist, he had a massive traumatic effect which impacted his later years," Mycroft couldn't quite help but point out. Much to John's and everyone else's annoyance.
"No, John and Sherlock were made for each other," Lestrade announces, sending a teasing look over to a blushing and annoyed looking John.
"Don't worry, he stopped doing it as much, he was probably just used to being by himself," John added, but not before a glare is thrown at Donovan.
"Hey Greg," John greeted, his eyes flickering between the other two newcomers but he doesn't bother greeting them.
A few people can’t help but feel pity for Molly, and her obvious crush on Sherlock, though they know better than to mention anything about it.
“Has Sherlock ever been in a relationship?” Molly questioned curiously.
"Given up John have you?" Lestrade chuckles sightly as John grumbles in annoyance.
"Of course the freak has a mental illness," Donovan muttered, once again causing everyone to glare at her and John's fingers to curl into a fist as he glares heatedly at the Sargent.
"Obviously," Mycroft drawled, because what else was it going to be.
“Why shouldn’t John go after Sherlock?” Molly questioned in confusion.
"Maybe we'll finally be able to find out how the freak texts everyone at once," Donovan announces and John glared heavily at her because of that annoying nickname she insists on using.
"Kinda of," John muttered.
“Why are you two talking?” Anderson questioned, suspicion in his voice.
Everyone’s eyes, except for Moriarty, turned murderous at the thought of Neilson torturing Mrs Hudson.
“Denial,” Donovan coughed under her breath, shooting a teasing look over at a pouting John.
"You heard Andy didn't you? Her work is her life, her family, plus she probably knows that no matter where she goes they'll find her so whats the point in running?" Molly replies to the more or less rhetorical question.
“Boys!” Mrs Hudson exclaimed, with a shake of her head. Mycroft rolls her eyes at her, kind of happy that no one noticed to yell at him.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"So that's what you were reading, I knew it was too long to just be 'wrong' but I couldn't see," Donovan muttered and Lestrade just shrugs.
“So fucking what!” John shouted, gaining everyone’s attention. “So what if they talk, because it’s true. Isn’t that what you want to hear? That I’m in love with my best friend?!” John had tears in his eyes as his voice cracked. His body trembled in anger and sadness as he glared at Donovan, and at everyone who tried to talk to him. “That poor John is in love with his dead best friend, despite the fact that even if Sherlock was alive, there would be no way in hell that he could feel the same,” John cried, the tears finally breaking free as he sobs.
"I thought Sherlock didn't use cigarettes," Molly questioned confused. "What about the patches?"
"Only because it was repeated over and over and over!" Anderson argued, "At least Sherlock figured it out on his own,"
"That's disappoiting,"
"That's Sherlock for you," He mused happily.
"What did he say?" Anderson asked, and anyone who didn't know German looked confused, which was everyone but Mycroft.
"Well, I didn't exactly know him, so yes..." John replied sheepishly.
"Wait, there actually are mines there?" Molly questioned in shock. Having thought that the minefields were just fake.
"Again, why does Sherlock cares? He's never cares about anyone else," Lestrade mutters causing Molly's check to go a slight pink and the corner of John's lips tug downwards at his comment.
"It's just what Sherlock does," John replied, "he almost always charges head first into danger without a second thought,"
"Even if he knew who you were, why would he help you?" Molly questioned in confusion.
"Because, his always nicer to you," John blushed at the words.
"Yes, yes it is," Mrs Hudson instantly replied.
Those who actually believed Sherlock, now including Donovan, hated seeing the usually strong and detached male so weak.
"The poor boy, to have his whole life ruined just so he could be kept quiet," Mrs Hudson muttered mourningful.
"You would assume that he only transmitted it when Henry was out there, so not a lot of people, if any, would have caught it," Mycroft explained.
Huffs filled the room as the therapist left. Hating that one of the few leads they had, just left.
"How could he already know that?" Lestrade exclaims in shock. Causing Donovan to snort.
In the middle of the worry, no one noticed Lestrade and John glaring at Doctor Frankland.
Mrs Hudson and Molly both gasped at the sight of three men with guns, their eyes flickering worriedly over to John. While the others tensed, frowning at the men.
“Is this really happening? Or is it just some weird dream?” Molly questioned curiously.
"How did you not notice that?" Anderson asks with amusement as he glances back at John.
Everyone smiles when Sherlock calls John his friend. Though both Molly and Lestrade huff slightly at not being called Sherlock’s friend.
"It's Sherlock, no one understands why or how he does anything," Lestrade answers.
"Fake," Donovan muttered under her breath in disgust.
"Or where they found it, or how much historic value or what metals are in it," Mycroft added.
I hope you all like my present to all of you, of updating early
"He only showed me one!" Lestrade snaps.
"John, I think you forgot something," Mycroft announced, amusement crinkling in his eyes.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Donovan spoke quietly when she was sure John had calmed some-what down. “I swear, I just meant it as a joke, if I had known it had any truth to it, I wouldn’t have said anything,” Donovan swore softly, feeling guilty as she stared helplessly at John.
"I don't think that was the best thing to say," Molly commented and Lestrade winces.
"And they say the English are polite!" Mycroft once again though this time his voice is slightly sharp.
A few people couldn't help but feel shocked that he had decided to blow himself up.
"When did he order a taxi?" Lestrade asks as the others try and remember when or why Sherlock had orderd a taxi.
"Because that's not creepy and stalkerish at all." Anderson muttered causing everyone the eldest Holmes Brother to chuckle.
“That just makes it creepier,” Donovan added with a cringe.
"Hey is that what this girl, Soo Lin saw at the start of this, memory?" Molly asks curiously. A couple people hum in response but no one bothers to respond probably.
Despite everyone being tense, a few still chuckled at John taking charge. Especially since he looked so proud of himself.
Laughs at Sherlock's words and his false cherriness, it really did look stupid if you truely know Sherlock.
"Mmh, why not compelte your bucket list," Mrs Hudson added. "Unless murder is on that bucket list, then don't,"
“I sometimes forgot how good Sherlock could actually play the violin,” John couldn’t help but comment.
"It's a machine John, it can't hear you," Lestrade muses, his eyes crinkling in amusement as everyone chuckles slightly.
"Who would look at the freaks website!" Donavan snapped.
“Does Sherlock not know your first name?” Donovan questioned in shock. Looking over at an annoyed Lestrade.
Molly sighs at her past self, wondering why she always tried so hard around Sherlock.
"What about John?" Molly asks curiously as she stares up at the screen.

"He had just got me arrested!" John defended himself though their was a ghost of a smile on his lips.
Everyone sighs before taking a seat. John sat in a chair that looked a lot like his armchair in the flat. Mrs Hudson sat next to John. Anderson and Donovan sat on the bean bags. Mycroft sat the closest to the shadowy figure, sitting with perfect posture. Both Lestrade and Molly claimed the couch. They all settled down as the black screen changed to reveal....
"Are you always the damsel in distress John?" Mycroft asks, almost teasingly, which has to be impossible and most likely imagined.
"I think I'm going to be sick," Kitty commented quietly, covering her mouth in horror. No one else seemed the slightest bit sick. Mostly because they had faced much worse or were just used to Sherlock's experiments by now.
"I thought it would be nice," John commented embrassed.
"What wife? I thought you were dating Sherlock," Mrs Hudson commented, turning to face John.
“I know this is probably a bad thing to say, but I’m glad you’re lying to him,” Molly commented. “He probably wouldn’t be able to handle the truth,” She added quietly.
"No," John replies.
"Sherlock dear, have some patience," Mrs Hudson mutters, her voice gravely and soft.
“What does she want?” Lestrade questions, glaring slightly at the woman.
"Does he do that often?" Anderson asks.
"Sherlock didn't know about
“I’m still curious as to why that matters,” Anderson mutters under his breath as he watches Sherlock curiously.
"I thought you two were together," Lestrade teases. John huffs shaking his head.
"The only body that my brother put, was his own," An awkward sad silence filled the room as they all turned to the screen.
day out of his head.
"And here I thought you had endless patience for your brother?" Molly questions, half joking half being serious.
“You, if I didn’t know any better, I would say that Sherlock is flustered,” Donovan spoke quietly, her eyes wide.
"Yes because the state of his suit is more important then your life," Lestrade commented dryly and John chuckled slightly.
"Of course he has, he-" Kitty snapped her jaw shut at the glare everyone sent her. She was even starting to get on Donavan's nerves!
"Doesn't Sherlock just say that about everything?" Donovan hissed in annoyed tone, though her curiousty did leech through just a bit.
"Shit," Lestrade commented, having forgotten there would be an explosion that day.
"If only I had looked at the writing," John murmed quietly, though almost everyone heard him if the confused looks thrown his way was anything to go by, not that John took any notice.
Despite himself, John snorts at Sherlock’s words, grinning slightly.
"Aren't you always?" Lestrade teases and Anderson huffs, but smiles a bitter sweet smile as he remembers what Sherlcok used to say.
"That doesn't mean you can just bring him to a crime scene,"
"Of course he didn't get anything wrong," Anderson muttered sarcastically, the fond look in his eyes, the only thing stopping John from talking.
"Didn't Jeff say that he had a fan before?" Anderson points out.

"Where did he get the uniform?" Kitty questions in shock.
“To see if he could tamper with it, which he can’t,” Mycroft answered.
"It's Sherlock," Anderson says as if that explains everything, which it kind of does.
A few people laugh at Gary being a snorer, especially with how he reacts to being outed.
"What did the wall ever do to him?" Anderson joked, causing everyone but the two male M's to laugh. Even Kitty smiled slightly.
"Who's that? Mrs Hudson asks.
"That's probably because they normally are," Anderson pointed out, Mycroft tuttered shaking his head slightly but not actually speaking.
A few people chuckled at the throwback to the very first case they worked together.
"I thought it was the taxi driver that killed all those people," Mrs Hudson commented.
“Wait, why is everything back to normal now?” Donovan questioned in confusion.
John reaches out to grab Mrs Hudson, hating that something bad happened to her.
"He's like a love sick puppy," Mrs Hudson agreed.
Everyone laughs at John's obliviousness. After all who else would it be but him?
"Who would be sick enough to sponser serial killers?" Lestrade asks appoled.
"But I thought we were just watching Sherlock's life?" Molly asked and everyone frowned.
A few people cringed at the words, sympathy filling them for the test subjects. While almost everyone wondered how someone could do that to another human.
"That's pretty impressive," Lestrade praised, causing John to smile slightly. Proud of his own abilities. Even if they did look terrible beside Sherlock.
Everyone hisses slightly at the sight of the laser at Sherlock, their eyes narrowing at Moriarty's next words.
"How the hell isn't he injured?" Lestrade questioned, shaking his head in wonder.
"Am I imagining things, or does Sherlock look a little anxious to you?" Donovan questions in shock, at seeing the 'Freak' show any emotion expect for confidance.
“Yeah, but half the time, it seemed like he purposely played off key to annoy one person or another,”
"Sally, if you insist on believing that my brother is a fraud, that maybe you should try and deduces John here," Mycroft announces, rather suddenly causing the black figure in the corner to shift slightly. Sally or Donovan glares at Mycroft but still she and the other Yarders lean forward.
Molly and Mrs Hudson sighs in relief as the two are safe.
Mrs Hudson sighed at Sherlock smiling, silently wondering how Sherlock managed to keep any clients when he treated them so harshly. Even if she technically knew the answer already.
Transcript: Arainedevere
While Sherlock making Irene beg might not have been so surprising, Irene actually doing it, was extremely fucking surprising.
A few people sighed at the mention that Sherlock might be in danger, well those who cared about Sherlock did.
Mrs Hudson sighs sadly at seeing Kate lying limp, having a feeling that there would be little chance that those Americans had left her alive.
"Only Sherlock?" Lestrade mutters causing everyone to nod their heads in agreement.
"Hey were are the little white words?!" Anderson exclaims. He had been looking forward to see Sherlock's thinking pattern again.
“Wow, who knew they could be so deadly,” Donovan joked slightly, though it was kind of ruined by the shock in her voice.
Transcript: Arainedevere
"What do expect, the freak to actually tell the truth," Donovan snarled, being her usual grumpy self.
A few people snorted at Sherlock adding 'Sir'. Their minds going back to when Sherlock corrected the prisoners' language back in 'The Great Game'.
"Not you to,"
"Who the hell is that? And what is she doing," Donovan's voice was raised, not shouting loud but defiently not normally talk, a little fear crepping into her voice.
"Well when you watch it like this then it is fairly obvious," Molly commented.
"It didn't hurt to try," John pointed out.
Lestrade frowns before turning to John, "The thing that was missing, was it by any chance a vase?"
"How did you know?" John's eyesbrows furrowed as he stared at Lestrade.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I kind of knew, but figured I would make sure Sherlock agreed, just in case." Lestrade explains.
Everyone, but Kitty and Moriarty glare at the Moriarty on the screen. Though the real Moriarty was smirking in amusement.
“Go Sherlock!” Anderson couldn’t help but cheer, pleasantly surprised that Sherlock could fight, even if it was dirty.
"Is that morse code?" Mycroft questioned, as it would make no sense if it was.
"He's a freak, who knows why he does anything." Donovan retorted. "Besides, you didn't really know him at all, if he managed to create all these cases."
think that me and Sherlock are dating?" John hissed in annoyance, causing everyone to chuckle.
"That's how you met Mycroft Holmes? That's so... dramatic!" Anderson asks and John shrugs as Mycrofts eyes narrow ever so slightly at him.
“You’ll see soon,” John grumbled.
Everyone’s frowns, turn into glares as Irene strokes Sherlock’s face like some sick reward.
The Yarders laugh at John, while said man blushes.
"Cause that's not totally creepy,"
"When did he do that?" Anderson questions in shock. Everyone shrugs, no one having an answer for him.
"He can be compassionate when it matters," Mrs. Hudson murmed and both her and John both smile slightly, espically John.
“Yep,” John responded, finally able to talk again.
“I see you’re finally using your brain,” Mycroft commented instead of answering.
"It only seemed to ring when I was near it, so I was curious,"
Everyone sighs, feeling sorry for Molly when Sherlock rounds on her, wondering why he could never seem to stop.
Transcript: Arainedevere
"Um, Soo Lin, she helped us with the case," John replied frowning slightly.
"What do you expect?" Mycroft questioned, sounding ever so slightly hurt.
"Only a freak like him would be so excited about deaths," Donovan muttered.
"He found that," John pointed out, defending his best friend.
"Why would you ever think she would keep dating you after that! I'm surpised she's not scarred for life!" Donovan yelled, John frowns but doesn't answer.
John flushes in embarrassment as a few people raise their eyebrows at him. Though no one can really be all that surprised that John flirted with the random girl. Especially after watching this.
"Easier and less boring?"
“What?” Donovan questioned curiously, her eyebrows furrowed together in confusion. While John and Molly both glare at her.
Molly frowns slightly as Donovan snorts in amusement. "The freaks just using you," Molly frown deepens at Donovan's words causing everyone, even Mycroft though he's his only small, to glare at the sargent.

--3rd P.O.V--
"There was a second smuggler," John cut in before Lestrade could answer.
"And now he's interested," John mutters under his breath with a sigh.
"Personally, I reckon it would be weird if they knew the difference." Anderson commented randomly, earning alot of weird looks. "I mean it's a tragidy that they didn't notice and ended up dying, but what weird things would they have to do to notice a real gun,"
"Who's Harry?" Anderson asks curiously.
Once again Kitty scrunched up her face in disgust, while John huffed in amusement.
"Because of Mycroft, he creeped me out, no offense" John replied, and Mycroft nodded ever so slightly.
"Nicotine patch," John answered.
"No kidding" Kitty mutters under her breath.
Anderson and Lestrade huffs that he managed to get away, though they were mostly angry at themselves for not believing in Sherlock sooner.
Despite the fact that Mycroft getting the alert was a bad idea, a few still chuckled at Mycroft's face.
"What's so important about a pair of missing shoes?" Kitty couldn't help but question.
"It's not like I had enough time to go inside and get it!" John exclaims.
"An old aquantince," John replied, anger dusting his voice.
"It's not," Was all John replied with.
Molly frowns over at the screen, was her crush on Sherlock really that obvious?
"How much luck do you have?" Anderson asks in shock, "On the first try you managed to find the sign, if that's not lucky I don't know what is,"
"Yeah, I was shocked too" John commented, amusement lacing his voice.
"Yes" Everyone that was there said almost instantly.
“What has he figured out?” Kitty questioned, finally speaking up. No one answered, as only one person even had an inkling of an idea as to why.
"Of course, his entry is dramatic and cool," Anderson comments, causing a couple people to chuckle.
"Well that's... unfortunate,"
A few people blinked in shock, not actually expecting that, though then they realised how petty Sherlock could be, and figured it wasn’t that surprising.
"No, he was just trying to freak him out," John replied in a monotone voice, causing all of Lestrade's hope to crush.
"Do you really think it's a good idea?" Molly questioned worriedly, glancing over at John.
Sighs of relief filled the room, as the alarm was finally switched off. Everyone slowly started to relax fully at the fact that they seemed to have gotten away with it.
"No shit," John muttered, still annoyed at him.
A couple people chuckling at Sherlock being so confused. Sometimes they could forget that some simple interactions slipped Sherlock’s mind.
"If they find what Eddie and Bran were smuggling and where the acution is they can back track and find out where their held," Lestrade responded.
Before anyone else could reply another flash of white and Molly appeared. The massive T.V. on the side of the wall turned on, to reveal a message written in white.
"Why am I not suprised," John mumbled as the Yarders grin over at him.
"What does he mean, 'It's where I began.'"
"Right," Anderson muttered to himself. Of course that was why.
"JOHN!" Molly can't help but yell, her eyes flickering back to John as if trying to reassure herself that John was safe.
"You know I was wondering, if what that word would be, I mean how can you threathen someone with only one word," Anderson commented, a couple people laugh quietly but in the end they all, even Mycroft had to agree.
Everyone who wasn't there blinked in shock, expect for Mycroft who jut shook his head at his younger brother.
“He has a funny way of showing it,” Kitty grumbled under her breath.
"It's Sherlock," Was the only reply.
“That was so confusing,” Lestrade muttered under his breath. Causing a couple of people to hum in agreement with him.
"You forgot your cane," Anderson, always pointing out the obivous.
“That’s actually a good idea,” Lestrade muses quietly to himself, and though almost everyone hears him, no one comments on it.
"And where's 'here' exactly?" John asked glancing around.
Mycroft hums in amusement as he watches his little brother.
“Were they actually in the room?” Mrs Hudson questions curiously, figuring that if it was that easy then they wouldn’t be watching it.
"Because I got drugged as well without anyone knowing it," Lestrade answers, semi happy he didn't get his voice taken away from him for answering it.
--3rd P.O.V.--
Transcript: Arainedevere
"Wrong way," Lestrade chuckles, and everyone laughs once again at Johns expense.
"What happened to the second one?" Molly asks curiously.
"He is!" He announced, but that was all anyone said before they got distracted.
“Me neither,” Donovan admitted.
"Does he really know the lottery numbers?" Anderson questioned in shock, frowning as he tried to figure it out.
"He was being strangled and worrying for his life at the same time!" Anderson snapped back. Donovan rolled her eyes but didn't bother arguing.
"That makes even less sense," Anderson muttered to himself.
“Hey!” Molly and John snapped in annoyance. The Yarders all glared at Mycroft, who at least had the common decency to look ashamed at his previous actions.
A few people stared at the screen in shock. Though the more they thought about it, the more it kind of made sense. Behind everyone, Moriarty smirked to himself.
"Wait, is he saying that Stapleton experimented on her daughter's rabbit?" Donovan finally guessed.
"Yeah, don't you just go straight to the crime scene, or where ever you need to go?" Donovan added with a sneer, glaring slightly.
"That sucks," Donovan murmured, knowing how terrible it was to find out that the guy you were with was cheating on you or using you to cheat with someone else.
"Why would Sherlock say something like that?" Lestrade asks causing the two other Yarders to go red, causing the Detective Inspector to frown.
"Well obviously," Donovan muttered sarcastically. She really didn't like supernatural stories made just to con people.
"How long are these going to take? Because I'm pretty sure people are going to notice us missing,"
"That's actually pretty clever, mean, but clever," Anderson mused, he wasn't really that surprised, but he still wanted to comment on it.
"Aww, his asking John," Molly awed, causing said doctor to blush.
"Are you flirting with her?" Lestrade asks in shock and John shrugs, suddenly finding his feet so interesting.
"Why would he tell her that?" Kitty questions.
"Why does she want to finish her work? Why not run an save her life?" Anderson wondered aloud, slightly glancing backwards just to see if they had an answer.
Everyone laughs as John groans, a few people smirking over at John. “She’s not wrong,”
"Anderson thought of it," Once again, Mrs Hudson responded immediantly and her words caused Anderson to shrink in his seat.
"Did he really think anyone would believe him? He literally just confessed to it," Lestrade pointed out.
"No, just missing,"
Nobody could resist chuckling at the fact that Mrs Hudson was more worried about Neilson landing on her bins then about Neilson.
“Bluebell was killed,” Lestrade pointed out, frowning over at the girl in shock.
"I don't think that's the point, Sherlock," Mrs Hudson sighs, but no one in the room is surprised that Sherlock focus on the case and not on the people dead.
A few people sighed, while the others leaned forward, interested to know how he managed to get out of it.
“Not that we know of,” Mrs Hudson replied. As John glowered in his seat, still kind of annoyed that he doesn’t know everything about Sherlock.
"Your just saying that because your in love with the freak," Donovan snaps back. Everyone glares at her.
“What is with Sherlock and sniffing things?” Donovan questioned, and to John’s surprise, there wasn’t any disgust in her tone, just simply curoursity.
Mycroft winces, feeling annoyed that the one time Sherlock decides to fall for a girl, it’s such a bad one.
"I wonder how many patches he used for 'The Great Games'" Anderson mused.
“I know,” John admitted after a few moments, feeling embarrassed as he struggled to stop crying.
"Is he proud over the fact that I know to ask Sherlock for help, or the fact that I actually would tell someone that?" Lestrade asks curiously.
“Oh, that actually makes so much sense,” Anderson commented, feeling slightly better as Sherlock finally explained what was happening.
"... You've got to be kidding me, he called you all the way there just to use your phone?" Lestrade asked.
"The decease's flatmate." John replies witha slight sigh.
"And why would anyone want the freak at their restraunt," Donovan muttered. Earning a slight glare from Anderson, who was the only one who heard.
"Not fully though," Anderson snickered, though there was no heat behind it.
“Why is Sherlock so… cherry?” Donovan questioned. The Sergeant not trying to be mean, just confused as to why the normally grumpy Sherlock was so happy.
A few people snort at Sherlock’s question, grinning slightly.
Molly, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson and Anderson all smile in relief when she sends Sherlock the text. Off in the corner, Mycroft sighs, feeling conflicted. On one hand he felt happy that his brother was no longer sad, but on the other he remembered how exactly this particular case ended.
"He does, everytime you speak," Mrs Hudson pointed out.
"Freaks," Donovan hissed under her breath.
Molly blushes in embrassement as she mutters an apology to John, the others chuckling slightly.
"I still don't see what's so important about those shoes," Kitty muttered, but everyone either ignored or glared. John barely stopping himself from snapping at her to get some patience.
A few people frowned, worried about Sherlock going off on his own after what happened last time, and well, every time they’ve seen anyone go into the Moor.
Sadness filled the room at the mention of people’s lives being in danger because it, more than one person wishing that she would get the hell away.
"It's offical, she's creepy," Donovan couldn't help but comment.
“Is that clever or dumb?,” Lestrade mused to himself.
Molly finds tears in her eyes as she stares at the scene in front of her, shuffling slightly into Mrs Hudson's embrace.
“What is he up to?” Lestrade questioned curiously, leaning forward.
They all watch as the screen turns black, after another case had closed. John got up and got some tea for himself and Mrs. Hudson, while the Yarders all got some food. After everyone had sat back down words once again appeared on the screen.
"I can't believe she actually still talks to you, I know I said it before but still!" Anderso cried. The other Yorkers nod in agreement while Kitty frowns in confusion. Not having been there for the Blind Banker.
A lot of people started panicking as they saw John panicking. Seeing the usually collected doctor freaking out just made everything even worse.
John blinked as the white vanished, revealing a cosy looking room. To one side there was a table lining the wall, snacks all piled across it. Directly across from the table of foods was a giant TV, like the ones in the cinemas. Between the TV and Table where different seats. From bean bags to rolly chairs all of the seats looked like they had been quickly just thrown in the room. But besides that, there was no other furniture in the room. Though there was a strange looking figure sitting in an armchair in the corner. The figure was clad in black, and even the shadows themselves seemed to be wrapped around the figure. John frowned at him before his eyes were drawn elsewhere. Three figures emerged out of nowhere, the same white light enveloped them. When the light left, it revealed, Inspector Lestrade, Donovan and Anderson.
"That's actually pretty clever," Donovan mused, wishing she had thought of something like that whenever she needed to come up with a name for something.
"Just a little bit dramatic?" Donovan muttered sarcastically, rolling her eyes at the screen. Not believing that something supernatural was at play for a second.
"Thank god she's safe," Molly murmured. The other's couldn't help but agree, even if they knew that she would be safe, it was still a relief to see her being saved.
"This is why you don't make fun of people," John grumbled in annoyance.
Molly and Mrs Hudson huffs in sadness when they notice the grimace. How could anyone be that mean to their own brother?
"How the hell can he just tell that?" Donovan questions, needing to put words to her confusion.
"WHAT!?!?!" Everyone, even Mycroft, though he was quieter yelled. John chuckling slightly.
Kitty frowned as she realised that it really had been a hallucination. Doubts began to actually form in her mind, after all why would Sherlock see an image of Moriarty, if it had all been fake.
"That poor girl," Mrs Hudson murmurs.
More than one person winced as Mycroft turns on his brother.
"Maybe because we are watching it on a screen, while John had to actually live it and focus on other stuff, like not getting caught," Anderson responded just as snidely, glaring over at Kitty.
Most people snicker (why is Mycroft so 'refrianed but Sherlock's not?) at Sherlock.... being... well... Sherlock.
As she felt the pitying looks of others, Mrs Hudson resolutely stared at the screen, ignoring everyone. Except for when John squeezed her hand.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"What's going on? I thought we were here to watch Sherlock's life not this," Anderson comments. John shuffles slightly in his seat.
"He's learning," Anderson fake gasps, to everyones amusement.
"I'm suprised that my brother hasn't figured it out, so simple," Mycroft tuts, causing everyone else to roll their eyes at him.
The yarders and Molly laugh, not that they doubted Sherlock, expect maybe for Donovan, they just found it ridiculous.
“You know, if you keep glaring at the screen like that, people will talk,” Donovan joked slightly, finally causing John to look away at the screen and at Donovan.
"Why is he so afraid of that tiny dog?" Kitty questioned in shock, frowning down at the boy.
Their glares intensified at Irene’s words, while luckily, or unlucky depending on how you see it, no one noticed the smirk on Moriarty’s lips.
"You," John growled, lunging out of his seat, his hands curled into fists, aimed right at Moriarty's face. But before he can even get close, he hits something an bounces back, landing on his ass.
Everyone laughs at John’s expense who tries to be mad, but finds himself smiling slightly anyway.
“Holy,” Mrs. Hudson breathed, not expecting that in the slightest. Almost everyone staring wide eyed at the screen in shock.
"He didn't deny it," Anderson murmured, pointing at the screen causing his colleagues and Molly to start laughing.
"And if he had just called the police or something, he would have gotten a much lesser sentence," Lestrade murmurs.
“Wow, she’s actually pretty close,” Kitty commented snidely, much to everyone’s hatred.
The Yarders and Molly chuckle at Mrs Hudson's implication, while John's cheeks are dusted pink.
"What happened to not taking dating advice from Sherlock?" Lestrade teased, struggling not to laugh.
"Yep, almost all the time,"
The group, expect for Mycroft and Moriarty all wince as they see the old woman. Espically those who now how this ends.
"Of course he knows how to drive," Mycroft chided.
Mycroft winces as he watches his brother give away those plans.
"You know, I don't think I've ever seen Sherlock ask for someone else's deductions," Anderson muses. No one answers him because no one has to. John has always been the expection for Sherlock.
“Why did you count the texts?” Anderson questioned curiously, an almost teasing note to his voice. “Jealous?”
Lestrade winces that he hadn't even noticed anything wrong with Sherlock. He had thought he knew the late Holmes better.
The three police officers huff at the blatant crime commited in front of them. Even if none of them were very surprised.
"The wrong kind," John replied, though his words were harsh his tone was soft, a slight smile curving his lips.
“She doesn’t work for me,” Mycroft stated with a frown, causing everyone to frown as well. Worried for the doctor.
"How does he always get what he wants?" Anderson asks curiously, no spite laced his words, just harmless curiousty.
"That would be highly unlikely, winning the lottery would be more likely with all things considered." Mycroft instantly shots her idea down.
“Why isn’t Sherlock picking up?” Lestrade questioned in fear, his mind instantly jumping to the worst possible outcomes.
"Freak!" Donovan muttered.
A couple people snort at John’s suggestions, shaking their heads at his antics.
"Wow, someone else who doesn't care about Sherlock's weird outbursts," Donovan mused, though unlike before, there was no bitterness or disgust in her voice.
A few people glare at Irene as they realise that she had broken into Sherlock's room, and was now in the same room with him still practically asleep.
"NOOOOO!!!!" The more compasionate, people watching all scream out in shock, besides for John, who was there.
"Wow," Donovan whispered, shocked that they actually had anything that was decent proof. Not that she believed them of course.
"Whose Jeff?" Molly asks, whilst the others, not including Mycroft, nod in agreement.
A few people roll their eyes at Fletcher putting on a mask, proving to them that this was just a hoax.
A few people snorted in amusement at Barrymore thinking that Sherlock was into conspiracies. Which made no sense and yet seeing Sherlock as a conspiracy person somehow made sense at the same time.
A few people gasped surprised again at suddenly seeing them at the crime scene, before figuring it was the same as before.
"As long he's interested," John added in amusement.
"How on earth could you possibly do that?" Anderson asked causing Mycroft to chuckle.
"Oh god," Molly whispers horrifed, or at least sad like the nice person she is.
"No," John muttered in embarrassment.
A few, mostly Donovan and Anderson sigh in relief that the horror movie type part was over. Even if they both knew that it would show up again eventually.
“That’s because I have,” She answered, blushing, but didn’t bother to elaborate.
"Something tells me staying up all night looking at books isn't a good thing to do," Lestrade jokes and John shuffles in his seat awkwardly.
“I didn’t think he would have kept them all,” Anderson muttered quietly to himself as Sherlock started scrolling through all the texts.
"You seem to forget that Sherlock has a habit of picking people's ID's," John commented in answer.
"Do you think ge got it right?" Molly asked, almost wistfully. No one answered her, for no one, not even Mycroft knew the answer.
A couple people flinch at the sound of the arrow being realised, and espically Mrs Hudson and Molly gasp.
John  snorted at that, but a soft smile creeps onto his lips as he watched the scene unfold remembering his confusion back then.
"John!" Lestrade hissed, shaking his head at the male. "Never go off on your own, that's like horror movie 101,"
Mrs Hudson, John and Molly all glare at Sebastian along with Lestrade and even Anderson. While Donovan smirked.
"A professional, someone who has their work in the actually gallery," Molly listed off.
“Sherlock has been miserable thinking she was dead, why wouldn’t I want Sherlock to know that she was alive?” John snapped back at her.
"Your a freak as well!" Donovan screeches, pointing her look of disgust at John who in turns just rolls his eyes.
"Wait, does she think-?" Anderson trails of as he notices the look on John's face, after a few seconds of silence, everyone but Mycroft bursts out laughing, they just couldn't help it. None of them notice the screen pausing as until they had managed to finish laughing, or at least get their laughter under control.
They all sigh in relief as they see the young man being saved.
"Who's Sebastian Wilkes?" Donovan asks, disgust in her voice.
“But you’re not fine, you just went through a traumatic ordeal?” Molly questioned in shock.
Everyone laughs at Sherlock wanting to be a pirate. “I can’t not imagine Sherlock on a boat,” Anderson can’t help but comment through his laughter.
"Sherlock wasn't a fraud, was he?" Donovan questioned, her voice barely a whisper.
"Oh Sherlock," Mrs Hudson murmured in disappointment.
They all sighed in relief. The boy was going to be okay.
"You know, I only just realised something," Anderson trails off, causing everyone to look at him curiously. "He's grooming John to become a dective,"
"Sherlock's rubbing off on you," Molly spoke, grinning slightly. "You're getter more observant,"
“Couldn’t you have helped Mrs Hudson upstairs as well?” Lestrade questions, though he had a feeling he knew the real reason why Sherlock wanted them downstairs.
