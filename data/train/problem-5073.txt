Steve tilted his head, his expression pitying. “I do love you.” His thumb came to rest of Tony’s bottom lip, pressing and dragging it down. Blood welled up around his digit and he smeared it across Tony’s mouth, leaving it vividly red in contrast to Tony’s pale face. “The other stuff was a lie but we were real. It’s still real. We can still be together.”
“The serum? But why!” Steve asked. He turned, trying to keep Tony in his line of vision. Not trusting the other man unless he could see him. Not that it would do Steve much good. “Are you planning on selling that too?”
For a moment, Steve thought he was falling through time again. His heart had stopped, ridden high in his throat. “What.” He managed to croak out, taking an involuntary step forward.
Peter suddenly wished he’d thought to use felt tips, the red colour was much better for Iron man than his crayon had been. He frowned angrily down at his page. “I’ve done it wrong.” He muttered.
“You’re in love,” Steve said. “You and Steve were together. You want to save him, to get back the man you knew.”
Steve laughed and then he had shot across the room, a bullet of movement aimed at Tony. He grabbed Tony by the throat, dragging him upright as easily as a doll and slammed him into the wall. Tony heaved, straining to breathe.
Tony was still lost in his head as his mother floated towards him. She tapped him on his arm and urged him to sit up straight, exactly as she always did when they were at home. Tony swallowed compulsively as he let himself be manoeuvred to her satisfaction, feeling distant to the warning tutting she let loose. His mother’s hand went to his shoulder. Her nails were sharp, even though the material of gloves, pinning him in place.
“I don’t know.” Steve groaned and tilted his head to face his attacker. A small, dark-haired figure was stood off to one side, holding a branch between them cautiously. At Steve’s recovery, he jumped back, stick raised aloft warningly.
“It’s not what you think,” Steve took a step forward, dodging another glass hurtled towards him. “Stop throwing things at me!”
“I know. He has special nightmares, sometimes they carry on for a little bit when’s he’s awake. He didn’t know what was happening. It was just an accident.” Daddy placed him on the kitchen counter and got a paper towel to mop up his face. Peter grabbed an extra square and twisted it between his hands.
He shouldn’t be doing this, Tony obviously thought he was someone else. The thought was cold water over Steve’s increasingly heated head. He made a small noise of protest and detangled them, pulling himself out of Tony’s arms. The other man breathed as they parted, his lips were already started to swell, red and parted invitingly. He was looking up at Steve and Steve’s heart clenched at the obvious affection in his expression. It was so open, so raw.
“Only one has come up.” Maria murmured, her nail taping one particular sore patch of skin. She sounded disappointed. Tony flinched at the contact, twisting his head to see the hard, raised hive spreading across his back.
Steve blinked, not expecting that reply. “I’ll come back after I’ve taken Tony to Stark resilient.” He offered gently.
Tony remembered waking up in his bed, his mother leaning over him, her eyes still full of tears. The covers had been drawn around him tight, heavy winter duvets overlaid with blankets despite the hot summer day and he squirmed uncomfortably.
Focused on the task at hand, Steve started to search the room, hoping he would stumble across some medical equipment. He was in a bedroom, built sleek and neat and impersonal - a style that was distinctly SHIELD. A few personal items were scattered across the room, spread and mixed in a way that suggested that the room belonged to two people, a couple. Steve ran his fingers across a small stack of books, his eyes drawn to the picture frames that sat next to the bed. He inhaled sharply as he realised who the room belonged to.
Steve had felt Tony’s absence like the loss of a limb; he caught himself reaching for a man who wasn’t there, talking to empty air. Every moment he was reminded of Tony’s loss was like being sucker-punched in the gut, it was like being betrayed all over again. Steve had never felt grief; rage like it.
Instead, he flew, invisible hands dragging him up, wrenching him from the ground. The sudden movement jolted him from his sleep, his body automatically fighting as he struggled to understand what was happening. Around him, the world was blurring, dissolving,
“Increasing reports of suicides indicate that many cannot afford extremis, nor can they bear to live without it.”
Steve entered the lab slowly, each step carefully decided upon and stolen like a dancer entering a stage. “Hey, Tony.”
Most of the liquid had ended up down Tony’s shirt, and the rest he’d vomited up minutes later, making a mess of the carpet. Howard had hit him for that. The blow sending him to the floor, squelching in his own vomit. Tony thought his father would hit him again but Maria had been there, scooping him up and shouting at Howard as they fled, tears in her eyes and her hands shaking.
Peter could only see his Daddy’s face from his position at the door. Papa’s back was to him, the muscles near his spine bunching and heaving as he gasped. It seemed like he couldn’t breathe properly. For a moment he started to release the other man, his fingers flexing tight before dropping away from Daddy’s upper arms.
“It’s just the doctor, sweetie.” The nurse holding him still said, her tired eyes and fading, peeling lipstick wavering into his line of vision. She had been using the same voice all morning, an affected coo that grown-ups used when they were uncomfortable with children. It didn’t fool Tony for one second, there was a warning firmness to her hands, a disinterest in her face that threatened to verge into irritation. Tony went limp in submission, not wanting to annoy the only familiar face in the room, no matter how unwelcoming she might be.
“No,” Steve said slowly. A memory slipped like mist through his straining mind; an itch just out of reach. He grimaced, a flash of certainty coming to him. “Tony wouldn’t destroy the Register.”
“Peter?” strong arms came and wrapped around, rocking him back and forth until Peter found himself sniffling weakly. “Sweetie what’s wrong, I can’t help unless you talk to me.”
“I don’t understand,” Steve said, voice raising from familiar betrayal. This wasn’t the real Tony he reminded himself, this as Wanda, a spell. He tried to reason with Tony, to bring out the real man.  “You said you were friends. What you’re doing with extremis, with the serum – he’d hate that. You will hurt him.”
“I hate that I hurt you,” The arm holding Peter shifted and moved upwards until it came to rest hesitantly on the awful bruise across his Daddy’s face. Peter’s breath hitched and from the movement of Papa’s chest beneath him he realised he wasn’t the only one who scared. Papa’s thumb rubbed at the bruise as if it was pencil mark and he was trying to erase it.
Steve shook his head, “That isn’t true. We were Avengers together before, we were good together. We can help each other be better.”
He shot to his feet, nearly careering into a wall. He threw out his hands, catching himself at the last moment. Pain shot through him, ripping down and through his torso at the impact. Steve groaned, sweat breaking out across his skin as he struggled not to collapse, to give into the pain. He reached down gingerly to his skin, his fingers coming back wet.
The worry that it might happen again kept him awake at night, he lay rigid in his bed, straining to hear any bad noises, but he never heard anything. Peter wondered how long it would be before Daddy left Papa. He wondered who he would have to live with.
Tony met Steve’s gaze steadily, the moment stretching out between them. His face was turned up slightly, his eyes huge in his golden, perfect face. For a moment Steve thought Tony wavered, that Steve’s word had got through to him. That Tony was going to take Steve’s hand.
Steve wavered. Those bits at least were true. The differences in Tony’s face were undeniable, unquestionable. But time travel?  “
“I know.” Steve opened his eyes, he stroked Tony’s face. “But I’ve only just found you. I just figured out how I feel. And now I have to go back to being without you? To fighting you? How am I meant to do that when all I want to do is kiss you?”
Steve turned back to the TV, seeking a distraction. It was easy to flick the channel over, to find the news station from that morning. The morning news crew from had been replaced by a different pair of cookie cutter presenters, they were eerily similar to their earlier counterparts, with big hair and stapled on smiles. The volume had been turned off and the hosts mouthed soundlessly at Steve.
Peter felt his tears reside as he took in this new information. It hadn’t looked like Papa was asleep. He said as much and Daddy nodded understandingly.
Steve reeled Tony in towards him, gripping the man’s clothing tight. Tony hung limply from Steve’s fists, tilting his head up towards him, eyes watching him from under the heavy inky sweep of his lashes. Steve swallowed. “If you don’t stop extremis, I will stop you.”
His mother’s musical voice brought Tony back to reality and he opened to his eyes as she swept him into the room.
Steve faltered. The small white room didn’t look like a jail cell, and yet Steve had assumed it was a cage, just a pretty one. After all, Steve was a criminal, an attempted murderer. It didn’t make sense that he wasn’t being confined. Especially if he was in one of Tony’s houses.  Not daring to protest, Steve reached for the door. Despite F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s assurances, he was surprised when it opened.
Steve’s blush had spread to a full-face glow, he put his face into his hands for a moment, shoulders moving with embarrassed laughter before turning back to Tony. “Anyway! Pancakes?”
“My daddy used to hit my mommy. He would hit her really bad, sometimes until she couldn’t get up off the floor. She used to cry a lot.” Amy trailed off and Peter watched her sadly as her eyes went wet and red. “She said we couldn’t live with him anymore because he was hurting her and no one should hit anyone else, no matter what.”
Tony glanced down at the picture on his father’s desk, rubbing the film of dust from the glass frame. His mother’s beautiful face stared blankly at him. She was a slender, wisp of a woman; her eyebrows curled up slightly giving her a permeant expression of worry. Next to Howard’s imposing bulk, she looked fragile, a glass person balancing in high heels. Tony remembered the bottles of prescription drugs he had emptied from her room after she had died and the stab of guilt he’d felt as he had stared at the names of the drugs, trying to pinpoint what each pill was for. Trying to guess which ones she really needed.
Steve smiled back at him and then glanced down, realising for the first time since he got here that he was still in pyjamas and slippers. He coughed awkwardly, toes wiggling against the cold floor. “There might be a few things I need first.”
“Shit...” the AI’s voice was a whisper behind him. He hurried forward, his hand going uselessly through Steve’s shoulder. A flutter of electricity crackled over Steve’s skin, making the hairs stand on end across the back of his neck.
Tony tried to say as his knees crumpled beneath him. Steve called his name, catching him before he could hit the ground. Tony’s head lolled, dizzy with pain and he found himself cradled, neck resting in the crook of Steve’ elbow. Steve’s other hand was pressed against his stomach, holding the blade in place. It was burning now, a deep, painful ripping, and Tony could smell the metallic scent of his blood, feel it seeping through the thin layer of his t-shirt.
They sat quietly for a few moments, Steve struggling with a question that had been lingering in his mind since he had seen the future where he and Tony were together. Across the room, a machine beeped, making them both jumped.
“Does it hurt?” his mother asked softly, her eyes still focused on the lump as Tony tried to meet her gaze. Tony looked away.
Like a rocket, Steve threw himself sideways. His fist caught the passenger straight in the face, cold-cocking him. The man was unconscious before he had time to scream, tumbling limply to the floor. Pain flared up across Steve’s torso at the suddenness of the movement, tearing through his torso. He stumbled in shock, only just managing to dodge a fist aimed at his back.
Tony forced himself upright, the spike and drop of adrenaline had left his muscles weak and shaky and he edged gingerly across the room, limbs aching and unsteady. He was bone tired, exhaustion heavy in every cell of his body. Pain throbbed behind eyes that were suddenly sensitive to the artificial lights.
Ever since he had built it, it had been a safe space, a fortress disguised as a workplace. He ordered Jarvis to lock it down as he scrambled inside, curling up into the far corner of the room. Sandwiched between two concrete walls, he let the tremors run their way through him, an earthquake over and under his skin.
Steve blushed embarrassed. He wasn’t sure in real time how long he had been jumping through time. Maybe hours, maybe days. He had just been surviving, reacting as best he could to each new situation and trying to stop himself bleeding out. He hadn’t had time to think about hunger or thirst. But now that the food was offered, it was all he could think about.
“I surprised you this morning and the other week, I pushed to go into Howard’s office. I’m sorry. It probably brought back some memories.”
Peter froze as the voices reached him, his muscles locked and his ears strained trying to figure out where the sound was coming from.
He took the food from Tony without complaint; halfway through the burger before Tony had even settled on the bed next to him. If he hadn’t of been so engrossed in his food, he would have noticed that was Tony was settling in gently next to him, shoulder to shoulder.
His mother had reminded him before they had arrived that the doctor needed to understand that he was sick, but Tony was bored, restless. He sighed, fighting against the urge to swing his legs back and forth knowing that it wasn’t what sick people did. He looked down at his knees instead, pressing his thumb into the joint. His legs were pale branches, knees swollen and straining through thin skin and his thumb left a white mark that lingered like a stain, fading as blood sluggishly crept back through his flesh.
“I said fuck off.” The other man snarled in reply, he forced his way forward, knocking the beggar off his feet. “Fucking drunks and druggies.” The man hissed disappearing back into the street.
Energised by a surge of annoyance, Steve pushed himself upright. Pain jarred down his torso, icy fingers tearing into his flesh. Steve gasped in surprise, clamping his hand down across the source of the pain. His side was heavily bandaged, packed with gauze. At the touch of his fingers, something rippled under his hand, a monster beneath the surface. Steve jumped in surprise, snatching his hand away. “What was that!” He shouted into the empty room.
Tony hummed in agreement; out the corner of his eye, he could see Steve striding towards them, towards Tony. Even from a distance away, Tony recognised the hard, flat set of his mouth. Ignoring the instinctive urge to fly off and away, Tony turned away as Steve’s approached. He came to a stop next to Clint and let the armour peel away from him, stepping down onto the tarmac.
Tony found himself staring at his mother’s delicate hand, fingers itching as he remembered the silky, slippery fabric of her gloves. The gloves, his mother had explained completed her ‘look’. Tony wasn’t exactly sure what that meant but he had figured it was mostly about other people looking at his mother. A lot of people looked at his mother, and they all said that she was a beautiful, kind, flawless woman. And yet, Tony found himself thinking of the cigarette burns and the hidden blisters under her gloves. The sores that she popped and picked until they swelled, red and angry.
Sharon was fighting her way through the crowd, battling a surging tide as she called his name. Steve tried to shout out to her, to tell her about the sniper but his throat was a mess; skin desperately knitting back to together but not fast enough. Sharon threw herself down next to him, arms shielding him from the stampede of people around them. Steve looked up, wanting to smile, to reassure her that he was going to be fine. He could already feel himself mending. He would be fine.
The figure on the screen bent down, his face swimming into focus as he leaned close to the pod. Steve blinked in confusion. It was his own face. He recognised the clenched, sharp lines of his own jaw, his way his pale eyebrows drew up tight in frustration. It was expression Steve had seen on his own face a hundred times. The other Steve’s eyes were bright, so excited they were almost reflective as he peered into the glass of Tony’s pod. His mouth quirked, a strange twist pulling at his lips. A sneer.
Tony pulled his t-shirt on gingerly, his back stung at the touch of the material but he didn’t care, he felt exposed, vulnerable and his shirt offered protection if only a little.
Steve couldn’t help but think how easy it could have been for the Hydra Supreme to get Tony on his side, how primed Tony was to trust, to believe Steve. How easily he followed.
Steve twisted, the sharp movement sending a faint warning twinge running up his side. Tony had changed, clothed himself in something tightly fitted and dark. It covered him up to the neck and yet it seemed somehow indecent, clinging to every curve and muscle the man owned. It seemed to Steve that every outfit this Tony wore was vaguely indecent.
Steve gasped and forced himself upright, his feet unsteady beneath him. He held his side, feeling like he was holding his guts in. He could feel the nanobots squirming, desperately trying to repair the damage. Tony had wandered lazily to the opposite side of the room and was bent over, rummaging through a cupboard. When he turned back towards Steve, he was holding a glass filled with familiar dark amber liquid.
Tony nodded, accepting this explanation easily. He let the stick fall limply to his side. Steve sighed in relief, the last thing he needed was another Tony trying to fight him.
Tony undressed, feeling himself fade away as she examined him. Her heels tapped against the floor, her breath fast, excited on his skin as she leant in closer.
The sun was heavy in the sky, swollen like an overripe orange. The heat of it made the air syrup-liquid, chokingly thick as Steve took a huge shuddering breath, eyes snapping open and closing shut as they looked directly into the sun. For a moment he thought he heard a voice, calling out his name but his hearing settled, revealing only the loud lazy chirping of crickets. On either side of him was a long, empty highway. The air was shimmering from the heat, making it appear as the road was moving, rippling like water. The sun had baked the tarmac, leaving it bubbling, burning his skin through his suit.
“Please stay here.” Tony tied, looking up at Steve beseechingly through dark lashes, “You’ve done more than enough.”
“Stark.” Steve breathed. He remembered the Tony from the early days of the Avengers, the child-charmer. Then the Tony he left beaten and bleeding, braced for a killing blow. And then another Tony with red eyes, and a predator’s grin. If this child was Tony, it meant that the red-eyed Tony hadn’t been lying. Steve was jumping through time. First into the future and now into the past.
The man smiled without amusement. “Well now you’re going to tell us where he went and if you don’t, things are about to get real unpleasant for you.”
Laughter filtered uneasily through the group. One of silent hired muscle flicked a brief look towards to the scrawny passenger. The look only lasted a second, such a small movement that most would have missed it.
The coffee mug was warm even after the liquid was gone and Tony cupped the mug in his numb fingers, still swallowing compulsively. Even after the pills had gone he could taste them on his tongue, feel them sticking in his throat.
Steve breathed slowly, pain clenching through him angrily. He gave the Tony is arms one last longing look. “I will fix things.” He promised, the words fading as he was dragged away once more.
The Hydra Supreme loosened around Tony’s neck and Tony sucked in a huge, desperate breath, coughs wracking his weak body. Steve smiled and shoved his hand into Tony’s hair, fisting it and dragging the man’s head up, exposing his neck. His other hand curled around Tony’s hip, thumb resting in the dip next to the ridge of Tony’s hipbone.
Steve realised as he spoke, he was telling truth. He did need Tony. He wanted Tony. He remembered the days after Tony had recovered his company as some of the best times Steve had had in the Avengers and at least half of that was down to Tony, to sharing the experience with this man. Tony had been a good superhero. He had been a good friend. He had been Steve’s best friend.
“The fuck!” He’s gone!” snarled a voice. “How are we meant to negotiate a ransom without something to ransom!”
“Please just a little change? Anything” One man was asking, he was hunched in on himself, hands held out beggingly.
“I’m going to be strong when I grow up. I’m going to be like you and Captain America. Then no one will ever be able to hurt me again.” Tony told him, fidgeting. Steve’s chest hurt as he listened. “And then I can help other kids too.”
“Well, you’re turning out to be a huge disappointment. It seems only fair I do too.” Tony jeered darkly, raising his glass.
“I haven’t heard that in a while,” Steve said with a smile. He had learnt that his and Tony’s relationship at any given moment could be understood in the way they addressed each other; a thousand complicated, fluctuating feelings contained within a single word. Winghead was a good sign.
Peter darted towards the kitchen and towards the sound of the shouting. His Papa’s voice echoed through the corridor as he got closer.
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but you’re not the most open about your feelings.” Tony replied, and then winced, “Except when you’re the Supreme Leader of Hydra apparently. Then you don’t shut the fuck up.”
Tony pushed his mug away; the movement made the coffee slosh over the rim of the cup and flood across the counter. Tony cursed, shooting to his feet but then hesitated as he stared at the spilled coffee; suddenly unsure what do to. He could feel Steve watching him silently, eyebrows curling up in worry. Tony knew that he was acting oddly and a strange thrum of nervous energy started to crawl through his limbs, lightning running across his muscles.
Every jump seemed to weaken the nanobots just a little more, break down his body that tiny bit further. He was bleeding again, a small, sluggish amount but even that would kill him eventually. He didn’t know how much more of this he could take. Steve pressed down hard, applying pressure to the wound. He glanced around, a memory lingering at the dusty edges of his mind; of Tony waiting for, bathed in light. Steve shook his, trying to clear as if he was shaking off dust. It wasn’t he place to be thinking about strange, fever induced dreams, he needed to figure out where he was. Even more urgently he needed to stop the bleeding of his strange bullet wound.
“You should have gone for a ‘kiss the chef’ apron,” Tony told him and they grinned at each other, a delicate rose pink blush seeping across the tops of Steve’s cheekbones.
“Mama, please.” He whispered, her vision blurring. Maria looked up, her irises had been swallowed by her pupils, leaving her eyes strange, polished obsidian. She smiled but her nail was still pressing hard into his skin, it hurt more than the entire scratch test had done.
In the centre of the bed was Tony. He was lying face down, his body serpentine and golden as it twisted across the dark sheets. His back was naked, exposed to the room and Steve tried not to think about why he could recognise Tony just from the deep line that cut down the centre of his bare back. Tony wasn’t alone. His face was pressed into the naked breasts of a slender woman and there was a man, tall and blonde curled on his other side. One of the man’s muscular arms was thrown possessively across Tony’s back, fingers moving lazily against Tony’s skin in his sleep.
Maria swung her gaze to Tony. Her tears were gone and her eyes were bright, fevered. Tony folded himself into the bed, empty stomach clenching.
Steve pressed the button as instructed, and they both breathed a sigh of relief as his captain America uniform reappeared.
Maria was still smiling, calm and content as she walked the doctor to the door. “Thank you so much. It’s so nice to have a doctor who knows what they are doing.”
Tony shook his head, brushing off his wild imagination and threw his legs over the side of the bed, knees cracking at the movement. It was breakfast time. The rest of the Avengers would be eating and gossiping in the kitchen and Tony forced himself to go find them, to be with people so he would have to pretend that he didn’t have the urge to claw off his own skin.
“Now, now Mrs. Stark.” The doctor said soothingly, patting her hand. Tony could see that unlike before, the reassurance didn’t please his mother. Her smile was pinched, frozen and uncomfortable on her face. “Tony seems like a perfectly healthy young boy. Children get colds all the time and plenty are picky eaters. He will probably grow out of it.”
He ran his finger over the little figures nervously, “My daddies are holding hands. Are they not meant to?”
Maria let loose a sigh of relief, sending the young doctor a warm, pleased smile that knocked out a strange involuntary noise from him. “I’m so relieved to hear you say that, Jonathan. I think it might be a food allergy, Anthony’s such a picky eater and this all started with stomach aches. Didn’t it, Tesoro?”
Steve couldn’t breathe. It was if his asthma had returned, stealing the life for him. He could almost feel the puzzle pieces falling into place. The oddities of his and Tony’s relationship suddenly coming into focus. Steve had taken the needling, the joking from the other Avengers for years, brushing off the ‘mom and dad’ nicknames. He had told himself it was a future thing, that the 21st century just wasn’t used to affect between male friends. But for the first time, he truly understood. It was as if the scales had fallen from his eyes.
“Just…I know most of this is my fault. That I kept things from you; secrets that nearly broke us. I know San Francisco is still fresh, even if we don’t talk about it.” Tony made a sound of frustration, pausing in his pacing to turning to face Steve. “But I’m trying, really trying here Steve. I thought you were too.”
Everette blushed and stuttered a reply. He didn’t acknowledge Tony before he left. Tony was glad, he realised dimly that he didn’t care much for Doctor Everette.
“Yeah maybe…” Tony mumbled, wincing as he remembered his reaction to that photography. He had forgotten that had even happened, still couldn’t quite remember why he’d been in the hospital or when the picture had been taken. When he tried to remember, he felt like he wanted to vomit or like he wanted to hide, to run and never stop. His memories scratched at the back of his mind, a monster hiding out of sight in a child’s closet.
“ – well I couldn’t see anything.” The doctor was saying. He stood up and walked away from Tony. There was a mumble of responses from the other nurses, fading as they washed up.
Tony slapped him away, his hand striking Steve’s with enough force to make his own skin sting. He threw himself backward, lips curling into a snarl. His legs moved without his consent until was pressed against the fridge, the bones in his back stinging from how hard he slammed into the chrome door. The tremors in his hands had grown into full blow shakes and he was aware he was all but vibrating, coming apart with his teeth bared. A feral dog cornered.
For a while after that Tony thought maybe his father would grow to like him. Whereas before Howard preferred to not hear or see Tony, now he demanded his son’s presence in random prolonged bursts. Tony was given more circuit boards, mathematics questions, logic puzzles. And Tony consumed everything his father put in front of him, hungry from the sudden stimulation and desperate to please his father, to keep him happy. And if Howard's interest was sometimes mixed with something darker, a shadow across his face when Tony succeeded too quickly: well Tony was used to conditional love.
The familiar sound of repulsors shattered the quiet park and Steve looked up as Iron Man flew over his head. The suit was unfamiliar, metallic and sleek. But Steve had been watching Tony fly at his side for years and the man’s movements were as familiar to Steve as his own. He predicted the little seal-like twist that Tony made in the air. A smile threatened, tweaking the corners of his mouth. Steve couldn’t remember the last time he had seen Tony fly as if he enjoyed it. Iron Man swung upright; one leg outstretched as he descended. He landed close by, merely feet away.
“We won’t,” Steve said firmly. He wasn’t sure if he was telling Tony or himself. He closed his eyes, heart finally slowing down. He and Tony were working on the same side. They were together. Finally. “We fixed things.”
Once the panic, the adrenaline had drained away Tony was left with just the embarrassment; the humiliation at having been seen like before the Avengers. He was already the only base-line human on the team, he didn’t need to give anyone any more reasons to believe he was weak.
Tony flipped his mask up, assessing the damage around him. Robot parts were scattered on the tarmac around them, sparking and spasming in some sort of robotic death throes. Clint had dropped down from his perch and was poking a sizzling arm with his bow.
Tony chose a sci-fi film, something with snappy dialogue and spaceship fights. Steve didn’t remember ever having seen it before but from the way, Tony commented derisively at the questionable science in the movie it seemed like something of a tradition. Steve finished his food and let his attention be captured by the movie. He was tired, so very tired and it was easy to relax into the sheets, to let go of the hyper-vigilant mode he had been operating in since he had been shot.
“Baby, you look so pale,” Maria said, running her hands through Tony’s hair, her face pinched with worry.
Steve sighed. He stared down at Tony’s relaxed, sleeping face. Steve wanted to go home. He wanted to fix things with his Tony. He had this future waiting for him and he wanted it. He wanted it so badly he could almost taste it.
Tony couldn’t help but smile back. People had very particular ideas about how Captain America should act and think, and the intensity of those expectations often made Steve clam up like an oyster, retreating to blank stoniness. It was sad because the real Steve Rogers was a little shit, sarcastic and pushy, competitive to a fault and with a mouth like a sailor when he was annoyed. Tony much preferred Steve Rogers to Captain America.
Tony did feel sick, his stomach clenched hungrily and he was too hot, dizzy with heat. He licked his lips and asked for something to drink. Maria smiled sadly down at him, “After the doctor has visited. Ok, Tesoro?”
“Oh, yes, I can imagine how hard it’s been on you,” The doctor said soothingly, “This was a sigmoidoscopy, it only looked at a small portion of his intestines. Sometimes a full colonoscopy is needed to identify the issue. We can do it if needed.”
“I won’t let him hurt you.” He told Tony fiercely, remembering the Hydra Supreme’s pointed threats, the possessiveness and cruelty in his eyes. Steve didn’t doubt his counterpart would be back, more determined than ever to have Tony.
The Hydra Supreme‘s eyes went wide, shocked. He tried to take a step forward but his legs faltered and he fell, folding to the ground. Tony stood over the Hydra Surpreme’s body. The dark haired was wide-eyed, his face bloodless. In his hands was a gun, held steady.
Then Tony was gone, moving fast out of the room. In the distance, Steve could hear the blast of repulsors, air whipping as Iron Man flew to meet his enemy.
Then he was gone, the door beeping in warning as it locked behind him. For a moment there was silence, calm after the storm. Then Tony seemed to curl into himself even more, folding himself as small as he could manage. One huge desperate, shuddering sob escaped him. Tony gulped air unevenly, his breathing wet and rattling, painful to hear. He pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes, rocking slightly like a child trying to soothe themselves.
It was a short walk to where Tony was being kept. Steve tried to remain calm as they walked, his blood was pounding so loudly in his ears he couldn’t hear anything else. Steve half expecting his cover to be blown at any moment. The agent walking in front kept glancing at him out the corner of his eyes, pupils darting with fear and curiosity. Steve needed to get rid of him quick before he got over his fear and realised that something wasn’t right.
Tony’s laugh snapped like a whip between them. His mouth curled into a sneer. “Yeah, I don’t think so. Nice try though.” He made to walk away; a hand raised towards Steve dismissively as if he could brush him away.
Steve’s hand went to the wound at his side and Tony met his gaze, his eyes burning brilliant, blue hot.
The buzz of adrenaline faded a little and Steve wished not the first time that he could reach out and touch the A.I. It felt so cruel to not be able to touch and if Steve was being honest, finding himself without physical demonstration made him uncomfortably aware of how hard he found talking about his feelings. The A.I. shifted; a child moved by their own indecision.
The mismatch of TV and computer screens stacked up in the corner of the room suddenly sparked to life, static filling the room.  Steve turned towards the noise. His eyes tracked the screens quickly, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. Diagnostics ran across the bottom, heart rate, oxygen intake, brain activity. The rest of the screens were taken up by a close camera video feed of Tony’s sleeping face. Steve felt something in his chest relax, unwind and he released a long, shaking breath. He went to the screens, pressing his fingers to Tony’s pale face. The man’s eyes were moving, a brief flicker beneath his eyelids.
Then she would give him his pills, ibuprofen, naproxen. An assortment of painkillers and anti-inflammatories. Tony knew the names of drugs, learnt to recognise how sick he was by which one she reached for first. Sometimes he took just one and other times there was a train of them, a little army of pill soldiers that Tony would line up and then swallow, sipping from his mother’s coffee to help them go down. He imagined himself a monster, swallowing the marching army one man at a time. Nothing worked, his stomach problems got worse and he grew as slender as a willow branch, baby fat stripped from his bones until his joints were swollen, protruding from his limbs.
Tony glanced over at his mother, confused. He didn’t think he hurt when he ate and he definitely wasn’t leaving any food, not with the new diet he was on for his allergies. He licked his plates clean, chasing the lingering taste of food with his fingers and tongue as his stomach-churning ravenously. He could feel the protest on the tip of his tongue, an automatic denial but it died as quickly as he thought it, shrivelling in his mouth like rotting fruit. He hung his head, suddenly ashamed but not sure why.
Tony looked up at her. She had pushed her sunglasses to perch on the top of her head and was leaning across the table, cigarette dropped and forgotten by her feet. Her eyes were intent, bright with concern.
Peter wiggled in Papa’s arm until he was able to see his Daddy as well. Papa reached out and gently drew him closer until they were all close and pressed up together, Peter squished inbetween two chest, the arc reactor pleasantly warm against his cheek. He sighed, feeling the knot in his chest release a little. It was all going to be ok.
Tony’s mouth opened compliantly. His eyes were huge in his sunken face, his skin translucent from so long without sun. The Hydra Supreme was smiling as Tony struggled to meet the offered glass, his eyes darkening with triumph.
Steve picked the boy up easily. He was all skin and bones, a featherweight as he wiggled on Steve’s shoulders. The boy released a sigh of relief, sagging slightly so he was slumped around Steve’s neck and shoulders, chin resting gently on the crown of Steve’s head. “You’re strong.”
Steve wanted to touch him, to hold him. At least to rest a hand on his shoulder. How lonely it must be to never feel another person’s skin. And Tony has always been so tactile; he had always been the first one to rest his hand on Steve’s shoulder, to throw his arm around the others Avengers.  Steve curled his fingers uptight, stopping himself for reaching out. “It wasn’t your fault. And now I’m here and we’re going to stop him. Together.”
Clint’s cooed with laughter at them, appearing at the other end of the room. He was shrugging into his combat gear, stumbling his way towards them.
On the opposite wall, the flickering fluorescent light of the TV stretched out across the floor. Tony paused, his attention moving understandingly between the TV and Steve’s turned back. He released a small darkly amused sound, his obvious remorselessness like nails on a chalkboard. “Oh dear, what have they said about me now.”
There was a pause as F.R.I.D.A.Y. considered how to respond. Steve almost smiled. “You at might as well tell where he is, otherwise I’m going to start tearing this place apart.”
A few months ago, Howard had caught Tony playing around in his workshop, copying his father's plans for a circuit board. Tony knew he shouldn’t have been anywhere near his father’s workshop. The only other time Tony had tried to enter the workshop Howard had thrashed Tony; bending him over the worn leather arm of his desk chair and whipping his bare backside with the hardened sole of his shoe until Tony was crying, begging him to stop. Sometimes Tony thought maybe he had dreamed the incident, that the lingering pain in his thighs and buttocks were the cobweb remnants of a bad dream. Even if it had just been a dream, it had been enough to keep Tony away. At least for a while.
Steve, threw himself sideways, rolling away. He got to his feet, wiping the sweat from his eyes. “I could do this all day.”
“Why would I?” Tony asked, sounding for the first time something other than amused. “Why would I mess with your head after I saved your life!”
Steve remembered this; he remembered when Tony had lost his company to Obadiah. He knew it had been partly because of Tony’s alcohol problem, but Tony had fixed things. He had stopped drinking and got his company back. Steve’s looked over at Tony, repulsed by the man’s shaking hands and protruding bones. He didn’t remember things being this bad, he didn’t remember Tony losing his home or begging for money on the streets. He didn’t remember Tony’s rock bottom being this low.
“You ignored protocol and went into battle alone.” Steve wasn’t shouting but it didn’t in any way make him sound less angry, less fearsome.
Tony laughed quietly, the sound grating like an untuned musical note. “The best way I can help people is by disappearing. I screwed over my staff, my friends, the Avengers. I can’t be an Avenger again. Some things you just can’t get past.”
“Yeah, yeah. Fine. I’ll come down and –” Tony stopped talking abruptly, his mouth falling open in silent surprise as he saw Steve. He gaped like a goldfish before croaking, “I’ll call you back.”
Tony bit his lip, his gaze was distant as if he was seeing something Steve couldn’t. “A couple of years after the SHRA, it took us a long to get over that one. Oh, and I have my mind deleted which didn’t help.”
A grainy surveillance video of an old man filled the screen. He was walked slowly, a baseball cap pulled low over his ears; his face tucked into his collar. Steve frowned, unable to make out the man’s face. Evidence of fitness lingered in his broad shoulders, in the thickness of his arms. But old age had stolen the steadiness from his limbs and his liver marked hands shook as he reached out to pull his oversized jacket tighter around himself. The man turned, staring directly into the camera.
Steve beamed down at him, “There you are.” He reached out, ignoring the twitch in Tony’s jaw and ran his fingers lovingly down his cheek. “It’s been so lonely without you, baby.”
“Your grandfather was a pig,” She told Tony from behind her big sunglasses, cigarette hanging limp and fuming in her hand.
Tony’s face twitched, a minuscule movement. When he finally replied, his words were carefully, delicately chosen. “I don’t think Steve would hurt him. Tony is probably as safe as anyone could be.”
Steve stared down at Tony, water dripping from his pale eyelashes and onto the bedspread. He released a huff; the sound a shotgun in the tense silence between them. Steve moved. The back of his hand struck Tony’s face hard, bone-crunching at the force of the blow. Tony cried out, knocked sideways off the bed. He landed in a knot of limbs, clawing weakly at the floor as he tried to drag himself across the floor on withered, useless limbs.
“The Avengers.” Tony said, and his lip quirking slightly, “the Defenders. Pretty much anyone who isn’t fighting Hydra’s forces directly.”
“Interception of doombots in approximately four minutes,” JARVIS’ said, his steady voice almost enough to calm the jittery rabbit beat of Tony’s heart. On the overlay screen in Tony’s headset, he could see Steve’s number flashing at him. Tony ignored it.
“Dude, don’t even think about.” Clint warned, “Coulson will have your guts if you start stealing from evil robot parts.”
That night, everyone in the manor must have heard his parents arguing. Maria’s voice was a high-pitched wail, accusatory and desperate and Howard had been mocking, disgusted by her. Tony had rarely seen his parents interact outside of public events; they were like planets, orbiting the same space but never meeting. However, it wasn’t until that night he’d understood the depths of their loathing. Tony thought he would throw up listening to them, flinching each time his name echoed up through the floorboard. Tony had wiggled down into the centre of his bed, the weight of the duvet surrounding him, muffling the sounds coming from downstairs. It didn’t make much difference; he still knew what they were arguing about. They had found another battlefield.
Hydra Supreme reeled backwards, cursing thickly as he scrambled to stop the blood flowing from his shattered nose.
“Well, well, well.” Steve forced his eyes open. Tony wavered into focus above him. The man was smirking, his whole face filled with cold, sharp excitement.  Tony crouched down, never taking his eyes off Steve’s face. His tongue coming out to lick the edges of his mouth. Up close, his eyes were brilliant, unnaturally blue, almost glowing. “What do we have here?”
Steve rolled his eyes, “Tony it’s 10 in the morning.” He dropped his hand, the photograph and his questions forgotten momentarily.
Steve looked around. He was in some sort of rural, park-like area, the ground beneath him was gravelled but beyond him was grass, neatly trimmed and surrounded by tall, imposing trees. Aware that he was laid out in the open air with his hands tied behind his back and blood soaking his uniform, Steve forced himself upright. Between his injury and the handcuffs, it was a struggle and sweat dripped down his forehead, stinging his eyes. Steve flexed his arms once again, cursing Tony as the metal groaned but remained unbreakable. Feeling exposed, Steve made his way for the cover of the trees, each step sent jolts of searing pain through him. Until he figured out where he was and how the hell he had got here, Steve had to assume everything was hostile. Considering that it had been Sharon who had given him the wound in his torso, that didn’t seem far-fetched.
Tony waved at him, gesturing him closer. Steve came to a halt before him, close enough that Tony could see the worry bubbling up beneath his neutral expression but far enough away that Tony couldn’t have touched him even if had stretched out his arm.
“Good morning, Commander Rogers. It is 7:00 am on the 16th of March. The weather is slightly overcast and the temperature is 17 degrees Fahrenheit.”
The man reflected back at him was clad in a skin-tight, navy, catsuit. A five-pointed star encircled in white rested high on his chest and thick white stripes fanned out from the emblem, unfurling like a shadow of wings across his chest and back and wrapping around his upper arms and shoulders. A strange, pale cage around his torso.
Maria laughed, throwing back her head in delight. The watery dawn light caught the highlights in her dark hair making her sparkle. “Two cups, Jarvis.”
“What’s a little attempted murder between friends.” Tony rolled the word friends over his tongue, drawing out the vowels until it the word was soft and stretched out like toffee, slippery in his mouth. It felt like a challenge, a dare.
“You’re injured. Steve, don’t move. Just let me…” Iron Man stepped into view. This armour was red and gold, an older design with its flat face and big hands. Steve relaxed at the sight of it. Part of him half expected to land back in San Francisco. To be back with the Tony from his first time jump with his snake grin and too blue, electric eyes and his alluring psychopathy.
His Daddy kept asking him questions. Questions about school and his friends: had someone been mean to him? Did he want to talk about it?
Tony shook his head, “The Triskelion is a fortress, hundreds of guards and DNA scanners at every door.  We don’t have the manpower or the resource for a rescue mission.”
The smell of people’s fear and anger swallowed him as he was led up the steps. Steve looked around searching for Tony, wondering if the other man would be here to savour his victory. No, Tony would be watching this play out from behind a screen. He never did like to get his hands dirty.
Tony pulled away, eyes opening slowly. He looked at Steve smiling and then winced, turning away from Steve’s gaze. Steve put his hands in his lap abruptly, embarrassment lingered between them as the realised what they had been doing.
Even before Steve had fought Tony, the other man had looked tired, weary circles pressed under his eyes, strain lines carved deep into his forehead. That was all gone. It was as if he had lost 15 years, any and all imperfections smoothed out. His skin was radiant, almost glowing gold in the watery bedroom light. His eyes were eerily blue, burning in his face. Even his hair looked thicker, mussed and soft as it curled at the edge of his temples. He looked like an artist’s impression of Tony Stark. A picture rather than a real person.
Tony’s inhumanness was painfully apparent as he fumbled around the workshop, searching for food and drink he obviously hadn’t thought about in a long time. Eventually, he found a stash of cardboard tasting protein bars and stale water. Steve took them without complaint, politely ignoring Tony embarrassed grimace.
“Peter. Peter. Look at me honey.” Daddy called his name, gently running his hand down Peter’s back even though he was crying so hard he knew he was shaking something awful. He has saved his Daddy but now he felt worse than ever. “It’s OK, it’s over now. I’ve got you.” With a sob he looked up.
Tony choked, the last word of his sentence suddenly dropping off his lips. He frowned, surprised by himself, and Steve mirrored his expression, confusion spreading across his golden features like clouds across the sky. Tony tried to speak again, but this time pain rocked through him, sharp ice blades seemed to rip up from his stomach. He glanced down uncertainly. Cradled against his chest, the doombot arm was glowing once again, faint red and blue circuity sparking to flickering light. From the tangle panel of its forearm, a blade had popped out, propelled by a final pulse of power. The blade which was now protruding from Tony’s gut.
His fist rammed into Steve’s gut, aimed cruelly at his wound and sinking deep enough that it felt like he had hit Steve’s spine. The power, the force behind the punch lifted Steve off his feet and ripped him away from Tony. Steve landed hard, skidding gracelessly across the polished floor. The pain in his side exploded, tearing through him with such force that he arched, body spasming before dropping limply, broken to the ground. He sucked in a harsh, shocked breath.
The suddenness of the movement knocked the glass out of Steve's hands. It crashed to the floor, glass shattering. Water scattered, soaking Steve’s uniform, his face. Tony stared up at him, eyes narrowed.
Tony didn’t reply, his breathing had levelled out, slow and heavy as he dropped uneasily into sleep.
Peter’s mouth twisted as he pondered the question. It was a serious one. He knew it has been an accident, and from the way Daddy was staring wide eyed over Papa’s shoulder Peter knew that he should say yes. But Amy had said no should hit anyone, no matter what. Did it not matter because Papa hadn’t meant to? But Daddy had still been hurt.
Tony folded his arms around himself defensively. “I thought we were trying this thing where we didn’t keep secrets from each other. “
“He’s too small.” The doctor huffed, sounding annoyed. Something slippery and cold reached between his buttocks and Tony jolted like a live wire in surprise. “Fuck sake, keep him still. I don’t want to rip him apart.”
Tony slipped out of Steve’s hands deftly, bereft at the loss of contact while simultaneously glad it was over. Steve touching him made him feel stripped bare, exposed. He turned, trying to force a reassuring, carefree grin at Steve. If Steve’s expression was anything to go by, Tony guessed he failed that too.
“It itches,” Tony replied, his voice was scratchy. It was a struggle to get the words out, they were stuck to the roof of his mouth like toffee.
“Have you not figured it out yet, darling?” Tony asked, his voice lingered on the endearment, rolling it across his tongue. “You’re not in Kansas anymore.”
“Fucking Stark,” Bucky growled, he slammed his metal fist onto the table next him, leaving behind a fist-sized indent. “Always choosing the worst option.”
Peter’s own eyes stung, though he wasn’t sure why. He pushed his favourite purple crayon across the table with a smile. “Purple’s my favourite, it’s lucky” he told Amy, “but you can have it if you want.”
Tony pushed his thoughts away, and looked back at Steve with a shrug, “It’s not your fault. I suggested we go and look, I just wanted to make you happy.”
Steve felt a surge of rage at the sight, struggling with himself to keep the scream that was threatening to spill off his tongue stifled behind his teeth. He half expected the Hydra Supreme to know somehow that Steve was here watching them. Any minute the other Steve would turn his sneering gaze to the mirror, eyes twinkling in victory. But nothing happened. The Hydra Supreme had his attention focused elsewhere. “Come on Tony, you can’t hide forever.”
Steve grimaced in agreement. They glanced at each and started to laugh, agreeing to separate in order to peel the wet clothes off, dropping them in sticky wet piles to the floor.
Maria hummed soothingly, tugging Tony upwards into a sitting position and Tony bite his lip at the sudden spike of pain that curled through his lower abdomen. Something slid down between his thighs, a sticky slickness across his skin and Tony panicked for a second thinking he had wet himself. He shifted uncomfortably realising what it was and a choked, burning tightened across his chest, stealing his breathe.
Daddy had loved the gold glitter on his Ironman suit and told Peter that he was very clever to create a rainbow of colours to represent JARVIS. Peter felt a little guilty as he hadn’t exactly meant to draw JARVIS like that. Later that night, he’d told JARVIS the truth, but JARVIS said he didn’t mind. So Peter stopped worrying about it so much and promised himself he’d draw JARVIS his very own picture to make up for it.
Steve waited, prowling like a lion in a cage. He counted the seconds in his head, imagining how long it would take for the Hydra Supreme to walk down the corridor and out of sight.
The hard line of Amy’s mouth softened and she held out the red pen in sympathy. “I did mine wrong too at first. If you ask, you can get a new piece of paper.”
In the darkness, Tony’s electric blue eyes shone like beacons, watching him fall away. His voice followed Steve, faint snatches of one final statement.
The Steve on screen was wearing black. The suit was tight and protective like his Captain America outfit, like his commander outfit. But the star motif was gone. It was all gone.
Without the abrupt, sickening shock of pain, Tony was able to follow the worming tube more clearly; he imagined he could trace its clumsy path as it curled through his intestines. The sharpest pain seemed to happen when the tube was forced to bend, scraping his insides as it contorted. And there was always the discomforted feeling of being too full, of having the tube bulging through his insides, pulling him apart. His gut clenched, spasming in protest and Tony, feeling strangely disconnected from his body, wondered why they were doing this to him, why his mother had wanted them to do this to him.
Steve placed a hand over the wound, silent as Tony stepped closer, encroaching into Steve’s personal space. Up close, Steve was captured in the blue of Tony’s eyes, they were so bright, electricity captured and sparking inside his irises. Steve had never noticed Tony having such blue eyes before
“Extremis is too dangerous for public usage. You’re putting people at risk.” Steve said, hardening himself, ignoring the flare of wrongness in his gut. “I know you wouldn’t want this.”
Steve struggled for a moment, his silence making Tony look at him curiously. Steve saw another version of the man imposed over this one, a Tony with a beaten face, snarling in defiance as he lay defeated. Telling Steve to ‘finish it.’  Steve swallowed, “I hurt a friend, nearly killed him.”
Steve slowly wiped the water from his face. He was cold, methodical as he cleaned himself up. All displays of love and warmth had faded, revealing something cold, uncaring and filled with anger. He stepped around Tony carefully, boots landing millimetres away from the man’s grasping fingers.
Steve’s careful exploration of his injuries revealed that he was no longer wearing his suit. Instead, he was dressed in a flimsy hospital gown, paper thin and open at the back. He winced at the feel of it, imagining trying to fight in it. Imagining facing Tony in it. Steve sighed wearily. He had learnt during the war and his time with the Avengers to focus on one problem at a timeix one thing and then move onto the next problem. Focusing on his clothing issue, helped subdue the rising feeling of panic. Today had pretty much been the worse. But Steve would fix things, just as soon as he found his clothes.
Steve made a quiet noise of surprise, his fingers tightening longingly around the photograph. t was a picture of him and Tony back when they had first started the Avengers. He and Tony were pressed in close, eyes crinkling in laughter. Tony’s face was directed outwards, towards the viewer but Steve’s attention was on his companion, his expression soft as he watched Tony laugh.
There was a moment of silence. Tension, expectancy strung out between the Hydra Supreme and Tony like caramel. Tony was gasping shallowly, little punched out breathes that seemed to fight to escape him. From inside the viewing room Steve could barely watch, every atom in his body was screaming at him to get in there, to rip the Hydra Supreme away from Tony. To stop Tony before he declared his allegiance to Hydra.  But he forced himself to remain where he was. The wound in his side was better than it had been, noticeably less painful than it had been. But it was still there, sapping his energy, his strength. In order to win this battle, Steve needed the element of surprise. He couldn’t risk a face on face confrontation.
“That wasn’t too bad was it?” The nurse said finally, a smile pulling awkwardly at her face. “Let’s get you back to your mother. I’m sure she is worried about you.”
The pod sat gleaming and huge in the otherwise empty room. Steve sighed in relief and strode towards it, hands coming out to rest on the glass.
Tony was a creature of the city, made for bright lights, celebrity and opulence. Steve had always thought of him as the embodiment of this century, a sleek, flashy image of modernity. He was out of the place in the park, a charged lightning storm on a calm day.
Steve was never one to turn away from a fight and it felt wrong to wait here, safe while Tony was fighting. Steve paced the room uneasily. He told himself to trust Tony. If the man said he was fine, Steve should believe him. Trust was the foundation of friendship, he reminded himself. And yet Steve couldn’t shake his feeling of unease.
“I love him. Always have. Pretty much since the moment I met him.” Tony’s smile was stretched too tight, skin painfully tugging at his exhausted, purple circled eyes. “Maybe even before. I was a big, big fan of the comic books”
“Tony-,” Steve ducked, narrowly missing a glass thrown at his head. Glass shards rained down around him. Steve cursed at the noise, quickly stepping into the room and closing the door behind him.
“We should get food, I’m starving,” Tony said suddenly, moving so his fathers’ desk was between them. “How do you feel about burgers? Nothing more American than burgers? Although I could go for Chinese. What do you fancy, big guy?”
The three other men crowded in on him. For a while Steve held his own, teeth gritted against the pain in his side as he spun between the three men. They cursed under the strength of his blows, learning quickly that they needed to work together to match him. One of the hired muscles had a knife; he twirled it expertly, the serrated edge slashing through Steve’s forearm painfully. Steve hissed and he grabbed the man, wrestling the knife away. He was slow, sluggish with pain and he left his side exposed. Pain erupted down his torso as a punch landed dead centre on his bullet wound. Steve cried out, knees buckling.
Steve scowled, grabbing the man’s shoulder and forcing his attention back towards Steve. Tony’s eyes were bright in his grimy face, a light in the dark. “That’s not true. You are a superhero, a hero. You have spent your entire life trying to atone for past mistakes, to be better. You get knocked down but you always get up, always keep trying. That’s why you’re a role model, a hero.”
Steve dropped down on Tony, uncurling his hands from around the other man’s wrist. He had gripped Tony too hard towards the end and there were red marks pressing damningly into those bird-bone wrists. Steve winced, kissing the insides of Tony’s arms apologetically.
“I did. I knew what I was doing.” Steve interrupted sharply. His pressed the flats of his hands against his eyes, rubbing the image away desperately. “We were fighting on opposite sides of the war but I still hurt him, I still dream about what I did.”
Tony could feel his mother’s eyes on him and he smiled up at Jarvis. “I want some coffee, I want to be like Mama.”
Tony glanced over at him and Steve squeezed gently. There something too intimate, too raw in the gesture; Tony swallowed, his throat feeling narrower, painful. He had the strangest feeling that he might cry suddenly.
Tony made an unhappy noise but her fingers dug in tighter and her eyes were hard, annoyed as she stared down at him. Tony licked his lips, they were cracking and he was thirsty. There had been no breakfast, no drinks today. He let his head fall back against her chest, and after a moment the slow movement of her rocking chair started up again and his mother’s voice lilted back into a soft, soothing lullaby.
“That doesn’t make sense.” Steve shook his head. If he had only been here eight hours, he couldn’t have lost seven years. The A.I. must be malfunctioning. Or, this was Tony playing a joke and not a particularly funny one.
“Yeah, that too,” Steve said over his shoulder. He dropped onto the sofa easily, eating space in a way he rarely let himself do. Tony wondered about that sometimes, tried to imagine what it would be like to wake up one day and find himself doubled in size. Steve hid it well, but the deliberate, careful control over his physicality indicated a level of awkwardness that he never spoke of aloud. Tony slumped down next to Steve, muffling a groan as his bones decided to make their weary aches know.
“Please, Maria don’t worry. I can see Anthony is unwell. We will get to the bottom of this, there are plenty of tests we can try. We just have to pick a starting point.”
“Are you not hungry?” Jarvis asked insistently, breaking his polite, demure demeanour. He was frowning and Tony could feel himself getting agitated, shifting in his seat as he tried to guess what the right thing to say was.
“I know,” Steve said casually, and his expression was open, shoulders softened and rounded. “But I’m awake and it would be nice to have some company.”
Steve exhaled unevenly, and closed his eyes for a long moment, the anger draining out of him. When he looked at Tony, his eyes roamed across Tony’s face as if searching for something. “I’m worried about you, Tony. I know you’re not sleeping lately; you barely eat anything. And half the time you’re completely zoned out. It’s like you’re not with us anymore. If you tell me what is going on, I can help.”
“Doombots.” Natasha said simply and there was a groan throughout the tower even as Steve ordered them to suit up. Tony remained silent as he to his feet, neck cracking at the sudden stretch.
He dragged his hands over his face, pulling at his skin until it stung. Tony had had panic attacks before; he went through phases of them. Blips of anxiety and humiliation scattered through his time at boarding school and MIT. He had endured them as best he could, waited them out until he was normal again. Tony had never figured out what set him off, he had never wanted to think about them. His father would have just said it was another example of how he was weak and Tony hadn’t wanted to prove his father right by finding out that there was no cause beyond Tony’s own self-created anxiety.
“He’s a fugitive, a criminal now Steve.” Sam started. “After you died, he just… broke. He ran S.H.I.E.L.D. into the ground.  It was replaced by H.A.M.M.E.R. but Tony wouldn’t work with Osborn. They say he released some sort of virus into their system. Osborn had an arrest warrant out on him for treason.”
Steve pushed the thought aside, embarrassed. His suit was started to feel wet and cold as blood continued to escape his wound. One problem at a time, he reminded himself.
Before Tony could react, the doctor had gripped his blanket and flipped it away, exposing Tony’s back. Then the doctor pulled apart his paper gown roughly. A humiliated protest burned across Tony’s tongue as the air rushed across his exposed backside. He was shocked, completely caught off guard by the unexpected activity. Tony curled up tighter, imagining the room full of people looking at the exposed, goose-bumped skin, the bony ridges of his spine, his bum. Someone laughed in the background, a muffled exchange of words. Tony’s cheeks burned, tears prickling at his eyes.
“You’re telling me now,” Steve said, his voice was hoarse, the words felt like they were ripped directly from deep inside him.
“I was thinking that everyone wants to be better looking, younger, stronger,” Tony said, eyes finally meeting Steve’s. His voice was cold, completely heartless.  “Not all of us were lucky enough to be given super soldier serum on a silver platter.”
Tony hesitated; half turned with uncertainty; his face twisted with uneasy. “Will you find me after?”
Tony sat down next to Steve, close enough that Steve could feel the heat of his skin. He was relaxed, skin crinkling at the corners of his eyes.  “I’ll try to remember that for the future.”
Steve nodded, the instructions running through his mind on repeat. He could feel the familiar surge of adrenaline filling him, the slow, calmness of his mind just before he leapt into action. He swung his shield up and over his head, locking into place on his back with a sharp nod at the A.I. “Got it. I’m ready.”
“You’re so beautiful,” Steve told him hoarsely, forcing himself to slow down, to drag out one long shuddering kiss. Tony mouth was red, swollen from the rough treatment. Steve wanted to touch it, to drag his thumb over that pouting bottom lip.  “That was the first thought I had when I met you. That you were the most handsome man I ever met.”
Tony blinked at Steve blankly. There was a data stream running through his pupils, making his eyes move and twist in his face. He blinked once more, his features settling back to normal. Or as normal as they could be for an A.I. made of light.
“We had lots of food allergies in my family you see, my older brother dropped dead from a nut allergy when we were children – it broke my mother’s heart. Can we test for that?”
“Welcome to Hydra, Tony.” Steve was saying on screen, his hand pressed to the glass, “I think it’s time you woke up.”
“Tesoro, come on.” Maria interrupted him, holding out a hand. She was wearing gloves, neat little white things that felt slippery in Tony’s hand. He let her lead him on, peering around distractedly at the waiting room. They had only recently started venturing beyond the manor to find a paediatrician who “knew what they were talking about” and Tony was still intrigued by the clean little white offices he found himself in and the brightly coloured picture books and toys that filled the waiting rooms. He didn’t have anything like that at home, his father said he was too smart for rubbish like that but Tony’s fingers betrayed him, itching to touch.
Steve’s skin was crawling. He and Tony had never seen eye to eye when it came to Tony’s ‘upgrades’. In Steve’s mind, there were some things that just shouldn’t be messed with. It was dangerous, careless. He wouldn’t put it past Tony to use technology on him, he certainly did it to himself enough. “What did he do to me!”
The Hydra Supreme ran the back of his hand under his nose, dragging it through his blood. He moved his jaw side to side. The joints cracked, teeth and eyes bulging as he a monster escaping the confines of a broken mask. His fury was a volcano bubbling under the surface, molten. “That was a very stupid thing to do.”
“Sorry, Mama.” He whispered, his voice raspy. His eyes were burning as if he wanted to cry but he found that the tears wouldn’t come. “I won’t do it again.”
A small, sickly looking boy stared at the camera. His face was pinched with anxiety, eyes huge in his exhausted, too-thin face. The oversized hospital robe he was wearing was stiff with starch, hanging off his protruding collarbones and pooling at his elbows. Behind him, Maria was stood, dressed in her Sunday best. Next to Tony’s diminished pallidity, she was radiant. Her eyes were bright with barely suppressed excitement.
Tony tilted his head, those strange electric blue eyes darkening. “Maybe once. But that was before I was shown the truth. Things got a whole lot easier once I realised most people aren’t worth my help.”
“I know.” Tony was breathless, chest heaving. “But he’s currently the leader of Hydra. I think we’re on a break.”
Steve took his hands off the screen, skin crawling with repulsion. “Impossible.” He said, his voice echoing breathlessly in the huge lab.
“Fine, fine.” Tony waved a hand at him and shimmied into a pair of loose trousers. He didn’t bother to put a top on but Steve didn’t dare press his luck. “You know, I forgot how much of a prude you could be.”
“He was just like you,” Steve said eventually. He glanced at the atrium once more.  “Wait here.” Steve straightening his shoulders and took one deep breath before standing up.
“I know.” Steve told him, “But if you sit on my shoulders, you can be the lookout and we will see if the bad men are coming.”
Steve went where Tony had pointed, tugging at a moth-eaten sheet. It pulled away easily, leaving a little cloud of dust that made Steve's eyes water.
The room Steve stepped into was a glorified broom closet, long and thin and dark. It was bare apart from the mirror stretched across the entire inside wall. At least Steve thought it was a mirror. There was light seeping from around the sharp edges, giving the dark closet an eerie glow. Steve moved closer, stopping when he was dead centre to the mirror. He inhaled sharply, understanding why the agent had called this the viewing room. The one-way mirror was a window into the room Tony was being kept in. A voyeur’s dream.
The armour was waiting for him; its armoured plates peeled open like an orange, the uncoloured silvery insides shinning welcomingly. Tony barely noticed as it curled securely around him, still thrumming with anger. He knew distantly that Steve was probably trying to be sensitive, to be kind but it set Tony’s teeth on edge, made him want to come out swinging.
Peter had thought his Papa could make everything better, that he’d protect them all because he was Ccaptain America, but he’d been wrong.
“Sorry,” Tony gasped; forcing the word out. It was important that Steve heard him, that Steve knew. So, he said it again. And again. Continuing until the creeping shadows at the edges of his vision swallowed him.
“Did you know you look just like Captain America?” she asked Steve softly. Behind them, Tony let out a huge bellow of laughter, the sound sharp and whip-like.
Peter stretched his arms out, all but throwing himself at his Papa. Big strong arms caught him and gently repositioned him against him chest. “It’s alright. I know now it was an accident.” He told his Papa, wiping away the tears that were still falling. “When it’s an accident, we just have to say sorry and make sure we don’t do it again.”
No one had bothered to explain to Tony what was about to happen. The doctors and nurses had just talked to his mother, and Maria hadn’t given Tony any information beyond instructions to be good and do as he was told. Tony had figured out it was best not to ask too many questions of his mother, that sometimes it made her mad or sad. Besides he had seen loads of doctors and paediatricians – the commonality of it had made him feel numb, uninterested in their prodding and poking, and weighing. He hadn’t even thought of asking her what they were doing today, thinking it would be more of the same.
Tony struggled, fighting with himself. “No, you don’t understand. You can’t stay with me. You need to go back to your time. To your friends.”
The only things Tony had found were memories and loneliness and he’d locked the door and walked away, promising himself that he wouldn’t come back unless he had reason to.
There was just no way he was Hydra. Steve had spent his entire life fighting, struggling against them. And yet he couldn’t deny what he had seen. Couldn’t un-see the cruel, sneer on his own face. A perfect copy of the expression he had seen on the faces of a thousand vicious Hydra agents.
“No Sir, my apologies.” The agent replied quickly, stifling his momentary surprise. He spun on heel, marching purposefully out of the room.  Steve spared the empty pod one final glance before following the man.
Tony was laid out across the bed, barely breathing. He was so still it took a moment for Steve to even notice him. Without the healing pod, he looked pale and thin as if his fat and muscles had been eaten off him slowly. His wrists and ankles were narrower than Steve had ever seen, bird-like against the sheets. The sight of Tony, lying so vulnerable made something clench, stutter in Steve's chest. He needed to get him out of here now. Before the Hydra Supreme got to him
Tony smiled, stepping into Steve’s personal space once again. He leaned up, his lips pressing a fleeting, feather-light kiss to Steve’s mouth. Then he was gone, walking back towards the door with purpose. “I’ll be right back.”
Tony’s eyes were so blue, incredibly, impossibly blue. The irises were glowing, bleeding light until his eye sockets were full of blue electricity. Static crackled along Tony’s eyelashes. The hairs on the back of Steve’s arms stood upright, quivering. He tightened his grip on Tony, inhaling sharply as strange liquid metal appeared floating in the air around them. Around Tony. The metal folded and twisted in on itself, lazily flying.
“I downloaded my A.I.’s files,” Tony told him quietly. “It had all the details about you, about where you came from. I’d say I’m sorry he forced you to come here but I’d be a bit screwed if he hadn’t so, I’m not sorry. But I am sorry for not being sorry.”
Steve's lips curled uncontrollably. There was warmth blossoming inside his chest, filling him up. He let his knee drop sideways, his leg resting against Tony’s.
“I think we need to talk about what you saw, it wasn’t what you thought. Papa didn’t mean to hit me; he didn’t mean to hurt me. He was having a nightmare and thought I was someone from his dreams, he thought I was trying to hurt him. “
“Don’t poke it too hard. It’s a high-tech band-aid, not a miracle cure.” Tony grumbled as he came back into the room.
“No in as many words, but he’s talked about getting Tony to join Hydra, to join him.” The AI paused, choosing his words carefully. “I need you to get Tony out of there before he manages it.”
The words were quiet, lost in the shuffle of doctors and nurses entering the operating theatre. Tony tried to turn, to look over his shoulder but a hand pressed him down, biting into the sharp ridge of his collarbone.
Without a word he threw himself to his feet and grabbed his assailant. He twisted her around, his forearm to her throat, locking her in place as he panted. He used the momentary respite to look around. He was in a laboratory but it wasn’t like Tony’s workshop. It was stranger, smaller than what he was used. Even as he compared, the memory of Tony’s workshop was fading, a dream disappearing with consciousness.
Steve blinked at the horizon in confusion. It had been midday minutes ago, the sun had been right above him, searing into his skin as he’d laid on those courthouse steps. But the courthouse was gone, as was the crowd and Sharon. Steve jolted at the thought of Sharon – she had shot him. The movement sent a vicious ripple of pain through him and he gasped, unable to stop himself. He couldn’t remember if his other bullet wounds had hurt this much but he suspected not.
Tony paused; his eyes narrowed as he assessed Steve. A shark smile flashed across his features, so brief Steve thought he had imagined it. “You know, I cried myself sick after you died. Sat next to your body and begged for you to come back. I don’t think I took the suit off for months, couldn’t bear to face myself. I blamed myself for everything. Not that I remember it of course. I wonder if bullet wound in your corpse wasn’t quite normal then too. Maybe I was too busy beating myself up to notice.”
His Parents were still murmuring over his head as sleep started to grab at him. Peter hadn’t slept very well for a while and safe and warm in his parents arms it was catching up with. He struggled to keep his eyes open, desperate to listen to his parents. Despite what they said to him, Papa’s upset voice revealed everything wasn’t perfect. He wasn’t that surprised, Peter knew that things were complicated and messy and even though Daddy had been hurt, Papa was hurting as well in a different way. When things hurt it could take a long time to make them better again.
“No.” Steve breathed, his voice hollow. He could only imagine one reason why there was an AI of Tony. But he couldn’t, wouldn’t believe it. Tony had survived more than anyone, there was no way he could be gone. Not when Steve had only just realised how he felt, only just seen what they could be. It was too cruel for the universe to show him something so wonderful only to snatch it away again in the next breath.
“There was a battle, there’s always a battle. He won but not before they deactivated the serum. Without it, he rapidly aged. He’s still fighting, you know. Backend coordination. A Commander now.”
Tony hesitated, stomach curdling but he took the cup and the pills obediently. It was easier this time to swallow the pills and Tony gulped them and the coffee down quickly, wanting it to be finished. His hands were shaking when he sank back into his seat and he wasn’t feeling so good. His stomach rolled, letting loose another gurgling noise but this time it was quieter, painful and Tony groaned quietly.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t realise stopping doombots was considered a tantrum now.” Tony snarled back.
Tony glanced back at the screen and it flickered to life. The human Tony’s face filled up the screen once again, his eyes moving back and forth rapidly beneath the delicate skin of his eyelids.
Tony shrugged, the movement of his shoulder sending his oversized MIT sweater sliding down his arm. Steve’s eyes tracked the movement, his mouth moving as he sat down, close enough that Tony could feel the heat radiating off him. “Everyone has nights where they can’t sleep. You’re awake.”
Through most of the fighting and the SHRA, some part of him had clung onto Tony, clung onto the belief that their friendship could weather anything. He had believed that the bond between them – stronger than brotherhood, more complicated than friendship would always be there. But after Steve had almost killed Tony, after seeing the violence, the ugliness they inspired in each other Steve had realised he was wrong. There had been too much anger and violence. It had poisoned everything between them and they had nearly ruined each other. So, Steve had let Tony go and given up the belief that they would ever be able to return to how things used to be. But now….
From the car, four men emerged. There was the twitchy, scrawny man from the passenger’s seat, his gun waving in his hands as he gestured angrily. He was strung out on drugs, his pupils blown wide. From the back emerged two silent muscle men; Steve assessed them quickly – they were strong and trained, light on their feet despite their bulk. The driver’s door opened last, a slender, slick, haired man stepping out lazily into the sun. The driver watched Steve carefully, he had a scar on his mouth that had twisted his top lip and made it look like he was permanently sneering.
