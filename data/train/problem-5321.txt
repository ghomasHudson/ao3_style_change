“I uh, what?” Dean blinked.
of his usual de-escalating mantras were helping to reign in his near-Biblical levels of fangirlish admiration at this point. It was like watching an angelic Harlequin novel unfold in front of him, and he

“Sure, man,” Dean agrees. He’s trying to coach his jaw into closing for a few moments; tries not to stare too hard. It is not lost on him that the angel has only rarely ever made himself so vulnerable. There are wounds pockmarking feathers here and there - likely the reason for their current presence- but Dean barely sees them.
“That’s it?” Dean balked in disbelief. His own body confirmed as much: he felt like he’d been dunked in a cold lake; undignified gasping included.
“I don’t-”
Indeed, though he’d seen it a few times before and met a few that were more than deserving, the idea of angels dying was unpalatable even to Dean.
“See,
The wings bore down and crushed themselves inwards, seizing and electric as they tried to contain the impending event horizon. They forced him closer to the imploding angel, until his forehead touched the scorching surface of Cas’ skin. The heat hissed off him as his features bleached incandescent, and Dean was almost blinded... though not before catching sight of tears vaporizing right off Cas' cheeks.
than usual?”
Dean’s breath stilled for a moment as the gentle press of a palm caressed his cheek in answer. Unthinkingly, his own hand rose to cover it, pressing it to him in a rush of urgency, as though to confirm the touch was real under the dreamlike cover of dark.
“Much better, thank you. I just needed rest. I’m sorry I couldn’t help more.”
Dean’s entire body flinched from the inside out.
’ between us,” Cas went on in confusion, “and I have always respected that. I would never betray your trust; I know the situation was not real. ”
“Your concern is obviously well-intended, and it means a lot to me.” is all Cas says, and it shuts Dean up faster than a bad hangover.
Unperturbed, Sam carried on.
Dean’s stomach sank into his heels. This was essentially a holy supernova seconds from happening, but he remained anchored, helplessly watching. The descent was happening so fast it was mind-boggling - the cracks breaching Cas’ skin were actually beginning to sizzle beneath his palms. A second ago, Cas was making jokes, and now he was literally unravelling, one puff of expelled Grace at a time. Dean wished he could touch the intangible wisps somehow and stuff the AWOL little jerks back inside Cas, but even then, he suspected it would have been like trying to stifle the flow of a broken dam with a cork.
Cas turns to offer him his usual muted smile and treads towards him on bare feet. He’s wearing a pair of Dean’s ancient jogging pants -which okay, weird, but a foggy memory of him telling Cas to help himself to whatever he needs does ping in his brain. He’s just never taken Dean up on the offer before. Besides, that’s not even what’s setting Dean’s eyeballs to stun. No, what’s really gone and smacked him right in the windpipe are the
The second they’d gotten back to the Bunker, Dean had done his customary rounds, hugging Sam and ruffling Jack’s hair with affection.
“That’s…. awesome,” Dean eventually agreed, his arms falling to the delicious assault on his head. “I kinda wish my head had a 20 foot wingspan now.”
“I’ll hold you to that.”
Indeed, he held fast to the angel as the great wings beat a steady, slow rhythm which generated a reasonable amount of lift without catapulting Cas into the next county. He was maintaining a safe few feet off the ground now, without much trouble.
“And uh, hey,” Dean fumbled as his butt hit the counter, “maybe someday you can gimme one of yours instead huh? If that’s a thing or -”
“Cas, what the hell?” he balked while the angel hummed thoughtfully. His eyes were still doing the odd overloaded transformer thing, like Cas had swallowed a plasma globe.
“They probably recruited a very powerful warlock, or worse, to concoct such a spell. One of my lieutenants took the brunt of the strike, but I was still partially hit. It was enough to cause me considerable damage… my angelic attributes have been….
“On the few occasions I’ve had to do it, for most, it was
His presence was heavy and warm beside Dean, but resolutely still.
“I can’t go anywhere while my wings remain on this plane.” justified that sumptuous voice from the shadows just beyond. Each word blew whispered promises across his neck, tantalizingly close.
“Yeah you’re a smart guy I get it, now all due respect, get the fuck out,” Dean snarled into his neck, every muscle taut with the extraordinary effort of keeping the boiling hysteria in his veins at bay.
he spat, cursing himself for not recognizing sooner how
There was a brief pause where Dean contemplated all the poor choices in his life that might have led him to this moment. He bowed his head in discouragement while his sibling’s snotty reflux reverberated against his ear. He could have used Sam’s backup on this one, but he wasn’t so sure that seeing his brother’s circus stilt legs covered in skin-tight fabric wouldn’t cause his own retinas to spontaneously combust. Maybe it was a win that Sammy was currently experiencing the worst man-cold in history.  Still, even though having the right gear and the right cover for a hunt was important, this case was pushing the boundaries, as few and far between as Dean’s were in terms of monster-hunting. He stared dejectedly down at his tight jeans and readjusted his cloistered junk for the hundredth time that evening. How the hell those hipsters managed it was beyond his comprehension.
The gesture felt profoundly vulnerable, more intimate than anything they’d ever broached in their precarious dance. This of course made it galaxies beyond what the emotionally-constipated Winchester could handle... but here he was anyway, just like all the other times the world decided to come apart at his feet. It's like it was his damned
“Too dangerous,” the angel breathed. “I can’t control my… my hands.”
“Cas,” he panted, voice thready with need.
“You’re all I want,” Cas reiterates softly. There is wonder tainting the gravel tones this time, as though he’s just had a quiet realization of his own. He seems determined to brand this mantra into Dean’s skin, as if his soul hadn’t been enough.
Or at least, that was the plan before a cloak of darkness restrained his retreat. Long midnight feathers encased him, and forced him back towards the angel. He swore he could almost
Their proximity caused Cas’ sudden peal of rumbling laughter to reverberate into his own chest, and it was probably one of the most wondrous things Dean had ever felt.
Like they’ve been doing it for fucking years.
“Dean,” Cas halted him, suddenly taking hold of the itchy fabric and pulling until he reached Dean’s wrist. Dean felt the contact like a current sizzling all over his skin. He also found himself captivated by the slight tremor animating Cas’ fingers… how the angel suddenly couldn’t look at him despite years of staring-related transgressions.
“Dean.”
“Cas gone?” he asked super casually.
Dean was undeterred, and voraciously curious. And, as Cas had astutely pointed out, terrified, but for entirely different reasons than fatal dread. His heart kicked violently at his throat.
Sam swears he hears Cas, in all his infinite, cosmic wisdom, mutter something about '
Dean felt some of the tension drain at the unexpected admission. For the entire duration of Castiel’s war for Heaven so far, he’d not once heard him admit to lacking that disturbing, feverish televangelist sort of conviction in the cause. As such, even if it was rooted in what he could only imagine was immeasurable bloodshed, this raw, discouraged side of Cas was oddly refreshing. Perhaps his old friend was still in there, somewhere. Encouraged, Dean wove his fingers through Castiel’s dark locks in a show of comfort.
Dean reached out and unabashedly thumbed at one of the long black primary feathers in explanation. It twitched in protest, immediately whipping away from the touch. In Dean’s defense, the things were
“I don’t see why you insist on calling them that,” the angel griped. “Chicken wings would hardly provide enough lift to sustain us both aloft.”
“Oh uh… nevermind. Just a dumb idea.”
His meandering words were met only with thick silence. Curious, he glanced over at Cas just in time to catch him with his eyes closed, head tilted slightly back. Even in the relative darkness, there was no mistaking the blissful expression lighting his features. Dean’s stomach coiled, propelling a draught of heat which reached his face (and elsewhere) in record time. He didn’t pull away. Despite his trepidation, it was nice to indulge in something comforting for a change.
Of course, at first, as molten fountains of Grace had begun pouring from the angel in great arching surges, scorching Dean in the process, the ‘kiss’ was far from the stuff of fantasies. He’d wanted to scream in fact (and not in a good way), but found himself almost magnetically sealed to Cas while angel mojo blindingly exploded all around. It branded white hot pain over all his other senses, while their lips remained the only thing anchoring them to their physical bodies. Insofar as all the ways he’d admittedly pictured this happening in the deepest, darkest corners of his brain, this version was definitely the most removed from his sexy (if unoriginal) backseat-of-the-Impala scenarios, and frankly, eons more terrifying. Dean was no Casanova, but having his face melted wasn’t exactly his idea of a hot date.
Without a word, Castiel hooks a palm around Dean’s waist, and gently reels him in. Dean’s heart thunders but he goes readily, like this is what they’ve always done; like this isn’t a huge violation of the unspoken contract they’ve always honoured. Dean can’t think of why or when they’d even agreed to it - or of much else for that matter- because Castiel’s lips come to rest against the sensitive skin alongside Dean’s mouth; just shy of contact.
“Dean, you know it’s fine if-”
‘Finally- finally,’ Dean thought, as Cas’ body turned towards him and he closed in, only to have his hands batted away and his temples promptly squashed by sturdy palms a moment later.
to be terrified of travelling at 300 miles an hour in a steel toilet paper tube, 5 miles above the ground.
Too exhausted to deal with any of it anymore, he buried his face into the polite pleats of those boring pants the angel wore. He felt Cas’ sharp intake of breath, and he couldn't really blame him. While they’d crossed certain lines recently, after a long decade of tiptoeing around each other, Dean’s unpracticed bids at affection were still as unpredictable as the rusty weathervane that spun over Bobby’s garage during summer storms. Cas welcomed him all the same, every time, thunder and all.
Dean prays the coffee will choke him as he chugs at his cup, in quiet, red-faced humiliation.
The angel’s eyes remained resolutely glued shut, a low growl rising from his throat.
He felt the wings still above him for a moment before they exhaled inwards, pressing him close. There was a long silence where he felt the angel tense beneath his fingers. For a moment, Dean was desperately afraid that despite his assurances and warm touch, Cas would vanish.
Dean pauses for a minute, letting that picture sink in.
Sam retorted amicably.
“Sam’s debriefing the local PD, but he promised he’d bring back some dinner,” he said without preamble, looking to fill the space. His sore fingers reached the back of his stiff neck, idly tracing where a headache was burrowing into tattered nerves.
Moments later, an echoed “
Dean knows he’s shaking, and not just from the reconstruction of his broken pieces. It turns out he’s not alone in that, as Cas finally pulls away enough to glance up at him. There’s desperation clouding his usually guarded expression, and
“S-so what… you just kiss a guy within an inch of his life and walk away?”
“Sure, Cas. Sounds good,” he smiled. “Shove over.”
The flip had been worrisome enough to tear Dean from the brief sanctuary of Lisa and Ben’s and hit the road again, though that had been a long time coming. Months of retrospect later, Dean had been forced to make amends with the fact that the last year spent as Mr White Picket-Fence had served its purpose, but that he wasn’t suited to being domesticated. (Big fat duh on that one, but sometimes, a guy had to try.) It had been nice for a while, to pretend he was someone whose everyday involved rides to school, dishes, and the Maddisons' annoying cat who always shat in the rose bush, as opposed to the
When Dean finally mustered the nerve to look up at him, the stony resolve engraved in Cas’ features only made everything that much worse. The entire world seemed to shrink down into focus on his unrelenting gaze, helplessly sucking Dean in like a whirlpool. He knew it was the magic’s doing of course, but he also recognized that its effects were redoubled because of a decade-long flame rooted in his gut. As much as he’d resisted all these hours, it immediately struck him that he was already lost. He was a sandcastle in a hurricane. He took a teetering step back, desperate for escape, but Cas followed, sure as the tide.
yelled in a very masculine tone, his feet swinging around in panic as he tried to forcefully pull the angel back down. Like anyone could pull an
Before he could protest any further, the angel had somehow steered him around in the blink of an eye. He suppressed a whimper as he contemplated the vexation of being treated like a Dean-sized ragdoll for the second time in 12 hours. That was, of course, until he became all too aware of Cas’ solid heat encompassing him from behind, sinewy arms locked around his midsection, outstretched feet anchored beneath his, and his chin neatly tucked over Dean’s right shoulder. He chose not to ponder what other parts were mashed up against him, though the effort was astronomical even with the fatal fright coursing through his veins. That Dean’s almost legendary libido would not be deterred by mere mortal dread was unsurprising of course, but it didn’t really help the situation.
“No, no… let’s stick to these babies if that was your plan. If you think I can help, I’m here, buddy.”
he scolded himself inwardly.
“Just warn me next time you guys are gonna be doing mating rituals in the kitchen, I’d really like to keep my toast down.”
activate certain…. reactions.”
The mere effort of speech ignited more rivulets of Grace, and they crept ghoulishly from the corners of his crackling mouth. Dean kept trying to hold him together despite how the scorching glow seeped between his fingers. The angel’s palms weakly butted against his chest, in a vain attempt to expel him with bodily force. Dean choked back a wail of frustration at the attempt, but held steadfast to his face.
,” Cas mutters somberly. “It’s rather annoying actually. Though if you’d prefer doing housework, I am not opposed. I would be happy to help; I can tend to them later.”
see it coming. He swears.
after months of sustained absence. None of it added up to anything good, including the unprompted speculation about what the wings looked like attached to Cas’ naked shoulder blades. Fortunately, Dean’s well-honed preservation instincts kicked into overdrive and banished any further queries. He dove to the pile of angelic road-kill.
He is almost overcome with wonder, the bucket nearly careening to the floor. Cas doesn’t seem to notice.
The kiss was tame compared to the previous night’s inferno, but it was everything Dean had ever wanted, from Cas’ rainstorm scent drowning him to the pleasantly rough scrape of stubble against his mouth. Now that he wasn’t besieged by spasms of celestial sorcery, he was free to delight in the sensation of Cas’s hair between his fingers, and to truly marvel at the softness of those lips he’d imagined for so long. Their meeting was unhurried and tender, but it carried the sort of heated promises which sowed shivering flames along Dean’s skin. That sweet anticipation alone was enough to buoy Dean’s disappointment when they both pulled back to catch their breath.
There was a longing to Castiel’s voice that spilled warmth into Dean’s choked chest, and sent his adrenaline-polluted pulse simmering.
funny,” Cas insisted, grass stains smudged into his chest and arms. He looked like an entire kindergarten class had held him down and doodled all over him with green wax crayons.
- with an amused sort of mischief as he considers the angel's argument. Sam grimaces visibly as Dean's face turns unmistakably wicked then, just before he proceeds to launch a positively wolfish grin at Cas. He looks like he's found the goose with the golden eggs; except
“I’m fine,” he assures, the gravel tones grittier than usual.
“Hello, Dean,” he said anticlimactically, once he realized where he was. That low, sandpaper voice stripped away Dean’s anxiety in an instant. He actually chuckled a little but the feeling of relief was fleeting, making way for something much more typical.
“Look, I’m not trying to make you feel like a freakshow here but, aren’t those… y’know, heavy? I mean I
In fact, despite being covered in monstrous bodily fluids of all kinds, Dean found he was outright smiling into the polyester.
“My brothers can be staggeringly powerful, though quite unimaginative,” he confirmed quietly, before letting his hands drop altogether. “The spell’s point is to bring its targets together, or else. Once that happens, its duty ends. In any case, the dangerous effects should be subdued for now, at least until the spell wears off entirely.”
I wouldn’t risk you.” Cas stated then, more of a realization than a question.
The ginger had strayed far from her usual geek tees and jeans, and had opted for something a few palettes darker. Dean could not recall for the life of him ever seeing her in

Of course, Cas
Dean knew the angel’s terrifying skill set well enough not to question any of that, but the mention of his brother steered him straight past the occasion to mock Cas’ clothing situation.
“Like that.” Cas explained. “It feels… closest to that, I think. One of the more enjoyable human responses to stimulation, I would wager.”
got you back, so I ain’t going anywhere.”
“Hey whoa, what-”
For all he knew, the cosmic light-show had wrapped-up a million years ago.
Dean hummed his assent, cheeks blazing. He had to crane his neck up now, to properly follow Cas’ face, and grinned proudly at the apparent success of his strategy.
“Can it, phlegm-face.”
“I said I didn’t want it to be like that,” Dean confessed feebly, “but I
As amused as he was by the cowboyism, Dean was totally outgunned. The twitchy need to flee chewed at his innards, but he was pinned by Cas’ earnest gaze.
wrong. Several alarm bells went off in his subconscious, but he let Castiel collect himself.
Without as much hesitation as he probably should have felt, he reached for a few of the feathers in his orbit. He heard the sharp intake of breath from beside him, but deliberately ignored it.
“Psssht,” she snarked, “I look
Dean owed him big time.
Dean could think of about two dozen other “responses to stimulation” he was wishing to instigate with his fingers, but he refrained.
“That poor woman must have been terrified.” the angel finally muttered. His eyes were glazed over, likely in somber visitation of those terrible events from the days prior. This was the first indication that Cas hadn’t quite recovered. His fingers still shook, and his facade had easily cracked.
Indeed, the chiseled, caramel-eyed drink-slinger had been angling for far more than tips in Cas’ case, by Dean’s estimation. Not that he’d been looking. In fact, he was averting his eyes so hard that he’d decided to vacate the premises entirely to evade any and all glimpses of the inevitable.
“It seems they’ll be around for a while longer,” he concluded dully, that breakfast omelette timbre having too easily returned to his voice. Like he hadn’t just come back from transforming into a literal star before Dean’s very eyes. “Although they no longer feel unstable. I’ll take it as a win.”
Cas seemed entirely petrified for a long moment, almost as though he were treading down his own personal green mile. There was a silence painfully long enough to make Dean wonder if he’d utterly fucked up, here.
In the insultingly sobering light of early day, Dean wasn’t entirely sure that whole episode from the previous night wasn’t some sort of horny Disney fever-nightmare anyway, so he was altogether unsurprised to find the space beside him empty, and his shoulders cold. Equally unsurprising was the potent sting of absence, hooking itself all too deeply into the thick of Dean’s throat and sticking there, despite his diligent attempts at choking it down.
He felt the angel squeeze his hand in acknowledgement.
“Gotta go Sammy. Rest up, I’ll keep you posted.”
Thankfully, despite the ill-timed boner fog, his brain had deemed the terms “vessel” and “failing” important enough to register.
“Well, considering the music, I might be inclined to light myself on fire too. Ears first.” Dean griped.
“You’re askin’ me?
Cas though, seems pensive.
“So basically you’re saying make a guy swoon, and boom, soul unlocked, spell broken? Like I said, sounds a bit Snow White to me...”
It was part dance club, part Church luncheon and part fetish party, and either way, Dean wasn’t into it. A sure sign of age, if ever there was one.
, to have the warmth on
He marvels at all of it, this creature of light and pure devotion crashing against him like he is the only shore in the world.
It was too much like a deliverance, like being plunged into a cold river after decades limping through the desert, like every country song Dean had ever heard. It was a sensation somewhere between having the best goddamned orgasm in his life, and literally being thrown into the sun. He was Icarus with his pants down, and he had no idea why this incomparable rapture had befallen him, how he had transformed into incomprehensible molten sunlight, where he began and Cas ended, if even he did end.
“Oh come on, Handmaiden. We’re under cover aren’t we?! It’s not any worse than when we visit Moondor!!” she challenged.
Cas meanwhile, seemed sheepish at the statement, pressing his teeth into that generous bottom lip of his, which was almost Dean’s undoing.
, he thought of setting his hand on fire for how unscrupulously it had betrayed him. He’d need that hand later however, for Reasons (perhaps involving suspiciously-placed tissues), so he resigned himself to the blush spreading over his features. For his part, Cas hadn’t protested.
Dean felt a soft gasp finally -finally- rise from Cas’s fluttering throat, just under where his lips explored.
“Yes, Dean? Is something wrong?”
“Yeah? Well unlike you, I got nothing to compensate for,” he snarked.
Cas nods, considering.
“I know.”
“Dean, I will Profoundly Angel-
Dean, Jesus.”
“Well, it helps to hear it….” Dean croaked, trembling despite himself.
I'm cheesy, but I try to be funny. Let me know how that comes across, if it works at all ;) And also, I'm very much aware of how many Destiel tropes/clichés are in this, but I'm kind of okay with it, lol. Still, always curious for feedback. Thanks for staying with me, still!
And so it was that Castiel, Majestic Seraph of the Lord, Sacred Warrior of Heaven and Upsettingly Attractive Michelangelo Painting Personified, landed with a muted
“Well uhm, yeah,” he blundered on, “of course. You’ve had a rough couple of days.”
“I meant with with demons,” Cas said quietly, consternation creasing his brow.
In the end, he was weak.
now, given the day’s events. It’s just… he was distracted.
Dean wasn’t sure if he should ask why he had earned the latter, while Bobby had gotten his guts stir-fried. Shaky hands. Right.
The words gut-punched him so hard, he felt his ribs ache. Happily, emotions for Dean Winchester killed boners faster than burrito night with his brother. On the flipside, this left him with actually having to deal with said feelings on the matter, since he was
A moment later, he’s clapping his hands together with a burst of enthusiasm that surprises him, and seems to perplex the angel a little.
The involuntary whimper sent molten lava plummeting south, and all at once Dean had entirely forgotten why he’d felt so slighted. Or how to speak.
Dean says nothing as he relinquishes the drink, and just stares. Stares so hard and googly-eyed that his corneas might as well just roll out a welcome mat for every single allergen in the state.
Cas quirks an eyebrow and glances at them briefly before returning to Dean’s awed expression.
He didn’t so much see as
“Yeah? Well, he was probably too shocked about that to do anything about it,” Sam smirked, before ducking away from another fruity projectile.
Before Dean could acknowledge that, or swallow the brick suddenly lodged in his throat, Cas extended his arm and the rich, tingling joy of fingers suddenly scratching along his scalp made Dean groan out loud.
And that, all of a sudden, was what struck Dean dumb as he finally dared to open his eyes again.
“Angelic flight is too fast for human eyes usually, but this.... I would like you to experience something other than nausea while flying, and this might be my only chance to give that to you.”
Either way, he ignores Cas’ petition for reason. He needs a fucking minute.
“Dean...”
“Maybe, but ….”
he was doing that, by the way.”
, and damn if Cas didn’t look
Dean’s hands skated under heavy fabric until the trench and suit jacket both hit the floor. Castiel’s chest heaved beneath him, in staggering, delicious contrast to his collected presence thus far. Finally, buttons popped open and his hands smoothed over surprisingly warm flesh, and Dean was utterly lost, buried in desire and scalding remorse alike. Still, the steady weight of Cas’ palm soothing the back of his head propelled him forward.
“Let me clarify, since you seem to be
trapped. Well, shit.
had a lot of experience flying,” Cas quipped dryly, raising an eyebrow. “You. Dean Winchester.”
Cas swayed every so slightly, seemingly lost to the sensations sparked by Dean’s fingers. Dean felt his windpipe just about close up at the expression on his face.
“I understand it is a disturbing experience for most humans. I’m sorry.”
“Fuck, Cas. Okay.” was all he had in him to say, though an arm wove itself around Cas’ hips and squeezed with all the warmth he was worth.
and he thought better of it.

“I wish I hadn’t torn my coat,” he remarks grimly.
confused chubby. He’d just have to deal with the burnt eggs later.
“Just a coupla scratches.”
“That’s the spirit.”
Forcing him to relinquish his cozy resting place, a cough rattled through Cas until more blood ran from his lips. In a quickfire gesture that almost seemed self-conscious, he unceremoniously wiped it off on his torn tan sleeve. Unthinkingly, Dean reached through the curtain of feathers for the tissues suspiciously-placed at his bedside and wiped away the residue dribbling from the corner of the angel’s mouth. Now, he’d done so out of concern - he was certain of it - but upon noticing how the plump flesh of Cas’ lips pliantly stretched beneath his fingers, he -
Thing was, while indeed topless, Cas wasn’t exactly doing anything even remotely wild (much to Dean’s innermost chagrin). In fact, unless the angel was fixing to merge yoga and photosynthesis, Dean hadn’t the slightest inkling of what he was doing. Not that he really cared.
“I’ll drop YOU once we get back down there,” Dean sniped in a voice about three octaves higher than usual.
At this, Cas finally looked at him. The striking blues made Dean falter as they always did, but he swallowed down his thundering heart.
“It’s not like that, Dean. Well, rather, it
“It’s not inconvenient, okay? I get it.” Dean admitted, as he relented to the confined space. “Look, did you ward the place at least?”
from the damp grass.
“Dean,” Cas scolds in a rougher timbre than usual, if that’s even possible.
“Yeahp. Later.”
“...Yes? What about them?”
,” Cas growled, unfurling the wings one by one as though to stretch them out. “It’s rather infuriating.”
Cas actually
“Aww, shucks Cas, I didn’t know you were such a romantic.”
“But no. I was fascinated of course, but not allowed to participate. There was never a good enough reason to disobey, back then anyway.” he added significantly.
“No no no, this can’t be happening… Cas c’mon, please,” Dean begged him, cradling his distorted features helplessly.
Peridot eyes assiduously survey the angel as he finds his way back into the bunker with an uncharacteristic teeter. The door clanks loudly behind them, safely shutting out the horrors of the day, for now. Their fresh echoes still linger however, reaffirmed with every glance he takes of his crimson-stained companion.
Cas actually squirms a tiny bit, and while it might be objectively the most adorable thing Dean has ever seen, he releases the wing and is now sort of worried all over again.
He seemed so genuinely pleased that Dean couldn’t help grinning. Leave it to Cas to be concerned about performance issues during a near-death experience.
Dean watches the light dim from Castiel’s eyes, as though the angel has realized that his scant allotment of affection has been filled for the week, or perhaps forever. He begins to pull away like always, a feather caught in a fickle breeze. Maybe it's all the knocks to the head spurring him on, but Dean knows instantly that this growing distance is a final and unbearable outrage.
Cas is the one to break Dean’s grim meanderings when he does turn to look at him. There’s a soft smile pulling at his lips as he thoughtfully cradles the coffee resting at his sternum. This does shit-all to soothe the pounding in Dean’s chest, of course.
Thankfully, Cas had chosen to ignore the compliment.
“So uhm, ” he managed, clearing his throat, “You gonna explain the tonsil-hockey Cas?
Dean was itching to stomp the hell on out of there as the levels of awkwardness neared terminal, but he stifled his recoil. No matter how obtuse Cas was being in this moment, Dean knew he hadn’t imagined that split second of heat he’d found reflected in the angel’s eyes, nor the telling choice of words Cas had used to justify his retreat. Nope, he was gonna sit there and hash this out if it killed him.
“Alright, be safe.”
“Yes,” Cas easily agreed, melting into Dean’s space like he’d always belonged there.
“Shut up.”
It didn't help that he could feel Cas’ warm, trembling breath skirt across his denim-clad lap, smell the iron-tainted air encapsulating them…. And in fact, now that his brain finally bothered to override his less decorous bodily responses, he realized that Cas having any smell at all, or breath beyond his cursory imitations for that matter, was totally,
Before he could even put the spatula down, Dean found himself crowded by piercing blues and a scowl, right up in his bacon-filled grill.
What he had not expected however, was for Cas to surge forward in his clattering, fragmented state, and crush what was left of his his grace-gagged mouth onto his.
Sam turns in time to catch Dean casually wiping his mouth in an indecent scrape of stubble - ew - but also wearing a familiar look of pig-headed resolve.
noticed about ten years ago, and hadn’t stopped noticing since. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was Cas being reckless at the drop of a hat, even despite his recent and potentially fatal handicap.
“You didn't
He took a breath and sat himself down next to Cas, creaking knees and fear of heights be damned.
“What the hell are these things made out of anyway, Adamantium?”
“We don’t have to talk about it,” Cas intercepted. Keen little bastard.
. He did want your help though, with the other stuff.”
“Yeah, thanks
“But hey man, you might still have a shot,” he blurts through teeth clenched in false cheer, “don’t let me stop you. It’s an hour ‘till close and I saw how that bartender was lookin’ atcha.”
but there it was, a violet galaxy print clinging to her skinny gams topped with a loose-fitting black knit which exposed her shoulder blades. Her bright eyes were framed with cat-eyed charcoal, and her lips dipped in a rich mauve. A simple black choker adorned her neck, and a pair of what Dean could only refer to, in his limited grasp of fashion, as
He circled Cas, as the wings gently swayed from their fullest extension, unable to tear his gaze from the lustrous wall of feathers.
He doesn’t bother keeping count of the concussions. It’s a small price to pay after all, for dispatching particularly nasty specters. Even so, as his vision wobbles and his knees scream, he has to admit that he might be getting a bit old for this shit. Took Sam so damnably long to find the last remaining piece of bone to burn- about three counties over in some podunk museum-  that Dean had actually started to worry by his sixth or seventh flight into the wall. Fortunately, the angel who still shadows him as he unlocks the heat-warped door, had helped. He always does, with no regard for his dwindling power, as usual. Dean wishes he wouldn’t, but he knows that’s a lost argument, especially given that Castiel’s the only reason he’s still able to heave a discontented sigh from his bloodied nostrils right now.
At this Dean almost choked, but when he looked up at his brother, there was nothing but - ah, there it was - dewy-eyed sincerity radiating off him like an obnoxious cotton candy fog.
There was no way Cas could ever understand the desperate kind of ache Dean felt at seeing him like that anyway. He barely understood it himself, or rather refused to acknowledge that this roiling, heated anxiety unfurling in his chest scared him far more than anything he hunted. Of course, Dean subsequently felt an urgent need to escape the burgeoning Moment, but those wings he admired so much were keeping him prisoner in a cocoon of self-loathing awkwardness.
"Alright."
“No,” Sam insisted, placing a reassuring hand on Cas’ slumped shoulder. “No, buddy. He just uh… he needs some time. It’s uh- not about you. Well, not
the weirdest person here, in case you haven’t noticed.”
“Dammit Cas, you can’t be here-” he breathed as his blood instantly erupted beneath his skin.
Castiel grins lazily.
“Hey Cas. Didn’t think breakfast was your thing, but there’s always room for-”
“Hell yeah, Dean grinned, “Consider your permission officially granted.”
An eye roll.
“It’s because we are bonded, Dean.” he explained simply, as though this was the most obvious truth in the universe. Perhaps it was.
...Oh
Despite the skull-crushing tension, Dean couldn’t help but grin just a little, at the angel’s parted lips, tilted head and severely furrowed brow. He didn’t really blame Cas for needing convincing.
“Dean.”
Dean took a step towards the angel, emboldened by Cas’ curious choice of words.
“Tired of fighting. Tired of pretenses. Tired of duty. I try to do what’s right, but nothing is ever simple.” He trailed off into a weary sigh.  “It used to be
Dean was almost relieved that the sudden surge of shame flooding his system was potent enough to dilute the voracious pangs of desire echoing through his body, if only for a moment. It was a brief respite however, as Cas breached the remaining space left between them. The angel considered him, placid as ever, and framed a gentle hand around Dean’s sweat-sheened cheek. The other trailed down, solid and warm, until it slid over his trembling shoulder, and down to the arrow-wound in his side, trailing blessed relief in its wake. Dean felt every tiny movement like an earthquake threatening to shatter his heart.
“Moments of
Sam remembers now, the expression of righteous fury clouding Cas’ features after the taunting phone call, the likes of which he hadn’t seen since they’d first met the angel. How Cas, who was once Heaven’s greatest strategist, had stormed out of the bunker with barely a second thought - plan or consequences be damned - while he and Jack were left to haplessly scramble for weapons in his thundering wake. Arming themselves had proven pointless though, because weak as his Grace was lately, Cas hadn’t spared a single spark in razing the decrepit shack without a single hitch of hesitation. Like a tidal wave through a shattered dam, the angel had blasted the door in and growled his way through the comically-raised henchman eyebrows until nothing and no one were left. How the ceaseless hordes of evil underlings were even shocked anymore still baffled Sam.
It was the most he’d ever admitted to out loud, and he’d be dammed if he was about to elaborate.
Castiel had been. Or rather, enjoying the side-effects of his altered state a little too much to acknowledge it as a more pressing issue before it was too late. It wasn’t like
He licked his lips nervously while he let that settle in, before going on. "Look it was all real, okay? I just... What I meant was that I wish it hadn’t been a damned love spell that finally kicked me in the ass - I mean do you even know how stupid that is - I may never live it down, but the point is: I’ll fucking take it, okay? If it means that we- well, I’ll take it. ”
help on that front, celestial or otherwise), but he did know that Sam had fully 180’d from Disney to HBO.
didn’t feel as strange as he thought it would.
you if you don’t get the hose right now.”
“Your uh… your wings are still…” Dean muttered, jerking upright. He swallowed hard as he cast a shaking, accusatory finger at the twin shadows blooming behind Cas’ shoulders.
“I said no, dammit!” Dean barked, this time. His penance was instant as he folded himself over the wound in his side, wincing. He took a steadying breath.
Yeah okay, it's a cheesy-ass plot twist but whatever I went with it, ha! I never said I was a *good* writer. ;D
“I suppose I am,” he agreed with a shrug. The wings bounced in tandem.
To demonstrate the point, Cas knelt down and beat his wings with gusto, resulting in a wind-tunnel that almost knocked Dean off his feet. The exercise granted Cas about 4 feet of height above the ground before he was unceremoniously expelled into the grass like a bug from a windshield. He seemed a lot less concerned about the violent impact than Dean was, judging by the number of craters pockmarking the lawn. He was already brushing himself off by the time Dean reached him, helping hand and shit-eating grin in tow.
. What is
“Fuck,” Dean croaks into the fog. “That shitty hunt goin’ so sideways, and then him- with his fucking hands all over you, I-”
The idea had sprouted from memories of how Bobby had explained their miraculous return from the Wild Wild Unsanitary West in search of the Colt. He’d also hadn’t failed to recall how the surly old hunter had colourfully described the unpleasant experience as Cas pulling a “reverse Alien” on him - not something he was looking forward to. Still, Dean knew he was right, because Cas had visibly cringed at the proposition. He’d deal with the infuriating, self-immolating martyr later, for not bringing up this solution before he was literally on the verge of vaporization. Right now they had work to do.
“Of course, Dean,” the angel acquiesced, “though I’m…” His sentence trailed off as the steady pulse of wing-beats suddenly hitched a little.
,” he added after a few moments, “Such situations can be
Unthinkingly, he reached forward to wipe the dirt and pluck crushed dandelions from Cas’ skin, before moving to pick at the stray leaves he’d amassed in his disheveled hair. Cas stood stock still, though tilted his head slightly forward to allow Dean access, his gaze locked.
“Will you at least tell me why we’re summoning one of my more…
“Look Dean, I don’t care about your stupid hangups okay? I really don’t. But I do care that Cas looked really upset and I haven’t seen him all morning so I’m assuming you were an asshole and always being stuck in the middle of -
He’s already rolling up his sleeves with gusto, delighting in the idea of spending the afternoon outside and being useful with Cas at his side, even if it’s menial physical labour that’s involved. He’s already picturing the satisfaction of cracking a pair of cold beers once they’re done when he notices the angel’s expression. Castiel seems crestfallen. His wings have somehow folded themselves perfectly against the limited real estate of his back and there’s a curiously sheepish expression veiling his features.
“It’s… an ‘
“Should I be insulted that you don’t think I’ve figured out why we are working so hard to summon a cupid, Dean? The case with lovers going mad… I know you were hit by that rogue’s arrow. It isn’t ‘r
Castiel exhaled, finally seeming resigned. He nodded tightly.
Dean’s head aches terribly.
“It would have been unfair to you,” was all he said, very quietly. Dean only got a fleeting glance of the painful twist of his features before the angel was gone.
“Sorry,” Cas offered, his satisfied smirk looking anything but apologetic.
His smile was thin, but genuine.
“You’re acting like a child.”
Cas mutely nodded, but then leaned into the rare token, and Dean tried not to freak out too much at how nice that felt. It didn’t seem to soothe Cas’ cough much, but the angel didn’t seem to mind. In fact, Dean felt a smile tug at his lips when he noticed Cas rolling his forehead against his stomach, almost cat-like, so that his fingers might find a better angle at his scalp. Surreal as it was, Dean dug in generously, amused at the fact that even eternal wavelengths of celestial intent could recognize the value of a good old-fashioned head-rub.
“Didn’t have a taste for us humans yet, huh?”
“I would fix you, Dean” the angel promised breathlessly, all solemnity even as he flapped more and more strenuously.
He swallowed hard as he recalled the relief he felt in that damned warehouse, at seeing the angel’s features return to normal between his hands… to see the bloodshot frenzy finally drain from his sad eyes. He’d done exactly jackshit to help with that, but in that moment he’d been so immensely grateful that the guilt hadn’t even set in until much later.
The early morning was aglow with young sunlight tipping over the horizon, and while at first glance this podunk town had seemed completely unremarkable, its gently rolling hills and endless stretch of forests, now cast in rusted ambers and slowly rising dawn-mist, seemed to indicate otherwise. Small ponds dotted the landscape with a glowing sheen like broken mirror pieces, while tufts of lazy clouds shone brightly in the haze. It was beautiful, and Dean's imposter syndrome flared with a vengeance. He had no idea how he was supposed to deal with receiving such a wondrous gift.
Instinctively, Dean clenched every muscle in his body and attempted to release the angel’s wrists and ground himself, but he found that he couldn’t. He shot a terrified glare at Cas, who merely grinned in reply (the bastard), and tightened his hold on Dean’s forearms.
“So,” he teased, “Did you kiss Bobby?”
Dean hoped his jokingly-cocked eyebrow would successfully convey that he was kidding around my guy, my good buddy, and that hey, we’re all super-cool here with platonic kissing, bro-migo. Fortunately, Cas disarmed those frail mechanisms with a dose of his patented earnestness.
Dean scoured a hand over his weary, blood-smattered features. He was crusted in dried sweat and gods knew what else, and his weathered skin still crawled. He longed for a shower, but his feet remained solidly planted.
“I know Sam.” he conceded, barely above a whisper. “I know. But I can’t. Not like this. Please.”
It’s blindingly gorgeous outside. Dean blinks for a moment against the mid-morning sun casting a warm glow over the Kansas flatlands below. The air is cool and sweet with Spring blossoms... and probably pollen, which gives him just short of 5 minutes before he starts leaking like a faucet from all of his facial orifices. Still, even histamine-supercharged Dean can appreciate relishing in some daylight and fresh air; the stale, submarine-like depths of the Bunker can sometimes get a little claustrophobic.
“Please, Dean. Trust me.”
“What was that?”
Because as fate would have it,
“Yeah.” Dean agreed.
“You’re leaking mojo like a broken toilet here; save it for yourself, you idiot!” he berated him tepidly.
Okay so somewhere, somehow, for some reason, Cas was parading around half-naked, apparently on purpose. (Because no Big Bad Dean had ever encountered had taken up the fearsome habit of meticulously folding the clothes of its victims… not even the ones who
Dean was about to argue that - because Dean Winchester did
is what I was talking about,” Dean groused. “Ain’t good for business when we’re both constantly worryin' about each other.”
Cas regarded him calmly, the door clicking shut behind him. It was only then that Dean noticed (with some horror) how far Castiel had encroached into his sanctuary, and how his own arms had acted without permission to cage the angel's head against the wood. Still, Cas remained an unblinking portrait of serenity, unsurprisingly unruffled by the proximity. Either way, at this tantalizing range, his voice almost made Dean’s knees give out.
When Castiel’s focus reluctantly returned to Dean, the hunter found he was at his usual loss for words in these situations. Still, all drafts under his dead-guy robe aside, Dean was feeling particularly ballsy that morning. And well, if he could relieve Cas even minimally of all the grief and worry he carried, Dean would happily do what he could, even if it meant acquiescing to some obscure angel malarkey. For Cas, he would do almost anything.
“I only helped a little. You'll still require stitches and.... a
A heavy pause wedged its way between them before Dean found his words.
Though his Grace was impaired, the angel had that twitchy look about him that usually signified Dean would soon be talking to empty air, so he seized the rare occasion to press on.
“You might not like the answer” Cas reasoned softly.
“That’s
. Profound Bond and all. Warm, hug-happy badass Cas. Surely he couldn’t have -
“Yeah, I’m not surprised.” Dean confirmed darkly.
What the hell was he thinking? Dean’s attempts were damn near laughable, but he’d felt so- well. It didn’t matter. Cas was cured now. No more rabid red-eyed Hulk smashing, no more fever, and certainly no more need for Dean’s paltry human comforts. Rowena had seen to that with a few fancy words and a wave of her perfectly manicured fingers, before poofing off into oblivion. That was a problem that would surely bite them in the ass with all its ginger might later, but a more pressing one was at hand.
“I know, Dean,” Castiel replied, graveyard solemn.
Dean’s gaze flickered up, eyes burning and his jaw clenched under Cas’ hold. The angel’s gaze bore into him, shockingly ravenous and slightly unhinged. Dean gasped at the sight, which up to that point, had only existed in his most private dreams.
“Why didn’t you say something earlier!?” he scolded.
“Yes… I… Hmm.” he hummed thoughtfully.
He’d regained some semblance of stability for the first time since before his mother had burned on the ceiling, but had traded it for the next big bad as soon as he could get behind the wheel.
, where the person is
“Listen, you look about as ‘scene’ as a lumberjack, Dean. You’re gonna make us in ten seconds.”
“He doesn’t want you to, Cas, okay?” Sam pleaded, “
Oh, so much fluff.
Dean would usually have stopped short at such a spectacle of tanned skin, besmirched as it is, but tonight it brings no sense of awe.
“Shut up,” he warned preemptively, “I’m actually pretty good at mechanics, in case you forgot. Here,” Dean offered, face inelegantly red as he clamped his hands around Cas’ wrists tightly. The angel followed suit.
Castiel brought said limbs up between their faces, demonstrating the severe tremor rattling his fingers at his efforts to contain the holy light. Dean immediately tried to steady them in his.
” response as an olive branch. That's practically an act of treason, but the brat deserves it. Eventually, after puttering in place longer than is strictly natural, he relents to the sibling standoff with a sigh. It’s too goddamned early for Dean to be feeling like he’s been caught with his pants down (not in the fun way), and he’d really like to make an exit.
Castiel turned to leave, hastily buttoning up his wrinkled shirt and retrieving his shorn clothing from the floor. Dean was still catching his breath but managed to grab an armful of the angel, and spun him around.
“Cas, hey!
The offer was so unexpected that Dean froze for a few moments. There were layers to it he didn’t quite know what to do with, and honestly didn’t care to unravel just then. The only thought coming in crystal clear was how unusually vulnerable Cas looked in that moment, like it had taken everything out of him to ask… Like perhaps Dean had been correct to worry a little after all.
He begrudged himself the weakness, but Cas had become a constant. Family, though the term felt somewhat lacking, if he was honest. And maybe Dean resented him just a little bit, for becoming just another thing he didn’t deserve, which the universe would inevitably see fit to rip away from him or use against him.
, Dean. The curse makes him manifest stuff physically now sure, but he’s still an
bring himself to mind.
With a frustrated groan, Cas regained his bare feet, the gleaming wings blooming behind him innocently like anemones in a warm current. Their staggering reach made him appear to tower over Dean, but the impression was corrected by the irritated moue of the angel’s mouth hanging all too near, almost precisely at lip-level. Dean cleared his throat, looking away while Cas’ eyes narrowed.
(even half of one) anywhere it didn’t want to go. He’d have fared better playing tug-of-war against a charging elephant.
His treacherous heart hurled itself against his rib cage in a fit of Pavlovian glory, and Dean practically tore out a stitch in his haste to leave the bathroom.
His sulking was nevertheless interrupted by the muted sound of fabric being draped; a soft flutter of air. Before he could process it, a soft expanse of heated weight settled atop him as the bed lurched in all its rusted, squeaky glory. Feathers tickled his nose, but the smile cresting upon his face in the dark was for vastly different reasons.
“Yeah, great. So I’ll let you get on with your uh… what is that,
“I don’t understand,” Cas groused, his sharp blue eyes pinning Sam for all he was worth. “Where’s Dean?”
Before he could talk himself out of it, he settled himself carefully behind the angel and, cheeks pinking, wrapped the blanket around his shoulders. He was grateful that Cas couldn’t really see him from this vantage because his face outright began to scorch once he’d decided not to retract his arms. Instead, he squeezed the Cas’ solid figure with what he hoped was a fortifying hug. This was perilously outside the scope of things he’d thought possible with Cas, but he was encouraged when the angel seemed to melt back against him with a relieved sigh, and gently squeezed his arm in response. Nevermind that Dean’s heart was thrumming faster than a hummingbird’s wing, or that Cas smelled so fucking good - like sticky summer thunderstorms - that he was tempted to throw caution to the wind and bury his face in the guy’s neck like an amorous tick. For now, he managed to content himself with the warm, comforting press of closeness. It was far more than he deserved, but he was glad to do it for Cas’ sake.
“No it’s fine, Bobby’s for sure got some old grimoires on it, I remember-
“You know what, nevermind. It’s too early for this macho overcompensation thing.”
As though to demonstrate, he extends said appendages out to their fullest capacity, angling them towards the sun like some sort of giant cormorant while he indulges in a lazy stretch. Dean is briefly enthralled by the buffet of taught golden skin, but miraculously manages to cast his gaze towards the looming wall of glistening black feathers, then back to the angel’s face. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Castiel so relaxed. It’s a rare and jarring contrast to his usual intensity.
Cas’ tense voice barely registered over the clatter of the slammed door, but Dean was deeply relieved to hear it, nonetheless. The breath he'd been holding for hours finally escaped, and it was an effort to keep himself from trembling too hard. He kicked off his boots and dropped his duffel without ceremony, and hung up his coat beside the trench by the door. Soiled weapons clanked in cacophonous protest, but he’d just have to clean them later.
Satisfied, Cas’ hands resumed their gentle work, stroking his tired muscles with care.
Dean frowns in confusion.
“I’m glad you’re still here, for what it’s worth,” Dean added.
Had he not been so preoccupied with actually
“Dammit Cas, it’s not that,” he scrambled peevishly, staring at the side of Cas’s crumpled expression.
He rustled up what courage he had left, took one of the angel’s hands in both of his and brought the battle-rough knuckles to his lips. He kissed them with slow reverence, so there could be no mistaking his intent.
Donning an unmistakably proud glint in his eye, Castiel wordlessly extended a hand to help him back up.
“He’s on the roof,” Sam announces from behind his book. He’s got his giraffe gams comfortably parked on the maps table, and only bothers to glance up at Dean insofar as a long-suffering eye roll is capable of doing so.
Cas glowering into his ass. Dean’s liquor-drenched heart hammered in his chest, the damn fool thing, despite his best efforts at keeping his composure.
He maneuvered around the motel’s spectacularly drab units with well-honed stealth, creeping silently towards the back yard. He peered around the corner, which gave onto a small grassy clearing - complete with sun-bleached plastic chairs that hadn’t seen a bum in at least two decades - which sloped into a dense wood.
The angel’s mournful eyes were resolutely trained heavenwards as he spoke, and Dean was beginning to regret this entire attempt.
“I just wanna help. I don’t like not knowing how to, especially in our line of work.”
“Thanks for breakfast,” Sam muttered with a distinct lack of gratitude. He slammed the fridge door and made a dramatic show of retrieving his grilled tomato egg sandwich.
“Sammy would put you under a microscope, you know. You should be glad it’s just me here.”
“You’re back.”
The angel paused for a loaded moment, and took a steadying breath.
“You’re welcome.”
“Very well.”
Dean would have laughed but he was too drunk on trying to map out Cas’ pulse point (if he even had one) with his nose.
He’s happy of course. Ecstatic really, because his brother’s ears are tinged pink and Cas seems to be grinning the best he can while his lips are otherwise engaged, and goddamnit, Sam is man enough to admit that it’s all pretty fucking adorable.
- not two - and for a moment, Dean wonders if someone has spiked his coffee. Dean - god help him, is just a mortal man, and he's barely grown accustomed to processing two of those gut-punching things. This dramatic addition seems completely unfair. Castiel now looks the part of the stained-glass Demi-god most humans assume angels are; a vision from mythological text whose presence Dean is definitely unworthy of. It’s like he’s back in that infamous barn all over again; with considerably less stabbing.
There was no mistaking it: Cas was ecstatic. His blue eyes flickered from Dean to the sky with a kind of unrestrained joy Dean had rarely seen on him. It was like a revelation.
The curve was steep, but Dean had been learning how to pick his battles. More importantly, he was learning that here, he didn’t always have to fight.
Dean Articulate Winchester, he was.
Dean obeyed, swallowing hard. He fastidiously buried that precious little discovery somewhere deep and forbidden while the spark of fire in his belly roared.
“Stop” Cas commanded him, his gravelly voice low and threadbare. Even in his reduced state, there was was the faintest trace of smity-ness in the tone, and damn if Dean didn’t feel a hot twinge in his belly about it. Unfair.
“Well, fairytales often have origins rooted in - You...
“I know, Dean,” Cas replies warmly. “But I promise I’ll be careful.”
A familiar flapping sound, like laundry hung out to dry in a light breeze, draws his attention from the right.
“This is quite satisfying!” he grinned.
Sam should have seen it when Dean realized that the trenchcoat had been ruined in the fight to get him out of there - because of course there’d been
Perhaps encouraged by the relief, Dean grasped onto Cas’ wrist then, and pulled him into a sudden hug. Cas went rigid with surprise, but Dean held on long enough for him to relax into it and return it. After a few moments, he’d even buried his face in the crook of Dean’s neck. It seemed like Cas had needed this too, and that made Dean squeeze a bit harder. He pressed in until he could quell the burning in his eyes and throat and convince himself that Cas was actually still here.
He barely flinches when that familiar pop of ozone fills the damp air, underscored by a rustle of feathers.
Rubbing the sleep from his eyes with the butt of his palms, he grimly took stock of the motel room.
A flare of red hair scurrying for the Impala interrupted his somber contemplations however, and a flash of recognition compelled him to unlock the doors.
Obviously there was no way in any dimension he was going to go with that but-
The words he wanted to say stayed lodged in his throat, sliced deadly and rough like uncut diamonds. All he had power left to do was to retreat a few scant inches while the world flushed bright with every electric touch of the angel’s fingers.
want it, Cas. For so long. Still do."
“Perhaps if you hadn’t left the motel bar so abruptly and subsequently locked yourself in the bathroom for hours, my concern would be less intrusive.”
...Freakin’ angels.
It’s only when his forehead touches another that he pauses in his fall, desperately enthralled despite the fresh blood painting his brow.
Mortification aside, Dean had no idea how he’d managed to help raise such a grade A human, and he let himself feel goddamned proud for a second. He gave Sam a grudging nod.
...This
Dean sighed.
There’s a subtle crinkle in the angel’s posture at being acknowledged, as though he expected otherwise. He shrugs, but doesn’t turn. Hungry for distraction, Dean relishes the small movement. He maps out the tightness of Cas’ jaw, the solid line of those shoulders steeled in concern even as he sits quietly against the grimy tile. Cas is feigning calm as much as Dean is; it’s a familiar dance by now.
. They seemed to flap slowly of their own volition, perhaps to instinctively shield the angel from the intrusion of gruff hands. Dean hesitantly laid a palm on one, honestly surprised at its luxuriant softness, but wasted no time. Meeting only a little resistance insofar as how the huge fuckers were supposed to bend, he gathered and folded the inky appendages against Cas’ back as carefully as he could, until he was finally able to (painstakingly) turn the angel onto his back. It was surreal, even for a man accustomed to dealing with all things impossible on the daily.
“Maybe not entirely but, I wasn’t… not myself, either.”
Resigned, he flicked on the bathroom light.
“I know buddy, but trust me, that’s just the mortal coil talking,” Dean offered, awkwardly caressing his head, mostly because he’d started and dammit he wasn’t gonna chicken out now. "B'sides, I’ll take you with a conscience anyday over being an obedient little angelbot, you get me?”
Dean gawked at the beautiful present.
“Of all the things I have seen, sunrise is one of my favourites, now that I am allowed to indulge in saying so out loud” said Cas, with a solemn reverence that washed over the hunter like a warm tide. "I'll have to return to my post soon, but I wanted to show this to you."
“I’m just saying,” Sam insisted, “you haven’t been watching from the emotionally-constipated sidelines for the past ten years like I have. The guy loves you. It’s stupidly obvious. Only someone with your level of self-loathing could miss that, because I know that you’re not THAT dumb.”
“Stop that,” Cas growled, recovering lightning-fast.
“Hey,” he says gently, “If it’s not cool, we won’t do it, Cas. I don’t want to infringe on your angel modesty or whatever.”
Cas?”
Shit, hadn’t Dean just fixed this? Or was shredding feathers an international declaration of flying accountant war?
Dean bitterly resisted the urge to swipe his fingers over the handprint seared into his shoulder. It was time to stop blubbering, and just accept that despite all they’d been through together, perhaps he was just a utilitarian convenience to Cas. Because Angel Things superseded Dean and his pouting every time.
He could hear the dull throb of electronic music even through the thick, chromed steel of the Impala.
“I swear Cas, if you pull my shoulders out of their sockets…”
Cas’ sharply raised eyebrow egged him on, but how was he supposed to answer?
“It’s okay Dean. I told you, you don’t need to explain.”
“I overreacted.”
He tapped his face, called his name… but there was no response, for long enough that Dean was considering calling his erratic yeti of a brother for back-up. He swallowed the thought down, owing to the fact that Sam lately had been even more of a mess than Cas, just of a different sort. And Dean well, he wasn’t too good at emotional multitasking. He opted instead to grab Cas’ unmoving shoulders and shake them, probably more violently than was advisable for any human. Despite all his grievances with anything remotely celestial lately, his heart pounded with dread. Dean was always a little irrational when it came to Cas, even though the guy was technically supposed to be ungankable. It was just… with all the evil things in the world (and their uncle) doing their damnedest to test that theory lately, Dean shook harder.
