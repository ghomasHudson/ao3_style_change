"Hurry up!" Called Harry as he sat in the hallway. Sherlock and John weren't ready yet and he was getting worried. The last thing he wanted to be was late on the first day. Finally, Sherlock and John emerged from their rooms. They both took some paracetamol then John made Harry his lunch. The left at 7:00, leaving half an hour to complete the six-minute walk to St Mary's Bryanston Square Primary School. It took all of Harry's self-control to not sprint ahead of John and Sherlock. Instead, he held Sherlock's hand and walked beside them.
"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilt potion away with a wave on his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?"
"Is this all for me?" asked Harry, incredulous. The plate had a piece of jam toast, a couple slices of apple, and a glass of orange juice. Not a lot of food, but to Harry, it seemed like a feast. Sherlock cursed the Dursleys under his breath. Who could let a child live like this and still sleep at night? It was disgusting.
Eventually, it came to four o’clock and the five of them headed back to the flat, laden with presents.
"Platform nine and three quarters, located in the barrier between platforms nine and ten," said Harry, thinking they probably should've written that on the ticket.
Both Sherlock and Harry were ecstatic. They were in a taxi to the courthouse and neither could stop smiling. When they arrived, they practically sprinted into the building.
In the centre of the back wall was a large alcove lined with bookshelves, within it was a marble statue of a woman wearing a tiara. The rest of the room was covered in bookshelves and massive windows allowing sunlight to shine on the students working in various armchairs dotted around the room.
"Woah," said Harry, stepping inside the room. "This is all mine?" he asked Griphook. The goblin nodded. There was a money pouch on the floor. Harry picked it up and shoved some coins into it. It felt weird knowing that he was holding more money than all his pocket money from the past eight years combined.
It was a long time before John and Sherlock came back. Ten hours, to be precise. Harry spent each and every one of them pacing in the living room, stopping only to brew a cup of coffee whenever he felt even a little tired. While it was not unusual for a case to take this long, there had never been magic involved before.
Even though every student was at a different level, they were all given the same tasks and the same help, though Harry saw that the better you were at the subject, the more attention you would get from the teacher.
"Your dad got a bit drunk and into a fight. He's not going to want to move until tomorrow, so we're staying here for the night," said Sherlock. Harry nodded, unsurprised. Sherlock showed him where his room was, then left him to his own devices. Harry picked up one of the books he had bought and started to read, staying in his room for the rest of the night, reading until the next morning.
"I'm adopted," said Harry. "My old family name is Potter." This made both Madam Malkin and Draco gasp.
"I'm going to have a chat with the Prime Minister," said Mycroft, taking his phone out and walking away.
Many tears were shed that day, by Harry, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, Molly Hooper and her new boyfriend, Jim, and the grooms themselves. Even Mycroft looked as if he might smile. The loudest sniffles were from the Holmes parents. Quite the opposite from their cold children, the Holmes parents were two of the happiest and emotional people Harry had ever met. It was quite funny.
"What the fuck," breathed Harry as he stepped through the doorway, walking in between towering piles of gold. He went over to one of the walls where a jewel-encrusted dagger was hanging next to a meter-long sword. On a shelf right next to it was a large collection of knives and other daggers. He picked up a small silver dagger with a serpent wrapped around the hilt. The sheath was covered in runes and jewels. Harry could feel the magical energy radiating from the runes. He pulled the blade out, admiring the shining blade.
As they reached the edge of the grounds, McGonagall instructed all of them to grab the kettle she was holding. They did so and were immediately swept off the ground, spinning through the air. Harry’s hand felt glued to the kettle, and as the spinning got faster, he felt as if he was going to be sick.
When the train finally slowed to a stop, Harry knew that Hermione was going to be one of his closest friends before the month was out.
"Don't go in the restricted section. At least, don't go there during the day." Harry smiled and went back over to his friends, picking up one of Hermione's books and starting to read.
“I dunno. Electricity ‘n’ stuff.” Draco huffed but stopped asking, instead pointing out times where the show was wrong and there had been magic involved.
"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?" When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!"
Every day of that fortnight was spent in almost panic-inducing anxiety. Harry was terrified that Dumbledore would escape, or wouldn’t be charged, or cast another spell and get Harry sent back to the Dursleys. He’d started having nightmares, what little he could remember of his aunt and uncle haunting his every resting moment. All thoughts of the Philosopher’s Stone were pushed from his mind, replaced with him waking up in the middle of the night, terrified that he was back in the cupboard.
As they walked past the cupboard under the stairs, Sherlock noticed that the door was regularly slammed and it had a padlock. He moved closer and heard a quiet sobbing coming from within.
"And I you. Would you mind helping me get my trunk in here?" Harry nodded and the two of them left the car to grab Draco's trunk.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
"Why is this castle so big?" he asked no one in particular when he sat puffing on his bed. He went through all of his pockets and his entire trunk before finally finding the small card. He flipped it over and read it, tucking all the information about Nicolas Flamel, the alchemist, in his mind palace. Once he had read it, he shoved the card in his pocket and went back to the library, finding as many books as he could on alchemy, before sitting in a small corner and reading. He stayed there until the sun set and the librarian yelled at him because the library was closed.
“I was just gonna tell you your Dad won’t stop mailing me.” Malfoy turned and stormed out of the hall. Who was this guy pretending to be Harry’s dad? Was it Sherlock? Harry thought about it, trying to place Sherlock in his mind.
"Here we are," said Harry as they came before the large wooden door. Harry checked that the hall was empty before whispering "alohomora". The door clicked open and they hurried inside, closing it softly behind them.
"Brother mine, could you be so kind as to do some research into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry? Don't laugh, they have been plaguing Harry with letters. Ask Lestrade if you don't believe me." Sherlock hung up with a sigh. "He's gonna look into it. He'll text if he finds anything." Harry and John nodded. Harry felt slightly better. If anyone could find out about Hogwarts, it was Mycroft.
I finished my other projects (finally), so I should be returning to semi-regular updates. Plus the holidays start soon, so I might have more time. Anyway, thank you so much for waiting! It's insane how many of you there are, like, I can't believe it. Thank you so much :)
"The Ritz, most likely. There was a rather large sum of money transferred to my account this morning by my brother, Mycroft. I have a feeling he might be in on it too. He does adore Harry."
John Watson did come back the next day. In fact, he moved in the next day. Within a week, he was basically a second father to Harry. He was constantly astounded by the boy's intellect, even more than he was by Sherlock's. Both Sherlock and Harry found this very entertaining. However, there was one thing that only Harry was picking up on. It seemed that John was slowly falling for the mysterious detective. Harry, though not particularly good at it, had watched enough crappy soaps to see when love was in the air. He had confronted Sherlock about it, and the detective had gone bright red. It was funny to see them dancing around each other, John with a new girlfriend just about every week, and Sherlock with his emotionless facade.
McGonagall reached the door she was walking towards and ushered the first-years inside. It was a rather small room and all the students were standing rather too close for comfort. They were muttering and giggling, as children often did, only stopping when McGonagall started to talk.
The week following Harry leaving the Hospital Wing was probably the weirdest one he’s had in a long time. For one thing, Ron kept on trying to talk to him about things that he was fairly sure never happened, and Malfoy kept on trying to talk to him, not insult him, just talk. If that wasn’t strange enough, Harry felt strangely guilty every time he insulted the blond git, as if the hate was unfounded. It wasn’t though, Harry was sure of it. He was sure there was a reason that they hated each other. If only he could remember it…
"Why aren't you writing all this down?" he snapped at the class. Everyone grabbed their quills and began scribbling down everything that had been said.
"That is not relaxing, John. The police are incompetent." Sherlock continued pacing. John got a notification on his phone. It was from Lestrade.
The weeks went by without any sort of disturbance, so as the Christmas holidays drew nearer, Harry had no issue leaving the school, to see his family again. Sherlock and John were just as excited, and the three Holmes couldn’t wait.
Even though he’d never attended a full lesson, Harry’s potion skills were incredible. He credited the immense amount of chemistry he’d done as a child and the hours spent reading potion books. Harry had made a few adjustments to the tracking potion, not only making it faster to brew, but also to make the pin adjust every single time the headmaster moved, allowing a sort of gps to be on him at all times. Harry also filled it with spells to override any anti-tracking spells that the headmaster might have thought of.
"Because you're never going to see them again." The look of joy was so absolute on the little boys face, it made Sherlock himself want to smile.
“Bold of you to assume I paid attention to any classes last year, least of all History of Magic,” said George. Hermione sighed.
They were immediately met with the strong stench of alcohol. Harry wrinkled his nose in disgust and concentrated on the people milling around.
"My dear Frair, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name you know, and he's not even really a ghost - I say what are you all doing here?"
The taxi slowed to a stop outside of an old, grey hospital. Sherlock got out his phone and texted Molly Hooper.
Sorry, this took so long and that it's so short. I rewrote this chapter several times, stuff happened and I wrote less often. And if stuff doesn't make sense, point it out. I wrote most of this in the middle of the night.
The front of his trolley collided with the barrier and Harry expected to crash. Instead, the trolley passed through the wall as if it wasn't there. The rest of him followed. Harry squeezed his eyes shut when the brick was inches from his face, but forced himself to open them when there was no collision. The sight that greeted him was incredible.
"I have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
"I could've, but the buffet breakfast finishes in forty minutes, and the waffles here are supposed to be incredible," said Harry. John sighed and ruffled his hair.
"It's bewitched to look like the sky outside, I read about it in Hogwarts; A History," whispered Hermione. Harry tore his eyes away and looked around the rest of the hall. There were hundreds of students sitting around four long tables. All the teachers were sitting on one table at the very end of the hall. Harry recognised the old man sitting in the middle as Albus Dumbledore.
"And my uncle owns the British government." The conversation ended with Sherlock receiving a withering glare from McGonagall.
The flat of Sherlock Holmes was a messy one. Why bother tidying when it was almost impossible to forget where everything was? There were clothes and papers strewn across the floor. What little carpet could be seen was stained with chemicals. Some parts of it had been burnt through entirely, revealing the cheap wooden flooring beneath. There were clear paths that lead from the front door to the kitchen and to the small bed.
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate, feeling surprisingly hungry. The pumpkin pasties must have been ages ago.
Because school for Harry was starting the next day, there was little time for John and Sherlock to discuss the events of the morning. They were both fine with that. Harry had been looking forward to school since he had moved in with Sherlock. Learning was such a fun thing for him, and Sherlock had said that if he got good scores in everything he would be allowed to start working cases and going to crime scenes. That was the best motivation for Harry and he made a vow to work as hard as possible on every subject.
thank you so much, honestly, for sticking around. you have no idea how much it means to me to see people reading and enjoying what i write, no matter how awful it seems to me. it’s a massive help in keeping this story going, and where would a writer be without their readers?
A few hours later, Harry was sitting on Sherlock's bed playing with his new glasses as Sherlock put together a bed. He had been trying for quite some time and had almost achieved his goal when he dropped a plank onto his toe. He swore. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harry shrink back into a ball, covering his head with his arms. Sherlock immediately felt guilty.
When John walked in to check on him, Harry was deciding whether or not to take his revolver. He finally settled on leaving it behind. If he was going to be attacked, something he hoped wouldn't happen, he would just use his wand.
Sherlock’s eyes flickered toward him, and it was only when their gazes made contact that he turned his head. “The news cycle has most likely caught wind of the arrest by now, including who, exactly, ensured it.” He waved a hand vaguely in John’s direction, and a tantalizing smirk slashed through his sharply handsome features. “You may get your five seconds of fame soon, John Watson.”
“Problem?” He looked so innocent, again. Golden light and long limbs and a carefully fond expression.
The cabbie stirred, and John heightened the pressure of his knee in warning. Blood dripped from his chin onto the cabbie’s sweater, and he quickly wiped the gathering red off his lips and chin, which only smeared it. He licked his lips and it tasted of metal. He spit, cringing.
“Oh, brilliant,” John said, sounding like it was anything but. He thought of his face being on the news, or even just his name, and it was the same building annoyance as a faucet that would not stop dripping. He humphed out a small noise to display his discontent.
The cabbie’s finger shuddered on the trigger, wavering. John stared down the barrel, the primal, instinctive part of his brain screaming out in alarm at the familiar view of black; a short tunnel with a deadly bullet, shooting off in a violent, half-second frenzy and leaving behind nothing but blood splatter and gunsmoke.
He leaned heavily on the cane as the stranger came to a stop, his eyes devouring the scene with such intense passion John believed for a moment he might actually cry out in triumph. They passed over John with barely an acknowledgement, like rain over his skin, which was a little strange because he was sure he made something of a spectacle, bloody and bruised and… cane-equipped as he was. But there’s also a murderer at their feet, so he could understand it.
He slipped out of the door after she had departed. Sherlock was leaning against the wall beside the room, his coat collar popped up over his cheekbones, glaring a hole into the empty space of the hallway. John’s cane hung limply from his hand, the other one stuffed into his pocket.
“Did I say that aloud?” John asked incredulously, then whispered, more to himself than to Sherlock, “Christ, I really am going ‘round the bend.”
Apparently that was not quite the response Sherlock had hoped for. Microexpressions. Slight retraction from John, tightening at the corner of his lips and eyes. John didn’t know what this meant, and swallowed, watching Sherlock watch him. Then Sherlock agreed, “Yes. It’s late. Though you don’t sleep much.”
Sherlock laughed then, and even though it was likely at John, John found himself enraptured by his movements. He rested his head back against the car, displaying his long, pale neck to the air, and his Adam’s apple bobbed as a low chuckle bubbled up through his chest. There was a quiet discoloration of the skin beneath his ear, striped over his neck like a paint stroke. He wondered what caused it. He swallowed.
The man seemed a little unsure, looking like he had stuck his foot in his mouth, but he spoke surely, “Yes.”
(As the police car faded from view, Sherlock dropped his forehead into the heel of his palm. That was horrifyingly awkward. A warmth danced on his cheeks, and he cringed at himself. When it’s required, he’s usually better at chatting people up. It’s rather rude that he can’t do it now that it’s personal interest. Really. Abysmal.)
Sherlock stared at him, his attention intense, and John absently snuck a hand beneath the confines of his two layered sleeve to rub at the faded webs of scars. Slowly, Sherlock said, “You took down a murderer, despite a very clear physical disadvantage. I have a hunch that you’ve been rather flippant with your life - you display more self neglecting habits than I do, which is rather impressive -”
Grimacing, Sherlock answered, “Social niceties. They should have just told you ‘no’ outright, though I see that you’re under no delusions of follow up.”
“I’m… well, I’m going on intuition, to an extent, I’ll admit,” Sherlock mumbled bitterly, “but am I wrong?” He raised his eyebrows pointedly, a smirk tugging at his lips.
“We should go. My dads’ll be home soon,” he said, walking back to the Leaky Cauldron. Everyone followed after him and arrived back at the flat only a few minutes before John and Sherlock. Everyone rushed up to Harry’s room and picked up various books to make themselves look busy.
Harry woke to the sun streaming down on his face. He scrunched his eyes and turned over, wishing he'd stayed awake long enough to close the bed curtains the night before.
When Sherlock and John finally came back, Harry was very happy to see them, but unbelievably annoyed at the sender of the letters. He gave his dads a day to settle back in, then told them all about the letters. They laughed at first, then got annoyed at the sender too. They decided not to do anything though, and instead decided to wait it out and see what would happen on the 31st. A date that just so happened to be Harry's birthday.
"Because you are the boy who lived," answered McGonagall. She was holding a stick in her hand and she tapped it against a brick. It must have been a magic wand because the brick wriggled around, then dropped out of the wall. The hole that it left began to grow and grow until the four of them were standing before an archway.
Eventually, the boats stopped alongside a kind of underground harbour. Everyone clambered out onto the rocks, Neville tripping over the uneven ground. Harry and Draco helped him up before rushing back to join the group in front of a massive wooden door. Hagrid raised his fist and knocked on the door three times. It opened almost instantly and behind it stood Professor McGonnogal, as stern-looking as ever.
"That's a nice owl," said McGonagall when they left the shop. Harry smiled at her and inspected the owl properly now that they were in light.
The interior was unlike any bus Harry had seen before. Instead of a few dozen matching seats, firmly attached to the floor, there were dozens of mismatched chairs scattered around. A few of them had fallen over, a couple contained a witch or wizard, and several were lying on the floor next to their previous occupants. Harry decided against sitting and instead braced himself against the wall as the bus took off.
“Onto Diagon Alley,” declared Fred, marching ahead of the rest towards the leaky cauldron. A few people looked at them oddly as they strolled through the streets, but they didn’t care.
"Do you need some help with that?" Draco asked. He didn't wait for an answer before helping to lift Harry's trunk into the train. The second they had it on a rack, both of them let go of it and hugged each other.
“The basement one’s empty, right? I’m pretty sure parts of it are furnished already.” John nodded and the seven of them left the station and hailed a couple of taxis. For Sherlock’s sake, Fred and George drove with John, though they still pestered the poor man with hundreds of questions on the long journey to 221b Baker Street.
"The ... Um ... Door. It won't stay closed," he said. Sherlock held out his hand for the key and Mr Dursley slowly placed it in his palm. Sherlock unlocked the door and was appalled to see a young child, no more than three, huddled up in the corner, hugging himself and crying. Sherlock turned around and punched Mr Dursley in the face. Mr Dursley cried out in pain and Greg Lestrade ran inside.
“After class,” he replied through a yawn. Hermione nodded, though still looked worried. Harry knew they might start asking about the dreams, and the last thing he wanted was them to think he was some sort of… he couldn’t think of the word. Harry had an odd feeling that he would’ve known, if only something was… different? He couldn’t be sure.
"Canticum." The room was once again filled with soft music and the three-headed dog that had been growling at him plopped down on the ground and started snoring. Luckily for Harry, he missed the trapdoor and Harry was able to open it and peer into the darkness.
Thank you so much to everyone that has read it! You're all awesome! And any suggestions on what should happen would be great! (I have some vague ideas that can't be implemented at the moment)
A long car ride later, Harry, Sherlock, John, and Professor McGonagall were stood outside an old pub. There was a faded sign that read 'The Leaky Cauldron'. McGonagall pushed open the door and waited for the others to follow. Harry grabbed his fathers' hands and pulled them into the pub.
"That doesn't sound too bad. Though I think he wants to control every aspect of the school. The first person he sent to take me to Diagon Alley insulted my dads and said they weren't my real parents, while also seeming like a really nice guy, and I reckon Dumbledore had a hand in it."
Every day he sent a letter to Draco. Even though they had only met once, they soon became good friends. Draco was the first proper friend had ever had, and Harry was the only friend Draco had that hadn't been chosen by his parents. Both of them were unbelievably excited to meet up and start school at the end of the month.
"No. I know a spell that could help find him though," said Harry, pulling out his wand. "What's its name?"
"Accio Trevor," said Harry, his wand glowing bright gold. The girl looked at it in shock. A few moments later, a green thing flew through the air and landed in Harry's outstretched hand. Trevor the toad croaked quietly and Harry cast a few healing spells just in case.
Really sorry, but I edited a few parts that were really annoying me and filled in a couple of plot holes as well as fixing a few inconsistencies. Tell me if I missed anything. Chapter 17 should be coming pretty soon.
John looked slightly frightened by the goblins and kept his hand clasped firmly on Harry's shoulder. Sherlock was having the time of his life, examining every weak point and every way that the bank could be broken into. He studied every jewel and coin from afar, calculating the approximate wealth of wizardkind.
Also, I realise these past couple chapters have been pretty dull, but the story should start properly soon.
"Mycroft. So you've found out more about the school? What do you mean wizards? Are you quite sure? There's no such thing as magic, brother mine. I don't really care what the Prime Minister says, the man's crazy. Magic is impossible. Call me again when you find some real information." Sherlock hung up and flopped onto the sofa.
"I've already told you, the name is familiar, but I can't remember why," said Hermione exasperatedly. Hermione was going to say something more, but stopped when she saw two redheads approaching.
"No," said Griphook. "The wizards did this. They do not trust us to protect their riches. We do not need this dragon." Harry felt sick. This was the society he was joining.
Upon seeing these things, Sherlock Holmes decided to investigate. These people were hiding something, and he was determined to find out what it was. The opportunity to do just that presented itself only a few months later. A murder on Privet Drive, the very same street the Dursley's lived on.
"Yeah," said Harry as he took off his glasses. He snapped them in half then raised his wand "oculus reparo." Once again, his wand glowed bright gold. The glasses immediately joined back up and were whole once more. Harry noticed that a lot of the chips and scratches had also been fixed, and the loose hinge was working as it should.
"You know we can do magic now," he said, bringing out his wand. Harry smiled and bright his out too, whispering the spell to activate the runes. Each of them lit up with a bright golden glow, then faded slightly, though kept on emitting a slight light.
“I doubt that,” said George when Draco explained that real witches and wizards would get caught on purpose in the Salem Witch Trials.
"Well," said Harry, "until you can get over your grudge with a dead man, you are not going to be able to give me an adequate education, so I don't think I'll continue this class." Harry shoved his quill back into his bag and walked out of the classroom, down the hall, and into the corridor that held the Slytherin common rooms. He stood outside the concealed door for a while before turning on his heel and walking to the library. This seemed as good of a time as any to work on his homework.
"Okay. You guys try and find a place to stay, and we'll send some officers to inspect your flat." He grabbed his phone and began calling officers together. John pulled out his phone and began looking for hotels with vacancies. He found one and booked a room, then the three Holmes left the building and hailed a taxi.
"Firs'-years! Firs'-years! Over here!" Rubeus Hagrid yelled. The massive man towered over everyone on the platform, a sort of beacon for those that had never set foot in this station before.
"Sure," said Harry, examining the card and locking the information into a new room in his mind palace, this one purely devoted to Dumbledore. Harry had a feeling that there was a lot to learn about his headmaster, and that quite a lot of it would be things the man would rather not become public knowledge.
And thank you all so much for reading. Updates are slowing down because I suddenly lost all motivation to write this, hence the rewriting and editing.
“That’s gross,” said Harry, chucking the dead frog out of the window. It landed in a passing garbage truck.
"But how would he get in undetected?" asked Harry. George was about to reply, but was interrupted by a nervous-looking first year.
"How have you been, Harry?" Dumbledore asked as Harry walked in. "Is Slytherin treating you well, or do you want to transfer?"
"I am never drinking coffee again," he muttered to himself. It may be nice in the moment, but it was not worth it. He sighed and clenched his fists. There were worse things that could happen, but when you can hear and feel your heart beating way faster than it's supposed to, things start to seem pretty goddamn bad.
"Is there mind-reading magic?" Harry asked Draco as they walked back from Dumbledore's office one day, Harry rubbing his temples in an attempt to soothe his headache.
"I don't want them to drag me home," explained Draco when they ducked behind a piled of boxes to avoid the older Malfoys. "Where are your parents?"
“It’ll be fine, ‘Mione,” Draco assured her. Fred and George, both of whom had become close friends with the first-year trio, were beyond excited.
“The person. They had, umm… er… I can’t remember,” said Hermione sadly. Harry looked at her oddly, until that conversation also slipped from his mind. He checked his watch.
It took three days of paperwork and watching the headmaster to secure a court date. It was two weeks away.
By the third day, Harry was so tired he was unfazed when Peeves the resident poltergeist snuck up behind him, invisible, and grabbed his nose before screeching "GOT YOUR CONK!" Unfortunately, Harry had been too tired to do his hair that morning and his fringe shifted, revealing the lightning scar on his forehead. One kid saw it and cried out,
Harry looked at her and did a few quick deductions. She was a teacher and had been for a long time. She was also a deputy headmistress. Harry remembered the letter.
Hey, sorry, school’s been really busy and I’ve been working on a lot of things recently, but I’m slowly getting back into it. Not making any promises, but I should hopefully speed up slightly.
"Oi! You are Harry Potter!" exclaimed Tom. The chatter in the pub stopped and people started craning their necks to get a look at Harry.
"Welcome, new students and their parents. Here at St Mary's Bryanston Primary School, we believe in hard work, integrity, courage, curiosity, and compassion." The lady droned on and on, Harry zoned out after doing a quick deduction. She was in her late thirties, with two, no three, young children and a golden retriever. She was having an affair with . . . Harry looked around the room . . . the deputy headmaster. Harry stifled a yawn and decided this would be the perfect time to work on his Mind Palace. At the moment it was just an unfurnished 221b, but that didn't have enough rooms, so he was redesigning it to better fit his purpose.
"Father has been doing it his whole life and he turned out fine," said Draco. Harry stifled a laugh, causing Draco to glare at him. "It's an easy way to practice Occulemency, the way you keep Legilimens out of your head." Harry stopped laughing at that.
Somehow, even when the taxi had pulled up and the trunks were being unloaded, Hermione, Fred, and George were still asking questions.
"I guess I should go," he said, getting up and leaving. The second he closed the door behind him and whispered "Finite Incantatum." he heard the dog wake up and start scratching at the door. Harry walked back down to his dormitory, not bumping into a single teacher.
Harry kept on looking through the shelves until he found a silver revolver, much like the one Sherlock used, only way cooler. The grip was lacquered wood, the silver barrel covered in runes, and the trigger and hammer were pure gold.
Hermione dropped the book down on a nearby table with a loud thud before opening it and flicking through the pages, stopping around halfway through.
"Maybe you will," said the dragon. Harry took a step back in shock and looked at his companions to see if they had heard it. "They cannot hear me, young one. You were blessed with serpent-tongue. You can speak to and understand all snakes, and all dragons willing to listen."
They stayed up until midnight like they always did on Harry's birthday. When the clock struck twelve, John and Sherlock wished him Happy Birthday and apologised for not having a cake. Harry didn't mind of course. He could imagine that if he was still with the Dursleys he would be lucky if they acknowledged his birthday.
None of the ten or so students working in the common room looked up as he walked through the room and into his dormitory. He flopped onto his bed and picked up a book, absently flicking through the pages. It took only a few minutes for him to get bored.
The first few days passed in a blur. Between having to navigate the ever-changing one hundred and forty-two staircases and having so much classwork you couldn't take a second to stretch your wrist without missing something important, Harry soon became quite tired. Every morning he would struggle to rise, and every night he would be asleep the second his head hit the pillow. On top of that, whenever he was in the great hall, he would get a horrible headache that felt like someone was shoving a wooden stake through his brain.
"Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.
Just as John was about to explain, Mycroft came back. He looked at McGonagall briefly before turning to his family.
The three of them arrived at the library and began their research. Hermione scanned the shelves carefully, picking up only books that looked useful, Draco grabbed them at random, and Harry edged his way over to the restricted section.
“You should ask Madam Pomfrey for a sleeping draught. One of those dreamless ones,” said Ron, seemingly having appeared from nowhere. Harry jumped slightly before nodding.
"Good doggy," he said softly, trying to recall everything he knew about three-headed dogs. It wasn't a lot. One thing that did stick out was that they liked music.
"The Prime Minister has assured me that there is no better school than Hogwarts that speaks English, but given that you," he turned to Harry, "are fluent in French, you could possibly be accepted at Beauxbatons in France. It's up to you." Harry thought for a moment. Though he was fluent in quite a few languages and would have no issue spending a lot of time in France, it was very far away from home.
"Hey there." The kid looked up at the sound of an unfamiliar voice. He saw the blurry outline of a man. He had told the Dursley's that everything was blurry, but they said it was because he was always crying. He had accepted that there didn't seem to be any other explanation.
"How can you walk so fast?" he asked between gasps. Harry said nothing, just waited for his friend to catch his breath before continuing through the library and arriving at the correct isle. He looked through the books, reading each and every title before on caught his yee. The Art Of Occulmenecy. Harry picked it up and sat down.
The five of them hurried through the busy platform and through the barrier, back into the muggle world. Harry bumped into a somewhat familiar person with bright green hair, but they were soon forgotten when he saw his dads. He dropped his trunk and ran towards them, hugging them both tightly.
"Are you sure about this?" asked Draco for the hundredth time as they made their way up to the third floor.
"Well then, let's go," said Sherlock. The three of them continued walking through the bustling crowd, making their way towards platforms nine and ten. Hedwig received a lot of odd looks.
"You've trained it to expect pain when it hears the clankers," said Harry softly, looking into the dragon's pale eyes that were sunken deep into its scarred face.
"Screw this," he whispered, grabbing his glasses and a robe. He pulled it on over his pyjamas and slipped into his sneakers. Then he stood up and walked out of the dormitory. The common room was pitch black, the fire having burnt itself out hours before.
"Well, that may be so, but it doesn't excuse the scientific impossibility of magic," replied Sherlock.
That whole conversation was forgotten when Sherlock and John came in, announcing that it was finally time to open presents. A small cheer went up as John sat beside the small tree, handing out the gifts.
"We need to interrogate one of the goblins. I think I know one who would talk." And with that, Harry sprinted from the hall, running all through the castle until finally arriving in the owlery. He grabbed a pen and a piece of parchment that was in one of his pockets and wrote out a short letter to Griphook. Then he called over Hedwig and tied the letter to her leg. The owl then flew from the room, soaring over the grounds. Harry watched her leave, then turned to go.
At that point, John had thrown his hands in the air and gone to pour himself another cup of tea. Apparently, this was going to be a multi-cup kind of morning. Rosie crinkled her brow and thought hard, before a smile lit her face.
John didn’t have a soul mark either, not that Sherlock had ever seen anyway. He supposed it could be somewhere that clothes usually covered, but he’d seen John in various stages of undress throughout their acquaintance. He never directly asked, but he was sure John was Unmarked too.
John wakes to the sound of incessant typing. Mary must be online ordering that kale he failed to grow. She asked him to grow some weeks ago, but despite the vegetable's hardy cold tolerance, it had proven an impossible task. The kale simply would not grow for him. Mary's taken it as a personal slight.
Lestrade watches the detective prowl across the waiting room and sighs deeply. He lets the man work off the excess energy before speaking, low and clear.
He could just text him the details. Sherlock knew John would meet him there. He always did. But something unsettled made Sherlock’s insides squirm at the thought of doing that today. Strange.
John looked at his friend and smiled. He saw hope and hesitation in the man’s eyes, but he did not see fear.
“John Watson really is the best thing that ever happened to you. You have changed so much, yet you’re still the same old Sherlock. I appreciate your discretion, but it’s not necessary. I truly have moved on. Greg and I are really very happy, and I expect he’ll make a proper woman out of me quite soon. I have known you and John a long time. Please let me help?”
The receptionist hurriedly gave Lestrade a key and the room number before everyone sprinted up the stairs. As they neared the hallway of Dumbledore’s room, Harry cast a spell to detect wards and disabled every one he came across.
"I am so sorry," said Draco quickly. Harry laughed and picked them up off the ground, repairing them.
“That search ended four hours later, when Sherlock texted me telling me that the wizard had been successfully detained and that it would be only a matter of time before the ministry of magic showed up to take away the wizard. Now, the reason it took so long for us to come home was because of the absurd amount of paperwork needed when a muggle refuses to be obliterated,” finished John, taking a sip of the tea that Sherlock had brought him while he had been speaking.
John and Sherlock were waiting for him, and together the family walked together down onto the street and into a waiting taxi, all of them hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.
The only thing he could be sure of was that his meal-time headaches had started again. What caused them remained a mystery, as did why they stopped for around half the year.
"Well," he said, "you don't have to go. I can homeschool you, then you can come on cases with me. You can do other things to make friends." Harry's face lit up immediately.
"Uh, yeah. It's a remembrall. It goes red when you've forgotten something, which I think you might've." Harry looked down at the small ball and saw that it was scarlet.
"There's nothing pulling the carriages, Harry. They're magic," the blond replied, looking down on Harry slightly.
"Hello. Have you seen a toad? Neville's lost one." Her voice was quite loud and fast, in a tone some might call bossy. Harry had a feeling there weren't many people that listened to her at her home or old school.
Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.
"It's almost as if people with a certain amount of power don't have to abide by the law," said Hermione sarcastically.
Soon the four of them were standing in the entryway of Gringotts. There was a plaque next to the door. Engraved on was a verse that sounded quite threatening.
Harry shivered slightly. He had been in his fair share of banks, most of which had been robbed the day before, but none had given off such an aura of menace. Harry could tell they were hiding more than money down there, and he was going to find out what else was down there, but that would have to wait, as McGonagall had pushed open the door and was waiting for Harry to join her inside the bank.
"Come on, Mr Holmes. There is still the other vault for you to see," Griphook said. Harry nodded and hurried out the door. It slammed shut behind him and Griphook locked it before climbing back into the cart.
Are you alright? You haven’t written in over a week, and Sherlock and I are worried. I understand if you’re too stressed or tired to talk, but it would be nice to hear from you again.
"I can put the runes on your wand if you want. You'll just have to say the spell and they'll work for you." Draco nodded and handed his wand over.
“I’ve always been good with my hands,” John said awkwardly, fumbling through his confused amazement. The man turned his sharp attention to John again.
There was no bullet, no gunsmoke, and no blood splatter. John knew that this would happen, and he smiled impishly as the fluttering blaze from the end of the lighter cast soft heat an inch from his eyelid.
“He did strangle me,” John mumbled breathily, and his face felt warm as he realized exactly what he sounded like. “Didn’t kill me, though.”
“You’re a right murderer,” John said unnecessarily, gazing up from his perched spot at the edge of the faded backseat, its corners on their way to falling apart at the seams. He steeled his gaze, studying the cabbie’s now nervous glances towards the driver’s seat. This was no longer funny. The faces of four civilians, hazy in his memory of the TV, flashed through his mind. John slowly reached next to him and gripped the cool metal spine of his cane, folding his fingers around it in a tight grip.
The man cringed. “Working for those idiots? No.” John raised an eyebrow. The man continued, his voice still filled with pride, “I’m a consulting detective. They come to me for help when they’re out of their depth.”
, he thought, groaning inwardly in self-accusation, and his tongue felt like lead in his mouth, his temple beating as he churned through the soup of almost-words in his head, “murderous, erm, cab drivers.”
Sherlock hummed in acknowledgment, or sympathy, and sighed a world-weary sigh. “More's the pity,” he said wisely, “though they’ll rethink it soon.”
John closed his eyes, shaking his head all the while, and laughed out his disbelief. When he opened them, Sherlock was still watching him, a spark of laughter shining in the little scrunch around his eyes, though his face was otherwise impassive. John sighed.
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock said, and John gave him an assessing look as Sherlock’s face twisted like his mouth was stuffed full of lemon. Amusement fizzed up John’s throat like soda bubbles, and it popped his mouth open into another grin.
“Right, then,” said John, and Sherlock stared down at him, his hands hovering with uncertainty at his sides. He thought that there were words, somewhere; a ‘do you want to get dinner’, or ‘could I see you again’, or the ever practical ‘I think you’re quite fit,’ but none of them seemed to match into whatever social rules John’s ingrained in his psyche for this situation. Whatever those may be. “Erm.” John glanced at the passenger door. He opened and closed his mouth. “Bye.”
“Yes, I thought so,” Sherlock murmured, shooting John a teasing expression. His long fingers grasped at the aging bench behind John, arms and legs stretched out like a starfish. The curls continued to flop over his forehead, his head inclined to the side, as loose as a ragdoll. The entire picture he made was so strangely innocent, in complete contrast to the imposing, brilliant man he really was, and John couldn’t help but feel shadowed by comparison. It wasn’t such a difficult feeling to handle, though. You don’t bemoan your lack of power against the sun.
“Okay,” he said into the empty air, and Sherlock snapped his head to look at him. “Though if this is just some ruse to have lunch with me, you could just ask.”
“The medical world despairs your loss, Doctor,” Sherlock replied, emphasising the title. He had a self satisfied little smirk pulling at his lips, and resumed his examination.
Lestrade - D.I. Gregory Lestrade, he said his name was - tapped his pen against the notepad. “Don’t worry, mate. Sherlock’s got it for you.”
John felt like there might be something in that sentence that should offend him, but it was all true, and he couldn’t be arsed to complain about honesty. “Mm,” he hummed, “I’m the picture of practicality.” He paused and stared vaguely at the people chewing their lunch at Speedy’s cafe. He’d had an apple in the morning, and was resolute to eat something soon to avoid the whole passing out fiasco of yesterday. That was most definitely not practical. “I don’t think I made a very good impression.”
“Which was now,” John observed astutely, looking at the cabbie, bent over in a sitting position. His head was lolling a bit, eyes shut as he waited with resignation for the proper authorities to arrive and take him into custody.
John darted his tongue over his bottom lip. “No, I don’t.” He gazed at Sherlock, hoping to stretch the moment on and on, for some reason; stretch it the way genetics had stretched Sherlock’s long, taffy limbs.
A shadow covered the little warmth from the sky, and John dragged his eyes upward in annoyance, only to catch on Sherlock’s face. John blinked, and Sherlock blinked, too, his hand half raised in something akin to a wave. The knot in John’s chest untwisted, and he felt suddenly so grateful to have embarrassed himself in that interview.
John wondered idly if cursing could ever count as prayer. He wished for a distinct lack of killer accomplices, decided this newcomer probably wasn’t one, but stood up anyway. He glanced at his cane and his leg groaned, the forgotten pain - it was gone, he realized, for however shortly - flaring up with a vengeance. He cursed himself a little more and grabbed the cane.
He wondered briefly if he had hit his head hard enough to cause a concussion, but he knew what a concussion felt like, having received his fair share of injuries throughout his life. Punishment from his Da, roughhousing with Harry, rugby, ill-advised bar fights, the army… his life was always just a little violent. Even in friendly competition. Maybe especially then.
The man continued, a new layer of uneasiness in his expression, “You are also possibly unemployed and…
They transported him to the hospital, along with the concussed cabbie. They told him his nose was broken, which he knew, and the older woman on duty stuffed his nose with gauze and splinted it.
Sherlock stared at him, his sky-eyes traveling all over John’s face, a soft frown tugging at his lips. “I always am.” John grinned a little. Sherlock said, “About what?”
“Just don’t get mugged,” Mike had said, pressing some money into his hand for a cab as he retreated from a full dinner plate, an untouched pint. “Take a cab.”
“I used my cane as a weapon,” John relayed, and realized then that he didn’t know where the hell his cane was. “Bugger.” He stared morosely at his leg, a pulse of pain prancing through the nerves in his thigh in response to the attention.
The incredulous laughter hummed joyfully in John’s chest. “That’s brilliant,” he said reverently, his mouth pulled into a tilted, disbelieving grin. “You got that just from looking at me?” He stared up at the man’s unconventional face, scanning over the sharp shadows cut by the streetlight, admiring the soft blush that the man was steadfastly ignoring.
“Bad timing, too,” John replied, accepting the cane. He tapped the bottom twice against his calve and silently resented the fact that he felt no pain in it. Not even a phantom. He added, “Sorry. Didn’t mean to fall on you.” He thought about the fact that he’d warned Sherlock he might, earlier, when his head was spinning circles around him. He thought about how Sherlock had called the idea ‘amenable’, and the entire situation felt like an impossible fantasy.
“My-” and that wasn’t quite what John had thought he would hear, but it was warm, and his heart stuttered in his chest. “Okay. My company.”
“He’s a freak,” she told him, the ‘k’ clicking somewhat unpleasantly in the back of her throat. “Gets off on crime, murder - he was beside himself when he found out that the murderer had supposedly been found because he was hell bent on finiding him himself. How he figured that out before the police is really just another point away from him. He’s got no respect for justice.”
John said quickly, cutting off his own annoyance at his mind’s change in direction, “Are you the best man?”
Sherlock’s mouth twitched, his cupid's bow twisting as he caught the inner half of his bottom lip between his teeth. John didn’t even see the teeth, just his lip disappearing slightly, but it still sent an alarm bell of appreciation through his chest. He swallowed.
“-and not a little bit of time spent with me.” He stopped abruptly, and John shut his mouth, too. That felt like a warning, or a preparation, or- something. They stared at one another intensely, stretching the moment like long, long taffy.
After a moment he huffed, standing from the crouch, and the expensive looking coat draped down over his lean frame. He was long, like stretched taffy, with a distinct lack of gangly uncertainness. “You’ve given him a concussion,” he stated matter-of-factly. He tugged his phone from one of the deep pockets of his coat and rapidly typed something out, dropping it back into his coat promptly.
He stuck out his long, pale hand. “Sherlock Holmes,” the detective said, and it felt like an introduction. John’s head spun. He blinked forcefully, the light beaming as if he was looking straight into the sun, and took the hand.
John’s cheeks flushed dully at being called out. Not wanting to be thought a fool, he answered, half-kidding, “Maybe I was insulted. Does being insulted count as justification for inflicting bodily harm?”
“No,” he replied simply. He caught a glimpse of dark, intelligent eyes when she glanced at him, shrouded in late moonlight through the windshield. “Not really.”
“Terrible timing,” whispered John. “I had a job interview tomorrow, you know. As a GP. Guess that’s out the window.” He didn’t know why he was saying all this. Sherlock’s fingers felt like hot iron on his skin.
Sherlock puffed out a breath of his own, this one sounding distinctly like the words ‘just do as I say, would you?’. “Walk.” He paused, then said, “Please.” His voice grit the word out with the eloquence of nails on a chalkboard.
“Yes…?” replied Sherlock, and his trail was wandering and endless, his question mark in sore need of a diet. They stared at each other for a few moments, and then both opened their mouths.
“I’d be amenable,” Sherlock said, but didn’t elaborate, and John looked up from Sherlock’s mouth to his dawn eyes, and saw that his pupils were gradually pulling away at the color. John’s lips opened limply, parting just a bit in realization.
Panting, John dropped the cane to the ground. He sniffed violently, trying to breath around the globs of blood in his nose, and quickly undid his belt from where it was fastened around his waist on its tightest loop. His pants sagged, falling partway down his legs, and he silently bemoaned the way it chafed against his skin-and-bone hips, but didn’t pay it much mind beyond a fleeting consideration. The few times he had managed to look at himself in the mirror had been time enough to hate what his body had become.
He sighed deeply and gazed into his blue eyes beneath the impersonal light. They were so- him. Just him, John Watson; a dull blue, steady and dimming. Steadily dimming. He thought of Sherlock’s eyes, like a silver-lined horizon, and promptly left the bathroom, cutting off that train of thought. He pulled some frozen vegetables from the freezer and held them to the worst of the bruising, avoiding his nose, and hoped that it would help with the swelling. He knew it wouldn’t, really; not enough. But he needed something to do with his hands, and the frost felt nice on his over-hot cheeks.
He took a step with his left foot toward Sherlock. He lifted his right leg, and could feel as the momentum went down that it would not hold, even though it had just a moment ago - he cursed like a sailor as pinpricks of invisible needles shot through his veins, folding the limb beneath him like paper. He shut his eyes away from the rapidly approaching tile of the hospital floor, but blessedly did not disturb the very broken nose he had just had splinted, his fall ended in a much kinder manner.
John chuckled, and the man looked at him in surprise. His lips shuddered between frown and smile for a moment, unsure how to react, before slipping easily into a pleased grin. “Well,” John said wryly, “none of you were very much help this time.”
“Yeah,” John breathed, “it’s amazing. Really.” The right card. The man’s face morphed into a pleasant smile, genuine and fuzzy. Beautiful. There was another pause, and though the man was still studying John’s face, it felt less like being put under a microscope - more like simple appreciation, admiring a particularly skillful or emotional piece of art. Then John felt silly for thinking like that at all, because obviously that was not admiration. Could not be. Obviously.
Sherlock gazed right back, equally silent, equally strangely considering, until a young man in scrubs accidentally jostled John on his way by with a mumbled ‘sorry, sorry’. Sherlock’s eyes snapped into detached focus and he spun on his heel, feet light like a dancer’s, and said as John stumbled to catch up, “I’ll walk you out.” Sherlock’s presence beside him was heavy as they passed through the brightly lit hospital halls.
He left the cabbie on his back, his hands wedged between his body and the ground, and pulled out his own cell, his thumb brushing absently over the engraving of Clara and Harry’s names on the back. He dialed the emergency number, told them the situation the best he could -
He thought of his name in the news headlines, the photo of his dead face plastered over the television. A cautionary tale. It made his stomach turn, aching to vomit a meal he hadn’t eaten.
The man hummed in acknowledgment, his fingers tapping restlessly where they rested on his thigh, and John shifted uncomfortably, feeling exposed without his layers of shirts. There were old scars on his arms, and his trousers were falling down, only kept up by his tight grip on the fabric, so he couldn’t even rub them to calm the itch that simmered in his bones. He’s cold, he’s tired, and he’s not hungry, but his brain was giving him due warning that if he did not get food in his system right about now he would collapse.
A series of police cars and ambulances drove into the near deserted, aside from the three of them, car park.
“You didn’t hit your head that hard,” said Sherlock, and John snapped his eyes back up at him in shock.
John swallowed and paused, dragging his dull thumbnail over the smooth bumps and indents on his forearm. “You have strange standards,” he mumbled.
The man smirked again, amusement in his eyes. “No, but I’m fairly sure his status as a wanted criminal will absolve you from any legal responsibility.”
Lestrade looked more reluctantly accepting than understanding. He heaved a heavy sigh and shook his head, “You’d know more about it than me. Haven’t got a clue why he’s stuck around, frankly - I managed to wrangle the evidence away from him, those pills you found, which is more than we usually get.”
The tall man bent over the cabbie, whose eyes were stubbornly closed. John might not have gotten a concussion, but he didn't think the cabbie was so lucky.
John’s tongue stalled in his mouth, hesitating, then flicked out over his lips. Sherlock watched, and John was sure that his cheeks were burning up because he can’t remember the last time someone looked at him like that. Attraction, maybe. He could barely believe it. He didn’t, really - felt like an imposter, swallowed by clothes two sizes too big and wasting away in his own skin as this modern Adonis of a man looked at him with something other than pity. He again wondered how hard he actually hit his head.
“Others?” John studied the unmemorable face, the grey hair, the rounded outline of a body turned from muscle to flab. ‘I’ll make you kill yourself,’ he had said. It snapped in place. “Oh, shit. ‘Serial suicides’.”
He tipped John’s head back a bit, and John was vaguely aware of a dozen footsteps approaching them. “Your neck. He nearly strangled you.” A frown, pinched eyebrows. John swallowed, again, and Sherlock’s fingertips bumped over his Adam’s apple.
He took John’s face in his hands, moving hesitant and loose in case John chose to tug away, and then it could be brushed off as a little social stumble and ignored. John didn’t pull away, only wincing briefly as Sherlock ran his thumb pad over the same spot he had been rubbing a moment ago.
The old man flickered his eyes over John’s face, and finally seemed to decide something. The end of his finger trembled over the trigger, pushing it just to the point before shooting, and John watched with rapt attention as the thick hand pulled it over the threshold with a soft click.
John’s body was thin and his muscles had faded after their lack of use, emaciated through months of infection and illness and depression. His shoulder would scream after this, he knew. He flickered his gaze to the fake gun on the ground. The cement was awash in a lazy white from the streetlight.
Their conversation stopped in tandem, and John gazed into the street, beyond the people passing by their bench, beyond the people chewing their lunch and gathering their things on the patio of Speedy’s Cafe, beyond the row of flats containing the soon-to-be-familiar 221B. He thought of a gun barrel and sand that felt like snow in the cold night; of broken teacups and scarred arms and pill bottles that rattled like loose change scattering on the pavement.
The man huffed and rolled his eyes upward, looking painfully long-suffering. “Obvious. Tan, posture, haircut, capacity for violence. Though you were clearly invalidated home…” he trailed off, running his gaze over John’s thin frame.
throbbing as he finally let himself rest, “Dunno. I had something this morning.” It felt a little intimate to share something like that, and John was annoyed that he had at all, so he added jokingly, “You gonna bring me some dinner, then? Keep me from falling over you? I really just might.”
“Is that what your therapist said?” The man asked, his voice still deceptively confident, even as his face worked through a series of microexpressions that betrayed his emotion: surprise, doubt, confusion, and a tiny smile, pulling hopefully but dutifully stifled. John had learned to be good at reading expressions.
His grip tightened almost violently on the lighter, and he swung it towards John’s temple just as he lunged for the front seat. John dodged the attempt, the barrel scraping across his forehead unpleasantly, and he thrust himself from his seat, jabbing the cane out towards the cabbie and knocking him away from the car door.
“It’s a fake,” he raised an eyebrow, turning it over in his hands with intent focus.  “I think an army man such as yourself should have noticed, don’t you?” He clicked on the little flame, watching it against the blacktop for a second before flicking it off again.
Sherlock gave him a questioning look, and John clarified, “I don’t suppose that whatever impression I made on you was good, if I made one at all. Yet you’re still talking to me.”
He hadn’t felt this much laughter bubbling in his chest since before his shoulder, before his leg, before the burning desert sand turned to golden snow beneath his limp body, freezing as dusk dripped to midnight.
The blunt handle landed forcefully on the cabbie’s sternum, and John followed swiftly to put his body between the wheezing cabbie and the car. The thrill of a fight ached in his veins, adrenaline pumping with the steady drum of his heart and shaking with anticipation in his bones. He minutely unclenched his grip on the cane, adjusting it, and tightened it again. His leg twinged a little, and it hurt, but he ignored it. He’d felt worse.
John grabbed the door handle and pulled it open. He paused, fingertips tapping deftly against the metal. He flicked his gaze to Sherlock.
He did a double take at the ominous black cab and swallowed thickly, his mind running through possible scenarios of… what? Accomplices? A whole underground cabbie murder ring that he’s about to bust wide open?
His tentative joy dancing through his dawn eyes and over his cheeks in a flush, Sherlock said, “Hungry, then?”
Sherlock nodded imperceptibly, and their hands dropped away, leaving a tingling sensation from where Sherlock’s fingers had wrapped around the developing bruise on John’s knuckles. “Call me Sherlock. And yes, I noticed.”
A twitch of a smirk hovered at the edge of the man’s lips. He strode past John and bent over, picking up the gun shaped lighter.
“Hypocritical from a soldier,” the cabbie replied idly. He fiddled with the keys in the pocket of his trousers, and John tuned into the soft jingling as the metals rubbed and clinked against each other. His grip on the fake gun alleviated slightly, threatening to clatter to the blacktop. John could tell the exact moment the man decided to take his chance.
The man almost frowned, but John grinned drowsily at him, cutting off his uncertainty. “I’m teasing,” he stage-whispered, not unkind, and the man was abashed, but returned the expression with something a little close to fondness. If they hadn’t just met, John would think that’s what it was.
The man’s face scrunched up, confused. He replied instantly, sounding like a lost child, “Hah?” Then the flush deepened a shade, and he sputtered, “I mean, what on earth are you talking about?”
John pinched his lips thinly, barely managing to suppress his laughter. ‘Hah’, he says. John wondered how many times he’s been caught off guard so thoroughly. “On the telly, that inspector said he’s got his ‘best man’ on the case. Are you him?”
He wandered through the blocks of shops and flats and restaurants of London’s prime real estate, gazing absently at faceless mannequins dressed in the latest fashions and old antique tea sets that reminded him of his Gran’s. Those were smashed to bits, he remembered. Shrapnel of porcelain that sprayed in arcs and cut into his hands when he tried to gather them up. For a little while, smatterings of scars had adorned his palms like freckles until they faded to be nearly invisible.
“Well?” asked Sherlock, eyebrows raised high on his forehead. His curls swept down over them, and John maybe wanted to swipe them away, just a tiny bit. He grasped his cane tightly.
He bunched the drowning waistband of his trousers in one hand to keep himself from unintentionally flashing his briefs at this stranger. Unless they were a threat. Then maybe he’d give them an eyeful. Put off their appetite for a bit. Psychological warfare.
). So he smiled and nodded and said his politely distanced goodbye, clacking his way out of the clinic, his eyelids heavy and footsteps heavier.
Sherlock seemed put out and huffed a small breath of fleeting frustration. “Well, I assume you’d rather not jump into another cab just yet. And I can’t drive, so that’s out of the question.”
Strangely enough, the first car to arrive on scene, not 5 minutes later, was not a police car, but another cab. John glanced up once from where he’s bent over, ruining his undershirt with the blood from his nose as he tries to keep it from clogging up his throat. He’s successful, mostly, though his mouth still tasted like when he was a small kid, licking at the ice on light posts; undeniably, unmistakably metallic. His jumper and flannel were in a heap beside him, removed to save them the fate his threadbare undershirt suffered.
Sherlock gave a small smile. “Yes, I have a feeling it takes a bit more than that to get rid of you.” Figures arrived near them then, John catching a glimpse of faces that looked pained just at the sight of him, and Sherlock dipped John’s head. “You won't look very nice, but you didn’t hit yourself hard enough to start hallucinating.”
John replied, nasal, “All the time. I’m a thug. Can’t you tell?” She glanced him over, and they shared a small, joking grin. He was fed subpar hospital food that went down his throat with the consistency of toothpaste, and drank three cups of chilly water that helped to wash it down.
“This isn’t charity,” Sherlock answered, and even though distrust swam through his veins and pounded against the walls of his skull, John believed him. Sherlock continued after a beat, “It may also do well to tell you that being around me requires a large deal of patience.”
John was not especially moved. He avoided looking at her, a little ball of indignation forming in his chest. “Would I?”
Upon arriving home, John changed and took a long, hard look at the damage to his face in the mirror above his impeccably clean bathroom sink. He thought for a second about cancelling or even just skipping out on that job interview, but he needed money and he needed something to do more. Cancelling on short notice (he couldn’t call now - he’d need to cancel the
Whatever John had anticipated for Sherlock to say next, that was not it. His eyes widened, and he moved his hand onto his thigh, grabbing loosely through the too-big jeans. “You what?”
Sherlock inclined his head, and John heard a soft, restless tapping of those clever fingers on the bench behind him. “What if it’s a bit of both?”
Sherlock hesitated, his hand raised halfway towards some kind of gesture. It retreated into his coat pocket. “There’s a car outside to take you home,” he told John, and the words were weak, flopping lamely onto the tile between their feet. “Driven by Sergeant Donovan. I can’t attest to her skills as a driver, but I suppose you’ll have to make do.”
, John thought. His eyes were a pale blue, almost grey, like the halo around the moon, ethereal and otherworldly. A silver lining. Dawn in the distance; morning over the horizon after a sleepless night. A snatch of sky, indeed.
He remembered belatedly that he hadn’t eaten anything other than toast that day, and that was very early in the morning. Dawn, or pre-dawn, when the sane world was still asleep and his sheets still clung to the remainder of his body heat and sweat after he awoke with a gasp to moonlight like a kiss on his face, seeping through the open window.
He greeted, “Sherlock,” and it sounded a little too relieved, a little too breathless, but it was hardly a slip up because Sherlock slunk down into the space beside him like he belonged there.
He jammed his thumb into the heel of his palm, over a particularly deep little white line that cut through the flesh, and sighed through his nose, turning away from the dainty teacup that stared out of the window display. He walked some more, until his leg started throbbing, and collapsed on a bench in the middle of a mildly bustling street. Across the road was a red awning deemed ‘Speedy’s cafe’, and John soaked in the rays of minimal sunlight, tracking the movement of people passing by with vigilant eyes.
The man blinked, caught in the headlights, and John watched with no short supply of wonder as a rosy pink replaced the pale white of his skin, high on his cheekbones. He stumbled, “Uh, w-” cleared his throat, obviously irritated at himself, “You have PTSD, recently invalidated. Of course you have a therapist.” He glanced down at John’s leg, seemed to inwardly battle with something, then added before John got a chance to reply, “Your limp is also psychosomatic. Partly, at least.”
Sherlock cleared his throat and awkwardly thrust the cane out toward John. “It’s rather fickle, your leg.”
John stared out of the window as she started up the car, pulling slowly across the pavement. Sherlock’s pale face cut a slash in the night, and his dark clothing had a similar impact upon the glaring hospital entrance. Sherlock raised a hand, but didn’t wave, caught between friendly and distant. John quirked a smile and raised his own hand, watching his figure fade into the background until he couldn’t make out the conflicted expression on his face before turning forward.
There was a lot of official-seeming movement, then; they properly cuffed the cabbie and marched him off to… somewhere, and John was gathered up like a child, ushered into the ambulance where he was checked over by the paramedics. He was annoyed at them for touching him and treating him as though he couldn’t take care of himself, and then he was annoyed at himself for feeling that way because they were only doing their job. He opted to simply stop thinking, because his head never worked quite right, anyhow.
“On your way home from a pub.” The man leaned in and sniffed, his nose twitching cutely, and John blinked at him, bewildered. “You didn’t drink or eat, though. Go to meet someone, then? Reluctantly. An old friend, I’m guessing.”
The cabbie threw himself at John, wringing his large hands around his neck and slamming him back into the car. John winced, choking and gasping, scratching at the knuckles with dull nails as his cane slid from his hand. He kicked his legs out, trying to feel for some solid ground, and jabbed the heel of his foot into the cabbie’s knee.
“I didn’t solve them,” John answered, for the third time, irritation thrumming as an ache in his shoulder,  “the bloody murderer picked me up and - christ, mate, can’t you just send a car?”
But he stood a little straighter all the same. Tightened his grip on his way-too-big jeans and felt like a child, his Da’s angry voice in his ear.
John inclined his head toward the pile of belongings, the two glass bottles glinting in the light. “Pills, I figure. Said he’d make me kill myself.” The man hummed and didn’t bother standing up, simply lurching towards the pile with catlike precision  and snatching up the bottles. He held them to the light, as if he could discern some sort of secret from them if he looked hard enough, then shoved them into his pocket with a soft rattling and returned to his examination of the cabbie.
The man sniffed and his figure straightened, his shoulders squaring and spine snapping to full height. At attention, dripping with absolute pride and self-confidence. “Yes,” he replied, and John usually doesn’t feel this short. “Frankly, I’m
He coughed and rubbed his throat, and the cabbie took advantage of his incapacitated situation to slam the heel of his hand into John’s face. It hit with a sickening crunch on the side of his nose and his head clobbered into the car. Pain flared up across John’s face and blood spurted from his nose, dripping into his gasping mouth. Broken, his brain supplied helpfully, and he neglected the thought.
“I have… a hypothesis,” he declared, and the skittering nervousness retreated, replaced by that same intensity.
John blinked at the man again, offense flickering in his chest, but it died down almost instantly, replaced with incredulous mirth. “Did you just ask me if my mental illness is ruining my physical health?”
They kept him for a bit, and a silver-haired detective with tired eyes and a nicotine patch peeking through his rolled up sleeves came to talk to him. John gave his statement; where he’d been, what he’d been doing, and most importantly what his murderous friend had tried to do.
Sherlock knew she was hinting at their liaison – their relationship, Sherlock guessed – whatever it was that they had since the aftermath of the Garrideb case, and that neither of them dared mention out loud most days. It was the most delicate of experiments, one that couldn’t be exposed to the open air or the elements, or it would disintegrate and die.
Joanna’s phone began talking at irregular intervals to give her directions as she crossed the entire city, heading towards an area Sherlock quite enjoyed, having worked there several times in the past. They often listened to music on their car rides, or sometimes they talked, and laughed, when they were not on a case. Early on, at the beginning of their cohabitation, which had quickly turned into something more, Sherlock had found herself laughing quite often, and she’d realized that she had never laughed this much before. She’d realized after that first chase, after the dinner at Angelo's, when they’d just leaned back against the wall and laughed, Joanna’s eyes glistening in the dark. Joanna laughed often, even more often since their thing – whatever it was that they had going on (although Sherlock knew she technically knew what it was) – had begun.
And that’s how Lestrade found out he was going to attend a premiere at the most obnoxious theatre of London, near the middle of December, together with a plus one that was still to be determined, Donovan’s live-in partner, Sherlock Holmes and whatever human being constituted her romantic life.
He could hear an old woman’s voice, from the other side of the phone call. She was speaking fast and it was not loud enough to make out the words.
“Yes,” Lestrade said. “Murdered old woman, sweetest grandma to ever exist according to her neighbours, no signs of forced entry. That’s got to be at least a six,” he tried, remembering the point system that Joanna had mentioned a few times, to him and on her blog.
“I think she’d like you – she likes them ruggedly handsome and grey, and every single man she’s dated loved football.” Which wasn’t exactly a compliment, but it came very close to being one.
Afterwards, she didn’t sleep – she stared at the ceiling for a while, straightened her legs on the sofa at some point, looked at the light that came in through the blinds, until it became way too bright to still be night. A couple of times the air became thicker, and she didn’t quite dream, but definitely did something similar. She saw the familiar glow of brown hair in the sun, the shape of the ears of the dog that had bitten her ankle that mild early spring day.
A million tiny suspicions, fragments of her life, from early childhood to the previous summer, after her A levels, when her parents had forced her to come to the South of France with them, on white beaches full of beautiful French girls in bikinis – it had all clicked together. She would never bring home a nice boy for the Holmeses to meet: it was going to be yet another disappointment for her parents, most likely. But she was young, and as painful as it was to admit, she was also in love; she set the thought aside.
It would have been a lie to say that he’d never seen Sherlock Holmes in any kind of distress: he’d seen her at the pool, and he’d seen her almost overdose, and he’d tried to restrict her access to crime scenes often enough that he knew what she looked like when she was upset, or when she was pretending to be for manipulatory purposes.
“What won’t some people do for an inheritance,” Anderson remarked, after the fifth set of stairs – they had three left – and Lestrade made a sound that could be interpreted as exhaustion, disapproval, or even agreement, even though it definitely wasn’t the latter. The guy was a famous architect; the old lady lived here.
“Well, since Donovan has that terrible boyfriend, and she got her own invite, anyway, she must have, or it would be a scandal, she was much more useful than you, on that case…”
So Lestrade ran after the two to the battered car, parked in a small street he had never even seen in his life. He knew Sherlock got to sit in the front, as some kind of divine right, as the driver’s flatmate – and girlfriend, he thought, again. The car only had front doors and he had to climb to the backseat.
Mrs Hudson opened the door, greeting him with the usual smile and showing the same deference she always had towards him, most likely convinced that he was a much bigger fish than he actually was. When he announced it to Sherlock herself, it wasn’t actually all that bad – as in, she took the tickets from his hands, stared at them for a few seconds as if they were soil samples from Mars, then put them down carefully on their bare kitchen table as if they could break.
He’d even made a move towards her, just a few months before, at the start of the summer, so as soon as he’d felt comfortable asking someone out after the divorce papers. He’d texted her an invite for dinner, that she’d declined claiming ‘work’, ‘you’re a really nice guy, but’, and ‘Sherlock’s waiting, see you soon’. He hadn’t been too devastated afterwards, and they’d even gone out for a drink at the bar a few times since. She was a football fan and could be very jovial, when not on the job. On crime scenes, she was very respectful, unlike Sherlock, and a few times she’d treated the deceased’s relatives with a lot of empathy, which wasn’t so strange, Lestrade now realized, since she worked in healthcare. Out of all the people who were, more or less, recurring characters in his personal life, she was the only one who hadn’t first met Gregory Lestrade as a married man, and he found something almost sensual in that.
“Just the two of us, from the Yard,” he said, “with plus ones, of course,” and he thought that he could have invited her as his plus one, if the fair youth hadn’t handed him so many fucking tickets. Provided, of course, that Donovan’s scary live-in partner didn’t actually mind.
“How is she?” Lestrade asked, politely, as soon as the consulting detective arrived from the cab parked outside, making her way through the police tape with her usual confidence.
“Who knows,” Mycroft replied, an exaggerated tilt of her head towards the ceiling. “It was their problem, not mine, and certainly not Sherlock’s.”
“Seriously? Mycroft knew I was gay years before I even knew what it meant,” Sherlock said, and once again Lestrade thought of all the signs – the lack of male companions, the way she’d seemed uninterested towards the few Yard officers who had tried to make a move on her… Lestrade had assumed she must have been some kind of inanimate object, devoid of feelings, of personal relationships – and then realized how unnecessarily complicated that was, how… simple the truth.
Lestrade didn’t have the heart to shatter her worldview, and tell her that more often than not the family wasn’t as innocent and pure as she liked to believe. It was a burden he had to carry due to the nature of his job, and it didn’t mean that Margaret had to carry it as well.
“I don’t think he’s capable of independent thought,” Sherlock replied, and Lestrade nodded, and thought he had an idea of the dynamics of the Holmes family.
Detective Inspector Lestrade had always more or less subconsciously liked the doctor, with her diminutive figure and quiet presence, which could nonetheless become very imposing when the situation warranted it. For example, every time Sherlock was acting out, which was a much rarer occurrence now than it had been at first, or before Joanna Watson came along, anyway. She was a good influence on Sherlock, definitely, the Detective Inspector had thought early on.
There was a heavy silence – and Lestrade felt heavy too, and like he was intruding, like he was seeing something he really wasn’t meant to see. It was a feeling he got, sometimes, when he had to dig in underwear drawers, among sex toys and other things people usually don’t put on display, but it usually felt more clinical, and therefore less awkward.
“What’s so good in Thailand, anyway?” Sherlock asked, upon entering. It wasn’t the first time he saw her – she’d been there at the first interrogation, too, although things had been less, well, tense back then. Now he was looking at her with a mean look in his eyes – with hatred, even. The most ruthless of killers sometimes looked way too meek in that room, but Michael Parris was absolutely terrifying. Not dangerous, because he was handcuffed, and there were guards standing at the entrance; just terrifying, because of that look in his eyes.
“Yeah, with a coworker,” Lestrade wondered what he was waiting for to break the news. “We’ve been given tickets to a premiere. Racine. As a reward, and as an official visit. And I get a plus one,” he added, finally clarifying the matter at hand.
“She’d already called the publisher – the fuck did she want to make, an exposé? About a dead man? I couldn’t stand to see her disrespect him so much. I guess I lost it, I’ll admit.”
“Woke up hours ago. Now she’s thinking, in the kitchen,” she replied. Her voice was drier than usual – she always tried to make herself sound more welcoming, more pleasant when she was on the phone with him. Maybe now that they were closer she’d stopped doing that, or maybe something was going on that Lestrade wasn’t privy to. He chose not to pry.
“Don’t you? They seem important,” she said. She accepted the change of subject without complaining. She sounded passionate about it, even.
“Mr Brown from downstairs,” Parris said, “he is such a dear, always drives my mum to doctor’s appointments, and she does his laundry and irons his clothes.”
“Both women,” Joanna said. “And B rank celebrities, I know that. I know.” It was unusually direct, coming from her. “I would like to come clean,” she began, carefully. “But you have to be on board. I don’t want people to think I’m forcing you – because of your parents’ money, or because you’re the consulting detective. You must understand, Sherlock…”
“Would you… would you like to get dinner, sometimes?” he managed to spit out, so fast that he almost interrupted her, ears turning red because it had been a while since he’d last done that – dating – however it worked. He didn’t actually think he’d do it, until he did it. He did it because he felt like he had nothing to lose, because he had a suspicion that the Holmes sisters were always ten steps ahead of him, anyway, and they never did anything just because.
Lestrade knew that it would be surprisingly easy to get the files back – especially if Michael Parris had neglected to empty the bin.
“You can’t wear your normal clothes,” she explained, “there will be press. Dress or slacks? What colour?”
It ended up not mattering because, when Victoria came out to her dad over the weekend (her mother had died when she was a child), he reacted badly, to put it mildly. They discussed moving in together.
Joanna’s eyes were still closed. She peeked out from the right one, which had an unusual glisten in it, although it wasn’t quite wet – Sherlock had never seen her cry. “You’re making me cry, you idiot,” she said, then, after a short struggle with the sofa, Sherlock’s legs, and her jeans, she laid on top of her and buried her head in Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock was already at the Yard, when they came back with the newly arrested son. Joanna was with her; they were both drinking coffee, standing in front of his office, way past the point where civilians were usually stopped. “Sorry about your date,” Joanna told him, and Lestrade had to accept the fact that his relationship troubles were way harder to hide from them now.
“And that, well… I wouldn’t have said that I’m close to her until a few days ago, but it feels like something clicked now. Joanna helped.”
He came back to the scene four days later, at Sherlock’s insistence, because she hadn’t been able to properly analyze it the first time, with Joanna nearly giving herself brain damage and all. He’d had to keep her waiting – he’d had a robbery gone wrong in the meantime, which had been easy and tedious and more gruesome than usual. He’d received an email from his lawyer, which he’d ignored He’d spent
“No, no, it’s… not that.” Sherlock straightened her legs in front of her. They were slender and long and her parents had tried to force her to do ballet. She could hear her heartbeat in her eardrums and her mouth was very dry. “They didn’t take it well,” she said after a while.
Sherlock had known, once, but she’d deleted the information to make room for something else, she guessed.
“…but I had to wait for Mrs Hudson to come back from the shops to keep an eye on her at Baker Street. She’s not nauseous, and she insists she’s fine, but the doctors weren’t as thorough as I hoped, even though I’ve complained and threatened to call my sister, but they have determined that her skull isn’t fractured and there are no haemorrhages and…”
Then the doctor screamed, the string thing snapped, and the chair did a little dance on its four legs before falling sideways. A moment later Joanna was falling too, on top of it.
“Oh. Can you tell her we found twenty thousand pounds underneath the floor of Mr Brown’s apartment?”
“Joanna Watson,” she said, “I’m Sherlock’s partner. Surely he must have told you about her.” Lestrade was hit with the realization of the word choice –
This wasn’t something he did very often – they almost never talked, these days. Robert, too, lived in London, where he’d made a small fortune with a used car dealership. He had a beautiful wife and three children, a son and two daughters. Despite Lestrade’s best efforts, his brother’s success in life only reminded him of his own failures; which was why he hadn’t called him since the day Sophie had filed for divorce.
“There’s really no need…” But they were already at the front door, almost through the tape, when the detective, who was supporting her friend’s entire body weight, or so it seemed to Lestrade, turned towards the Detective Inspector, looking at him almost expectantly.
He knew the answer to that one. And he had to remind himself constantly that the woman sitting in front of him in the café, who was younger than him by a mere three years, but wiser by a thousand, was the sister of the only other woman in his life except for Donovan, now that Sophie had left him.
“This one isn’t a letter,” Jo said after a while, after Anderson had left. “I noticed last night. It’s a Word document. It looks like a story.”
They’d agreed that she’d stay the rest of the weekend, and then Lestrade had taken the Monday off to stay with her some more, offer her a nice meal, and drive her back. And she would come back for Christmas, too, after less than ten days – they’d have a big lunch at Robert’s house, and they’d see their nieces and nephews and grandkids, and they’d be a family, which wasn’t such a big thing, all things considered – no one hated each other, after all – but to Lestrade it might as well have been.
“I told her to call if she feels even a bit nauseated,” he told Lestrade, “she has your number, too, just in case, and…”
“He was her employer,” Joanna said, “he had so much power over her, that he made them split as soon as she was of age, and then married her. Soon afterwards they had the architect. Very soon afterwards. And that’s where the memoirs stop.”
She fell asleep thinking about that – thinking about the warmth of the smaller body in her arms – and lost track of a few hours; when she awoke, Joanna was looking at her.
First, he told Gregson. To check. To make sure that it was fine, and wasn’t overstepping any kind of boundary in the context of an investigation, albeit a closed one. Just to be extremely sure – the reputation of the whole police force was at stake, after all. He even hoped for a screaming fit from his boss, however scary those were.
Joanna had a different look on her face than Sherlock was expecting. It was no longer an ‘I’m sorry’ face. “I don’t understand. Do you want to be a Mycroft?”
When the night finally came, Lestrade spent an ungodly amount of time in front of the mirror, checking his tie, his hair – blow dried as usual, but combed with a lot more strength, – the fit of his jacket, then finally his shirt, which he’d worn at his own wedding and at his father’s funeral, so it didn’t exactly carry a lot of good memories. It had also grown quite tight around his belly. Once he was done, his mother still walked out of the bathroom, all dressed up in what must have been a very fancy dress for someone her age, and fixed his tie again. Just in case.
Sherlock had never been good with feelings; quite the opposite. Victoria had told her that she had a tendency to make everything about herself, and she knew that she dealt with difficult situations through long silences and sleepless nights, the way Joanna dealt with them through sex: she’d heard her fall into that same old trap, once or twice, while trying to break up with the woman of the month.
Earlier that night, as he microwaved some expired ramen he’d found in the cupboard, possibly another relic from his divorce, Lestrade remembered the look on Sherlock’s face upon hearing the admittedly scary thud of the doctor’s head against the radiator.
And his plans were kind of ruined, because someone, in West London, had seen it fit to murder an old lady with a phone charger on the floor of her own living room. Without leaving significant traces. In a flat, where none of the doors, internal or external, showed signs of intrusion, and where all the other tenants swore that she was such a sweet grandma who always gave candy to the multitude of children under the age of five who lived there.
“Where do you think you’re going?” a voice interrupted them from the crowd, as Lestrade hit the save button on the new contact he’d just added to his phone, under the name Mycroft Holmes. As if he knew any other Mycrofts.
“I don’t see why we’re arguing,” she tried. “If… nothing had happened, if things were the way they were one year ago, we could still go together as friends. You’re my assistant, my roommate, and you blog about me. No one would find anything strange about it.”
“She seemed to do it every few years, on her computer, and then she printed out the results… in 2005, she went further:
“The first time… it was perhaps the last straw, between her and our parents,” she told him. “Then she dropped out, and I’m afraid you know the rest.”
“I should’ve never suggested this, Joanna, I’m so sorry,” Sherlock was saying, as Lestrade watched, feeling like he’d run out of words in the English language, and it had been a long while since he’d last spoken French. “I was an idiot, I was a bloody idiot – the dust… I’m taking you to A&E, Joanna, don’t fall asleep…”
“My sister is the only one who can stand up to mum,” Sherlock said smugly, and he couldn’t tell whether she was more annoyed at Mycroft or relieved at the thought.
