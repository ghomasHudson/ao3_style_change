His fists smashing any inch of body he could see. Almost like a rage monster, Sam felt himself go haywire on this man. That is until he could hear his companion grunting in pain.
"I mean, how are you guys doing now? You know, since...
Shield dismantling, some double agents, and albeit an eventful reunion, with a long lost friend, was all it took to change Steve Rogers. The usually collected, very head strong, by the rules kinda hero; was now more confused/exhausted than ever.
But now he had a way to fill it. He could find a home that could replace this someone, with a time he remembers. A home that he thought he could never have. However... to what cost?
Steve dropped his eyes to the floor, letting everything sink in.
"For what?"
"I guess now, if your done?" Sam asked.
Various rooms filled with crates, cobwebs, food wrappings, and the invading presence of the gun blasts. Smashing the glass windows, and sending strobes of energy to wreck anything in its path.
However, others looked at the Avengers with morbid intentions. One even spit on the ground near Steve. This generally changed the tone, as others began yelling at the team. Calling them 'freaks in big boy suits'. But this didn't stop from some of the Avengers looking around to see if someone needed them.
"It was a metaphor," Kamala revealed.
"We'll always have your back." Tony said softly as he sat his hand on his shoulder.
Tony, once again, smirked and recalled to the super-soldier, in slight detail, his time in Afghanistan. Like his confession, he choked up several times, and looked all around himself.
And that was it. The last thing Steve Rogers would say to Tony Stark, as a year would pass before the two spoke again.
"I was in a rough place in my life. And those times just helped me pass the time. But none of them were even close to what we just did." Tony attested.
"I want... Us... to leave the group behind and fend for ourselves." He answered truthfully.
The day was ending. The sky turning that pinkish/purplish hue. Telling all, that the day has ended and nightfall would be upon them. Just like yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that. In one of the Earth's repetitive cycles, that Natasha finally could say was annoying.
"Well, nice to meet you Happy. They call me Captain America. And I really hope there isn't any danger. 'Cause I know a few ways to handle it." Steve added, whilst breaking out his own tough guy tone. Which of course was completely believable.
"I know my words don't mean much, but-I know that Nat and Clint are truly sorry for what happened to your daughter. But they saved millions of lives that day. And if it wasn't for them going back, unauthorized I mind you. Your daughter would've died alone. And I couldn't imagine how that feels for someone so young.".
Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock...
He smiles to himself, as he glides along the banister and up the other flight of stairs to the third floor. Only three rooms were on this floor. The playroom on the right, the bathroom in the middle, and the storage area on the left. Tony even chuckles a little at the thought of him and Steve almost getting 'caught' in said bathroom, during a get-together with some neighbors from around the area.
“Thank you, Uh... please have a seat.” Tony ushered him into the living room. “Just uh, make yourself comfortable. I got something cooking in the kitchen.”.
And when minutes started to feel like hours, both men were now getting worried. With every second, Steve continuously looked back to the entrance of the property, hoping to see a car enter. Even so, Steve was just ready to see the inside of this place. To him, the interior of a home told more of a story than the exterior. It was this mindset that the blonde had had when looking for his new house.
It's truly nice to know that he's at least making some friends in this new age, that genuinely have heart. Interestingly, Pepper reminded Steve of Peggy. The women were very strong hearted, yet both could call you out on shit if you needed it.
Of course, Tony's outfit was similar to Steve's. I mean sure, they were the two leaders of the Avengers. But this was just too funny to Kamala. The literal, only, difference between the two was the color of the turtlenecks and the style of the tuxedos. Tony's turtleneck was black, instead of red; and his tuxedo was a Satin Peak Lapel.
Sam went up the left one, with Natasha and Steve heading up the right one. Steve gave some signals for Sam to bring out the wings and hold for further instructions.
Steve was able to ease into the pain, thanks to the serum, and had his gun aimed for the door, leading out the hallway, with Sam following his friend's actions. Silence befell the room, ignoring the sounds of the trucks outside, leaving the compound. Which was more terrifying to Steve, than the situation they were in.
Steve reiterated his statement before the agent cut him off.
Tony noticed this but didn't protest. He just laid on his back and stared lovingly at his husband.
Tony looked to the blonde, confused and sore from the whiplash he just suffered through. He held his chest in a shocked manner, trying to catch his breath in the process.
"What about Wanda or Vision, aren't they out there with you?" He griped a bit too loud.
Wow, when was the last time Steve felt this happy? He hasn't been this optimistic in a long time. Yet, it felt great nonetheless.
Another yell from downstairs made Tony's confused state, morph into annoyance. "What's with the yelling?!" He shouted.
“Bruce, it’s alright. You don’t have to explain yourself to me.” She added.
“This was the actual reason. You, Vision, Steve, and Sam are all I have left right now. I don’t have much of a story to look back upon. But I at least-or did, have one to look forward too.” Natasha croaked.
"Sam... Sam... Sam, come on man!" He whispered energetically.
"Steve, I've had a lot of time to think about this. And like I said, you and he have this special bond. A comforting bond, that I've tried to give him. And I know he's tried to accept my version of it. Yet, he's lying to himself, when he does, and to me." She reassured the super-soldier, "Now that you and him have done everything. I can at least have some ease knowing that, even though I didn't want it to happen, at all. It was at least by you. And I can try and live with that.".
His glancing then moved to the stairwell. None there either. He felt a wave of disappointment wash over him. 'This honestly couldn't get worse, right?'.
"Him? What are you talking about?".
Cap’s suit was more damaged than all the other’s. The white star that sat on his chest, now was gone, with only the imprint of it left. Tears and scratches were all around the outfit. Including some dirt, blood, and what looked like, some sweat stains.
"Steve Rogers we do not use that kind of profanity in this household." Nat joked.
Kate wore a simple, red, night way cold-shoulder keyhole gown. With a feathered veil to boost the look a little. Her hair is done in a low bun style.
“That’s okay, Stark. I’m glad you're looking at all of it.” Steve expressed.
When Tony took you in as a friend, it was the equivalent of sending his heart to that person. You were pretty much in charge of it; making sure that no one would damage it. And Steve certainly did just that.
It did. He set his book down and rubbed his hands against his face in aggravation. Tony didn’t even need to be here for himself to make Steve aggravated.
"I was wondering. Umm, if you're still needing a roommate? Because I kind of already knew that you were needing some." Peter looked visibly nervous.
"What about me and Tony?" Steve asked a little defensively.
"Yes... Yes it is... Um, thank you. Captain Rogers, Steve." Tony stated awkwardly.
Steve, and even Pepper, had seemingly forgotten about it as well. Just like their kiss, their 'bonding' moment, became nothing more than a forgotten memory. Who knew, a year’s set of events could completely obscure a situation like theirs.
Were they able to call for any assistance? Nope. That’s one of the many downfalls of being an international fugitive.
"Well if you say yes, then I believe we are.".
Steve Rogers was everything that Tony wanted to be. Smart, skillful, brave, honest, and some nice muscles wouldn't have hurt either. It honestly astounded the philanthropist on how much he actually looked up to the man. And so did his father.
“Alright. I’ll bring some weapons along as well.” She added. Before the phone immediately hung up.
By the time he got downstairs to greet everyone, his entire confidence disintegrated once he saw Tony's face. It was immediately sour at the sight of Steve. Something was wrong.
That last sentence made Steve feel bitterly awful, and cold. ‘We’re good.’ As in, no longer good. Probably so far from good, that it’s just plain bad. It was almost like a photo projector in Steve’s head. Sending flash images of his and Tony’s adventures together.
Natasha stood puzzled, scared, and alone. Some of the townsfolk had resurfaced back to the market, slowly but surely. Along with some policemen asking some of them for information.
"Oh my god! You've gone insane!" She yelled.
Tony felt himself shift in his seat. It was all becoming too much for the philanthropist. His breathing began to escalate, and he felt his eyes close. Now the memories were much more clearer. Mostly the image of Steve, over him, with Howard's shield buried deep in his arc reactor.
The ringing stopped, and a familiar, feminine, husky, voice answered with a warming, "Hello."
Tony still slightly opened his eyes, yet began to sniffle. Then his head softly hit Steve's shoulders. The tears soon followed, and then the apologies.
Steve looked back up to the brunet and noticed how Tony was leaning on the wall looking a bit agitated that the blonde still wasn't saying anything.
Steve cracked his neck in relief, whilst looking to the philanthropist frustratingly. His eyes then falling upon the farmhouse before him. It was... big, to say the least. The blonde quickly estimated the house to at least be 4,000 sq ft. if not bigger. What did catch Steve off guard though, was the other buildings that were close to the house. So close in proximity that they just had to be a part of the property as well.
Tony stood with his thoughts. Yet a single thought made Tony gaze upon his co-companion.
"And I wanted to apologize," Bruce added quickly.
"I Love You, Too! Tony Stark!" Steve shouted back.
He sighed and gave up for an explanation. The many assumptions becoming jumbled in his head. The brunette just continued his gaze elsewhere. Now looking upon the half-built repulsor. He grazed his fingers across the familiar, cold metal. "Hello, Old Friend."
He chuckled. She raised a shit-eating grin to her face. That was it.
He pictured a typical American family, eating roast by a dimly lit fireplace. Smiles, and laughs filled the room. That and a mischievous dog eating the scraps under the table. It almost gave the philanthropist some envy about his rough upbringing. That is until he noticed, Steve's ever so present expression of sadness.
Steve thought angrily.
"No, no, no, not at all. I just have something to say to you is all." Tony blurted out. Regretting it immediately afterward.
"Yeah. I guess we do."
The pre-avenger shook his head in compliance. She continued it, and eventually began eating again while also giving a 'I'm okay' smile. The room continued in its silence for a little while.
"Oh... I see. Well, that's unfortunate." Annalise's expression soured.
"Well don't stay up for too long. Okay?" She said, a bit concerned. However, her concern subsided, feeling that her nervousness was just her girlfriend concerned mode kicking in. Honestly, Pepper wanted to hold him, kiss him, do whatever she could to calm him down. But she didn't want to step on his toes anymore.
"No Tony it didn't." Steve moved a little closer to him. The rage already gone, and the guilt filling in.
It was silent. Unbearably, and agitation-ally, silent. A silence that no one should hear. It was always hard for her to explain, the silence of that day. The one you hear, when your 6 feet below the ground, is the best analogy to it.
She wasn’t too keen on the idea of living out in the middle of nowhere, which apparently, was just outside of Fairburn.
The pain... the pain was the first thing that Steve felt. It was most apparent around his right temple. A trickle of blood dripping from said spot. His eyes barely opened to see a once familiar place, as his eyes came into focus. It was a circular type of tunnel, with pipes along the sides. It was an Air Raid Shelter.
"Again, Thank you. Truly, Tony, it's a nice offer. But I'll be okay here." Steve added.
"That's it? That's why you've been looking like someone has robbed you?! You're kidding right?".
Since the incidents, Steve has tried to be a bit more levelheaded when it came to the kids acting out. Parents can lose their temper from time to time, but never Steve. He never wanted these kids to have the childhood he had with his father. It sends a shiver down his spine to even think back to those days when Steve was nothing but a scrawny kid. And his life was nothing but an endless vortex of disappointment and worry.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony lifted a brow while showing a mischievous smirk. He picked up the pillow in front of him and concluded with, "Your on, Soldier!".
It seemingly had a red tint, which was an understatement considering the time of day. Whatever it was, it captivated Steve's attention. Even so, as the sun began to brighten the ether above, fading the little red star out.
Vision flustered his responses, but eventually gave up altogether. He came into the kitchen and stood opposite of Wanda.
He nodded at his companion. His wings making a soft 'thwypt' sound when deployed. Steve and Natasha grimacing at the sound echoing through the room.
The realization that Steve knew how to prepare, a man, for sex (You can thank Natasha for that one!). Yet was so enveloped in their situation that he completely forget about doing it, made Tony even more aroused.
"Steve?" Tony says a bit lethargic, "Hey? Are you alright, Cap?".
Natasha huffs quietly. She swiftly looks around from the table, that she sat pleasantly at, and begins walking to her car.
Natasha looked to her with aggravating patience.
"Hey, Stark." Were his first words to the man in 4 years.
"It's not only that... Tony." Steve admitted.
With every house he's looked at so far, seeing the same type of layouts, wallpaper, same everything. Steve knew that this wasn't for him. The house already seemed a little too perfect for his taste. He didn't need to see the rest of it to see that. It was the very thing that he was trying to get away from.
Steve chuckled and ripped the rope from his hands. Carefully lifting his friend up, they limped to one end of the tunnel, hoping to find an exit.
“Well, from my viewing, nothing is stopping you. So, could you do that for me? Pretty please?” He asked again. Batting his eyes at her.
The two sat quietly for a moment. Letting the sound of the other patron’s conversations flutter through their ears. That is until, Ziggy gazed over to the exit, and remembered something Steve had said earlier. “What was that
They just sat on the floor, side by side, and stared at the crackling flames of the fireplace. Relishing in the memory of what had occurred. After a few minutes, or an hour, no one really knows. They both realized that Pepper would be home soon.
White noise is all that filled her ears. It's static sound made her stomach twist and turn. What was she to do?
Tony only smiled, and walked back over to the soldier. He grabbed the collar of his shirt, and extended it past the reactor. Not really caring that it's surely stretching the collar out.
“Alright, punk. We'll stay here tonight if it will help you sleep at night.” Bucky responded.
"Ouch." Tony proceeds to playfully bow to her, before walking down the corridor to his room. Even though the sun shined brightly, it was nighttime in his eyes.
A gust of energy blew around the super-soldier when he shot up in bed. The ooze replaced with sweat running down his cheeks.
The two stood silent for a moment. Bruce then chose his next words very carefully. "Is this really about gaining closure, or just to make you feel better, Steve?".
Several SHIELD agents swarmed the co-leaders and urgently carried the injured Avenger to the nearby infirmary. Steve leading the way with electrifying speed.
Steve looked at her funny. "Kamala, I may be old. But I can handle a joke. Just tell me what it is?".
Steve felt his cheeks get warm. God, he hated it when Tony would tease him like this. He never understood the philanthropist's usage of flirtatious innuendos before. Yet, as he got to know Tony over the years, he knew that it meant that Tony was comfortable being himself around Steve. And the super-soldier was fine with it, even if it made him feel a little warm inside. He doesn't even remember when these
Tony noticed his departure and suddenly ran to him. He ran outside the house, and toward their cars.
But it didn't matter to him. Even if the philanthropist was arrogant at points, he shared a laugh with him every once in a while. And Tony trusted a lot of things with Vision.
Steve's ocean-like, heart-aching, blue, eyes; chiseled chin, bruised and bloody; and his hot yet, icy breath grazing his face. All of which summed up one word: Remorse. Even in the heat of the moment, Steve instantly felt sorrowful, destroyed, and remorseful.
This was the final straw, and oddly enough Steve hadn't even gone through the rest of the house. Or even thought of the possibilities of filling it with furniture to fix the dreariness of it all. But Steve, honestly, didn't need to.
"Tony? Are you okay?” He urgently whispered. Wondering if he was giving him a hint of sorts.
"Anyway, what I'm about to tell you guys is not a war story." Steve's vague hook line now has intrigued the team, Kamala especially.
He knew, he knew that it was... Tony. The ghost-like philanthropist suddenly turned to the soldier, and uttered a sentence that gave him his confirmation.
Both Sam and the man looked at him, humorously. They knew his tone was only out of slight fear of their cursory situation. Which is why it was so hilarious to the both of them.
His desire was wiping out half of Earth’s population. Mostly for life on Earth to prosper, and not struggle. And on that day. He succeeded.
"Steve... I may have met you, and Tony, almost a year ago now. But it surprises me that this hasn't happened yet!" She gave him a comforting smile while placing her hands on his elbows, "Now, go ask him to dance. Or I'll ask him for you.".
Tony once again, smiles in embarrassment. Yet still tries to calm Steve down, with some soothing hand movements down his back.
"Look Captain, I do have a name you know." Tony protests exaggeratedly.
Pepper noticed him and yet continually looked to the woods surrounding them. Steve tried to analyze her reaction, but ignored it once he sat next to her.
"Okay then, Cap. Where to?".
"What's it with you and Tony thinking, that I am capable of being in a affair?" He stated amusingly.
And he was being honest. Steve knew Pepper was the world to Tony. And when they had that little conversation, before... before Germany. He could read Tony like a book. He was hurting. And Steve only just added to that.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come on Steve. I was just playin around." He began, "You can't tell me no one has ever played rough with you?".
The two never really felt this much emotion, pain, and sensuality, in one situation, mostly Tony. This was the most comforted and aroused he's been, in a long time.
Tony had Morgan in his arms, as he came down the stairs. “You okay?” He asked noticing his wife’s constant staring off.
"Duly noted.".
Once the ship landed back on the landing deck, shield's officers ordered the Avengers down to the bridge. None of them wanted to face, a pissed Nick Fury. Tony was the only one who seemed ready to kick some ass. And he certainly was ready too. But he noticed Steve's manner of walking. It was a bit sluggish. Something that no one would've said he was. Tony interestingly, had a thought pop in his head, and of course acted on it. He walked up to Steve's side, and held his hand. Steve quickly yanked it from Tony's grip. Simultaneously, giving him a I'm okay look, and smiled. Once the group reached the bridge, Tony was about to apologize, until an obviously pissed Nick Fury, silenced him.
"How was work, today?" He asked.
A soft haze, from the running water of the shower, sneakily moved throughout the room. Adding to the dreamlike nature of the situation. And slowly awaking in the soldier's bed was a well-rested Tony Stark.
But today was different. Horribly different. Today, she had found out that she, had in fact, contracted the infectious disease. And it was tearing her apart on how to tell Steve. She really didn't want to. Sarah just wanted to bury it, like a dirty weapon in a crime. Or a horrifying creature chained in a basement.
Honestly, Tony wishes it was that easy. He'd have all the things in this world that make him happy. Yet that's not how most people would've saw it. Hell, they would've been on a damn TLC program, if it was still around.
This constant hiding, running, fighting, and repeat had became an immediate burden on all of their shoulders.
"Look man, I want to know what you meant about what you said." He started, "Did you say that last part for him?".
"I wouldn't trust myself with scissors. So I'd just go into town to get a haircut." Tony joked. Still hoping to break any more leftover tension.
The blonde took a deep breath and looked at the creature before him. A flood of confidence and strength overtaking his body. He showed no fear.
Hope you guys are doing well, and staying safe!
"Huh? W-What are you talking about?" Steve was utterly confused now.
The three guys broke out into some mild laughter. Sam being the most destroyed. He may have known Cap for a little while now. Yet, Steve still always surprised him every now and then.
"Tony, I know you've been going through things. And I think it's because you missed the team. That you missed, well... us, our friendship. And like I said once before, I am happy for you. But I am willing to do anything at this point... to help you." Steve stated calmly.
Happy’s gaze did not leave the philanthropist the entire time. He knew Tony was hurting, even if he didn’t want to admit it. His feet guided himself over to his friend, and he sat a comforting hand on his shoulder.
Natasha followed her and addressed to the Scarlett Witch that she was going to tell Steve of the plan.
She walked over and glared sheepishly at the mobile device. Hesitant to make anything really happen. Her fingers grazed upon the metal, with her hand cradling the device as if it was a child.
"Don't worry, I'll be fine." Steve gave his lover another long kiss, before dropping on the other side of the bed.
The brown wall trimmings along the peach-colored walls and dark oak doors, giving the house a comfy, nostalgic, warm feeling and look.
Apologizing in advance for some inconsistent posting for this and possible the next few chapters. Once I get enough feedback from you guys, I’ll try to be a bit more consistent with adding these chapters. But it’s really because I don’t see any activity with my stories, and I usually feel more confident about writing more chapters, when you guys respond with your beautiful messages and kudos!
“Aww thanks, Maguna. At least someone likes my cooking.” He affirmed.
"Why yes I am," He stated sarcastically, "In fact I'm so better, that I'm leaving now.".
The super-soldier went ballistic. Furious at how immature & careless Tommy went about the situation, and how he’s been acting. It even shocked Ziggy at how loud Steve was being.
Steve and Sam crawled to a conveniently placed bush, along the sides of the shelter. Amongst the shelter and Hydra associates, there was a beat-up, 5-story building, a few bunkers, and trucks loaded with more agents.
"Tony... you moved in front of me. It was going to hit me. You had moved right when that 'thing' whirled to life.".
His mind suddenly went to the fight with Thanos.
Once Steve came all the way down the stairs, did Tony notice that he had his arc reactor. The glow only illuminating a section of Steve's right peck.
They came downstairs to find Annalise looking worried as she twisted her wedding band over and over again. "Are you all right, miss?" Steve asked.
"Oh! Is he now?" Natasha's shit-eating grin, made Tony giggle uncontrollably.
bad word.
Steve just stared at her with disbelief. He thought he and Tony were alone. Then again, there were bays of windows surrounding them. 'What if she told Pepper? Jesus, Tony would hate me forever!' He thought, 'Well actually that last one doesn't sound so bad?'.
There were many days where he just wanted to pick up the burner phone, in his right pocket, and call him. But not even that, he wished he could talk to him, like face to face.
"How did you get all that from a glance?" Steve laughed.
“No, no. It’s fine. You must have some past then, Huh?” Ziggy smirked.
Pushing the dialed numbers, in which she saw upon the screen, the ringing that followed made her stomach crawl with concern. Is she almost betraying Vision's trust by doing this? And worryingly, what would he do in response?
"Now what's going on here?!" Steve addressed sternly.
The pictures of a certain Super-Soldier, Russian Spy, and Winged companion that were dispersed along this board. With pins and threads of rope connecting them to certain locations around the map, that sat as the backdrop.
"I will. Hopefully, I can come back with some better news.".
I'm here now. Where are you?
“You sure?”.
"Come on, we should see who needs help." Nat intervened. At this point, she knew Tony and Steve were good for each other, but the constant eye-fucking between the two, was a bit irritating. She wasn't against it, but they had pressing matters to attend two.
Yes, you read that right. Pepper had met Steve and Natasha earlier that morning, in town. They had bumped into her, after Natasha and Steve were helping this one old couple, grocery shop. Another story for another day.
The soldier recognized the car instantly. A feeling of guilt befell him. Instantly, he heard a few people talking from down below. Ziggy & Tommy came into view, of the window, and were approaching the car. Steve smiled a little at the protective expressions on their faces. That was until Tony Stark had stepped out, with a little girl following suit.
Which in turn, caused Tony to lean in, yet his companion averted his lips. He tried again, then again, until he suddenly became sporadic, with his advances toward the super-soldier.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Eight's fine with me. See you tomorrow, old man." Tony joked.
The super-soldier remembers the rest of the night being, him & Tony, talking some more before the brunet had to leave. Apparently, his driver was still in the car, waiting for him. They had talked for over 3 hours!
Knock-Knock, Kn-Knock, Knock.
'Wait, I can find them myself. Yeah, I can do this. I don't need, Tony, Wanda, or Vision.' She thought pridefully.
"No, Tony.” Steve insisted, “It's nothing. Just head back to sleep.". Not really caring to engage with Tony Stark's annual teasing fest just yet, Steve just decided to ignore the brunet. That lasted two seconds.
"So if we find them in a, you know, situation. Who’s  grabbing Tony, and who's grabbing Steve?" Clint asked amusingly.
Steve looked down and sighed. "You and I both know that it's not that simple.".
But beyond that, Steve just did nothing. Mainly at Nick's expanse for the world to believe that the old Captain America was retired. Which, drove the blonde crazy with anger.
"Viz, as blissful as that sounds. You know I can't." She said sorrowfully, "I cannot just abandon our plan, for... a life that we had put ourselves into.".
"Thank you, Buck." Steve walked over and gave him a needed embrace.
He threw the car into drive, and drove the car out of the parking lot. The shouting man stopped halfway down the road, and just gave up. But not before giving them ‘the finger’.
He kind of wishes he could take a match and just burn the room to the ground. But that’s a bullshit statement to the press, paperwork galore, and an angry Rhodey lecture of epic proportions, that Tony didn’t want to deal with.
Tony placed a hand on Steve's face and rubbed it gently. "Of course, I would.".
"You know, I never really learned how you got, that,  thing in your chest." Steve added. Instantly regretting at how he said it. 'That Thing,'.
“I wasn’t really going to show you this, until I thought you were comfortable enough, but I think you need it now, man.” He began, “I know you and Pepper still aren’t going too well, and all of this, is just more or so for paperwork.”. Happy pointed to the board before spinning Tony around, so that the philanthropist could look at him directly.
"Never mind that, you need to be honest. Not with me, but with Pepper. Both of you.".
Finally opening his door, he dismounted from his suit. Jarvis asked if it should return to headquarters, which is now the dismantled Stark Tower. Tony objects, and the suit powers down. He looked around his room for some comfier clothing, before a knock on his doorframe, spun him around. It was Steve.
Tony glared at him, wide-eyed. He'd never seen Steve get this emotional. Yet the sheer pain of his last comment, made Tony's blood boil. His expression went from shocked and confused, into an agonizing glare of pain.
"Steve? Everything Okay?" Tony asked.
"Sorry. I just don't usually do this.".
"Yeah. It’s a little strange why we keep ‘trying’ to.” Steve added.
The biggest indicator was the dusty crumpled-up letter, that sat atop a box right at the stairwell. Steve never got to reading the mysterious letter, or who sent it. But he kept it, just in case he ever felt curious enough to read one day.
"Yea, not his babysitter. But I'd have to say a long time." She says bluntly and gives him a more firm smile.
The guys would make it to the reunion, with Natasha, Clint, and Maria arriving afterward. They would scold the two men on how to pick up a phone. Having a few laughters following that.
"Hey, are you okay?".
“Okay, how about we go sit down and see if...” Tony was heading to the living room, when Steve grabbed his forearm, cutting him off mid-sentence.
Natasha and Steve, we're finishing off the rest of the agents, when the energy container began to malfunction. The glass that held the electronic beast began to crack. The roaring sounds growing louder and louder.
And yes, he was seriously psycho-analyzing his love life right now. I mean, they didn't have anything else to do. There were no hydra agents around. Which was strange? And truthfully, his thought process was surely clouding the sheer silence that was in the tunnel.
"It wasn't anything too strong before A-Day. But after... I realized... that..." He sighed in defeat. "Look, Steve. If you don't feel the same way that's fine. But that's why I didn't want to tell you. Your friendship, this team, means so much to me. And if I had let this slip, I...".
She quietly walked into her room and saw the little Stark asleep still. Morgan was laying on her side. Her hair covering her face, and her mouth slightly doing some butterflies, as she was a mouth breather. 'Just like her father!' She thought. Pepper smiled, kissed her forehead, and softly tiptoed back to the door.
"Pet the horses?"
"Fine. Look, I have to head out. I hope you're doing well." Natasha stated.
Before Steve could finish his explanation for why he needed him, Tony replied quickly with, "I'll be there around 11.".
Another house that came to mind was a 2,500 sq ft. log cabin in Maine. It had a beautiful mosaic interior, and he would've had at least a few acres of land on top of that. The only catch would be the summer months. When it would rain, the entire area would flood causing a multitude of water damage to the house. The city wouldn't fix the issue, and the bank surprisingly still felt it was worth selling.
"I will... I promise." Tony apologetically stated.
Tony quit stirring the pot and looked back to the super-soldier. Steve was standing awkwardly across from him. Continually leaning on one foot to the other.
"Alright. Can I ask... Why, where heading there, exactly?" Tony continued.
"Tony..." Steve looked almost disappointed, "Your with Pepper. Which means, this shouldn't happen. I don't even know what this is, to be frank. It's truthfully not right, to be kissing someone else if your in a relationship. No matter if she said it was okay or not. And you and I both know, that she would probably leave you, if she knew about this."
Steve nodded softly to the two of them. He then excused himself and off he went to his room. Thor and Bruce would follow him. Everyone could see that Cap was taking this harshly. But it confused Tony. He must've seen many people die during his time in the war. So what was different about today?
"Well... I was trying to make some breakfast for your guys. And I think it's kicking my ass. But, I think I'm getting the hand of it." He answered.
"So, may I ask why you've left the wonderful world of sleep, to this part of the ship?" She inquired.
The driver took the fourth dollars and gave them to Maria. "Alrighty now, y'all can get out of my cab now. Just don’t do anything stupid, 'Cause I ain't coming back for your sorry asses." He asserted amusingly.
To think, about various situations with his once friend. It always occurred though, when Tony was alone with his thoughts. If Pepper, or their daughter Morgan were in the room, his thoughts of the super-soldier would disappear.
It was a sunny, but bitterly cold morning. The snow that gathered in the night, was up to a mere 3 inches. With a soft glittery dew on the gutters that surrounded a 4- story, gambrel-roof-shaped, dutch-colonial home in upstate New York.
The super-soldier looked a little confused. He never told Tony that he drew. “How did you know that I draw in my spare time?”.
The soldier, however, did notice that Tony wasn't wearing a shirt. His back muscles ever so glowing amongst the red tint. But the further Steve took the situation in, the realization that Tony was nude under those sheets made the blonde’s eyes widen with surprise. It was more or so odd since he remembered Tony passing out the minute they got there. Clothes we're still very much on.
Tony gave him a suspecting smile, "Oh, well we are doing just fine. No not fine, we're doing great." He answered, "Why did you want to know?".
"Jesus! What was that for?" Steve wailed.
The trio had been following a lead with some illegal distribution, in a sea fair town just off the coast of Scotland. And of course, the main distributor was none other than... Hydra. What they were distributing, was still a mystery to them.
Tony similar huffed, and laid his back upon the couch. A few seconds dragged on. He had to tell her no. The philanthropist couldn't risk losing Pepper again. But at the same time, he was worried about them. Worried for Steve.
‘Pepper, Steve, Peter.’ He thought. The three names that gave him the biggest headache and heartache. One was a love he wanted back, One was a prodigy who looked up to the wrong person, and the other was a friend who broke his heart. A friend who was giving him clues, but clues to what?!
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, first things first, you're moving." Tony presupposed.
Steve then asked why she was roaming around that part of the ship as well. Her expression changed, and she took a glance back. Steve presumed it to be the science lab. His thoughts proceeded to tell him Pepper's answer, Tony.
He runs out the nearby door and looks around. On his right was the path back to the house, nothing at all. In front of him was the greenhouse, and on his left was the dock leading out to the river. He could hear the whines from over there.
He stood by the threshold, watching the family he created. It all felt nice. If almost a little too nice. Did it seem too domestic? Was this a cruel dream that Tony was having? Tony's never had this as a kid. And now he, all of sudden, is. It all felt... a little too perfect.
"Me and Sam are. Steve took a beating, twice." She uttered that last part. Steve had recovered, but still was resting quite a lot.
Ziggy scanned Steve’s face and could see nothing but a man trapped in a hellish memory.
The pain in Steve’s side seemed to subside, and the blood stiffened and dried quickly. Seriously, thank everything holy for the serum.
"Okay, we need to get Cap out of here. He doesn't look so good." Natasha stated.
However, one thing that had felt different about tonight than the others before it, was this feeling of comfort. It wasn't the motel, nor was it the bed he was sleeping in.
To which, Steve didn't mind the amount of people knowing anyhow. As it made days like today, when he needed help with the actual move, a lot more easier.
Growing up, he never felt the sensation of resilience, but after these last few months, Steve was ready to explode. He felt his days beginning to blur and become repetitive.
Steve was about to call them back, before a familiar sound made his heart skip a beat. Looking up they could see a Shield airship landing before them. This sent some of the crowds fleeing. The powerful air pressure coming from the propellers sent some more broken concrete down onto the ground. One piece barely missing a few shop owners. The Avengers felt a wave of disappointment fall upon them.
"Not really. But still, I never cared for being pitied. I do adore attention though." Tony smirked.
"We've become like Steve and Tony!" He wails.
Stranger things have happened.
"Are you sure, you two aren't having a secret affair?" Tony teased.
But after his kidnapping incident, she stopped the morning agony cries. Tony being gone two months really made her realize how much she actually liked his company. Even if it was mostly filled with them arguing about various things.
"Well... I... just watched, this movie, and it was honestly a wild ride of emotions." He lied.
As the sun had set, the two had to pretty much navigate the last few yards of forest in the dark. Which, was filled with trips and stumbles as tree limbs, and roots, unintentionally (or maybe intentionally?) laid in their path.
At one point he thought it was Brooklyn Heights. It was now run-down, or completely renovated to modern times to where it's barely recognizable to the super-soldier.
"Sorry. You know me, bad timing and all." Steve gave a halfhearted laugh.
Tony wasn't meeting his eyes, nor was he saying anything. This made Steve begin to feel uncomfortable. "What is it, Stark?".
Tony and Rhodes, who stayed cordial, tried to get back to normal life. But with Tony, he knew normalcy was no longer a virtue. The letter that Steve had given him after their clash in Siberia, gave him a little bit of hope, of redemption with Cap. But like their promiscuous act, a few years back, it became nothing more but a forgotten story.
That got Steve to actually chuckle. He never cared for Ziggy's sense of humor. But in the last few months, it's grown on him. It honestly reminded him of someone else's humor.
Exaggerating statements were never Steve's forte. But this one, sadly, was closer to the truth than most.
"If we give it more time, I'll be back in the ice." Steve joked.
Tony being the most affected. Their tension was growing, their breaths were hitching, and they were nervous as hell. The brunette felt himself pull his head in closer to Steve's.
"I am...promise. I want to help people. Just like you do." He replied.
But the ache didn't last, as she had to tell him of their situation. One, that she needed him.
We’re going to be stuck in this time frame for a good chunk of this story. So enjoy bearded Cap for a little while. Hope your enjoying the story! Don’t forget to leave a kudos, if you are!
"Look man, I'm sorry for what happened. But you at least need to know that... we tried. We tried our absolute hardest to save her..." He admitted.
"Pepper, I want to tell you something."
"Okay then, Steve. May I ask why your all alone, and are sad by one of the worst places to be sad at?" She crossed her feet and leaned against the table behind the two. Her veil dropping to her lower back.
by Ernest Hemingway, a classic in Steve's eyes. He spun to chapter 12 and began his descent into Pilar's confession to Maria. Not wanting to think about seeing Tony after a shower.
Steve gave his friend a playful smirk and a returning finger after that.
The super-soldier softly got off the sofa and headed to the shower. Stripping quickly, as if his clothes were covered in spiders. Steve jumped in, the hot water soothing the cramped muscles of his back and neck.
"Well, when your predicament ends, we need you to come with us downtown, okay?" The Russian asked with her typical smirk glued to her face.
he assumes.
With all this in mind, Tony sat on the couch in his living area. A spacious area in the backside of his property, that Pepper and he bought a few years back. The room itself, or really the whole house, was wooden.
Hope you guys enjoy! ❤️💖
The silhouette of a burly, broad-shouldered man coming into view. It was Steve, Tony didn't need to be awake to realize that. The soldier was carrying a tray filled with burgers, fries, water bottles, and sauce packets on the edge. A visible two sets of each item, for the presumption that Steve was hoping he'd be awake.
Steve had noticed another door leading outside on the back wall of the house. "Where's this lead to?" He asked politely.
Steve finally took a breath and looked to the philanthropist below him. Staring into those eyes that were reflective of his. They knew what they wanted to do. Steve knew what he wanted to do.
Before the two men could protest, the gun went off, and the hydra agent laid on the floor beneath them.
He jerked awake, eyes bulging, and filled with rage. His fists already balling and ready to go for some good swings to the unclear assailant before him. They soon softened, once he was able to make out who was in front of him. A smirk appeared, on his face, along with a wave of his right hand. Which, showed a cut on his palm.
He felt it give, but not before his right fist got a good shot at the agent's mouth. The man stumbled back just enough for him to trip over his feet. He crashed onto his back, with Sam toppling over him.
Don’t forget to leave a comment and a kudos!
"I'm this understanding, because you had the balls to actually come and speak to me about it. Not once, but twice." Pepper finally smiled at the soldier, "Just don't have sex with my husband again, or I'll castrate you both.".
"As the ship was nearing the rocky shore of Halifax, it failed to miss a rock under the massive waves. The ship inevitably scrapped, while also getting caught on, the rock. Causing the ship to heave horribly to port. Until capsizing altogether to that side." Steve began to tap his foot, nervously.
He finally looked to the soldier, who was on the verge of having a nervous breakdown. Tony had to think quickly. He didn't want to leave Steve in this confused, self-destructive state for too long. Thankfully, Tony's mind works quicker than he thought.
Tony just looked at him with eyes of distraught. Why would he do something like that without asking him? What purpose would it serve, other than his own? Yet Steve continued, and it made Tony sick to his stomach.
"Nothing. You can do nothing. You guys have caused enough damage." Wright angrily said, before him and the other officer left.
He doesn't remember when this feeling began. But for some time now, Steve has had this sensation of... something coming. Something weird, something strange. And when it did... Ugh, how Steve never wanted to finish the sentence.
Tony doesn't contribute anymore to the conversation. Signaling to Thor, that he was quite done with conversing for the night. Thor was about to apologize for his overstepping, but chose not too. If Tony doesn't want to open up, then there's no need to keep pushing.
The two were dashing toward the massive building on their right, hoping any weapons were inside. And truthfully, their hiding spot would at least be now made out of stone, not twigs and leaves.
"An idiot who apparently bought a farmhouse? What's next? Are you going to hire a couple of workers named George and Lennie?!" Bucky teased.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Steve, it hit me dire-" Tony began before Steve interrupted him again.
'What the hell, Steve?! Maybe, he's in the common room?'
It was one of Steve's encyclopedias. It was ripped and stomped in. Another sound had broke the silence. It was Steve, whimpering softly to himself. Tony ran the rest of his way to Steve.
She looked, and felt, beautiful. Yet, as she looked into the window, and saw her reflection. She wasn't smiling.
Sam felt a 'Shit!' leave his lips as the duo were caught. The hydra agents turned their attention to the two idiots, and sent their gun blasts toward them. They had surprisingly dodged most of them, but some were wildly close, in terms of impact.
"Don't worry! We can cover our tracks, Sam!" Bucky was laughing now.
"Who do you think would Top?" Nat asked intriguingly.
Once he awoke, he asked ‘where were they?’. “We’re somewhere near Drumrunie. It’s close to Ullapool.” Steve speculated.
Spinning on her heels, she headed back down to the swarms of people. Getting lost in the crowd pretty quickly. Many complimented her and praised her bravery, which was nice. But all that ego-boosting was beginning to feel a little smothering.
Tony chuckled. His laugh making Steve squirm inside. “I’ll hold you to that.” Tony instantly remembered the last time he heard that phrase. And just like that, the memories fled back.
"You probably have." Steve jested.
Tony, at first, was a little shocked at the blonde's advancement, but once he looked to his face. All discomfort flew away. He actually smugly smiled, at the sheer thought that he made 'Captain America' dazed and speechless.
So he got up, found the showers, and made himself look presentable. Staring in one of the mirrors, he felt himself remember the night before.
"Tony, I've been looking at houses for almost 5 days now. I haven't had this feeling for a house till I saw this place. I don't know what it is. But for some reason, I want to give it a chance." Steve admitted.
Steve felt hotter than hell. His face was hurting from the constant shouting, but he was far from finished.
"Yeah. Nice observation." He giggled. Still looking to the crowd and then eventually back her, and once again to the crowd.
"Tony, she was just concerned is all. And so was I." Steve said matter of factly.
With that statement playing in his head over and over again. He needed to talk to her. If not for last night, than for their discussion from before.
Steve heard footsteps approaching quickly, so he turned around swiftly. Force of habit. His expression was quickly changed as he noticed Pepper and Nat walk in the room. Pepper greeted him, and Nat smirked at him with a peculiar smirk. Steve didn't pay much attention to it, as she always looked like that.
"Yeah, I know. I was kind of stalling in my car. Before I headed up here.".
'Good Job Rogers, now it was a waste of time heading back down here!' He thought aggravatingly.
"No, I just have this pain in my back for some reason." Tony gave him a half-smile.
Once the duo carefully walked outside, the trucks were gone, the agents were gone, everything was gone. It was as if nothing was there. A ghost town for sure.
The philanthropist eventually was given a new feeling. And it was glorious! By the end of it all, they could only be described as sweaty messes of magnetically ardent.
Pepper just stood, with her typical 'keep trying to save yourself with dumb excuses' face.
“Yeah… told you. It’s not just fighting aliens and disobeying the government that keeps me up at night.”.
Vision chuckled softly. He grabbed her hand and rubbed it softly.
Tony chuckled, but then stared off. The two men lost their smiles, and... Oh god, it's quiet again!
"What's that supposed to mean?!" He expressed laughingly.
“Really, my life hasn’t been all it’s seemed to be. I have my fair share of demons to deal with.” Steve swallowed, “For starters, my mother used to be abused by my father. Every night he’d come home, drunk as usual. He’d let his insecurities get the best of him. And I could never defend her like a good son should! I couldn’t even take her away from that place.”.
Tony just stood at the sink window, watching his husband heave the snow on opposite ends of the driveway. It warming his heart to see how productive and sporadic he is. Albeit, sometimes at a great annoyance to the brunette.
It did. And Steve still feels embarrassed about it. And why not bring it up to the man himself, so that he can use it as a funny story to tell the rest of his friends.
"No, we weren't going to keep it from you. I just didn't want to make our little situation worse." Tony attested.
Steve said ‘Bye’ to the blonde, and 4 hours later, here we are. The super-soldier completely losing his mind.
Simultaneously, Tony would still be haunted by his experience in New York. Which in turn, grew his paranoia of wanting to save the people with newer suits, and gadgets. Which that would coincide with the strain that he put, on his and Pepper's relationship. Eventually leading to a slight break between the two. Unbeknownst to Tony, is an enemy of his, would create a fake terrorist group (The Mandarin), to deceive him, and try to assassinate the president. Their house would be demolished, and Pepper would be kidnapped, and experimented on as well. Eventually he was able to find her, and save her, and was able to save the president in the nick of time. Afterward, Tony would retire from being Iron Man, as he would have surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart.
Speaking of said parents, one was currently rustling in his sleep. When suddenly, a loud noise was heard. It rattled the house a little, shaking any chinaware vigorously.
Steve smiled before he approached the philanthropist. He let the spoon graze his lips, not wanting to put a lot of it in his mouth. But after tasting the soup, he kind of wished he fell back on that mindset.
He looked back to the stone in strange amusement. Its aura now dimmed, no longer sensing his presence near it. A sudden flash of red filled the room, dissipating as fast as it came.
"No it's okay. I guess, I needed someone to give it to me straight." He said softly while smiling.
"Well yes, I know that. But has he been acting strange?" He asks. Maria takes a bit of time to understand why he would care this much? They literally were fighting like cats and dogs a few hours earlier. "Why do you want to know, so much?" She persisted.
Filled with dozens and dozens of plan discussions. Each one trying to find a solution, but ultimately failing by the time it got there. Steve being the most annoyed at this fact.
"Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you both about that. What
"Yeah, that would be nice," Steve uttered. A simple smile appearing on his face.
"Steve, I do a lot things, that have no context. It's just in my nature. And back to the Pepper situation, she just came in, like everyone else, and expected me to open up. It's just not something I do easily." Tony stated calmly, as he stuffed his mouth with some nuts. Just because it was 1 in the morning, doesn't mean he has to starve himself.
"I just don't understand? Why would she be so open to something like this?" Tony cried. He felt his tranquil paradise, was now falling around him. Steve took another step closer, feeling utterly destroyed.
"A bit of both. More or so, the 'feeling better' aspect." He admitted disgustingly, "God, how am I this selfish?! Here I am thinking about my feelings as if I was the one who was lied to!".
The philanthropist brought out a profanity that was muffled, as his face was buried into the soldier's neck. While there, he planted some soft kisses from where his mouth could reach.
"So have you really finally come to rescue me, Captain? Or are you going to wait till it's
"Well... Alright Then, Thank you for understanding!" He cheered. As he gave the built man a hug. Tony's heart fluttered once again, once his chest met Steve's. So secure, so close, so comforting. Tony was seriously screwed. Why now does he develop feelings for a man? One he just met, and in the middle of another solid relationship he has with a beautiful, caring woman.
“Well... I... uh... yea.”.
All of them were victims of people kicking children out of their homes once the Avengers brought everyone back. Especially since a lot of these kids had made a life after the decimation, and were now forced to leave the life they had gotten acclimated to. Reasons for why brute force was taken, in some instances, were never given.
The two men finally had reached the stairway, at the end of the tunnel, leading up to the surface. And as the sun temporarily blinded them, the scene before them, made the two duck for cover.
"Tony, I... for once, don't have anything to say. I think you pretty much solved it yourself. In a way, I guess I was... Or am like a... comforting booster."
Alongside the agents were hundreds, if not thousands, of crates filled with their weapons. The purple hue barely illuminating their presence in these boxes.
“Yeah. And look, man, I don’t judge you at all. I know that Tony and that girlfriend of his were still together, when you guys, you know, did your thing.” Sam added, “But Nat told me that you and he sorted it out. And that y’all we’re good.”.
"After this whole mission or really whatever assignment Fury wants us for. Let's have a guys night. Stress-free. Or at least less obligated to be arriving somewhere else." Steve exhorted.
"To not to." Both Tony and She answered.
Their sight seeing was short lived as Clint had some more jokes to throw out. All ranging from sexual to just down right kid like. Never the less, they still got a reaction from the other two women. But the driver almost seemed to get annoyed after each one he told. The group simply ignored the taxi driver's strange behavior, and patronizing glares at the road. Maria, blamed it on the stereotypical rudeness that most people believe New Yorkers to be. And so, Clint decided to go on.
"Hey! I wear that title proudly!" Tony joked.
Steve shrugged his shoulders, "No reason, really. You two just seem good together. But, why did you lie to her, when she was trying to calm you down. I mean, I know that I'm old fashioned, and forgive me for my prying, but that doesn't seem great to me.".
Steve and Sam just stood for a moment. Blankly staring at the dead agent. “What the hell are we going to do now,” Sam stated softly.
"Tony-You can't be serious..." Steve expressed once again aggravatingly, "I mean... Are you sure?! Because I don't want to do this, if you feel the need to force it.".
And it worked as he didn't even notice the bathroom door had opened and Tony had walked to the opposite side of the bed. The philanthropist threw on some sweats, leaving no shirt on as Steve hadn't. The super-soldier then, felt the philanthropist get into the bed. No conversation starter, no joke of any kind, just simple breaths being taken by both the men.
"No real reason. I just have an interesting feeling.".
"Hell, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't even want to suggest it!" Steve stated. The air was beginning to thicken in the kitchen, so he had to move to the foyer just to breathe again.
That one stung. But she wasn't wrong either. Steve knew how people viewed the Avengers. Especially after Thanos's decimation in 2018. And he knew Ziggy's words were out of hurt, rejection, abandonment.
"Are you guys okay?".
"Don't gotta tell me twice, Rogers," Tony stated.
The house soon fell quiet once more. Once there embrace ended, Steve softly laid his head down onto Tony's. Forehead meeting forehead, and nose meeting nose. He took his index finger and wiped the single tear from Tony's cheek. That strange tear, whatever it was, became something special between the two.
The cold air that surrounded the Chimera, this December night, mischievously found its way through the vents. Its howling noises signifying its presence amongst the patrons aboard. Sending literal and metaphorical chills up everyone's spine.
"Sorry. I know I'm being a little-".
One that Tony would want to happen again, and again. He wanted to be enveloped in Steve's passion. His gentleness, his lips... his firm hands. Oh, how Tony wanted those hands that caressed his slim, but still muscular, body. Those ocean eyes that looked at him so lovingly, and amorously.
It was a v-neck, mermaid red evening dress, with black high heels to boost. Now making her a bit taller than Tony. A white, faux fur shawl draped around her shoulders. Along with a multi-diamond bracelet on her left hand. Finishing the look, she had grown her hair out, as Kamala had. And she too, put her hair in a half up half down style.
Eventually, the two stumbled (And no, I’m not exaggerating) into a room, that thankfully had no outside windows. It was dusty, the putrid odor was present, with it being almost pitch black in there.
And finally, he got put in that direction, when a few days ago, Clint had called him to see how he was doing. Which was strange, since he and Clint never were that close. But the two men gained a familiar friendship after Natasha's death.
"It begins on a ship. The year is 1883. The ship is a marvel for its time. 700ft long, and holds at least 4 masts, for sailing purposes. Even though it was powered by boilers and a fully functioning funnel.".
Steve suddenly, could see the worry in his husband's eyes. And instantly froze at that realization. He turned to face the brunette with a question ready to come out.
"To be fair, I don't need my answer now do I?" Steve grinned cheerfully.
"Yes, that's fine. And please call me Steve. Hearing
His assumption seeming correct when the door to the infirmary opened softly as if someone didn't want to wake him.
"Thank god!" Sam exasperated.
A few minutes passed, the feeling, annoyingly, itching at him ever so quickly, so the soldier began to feel a little nosy. He supposed he could pass the time by looking around the property, thinking that Tony is probably running late.
Luckily, he noticed his gun wielding, machine-winged friend, at a table, a few feet from him. And to his surprise, a man sitting opposite him. It wasn't anyone he knew. This man looked a bit heavy, decent hair style, and seemed intimidating from afar.
But as he and Sam, crouched and silent from their hiding spot, listened to the hydra agent's ramblings. Even in Russian, Steve was able to pick up on a couple of things the crazed man would say. All thanks to a certain, red-head, assassin, who was probably snapping necks as we speak.
The grieving father looked into Nat's eyes. Her glare did not break, as she was hell bent on expressing/showing her truth. She didn't care how long they would have to stare at each other. If it meant that he could see her honesty, than that was fine for her.
"Who doesn't know that story. It's one of your most famous." She stated. Her voice was strong, but there was a sarcastic tone to it.
"Breakfast is ready. I'm going to get Morgan up." He answered, before disappearing back into the house.
"Oh God..." he expressed.
Regardless, Steve knew that house was out of the question from the minute flooding was involved. Water damage is a nasty and expensive dilemma to have.
"Yes, Cap. I would love to." Tony smiled.
Once inside, Steve let himself be drawn to anywhere in the house. Yet, he ended right back near the sofa, where it all came to Steve like a dream. Everything about that night hitting him, like a dump truck.
As Sam entered his room and looked around for an exit, there wasn't one; his assailant entered inside. Sam shot his weapon, but it misfired. The agent just took his, and smashed it to the winged-soldiers right leg.
Steve's thrusts suddenly began to curve, as he had remembered, from Nat's Sex Ed session, of a certain spot known as the prostate. That you can hit, which sends an arousing sensation, so quickly, through the body. It'd make anybody 'cream their jeans' as Clint added.
! Now, normally this wasn't much of a big deal to someone like Steve. I mean he slept in the barracks for God’s sake. But this was different. This was Tony Stark, the man that Steve has, most recently, been admiring. A man who’s influenced Steve’s life, time and time again. And here this man was, sleeping next to Steve so domestically, when they both have been running on a 4-5 month-long rehabilitation situation. It didn’t help that the way Tony was sleeping honestly sent butterflies into Steve's stomach.
But it didn't. Tony was still trying to do things himself. Deal with his problems himself.
Some more agents of Shield arrived, as the small get together/reunion was now in motion. Happy and Sam would arrive at 8:00, being fashionably late as always. Yet there was a certain philanthropist, and Spangly Tights missing. Everyone knew Rogers's and Stark's return to the Avengers would be an eventful one. Of course, Nat, Fury, Maria and Clint were the only ones who knew of the duo's miscellaneous act, yet all the rest of them were just simply waiting. But still no sign of Tony Stark or Steve Rogers. Nat was starting to get a little worried. More so towards Steve, as Tony was always the one to have an exaggerated, dramatic, entrance.
“Come with us to Scotland. You don’t have to be right on top of us, you can still keep your distance. Seriously, why didn’t we think of this sooner?!” Wanda joked.
Pepper, who was currently sitting on a nearby porch swing, also stared out to the body of water. It now holding her husband’s heart. Morgan sat next to her, nibbling on a cheeseburger that Happy bought her.
"Are you alright Mr. Stark?".
'Never danced before, my ass!' Tony thought.
He still never really forgave her for it, but was willing to put it behind him. And truly, it was becoming more and more apparent that it might come true. Maybe it wasn't meaning that all the Avengers didn't die at once, but over time.
Pepper tasted it. It was just plain old gravy, but it tasted wonderful. "This is delicious. Did you add some spices to it?".
Bucky pulled out his middle finger before disappearing into his & Sam's room. Leaving the soldier alone on the porch.
It is now the late-fall of 2024. And we’re finally getting to meet Steve’s pseudo-children.
"If you must know, we were wanting to go outside and pet the horses." She continued.
There were a few others on the other side of the room, and the only other Avengers that were there that night were Clint and Bruce. Who, were currently in their rooms fast asleep.
‘Cause if it took him a month for something like this? Then god only knows what else he’s been planning.
A loud noise from the house awoke Steve from his daydreaming and he rushed back onto the porch. Knocking again, this time on the screen door, Steve once again was waiting for the philanthropist to appear. His wristwatch showing 8:25 now.
"Yeah, you did good out there, Kamala," Steve interjected. His tone filled with a bit of his constant worry for the girl. Kamala thanked him nonetheless.
Some could say his assumptions were more for his benefit or state of mind. But it made him feel a bit better, knowing that they wanted to be seen by him.
Regardless, whoever was still left aboard the Chimera was surely suffering. The temperature outside would only rise to 15 degrees. Due to the fact, that they are currently a flying ice block, in the sky. Inside, Tony was only able to get the temperature to a toasty 45 degrees. They'll be fine... sort of.
“Nothing. Nothing at all.”.
He was really going to doing this.
"I can help if you want?" He turned to his husband.
"I haven't spoken to them in weeks. Last I heard they were heading up north." She admitted, "I told them to keep in contact, but they aren't holding up their end of the bargain.".
His inner thoughts were suffocating him. This was his true ultimatum. Albeit with an obvious answer.
Steve then realized how small he was compared to the hulk's size. Bruce's large green, forearms enveloping the soldier in a tight squeeze.
Tony actually smiled at the soldier. Which, almost instantaneously eased Steve's nerves.
That one, stood tall, yet small compared to the others. Barely a firm roof to boast about. Carpets who? They had squeaky hardwood. Curtains why? They had blankets. Truly, it was an honest shithole for those first few days.
He rolled his eyes. "I meant. An actual drink."
Steve carried Vision's body (the only one to be murdered by Thanos without the snap) back to the Wakandian fortress that was T'Challa's. But now is a reminder of his presence than anything else.
"To late honey, jury's out." Tony clapped back.
“Repress you?! What the hell are you talking about?! Who are you?” Steve demanded.
She felt her cheeks blush a bit. He's never referred to her as Ms. Widow. But he did, and she felt like a little girl getting a secret admirer letter in her school locker. Nat sat his drink down, yet keeping the gaze she had with him. Their amorous behavior wasn't odd to Fury and Thor, as they already knew something was going on there.
"Wait, what?! I don't—"
"Because, I need you to be away from Vision to tell you this.".
As she began her recollection of the duo's miscellaneous act. Unbeknownst to them, a super-soldier could hear her recollection. He wasn't really eavesdropping, if he could hear her from the vents.
His hands all black and rusty looking. The grease stains all over his face and arms. The sliver of tongue he would show when he was in 'the zone'. Steve sometimes, would let a snicker leave his lips. Only for Tony to rearrange his face, and look more 'tough'.
“I caught you once. It was a few weeks after, you know, Loki...” Tony began to trail off, “Anyways, You were outside sketching the skyline. And from what I could see, it wasn’t bad.”.
He sighed and decided that getting a motel for them was the best option for the time being. They can look for this house tomorrow.
Tony Stark couldn't tell you the last time he felt content with his life. And even if he unknowingly was. Content was still a better way of putting it. If it was before A-Day he'd be lying to himself. All those sleepless nights, doing whatever with whoever.
When they stopped cursing, the two stood in utter embarrassment. Tony looked up to Steve; felt his face grow stricken, and utterly looked regretful.
"How do you think he's doing?" Natasha asked.
It was already a tense day, with dozens and dozens of attempts with the lullaby. Bruce was near a breaking point. Having to constantly morph into the Hulk was truly exhausting. But it was even worse for Nat, as this day in particular, she couldn't get him calm. Practicing with the lullaby was a work in progress. And today was one of the fails. Once Bruce had turned green, Nat took a sharp breath, and began her walk towards him. He screamed his ear screeching roar, while also punching/hitting the concrete walls that surrounded them. Smashing them each with an intensity equal to an airplane crashing into the ocean. Extending her hand out, she softly began humming. It caught Hulk's attention, yet his beast self was refusing to listen.
If Past-Steve could move his freakin' head out of the way, that would be lovely. But Past-Steve was too busy kissing the brunette's lips. Constantly heading back up for air, only to gently place his lips back onto Tony's.
Who could she talk too? Wanda or Vision? No, she hasn't heard from them in a while. Possibly Shield? That one hasn't been much help either. Thor or... Bruce? That would be just plain awkward.
The soldier suddenly heard a familiar commotion from the room right across from the master bedroom. It was Sam & Bucky, unsurprisingly. Arguing about whether or not, whoever was going to sleep on the floor, or the bed. The argument before this was which room they were sleeping in. And to think that Steve thought Tony and himself were bad. Bucky & Sam were on another level.
And so, Steve entered the empty home swiftly. Hoping that any tears wouldn't flow. They did, however. When his eyes fell upon the sofa. The Sofa.
“Okay, yes. But that was in the moment. Nothing more, nothing less.”.
The escalation, occurring a few yards from the Ex-Avengers, was in fact, their lead with Hydra. So the trio dispersed and quietly approached the ongoing riot. Natasha scurried through the crowds, and stopped abruptly once she noticed the two men standing before her. One with an eye missing, and the other with a beard similar to Steve's. Holding the weapons that Sam was right about.
At that moment, Steve wishes he wasn't the political figure everyone knew him as. He wanted Ziggy to see that it was Steve Rogers that was talking to her. Not Captain America, or Rogers, or an Avenger, none of that.
"Oh, Tony! Let's hope this one's a keeper." He joked.
"Yet you sound so amused." She retorted.
The blonde then contacted Clint, and then, Bruce. Clint would be busy most of the day but said he'd at least be able to help Steve load some of his things into the trucks. Bruce said that he'd be available and would be there first thing tomorrow morning.
"Anytime, pal. By the way, what time are you picking me up? 'Cause mom said I have to be back by no later than 10:00." Steve could practically see Tony smiling at this point.
It wasn't anything awkward between the two. They knew of each other's fascination and infatuation with one another. So during situations like this, they just went with it. Especially since they were on the run.
"It's beautiful." He said.
"Wanda, I need you to meet me at the Tower Restaurant.".
Steve remembers the genuine smile that Natasha had the entire time. Tony even teased her about it. "Someone got this one to smile? Am I witnessing a miracle right now?!".
Tony gave her a smug smile and proceeded to kiss her cheek. His attention quickly going back to his homemade biscuits in the oven.
"Steve... Are you even hearing yourself?! I can't just cheat on my wife! It's wrong! It's, it's immoral. It's honestly, something I would've done a long time ago." Tony griped aggravatingly, "And I have put those days behind me, where I want them. And if that means not having the Avengers, or you in my life. I am willing to do that for her, and Morgan.".
The room situation, also unsurprisingly, didn't take much coaxing to it. It honestly came down to who knew who the best. And who was lucky enough to get the sofa downstairs. That lucky person turned out to be a volunteering Clint, who didn't want to fight over rooms.
Tony chuckled. Wasn't he supposed to be like livid at him? Wasn’t he supposed to be hating the super-soldier? Cursing his name to the heavens, for his parents, for Thanos, for Peter?
"Good Morning to you, Tony." Steve leaned further, now placing a soft kiss on the brunette's lips. Hoping to ease the tension as well.
"What do you mean? What aren't you telling me?!" He inquired frustratingly.
Like the other day, he had to get onto Tommy for leaving the car unlocked. The brunet ran into town to grab some groceries, for reasons Steve didn’t remember at the time. And when Tommy returned, he irresponsibly, not only, left the groceries in the car but also left the keys in the ignition.
"I can tell." Steve smiled this time.
"Sounds like this one's the winner, then?" Tony smiled earnestly.
Tony frowned in annoyance, as the teen laughed all the way back up to his apartment.
She had no knowledge of anything. No clues, no more leads, nothing at all. Just herself, a few bruises, and a super-soldier and his winged companion missing. Seriously, she was screwed, and desperately needed help. But from where?
Regardless, a few days passed and by April, Steve finally had felt like he had a family again. And he sure as hell wouldn’t be trading them for anything in the world. He was, at last, comfortable with the life he was living. Even if there still was something, or really someone, leaving him
“And that’s my point. You want to help him. You want to do all these things for him. Because you feel guilty. You miss him, you miss his friendship.” Sam attested, “Give it time, man. Eventually, you’ll hash your shit with him, and you guys can become friends again.”.
Sam looked to the 'black widow' next to him. Finding his friend's usage of a fork for a burger and fries, kind of hilarious. Surely, he at least knew that you don't have to cut up a burger to eat it.
"But the strangest part. Was that the ship never sank. Even though it had a high possibility to do so. Yet it stayed afloat till most of the passengers could flee to the nearby village." He scanned their faces.
Steve stood, dumbfounded. Was he really that oblivious to how he acted around Tony?
"But anyway..." Tony sighed. He walked over to his incredibly messy station, still mumbling to himself, and was about to pull the monitor back up.
Steve was the first to stand up, and walk up to the bathroom. Tony did notice this and stared at his companion the entire time. He would follow later, once he heard the water quit running. And like a list of chores, he made his way to the shower, cleaned up, and eventually stumbled into his bedroom.
And as he stood, peering out his bedroom window, looking out to the barn on the left side of the yard. Steve sighed in respiration. Hoping this home-sick feeling would eventually leave him in the next week or two.
"I've got someone to be nostalgic. That's a first for me." He jokingly stated.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nope. And I feel like an asshole who ditches a pretty girl after having sex with her." He states a bit more seriously.
Steve just stood for a little bit, utterly confused as to what just happened. He and Tony were literally just chewing each other out. Yet one simple kiss changed their moods?!
"I contacted Stark, again. To see if he could be of any assistance with this little dilemma. And he was actually able to be of some help." She continued.
"Ooh, I think you left the chicken in there a little to long." Steve teased, as he exaggerated a mouth chomp, as to say the chicken was hard as a rock.
Suddenly, Vision emerged from behind her. As she turned around, her slight scream bombarded Vision’s ears.
Was it Kate? Bruce? Tony? It had to be them. They were the only ones in his line of sight. And he was trying to be careful about it. Looking up at them only in spurts. 'Aww, poor pining Steve Rogers!' She giggled. Catching the soldier's attention.
The soldier got up from the bed, already wanting to leave the confinement of his bed, anyway. Grabbed a bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door, and headed out to the 2nd story porch.
"Come on, Steve! It's already cold outside. I, at least, want to pet them before it drops below zero!" Jenny complained.
Peter looked confused momentarily until his question fell back in his mind.
"It's a surprise. Just know that it'll be some time soon." Steve placed a final kiss onto Tony's lips. Ignoring the other's questions, the super-soldier walked further into the ship. Tony eventually going in the opposite direction to the lab.
'Oh, Shit! Abort mission! Abort Mission! Abort! Abort!'. The footsteps walked past the door.
He sniffed away some more tears. After taking a shuddering breath, he finally looked to Tony. "H-How..."
It actually made Happy shiver a bit. That is until Steve broke character into a cheerful smile. Relieving the fake tension between the two.
Envy. Envy could do something to a person like Tony. Lashing out through alcoholism, playboy rumors, and no empathy or remorse towards others but himself. But looking back now, as Tony sat quietly during this very long meeting, he honestly remembers some good moments too. More or so with Maria and Jarvis than Howard. Still, good memories overall.
Steve smiled this time. There was a pregnant pause when he spoke again. "Why are you up, anyway?".
"No problem, Rocket-Man."
"What can we do to help?" Steve asked concerned.
Steve took the doll and headed upstairs to put it away. Their room would be too obvious so he decided to put it in one of the off-limits rooms: the attic. The soldier took the tiny staircase, adjacent to Peter & Tommy's room, and up to the attic. Once there, he realized how he hasn't been up here since last year.
Wanda felt sorry for the other woman. Even though she didn’t know much about Natasha, she would consider her friend. A friend who would have her back if she needed it.
“Yes, I just... uh... just...” Steve trailed off.
The man looked at them with pride, even smiled, with trickles of blood seeping from his busted lips. He sipped some of the blood into his mouth, and then spat it onto Sam’s face.
Natasha walked slowly back to the table, feeling a little relieved. She would sit there for a few more minutes, before heading off to Steve’s apartment complex.
Pacing in his stateroom, mumbling to himself, was his way of thinking quickly. The only sound being that of his suit, from the constant movement. He truly didn't want to leave without helping somehow. But before he could finish his thinking process, the announcement overhead, stating their departure from the skies and back onto the sea, clouded anymore thought processing.
Every single graze of Steve's fingers, kiss upon skin, shots of breath, hip-thrust, and lascivious moans. All of it ran through Tony's mind. Their sweat-soaked bodies moving in-sync with one another. Tony's hands constantly gliding along Steve's back and chest. Everything about their erotic experience was a beautiful affair.
"Yeah, I do too. I think whatever happened in Siberia, really affected them both."
"All the hospitals are relentlessly full, both in the emergency room, and morgue." Officer Wright of the Manhattan Police Dept. stated morbidly, "Honestly, when we find dead bodies now. We just say a few words, and then toss them into the ocean.".
Nevertheless, Tony was quite comfortable with how much has changed in the last 4 years. But still, one thing remained the same. Steve Rogers.
"Come on guys! She's lost a lot of blood!" Nat yelled, still trying to keep the girl calm. Clint knew time was of the essence. So he picked up the piece of metal and through it to Steve, who caught it just before it took out Bruce's eye. Once Clint came back, the three pushed down with all they had. And this seemed to work, before it fell back down, hard. This sent the girl to a screaming fit of pain and hysterics. Nat tried to continually calm her, but it was futile.
And in the process, she headed back out to find some answers, anyway she could. Natasha was going to find them.
He missed those glistening eyes, her smooth skin, her wavy hair, and those pristine lips of hers. He truly just missed her presence. It was so inviting, and kind. But if he let, losing Peggy eat him up, he wouldn't be where he is at now. Life is about moving on, not relinquishing in your past.
To: Natasha
"That's funny... Tony." Steve voiced unimpressed.
“Did we?” Tony uttered.
"Okay. Just don't drink the entire bar out. Or there will be consequences when I get back." Tony teased.
He remembers seeing her back in the 70's. Her brunette hair with strands of grey, similar to Tony’s. Her always demanding yet, loving personality, glaring at him from beyond that glass. And with that, the emotions followed it. He could go back to her. Back to feisty, but kind-hearted, Peggy Carter.
Proceeding to move his hands back up the soldier's spine, Tony eventually nodded again. Signaling to Steve, that it was okay to pick up some pace. Tony's soft breaths now grew a bit louder, while also slopping some more kisses onto the super-soldier's lips.
Tony smiles with him as he recognized Steve's obvious parallel. Truthfully, they wanted to have these moments, to grow as people.
The super-soldier looked back to Tony. Resting peacefully with no indication of waking up anytime soon. Steve just needed to breathe. Everything was fine, he is fine, Tony is fine.
happen? I only got fragments of it when we came back." Bruce inquired.
The soldier was about to head back up to the house and investigate there, if it wasn't for a strange light blinding him. It was coming from beyond the river, just above the horizon line.
Thousands-Millions of people, wailing, crying, and suffering. And they were the cause of it, not Thanos. They didn't fight hard enough. The Avengers did not avenge anyone.
Again, the philanthropist just stood quietly. Hoping he'd catch onto Tony's wink-wink. Instead, Steve just placed his hand on the brunette's lower back and entered his personal space.
Once there, she pretty much told the man a surprisingly believable lie. To which Vision relented in letting her leave so abruptly. Even if it was to go get her hair, nails, and makeup done.
"Leaman... Leaman Place is the street name." He said.
Not since his nights with Pepper, did Tony ever enjoy such a climax. Yet his climax with Steve, was dare he say it, wildly better. Almost feeling completely new and different. That almost scared Tony, before the thought left his mind as his thought process was surely blown.
Barely from the blurry vision he received from that concussion he gave himself, Steve could see something leave out of a doorway. "Where are you going?" He shouted at the creature.
"Excuse Me, could you get him a drink!" Shouted Natasha from the other side of the table.
Anyway, don’t forget to leave a kudos and comment! There always greatly appreciated! ✌🏻🥰
"That's because I knew better. Y'all seem to do better when I leave you guys in the dark." Fury answered.
All in all, Steve had been a lot more stressed out, and in desperate need of something more than just vent talks with Clint.
Nat just shrugged, seeing as Steve's etiquette at the dinner table kind of adorable. Eventually, she looked out to the bay, sitting by them. Deep in thought.
"I'll talk to him. See what's wrong with him. Or try at least." He assured her. Pepper gave him an obvious awkward handshake. This made Steve chuckle, and off she went. Continuing down the corridor, he bumps into Maria Hill. Well isn't he making some more good impressions. He asks her how long Tony's been cooped up in the lab.
Sam stood by the container trying to figure out how to turn the machine off. Running around it, looking behind it, under it, just everywhere. Finally, he noticed a small panel, just below the glass cracks, on the opposite side of Steve and Natasha.
Steve just chuckled, and slowly walked out of his stateroom. Tony waved goodbye, and eventually slipped under the covers.
"You alright Cap?" Tony asked. He had noticed a soft tear slide down Steve's face. Steve felt it go, and honestly didn't care. He felt angry, at himself mostly. 'Why didn't we try and help?' Steve thought sadly. Steve must've shown it, as Tony just suddenly grabbed the forearm of his suit. He knew Steve was beating himself up for their inability to help clean up, and Tony wasn't having it.
"I know I never can have her back. And I know that you guys were doing your jobs." The driver continued, "They said with time it's get better. That it wouldn't hurt as much; Well I don't know what the hell they were talking about. 'Cause it hasn't.".
worry of rejection?"
Including this chapter, was a back and forth issue for me. By religiously following the ‘Don’t go off the plot’ rule, I had to try and create a sequence that wouldn’t affect anything extremely. As to tie this into the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, later on. But anyway here it is, hope y’all are enjoying the story.
"Dad, I'm 13. My handwriting is phenomenal. Unlike, Sis." The other added.
The blonde smiled his warm, inviting smile, and looked to the reactor. He'd never seen anything like it, and yet Tony made it in a cave.
The crisp, chilly, night air gave Steve a chance to finally take a breath. He closed his eyes momentarily before he heard a noise behind him. He shot around to see Bucky coming outside.
Steve's confidence now flew out the window. He looked away disgustingly. But her tone was as if she was disappointed. He quickly looked back to her and could read her false expression.
"Don't! No, Steve, you can't take all the blame for this. It's all our faults." She exclaimed.
, I've told you a thousand times. Just because your name was first on the tag doesn't mean the doll is specifically yours. It's yours and Tina's, end of story!".
He too didn't want to do this to Pepper. But she agreed. Fishy as it is, she still gave her permission. But it's the one reason why Steve was terrified about going through with it.
"Hurry up, Sam! We need help!" Steve yelled.
Steve took a glance to the confused philanthropist, and immediately felt amused by it. He knew Tony would be confused, and he knew Tony would be thinking about every possibility as to why they're heading out there. Yet guilt started to creep in, and Steve decided to put him at ease.
"Same thing, I guess." He mumbled.
"Please, we need to use a cell-phone. It's urgent!" Steve pleaded.
"Captain, I don't say this much, but if it wasn't for your guidance today, we would've been toast today. So Thank You." Tony swallowed the rest of his drink, before he gave Steve a comforting rub on the back.
And that someone was Tony Stark. They needed Tony to know. And maybe... just maybe... he would grow past his resentment, mostly towards Steve, and help them. Yet it also would catch Hydra off guard.
Half an hour had passed and Steve was beginning to feel antsy. So much so, that he was beginning to seem uncomfortable by just standing there. He looked to Tony, who seemed just as impatient.
The super-soldier immediately glanced at his hands and could see them tied together as well. It was wrapped with seriously weak rope. So as if it was paper, the rope broke, and the soldier headed to his friend.
Steve hurriedly looked to the time. They were way past late.
Everything happened so quickly that she simply waited for the energy blast to knock her on her feet. Killing her, or at least badly injuring her. Yet it didn't.
“Yeah, there were other ways. But to me, it seems like this one worked. Just, next time-there better not be a next time. We try something a little less messy.” Pepper slightly implored.
As she squeezed through, Kamala could see a chary Captain Rogers, standing alone by the eggnog station (courtesy of some Shield agent's dream to become a cook). So, in a bit of desperation for a familiar face, she made her way over.
"Tony it's okay. Please don't..." Steve stated, before turning around to find a confused, and a bit heated, Tony.
Steve replies with a soft no. He holds his face in his hands, utterly exhausted from the day's events. For the first time, Tony actually felt an inch of pity for someone other than himself. 'God, this is weird?' He thought. That little part of compassion he had for him kicked in.
"Well if it isn't Mr. Rogers from the neighborhood!" Tony quipped, while also giving Steve a long overdue hug.
But all the other times, it seemed as if he was standoff-ish. Pepper usually thought it was because, of Morgan. And that Tony would try and spend almost every waking minute with his daughter. Making it his new life mission to give the girl, the life he never had.
She laughed softly. To which, Tony took this time to view her apparel, only getting a glimpse of it earlier. Not to be judgmental or anything like that. Mostly, to see what Natasha whipped up in such a short time.
Who, was currently making some of her famous stew. Adding some more spices to it, she took one of the paprika's, and softly sprinkled it along her masterpiece.
Tony felt his heart ping in slight pain. He grabbed his chest in response, yet his eyes stayed glued to the pictures. After standing there, baffled, he brought his gaze to his friend. Happy took his expression to try and explain himself, and the board.
Steve felt his smile crash off his face, before continuing into the conversation. "I just wanted you to know Pepper. That, what we did... is ONLY going to be a one-time thing. I promise you. I only wanted to, so that it could, in some way, help Tony." He assured her.
The parents themselves were deep in their dreams. Having been up the night prior with the children playing hide and seek. With one of the kids, the daughter, trying to hide near the dock by the river.
Natasha Romanoff was a very understanding person. Throughout her life she's been very considerate of peoples lives and their deepest thoughts. It doesn't mean she wasn't a saint toward their feelings.
The room itself, seemed to regenerate from the decimated, dirty, area into a clean, divine looking, place. But what the nostalgic Captain found interesting about this memory was that it was around the holidays. So the room was slightly decked out in some Christmas tinsel, and some red candles burned along the table.
Something about this morning, felt so strange, yet satisfying. He eventually sat up and pulled his legs over the side of the bed. As he began to rub his eyes, while also letting a yawn out, he tried to stand up.
“Nat told me what happened between you two. Back then, I mean.” Sam stated.
"It's big," Tony announced, as he and Steve were now standing by the front porch.
His feet scurried to the kitchen to grab the napkins, then back to the front door. Pepper thanked him and wiped Morgan's mouth. She finally cracked a genuine smile. And then took her gaze back to the lake.
Back then, in the days of 'The Avengers'. The cameras, the paparazzi, the fans, everything about his ‘old life’ never made it boring or repetitive. He missed being the talk of the town, for better or worse.
Nonetheless, she continued with the festivities. Even if it felt a little inappropriate considering the times. But how could one night with this much festive energy be so bad? And festive it was.
Hope your doing well! And don’t forget to leave a kudos, and some comments! ✌️🏻❤️
"Please, for the love of god, say something so I know your not mentally wanting to kill me!" Tony persisted.
"Romanov, does it look like I care about his damn love life. In fact, I believe it was the same issue with his 'love life' that almost made his relationship flop in the first place." Fury stated.
Finally, after a minute of desperately fighting Tony off, they connected forcefully. Steve stopped completely once it occurred. He could feel Tony's heartbeat and his breathing start to slow, as their kiss morphed.
Smile like a school kid getting his first kiss at a dance. But his feelings were short lived. As he had realized, that he just kissed another woman's boyfriend, behind her back, after she just confided in him to help the poor sob.
"Today, but I want you to not worry, or try to help. We both know what could happen, and I want you to only let me worry about that. Do you understand me?" She demanded.
"Which way are we going, Cap?" Natasha whispered.
"You were supposed to ask me to dance! And I was trying to get you to ask me without noticing!" Tony laughed.
"What? Did I get toilet paper stuck to my shoe?" Tony questioned, while immediately looking to his foot. No toilet paper. He looked back up to the two, confused. "What is it?".
Tony looked into the soldier's pleading eyes. Steve wanted this house. And Tony knew how exhausted the super-soldier's been from the last few days. Why not take a chance on it?
Outside, the lights of New York's businesses glimmered onto the windows. Giving off an almost dream like scenario to their situation. Hundreds of people in crowds were, laughing, walking, or having just a swell time. It honestly pisses Clint off a bit, as that is what they could be doing right now. Instead they are driving along the streets of Manhattan, searching for two sexually confused as-swipes.
She smiled at his lame response, but didn't realize the man's hands were still free. He grabbed her and tossed her over the rail.
The duo smiled and laughed in response. Then came the jokes. “Did you see the guy’s face though. He was like, ‘Hey get back here! You assholes!’” Sam stated with the guy’s thick London accent.
'It's okay, go live your life, Old Man." The apparition smiled and gave a wave. Before his body faded into the air.
The only time that ever Tony ever felt comfortable with her, was the more private moments they had. When they would snuggle, when they would joke around-act like a bunch of goofballs, and of course when they had sex.
"Really... I didn't think sticking your tongue down someone's throat is a good way to get someone out of their funk." Nat added, now with her mischievous smirk, "I wonder what would happen if I tried that on Bruce?".
Pepper would ask how they’ve been. And Natasha would always respond with ‘Could be better.’. The blonde really wishes she could ignore that part. Feeling that in some way it’s due to her and Tony’s non-involvement, in helping others with the snap.
"Okay, no need to go down memory lane." The philanthropist quickly threw out, "Let's continue... this.".
Even something simple as turning down a house property was bringing back painful memories that he thought he'd move on from.
He pointed into the kitchen, and from where Steve could see; the coffee machine sat alone on the counter, amongst nothing else in the vicinity of it.
(See the end of the chapter for
The day. 'The' day is almost here. The day, that forever changed their lives, and everyone else's. That godawful, horrible, day that Thanos arrived, and completely broke the Avengers.
“Steve?” He asked.
“No, it’s not great news. But it’s not bad either.” She asserted with a devious smirk, “And Rogers I thought that I was the only smartass around here.”
Which the trio did look into, once they discovered this market a month ago. It made them feel good, that most people still believed in them. But it sent Steve down a mad spiral in nostalgia, to Siberia. And boy did it make his spine shiver in remembrance. But today, long after those events, everything seemed fine. But the Ex-Avengers knew that looks can be deceiving.
His hair was his natural 'slick to the side' look, and he was wearing a Stark watch on his left wrist. That should've been the hint, to everyone, that Tony most likely helped him. Finally, his scruffy chin and jaw, showed he hadn't time to shave. It didn't matter though, as he still looked dashing, to say the least.
"What were you two chatting about?" He asked exaggerated.
Steve suddenly realized he was speeding even faster than before. Jumping from 50 mph to 75 mph. So he tried to slow down quickly. "I need to be alive for this, Rogers!".
"Steve, do you mind to head inside and grab some napkins. It seems someone had forgotten the etiquette of eating when company's around." Pepper asked.
Because amongst the chaos came the self-loathing stages as well. Steve sometimes felt that he should've been more involved in those situations instead of just sitting here and doing nothing at all. Letting his friends deal with these issues head-on, felt selfish of him.
Steve moved his feet to the downstairs bathroom and threw some water in his hair. Which had now grown back to the hairstyle he'd had, when on the run from Ross.
The war table was suddenly being lowered into the floor. Ultimately being covered by said metal flooring, and now leaving an area for the dancers. Kamala didn't have to look too long when she noticed Tony pulling Steve to the center. The soldier looked nervous as hell. But Tony was smiling ear to ear.
Kamala pointed to the trio. Bruce and Kate still in conversation, with Tony now looking their way. "Cap. Come on, what's the big deal? Why are you so scared to talk to them?"
Now because Steve didn’t have many things to begin with. The only rooms that were filled with decor & furniture were the main living room (Sam & Bucky gathered up some savings to get Steve a few green velvet sofas.), dining area (Tony bought Steve an American federal, mahogany dining table, and a porter dining server, also mahogany.), kitchen, and the upstairs, master bedroom & bath. The rest of the boxes were just stacked along the main & back hallway.
“Hey man! I wasn’t the one asking the questions?!” Sam wailed, while still trying to hold his laughs back.
Truthfully, Steve didn't even blame her. Ziggy didn't have the greatest life and probably looked to the Avengers as a way to escape. And just when her family was torn apart and she was alone. Here comes the leader of the Avengers, the great, retired, Captain America, to make it better.
Things like this only happen in fantasy. Children stories, to where the heroes usually win in the end. And the Avengers always prevailed against their misfortunes. But this was one of the children stories that had a miswritten ending.
Annie stomped off, the doll clutched to her chest. Tina raced behind her and proceeded to wrap her arms around Annie. Grabbing the doll from her locks of hair.
Obviously, Tony wouldn't go through with what Steve was asking him to do. He's one married, two has a daughter, and three, has a decent life. Why would he jeopardize that?! Even if it was for a fantasy that he'd never live.
Even more interesting, each room along this side of the house, had a different exit to the front foyer, and the main & back hallway. The living room had a Pseudo, Three-Centered, Archway. While the dining area just had another doorway. The kitchen seemingly having an amalgamation of both, with the area surrounding the doorframe filled with sidelights as well.
Tony felt his hand graze the burner phone in his pocket, not realizing that his hand went there in the first place. And as he pulled it out, he kept his eyes upon the device, and grazed his thumb across the side slit. Wanting to hear and see, the top shoot up, and the screen brighten his face.
"You and Kamala are either cleverly observant. Or I'm just horrible at being discreet." The soldier smiled.
"Whoa! Watch the language, Cap!" Tony guffawed.
"So then, what's the full truth then?"
"Cap?" Tony asked.
Steve snorts, while Tony looks back with a mischievous grin. "Of course, with me in the front." Tony teased.
Once it was all 'said and done', she felt the anger leave her. Letting the remorse, and pity for the man follow. I mean, she knew of another reason why he wouldn't want to help. But for keeping a relationship that was already rocky, to begin with, just astounded the Russian.
"Mr. Rogers over here, has been beating himself up since we left. He had literally been chewing himself out, because we went there to help. And I for one, never want to see that again." He relinquished, as he sat a hand on Steve's upper arm. The two began their gazing once more. Pepper had now noticed it. She swallowed, giving a slightly confused look.
He thought humorously.
With Bucky & Sam taking the room next to Steve. Bruce took the one on the front-right side. That room had 2 beds with one in good condition, the other not so much. But Bruce wasn't testing his weight on that flimsy metal frame that sat beneath the sturdy mattress.
"No. Your spot on, though.” His head turned back to the crowd.
Happy stood beside him for a while, before leaving the room, letting Tony with his thoughts. As he closed the door, he felt defeated that his calming voice didn’t get him to leave with him. But it’s Tony Stark. Happy knew that a few calming words weren’t really going to do much, besides for a half-assed decline.
Steve stomped over to the living area, where the two were grabbing over each other. Annie smacking Tina's hands away, as Annie held onto the doll tightly, while Tina reached for it.
Pulling the pictures, and shredded number out of his pocket, but leaving the burner phone there. The philanthropist looked back to the water. Piece by piece he threw the shredded paper into the water. Then Sam, and Natasha’s pictures followed.
But for Steve, it was honestly so much more. He wanted Tony to know that he forgave him. That he forgave him, for not forgiving himself.
"Hey kid, you don't have to be nervous. Just talk to me as if I'm a regular old
Suddenly, as Steve looked back to Tony, something about being this close to Tony was giving the super-soldier straight deja-vu. The realization of why he's been feeling the way he has, hitting him, as Tony kept his gaze on Steve. Except instead of seeing the empathetic look of a friend, he was being reminded of the betrayed, heartbreaking look that Tony gave him in Siberia. God, he was never going to get over this.
Steve once again smiled, relieved at the fact that he was getting to see some friends again. Two years, to most of the Avengers felt quick, compared to Cap. To him, it felt like 10. Even after his own personal drama, he was pleased that at least he was getting the calm before the storm.
Tony knew where they were, but now, no one else knew. And they weren’t going to know. The location of Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanov, and Sam Wilson, were now only known by Tony Stark. And that was something he cherished between him and his ex-friends.
He continually smiled, boyishly, and retreated to his work. Humming a church hymn his 'Ma use to sing to him.
"Nah," Steve concluded. Before cupping the brunet's face and kissing him once more.
“Oh wow. This is gorgeous.” Steve expressed.
The eerie glow that illuminated the room, flickered continuously in resistance. Both men now were having a hard time to see around, due to this nauseating light.
Tony pulled Steve's lips back onto his. Morphing the situation into something more intense. His actions suddenly seemed futile as Steve pulled away from him. Letting go of Tony, yet still holding a grin on his face.
And with that, Peter was back to his insisting questions of what the next mission holds. Sure the assignment in Germany was cool, but he’s was ready for something more drastic. Typical teenagers am I right?
There was Ziggy, Jenny, and Tommy all huddled over another person. Steve ushered between them. It was
He was home, of course. Asleep in his bedroom.
But apparently, he'd been obvious from the start. So he might as well come clean about it. "The truth?" Tony stuttered.
Steve took some deep breaths as he crossed the parking lot of the, rather packed, diner. His palms were sweaty, his walking was sluggish, and he could feel himself panicked. Why you may ask? Well, it's pretty straightforward. He was nervous as hell. Nervous about many things, but the reunion was the major culprit. He hadn't seen his Avenger colleagues, except Nat, in years. And a lot has changed in his life.
"Is really everything a joke to you?" Steve said, a bit more sternly.
The super-soldier looked to his teammates, then to Tony. He continued his story.
It was midnight, on a Sunday morning. Steve had come to the apartment and the first thing he did was take a shower. He dressed in some casual clothes and ate microwaved Mac and Cheese. Reflecting on that day's events.
"Well, dammit." Tony looked to his milkshake and swirled it a bit with an ever so slight movement of his spoon. Besides the conversations surrounding them, the two just sat quiet.
"I'm psychic." Kamala giggled along with him.
The man's face grew red, and she unwrapped her legs from his throat, before getting a few good punches into him as well. She got him on his knees and held onto his collar with vengeance.
Tony looked at him and noticed his expression. "May we see upstairs real quick." He asked swiftly.
He gently brought his eyes back to the war table beneath them, clearing his throat in the process, while also catching the soldier's attention. Tony was never really great at being discrete.
And as he stood near Steve, patriotic as usual, arms crossed along the star of his suit. His feet perfectly parallel to one another, and his face doing the regular scowling expression. Tony could read Steve like a book. Something was bothering him as well. Better yet, someone.
And again, in his photo he was staring at the camera. But with an added finger in the shot. It really surprised Tony that they just knew where these people were, and still let them take the picture.
And yet, once he finished, Steve looked to him with pain and sorrow. God, how he hated that look. He hated to be pitied.
Once his clothes were off; leaving on his underwear for obvious reasons. The super-soldier got into bed and pulled a book out from his nightstand.
That smile is going to be a heartbreaker.
Tony raised his hand in approval while laughing off her question.
"Yet, Fury your missing one thing." Tony interjected.
"And right there, she'd stop. So I would then begin to complain about why she always stopped right there. She'd never answer me. All I ever got in return was her smile. And that's it." Steve once again did a one-over. There were some newer expressions this time.
They all didn't say anything, indicating that they don't. Tony was more surprised that Nat and Clint didn't. I mean they do work there. Before anymore updates on their situation occurred, a helicopter was near and beginning to land. "Never mind, I guess he just knew." He said softly. The team climbed into their safe haven and flew off.
"You girls aren't going outside until you spill it." Steve crossed his arms whilst leaning on the counter behind him.
She walked back into the house and looked once again into the kitchen. The entire countertop was cleaned, and any of the leftover dishes in the sink were, you guessed it, cleaned, and put up.
