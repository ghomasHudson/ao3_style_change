"Then take off your pants, Detective."
Sherlock didn't know what to say. John had told him once that if he were too scared to be the one to...what's a good word?...catch?....that he would go first but Sherlock had never been able to envision John spreading his legs or bending over for him. The man had spent the last two years emphatically telling everyone within shouting range that he was "NOT GAY!" Naturally in the last few weeks he had assumed John would stop shouting that out at regular intervals, he assumed John would condescend to bending Sherlock over some surface or another, but he did not think this could ever be something he'd want, to take Sherlock inside himself.
John picked up the bottle of lube and applied it once more to his fingers. "Do you want to watch?" Sherlock shook his head and a muffled "Not just yet." came from beneath the pillow. Good. He wasnt entirely certain what he should do next and he didn't need curious eyes observing his process. He laid down on his belly between Sherlock's legs, spread one glorious looking cheek to the side, once again took his cock in his mouth, and as he pressed down, he gently began to rub his finger against Sherlock's rim. "Oh, oh, God, John. Oh, God." He heard from under the pillow. He made a humming noise in the back of his throat, where the head of Sherlock's cock was just nudging his soft palate. He lifted up, swirled his tongue over the head, and as he went down again he pressed his middle finger inside. God it was tight. Tighter than he'd expected.
John was a little surprised. Well, he thought he was surprised to find Sherlock watching porn but it made sense once he got past the idea that it was Sherlock watching porn. He had felt pretty horny this morning himself. Only natural. But if he wasn't wanking, what was he doing? "Disgusting? They were just giving eachother blowjobs. And why were you watching it if it disgusts you?" And if this thing between us goes somewhere will you refuse to give me one because I rather like that, is what he didn't say. Sherlock sighed and looked at the ground. "Sherlock?" "I don't think this up for discussion, John. I'm sorry I dropped your computer, I'll pay for the repairs." And he sulked off to his bedroom leaving John holding a still burning cigarette and a computer probably riddled with porn viruses.
From the very moment he tore that bomb off John, from the very moment he felt that wave of relief wash over him, Sherlock knew something had changed. Sherlock had never much cared for people. In fact, he never cared for people for at all.  All Sherlock cared about was his work. Oh, John liked to think he saw some humanity in Sherlock.  Liked to think Sherlock cared for the people whose lives he saved.  But that wasn't about saving lives, it was about the Game.  But when John stepped out onto that pool deck and revealed the bomb Moriarty had strapped to his chest, concern hit Sherlock like a brick wall. He could have killed Moriarty thirty different ways, he would have. But John's certain death made him hesitate, and that hesitation allowed Moriarty to escape. Why? Why did Sherlock care whether John Watson lived or died?
Sherlock sat his violin down and resigned himself to pacing a bit around the flat. He needed a distraction, needed a case. When John emerged a few moments later, wearing only sweatpants and obviously nothing else, Sherlock pounced. "You've just masturbated in the shower." John flinched and looked at Sherlock as if he'd just announced he shot heroin again. "Your cheeks are flushed." "It was a very hot shower." "Your penis is still semi erect I can tell because you're not wearing pants. Your heart rate is elevated as is your breath rate. The tension is gone from your shoulders, you aren't standing up straight anymore which means your legs have gone a bit 'jelly' and your mouth isn't set as it was when you arrived home." "Maybe I just had a nice shower." "A very nice shower." "Sherlock..." John was going to tell Sherlock how rude it was to call someone out for masturbating but, frankly, was tired of arguing with him. He had had a nice shower and it had helped clear his mind a bit in regards to that whole dating a man thing he was trying to get used to. So he said instead, "Let's try to have a nice night, hmm? I'll get some curry and a few beers and maybe we could watch a movie together?" Sherlock wasn't quite sure how to respond. On one hand, he wanted to spend some time with John, on the other, he really wanted a cigarette and thought he could nag John until he relented but then John would be angry and would go sulk in his room like he had been for days. "Okay. But no curry. Fish and chips." "Deal."
This is when he realized his Sherlock was a definite Back Archer. With a hiss, he planted his feet on the bed and bent like a bow. His cock moved a bit quickly down John's throat, but he was able to pull off before he gagged. "Alright?" he asked his magnificent lover. Sherlock came back down to the bed and nodded, still under that damn pillow, which John noticed he seemed to be biting. He twisted his finger. Sherlock was definitely biting the pillow now. He pulled his finger out and Sherlock whined. "Patience! I don't want to hurt you. And since you're supposed to be learning, I don't want you to hurt me when it's your turn." At this Sherlock finally removed the pillow from his face and looked at him.
They ate in silence, both lost in their thoughts and apprehension about what may be coming when they were finished. Every now and then Sherlock would look around at the candles and then to John like he was waiting for an explanation, but John didn't think explanation was necessary. And if it were, he'd get one soon enough. When they finished, John silently took the plates to the kitchen and went to brush his teeth. Sherlock followed him into the bathroom, apparently to do the same. John smiled at the thought. They were brushing their teeth together. How domestic. Once they were both in the living area together again, the whole thing came to a stand still.
Please comment, I feed off positive reinforcement or constructive criticism, either one.
Sherlock sat in his apartment at 221B Baker Street, cigarette burning in his hand, staring at John's empty chair. John was out doing the shopping, which he always did when Sherlock was like this: sitting there, staring at nothing, thinking.  Sherlock had been doing that a lot lately. John assumed that Sherlock was considering Moriarty. Considering how to get the epitome of evil genius back into their grasp. He had no idea that in fact, he was the subject of Sherlock's obsession. That these new and horrible feelings of concern over someone's safety, his safety, were driving the genius mad. No. This was no good. Think, Sherlock, think! Why is John's saferty so important all of a sudden?
They began to rut in earnest this time, finding their rhythm as John slipped his middle finger back inside. He pumped his finger in and out of Sherlock's tight hole as he swallowed every moan, every whimper. When he felt ready, he slipped in a second. Sherlock grabbed John by his own ass at this and began to hump furiously against John's cock. John felt like his blood was boiling. He was so hot and sweaty, he couldn't breathe, his head was pounding and everything seemed to focus down to this one point in time, this moment where Sherlock had lost his wits and his fingers were buried deep in his ass and they were both about to cum on eachother.
Throughout all of this, John did not blink, did not move a muscle. And when he opened his mouth to speak, he realized he was holding his breath.  After letting it out in a huge whoosh, he opened his mouth again. And shut it. And opened it. And shut it again. Finally he said "I think....I think, Sherlock, that you may like me." Sherlock looked at him as though realizing again that John was stupid.  "Obviously, I like you, John. You are my friend, you are my flatmate. I wouldn't live with someone I did not like.". "No, Sherlock, I meant....I think, maybe, you're keen on me." Sherlock still looked confused so John gave him one, then another very pointed look.  Suddenly, Sherlock realized what John was saying. His eyes widened but he did not say a word. He mentally went through every piece of information he had ever gathered regarding love, lust and 'liking' someone. How on earth had that happened? And how had it slipped by him? And why, dear God, why had he just laid it all out for John Watson to piece together?
As Sherlock fiddled with the lock at 221B and damn near fell through the door, John came running to help. "Jesus, Sherlock, are you drunk?"
John sat up, suddenly acutely aware of their surroundings again. He was nervous again. Silly, he thought. This is what we both want. "Are you sure? We can stay right here and just do this forever if you want." "I do not want that. I want you." That was all he needed to hear. He stood up and helped Sherlock to his feet, kissing him again and running his hands across the wide expanse of back muscles he could finally reach. He stood on his tiptoes and kissed Sherlock, long and sweet, and said "Then lead the way."
The two of them went into the living room and sat next to eachother on the couch. John turned to face Sherlock and Sherlock stared at the wall. "Sherlock, listen to me. I went to see my therapist today because I didn't know how to handle this thing that has suddenly been thrust between you and I. Am I hesitant? Yes. But not just because you're a man, although it is a factor. It's because it's you. You're my best friend. We live together, we work together. There is a lot at stake here. And I am frightened. I'm frightened by the idea of one of us or both of us getting hurt. I'm frightened that these feelings of yours may be a fleeting experiment. And I'm frightened by the idea of sex with you. Which leads me to my next point. There is no cause for talk of sex. Not yet. And you don't need to be watching porn to find out what is expected of you. That will all come with time. If we are to do this, I want it to go in the normal way. We see where it goes. We take it one step at a time. I know we have known eachother for a while but we need to get to know eachother in a new way. And that will take time. We will have sex if and when we are ever ready to. And I don't know how it will go. But I do know that while this is a somewhat new concept to me, it is entirely new to you. And I need to know now: is it something you even want to consider? Or does it freak you out too much and you would rather move on now?"
"Sherlock. Tell me something personal about you." Sherlock froze again. Something personal? He didn't think he had anything very personal to tell and what few facts there were, John already knew. "Tell me about your childhood," John said, knowing Sherlock didn't even know what personal meant, especially since he tended to air people's personals regularly. "My childhood was dull." "Tell me about it. Tell me about your parents." "Why?" "Because, Sherlock, this is what people do. They tell eachother things."  "Okay. My mother was a mathemetician before Mycroft was born she was nothing but a mother after that and my father was her devoted slave with no spine." Your mother was a mathemetician?" I just said that." "Well that explains a lot. But you said she became nothing but a mother. So...you didn't go off to school?" "No." "Really?" "Why does that surprise you?" "I just figured you and Mycroft for the type to have gone off to school." "Well, we did go to prep, but we didn't board." "Were you and your mother close?" Sherlock looked down at John. He should know the answer to that. "I am not close to anyone, John." "You're close to me."
Sherlock wasn't quite sure he'd ever get used to John saying things like that, not to him, but he wasn't about to let it go to waste. He leaned down and gently pressed his lips against John's. John opened his mouth and sighed and Sherlock took the opportunity caress John's tongue with his own and John groaned, leaning up into the kiss. Sherlock pushed John back down with his mouth and held him there, rubbing his hands over Johns stomach and snogging him until John felt like he couldn't breathe. John liftd his hand and pushed Sherlock back. When the kiss broke, he sat up and took a deep breath, trying to catch his breath. His cheeks were flushed and his hair was mussed and he felt absolutely like his whole body had turned to jello. How can a man who has never done this before be so good at it? John leaned over and grabbed hold of Sherlock's face, staring into his sky blue eyes. "Are we really doing this, you and I?" "We're really snogging, if thats is what you mean. Really, John, you are very obvious, sometimes." John smiled at that. "Not what I meant, Sherlock. I meant this...relationship. Is this really happening?" "Clearly. Now do that thing with my bottom lip."
Sherlock was really glad that conversation was over. It wasn't like he hadn't started contemplating sex with John, and he wasn't ignorant. He knew a lot about the subject. He knew a lot about a lot of things. But talking about it this way, with John, in a not so hypothetical manner, was a bit more than he was ready for. Snogging, though, he liked that. He never thought he would but when John pulled his lip into his mouth, his whole body tingled. It reminded him of...no. Probably shouldn't think about that. It would make him want it and that would make John furious. No, much better to settle for kissing John.
The needle shook a bit on the way into his arm, leaving a slight bruise. He would have to remember to come up with a story for that later. For now, he was reveling in the feeling of heroin coarsing through his veins. More importantly, in the feeling of it coating his brain. For the first time in 32 days, Sherlock could focus on important matters, not John Wats-his-name. Like, the way his feet felt funny when they hit the pavement. Or the way home seemed much further away than he remembered. Or how nice John's hair looked in the mornings. No. That wasn't right, was it? Damn!
This should have been 2 chapters but I just couldn't stop writing long enough to post. I really hope you enjoy and as always, please leave me your thoughts!
If Sherlock had known that sex could do this, he'd have gladly given over to those thoughts that such a short time ago seemed insane. He never would have gone out for heroin, he'd have had John every which way to Sunday instead. Well, he knows now. He'll never need another drug again.
John was a wanton mess by now. He lay beneath Sherlock trembling and whimpering and rocking his hips and clutching Sherlock's arm with one hand and his back with another. Finally, he moved his hand down, grabbed Sherlock firmly by the ass and said with gritted teeth "Fuck me."
Sherlock looked at him once more to be sure he knew what he was saying, that he wasn't still in some dream state. It felt a bit silly, to be concerned that John might still want to turn back after they've come this far, but Sherlock couldn't help but think, If he takes it in the ass tonight, he won't be able to stand on solid ground in front of  Donovan, LeStrade and Anderson tomorrow. "There's no going back after this, you know," he said out loud. John moved to sit up and Sherlock let him. "You think I would want to go back now?" Sherlock only looked at him. Maybe it was time to talk about this? Probably not, as he could feel his erection waning, and he so badly wanted to cum again. "I suppose not," he said, and John let it go, but looked at him suspiciously for a second first.
When he got home, he could hear the violin. As soon as the third step creaked, though, the music stopped. "He's waiting for me," he thought with some mild satisfaction. He walked into the flat and immediately wrinkled his nose. "Jesus, Sherlock! Have you gone and smoked the whole pack? You could have at least opened a window! Mrs. Hudson is going to kill you!" "Hudders won't even know, she's taken up with that butcher again. Won't be home for a few days." John set the bag of food on the table and turned to his....oh. is Sherlock his boyfriend now? No, thoughts like that would have to wait until later. He wanted to throttle Sherlock right now. Throttle him or snog him? Well, he wasn't going to snog him when he was sure his mouth tasted like an ashtray. But he would settle for a quick kiss, which he gave, only after opening TWO windows.
"So...what brings you here today, John?" "Short version? Yesterday I found out my best friend is on heroin again and that I am the reason why. I am the reason why because he is keen on me and wasn't actually aware of it until he spelled it out for me and then I spelled it out for him. I also realized that I am quite keen on him and we snogged last night and it scares me and I know it scares him. And I think he may want to have sex because I caught him watching gay porn but he said it disgusts him so maybe he doesn't and both those ideas scare me, too." John sat back and took a deep breath while his therapist calmly took all of that in. "So, what you're telling me is that you've discovered an interest in Sherlock and it frightens you because he's a man?" "Yes." "Why?" "Because I'm straight." "John, it isn't about gay or straight. You don't have to tape a label on yourself and stay true to it every day of your life. Sherlock is your best friend. You care for him. He cares for you. Your life has been better, you have been better, since you met him. He gives you a sense of purpose again. He takes you on adventures, keeps you on your toes in a way you have missed since leaving the Army. He makes you laugh. He makes you want to learn more about him. It is only natural that feelings would develop. And if they aren't completely plutonic feelings? Then that is natural, too. People become attracted to people and it doesn't always make sense. A tall man may fall in love with a dwarf. A correctional officer may fall in love with her prisoner. A man may fall in love with his sociopath of a flatmate. Who is also a man. These things happen. If he loves you back, and you can see a future in it, I urge you to give it a shot."
Uniforms
"There were more then just Mycroft's bugs in here." I stated the obvious.
The Watson's
"There is a client upstairs waiting for you deary" Mrs Hudson called to us as we climbed the stairs up to the flat.
The Major led the pair threw the hanger into what looked like a row of offices, opening what seemed like a random door and gesturing for them to enter. She pulled what looked like a nicotine patch off her own back and slid it into a sharps bin on her desk. "Forgive me, I'm not used to telling the truth. So I'll try and tell you what you need to know. The patches do hide your natural scent. What does the good doctor smell like to you now?" Sherlock turned to John expecting his tea, musky and Alpha scent but instead the familiar scent was now unmistakable Beta. "That's right, the patches can change your scent to whatever you want it to be. It's still in testing, it's expensive and extremely dangerous. They need to be made tailored to each individual. I don't even know who makes them, they rock up labeled for us. I had Dr Watson's made especially for this visit and as a Beta patch you are not in danger Dr Watson." Sherlock watched the Major looking for any suggestions of lies, he didn't find any so far. "One of my team has been taken with all her patches, in the wrong hands the patches can be deadly. They can force Heats and Ruts to the point of death unless the effected Bonds which will then stabilise them." John rubbed his hand over his face. "So these patches can make it so people have to Bond or die? Why the bloody hell where they made in the first place?" John huffed. "They have been our only choice, my team, all damaged Omega's. We would have been killed at presenting if these patches and this program didn't exist." Sherlock looked back at the Major, "Tell me everything about the one missing." The Major pulled a file out of her locked desk. "Aurora, our scout." The Major handed her file to Sherlock. "Her quarters?" Sherlock asked. "I'll show you." The Major led the pair to the other side of the hanger away from the offices. A faint scent of an Omega in heat lingered in the hallway. "Jasmine is the only one home at the moment." The Major mumbled as they past the door that held the Omega. At the end of the hall the Major pushed open a door allowing both men to see inside. The room itself was quite basic, bed, desk, build-in wardrobe and another door ajar enough to see it was a bathroom. The surprising part was the room was almost head to toe in pink, purple and glitter. There was jewellery, ball gowns, make up and glittery heels spread across the room. It was like walking into a princesses room, only the size of a military room. Of course there was a trunk with weapons and military gear sitting at the end of the bed. "What rank is she?" Sherlock asked recovering first. "Corporal" the Major answered. "How old is she?" John stammered. "22" the Major answered. John just stared as Sherlock started to look through the room. "John, John!" Sherlock yelled at him. "What!" John finally answered still confused with what he was looking at. "Your military, do you see anything unusual?" Sherlock asked. "Yeah, everything!" John snapped back. Sherlock swirled back to face him. "You see but you do not observe. The victim is a scout, these are all covers. She doesn't scout out sand bunkers and compounds. She scouts out at charity events, movie premieres, the rich and powerful." John let his own mental expectations of a military scout and corporal go to the side and looked around the room again. The owner of this room had thrown a tantrum, something similar to his sisters post party drunken tantrum as a teenager. Matching heels thrown to one side, as well as a matching purse. A matching ball gown had been dumped on the floor with a set of under clothes. The bathroom bench a mess of bobby pins and used make up wipes. Looking at the draws pulled open she had grabbed a shirt and jeans having left the drawers half open and some of the contents dumped on the floor. "She was angry when she left." John replied. Sherlock gave him a quick smirk. "Very good John, in fact your corporal was livid and has run away. She has taken a bag she had already prepared and weapons. I need to know what mission she was working that would have pissed her off so much." The Major looked stunned. "Aurora wouldn't run away, sure she is the biggest drama queen but she has no where else to go. She loves her life here, we are her family. We give her everything she wants." The Major tailed off. "The mission Major?" Sherlock demanded.
Trains
"Man whore." Watson chuckled to himself before a loud crash echoed through the corridor. "Shit." Watson swore as he headed towards the sound and ripped the door open. In the far corner Major Franks sat one hand holding a gun with a silencer at Murry's head the other clutching her thigh with a knife stuck in it. Medical equipment scattered across the room where it had been thrown at Murry and the light scent of an Omega hours away from heat. "Murry." Watson cooed gently, Murry was still focused on the Omega. Watson moved carefully as not to seem like a contesting Alpha. "Hey Murry." Finally he looked towards Watson. "Food and water for the Omega yeah." Watson suggested, Murry blinked a couple of times as it registered as a good idea in his Alpha brain.
Sherlock POV
"That's ok, I'll go a coffee." She smiles at John as he raises a questioning eyebrow, they both know now she's lying. As soon as John pulls the plug of the kettle from the wall she races to the centre of the room pulling a remote from her pocket and pressing the button. Little pops echo threw out the room, even the microwave makes an unpleasant noise.
John POV
I stepped into the comforting warmth of Baker st after a long and cold shift at the clinic. It was quiet, too quiet. "Sherlock?" I called out. "John your home about time, I need help to clear my mind!" He huffed from his perch on top of a set of draws with a riding crop in his hands. "You have to put your old uniform back on." He basically demanded. "What! What for?!" I replied almost missing the hook for my coat. "Experiment, Your military uniform now!" He insisted. "ok..." I nervously replied. I was at the point now with him I figure I just go along with it but a nagging thought in the back of my mind crept up. What if it doesnt fit anymore and I look stupid. "Your waist measurement hasnt changed." Sherlock murmured. "No I'm not a mind reader." He added. How he did that was beyond me so I headed to my room kicking my shoes off at the same time. Sherlock followed me and lent on my doorframe. "Are you gonna watch?" I asked nervously as I pulled my jumper off. He just nodded making my face burn red. So I pulled my shirt off and dropped it in the hamper as I headed to my closet. I pulled my trousers off realising I was going to have to use the closet door to hide the strange excitement developing knowing Sherlock was watching me. I had to look deep in my cupboard for my uniform, I hadnt worn it in ages but I pulled the trousers on making sure I moved my now hard on to one side to hide it before pulling on a green polo. Tucking it in and pulling the button up camouflage over my shoulders. Suddenly a riding crop landed gently on my chest. "Thats enough, now the boots." The smouldering look at the other end of the riding crop made me weak at the knees. His eyes had a burning desire swelling in them I dont think I was ever going to forget. I swallowed hard as I searched the bottom of my cupboard for my military boots. Admittedly I felt a little exposed on my hands and knees on the floor searching for my boots. I found them and pulled them on and laced them up while I was still on the floor. Sherlock watching me intently. I got up and straighten my uniform out of habit. "So Captain Watson!" Sherlock started to circle me inspecting my uniform. A chill of excitement run down my back as suddenly a whip to my arse made me jump and yelp. Sherlock had hit me hard with the riding crop. "What the..." Is all that came out of my mouth as Sherlock started to push me towards the bed. I fell on the bed bouncing on my sore arse a little as Sherlock tapped my knees apart with the riding crop and knelt taking up the space between my hitched knees. I swallowed hard in excitement as butterfly's took over my stomach, what the hell was he up too! He spread his long fingers across my chest as I lent back on my hands looking up at him. God he was gorgeous and the mischievous grin on his face was driving me crazy. "I've been doing some research." Sherlock nervously explained. "Your hypothesis?" I practically squeaked. "Uniform's do have a, sexy, quality to them." He replied looking me over. My face was burning even more then usual. "Is that a hypothesis or a observation?" I asked trying to get my voice to work. I was trying to be smart to impress him again, Sherlock bit his lower lip. Omg I had never seen him do that, I had to force myself to keep breathing. "I still have to achieve a result." Sherlock replied in his velvet voice, I thought I was just going to melt. He used the riding crop to open my button up shirt further as he moved his face closer to mine forcing me to look up into his eyes as his hand slid down my stomach. He ran a finger across my groin before grabbing my thigh, he crashed his lips to mine. He was getting really good at kissing. Suddenly he hit me again with the riding crop on my thigh, I almost bit his lower lip mid kiss. He slipped his knees under my thighs while grabbing my green shirt so he could access my chest. I tried touching him with one hand while I kept my self stable with the other but he slapped my hand with the riding crop. I withdrew my hand as he started to unbutton my trousers but he stopped. "John." He whispered. "Yeah Sherlock." I forced my voice to work. He sat back on his legs, I could see his brilliant mind working. "It's ok, just tell me what you want." I smiled at him encouragingly. "I, um, you know how I, in the kitchen, the other day." I grabbed the top of his trousers as I twisted around to get on my hands and knees, I opened his trousers to expose his manhood. I took him in my mouth just has he had done to me in the kitchen, just listening to him groan as I pleased him. It was so surreal I didn't even flinched when he climaxed in my mouth. He even grabbed my face and kissed me thanking me between kisses. Followed by him grabbing me and pulling me off while grabbing my arse. I was so close to climaxing already it didn't take long before I came in his hand. "I think my hypothesis is correct." Sherlock mused still looking deep into my eyes. I chuckled. As I lay completely satisfied, my head on Sherlock's chest a thought occurred to me. "Sherlock?" I asked. "Mmm" he answered "where did you get the riding crop from?" He shrugged. "Mycroft and I had riding lessons." I looked up at him, "I didn't know you could ride a horse." Sherlock huffed "My parents made us learn, it only lasted 3 days." He added. "Three days, how did you only manage three days?" I asked waiting for an interesting story. "I refused to use the riding crop on the horse." Sherlock replied. "But you used it on me!" I pointed out. "You didn't seem to mind." I could see Sherlock's lips twitch trying to stop from smiling. I couldn't argue with him however and let out a small chuckle as my phone chimed. I had to climb over Sherlock and grab it out of my discarded trousers. It was from Lestrade, Sean Green, from the murder we investigated, had been beaten badly and from Sherlock's information it looked like it was the same group that beat Sherlock. I took a deep breath, I looked up at Sherlock, it really hurt when I saw him all beaten up. My stomach decided this was the best time to grumble. "Hungry?" I asked Sherlock knowing full well he wasn't going to eat anyway. "We should eat." He replied running a finger down my stomach making me shiver slightly. Still pretty much in my uniform I headed to the kitchen. I opened the freezer to what looked like a human liver and decided to just close it. Instead I grabbed some bread threw it in the toaster and made some tea. Sherlock came swagging out to the kitchen wrapped in my bed sheet, I just shook my head and smiled at him as he took up his place at the table watching me. I put some toast in front of him with a tea and grabbed my own. Yeah never a dull moment around here I thought to myself.
The Holmes.
I had to admit I was pretty stunned, I mean this was Sherlock. Mr blocks-all-emotion but that, that was alot of emotion. Gees, how come me? I'm just a normal boreing person, what's so special about me? "John." Sherlock murmured "mmm" I replied. "Dont think like that. Your my John." I could just look up and see his face, his eyes where still shut and he looked peaceful. "I could feel your face contort into confusion." He answered my unspoken question. I couldn't help but smirk. His John, I liked that. Eventually Sherlock began to fidget, I didnt think it would take long, he isnt the one to stay still. "Tea?" I suggested. "Please" Sherlock nodded I tried not to laught, he said please. I untangled myself from his long arms and legs. "I better have a shower frist." I could feel the come drying in my pants. I headed off to the bathroom only to find Sherlock following me that look of curisity across his face I smirked and gestured he could join me if he liked. A flare of excitement flashed threw his eyes. It was certainly a diffrent experience having to lead Sherlock, normally I'm the one trying to keep up with him. I stepped into the shower frist followed by Sherlock, I grabbed the washer and washed the dried come off. Sherlock slid his arms around my waist and lent his head on my shoulder watching. It was exciting and nerve racking all at the same time. He slid his hands down my waist. He gently took me in his hands, I instantly became hard in his hands. I could feel him hardening into my back. I lent back into him nuzzling my face into his neck letting his curly hair cover my face. He spread his long fingers across my chest with one hand while gently stroking me with the other. He ran his hand gently down my length, he was so gentle and everywhere he touched me felt like electricity between us. I reached my hand into his curls grabbing a handful of his hair, I groaned as he pulled me closer to him. He started to move faster as he kissed and nibbled my neck, it was bliss been surrounded by him. "John." He whispered, I had to swallow hard to answer him yet all I could manage was a rough "mmm" he too took a nervous hard swallow. "Am I doing this right?" I dont know why but his voice turned me on even more then I thought possible. "Oh god yes, Sherlock your amazing!" I answered my voice so rough but I couldn't help it. He ran his thumb over the top of my head which made me pull his hair in pleasure and some weird noise echo from my throat. I felt Sherlock smile into my neck as he did it again. I grabbed his arm to keep me stable as he moved faster and faster I lost control and came all over his hand. If Sherlock wasn't holding me I was sure I would have ended up on the shower floor as my knees gave way. Instead he wrapped both his arms around me and pulled me tightly into him. This, this was perfect. I thought. I got my balance back and finished our shower. Sherlock had a silly smile plastered on his face and im pretty sure I did too.
"Shall I show you the flat?" Sherlock suggested. "Please." I smiled back. Sherlock showed me up to the flat looking back at me a couple of times. He silently showed me around the flat, it wasn't quite what I imagined. Paperwork and science equipment, just so much stuff! The kitchen had no food, the only thing that really resembled what it was suppose to be was a music stand with a violin beside it. Sherlock saw me looking at it. "Does the violin bother you?" Sherlock asked. "No I quite like it." I shrugged.
"Now your choice, you take my case and I can answer all your questions or you spend the rest of the case in a bunker in the middle of nowhere." She knew I had to know the truth.
"Petty Officer Ann Campbell" she smiled widely as she stepped forward and took John's hand in a handshake. She was easily able to slide her hand in his pocket to grab his phone but after holding it for a couple of seconds left it in his pocket without him noticing. Interesting. She then turned to me, shaking my hand and sliding her hand into my pocket to grab my phone. Staring into my eyes, she knew that I knew what she was doing as the weight of my phone fell back into my pocket and she stepped away.
John POV
Scotland Yard
"Give me the clicker and I accept the case." I answer immediately, she smiles and hands me the clicker.
The next day was a day shift at the clinic, it was a rubbish day, I was so pleased to be home and I collapsed on the couch thankfully the couch was long enough to lay across it fully without having to hang my feet over it like Sherlock does. I took a deep breath, I can't believe the victim was murdered for been gay. Lestrade had sent me a text to say the victim's brother, who has gone missing, is suspected of killing her because she was in a relationship with a guy while still been a guy. I know at school I and other guys got beaten up because they thought we were gay. But an adult murdered for been gay. Which brought a more recent matter back to my mind, Sherlock. How I felt about him. I mean he is my best friend but, I don't know his eyes and his cheekbones. They way he has a smile just for me. I heard Sherlock move around the flat. I know he was pleased he had solved the case but something else was moving about in his brilliant mind. Sure enough he picked up his violin and started to play. I closed my eyes, Sherlock, of all the people I could have a crush, a gay crush at that how did it end up been him. He had to have noticed, he notices everything. I was so deep in thought I hadn't noticed the violin had stopped and a warm breath spread across my face. I jumped ripping my eyes open to find Sherlocks staring back into mine. "Sh.. Sherlock, what are you doing?" I stammered as my face blushed a burning red and my voice trembled. "Experiment." He answered unsure. Wow Sherlock unsure, this was new. I swallowed hard, tried to think of something else but those damn eyes. Oh shit no, not again. I felt butterflies in my stomach followed by an on coming erection. Holy shit, I'm gay. I realised not sure what the hell to do. Suddenly Sherlock kissed me. It was quick, sudden and done before I could actually register what the hell just happened. Now he wasn't so close yet still curiously watching me for a reaction. I was stunned. "What was that for?" I asked trying desperately to comprehend what just happened. The curiosity disappeared from his eyes, he shrugged and got up wondering back to his violin. "Sherlock, what the hell!" I was suddenly so angry with him. He didn't answer as he picked up his violin and was about to start playing. I ripped the bow out of his hands. "Sherlock!" I demanded an answer. "Experiment." Sherlock answered not looking at me. So that's it, he saw the gay couple in the case and wanted to experiment. "I'm not an experiment!" I stormed at him throwing the bow across the room. I grabbed my coat and stormed out of the flat. He knew he was turning me on, I shouldn't have been so stupid, he doesn't feel. He has no idea. I stormed down the street, not really paying attention to were I was going. I was so angry with him, no I was hurt. I was in love with him and it hurt that he just thought of me as a experiment. I stopped in front of a building as logic started to sink in. I had no where else to go so I turned back towards the flat. Thankfully Sherlock wasn't there when I got back so I had a shower and crawled into bed. The next morning, having slept badly, I still felt sore in my chest. This time it wasn't the flash backs or the nightmares but I knew I had to bury it and move on. Sherlock was still my best friend, I hope. "John." I jumped out of bed ready to fight as Mycroft stood at the door of my bedroom. "Mycroft, good god you scared the hell out of me!" I grabbed the bed side bench for my heart to stop beating a million miles an hour. Pleased that I was in decent pyjamas but Mycroft was still glaring at me. "What happened?" Mycroft demanded. "What." I answered stupidly. "I want to know what happened last night." Mycroft repeated getting toey. "Is Sherlock ok?" I asked instantly worried. "He will be." Mycroft replied getting more and more frustrated with me. I stared to go red, as Mycroft glared at me waiting for my answer. "Sherlock kissed me." I blurted out quickly. "Then what happened?" Mycroft didn't even flinched when I said Sherlock had kissed me. "Um, I yelled at him, he said I was an experiment." I answered realising Sherlock had no idea how to deal with that. I groaned rubbing my face. "Please tell me he didn't do anything stupid." I couldn't keep the worry out of my voice. "You know he has no idea on social graces. He has never dated before." Mycroft pointed out what I had just realised. I got offended thinking he was using me as a lab experiment but that's not what he meant by experiment. "I know, I'm a dick. Where is he Mycroft?" I pretty much begged. "His old room." Mycroft answered only without the frustration this time. I quickly showered and dressed and headed to Sherlock's childhood house with Mycroft.
"Tell me Sherlock Holmes, who do you believe, your scenes or John." Her scent and stance screamed Beta but John had slept with her.
"John." I answer. She smiled, I passed her little test.
Sherlock's POV
After making Sherlock help put all my jumpers away it was just after lunch. "Sandwich?" I suggested heading to the kitchen, Sherlock shrugged. "Tea?" I suggested "yup!" He answered popping the P. Once seated at the kitchen table, tea each and a jam sandwich in front of me I watched Sherlock. "Why are you so detached from your emotions?" I blurted out. "They distract me." Sherlock answered not looking at me. "Am I a distraction." I asked curious. "Yes." Sherlock answered. "Oh." I replied. "I don't mean to be." I don't know why I asked, I shouldn't have. It hurt to think I distracted him. "It's good." Sherlock suddenly murmured. "What do you mean it's good?" I asked trying not to sound as hurt as I felt. "It helps calm my mind, makes my Mind Palace easier to navigate." I had seen Sherlock many a times in his Mind Palace and I often wondered what it would be like in there. "What's it like in there?" I asked feeling stupid. "It used to be crowded, cramped, claustrophobic even. The drugs made it easy to forget it. Well more like a fog to hide it all so I didn't have to think." Sherlock still hadn't looked at me. "You don't still, 'use', do you?" I asked, feeling even more stupid. "No, I haven't needed them since, well. Since we had sex." Sherlock blurted out the last bit. "So you where using drugs when I moved in, all those times you locked yourself in your room, you where high!" I tried to keep my voice calm. Sherlock just nodded. I ran my hands through my hair and rubbed my face. How did I not see. I'm a god damn doctor and I couldn't see it. No I knew something was up, I just didn't want to see it. I have seen what drugs do to people and what happens to those that love those people. I knew sex with me wasn't going to change an addiction. Before I could say anything else Sherlock's phone chimed. He looked at it and groaned. "What's up?" I asked pulling the crust off my uneaten sandwich. "My parents are going to be in town and have 'requested' our presents at a Holmes dinner." Sherlock started to pace around the kitchen. "It can't be that bad." I replied watching him. "Well your going to find out." Sherlock turned to me, I looked at him confused. "Your presents has been 'requested' too." My face fell. "They know." I breathed. "Of course they know." Sherlock ran his hands through his hair. "We have to get you a suit, tie, good shoes..." Sherlock started listing things we had to do first. The more he talked the more nervous I got, I hadn't met his parents and I was getting the feeling this wasn't going to end well.
Sherlocks POV
"It's my job Captain, now do yours and give me a medical report on my team." The Major demanded, Watson huffed.
John POV
I must have drifted off, I woke to Sherlock staring at me. Which is an improvement from waking in a sweaty panic mess like normal and at least this time he wasn't inches from my face but still sitting beside me, his long lean legs practically wrapped up so he could face me on the couch. "John." He was checking to see if I was awake. "Yeah Sherlock." I answered in a half yawn. "Where you serious about the experiment or just been 'nice'." Sherlock was questioning me, Mr reads-me-like-a-book was questioning me. "Yeah Sherlock I was serious." It don't stop me swallowing hard however and my palms to instantly get sweaty. He unwrapped his long legs so he could get closer to me, he stopped a couple of inches away from my face, he was hesitate. My Sherlock was hesitating. Something took over me as I lent forward and closed the gap between us gently pressing my lips against his. I pulled away to make sure he was ok as I looked into his eyes, they made me go crazy just looking into them. I realised I was going to have to start this now, I was the experienced one after all. I took a deep breath and went for it. I pushed my lips against his a little more desperate this time as I slid my hand through his mass of curls on the back of his head. I was instantly hard, I went to put my hand on Sherlock's thigh to balance myself but I missed and put it directly on top of his hard on and omg he was hard and huge. I had definitely started something as Sherlock pushed me back on to the couch, like a burning desperation had taken over him. He ripped my jumper and shirt off me just so he could get to more of my skin he dragged his fine long fingers down my chest making me shudder in pleasure as he kissed whatever he could get to. "John" his voice shook, "my bed." I didn't need asking twice as I grabbed his hand and lend him to his bedroom only this time I pushed him onto his bed ripping his shirt off as I went. His eyes practically shone as I slid my trousers off and dropped them on the floor. I knelt over him. "Sherlock." I suddenly stopped. "How far do you want to go?" I could see it all clicking over in his mind. "I don't know." Sherlock answered, something I had never heard from his lips before. "Well tell me to stop when you want to stop. Ok." Sherlock nodded. I wanted him badly but I didn't want to hurt him either. We have both had enough hurt for a life time. Hell I hadn't even had sex with a guy before so I decided I should keep it simple. I kissed him again, he was starting to get the hang of it as he started to kiss me deeper. I gently slid my hand down his side as I used my other hand to keep myself steady. I unzipped his pants that were stretched tightly over his manhood. I slid them as far down as I could reach before Sherlock madly kicked them off. I gently ran my hand over him I heard him gasp between kisses. I had no idea a noise like that could turn me on even more, especially in his velvet voice. It made it so hard to concentrate and stay calm. I ran a finger along the top seam of his boyleg pants as he tried to push himself back into my hand. I smirked, he was enjoying himself. I gently slid his boylegs off allowing his manhood to finally be free. I gently grabbed it as Sherlock gasped again and groaned as I slid my hand down his shaft. He isn't going to last long I mused but the look of complete pleasure on his face was worth it, I could feel myself getting turned on more and more just by watching him. I had to stop kissing him so he could breath as his back arched and he clenched the sides of the bed for dear life. "Omg John!" He groaned as I felt him come on my hand I couldn't help but come at the same time even thought he wasn't even touching me. Just watching him was enough, the unbridled emotion he always had clamped down was out and out for me. His eyes where still closed as little shivers ran through his body. I lay beside him and put my head on his chest. Suddenly he rolled over towards me and wrapped himself around me pulling the blanket over us both at the same time.
He spread Sherlock's legs, then, pushed his knees up and apart. Sherlock looked apprehensive but John just smiled at him. "I've never done this, didn't think I ever would want to, but I do. If I'm bad at it, I promise I won't get mad if you say so." And without another word of warning, he lowered his head and took Sherlock in his mouth.
"Oh?"
"Fine, John. Whatever you say," Sherlock said as he dashed off the couch, fingers shaking as he tore open the pack and found his lighter hidden under the skull. He lit the cigarette, closed his eyes, inhaled deeply, and as he exhaled he fixed John with an absolutely lust filled gaze. John swallowed. "So what else did you buy at the store?" Sherlock said in a low velvety voice.
"Hmm? Drunk? Oh, yes! I...am..drunk. Excellent deduction, John. I fancied a drink or two down the pub, I did. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go have a bath." Sherlock removed his jacket, forgetting entirely the bruise blackening on his arm. "Sherlock, what the hell is that?" John asked, grabbing hold of Sherlock's wrist to turn him round. "I gave blood." "You got drunk and gave blood? Are they taking alcohol laced blood now?" "No. I gave blood, then I went down the pub." "Well, there you go, you bloody git! No wonder you got drunk off one or two drinks. You're not supposed to drink after giving blood!"
An hour later, John and Sherlock were settled on the couch together with their dinner and a DVD. John had thought better of the beer, which Sherlock didn't particularly like, and opted for a bottle of white wine instead. He wanted them to be relaxed this evening, as he had decided to stop shunning Sherlock and try to resume their budding relationship. After they had finished eating, John cleared the takeaway bins and, upon coming back to the couch, curled up right next to Sherlock. Sherlock froze, not sure what had changed, so John took him by the arm and slung it across his own shoulders.  They had lit a fire shortly after arriving home from the video store and it was very warm and cozy inside the flat, making John feel all the more cuddly. As John snuggled into Sherlock's chest, he made a small contented sound at the back of his throat. This, he thought, I can do all day. Sherlock looked down at him. He wasn't sure why John was suddenly making contact again, but he certainly wasn't going to complain. He wasn't even going to ask because that would inevitably lead to some sort of relationship conversation and he abhorred those more than he abhorred John basically ignoring him for a week. John decided his position wasn't the most comfortable and instead spread out on the couch, tucking his feet under him and laying his head in Sherlock's lap. Sherlock draped his arm over John and used the other to hand to gently run through John's hair.
As he pushed John's head down and angled his hips up, he knew the moment he hit that mysterious spot they both had. John clenched and bore down on his cock, holding it there and rocking against it. Sherlock buried his head between John's shoulder blades and listened as John came, long and hard and white hot, and he came with him.
Uggghhhh! I'm so sorry! I just HAD to end it there. I promise, one more chapter.
"What were you...oh."
Sherlock took John's hand and kissed his fingers, all the while maintaining eye contact and sliding his own hand down his stomach and over the top of his boxers to grasp himself. His eyes closed and he palmed himself gently, allowing the silk to slide over his member. He opened his eyes again and looked at John as his breath started to quicken. John seized his mouth. He kissed Sherlock hard and bit his lip, Sherlock opened his mouth as his hand quickened its pace and he began to tremble. All of a sudden, John grabbed his hand and said "Let me." Sherlock pulled his hand away.
John stared at Sherlock. What was he doing? Here was this man, this brilliant, amazing, inspiring man...wanting him. A man who didn't want anyone wanted him. And he wanted him too. So what was the problem? What did it matter what people would think? And when did John start caring about that? "Come here, now." he said to his best friend. Sherlock sat back down and John reached for his hands. Holding both of Sherlock's hands in his, he looked directly into his eyes. "I don't know how this works. You being asexual, I mean. Do you ever....?" "Ever what?" "Get turned on? Have sex? Have you ever had sex? Have you ever kissed anyone? Have you ever wanked?" Sherlock blushed for the third time that day. "Don't be so crass, John, it doesn't suit you. But, to answer your questions, yes, no, no, no, yes. I get turned on. Sometimes. I am human, contrary to people's jokes. But not the way most people do. I am a virgin. I have not kissed anyone because up until this point the idea of someone's saliva in my mouth makes me feel like vomitting. I have not wanked in years, I find it degrading and dull." "Up until this point?" "Well, obviously I wanted to kiss you a few minutes ago." "So the idea of my saliva in your mouth...?" Sherlock felt another tightening in his groin and he stared blankly at John. With a groan, John pressed his lips against Sherlock's.
John decides to stop pussy footing around.
"I'm sorry! Sorry! Reflex..." he said.  John looked up at him and laughed. "It's okay, Sherlock. I shouldn't have made any sudden movements." He got off the floor and crawled back to Sherlock's side. He reached out and caressed the side of Sherlock's face. He slowly ran his hand down Sherlock's shoulder, over his ribcage and to his shirt hem again, never taking his eyes off Sherlock's. This time, Sherlock closed his eyes and raised his arms allowing John to free him of the thin cotton. His nipples instantly hardened in the cold and he felt goosebumps raise all over his body. John took no time at all to realize this and dragged his hands to rub up and down his arms while still staring into his eyes. He ran his hands up over Sherlock's shoulders and around his neck as he went in for another kiss. This time, when Sherlock opened his mouth, John sliped his tongue into his mouth just the tiniest bit. Sherlock groaned and let his tongue do a little exploring of its own, just lightly caressing John's without leaving his own mouth. This time it was John who broke away. "Okay. You're lying. You have kissed before." Sherlock laughed at this but shook his head no. "I don't believe it. You're too good." "I am an extremely observant man, John, and I do watch quite a lot of tv."
He was standing by the pool. John came out of the shadows and just stared at Sherlock. For a moment, Sherlock was in shock. It can't be! He trusted this man! He can't be Moriarty. Then John started to talk. His speech was all off. Halting, with a tinge of curiosity. As if he didn't know which words would fall from his mouth next.  Suddenly, everything was clear. He was speaking for someone else. Everything happened so fast after that. Gay Jim making his presence known,the big speech and then...shots fired. Straight to John's heart and Sherlock felt his own heart burst into flames as John fell. And Sherlock screamed.
Once his hair was washed and every ounce of the day's various mishaps washed from his body, John stood under the hot water and tried to ease the tension from his shoulders. It had been a long week. No cases made Sherlock very antsy and John knew he was wondering, but would not mention, what was keeping John at bay. He had decided that he was being a prat, but every time he went to touch Sherlock, the memory of the feel of a hot heavy cock in his hand gave him pause. It wasn't as though he had never touched one. He was a doctor, after all. But those were never hard, always a little more than flaccid as the patient was usually quite uncomfortable under Doctor Watson's scrutiny. It was a bit odd, new, yes. But what really had him disturbed was the idea of what do I do with it? It can't be that hard, he thought, you do have one of your own. He closed his eyes and reached his hand down, trying to imagine it was Sherlock's instead of his own.  He palmed himself until he had worked it into a rather impressive hard on. Having not done this for a while, he knew he wouldn't last long. He tried to go slow, gently stroking himself. He gave his wrist a few turns on the upstroke and ran his thumb over the slit. It did not last long at all and he quickly found himself grappling for a hold as he came hot and hard over his fist. He really hoped that given the chance, he could make Sherlock last a bit longer.
"Okay, yeah. I ran off to my shrink. You're right about that. But I wasn't traumatized by anything. I think you were. I don't know if it was the porn, or me catching you watching it. But last night, you seemed keen enough and this morning you shut me out and now you're trying to put words in my mouth." "I was not traumatized. I...I was...repulsed. By the porn. It was disgusting. And I was humiliated that you caught me watching it." "Why were you watching it to begin with?" "I need to learn exactly what I will be expected to do." "Oh, Sherlock. Please come sit on the couch with me." "No." "Sherlock."
At this, Sherlock's lungs seemed to give out. Where had that come from? One second they were talking about feelings and the next, John was talking about Sherlock's cock. He stared at John, unable to respond. He did, however, feel something he hadn't felt since he was about 14. A very definite tightening in his groin. Well, that was a strange sensation. He looked down, without an ounce of subtelty, and back up to John, who also looked straight to Sherlock's lap. Their eyes met. "I don't think I can fight this anymore," Sherlock said. Then he leaned over and hovered about an inch from John's mouth. "May I?" he asked. John knew that if he did this, there may be no going back. He moved his head further from Sherlock's, closed his eyes, and took a deep, shuddering breath. "Sherlock," he said, and Sherlock stood. "No need, John. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that I just...I don't know what I was thinking. Go back to bed. I'm okay now."
Characters are not mine and I seek nothing but steamy comments in compensation for my work.
Suddenly, Sherlock's hands were on him again, he was caressing John's thigh and whispering sweet nothings in his ear and telling him to relax, to breathe, and then he felt the head of his cock start to enter him. He immediately forgot to  breathe, forgot not to clench, and hissed when Sherlock's cockhead popped past the ring of muscle and settled there, just inside his tight virginal ass. Sherlock groaned and John groaned and Sherlock pulled out again, which hurt, but was followed by an immense sense of relief.
John lay there with his mouth open and understood now why Sherlock bit the pillow. He felt like all of his senses were completely overwhelmed and he just wanted to bury his face in something and give himself completely over to the emotions and feelings of lust and love and pleasure they were driving in him. His cock lay completely abandoned, red and straining and leaking on his belly. He suddenly reached down and began to stroke himself, but Sherlock pulled his hand away and he whined. He thought he sounded pathetic. He never thought this could be him, laying in bed with a man between his thighs, fingers inside his ass, mewling and quivering and writhing beneath him. He didn't care, though. Not when Sherlock began to suckle at the head of his cock like a newborn calf on his mother's tit. "Jesus, Sherlock, I can't. I can't  take it. If you want me before I cum, you better take me now." God, he sounded wrecked. He could only imagine how he looked.
"So you made me brush my teeth just so we could indulge in marinara and garlic?" he asked with a raised brow. John paused with his fork halfway to his mouth and laughed. "Hadn't thought of that. I...um...I thought Giovanni's would be...kind of...romantic? Because...well..." "Ah. Yes. Our first dinner together." "Our first case." "Yes." Sherlock smiled and took a big bite of the garlic bread. Very romantic, indeed.
So while Sherlock waited for John to come home so that he could pounce on him and demand some nicotine, he decided to play his violin. Composing helped him get lost and would stave the craving a bit.
"Why?" John asked, clearly upset.  "Because I have been walking through London for hours and I am parched."  "No. I want to know why, Sherlock. Why are you doing this to yourself? Why didn't you come to me? I'm a doctor, I have experience with this. I did a short residency in a drug facility I could have helped." Upon hearing this, Sherlock froze.  He slowly turned back towards John, forgetting the tea and feeling his lip curl into a snarl.  "Why? You want to know why? And you think you could have helped? HA! John Watson, I believe with all my heart that you're the last person in the world that could help. Not that I needed any. And as for why, if you want to know that you need only look into a mirror because you, John, are why!!!"
He pressed again and Sherlock arched back into his touch and began fucking himself down on John's fingers, trying to get more, for John to press harder. "Oh God Sherlock, what are you doing to me?" he said breathlessly as he looked up into his beautiful face. "I love you so much." And he used the hand not currently buried in his lover to grab Sherlock's hair, pulled him into a rough kiss, and with one more pointed jab at his prostate, Sherlock came. John rutted hard against him through his orgasm. As Sherlock collapsed against John's neck shaking and whimpering, he withdrew his fingers, clutched Sherlock tightly to him, and found his own, watching intently as his cum mixed with Sherlock's on both their bellies.
Later, Sherlock was sitting staring at nothing again. He would have been staring at John's chair but John was sitting in it and he had made it quite clear that it "creeped him out" when Sherlock stared at him for hours. Once again, Sherlock was stumped. This was not a feeling he handled well. What's changed, Sherlock? he thought. What is different? Why would you allow one man's life to stop you catching Moriarty? God! I just need one more day. One more day to get John Watson out of my head. He went to his room and fished out his kit from the hiding place he had cut into his mattress. Anderson and LeStrade never flipped his mattress. Morons. Tourniquet on, and Sherlock got off. As the drug worked its tendrils into him, Sherlock grabbed his violin and started to play a low, melancholy tune until he drifted off to sleep.
John laid back down and let Sherlock lay on top of him again. "Is this how you want me?" he asked. "Well, yes, John, I want to look at you. But, to use your own words, I'm not going to just take you." John shuddered at that. He didn't expect as much but didn't say so. Sherlock using the words "take you" suddenly sent a chill down his spine. He wanted to be taken. Now. Though he knew that wasn't sensible. Instead he reached down and began to stroke Sherlock to hardness again.
John climbed over to Sherlock, draped himself over him supporting himself on his hands, and kissed him long and deep as he slowly settled his pelvis over his. They both groaned as their bare cocks came together for the first time. John popped the bottle cap open and slicked himself with a moan. Sherlock flinched and John said "Easy. Easy, silly. I'm not just going to take you." Sherlock relaxed again and watched as John slid his hand up and down his own member and over the head. Then he poured more lube on his hand and did the same for Sherlock. Sherlock whined and arched into the heavenly touch. Then John laid back down on top of him and they began to slide together.
"I was just..."
The next morning Sherlock awoke feeling relaxed and ready to find Moriarty. It suddenly seemed very important to catch him and make sure people were safe. Odd. However, when he opened his eyes, he was greeted by John Watson sitting in a chair next to his bed. "Hello," John said. He seemed angry. But not in the way he was usually angry at Sherlock. He did not yell, he did not kick the chair or throw anything. No, this was worse. This was quiet, controlled. Like he had had time to practice this moment.  Sherlock sat up and promptly noticed that he felt nude. He tentatively lifted the sheet and indeed, he was. Funny, though. He distinctly remembered falling asleep fully clothed. "John, what's going on?" "I had a good think last night and I thought maybe we could have a chat about it." Sherlock wanted to make a joke about John's excitement over a good think but thought it would earn him a good punch.
Sherlock felt ashamed for a second. Apparently, John was getting better at deductions after all their time spent together. Either that or he was the first person to see Sherlock clearly, maybe ever. Either way, he didn't get to think about it long because John was on top of him, kissing him so tenderly and slowly grinding their hard cocks together. "Now you may touch me if you want to," John said against his mouth. Sherlock took the lube again and applied some more to his hand. He reached behind John and slowly started to breach him as they kissed.
"John, please, may I just have a cuppa before you start in again?"
They hadn't done this before. John had kept his kisses strictly to Sherlock's mouth and except for that one time, which he chose not to think about, had kept his hands above Sherlock's waist. Sherlock simply nuzzled into John's hair in confirmation and John continued his journey across his throat and collarbones. When he reached the point the shirt would stretch no further he asked "Can I take this off?" Sherlock hesitated. He wasn't sure why he felt so odd when John's skin pressed against his. It was sort of like forgetting deodorant, the odd friction. But he knew this wasn't going to go far at all without removing some clothing, so he nodded and lifted his arms. John removed his shirt slowly, like he was unveiling some great statue. He looked Sherlock over, whispered "My God" and continued his ministrations on his newly exposed skin. The feeling was incredible. As it turns out, when the two bodies of skin are slightly sheened in sweat, they slide much easier across eachother. John kissed and sucked and bit and licked at Sherlock's skin like it was far more delicious than the dinner they had just consumed. Sherlock's breath was coming faster and faster as John worked his way down to his stomach. He paused there, right at the top of the line of hair that lead into Sherlock's trousers. He looked up at Shelock and smiled. "Never been with anyone with a happy trail," he said with a wink and very carefully ran his tongue from Sherlock's waistline to the top of the "happy trail." Sherlock arched his back and hissed through his teeth and John grinned like the Cheshire Cat. It was the most erotic thing he. had. ever. seen.
----------------------------------------------
John has a bit of an episode but don't worry, he and Sherlock kiss and make up
John very slowly unbuttoned and unzipped the flies. When he had his trousers off, he kissed his stomach again and fingered gently at the hem of Sherlock's pants. Sherlock always wore silk boxers, John knew. But feeling them like this was entirely new. He wanted to slide his hand across them and feel Sherlock's hardness that was so obviously underneath. But that old apprehension was back. He looked up at Sherlock. Sherlock was gazing down at him with heavy lidded, slightly gazed over eyes. He saw immediately that John had gone from lust filled to hesitant. He removed John's hand from the top of his boxers and laid down in the bed with him again. "Can I show you what I used to like? When I was 14 and allowed myself such indecent pleasures?" "Please do." John said, as if he were inviting him to have a seat in his office and not inviting him to pleasure himself publicly.
John wakes up hearing Sherlock screaming his name and the situation comes to a head.
John's breath caught in his throat as he took in Sherlock's appearance. He was laying in his bed, legs spread and knees pulled up, his most intimate parts on full display for John and John alone. His marble skin was blotchy and red and covered in a thin layer of sweat. His curls were all over the place and his pupils were blown and his lips and cheeks were red. John stared at him, rubbing his hand up and down Sherlock's thigh, and said "Beautiful. You are so beautiful. How could it take me so long to see how absolutely beautiful you are?" He bent and kissed the bend in his knee, kissed up his thigh and bit the soft flesh there. Sherlock whimpered. "John, please, I need to..." "Ssshh, ssshhh...okay." He crawled back up to Sherlock and kissed him, taking him in his arms to lay on his side. As he fit their hips together once more, he reached back and spread Sherlock open again.
John's a wee bit taken aback by the accusation
He stood and reached for Sherlock's hand who gave it, albeit a bit hesitantly. John led him to the bedroom and lowered him onto the bed. "Don't look so frightened. I'm not trying to plunder your virtue." John pushed Sherlock down onto his side and crawled in next to him. He placed his leg where it had been before. It wasn't a sexual thing, it was John's favorite way to cuddle. To be as close as possible to someone without being actually inside them. He stretched his arm above his head and ruffled Sherlock's curls. He loved those curls. They made Sherlock look rather...pretty. His other hand reached over and wrapped around Sherlock's waist and stared into his eyes. They had done this before, stared at eachother. Often. John often felt Sherlock taking him in when he thought John wasn't paying attention. It always gave John goosebumps and he was just beginning to understand why. John also had a tendency to stare at Sherlock, and he was sure it had not gone unnoticed. Not many things did. He never thought about it, never connected any dots. Sherlock was brilliant, beautiful, ofcoarse he stared. A lot of people did.
John sat back, clearly shocked and stung by the accusation Sherlock had just hurled at him.  His jaw dropped and he looked so vulnerable Sherlock wanted to take it all back. Now where did that come from? He wondered.  Sherlock Holmes almost never regretted shouting the truth at someone. In fact, he did it regularly without giving it a second thought.  What was this power this short, serious, troubled man held over him?
"Were you dreaming about the pool again?" he asked.  "Yes. You were shot this time."  "I wasn't, though. I'm okay. We are both okay.". "No. I am not okay. I dont do this, John. I dont feel. I certainly don't feel for people. I've never experienced this before. You have. Tell me how to make it go away." "You think I've experienced this before? Are you joking? Sherlock, this is all new to me and I don't like it any more than you do. Never in my life have I thought 'yeah, that man is stunning.' Never have I wondered what it would be like to feel a man's lips against mine. Never have I wondered what it would be like to run my hands over smooth hard flesh instead of soft curvy skin. Or how I would like to be underneath a man's heavy body or feel a hot hard cock slide into me. At least, not until I met you."
Sherlock sighed into it. He wasn't remotely used to this, someone kissing him so easily like it came naturally. He supposed it did come naturally to most people. Never to him. He wondered if he'd get used to it in time, but kind of hoped he wouldn't. He liked the flutter of anticipation he felt when John came towards him like that, the brief impulse to run that he is able to quell. At least some primal instincts are still manageable by him.
John needed to think clearly, without the sound of Sherlock's violin filling the apartment. He also thought that maybe he should have a chat with someone about these new developments in is life. Falling for a man, a slightly mad, completely brilliant man, was a pretty big deal. Especially when all you'd ever been interested in before were women. Unfortunately, John had few friends. Mrs. Hudson would never be able to stop squealing if John told her. LeStrade would also probably cheer and carry on like an ass if he found out. Molly would cry hysterically and Sherlock obviously knew but was not the person to talk to. Yet. But, oh, they would talk about this. So John did what he felt was mostly unnecesary but sometimes quite helpful: he popped in at his therapist's.

John's POV
"Sherlock, what are you doing?" I asked as his eyes studied mine inches away from my face.  "Experiment" he mumbled. I was almost sleep on the couch when I realised he was staring at me, only this time he was kneeling on the floor, his elbows on my thighs as he held his face in his hands. I couldn't stop my cheeks starting to flush. I could feel his breath against my cheek, it only made me blush more. He shuffled his body even closer to me, his face was slightly curious obviously wanting a reaction from me. I froze, I had no idea what the hell Sherlock was up too. I tried to stay calm as I took in his features, his pale skin, defined cheekbones, his curly hair and omg his eyes. I don't know why his eyes were so intriguing, whenever he looked at me I couldn't help butterfly's swirl in my stomach. OMG, I just realised I was getting a hard on. Holy shit, Am I gay? Wait Sherlock is going to notice, he notices everything. Shit shit shit! Someone knocked on the door making both of us jump. Sherlock's face changed, his unique look just for Mycroft. He headed away from the door to sulk in his arm chair. I took a deep calming breath before heading to the door. "John." He nodded to me taking in my flushed face but not saying anything. The deduction thing ran in the family so god knows what Mycroft thought about what he had just interrupted. I decided to busy myself in the kitchen while Sherlock and Mycroft had their brotherly moment. Whatever Sherlock was up to his brothers visit had interrupted it enough that it never came up again that night.

John POV
Am I Gay?
Lestrade invited us to join the team about to storm the supposed safe house of the three. Unfortunately once we got there the three where gone and only one left at the house was an old lady. "Sherlock, John this is Tony Parker's mother Abigail Parker." Lestrade introduced us to an older woman who looked tired and stressed. "Tony is the 'helper' in the recent murders and bashings of gay people, but your aware of that aren't you Ms Parker." Sherlock started to interrogate the old woman. "Tony is his own man, I don't enquire in his business." She replied weakly. Sherlock studied the woman, it was like they were having a conversation without speaking. "She knows nothing." Sherlock suddenly announced. "They aren't coming back here." Sherlock turned to everyone. "We may as well leave." Lestrade and I followed Sherlock stunned. Out on the street Lestrade grabbed Sherlock's arm. "What the hell is that about" he whispered grinding his teeth at the same time. "They can hear her." Sherlock pulled Lestrade to his face making it look like they were having a heated argument. "We need everyone to leave and she will meet up with us elsewhere." Sherlock pretended to look angry with Lestrade. "Ok." He answered before letting go of Sherlock and getting his team to move on. Sherlock then rounded on me. "Talk to me, pretend to calm me down." Sherlock hissed at me. I put my hand on his arm. "Sherlock, you shouldn't have yelled at Lestrade." I huffed at him. "But their idiots!" Sherlock huffed back at me. Our pretend conversation continued until everyone but Lestrade had left the house. He headed towards us. "Lestrade, John here says I was been unreasonable. Let me buy you a coffee to apologies." Sherlock glared at Lestrade implying he must accept. "Sure Sherlock, I shouldn't have snapped at you either." Sherlock took off towards a coffee shop, a very confused Lestrade and I following behind. "Order something" Sherlock instructed as he selected a table to sit at. As Lestrade and I ordered a drink each then joined Sherlock in a booth right at the back of the shop. "You two sit there." Sherlock gestured we sit facing him with our backs to the door so Sherlock could be easily seen from the front door. "John give me your hands." Sherlock demanded. I put my hands out on the table and he took both of them in his, I went bright red as Lestrade looked at us mouth open shocked. "Shut your mouth Lestrade, make it like we are talking. Ms Parker comes here every day, it is her safe place away from her son. She wants this to stop but she isn't safe." Sherlock quickly explained. Sherlock was pretending to look at me but in fact was looking at the door over my head. "Good thing I'm short." I whispered Sherlock looked in my eyes, smirked and gave my hands a squeeze before looking back at the door. I heard the door open, Sherlock stood up, "come sit next to me John" he pulled me by my hands to slide in the booth first. I noticed the movement allowed Ms Parker to see us as I sat back down and Sherlock slid in beside me. Sherlock pretended to talk to us as Ms Parker silently slid in beside Lestrade. "Thank you." She smiled weakly to Sherlock. The waiter came over and put his hand on Ms Parker's shoulder. "Are these guys in your seat Ms Parker?" He asked protectively. "No, it's ok Danny. They are helping me with Tony." She smiled weakly up at the young man. "Well a friend of yours is always welcome here Ms Parker." He smiled walking back to the counter to finish our orders. "I know what Tony has been up to, he has lost his way. Tony's girlfriend left him a year or so ago for another woman, he has never gotten over it. He was so angry, he gets that from his father, my late husband." The more she talked the more she reminded me of my mother, the violence from my father etched into my brain. She, like my mother couldn't bare leave him and is devastated by his death. I tried wiping the sweat from my palms on my trousers when suddenly Sherlock's hand was on top of mine under the table. He was still completely focused on what Ms Parker was saying. Ms Parker confirmed everything Sherlock had deduced and the decision was made that Lestrade would have teams watching the house while also keeping their distance and they wouldn't arrest them at or near the house.
"People on my team don't die from mistakes!" She snapped back.
"James, one of my patients has been transferred before I could clear her." James scrubbed his face with his hands.
The following 2 months where kinda strange, I would wake in the middle of the night with Sherlock wrapped around me. Having fallen asleep alone, his eyes open and deep in thought but his arms and legs wrapped around me. Or I would be sitting on the couch and he would curl into my lap like a huge elegant lap cat. Nothing was said about the night in Sherlock's bed, every now and again he would nuzzle into my neck while I cooked or while I was on the laptop. I didnt mind, actually it was nice and things were relaxed. I would still come home to find a human body part in the fridge or cases spread across the flat. After a shitty shift at the clinic I came home to Sherlock in what seemed like just his robe playing his violin, I really became accustom to his playing. I would often hear it in my sleep. He was standing looking out the window playing the most amazing piece absent mindly. I used the chance to look at him, long thin limbs but always so graceful. His torso may have been sculptured into his gorgeous arse. He stood tall but I knew that confidence was fake most of the time. I realised watching him was turning me on, I moved uncomfortable in my trousers and looked away. I took my coat off and quietly closed the door, I didn't want to interupt him. I looked back to find him facing more towards me, his robe was open and he wasnt wearing anything. My mouth dropped open, well at least the window wasnt low enough for anyone to see too much but from my view everything was on show. "Your staring." Sherlock pointed out without stopping playing and without looking at me. I looked away. "Should you be so close to the window, um dressed like that." My voice shook as I spoke. Sherlock shrugged, I had to move so I headed to the kitchen to put the kettle on. The music stopped. "Did you not like what you saw?" Sherlock asked me now heading towards me. I smirked, "of course I do but I don't want you giving some poor dear a heart attack out on the street." I replied not totally game enough to look at him while hiding my physical reaction behind the cupboard. "So you liked it." Sherlock smirked at me. Jesus he made me feel like a horny school boy again. I felt my face start to burn with embarrassment which was enough to answer Sherlock's question. He slid in behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist. Not only was he not wearing anything under his open robe he was pushing his hard on against my back. "How are your ribs?" I asked trying to be casual but almost dropping a cup. "Better." He murmured as he started to kiss my neck, his warm breath against my skin and his curls tickling me. I couldn't concentrate on making tea so I turned around to face him only for him to push me up onto the counter so now we were face to face. He took my face in his hands and kissed me passionately as I slid my hands around his waist. The next thing I know my clothes are on the kitchen floor and he has me completely in his mouth. Rolling his tongue over the tip, all I could do was hold onto the bench and try not to cry out in pleasure too loudly. "Sherlock, I'm going to come." I warned him so he could stop if he didn't want me to climax in his mouth but he didn't stop. I couldn't believe Sherlock just gave me the best blow job in my life on the kitchen bench. He wiped his face on his hand as he stood up, I just stared at him in amazement. I realised he was wanking himself while staring in my eyes so I took over sliding my hands behind his. He let me take over as he put both his hands either side of me to keep himself stable as he climaxed into my lap.
John POV
Sherlock was certainly strange, life was never dull really. I was never sure what I was going to home too at least I knew Sherlock wasn't going to hurt me. The first time ever a home where no one wanted to beat me up or kill me. It was a nice change. He would shoot at the walls, leave a head in the fridge but I knew I was safe. Tonight after a standard day shift at the clinic I came home to a quiet Sherlock, sitting on the couch, his 'thinking pose', eyes closed, hands like a steeple under his chin. I couldn't help but smile, he needed a hair cut, his curls were starting to cover his eyes. I suddenly had a massive urge to push the curls out of his eyes. When he's phone started to ring making me jump, was I just perving on Sherlock! "John, phone." Sherlock murmured, I huffed out of habit rather then actually been annoyed. I went for his side jacket pocket, no phone. I realised it was in his breast pocket. I took a deep breath and slid my hand into his chest pocket, his chest was warm against my hand and my face was so close to his I could feel his warm breath on my cheek. I couldn't help but blush, thankfully Sherlock's eyes were still closed. I answered the phone. It was Lestrade, he had a new case. Sherlock was already off the couch and halfway down the stairs by the time I hung up. I quickly grabbed my coat and met Sherlock in the street as he climbed into a cab I quickly followed suit. I gave the cabbie the address Lestrade had given me. I followed Sherlock up the stairs to the flat, I could already hear Lestrade. Sherlock pushed the door open ignoring practically everyone heading straight for Lestrade's voice. A man was sitting in the lounge room crying uncontrollably with a police officer watching him. I kept moving catching up to Sherlock. He was already in the bedroom, a woman was face down on the bed, knife stab wound to the back. Sherlock was looking around the room while Lestrade barked orders at Sherlock which, as per normal Sherlock ignored. "Deceased is May Franks, husband down stairs is Arthur Franks." Lestrade explained I went straight to the body, there was something off about her that I couldn't put my finger on. The photographer nodded saying I could turn her over. I gently grabbed her shoulder rolling her over to see her face. She was well dressed, much like the whole house. Everything was extremely well cared for. The stab wound had gone all the way through, around the aorta, she would have bled to death in seconds. "He was murdered by someone he knew, he trusted them and they literately stabbed him in the back. Male murderer, knew what he was doing. Planned but not experienced." Sherlock started. "Sherlock the victim is female." Lestrade beat me to the obvious. "No, victim is male, almost female." He huffed as we all stared at him. "Those legs are not female, he has been transistioning however for quite awhile. Obviously found love, he knows." Sherlock gestured to the man down stairs. "Had the fake breasts for a while and lots of practice on the high heels. Moved to London from the country to transition. To get away from objecting family. I would start with them. Probably the father but then the bedroom is a little too personal so maybe a brother. You will find hormone drugs in the top draw of that side, thats his side." Sherlock pointed to the far side. Lestrade went for the draws. "Sherlock, she has obviously gone to a lot of effort to be a she. Lets stay with that pronoun?" I suggested. "Ok." Sherlock agreed. Sure enough Lestrade found a hormone drug for males transitioning to female in the top draw.

"Damnit!" The Major snapped punching the wall. "The fucking Intel was wrong, I'm going to string them from their dicks. Stg O'Brien was dead when we got there, I wasn't going to leave his body. We got ambushed on the way out that's when nurse Cox got shot, I was hoping she would hold on but it was a chest hit and Corporal Smidt was in a bad way before the ambush, god damnit!" The Major was ready to punch the wall again.
John POV
I quickly grabbed a packet of biscuits and chewed on them waiting for Sherlock to reply. All sorts of things swam through my mind.
My mind felt, clearer, calmer, I felt calmer. It was better then a drug induced calm. I watched John pull open his laptop to work on the blog. Had to do something, but what, what do you do for a boyfriend. I wasn't calling Mycroft for advice either. Wait I have seen John get flowers, yeah big bright ones. I can get John flowers. I hadn't felt like this, ever, I try not to feel. "It's a distraction" Mycroft would say. I grabbed my coat and told John I'd be back. I had never really felt so indecisive before, well not as an adult, after about five different florists I hadn't been able to find those big stupid flowers. They were big bright coloured ones, happy looking, which I guess is what John made me feel. It was starting to get cooler when I finally found a corner store, they sold flowers, I should try them. I went up to the clerk, young girl, didn't want to be there but has a smoking addiction, hard life and resentful of it. I tried to ignore her finger nailing picking and asked her about what flowers they had suitable for a boyfriend. She raised her eyebrows at me but I ignored it, I needed those damn flowers. I heard a group of four 20 to 24 year olds in the back of the store now watching me. I heard one of them, the oldest and one in charge call me a fag. Again I ignored it, only one of them had a job, the youngest. Mechanic apprentaship, I could see the new layer of grease staining his hands. He was nervous, obviously didn't want to cause any dramas. The clerk returned to the bench holding the flowers I had been searching for. "These are Gerbera's. It's all we have." She dumped them on the counter. "That's the ones I have seen him with." I paid the lady and left the store knowing full well the four guys where following me. I was about to hail a cab when the older one called out to me. "Hey fag!" I turned to face them. The younger one definitely didn't want to be involved. "Come on Josh, let's leave him alone." The youngest grabbed the eldest arm. "What Damo, you feel for this fag?" The boy shook his head.
"Thank you doctor." The Omega gave a weak smile as Watson left the room, even as he sat on his bunk that night something about the Omega got stuck in his head. Deciding he would visit her again tomorrow he was finally able to sleep.
"Sherlock." I knocked on the door. "John?" He questioned. "Yeah." I answered. He didn't reply. "Sherlock, I'm sorry, please let me in." I begged at the door. Sherlock let me in his room, it was completely trashed. Cupboards and draws completely ripped part, the contends on the floor. I noticed smoked cigarette's squashed in a makeshift ash tray and a torque on the bedside draws. "Sherlock!" I was stunned. I grabbed his wrists and pulled up his sleeves on both arms. Thank god no needle sticks, well not recent ones, he had trashed his old room looking for his old drug stashes and only found some old cigarettes. Shit, I had done this to him. "Sherlock I'm sorry. I thought you were, I don't know, playing with me." Sherlock said nothing, I grabbed his collar and pulled him into a hug. "Your my best friend, if you want to experiment then thats fine." I pulled away and smiled at him, a genuine smile so he knew I was serious. "Come on, lets go home before Mycroft try's to have me killed." I joked. I had never seen him like this before, I now know why Mycroft came for me. As much as I said it as a joke that he would have me killed I'm not confident that it was if I had reacted diffrently. I took Sherlock home to Baker street, sat him on the couch and made him some tea. I handed him a cup as I sat next to him on the couch with my own. Sherlock was thinking so I let him as I silently sipped my tea. I realised I hadn't updated the blog about the recent case, I wasn't even 100% sure what to write but I knew I had to write something. I mean murdered just for been gay, it had to stop. I put my hands either side of me to push myself off the couch when suddenly Sherlocks thin hand covered mine. At first just on top but then he gently slid his fingers between mine. I opened my fingers wide as I could so he could slide them between. I carefully looked at him, his eyes still closed. I lent back into the couch and gently wrapped my fingers around his. A small smirk played at the edges of his lips. I figured we were just going to have to do this Sherlock's way, strange enough I didn't mind. I lent my head back and closed my eyes, gees I was tired.
The Apex was completely what you would expect of a high class Alpha club, dark masculine and everything with a silver lining including the Omega staff. Their skimpy tight black outfits all lined with silver cord, including a silver cord choker around their necks. ‘I can’t believe they haven’t shut this joint down, it’s degrading and I’m an Alpha.’ John huffed watching a barely legal Omega get groped by an Alpha at least three times older then the Omega. ‘This is what happens when one group holds the majority of the wealth.’ Sherlock whispered into John’s ear, the chocolate baritone making a shiver go down his spine. ‘Let’s go.’ Sherlock stood tall, shoulders back and nose in the air just like any high bred Alpha making John chuckle lightly as he and the Major followed. After strutting through a few doors like he owned the place Sherlock spotted his prey and stalked right up to the short weedy Alpha who was watching a topless female Omega dance. ‘Mr Holmes!’ The Alpha fell out of his seat in shock. ‘What are you doin here, it ain’t safe.’ The Alpha frantically looking around if he was about to get jumped. ‘I need information.’ Sherlock stared the Alpha down as the Major took Sherlock’s left and John took his right flank. ‘Ok, but not ere’.’ The Alpha ushered the three of them into a storage room. ‘What and make it quick.’ The Alpha muttered once the door was closed. Sherlock glared at the Alpha making him twitch even more. ‘I want to know if anyone is bragging, something new?’ The Alpha looked towards the Major taking a quick sniff and at John before answering Sherlock’s question. ‘He ain’t new, the Baron Steal. He is saying the Heat Spray is old school. He’s been recruiting young strong Omega’s instead of just the pretty ones but just storing them.’ John growled at the implication that Omega’s were property. ‘Look Mr Holmes, tonight is not a good night for you to be ere’ ya know what I mean.’ The Alpha checked his watch again getting more and more twitchy. Sherlock glared at the Alpha. ‘They put it in the air ducts, just enough to get under their skin and ya know relax.’ Sherlock suddenly turned grabbing John’s wrist and storming out. Sherlock looked at his phone. ‘It’s 10:55pm, they will do it on the hour, we have five minutes.’ Sherlock continued to drag John through the back rooms of the club with the Major keeping tight on their tail. Suddenly they were back in a dark storage room. ‘Sherlock, what the buggering hell are you doing?’ John growled as he accidentally stood on his foot. The light in Sherlock’s phone suddenly lit his face up, Sherlock was flashing John a childish grin as he pulled a ladder from what looked like thin air. ‘Shall we?’ Sherlock swished his coat as he started to climb John and the Major following. After pushing through a trap door they entered the ventilation control room. John quickly pulled out his Sig making the Major follow suit pulling her weapon out. ‘If we can find it then we can prove it!’ Sherlock muttered happily. ‘Find What Sherlock?’ John hissed as Sherlock ducked down the rows of Ventilation, John and the Major dashed after him watching out for people. ‘Found it!’ Sherlock called out followed by a gun shot. ‘Oi! What ya doin up ere’ ya bastards! The boss will have my head if he finds out.’ A huge Alpha looking guard was heading towards them gun drawn. ‘Sherlock lets go!!’ John hissed at his friend. ‘I need evidence!’ Sherlock hissed back taking a photo with his phone, the flash giving away their hiding spot. ‘Ya bastards! Give me that camera!’ The guard shouted again popping off a few more warning shots hitting one of the tubes Sherlock was taking a photo off. A spray of liquid covered all three of them as John grabbed the back of Sherlock’s coat and took a run for it. Heading back the way the guard came finding an exit, the three of them dashed down the stairs through a service hallway and out an emergency exit landing in a back alley. They continued through the back alleys until they were sure they hadn’t been followed. The Major and John both glared at Sherlock who for once actually looked like a regretful wet cat, there was nothing for it now as John called Lestrade informing him where they were and the fact they were covered in Heat Spray and needed to be decontaminated. The decontamination team set up right in the alley, all three of them where completely silent as they were stripped and decontaminated, Sherlock wasn't able to miss the fact that the Major had more scars then John. The stories he could read from the marks on her skin but he kept his mouth shut even as one of the technicians tisked.
Sherlock POV
"Actually I thought you would be older, you saved a lot of POWs. Many of those men wouldn't have survived much longer in that POW camp. The American's are trying to get you down for a medal." The Major relaxed slightly.
"You!" The civilian snarled at him just as he set foot in her room. "I shall have you court marshalled for disobeying a direct order!" She winched in pain as she tried to sit up to berate Watson further.
John POV
John Watson dropped to his knees in the sand beside a stretcher, a couple of things registered in his mind. His patient was a cilvian, female, omega dressed some what like a James Bond Villainess in tight black clothes & a gun with a silencer strapped to each thigh. Right now however the most important detail was the hand full of Army issue blood stained gauze she was holding to her stomach. Watson quickly lifted the gauze to assess, bullet to the abdo. One of her blood stained hands suddenly had a fist full of his shirt and pulled his face closer to hers.

Months later
It was the most awkward dinner I had ever been too, Sherlock and Mycroft had barely looked at either Greg or I since leaving their father's office. Something was wrong. I was still getting into my head that Mycroft and Greg were dating, I had no idea. The tension was suffocating as Sherlock's parents sat beside Greg and I who sat across from Sherlock and Mycroft with Sherlock's grandfather at the head of the table and his wife to his left. Thankfully his grandparents had focused on Sherlock's parents for the evening, discussing news and business until after entrées, dinner finally arrived and Sherlock's grandfather turned to Mycroft. "So Mycroft when are you going to carry on the family name?" Mycroft almost chocked on his broad bean. "Well." He answered. For the first time ever I saw Mycroft flounder. "Mycroft and I haven't discussed children." Greg suddenly commented causing everyone to stare at him as he didn't look away from his plate. "William, are you aware of this?" Sherlock's grandfather addressed his son. "Yes." He replied casually. "And I suppose your going to tell me the good doctor here and Sherlock are together as well." Sherlock's grandfather proposed scarastically. "That's right. " Sherlock's father replied not even looking up from his plate. "William that is not the Holmes way, what about the marriages you have arranged?" Sherlock's grandmother finally joined the conversation as Mycroft and Sherlock suddenly looked at Greg and I. "Arranged marriages?" Greg and I repeated shocked in unison. "The boys have made their decisions." Sherlock's father replied still casual as you please. "Some cop and a military reject!" Sherlock's grandmother pointed to Greg and I. "How dare you talk to John like that, he was shot defending this country!" Sherlock was suddenly on his feet glaring at his grandparents, anger just radiating from him. "Mycroft take the boys outside." Sherlock's mother ordered. Mycroft gestured we follow as he dragged Sherlock outside. "You never told me your marriage was to be arranged." Greg questioned Mycroft looking extremely hurt. "I'm sorry Greg, I wasn't sure how to broach the subject. My father has decided to call off the arranged marriages under one condition. One of us has to have a biological child to carry on the family name." We all kind of looked at each other. Mycroft stood in front of Greg. "I'm the eldest." He started looking into Greg's eyes. "Greg, I, I have to do this." Mycroft couldn't look at Greg any longer, we all realised he was breaking up with him. "Mycroft, you don't have to do this!" I suddenly found my voice. "What!" Sherlock looks at me in horror. "I read an article only just last week a baby was born with three genetic parents, two fathers and a mother." I explained "We could do that" Greg was pleading with Mycroft, Mycroft pulled Greg into him as I felt Sherlock's hand intertwine with mine. We could hear the shouting match between the remaining Holmes, it was extremely bizarre listening to two men shouting with no emotion on your future. Sherlock's father defending his decision that none of them could choose a suitable male partner for the boys yet Sherlock's grandfather defending the family tradition and the possible shame two homosexual boys could bring on the family only for Sherlock's mother's frustrated voice defending homosexuality. Eventually Sherlock's grandfather seemed to have had enough and decide to leave, before we could rejoin the table the oldest of the Holmes family had left without a goodbye. The waiters had brought fresh food back in for the remaining 6 as we began to eat again. "Greg and I are going to the IVF clinic tomorrow to start the proceedings of having a child using our DNA." Mycroft announced as if mentioning the weather. "Are they able to do that now." Sherlock's mother asked innocently. "Yes." Mycroft answered just as casual. "Well that's good news." His father replied casually yet looking extremely relieved. The tension had lifted slightly but conversation was hard, I think everyone was relieved when it was finally acceptable for us to leave.
John POV
Sherlock suddenly jumped off the couch, making me jump. "We have to go to Scotland Yard." He ripped on his coat and headed out the door, I was able to catch up with him as he jumped into a cab. He filleted threw the paperwork in his hands muttering away. I couldn't help but smirk while I tried to catch my breath. The way his mind worked fascinated and confused me. "They are linked" Sherlock spread a couple of case files across Lastrades desk. "Linked" he replied looking at them, recognising most of them. "How are they linked?" He asked not seeing the link himself. "I worked it out after..." Sherlock trailed off and started to blush, he was blushing! "Never mind. They are homophobic crimes, three involved, it started with these bashings and has progressed, the murders are all right handed, strong, same shape hand bruises as in they do/ did the same occupation and all the victims have associations with the Glitter Bar and the mechanic shop. One of them is missing a finger on the left hand" Lestrade looked at Sherlock not quite following. "Shay had been at the Glitter Bar with Liz the night of the murder after dropping her car at the mechanic shop. The transgender, a regular at the Glitter bar and had submitted a grievance against the same mechanic shop for sexual harassment." Sherlock pointed to a couple more cases outlining their connection before pulling out a picture from his coat. "These four work for or hang out at the mechanic shop and are the four who beat me up all but one is right handed. The left handed one is the youngest and didn't actually touch me where is the other three..." Sherlock trailed off and handed Lestrade the picture after flicking his eyes at me. "You hadn't reported it." Lestrade commented rather then questioned. "No I haven't." Sherlock added. "Any particular reason why?" Lestrade knew he was on delicate ground. Sherlock looked at me. "Greg's pretty much a friend." I shrugged giving Sherlock permission to tell. "They beat me up because I was buying flowers for John." Sherlock admitted. Lestrade looked up from the photo looking at Sherlock then me to see if we were serious. "About time." He shrugged. "I'll investigate the mechanic shop and the bar and let you know." Lestrade replied, with that Sherlock grabbed my hand and lead me out of Scotland Yard. "Sherlock." I asked as we walked down an empty corridor. "Yes." He replied "if they have moved from beating people to murdering people, how come they only beat you up?" I asked nervously. "They were interrupted." Sherlock answered quickly. I wondered if that was what the radiologist meant when he said Sherlock was lucky it wasn't worse.
It was my day off thankfully so I pulled out my laptop to work on the blog. I had heard Sherlock head out "back soon" he smiled at me almost shyly. "Ok." I smiled back still kinda stunned about what had happened this morning. I worked pretty solidly that I forgot to eat lunch and it wasn't until my stomach groaned that I realised and looked at the time. Shit I thought as I noticed the sun sinking out the window. Wait Sherlock's not home yet either. I pulled out my phone trying not to panic, I mean he wouldn't leave after this morning would he. He wouldn't have gone looking for drugs. Omg what have I done. I started to panic more and more as my hand shook I texted him.
Outside - SH
That night I had another nightmare, well flash back really. I was back in grade six, my father towering over me. He was calling me a fag and punched me in the face again. I tried to tell him I wasn't, I just enjoyed playing the piano. He grabbed me by the collar and said no son of his was a homo and I was to drop the piano and join the football team. I could smell his alcoholic breath as he threw me on the floor and started kicking me. I was begging him to stop, then he did. It was strange I could hear the violin playing, my father disappeared as the music calmed me and I went back to sleep. The next day Sherlock was no where to be seen and his violin hadn't been touched. I felt tired but I had a shower, got dressed and headed off to work. That night I lay in bed staring at the ceiling as Sherlock played various songs on his violin but none of them was the song I heard in my sleep. I was been silly, I rolled over and it wasn't long before I was asleep.
I really wish I didn't have to put John threw this but I knew the concequeses of either of us not coming. John kept reassuring me it's just dinner, what can go wrong over dinner. This is a Holmes dinner, everything can go wrong at a Holmes dinner. I was pacing the lounge room with my tie over my shoulders but the rest of my suit on when John finally emerged from his room. He was saying something while fighting with his tie but, he was different. I had seen John before I had seen the suit before, we picked it out together but. I didn't know what to say, emotion, all I knew for sure was something in my pants was getting tighter and I had a lump in my throat I tried to swallow. "What, does it look stupid, I look stupid don't I!" John huffed. "No John, no. It's perfect." I regained myself and did his tie for him. "One would think you would have learnt to do your tie by now." I raised an eyebrow at him. "Shut up Sherlock." He snapped back. John was nervous too as he tried not to rub his sweaty palms on his new trousers. I slid my hand into his in the back of the cab. John was kind enough not to say anything as the cab pulled into my parents house. I vaguely remember the first time he was here, it wasn't pleasant. We both slid out of the cab, I straighten John's tie as he ran his hand down my scarf. He the took a deep breath and we headed to the front door. My mother was the first to greet us. "Oh Sherlock." She smiled as she looked over me before giving me an awkward hug. "This must be Dr Watson." She turned her gaze to John, analysing everything about him. "I would think a doctor wouldn't have so many bruises Dr Watson." She asked him suspiciously. "He was helping me with a case mother." I butted in before John was able to come up with a lie or worse the truth. She looked at both of us and pieced it together herself. "Mycroft is already here with Detective Inspector Lestrade." John and I exchanged confused glances just as the two joined us in the foyer. "Mycroft, Sherlock, my study." My fathers voice called down the stairs. I looked at John apologicticly not really wanting to leave him with my mother. Mycroft and I climbed the stairs to my fathers study. My fathers desire for social formalities was worse then Mycroft's as he waited until we were seated in front of his huge desk. He looked out the window that looked out over the front of the house, then dramatically dropping the curtain to face us. "I'm announcing to my parents that I'm not arranging your marriages." My father waited for our reactions, Mycroft was the first to answer. "Does this mean you approve of our choices?" My father looked from Mycroft to me. "A Detective Inspector and a doctor, you could have made worse decisions. Much worse, I would have preferred better family standings however I'm not going to pretend that I understand your, lifestyle choices. My mother's suggestions are obviously not going to work and having no understanding of what you would desire from a suitable suggestion I believe allowing you to make your own decisions to be the most fruitful solution." Mycroft nodded. "There is however the matter of the family name, one of you will need to work out how to continue the family line without comprising the genetics." My father looked between us. "So you want one of us to have biological children." I looked at him getting a little pissed at the situation he was putting us in. "Precisely Sherlock." He answered me wondering back over to the window. He pulled himself up straighter which means my grandparents had just pulled up. "Down stairs now." He instructed still looking out the window. This was my father been nervous. Mycroft and I started down the stairs, "Are you coming out brother?" I smirked at Mycroft. "Leave it brother." Mycroft tried to ignore me. "Two years is a long time to make him wait." I teased. "At least I didn't make Greg squirm." Mycroft bit back.
"Missed everything again." Watson murmured at one stage desperately ignoring the sweet smell of honey wrapping around him from under the smell of gun powder,  disinfected and blood. Knowing she was hours from her heat Watson double stitched the wound so she couldn't tear it open during her heat and wrapped it a little more secure then he normally would. "Done." Watson gave the Omega a reassuring smile.
Murder
"Hey, this is a war zone, people die. What possessed you to use nurses in a recovering mission is beyond me but you saved a lot of lives." Watson felt his Alpha side wanting to sooth the agitated Omega.
"Can't blame the young lads, if I was half my age I would be putting my offer in too." James laughed back gesturing to an array of offers on his side bench obviously for the Omega.
9 years later.
Sherlock POV
I could feel someone staring at me, I moved uncomfortably in my seat. I hated the trains, reminded me of trucks we would get crammed into in Afghanistan, at least this time I didn't have full combat gear on. I quickly looked up from my paper to the eyes I could feel on me, expecting some drunk weirdo. I was kinda confused as a set of steal eyes were set on me framed with a thick head of dark curls and a pale face. He wasn't been creepy but I don't know, he was just looking curiously I guess. He didn't seem harmful so I took a breath and went back to my paper. I could still feel his eyes on me, I remembered the large bruise on my cheek was on that side of my face. My eyes flicked to my arm to make sure the scars weren't visible, my long sleeve shirt hid them. I reminded myself people could only see the bruise on my face, they couldn't see the rest. Thankfully it was my stop next so I folded up my paper which I hadn't actually read much of, ready to get off at the next stop. In the hustle and bustle of London I pushed the guy on train out of my mind, I checked my phone it was Baker St, 221B Baker St. I checked the maps on my phone, damn I had taken a left turn instead of a right turn. I walked back down the street and finally found the place. I was about to knock when a familiar feeling of been watched came across me, I turned to stare straight into the same eyes from the train. This time I realised how tall and thin he was but there was something about those eyes, like he was taking in my every detail in some child like fascination. Suddenly they turned to annoyance and I realised he had asked me a question. "Sorry." I mumbled. "Your John Watson." He stated. "Yes and you are?" I asked trying not to be slightly creeped out. "Sherlock Holmes." He simply answered. Oh shit, I thought, this is the guy who is after a flat mate, the guy I have some to see.
"I requested you." Her voice sweetly replied. Watson nodded and grabbed the phone of the wall beside the door, gently giving orders over the phone for a Beta or Omega nurse, a Heat Room to be prepared and the corridor to be monitored. Once the Beta nurse turned up the room was silent as they worked, Watson checked the X-ray before pulling the knife out and sewing the hole up.
Jumper
"Treat my team and the POWs first." The patient demanded threw clenched teeth.
It was two months later when Watson was wondering down the hospital corridors that he had been temporary assigned too when he heard Murry's voice. "I can make you feel good." The desperation evident in the Alpha's voice.
John's POV
"No, she was my patient and I have a duty to my patients James, you know that. Probably a good thing they got her out of here, the conversations in post op she'd be bonded before I could discharge her." John laughed softly shaking his head.
The Holmes Dinner.
"Captain." He answered from his desk as Watson closed his door.
Bait.
It was school holidays, I had a day shift at the clinic and unwisely left Molly with Sherlock for the day. Sherlock had been drug free since her birth, it wasn't an easy road but we made it. I grabbed some milk and bread on the way home but amazingly when I opened the door to Bakers St Molly was happily playing the violin with her father. It made my heart swell watching the two of them play together. Molly had Sherlock's musician talent, black curls and his unshakeable eyes yet she had my nose and my open compassion for people. It didn't stop her from imitating her father however especially when she was on cases with us. She flashed me one of her signature smiles as she kept playing. I headed to the kitchen to put the milk away but as I opened the door the shock made me drop it and it smashed at my feet. "Sherlock!" I practically screamed. I turned to find both Sherlock and Molly staring at me so I quickly slammed the fridge door shut. "Go back to your playing Molly." I got her out of the kitchen grabbing Sherlock and pulling him further into the kitchen. "Sherlock there is a vagina in the fridge. Why is there a vagina in the fridge?" I asked trying to keep my voice down. "Don't worry it's not for you." Sherlock answered casually. "It's for Molly." I stared at him. "Sherlock you can't buy a vagina for an eight year old!" I replied frustrated "She wanted to know why we have a penis and she doesn't. So I got her a vagina to look at. She also wanted to know where babies come from so when it thaws I was going to show her." Sherlock answered like it was obvious. I pinched the top of my nose. "You got Molly a real cadavers vagina so you could explain the birds and the bees to her." I tried to clarify in my mind. "Yes." Sherlock answered unsure of what the problem was. "Are you going to add the bit where you made her from our sperm and a donated egg without telling me so you could surprise me on our honeymoon?" Sherlock looked at me with his unshakeable eyes "Ok, ok, get me the mop." I gave up, I used the time it took to clean the milk up to work out a plan, as I put the mop away I called out to Molly. "Yeah papa." She bounced into the lounge room. "Come sit on my lap we need to talk." I sat on the couch as she jumped on my knee. "Ok, Molly, so you know how we can't talk about cases until they have cleared court." I explained. "Yes, because a breach of confidentiality can effect the judgement of a court and the perpetrator can use Pre-Trial Publicity as a reason to have the case thrown out of court or move venue." Molly looked at me curious to the next amount of information I was about to give her. "Um, yes, well, the cadaver that your daddy got you needs to stay confidential too." I explained. "But daddy said anatomy was important to learn and we should at least try and educate the idiots at my school." I glared at Sherlock who was standing in the door way proud as punch. "Molly, sweety, most people don't see cadavers until they are in medical school and I know no one at your school has been to medical school. They wouldn't understand if you try and tell them about this." Molly looked at me just like her father does storing the information in to her mind palace. "But who is going to teach them?" She asked. "It's up to their parents to teach them about anatomy." I explained. "But Frankie doesn't have parents." Molly was suddenly worried about her friend. "I'm sure someone from the Department will tell Frankie." I reassured her remembering her friend was a ward of the state. "Ok." She smiled brightly happy with my explanation. "How about you go play now." I suggested. Molly smiled at me and run off to her room to play. I let out a long sigh and put my face in my hands closing my eyes. I swear Sherlock will be the death of me I thought. Two long slender hands slid down my shoulders followed by a familiar face rubbing up against my cheek and Sherlock's curls bounced in my face. He started to kiss my neck and rub my shoulders and chest. It eased the stress out of my body. "Your still in trouble." I murmured, Sherlock pulled away and I missed his touch instantly, opening my eyes he knelt between my knees on the floor. Omg his eyes, I just couldn't pull myself away from them. He started to kiss me and rub his hand against me threw my trousers, I buried my hands in his curls. "Bedroom now." I demanded and I swear I saw a cheeky grin flash across his face. It wasn't long before I was biting his shoulder so I didn't cry out in pleasure as he climaxed in me and I climax over his hand. Sherlock grabbed the baby wipes beside the bed to clean us both up, I was exhausted but happy spread out naked on the bed. Once clean Sherlock knelt over me on his hands and knees smiling at me. "Your still in trouble." I tried to keep my face looking serious. Then Sherlock had that look on his face only one person can produce. "Daddies, Uncle Mycroft and Uncle Greg are here." Molly called from her room. "Don't ask him about his diet!" I called back as we quickly got up and threw clothes on. We opened the bedroom door in time for Molly to ask Mycroft "How's your diet Uncle Mycroft?" I quickly grabbed Molly's hand. "Let's go make some tea." I pulled her out of the lounge room as Sherlock took up his arm chair I heard him ask Mycroft if he wanted some cake.
The next day John had a morning shift, "I'll see you this afternoon. It might be a good idea if you tidied a little too. This place is really messy." he smiled at me, the one smile he has just for me. Normally when he is calling me an idiot. I looked up at him and nodded. I watched him put his coat on and head out. I know it was only for a couple of hours but I knew I was going to miss him. I looked back at the TV, I don't even know why I have it on, a distraction I suppose. Just as I decided to turn it off the morning news came on with me and John holding hands walking into The Glitter Bar with 'Gays investigate Gay murder' splashed across the screen. It's out and with the murders still out there and they would remember my face. What if they target John next.
Meeting Sherlock Holmes
John POV
"Sorry, I don't take orders from civilians besides Triage works on how injured you are not your rank." Watson answered with his Captain Watson stance. The civilian glared at him as he checked her chart. "Major Annabel Franks." Watson looked confused. "Wait your Major Franks, the one running the mission the post op ward hasn't stopped talking about you." Watson looked at his patient again only to receive an even darker look.
'You sent an Omega to investigate an Omega prostatution ring?' John glared at the major. 'Aurora has been the Alpha Lady Castle for months now and she has been doing a good job of it too. Elitist fucking Alpha's, they treat Omega's like objects. Aurora was getting close.' The major huffed. 'So where are we going?' The Major asked Sherlock as they climbed into the car. 'The Apex.' Sherlock answered watching the Major. 'The Alpha only club, what do you want me to do.' John pulled the Beta patch off his lower back as the Major handed him a sharps bin. 'All three of us are going.' Sherlock announced still watching the Major. 'You are as bad as your brother, put the nose filters in first.' The Major handed them a nose piece each. 'Christ I haven't seen one like this before.' John commented as he pushed it up his nose, 'These aren't going to get you and Sherlock in however.' The Major rolled her eyes. 'The military grade ones are for Alpha's to not go into Rut if sprayed with a Heat spray. These are specialists ones, those working in close contact with Heat spray and Rut inducer.' Sherlock rattled off. 'The Major has Alpha patches for me.' Sherlock gave her a knowing smirk. 'Like I said as bad as your brother, put the nose filter in first. Even your brother had trouble with the scent change in close range.' The Major watched until Sherlock has put the filter in his nose before presenting him with a patch and putting one on herself. Slowly the car filled with a natural scent of three Alpha's. The Major changed her shirt after pulling some clothes from a hidden compartment under her car seat not even considering she was shirtless in front of Sherlock and John. While John was still somewhat distracted both the Major and Sherlock looked over him. "Ditch the old man jumper and that plat shirt, I should have something that's going to work." The Major dug around the hidden compartment until she found a black silk button up shirt. "Try this." She threw it at John as Sherlock was holding his clothes but watching the Major. "What, last time I saw John he was in CAM pants and a tight singlet." The Major snapped at Sherlock. "This is quite tight." John glared at the Major. "It's perfect." Sherlock murmured. Both John and the Major looked at him, Sherlock huffed. "For the club! You have to look the part!"
A couple weeks later, Sherlock was hanging around Baker Street waiting for John to come home from the surgery. They had had a row the day before about Sherlock smoking while still wearing the nicotine patches John had bought him and John had gone around paying everyone in the neighborhood if they agreed not to sell Sherlock any cigarettes. His concern over Sherlock was really very maddening sometimes. Especially since he basically refused to touch him ever since John' little episode last week. They had been lying in Sherlock's bed, snogging, which is as far as they had gotten and had really only done a few times. John seemed to understand immediately that if Sherlock was working, the last thing he would be interested in was anything physical. But when they did have these little sessions, they went at it rather hard. John was learning that Sherlock liked him to be a bit aggressive. He would bite and nip and suck at Sherlock's lips and Sherlock would take it, basically in shock, while moaning and trying to grow accustomed to the tightening in his groin. During one of these such nights, Sherlock gained what could only be described as a raging hard-on and thrust it against John's leg. John instinctively reached down and when he did, he suddenly jerked his hand back and pulled away from Sherlock. "I'm sorry!" Sherlock said, though he wasn't sure exactly why. Did he do something wrong? "Its okay..its just, umm...your...shit. I'm sorry." John got up and went upstairs to take a shower. As he jogged up the stairs he ran a hand through his hair and muttered a curse or two. He hadn't meant to freak out like that. He'd been so caught up in the moment, when he reached down and felt Sherlock's dick it startled him. He didn't think he'd been expecting a twat but he wasn't entirely expecting a cock. John Watson what the hell is wrong with you? he thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
He withdrew his fingers, grabbed Sherlock's thigh and threw it over his hip, and plunged back inside, perhaps a bit roughly. Sherlock didn't seem to mind at all. He groaned as John sped up the thrusting of his hand and the thrusting of his hips. Then John crooked his fingers and Sherlock bit down on his neck. "Jesus, what the fuck is that?!" John almost, almost, fell out of his trance at that. He had never heard Sherlock say fuck. Leave it to the guy who didn't know Pluto wasn't a planet to not know he had a prostate, or what it can do.
Damn that John Watson! he thought as he stormed down the sidewalk. Who does he think he is? He has no business coming into my room and undressing me! A blush crept its way up his neck and face as he pictured John doing just that. He shook the image from his head and kept internally raging. The chemicals I inject into my body are none of his concern! Although, that's just his being loyal and caring. Why does he have to be so bloody loyal and caring?! He's like a puppy. A sweet puppy with big, kind eyes. Stop it! Where did that come from? God! I could really go for a taste.
"Do you like that?" John knew better than to give the honest answer too quickly. But he didn't really know how to say it properly so he went with "Sometimes." Sherlock looked like he was deeply disappointed in John as a person and tried to push away from him but John held on, wrapping his ankle around Sherlock's foot for a stronger hold. "Now wait just a minute, let me explain." "You don't have to. Its fine. You can't help what you like. I just don't think I can have a part in it." "Sherlock, Jesus, will you listen? Its not like that. Look, sometimes...sometimes people get horny. For no reason whatsoever, they just get horny. And they don't always have someone to help them with that. So they watch porn and they masturbate. But...but its not always easy to get hard, or to get off, without another human being. So...porn tends to be a bit more intense. And, I don't much like admitting it, but sometimes, yeah, seeing a girl get slapped with a cock or hearing her talk about how his cock is so big it hurts but she loves it...it helps intensify things so that you can cum. Don't give me that look just because you're such a a bloody genius you don't need to drain the sack every once in a while. I don't want anything of the sort with you and most people never do anything like that in real life. I have no desire to cockslap you, degrade you, and I certainly never want to hurt you. Do you believe me?" "I was under the impression pain was inevitable." "I don't know if that's true. But, if it worries you, I'll go first. Do you believe that I'll never do those things to you?" "Your heart rate says you're telling the truth." "I'm gonna accept that, because I want to snog you again, but next time I ask you to believe me, I want you to do it because you trust me."
A few hours later, John awoke with a start. He had been dreaming about Sherlock. He was on his hands and knees on John's bed, and John was bringing him off with just his fingers inside him.
John walked into the flat to see Sherlock exactly where he left him. No surprise there. He tossed the bag of blackout candles and lube behind his chair. Best not to just wave that around. He held the cigarettes with a little blue bow behind his back, stood in front of Sherlock, and handed them over with a flourish.
He looked over and saw Sherlock. He was sitting up in bed watching John, his hand sliding slowly up and down his shaft. "Jesus, Sherlock," John whispered.
John winced. It was a bit more than he was expecting. Sherlock may have had long soft fingers but they were thicker than they looked, he realized now. The digit currently inside him was stretching him slowly, in and out, working it's way to the knuckle. He realized now he'd been a bit rougher and less patient with Sherlock and wondered if he had hurt him. He pulled back from their relentless kiss and looked at his lover. He was watching John with awe as he pressed and pressed inside him, so gently. John grunted and let his head fall down onto Sherlock's chest, where he used his other hand to caress his hair. John just clung to him. Sherlock withdrew his finger, added more lube, and went in with a second. John arched suddenly and pulled away. That had a bit of a sting. "I'm sorry!" Sherlock said immediately, sitting up and letting John slide from his lap onto the bed. John lay in the bed and laughed. "Why are you laughing at me?" Sherlock asked, but he was smiling, too. "For all my talk of going slowly and being gentle with you and not wanting to frighten you off, here I am pulling faces every time you touch me!" John said and he laughed again. "So the pain is inevitable, then," Sherlock said stonily. John sobered at that. "Oh Sherlock," he said, and he reached for him. Sherlock lay down next to John and draped his arm over his stomach. His erection was waning again but John was still hard as a rock. "It's our first time. It was going swimmingly until now, and there were bound to be some hiccups. We have all the time in the world to get the hang of it. And we have a few hours before I have to be at work. I think we can manage to find the time to get your cock in me by then." He looked at Sherlock and waggled his eyebrows.
Later that night, Sherlock lay in his bed thinking about the day's events.  He went over his conversation with John again and again. So, the Great Sherlock Holmes had a heart after all.  Maybe Moriarty had seen it.  Maybe that's why he picked John as his last target in the bomb game.  Maybe that's what he was referring to when he told Sherlock he would burn the heart out of him. He would burn John. How had this happened? How had Sherlock gone and fallen in love? These sorts of things had never made sense to him before. He knew that he was strange because of this. He knew it meant there was something wrong with him and there were times when he wished he could be normal if only so that people would stop looking at him like he was a robot or so that people like Sally Donovan would stop calling him freak. Yes, he pretended not to care what they said but deep down, it got to him. Why couldn't he care for people? Now he knew. Because he had never met anyone like John Watson.
Sherlock and John have a little chat about what's going on between them and what might go on later.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and went to stomp off to his room. "Wait!" John said, a little louder than intended.
Sherlock's eyes popped open suddenly and with a growl he rolled over, not removing John's hand, and began to thoroughly snog him. As he licked inside John's mouth, swallowed his moans, and swore to never let John pleasure him without total reciprocation ever again, he took hold of John through his own pants, a pair of red briefs that hugged his bum very nicely, now that Sherlock thought on it. At the very first touch, John moaned and curled himself tighter to Sherlock and said "Jesus Christ."
John pulled off his shirt and reached for Sherlock's, who clearly hesitated. He really enjoyed seeing John without a shirt. He was soft and tan but clearly had well defined muscles under just a little fat. Obviously a side effect of leaving the Army but still getting a bit of excercise. Sherlock felt too lean, too bony. Also, the skin to skin contact was a bit much for him. He liked to touch John with his hands but all that rubbing of skin...it felt odd to him. John saw the heistation and let it be. He kissed Sherlock again and without breaking away settled himself in Sherlock's lap. This was another favorite way of kissing for him, but really, he just liked kissing in general. Usually, though, he was the one being straddled. It usually worked better that way for the girl to grind into him instead of him sort of grinding into her stomach. All these thoughts about grinding brought John back to reality and he realized that he'd acquired quite the hard on. He broke the kiss and took Sherlock's hand. He put it on his thigh and slowly slid it to his groin, slowly so that Sherlock would know where he was headed and maybe wouldn't push John onto the floor or run away as John had. He pressed Sherlock's palm to his hardness and looked up at him. "I want you to remember this. The first time you made me hard." Sherlock pressed on it harder and kissed John roughly and quickly. "I think we'll both remember the first time YOU made ME hard." John pulled both their hands away and said "I'm sorry about that. That wasn't fair. I...I freaked out a little." "I know. It was obvious." "Yeah well...I don't really have an excuse. I...I'm new to this." "You aren't the only one." "Yeah...that freaks me out, too, though. I've never been with a man and I've never been with a virgin. I don't know what the hell I'm doing and you don't know what the hell you're doing so...I guess we're just gonna have to work out the schematics together?" "Or you could let me watch porn and I could..." "No! Sherlock, no porn." "Why? It's basically a how-to." "Its a 'how to freak Sherlock out and make him go back to life long celibacy.' No. Sod this. I'll handle it." John climbed off Sherlock and put on his shirt, grabbed his keys and walked out the door. Sherlock was rather dumbfounded.
"I'll get a Beta or Omega doctor or nurse for you." Watson answered her stare as he slowly retreated out the door.
"You think an Omega can't run a mission." Her voice deadly.
Flowers
"Satisfied?" James asked the dark corner of his office. "Very." The sweet Omega voice replied.
-sex scene-
"Yes, yes of course." Murry answered before running off. Franks now looked at Watson.
"You work for my brother so you can tell him to just piss off." I snapped
Nightmares.
-sex scene-
"No wait John, I want you to do it." Watson stared at her in amazement as she chuckled and pointed her gun to her thigh.
"Beta." I answered as John answered
John Hamish Watson
"Omega." I looked at him confused, I took a deep sniff. Honey, gun powder, gun oil and Beta. She smiled at our confusion.
"Bloody Americans and their medals, I'm sure my commanding officer can veto it." She huffed.
"Thanks Mrs H!" John called back. On opening the door a woman stood in the living room facing us in a Naval uniform, she wasn't used to wearing. "Major Franks?" John froze if the woman was a ghost from his past.
"Better add these to the collection then." John replied pulling the offers out of his white coat. James and John shared a nod as John left his office.
Family
Missing
I automatically answered my phone as I was reading through all the comments on the blog. "John!" Harry called down the phone excitedly. "Hi Harry..." I replied before she interrupted "is it true!" I could hear in her voice she was almost busting. I huffed. "Is what true?" I looked up to see Sherlock stroll past me nakedly, I shook my head and ignored him. "Are you and Sherlock a thing?" Her voice experated. "Yeah Harry it's true." I answered. "OMG! I knew it!" She breathed down the phone. "Wait, what are you to tell dad? He hit the roof when he found out I was a lesbian, he is going to." Her voice stopped. "I know Harry, he is going to go crazy." An awkward silence developed. "You don't have to come to my birthday party." Harry suddenly spoke. "Wait of course I'm coming, it's at the park, in public. He isn't going to do anything in public." She was silent again. "Harry he might not even know yet, it will be fine. I'll see you tomorrow ok." After a couple of seconds "ok John, be careful. Bye." "Bye Harry." I replied. I was nervous, I'm not going to lie. I kept reassuring myself he probably doesn't know. I grabbed Harry's wrapped present off the table and called out to Sherlock. He came out of his room completely dressed and grabbed his coat. "Let's go." He replied. "Your coming with me?" I looked at him confused. "I'm not letting you go face your father by yourself." Sherlock looked at me like it was final. "You sure?" I asked my voice shook. "I'm sure." Sherlock gave me a quick hug before pulling me out of the unit. It started fine, my father glared at me and Sherlock. "He knows." Sherlock whispered in my ear which only made my father fume and skull his beer. My father said nothing the whole time. "I'm going to the bathroom" I whispered to Sherlock before I snuck out of the crowd. I was washing my hands intentionally taking forever when I heard a beer bottle smash. I looked up to see my father in the doorway. "How dare you bring that fag to our family event!" He grit his teeth at me slamming me into the wall. "Dad, he is my flat mate and my best friend." I tried to reason with him even though all I could smell was his alcoholic breath. I felt like I was in grade six again. "I know what's going on John, I saw the news!" He punched me in the face. "How could you, you little homo!" He yelled at me again grabbing my shirt. "Your an embarrassment to this family, you didn't even have the guts to fight for your country like a man!" He punched me again with his spare hand. "It was probably one of ours that shot you, trying to get rid of you, you disgusting thing!" He shouted punching me again as I tried to shield my face and throwing me to the floor. "You are not longer part of this family, I don't want to see you or your little poofter again!" He shouted kicking me in the stomach. "I wanted a man as a son, not a little fag like you!" He yelled, I curled into a ball to protect my face and torso and he kicked me in the shins. I heard another skin hit skin punch then a smashing of skin on the sink. "John." I heard Sherlock's voice. I quickly opened my eyes to see Sherlock's hand out to me, I took his hand and he wrapped me up in his arms. I could see my father in a heap on the floor. "What, what happened?" I tried to calm my breathing but I couldn't stop crying. "I waited until he was unbalanced and punched him which caused him to fall face first into the sink and he knocked himself out." Sherlock explained. "OMG, how does he manage to make me feel like a child." I buried my face into Sherlock's shirt, embarrassed but he just held me closer. "John, we have to get him out of here." Sherlock spoke gently after I had regained myself. "Your right, we have to get back to the party." I used the paper towel to get the blood off my face and try and hide my blood shot eyes. Sherlock grabbed one of his arms as I grabbed the other and we dragged him out and towards the party. "Oh my god! John what happened?" My mother was the first to spot us. I wasn't sure what to say. "He slipped and fell hitting his head on the sink." Sherlock lied quickly. Harry looked at me and knew instantly what had happened. We put him on the ground and rolled him on his side as Harry's girlfriend called the ambulance. I excused us as soon as I could once the ambulance arrived saying we had a case we had to get back too. Harry whispered in my ear as she hugged me goodbye, "Don't be a stranger, you will always be my brother." Sherlock and I headed off quickly, grabbing a cab home in silence. Once in the flat door I put my coat on the hook and lent my forehead on the wall. "John." Sherlock put his hand on my shoulder. "I'm ok Sherlock, nothing's broken." I took a deep breath. "He disowned me, big surprise." I explained not wanting to look at Sherlock and not taking my forehead off the wall. He just wrapped his arms around me. "It's ok John." He whispered in my hair.
"John" Sherlock asked as I put the tea on. "Yeah Sherlock" I replied from the kitchen. "What would your family say about 'us'" Sherlock asked. "I thought you would know." I answered leaning on the door way watching him sitting on the couch thinking. "Your father would get violent, depending on the amount of alcohol in his system. He would either aim for your head or your torso. Your mother and your sister would be happy for us yet your mother would be banned from talking to you as your father would disown you after beating you. He can tolerate your sister been Lesbian, just, but his only son been gay.  No." Sherlock was right but he wasn't pleased. "What makes you think I would even consider telling my father, as long as I'm here with you I dont need to have anything to do with him." I pointed out. Sherlock nodded. "But you will tell your mother and your sister so he will find out eventually." Sherlock replied. That I couldn't deny. "What about your parents and Mycroft, what would they think?" I asked. "Mycroft already knows, he reminded me that emotional attachedments are distractions. Mother would also remind me emotional attachedments are dangerous. Father, well he would be, judgemental." Neither of the Holmes brothers spoke much of thier parents, other then been basically nonexistent in thier lives and that Mycroft took after his father I know nothing of them. The kettle was boiled so I made us both a tea and joined Sherlock on the couch. He was thinking deeply again. "Would you marry some random woman?" He suddenly asked. "No." I definely answered. Sherlock watched my reaction to his question but he was satisfied so I turned on the TV.
The two men follow her back down the stairs of Baker St into a black car. The Alpha glares at the female Omega. "So what do we call you?" He tries to stay calm, she has the decency to look guilty. "For this case Petty Officer Ann Campbell I'm afraid." She answers unable to look at the Alpha. "Are you really a Major?" He asks still expecting to be lied too. "Yes, but not Annabel Franks, at least you can still call me Ann." She gives the Alpha a weak smile. "Didn't a Petty Officer Campbell just recently murder an Officers Omega." John asked. "Yes, I'm technically on two cases at the moment. While the real Petty Officer is been investigated I'm to make out she is in fact in London. We suspect the Omega was selling information." John scrubbed his face. "Doesn't that mean your in danger of the Alpha coming after you?" She smiled at John as she crossed her legs. "Yes but he wouldn't realise I'm posing as the Petty Officer as I have a different face. I can't tell you anything else until we get to The Castle." The car pulled up on a side street, Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "John, I need you to put this on your lower back to cover your scent. Alpha's aren't allowed in The Castle." The major handed John what looked like a nicotine patch. "A patch that hides your natural scent, interesting." Sherlock watches intently as John pulls his shirt up and slaps the patch on in a huff. The slither of muscled back and still somewhat tanned skin distracts the curly headed Omega allowing the Major's uncomfortable and pointedly ignoring his question to go unnoticed. It wasn't long before the pulled into a large garage of sorts, it was large enough to be an aeroplane hanger. The Major was about to say something when a young Indian Omega came out a side door running across the hanger, hair a mess and plastering herself to the Major. The young Omega had just finished her heat and was still in the recovery stage. Her lean muscles flexed around the Major trying to touch as much as possible as if the Major was her Alpha. Interesting. The Major was trying hard to hide the interaction from John. "Jasmine." The Major whispered into her hair, "you should still be asleep love." The Omega rubbed her face into the Major's hair. "I woke up and you where gone, I took a shower but I couldn't smell you anymore." She practically whined. "Oh love, go crawl into my bed but grab yourself a drink of water and something to eat out of my fridge first OK." The Major gently cupped the Omega's face who nodded shyly before taking off back to the door she came out of. The Major turned back to two faces awaiting an explanation. "My office yeah." The Major gestured to another door.
John sat straight up in bed. What on earth was that? he wondered. Then he heard it again. Sherlock was screaming his name. Like a flash John raced downstairs and burst into Sherlock's room.  Sherlock was thrashing on the bed, clutching his pillow, drenched in sweat. John flicked on a light and tried to shake Sherlock awake. Sherlock's eyes suddenly popped open and he grabbed hold of John's tee shirt. Eyes wild, he screamed "I'll kill you!!!! I will find you!!! I will find you, Moriarty and I will tear your throat out!!!!" "Sherlock, its me!!! It's John!!! Wake up!!!!" Sherlock blinked his eyes a few times as John came into focus. "Oh my God, John!!" He threw John onto the floor, jumped down on top and pulled John's shirt over is head. Jesus Christ, John thought, what is happening? But Sherlock wasn't doing what John thought he was. He was running his eyes over John's chest, then his back, then his chest again. Finally, he released John and crawled back onto his bed, taking deep breaths. John went and sat on the edge.
"Oh, God, Sherlock!"  he shouted, and his head hit the mattress with a thud. Sherlock grinned. He knew that grin. He wore it earlier. Sherlock pressed his thumb against John's perineum, crooked his fingers again, and pressed so hard against John's prostate he thought he went blind for a moment. Then he released his vice grip on John's most sensitive spot and resumed thrusting in and out, scissoring and twisting, seemingly all at the same time.
That whole day at the surgery, John was very unfocused. He knew tonight would be a major turning point in Sherlock's life. He had already had his when he told Sherlock he loved him. For him, things were settled. But Sherlock could still bolt if things didn't go right. Were they moving too fast? No. He decided as such this morning. He wanted Sherlock, badly. He was scared, but he knew once he had Sherlock naked in his bed, nature would take over. For him. Who knows what kind of natures Sherlock had?
"You know I have a tendency to become obsessed."  John nodded aggressively. "Heroin helps me to become a little less focused on one thing."  John looked confused. "I can't get you out of my head."  John sat back down and Sherlock followed suit.  "Since the night at the pool, you are all I think about.  I don't understand what is hapening inside my brain and that is not a situation I am familiar or comfortable with.  When I saw the bomb, I panicked. I do not panic.  When I knew you were finally safe, I felt relieved.  I do not care if people are safe. When Moriarty fled, I did not care. You were all I cared about. I do not care about people, I care about the work. I sit here, every day, and I think and I think and I think about why. Why did I care? Why was I afraid for you? Why did I let Moriarty get away? Why do you care for me?  Why do I so admire the way you have stood by my side? Why do I suddenly sense you coming up the stairs? Why am I acutely aware of your absence? Why do I see your face, feel your fear when I dream of you by the pool? Why do I dream of you by the pool? And why, in Gods name, do I wake from these dreams longing to run to your room to see that you're still there?"
Sherlock howled. One hand reached back frantically to grab the pillow under his head to muffle his sounds, the other snatched a handful of John's hair as his fingers dug into his scalp and his back arched off the bed like Linda Blaire. John let go of his cock with a POP! and he stared at Sherlock in astonishment. "By God, John, don't STOP!" Sherlock all but yelled at him. John grinned and went back to it. He really had no idea how he was supposed to fit this in his mouth, but he had enough experience on the receiving end to know it was possible. He also knew not everybody COULD do such a thing, and when they couldn't, they used their hands. He figured he'd just wing it. Honestly, he'd never had a bad blowie in his life, someone licking and sucking at your manhood has to feel nice regardless of skill. So he just closed his eyes and did what felt natural. He closed his lips around Sherlock's head, curled his tongue on the shaft, and pressed down as far as he could go. He held the base in his hand and when he went back up he let his hand go down. Sherlock shuddered and moaned into the pillow pressed over his face. "Sherlock? I'm gonna touch you now. Just want you to be prepared." Sherlock nodded without moving the pillow.
Sherlock froze. "Excuse me?" "Fuck me, Sherlock. Fuck me now. Please, God, I wanna feel you fuck me." Sherlock could barely control himself at John's words. He began to move a little faster, a little harder, pulling out a little farther and plunging in a little deeper. But John just said "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me," over and over. Sherlock grabbed his hip tight enough to surely leave bruises, which he couldn't wait to see, and pressed him further onto his stomach. He shifted his weight so he could now take John's hips in both hands and pulled John's ass, cock still nestled tightly inside, up to his pelvis. John groaned and pressed back and said "God, yes, fuck me!" He began to ride him, John's ass quivering beneath him, sweating, and moaning at the feel of his cock in a vice. John kept a steady stream of profanities as Sherlock felt his climax coming on and he reached around and took John in his hand. John slapped it away and said "I wanna come on your cock. I know I can." "Oh God, yes. Baby. Yes. Please." He really didn't know why he kept calling John baby, but it seemed to work for both of them. He planted his foot again on the mattress and pressed John down into it, driving into him now relentlessly. The sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room as did the smell of sweat and cum and something Sherlock couldn't place and he closed his eyes and breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth as he pounded into the man he realized now he would die for.
"Why don't you go wash the taste of impending cancer from your mouth while I set the table?" "Yes, John. I live to obey " "You don't have to obey me, by any means, but if you hope to get more of where that came from you're going to." "Who said I want more?" he asked indignantly. "Your little moan just now." "I did NOT moan!" But he stomped off to the bathroom anyways while John chuckled at him.
He withdrew his hand and mouth from John and John whimpered. "Easy love, I'm coming for you." And he kissed John's thigh as he had done to him earlier. He pushed himself up onto the bed next to John and rolled him onto his side. John went willingly, pliant as a wet noodle, and Sherlock told him to pull his knee to his chest. John knew this position, had used it many times and so he did so happily. He knew what was coming. He could feel his hole exposed to the draft, could hear Sherlock opening a condom he'd retrieved from John's nightstand, and rolling it onto himself. John held himself there and waited.
Sherlock was panting now, and he suddenly felt the need to grab onto something, to regain some sense of control. He took hold of John's hair, as gently as he could manage, and pulled him back up to plunder his mouth. The kisses grew fevered, now, both of them breathing hard through their noses as they fought for control. Sherlock opened his mouth wide and John went in like he was invading Afghanistan again. He started to run his hands through Sherlock's curls, and Sherlock hissed when he gave a tug. He gave a tug on John's hair in return and John moaned and broke away, breathing so hard Sherlock was slightly concerned. "Sherlock, my God. I love you," and he pressed his groin hard into Sherlock and rocked against him. Sherlock felt John's erection against his own and said "John, I think we should take this to a larger surface."
