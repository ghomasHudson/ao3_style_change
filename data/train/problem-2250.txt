Somehow, John hadn't ever noticed that.
Author's note: M/M sexytimes herein. At this point saying that isn't so much a forewarning as a teaser, is it?
He could not quite catch his breath. The world was growing sharp and bright-edged.
Was that real gold leaf on the ceiling? Why would anyone even do that, except to show they had so much money they could piss it away on hideous decor? "What was this?" he asked without turning around. "Ballroom?"
“Get it yourself,” he grumbled, but they both knew how this was going to end. While he was up, he pulled extra blankets from Sherlock's bed and tossed them on the floor by the hearth.
, John thought, and wondered where that had come from.
Sherlock finally turned to look at him. "So this time it had to be you, out of all the physicians—"
"John, please—" He stretched out his hand but John wasn't there. The man who was there instead got off the bed and walked carefully around him without touching and quietly, quietly closed the door behind him when he left.
John sighed and reached for his trousers, wrinkling his nose and unpacking a fresh pair when he saw the stain over the crotch. "Right. I'll see if Greg wants to watch the game at the—"
He'd learned the most interesting things. His John, his warm, bright, good John, was also a creature of intriguing shadows and glinting hard edges, camouflaged with moral codes and strict rules. This was not a surprise. John had courted him by killing a man for him, after all, although he hadn't realised it then.

"Then at least we go together." He knew his therapist would be horrified at that and it wasn't the least bit healthy, but it was true and right and comforting, and Sherlock at last came and leaned his head against John's.
"You are seriously creeping the hell out of me, Mycroft. This conversation is unbelievably inappropriate. Drop it

"How fortunate for us both."
"We agreed on two," he growled under his breath.

Instead her face lit with sudden warmth and she said artlessly, "Oh, it's a love match, then," before slapping a hand over her mouth and blurting, "Oh, God, that was tactless. Forgive me."
His mobile rang as he was debating takeaway versus a butty, on his way to check the contents of the kitchen.
he wondered.
“Dr Watson.” The omega was all smiles and solicitude. “Do sit down; your leg must be hurting.”
When the kid had gone, he asked John, "Is he dead?"
John, at the Swan and Badger. A young man at his shoulder, late twenties, feature writer for a travel magazine, doing well for himself. They'd met at the pub a few times before, chatted, shared rounds, played darts.
"Yes. Nevertheless, people do rebuild marriages after betrayals, sometimes. It can be done."
"Lumbar sprain, sounds like. Rob'll take care of that. Let me see your wrist." He deftly got the cabbie's coat off and slid on a splinting cast. "Up you get, now," he told her, and he and John helped her into the back of the ambulance. Once she was settled, he said to John, "Looks like you got knocked about a bit."
Sherlock didn't kick him as he left. Mycroft was surprised for the second time that evening.
"You're in pain."
“Yes.”
“As did you.”
That doesn't mean he's not fiercely, viciously glad when he sees a familiar silhouette in a posh coat striding eagerly up the stairs to the church, where he's met by the DI. Nothing in the world will bring that boy back to life, but now Robbie

than she, and it was
"You know that's not what I'm trying to say."
A brief scrabbling slide had John thinking he'd be joining Mycroft in intensive cardiac care before Sherlock slithered back in through the window, left hand clutching something to his chest.
"Childish, Sherlock," Mycroft called after him as he dumped the wool into the bathtub and turned on the hot water.
"I'm not saying no. I just...needed a moment. This is all a bit new. I'm fine, it's fine."
For example, he had just discovered that his enemy was aware of the contingency plan that involved falling back to the boathouse, where there was both an emergency communication device and a weapon.  He'd discovered this when he'd leaned on a bit of statuary by the pond on his slow trek from the gazebo to try to catch his breath.  As he'd observed his surroundings, he'd seen the faintest flicker of movement a sniper's distance from the door:  insects riding the tiny thermal caused by human body heat.

Mycroft, you can't, it's highly symbolic and
They were so very quiet. The only sounds in the room, this cocoon of warmth and privacy, were the soft, wet noises of their coupling and the even breathing of two men falling into rhythm. John's expression was peaceful as Sherlock slipped in and out of him slowly, meditatively, entering him again and again for the sheer delight of John's almost imperceptible quiver when he seated himself fully.
John blinked at him. Where had he come from?
and John didn't want this to go any more wrong than it had already.
Therefore some novel course of action was called for. Ideally one in which John could be persuaded to participate knowingly and voluntarily, although that wasn't strictly necessary.
Sherlock woke at 05.27 to find himself rutting his fist, ejaculate smeared all over the bedclothes. A soft knot at the base of his penis indicated this indignity would go on for several more minutes.
under his hands and mouth, making noises that shot straight to his groin. It was brilliant, fucking brilliant and it'd been much too long, which is why it took hardly any time at all before his mouth was flooded with bitter salt and Sherlock let go of his head to pound a fist against the wall and groan loudly. He pulled off fast, coughing and spluttering. Damn it, Sherlock had
They slept in the same bed, and when at half two Sherlock woke, he ran a line of small, nipping kisses along John's ribs and hooked his fingers under the waistband of his pyjamas. John tensed and brought his hands up to the long, pale ones, shaking his head. "John?" he asked softly, and there were many questions in that one word.
It seems ungrateful to grieve that he wasn't there to hold his friend at the end when Casey had spared him just that, but he does, because life is so damned empty without that familiar weight leaning against his knee when he sits at the breakfast table. He's been through this before, knows that eventually he'll take a breath that doesn't hurt, that eventually he won't cry when he reaches sleepily across the bed for a warmth that isn't there, but that's somewhere in the future and right now the whole world is made up of atoms that proclaim in the very foundation of existence that
Greg found him sitting on a bench in front of a vending machine.
John woke with a horribly familiar hangover headache and the impression that something furry had died in his mouth. Since that was not actually an impossibility in 221B, he was relieved when a tentative scrape of tongue between teeth dislodged no rodent bits. Right. Good. He needed to piss, his right arm was asleep, and there was a spider crawling in his hair.
"You realize that was the embodiment of every gay-sex cliché in the book, don't you? Public, violent, degrading, power imbalance—"
"You heard me the first time."
A sigh. A rummaging through the detritus on Sherlock's chair. A solid
There was no chance, he knew, that Fitzhugh would try for anything but a head shot.  His armour was useless here.
He figured he was just about ready to be brave enough.
This was spectacularly not good.
"Sherlock."
“Who just texted you on Mycroft Holmes's phone?” asked the colonel in a mild tone of voice that meant
Once he'd cleaned the mess and washed up to make tea, he sat with a mug and an untouched apple and realised he'd decided to fight after all.
Sherlock sneered and turned back to the mobile. If John hadn't been watching him closely, he'd have missed the slight hesitation before he opened another screen and typed furiously. “Change of plans,” he said abruptly, striding to the cabin and flinging open the door. “Tobin, leave him, he's not important, someone will round him up later. As of this moment—” he flashed a time display on the mobile screen, “—you are a Crown witness. You will not leave my side until you are relieved by a superior officer or released by direct order.”
The breathing exercises weren't working; he still felt lightheaded and he knew his heart rate was far too high but he was so
"Thank you," he told Mycroft sincerely, returning the file. "That's good to know."
Mycroft exhaled. He did not lift his head. “Terms?”
Far away, Fitzhugh said, “I'm not falling for that old trick, Holmes.”
John made a heartfelt sound of solidarity and washed down his deliciously salty chip with another mouthful. He became aware Terrence had fallen silent and he glanced up from his plate to see him, slightly open-mouthed, looking over John's shoulder. He twisted his head around, which made the walls of the pub do interesting but not entirely pleasant things.
Even though it's dark and there’s no body to find this time, out of habit he takes Ava to the most deserted spot in the area for reward-play, finds a stretch of grass for her to run on. He tosses her ball and she bounds after it joyfully.

Sherlock made him bank the fire, too, lazy git.
In May, when the lease on Natalie's flat runs out, Robbie asks her to move in with him and Ava.
"Imagine a young man whose childhood has been hellish, who has survived it by telling himself everything would change when he was able to attend university where he would find others like himself. Imagine what he might do to maintain the approval of the first person his own age to offer him a scrap of positive attention. Imagine if that person had been one of those wolves. It's a game to them, to corrupt what they can, make it over in their own image, and destroy what they cannot corrupt when it is no longer amusing. It is

. Odds are that I'm wrong anyway; these doctors are the very best. I don't compare, and that's not through any false modesty on my part.”
"I've a patient waiting in Dublin."
A large hand cupped the back of his head softly, just resting there, anchoring him, and eventually he steadied and settled and then felt the flush of shame across his downturned face.
"Where are the lanterns? It's Dewali, there are lights all over the East End, it's gorgeous out there, like Christmas, but there aren't any in the house."
He was grinning madly as he clambered into the car that pulled up beside him.
"We're all paying attention to the attack, naturally. People killed, wounded, possible treason, someone after a very important device or the person who can make another. If I were in a battle where so much heavy fire was coming from one direction, I'd be watching for a flank attack."
he thought.
she would have given him the amputated gangrenous leg from the diabetic that Ross had offered her.
"They think we can lead them to the inventor?"
“The glucagon helped significantly. We’ll have their most recent assessment shortly.” It was difficult for the doctors to sort the after-effects of the heart attack from the effects of the insulin. That, of course, was what had made it such a good assassination vehicle for a cardiologist personally familiar with hypoglycaemia. Mycroft would have slipped progressively towards coma and irreversible brain damage, helped along with a massive subcutaneous injection from the syringe in Banks' pocket, the cause undetected until it was too late and that, too,

John recovered first. "Good," he said, a bit breathlessly. "That's good." In a firmer tone, he commanded, "Now stay still." He maintained eye contact whilst his warm hands slid down the body laid out beneath him, thumbs flicking over flushed nipples, fingers curling through damp hair below the navel. He made an obscenely satisfied noise as he slicked Sherlock's erection.
He began making his way to the black car a few streets away as quickly as he could without being obvious. "Bart's."
Sherlock?" called John from the stairwell. "Bloody hell, will you keep your voice down?"
"Yeah, well, I mention this on the off chance it'll keep my arse from being called out to find you next time, but you might have wanted to check yourself in before you went wandering around."
John paused. "Is this a change of subject?" he ventured. "Between 'Mycroft' and 'sex'? Because I really don't know if I can handle it if the answer to that is no." He paused again. "So my being clever is why you—"
John,right now.”
, whose conversations and other assistance above-and-beyond inspired this chapter in its current incarnation.  Her insight was invaluable, and I am deeply grateful.
"Of cou—" Thank God Sherlock wasn't inclined to hold a grudge; wet heat closed around his cock again and John's eyes rolled back. Sherlock flicked his tongue and began sucking in long, hard pulls, and a truly embarrassingly short time later, John inhaled sharply and got as far as "I'm—" before he was jerking helplessly and shouting.
# # #
John sat and, being practical, spooned eggs onto a plate. You simply never knew when you were going to get a chance to eat whilst running around after Sherlock.
"John, quick, he's found the lips! A cat's got them."
On that day in June when everything goes so very badly so very fast, Robbie's not in on the chase, and he's glad for that at least. He's at NSY when they bring Watson in for questioning, though, and a more wrecked creature is hard to imagine. When Robbie hears about the jump off Bart's, he understands why.
"Guh," he managed when Sherlock finally released his mouth.
“Ta very much; just my life we're talking about here. And you’ll have to find another flatmate if I get killed.”
“They've stopped.”
I had to do something. It's your fault it had to be something drastic. If you'd just abided by the agreement—”
A shame to have had to make the dahlia comment, but John really could not be allowed to go out looking like that. He'd been very irresponsible lately, often leaving Sherlock alone and bored at the flat while he went to the pub or cinema or some tedious restaurant or, as had nearly happened just two days ago, home with whatever forgettable individual he happened to be with at the time (although that had not
"Why would I want that?"
Of course Mycroft would choose to return this morning when Sherlock had much more entertaining things to do, such as continue his conversation with an interestingly angry John. And he would keep prattling on and on about national security and duty and dull dull dull umbrella thump dull dull rising furious voice dull.
"Yes," John answered. Then he took a chance and said, "I have the phone. Einstein here was going to try to drag
Sherlock stood up and looked at him intensely for a long moment. “You should feel honoured, Inspector,” he said at last, mockingly. “He doesn't often invite any of you
“It will take him a little while longer to understand he's being—” Mycroft's lips twisted. “—hit upon. He is rather inebriated. Is that wise, given his family history? Well, no concern of mine.” He slid the photo into the pocket of the coat hanging at the door. “I shouldn't wait too long, Sherlock, if I were you. Good evening, Brother,” he said, and tapped down the stair with the insufferable gait of a man who has just landed a particularly well aimed blow.
Long hours later, Donovan not only drove him back to his own flat through Friday-night traffic but also said not a word about Sherlock, which frankly qualified her for sainthood. She shouldn't have been driving with one eye still swollen shut, but he could hardly bring that up when he wasn't supposed to be on duty at all.
Sherlock continued to stare, waiting for something. "The case," he repeated, with more emphasis, "is over."
He came first, which was only to be expected since he didn't have a hand free to bring Sherlock off, but he hadn't done that since he was a teenager and was so embarrassed he nearly hid his face in Sherlock's neck. He didn't, though, not and risk missing watching Sherlock's face. Luckily Sherlock was right behind him and a few twisting strokes of John's hand was all it took. Sherlock held his head to his shoulder through the aftershocks, murmuring, "John, my John," and when he made to pull out, Sherlock's other hand clutched against his lower back and he said, "No, not yet."
and when you get right down to it, that's the best anyone can do.
Then John had come back and that was better, except that it wasn't because he looked tired but very satisfied and so he might leave again to do things for Mycroft. Things that made him a part of a different world, one Sherlock couldn't follow him into because he could never follow those rules even if he cared what all of them were.
"Damn it," the cabbie muttered under her breath. John craned his neck and saw three cars skewed across the road ahead. Unless the cab went up on the pavement, there was no getting through that. She tapped the brakes and the whole car lost traction on the thick layer of ice, sliding gracefully sideways until jolting lightly up against a bollard.
"—why it ma—. Say that again."
My thanks once again to

hell. Mycroft was here. He hadn't had any breakfast and his choices for getting to his room were a towel or his ratty, slept-in clothes, and Mycroft and Sherlock were having a row in his flat. Excellent. Fucking splendid. Just what he needed.
behind him. He flung himself to the floor and rolled.
When Harris had seen the marks on the back of Watson's neck, almost but not quite under his shirt collar, he'd thought he had it figured out. The little poof was the pillow-biter, then, playing the girl and taking it up the arse from the big skinny one. Made sense. Then somebody'd mentioned Watson had been in the Army—not some enlisted grunt, either, but an officer—and Harris just refused to believe that any bloke sharing a uniform with himself was a pussy so it must be that Watson was giving it to the tall one after all.
John remembered, and no-one had taken Tobin's place by Sherlock's side. He shuddered. Yes, this was ugly and complicated and far, far above his head; what had Mycroft been thinking, to involve the both of them in something so important?
Gritting his teeth, he plunged into the frigid water, squinting up at the bridge and trying to estimate where the phone had fallen. It should be right...about...here. He stuck his arms into the soft, mucky bottom and rooted around, arching his neck to keep his face out of the water.
"Shut the fuck up. You have no part in this." John restlessly paced the length of the gazebo.
When John pulled away, he had his phone. Sherlock couldn't help but be impressed at his improving pickpocketing skill even if this was an unfortunate development. He hadn't had a chance to delete more texts or voicemails since before they'd gone to Mycroft's sitting room, and John'd had a worrying number of congratulatory messages from a number of people in addition to a furious one from his sister. There was no telling how many more might have arrived in the meanwhile.
"Sherlock, for God's sake stop sniffing him. You know perfectly well where he's been; you spent the afternoon frightening off everyone he spoke with and I do not wish to be subjected to your—"
John prudently waited until the ambulance came to a complete stop before helping the cabbie up and limping to the paramedics. "Broken wrist here. Anything more serious up there?"
“We'll go in dark the rest of the way.”  The colonel switched off the headlights and slowed.  After a moment, John's night vision sharpened.
After a moment, Sherlock motioned John into the back of a waiting sedan.
“London Heart Centre,” Sherlock said. Tobin ignored him. John saw headlights coming up behind much too fast and cut towards the New North Road and heavier traffic.
"If you're going to manipulate me at least try not to be so bloody obvious about it." Anger was so much easier to deal with than longing and loss, so familiar. He knew what to do with anger, how to press it down and hold it primed and ready and waiting. He knew how to be both angry and calm. "There's something else, too, you know. If we do this, there'll be expectations, pressures, assumptions from the people around us, influencing us. Things will change, and we're not ready for that."
# # #
he said, and John said, "I'm here," and took his free hand palm to palm, fingers interlaced, tethering him so that he could let himself fall.
The fox-haired man was sitting beside his desk. Greg's stomach abruptly dropped through the floor.
It was not his fault if people drew entirely the wrong conclusions from incomplete information.
John grabbed him by his waistcoat, heaved upwards, and threw him into the next pillar.
He wrapped an arm around her small shoulders and leaned into her conspiratorially. "Mrs Hudson, we'd have loved to have you there but we had to do it in such a rush. Mycroft disapproves, you know, and he might have made things...difficult."
he prayed, exhaling deeply, lifting his chin, squaring his shoulders, and stumping forward.

"Don't do this. It...it can't ever become what it might have done, not now. That's gone."

The address they ended up at—well, “posh” didn't come close. There had been bleeding suits of armour in the room with the whisky and the fireplace, where they'd had the promised drinks. The bedroom had a fireplace too, come to that, and Greg was nearly dizzy with hope and anticipation and the erotic associations of so much luxury.
Or that might have been knocking at the door. Damn.

you if we were agreed."
He stripped off his coat and threw it over his chair, then knelt to build up the fire. He didn't get it. He just didn't get how she could notice so much and still have such a blind spot where Sherlock was concerned. “Look at that freak,” she'd said. “They're just pieces of meat to him,” and John had wanted to ask her how she thought it was that a man who supposedly didn't care about people spent his time observing them with all the fascination and longing of a kid with his face pressed against the window of a sweet shop.
"He's seconded to me from the Grenadier Guards."
# # #
John frowned into his whiskey glass and set it on the side table. "What do you mean, you panicked him into—?" Almost immediately his lips thinned. "It was the bloody armour, wasn't it?"
John's fingers stroked the fabric of their own volition. "Can't be burned. Can't be torn, either, or eaten away with acid. There isn't a scale high enough to rate its ballistic protection properties. This jacket...Sherlock, it's, it's not a fashion statement, it's body armour. If I'd had one of these in Afghanistan, I'd've had a bruised shoulder and a story to tell at the pub instead of that mess that's there now."
Oh, fuck. Oh, Christ. Not a prank.
# # #
He sat for several minutes, breathing steadily through his nose and gripping the edge of his desk. Eventually he called for Anthea.
She's smart and funny and she smells unbelievably good. Somehow they skip right over the boring so-what's-your-job type of questions and go right to the sort of things that actually matter.  She makes time every year to go to a forest in Norway to see the northern lights, which is bloody fantastic, and when she persuades Robbie to tell her about the holiday he was supposed to have spent truffle hunting with pigs in France but instead ended up in a hostel in Lombardy with a pregnant, ill-tempered nanny goat and two rabbis, she laughs until she hiccups and then laughs harder.
May good fortune fall like rain upon the heads of my sainted betas,
“Why don't you stop that jaw and just keep the ice where it's supposed to be?”
Tobin stepped back into the car with Waterhouse.
“Sherlock's been at my kitchen.”
All blunders, mistakes, and lapses in judgement are my own.
To every single person who commented, subscribed, left kudos, and lurked:  Thank you for taking the time out of your day to engage with this story.  I truly appreciate that.
“You—?” He cleared his throat. “Do you think so?”
and exhaled an
John had said, "I'm back now."
# # #
His eyes raked over his brother's flatmate. Had Sherlock sent him as a messenger? Alas, no. John was here on business of his own. Recent sleep deprivation, unshaven, hair still wet from showering and dear God in heaven
John was always careful. It wasn't like it was hard to be responsible; all you had to do was roll on a bloody condom before you ejaculated so you didn't bond before you'd planned to, and take your after-heat pill. There really was no excuse, and he had no patience, no patience at all with omegas who couldn't be arsed and ended up with mates or babies long before they could support them properly.

By the time their bodies had dried he'd stopped being angry. He'd unlocked John, who had immediately gone to the toilet and then insisted Sherlock brush his teeth and tongue and yelled at him for the patches when he'd found out. Then they'd gone back to bed, and John had put his hands on his face and kissed him, saying sleepily, "Missed you."
Sherlock's fingers slid further back and pressed, and John slapped his hand over his mouth and bit the fleshy mound to muffle his sharp groan.
"It does, it really does. He was right, you know. I can't practice anywhere else and still be free to come when you call. I'd been trying to sort that for months. It
"Shut up."
He backtracks quickly, as quietly as he can, but he's already seen two bodies pressed against the wall in the shadows, an elbow moving rhythmically under a long coat; he's heard the softly murmured, “I was right—
Sherlock sodding Holmes was a fucking coward, and the more John thought about it, the angrier he got.
"Clearly it wasn't something you valued for your own person. Sherlock's, on the other hand—"

His goddamned shoulder. His goddamned leg.

"Explain again how I'm not a prisoner," he said bitterly.
Oh. She thought they'd had the wedding without her. Well, they had, but they'd had it without John too, and strictly speaking he was supposed to be integral to the proceedings so she could hardly be put out about not being there under those circumstances. It seemed she was, though, if the quivering lip meant anything. Really Quite Extremely Not Good, Not Even a Little.
"Hmmm? Oh. Hello."
He slept even less than before, worrying about Sherlock. His newly poor stamina made his daytime fatigue insurmountable, and often he would jerk into awareness, disoriented, having fallen asleep in his chair like a doddering pensioner.
The garden view outside his window was grim this time of year.
John had absolutely no illusions about being an action hero.  He was also acutely aware that, under present circumstances, it was undoubtedly best to avoid...ambiguity about allegiance and motivation.  So whilst he did very briefly entertain the thought of lying, or of doing something truly stupid involving his gun to force the colonel, if necessary, to continue following Sherlock against his orders when this new information was revealed, in the end he simply said, “Sherlock.”
“Once more: I volunteered to come with you. Voluntarily. Of my own volition. Do you understand? I. Am. Here. Willingly. I do not need to be tied up to prevent me from leaving because I. Want. To. Be. Here.”
"There?" Sherlock placed the heel of his hand over the spot and leaned his body into it, eyes glittering like some lethal jungle cat's. The pain was shockingly vivid. "You provoked him repeatedly, every time his attention turned from you. What didn't you want him to notice?
“Not here,” Sherlock cut him off, opening the door and sweeping them both in behind him.

John remembered pale, wide eyes looking up at him from his own bed, adrift and uncertain but determined to give him everything he asked for. He half-fell forward, pressing their foreheads close for a moment, holding his lips to feverish skin. When he straightened again, he ran a trembling hand through soft curls, whispered "I trust you, oh, God," and gave himself over.
“I'm not asking you to do it in an
Mrs Hudson sent fairy cakes.
A split second later he was wide awake, eyes as fixed and staring as a hare watching a lorry bear down, convinced Sherlock had heard him from six streets away.
"Doesn't seem quite his style. We have to consider the possibility, though."
John always found it amusing when people assumed he'd developed the skill allowing him to sleep anywhere at the drop of a hat whilst in the Army. Other doctors never made that mistake, remembering their own years on the A&E rotation only too well.
, but they needed him and Greg'd been owed three more cases of his choosing after the ASBO deal. Sure, Sherlock had bitched and moaned about it but here he was, so everything was all right in the end. Wasn't it?
"Pull up a chair, then, and have some chips. I'm not ready to go."
This—Cassandra? Iphigenia? whatever—was proving harder to drive off. Not only had she not retreated but now she was dragging John around and introducing him to people as if she were the hostess. Bloody cheek. How was John going to learn anything useful with all that incessant mammary-waggling?
The next thing he knew, he was sitting on a low stone wall on the other side of the field from the body with absolutely no idea how he'd come to be there. The view was nice, though, and it was a quiet place to think.
She let him out in front of his building. There was absolutely no reason for him to feel so flat when he got off the lift and unlocked his own door, when he walked into his perfectly nice living room with much better furniture than he'd lost in the fire.
He wasn't.
"I'll be fine," he said hoarsely, and gathered his John tightly to him, held him close and shivered with anticipation and longing and fear, always the fear, but the longing and need were so much greater than that and he could do this, he wanted to do this. He wanted John to do this.

“He couldn’t have been more than fourteen. Never met an omega outside of his family, sure as hell never had anything to do with the Royal Army. God only knows what stories he’d heard. Colonel got it into his head this kid knew where the insurgent base was, but the kid wouldn’t talk.” John rolled the mug around in his hands for the warmth. “If a fourteen-year-old is shooting at you, you shoot back. You just do. But beating a kid for information—it doesn’t go over well with the men.”
"You said yes. The case was over and you'd been very clever. It was stimulating so we had sex."

"Assume I don't understand anything you and Mycroft said before that. What's going on?"
would have ended up.
“You don't have to imagine; you were there,” Sherlock said, and John laughed much harder and longer than the poor witticism deserved, still high on adrenaline and endorphins.
When it becomes clear Casey's time is drawing near, Robbie arranges for two weeks off: the first to take Casey to all his favourite places and do all his favourite things and be with him all day, every day, because there's nothing that makes a dog happier than that; the second to recover from what he knows will tear his heart into pieces.
Things really had been simpler in Afghanistan.
A pause, and then a dropping away of tension. A soft hand in his hair tilted his forehead into a kiss; a hummingbird pulse drummed in the white throat under his cheek.
There were at least eight agents being prepped for surgery, possibly some in the operating theatres already and God only knew how many were incoming. Mycroft's other medical specialists were being pulled in as rapidly as they could be transported. Clearly something had gone disastrously wrong but as no one was briefing him on that side of things he'd just have to wonder what.
John, who whilst still an idiot on distressingly numerous occasions could occasionally rise above the ocean of stupidity encompassing the part of the human race not named Holmes to something approaching competence, had said, "Surrender."
Even knowing it was exactly what the omega wanted him to do, immediately he'd been returned to his bedsit, John checked under the pillow for his gun. The Browning was gone, and in its place was a used and meticulously maintained SIG Sauer.
fucked up.”
Mike cleared his throat awkwardly. “Yeah. He's always like that.
His brother regarded him for long moments, and Sherlock steeled himself. He would not co-operate. He would not. He was not a child and Mycroft couldn't bend him to his will anymore.
do that again."
Hands were rolling him onto his back and helplessly he began to choke.
John suddenly realised he'd never asked Mycroft what his security rating had been changed to.  It must be something at nosebleed-altitude if a colonel of the Grenadier Guards was deferring to his judgement without question.  Well, now that loyalties had been established, anyway.
Sherlock launched himself off the bed disgustedly. “Don't be petty, John; it doesn't suit you.”
Jason looks relieved and says, “Yeah, true. She's a good girl, a good, good girl.” Pixie wags, Jason strokes her head, and they go back to Robbie's to drink lager and let the dogs play together. It's good for Casey to have company.
“No.”
Mycroft's hand clenched above his sternum but hovered without touching. He wasn't going to make that mistake again.  Breathing was...remarkably painful and surprisingly difficult.  Aside from the physical inconveniences, however, John's impromptu alterations to his original plan were working out quite well.
“You want to buy a motorbike?” asked Sherlock, suddenly interested.
There was a bottle of thirty-year Talisker on his kitchen table when he got home that evening. He sat with his head in his hands for a long time.

John strode forward to snatch up the jacket, then cursed imaginatively and dropped it when it scorched his bare skin. He stuck his burnt fingers in his mouth before realising he had no idea what might have been on the fabric and probably shouldn't be ingesting it.
Mycroft watched the transformation: the jaw set, mouth hardened, lines deepened around the eyes. John stood, spine straight, facing Mycroft square on, and the coldly furious look he had seen once before in an abandoned warehouse stared at him out of dark blue eyes. "Mycroft," he said softly, and a foolish man might have thought the mild tone meant John was even-tempered. "Whatever this game is between the two of you, well, clearly you're both getting something out of it because you've been at it forever. Fine. But I won't be the stick you poke Sherlock with. You don't get to hurt him through me."
Sherlock opened his mouth and John said sharply, "I did ask for the truth, remember." Sherlock exhaled and shifted in his chair. "You're asking me to stand up in front of our families and friends and the rest of the world and make an eternal oath to you. I don't know if that's a lark to you or not but it's a deadly serious thing for me."
"Full armour would have been rather too obvious. Ribs. I have a matching set now," he wheezed and wondered why that seemed terribly amusing.
"My work matters too," he said at last.
The poofter was bitching at him again. Harris wondered how Watson could stand it. Probably stuck his dick down that throat just to shut him the fuck up, he decided. Too bad there was only one room in the cabin.
And oh, wouldn't it just boil Mycroft's blood to hear his baby brother was living with a
"Jesus, I'm not even surprised that you know that, that's how surreal my life has become."
We three are going to have a little talk and you are going to stand outside in the dark and preserve your night vision so we're not all blind. Go.”
Two days later, Sherlock raced off on his own without a word whilst John was still at a crime scene. A very pissed-off John was fumbling out a text when a prickling on the back of his neck made him surreptitiously scan the area. One of Mycroft's men met his eyes, casually tapped the phone at his waist, and then went back to watching the crowd.
Sex was brilliant.
"Very well, if you can't believe I want what's best for him, at least believe I don't want to see him pushed to the breaking point of frustration and desperation. My brother is extraordinary and capable of great things if allowed his safety valves. Without those, he is an atomic bomb."
Interesting, Sherlock mused. John's trying to hide something. Futile, of course, but intriguing that he's trying.
“Oh,” breathed Sherlock, glinting in the dark, a huge, demented crow come to peck out his eyes. “You
After a moment, John said, “You didn't try to stop me from coming.”
Right there, right there in an alley where anyone might see them, right in that dirty, narrow, sordid little street, Sherlock dropped to his knees and licked John's balls.
“—wool. Friction burns are going to make wearing trousers a nightmare and no, I will not wear one of those atrocious tracksuit bottoms in public, John; I have standards, so don’t even think of suggesting it. And I would appreciate it if at some point you could see your way to removing your iliac crest from my bladder.”
"No." John sighed and stuffed a few last chips into his mouth. "Well, yes, but not the way you mean. It's complicated." He wiped his fingers and put on his coat. "See you later."
"I won't—"

more than we can possibly repay, you and I, but let's not give her a promissory note since we all know how that sort of thing turns out, okay? My heart couldn't take it. All mistakes and blunders are entirely my own.
John put a hand to his head. "Did I miss something? No, no, wait—you always do this when you're trying to change the subject—"
So what will I do now that
The haircut. Oh, Jesus.
Sherlock looked as delighted as if it were Christmas and his birthday wrapped up with high explosives and a diseased pancreas. John felt like he'd been dragged behind a lorry from Bristol to Bath without a chance to shower afterwards and then expected to sit exams in theoretical physics. He followed the conversation a bit better when "tactical counterstrike" came up, but the brothers appeared to be communicating in a high-speed shorthand of their own in which few sentences were completed and entire plans of action were referred to by single phrases.
to participate then surely it was infinitely better to be the one doing the choosing (although participation could likely be circumvented with sufficient willpower. Many things could).
Maybe Adrian knew why Robbie was in Greece.
John was entertaining thoughts of removing his own eyeballs with a runcible spoon to stop the light stabbing into his brain when he smelled the smoke. He'd learned to ignore a great many things since moving into the flat but never ignored that one; fire around Sherlock was rarely an end in itself but usually a precursor to something worse, and there were likely to be sirens of some kind in the near future if the situation wasn't diffused immediately.
Father, either, but no one could say their union was a happy one."
and he didn't know how to stop it, didn't know what to say to make John understand that it was all fine, really, if he would just—all he had to do was understand, just change his mind and everything would be
"Right. Was Sherlock just here?" Maybe he'd had another microsleep.
"You're not serious," he said, but it was halfhearted at best, and Greg shut his eyes but could still hear the rustle of cloth that accompanied one grown man's shoving his hand into another grown man's front pocket.
Greg had fervently hoped to decant John from his car into Sherlock's tender care and leave immediately for home (where five cans of good beer were waiting to dull the pain of the last little slice of eternity), but God was still holding a grudge and he'd instead been press-ganged into getting John up the stairwell and settled into the flat.
John rested his forehead on his knees and choked back the humiliating whine in his throat. Home, London, the flat, Sherlock, home, he was home and nothing was exploding. It was fine. He put a hand on Sherlock's hair and concentrated on touch and scent to ground himself.
John hastily scooted backwards off the bed, nearly getting whiplash as his head was yanked forward in protest. “Sherlock,” he said desperately, “let go. I've got to piss.”
When he'd been sixteen, the first public-school boy Greg had ever pulled—the first
John had started pouring a second mug of tea before the words registered and his hands froze.
Sherlock could get him focused properly again.
You’re more interesting than this. I thought your case would be interesting but it’s mind-numbingly pedestrian, oh,
not to conspire with your brother to screw you somehow."

Sometimes, he thought, you just have to jump in with both feet. So—"Do you trust me?"
The vial went into his pocket, and Mycroft went down the stairs, ignoring Sherlock's increasingly frantic protests as he followed: “It's
Mycroft froze. “The refrigerator was...punitive. Not an experiment?”
"No, no, no, no, no," John was saying to Mycroft as Sherlock opened the door. That was excellent. John had finally remembered the coda.
him. His feet were pounding down the stairs whilst his head was still spinning from the sudden change in position from horizontal to vertical. He could vomit later, on the fire if necessary.
“We'll be able to go home soon. You'll be more comfortable there.” He predicted John's next question. “Mycroft is being moved as soon as he's stable. His house is the most secure site possible for him, so equipment—what?”
“It's fine; I reduced it myself.” He swiped and tapped the screen some more, then made a low noise in his throat. “Are you still here? Fine, make yourself useful: go in and play bad captain to your good colonel. That piece of cannon-fodder in there is terrified of you—not only are you Black Ops, you're mad enough to be fucking someone like me.”
# # #
and he sounded so scared that John knew it was bad, very bad. Then the pain grabbed him by the guts and tore all the air away everywhere and he tried to roll to cover but his arm—his arm wouldn't—
"His mattered to you because it mattered to him. Don't you think he could feel the same—"
“I went over the Colonel’s head and asked for an investigation.”
# # #
"Ah," he said.
Mycroft’s words came with long gaps in between phrases, slurred and imprecise. The contrast with his normal speech was shocking. “Zurich. Clinic. No. John. He stopped, if you’re here.” Sherlock's faint wince confirmed John's guess at both the nature of that clinic and whom Mycroft had been visiting. He wondered how long ago that had been, and how many times it had taken Sherlock to get clean.
# # #
He stabbed the fork at his dinner and cleared his throat. "That's fine."
#  #  #
“Home,” he told the driver, and seconds later he told himself not to be a fool and amended, “No, the Heart Centre,” as he carefully held his phone in both hands and thumbed Eliza's icon.
“Hm.”
Long moments later he flopped down onto the mattress again. "I didn't mean to wake you."
"I can't hear you!"
Sherlock said sharply, “You think something's wrong. What? What are you looking for?”
"What are you waiting around for? Get the car," the colonel told Harris. "We need to be long gone by the time they find the body."
“So you can get your hand off my cock, all right?”
"Wait,
—and marched him down the hallway, giving him a good shove over the front threshold. “Out. Now. You're off the case. You're off every damned case from now 'til Doomsday.
“This is Tobin. Passcode Carlo Bergonzi. We're coming in hot from Hoxton. I need Ultra-cleared witnesses and backup. Give me a destination.” Seconds later he said to John, “Moorgate. They'll escort us from there.”
And not even aimed at living targets. Deplorable waste.
He'd thought nothing of it. He'd had no reason to think anything of it. He'd certainly had no reason to connect it to the prisoner. Not until Grant brought back the shirt, rank with the stench of terrified alpha, undertones of piss beneath apocrine and adrenaline that made bile rush up his oesophagus with its

Sherlock had devised sixteen ways to flense the epithelial layer from Mycroft's tongue before he noticed John had left the flat again. Shortly afterwards Lestrade phoned with a mysterious decapitation that kept him at Bart's until the small hours of the next morning. When he got home again, the flat smelt of bacon sandwiches and there was one wrapped in cling-film on the coffee table. It had gone soggy but he ate it anyway, pressing the collar of John's jacket to his nose and wondering if John would be unreasonably angry at being woken up by the violin.
Hesitantly he asked, "Are you—?"
# # #
He let silence settle between them again. "Is it truly unforgivable, that he was so frightened of losing you that he reacted this way? He doesn't understand the difference between the form and the spirit of the thing, but John, at least he tried to give you something he thought you would want."
“Piss off,” he croaked. Mycroft would take away the cocaine.
John's back stiffened further but he said nothing.
"Shut up. How do you know what a dahlia is, anyway?" John smacked the kettle down on the hob. He needed tea and a shower. Bits of hair had worked down the neck of his jumper and he itched like a bastard. That barber—no, no, no, don't think about the haircut, don't think about the haircut, Sherlock will
Well, if Fitzhugh wanted a show, Mycroft would give it to him.  “The dead are beyond offense, and what do soldiers die in the name of, if not peace?” He'd have to risk pouring the decanter, even as unsteady as his hands were.  He needed an excuse to keep facing away from Fitzhugh; the man wasn't quite ready to shoot him in the back and the longer Mycroft could keep him talking, the longer the brandy would have to take effect. “You'd rather we keep fighting, keep throwing bodies into that charnel house?  The
"It's...it's a Svalinn 7004X." John pulled the jacket to his face and inhaled the scent of suede shoulder patches and gun oil. He may have rubbed his cheek against it a little, too, in a very manly way. "It's still in beta. You can't buy them. Nobody knows how they choose who gets them...but I guess if anyone would know how to get one..."
John had said the night before, and John in a vest hung with explosives had not looked so desperate to be somewhere,
as if that was terribly significant.
Sherlock said irritably, “I came with you voluntarily.  I
He wasn't very worried about John and himself. That relationship would be fine. After all, the man left wearing the jacket.
“Ooh. What is that?” Brow furrowed, she tilted her head from side to side.
John gingerly palpated his swollen cheek and marinated in the chilly, muddy puddle on the plastic chair. He'd had no idea birds could hit that hard. Swans always looked so graceful and serene, just bundles of fluff placidly floating along. Turned out they could slug like sodding cricket bats.
Then John's hands were pressing his thighs apart, and Sherlock could only draw great, heaving breaths and cock his hips in anticipation, but again John merely ghosted fingertips and lips over Sherlock's phallus. It wasn't enough, and it was all too much, too much sensation, too much alien emotion rising in him; Sherlock closed his eyes and fought it down.
“You're making me nervous,” he snapped.  “I can't concentrate.”  There was something he was missing.  What had Mycroft—
"Never," he said without a blink, and John started to think his life expectancy might just have gotten a bit longer.
"No. Watch me."
"Really lucky." She jerked her chin up the street. "Here's an ambulance. Must've already been coming for them." She tilted her head towards the cars that had blocked the roadway.
Sherlock was a master liar and manipulator and John knew it as well as anyone, but...no. He'd been sincere when he'd taken John to bed, when he'd said he hated wanting something so ordinary as a commitment but wanted it anyway. John didn't doubt he'd played every bit of it for maximum effect, but he'd long ago accepted he lived with a drama queen.
"Mycroft—"
John shook his head. “No sign of one,” he said absently, checking and rechecking the monitors, the drug dosages, the blood values. Anticoagulant, beta-blocker, nitroprusside....
"Not your—"
Omega arrogance radiated from the sharp, thin figure leaning ostentatiously on an umbrella, leaving no doubt as to his race and sex. With the detached hypervigilance that had slid over him when the bedsit door had opened, John noted the bespoke tailoring that could not conceal a gun, and the empty chair—just one—offset to the right. There were three points in the room at which an unseen sniper could be positioned. Of course, it could be they'd just go for a close-range shot in the chair once the suit left.
The omega regarded him briefly, head cocked to the side, raven-like, and his smile changed. “I wonder if you realise that's true.”
When he was finally released, he limped along the pavement, half-squinting against the freezing sleet splattering down around him and trying to flag a cab. He was soaked through and shivering and his knee hurt like mad from the swans' attack. He thought one had hit him with a wing there; he gritted his teeth every time his patella shifted and thought longingly of a warm auto. Naturally, they were few and far between.
Mycroft settled himself. "Actually, I've come to see
"I was saying to John that we'll need a cover story to explain why you're moving in these social circles again as you investigate. It's only natural that I should invite my brother and his partner to stay with me as we arrange a public celebration of their engagement."
He was shit at this. Sherlock constantly sifted through so many possibilities. How did he manage to sort through the static to find the significant?
“Pity. Did he offer you something we could use to get cash?”

"I'm not the one trying to put him in a
They were both healthy adult males, and therefore the attempt ended in ejaculations despite the inadequacies. Sherlock's orgasm was little different from those resulting from solitary masturbation, with none of the complexity or deep satisfaction he'd come to associate with those involving John. He spent the rest of that night and several following days restless and irritable with the knowledge there were levels of John to which he no longer had access.
So Watson must be Special Ops and that meant Fitzhugh had given him
Apparently the registrar had taken it upon himself to do Sherlock one more little surprise favour.
"Shut up."
Lovely. A brand-new night terror. Just what he needed.
Everything was quiet and dark, the telly flickered soothingly, and his lap was warm.
He needed to get out and run. Go out into his alleys and run and run until his body submitted to his will and the wildness ebbed away and took with it the stark craving.

And Mycroft was not thinking—he was not—about Montague Street, nor about how Sherlock had never once apologised for making his brother find him like that, nor about the years Mycroft had been coming home to an empty house and a cold bed because he could not run the world and protect his brother and still have anything left for himself. He was not. He was not thinking about any of that when he stopped at the kerb beside the car, plucked the vial from his pocket, dropped it on the pavement, and held Sherlock's eyes as he brought his heel down on it with a good deal more force than he'd intended.

Impossibly dull. Indescribably dull. Possibly fatally dull. His brain might actually rot if things went on much longer like this.

Though there wasn't any reason for awkwardness, John thought, running his hand lightly over shoulders that were far too thin. The two of them had slept together before, back when things were still—well, you couldn't call it
"S'all right, mate. Happens to us all at one time or another. Nothing to be embarrassed about," Lestrade was saying kindly. "Head down, and try not breathe through your nose. It passes."
He could argue, but rejecting the gift seemed counterproductive. He settled himself and drifted, feeling the warm hand on his belly slide over his skin, around and around.
“You’d better come back,” he told the empty car. “You'd sodding well better.”

he thought as John drifted into light sleep.
"If you'd put on some clothes I might be able to argue with that."
"What? Er, no. Just a suit." The comment had obviously gone straight over his head, and Mycroft sighed; he feared a query about a happy announcement in the near future would tip his hand too far.
, for Christ's sake.

John firmly bit back an

With a dreadful sense of foreboding, Sherlock peeled the wrapping paper from the flat package Mrs Hudson handed him. Oh, no. How in the hell had she come across this?
Too soon—he'd wanted to make it last for John, but he hadn't yet taught his unco-operative transport to wait—too soon he felt coiling heat in his abdomen, felt the wave of his climax racing towards him.
He grinned. Yeah. It was fucking
“The reason you're fatalistic and reconciled to death is because you recognise that it is a perfectly plausible outcome. You're quite right: on your own, you can do nothing to stop those whose interests would be advanced by your disappearance. You need me for that.”
In every scenario he'd imagined, John had been angry. Sherlock had anticipated that, had contingencies for every variation: shouting, flinging projectiles, attempting to storm off. He could direct anger, could talk John around. Anger was fine. In some scenarios it led to sex. He would provoke John into using the handcuffs and being very rough, and when his anger had burnt out and he felt guilty he would come around. It would be fine.
John crouched and bent his head to peer at the soil, giving Greg an unimpeded view of the deep purple bitemarks that covered the back of his neck from hairline to neckline. He lifted his eyes hastily and intercepted Sherlock's smirk just before the git dropped off the railing, stepping up close behind John to lean down along his back and point to the ground.
She'd saved the both of them with her

“Oh, yeah. Bloody hard deduction, that one. My spunk in your arse tell you that?”
—another—
He wasn't nearly smart enough to figure everything out, but he had to believe that Mycroft knew what John would do and had factored that into his plan, and he had to believe Sherlock had worked it all out and was not going to let him walk into a trap with no escape. At least not without a good reason.

"Yoo hoo!  Boys? You have a visitor."
Watson was motherfucking
John gave the first genuine laugh he'd had since this bloody luncheon began. "No, no, it's fine. That's a far more charitable way of putting it than what most of the people here are thinking."
His phone pinged.
"What will you have him do, Sherlock? Will you keep him entirely dependent on you, with no chance to make his own way, no opportunity for pride in his work, all his notable accomplishments in the past? Is that any fit way for a man to live?"
He slouched in his chair and curled his lip.
“In addition to the physical symptoms, a degree of cognitive impairment is expected and likely temporary. Expect some emotional lability as well.” Avoid public interaction, in other words. “Mycroft.” He turned his attention back from the garden. “These after-effects are not failings of your body or mind. Please do not attempt to reassert control in ways that could be deemed foolish.”
Puberty was the best thing ever to happen to John.
"We're not scaling any buildings, Sherlock. Why don't you stop making the nice SAS man over there wonder if he needs to draw his gun and go give the...code thing to Mycroft."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, strode to the door, flung it open, announced "Breakfast here" loudly to the hallway, and slammed it shut. "There. Now, as I was saying,

The brand-new black saloon idling at the kerb was upholstered in leather, so it probably wasn't going to be where he died. The abandoned warehouse it pulled into, on the other hand, seemed just right for the purpose.
Oh. Apparently Not Good. Upon finding oneself in an untenable position, go on the offensive. "I'm surprised by you, John. I never took you for a hypocrite."
He let the towel slide off his shoulders—
"I'm fine."
But he's never shaking either man's hand after a case unless he knows they've been to the gents first.
He had many regrets, but few things he could have done differently. He'd had fewer options in the past, less experience, less influence, a shorter perspective.
It was all going very fast—Sherlock liked to get right on with things and go straight to the point—and soon he was panting, hips straining upwards until Sherlock took pity on him and closed a hand around his shaft. Maybe not mercy at all, John corrected himself, letting out a strangled cry as that mouth closed over his head and the hand began stroking. Maybe it was just a new way of inducing a heart attack.
Mycroft did not look up from the report he was poring over when Sherlock dropped insolently into the chair, merely slid a copy of the registrar's document across the desk in response. "Explain about Victor, and he may forgive you for this."
"There's lube in my nightstand."

"There y'are, sir. Looks right smart on you, that does. Should do it like that at home." And the barber had tried to sell him a tube of product that smelled subtly manly and cost fifteen pounds. John had declined but had been tempted, because women liked it when a bloke made an effort. It really had made his hair look...good. Great. Sexy, even.
“You would see it that way.” The voice was full of loathing. That, too, was part of this grand play: the righteous indignation.  “You made peace with their killers.  You treated with those animals as if they were honourable men, you granted them concessions.  You dishonoured the memory—the

'Course, the other problem was that if Fitzhugh thought he needed two spooks to get the job done, it was going to be harder to pull off something that would finally impress the poncy bastard and let Harris move up to better things. He'd have to have a think about this.
Sherlock was an alpha, but that was probably another of those things stupid people said couldn't be changed when it was just that they were too lazy to do it. Lazy and stupid.
“And what do you want in return?”
“Can you think of a better one?”

“She's young,” Robbie tells him. “Give it time. And probably they got him indoors before it actually happened. She can't find a scent that isn't here.”
Swearing, she got out to inspect the damage. John thought he ought to do the same, but didn't want to risk his knee on that ice if he didn't have to. He peered through the windscreen and saw people standing calmly on the pavement near the three cars ahead. Nobody badly hurt, then.
"John," he said, barely whispering, "I must not be taken hostage, not under any circumstances. Do you understand? That must

"Travel where?"
When he had poured himself into John, all his lust and rage and desire and fear, he'd felt him shaking beneath him and heard him, muffled by the duvet, gasping, "Please, Sherlock, God, please, I need you to touch me, please." So he had; he'd rolled John onto his side and taken him into his mouth and demanded everything. He hadn't stopped until John was spent and begging, "No more, too—too much,
"When someone sits on them, we will." Sherlock's fingers were at his fly now, and John shuddered when knuckles brushed the line of hair below his navel.
"Yes."
Mycroft had the most peculiar expression on his face. “Do you,” he said slowly, not a question, and Greg hummed agreeably.
“Mike, can I borrow your phone?” he interrupted.
That wasn't a lie. What he'd had with her, it hadn't lasted, but it wasn't a lie.
John was talking about the case and that was a good sign, surely—he still thought of them as partners if he was talking about the case, didn't he?—but nothing about his body language suggested anything but duty. Now was the time to be very clever but he had no data with which to evaluate potential courses of action concerning this man who was not his John. He had to acquire data quickly.

"Well, you know those poncy snobs. Good enough to be his brother's flatmate, but a brother-in-law is a different kettle of fish."
"Right," said Lestrade slowly, meeting Sherlock's intense gaze and then examining the carpet runner. "I'll just...take his statement and be off, then."
And then I'll post it on the blog."
In the morning, before he left, he hobbled stiffly to the lamp to which Sherlock's gaze had strayed when Mycroft's need to use the lavatory during the seventh hour had become too great to ignore. There was a small glass vial within the pipe, snugged tight against the cord.
A dark shape dropped from the plane tree behind the gazebo and observed dispassionately, "Less surface area to dissipate the kinetic force. Luckily you have ample padding to absorb the impact. Clavicle?"
Mycroft waved him towards a chair by the tray. "Eat, please. It can compensate somewhat for lack of sleep. We need to talk and we haven't much time."
But somehow it had all gone arseways when he'd mentioned marriage and Sherlock wanted to tell the cabbie to just keep driving in circles around the city because he was afraid that when the taxi door opened John would bolt. His rebellious stomach—when had his body parts starting doing as they pleased instead of waiting for orders?—roiled.
They had been walking for over an hour and cold rain had been falling for twenty minutes by the time he circled them around to the gazebo. Neither man had spoken a word. John was still stiff but his breathing was steadier and Mycroft thought the immediate crisis might be over.
Sherlock pulled out his—Mycroft’s—mobile as John carefully prodded a molar with his tongue and decided it would probably stay put. “It's true,” Sherlock finally said. “The news is out.” He regarded Greg unwaveringly. “How did you recognise Mycroft's address?”
The smell was much stronger on his jacket than it could possibly have been in his hair days ago, and his jacket had been much closer to Sherlock that night than John had been, up in his room. So why had Sherlock been—?
Since they'd begun having physical relations, John's innate sensuality had thrummed against Sherlock's skin like the notes of a cello. Annoyingly, he was not alone in this;
“Clever,” Sherlock said, which was probably as close as the Holmes brothers could ever come to saying “I love you and I'm glad you're not dead, you insufferable twat.”
"What happened?" He steered him towards a chair but Sherlock yanked his arm away and began pacing.
“I'm fine.” Sherlock's voice was unusually steady and calm and he was standing strangely, with his hands placatingly held away from his body and his torso very still. “I need to find out where Fitzhugh is so I can talk to him. That's the important thing now. All right?”
but he clearly might as well have saved himself the trouble.
Mycroft turned and busied himself with the whiskey. "The couch is well padded," he offered casually. When he handed the glass to John the man's face was scarlet, and Mycroft felt a sense of wonder that such an innocent could be part of his world even so tangentially.
Sherlock seethed.

of confusing wet dreams to figure out: that he wasn't quite as straight as he'd believed himself to be, and worse, was tight in the pants for this mad, brilliant, unpredictable fucktard of a man.
and told me I should have taken money from him to spy on you so we could have split it. Now I'm taking money from him—and it's a lot of money, Sherlock, enough that I could buy a—a bloody good motorbike or something for just one surgery—and you're throwing a colossal strop over it? Would you make up your mind?”
No pressure or anything.
“I think that's what we're deciding now.” John drank two-fifths of his tea and Sherlock savagely snapped pipettes to Fibonacci stubs. They might very well have gone on not looking at each other, not speaking to each other, not touching each other, possibly for weeks or at least the rest of the morning had Mrs Hudson not taken it upon herself to bring up the freshly delivered milk of the day.
Sherlock perked up a little at that. "Yes, that was good, wasn't it?" John slid a plate of water crackers and cheese to him and pretended to fuss with the teapot as the other man inhaled even the crumbs.
Robbie can't help but notice that when Holmes looks at Watson this time, Watson beams admiringly, and when the men walk together to consult with the Met team that will be searching the wharves (on overtime, God help Lestrade if Holmes is wrong), they're shoulder-to-shoulder and leaning towards each other. That's good, then. He wonders how they did it, how they found their way back to each other when they'd been so far apart with no dog to lead the way.
Because if Mrs Hudson knew, God knew how many other people did. Mycroft surely did and they were going to be staying in the man's house and Mycroft had no reason at all to do Sherlock any favours.
Mycroft held up a hand. "Hear me out, please. You can't practice within any conventional institution of medicine and still be available to accompany Sherlock on his very unconventional escapades. The position I have in mind offers a flexibility of schedule you'll not be able to find elsewhere, and it will challenge you as locum work in a clinic couldn't possibly do."
"Boys," said John tiredly.
Three minutes later, staring blankly at the phone in his hand and realizing he couldn't remember Sherlock's number (which was not, of course, in the Contacts list, and why had he expected it to be?), he sheepishly conceded that the paramedic might have a point.
"Oh. Oh, dear. I thought Mycroft liked John."
John discovered Sherlock had re-taken his phone when he tried to call Mrs Hudson about the extra milk whilst Sherlock was showering. He grunted in exasperation and then realised there had to be a landline somewhere in the house.
“Does Sherlock know it's a trap?”
My own brother-in-law—”
deepened.
And things were different now, not like back when he'd joined the Met. Non-discrimination policies and the like, even if the Chief did have a stick up his arse. No, a lot of things were different now. A lot of things could be different for Greg, if he was brave enough.
“How's Mycroft?” John shouldn't have had to ask. He had saved his patient's life; he should have been in Mycroft's room with the other doctors, never mind that he wasn't a cardiologist. But that was the deal struck with the major: John would stay in the reception area with Sherlock, and in return there would be no guards posted in the room with them—no guards who might be looking for payback for their injured squadmates. It was acceptable under the circumstances, but it was wrong that Sherlock couldn't be with both his brother and his—whatever John was to him now. Partner. Surely still that?
That had been unexpected. He'd need to adjust his plans accordingly.
“Your colonel used psychological torture instead.”
The barber hadn't given any signs of noticing and John thought the sound of hairdryers had drowned him out. The rest of the cut had gone as usual, except that when the barber put away his clippers, he'd briskly slapped some unfamiliar product onto his palms and done...something...and at the end of it John's hair in the mirror was fashionably spiked.
The fat jokes stopped.

"I'm fine."
"Mr Holmes—Mr Mycroft Holmes will see you in his office when you've finished, Sir."
Of all the things Robbie resents most on behalf of his cadaver dogs, it's the notion that the dogs should be sorrowful when they find a body, which is bloody hypocritical because the police themselves don't do that, can't afford to let soft emotions get mixed up in it that way. No, when a dog finds what he was set to find, be it a lost toddler in the woods or a bomb in the Underground or a corpse, he has a right to celebrate. But because civilians are squeamish about cadavers, a handler learns to take his dog off somewhere out of sight to throw his favourite toy and make a fuss over a job well done, and Watson seems to have figured that out.
