MJ smiled "that was a good thing to do loser. I would have kicked his ass there and then."
Peter nods "yes ma'am." collecting his things from the table and starts to walk out of the room hearing Flash laugh "Looks like little Penny's faking sick so she doesn't have to stay at school tomorrow when we're on the field trip!"
Sitting down with Ned and MJ who already got their food Peter took out the cough medicine Clint gave to him. Ned turned to him swallowing the food he had in his mouth "you not eating Peter?"
"What was that?!" Miss Erica hated it when people would mumble.
Before feeling pain against his face. Flash punched him giving him a black eye before letting go of his jacket dropping on the ground Peter started to cough as tears started to fall down his face, Flash spit on him "that's just your warning Penny. Stupid girl" before getting back to the group.
"No problem loser. I over heard that you aren't allowed on the field trip."
Well goodbye Peter's field trip I'll see you again in the future. I hope to try and recover from these thoughts and write a better chapter for you :).
"um.. no thank you Fri I'm actually going to see him now."
"Hold up what about me!" Wade said coming out from nowhere "Any questions for Deadpool?"
Of course freaking Flash just had to raise his hand "How come Pen- Peter didn't get a pass?"
Though for those who might be upset I encourage you to go and read my other field trip story "She's my mother" I wrote it along time ago close to the same time as this story. I finished and it's still getting kudos to this day lol. But yeah that's all I really have to say. Hope you all have a wonderful day or night!
~~~~~~
"Just making sure kid. See you at dinner."
"WHAT!!" everyone shouted
Peter smiles "Thanks I know that terrible people will just get what's coming to them soon."
Shuri gives a confused look "oh okay? Anyway would you mind if I can take notes on your body?"
"That's stupid! I can't believe your teachers are that dumb. I'll call Tony maybe he can figure something out for you."
"Morning dad, I'm feeling better than yesterday." he puts the bowl into the sink. "Might want to check your temperature before going down to work in your lab Pete. Don't want your cold to spread if it's still to high." Tony continues.
Once getting up to look at the lower level labs Peter stayed close to Ned and MJ as they walked with Ned fangirling and MJ holding her sketchbook close to draw another face either Flash or Miss Erica could make while here. "Dude this is so awesome! I can't believe you don't need a pass to enter."
Clint signs 'that's good, remember to take some tomorrow just in case.'
She cracks her knuckles going up to Flash "hey Flash!" taking him by the collar "Remember when I said I can kick your butt? Well I meant it!" she readies her fist about to punch him before feeling warmth on the top of her hand looking up seeing Erica with an angry look.
Nat: kay, but we're telling Tony. I'll just go give that teacher a piece of my mind for now.
Once everyone sat down Cindy raised her hand "What does miss Jordie do?" she asks
The class soon came to the training area since Tony was now in charge of the tour they could go to higher rank levels such as this. Upon entering Peter could see the avengers who were there he saw Natasha, pops, Clint, Bucky and Jordie who was sitting with Makayla on one of the bleachers to make sure she wouldn't get hurt. Thanks to Peter's sight he could see one of Shadow's tendrils wrapped around the little girl protectively.
"Seems like you're the only one begging for attention Flash, saying you like penis' so much." MJ smirks. Flash rolled his eyes backing off as they continued to look around.
"You're just in time for me to kick Bucky's butt in Mario Kart." Steve says as Peter walks by the couch. "Sorry pops I can't I have homework to do."
Peter didn't really care and started to walk off to look at the exhibits of his aunts and uncles. Before hearing Olivia finishing up "Please only take pictures, don't touch anything or if an avenger may come on this floor respect their space unless they say it's okay."
A few of the students said as they walked around looking at everything they possibly could. Before getting back together in a group ready to see Mr. Stark's personal intern's lab if it was anything like they just it was going to be great!
Once the elevator door opened there were already a few avengers there. On the couch was Bucky and Steve playing Mario kart, Jordie was in the kitchen baking cookies while Shadow kept sneaking chocolate, and Natasha and Clint were having a arm wrestle.
Peter smiles at his friend "thanks MJ."
"Alright class I got a big surprise for you!" The teacher announced.
Once getting down to his lab Peter started to work on his web shooters to make a new fluid for them to make it to hold down more enemies in battle. He sniffs grabbing a tissue blowing his nose "man it's hard to work when you're sick." looking at the clock 9:30 am Jordie's bakery will be opened soon "wonder if she's got any snickerdoddles?" he questions.
Wiping his face Flash smirks "to bad because I really ant to hurt you!" he says throwing a punch at Peter who dodged it that didn't stop Flash though as he continued to throw more punches at Peter who kept dodging the attacks.
Flash laughs in the back "enjoying it while you can Penis? This is probably the only time you've been close to the avengers."
Later at Peter's lab. Peter continued to work on his web shooters finally getting them complete he smiles shooting a test blast at a dummy before going over to it and tried to pick it up with no luck the thing was stuck. "Yes! It works! It works!" he cheered taking off the shooter he had to tell Tony about this.
"Okay dad."
Shuri does know that Peter is dating Deadpool but once while they were working on inventions for the avengers Peter accidentally asked 'will you marry me?' instead of 'Will you pass me that?' in xhosa which Shuri made sure to never let down.
Tony’s brow furrows. “Why are you thanking me for something you haven’t even used yet?” He waves a hand towards the box. “Go. Go get it. You have to try it out.”
“Do you have some basic tools?” Tony asks, not missing a beat.
There’s a slow song playing again as the dance floor fills with pairs. Tony takes the lead, the only dance partner Steve can trust he can follow. They hold each other close, Tony’s arm wrapped around his waist, laying his head on Steve’s shoulder.
The Stars barely outrank the Mockingbirds as far as number of wins went for the season thus far, but that didn’t totally count them out. The team from Massachusetts was no joke, and where they may lack in defense, they knew how to get runs and steal bases like no other team.
It may have been a possibility once upon a time for him, but at this point it doesn’t feel like offspring are in the cards. Tony has made his opinion clear multiple times, saying he could never raise a kid without screwing it up, and that the bots were children enough for him. Even if surrogacy or adoption were available options to him, Steve feels like that time in his life has passed. Grant was a surprise to both Bucky and Natasha, but once they realized it was happening they were completely on board with raising a child. With the rest of his close friends currently parenting newborns to teens, or even expecting another child on the way, Steve has plenty of outlets to feel that occasional nurturing sensation of fatherhood, and for him that’s enough.
The elevator can't move fast enough as it climbs to the twentieth floor. Steve is lucky no one is waiting to get on, because he would've bowled them right over in his sprint to get to Tony's room.
It’s a nice, private area, a kitchen with a fridge stocked with beer and a buffet of all the best baseball foods lined up along one wall. Glass doors on the opposite end of the room lead out to the balcony portion of seating, three rows sectioned off just for them with a great view of the field. Tony notes Thor standing off to the side, holding a brunette woman in his arms who must be Jane while talking to a tall, gaunt-faced man with long raven hair that Tony doesn’t recognize at all. Steve is outside, leaning casually against the railing as he converses with Barton and Lang.
Steve briefly squeezes his hand and drops it away just as quickly as a car passes by at a lazy pace. “I think it’s a really good fit.”
“Koala,” Tony reminds him. “Now I’m all sweaty,” he points out, though he’s not at all put off by Steve’s hugs, even if he is sweaty from his run.
Steve lifts his shirt over his head and tugs at Tony’s own shirt. “I have a solution,” Steve says, turning the shower on and pulling Tony along with him, laughing as they stumble into the running water.
2. Tony’s head feels like it’s in a vise.
“Consider me surprised,” Steve smiles, still not lifting his head from Tony’s shoulder.
Tony could ask why he hasn’t mentioned his sleepless nights, why he hadn’t confided in anyone on the team, or asked for help, but he doesn’t, and for that, Steve’s grateful. He doesn’t have the energy to go into it right now, but more than that, he has a feeling Tony knows exactly why.
“Huge. Massive, even,” Tony continues, enjoying the way Steve throws his head back, the way his eyes brighten when he laughs.
“Please,” Tony sighs.
Really, on days like this the only thing he can do is lay down in the dark and hope that sleep will consume him, that the pain in his head won’t be so much that he can’t doze off. It’s easier when he’s not alone, though, but he hadn't wanted to bother Steve.
“Do you want to—“ Steve starts, but Tony shakes his head.
“Thanks,” Tony manages to mutter as Steve threads his fingers through Tony’s hair, soothing him enough to finally sleep.
He sifts through another pile of photos, polaroids his mother had taken at some point, and stops when he comes to one of himself on Christmas. He’s sitting by a plastic workbench, a gummy grin on his face. Howard’s just out of frame, a half-smile on his face, because of Tony or something else entirely, he would never know.
He tries to calm himself down, to will away the prickling heat of tears threatening at the back of his throat and behind his eyes.
“Hi,” Tony says, more of a groan than a greeting.
“It’s a surprise, but fine, yes, soup for my over-tired, part-time koala super soldier.”
“Hmm, can’t have that,” Steve agrees, a wrinkle appearing between his eyebrows. “You’re Tony Stark. Appearances myst be kept up.”
Steve’s eyes narrow a fraction. “How could you possibly remember that? You know you can’t prevent a cold with soup, though, right? And plus, by that logic I shouldn’t be doing this,” Steve gestures between them, bodies still entwined. “Since according to you I’m all germs.”
Tony and Howard had no shortage of problems, that much was public knowledge, but all that really means, twenty years on, is that Tony is left with a whole lot of room in his chest and his head for regrets, especially on days like today.
He isn’t coping entirely well. He isn’t drinking, though, and he counts that as a win in and of itself.
Another nod. “I didn’t know it was so bad. I would have… I don’t know,” Tony trails off.
“You were gone entirely too long, Steven. I’m going to have to stand here like this for at least twenty-four hours,” Tony warns him. “Hope you didn’t make any plans.”
He really couldn’t be happier to see him.
“Tony,” Steve says, clearing his throat. Maybe he wouldn’t notice how visibly
He’s never been the best at asking for what he wants. What he needs, really.
Tony’s eyes narrow.
“I’ll even let you pick what we watch,” Tony tells him, extending a hand and pulling Steve to his feet. He lets Steve lean on him as they walk to the common room, an arm looped around Tony’s shoulder, like he’s not sure Steve won’t collapse all over again. Honestly, Steve isn’t sure either.
“Well, yeah, but I kinda have to be here. Name’s on the building and all,” Tony gestures in the direction of the floor to ceiling windows, the Stark logo reflecting brightly against the rain-spattered windows. Tony puts his hands over Steve’s, stilling his nervous fidgeting with his own.
. But the nightmares chase him night after night, alone in his too big, too cold room in the Tower, so high up he couldn’t even drown out his thoughts with the sounds of traffic and city sirens.
(Steve does get sick a week later. Tony gloats about being right, but only a little, and only with more soup.)
Steve stares. Deep down, he’d known Tony was a night owl for a reason, but he’d never heard him talk about it.
“Mmm. Did Erskine ever mention you being part koala? I have a theory,” Tony says, setting down a spoon and turning in Steve’s arms.
“Well, I could be wrong,” Tony hedges, not wanting to pull away from the embrace just yet. “Plus, I’ve barely seen you this week, it’d be cruel to leave me here all alone.” He pulls his face into an exaggerated pout.
But this morning, the anniversary of his parents’ death, he’d gotten swept up in the news coverage. The 20th anniversary of their death — murder — and Tony, well.
Steve laughs wetly, and it sounds hollow in the quiet. He can’t bring himself to speak just yet, doesn’t trust himself not to cry in front of Tony, with his soothing voice and attempts to make him laugh. It’s all so stupid and yet—
Tonight, Steve had actually managed to sleep for a few hours before waking up in a sweat, gasping for breath. His mind raced as he tried to get a grip on the nightmare that was already fading. He’d tugged on a sweatshirt over his t-shirt and made his way to the kitchen, ready to settle into his all too familiar routine.
“Hi,” Steve says. “JARVIS told me where you were. I hope that’s okay,” Steve says quietly.
“Good,” Tony says. He looks at the mess around them again. “Let’s leave this for the morning, okay? We can watch a movie or something, if you still don’t want to sleep?” It’s an offer, a lifeline, and for once, Steve decides to take it.
“That sounds reasonable,” Steve says easily. “No plans.” Steve smiles, lifting a hand up and stroking it through Tony’s hair. He’d missed this while he was gone, the ability to just reach out and touch Tony whenever he wanted. He wants to breathe him in, make up for lost time.
“Yeah, well. Still.” Tony gives him a look so full of worry and sorrow and something else Steve can’t name, that he almost misses it when Tony reaches out and takes Steve’s hand in his, squeezing tightly.
Now he knows what triggers them, tries to avoid red wine, certain cheeses, and chocolate if he can help it. Some things, like the weather, the air pressure, are, obviously, impossible to control, which is how Tony ends up here, in bed in the middle of the day, cursing the sun and the weather and everything in between as his head throbs in a way that immobilizes him.
Or, well, that’s mostly true. Steve would be glad for any company he might find, but if he's being honest with himself, which, in this midnight silence, he is, he wants it to be Tony who finds him.
he is. “Hi.”
Tony heaves a sigh; he can’t bring himself to cry, at least not right now. Instead he just feels… empty.
“Right,” Steve says, nodding and taking a deep breath. He loosens his shoulders and tries to relax his jaw. When had he gotten so tense? “That would be… that would be really nice,” he says honestly.
They settle on an action movie they’ve both seen before, and Steve feels his eyes getting heavy almost as soon as they sit down. Tony is still sitting close to him, closer than he usually does, Steve notes, but he doesn’t let himself dwell on it. The cracked feeling in his chest feels infinitesimally smaller just now, and he doesn’t want to ruin it.
Nighttime is somehow easier and harder at the same time. Easier because he can just
“Is that you?” Steve grins, looking down at the photo still in Tony’s hands. “You started the whole genius thing pretty early, huh?”
It shouldn’t be enough to undo him, spilled tea in the early morning hours, but standing there, looking at the mess on the floor, still haunted by his dream and the countless sleepless nights that lay before it, Steve feels something in his chest tighten and splinter.
Steve shrugs, smiling at him in the mirror. “Just because. Saying good morning.” He shrugs again as his smile widens, and Tony shakes his head.
It’s nice, having someone share the weight.
Steve rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah.”
+1 “You give the best hugs in the world, you know that? You should have an award or something. I’m going to create one. Gold star hugs,” Tony murmurs, wrapping his arms around Steve.
Tony grins. “Guess that depends who you ask. You know how inflated my ego gets,” he teases
But he’s quiet too long, and Tony sits down beside him, close enough that their shoulders touch, and Steve can hear the soft in and out of Tony’s breath. In any other situation, it would be nice.
So far though, none of those things had happened, and more often than not, Steve sat in the kitchen alone, with his tea and his books and his thoughts.
So much for that.
“Of course,” Steve agrees, lowering himself to the floor beside Tony and wrapping an arm around Tony’s shoulder, pulling him into a warm half-hug, and doesn’t pull his away as Tony points out Christmases, newspaper clippings, pieces of a splintered family.
, he doesn’t add.
Tony nods. “’S’always okay if it’s you,” he hears himself say. He’d never imagined this, that he’d be able to let someone in like this, really, all the the way in, the way he has with Steve. But it’s nice, and he realizes a little more every day just how much he was missing all those years he spent pushing people away.
It’s nothing new, not really, but knowing what it is doesn’t necessarily make it any better. Tony had gotten his first migraine while he was at MIT. Not incredibly young, but still, it had thrown him for a loop back then, the sudden inability to see or think clearly followed by the pulsing, painful headache that lasted nearly two full days.
That’s when Tony thinks he might just lose it and cry. Just for the fact of Steve Rogers, here in this dark, lonely room with him on the darkest of days.
Steve nods at Tony’s hum of agreement, then lifts Tony up and into his arms, as easily as if he weighs nothing at all, and carries him to the couch in the common room, depositing them both onto the couch. “Just for a little while,” Steve promises, as if Tony could possibly argue.
“Do you mind it we don’t? At least not right now?” Tony amends. “We can just…” He trails off and gestures at the pictures; he can start by sharing this much with Steve, at least. Talking can come later.
"Apparently,” Tony says, smiling wanly at him.
Now, the kettle is boiling and Steve’s reaching for the tin of tea leaves when he realizes he’s left his book in his room. The thought is enough to distract him, and he misses the container of tea by an inch, sending it careening onto the floor with a crash, coating the tile in a fine layer of leaves. It hadn’t looked like very much in the tin, but spread out all over the kitchen, the mess overwhelmed him.
“Good,” Tony sighs into him, still holding him tight, and Steve can’t help but nod his agreement. Good.
He turns off the stove and slides down to the floor. The mess would have to be dealt with, of course, but more than that, Steve feels like he can’t stand upright for another moment.
, and can handle anything life hands to him, and this is just a blip as he cleans up the mess.
Steve doesn’t say anything else, just slides onto the bed beside Tony, rolling over towards him and scooping him up, his hands huge and soft against Tony’s back. Tony feels himself let out a long-held breath as he settles in against Steve, warm and comforting and familiar beside him.
“Steve?”
“So do you,” Steve reminds him, smiling lightly as he fidgets with his tie. It’s a black silk bow tie, and Tony knows, like he knows so many of Steve’s other likes and dislikes, that Steve hates it, not just the outfit but bow ties in particular, for some reason. Tony, though, can’t help but enjoy the sight of his boyfriend all dressed up and dapper like he is now. It’s a rare thing, and Tony drinks it in, Steve, here, at a gala, decked out in a deep navy suit, blond hair slicked carefully back save for one determined strand that falls charmingly over his forehead.
Steve laughs, so relieved to be home he feels it down deep, a sharp sense a relief that seems to go all the way down to his bones. “I missed you, too,” Steve says into Tony’s hair.
1. “Steve? What are you doing here, you hate these things,” Tony asks, eyes wide and soft in surprise at the sight of him standing in front of him.
“Can we go back to you being happy to see me?” Steve asks, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. “I missed you today,” he murmurs into Tony’s neck. He keeps his face buried there for a long minute, and Tony lets himself enjoy the closeness, this rare moment of PDA that Steve’s allowing himself, and hugs him back tightly.
4. Tony’s looking through an ancient family photo album when Steve finds him on Saturday afternoon. He almost never lets himself come up here. The Tower doesn’t technically have an attic, but Tony has a room, a floor just below the pent house where he keeps things — boxes, photos, memories — he’d rather not have to see every day.
“Hi,” Tony says. He looks down at Steve, taking in the tea leaves, the abandoned kettle and mug, and even in the dark, Steve can see something click into place in his eyes. “You okay?”
“Hey,” Steve says, his voice hushed but not quite whispering; whispering makes everything worse, and it always makes something in Tony’s chest ache, that Steve remembers this small thing.
Tony wouldn’t have thought it possible, but Steve’s smile only grows. “You didn’t have to do that.”
“Does this happen a lot?” Tony asks, pointedly looking anywhere but at Steve.
“Thanks, Tony,” he murmurs, softly.
Steve presses balled fists to his eyes, drags in a ragged breath, and wishes, for the millionth time, that he could have just stayed asleep.
Tony nods. “Sorry,” he says. Steve watches as he makes a careful pile of the tea beside him, raking them up with a finger. “When I got back after Afghanistan, it was months before I could sleep,” he continues. “I built so many unnecessary mods to the suit that I thought Pepper was going to kill me. I mean, I fell asleep in a board meeting before I could admit something was wrong.”
Hollowed out.
5. Tony’s brushing his teeth, idly wondering when Steve would be back from his run, when he looks up and sees him striding through their room and coming up behind him for a hug.
. It all feels impossible.
“Ah, so you’re a pretty big deal then” Steve says, nodding sagely as if he'd just now learned Tony's identity.
He’s pictured the moment enough times. Steve would go down to the lab and ask what Tony was working on. Tony would come into the kitchen for a cup of coffee, and instead find Steve and his cold cup of tea, reading a book in the dim overhead lighting. Maybe they’d both end up in the common room at the same time, hoping to drown out the noise in their heads and hearts with a movie they’ve seen too many times to count.
It’s harder, too, because he hates the dark, hates being alone for these long silent stretches of time, and finds himself wishing, most nights, that someone would find him out here, discover his well-kept secret and just... sit with him.
Before long, he hears the door open, a short, painful strip of light entering the room for a fraction of a second before disappearing again. Then the soft pad of Steve’s feet on the carpet, walking with practiced expertise through the dark room and over to Tony’s bed.
Steve hears the blaring music before he even reaches the garage. He walks into the back entrance, not seeing Tony at first through all the mess. Despite the fact that it's a garage, there's not many cars in the large, open space. There's a fridge in one corner and a huge desk spanning across one wall. The storage cabinets in the room are all open and look like a tornado has blown through, blueprints and tools strewn everywhere. The floor is a minefield of scrap metal, Steve taking care not to trip on anything as he makes his way further into the garage.
Steve smiles and wraps his arms around Tony’s shoulders. “Like that’s ever stopped you before.”
Bucky imparts a very encouraging “Don’t fuck this up” on Tony before kicking him out of the truck. He feels almost completely sober at this point as he ascends up the stairs to Steve’s apartment. He lets himself in as quietly as possible, slowly easing the sliding door shut and locking the latch behind him.
. Steve wonders if he can get a tour of the house post-meal, just so he can gawk over some of the masterpieces hanging on their walls. With the money this family seems to carry, he fully expects that all of them are bonafide pieces.
They split up to take opposite sides of the street, agreeing on ten minutes to build a fort before the snowball war will begin. Of course with Tony’s engineering mind, their snow fort turns out to be the more expert of the two built, but Steve has always felt like an underdog, so why would this be any different?
can’t keep everything together?!”
"I'm very interested," Steve replies honestly, trying not to be offended by Tony's latter jibe. The engineer throws a skeptical look his way. "No, really. I'm all talked out on baseball for the night." This seems to melt Tony by a fraction, Steve earning a subtle nod.
To no surprise, Tony does glance his way. He quirks an eyebrow at him, eyes flickering towards third base.
“You know everything, don’t you?” Steve asks with a laugh. Tony expects the comment to be scathing, but Steve actually sounds amused more than anything. “You really should see it though. It looks like it just started too.”
Tony’s glaring sourly at him, but there’s a humorous twitch at the corner of his mouth. He’s fighting a smile. “Not sayin’ it again. Don’t want you to get used to hearing it.”
“SURPRISE!!!”
Steve closes the folder and Tony allows him to toss it onto the bedside table. He reaches over him to turn off the lamp and slips Tony’s glasses off his face, setting them down on his nightstand. “There’s nothing wrong with a bit of luck and chance in baseball,” he muses quietly as Tony finally lays down, snuggling back against him.
"Fantastic end to the season boys," Peggy starts, clipboard in hand. "We can get more into all the things we need to change when training for the next season starts. For now, you lot deserve a night of celebration. I'll see you all tonight at Kurtzberg’s." She brushes out of the room then as the cheering continues. It's an uncharacteristically short ending statement from her, but Steve’s sure there will be plenty of speeches and discussion tonight at the bar.
“I’m not going to let you do that!”
Steve hums. “And I know how much you love public sex…”
Steve turns to his best friend and smiles. “You ready?” They had seen each other’s lowest lows and highest highs, and it feels right that Steve gets to stand next to his brother who’s never been happier than he is now, and see him marry someone he loves.
Steve and Tony exchange a quick look. “The usual, please,” Steve confirms.
Tony catches him staring and meets him with a very purposeful gaze, tilting his head to the side slightly as his tongue peeks out to swipe over his lips. Steve arches an eyebrow at him, Tony matching it and nodding his head back towards the house. That look alone is almost enough to make Steve go weak in the knees, and not because of his worn out ACL.
He has an air of maturity that goes even beyond his physical appearance. This is a man standing in front of him. Not that a very youthful, early-twenties Tony wasn’t a man in his own right. Steve watched him transition through what were meant to be his most formative years, full of change and mistakes and consequence and growth. The growing maturity was less noticeable when Steve was there to witness it, the development feeling more gradual and suspended in the way that time seemed to slow down whenever they were together. Now, after years apart and trying in vain to forget every plane of his face and curve of his body, the differences strike him with awe.
“Need a hand?”
No one else at the table seems to hear Tony’s comment before the servers are coming back out with soups and salads to choose from, as well as a large pool of melted cheese and slices of perfectly toasted bread. Tony takes a ladle and fills his soup bowl with the cheese mix, and then loads his salad plate up with the bread.
“Rogers, we’re here. Get up. Steve.”
. Maybe this career Steve had felt so much pride for wasn’t over just yet. If Tony had taught him anything over the years, it’s that nothing is ever really
Tony Stark walking towards them
Steve sits down in the stands, answering a few emails on his phone and occasionally glancing up to observe how practice is going so far. Tony walks around between all the positions, surveying the players and occasionally shouting out instructions, or calling a timeout in the game for some kind of teachable moment. He does have to admit that starting their practice off with a little spirited rivalry is far more interesting than having the boys do stamina training or boring drills. The players all even look like they’re having
Tony lifts an elbow to peek up at him and wordlessly pushes a box by his foot closer to them. “Voilà.”
“I have to go,” Steve insists softly, plucking each of Tony’s fingers to open up his closed fist. Rather than push Tony’s hands away, he captures both of them within his own, thumbs smoothing gingerly over his calloused palms. “Let’s keep an eye on our schedules okay? Maybe we can see each other on the road again soon. We’ve got a couple days break next month for a weekend training camp. I might be able to convince Nat to let me duck out and I can come to D.C.”
Peggy and Steve absorb this news in silence. Peggy moves to sit next to Tony’s bed, taking his bandaged hand in her own as gently as possible.
Tony looks directly into the camera as she holds the mic back out to him. Steve knows out of all the people watching from the other side of the TV screen, feeling like they’re making eye contact with America’s Favorite Pitcher, this message is for no one else but him. Tony presses two fingers to his lips, kissing them and holding them out to the camera in a peace sign. “To the future.”
He sighs and throws the blankets off himself, picking through all the items of clothing Tony threw at him. They fit surprisingly well, Steve wondering if these are all just oversized clothes Tony never got altered properly. He dresses slowly, lingering in Tony’s space as he passes through the apartment, wondering if he’ll ever get to experience anything like this ever again.
with him. Messing with his head.
“Wow,” Steve says, unsure why he’s so surprised when he’s seen Tony do much more complicated work. Maybe it’s because whatever he cooked up in his labs were so beyond anything Steve could ever understand, and he couldn’t believe Tony would spend any time, as short as it was, on such a mundane charge. “Thank you. You didn’t have to do that.”
Steve sighs in relief, the rest of the hospital sounds and other voices coming back in tune as well. Another nurse comes in with an additional IV bag, hands him water and a small Dixie cup with pills to down. She offers to place them in his mouth for him but Tony just holds out his “good” hand. “I’m not completely helpless, I can take some damn pills by myself.”
Natasha chuckles. “I guess it’s more Laura’s than his considering he’s not really home to maintain it, but yeah, he does. And they always cook a monstrous amount for dinner, way too much for three adults, two kids, and a baby to eat. We’d love to have you.”
Tony raises his eyebrows, looking a little annoyed. “We’re the last ones off. Let’s go.”
They both stop and turn when they hear a voice call out to them as they pass by an empty intersection. On the street perpendicular to theirs, there’s a small group of five or six kids on a makeshift hill, letting out peals of laughter as they sled down it, with a few off to the side taking on the project of building a snowman that’s already almost twice their height. They’re all still a few yards away, a lone girl broken off from the pack who caught Tony and Steve running by.
“I was a fan favorite choice this year,” he brags loudly. Tony had almost forgotten how awful his timbre was.
Howard laughs. "That cocky brat? Who knows with him. He's set to graduate from MIT next Summer, we'll see if he takes up any interest in playing after that."
"Rogers!" Everyone cheers as he bashfully comes through the door, squeezing past the mingling groups. He can see Bucky waving him over to the bar, holding up a shot glass.
“Your right only suffered a sprain We’ll want to keep it in a brace for a few weeks and limit your useage of it just to insure it heals as normal. Your left however…” She digs around in a folder that appears to be his very thick record, showing him a few X-Rays of the broken bones in his arm, hand, and thumb. “We’ll need to get a cast on it now that it’s had some time to set while you’ve been unconscious. Approximately eight weeks with the full cast, then we can put this type of bracer back on for another six weeks and then go from there. Which is your dominant?”
, not my fucking
He hears Tony snort from beside him, but he doesn’t comment otherwise. His mouth is too full of crab meat to bother, apparently. That, or he was still following Maria’s instruction to keep ill-mannered comments to himself.  “That sounds about right,” Howard huffs. “Tony here always did have trouble with authority.” Tony remains silent, keeping his eyes stubbornly on the table.
Tony takes a second shower when they get back to the hotel, the quick rinse-off with freezing cold water after practice not really doing enough for him. Steam clouds the bathroom by the time he’s finished, drying off and bundling himself in a robe before stepping out into his shared room with Steve. He flicks through his closet, pouring over his options.
It's never ending. Tony stands casually straight now, his hands on his hips in a relaxed manner. “Jesus Christ, is your pitcher ever actually going to do something? Didn’t know it usually took this long to give us a walk.”
Even since they were kids, Steve and Bucky had been able to talk to each other about anything and everything, but now, it seems as if they’re both at a loss for words. There’s no point in scolding Bucky with I-Told-You-Sos or trying to look on the bright side. Best case scenario: the surgery goes smoothly and Bucky goes through enough rehabilitation to gain basic use of his arm, but never be able to throw a ball again. Worst case scenario: He can never use his arm again. Full stop.
His first season playing for the Avengers hadn’t been one for the books. They finished around the top-middle of the league, not even getting close to getting to the post-season championship game that would’ve pitted them against the Irons, who have been at the top of the PCL for the past seven years. Aside from that, plenty of buzz had been generated around the Manhattan-based team for the first time in a while. This season is going much better for them so far, Tony updating the Pythagorean expectation in his head after every game to know exactly where everyone in their league stood, and in turn, be able to predict who would be in the running to face off against the Irons this season.
"The kid can handle a lot of liquor, I know that much. He probably dabbled in some kind of fun fairy dust last night that knocked him on his ass. I saw him this morning and if anything he just looked like he'd been crying."
” He sucks in a deep breath, apparently forgetting that the intake of air is essential when trying to confess your love to someone for the first time. “I didn’t think you needed to hear all of that to know how I feel about you
Steve quickly slams the door shut. "Tony, I just wanted to check on you."
“The real question is: how long has Tony been asking him to shave it off?” Pepper chimes in, pulling another chair over to their table so he can join.
She nudges his foot playfully and drops the subject. Thankfully, no one brings up the assault, his condition, or the World Series. Tony lets Steve and Peggy just talk and fill him in on everything he’s been missing out on the past few months while he isolated himself with drink and work, forgetting the people who ever actually meant something to him. He slips his bandaged hand into Steve’s as he eats, letting the man feed him French fries and wipe ketchup from his chin.
“Strike three! Out!”
So the atmosphere is familiar this season. The entire team is close, and Maximoff is much easier to integrate into their group than the very confrontational Tony Stark. Steve makes a couple of attempts to each out to him, let him know he’s invited to any team outings after practices, or on their off days. The guys normally get together outside of the stadium to grab a beer or just go out to lunch.
His prospects aren’t promising. The six or so people in the bar (including the lone bartender) all turn to look at him with suspicious eyes when he enters. He’s hoping he looks bedraggled enough to not attract any unwanted attention, hands shoved into the pockets of his long pea coat as he slowly makes his way to the bar, scanning the room for any kind-faced civilians. There’s a man sitting at one end of the bar, head lowered and face shrouded by a cap, a middle-aged couple sitting in a booth together with a shared pitcher of beer between them, and two grizzled looking men with grey beards playing darts in the corner. Tony saunters over and takes a seat at the middle of the bar, leaving ample distance between himself and the rest of the patrons. No sense in not at least grabbing a drink while he ponders his options.
You’re acting just like Howard!”
I love you guys so much <3 Enjoy the epilogue.
Bucky shakes his head. “No. I mean, sure, at first it was a little weird just because I thought he had been keeping this secret from me for so long, but I don’t even think Steve realized he’s gay or whatever until things between you guys started. I really don’t care who Steve shacks up with as long as they treat him right and make him happy.”
With two minutes left of ‘93, everyone piles into Tony’s living room, all of them huddled around the TV mounted above the fireplace to watch the ball drop. Tony is towards the back of the group, Steve returning from the bathroom to slide up next to him. The sides of their hands brush together, Tony’s eyes darting around in alert to see if they’re in view of anyone. There’s plenty of discordant noise as everyone carries on conversation and starts talking about the host that year and other unimportant things being flashed about on the screen, no one in particular paying them any mind.
It’s Steve’s turn to be confused now. “What are
He doesn’t know this Bucky guy aside from the stories he’s heard from Steve (and there have been plenty), but for some reason he feels comfortable enough to tell him what happened. “Long story short: A major league team is offering to buy me from the Avengers, but I don’t want to go. Steve kept trying to convince me that I should do it like he didn’t even care if it meant me having to leave.”
He hears a tense laugh from Steve. “That’s okay. I should probably go to bed anyway. You too.”
He finally looks up from his plate to see Steve staring back at him with a blank expression. “Which team?” He asks calmly.
“Took you long enough. What were you doing in there, shaving your legs?”
“Very astute observation, Captain Obvious, you collect any accolades from the Nobel committee for your incredible discovery?”
for my taste. Too old school. That might’ve worked for people like you and Buckle back in the day, but I can’t be playing for a team that’s going to cramp my style.”
Dinner with a family on a farm actually does sound pretty inviting. For as long as he can remember, he and Buck spent every Christmas together even after their families had long since passed. They normally spent it just the two of them holed up at Bucky’s place for the day, but maybe it would be nice for a change of pace. “He actually isn’t far from Kingston either. I think we’d love to come if Clint’s family doesn’t mind.”
Vegas’ own Linden Jacobs is Tony’s third and final victim of the bottom of the Seventh. Jacobs is one of the new players Tony would realistically have reservations for, but he knows he’s a good hitter who tends to hesitate on balls that he thinks will earn him a walk. That’s more than enough info he needs.
Parking around Tony’s complex is a nightmare, Steve rolling down his window to get a better view as he drives by the front door. There’s already a swath of reporters outside, undeterred by the rain, covered in shiny plastic ponchos to try and preserve themselves. Steve turns at the next corner and scans the streets, having to park two blocks away.
He isn’t, not really. Steve still looks woefully
like New York, and Steve seems to appreciate the charms a lot more than Tony.
A time out gets called and medics quickly rush out onto the field. “Buck, Buck, don’t move,” Steve frantically hovers over him, unsure of what to do. He’s gently urged aside by the athletic trainers as they examine Bucky’s arm. Blood is rushing loudly in his eardrums. He can hear Bucky’s voice in an echo, telling them it hurts to move it and no, he can’t bend it that way.
He eventually strays out of the room to roam through the rest of the hotel, occasionally passing by some other players both from the International and Pacific Coast Leagues. He meets a few fans as he ambles about, signing autographs and answering a couple of questions before he finds an excuse to leave and spend some time at one of the many bars on the lower levels. He doesn’t link up with Steve again until it’s time to go back to Cashman.
"I'm ambushing him here," Natasha responded. "If I have to throw a pastry at him, I will."
"Good," she said. "Did he look like he was going to talk to Steve?"
. Was her eye twitching? Her eye was definitely twitching. “Steve, go get your cake. I need a moment,” she said, and waved her hand at him.
Natasha shrugged. She broke off a piece of his overpriced biscotti, popping it in her mouth. He didn’t exactly move to stop her, but Steve scowled all the same. When the line grew smaller, he'd get his cake and eat it all in front of her. “He’s Clint.”
"Because I'm a terrible person," Steve said.
"Of course," she said, not mentioning that she always left a crisp $100 bill on the table, or that she had just decided to build herself a mythical, cryptid-like reputation in this cafe.
"I want you to listen very clearly to what I'm about to say," Natasha said. "You can't stand it when Stark is injured, you fuss over him like a mother hen, you banter with him like you're being paid by the word, you rarely stand a bad word against him, you always look for the best in him, in fact, you actively bring out the best in him, you compliment him every day you get, you flirt with him on the comms, you believe in him, you say you're best friends, but
“Captain Rogers is in the kitchen, sir,” JARVIS informs him. “Shall I get him for you?”
“I…” It would be so easy to say yes. To pretend, like he’s gotten so used to doing, that everything is fine, that he’s
“Yep,” Tony nods. “Or do you prefer red, white, and blue stars, more on brand…” He contemplates, then tightens his hold on Steve, like he’s trying to eliminate even the tiniest fraction of space between them.
3. “What are you making?” Steve asks when he finds Tony in the kitchen. They’d had conflicting schedules for the better part of a week now, and Tony would be lying if he said the sound of Steve’s voice didn’t send a bright spark of joy right through him.
Finishing the cookie that was in his mouth "Miss Erica I swear that Mr. Harrington didn't tell me. I didn't even go to school today because I'm sick." Miss Erica put a finger in front of this face "I don't want to here anymore lies Peter." She sighs "I can't believe this.. Since I can't get you back to school I want you to wait down here in the lobby while everyone else has the tour."
Peter blushes lightly "With me and Wade he's my boyfriend. I'd think it be cool if both my friends and boyfriend get to hang out with each other."
Peter looks up at Clint "Thank you for the soup uncle clint. I'll eat it right away." Clint gives a thumbs up before patting Peter's shoulder before leaving. Pulling the desk close to his bed Peter took the spoon next to the bowl and starts to eat the chicken soup.
Peter places his head against hers "I love you to Makayla." placing her down going up to the counter "Do you have any snickerdoddles Jordie?"
Morgan was a year older than Makayla and tried to act tough to not be scared in front of her friend "Me and mommy were down here to see what the scientists were doing but I heard Makayla crying. So I went to go find her but I lost mommy."
Nat: why not he hurt you and the teacher seems like she's on his side. I wouldn't mind kicking her ass to.

Nat and Clint both waved to all the students and taking a few pictures if asked as the made their way over to Peter "hey my маленький паук! Клинт видел, что с тобой случилось в лабораториях, ты можешь указать, что Флэш, детка? " Natasha says in Russian the other students not understanding a word she says.
"If I say no will you leave him alone."
"N-nothing's wrong miss Ava." Peter responds sniffing more
~~~~~~~
MJ shrugs "yeah. I think I'd be cool with that. Just make sure your dad doesn't follow us."
"It's what friends do. Plus I already have a boyfriend."
Makayla frowns "oh okay.."
Jordie stands up "I'll answer that, I'm the translator for Clint when we have field trips here if anyone asks him questions. Though he can read lips so he'll know what you say I'm just going to translate what he says to you guys." she smiles.
Miss Erica turned to Peter apologizing multiple times before quickly leaving everyone laughing at her. Tony turns to Olivia "mind if I take over Olivia?" he asks
"Petey!" Makayla calls running up to him hugging his legs "Are you here to play with me?" she asks . Peter picks her up "sorry Makayla, I'm still a little sick. See I have this mask on so it won't spread."
Before going back to cuddling Peter "It's okay now baby you're going to be okay."
"Alright now that, that was settled let's get down to some personal labs guys Peter will meet us down there." Tony says as the class got up following him and Olivia.
Lightly laughing Peter shakes his head "No, well... maybe a little bit if you consider the avengers being protective of you from a bully and abusive teacher." he shrugs the other two friends laugh along with him.
"Come on just admit it already Penis! That stupid internship is fake, you know they won't allow high schoolers especially a girl like you!"
"Cool! Be back." Ned responds going over to the symbiote to take a picture with her.
"Well now your banned and if you'll return you will be the most popular guy with security. Stark industries does not tolerate bullying what so ever" Steve says sternly.
Flash believed it though and turned to Peter "Hey Parker when I become a avenger I'll be sure not to show off that much to you!" he says smugly.
Peter could feel his face heating up more "oh no.." he mumbles
"Hey Jordie! Hi Makayla!"
"Your just jealous he gets to work with Mr. Stark!" Ned whips back
" she gives a smile.
Flash gives a smirk "She's a hottie wonder if she's single."
Taking the bag Peter hands the money to Jordie then heads out "cool thanks guys, see you later!" Jordie waves bye "see you at the tower!"
Leaving the tower and going down the street to Jordie's bakery. He loved to go there ever since it opened, he remembered that Jordie said after what happened with Carlton Drake she wanted to just settle down and finish her dream of owning a bakery. Though with a chocolate loving symbiote it's hard to have enough chocolate for recipes.
"W-wait you knew?"
Once getting home Peter was sent straight to bed to rest. Pepper takes the thermometer out of his mouth "hmm 101 degrees. Your sick alright sweetie, it should go down by tomorrow if you rest for today I'll have Clint make you some soup to have later. Just sleep for now." she kisses him on his forehead Peter smiles "thank you aunt Pepper." as she left the room.
he? Did that matter? Did—
“No?”
Why did she even bother? For all her past crimes, it seemed likely that she was just cursed to live with two dramatic idiots for the rest of her life. (Damn it, their drama was starting to rub off on her too, wasn't it?).
“Right,” she said. “You’re not moping, you’re cranky.”
being worried about him."
"Depends," Steve said. He delicately placed the cake plate underneath the coffee cup, and was struck by the oddity of a New York cafe serving food using ceramic dishes.
“If you’re not going to eat it, why won’t you let me?” Natasha asked. She smiled thinly and sat back, sighing like he had personally wronged her. “And you know Clint. He’ll bounce back. All anyone can do is not let him get away with his bullshit for a while."
“A start to what?” Steve asked. “What aren’t you telling me?”
Now Natasha was the one staring at
Clint snorted. "Nope. He locked himself in and won't come out."
Steve sighed. "I know he can," he allowed. He could always believe in Tony like that, trust him. It was simply a fact of life. "Tony's brilliant. He can—he pulls off miracles every week. But it doesn't stop me from worrying."
"Cap," she mimicked.
It was true, he
"You were scared," Natasha stated.
"He really did all that?" Steve asked.
"Put Steve out of his misery," she stated.
"You were worried about him," she said.
“Let me guess, you’re not?” she asked. “Uh huh.”
to have this conversation with you?" he asked, the sudden, contrary act inspiring more petulance. Steve brushed away a crumb from his mouth. "It's not like I can have this conversation with
"No," he said.
"Have you stopped to think that he's avoiding you because you want to talk to him about Whitney Frost?" Natasha countered, just as petulant.
Steve, who had just asked if she wanted to split a slice of coffee cake, blinked and set down his china cup. “Do what?” he asked. Maybe he'd just get the cake without her. It was really only common courtesy that he had asked. Cafe-kickers didn't deserve the daily special.
"Yes you do."
"You're being bribed," she repeated. "Are you going to take it or not?"
But he’d gladly take the subject change. “Haven’t seen Barton around either. How is he?”
"I should really talk to him," Steve said.
Oh. Huh.
"How many times have you told them to get a room?" she asked in return.
"Yes," Natasha said.
"Really?" he asked. "I told you, we haven't—"
Natasha was starting to miss the jungle monsters. At least they knew what was going on, and what to do. "Do I look like I want you to make his funeral stick?" she asked. "I want you to walk up to him and tell him everything you wished you had told him when you thought he was dead."
"But it's not good for him to keep it in to himself! And I need to apologize."
“I’m not moping,” Steve said, with far more confidence than he felt. Had he been moping?
"Fine," she said, and drank the frankly delicious coffee in front of him, leaving behind the mug as she walked away. Natasha could feel Stark's shock all the way back up to her floor.
The coffee cake was a spectacularly great idea. He'd gotten two slices of it (and a thing of biscotti for Natasha), and now Steve was in heaven.
"Don't worry about it. Marketing reference," she said. "Anyway, your mood has improved. Can we talk about your best friend now, or should I wait for you to finish the second slice?"
"Widow," Steve said.
"But you're the one who always tells Stark he can get through it," Natasha said. Her eyes narrowed.
"When you thought the jungle vine monster got to him, how did you feel?" she asked.
"Why not?" she asked.
"Yeah, well, you had me scared for a moment. Tony this and Tony that, what's going on?" Steve asked.
“I actually haven’t seen Tony that much since we came back from Wakanda,” Steve told her, trying to keep the bitterness out of his voice. She probably could hear it anyway, especially since he'd never been one to hide much of what he was feeling. Oh well. They were here already, weren't they? “He’s been doing… things, and I’ve been busy convincing everyone that I’m actually alive.
"What aren't you telling me? Is Tony okay? Is that—"
“Are you just going to deny everything I say?” she asked.
Natasha sighed loudly again. "It's almost as if you think I haven't already taken care of that," she said, and leaned over to look into his coffee cup. It was empty, because Steve had finished it. She made a face at him. "Honestly, Steve, I know dying and coming back to life can cause memory loss, but do you even remember who I am? Quick, what's my callsign?"
"Would you be worried about him even if you were angry with him?" she asked.
"Yeah," Clint said, nodding along. "That's cool you're a Russian-friendly cafe."
"Scared," Steve admitted. "What does this have to do with anything?"
"But you're not," she said.
Steve's heart missed a beat. "I—"
"So?" Natasha asked expectantly.
"What can I do for you, Romanoff?" Stark said, hunched over a gauntlet when she stepped into his workshop. "How's the calibration on your stingers?"
"Why do I get the feeling that the first one's my job?" Clint asked.
Unfortunately, this was not the first time that Steve had come to this conclusion, nor would this likely be the last. Every time that Natasha showed up at his door, she’d smile this terrifyingly pleased smile and every excuse and obligation he had would fly right out of his mind and out the window. Steve was such a sucker.
As if Steve didn't wax rhapsodic to Stark (and everyone) about Stark every damn day. As if Steve hadn't watched every documentary about Stark and Iron Man. As if Steve didn't find every excuse in the book to slip Stark compliments, or call him a genius. As if Steve wasn't—maybe Natasha was looking at this all wrong. If that was the case, she needed another reliable player in the game, someone who could needle Stark into the right position while she took on Steve instead.
, he wouldn't rule anything out.
"Oh. I didn't... it's not that... this is a Russian-friendly cafe! Of course it is. It's just... there's a lot of yelling," the barista said, clearing their throat. Wow, they really had no idea who they were talking to, did they? Clint wasn't wearing sleeves and he had those purple sunglasses on. Natasha was blending in like a normal human being, but there was only so much she could do to hide herself when she was a redheaded Russian next to a tall blond in purple.
, Natasha did not say.
Danvers had once explained to him the difference between horror and terror, right before she had shown him some horror movie. One anticipatory, one reactionary. But never had he understood the difference more than when he had seen the suit be yanked by the vines, and then pulled apart to pieces. Just like he hadn't understood relief so clearly when Tony had shown up in those stupid socks (because his feet had shitty regulation) seconds later.
"Yes, you should," Natasha said.
The barista blinked. They turned to Natasha, hopeful, but she merely glared at them. "Right," they said. "Okay. Cool. Enjoy your coffee." They walked away.
So Steve did...
"Tony all but moved the world for you," Natasha said. "He restarted the team when he thought you died at Red Skull's hands. So when I say that he worries about you the same that you worry about him, I mean it."
"Point taken," Clint said. "So I got Tony to figure it out, what about Cap?"
"I should, but I don't," Steve said. "I mean, it hurts to think that it messed him up, but I should be feeling bad about everything else."
Letting Natasha take him out for coffee was, as Steve was realizing, a spectacularly bad idea. He’d let her bully him into walking through one of the newer, trendier places, and then he’d let himself be baited into this easy back-and-forth. All of this was too much concession on his part, and now he was sitting down in a chair meant for someone half his size wondering when Natasha would get to whatever she really wanted to talk about. And then he would end up regretting everything, hence why this was a bad idea.
"We're going to have to tip extraordinarily well," Clint said a few seconds later. "You know that, right?"
Steve was starting to worry about Natasha. "I just said that."
"Does he?" Natasha returned calmly.
"Fair enough," Clint said, considering. "I'll work something out."
. "Hi. Uh. You're kind of scaring the other patrons... um, here. And, uh. Maybe if you stop snarling at each other? That would... that would be great. Thank you."
"Supersoldier Snickers," Natasha suddenly said. "Ha!"
“Why does it bother you so much?” she asked. “You’re moping, and a moping super-soldier brings the entire Tower down.”
"I have to deal with Steve," Natasha said instead.
"Excuse me?" said a timid voice hovering above the two of them. Both of them looked up at the fearful barista.
thinking, well, he needed to do something about it.
Natasha smiled widely.
: are you sure about that?"
Steve exhaled, hard. The sudden adrenaline spike was crashing into him. "Don't scare me."
"How did you take care of my apology?" Steve suddenly asked, pausing mid-kick.
"Of course it will," Natasha said. "They're sickeningly in love, and as soon as Steve opens his mouth, Stark's going to understand that, now that you've got him thinking about his relationship with Steve. All that's left is setting up a way for them to talk, since Stark's holed himself up, and getting Steve to understand his own feelings."
"He's fine," Natasha said dismissively. He believed her. Okay. He believed her.
"No," Natasha said. "What is it really?"
Hello there,
Steve couldn't breathe.
Just for that, Steve kicked her. And because they were two grown adults that did not engage in childish things, they did not kick each other in relative silence for a minute and a half straight.
"Yes, you do. Think."
"What—oh, you sneaky, conniving spy," Stark said, eyeing the mug with thinly-veiled admiration. He looked up at her. "I've been looking for those beans, thought I hallucinated that cup of coffee last year. What am I doing for you?"
known that, but... it wasn't as if Steve had ever thought about it like that. Thought about how much he meant to Tony. They were best friends. It was a given. And yet, the way Natasha had phrased it was still different, instinctively different. And now that he
Oh for God's sake. Steve picked up the small piece that was left and ate it right then and there. "What if I
“No,” Steve said.
Steve huffed a laugh, and immediately felt bad for it. “Did he tell you it was our fault?”
She looked at him with extreme judgement, and it was nearly cartoonish how high her eyebrow raised. Maybe Natasha was trying to telepathically scold him. Maybe she could already read his coffee cake intent. After the past few years, Steve wouldn’t rule anything out. Hell, after the past few
Stark's jaw dropped. "I'm not killing Captain America!"
“Clint has,” Natasha said, which was just as much of a confession as Steve’s. But something in her voice was off, and Steve couldn’t quite put his finger on what it was.
"Does Tony love me?" Steve asked. His heart did a funny flip.
...and couldn't get past the thought of Tony, desperately trying to avenge his death. Of Tony, and how strangely he had looked at Steve when they had all had breakfast in Wakanda. Of Tony, and the even stranger expression on his face when T'Challa told them about the crown's instability, and how Steve had thrown himself on it like a grenade. Of Tony, and how—
The cheers are as deafening as Thor’s bat finally connects with the ball, sending it to the far corner of the stadium. He takes off around the bases, each stride propelling him forward with impossible power. The ball hits the top of wall, just out of the left fielder’s range, ricocheting off the padded foam and heading back to the infield. The fielder has to make a slight scramble, but manages to fire the ball straight to third base with no hesitation. The fumbling cost him though, Thor touching down on the base just before the ball connects with the third-baseman’s glove.
years older than him, but considering what Tony usually goes for, that’s actually quite young.”
"Steve, please," Tony begs again, his voice lowered now, less forceful. "Just turn around and go. I don't know what you think is going on, but I need you to get out."
“Have you used it yet?”
“You don’t owe him anything. You don’t owe
“Need… more… fucking… drugs,” he grinds out, his own voice sounding garbled and distant.
”. It becomes immediately apparent that “
Steve keeps his gaze so low that once he gets back to the box, he doesn’t see another hand reach for the door at the same time as him. “Oh, sorry— Janet!” He’s surprised to see the woman; He actually hasn’t seen her since the wedding. “It’s good to see you! Tony said you couldn’t make it.”
“I’ll wait right here, sir,” the man in the black suit tells him once they get up to the room, taking his post outside of Tony’s room door.
The doctor is mouthing something to him, examining a fluid bag that is hanging next to him and hooked up to his IV. She calls out the door to someone else. Peggy surges forward now, cupping his face in both of her hands. She’s crying, glistening tears rolling heavily down her cheeks. He reaches up to try and wipe at them with his debilitated hands, re-examining them in the light.
Steve sticks around a bit longer and helps Natasha clean up the slight mess they’ve made of her apartment. As he helps her tidy up and wash dishes, he notices a packed bag near her bed. “Going somewhere?” He asks curiously. Natasha stays very quiet in regards to her private life, but over the years Steve had at least learned that she doesn’t have any living relatives to speak of, and doesn’t ever mention friends or contacts outside of the baseball community.

“Ball three!”
“You did fuck his face up first,” Rhodey points out as he walks over from the kitchen with ice bags for Quill’s developing black eye and Scott’s bruised jaw.
Steve scoffs, letting Bucky fiddle with the little flower pinned to his lapel that was already perfectly straight
She nods with a pleasant smile before clearing her throat and tipping her head towards Steve. “Well, don’t be rude. Aren’t you going to introduce us?”
“What exactly am I pretending to be?” Tony crosses his arms, sitting back in the booth. “Please, tell me since you’re such the

He stares down at the steaming liquid in his mug, rotating it slowly between both hands. “I told you, the camera—”
“No,” Tony rasps, sinking down onto the floor, drawing his knees close to his body. “I’m not gonna fucking
," Natasha growls sarcastically. "You're thirty minutes late, and that means you stay an extra thirty minutes."
The girl bites her lip. “I’m sorry, I’m not at liberty to— Hey, wait! Sir!”
“If you decide to go out, please don’t go alone. Watch out for each other so I don’t have to, alright?” She points between all three of them now before grabbing her bags. “Now I will be lounging by the pool if anyone needs me. Please don’t,” She slips her sunglasses from the top of her head onto her nose and leaves them to their own devices.
Most of them head back into the interior of the box to refresh themselves on drinks and food, Steve’s knee making him antsy enough to warrant a quick walk after staying seated for so long.
“Clint, you’re just changing the volume now.”
He smiles and strokes a thumb over Tony’s cheek, watching his eyelashes flutter. “So… You had a crush on me before we knew each other?”
For the past five years he’s been helming the ship of the Avengers alongside Carol who took over as owner when Fury passed seven years prior. When Natasha had initially taken her maternity leave, they brought in Grant Ward who had apparently been a very subpar Coach according to Carol. When it finally came time for Natasha to retire, they were struggling to find a suitable replacement and weren’t looking to get burned again. As far as baseball went, it was a rather quick turnover time for the entire managing staff of the team. Fury, Janet, and Natasha had been a united and well-established front for so long that once the power had shifted onto Carol, Steve, and Natasha’s shoulders, they knew they had big cleats to fill. The Avengers had risen to such prominence under their leadership that once things started to shift, everyone questioned if this would be the end of a well-run legacy.
," the center fielder hisses, ramming his shoulder into Tony's.
“Steve, wait!” he hears his captain calling after him, already disappearing around the corner as he makes his way to their locker room.
“Not everyone feels the way Pierce did, and even some of them back then may have changed their mind. One day they’ll
They enter the bustling lobby, discordant sounds coming from every direction from slot machines, people proclaiming their victories and mourning their losses loudly from table to table. Tony debates for a moment whether or not he should just go straight for the Jewel Nightclub upstairs, but something makes him think Steve won’t go for that. At least not just yet.
Steve sighs and picks up said takeout boxes, carrying them over to the barren living room, looking down at Tony who’s got an arm thrown over his face. “And our tables didn’t rank as essential to you either?”
Feeling sobered up by his own nerves but still bolder than usual thanks to the liquid courage, Steve returns to the main ballroom, looking around for Tony. All he has to do is get to him before he heads up to his hotel room... the biggest problem is that Steve doesn't see him
Outside of the stadium, things are less productive. Tony throws himself into his training and his studies of their team so he’s completely wiped by the time he returns to his empty home. As long as he’s focusing on other things, he doesn’t have to think about how lonely he is. It’s something he’s practiced for most of his life, but the past couple of years lulled him into a false sense of security. The emails between himself and Steve grow less and less frequent. Tony forgets his promises to call Steve back, and when he does remember, it ends up going to voicemail. The Avengers are plenty busy as well, treading water near the top of the pack for the Triple-A so that they can hopefully go to the Championship once again. Their stolen days together turn into a few hours at a time. It’s harder to find dates where their away games match up in nearby cities. Their times being able to see each other become more spaced out from weeks to months. No one can be at fault for their relationship slipping during the height of both of their seasons.
The team’s overall line-up hasn’t changed much this season. They lost only two players to retirement last season, and other than Tony the only new addition is a kid out of the premier league, a pinch runner, Pietro Maximoff. His position only being to sub out base runners when needed, he isn’t going to see every single game, but he’s easily the fastest runner Steve has ever seen in either league. It’s hard to get a career off the ground if you aren’t a fully well-rounded player, but even if Maximoff wouldn’t get recognized at the same skill level as those in the Majors, he’s a great addition to their team with his particular skill.
“I said I don’t gamble, I didn’t say I don’t play Poker,” And Steve, the little shit, actually flashes him a cocky grin before accepting a fresh refill from Lana.
Anxious groans rise up from the team when the Clippers score, bringing the score to 3-2. Victor is convinced it’s a bullshit call, but no one can confirm nor deny as they’re all having trouble seeing exactly what’s going on when they’re all crowded around the fuzzy little TV.
Although seeing Steve standing at the front of the line-up with his shoulders squared and a determined spark in his eye tells him that maybe his newfound love for the sport has a different source.
The man walks forward, glaring sharply at his players who mutter their apologies and hurry off to the bus, Hammer shooting him one last smarmy look before he goes. Tony steps closer now, staring at his former coach in surprise. “What are you doing here? I thought Hansen was the coach for the PCL’s team this year.”
Tony rolls his eyes at the parental tone. “I’m just going to grab drinks with some buddies.” He chews on the inside of his cheek, wondering if he’s obligated to invite Steve along as his roommate for the weekend. It feels a little rude bringing it up and not inviting him, but since when did Tony care about not being rude to his Captain? “I won’t be out too late. And I’ll… limit myself,” he grudgingly reassures. Really, he should be allowed to drink as much as he wants. He doesn’t even have to worry about running drills, which would easily be the culprit of causing him to lose his lunch all over the field.
Steve jolts out of the memories suddenly, snapping his eyes open to meet total darkness. There’s a brief panic that everything that happened last night was actually all a dream, his deepest desires he didn’t realize he had coming true. He reaches out and gropes along the sheets, feeling nothing but a cold, empty space next to him.
They stare at each other tensely for a few moments, but Steve is the first to bow out. Tony is still glaring at him as he cups his face and leans in to kiss him. Tony turns his face away, Steve’s nose rubbing gently against his cheek. He attempts to coax Tony back into a kiss, but he’s steadfast in his stubbornness, letting Steve kiss along his jaw and mutter his. “I love you”s against his ear. He does his best to stand his ground, but his obstinance no match when Steve pries his scarf away from his neck and presses his warm lips there. Tony feels his pulse quicken beneath his mouth, a soft sigh escaping him as he tilts his head back.
“He’s just leaving the Avengers because he hasn’t been able to make kissy faces at Steve from the dugout the past few years!” Clint crows, coming up from behind to wrap his arms around Tony and start laying loud, smacking kisses all over his cheek. It didn’t take long at all for him to get to his normal, happy level of drunk. With most of Natasha’s family and friends being Russian, and Bucky’s company being, well, like Bucky, the wedding bar is fully stocked and the drinks have been flowing freely.
Tony’s pupils are blown wide, his eyes almost looking completely black in the lighting, the occasional shine of golden brown flickering into view from the firelight. There’s a desire in his eyes that Steve has never seen anyone fixate on him in a
Steve has to raise his hands up again, wishing he could physically block Tony’s words from reaching him. “Jus— Hang on— This is too much to unpack right now,” he shakes his head in irritation. “This doesn’t make any sense.”
Tony hesitates before getting out, turning to look at his driver for the night. “I feel bad you had to come all this way just to drop me off and drive back home. I can pay—”
Plenty were still loyal though, and showed their support, that number of people growing with each passing day. The world got a lot more tolerable with each year that went on, something Steve told himself time and time again as more of a comfort and a hope, never really believing it until he could see the change happening around him. They released a simple statement that he and Tony would be able to work together and set aside their relationship to be complete professionals, but there would always be people trying to tear them down.
thing, for obvious reasons. I can’t be open and honest with who I really like or my life would be over, and I also can’t expect anyone to keep things a secret so… I just don’t do things to get attached.” He shifts slightly, looking over his shoulder at Steve. “I think you shouldn’t overthink it. Things are the same between us as they were before, they’re just a little more fun now. Let’s just keep things on the down low, enjoy what we’ve got, and not let anything get too serious beyond that, yeah?”
Tony can’t stand to look at him any longer. He storms past Steve and grabs his coat off the rack, scooping up his car keys off Steve’s mail table by the door.
Tony’s brain supplies. Stellar Isolated Power stat aside, he can’t hit what he can’t see coming.
Steve takes a beat or two just to stare at the woman. He knows it’s not a joke, but the statement alone he just can’t take seriously. “Janet… I don’t know the first thing about managing a team...”
“Hey,” Bucky grips his shoulder, giving him a little shake. “What’s say we get out of here? You’re not looking like you’re in the mood to celebrate.”
He groans, squeezing his eyes shut and curling in on himself. So it had all been a dream, some sick fantasy Steve had kept holed away somewhere in the deep recesses of his mind. He chases the memories, clinging to them to desperately try to get them to stay even though he knows how quickly dreams evaporate into nothing tangible.
, Steve.”
Tony stares in disbelief. There are so many variables in everything requested of him. Sure, Tony could possibly get the two outs as a shortstop, but depending on how many players they get at bat, Tony might be in a poor position with outs against him by the time he steps up to the plate. It’s not impossible, but it is improbable. Tony doesn’t like those odds.
during the pre-season.”
Steve can't breathe properly again until he's in the elevator. He doesn't hit any buttons, just stands alone in the tiny metal box, clinging to the support bars. He isn't sure what happens next. Does Tony come charging out to explain himself and tell Steve it was some big misunderstanding? A well-orchestrated practical joke at his expense?
“Yeah, I think I worked up quite the appetite after all that,” Tony grins. “What’re you thinkin’, Lucky Blue?”
He tears down the street in the Shelby Cobra, bitter because he started driving it more just because he knows it’s Steve’s favorite out of all of his cars. He presses his foot down further on the gas, eyes watering and pulse racing as the needle of the speedometer slowly climbs. He cranks the volume dial as high as it will go as the car tears out of the city. He’s surprised he doesn’t get pulled over on the bridge as he crosses into Jersey, hops on the highway, and just keeps going north.
Tony’s jovial expression flickers for a moment, letting the weight of Steve’s question settle in on him. He sits up, white powder still clinging to his jacket. “I don’t know,” he answers honestly. “I don’t really do the
“No,” Janet interrupts him with an apologetic smile. “You’re having the meeting with all of us today. Please, shut the door.”
Things changed after Buck's injury, whether the two of them liked it or not. The stress and pressure of being in the limelight didn’t help the UCL tear, so Bucky moved upstate. It's not like Steve could be mad or even betrayed by his best friend's decision. It was for the best, and being out of the public eye is what he needed. They still visit each other a few times a month when they can, and Bucky is always invited to attend Steve’s games, though there are times when the retired player can’t bring himself to step back into the stadium, even just to watch. Steve doesn’t blame him for that either.
about how you two got together. I’ve been dying to know and Tony’s
It’s a solid hit with the bat, the ball coming right back towards Tony. It bounces once on the ground before he jumps forward to catch it. He knows he has the chance to get it to first and get a possible out, but he instead pivots in the opposite direction and fires the ball to third.
to pretend he’s not entirely repulsed by the unprompted conversation. Everyone is bustling around the locker room in preparation for their first exhibition game, no one noticing the sharp line of tension between the two.
With suspicion only rising, Tony does as is asked of him, a foreboding sense that closing this door is sealing his fate in a way. He crosses the room, eyes flickering between the three figures. He vaguely recognizes the man in the nicer suit, the one who had been sitting in his own seat while his colleagues shared the couch. He steps forward first, holding a hand out. “Alexander Pierce. It’s nice to finally meet you, Anthony.”
“He’s probably used to things being made about Tony,” Howard sighed, dragging a finger along the rim of his glass.
Tony sighs, a little frustration leaking through his offhandedness. “You’re probably right about that. I just wanted to tell you that I’m still a little surprised too. I’ve always been pretty impulsive though, huh?” he tries to smile, but it quickly fades when it goes unreciprocated. “I didn’t plan on playing baseball ever again, even if I wasn’t barred from being drafted to a team for the remainder of my broken contract with the Knights. But then I… I heard you were retiring and that this would be your last season playing. Something… I don’t know, something told me it was time to come back and make things right.”
