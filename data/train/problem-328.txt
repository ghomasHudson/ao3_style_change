Whatever Sherlock’s planning to do, or when he’s planning to do it, John doesn’t know.
Maybe Mycroft was wrong, for once. Maybe caring isn’t so bad after all.
“He was high before he got on the plane,” is Mycroft’s helpful input. Sherlock imagines punching his brother square in the jaw.
Their first Christmas together was spent in a cramped stairwell in an abandoned building.
Sherlock now knows, from what John’s told him, that John spent that particular Christmas at Harry’s, an awkward affair that John doesn’t like recounting the tale of. (All Sherlock’s been able to gather from drunken snippets John’s let slip over the past couple of years is that the evening ended in a blazing row, a conciliatory Just Dance-off on Harry’s crappy Wii, and a disproportionate amount of mulled wine.) Sherlock’s one regret about this is that he hadn’t thought to ask for pictures.
time I've been almost choked to death on your account?"
, John!”
,” Sherlock said, aware he wasn’t making sense and not caring in the slightest. He tugged John closer, tilting his head down until his lips found John’s.
(He keeps these thoughts to himself, though. He rather thinks he’ll let Sherlock navigate this particular case by himself.)
Next to him, Sherlock fidgets on the sofa, then takes a large sip of the scalding tea and coughs. “That’s –
Mycroft, he reflects bitterly, as he pockets the squash ball, would be proud if he could see him now.
“Y – yes, two.” Sherlock simply stands and watches as John does the same with the second sugar packet.
” Sherlock spluttered. (Now she’d even reduced his mental capacity to one-word responses. The day was just getting better and better.)
“John,” Sherlock calls, from his spot on the sofa.
Sherlock startled and veered away from him without finesse, slamming his elbow against the edge of the table and knocking a stack of papers to the floor with his other arm.
He raises a hand to his own neck, slots his fingers against the faded imprint of Beppo's hand, where they'd been crushing his windpipe into submission less than three hours ago.
Mycroft’s heart clenches; he has failed in his duty to protect his baby brother. “In time, Sherlock. But for now, you would do well to focus on your studies. Forget about
A muscle in John’s jaw works. (Sherlock wonders what John’s not saying.) “You bastard,” he finally settles on, voice low but steadily increasing in volume as he continues, “You –
He pauses at the sound of chairs being scraped back abruptly; a glance up shows both Sherlock and Lestrade on their feet, each hurriedly throwing on their jackets (well, windbreaker for Lestrade and a dramatic, billowing bat-cape for Sherlock).
” Watson is asking of Holmes now, as the pair pick their way over the craggy rocks, towards dry land.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Sherlock murmurs, after a beat, eyes fixed on the glimmering lights across the river.
?” John laments rather loudly, dropping the knife dramatically on the cutting board, then starts as she pinches his arm, “
, John!”
“Heh,” Sherlock says, swallowing quickly. He glances away from the body to look at John, which is a mistake, because his pupils are dilated and his tongue comes darting out to wet chapped lips at this precise, inopportune moment.
“Any new cases on the website?” John asked this morning, bending slightly in order to read the laptop screen over Sherlock’s shoulder.
From their first meeting at Bart’s, to moving in with him, to killing the cabbie, John Watson has proved an enigma. Intriguing, exciting and brimming with possibility. Sherlock quashes the voice in his head that sounds suspiciously like Mycroft’s, telling him to back off before he becomes emotionally invested. Instead he glances at John, who’s not only stayed but has killed a man for him tonight –
“John, there’s something –” Sherlock says, and something in his voice must alert John to his current state, because John’s gaze snaps to meet his. Sherlock releases a shaky breath; behind his back, he’s gripping his own wrists so tightly his hands have gone numb. “– something I should say, something I’ve meant to say always, and then never have.”
Back in the flat, Sherlock spends the rest of the evening watching from the sidelines, as John putters around making first tea, then herbal tea, then giving up and pouring brandy for Sarah, who’s sitting in John’s customary armchair with an orange police-issued blanket draped around her shoulders.
?” The expression on Sherlock’s face must hold certain comic potential, because John laughs, a helpless chuckle that exposes the line of his throat and Sherlock
, Doctor Watson? I would have thought, after the years you spent in Kandahar saving people from this sort of thing, you wouldn't be quite so quick to-"
He lowers the cup to find both Sherlock and Sandy Hair – Lestrade? – gaping at him. John clears his throat, nestling the drink back into its saucer. “Sir, this
, and
Sherlock raises those pale, almost translucent eyes to his, lets them flicker down to John’s mouth, and John wonders what he’s thinking, wonders what those lips would feel like against his own. “No need, John. I – this – it’s fine.”
“What? Oh.” Molly stares forlornly at the botched design, which does, as it turns out, bear a rather striking resemblance to a penis. “I’ll probably have to chuck it now.”
"You're not worthy," John hisses, yanking Mycroft closer by the knot of his tie, "To call yourself Sherlock's brother. You're not worthy of calling him his
"John, I -" he says, and pauses, because he made a promise to himself on the autopsy table, that if he ever made it out, he'd leave nothing unsaid. Leave John all the notes he's been too much of a coward to leave, before.
MYCROFT:
. Turn the damn thing off.”
“I’m a doctor, let me through,” he hears John shout, disoriented from his collision with the biker but still determined, still loyal to a fault. “He’s my friend,
” Watson declares matter-of-factly, as Moriarty gets on his knees, looking extremely put-out. “
Sherlock looks at John, at his unassuming form and out-of-place moustache, and remembers him sending Moriarty over the edge mere minutes ago.
He gets his answer when, at the man's signal, Mary thumbs the safety off, the sound sending phantom echoes of pain lancing through his chest as his body remembers the bullet it had taken.
“Yes, I’m – I’m fine. Dinner’s perfect, John, I –
“Ah, sorry,” he says, but Sherlock, staring rapt with concentration at his screen (on which he’s pulled up maps), doesn’t seem to have noticed.
this. You stay here if you want, on your own.”
“It’s fine, really.” Sherlock finally releases his hold on John’s wrist, flashes him a small, if tight-lipped, smile. He gestures to Lestrade, who’s now looking more amused than anything, watching their exchange with folded arms and a knowing smirk. “As he said, we’re in a bit of a hurry.”
“How ’bout tonight?” John asks nonchalantly, “Does tonight work for you? We could celebrate your success in solving this case. I’ll even wear the uniform – you’d like that, wouldn’t you? I’ve seen your face whenever I pull the Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers card, Holmes.”
“Surely Scotland Yard haven’t deteriorated so far that they haven’t taught you alibis can be manufactured,” Sherlock says archly. (The cops, John’s mind grounds him, rather mournfully, back to reality. Nothing half as exciting as covert MI-6 ops.) He watches, still behind the coffee machine, as Sherlock plucks Lestrade’s pen from his hand and scratches something on the page in front of them. “Michaels has a long history of a gambling addiction and an equally long history of being an upstanding, reputable business man. It wouldn’t have been a hardship for Pyeterson to coerce him into helping with the cover-up.”
Is there proper etiquette when it comes to mornings-after with your best mate, right after you spent the previous night watching your gay Victorian counterparts make out on the telly? If so, John would dearly love to know.
, Mrs Hudson."
"What happened, after -" Sherlock says, feeling less like his throat's being split in two.
“Yes, of
"I -" Sherlock says, voice tight and pained at the reminder of the mistakes he's made, the time he'll never be able to make up to John. "This was different, if I'd told you you would have-"
different: Sherlock’s the one doing the leaving this time, instead of behind left behind. (Somehow the thought does nothing to console him, at the thought of the endless, John-less expanse of time stretching ahead of him.) Sherlock is shaken out of his reverie when his phone chirps with a text from Moriarty.
“I know a good Chinese place around the corner,” he says, swiftly recovering.
to get us caught?” Sherlock hissed, tugging John back as his frenetic pacing threatened to blow their tenuous tree-cover.
He was let out of the precinct and given a rather hefty sum of cash (courtesy of Mycroft) along with a formal pardon from the Lebanese police. He bought a navy blue scarf at the first shop he came across, wound it around his neck despite the heat, and tried to imagine that it was John’s scarf (John’s touch) resting against his skin.
No response comes from Sherlock beyond a telling hitch in his breath and the erratic rise and fall of his shoulders.
And because he so rarely does anything else where John is concerned, Sherlock looks.
“Yes, and he’ll have a latte,” the regular says in his deep baritone (Molly swoons a bit) and, having already deposited the correct amount of change on the counter, turns and motions for his companion to follow him towards his usual corner.
They reach the dock at the same time, and as if by some unspoken consent that passes between them, Sherlock tackles Michaels from the side whilst John lunges at the Supplier-Murderer, as he’s now known in John’s head.
“And you’re doing this because…?” Sherlock asks, still not looking entirely convinced as he stares at their joined hands.
Watson continues probing Holmes with questions about Lady Carmichael, until at length Holmes says waspishly, “
With that he stalks out of Sherlock's sight and pulls a lever, and it's with mounting fear that the facts coalesce into a horrific picture in Sherlock's head. The stench of decay mixed with sterilization, the metal autopsy table he hadn't known he'd been lying on, and now, with the lever pulled, the roaring of what must be the cremation chamber behind him.
“You machine!” John shouts, the words reverberating in the sterile air of the laboratory, before piercing with finite precision Sherlock’s rib cage and lodging deep in his heart.
Watson. Then, coming back to himself, he smirks. "Is that a Browning L9-A1 in your pocket, John, or are you-"
“Good luck, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, a wan smile flickering at his lips.
MYCROFT:
Sherlock twitches, but doesn’t move away. “In this case, possibly both. And they’re right, John,” Sherlock says, twisting his hands together in his lap, “They’re right.”
"Now, where were we?" Smith murmurs, picking up the switchblade and flipping it, over and over again, until it's a blur of silver in the harsh fluorescent lighting. "Oh, yes." He catches the blade and slides it (gently almost) over Sherlock's cheek.
Something in his expression must give him away, because the next moment –
The voice is insidious, and it wraps around Sherlock like the poison fog from Dartmoor.

“Of course,” says Mycroft, the gravity of the situation accentuated by the readiness with which he agrees.
“Do what?”
“So, have you heard?” John asks later that night, after Ridley’s been apprehended and placed in a holding cell in Scotland Yard. “Apparently we’re in a film.”

SHERLOCK:
Sherlock makes a muffled noise, halfway between a sob and a hysterical laugh, as Holmes injects himself and slips into a hazy, drug-induced hallucination. John wonders if now would be a good time to switch the telly off, because the sex talk during the stakeout was fine, but this – this is knocking down every single wall Sherlock’s ever built up around himself and John’s fairly certain that if he could, he’d be able to hear Sherlock’s Mind Palace crumbling.
He whirls, hands coming up to frame John’s face as he kisses him, much to John’s surprise and everyone else’s consternation.
“No, you don’t,” Sherlock says forcefully, shoulders tense and shaking as he struggles out of John’s grasp.
“I –” John says, heart clenching at the self-deprecation he hears in Sherlock’s voice. “You’re not an –”
“Here, see for yourself,” Anderson says, pulling out his smartphone and typing something into the search engine. He hands John the phone after a few seconds. The first thing that assaults John’s eyes is the title of the article, splashed in bold print across the top of the page:
“Sherlock…” John says slowly, wondering how the hell his brain didn’t connect the dots half a minute sooner. “Who did I just text?”
“We’re not naming our daughter after you,” John says adamantly, eyes sparkling with something like fondness. It’s the closest they’re going to get to how they were five years ago, to high-speed chases down London backalleys and dead cabbies and dinners at 2am.
“You’re in love with me?”
“Hi, welcome to Stamford’s Coffeehouse,” he vaguely hears Molly say to the customers, “How can I help?”
He decides to take a chance.
He opens his eyes, and isn't surprised to find he can't lift his head any more than an inch. The last thing he remembers is stopping for a pint at John's favourite pub after the case (a mere 7, but Mycroft had asked and lately, he's not been in much of a position to refuse his brother anything). He tries moving his hands, and succeeds in twitching a finger or two; whatever he's been given, it's starting to wear off.
He wonders why he ever thought watching their fictional lives transposed into an alternate Victorian setting would ever be a good idea. It’s hitting a bit too close to home, and neither he (nor Sherlock, judging from how far he’s sunken into their sofa) are comfortable with it. Maybe should just turn the telly off.
“Yeah, but still.” John sounded unconvinced.
“John?” Molly says, as he fairly stomps behind the counter, beelining straight for the jam jar, and there’s something far too knowing in her tone. “John.”
Happy birthday, my dear. Have the best day, year and life. Love you to the moon and back, always x
December found Sherlock standing awkwardly in the corner of their (his, now) flat, pretending to talk to Molly as he watched John and Mary across the room.
Sherlock frowns. “That you should re-assess your lifestyle choices?”
John nods at him, and it feels right. Because this time John isn’t standing across the road, watching Sherlock fall to his death. This time John’s by his side, and besides, what could go wrong?
"What do you want," John spits out, his strained voice belying his indifferent tone.
weird though. He’s been here every day of every week for months, then suddenly he shows up with the police and he’s gone for 12 days? What if he’s disappeared –”
“That I should – label them properly?” Sherlock asks. He’s still holding the Petri dish protectively, cradling it to his chest like a child would a pet.
Sherlock peers around the doorway of their kitchen. He’s pushed his goggles up and there’s a smear of ash high on his cheek. “What?”
He very carefully avoids looking at Mycroft as he says so, aware of the noticeable tell in his hammering pulse, in the hands clasped in his lap that can’t seem to stop trembling. Thankfully Mycroft keeps his mouth shut and quietly exits the room, leaving him alone with John.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Idiots, the lot of them. It was hardly my fault Beppo was being so horrendously obtuse and careless with the murder. The
It might as well have been the fifth of November for all the fireworks lighting up behind Sherlock's closed eyelids, and he's never been a fan of poetry, but
“Alright, then, I’ll leave you boys to it,” Angelo says, winking not-so-discreetly at John once more, before turning and bustling back to the kitchen.
Looking at the words, Sherlock smiles helplessly; the tears he’s been holding back run down his cheeks.
. “For the Chinese,” is what comes out instead.
John doesn’t ask, he simply says, “You’re welcome,” and places a hand on Sherlock’s knee, because they’ve come
Sherlock wonders what John’s reaction would be, if he does tell him. His Mind Palace plays out the three possible scenarios:
John cranes his neck to look inside the kettle. It’s conspicuously empty, although it does smell rather faintly of fish.
Molly sighed. “You poor thing. Still pining over John after all these years.”
His hand closes around the ties of his Christmas-themed work apron and in one fluid motion he springs to his feet and flings himself forwards, looping the ties around the man’s neck from behind and yanking until he chokes, the guns clattering to the ground as his hands come up to scramble for purchase. Just as John’s beginning to worry that he’s getting dangerously close to asphyxiating the man, Sherlock resolves the problem by picking up one of the guns and knocking him out with the flat of it.
“Listen,” she said, laying a hand on his arm, “I might know a thing or two about dealing with unreturned, ehm,

MI-6 operative groans, sliding a hand down the side of his face in abject despair, “Let this go for once, will you. Maybe you haven’t noticed, but we’re a little short on time.”
He solves Emelia Ricoletti’s case, gets Sir Eustace killed in the process, and predicts what Moriarty’s next move will be in this game of theirs. Throughout it all John stays a constant, steady presence by his side (not counting the time he moved out of their rooms to live with Mary), and successfully banishes Moriarty, freeing Sherlock from the clutches of his own mind.
“What the hell is this?” John says, glancing up at Anderson incredulously. “Is this a joke?”
” Moriarty shouts with a demented glee, hands fisted in Holmes’ lapels.
his mind protests, unhappy.
Sherlock blinks, looking dazed and unsure of himself, though he makes no move to pull away. “John, I –”
Sherlock frowns at John’s poorly stifled laughter, swiping a tongue experimentally at his lip until the foam’s gone. “No,” he finally says, once he’s de-stached, “Not a bad day at work. Guess I just really needed y– needed the caffeine.”
“Bad day at work?” John asks, commiserating.
“Well,” Molly says, clearly shaken in the wake of the two men’s absence, half-made cappuccino held in hand, as another stray coffee bean clatters from the top of John’s head to the floor, “Maybe you shouldn’t have suggested he add that much sugar to his coffee. It’s clearly messed with his head.”
,” Holmes says, eyes alight with affection. (It makes John’s heart ache just watching the comfortable familiarity with which Holmes addresses Watson. Why can’t he have this in real life?) “
“Sherlock,” John cuts across him. He weighs his words carefully, then says, “Tell me honestly,
John glares. “What –”
–” he spits the word out like it’s poison, “– because you could only be happy with Mary if I was gone, and since there is no universe in which I can fathom being able to live knowing you’re married to her, I decided on what I thought was the best course of action.”
“Yeah, we got divorced a ways before Christmas, after the whole – um,” John mimes (rather poorly) cocking a gun and firing at Sherlock. “Oh, also because Mary’s had an affair – the baby’s not mine, either.”
again at all.)
With a sigh of great exasperation, Sherlock thrusts the phone at John. “I need you to type something for me. Now.”
Sherlock glances at it, unimpressed. "I'll have to decline, I'm afraid. Your drugs are still doing a rather wonderful job at the moment."
John looked up from where he’d been staring blankly at the worn tabletop in front of him. His eyes were bloodshot and there was a minute tremour in his hand.
His hands are trembling where they're loosely clasped in his lap, and it could just be the nicotine talking but John really,
John blinks up at him, golden lashes fanning cerulean blue. “Help you?”
“Yes,” John says, still watching Sherlock.
"I wasn't sending him to his death, Doctor Watson," his brother replies easily, setting the cup back in its saucer and steepling his fingers in front of his lips. "It was a mission to Eastern Europe that he may or may not have returned from, depending on his own skills of preservatio-"
“Sherlock, did I just text a bloody
The meeting on St. Bart’s roof is confirmed, the necessary arrangements with Mycroft made, and when Moriarty shoots himself in the head Sherlock knows what he has to do.
“Unfortunately, I do,” Sherlock says lightly, his chest feeling even lighter, and Mycroft can go sod himself because it’s worth it, all of it, all the pain, if only because it’s led to this moment with John.
“Cocaine,” Sherlock murmurs, an appreciative glint in his eye (John’ll have to remember to ask him about that later) as he inspects the dozens upon dozens of neatly arranged packets.
” Moriarty shouts, aiming a kick at Holmes’ abdomen. “
John pauses where he’s pretending to wipe down the counter and exchanges a glance with a slightly flustered Molly.
” He punctuates the last few words with more kicks, until Holmes is curled in on himself and gasping in pain.
Last Christmas was one of the best (and worst) experiences of Sherlock’s entire life, which was saying something.
ing whenever John makes a typo and has to backspace. John is torn between rolling his eyes and asking Sherlock to just do it himself, and taking a step backwards into the welcoming warmth of Sherlock’s (admittedly scratchy) wool overcoat. Wanting to do the latter has nothing at all to do with the fact that this close, he can smell the heady cologne the other is wearing.
“What?”’
“I know it’s hard, Sherlock,” Mycroft says, crouching down in front of his brother. (He grimaces and tries not to think how the meticulously pressed line of his suit will be disrupted.) “But you must remember Redbeard. The world is populated with idiots, and there’s no need to concern yourself with them. You are better than him, Sherlock, and you deserve better still.”
“What?” Sherlock says, thrown. The rest of his hastily prepared speech eludes him.
Sherlock sniffs, lifts his hands and inspects the bandages over his burns. "Please, the thing wasn't even heated properly. What are these, first-degree?"
for you, is it?” John snaps, venom in his voice. He looks angrier than Sherlock’s ever seen him, and that’s including the time he came back from the practice and found Sherlock chainsmoking in the middle of their living room.

better.”
He took a sip from the mug of tea he was holding and gagged; he’d somehow managed to add salt instead of sugar. He turned and discreetly poured the drink down the drain. Next to him, Molly tutted, and decided to take pity on him.
The doorbell tinkles as the doors are pushed open, and John spins so quickly on the ladder he almost over-balances. His face falls when he sees the newcomers: a flushed, hand-holding, umbrella-sharing couple. He turns back to the tinsel, seized with a sudden urge to strangle himself with the decorations.
"Just," John says, tight-lipped and worried, and Sherlock's stomach plummets.
John relents, turning back to the screen to see Moriarty about to push Sherlock off the cliff’s edge, into the yawning abyss of the falls. “
“Nngh,” Sherlock says intelligibly from beside him. John chances a glance; Sherlock’s ears are burning red as he hurriedly raises the mug to his lips and drains it.
John grins, making his way to Sherlock’s recently-vacated table. He doesn’t know what he’s expecting to find, but there, propped against the empty cup, is a business card on which is printed in elegant, flowing script:
John stops walking; the stairs creaking as his weight shifts. “Yeah?”
“Two, right?” John says, tearing into one and dumping the contents into the coffee without waiting for an answer.

John pulls back far too soon, practically wrenching his lips away, and Sherlock blinks, hope and disappointment warring for dominance in his heart.
Sherlock smiles. This is familiar ground; he slips back into the skin of the man he was five years ago, when he’d first met John Watson at the lab in St. Bart’s and was trying desperately to impress him, to make him stay.
” Mariah Carey’s voice warbles from the radio perched high on the shelf, next to the syrup sweetener. “
On the telly, Holmes finds himself by a waterfall – by the Reichenbach Falls, to be exact, with Moriarty advancing on him, backing him towards the edge of the precipice.
"Sir?" A voice from across from him, one of the medics. "Are you sure you're alright?"
Sherlock helped John up the stairs to the flat, despite protests from John that he could walk perfectly fine as they hadn't done much more to him than they had to Sherlock. When he offered to make tea he was ushered into the sitting room to take up residence in his chair while Sherlock made the tea. Both were silent until Sherlock came in with both tea and John's favorite biscuits. The oddity of everything came crashing down on John at once, so finally, he spoke up.
"God help me I love you so much. I never thought you'd go in for this sort of thing. Seemed too perfunctory for you."
John shakes his head at this, clearly not sensing that Sherlock is entirely serious about wanting to have killed the man for hurting John.
John looks as though he is going to question more when the bell rings for the food. With a sigh he gets up from the couch, heading down the stairs to get the food. Sherlock makes his way up the stairs to John's old bedroom to retrieve the surprise. He tucks it into his pocket, knowing that it is now the right time. He'd run himself physically sick with anxious thoughts the week he went to buy it, but he feels the anxiety return again now. He forces it down, and joins John in the sitting room again.
"It doesn't look terrible. I think I'll be able to fix it up myself. Good thing you decided to find a doctor to be your boyfriend."
Sherlock stays quiet a long moment, his face scrunched up like he doesn't really believe John. Sensing he needs some reassurance, John begins to list the things without waiting for a reply.
Sherlock furrows his brow. "For what?"
He hears the Inspector sigh on the other end of the line, and Sherlock can picture him putting his head into his free hand as he does when he's had quite enough of Sherlock for the day.
"Mhm no, I think most of the things you do for me are an experiment to determine my reaction. I've been told I'm a quite fascinating specimen."
"What, John getting shot in the kidney?" Greg asks, fully expecting something along the lines of Serves him right for just giving one of his away.
"It hadn't even crossed my mind as an advantage."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He isn't sure how long he's been doing this when he is startled back to reality by a hand on his arm. He looks up to see a doctor staring at him, eyebrow knit in concern, no doubt from trying for a good few minutes to get a response from Sherlock. Sherlock looks around the room. He's ended up in what he assumes in a waiting room, and down the hall he can see what is presumably the doors to the operating room. He mentally shakes himself back to reality.
The string of expletives from the direction of the bathroom borders on thing's he'd never thought he'd hear Sherlock say. He was, in fact, the soldier of the two, and definitely had a harsher tongue than Sherlock, but Sherlock had been known to let slip a curse or two. This, however, was something else entirely. Before he can even be bothered to call over his shoulder to see if Sherlock was alright he hears his name being called from within the nonsensical babbling Sherlock was doing.
"God, then you would have been even more recognizable anywhere."
Sherlock shifts uncomfortably in his seat. "Completely legal. Paperwork and everything."
Sherlock pulls him in close so he can press a kiss to his hair.
He removes the needles with care, shivering when he notices they've placed them carefully away from the track marks on the inside of his forearm. He wonders if anyone thought to question them, knowing Mycroft had his file wiped of any evidence of drug use long ago to protect his arrangement with Lestrade. He locates his own clothes stacked neatly on the chair beside him, still stained a bit from John's blood. He puts them on, wincing a little at the pain in his side, knowing John would be having a fit if he saw Sherlock getting fully dressed less than twenty minutes post-op, but he doesn't want to wander the hospital in that awful gown and he doesn't want to alarm John by looking like an invalid.
"But I was the one that put you in danger in the first place. I was so confident that he wouldn't have fired his gun that I allowed you to be placed directly in his aim without a way to retrieve your own weapon."
John softens at this. Sherlock was afraid to loose him. It made perfectly reasonable sense, but it stirred something in John's chest.
Once they have cleared away the takeaway containers, they migrate back to the sitting room, this time pilling up pillows and blankets on the floor so they have more room to spread out and be comfortable. Sherlock thinks that perhaps they need a new sofa, one that's a little bit bigger to fit them both, but the blanket fort works well for now. They lay like that for a little while, staring at the fire in the fireplace that John had lit before ordering dinner. It's slowly dying, casting a faint glow on the room that softens everything. Now is the time, Sherlock thinks.
He thought about his first case, the disappointment when the police hadn't taken him seriously. Then he thought about the time he went to confront Moriarty for the first time. The fear when he for one millisecond had considered the thought that maybe John had been behind it all.
"I don't want you to risk your life for mine! Why do you?!"
John Watson. John Hamish Watson. His John.
"I'll take that as a no then. I thought you realised, the speech at the wedding, the looks he gives you all the time, the list goes on and on darling. He was head over heels for you from the day you met. He wouldn't offer his home to anyone you know."
Anyway, enjoy <3
'They let him shower.' Sherlock realised with confusion as he breathed in an unfamiliar scent. He didn't like it (it didn't smell like John) but he buried his nose in John's hair nonetheless. That pulled a sob and a shiver from John and he moved a hand to fiddle with John's hair, gently massaging his scalp and neck. Slowly, John started to relax.
Mycroft was probably tracking him, meaning that he would come to the right conclusion sooner or later. He was rooting for later, considering John's position.
"No! I will not calm down. You are going to leave and then you are going to find him."
John.
The next time he woke up, he felt cold. Sherlock wasn't there and when le looked out of the window, the dark sky gave him the reason. He pressed a button, calling for a nurse. She fretted over him for far longer than he thought necessary until she finally handed him his chart. Apparently, he had been incredibly lucky. If the knife had hit him just an inch in another direction, it would have hit his intestines.
The second thing he noticed was that his hands and feet were bound and that he was sitting on a cold concrete floor. There was one window on the wall opposite of him were a small ray of moonlight shone through and landed on the floor.
What is John's side of the story?
He sat there, alone on a crate in an alley, waiting. He kept waiting. He must have waited in nearly half an hour when the realisation hit him like a train. He hadn't known what was in the syringe. What if it had been water? What if it had been a poison that wouldn't be felt until it was too late. But no, that was wrong. Moriarty didn't want him dead. At least not yet. He wanted to burn his heart out by making him face himself. Something he had had to do for a while now.
"Sherlock, we need to talk."
"Fuck off Mycroft!"
"Sorry what?"
"Follow me." he said, turning his back to Sherlock. He did as instructed, every sense on edge. He had a funny feeling that he wouldn't like what he was about to see.
After, when they had settled (Sherlock's head in the crook of John's neck and John's arms around him) they talked.
I hope this chapter made you smile!  <3
"You might be surprised to hear from me again. I'm dead, right? I shot myself, right? Well Sherlock, everything isn't always as it seems. Oh, and don't worry about the boy. He will be sent free as soon as you complete my task. A little hint, look at the pictures." Then the recording was over. Shit.
He stayed in the hospital for a total of 8 days. The 5 last days (where he was fully awake) were spent trying to get Sherlock to eat and the two of them not talking about The Incident. Sherlock grew very quiet if it was mentiomed so John had avoided it too.
He looked up the address, finding that it was an old house located a short distance from London.
Everything started to spin. His mind started picturing John, alone, hurt, scared. When he pulled himself together enough to speak he practically screamed.
Sherlock's scream echoed in the room, a horrible, soul-crushing sound that made his blood feel like ice. He closed his eyes, trying to block it out.
An unwelcome voice in his head answered almost immediately.
When she stepped out into the light, he felt a stab of confusion that quickly turned into anger, betrayal and fear. Everything packed so tightlyin his chest it made it hard to breathe. Mary (or whatever her name is) was standing in front of him, smirking.
Tears were running down his cheeks now and a sob escaped his throat as John's arms circled him. John's hands were tangled in his hair and massaging his scalp. When he finally stopped shaking, John pulled away. But not very far, he was still holding him. He reached up towards Sherlock's face again and wiped away more tears.
This was one of those times. He was sprawled on the sofa thinking about John while constantly reminding himself that he definitely shouldn't be thinking about John.
"Hello, what's your name?" he asked. Trying to calm the boy down while he fished his phone out of his pocket and dialing Lestrade's number.
Last time, it had only been about cases. This time, it seemed to be about Sherlock. "Burn the heart out of you". It was going to be about his past and his feelings.
'Shit, should I walk away? Can I walk away? Do I want to walk away?' His internal battle was interrupted by John.
Tears were pouring down his cheeks now but he couldn't care less. He heard Moriarty say something again but he ignored him once again.
He couldn't breathe, couldn't think. His heart was pounding in his ears, distracting him. A part of him longed for a distraction, but the rest of him screamed at the other part to SHUT UP, WE WILL NOT FAIL JOHN LIKE THAT!
"You look awful." she said, eyes flicking over him. "I imagine you have a few questions."
"I assume you know why I have come here."
When a few tears had landed on Sherlock's skin, the arms around him had tightened as a sob slipped out of John’s throat. He didn't remember how long they had been standing there but when he took a step back, brushed away the tears with the back of his hand and looked at Sherlock, his gaze was filled with care and concern.
He didn't like this Mary, evidently this had been the real her all along but it was so different to the kind and steady person he had fallen for. Now, all he felt was anger and betrayal. Not even Sherlock had understood that she had been cheating, or that she was an assassin. She was good, he understood that, but what he didn't know was how good. And he had a funny feeling he was about to find out.
Sitting on the floor in a corner, shirtless, malnourished, bruised and pale. Blood was smeared over the floor, sometimes forming distinct handprints. John's face was turned away from him, his whole body trembling. He had a few cuts on his chest and the burn was distinct.
"Tie him up again, then wait for further instructions." He stayed silent as they tied the ropes again and almost threw him to the floor with no mercy what so ever. He gave them a deadly glare as they walked out. What the hell was he supposed to do now?
Sorry (not) for the cliffhanger!
John seemed to ignore him until he was finished with the tea and turned around. When he pressed a cup into Sherlock's hands and kissing his cheek whispering 'Happy birthday, love' Sherlock smiled for the first time in what felt like an eternity.
Blood was already soaking the scarf and staining his hands. He could hear Moriarty and Mary standing behind him, whispering about something but he paid them no mind. His only focus was John, bleeding out under his hands.
The turning point came that very afternoon. John was typing (with two fingers, seriously?) something on his computer when he suddenly slammed it shut and stood up.
"W..well y..yes." he managed to get out.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had been scared today. Mostly because he had started to realise what he would do for John. It should have been obvious to him earlier (he had actually shot a man for him) but it had all been so natural. He hadn't actually thought much about the consequences, just acted. But Moriarty forced him to consciously make sacrifices for John and made him realise that he would make these choices no matter what.
So with nothing more to do, Sherlock took a cab home. Mycroft would be monitoring the flat and the streets around it.
He didn't usually wear the blue cashmere jumper that brought out the colour of his eyes but he knew for a fact that Sherlock loved it. Which seemed to be enough reason to wear it today.
"Gingernuts?" he blurted out. John stilled and his lips were stretched into a smile.
But there had been a baby. He could never leave his own child in her hands. So he had stayed. Hating himself and hating Mary. And hurting Sherlock in the process. But the baby had been born and Mary had one last secret. The baby wasn’t his. Why she had kept quiet he didn't know. She had secretly taken a paternity test with the man she had been cheating on him with. She showed him the papers a few days after the birth. He had taken one look at them, turned and walked out. She didn't try to stop him.
John was his heart, and that Magnussen had put him in a bonfire seemed way to telling.
Anyway, hope you like it!
"Well will you look at that! The famous detective, what an honour."
He quickly rolled up his sleave and walked towards a bigger crate to sit on. He took a deep breath, struggled a bit in the dim light in his search for a vein, positioned the syringe and slowly inserted it. He breathed again and started to push the unknown liquid into his blood.
"Waiting, in there." she answered, gesturing towards the first door. He walked past her, making sure to give her a deadly look, and entered the room. What met him almost made him gag.
This is the end I want for our boys. I want them healed and happy. So I'm going to stay in the fandom, ignore s4 and write the version that I want. That is why I love writing so much, I can do what I want.
John was quiet for a while until he said "Sounds perfect, love." and kissed the top of his head.
His whole body ached with longing. John, his John. Alone in the hands of Moriarty while Sherlock was doing everything he could to get him home, which wasn't much to be honest.
He sat down in his chair after shedding the coat and scarf and stapled his fingers beneath his chin.
He took a deep breath. He had figured it out the moment he had entered the dressing room. He whispered a small apology, aimed, closed his eyes, hesitated for a millisecond and pulled the trigger. The dog fell to the ground without a sound. Sherlock was sure it hadn't felt a thing, judging by the location of the bullet, but guilt still washed over him. Made him feel sick.
"Yes I was, Moriarty's plan is to destroy Sherlock, what better way than to take away his only friend?" she said, smiling again. It sent a chill down his spine. "And no, I never actually loved you. And yes, the affair started long before I first told you it did." she continued, obviously seeing that he was about to ask.
"Where is Redbeard?" he asked. His mother told him that Redbeard had been In an accident when he ran across the road. That's all she had time to tell him before he ran up to his room. He locked himself in and didn't come out until morning. Mycroft talked to him a few days later.
He spent a considerable amount of time rearranging the memories and calming himself down. John always had that effect on him. Calming.
*pip* *pip* *piiip*
"No, no, NO! Don't you dare leave John!" he almost screamed. Then he watched in horror as John drew a raspy breath, his hands slipping from Sherlock's arms and his eyelids fluttered closed.
Missing.
When John pulled away, he didn't look at Sherlock and he recoiled again when Sherlock reached for him. Like he was embarrassed.
"Not quite. Now, while you've been napping, for approximately 2 hours, no-one have noticed your absence. Though Sherlock should get worried quite soon and when he does, I'm intending to have some fun." While he continued to talk about Sherlock, John managed to loosen the knots tying his hands together behind his back. The rope was cutting into his wrists but he kept going, looking around the room at the same time in search for a weapon. Moriarty noticed of course.
. He almost smiles at how apt the description is.
“It’s been obvious since day two that you were completely gone for him,” Molly said matter-of-factly, taking a sip from her champagne flute as though she hadn’t just upended his entire universe.
Once she’s done that (and been given a much more welcoming reception by Lestrade) John busies himself by pretending to measure out more coffee beans for the grinder, angling the machine so he can freely observe and eavesdrop at leisure on the potentially MI-6 confidential conversation taking place not ten feet away from him.
Sherlock spent the meal as he always did whenever they were at Angelo’s: staring out the window across the street, thinking about the first not-a-date they’d had while waiting for the cabbie.
“Miss me?”
“Night,” Sherlock tells the empty living room, stomach rumbling with hunger after all the Chinese he didn’t eat, but his chest feeling lighter than it has in years.
Sherlock opens his mouth to reply, but John chooses this moment to stir, eyes opening blearily before he assesses the situation - the gun at his temple, Sherlock on the table, Smith with a knife in hand - and his instincts kick in. He moves quickly, but Mary's faster. He barely unbalances her with a sweep of his leg at her feet before she recovers, this time digging the barrel of the gun into the tender underside of his jaw and her other hand clamping down on the nape of his neck.
In the span of an hour, Sherlock has determined that John:  a) adores egg rolls and spring rolls and also bread rolls but that’s beside the point  b) doesn’t like talking about his family  c) is an inherently GOOD person in block letters and  d) is entirely too GOOD for Sherlock.
? Seriously, who comes up with these things?”
Sherlock hurries as best he can through the tramway tunnel, careful not to make a sound. Just around the bend in front he hears General Shan talking, and then – the voice unmistakable – John’s reply.
“There’s someone coming, this is easiest,” Sherlock muttered, backing up until he hit the tree. He tugged at John until he relented, tipping forward until their chests were pressed together.
What he’s not prepared for is Sherlock peering wide-eyed at him over the lens of his microscope, before hurriedly pushing his chair back and stalking to the sitting room, where he promptly flops onto their sofa and turns to bury his head in between the cushions.
"He was my nephew," Smith says, in an uncharacteristic moment of quiet. (Sherlock has a thousand snide comments about their clear relationship, based purely on hereditary insanity, but he refrains.) Smith's eyes are fixed on the far wall; the cut on Sherlock's palm drips steadily, staining the metal surface he's on. "I loved him like he was my own son."
” he says.
He closed his eyes and awaited his inevitable doom.
and asks hopefully, “Does this mean you’ll let me buy you a drink?”
"Oh, silly me," Smith says, lips pulled back as he bares his teeth in a grin. "I'm sure you won't mind if I do this then," and clasping Sherlock's left hand, he produces a switchblade from a pocket and presses the blade into Sherlock's palm.
“For Christ’s sake, Sherlock,” the
The idling engine roars to life and the jet begins taxiing down the runway. Sherlock looks out the window, unable to help himself. John and Mary are standing together, their arms linked. Mycroft stands a little ways apart from them. His hand is raised in farewell.
And John leans in, because he doesn’t think there’s ever been a moment that’s so readily presented itself as the one now, but next thing he knows his personal space is bereft of Sherlock and he’s being pulled to his feet and behind the trunk of the tree.
The hum of the jet engine behind him is a distraction; Sherlock can feel his hands shaking, though whether that stems from nerves or the drugs he took, he doesn’t know. He tucks them behind his back, clears his throat, turns to Mycroft.
“Oh.” There it is again, the vice around his heart, tightening until Sherlock feels like he might explode. He feels moisture gathering at the corners of his eyes and tilts his head back, blinking rapidly until the danger passes.
He turns, half-empty jar in one hand and raspberry staining his chin. “
“Aaand a candle, for you and your date, Mr. Holmes,” Angelo says, winking at John as he slides the candle onto the table between them.
,” Holmes says on-screen, lip curling suggestively, and John’s brain short-circuits as it supplies him with the many possible ways in which that particular phrase could be taken. Besides him, Sherlock chokes on the sip of tea he’s just taken.
John was still sucking on his neck.
He watches with amusement now as John advances towards Mycroft, who's still sitting in the armchair (
Sherlock frowns as a thought occurs to him. “Does that mean I could have bloody well died for nothing?”
Sherlock just stares at him.
!" she screeches, and Sherlock half-rises from his perch on the sofa in concern because he's never seen her face quite so red, nor hear her voice quite so livid with fury. She strides up to where John and Mycroft are standing in tableau, staring at her transfixed, and starts batting Mycroft's arm with the duster. "Out of my house, you
“Listen, John,” Sherlock says, the moment the door clicks shut behind his brother, because apparently overdosing on cocaine and almost-dying works wonders for lowering one’s inhibitions, “What I said before – I meant it.”
“S-sorry?” she says, hand hovering uncertainly over the penis cappuccino. “Did you say you wanted –”
Molly opens her mouth as soon as he’s behind the counter, looking like she can’t decide whether to thank or tease him.
SHERLOCK:
He turns, and there’s John, standing not three feet behind him, sporting that ridiculous moustache and 19
"No," John says shortly, voice clipped. "You don't."
The jet takes off and Sherlock tears his eyes away from John, his figure a fading speck on the ground below.
Sherlock groaned; he’d forgotten about the bedsheet. In the end they were five minutes later than they would have been to the crime scene, although Sherlock was at least suitably attired for the occasion.
"No, I needed to show you, to show you that I was in this for the long haul, so to speak. Wanted you to know that I will never get bored with you or stop loving you or want anything or anyone but you. It's you, it's always been you."
John beams at this, and comes to lean up against Sherlock on the couch so that his head falls right on Sherlock's chest. It's his favorite way to sit, as he can peer up at Sherlock quite well, and he can hold Sherlock's long arms around his neck. John's compact frame fits quite nicely in the space left by Sherlock's gangly limbs, though Sherlock is quite adept at fitting himself snugly in John's lap when he wants to.
He took a shaky step backwards. His breath seemed to be stuck in his throat. The picture's meaning was clear as day. It was a threat. A reminder that he shouldn't get help from anyone if he wanted to keep John alive. This must have been done when he and Mycroft talked, somehow without letting it show on the cameras in the flat.
And with that, they started to fall asleep. "I love you's" were exchanged and before the darkness claimed them, Sherlock wispered "Love you John. My John.". That earned him another kiss on his head and he thought 'Yes, this is it. I will keep this.'.
"It will take a while.." he said, still worried about possible consequences for John. But when Mycroft kept quiet, he continued. He told the story from the beginning, only skipping the details about his own feelings and reactions to seem a bit better. Even now, he didn't like the disappointment in Mycroft's eyes whenever they discusses his feelings.
Hope you enjoy!
When the cab pulled up and when he threw some money at him, he walked out and abruptly stopped. Everything was quiet. There was no traffic on the dark Street behind him and the chilly autumn night was making him shiver lightly.
There it was chaos. With John God knows were his mind seemed to loose all sense of logic. Everything he had so neatly organised was suddenly somewhere else and the wing he secretly had stored everything about John in was even worse.
In no time, they were curled up on the sofa together in front of a bad movie with food all over the table. He actually ate which seemed to surprise John, judging by all of the content glances. But when the food was gone and the movie had almost an hour left he felt lost.
He didn't even register his body moving, it seemed to be working on autopilot. It caught a cab and shouted an adress while Sherlock was thinking about something else. What could the task be? What would Moriarty want him to do?
There was still the possibility that the drug(s?) hadn't kicked in yet. But the most possible explanation was that he had been fooled.
He wondered if he could escape that way but quickly realised that the window was way to small and very high up. But he could see grass. Basement then, he thought. The only door was probably locked and honestly, his bound limbs didn't really improve the situation.
"In the crate beneath the street lamp there is a little gift for you. Something that will remind you of this place. Use all of it and wait, only then will I send the girl to you."
That's when his parents got him Redbeard. It was the best years of his childhood. Coming home after a shitty day in school and finding Redbeard, full of joy as always, running towards him with ears flapping and tongue sticking out of his mouth. It lasted until his 13th birthday.
Sherlock felt the anger bubble up in him again. He hoped that his face was straight, but his mind was racing. Trying to figure out how many people there could be here, if he and John (or just John if necessary) could escape or if Mycroft would come.
I am so so sorry for the delay. I have been quite busy and will continue to be the coming 2 weeks. But I promise to upload new chapters as soon as I can.
This place was nothing but proof that sentiment was only going to hurt him. But he found that he didn't really care. It was John. His John, the only person he had ever loved (even if John didn't know it). He found that what he felt didn't really matter as long as his John could be happy and safe.
"No my real name isn't Mary, yes I work for Moriarty, yes I have done that since the beginning. Our first encounter was in fact at the pool where Powers died, I was one of the snipers. Does that cover it all?"
Streaks of sunlight hit his face, waking him up. He checked the time, addind it to his internal clock, set from the day of John's disappearance. 3 weeks, 2 days, 0.5 hours, 5 minutes and 24 seconds.
"Because I love you!"
"I hope you understand.." he started, suddenly looking serious. "..that I can't do this for just a little while. If we do this, you need to know that I'm in it for the long haul."
But the world's only consulting detective happened to be more curious than a 5 year old, to John's advantage.
"Look at me." He wanted to ignore John. To run away and never come back. But when John asked something in that voice, he could never deny him. That soft, almost pleading voice. He slowly turned around, tears burning in his eyes. John looked at him, just looked. Not like he usually did but with so much more. His gaze was filled with happiness, relief and love. So much that it made Sherlock sway where he stood.
No, he couldn’t think about that now, he had to focus on finding John. He clicked on the phone's gallery and found a single picture. A swimming pool. And not just any pool, the same one where Powers had died, the same one where he had found John strapped in enough explosives to blow up half the street.
Two days went by, the tea didn't help. In fact, John seemed to be bursting with anger towards something. But it wasn't just anger. Worry? 'Hard to tell, need more data'.
But this was about John! He knew it had too be. So with shaking fingers he turned the phone on. At first glance, there was nothing on it. No missed calls, no contacts, no search history. But there was a recorded audiofile. He made sure to turn the sound on and pressed play.
Maybe someone that wants leverage. He remembered Magnussen and his pressure points. Hurt Mary and you can get to Mycroft. That must mean that hurting John will give the same results.
He watched, trying and failing to keep a staight face as Sherlock was beaten and burned by two other people with hidden faces. He didn't want to appear weak by looking away, so he forced his eyes to stay focused on the screen. The two people had walked away from Sherlock, one said something in a strange language while another reached for something that looked like a whip.
They talked about hard things, like Sherlock's time away or Mary, and easy things, like what they wanted to do tomorrow or aboute some case.
But then Sherlock had called him an idiot for not understanding the importance of it while also claiming that he never would. That's when the hurt appeared on John’s face and that's also when Sherlock started to feel sick. He hated that look, especially when it was directed at him.
"What do you want me to do?" he asked, the uneasy feeling in his stomach increasing.
Thank you SO much to all of you that have followed this fic! Only one chapter left, wich will be full to the brim with fluff (because our boys deserve it and no one can convince me otherwise).
When the clock ticked closer to 7, John managed to talk Sherlock into putting on something nice without revealing where they were going. Not an easy task when it's the world's only consulting detective you have to persuade.
When they got back to the flat, John was all over him. Kissing, biting, caressing. They ended up in their bed (The bedroom that used to belong to Sherlock) after some time.
Despite his anger he didn't push Sherlock away, he actually clung to him like his life depended on it and it wasn't long until Sherlock's arms were closed around him.
“That’s an incredibly novice assumption to make,” Sherlock says, not raising his voice, exactly, but also clearly not fussed about keeping it down. “This is someone fastidious, talented. They’ll have been careful about keeping their mess – shall we say –
“Ugh, not this again,” Sherlock muttered, as the guard opened up Skype.
The body has evidently been hit with a blunt instrument, judging by the bruising and blood around the back of the head, which can mean one of two things, that the room has no –
, no,” John moans, as Sherlock is borne off to the ambulance, and maybe it’s cowardice, but Sherlock wishes more than anything that his homeless network hadn’t been ready, that he could have jumped and died like he was supposed to.
John scrambles to the remote, switches the telly off and plunges the flat into silence. For a long while, they sit there, neither of them saying a word.
Sherlock licks his parched lips, tests his voice out. "John."
by other, vastly more creative means.
Watson looks surprised but extremely pleased. “
“Hurry up and send it,” Sherlock says lowly, with his mouth far too close to John’s ear, who shivers with cold and anticipation – of
“Morning, Sherlock,” he says in greeting, reaching over the detective’s shoulder to get at the salt on the countertop.
Sherlock waits until Lestrade’s retrieved his sunglasses, bodily spins him around and marches him in the direction of the doors. “Sorry we can’t stay, we’re in the most

It’s funny he should’ve said that, because just then the café door tinkles lightly and their regular steps in, only this time there’s something markedly different about him: he’s accompanied by someone else.
John's fist connects with the underside of Mycroft's jaw at the same time Mrs Hudson clatters in, a steaming pot of tea in one hand and a plate of shortbread in the other.
that, stop. I was, it was - wrong, of me."
“Is that what you think, or is that what people’ve told you?” John asks gently, reaching out and placing a hand on Sherlock’s forearm.
“And Kingsley, he’ll be coming too, I suppose?” said the taller, before the pair moved out of earshot, leaving John and Sherlock alone once more.
John turns his attention back to the article:
, goddamit. “I –
“I was dead when you first started dating, then I came back and ruined your proposal – sorry about that, by the way. I thought I might as well make it easier and remove myself from the equation –”
“Ugh,” John groans, dipping a finger into the jam jar next to the sconces on display in a neat, pyramidal fashion on the countertop and licking it off. (Jam, as he’s found on numerous occasions, is great for stress relief.) “Don’t start, Mol. Just bring him the latte, will you?”
Holmes is staring at Watson with his eyes wide and his mouth agape, clearly impressed and struggling to hide it. He seems to have completely forgotten about the criminal mastermind currently residing on his knees between them.
Molly shoots him a weird look on her way back, but John tilts his head conspiratorially towards the corner table, and with a roll of her eyes Molly returns to the counter and leaves him to it.
“I think you mean
Although, Sherlock has to admit, forcing himself out of his Mind Palace, option 3 doesn’t seem terribly likely, given what he knows (and has observed) of John over the years.
Damn. This would mark the third time he forgot to leave John a note.
!” Sherlock snaps, running his free hand through his hair in frustration. “Mycroft, Donovan, Scotland Yard – even ‘Watson’ –” he spits the name out, stabbing the air with the quotation marks, “– I’m just an addict in need of a fix, I’m, I’m not a hero, or whatever picture you paint of me in your blogs, John. I’m not even married to my work, am I, I just use it to get high when I can’t get my hands on the real thing, and I – you – John, you
Donovan shushes him. “Just keeping reading, John.”
,” not-Sherlock says, the corner of his lips tugging upwards in a barely-there smirk.
“Late – where?” John allows himself to be propelled halfway down the stairs before a thought strikes him. “You’re not seriously going outside in that?”
John was the last person Sherlock expected to see sitting at their (his) kitchen table when he ambled out of his bedroom on Christmas morning. John so rarely visited now; he and Mary were living the life of perfect domestic bliss.
Sherlock’s answering smile is soft, and he looks at John like he sees the London skyline and more in his eyes. “I promise, John. And I always keep my promises.”
Mycroft relents. He shifts to sit beside Sherlock (his D&G suit be damned), his back to the wall, and folds his younger brother into his embrace.
Smith turns his back on the scuffle, uninterested. "Call off your attack dog, Mr Holmes, or I'm afraid Agatha will have to put him down."
. Well, he supposes it’s his own damn fault; he should’ve learnt after Victor, but it’d been fourteen years after when he’d met John, and he’d been so alone, and he’d thought (hoped) that it would be different with John. In a way, it
“I –” There’s a pause during which John ducks his head and studiously starts counting coffee beans for the first time since the eavesdropping began, Sherlock clicks and unclicks the pen, and Lestrade frowns down at his case file like it’s something the cat dragged in.
"If there's anything the war's taught me,
hot,” Sherlock mutters, setting the mug down.
"You do remember the Beppo case, don't you, boys?"
pressure. Sherlock swallowed; this had to be the most difficult thing he’d ever attempted in his life, and he’d successfully taken down a criminal mastermind’s network. “
“Oh, shut up,” John scowls, giving the card up as a lost cause. He turns his back resolutely to her and, selecting a knife, starts cutting bagels, his ire rising the more he thinks about the entire situation. “It
(He wasn’t really. There was a trumpeting fanfare marching around his Mind Palace. He felt the same rush of exhilaration he’d felt that first night, standing by an ambulance with a shock blanket around his shoulders, looking across the sea of swarming police officers and medics to meet John’s steady gaze, and knowing in his heart that John had just shot the cabbie to save him.)
(The weight on his chest eases. It almost feels like he can breathe normally again.)
“Sorry, must dash,” Sherlock says, sounding not in the least bit apologetic as he all but runs to the doors, Lestrade on his heels.
It feels strangely like falling, Sherlock thinks, when they finally break apart. The same breathless exhilaration, the same rush of adrenaline. He wonders if he should brace himself, because the landing had hurt last time round.
“Well, I hardly have a choice now, do I, what with you kidnapping me in a cab and all.”
John lets himself be tugged along, giving Anderson the finger when he not-so-subtly whispers, “
Sherlock’s heart (metaphorically) skipped a beat. He blinked; there was a brief sensation of freefall, and he had no idea what was waiting for him at the bottom. “Dinner as in – dinner, or –?”
"Sherlock," John groans, plucking a sheet of paper taped to the windshield of a police cruiser, "This isn't what I meant when I told you to 'leave me a note' whenever possible."
And without even waiting for John to give the affirmative (or any kind of response, for that matter), he’s out the door and lost in a flurry of coattails and snowflakes to the London streets.
Sherlock steels himself, tries to ignore how fast his heart is beating, how hard his hands are trembling. (He wants to tell John, wants to grab John by the shoulders and tell him what he’s done, tell him this is
“When I said it’s unlikely we’ll ever see each other again,” Sherlock clarifies. “I meant it – I thought that was the last time you’d ever see me alive.”
!) takes a sip of the drink. The appreciative groan that emerges from his mouth is positively orgasmic. John not-so-guiltily files it away mentally; he’ll revisit that noise whenever he’s feeling especially lonely, he decides.
“You can’t possibly have taken all that in the past five minutes, Sherlock!” John says vehemently. His eyes are scanning Sherlock, flicking over his body as though he can stop the drugs wreaking havoc in Sherlock’s system. (Angina seizes him once more and he grimaces, turning his face to the window to hide it.)
Their third Christmas together was spent apart.
!” Sherlock yelped, leaping onto the coffee table and promptly knocking John’s third cup of tea to the floor. “Hurry
Once they were back in the flat, John heated the risotto up and made him eat it while they watched some inane reality show on the telly, falling asleep afterwards with his head pillowed on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Hello, brother dear,” Mycroft’s slimy voice oozed from the other end of the video call.
“Specialty drink,” John says, smearing cream off onto his apron. Then, when Sherlock continues looking rather sceptically at the concoction, he rolls his eyes, leans across the counter and takes a generous sip, wrapping his hand around where Sherlock’s is clutching the cup. “See?” he says, after. “Not poisoned.”
“Push
John’s hands, ice cold from the wind, refused to cooperate. After watching John attempt to put the scarf on with thinly veiled amusement, Sherlock pushed his hands away and did it for him.
Sherlock raises his head, his red-rimmed eyes focussing unsteadily on Mycroft. “He prom – promised, Mycroft. He said he’d never leave, and now he’s - just
“Cappuccino, yes, right away,” Molly jumps in, when all John appears capable of doing is to stare, dumb-founded, at Sherlock like he’s a figment of his imagination that might disappear at any moment. “That’ll be two sixty-five. Thanks,” she says as Sherlock deposits the change in her hand.
The call disconnected, and Sherlock was left staring blankly at the screen.
if you liked it drop me a comment they make me as happy as John's coffee makes Sherlock :D
Mary purses her lips, expression tight, and doesn't say anything, though the gun at John's throat does dig in a little harder. Sherlock winces in sympathy.
At that, John breaks off, turning to face Lestrade with a smirk. “We do, actually. Would you mind?”
“I – yes,” he said haltingly, a flush rising to his cheeks as he surveyed the damage. “New case, yes. Very – very interesting. Something about a missing earring. Excuse me.”
She potters around, placing the teapot and biscuit tray on the kitchen table, and heads for the door, though not before she gives Sherlock a rather conspiratorial wink.
John’s fingers, when they check his wrist for a pulse, are steady, and Sherlock would be heartened if he didn’t know what state this means John will be in later. A litany of
“Tell me what?” John asks, his ire rising. He pictures taking a swing at Anderson in his mind’s eye, just for fun. It’s not as satisfying as the real thing,
Mycroft and John are talking, taking turns berating him for his lapse in judgement. Sherlock lets their words fade into the background as, keeping his eyes shut, he lets himself fall.
Sherlock shakes his head to clear it, turning his attention back to the case at hand. So the only way the murderer could have gotten into the room
Sherlock grins, and the age-old wound in his chest no longer hurts (he suspects it never will again). "Likewise."
not tea.)
"What I
“So, uh,” John said after a while, when neither of them appeared willing to break the (prolonged, awkward) silence. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, before falling into a quasi-parade rest, squaring his shoulders. (Was he going into battle?)
” Holmes concedes, carefully picking himself and the syringe off the floor, “
They pass the next few minutes in silence, Sherlock walking with purpose along the riverbank, stopping every now and then to check his phone. As Sherlock pulls out his phone for what must be the fifth or sixth check, he stops dead in his tracks and John, having spent the last few hundred feet thinking about how cold his feet are becoming, collides bodily with him.
His lips twist into a faint, rueful smile. He doesn't think he'll mind terribly if this is the last thing he sees.
“Hm,” Sherlock says non-committally, refusing to give John the satisfaction. He turns his attention back to the cadaver.
There was a moment’s hesitation, during which Sherlock could hear John’s heartbeat, a relentless staccato hammering against his ribcage, and then John’s mouth was on his neck and Sherlock was in what would presumably be heaven, if he believed in that kind of thing. He tipped his head down and adjusted his coat just so that it covered John as well.
It feels closer, so much closer to home. It feels
always –
“Oh, John,” Sherlock says, pausing in the doorway, “You still have my card, yes? Come by at 8. I’ll buy you a drink.”
. So, keep that in mind if you ever want someone to talk to, alright?”
"We'll deal with that later," John says, "I've -
But Sherlock’s attention is focussed solely on his phone, on which he’s attempting to type something with apparent difficulty, probably because he’s failed to take off his gloves beforehand.
MYCROFT:
Watson replies, clearly delighted at being able to show off to the sleuth, for once. “
A woman in her sixties is standing in the doorway, wearing a smile and an apron over her magenta dress.

, ever.”
“Hacked his phone and got into his messages,” Sherlock says, in the off-hand manner one usually associates with commentary on the weather. “He’s meeting his supplier and, if I’m not mistaken, our murderer.”
“That you’re waiting for him to come back,” she says, laughing as she side-steps John’s hand a third time. She clasps the back of her hand to her forehead and pretends to swoon. “Oh Sherlock! I thought you’d gone forever, that you’d never come back!”
John’s answering grin is so wide he thinks he may have pulled a muscle or two.
“’m glad you did it, John,” Sherlock says finally, twisting round to face John. His eyes are glazed slightly from the alcohol, and his cheeks are tinged red. “You’re the only one who could do it, you know.”
Sherlock cuts in, to save time (it’s only economical). “He means sex. John and I – we’re going to have lots of it, preferably involving some of your missing handcuffs, Lestrade, and also possibly John’s army uniform, so unless you want to hear about it you’ll kindly excuse us.”
"Sherlock," John says steadily, his eyes an impossibly vivid cerulean. This close, Sherlock can feel the staccato beat of John's heart against his ribcage more than clearly enough. "For once in your goddamn life, shut up."
John ducks under the police cordon and fairly jogs to the nearest Tesco's. He's never bought milk this quickly in his life.
He settles for an uncontrollable giggle that’s entirely incongruous to the situation at hand. “You’re – terrible, you know that?” he asks between breaths.
Sherlock takes John by the hand and they leave the crime scene with before either of them can say anything more to embarrass themselves.
Lestrade found them in the exact same position an hour later, once Sherlock remembered to text him about their suspect’s current location.
"Yoohoo!" Mrs Hudson trills at that point, rapping sharply on the door and pushing it open before they have a chance to reply. "I've brought you tea and - oh! Sorry to interrupt, boys. I'll let you - I'll just leave the tea and let you, let you get on, shall I?"
He trudges up the stairs, seemingly unaware of the steaming pot in his hand.
“Sorry, sorry.” John stopped moving and instead huddled pitifully against the tree trunk, hugging his jacket to his body.
“You’re all idiots, the lot of you!” Sherlock snaps, leaping to his feet with a typically dramatic flare of his coat behind him.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "I have a theory." At John's expectant glance, he says, "It was a blank, wasn't it. In Mary's gun. And she deliberately missed." His gaze flicks to the gauze hiding the shallow cut on John's arm.
John groans, and shoves at Sherlock's chest lightly. "Just pleased to see you, yeah, yeah, I get it. Ha bloody
"John,
Mrs Hudson
John swallows. "Uh, no, sorry Greg."
On-screen, Victorian-Sherlock tosses a cane at Victorian-John, who catches it. “

"What would you have had me say, John?" Sherlock says lowly, "Everything I had to say-" (
“This,” Sherlock says, pointing rather extravagantly at the now-empty cappuccino sat on the table, “This is the best cappuccino I’ve ever had.”
he thinks, as he sets the cup gingerly back down onto the table’s scratched wooden surface, “I shouldn’t have – it’s really no trouble at all if I just –”
Later, when dinner’s done and the bottle of wine drained, and Angelo’s had to kick them out of his restaurant because it’s past closing time, they head back to the flat and settle on the sofa, but this time the telly’s off and the silence that envelops them is hazy and warm.
throw them out.”
He presses ‘END CALL’ before he can say anything that will give himself away, spreads his arms and lets himself fall.
Moments and a lifetime later, they break apart and Sherlock rests his forehead against John's. They're both breathless and John's starting to giggle.
) he wanted.
,” Moriarty says, “
Sherlock frowns, though he doesn't open his eyes or indeed, move an inch from where he's reclined comfortably against the sofa in his dressing gown. Its left sleeve has ridden up, exposing the pale expanse of  his forearm, on which - John notes with sudden alarm - are a total of four nicotine patches.
“I –” Sherlock says, his voice coming out an octave higher than usual. He swallows, tries again. “I’m… your date?” The words are unsure, and said with an inflection that suggests Sherlock thinks this to be a joke of some sort, or a mistake that John’s very quickly going to correct.
” Watson demands of Holmes, while Sherlock sinks farther into the sofa cushion that he appears determined to diffuse by osmosis into.
“You want to know why I shot myself full of drugs before I got on this jet, John?” Sherlock barrels on, anger (at himself for being a coward; at John for marrying Mary) rising within him like a tidal wave. “Because I wanted you to be
who’s done nothing but patronize him all night and who is still currently gazing intently out the window, the contours of his face backlit by the glow of a passing streetlamp – though something warm pools in the region of John’s chest as he watches the corners of Sherlock’s lips curve upwards at his answer, almost imperceptibly, but there nevertheless. John doesn’t have long to savour the moment, however.
Next year found the two of them in Angelo’s, having a perfectly normal not-a-date dinner.
“Oh?” Sherlock says, peering intently into his microscope. John glances over his shoulder as he walks past on the way to the fridge; it appears to be yet another of Sherlock’s bacteria cultures.
"Oh," Sherlock says, wondering how on
Molly, who hadn’t seemed to expect anything else, took the mug from him and busied herself with the kettle. A minute later she pressed a steaming mug of tea into his hands.
Lestrade's handcuffs, as it turns out, are
“Do we, what do we do,” Molly hisses, glaring down at the foamy penis on the cappuccino like it’s offended her on a personal level. “Should I just make a new one –”
Sherlock and John both surfaced for air. “Mycroft would get us out,” they said, in near-perfect synchronicity.
"You're being awfully quiet," John says, looking over the top of his newspaper at the detective.
John, yes?”
fucking prat I’ve ever known.”
And before John can tell him otherwise, Sherlock takes off like a shot, his coattails flapping after him in the wind as he runs straight towards the altercation.
"Boys!" she admonishes, scandalized and concerned in equal measure as she sets the assortment down on the coffee table, next to the rescued Earl Grey. "I wish you'd all sit and
“… Pyeterson’s body or, well, what was left of it anyway,” Lestrade is saying in a hushed voice to Sherlock that nonetheless carries if one strained (and John was certainly straining). John startles so much at the confirmation of his hunch he almost drops the bag of coffee beans.
” Watson replies, the corners of his lips tugged upwards in helpless affection for the man in front of him, “
"Not long enough," Sherlock snaps, tugging the silk sleeve down so the patches are hidden. "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to -"
burning on his lips, but falls silent at the look on Sherlock’s face. He’s leaned back on the bench and is looking out over the river, at the London skyline, with a light in his eyes and it strikes John just how at peace Sherlock looks in this moment. Come to think of it, he’s never seen the man slow down for longer than strictly necessary, and to see him just sitting here, savouring the night, brings unbidden a smile of fondness to John’s face.
"And what about me, hmm? What about the rest of us?" John says, and he doesn't know how, or when, but his feet must've taken him across the room because he's standing right in front of the sofa and Sherlock has to crane his neck to meet his gaze, and
(If John were a wiser man, and perhaps a man with more self-esteem than currently he is in possession of, he might have noticed the slip. Things might then have been resolved rather more quickly. But alas, he doesn’t notice; the moment passes, and the story, as they say, must go on.)
, probably the only person in this world capable of doing something like that. Well done, John.”
John takes a seat next to him, grimacing at the metal slates pressing against his legs, the cold seeping through his jeans. He glances over at his companion, the question
“Sherlock, for the love of – this is a crime scene!” Lestrade squawks, flapping his arms ineffectually (Sherlock and John remain glued at the mouth), “Don’t you have anything better to do?”
John blinks at the suddenly opened door, hand still poised to knock.
Sherlock clears his throat, feeling the need to address a Serious Matter before they both descend into hysteria. "John,
Molly bustles off to the coffee machine, and as John watches, Sherlock peels off his gloves, propping a hip against the counter and leaning forward to say conversationally, “Not dead, by the way.”
John is (rather forcibly) reminded of the conversation he’d had with Sherlock, that first night at Angelo’s. Reminded of how girlfriends are ‘not really’ Sherlock’s ‘area’, of how Sherlock is ‘married’ to his ‘work’. He remembers the crushing disappointment he’d felt back then (and still does now) at the thought of never being able to have what (
When he glances up, it’s to find both Anderson and Donovan smirking at him.
His ‘plan’ consists of taking Sherlock to dinner. (What? He’s never said it was a complicated plan.)
“Morning, John,” Molly says, smiling at him from behind the counter. She’s in the process of pouring a rosetta onto a cappuccino; a loose strand of hair escapes her ponytail and tickles her nose, and she sneezes softly.
"I have something to show you. A little tape that my colleagues filmed while Sherlock was away." she said with another cold smile and went outside to bring a computer. She placed it in front of him.
"Hello Sherlock, the clue was quite easy right? Just walk to the other side of the pool. Do you see the gun?" Sherlock saw it, picked it up and checked it. One bullet.
A long time later, John stood up and dragged Sherlock with him. He picked up a small box wrapped in gray paper from Sherlock's chair and handed it to him. Sherlock sighed and opened his mouth to say something when John interrupted him.
Not really knowing what else to do, he tried to go back to sleep.
Here is the next chapter!
About when John wakes up at the hospital and what happens next.
Sherlock seeks help, and has to face the consequences...
"Light." he mamaged to croak out. Suddenly, the heavy thing that apparently was Sherlock moved away and the lights were dimmed before he felt the bed(?) dip again.
'What would Sherlock have done?' he thought. Well, there was no way to get out of the room, but if he could get free from his bonds, the situation would at least be a bit more comfortable. He tried to wiggle out his hands, that didn't work. Neither did his feet. Maybe he could find something sharp. He looked around and at the same time he heard footsteps. They stopped at the other side of the door, then unlocked it.
He was starting to lose himself in memories of John when a black car with tinted windows pulled up. A young boy with blond hair jumped out of it and ran towards Sherlock. His cheeks were streaky and his lips were trembling. Sherlock sat down, greeted the boy and held him to his chest. It felt strange, to have a complete stranger trust him so. He felt terrified but also a little moved.
The handwriting suggested male. Written in a hurry, he had used a ballpoint pen, blue ink. Sherlock tore it open and his breath stuck in his throat. He heard Mrs Hudson say something but he was to stunned to respond.
-----
So that's why John found himself booking a table at Angelo's, cleaning the flat and brewing tea at 3 in the afternoon on a Tuesday. Sherlock should be home at any time now (Lestrade had just informed him that the case was solved) so he went into their bedroom and changed.
He should have known that it wouldn't last. The fragile thing he and John had built up after the disappointing paternity test and the messy divorce. He should have known he wouldn't be lucky enough to spend the rest of his life with the man he loved most in the world. First Moriarty, then Mary and now this.
The call ended and he walked on wobbly legs towards the crate. His eyes fell on the word on the door. He tried to ignore it while he crouched and removed the lid. The content made him recoil and his hands shake even more. The bottom of the small crate was covered in a red fabric. On top of it was a single syringe filled with a colourless liquid. He picked it up and turned it in his fingers, no colour and no scent. It was impossible to deduce it's content.
"Look at yourself, all lost without him."
He remembered that alley, knew it better than his own hand. He had spent to many drug induced nights there to delete it from his mind. The graffiti had been put there by himself, a reminder of his worth according to the rest of the world.
"Where is he?" he said, keeping his voice low and filled with as much hate as he could manage.
Moriarty led him towards the door to the basement. The basement looked quite big, a corridor with what looked like 4 doors on the left side of it. Moriarty didn't go into either of them. Instead, he knocked on the first one.
What the hell was he supposed to do this time? How would Moriarty want to burn his heart out?
Once again, his body seemed to move on its own. But instead of racing, his mind was completely blank with fear. He could feel and hear his pounding heart in his ears and he could see his fingers shaking as he opened the front door.
"Don't you think you have almost died enough times to save my life?"
"Jack" the boy answered.
"Stand, both of you." Moriarty demanded, smiling. Sherlock obeyed, but had to support almost all of John's weight to keep him upright. Moriarty nodded at Mary, who moved towards them and pulled John towards her. Realising it was useless to resist, Sherlock let her.
"It goes to the archives at Scotland yard. I got permission from Greg to let you have it. You can solve any cold case you want."
=====
The phone rang again. Before he could say anything, the little girl was talking.
"I.." he tried again. "You don't seem to understand why I don't want you to risk your life for me. You don't seem to understand that the only way for my life to be good, is with you in it. And I realise I should have told you a long time ago but, I love you too."
But he hadn't come back. Sherlock assumed he had stayed at Lestrade's or something. Stupid! He should have suspected something, texted him. But he had still seen John's frustrated and hurt face when he had stormed out. He hadn't wanted to upset him more so he hadn't texted him.
He sat there, waiting for the rush that never came. He started to get really anxious at the 2-hourmark.
Always for John, but what if John got angry with him because of this? It wouldn't matter.  A world with a living and angry John would be infinitely better that a world without John.
Now, he was helping John sit down in his chair and making some tea. John liked tea, maybe it would make him less angry.
"Okay, can you take me home?" he asked.
'High functioning sociopath my arse' he thought while he shifted a bit in a failed attempt to get more comfortable.
So it was with cautious steps that he walked up the steps and into the room. 2 windows were open, the wind was making various papers fly across the flat. He quickly crossed the room to close them. When he looked towards the wall over the sofa (where he had pinned every piece of information regarding John's disappearance) there was a new addition. A big photo, hanging slightly askew, representing no-one other that the doctor himself.
You know the deal by now, constructive feedback is very welcomed!
He was almost drowning in worry and despair when a black car pulled up and a little girl with flaming, red hair and a face covered in freckles jumped out of it.
The baby was being cared for by it's biological father who (with Mycroft's help) had gotten full custody.
He checked the pink phone without result, ealked to the window and smoked half a package.
"Didn't enjoy that did you? You won't later either, believe me." She walked out and locked the door.
