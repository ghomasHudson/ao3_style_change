Dean narrowed his eyes, instantly suspicious of this realisation.
“What’s going on, Dean?” Sam cut him off, eyes narrowed at him.
“Yeah, I know.” He half smiled, “None of that’s new though, and I’m very used to it. You ever wonder why none of them are ever around here? Sam’s off at school, but everyone else… well, we don’t get along so well. And since I’m King…” He shrugged.
God, he just wanted to stay like this. He just wanted to lean into this moment for the rest of however long his life was.
Sam moved to lift Dean’s bed, so that he was sitting rather than laying, so that he could see the woman’s face more clearly, see Sam and Cas’ expressions as well.
It was real. Their son was real. Dean’s son. Cas had insisted he be biologically Dean’s. The Winchester family had to live on, and Cas had prayed (not literally) that their son would end up with all the best parts of Dean. When his eyes had gone that fairytale green, he had been overwhelmed with joy.
He stalks forward, and he’s only inches away from Dean when he talks again, poking Dean in the chest, probably too hard.
“If… if this was a chick-flick,” Cas mumbles, his voice sort of slow and tentative, “What would happen next?”
Everything comes to a head.
Dean had once told Cas that he was just a hammer, just a tool of dick angels. Cas had later told him he wasn’t just a tool, that he had thoughts and doubts and his own wants. How appropriate, Cas thinks, that in the end, that dissent will make him permanently human. How poetic that that dissent was born out of love for Dean himself.
“What?”
So Cas’s happy place was… what, a family home? Having a child? Dean wondered idly where Sam was, why he was there but Sam wasn’t.
“Uh, yeah.” He let out a little laugh, as if this was far from the question he was expecting Dean to ask. “Actually, the garden isn’t really mine.” He glanced around the place. “There are some pretty flowers and stuff, but have you noticed anything else walking around?” Dean glanced around, trying to figure out what Castiel was talking about it. It clicked a moment too late.
Cas shook his head, “It isn’t that simple. Nothing with my family is. And I know it isn’t something you really understand but--”
“You don’t… owe me this.” Cas said quickly, “And you don’t seem entirely confident in your decision to…”
Dean has about a thousand more questions, but they all escape him all of a sudden. “How long ago…?” It could’ve been any amount of time for all Dean knows. Sam and Cas could both be…
“I’ll text her myself, Sam. Get her to come here. I’m not above it…” He paused, “Did you even tell her? Or did you just drop off the map?”
“Um, yeah. About… y’know, what happened in there.” Dean’s lips were pursed, and he sort of looked like he was pouting as a result. Cas had to stop himself smiling at that.
It all goes relatively to plan. He sees Jack take the power from Lucifer. He knows -- understands -- that this is what has to happen, but it still doesn’t feel right. He knows about Michael too, that he’ll have to die as well.
For as much as Dean had lost in learning about his free will, Castiel had lost at least as much. For millennia, before Sam and Dean were even a flicker of consciousness in a wide, open cosmos, Castiel had served his Father. He had served Heaven and God and Humanity as he was supposed to. He had done his job, again and again. Done the right thing. Over time, after meeting them, he had begun to lose his faith in his Father. He had begun to question everything, to change his perspective and to lose his faith long before he had found out just how trapped and controlled humanity and even Heaven was. But finding out about Chuck’s writing, about his plan, about the universes upon universes he built up just to torture Sam and Dean. It was one thing to lose his faith believing his Father was an absentee. It was a completely different thing to realise that his father had manipulated all of them since the beginning of time. That they were a game to him, a joke. A source of amusement. To find out that anything he had faith in, even his own Father, wasn’t real. He had tried to keep the faith in Dean and in humanity, but even that had been hard, when Dean had turned on him too.
It seems like a stupid thing to feel emotional over, but Dean and his stupid floodgates are open, so he has to blink back tears. “Bitch.” He answered, trying to sound casual, but having to wipe a tear away as he does. It sort of muddies the effect.
Cas opens his mouth to speak, but Dean presses on. “When I- When I told you no one cares that you’re broken. That was a lie. I care. I care so much sometimes I think it’s going to tear me apart inside and I… I didn’t know how to deal with that. I was scared, and damaged, and I took it out on you. Because I was too weak to be honest. I’ve never been more like my Dad, and I hated it.”
It felt different, Cas noted. More real maybe. Dean’s lips were soft, but the movement felt… awkward, maybe. Like Dean wasn’t entirely comfortable and Cas pulled himself back, slowly untangling Dean’s hand from his tie.
He tried to speak, but his voice sounded croaky and weak, empty. “Heya, Sammy. Cas.”
But the truth was, when push came to shove, and when the whole world was on the line, his choices always favoured the eldest Winchester.
Once Cas got up to go to the bathroom, Dean quietly let himself out, pacing nervously as he waited for Cas to return, waited to tentatively try to pull him out of this. Dean had realised on his own, but things seemed to be different for Cas. Maybe it was a different strain of djinn. Maybe it was different because Cas was an angel.
“For Jack.” He goes on, “The Empty told me… when I allowed myself to be truly happy, it’d come for me. In exchange for the kid.” His throat feels rough and painful, but Dean ignores it. He’ll be damned if he lets his stupid, fallible human body ruin this when they’re already running out of time.
Cas with Meg. An Angel and a Demon, finding some weird middle ground to live in together, no more apocalypses or hell, but instead a kind of freedom.
Dean just sits for a moment, thinking this through. Chuck had said as much, that he didn’t know why this Sam and Dean and Cas didn’t fall to his plans when every other did. Dean had said the same to Cas too-- that he changed Dean. Jack is right, he thinks. He certainly can’t find any reasons to disprove Jack. “Son of a bitch,” He mutters. “Gay love really can pierce through the veil.”
“What?”
“They’ll join you in Heaven. You’ll be waiting for them.”
He wants to say more. He wants to say that he’s spent years dreaming about being together. Not even in any particularly physical way, just little moments. Dean being able to stand closer. Being able to reach out to Cas. Being able to put his hands on either side of Cas’ face, and not just when the angel is dying or seriously injured. He wants to be able to explain how badly he wanted to hug him at times, but stopped himself, damaged and struggling with who he was, with a fear of being rejected by his best friend. He wants to explain how badly he wants to settle down with Cas, to have a house and a bed and a dog. He wants to explain that he thinks he’s beautiful, that he has done for a long time.
Cas tried to smile back, but it looked strained. It looked as though he was exhausted to the point of tears, but Dean didn’t know how to even ask about that.
“He’s fine. A little worse for wear, but fine.” She patted him on the head again, as if he was a baby, “Sleeping.”
When the sounds of… enjoyment settled down, Dean tried not to feel overwhelmed. This wasn’t about him, this was about saving Cas’s life. He had to save Cas’s life. Still he couldn’t do it tonight. He had to get the angel alone. Somehow.
“Hello, Dean.” Dean was standing beside his car, overlooking the beach, overlooking the water. So he had found what Castiel had built for him. He hoped he enjoyed it.
“So… Chuck’s dead?”
“His eyes are open!”
Dean hasn’t been able to stop thinking about what Chuck said to Cas since he absorbed Amara.
He crept closer to the house, keeping away from windows. If he lived here, in Cas’s dream, Dean had to assume this was a better version of himself. Maybe wearing a cardigan and drinking tea, with none of the same chaotic, bloodthirsty energy Dean had never had a say in. At least that would be an advantage.
Why did you even get involved? It’s not your responsibility. I thought you didn’t even like these people...
Cas can’t help but wonder whether or not Sam blames him. Whether he looks at Cas and sees the reason his brother is dead (again). Whether he wishes Cas wasn’t there, since Dean had done it to save Cas. After all, Billie was dying anyway. The only difference it made was that Cas walked out and Dean didn’t.
“Oh. Ain’t no thing.” Dean said casually, but he had that same half pouty look on, like he was trying to find the right words. “But I meant--”
He didn’t ever want or need Dean to say it back. No part of him expected to be loved in return. Castiel wasn’t human, and he knew he wasn’t what Dean wanted. Dean had told him in so many words, had called him a brother. True that it had been years before, but still. Castiel wasn’t naive, not anymore anyway.
Really, he’s already made the call. He already knows what he’s going to say. At least kind of. He’s winging the specific words, but that’s sort of Dean’s aesthetic anyway. He says whatever’s on his mind and inevitably regrets it later.
The nurse was unfamiliar to him, but she talked in a calming voice, and since Dean couldn’t ask any questions, he didn’t. He wanted to rip the things out of him and get going, as was his way. He hated to be fussed over. But no amount of desire to move was going to make him, his body was completely empty. Numb. He was sure it was whatever drugs they had him pumped full of, that he had been incapacatated for a reason. After all, he had been so sure he was never going to get out of there. He had been so sure that the barn was his final resting place on Earth.
“I’m so sorry, Dean,” He lost words here and there, but he caught most of it. Or what he thought was most of it, “I had no idea, the ambulance got there in time but only barely…” Dean lost more, but then he caught, “Been nearly a month…” He lost more, but caught, “Coming now.”
“What do we do?” Jack finally asks, glancing between the other two.
They were the opposite. They were two people who were never meant to fall in love. Two people God himself desperately tried to keep apart. Two people who came together anyway. They weren’t soulmates or foretold, they had chosen this. They had worked for this. They had picked each other.
“Don’t know.” He admitted, “I mean, if we hadn’t lost my Mom and my Dad wasn’t… my Dad, I might’a wanted to be a doctor for all I know. But I was only a kid when everything happened, and I have no way of knowing who else I might’ve been. I mean, I think Sam was predestined to be a lawyer.” He added, “It’s just sort of… who he is. I mean, hell, if he managed that with all the,” He cut himself off before he swore in front of Jack, though Jack wasn’t paying much attention to their conversation, “stuff we grew up with, maybe he would’a been President by now. Or… not, because he’s too young. Maybe he still will be one day.”
“Cas, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, but it’s true. We— We never left the bunker. We go on hunts together. It was you and me who went on this one. We— We split up to go looking for the lair and when I couldn’t get onto you, I went looking. You were strung up by that thing, dying… You gotta believe me, man…”
He knew who he was, and he knew what he was supposed to be, and if all he had to contribute was making Dean Winchester feel loved, keeping him safe one last time… Then so be it.
“Did you ever meet my Dad?” Dean asked with a frown, and he looked pained, like he couldn’t piece together what he was getting at.
Dean wasn’t sure if he could handle seeing Cas happy, a version of his life where he hadn’t ended up stuck in the middle of all this horrible, life wasting bullshit that they had brought him into. If he went into this world, that meant Dean had to face exactly how badly, how irreparably he’d ruined Cas’s life. Taken away any chance Cas had of being actually happy.
“I still can’t believe it.” Dean heard Cas saying. Cas was casually pulling his sweatpants down, and Dean averted his eyes to body snatch Dean, who was doing the same. Well, at least that one was his body. Weird still, but Dean would make do.
Dean must know Cas loves him, Cas has never really hidden it, he just hasn’t been sure exactly how to express it. He must know because Cas has given up everything for him. Absolutely everything, again and again. He’s chosen the Winchesters, even when they’ve had no faith in him. Even when they’ve taken him for granted or sold him out. He’s always chosen Dean.
“I believed you. Twelve years, Dean.”
“Come.” Dean said, his voice unusually soft. He patted the bed beside him and Cas obliged. He moved to sit behind the hunter, and he looked oddly nervous. Removed.
He could hear a dog barking and he followed the source until he found a house, walled up, with a dog barking at him through a gate.
Dean didn’t know where to start with any of the million things he wanted to say.
It already feels like the memory is fading away, like he’s losing his grip on Dean, and Cas would do anything to bring him back. Anything to trade it over, to go in Dean’s place. Dean has already lost so much. Already suffered so much. Cas has tried to help, but he knows he’s made it so much worse at times, that he’s hurt Dean. Betrayed him. He knows he hasn’t earned this gesture.
“Can’t believe what?” Not-Dean asked as he puttered around the room, evidently getting ready for bed. Or… something. Dean had been puttering around up here for hours, but still, this was… domestic.
But the thing was, for as long as Castiel had been waiting for some clarity on what his true happiness was, some part of him always knew.
Cas had decided a long time ago that he would never put that burden on Dean, that he knew Dean didn’t feel the same way, knew he never would. In a way, it was weird Cas had even believed in that fantasy. He was under no delusions about who he was in Dean’s life. He was an ally. A friend. Sometimes not even that, but certainly, nothing more.
“There was… talk of a party. A group of our family who are still alive, coming to welcome you home. I thought… I didn’t think you’d want that.”
“Since I was like, twelve,” Sam admitted with a small smile, “Never knew how to bring it up. But uh… If you want to be with Cas, I think you should be. No one’ll ever know you better… or understand what it’s like for you more. Plus, he’s… he’s family already.” Sam seemed like he was treading very gently, and Dean couldn’t help but laugh. It was watery and weak, but a laugh nonetheless. “You deserve to be happy, Dean.”
It’s before they go to complete the plan that Cas pulls Jack aside. They go off, just the two of them, under the guise of getting some ingredient they need for their fake spell. Cas is spiralling more and more, but he can’t. He doesn’t have the energy, he doesn’t have the capacity. If he lets himself fall to the grief, he knows he won’t get back up. And then what Dean did will be for nothing, so Cas has to carry on. No matter how badly it hurts. No matter how much he feels as though a part of him is irreparably gone.
Dean frowned at him, listening to the explanation. “Wait, you mean… you’re human?” He asked, eyes widening in shock and surprise. In concern. “Cas, you gave up your grace so that I would… so that you could try to keep me alive?”
Cas and Dean had changed each other. Cas had broken Chuck’s script by falling in love with him. Cas had convinced Dean he was more than a killer, more than a monster. Cas and Dean had changed each other irreparably by loving each other.
At some point, Dean stirred, and rather than jumping awake with a knife and a scream, his eyes fluttered open, all green hues and long eyelashes. Cas took it as a testament to how comfortable they were together, to how much Dean trusted Cas to keep him safe and happy, and it made him smile.
Sam takes a few more steps and throws his hands around his brother. Dean accepts the hug, hugging him back. He has a smile on his face and Cas just stares, still trying to find anything. A solid feeling, a solid word, a solid thought. He finds nothing, he just stares.
“Did I ever tell you I didn’t believe in angels?” Dean asks Jack, as they walk through the street they’ve built, the place that will be taken up by the people they love, the new home that was basically like Earth, just without all the pain and suffering and monsters.
But then they’re both healed, human and complete again, no more blood or broken bones, and they’re back in the bunker. Jack is gone, God and all, and the two of them are on their own.
“Am I sure?” Dean repeated, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. “Lean down so I can kiss you, I’m at a distinct disadvantage.”
Sam was wheeling him out into the parking lot and Dean had his arms folded in his lap, just happy to be finally going home. Whatever home was now.
“I didn’t…” Cas said quietly, “But uh… I guess I changed my mind. This is pretty nice.” He glanced back out, and Jack and Claire were holding hands and jumping up and down. There was a fondness to it all, something Dean couldn’t place. How had three men with such horrible fathers managed to raise the wonderful kids in this room?
“Dean, please, I’m not expecting--”
‘I know what you love. There’s nothing for you out there.’
Sam’s eyes narrowed, “You have to think about it? Dean… He’s been your best friend for twelve years. Surely you know whether--”
If Dean has gathered anything, it’s that he and Cas were never meant to become close. Cas rebelled against Heaven for him, and Dean fell in love with an Angel of the Lord.
“No, it’s not. I’ve known him a lot longer.” Sam looks emotional, and Cas decides now isn’t the time to continue the conversation. It took him a long time to grasp human cues, but he is getting better, and Sam is getting far less reserved in his emotional displays.
The Queen’s going to have you killed.
he’s a nice dude. and she reminded me of dad.
“I don’t smell that bad,” Dean defends with a frown, “How can it even still smell like me in there after months.”
The beauty of all of this is that Dean never will have to face it. The empty will come, him and Billie will be taken, and he’ll never have to see Cas’ response. He’ll be in the empty, and Cas won’t be going there. If anyone has to survive, it’s Cas. He and Sam are mortal, but Cas is meant to be in this world. The world isn’t right without Cas in it.
And Cas… Cas could have his own room in the bunker. Stay with Dean, even, if he wanted to.
How ironic then, that Dean himself would never get to enjoy that freedom. How ironic that his final act not be the truly heroic thing they’d finally done, but instead a routine hunt. A piece of rebar on a wall. A coincidence. An accident.
Still, Lucifer is something of an added bonus. Michael too. Cas has nothing good to say about either of them, really, or about any member of his family that’s still breathing. Still, hearing Dean’s voice through the phone is enough to send Cas into a full emotional meltdown. He has neither the time, nor the energy though, so he has to keep going.
Dean just blinks up at him, taken off guard by his sudden appearance.
He had imagined all sorts of alternatives he might find.
“Human emotions are so confusing.” Cas tells him, and Dean nods slowly, his own heart sinking uncomfortably.
it feels like, Jack.” Cas corrected fondly, and he could hear Cas laughing a little as Jack let out a dramatic groan.
“I’m… in my word, you, me, Sam and Jack are living in the bunker.” Dean said softly, “We’re still… y’know, saving people, hunting things…” He trailed off, smiling weakly. “And so are you, Cas. You’re… you got caught by a djinn. We tried everything to get to you but it didn’t work. Rowena sent me in in the hope I could… convince you.”
“I’m sorry.” Dean said again, though he still couldn’t place exactly why he was apologising.
Honestly, Dean’s deal with the Empty was made somewhat in service of Cas anyway. He loves the kid, obviously, Jack had become a part of the family a long time ago-- but he was also thinking of Cas. Cas who had fought his ass off to keep Jack alive, to keep him safe. Dean knew then, as he knows now, that losing Jack would break Cas. Maybe Cas was meant to be a father, Dean thinks. He’s certainly good with Claire, far better than Dean has ever been. He’s a good person, or angel, or whatever, and Dean’s sure that’s why the other angels have always ostracised him the way they do. He’s kind. He’s too kind. He’s too much better than them.
“Heaven.” Jack supplied. “Chuck… didn’t believe in free will. He was a writer, and he wanted to dictate a story. Even in death, his characters were in a prison. Trapped in their own lives. I don’t want that.”
He knows they know more happened than what they’re letting on, but Cas has thus far refused to budge. He’s not even sure why.
He realises that he’s done as much as he can do for them. He’s gone to bat for Sammy again and again, nearly every day of his life. He’s made a deal with the Empty in order to give Jack a life, and to give Cas and Sam back their son. His last possible option, the last thing he can do for his family, the best chance to make them all happy-- is this.
“Like you?”
He couldn’t ever look Dean Winchester in the eye and betray him. They had made mistakes. All of them. But when it came down to it, no matter how Dean felt about him, Cas knew that protecting Dean Winchester had been his priority really ever since he had first met him. Or first put him back together again, anyway.
“Okay, so I’m a total dick.” Dean scoffed to himself.
He thought of Cas. The self hating angel of Thursday with a crack in his chassis. The man who turned his back on everything he ever knew, who defied cosmic definitions and instructions. Who accepted himself and his capacity for love even though it hurt him. Even though he struggled. His Cas. His angel. Castiel had once told Dean he was heartless. Castiel was far from heartless. He had so much love and compassion to give to the world. To his family. He was Dean’s purest belief in humanity. Nobody would ever be perfect, free of darkness or corruption or weakness. Nobody, not even an angel. But Cas’ beauty wasn’t in his perfection. It was in his constant efforts to keep getting better.
He’s so sad. So angry. So happy. So frustrated. So afraid. He feels too many things, and he wonders how Sam or Dean ever managed to explain anything they were feeling. Suddenly, he feels bad for ever thinking they were bad at communication, because for all their suffering, they were still doing a helluva lot better than Cas is right now.
Well, well, well, Cas thought to himself, if it wasn’t the consequences to his own actions knocking on the door. Consequences he had truly never thought he would have to face. The beauty of his final confession was that it was final. He never had to deal with it, never had to see Dean let him down gently, never had to listen to the hunter tell him that this changed everything. He never had to get rejected by the first and only man Castiel had ever or would ever love.
Dean holds him tightly, squeezes his eyes shut. “I know things haven’t always been smooth sailin’.” Dean says softly, patting him on the back of the head, “But I want you to know I love you. We all love you. You’re always a Winchester. And you’re always gonna be our kid.”
Dean wasn’t in Heaven or Hell. Dean was alive.
The hero Cas had fallen for a million years ago, a man cracked and filled with self hate, yet filled with so much love for everyone else, there was barely room for anything else.
“The world wouldn’t be right without you in it, Man. I want you to… to have whatever you want outta this life. You’ve lived so many years for someone else. Please, for me, live some for you now.”
At some point, Dean must’ve fallen asleep in the closet (ugh, the irony) because when he peeked out again, Cas and Not-Dean were laying in bed, wrapped up in each others’ arms, whispering to each other. Dean, again, felt like he was intruding, but he couldn’t quite tear his eyes away.
“Why are you here?” Cas asked. Obviously there was an answer he might want, but ultimately, it would be up to Jack. Whatever Jack said, Castiel would respect that. It was a weird power shift, he realised, but it didn’t matter.
The big brother who raised Sam when he was just a child himself.
Cas thinks some part of him should mourn, but none does. Like Jack himself, Cas has never had a family amongst the angels. The Winchesters were his family. Team Free Will, right here in this bunker.
“I… didn’t know,” Cas says finally, and he can feel tears threatening again. He can feel the indicative tightening in his throat. Oh, to be a real angel again, to forget about all this pain and heartbreak and all this emotion. But no, Cas knows he wouldn’t trade back a single second he got to spend with Dean. A single second he got to spend by this family’s side.
He wishes he has a better idea of what to create for Cas, but he can think of little other than an excess of honey, and a place just for him. The room he should’ve had in the bunker.
Again, any/all feedback is welcomed and appreciated!
Cas and Dean had changed the world irreparably by loving each other. Saved it, even.
Dean sighs, knowing Sam is right, but not really ready to handle whatever waits for him outside the barn.
“A few weeks,” Jack admits. “I had things to do. Before I could get you.”
Green eyes flickered open, but Dean couldn’t see anything. Everything looked blurry and unclear. Too bright, too white, too uncomfortable. What memory was this? Why was he still in pain? Surely death would take that away.
Standing in front of him in the same yellow jacket he often wore, with one hand held up at his side and a friendly hello.
Dean’s eyes flick up, and he finds himself focusing on the features of Cas’ face. How many times has he found himself accidentally staring at Cas’ lips? How many times has he stared into his eyes, the blue a constant amongst all the blood and death? How many times has he dreamt of him? Of being together, of belonging to each other?
He could see the food— hamburgers, like Dean often cooked in the bunkers.
Cas laughed then, as though it was hilarious, and Dean glanced over, smiling back at him almost instinctively, sort of proud to have elicited that full, happy sound from him.
Dean bit back a breath, and his voice came out shakier than he thought it was going to. “Jesus, Sammy, how long have you been holding onto this speech?”
“You should probably go talk to him.”
Maybe he would just… never mentioned being here for this. For Cas’s health and his own.
“No, he can’t. But he did what he did because he wanted us to live. Because he wanted us to be happy and have lives.” He sighs, “I know it’s not the same without him, but--”
“Cas?” He managed to ask and Rowena shushed him again.
“So… you’re my husband?” Dean asked, trying hard to contain the little smile that pulled at his lips.
Cas collapses into himself, sobs until he thinks he can’t take it anymore. Until he thinks his whole vessel -- his whole body -- might fall apart.
“See, thing is, Cas, I, uh… I know what you are. I know you’re different than me and Sam, and I know… I know that I haven’t always treated you right. I have… a lot of shit I wanna apologise for, but not a lot of time.”
she looked at me like i was lunch
But something about this did feel final to Dean. All that time being pulled along like a puppet of Heaven or Hell. It was just him now. Just Dean, living the consequences of his life. Just a person, like any other.
“You and Eileen were… she was… You were coming over for Christmas dinner.” Dean explained, not wanting to throw Cas in it too much. Wasn’t like he controlled the fantasy.
At some point, Jack asked him whether he was going to go to see Dean and Castiel just shrugged.
“You guys are disgusting, y’know that?” Claire told them.
Cas is still learning how to exist as a hunter without his angel powers. He can’t just smite them, and he’s only got human strength. He’s no slob, even as a human, but he’s not Dean or Sam either. He’s never needed to be before now.
Getting there wasn’t any easier.
“I absorbed Michael and Lucifer’s energy when they died, and Castiel’s grace, and—“
“Finally!” Dean jumped visibly when he heard Sam’s voice from outside and Cas chuckled.
Himself, wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants, looking relatively normal. Claire, as she always was, a badass little blonde with a smirk on her face. Jack, opposite Claire, seemingly bickering with her about something. He looked the same as always, healthy and happy and normal.
‘I, uh, don’t know if you wanna see me or not,’ Dean’s voice sounded as gruff as ever, more so maybe, and Castiel thought he could hear nervousness in his voice. Maybe seeing Cas now made him uncomfortable. ‘I’m sorry I did such a shitty job of not dyin’ just after you sacrificed yourself for me, but uh… I think we should talk. If… y’know, if you want to. Just uh… y’know. Drop in. Fly in. Whatever.’ He heard Dean clear his throat and Castiel couldn’t help but smile. Though fear seemed to fill him up inside, there was something so endearing about listening to Dean struggle to find words to summon him, even after all this time.
He knew he was going to die and that there would be no reprieve, no second chance.
The other Dean… the other Dean looked like a war torn hunter who’d been to hell and back again. Cas desperately didn’t want to know, but he knew.
Dean swallows, and Cas’ eyes are wide and afraid. Dean thinks maybe he’s starting to realise what’s happening.
Jack glances up at him, “No. But I’m not surprised,” He answers with a half smile, “You’ve always been cynical.”
“What do you mean thoughts?” Dean practically growled. He knew exactly what Sam meant, but it was easier to play dumb when he had no good answer. “Thoughts about what?”
For one thing, he knows that in this world, this world and no other, Cas betrayed Heaven for them. Actually, Dean knows that Cas did it for him, specifically. He knows this because Cas has told him, more than once, and yet it still feels like some abstract thing, something that can’t possibly be true. He still doesn’t know, even now, what that means.
They all move to get into the car, and instinctively, Dean goes for the driver’s seat. Sam has to throw him the keys, but they settle back into their usual rhythm fairly quickly. Sam is shotgun, Cas is in the back, there’s Zeppelin blaring through the speakers as they drive back towards the bunker.
The group of them were sitting in a little dining room. A room Sam and Eileen had booked, with a pretty beach on display through the glass behind them. Pinks and purples and blues and oranges stained the sky,
Dean’s family had always been everything in the world to him, and he knew why now more than ever. They weren’t perfect. They weren’t functional. They weren’t undamaged and they weren’t special. Not anymore, anyway. They were just people. Just people who truly believed that they should leave the world better than they found it.
Miracle has taken up residence in Dean’s bed too. The dog never got to meet him, and Cas thinks that’s a travesty, especially since the dog sort of reminds him of Dean somehow, but when he found the creature out in the middle of nowhere, he figured he needed to take it home. If not for himself, then for Dean. He knows Dean would’ve taken it in, and besides, the bunker feels too empty now.
“I’m uh… not sure what to say,” Dean said with an awkward chuckle.
“Angels don’t sleep.” Dean grumbled back.
“Why me?” Dean asked with a frown.
“You’re smart though,” Cas argued, shaking his head, “And obviously determined, raising a kid when you were just a kid yourself. I mean, surely you could’ve done absolutely anything you’d put your mind to.” The King seemed so invested. Arguing seriously that Dean was smart. Dean wasn’t too sure that was entirely true.
Michael’s body falls, and Chuck rounds on Cas and Sam. Jack is still laying by the bank of the water, either knocked out or pretending to be. Michael’s grace will have gone to him, his power, and Jack now has every bit of two archangels and a third angel’s power inside him. Cas can feel it, even as a human, and he wonders how Chuck can’t.
“No.” Jack always sounded so calm, Dean notes quietly, like he wasn’t bothered by any of it. “He’s alive, but human. He’ll waste away and die like every other human. Totally powerless.”
When they got to the spot in the garden where Cas wanted to set up with Jack, Dean stood on one side of him, and Benny and Jo were on the other, the lot of them carefully examining the surroundings to make sure that Cas and Jack would be safe. It was inside the grounds of the palace, but they had no reason to be any more relaxed about it, especially considering the creepy connotations that some of them had taken. Dean still hadn’t forgotten about the implication that there was some secret he hadn’t been let in on, but he hadn’t broached it again since, considering Cas had been so… exaggerated about the whole thing. So irritated with Dean.
‘Cas, you got your ears on?’ Cas always had his ears on for Dean. Dean, who wouldn’t pray to God, but who prayed to him. Who trusted him enough to pray to him. To call for him. Cas waited for more, waited for an explanation. He figured he’d have to face it eventually, the awkwardness of what had happened. He figured Dean might just… sort of stop talking to him after this. Been uncomfortable or overwhelmed. After all, Cas had hurt him so many times. To turn around and have to see that?
He had accepted the apology because, as painful as it had been, he had to. He was irreparably bound to the Winchesters in a way he wasn’t sure he could ever make his peace with.
It was over a decade of waiting, and yet it was so worth it. Seeing the sleepy smile on Dean’s face as he leaned up to kiss Cas first thing in the morning.
“It’s over, Dean.”
Jack laughs, shakes his head, and gives Dean a fond look. Dean moves to sit on the porch of the house he’s made. It’s empty, built for his family, not a necessity, but an offering. They can have whatever they want when they come here, but Dean has to wait somewhere. This is as good a place as any.
It’s a snap, and Cas has almost never heard Sam react like that. At least, not often. Dean has always been the more prickly of the two, though without Dean, the dynamics have changed somewhat.
Dean Winchester, the Righteous Man, the Michael Sword, Chuck’s favourite pet, fell in love with a fallen angel, and there’s no going back.
Dean frowns at Sam, and he thinks Sam might be able to yell at him too, so, hunching his shoulders over like a child, only partly for Sam’s amusement, he follows Cas outside of the barn. The whole thing is so awkward, and Dean knows that’s partially his fault, but fuck, how do people do this?
“You know, we could do this.” Cas said in a quiet voice. “We could do the wedding thing.”
If he could only go back and tell a twenty-six year old Dean that now… He was sure the younger version of him would hit him. But then, Dean has always struggled with his anger. With his resentment. His life, as long as he can remember, has been about other people. Dean has never regretted a second of that-- every choice he’s ever made has been worth it if it ends with his family free and happy. But Dean could never have known where he’d be now. He never would’ve guessed he’d fall for an angel. That he’d raise a nephilim son.
Cas’s brows raised, shocked. Was he hearing Dean right? Was he understanding right? He was thankful he was an angel and not a human, because he had learned that this body could, in fact, blush while he was in that place, and he was sure he would be now.
“What are you looking for?” Cas asked, nose scrunching up, head tipping. He couldn’t figure out what Dean was trying to say, all he’d expressed so far was shock, which Cas took as a polite form of discomfort.
After this, it won’t matter. He’ll be gone and Cas will be free. He keeps telling himself that, over and over, that this is about Cas. This is about family. This is about keeping his family alive. This is about making sure Cas knows Dean loves him. That he’s always loved him.
There’s a part of Dean that longed for a house with a garage and a picket fence and a kid and a pool and a Christmas Tree. Things he’s never had, things he’s always shoved down wanting, because it was too hard. Because it hurt too much to want things he’d never have.
“C’mon, Claire, everyone’s comin’ tomorrow night. This is our family dinner.” Not-Dean said, and Dean noted his mannerisms. No different than his, he’d say. His voice was no less gruff. He didn’t look younger or inherently softer. He just looked like him. Something was off though, and Dean couldn’t put his finger on it.
Dean sighed, frowning, “But Cas…”
He was freezing though, so wherever he was, he should’ve brought a bigger coat. He wished Cas’s fantasy world could’ve at least involved the sun.
Once again, I'm just here to talk about how INCREDIBLE this art is. This is the art that I originally chose, and I am still absolutely floored by how incredible it is!
Castiel had to stop and centre himself. He had to stop to think. In thousands upon thousands of years of life, Castiel had never been in love before Dean. He had, for a time, thought he cared about Meg in the same way. Or April, maybe. He realised now he had been trying, fruitlessly, to fill the void that Dean had left in his life. The aching want he knew he could never meet.
But when Sam caught his eyes, he got to his feet, and Dean heard the deep, familiar voice call out for a nurse or a doctor, for anyone.
Dean stares at him a moment, waiting for the other shoe to drop. “And…?” He asks, confused. “What do you mean get me?”
When he woke for a second time, things cleared a little quicker. He managed to make out Sammy, sitting beside a bed, book in hand. He couldn’t make out the book his younger brother was reading at all, but he could see Sam. There was a paper cup of coffee between his knees and he looked exhausted, like his eyes were hanging out of his head. His hair was pulled back into a ponytail thing which was, in and of itself, a sign something was wrong.
He just blinked at her, and Sam sighed, “Profound bond, remember? He likes you better.”
“I apologise.” Cas repeated, measured. He had no idea what else he was supposed to say. The djinn had basically said it all for him, he supposed.
He felt Dean’s hands rest on his cheeks, and he took that as a good sign, pulling Dean closer. He might never get another chance, but he wanted Dean to understand, even without words, how loved he was. How adored. How special Cas thought he was, even despite seeing the worst, the darkest, the most broken parts of him.
He hates it.
He wasn’t ready to face what he’d said. He wasn’t ready to face the pity or rejection in Dean’s eyes. He wasn’t ready to live with knowing that it really was over. That his hope really was gone. Any tiny sliver of hope in his mind that Dean might love him back would be shut down forever.
How Sam’s speech had made them all cry.
“Dean can’t want anything, he’s dead.” Cas would be angry at Sam for answering so harshly, if not for the way his voice cracked when he spoke. In the end, it softens Cas rather than hardens him. He knows how Sam is hurting-- he is too.
Dean stayed put, waiting to find out more, having no other choice but to lay there, when he saw another familiar figure come through the door.
He looked down at his hands in his lap and Dean went on scratching behind Miracle’s ear, who panted happily from his spot on Dean’s legs. Dean thought it would be good for him, in one way, because Miracle would never get kicked off because Dean’s legs were asleep now, at least. He tried to find a thousand silver linings. Little things. But really, it all came back to this.
Right. Castiel had made the decision to save Dean, to give absolutely everything up and to be totally honest. He didn’t regret it in any capacity, he had made the decision because Dean was worth it to him.
It was a little while later when his angel joined him, sitting casually on Dean’s lap, as he sometimes did. Time had softened them both, allowed them to get comfortable with their relationship. With their feelings. Honesty had long since come to them, and vulnerability had long since been proved safe. They held each other's' hearts, and they each protected the other’s’.
nah but i might’ve fought with michael if i hadn’t left when i did
“Cassie is a dinosaur.” Jack said seriously, as though he’d put a lot of thought and time into the whole thing, his big eyes fixed on Dean, telling Dean he should be paying complete attention to this. “Jo is a kitty. Benny is a shark. You’re a tiger.” His inability to correctly pronounce ‘r’ sounds sometimes made him hard to understand, but Dean just grinned at the boy. It was so cute, hard to dismiss in any way, though he had no idea how Jack had come to assign any of those animals to any of them.
“Dinner’s ready.” Dean heard the gruff voice call out, and it took him a split second too long to place his own voice. The deep, gravelly timber of his own tone that he was not at all used to hearing from so far away.
“Well, you weren’t supposed to happen. Everything else… it was what he planned, right? Like those books, like… like eating Amara. Everything else was a plan of some kind. But not you two. Never, not in any other universe, did you…” He gestures vaguely, like he’s trying to find the right description. Love isn’t something Jack is particularly knowledgeable about, but which of their family is? “You changed each other. And it saved the world.”
He couldn’t even easily recall his top ten most painful days, because there were a shitload of those as well. He thought he was knocked unconscious or thrown into a wall more days than not, and he wasn’t sure if there were any ways he hadn’t felt his body get broken yet.
Sam sounded concerned when he answered, “Are you sure? You haven’t been human long and…”
“Oh.” He nodded, “You mean you and Charlie.”
Dean walked away for a moment under the guise of getting water, but honestly just feeling incredibly overwhelmed.
Jack shoots him an inquisitive look, but Dean just shakes it away casually.
“Yes. Thank you for getting me out.” Cas said with a nod. He knew he was sort of playing dumb, pretending that that was what Dean was getting at when he was sure they both knew full well that wasn’t what they had to discuss here.
“Don’t.” Cas was saying quickly, “Our son— our son is real. He’s yours. He has your eyes. Your freckles.”
Three words. Dean only needs to say three words. Just three words and it’s all out there. He knows it’ll come for him, he knows it’ll be quick. He knows it’ll take Billie. He knows Cas will blame himself, but at least Cas will live on.
Dean waves it off, “Long story. Your uncle trapped Sammy in a time loop where I died like a thousand times over. Got a piano dropped on me.”
This was, in a way, a freedom for Sam too. A freedom to go on living for himself and not for Dean.
“I’m sorry.”
But Cas knows now, Dean has done the honesty thing, and there’s no re-closing those doors. He can’t pretend anymore, not even to himself, and he’s sure Jack can see it too.
“You wouldn’t be the first.” Cas said, shooting him a grin. Not for the first time, Dean thought to himself that he understood why Cas was so popular with his people. Dean would likely feel similarly if he was a constituent. Maybe he did anyway.
He deserved to be mad. He deserved to be sad. He deserved to be terrified. And he was. Castiel could see it in his eyes. Maybe he wouldn’t admit it, but he was terrified. Terrified and alone in that moment, because he could never really be honest about it.
He tries not to think about a human Cas. He tries not to think about Sam and Cas in the bunker, trying to move on. He tries not to imagine being able to sleep in Cas’ arms. He tries not to imagine the three of them ageing and going on a holiday together. Tries not to think about how if Sammy ever does get married, he won’t be there. He tries not to think about Sammy having a kid he’ll never get to meet. He tries not to think about the inevitable future where Cas moves on. Tries not to think about all the things he’ll miss, and how desperately he wanted to live.
Still, everything had to come to an end at some point. At least he would see him one more time.
Cas ran his fingers through his fiance’s hair, taking note of all the little details. He loved being able to do this, being able to just watch him when he was actually peaceful and happy. Cas so rarely saw him like this, and it had taken years of relative quiet before he had slept well enough for Cas to be able to just spend these moments.
“Well… You can be… fake you.” Cas said awkwardly and they stared at each other in loaded silence for a moment before they both began laughing.
“I don’t know, Sam. I have to… think about it.”
Cas stood and he watched and he begged Jack to let him go, to let him save Dean Winchester one last time.
“Dean…”
“Jerk.”
He had been told before by others too. Michael had told him, from inside Dean’s head, that he tolerated him. He had been told so many times and by so many people that he was nowhere near as important to them as they were to him. He knew it was true. It had been clear so many times, and never more so than after Jack’s death at Chuck’s hands. He understood that his value to them was far different than their value to him.
Cas frowned, “This was a horrible way to respond to me suggesting we get married.”
“Cas, what I’m trying to say is--”
He tried to lift his head enough to look around, but nothing happened, like he had no control at all. He could hear voices, but they seemed faint and far away, like he was underwater.
The group of them, their family, have become so intrinsically linked to each other. It’s not normal, Cas supposes, but what about them is. They don’t have jobs and lives and homes and children and Christmas days. They have each other. They’ve only ever had each other. Whenever one of them was missing, they could never be whole.
He had no idea whether he’d made things weird, ruined the relationship irreparably. He had no idea whether Dean still thought of him as a problem, or whether they were even anything anymore.
Jack told him about how Dean and Sam were safe. How Dean had adopted a dog and called it Miracle. About how Dean was applying for a job and they were living safely in their homes. About how they were starting over.
But then, there was Jack.
When Cas took Sam’s spot beside Dean’s bed, he tried to figure out what to say. How to broach any of this.
Why did it always feel like there was some implication he was missing?
He could pretend that he hadn’t had Dean in mind when he took to trying to build and create Heaven. He would be lying. It wasn’t that it was for him, specifically. It was for a lot of people. It was just that it was Dean who had allowed him to understand what true peace was.
Still, it’s not about Cas’ face. Not really. It’s a bonus, but it isn’t only this face he loves. It’s Cas, for everything he is. For his loyalty and his sacrifice and his rebellion and his humour and for all the times Dean has felt like the world was on fire, only to look over and find Cas at his side. He would love Cas in any body, in any world.
Jack nods, but then turns to him, brows furrowing, “Piano? Again?”
Cas wonders if Sam needs to know. He wonders if Sam is desperately holding onto a sense of purpose so he doesn’t break apart in the wake of Dean’s sacrifice. If that’s what it is, Cas can’t blame him. He feels like he’s falling apart himself.
“Dean, you-- you don’t have to--”
Jack had a little flower gripped into his tiny, dimpled fist, which he stared down at curiously, as if it was the most exciting thing in the world. He was clearly trying to be gentle with it, which only made the whole thing more endearing. “If I could be an animal,” Jack mumbled, “I’d be a flutterfly.”
He has no idea how long it’s been, but the fact that he’s here means it worked at least. Maybe he can go to sleep. He knows he fought his way out last time, but this is different. He’s made his peace with this as his ending. He figures his last act should be one of love rather than violence. He figures that’s a far nicer fate for him, and if he got to choose his own legacy, that’d be it.
“You don’t have to,” Cas cut in, a frown on his face, afraid to hear it. Afraid of what it would mean to hear it. Afraid of how it would break his heart. “You don’t have to say anything, it’s… it’s fine.”
Dean glances up, surprised by Jack’s answer somewhat. He waits for the kid to elaborate.
The choice to give himself up for Jack was easy. Jack was an innocent. He had life still to live. Dean was old now for a hunter, and he was only ever going to die bloody. There is no other ending for someone in this life, particularly not a Winchester. At this point, Dean considers both Jack and Cas Winchesters.
Dean knew he was a hard person to love, even then. He knew Cas didn’t fully understand him.
Cas couldn’t stop it, a grin pulled across his face. “Yeah. Yeah, I think we could arrange that. I’m sure Sam will help. Sam?”
Cas certainly has too.
Cas had lived a thousand lifetimes, watched the rise and fall of the ocean, the dawn of each day, the beginning of everything, the evolution and destruction of dynasties and civilisations and yet… nothing compared to waking up with the man he loved.
Dean glanced over at Sam and scoffed, “Dude, that was like nine years ago.”
Dean groaned, and someone patted his head. “There, there, little hunter, you’ll be up and ready to try to fight the sun again in no time.” The familiar Scottish voice told him.
When they were back in the monotone, blindingly bright room Cas had come to associate with only bad things, he began to wonder what exactly Jack wanted his help in fixing.
“You know, there was somethin’ else about that world I kinda wanted.” Dean admitted, taking another step closer to Cas, as if finding a way to be comfortable in close proximity with Cas after having discussed. Cas waited for him to elaborate, brows raised. “The… family Christmas. You think we could do that? Invite Jody and the girls? A Christmas Tree? Charlie, Bobby, all of ‘em?”
“You’re God.” Cas filled in, his eyes wide and fixed on his son.
Dean scoffs, but can’t deny it. “Can you blame me, kid?”
He knows it was a long shut, but he had to try, right?
“I did.” Sam and Cas both look up, obviously shaken from their hushed and serious conversation by the sight of the youngest member of their family.
Dean’s brows raised, “I thought you didn’t want to do that?”
Cas isn’t ready to think of Dean in the past tense. He isn’t ready for Dean to be gone.
“Not what I expected.” Dean grumbled and Sam nodded, waiting pointedly for Dean to elaborate. “We were married.”
“That’s not-- I’m not looking for an apology, Cas.” Dean groaned, seeming frustrated.
“Yeah, I do.” He walks closer and rests a hand on Dean’s shoulders, “Just in case you were wondering, from the bottom of my heart, I do not care. You’ll always be my jerk big brother.”
“Sammy. You’re my little brother. You’re my best friend. For a long time, family was just you and me. Just a set of initials scratched into an impala. It was cereal in a motel room at two o’clock in the morning and pranks on the road to different hunts. But our family expanded. To include everyone else in the room… Someone really wise once told me family don’t end in blood. Our family never did. But if there’s one thing I’m really sure of… it’s that I couldn’t be happier to have Eileen joinin’ our family. Officially. ‘Bout time we had another female Winchester. And just remember, if you have a son, Dean or Deanna. Either works.” He flashed a grin, and he heard a few people whooping and cheering as he took a sip of his drink.
There was no guarantee they’d ever be truly safe. That people or monsters would ever stop coming after them.
It was strange, Cas realised, to know you had raised God. He had no idea what that meant for him, or for the Winchesters, but he was too busy trying to wrap his head around this change.
Cas wanted to be there. He wanted to be there when Dean got to Heaven, to be able to hug him and to tell him he was sorry and that he designed this for him. That he wanted him to have a life. That it wasn’t fair and he knew it wasn’t fair and he wished he could’ve saved him just one more time.
Dean learns more about the threats to Cas and Jack and gets to spend some quality time with Jack.
“Be nice.” Cas chastised Not-Dean, and Not-Dean winked at him. Okay, a little weird, but not unheard of. They had winked at each other plenty before, especially when they were sassing each other about nothing.
“Yes, I know. It was my job to know. You were supposed to Michael and Lucifer’s vessels.” He recalled with a nod.
Sam shrugs again, but actually answers this time. “He’s human now.” Sam says softly, “And you… sorta left him in a weird place.”
And so Castiel accepted it, because he had no other choice. But somehow, mourning Dean was worse than dealing with his own death. Because Dean was supposed to live. Dean was supposed to finally be free.
“How many times have we talked about this?” Cas said with a soft sigh, “Dean, you absolute moron, I don’t want anyone else. I don’t want more lifetimes. I already lived thousands without you. This… this is worth it.”
Sam sighs, and Dean immediately knows what’s coming. “You’re not that stupid, Dean. Go.”
It’s normal. They deserve normal, both of them.
Cas still felt as breathless as the first time Dean had kissed him. Ever since he was charged with caring for Dean, this was all he had wanted. Dean was all he had wanted. He had long since given up on ever getting it when Dean had kissed him. It’d been such a shock too. Dean being injured. Cas being terrified he was going to die. Cas begging him not to die, not having the mojo to stop it. Dean whispering that he was fine. Laying there a moment longer before surging up, capturing Cas’s mouth in a kiss.
Dean’s green eyes were wide and locked on him and Cas couldn’t look away. The self-loathing, self-sacrificial hunter with a death wish and a penchant for swearing at angels. On his knees, bloodied and bruised and half beaten to death, pleading with Cas, telling Cas that he needed him. Standing in front of him, arms outstretched, eyes desperate.
Castiel still didn’t fully understand how Jack had swung this. He supposed he had all the power now, that what he said went. But maybe it was really just that the Empty wanted to sleep, and that Castiel had a habit of waking it. Either way, Castiel was allowed to leave, and the Empty was returned to sleep, per Jack’s promise.
It’s Cas who eventually breaks away, and Dean hears a sort of mournful whine escape his own mouth.
Dean scoffed, looking a little embarrassed suddenly. “Haven’t had any complaints before,” he grumbled, shrugging his shoulders. “I wasn’t… I know I don’t owe you. I just… I wanted to do it again. After… that time in the dream. Y’know, where you actually know it’s me.” He explained, awkwardly.
He had spent his entire life fighting to be free, fighting to keep the people he loved safe, fighting to be a hero and to have all the suffering mean something. He had finally defeated the big bad, the final boss, the God he had never wanted to face. He had finally secured the only freedom he would ever get to have. They had lost so many people along the way, nearly everyone they’d ever loved, and more than once. But they had gotten there. They had gotten that ending, done something actually meaningful with their life. They hadn’t just freed themselves, they’d freed everyone.
But they were all struggling. They were all trying to make peace with a huge change.
It was the Doctor who finally answered him. She was kind in her mannerisms, but her sympathetic smile only set his teeth on edge.
“Dada, put me down!” All four of the adults in their party stopped walking.
Sam and Cas both looked on the verge of crying, which only made Dean less comfortable about it all. Less confident in where this was going.
Cas glanced up, seemingly surprised by that response. “Huh?”
“Don’t.” Cas cut him off. “Stop it. All your life, you’ve always worried how everything you do affects everyone else. You’re not allowed to feel guilty for this too. I forbid it.”
Maybe he’s misunderstood Dean. The nonchalant way Dean is looking at him makes Cas feel like maybe he’s misunderstood. Still, he can’t help it. It doesn’t matter-- if he’s going to embarrass himself, so be it. It’s not like there’s anything Sam doesn’t already know at this point.
“Okay, Dean.” He says quietly.
“Then let me go,” Cas pleaded, and Jack shook his head.
The only man Dean has ever been really in love with. The only man he ever will be now.
“I’ve spent this whole time trying to protect this family. And I have failed.” Cas is spiralling and it isn’t hard for Dean to notice. He’s heard him get like this before, but this is somewhat different. He’s spiralling because Billie is coming, and because Chuck is more powerful than ever, and because they are both almost certainly going to die. There’s no way Billie will stop at attacking Dean and they both know it. She wants Cas dead too, has wanted that for a long time.
“I was lying. Twelve years, Cas.”
Still, Dean took what he could get, and twenty minutes later, Dean was over the wall. Or on it, at least, trying to figure out how the hell he was going to get down without alerting anyone or breaking a limb.
Sam rolled his eyes about him, “Thoughts about your best friend’s dream world having the two of you married, asshole. What do you think about that?”
Cas fiddles awkwardly with the hem of his shirt, and it takes Dean a second too long to realise. It’s his shirt. Or it was, anyway. It’s not the first time Cas has worn his clothes, he doubts it’ll be the last, but it takes on a new meaning now. After everything else, everything Dean said.
Maybe he would be a human. Like Emmanuel, living with a wife and a child. Maybe he’d still have Claire, but have a wife too, and a cat. Just a normal man, getting to live without the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Dean Winchester was dead.
“They’re pretty.” He said casually, and Dean couldn’t help but think the kid was lucky to be raised by Cas. He couldn’t imagine Naomi being okay with her son saying such a thing so casually.
“Absolutely I do.” Dean grinned, getting to his feet to take his plate to the kitchen. Cas was already there, washing his own and Jack’s plates, and he felt Dean’s arms wind around him, pulling him tight against Dean’s chest.
He tried to mouth Cas’ name, but failed. He heard his own name come from Cas’ mouth and he desperately wanted to reach out to him, but he couldn’t find any strength.
After a few moments of Castiel feeling totally dizzy in love and stuck in the moment, he found himself blinking his eyes back open, coming back to reality. Everything seemed to bright for a moment, too stark.
Dean realised he would need to get inside the house. These people didn’t look too much like hunters, so maybe Dean could sneak in without too much interference.
“Sam…?” He called as he woke up, instinctively.
Castiel sighed deeply before he spoke again. “No.” He licked his lips. “Jack pulled me out of the Empty. He told me I could return to Heaven, help to rebuild it, be a real Angel again.” He took another sharp breath, as though he didn’t want to say it, before explaining. “When I saw what happened, the… the rebar, I asked Jack to heal you. To let me heal you. He said no. He said we weren’t interfering anymore, that we couldn’t interfere anymore. I couldn’t let it go. He told me… That if I wanted, he could return me to Earth. Allow me to try to save you through… human means. But that if I did that… I would be human. That there could be no more… cosmic imbalance. That the saving could only be through human means.”
Dean wasn’t meant to love. Dean was meant to be a being of pure destruction, as Chuck had created him. In the end though, Cas is what changed him, because he’s not pure destruction. Not anymore. Love has outweighed his anger, and Dean has spent ten years denying it out of fear that it would never -- could never -- be reciprocated. Dean doesn’t know how to love without breaking, but it no longer matters, he realises. Dean can’t break Cas now, not when he’ll be gone any second. All Dean can do is what Dean has always been best at. Throwing himself in the line of fire to save the ones he loves.
Cas still didn’t understand what Dean was talking about, or what any of this had to do with Cas and his stupidly revealing djinn poisoning.
“You have to talk about it sometime, Cas.” Sam is saying, and Cas isn’t listening.
This is his true happiness. Leaving his family as okay as he possibly can, leaving them all knowing they were loved. By so many people, and so, so much, but never by anyone more than him.
first of all, she’s not a queen. she was never technically a queen. she’s a consort. but yes.
Dean hates to think he’s done anything like that to Jack, so if this is his last chance, he’ll try to impart him with love. With affirmation. “I’m proud of you.” He tells him, and he means it. He couldn’t be prouder of Jack.
Hours passed and they chatted away. Jack about whatever random thing crossed his mind, Cas generally about the Kingdom and plans he had, Dean told them a bit more about his home and his upbringing, a bit more about some of his previous jobs. Cas never interrupted him, and he listened as if what Dean had to say was just as important, though he was a King and Dean was a bodyguard.
Dean blinked, looking around with absolutely no clue where he was. He didn’t recognise the surroundings. The trees and weather looked like Kansas in December, maybe, but it was hard to tell. Dean had been all over America in his years as a hunter, and it did start to blend together a bit.
He just wanted Dean to know that despite all the anger, despite all the pain and blood and violence and suffering and every horrible thing he knew Dean thought about himself, he was loved. He wasn’t just the ‘Righteous Man’ or his father’s soldier or some character created to fulfil Chuck. He was a fully realised human being, and one who had made a heartless Angel of the Lord fall in love. For the very first and only time.
Sam was telling him to hold on, telling him he could get help and Dean was trying to convince him that it was okay, that it was the end and that that was okay, because at least they were free, and because things were different, and because Sam having a life without him couldn’t be so bad. All these years of having nobody except each other, of slowly growing their family outside of themselves, outside of blood… Maybe it was time Sam got to live a life outside of worrying about Dean. Outside of their priority always being each other.
He tried to imagine what Dean would want, and he found himself building a beach, the place that Dean said he had always wanted to holiday with. He tried to build in a place where his family could be close. He gave the Harvelles back their Roadhouse, gave John and Mary back the family home they had never gotten to raise their kids in (though truthfully, Castiel didn’t have many positive thoughts about John Winchester). He gave Kevin and his Mom a place, Kelly, even Ketsch. All the people that he hoped the Winchesters would get to see again one day.
He actually didn’t know where to start with his questions.
He sounds harsher than he means to, but he’s worried and confused and Jack is looking at him with that puppy expression that reminds him so much of Cas that Dean wonders if they’re not biologically related somehow. It makes his heart ache, reminds him of Cas and of Jack and of their lives and their family. Jack is here, but Dean is still all anxiety. He did what he did so they could be safe— so why is Jack here at all?
“What do you mean, more than it is?” He blinked back at Cas, and Cas wondered how they were ever going to solve this when neither seemed to be following what the other was saying. “What is it?”
Dean smiled a little, “You say that as if this won’t just go in a cyclical fashion forever. As if you, me and Sam won’t just live in a bubble of each blaming ourselves for each other, just like we always have.” He waited a moment, as if trying to figure out how to proceed with the conversation. “They’ve been teachin’ me how to use the wheelchair.”
“If he died so that we could live, then… we have to do that. And we don’t live unless Chuck gets stopped. Not really. I know I’m not as strong as Michael or Lucifer, but… it will help. It will still make you stronger.”
“Cas, I--”
Between them all, Jody, Donna, Claire, Alex, Patience, Kaia, Bobby, Charlie, Stevie, Adam, Jack, Sam, Eileen, Cas, Miracle and Dean, they weren’t many. But they were an excitable, supportive group. A family. Closer still since God was gone, since Dean had retired, since he and Cas had bought a house together, one that was easier for Dean to get around, easier for him to have some control. His wheelchair had a devil’s trap on the side, some kind of funny nod to his past in Sam, Cas and Eileen’s eyes.
He crept into the ensuite bathroom and found two toothbrushes. Two towels. A flannel hanging over a rack. A hamper with normal, married people clothes and underwear in it.
“He’d want to see you.” Jack told him. He gave Castiel a pointed look and Cas just sighed. He supposed being God probably had some perk of knowledge, that he probably knew what had happened. Or maybe he was just observant. Everyone else, barring Dean himself, had already realised that Castiel was in love with him.
“You changed my mind.” Dean says slowly, and he forces himself to look into Cas’ eyes. They’re cloudy with confusion, but still a more brilliant blue than Dean ever believed in before he met Cas. His lips are parted slightly, and he looks completely lost, like he can’t figure out where Dean is going with this.
Once the speeches were over (and nearly everybody spoke), they took to dancing. The music wasn’t quite the classic rock Dean would’ve chosen, but it was nice, and it fitted the atmosphere. Once, he would’ve wanted to get up and swing Claire around, embarrass her as thoroughly as he could. Once, Dean would’ve done a lot differently than he did.
Somehow, that felt far more special to Dean.
He supposes none of them are coping well with this. Everyone’s gone, the world is empty. It’s just these three. And while Cas loves both Sam and Jack deeply, this is not how it was supposed to be. He’s positive of that. This family cannot ever be complete without its fourth member.
“You’re back, honeybee,” Cas said softly, crossing the room before Dean could even blink and kissing him. The kiss was surprisingly soft and gentle. Dean couldn’t remember his last real kiss, let alone one with real feeling. And, surprised as he was, Dean could feel it. Cas’s real feelings, poured into all of this. The look on his face, the gentle press of his lips, the pressure of a hand on his neck.
There’s a moment of silence before Cas answers. “It doesn’t. Not anymore.” He sounds sad, and Dean almost can’t bear it.
Maybe he’s biased about all this. Maybe he’ll never really understand why Cas made the decisions he made. Dean knows there’ve been mistakes on both sides. He knows he’s hurt Cas before, that Cas has hurt him before too. He knows they’ve got a lot of water under their bridge. He knows they were fighting just before this, that they’ve only just gotten back to where they were before.
He feels like he can’t breathe, like air won’t go in. He feels like everything he just heard is wrong and fake, because the words aren’t sinking in, and the feelings aren’t forming.
He just nodded, and Dean felt a jolt of guilt. Of frustration. Anger, even. How could Cas do that? How could he give up everything for Dean? Again? Surely he’d already topped out his quota for the year.
He can see the blackness coming now. He watches as it envelops Billie, swallows her whole, reduces her to nothing. He can’t help the tearful smile that takes over his face.
“Not in person, no.” Cas said slowly, “I’m familiar with him though. Through others and through you.” He had seen him going back in time for instance.
“Oh! Oh.” Sam’s disgusted grimace shifted into a small smile, and he patted his hands against his knees, thinking. “Kinda rude that I wasn’t there.”
It looked unfamiliar, but Dean instantly liked it, as he did many dogs. Though it barked at him, it wagged its tail and jumped around as though excited, and Dean was worried he’d alarm someone, so he reached his hand through the gate to pet the dog’s head.
Cas cuts him off again, “I didn’t even get to answer you, you-- you-- cotton headed ninny muggins!”
“Who said I can’t give you that?” Dean just answered in one breath, with a puff of his chest.
‘Heya, Cas.’ Castiel stopped dead in his tracks from where he was, walking through a part of the new office of Heaven that Jack had created. ‘I uh, don’t know if you can still hear me from up here or not, but… Bobby told me you helped Cas, so I figure… you must be topside. Or… above topside, I guess.’
When he starts to knock them both to their knees, Cas feels no surprise. He doesn’t even really feel hurt. Or betrayed anymore. He’s long since lost his faith in his Father. His faith is all with his family now. His real family. And his family is winning this fight, even if Chuck doesn’t know it.
“They could use you now.” He tells him, and before Dean can respond, he’s standing in the dirt, in the dark, outside a barn.
There was only one more room down this side of the hall, and when Dean pushed the door quietly open, he saw… what appeared to be a master bedroom. Totally normal. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except, of course, for the big canvas picture of Dean and Cas hanging above the bed. Both wearing tuxes, Dean was tipped back off his feet, dipped by Cas, who held him with an arm around his back and another holding one of his hands. They were kissing, Cas leaning down over Dean, and both looked like they were smiling despite the kiss.
“Why did you respond like that when I said I loved you?” He asked, his weird euphoria at the realisation of his actual freedom making him brave.
Dean gets to meet the rest of the Royal family.
Cas stared between them, and his heart broke. He had to pull away from his husband, stared between them.
Sam helped him in, and they drove in silence the way home.
Dean’s tried, he’s really tried to get over Cas. He’s slept with women, he’s tried to convince himself it isn’t real. He’s tried to tell himself about angels not being able to feel love. Cas has told him as much himself, and he knows it to be true. He’s tried to remind himself about his father, how cruel John would be about this if he knew. But in truth, he gets nowhere.
Dean stared at him for a moment, and he thought about that little kid he’d been watching over since he was four years old. The six month old baby he carried out of a burning house. The six year old he gave his cereal to. The ten year old he’d read stories to. The fourteen year old he protected in school. The eighteen year old who left them behind for college. Sam was his brother, absolutely, but Dean had raised him as though he were a father. He couldn’t explain the significance of having Sam say these things to him, unprompted.
Dean was sitting up in bed, a little cup of pudding on the table in front of him, plastic spoon in hand. Sam was sitting beside him now, Castiel having gone off to get himself and Sam coffee. Dean had been consistently waking and staying up for weeks now, and he was slowly trying to come to terms with it all. Or, at the very least, getting through each day.
So Dean continued, “How’d you get there, Cas? Don’t think I haven’t noticed you sleeping in those chairs. Don’t think I haven’t noticed how fucking tired you look. What’s going on, man? Did you strain your grace getting me out? That it? Keep saving me from perdition?”
Yet, Cas knew he wouldn’t do that. It wasn’t about owing and it never was. He didn’t keep going back to them because he owed them something, he kept going back to them because he cared about them. Because they were his family, the only real family he’d ever had. The only people who’d ever treated him like there wasn’t something inherently wrong with him. Like his disobedience was something good about him, rather than something shameful.
He can recall being told a thousand times about how much he hurts Cas, even without meaning to. How the very touch of him corrupts. How he’s poison.
“Ugh, it’s only Christmas Eve.” Not-Claire argued back.
Cas suspects Sam isn’t seeing Eileen because of his grief, and while he understands, Cas finds himself getting quickly fed up with it.
When he woke up, Castiel immediately looked around, trying to find someone, anyone, that was familiar. Instead, it was only black, and he remembered what he’d done. What he’d said.
“I know,” Dean said with a chuckle. “Want to… want to sit on the beach for a while?”
She was still talking, but Dean wondered if anyone was really listening anymore.
Dean nodded slowly, “Good instincts.” He said quietly, “I just want to… settle in. There’s a lot of stairs and… the bunker isn’t the most… wheelchair friendly.”
“I… Cas, I hate doin’ this to you, man. I really didn’t wanna come in here. You’ve given up so much for me already. I—I thought your perfect world would be back in Heaven or— or with your family again. I had no idea it would be…” He gestured vaguely around, “But man, we need you. Jack needs you. You’re… you’re family, man. You’re Team Free Will. We need you.” He repeated, desperately. “I need you.”
Now that he sleeps, now that he’s human, Cas has to contend with the nightmares too.
Dean actually let out a little laugh, “You forbid it?”
“Dean, no…” Cas is whispering, looking like he’s about to break in half at any moment, but Dean just shoves him by the shoulder. He watches Cas fall, knowing full well the angel is stronger than him at any given moment, but it doesn’t matter.
It’s another few weeks before Cas decides he can’t just let it drop. If not for Sam’s sake, then for Dean’s too. He figures, sure, Sam will probably hate him at first, but hey, if Cas is Sam’s brother too, then that sort of comes with the package anyway.
“Claire. Kid. Please. I will never, from the bottom of my heart, never… stop giving you shit about Kaia.” Not-Dean teased.
He’s formulating. Dean knows he’s never been the smartest Winchester brother. Hell, he’s never even been one of the smartest members of Team Free Will. But he’s not stupid either, and people forgetting that has helped him more times than he can count. Actually, people assuming Dean is stupid goes well for him, it usually gives him an edge. It’s less frequent these days, after Sam and Dean have become sort of famous amongst hunters and monsters (a sentence Dean never wanted to think, let alone say).
He’s spent his entire life hiding from everything. Hiding from his feelings and from who he was because of his father and because of Chuck and because of every other awful thing in his life. He’s spent so long denying his unmoving, unchanging love for Castiel that he can feel the weight lift off him. He feels like Atlas, finally freed, and his heart feels like it might explode, but it’s done.
“Son of a bitch.” Dean groaned.
How could Dean ever love anyone else? How could there ever be anyone besides his Angel? Aside from this man, who walked into Dean’s life like some angry, vengeful God on a mission, who didn’t care for humans, and decided that Dean was worth saving. Worth protecting. Worth loving.
But Dad’s gone. It isn’t your fight. You’re just a guard.
Really, it hasn’t been that long. A few months since Cas and Sam lost him, since Jack left, but it feels like a long time. For Castiel, who has lived millions of years, it feels strange to think of a few months as a long time. But he’s tired and human and he was never in love before in those years.
Dean felt some weird smugness that he’d worked pies into Cas’s fantasy, but he still couldn’t explain it.
“I might not need--”
“Hey, about before…”
Dean crept further in, making a mental note to unpack all of this later. Sure enough, when he got closer to the bed, he saw both sides crumpled and lived in. On one side, a framed picture of Dean, Cas, Jack and Claire. Beside it, a book about the lifecycle of honey bees.
“‘Course I’d do it to save him.” Dean scoffed, offended.
“Cas.”
“I’m not.” Cas answered simply, and the two sat in silence until the nurse returned.
Cas’ eyes squeeze shut, and he tries hard to block out those thoughts. Billie is gone, and that is good, but not at this cost. Never at the cost of Dean. Of all of them, Dean was always the hero. He knows Sam and Jack would agree. He can’t entirely explain why, he just knows they all feel the same about that. Dean is… he’s the glue, that’s the only way Cas can think to describe it. There’s something about him, always has been.
“Cas?” Dean managed to get the words out through chapped and bloody lips.
All the way home, Dean had been imagining a more… physical reunion, what they would do when they were alone in a room, all feelings out in the open, but honestly, he is more than happy with this. Both Miracle and Cas are out before Dean, so he has a minute just to watch the two. Cas’ eyes shut, his mouth open slightly as he sleeps. He looks sort of innocent, Dean thinks, as if he hasn’t been alive since almost the beginning of time, as if he hasn’t carried so much pain and trauma. He seems happy, asleep in Dean’s arms with Miracle between their legs, and Dean can hear Miracle’s even breathing too. He hadn’t really signed on for a fur child, but the dog clearly makes Cas happy, and honestly, Dean sort of loves it.
It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t gospel or bible. It was them. It was too men, forehead to forehead, letting out quiet, giddy laughs.
Did he live in this home? This weird, walled up property in the middle of nowhere?
“So… you and Cas. Married. Thoughts?” Sam asked, clearly trying to draw something out of Dean.
Cas leaned down to kiss him again and Dean melted willingly into it. “How many times do people have to point out to you that I would do anything for you before you believe it?”
Finally, there was Cas. Dean couldn’t see his face, since he had his back to him, but he’d recognise Cas anywhere. Even without the signature trench coat. Cas looked… human, actually. He, like weird other Dean, wore track pants and a casual t-shirt, and was visibly eating.
That it was overwhelming to be carried like this, to need Sam and Cas just to be able to get into his own home. There were steps all around the place. Unless they could fix it all, Dean would continue to be reliant on them.
It was difficult, and painful, and he was still coming to terms with his new reality. But he could handle that. Freedom was worth that. Home was worth that. Maybe then Cas and Sam could learn to regain their lives outside of worrying about him all the time. Maybe he could learn to be self sufficient again. He could return to Miracle and to his room and to his favourite nightgown and he figured, in a weird way, this was peace.
Maybe he could just sense it, the change in Jack. In how he held himself. In his energy.
The way he had died too. Cas had been able to see it. The rebar. The way he had spent his last moments trying to comfort someone else. It was so very Dean Winchester that it stung. Of course, even his last moments, his last moment of freedom, couldn’t really be about him. How could they be? Aside from the prison Chuck and his father and Michael had put on him, Dean was also in one of his own design. He would never, ever let himself be happy unless Sam was. He would never let himself be mad or upset about his own horrible, pointless, violent death, because he would be focusing on Sam. Trying to save Sam, trying to make Sam happy.
“But Cassie,” Jack’s whisper was more like a stage whisper, an excited child trying to be calm but failing miserably. “I just wanna know how it feels like.”
Things were different, of course. Cas slept too now, usually with his arms wound around the love of his life, as close to him as Dean would ever let him be.
Did you fight with her too?
Castiel frowned, and he stared up at the gardens as they walked. Dean followed his gaze, not so distracted by the luxury of it all now, since he was focused on Cas, but aware enough that it made him uncomfortable to look at for too long. Dean had always been more focused on people than settings, anyway, and he made a point of not analysing the physical place he was staying too much, knowing it would only piss him off to do so.
Despite it being a somewhat routine hunt, they’re both on guard. It’s a risk, somewhat, since Cas is no longer an angel and is quite a bit more breakable, but hey, if he’s human now, the least he can do is hunt. And besides, if he dies, there’s a chance he goes to the Empty. That he might see Dean again.
“He’s fine. Human.” Jack explains. “It was a sacrifice.” He gives Dean a pointed look, and Dean is immediately sure Cas told them what he said. Part of him wants to talk it down, to be embarrassed, but instead, he holds his chin up a little higher and ignores his burning cheeks.
“Bye, Cas.” He watches the blackness come for him, watches as it surrounds him, and before he knows it, he’s gone.
“Dean, why would you—?”
“Well… it’s been twelve years and…” Dean scoffed again at Cas’s words, “I thought I made it fairly clear where I stood.”
The barn only reminds Cas of that. It reminds him of Dean and everything about Dean that makes Cas love him so much. His fight, his fire, his determination.
“Cas, man, it’s not your fault.” Sam says quickly, and his brows are knitting together in the middle. “I just… didn’t realise it was that serious.”
Cas leaned in to kiss Not-Dean, and Dean felt something weird in his chest. A dark, unsettling feeling. Jealousy? Over Cas? With… body snatched him? He told himself he was only jealous of the peace and normalcy, and not of Cas himself. Not of Cas loving some other Dean that wasn’t really him.
When they arrive back at their home, Dean is surprised to see the dog that greets him at the door. He eyes the other two, but they just smile.
“I… I never really understood what love was growin’ up. I mean, not really. You know my Dad was never really there and when he was… we weren’t better off for it. I never really knew how to… how to do anything except to protect Sammy. I spent my whole life trying to protect, since I didn’t know how to love properly. Never could… say the words. Or even really understand the feelings. If I’m bein’ honest, I didn’t believe in any of that good stuff. Romantic love or… angels or Heaven or anything I know you’re s’posed to believe in. The only thing I had worth believing in was me and Sammy.” He can feel tears wetting his face all over again, and he thinks it’s all over now. Now that he’s started digging into this place, this place of self hating, of sheer, raw vulnerability, there’s no going back.
Dean tells himself that he is toxic. That he hurts people. Dean has made too many mistakes. Dean has caused too many apocalypses. Dean’s life has always been about keeping his brother alive, since he was four years old-- and then, as an adult, it’s about saving his family. What is left of it after so long losing over and over again.
Cas nodded slowly, trying to figure out what Dean was trying to get across. He’d been totally unprepared for the revelation that Cas was in love with him. Did he even realise that? The implications of it? He must. Cas felt laid bare, but he tried to keep his defences up. He stood a little straighter, kept his expression a little more passive and restrained.
“Jack…?” He asks, confused, worried. “Why are you here? How did the empty get you? Chuck didn’t get you, did he?” His voice is rising, getting gradually more panicked.
He frowned, “I’m not worth that.”
Dean and Cas have a heart to heart.
Sam looked pained, but nodded. He squeezed Dean’s hand, got to his feet, then walked away.
He tried not to do much as breathe, since, if he knew himself, Not-Dean would notice, try to eject him. He was a chink in the system, something that would wake Cas up. That wouldn’t be received well.
“It’s not my fault you’re an idiot.” Not-Claire was rolling her eyes at Jack, who poured like a child.
Dean felt his heart drop into his stomach, and he felt like someone was pinching his windpipe. The world Cas’s mind created that was too good to leave, the one the djinn had given to him, so heavily featured a happy Dean.
“It can’t hurt.”
Cas having completed his mission for Naomi, turning his back on the Winchesters and having everything he’d loved back. Not having lost complete faith in Heaven for Dean, who had never deserved Cas’s faith in him.
Getting in required more help again. The stairs weren’t easy, and when Sam went to lift Dean, Dean could feel actual emotion rising in his chest. It was difficult to place it, maybe it was hating to feel like maybe he was a burden on them. Maybe it was really coming to terms with how different things were going to be.
“I’m nearly forty, Dean.” He answered with a laugh as Dean pulled him into an affectionate headlock that sort of almost doubled as a hug.
Sam raises his brows at him, and Cas shrugs, “Still getting used to being human. Miracle takes up a lot of space.”
“Whatever you want.” Sam is saying, his eyes big, his jaw clenched. He looks like he’s loathing every second of this, Cas is too. But what else can he do? “We’ll do whatever you want. Just… please. Make it right. Bring them back.”
He thought back to the kid he was at twenty-six, the one who had stood outside Sam’s room for hours out of fear of rejection, the one who had had no one else in the world, but who hid all that insecurity behind bravado and cocky smiles. He thought about the man he had been at thirty, trying to stop an apocalypse and carrying the weight of the entire world on his shoulders. The man he was at thirty-five, still blaming himself for every bad thing, every lost life, every apocalypse. He thought about himself even only a few months before. The man willing to pull a gun on his own brother for a chance at freedom. The man who felt it was always his duty to protect someone else. To do the right thing. He was in his forties now, and had died more times than anyone -- besides maybe Sam -- could count. Castiel had once told Dean that he didn’t think he deserved to be saved. The angels had told him he had poisoned Castiel, corrupted him.
