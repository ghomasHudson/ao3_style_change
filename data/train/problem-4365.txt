“He’s going to be just fine, you’ve got a real fighter on your hands, haven’t you?” she says fondly, “We’ll just get him comfortable in his room and then you can go in and wait for him to wake up. It will be good for him if you're there when he comes round.”
“I’ve got you.” Dean whispers against Cas’s hair, “Let’s see what they have to say.”
“Yes, Dean. It is your fault. You’re just too blind to see.”
Claire finally acquiesces and follows the woman. Taking deep gasps of breath to try and stop sobbing.
“I didn’t catch all that,” Dean types. “Do you like it or not?”
He finishes pounding the signs in place and trudges back over to the truck to put on his safety gear. Noticing that the nearly naked man was now standing much closer, reading the signs he’d placed. Dean nearly falls on his face trying to step into his harness when he hears the guy laugh, luckily the guy is still looking at the sign and hadn’t noticed Dean’s clumsiness. Trying to save face, Dean gives the man a wink before turning to climb up the pole. When he reaches the top, he looks down and sees the man sitting on his front steps. After he finishes his work and climbs down, he realizes the guy is no longer watching.
“Yeah, but I got it moved out two months. Besides, it's around the same time you leave for school.” Dean tries to get Castiel to sit with him, but Cas is too busy pacing. “We still have the summer.” Dean stands and stops Cas’s tyrate by placing his hands on his shoulders. “Cas, babe. We can still do all the fun shit we talked about, none of that has changed.”
“At the... Um… at the Orchid Beach Resort in … in Khao Lak.” She remembers her Dad drilling that into her head while they were at the beach, she could tell her their room number if that was necessary.
“Yeah, I should be fine. And Dean was okay today. I think he’s over the shock of me being here. We had a talk and it turns out that he was the EMT that helped get me out of my car - can you believe that? He and his partner took me to the hospital. After that talk, he really seemed better. He told me not to be up on my leg so much, today I was up several times and it was very painful. Moving around isn’t the problem so much as getting up and down, it’s  exhausting, trying to keep my balance on the cast.”
Castiel hums and nods, “Being here as a family?”
Dean smiles and folds the paper, slipping it into his pocket. ‘
Castiel smiles and shoves the note in his pocket. Hot damn! The lineman -
“Let’s take a look,” offers the man, placing his hands gently on either side of Dean’s head and tilting it down to look at the cut. “We should clean this up, well as best as we can, and try to find something to bandage the wound.”
Dean looks at him with tears of anguish in his eyes, “No. I haven’t been able to use a phone.”
When Dean finally puts his daughter down, he turns to Jack.
,’ Castiel thinks to himself, ‘
Together, he and Cas run one of the top custom motorcycle shops in the state… the region… okay, in the nation, and the Euro circuit has been giving them some notice of late.
“What time do you finish work?”
“I’m okay. I just need to catch my breath,” Dean grits out, hissing through his teeth to fight back the pain, “Will you tell ’em I’m back?”
“Holy crap, Cassie. He really said that?”
But Castiel uses his grace to piece the soul back together. Healing the body and mind of the tortured soul, guarding the man as he lay him to rest and recover.
“Well, let me give you mine just in case you have an emergency or something.”
Looking back up to meet Dean’s eyes, Castiel shifts forward on his knees, he hoists Dean’s legs up and nips at Dean’s inner thigh teasingly before lining himself up at Dean’s entrance. Their eyes lock as Cas starts to push himself into Dean’s inviting heat and they let out low groans in unison.
“Of course, you can invite
Cas barks out a laugh, “Aha - see! Even Jay Leno thinks you flirt too much, dumbass.”
“I’m thirsty,” said Claire, louder than necessary. Her voice reached into the darkness and pulled Castiel out of its peacefulness reluctantly...
“Hey, Doc. Almost late again.” Dean chastises.
The woman looks into her eyes sadly and pats her hands, “That’s okay. You just stay right here and try and get some rest. I’ll come back and check on you later.”
“We wouldn’t be anywhere else,” says Dean, adding with a cheeky wink, “We kinda like you, you know? Just a little bit.”
Claire holds Jack’s hand and they sit just outside Castiel’s room while Dean goes in first. She hugs him tightly against her while they wait...
They have been in the therapy dog training for two months, and the training they did before has been exceedingly helpful. Dean is amazed at how intelligent the pups are; how quickly they learn all the commands and how intuitive Casey is to Dean’s feelings. The pups were in free time during one of the classes and were allowed to run free in the room; several decided it was time to pounce on each other, nipping and yipping as puppies do. But Casey walked right over to Dean and laid with her head on his foot. Dean hadn’t realized he was bouncing his knee and rocking in his chair until he had to stop to reach down to pet her.
Dean looks through the small window in the door as they take Castiel further into the room. He stands there, mouth slack, body numb and he doesn’t move again until they are out of sight.
Dean hands Cas the bucket and tells him to hide just out of sight and wait for the cleaning crew who should be arriving within minutes. Before Dean leaves to hide elsewhere, Cas reaches up and cups Dean’s face in his hands and kisses him tenderly.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I just couldn’t wait any longer.”
Suddenly, she sets off sprinting down the stairs and in the direction she’d seen the man heading, she’s chasing after the man, calling out ‘Dad? Dad?’. But skids to a halt when she loses him in the crowd outside in front of the hospital. Her lungs are burning and her mind races…
A moment later Dean’s phone rings and Cas jumps when he hears a loud crash in Dean’s room.
Claire takes a deep, calming breath and tries again to look more closely at the items. The first thing she sees is a silver banded watch. She knows her papa wasn’t wearing a watch, he rarely wears one when he isn’t working. She’s seen him, more often than she can count, checking his phone for the time. Feeling a touch more hopeful, her gaze passes from the watch to the next item, the first of two rings.
Cas watched him from the kitchen door.
The truck lurches over an uneven road as it leaves the shelter, Dean and Jack are still on board. It had been another dead end for Dean. He had not found Castiel or Claire on the shelters list, he tried not to let it show to his son but his mounting dread was dousing what remained of his hope. He lifted a hand to absently scratch at the bandage wrapped around his head. A woman at the shelter had been kind enough to change it for him and check the wound. It was clear that pain medicine was starting to run out at the small shelter and when the volunteer had offered Dean some, he had politely declined. His head hurt but he could look in any direction and see someone worse off than himself, he wouldn’t feel right taking medicine away from someone else who would need it more. Now was certainly not the time to be selfish with pain relief. But he hadn’t seen anyone being selfish, he hadn’t seen anyone using the situation to their advantage, in fact, Dean felt moved by every selfless act of kindness he witnessed going on around him.
Cas smiles even though he knows Dean can’t see him, “Yeah, I am. Thank you, Dean.” Castiel isn’t sure what it is about Dean but just talking to him really helped. The fact that Dean only cared about cheering him up, the fact that he hadn’t asked Cas what was on the video or why the hell he’d let Ishim film him in the first place. There was no judgment from him at all, only concern. Castiel felt emotional for a whole different reason now, but it wasn’t cold humiliation or burning anger… it was a warm - something. A warm something that filled him up and almost brought him back to tears. There was a mix of gratitude and something else that he couldn’t quite put his finger on, all he knew was, Dean made him feel better.
Dean has to swallow down the urge to jump up and throw his arms around Cas, the need to be closer to him is almost physically painful. Instead, he quickly wipes the tears from his face and scrambles to his feet to lean over the bed to gaze into Castiel’s eyes. The usual sky blue shine that greets him there is duller now and surrounded by a ring of irritated red mist.
“I’m so sorry. Please, come with me.” The volunteer says. Her features are soft with pity and sorrow for the girl.
The sexual tension continues to build as they drove to Castiel’s house. They share glances and Dean reaches over and places his hand on Castiel’s thigh. Castiel sighs and lays his hand on top of Dean’s.
He tugs Jack closer to his side and kisses the top of his head whispering words of love and comfort. He wishes he had his phone with him, he wants so badly to call his brother again, to hear his voice and ask him if he had heard from Castiel or Claire. Maybe they had managed to get in touch with him, maybe Sam already knew where they were but was unable to reach Dean.
“You know, Dean. I was so pissed off the other day when I came out to see what all that racket was. I was just about to start yelling at your partner in his noisy bucket. Then I saw you come out from behind the truck and my brain just kinda froze. Um, that sign you put up was hilarious.” Cas looked down, smiling. “I watched for your truck the next couple of days, you know, just in case you still had work to do on my street.”
Dean rolled his eyes, Gabe was a pest. Even if he is already eighteen and a Senior, he acts younger than Sam and Cas. Dean puts up with Gabe for Sam’s sake and because Cas is an alright kid. If he wasn’t Cas’s brother…
He laughs and shows Castiel.
Dean grins wide at his victory and hands Castiel his jacket, “Let’s find you a new car, yeah? Fresh start and all that?”
“What are you talking about?”
Dean untangles from Cas and steps back. “Cas, she’s here to stay. You plan on giving up sex ‘cuz of a dog?”
"Funny! That's what you said the first time I asked you not to keep flirting with the waitress and the next and the next... But you continued to do it the whole evening! And it’s not the first time I’ve asked you not to do that. Why can’t you see how much this bothers me?"
“I’m so sorry baby-girl,” mutters Castiel, sounding remorseful and breathy.
Cas swallowed stiffly, willing his watery eyes not to flood tears down his face, “Do you really, Dean? Do you believe in us? Our relationship?”
While everyone is getting themselves ready for the day, Dean decides it’s a good time to call Sam. The phone rings a few times before he picks up.
“No, we need to stay here where we’re safe. We need to rest so we can go find help.” Claire tells him.
“You… you found my papa?” Tears of relief stream down Claire’s face as they walk up to his bedside.
“Europe, um, yes, I mean no. I mean you’ve got me all twisted. I don’t know what’s happening here. I’m not getting married to a man I hardly know,” says Castiel, feeling tongue-tied from the shock of what was unfolding.
“Just as good as our first time, just as exciting, fuck I love you so much,” says Dean emotionally as he pulls Cas into his arms and kisses his head.
Dean leans on the truck as Bill hoists up the bucket. The refitting and rewiring of this section of the grid is going to take nearly a month to complete. They are a week in and he is already climbing more poles than he figured he would ever need to, but so many of the older fittings needed special attention, and the bucket just can’t get a man in the right position or some poles are in a place that the truck couldn’t go.
Cas doesn’t mean to but he squeaked and pushed himself into the wall, all his fears welling up into unshed tears, he kept his hands over his eyes.
They casually make out, hands unhurriedly petting each other. No rush or extreme sense of need, just enjoying each other’s body.
Dean walks into the bedroom to find Cas already in bed.
He lays the phone next to his leg on the bench seat. Folding his arms across the top of the steering wheel, he presses his face on his forearm. His phone buzzes again. He doesn’t look. He knows it’s from Cas. He’s not ready to see what Castiel has to say.
During dinner, Sam talked about his day, not much happened but he had a funny story about an old man who kept losing his glasses and each time they were on top of his head, well, it was funny the way Sam told it.
It takes another ten years for Castiel to hear the words that he has already spoken to Dean more than once - or twice.
“Is there someone we can call for you?” The woman asks as she writes Claire’s information in a notebook.
The shorter man, Dr. Chuck Shurley, walks over to Dean’s hospital bed and checks the monitors and does a few reflex tests. “Well, it’s not bad news, Castiel. Dean has been responding more favorably to treatment, but the only thing we can do is wait.”
“Ladies and gentlemen” The DJ announces, “Next up we have a house favorite! You know him, You love him! Let’s hear it for Caaaain!”
Dean sticks his tongue out at Cas, “You love it.”
Dean is staring at his dinner when Benny speaks up.
Another voice in his head, that reminds him painfully of Dean says, ‘There was nothing you could have done.’
Cas silently listened to the conversation and tried to pretend he wasn’t. He felt like a fly on the wall, like he shouldn’t be hearing this discussion, but then Dean had brought it up knowing he was there, it wasn’t as though Cas had walked in on them talking.
When Castiel’s overprotectiveness carries over into the bedroom, once again Dean balks and sulks like a teenage girl.
Deciding that she doesn’t want to just sit there and think about things anymore, Claire gets up to take a walk around the hospital. Hoping beyond hope that maybe she might find her papa. She wanders around for a while, noticing how busy the place is and just how many people there are, workers and patients and families, all tired and looking desperate. When she goes upstairs, she comes across the little boy and his mother from the resort, from the billboard. She watches as they play and talk happily together. She feels both happy for them and jealous that they have found each other.
Cas helps the man to his feet and leads him into the kitchen. He helps him with his jacket and shirt sleeve. The bullet had barely grazed his arm, leaving only a scrape about two inches long on his bicep. Cas pulls out a first aid kit and begins to wipe away the blood. The man hisses at him and complains.
Dean pauses when he sees a little calico cat sitting on a bench next to the path. This isn’t the first time he’s seen the cute little cat; the past couple of weeks the little fellow has been in the courtyard just hanging around. Dean slowly sits on the bench and reaches out timidly to make sure the cat doesn’t want to bite. You never know with cats. He scratches between its fuzzy little ears, then down it's back. ‘
“That’s nice…” says Castiel awkwardly, “I’ll, um, I’ll be in touch, Mick. But I’m late for a very important appointment right now. Bye.” He leaves Mick standing beside his car and looking as confused as he feels and jumps into his own car, tearing out of the driveway in a rush. He can’t decide what he is more relieved about, being on his way to meet Dean, or putting some much-needed distance between himself and Mick Davies.
“Good grief, Mick showed up out of the blue just as I was leaving, and I didn’t want to make you wait so I ended up getting engaged to him, alright? Am I on time?”
Once they are all seated safely and just before the plane is set to take off, Dean uses a phone the insurance man loans him to call his brother, “Hey Sam, we’re all fine and… we’re coming home.”
Castiel smiles, “Agreed,” he says, as he pulls his shirt from his arms and discards it on their dressing table before moving over to Dean, his lustful gaze never leaving his husband’s face, “I have a lot of plans for you, and me, and this bed.” He smiles as he slides his hands up Dean’s torso, making Dean shudder under his teasing fingertips, “In fact… I can’t think of a better time to get acquainted with it, than right now…”
Dean nods, “More,” he gasps.
“Dean, of course, I accept your apology. I forgive you.” Cas wraps his arms around Dean and hugs him tight. “Now, stop crying before you make me cry, too.”
“Oh, I was just going to say that I think it’s good that we’re here together. We have a lot to talk about. So much has happened between us lately it’s hard to know where to start. What… what were you going to say?”
Dean carefully opens the closet door, he peers out into the room beyond to check the coast is clear before sneaking out and quietly making his way to the front of the gallery where they had been asked to leave their bag when they arrived. He locates and grabs it quickly, bringing it with him back to the closet.
Dean watched Cas from across the room. Cas was smiling from ear to ear. Seeing Cas so happy made Dean feel happy, too.
Cas laughs at Dean’s text and tries to think of a good response. Nothing he could come up with would be an appropriate response to a
After ensuring all the doors to their suite are locked and turning down the lights, Castiel and Dean head to the master bedroom. Castiel eyes Dean hungrily as he begins to unbutton his cotton shirt, “This place is amazing, Dean.”
Dean (Friday 2:26 PM)> Damn got another call TTYL
“Papa…” she cries brokenly, “Where are you?”
“Have you? Will you?”
Claire stands on her tiptoes to lean over the bed and give her papa a kiss on his cheek.
Gabe walked back in from a bathroom break, and Cas immediately stiffened and Dean removed his arm — reaching for a game controller. Gabe saw it all but just wiggled his eyebrows at his brother and grabbed another controller and sat on the other side of Cas.
“What?” Claire looks down at her arm where her name is written in bold black letters. “Yes, it is.”
The day progresses with some craziness when Mr. Leno and his entourage, including a camera crew, come to pick up his new chopper. Of course, there’s an interview with Dean and Cas about how they pulled off their special magic to create such a superb machine. Dean is a natural and plays it up to the camera, all flirty and way too cute. Cas rolls his eyes when the woman doing the interview giggles and stands a little too close to Dean.
Cas frees his hand and chuckles at Dean.
He looks around them and pulls a heavy tree branch from the water, testing its sturdiness with a few strong swings. He nods to Claire, trying to appear more confident that he felt, “Ready?”
“Jesus, Dean, you said he picked you up?” Benny laughs, “You are so out of your league!”
Dean talks to the man at the desk and sets an appointment to come in and speak with the Recruiter on a day when he has more time. He’s coming back on Wednesday; his shift doesn’t start until one in the afternoon.
They sit at the table and begin eating; the silence between them is comfortable. They share glances and silly smiles as they eat.
“Of course, we can, darling,” Cas replies, as he helps her set it up. It's not a large telescope but it’s supposed to be powerful enough for an eleven-year-old to enjoy the stars.
“Hide your smelly keychain now, Dean.” The instructor tells him as she takes Casey out of the room for a moment.
“I was getting engaged,” Cas answers as he walks past Dean into the gallery. “Come on.”
“Well, that but also…” Dean looks down at the bed and then back up at Cas, with mischief glistening in his eyes, “our giant king-size bed.”
“You alright there, Cas?” Dean says glancing back at him over his shoulder.
Castiel squats down, laying the tray on the table getting close enough that he can be heard over the music, “I’m so glad you came, Dean.”
Once they’ve picked out the puppy they want, they take her home. Cas pushes Dean to give her a good name.
“Oh, you beg so pretty.” Ishim glares at Cas, “Tell me. Who do you love?”
He is tossed around below the raging waters like a ragdoll. Pummeling into trees and debris from the buildings. The next time he breaks the surface, he seems to be given a little more time. He splashes wildly trying to regain some control over himself. He shouts out for his family, for his husband and his children. He hears no reply over the deafening roar of destruction and sinks below the surface again with dying hopes.
They both laugh and smile at each other.
“Anything you make is fine with me.” Cas answers, “I’m just thrilled and grateful it’s not hospital food.”
“Sounds like I’ll need to stay and make sure you guys are okay. I don’t trust that Gabe.”
’ he thinks.
“If anything happens to you, you have my word… I’ll look out for your boy.”
Castiel watches as Claire turns to look where he is pointing, she meets his eyes and nods and together they swim - or rather try to aim their bodies - toward the tree. With each movement of his leg, Castiel can feel the awful dragging of loose skin. His injury is deep and painful. He can tell by how groggy and weak he feels that he has lost a lot of blood. He ignores it and pushes on toward the tree. He has to get Claire somewhere safer, somewhere they can take a breath and think. He has to try.
The head guard hurriedly turns the alarm system back on and right after the alarm is set one of the guards unwittingly reaches to straighten the empty frame, causing the alarm to sound. Once again, there are guards rushing in and out and angry shouts and Castiel glances up for a brief moment, feeling desperately sorry for them.
“Good girl,” he breathes out, “‘cause I’m not goin’ anywhere.” The corners of his mouth raise slightly as he looks into his daughter’s eyes and he reaches out for her hand. She steps closer and holds his hand as he drifts off to sleep, exhausted from the rough truck ride. Claire sits on the floor beside his bed, not letting go of his hand that hangs over the side of the narrow bed.
The instructor just shakes her head and works with one of the others in the room.
“Well, I’m glad you weren’t punching the wall this time, anyway. I’ll take a look at your lamp if you want.” Sam offers.
“How are we going to get past the alarm?” Cas asks in a hushed voice.
Moments later, Cas feels cool water dripping on his shoulder and hot breath on his ear - and it can’t be Dean, because Dean is busy sucking a hickey on the opposite side of his neck.
Castiel is up on stage with two other guys and two girls doing some sinful moves to the song “Pure Sin” by Dactyl, it’s not a striptease, but damn, he loves to dance with these guys. He knows the vibe is well, pure sin. He’s grinding against one of the girls when he notices a small group finding a table about mid-room. The lineman - um Dean, finally made it.
Claire watches him, feeling a fresh hopeful warmth spread over her, he made it. Jack could make it. She barely notices the small sad smile that spreads over her face as the boy continues to work on his drawing…
Just as Cas is rushing out to meet Dean, there is a knock at the door. He opens the door to find Mick standing there, dressed in a fine tailored suit looking quite suave.
“What are you doing?” Dean asks, the wind suddenly knocked out of his sails.
“That’s a call, Cas. I gotta let you go. Feel free to text me, I may not get it right away but I’ll respond when I can. Bye Cas.”
Not long later, he is walking into his house and being greeted by Gabe, who is pouring himself a nightcap and excitedly begins telling Cas how well his evening went.
Choking back tears, he manages to ask, “I’m ok, Sam, have you heard from Cas?”
Cas had thought that Dean would want his support during the classes, at least for the first few - until Dean got to know the staff at the training center. But, Dean proved him wrong, deciding that he preferred Cas to drop him off and go take care of other business instead of waiting inside for class to be over. The one-hour class soon turns into an hour and a half because Dean spends time visiting after class is over. Cas experiences a tug of guilt each time he drops off Dean. He feels a bit left out not being involved in the classes with him. Dean is always so excited and full of life when Cas picks him up - the classes must be fun. Cas watches Dean enter the building and realizes that he’s jealous.
“Dean, she’s watching us.”
“Gabe!”
“Dude, I..”
“What am I doing wrong this time, Dean?”
“I’m a man of action. I once bought out an entire company on a whim. Best investment in my career.” Mick boasts, as he takes the box back from Castiel and pulls the ring from it. He slips the box into his pocket and takes Castiel’s hand in his sliding the ring on to Castiel’s finger- completely missing the wild look of panic in Cas’ face.
When the doctor comes in he is smiling so Cas is hopeful for some good news.
----------X----------
Dean’s voice cracks, “I… He, Claire… They were just… gone.” He gasps in a deep breath as he begins to break down, rough sobs making it difficult to speak, “Jack’s here, he’s ok, I have him. I have Jack… but they, Claire… Cas. I don’t know, I can’t stay on the call Sammy, people are waiting to use the p-phone. If he calls, I’m ok. I have Jack - you tell him. Tell Cas, I have Jack.”
Dean chuckled, “Nope, not married and not with anyone. I haven’t had a long term relationship in a while. Kinda been focusing on the job.”
Dean has been seeing this counselor since he returned home. The Vet Center gave him a list of options, and he liked her name, Missouri Mosley. Anyone with a name like that has to be good people. And she is. Dean feels very comfortable talking with her. Which says a lot, because he never opened up to the white-coats at the veteran's hospital. He answered all the questions and retold his combat story, but he never shared his feelings.
“Charlie, You have to drive. Else we gotta uber.” Dean practically begs over the phone. “Benny already started drinking and I ain’t planning on -”
Sitting in his car, with the window down, he pulls out his phone. He stares at the brief conversation from last night. He stares until the screen goes black. Dean hasn’t saved Castiel’s number. Cas may not want him to have his number after they meet-up. Dean’s not the same person he was before, not since the incident, not since he saw the gruesome, evil side of humanity. Cas would be right not to want Dean in his life. Besides, Cas already has someone; he doesn’t need Dean.  Dean stares at the conversation until his screen goes black again. Finally, he begins to type a message, which he deletes. Tries another and deletes that one too. What does a person say to his ex four years later? He settles on something simple.
The next moment, everything happened so fast, Castiel’s head was spinning. He didn’t mean to drop the glass.
The memory of their fight and the guilt from it fresh in his mind, Castiel shifts and tries to start climbing down out of the tree but Claire stops him.
“Well, at least it was the lamp and not your hand.”
Castiel smiles around the nipple under his tongue and flicks his eyes up to look at Dean’s face. With one last deep suck, he lets loose Dean’s nipple with a wet popping sound. He pulls his hand free of Dean’s underwear and puts his weight on both hands, one on either side of Dean. Then proceeds to taste his way down over Dean’s stomach before sitting up, shifting back and resting on his ankles. He gradually draws Dean’s underwear down from his waist, allowing his husband's aching dick to spring free, it bounces up softly against Dean’s stomach as Castiel pulls the boxers the rest of the way down Dean’s legs. Castiel tosses the underwear over the edge of the bed and brings a hand up to his mouth, he dribbles some saliva into his palm and then wraps his hand around Dean’s cock, stroking firmly up the length of it.
Cas (Wednesday 7:59 PM) > No Ishim. Please respect my wish and let me have this time.
The third week of July, Dean receives notice that he has to be at Fort Benning, Georgia by July 28th. That’s a whole week earlier than his original date. Castiel’s flight is on August 6th. This information is not pleasing to anyone.
Dean’s circle of friends may be small, but he feels lucky to have them. Kevin is hearing but has a deaf mother, so he has been signing all his life. Charlie lost most of her hearing due to an illness in her teens, so she learned to sign. Benny and Andrea are both hearing but have become part of the little group over the past year since Benny lived with Dean. Dean knows about and has taken part in the Deaf Community here on campus but has never liked being separated from ‘normal’ society, even as a kid.
The volunteer smiles warmly at her, “Please, come with me?”
Dean is standing alone at the gallery entrance, looking slightly nervous when Cas arrives.
It wasn’t like that with Sam and Dean, they offered him so much and expected nothing… They didn’t help him for what they could get out of him, they helped because they wanted to. Because they are good people. His friends.
“Oh, ha ha.” Dean makes a face at the woman.
“Yes. Christ, of course, I do, I hate that you even have to ask that” Dean answers quickly then takes both of Cas’s hands in both of his and looks directly into his eyes. “Cas, I’ve never lo- cared about anyone the way I care about you. I’ve been lost without you these past few weeks. I believe in you, sweetheart and I believe in us. I want to prove to you that I take our relationship seriously...”
“Dean?” says Sam, sounding hugely relieved that he had called back.
“Oh, and Dean, maybe you shouldn’t flirt so hard in front of your husband.” Jay winks and claps him on the bicep before walking away laughing.
Dean sits up on the couch when Castiel knocks twice and enters his house - such is their routine. They have been friends since Junior High School and dating since tenth grade. They’re familiar with each other’s home and families.
Dean wakes with a start, flailing and yelling.
“Not terrible.” Dean grins. He holds up a finger and pulls out his phone, opening the notes app. “I appreciate you trying. Not many people do,” he types. Just then an alarm goes off and his phone buzzes and flashes. “Sorry, I have an appointment,” he types.
Slightly stunned by Dean’s thoughtfulness Cas hands his phone over and watches as Dean adds his number in and texts himself from Cas’s phone, “So I know it’s you calling.” Dean gives a small smile.
She feels it hit her like a punch to the gut, like the wave, hitting her all over again, she feels herself floating. She has no control, her dad, her baby brother, and now… her papa is lost.
Cas releases Dean’s cock with an obscene sound and stands, his lips dark pink and glistening. He finds Dean’s hands that have fallen to his sides and roughly presses them into the wall above Dean’s head, passionately attacking Dean’s neck once more with his mouth. Swiping his tongue over Dean’s flushed and warming flesh and raking his teeth gently over his throat in a way that he knows has driven Dean wild in the past. He presses himself forward, rolling his crotch against Dean’s, groaning at the feeling of friction between them.
Dean had told Sam that he’d blocked Michael’s number, so why hadn’t he? He didn’t want to see him again. Didn’t ever want to talk to him. So why can’t he just block the stupid number already? He takes out his phone and goes to his contacts, pulling up Michael’s contact information he hovers his thumb over the option to block. Taking a deep breath he presses the button and agrees to block the number.
“Jack, well done! You found Claire.” He sobs as he musses his son’s hair fondly, “Thank you.”
“Yes, a glorious ten a.m. lecture. So much fun.” Dean grins and rolls his eyes.  Mick laughs at Dean’s attitude. They part ways, and Dean heads to his small two-bedroom off-campus apartment which he shares with Benny. Benny is a good guy and a decent housemate. He even learned a few words and phrases in sign language. But mostly they communicate with notes. The system has worked well for them.
“Why, sell it. Unless you want to keep it.” Gabe answers as if it was already obvious.
“You’re the guy for me and we’re going to get married. You’ll get to know me. Oh, the kiss...” Mick takes Castiel into a tight embrace and kisses him passionately. Cas is confused by the whole exchange, staring dumbfoundedly at Mick as the man presses their lips together with over the top excitement, it feels all wrong. Mick’s lips are not as soft as Cas would like, in fact, they feel slightly rough against his own. Then the cologne that Mick is wearing hits him it is so overpowering that it takes Castiel’s breath away and makes his eyes sting. As Mick begins to pull away, Castiel looks at his watch and notices he is running late to meet Dean.
The first ring is a gold sovereign style ring, with what appears to be a man riding a horse engraved on it. Her hope clings on inside her, her papa would never have worn something like this. She shakes her head, crossing her fingers in her palms as she looks at the final item. A silver wedding band. Her heart clenches; her papa wears a ring like this.
There are times when Dean feels that he let his father down by taking a different route with his life, then he climbs one of the big towers and remembers why he became a lineman. Working in a garage under a car has nothing on being outside all day and climbing up a pole or a large tower to work. Even if it was more dangerous, Dean loved his job. The excitement and scenery makes every day an adventure.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean signs, nodding sadly.
Several spins in and it landed on Cas.
After dinner, they drive back to the car lot and pick up Cas’s new Highlander. Cas rides back with Sam, wishing he could drive. Cas looks over at Sam, he was glad that dinner had gone well. He is also relieved that he and Sam are alright around each other. Hating the thought that Ishim could have ripped them apart and ruined their friendship with his horrible actions. Sam is such a good man, Cas is happy to have him back in his life.
“Dean, that’s all great. And I’m grateful for everything you do for me. But, you need to take a little time for yourself. Enjoy life a little. You’re only seventeen, not seventy. At least come have fun at Cas’s party, okay?”
.’ He rubs Casey’s head, “Casey, go drip all over him, cool off that temper of his.” He scratches her head and climbs out of the pool to go sit by Dean.
Dean> You are not going to believe what just happened.
Once they finish their meals they head back to the house. They are both smiling and having a good time together. Every time they looked at each other, they smiled, but when they turned away their smiles faded a little. Castiel would miss staying with his friends, he had enjoyed spending time with Sam and had grown very fond of Dean.
When his bladder won’t allow him to wait any longer, he finally gets up and makes his way awkwardly and slowly to the bathroom. He hates how difficult it is to get around or do anything one-handed. He desperately wants to take a shower but that’s out of the question right now, without help anyway. So he gets a cloth and washes himself the best he can, rinsing it out again twice in the sink afterward to attempt to clean it. He dries and puts on clean boxers and the same shorts - well they’re not dirty, he reasons to himself silently - but then he realizes that he forgot to bring a clean t-shirt. He lays the dirty shirt over his arm cast and hobbles back to the living room to get a new shirt out of the package. Just as he passes Dean’s door, it opens and Dean steps out, almost running into Cas. His hand catching Castiel’s arm to stop them from crashing into each other.
Kevin gets Dean’s attention away from Charlie by poking his arm. “Talk about hot, look at that guy at the bar.” Kevin shows him the target.
Bobby is about as touchy-feely with feelings as Dean is, so it surprises Dean when Bobby asks about Castiel.
“Sure, buddy. You can stay up with me as long as you can keep your eyes open.” Dean knows that Jack needs to rest but what good would it do to try to force him to fall asleep, it would only add to Jack's distress. He knows Jack will fall asleep when he’s ready and not before.
Castiel is on him in mere seconds, climbing up onto the bed and settling with one leg on either side of Dean’s waist, he begins kissing and licking at Dean’s neck and teasing his cock through the thin material of his boxers by running his hand over it lightly.
“It’s not
“Deeeeaan!” She wraps her arms around his neck and hangs all her slight body weight on him. He hugs her back, smiling.
“Okay.” Cas hums and snuggles against his boyfriend. Which lasts for a maximum of five minutes before Ishim is pushing him off.
The rest of his body, though not as battered as his chest and leg, still aches. He has no control over his limbs, no strength at all, which he knows is likely down to the sheer amount of blood that he has lost. His head throbs and his throat feels dry…
“We were together and he, Cas shouted at me to get Jack… The water was coming and I just… I dove toward him, and shielded him, but when we broke the surface… Sammy… They were just… gone.”
“Ok,” she mutters, “thank you.”
“I’m Dean, what’s your name?” Dean types.
The people around him are speaking in a language he doesn’t understand and his brain is too foggy to process it; he’s confused and afraid and the pain is agonizing. Everything hurts, he feels raw, like his skin has been peeled away and every single nerve in his body is exposed.
“Hey, Jack, your papa is going to be okay. He’s just very tired right now.” Dean kneels down and hugs Jack, “Why don’t you go and say hello?”
!” says Dean, he can feel the anger burning through him at the idea that Cas was giving up, “You don’t get to give up on us, Cas. We haven’t given up on you, we never will! You just have to keep fighting, a little longer, okay?”
More time passes. Dean must have fallen asleep because the next thing he knows, the doors are opening and Castiel’s bed is being wheeled back out of the room. With round, frightened eyes, he looks up at the nurse for answers…
“Ishim, please.” Cas doesn’t even care if it sounds like he’s begging.
He thinks about how much he wants to just get up, and walk into that room. Just to make sure that Cas is really still there. He thinks about how he is putting his trust in strangers, putting Castiel’s life in the hands of strangers, not being able to do anything to help… Dean cries silent tears, trying not to wake his resting children.
“Tina… see she ignores them all.” Dean frowns down at the little girl, thinking of all the names he ever heard or read or anything possible. “Cas, I know you think maybe something Russian.” The pup looks up at him. “You can’t have Cas’s name, silly girl.” She tilts her head to the side in a questioning look. “Hmm… K,” the pup tilts her head more, “… KC?” The pup perks up. Dean smiles. “I think her name is Casey.” Dean stands up and calls the pup to join him, “Come on Casey!” The little pup stumbles over her own feet as she pounces along behind him.
“What shall we name her?” Cas asks.
“Dean, can I go over to Cas’s?” Sam asks.
“Wait, see what?”
Cas gets into the passenger seat as Dean slides into the driver’s side. “If it’s alright, I think I’d actually like to go back to the Toyota dealer and look at the Highlander. I liked that one the best.”
“What’s got you in such a good mood?” Cas asks, truly relieved that Sam is home and he survived the day without having to deal with any texts or calls from Ishim.
Gabe flinched slightly at the use of his full name.
Once the commotion calms down and the gallery is quiet again, Cas looks up at Dean and smiles a small smile, leaning against him a little more than necessary. Dean looks down at how Cas his clinging onto him and grins.
Cas’s curiosity gets the better of him though and he stealthily follows Dean out of the closet and watches from behind a pillar what Dean does with the boomerang, excitement courses through him when the alarm goes off again and Dean skillfully catches the toy.
“If you were security and you had to sit here night after night and guard a bunch of items that you could never afford, how would you feel?” Dean asks.
“To the Ritz Hotel.”
Visions of blue eyes play across Dean’s mind, taking him back to when he had first looked over the edge of the ‘Cherub and Psyche’ painting, the first thing he had seen, well the first thing after the comical shock of black and yellow bumblebee pajama pants, were those big round blue eyes shining in the harsh glare of the bright overhead light. He’d never seen eyes that particular shade of blue before, he truly doubts that anyone else alive has eyes as beautiful as Castiel Novak’s.
“Then don’t.”
“Gabe,” he whispered, “I’ll keep my eyes closed if you keep the door open, please.”
“We need to go back and look for Dean and Jack, they must be worried sick about us,” Castiel mutters as Claire holds his arm to keep him from climbing down, it feels like a gorilla has hold of him, how is his daughter this strong?
“Screw the beer, Cake and ice cream win in my book.” Dean took Cas by the chin with the crook of his finger and made the younger boy look up at him. “It’s your day, you’re the man of the hour, Cas.” Dean took the ice cream to the table and placed it by the cake. Daring Gabe to say a word. He also grabbed a bunch of sodas and put them on ice in the sink for those kids who didnt’ want beer.
“You finish your homework, Jerk.”
“Firstly, congratulations on admitting that there is ‘a person’, even if you’re still sticking to pretending that you want to just be their ‘friend’. Secondly, if they have just been through a breakup and you’re not making that up to get me off your case - then fair enough. I can understand why you’re putting off making your move. You need to be the best friend you can be for them.” Benny gives Dean a smile.
“Oh please, I got them big enough that they will fit over your clothes. That way we don’t leave anything behind.”
“You - you don’t have to leave, unless you…”
“Yes! They’ll be over shortly. We have a paper that we’re collaborating on, and he has all the notes.”
“Thank you, doctor, I’m so glad to have those casts off. It’s been a hell of a few weeks trying to get around. I was lucky enough to have a couple of friends who have been there to help me.”
“B-b-but I’m not a company to be bought.” stutters Castiel.
as Dean had learned, had smiled at Dean’s obvious flirting, laughed at his terrible jokes and occasional good one, and accepted Dean’s offer to buy him a drink.
“Well I’d offer to call a doctor but I don’t think he’d fit in the closet,” Dean smirks at Cas.
“Please, Ishim, don’t -” He cried as the man shoved him back against the counter. Causing Castiel to wince in pain.
She smiles.
They go back to the Toyota dealer and Cas ends up buying the Highlander that he liked. He has to wait until Sam comes home from Jess’s later this evening to pick it up because he’s still not allowed to drive. When the purchase is complete, they drive back to the house so that Cas can rest, even though he tries to convince Dean that he’s not that tired.
“Well.” Says Dean.
Thank you so much for staying with us.
“Be back.” He tells his friends.
“Geez, stop apologizing already. You haven’t done anything wrong,” says Dean in bemusement.
Big hugs to all my readers!
Dean smiles, letting Castiel’s words soothe the jealousy that had begun to brew inside him, he decides that for now, he can forget about this ‘Mick’ person - they could deal with that later - together, providing, of course, that they didn’t get caught trying to steal ‘The Angel’s Heart’, “So, I may kiss the groom?” asks Dean, his tone both joking and flirty, Cas blushes and nods, his cheeks burning red as he fights the smile threatening to take over his face. Dean leaned in again, resting his body flush against Castiels, one hand wraps around Cas’ waist and the other holds the back of his neck, tilting his head slightly to the side. Dean’s soft, plump lips find Castiel’s and they both sigh into the kiss.
Dean sighs, “I fell into some goddamn hole and had to climb out. Smacked my head on something.”
“Now, jerk off for me, I wanna see you make yourself come. I wanna hear you make yourself feel good just for me.”
Castiel doesn’t remember hitting Ishim, his mind to dazed and fear soaked to hold on to the moment that he finally snapped and defended himself. It must have caught Ishim off guard too, for the next thing Castiel knows, he is running outside in the rain to his car. Ishim is standing at the door, his lip bleeding, yelling at Castiel to get back inside.
Dean smiles coldly at her, “Oh just so you know, I plan on paying for this dinner and if you keep winking at him like I’m not sitting right here, it’ll cost you your whole tip. You’re already cutting it pretty thin.”
At the base of the tree, Cas finds some vine and leans against the tree to balance himself as he prepares to wrap his leg. He knows he has to stop the bleeding and close up the wound, he’s already lost too much blood. He grits his teeth and fights against the pain as he ties the vine tightly around his leg just above his knee. He takes some long, wide strips of grass and devises a makeshift bandage to hold his leg closed where the skin has been torn loose.
A volunteer comes by to check on Castiel and finds him sleeping so she speaks to Claire, “Is this your father?”
“Dean, wake up!” Cas shakes him, “Wake up!”
A few minutes later, “I dunno, Cas. Your paint job might be hidden if I add any more to the flair.”
Castiel rolls his eyes, but Dean notices the small smile that flickers across his face before he sags in defeat.
“Papa!”
More to prove to his daughter that he is able to than actually feeling ready, Castiel gets back up. He clenches his jaw and tries again, grunting and crying out in pain as he makes the slow climb up to the large limb that Claire is waiting on. Once he is up on the limb he lays down and nearly passes out.
He stands there for a moment, frozen; he can’t believe what he is seeing.
Cas is pleased that he does get Dean to eat his lunch before Dean begins unbuckling Cas’s belt.
Castiel waits nervously in the dark, instantly missing Dean’s reassuring company. He peers out across the room, eyes searching for hints of the handsome rogue. His hand grips onto the handle of the bucket tightly, he can’t actually believe that they had got the painting off the wall, Dean was a genius, Dean was kind… and handsome and his lips…
Dean reaches the apartment building to find Benny carrying a box out to his truck. Dean looks in the back of the truck and sees more boxes.
Yes, there was a lot of pain and sadness but strangers were helping each other. People were pulling together to get aid to those who need it. Childless mothers were comforting orphaned children. People who had never seen each other before were hugging and consoling each other. Groups of volunteers were working tirelessly to search for survivors and to help organise the hospital lists so people could look for their families. There are trucks filled with crates of water bottles dropping off supplies and offering people lifts to their next destination.
Dean wanders around the room for a bit, touching and moving a couple of things before hiding the keychain under some pillows. He doesn’t want it to be too easy for her. He then calls the instructor back into the room.
Ishim (Saturday 6:09 AM) > I’m worried about you. Please let me know where you are and that you’re okay.
“And mine will never be signed because I’m not attempting to fool anyone. I’m merely studying the classics.” Cas says shooting Gabriel a look of warning.
Claire realizes with a jolt that the man is dead.
They then continue to stroll about the gallery, pretending to be interested in the art pieces hung around the rooms, but in fact, they were observing the guard's movements. Dean checking repeatedly that nothing unusual was happening and that the key was still hanging on a little hook on the wall, near the closet...
Dean flips Bill off as he climbs out of the truck and jogs up to the front door. He used one of the power company's hang tags to write his note and hangs it on the doorknob. No way would Cain miss the bright orange paper.
Dean stares at the note for a full minute, Charlie badgering him to let her see, Dean stands up and slips the note in his pocket.
Ishim (Wednesday 7:32 pm) Oh my God! Cas! I knew something had to have happened. You’d never just stay gone like this. Why didn’t you call me? You should be home so I can take care of you. Tell me where you are and I’ll come get you.
“How did you know? It doesn’t matter. Come, come and see it. It’s so beautiful.”
“Sure.” Dean grins.
She looked on the inside of the ring, she remembers exactly what was engraved on her papas, her dad calls him it all the time, ‘
“You know that’s entirely up to Dean. A coma is the bodies way of allowing the healing process to happen at the rate necessary. Once he does wake, it will still be a long recovery due to the damage to his legs.”
Cas agrees with what Sam proposes but it takes him nearly half an hour to get the text just right.
On her way back to her papa’s bedside, she notices a little boy laughing and playing peek-a-boo with a woman. Her heart skips when she realizes it's the mother and little boy from the resort, from the billboard. They’re alive! They’re here. Tears of joy fill her eyes and she feels so grateful to see that they made it. She waves at the little boy and runs back to tell her papa the good news.
“But if you knew… the thing is worthless…” Castiel frowns up at Dean, “then why?”
“Dear Mr. Novak,” Castiel reads in a shaky voice, “Oh God… It’s with great pleasure that I write to inform you that you have been accepted…” his voice cracks and he begins to mumble the rest of the first paragraph. “Dean. Dean, I - I’ve been accepted.” Tears well up in Cas’s eyes. Castiel twists around in his seat and kisses Dean full on the lips. It’s sloppy, and Castiel is giggling, neither of them can stop smiling long enough for a real kiss. Dean hugs him tighter.
Dean watches as Cas gets out of the car, the retort he’d been trying to correctly word in his head dies on his lips as the door slams shut beside him. What the fuck was that? Did Cas just walk out on him? Was he seriously so offended by Dean being nice to other people that he just left. What the hell was he playing at? How jealous and insecure did that make him that something as simple as Dean smiling at a waitress was enough to shake their otherwise strong foundation? Righteous anger built within him with how forcefully Cas had slammed the door, he knew how much Dean cared about his car, was that some kind of spiteful revenge shit?
,’ he thinks.
He thinks of all these things… as he passes by the dirty grey curtain surrounding Castiel’s bed, completely unaware that his husband, the love of his life, is fighting for his own just beyond it.
“Son of a bitch, Cas, you’re a fucking cheat.” Dean laces their fingers together and leads Cas upstairs to the office. He closes the blinds and locks the door behind them - a notice to the staff not to disturb. Neither of them cares if the employees know what they do behind that closed door, but they’d prefer that no one bursts in on them.
“Well, if things go well yeah - but I was gonna say that I plan on drinking plenty since I have two days off in a row.”
“Um, Cas?” Dean is staring at the headboard when Castiel pokes his head out of the closet. Dean points to a set of handcuffs attached to the bedpost and a belt curled up on the pillow like a snake ready to strike. Cas gasps, embarrassment shading his face a bright red.
Ishim (Wednesday 3:27 pm) > Hello Castiel. You need to know that what has happened is your fault. I met a wonderful young lady named Jess. She is with me now. If you don’t come home unpleasant things will happen to her
They sit together and watch a couple of episodes of MASH, then an episode of Bonanza in companionable silence before Dean gets up and goes to the kitchen.
She runs outside, stopping at the end of the walkway, screaming for her dad and searching the crowd when suddenly she hears someone calling her name. She stops yelling for her dad and listens. There it is again, her name being yelled by a young voice. Claire can’t believe her ears, it sounds like Jack.
“What is it?” Claire asks, not wanting to get her hopes up but sensing some excitement in the woman’s voice.
“You scolding our waitress and the fact that you think you’re paying for this evening when actually I invited you out.”
Casey runs around the pool, excitedly sniffing at everything. She pees here and there, marking the yard as her own.
Dean wakes up to the smell of smoke. He jumps out of bed and runs to the kitchen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean pulls Jack and Clarie closer to him and they all hug each other and quietly cry out the relief of finding each other, as well as the worry for Castiel. Dean presses comforting kisses on to the tops of both of their heads and whispers encouraging words. Words he wished he was more sure of.
“Holy shit, I’m so sorry. Let me see how bad it is.” Cas suddenly is no longer afraid of the man but wants to help him.
The older boy looks worriedly at Jack and back up at his dad, “It’s okay, I’ll take him across the street to those trees. I promise to keep an eye on him.”
He misses his papa and Claire and wants to be with his dad when he finds them. He knows his dad will find them, because he promised and his dad has never broken a promise to him, ever. As he watches his dad walk away, that scared feeling comes back to him, like a hose of ice-cold water filling him up inside. He has that terrible feeling happening in his belly and he realizes that it's not just fear.
They spoke in unison and both chuckled lowly. Just then the waitress came to take their drink order.
Cas laces their fingers together, in hopes of strengthening Dean’s resolve.
“Dean,” Castiel breathes out his name in a desperate whisper, as the pain and fear come crashing back through him...
“My real name is Castiel; Cain is just my stage name.”
“Freakin’ deaf moron,” Brady says as he turns to leave.
“They n-need y-you.” stutters Castiel, his words muffled by the mask that still covers his face.
But his heart shattered into a thousand pieces as his eyes fell on the man holding Castiel's hand. He was looking at Castiel with the same expression that Castiel use to look at Dean. That longing, that joy...
“You don’t understand, Cas.” Dean grumbles, “You got into your dream school. What am I supposed to do? Bag groceries the rest of my life? I’m not college material, and you know that.”
Just as Bill reached the top, Dean remembers that he has to place the company’s sign. Everyone at the office laughed at the signs he made to go with the official sign. He had laughed and boasted, “Hey, I can’t let the bucket riders get all the attention.” Dean is quite proud of the signs that he made.
He felt Claire's hand touching him every so often, he frowned curiously as her palm rested against the end of his nose.
“Alright, have fun. I guess I’ll see you at breakfast then. Try not to buy anything!” Cas says with amusement in his voice before bidding his brother goodnight.
“Tha…” He chokes out, coughing to clear his throat. “Thank you.” He whispers to the women hovering over him. He knows they can’t understand him but he continues to thank them just the same.
After his therapy session with Missouri, Dean meets up with Bobby for lunch. For all his gruffness, Bobby has a special place in Dean’s heart. Dean always knew Bobby wasn’t a real uncle, but his dad’s best friend and boss for many years. Even still, he thinks of him as an uncle to this day.
Castiel sees the bartender motioning for him. “Well, I gotta get back to work.” He leans into Dean’s space and lowers his voice so only Dean can hear, “I finish at eleven tonight, I asked to get off early - just in case you wanted to know.” He slowly stands and picks up the tray, totally making a show of walking back to the bar.
When the water is mostly sludge and mud around their ankles, Claire finally sees how bad Castiel’s leg is. With wide eyes, she takes in the disturbing flap of loose flesh hanging down where it is gouged open, and she freaks.
Once home, Cas lays on the couch and Dean sits in the recliner to watch some TV. In less than twenty minutes, Castiel is sound asleep.
They take the cast off his arm first, then the one on his leg. It felt good to be shedding the constant reminders of the accident, and the night it had happened. Now the casts were going, Castiel felt like he might, at last, be able to start moving forward. Once he is cleaned up, they take him to another room where they x-ray both. He is sent back to the little room to wait for the doctor. Castiel is still a little wobbly on his legs, they give him a second crutch to help steady himself. Using the crutch with his newly healed arm is uncomfortable but as long as he doesn’t put too much weight on it, there is no real pain for which he is grateful.
“Very good, Jack.” Dean congratulates his son, hoping that their kids won’t actually have a need for the information.
Cas is excitedly talking about the SUVs that he likes and the ones that they test drove - well Cas drove it around the lot a little. Then Dean took it off the lot and gave it a good test drive since Cas is still not supposed to drive. He had whittled down the choices until there were only two vehicles left and now they were talking about going back to look at them again.
Ishim (Wednesday 8:05 PM) > Castiel please, I miss you
Once home, he tosses his sweaty workout clothes into the hamper and strips down for a nice hot shower. He lets the water flow over his tired muscles and enjoys the stream pelting his back. After his shower, he slips on a pair of nicely worn boxers and falls into his bed. It’s just past ten in the morning, and he has no other errands today so he can sleep until he wakes up without the bother of setting his alarm. He has all day to rest and recuperate and doesn't have to be at work until eight o’clock in the evening. Days like this are few, and Castiel loves them. He snuggles into bed and falls into a sound sleep.
painting to be shown at the gallery? You know how nervous that makes me.”
Cas tries to pretend to be still asleep, but Dean’s light touches on his side tickle. Cas grabs Dean’s hand and presses their hands together, flat against his ribs. Cas kisses the top of Dean’s head, “Mornin’” he replies. “What’s booked for today?”
“Well, Castiel, it looks like everything has healed quite nicely. You will need to be careful getting around for a while, as you’re going to have to get used to walking normally again. Your muscles in the injured leg will need to be built back up. You should start with some non-stressful exercises. The same goes for your arm. Start small and build back up to what you were used to doing as far as exercising goes,” the doctor goes on to say, “You may have a bit of a limp at first but try not to give into it and you should be getting around good as new very soon.”
“You’re all here…” says Castiel weakly, “My family.”
“I found him,” she says excitedly, as she pushes a curtain back to reveal Claire’s papa to her, “He was taken to surgery and we lost track of him.”
After they have exchanged a few tender, yet sweaty kisses, they move to clean themselves up before falling back on to the bed. Dean smiles at Castiel, feeling blissfully happy and sated.
Dean, Claire, and Jack playing catch in the pool with the ball he got for Christmas. Dean notices Castiel when he arrives at the poolside. He waves and Cas waves back, taking a seat on a lounge chair near the pool and pulling out his book to read. He smiles as he watches his family playing together.
“Dean… Jess could have...”
Until he hears another noise, it sounds like someone bumping into something. He feels the hairs on his neck prickle unpleasantly. There is definitely someone in the house. Castiel’s heart is racing as he strains his neck toward his bedroom door, listening carefully to make sure he’s not imagining things. He doesn’t hear anything, but now he’s too wound up to stay put. Quietly, he climbs down from his bed and tip-toes out of his room, he crosses the landing and slips through an open door into the office where the gun safe is kept. He takes out a pistol and loads it as silently as he can with his shaking fingers.
a place for all things dog
With his son snuggled into his side, Dean wraps his arm around Jack’s shoulders and turns his gaze back to the sea… shuddering involuntarily as the memory of the wave hitting comes crashing back.
Painfully long hours pass. Jack and Claire drift off to sleep against Dean’s side, their quiet breathing a constant and comforting reminder that they are both with him, that they are both safe.
“Wow. The burglary business must be going well.” Cas says trying not to sound too impressed, as he gets into the car.
“DAD!” She yells. She stands up, not wanting to let go of her brother, she tugs him along with her, as she heads toward her Dad.
Castiel lifts a hand, reaching blindly for his daughter as his heart hammers in his chest. Then his stomach drops as he notices Jack at the opposite end of the pool from his dad. Above the noise of the screeching birds, screaming families, and the rising roar of the thunderous wave about to crash down upon them, Castiel hears himself yelling. “DEAN!” he cries out, pointing wildly to where their son is cowering against the shallow sidewall of the pool, “GET JACK!”
He hears Dean’s voice in his head again as he begins to feel dizzy and light, ‘
His dad had managed to shield him from a lot, but not everything. He’d seen through the cracks of fingers covering his eyes, bodies, and blood. So. Much. Blood. It made him feel scared and wobbly like his legs had turned to jelly. So, he didn’t argue, when his dad told him to stay in the truck, because he was scared of what else he might see.
I could not have finished this without the help of three very special people - you know who you are <3 <3 <3
Cas licks across Dean’ hole, over his balls, and up his cock, kissing the tip. He crawls up the bed with his dick heavy between his legs, allowing it to drag up Dean’s leg until he reaches the perfect spot.
On the drive home though, when it’s clear that Cas is still being off with him, Dean made the mistake of voicing his earlier thought. Which led them to where they are now; sitting in Dean’s car which is pulled over to the side of the road, not all that far from the bar. Dean has his eyes closed against the tidal wave of anger coming at him from his boyfriend. The argument between them had gained fuel now and he didn't want to drive and fight. Insensitive shit he may be at times, dangerous driver, never.
Dean remembers their wedding with bittersweet fondness, he remembers how amazing Cas had looked in his suit and he remembers how happy everyone had been for them. He remembers in gut-wrenching detail how they’d promised each other ‘the rest of their lives’ and he hopes that that hadn’t already passed. It would be too soon, he can’t do this without Cas. They still have years, they have plans together. They are supposed to grow old together, watch Claire and Jack grow up into the wonderful adults they are sure to become.
I just want to say a big thank you to CritterDee for letting me work on this adorable fic with her and a big thank you to everyone who read along and commented. I haven't really replied to readers’ comments as it is mainly Dee's fic and I felt it was better to leave those comments for her. But I've read all of them and am very happy people have enjoyed reading this story.
The man on the ground walks across the edge of Castiel’s lawn and hammers two signs in the corner of his front yard. One is a two-sided sign with the power company’s name and logo and a phone number. The other sign is one-sided, and Castiel can’t see what it read from his vantage point.
“Yeah, yeah, I think I will.” Dean trudges back to bed.
Dean will tell him after the appointment on Wednesday.
“Better than I expected, really. But I expect that he’s hiding a lot.” Dean says sadly, shifting to look into the living room where Cas is laying. He feels a strange tightness in his chest as he looks at him and an overwhelming desire to go and wake him up, just to ask if he is ok. He shakes the thought from his mind and sets about finishing up dinner.
Dean doesn’t admit out loud that he thought Castiel looked alright in the shorts, from what he could see of his good leg, when he was ambling about, Castiel was in good shape.
Dean lets go of Charlie’s hands and signs, “Thank you, Kevin.”
“She’s my daughter,” he keeps saying, over and over, “she’s mine.”
,’ he thinks to himself and feeling a little angry, he fidgets with the gun aiming it right at the stranger.
Taking deep, controlled breaths, Dean calms himself. He starts the car. He drives home.
“I had no idea she worked with that charity, good for her,” Cas replies in awe.
Castiel hadn’t imagined that the closet would be this tiny, he can feel the cold wall against his back and then Dean’s warmth pressing in close to his front. Dean bumps into Cas as he digs in his pocket, pulling out a small flashlight, it lights up the tiny room enough that they are not in the pitch dark.  Cas looks up into Dean’s eyes as one of the man’s feet knocks gently against one of his, while he tries to find a comfortable position.
“Mmm, pie?”
She turns away from the two women, who are looking at her with increasing pity and concern, she can’t bear to look at their faces. Her eyes travel quickly over the other beds on the ward, the other injured people and she is trembling as she shouts out.
Slowly, with his eyes never leaving Castiel’s gun, the thief puts the painting down against a chair, but it slides down steadily and ends up flat on the ground facing up, which allows Castiel to see which painting it is, his eyes widen as he realizes it’s his ‘Cherub and Psyche’. Even in the dark, he can tell that this is his own, by the frame.
Castiel frowns up at him, “Come on, where?”
Cas gets to the step off the front porch and stares at it incredulously, “Okay, fine, you can help me with the steps.”
“HEY! HELP!” She calls out, waving wildly at the men to get their attention. Their heads snap up and they wave back, changing direction to head towards the tree.
“The Orchid Beach Resort in, um, Khao Lak.” He answers, smiling at his parents.
Cas smiles gratefully at Dean, “Yes thank you, Sam and I were just talking about that. I think I’ll be fine. I have Sam’s number.”
She slams the folder shut and turns away from the table, bending forward, she gulps in deep breaths, tears welling up in her eyes once more. Is she about to see a photograph of her papa like that? Distantly, she can feel the volunteer woman’s hand on her arm, rubbing up and down her skin comfortingly. She looks up and sees the sympathy in the woman's expression.
“Ready,” she repeats meeting his eyes. Castiel casts one last glance over to where the shark is still ripping large and bloody chunks out of the body. He tries not to think about the person alive, of their name and life or how their body is being devoured. He tries not to think about the family that may search for them… and never find them.
Gulping in huge breaths, she runs her hands through her long blond hair. Her fingers catch against mats and knots; her usually beautiful locks are caked in dirt and she pulls her fingers roughly free from the tangles. She’s shaking, sobbing, desperate for air. Her chest is heavy and her mind is spinning at a thousand miles an hour.
Dean kissed him on the forehead. “Glad to help. I was about to come give you these anyway when I got chosen. I’m pretty sure Gabe rigged the game. Are you okay that it’s me in here with you?” Dean rambled on a bit.
Casey harruffs at him.
“Good grief, Charlie. That’s so not cool.” Kevin chuckles..
“Dad! Look! Turtles!” Jack yells as he points to sea turtles swimming nearby.
“Good night, Cassie. Oh and don’t forget, the movers from the gallery are coming by tomorrow to take a few paintings for the showing.” Gabe looks lovingly up at his favorite painting ‘The Angel’s Heart.’
“Dean,” Cas takes Dean’s left hand in his own and twists the ring on Dean’s finger.
Her eyes light up with excitement at the gift, “A telescope! Thank you, Dad, thank you, Papa. I love it!” She hugs them both and begins to set up the telescope, “Can we watch the stars tonight?”
“Sorry, Dean, I know I’m being annoying. It’s just, I’m so ready to be out of these casts. I’m ready for some freedom and to have a real shower.” he laughs.
“Oh - am I messing up your sleep schedule? I’m sorry -” Dean asks worriedly.
With a pained expression, Dean clutches his side, panting as he tries to get his breath back.
“They took him in for an urgent operation on his chest. He will need another operation on his leg sometime soon,” the volunteer says apologetically, “but he is doing much better now.”
“You, Ishim,” Castiel answers automatically, robotically.
Dean watches Mick attentively as the professor leads the class through example problems and he takes pictures of what is written on the board, he has a friend in class who shares his notes so that Dean can pay attention to what Mick is signing. Dean is excited about this course on differential equations. Mick doesn’t understand half of what the professor is telling the class but he keeps up and signs it all for Dean. The professor gives the class their assignment, and Dean accepts it with a smile. Dean thanks Mick and invites him to go out with him and his friends, but Mick graciously declines.
“Holy fuck…” Dean breathes out, sounding wrecked already, “I missed you…”
“My Grandfather. How... when?”
Dean sits down on the floor with Casey and shows her the item, “That’s a keychain. It’s for my keys. When I need my keys, this is what you’re gonna go get. Okay, little girl.”
“Well, did he?” Gabe reiterates.
“Go upstairs and take a shower, then get ready for me. I’ll be up shortly. Don’t keep me waiting.” Ishim instructs Castiel.
X X X
No. Dean hadn’t thought it through that far. He stares out the front window, looking at the street for answers. His phone pings.
“Need help?” Dean signs and Benny nods.
The would-be thief is holding a large canvas in front of him, and all Castiel can see for a moment is the back of the painting before, somewhat comically, a pair of eyes begin to appear over the top, the most striking pair of green eyes he has ever seen and their staring right back at him.
“We are not dead, Cas… We’re in the hospital. Ok?” Dean sighs, looking worried eyes over Castiel’s bandages, “You got hurt, really badly hurt and they had to operate but you’re going to be alright, you hear? You will be alright. They are going to fix you up, Cas. You’ll be fine, and we’ll go home, all of us. Me, you, the kids… We’re all going to go home and this will just be a horrible memory.”
Castiel gives her a small nod and loosely squeezes her hand to show he understood.
What he and Ishim had wasn’t love, it was barely a relationship, he was seemingly there to be Ishims - for the want of a better word - ‘bitch’. The way they had sex, wasn’t ‘making love’ it was rough and at times painful and he always had to beg for any pleasure for himself, Ishim gave him nothing without a condition…
She stands and walks back over to the pile of pillows and burrows in, knocking them all askew, coming out the other side with the keychain in her mouth. She prances back to Dean and sits next to his left foot and drops the keychain on his foot.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s stupid, Cas.” He reprimands himself, “Dean has always had time away from me, the whole time he lived at the Center, I was never jealous of other people spending time with him - was I?” He sits in the cab of the truck and stares at the white letters on the red sign -
“Next time can we
His anger faded as he stared at Castiel for a few moments, he looked tired and his shoulders were sagging sadly. Dean frowned, was this it? Was Cas about to break up with him? Was that what him getting out of the car meant? How long was Dean supposed to wait here, feeling like his world was on fire. Like a lightning strike it suddenly hit him right in the heart; what losing Castiel might actually feel like.
“I think that’s a great idea. There’s a Cracker Barrel right next door to the hospital, we could go there.” Cas suggests.
His suspicions are confirmed when suddenly there are several violent splashes around the object. A large tail beats through the water and sends it showering down over, what Castiel now knows is a body. His chest is pounding and his insides feel icy as he watches a dorsal fin with a slice missing from it cruise around the corpse and then ‘tug’ at it again.
That evening after dinner, Dean is still ramped up and full of energy, which tends to happen when he’s focused on a big job. He’s talking nonstop and pacing while Cas washes the dishes. Dean has his sketchbook out and is busy making minute alterations to some of the final touches he wants for the bike - Cas is trying to watch the news and Dean keeps interrupting.
“Thanks, I didn’t think of that. I’m excited to get to wear jeans again. Gym shorts are okay but when that’s all you can wear for weeks, it gets old.” Cas settles into the seat as best he can.
Once they are all well-protected from the burning sunshine, Castiel beckons the kids to him and Dean.
Dean was helpless against Cas’s good looks but he hadn’t expected to be immediately smitten with the serious way the man talked about the importance of bees or how strongly he felt about testing cosmetics on animals. Dean thought he was the most interesting person he’d ever met. Dean remembers how that formal way of talking loosened up as the night went on, and as the beer flowed. He’s not sure if it was the drinks or that Cas was becoming more comfortable with him, but he could tell the man's personality was shining through and he very much liked what he saw. Cas wasn’t just drop dead gorgeous, he was smart, and funny and he clearly cared about shit. There was nothing not to like, Dean never stood a chance.
Dean looked down at his plate and moved his pasta around, “Michael called.”
“Hi Sam,” Cas greets him, stifling a laugh at Dean’s comment.
“Thanks, Charlie,” Dean says.
Dean smiles up at him, how can anyone be so beautiful all sleep mussed, with pillow crease marks and hair sticking up in all directions? “The Leno bike is getting picked up, and there’s a new client coming in today.”
“Well, isn’t that what you expected? You’re a genius!” Cas stage whispers and kisses Dean on the cheek.
“Castiel, how’s he doing today?” Bobby asks.
Against his brother’s wishes, Castiel reaches out and soothes the child with his grace.
“Hey, Dean.” Sam greets happily.
“Papa?”
Dean has used other phrases - “I need you.”;  “I’m here for you.”; “You’re special, Cas.” - Or shown Castiel how much he cares in deeds instead of words. The bond between the two men - well man and angel - grew over the years. In Dean’s eyes, they began as near enemies, with Dean fearing and hating all Angels. Time spent together proved that they could be friends, then a more fraternal bond became apparent.
“Whoa there, Cas! That was almost a collision.” Dean jokes as he moves back, his voice is still rough from sleep and his hand feels warm against Cas’s bare arm.
“Ehw, Babe, I don’t need to see all that. Shut that pie-hole.”
Claire turns on the spot looking through the crowds of injured people for her papa. She recognizes the woman from the bed next to where he had been lying, she is still there, but Castiel is nowhere to be seen. An icy dread twists through her and her heart begins to race. The sight of all the blood, the smell of sickness, the sound of people crying and wailing all around her turns her stomach. She feels ill at the thought that her papa could be dead. Feeling dizzy and faint she wants to scream but all that comes out of her are the heavy tears that begin to trickle down her cheeks.
“Yes.”
“These nice people have been washing some of the mud and… um, blood off you. See, I’m much cleaner, too. That nice lady gave me some shorts and a shirt to wear.” Claire tells her papa while pointing at one of the women surrounding him. Castiel looks over at the woman and gives her a small smile as he nods at her in appreciation.
Dean pulls out his phone and texts Benny and Charlie.
“Oh, I’m going to a charity function tonight, so I’ll be out late,” Gabe answers, still focused on the two paintings in front of them as though trying to spot any differences.
Dean is entranced; he can’t move or look away. Charlie and Benny are whooping and whistling beside him.
Claire blinks through a frown and looks down at the items laid out before her. She turns away, unable to stop the fresh bout of tears from gliding quietly down her face when she realizes the depth of what she is being asked. These were someone’s belongings, they belonged to someone who’d recently died. She finds herself suddenly unable to look at the trinkets on the table, fearing that she’d recognize something of her papa’s.
Dean’s eyes fly open when he feels the hand, his fingers are wrapped around twitch, his gaze snaps back up to his husband’s beautiful face and his heart stops when he hears the dry, raspy tone of Castiel’s voice...
He reaches the end of the driveway and eyes the fancy little, red convertible that the thief had stopped in front of, to dig in his pockets for the keys.
Castiel is listening to the radio on his drive home from the Claborn Art Gallery, his favorite place in the whole world, except for, of course,  his own home studio. His studio was his ‘happy place,’ where he could put his music on and paint until the early hours of the morning. When Castiel painted, he seemed to step outside of himself; it was almost as though his hands worked on their own, each stroke of his paintbrush against the textured canvas was deliberate and thought through. Each color was carefully mixed to the perfect shade; each line was pre-planned. Painting was where Castiel felt most free because it was where he had the most control; he chooses each line, color, image… He didn’t have that freedom in other areas of his life.
The comfortable black nothing that had gripped Castiel tightly doesn’t want to let him go easily and he has to fight with everything he has just to open his eyes. He thinks it would be easier to slip back into the nothingness, but then thoughts of his daughter alone and afraid push him to open his eyes.
Dean sits back on the hard roof and closes his eyes. There is no way he can even imagine his life without Cas in it. He presses the heels of his hands to his eyes and fights back the tears. The grief floods through him as he remembers the first time they met.
Castiel’s hands are tingling with nervous excitement as he fumbles with his keys at the front door to his apartment. His eyes slip shut as soft lips press against the back of his neck, mouthing at him greedily and sending little shockwaves of arousal through his body like electricity.
On his way out, he grabs his keys, wallet, and phone. He stares at the black screen of his phone. He remembers Cas’s texts. He remembers Cas standing hand-in-hand with another man. His headache returns.
Dean sniffs, and straightens up, gently placing Castiel’s hand back on the bed and wincing at the shallow whine his husband makes when he releases his hold on him.
Dean's eyes widen in shock when Castiel shoots an awful glare in his direction and then opens the car door on his side. He gets out of the car and slams the door closed behind him without another word. Stepping away, without looking back at Dean.
“Hello, can I help you?” he types and shows the man.
After Sam leaves, he lets Cas know via a text message that he doesn’t notice any cars on the street, that could be Ishim’s, as Cas had shyly asked him to check.
“Yes,” Dean signs as he nods. He feels like his face is going to break if he smiles any more.
“Yeah, I kinda did deserve it.” Dean says softly, “If it wasn’t for me leaving you stranded on the side of the road, you would never have been mugged.”
The feeling of Dean’s cock throbbing in his hand and his feral moan of release, send Cas hurtling over the edge with a choked out cry. He continues to work them both through the aftershocks until he becomes over-sensitive. Glancing down he sees the strings of his thick and creamy come marking Dean’s gorgeous body and feels a wave of possessiveness wash over him. He never wants to be without Dean for so long again. He meets Dean’s eyes, hoping to silently send him the love he now knows he feels for him but doesn’t want to say for the first time after sex. Instead, breathless and sweat damp he collapses down beside Dean on the bed and tries to recover his breath.
“Fine,” says Castiel slapping his hands against his thighs in annoyance, “Then I will  drive you home.” Grumbling Castiel slips on his shoes and grabs a jacket to put on over his t-shirt and pajama pants.
“Claire?” he murmurs after the long stretch of silence, she looks up at him, “are you hurt anywhere that I can’t see?”
“Who else are you expecting?” Ishim answers.
Cas thrusts into the mattress trying to reach his climax. Ishim slaps him across the back of his head.
Gabe turned the music down a little and hollered loud enough to be heard,
Warning: This chapter mentions the death of a child.
“Will you give this to your friend for me?” Castiel asks.
“You don’t have to look at any more pictures if you don’t want to. I know it’s upsetting for you, we will try to work out what’s happened and let you know when we have some information. In the meantime, you should stay close by, try and get some rest if you can. The lists are being updated all the time, so if you have other family members here that are currently missing, you can check there, and hopefully, something will turn up.”
The lead instructor smiled at Dean, “She is very in tune to you already.”
Beep Beep Beep
“Maybe I do wanna be an ass. Then I can see what it’s like to be you!” Cas grabs the doorknob, swinging the door wide open.
“I just want my little bro to have the best birthday party ever, and to get what he really wants on his sixteenth.” Gabe crowed, acting the part of the loving big brother.
“Are you alright, Cas?” Sam asks kindly.
Finally, putting his trust in what he sees he takes off toward them yelling.
Dean lays back on the bed, the constant beep, beep, beep of the smoke alarm sounding in his head.
Ishim (Friday 7:03 PM) > What the hell, Cas?
Beep Beep Beep
X X X
Cas hears the small, sharp intake of breath as Dean gasps, at the sight of him on his knees in front of him. Noticing Dean’s thickening erection Cas flicks his eyes up to Dean’s and sees the palpable lust there. He feels a rush of excitement that he still has this effect on Dean, so he hastily unzips his jeans. He sees Dean curl his hands into fists at his sides, before flattening them against the wall as though grounding himself.
Meanwhile, Dean was staring up into Cas’s deep blue eyes, not moving to get up. Cas put his hand on Dean’s chest as he attempted to get up. Dean moved and bent his knee slightly causing Cas’s crotch to rub his thigh. Dean smirked, “Sorry…” And Cas forgot to breathe for a few seconds.
During his dinner break, Dean thinks about calling Cas. But, when did they start doing that? Typically when Dean was at work they didn’t text or call, unless Cas had an emergency of some sort and that only happened once. Well once before today’s text from Cas. But this morning was a kind of emergency, wasn’t it. He couldn’t just call Cas out of the blue, that would be weird. Texting him to see if he is doing okay might be acceptable.
When, once again, no response comes he crumples in despair to his knees and weeps. He doubles over, bending until his forehead is resting against the cold, damp metal of the rooftop. One hand is opened, clawing against the metal, the other tightens into a fist and bangs down in frustration as he calls out again, more to himself, more to any God that might be listening than to the area around him.
“Me too! Daddy, I wanna give Papa a kiss, too.” Jack exclaims and Dean smiles as he lifts him so he can kiss his papa, too.
Cas had to stop and think about that, he’d been so enthralled with the feeling of Dean’s arm and body so close that he had barely heard what he was saying.
“Where the hell were you?” He asks weakly, his words muffled slightly from underneath his mask.
“But now, you’re leaving for the Army.”
Another aspect of Dean’s life that never fit into other people’s so-called normal is his open sexuality. He never cared about gender and had always dated - or slept with - people who he was attracted to based more on their physical attractiveness to start, then their personality and sense of humor. He isn’t one for labels and never identified as anything more than a ‘sexually active adult’, not gay or bi or any of the other labels people used. He doesn’t claim to fit into anyone else’s box. Dean knows that his family loves him, no matter his choices, and that’s enough for him.
Cas stretches and gets up, wandering to the dresser, then the bathroom.
“Hi Charlie, Benny.” He shakes her hand and waves at Benny. “Thanks for coming. My feature is at ten, so I have a little time- “ He looks toward the bar and motions and nods, grabbing a chair and sitting in it backwards facing Dean, “You don’t mind if I join you for a few, do ya?”
Dean manages to smile when he sees his son, despite everything else, Cas and Claire being missing, he is thrilled that Jack is still here with him, safe and relatively unharmed. He is thankful that he was at least able to do one thing right and save his son. He knows Jack misses his papa and sister every bit as much as he does and he makes an unspoken promise to do everything he can to find them.
Dean (Friday 2:22 PM)> Hey. I enjoy doing laundry. Are you calling me weird?
This is the last hospital in this region and Dean tries not to think about what it might mean if he doesn’t find Castiel and Claire here. He contemplates just taking Jack with him and letting the truck go on ahead, but again his mind wavers at the thought of losing his ride, the further they travel in-land, the safer Jack is, but then on the other side of that, what happens when the next stop is the airport. Dean knows it’s only a matter of time before holidaymakers who have found their families will want to go home, he’d feel the exact same way.
