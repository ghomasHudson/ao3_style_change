going on and—” he couldn’t even finish that sentence. “What happened?”
The pie was all ready and packed up for Eileen and the Winchesters. He was curious about Sam’s older brother and his travels. He hoped to meet him one day and hear stories.
“I missed you, man,” Gabriel said, smacking him lightly on the back as they pulled away. Castiel led them back inside and into the kitchen so Gabriel could destroy those cookies.
“Yeah. You did,” Dean said. “Because when do you ever say anything you don’t mean… right?” Dean grabbed his keys and walked back to the front door.
“Thank you so much, man.”
He doesn't hear much, and he can't seem to open his eyes yet. His entire body feels heavy and his head feels groggy like he slept for a very long time but it wasn't enough. No, Dean didn't feel great at all. His entire body hurt and he couldn't move.
He stopped at the small grocery store for some ingredients they needed for dinner later that night.
Castiel felt so numb. There were no tears, no crying, no yelling, just... nothing. He and Inias were supposed to grow old together, but they barely had two and a half years together.
“Do you even know how to do that?”
Right now, he’s just clocked out and is sitting in a booth with Eileen.
Castiel gave him a grateful smile. “I know. You guys are the best.” They hugged and Castiel watched as Crowley drove away with a small smile on his face. He really loved his friends.
My mom always made this for us <3
“They’re still hot,” Castiel muttered. He picked up one of the burgers and took a huge bite, letting out a pleased hum at the taste. He chewed slowly and thoughtfully, taking in the textures and seasoning. “They were certainly right to make a big deal. These are amazing!” He said to himself.
Dean wasn’t normally one to stop in a small town, to stay for a bit. He enjoyed the city more. Plenty of people to meet and never run into again while there, and so many amazing restaurants, but something about this town had called out to Sam and Eileen. So that’s how he found himself parking in their apartment lot and getting out only to be greeted with his taller-than-should-be-normal little brother clinging to him.
"'M okay, Sammy," he whispered. Dean could only lay there, squeezing his brother's hand often until Sam's crying subsided.
“You’re not even getting paid for it, huh?”
“Definitely,” Dean said. “But, hey. As long as I get to see my girl happy, then I’m good.” Then he shrugged and started digging into his dinner.
Castiel stared at him for a moment before sitting up and facing Dean. “You don’t want me to see Inias anymore?”
“Well, we didn’t really talk much there before either.” Castiel hummed and they stayed silent for a moment. Dean stared at a spot on the carpet and just got lost in his thoughts, but when he looked up, he was met with a photo of Castiel and Inias and he flinched a little. He didn’t know how to bring it up or how to even express what he was feeling, but he had to try because it was getting to be too much already.
“At the park, Jo told me Charlie was hot so I gave her Charlie’s number. They’re probably texting right now. Or already planning on moving in together,” Dean explained, chuckling.
A few moments later, he tried to move his fingers and he did it. He felt excited that everything seemed to work. He remembered getting into an accident and then passing out, so he was just relieved to be alive. He studied Sam's face more and took note of how haggard his little brother looked. Dean was positive he'd look the same, if not worse, if their positions were switched.
“Yeah, well, the dude’s also hot,” Dean grinned. Then his smile dropped when he read his bio. “Oh. Nevermind.” He never messed with married people. Friends are fine but never flirting. “Y’all wanna watch a movie?”
Just then, a huge gust of wind blew the trees and Castiel smiled wider.
Everything was fine. It’s fine.
I’m sorry, Inias. Although, I think he’d probably agree
Today, when packing his things for the cemetery, he decided he was going to clean as many headstones as he could. They looked a little too dirty from the heavy rain a few days ago.
And that concludes my little social media AU! I really hope y'all enjoyed it
“Yeah, of course. I was about to ask you actually.”
“You should meet him sometime.”
He checked his watch and did the math. He should have time to watch the movie and then get home just before dinner time.
“Today was a nice day. The weather was a bit harsh but the breeze was forgiving.” He went into his kitchen and grabbed the pie. He packed it inside a large white box, a green bow right on top, and signed the box with a “Welcome to Town! :)”
“I asked Cas if he still had to visit Inias every day. And he wants me to move in but how can I when there’s pictures of Inias everywhere I look? It just makes me feel like I’m intruding every time I go over. I reminded him that he promised to try and… and he said that if he knew I was gonna be like this, then he wouldn’t have said that,” Dean explained, his voice cracking by the end of his ramble. Sam pulled him in for a hug.
He walked up the long drive in and bee-lined for Inias’s grave. It had been Inias’s wish to be buried next to his grandfather, whom he was very close with growing up and Castiel was just fine with that. Him being here was the only reason Castiel bought a house nearby. He would’ve gone wherever Inias wanted to be laid to rest.
Sam's eyes looked a bit sunken in, his high cheekbones peeking out more, and his hair was thin and slightly oily. His voice sounded tired and stressed, like the weight of the world was resting on his shoulders. Dean felt terrible for doing this to his brother.
going after his brother. He went into the kitchen and decided to make Dean some food for later when he’d eventually come out for a snack. Sam couldn’t cook all that well, but he was going to try.
“That’s not true. I love you!” Castiel said.
“Dean?” Sam said when his older brother came into the apartment. “What happened?”
“You want us to meet her already?” Sam asked.
“Talk to him,” she repeated. Dean nodded and they talked about a few different topics before parting ways. He knew this conversation could easily turn into a fight and he didn’t want that.
“Fuck yeah. I’ll be there soon!” With that, he hung up. Castiel rolled his eyes at his brother’s silly behavior. He loved him though.
. If this was a movie, I’d be happier,” Dean sniffled, wiping his face of the tears. “I got away from all of this because I knew I deserved better, but I just felt so empty without Cas.”
“They’ll be the best you ever tasted!” And with that, Sam left. Castiel waved as he got in the car and then shut his door.
"Sammy," he croaked, voice raspy from disuse. Sam jolted and quickly looked at Dean's face.
“It was an accident in the engine room,” the soldier at his door explained. “He saved everyone else in the room, got them out in time. He’s a hero, sir”
“It’s definitely cute. Seems like a nice place to raise your kiddos, whenever y’all decide to have any,” Dean teased. He’d give up his left nut to be able to see the look on Sam’s face when he got flustered all the time.
On his way through San Antonio, Dean passed one of the bigger theaters and saw they were doing a screening of The Wizard of Oz, the sing-along edition. He pulled into the parking lot, thankful that it wasn’t super busy out.
**********
“How come
Sam sat as quietly as he could while Dr. Barnes checked over Dean's vitals.
He was excited about the pie Castiel agreed to make. The man seemed very sweet and he hoped they could be friends, even with his husband too. Dean wasn’t sure how long he’d be in town, but either way, he didn’t have to worry about getting attached.
"No, no, no, stay awake," Sam said, shaking his shoulder a bit. Dean blinked a few times and nodded. "I'll be right back. Stay awake."
Seeing him on the edge, Inias’s parents intercepted the condolences and accepted them on his behalf to give him some space.
“Shut up,” Sam huffed.
He sat and talked with Inias about the going-on’s of his garden, the town pool, and their friends and family. He talked about everything and nothing. Just like they used to, only Inias never said anything back.
“Someone will be over soon, with his body, and they’ll also help you with planning the funeral.” With that, he was gone.
Crowley shook his head. “No, I don’t wanna intrude on a family moment. I’ll get out of your hair.”
.” He wasn’t angry at the messenger. He was angry at the Captain for not listening to everyone on the boat when they complained they weren’t ready to move out yet, that more work needed to be done. They never listen and look at what happened.
He’d never seen Dean fall this hard from someone, ever. It shook him. Castiel, right now, didn’t deserve his brother. Castiel had his own thing to figure out first before he could pursue a relationship, and Sam just wished he’d done that
“The cemetery? Don’t they have someone to look over it?” Gabriel asked before eating another cookie whole.
“I know you’re always here with me.”
Castiel chuckled. “I bet you would.”
Dean handed him a paper plate covered in foil. “Here. This is for Castiel, as a thank you for the pie.”
A few times a week, he would get people from town coming to buy fruits, vegetables, and even flowers from him. He normally just gave it to them for free but would take it if they insisted. He was doing fine, even though he missed his husband every day.
She stayed while he made the phone call to his parents but reluctantly left him for the phone call to his mother. He was scared. He was only 23. He just wanted his mom. He wanted her to hold him and protect him right now before he had to face the world.
“Hey, honey. I’m back. I hope you weren’t too lonely or anything. Today, I decided to have your favorite lunch,” he said as he pulled out a ham and turkey sandwich and kettle chips. “You could eat this simple meal every day if I’d let you get away with it.” He laughed to himself quietly and ignored how loud it sounded on the sacred ground. It was the only thing about cemeteries that made him uncomfortable.
Jo giggled. “Yeah, I think so, too. Be careful on the way home, yeah?”
“I would’ve been married still. I wouldn’t even be here. We’d be living somewhere north with our child by now,” was all Castiel said. Dean felt like Castiel had just ripped his heart out.
“How are you still single,” Dean muttered, and Castiel laughed again.
Castiel narrowed his eyes and tilted his head, and though the gesture was childlike, Dean felt the weight of the other man’s experience and intelligence fall on him; his response was a lubricious smirk; anything rather than look abashed. Castiel quirked an eyebrow, and then said, for Perry’s benefit as well as Dean’s, “Let’s both be really happy they’re healthy and Perry has been feeding them properly.” Castiel had seen, too often for his taste, what happens to farm families with lots of livestock and not much money for feed.
But he didn’t, not really. He didn’t say anything. And she gave skillful, knowing, wicked head (sigh) and if her son Ben was at a friend’s sometimes she’d nab him in the doorway on the way in from his shift and work him over until he was gasping.
“I don’t know,” I said, after a long silence that I did not want to fill. “Maybe I knew before, but I don’t know where that memory is. But my love knows where I put my memories. I do remember that I put my memories on top.”
Dean looked up from the man’s forearms and made the mistake of looking directly into his eyes.
“Both,” Dean said.
“Alcohol poisoning?” Cas asked, frowning. Dean had pulled away from him.
“Yeah,” Dean said in a bleached little voice. “If you’re going to see Crowley I kinda need to warn you.”
“I have an exit strategy,” Cas said.
“Me and Anna own it. Michael’s a guest,” Cas said.
Dean stayed another half hour, and then as quietly as he could, let himself out. His last thought as he gently pressed the crash bar on his way out, was to pray to God that Cas got the guidance he wanted, and the strength.
“I was just wanting to talk to you, uh, Father,” he hedged.
He was addicted.
“How was the wedding?” Ash asked.
Benny looked like he wasn’t buying it. “So how did you meet this guy?”
After a moment during which Dean devoured Cas with his eyes, he looked down. “I need someone to be with who can deal with me being kind of impulsive, and occasionally expensive,” Dean said.
“How? I don’t buy oatmeal!” Dean said in astonishment.
Dean said, “But if it doesn’t work out I still want to be friends afterward.”
To Cas’s astonishment, Dean’s voice suddenly got a harder edge to it than he’d ever previously heard. He said, “You know what, Cas, I think I like our friendship right where it is.” His tone became more reasonable. “Would you be okay staying my phone buddy?”
“Gabe’s going to talk to you and I’m going to get myself a beer,” Dean said. “But I’ll be close by.”
They were all friendly, down-to-earth people. Dean was an attractor for quality, it seemed. His brother Sam was a delight, seeming to spring to life in front of Cas from Dean’s many lightning sketches of him. Charlie made him laugh out loud the first time they met.
“I’m trying to grow my business, not give it away. And if you’re so interested in getting rid of it why not sign it over to me?”
“He said I can go help him kill them with gas if I don’t feel like paying for a truck; it will be a lot cheaper and I’ll have learned my lesson.”
He was on the doorstep, turned around.
“You neckin’ in there?” Gabe asked through the door. “You sound like bulldogs eating custard.”
“I told you he’d see it as a marriage,” Jimmy said.
“You’ll be passing the best burger joint in town on the way, if you’re hungry.” Dean said.
The daily texts relieved the worst of the feelings of loneliness, and provided some expectation for both of them that somebody cared about their trivia; their triumphs, asininities and fuckups were being attended to by another sensible adult, with wonderful ideas and great listening skills.
I tried to be patient. I couldn’t understand why it was so important to him, and he wouldn’t explain it. No one else would either. I began to feel as if I had said something terrible, something unforgivable, but what? “No, Dean, when I preserved a copy of my memories it was
They stopped in Arlington because Cas wanted to see Dean’s stepdad's business. (“It’s a scrap yard, Cas, they’re all pretty much the same.”) Ash and Bobby came out front when they heard the Impala and Bobby, who looked like and sounded like a hillbilly and was one of the smartest, kindest and best-read men Dean had ever met, said, “Cas Serafino?”
"Dean, have you ever been with a man before?" Cas asks, completely ignoring Dean's question.
"Okay, that's that round of those questions," She makes another note on the screen, "Now I have some less scary ones."
“Yeah, but you love me.”
"I'm going to get the rope." Castiel growls in his ear, and Dean bites his lip. Castiel walks to the other side of the room, having to adjust his partial erection in his pants when he reaches the counter. He pulls one of them open and removes the small coils of hemp rope. It's soft, so when Dean pulls on it, it won't leave marks, hopefully.
It's a wee bit short, and I know I promised we'd see how dark Dean got, but I'll be sticking it next chapter because my timeline told me to go eff myself, lol. Four days without an update isn't anywhere near as long as I thought it would be!! Guess what?! I ended up coming to stay with my sister, so I get to update for you guys! Yay! I hope you're celebrating. I am.
Sam nods, grinning. "Yeah, I mean, a little. You know, it impresses the girls." He shrugs.
He scrubs his calloused palms over his stubbled face in an ineffective effort to ground himself. He takes another deep breath, this one a little more helpful than the last.
"Ah, I know. I'm sorry. I should've called." Dean rubs the back of his neck self-consciously.
"How d'you know what I'm thinking, Cas?" Dean murmurs, looking down at him. Cas gives him a small smile in return. "Because your face cannot hide your emotions even when you try to. I don't have a child. If I did, I would've told you, I promise."
Cas smiles a bright gummy grin, and it makes Dean's heart stutter in his chest. He's breathtaking.
Cas nods firmly. "If you would like me to, I'd be more than happy to. If it's something you would rather do on your own, then I completely understand. I just want you to know I'm here if you need me." Dean's first immediate thought following that sentence is
A sleepy smile greets him.
Oh... Dean could probably smell something different now. "It smells amazing." He took another deep breath and sighed again. "What is it, Cas? Son of a bitch, you can't talk, can you? Here." There was some scrambling and then a phone was pressed into his hands. He rested his forehead against Dean's shoulder and looked down, the brightness of the screen hurting his eyes a little bit. He typed out a note in the notepad app and then handed the phone to Dean, praying that Dean would take it well. He had to.
As the coffee maker begins to steam and make the tell-tale sound of it brewing, his hands grip the sink, and he looks out the window. He smiles at the thought of him and Cas being the movie couple. They wake up happy in a sun-filled house, domestic bliss on a sepia-toned memory. He likes the idea of it. As he thinks that, he turns around and looks at the space. It's all open and airy, not small, but not too big either. It's bright and warm. Welcoming. Maybe that's why he feels so comfortable here.
"However, you have no idea of your true limits. It wouldn't be right to attempt to do something like that with you and have us going in without the proper information or boundaries. I refuse to do it. I've already set a terrible example for pacing and trust. I'm a better Dom than that and I won't continue to fuck that up."
Dean looks up from the man on the floor with a wide grin, there's blood on his teeth and a cut on his cheek. He takes a deep breath and rises up, "Hi! Sorry, they didn't want to let me in. Are you okay?"
"Holy shit," Dean murmurs. Cas laughs and straightens back up.
"Yes, I know," He rubs a hand through his hair, fucking it up more than it already was, and looks back at Dean. "I suppose that we keep living our lives. Cain is going to take care of John. Sam's still in town for a while, he could stay here if you want. Both of you. You'll need to go back to work eventually, so will I. We can just live." He shrugs again.
"I didn't bother. Benny likes to keep the rich people happy. If they get happy by being overprotective ignorant assholes while I'm fixing their shit, it gets us our paychecks."
Thinking a bit, he decides it's worth it and reaches behind him to grab Cas's wrist. He pulls it up over his waist and warm breath puffs across the top of his head.
Deleted25, sometimesiwritespn, Amy_O, CastielsHeart, bslove17, Kiodragon.. your guys' comments are something I continually come back and read because they're so beautiful, so thank you for that. You guys don't even know how much you inspire me and drive me to keep doing this. It's kind of sad really, lol.
Cas surges forward and Dean grabs his hair as their mouths mesh, Cas forcing his tongue inside and plundering his mouth, making Dean shiver all over. He whimpers and tugs on Cas's hair with his fingers, while the other hand scrambles around to grab Cas's T-shirt, pulling him in closer, unconsciously undulating his hips. God, he wishes he could get closer to Cas, his body is thrumming with excitement and anticipation. He doesn't think Cas would fuck him in the car, at least not here where there's-
Suddenly the door opened and a woman stepped out. She looked about thirty and her hair was a faded blonde color that reached her shoulders. She was wiping her hands on her apron as she questioned them. "Can I help you gentleman with something?"
He raises off Dean’s cock again, mouth slack and brain foggy, “God, yes. Just like that. Mmmm. Fuck.”
Dean reaches back behind him and finds Cas's lube-coated cock standing at full attention, hard and heavy, and Dean literally cannot wait to be speared open by it. He adjusts himself a little and then rubs the tip of Cas's cock against his hole, which tries to draw him in. Catching the flash of the 'Don't tease the wolf, boy' look in Cas's eyes, Dean directs his cock against his hole. The tip slides in, and Dean groans, letting go of Cas's erection and placing both hands on Cas's chest.
"You're not what, Dean?"
Castiel smirks at the thought of what they did earlier, remembering the taste of chocolate against Dean's skin. Castiel runs the tip of his nose up over the bridge of Dean's nose. Then along his forehead. He presses soft kisses across Dean's temples and over his brow.
"I knew I was right to have to do that. And I will be doing it again," Cas leans forward until his teeth are scraping across the lobe of Dean's ear, "Soon."
"Hey," Dean throws the wrapper back at him, "You deserve it. You're the one being a brat about this whole Cain thi-"
"It's just been a long day. I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to call you. It just kinda happened."
He reached the heavy metal door at the end of the hallway, Cas right behind him, and typed in the four number keycode to open the door without the alarm going off. He pushed the door open effortlessly and stepped out into the, thankfully, dim sunshine, blocking Cas's view of outside in the process. He was in the shadow of the building but he could still feel his skin start to tingle at being outside during the day. There was his Baby. She was parked between the back of the hotel and the sooty brick of an apartment building right next to it. It had been a tight fit, but Dean had had plenty of practice maneuvering Baby into places she probably shouldn't be.
Dean hadn’t realized he’d been talking aloud, but now that he knows, he doesn’t bother to stop his babbling. He’s too far gone.
"What the hell?" He mumbles to himself before picking up the box and bringing it inside. He sits it on the coffee table, only taking a short glance at it before rushing off to work, praying he makes it on time. He can't afford to be late.
"Okay. Dean?"
"A word?"
Dean swallows and looks away. He begins to tap his fingers anxiously. “Okay. Not what I expected, but alright… Do you uh, still want to have sex?”
"This just doesn't feel real, you know? I mean, we met a few days ago, and now we're... boyfriends and... you know. It's just... Good things don't really happen to me, you know? And you're perfect. This whole situation is just so... Hollywood. It's not real. I don't know. I'm kinda expecting the other shoe to drop and for me to wake up alone and-" Castiel shushes him.
"Fair enough. I want the whole truth. I want to know how you know all these things about me and what exactly we are doing here." Dean sighed heavily and rubbed his face with his hands vigorously before standing to walk back and forth across the room again. "Alright. Truth? I know a lot about you. When I saw you like three years ago or whatever I went to talk to you but I- Shit. There's really no way around this."
"Sorry. I just... You know how I am. I naturally assume the worst, and that makes it sound so bad. I don't mean to be that way... I just... I don't-"
She flits away without preamble, leaving Dean to swallow around the lump in his throat. The door to the room yawns cavernously, and he aches for the familiar inside of the Impala. Cas rubs his thumb across the back of Dean's hand soothingly.
D: going fine hes asleep right now im just checking in
"So what? Humans are just weak little-"
"My point is proven." He murmurs. Cas looks pretty smug like the winged dick that he is. Dammi- A hand fists itself into Dean's hair and Cas literally growls into Dean's ear. "Winged dick? You don't seem to think that when you call my name as you stroke yourself. You don't seem to think that when you come with your fingers buried deep inside yourself thinking about me, do you?" Dean actually fucking
"You're not going to touch him!" Sam yells, stepping in front of Cas. Cas throws his hand out and stops Sam from advancing.
"Me too, Cas. I'm glad it doesn't freak you out or anything."
He laughs, "I think we would. I'm gonna go talk to him."
"No."
They reach the street and Castiel resists the urge to look around and make sure Zachariah isn't close, he doesn't want to ruin this with his anxiety. Dean is one solid line of muscle up his entire back. He hears the whispered words over the milieu, "I'm going to show you my world. Trust me, okay?" Castiel does. Oddly, but implicitly. He finds himself nodding his assent, and then Dean's grabbing him by the hand again and pulling him to only God knows where. Castiel's never been more excited in his life.
"I said 'yeah, right.'" Cas releases his chin but keeps staring at him.
He kisses Dean's hair and squeezes him tighter. They lay in the silence just breathing and being with each other until Dean croaks, "Well, it's nice of you to drop by and see me at work."
After searching in the bathroom cabinet, every drawer in the house, and in his various jacket pockets, he concludes that no, he doesn't have any aspirin. Which means a trip to the store it is, he thinks grimly.
"I concede to your point. But still, stealing is just..."
Dean sings along and scrubs the exterior of the Camaro, shaking his hips and admiring the gleam of the newly washed paint, already rinsed off the suds. Cas had to take a phone meeting this morning so Dean came to work early instead of going home. Besides his music and the hum of morning rush-hour traffic outside, the garage is quiet. He needs to replace the alternator on the Z so he can move on to other repairs; he hasn't had the time. Spending time with Cas, dealing with his daddy issues - it's been time-consuming.
"Like... something to say when one of is wanting to change the dynamic. It's easier than asking a shit ton of questions, you know? Just, uh, say the word, and if the other person is in the same headspace there, just repeat the word. Then we'd know. No awkward questions about 'Hey, you wanna do this?' or 'I think I'm ready for this.' Is that okay?"
Dean snorts and mutters. "All I did was sell vegetables."
understand! Stop."
She smiles and says, "Good. Now go get your man."
When he gets there, he gets greeted at the door with a kiss, and Dean wonders why he ever leaves. Cas tells him they're not scening today, which Dean pouts about, but really, he can't complain. They end up curled together on the couch watching The Incredible Hulk. They eat too much popcorn, and Cas licks the salted butter off Dean's lips. It shouldn't be sexy, but it is.
Dean was actually surprised that Cas just started stepping forward without hesitation. Most humans were squirrely when it came to being denied their sight, but apparently, Cas really did trust him. Excellent. When he was close Dean wrapped his hands around Cas's waist, earning a nice gasp that went straight to Dean's dick for some reason. Damn, this kid was like an aphrodisiac or something. Delicious possibilities played through his head briefly before he brought himself back to the beautiful man in his arms. He sidestepped and moved behind Cas, not taking his arms off of him, and positioned him to where he was facing Baby's left side fully. He wanted Cas to get the unadulterated full monty for the first time."Open your eyes, and take a look at my pride and joy." He smiled when Cas gasped as he saw her. That was a good reaction. He could smell that. For what had to be the thousandth time since stealing Cas last night he thanked his vampiric senses for letting him know some of what Cas was feeling.
“And where is she?” Sam queried.
“Yeah.” Shepard hunkered down next to her and took out an energy bar. He quickly devoured it, washing it down with several deep swigs of water from his hardsuit’s internal drinking reservoir. “But it won’t be worth anything if we don’t get that blast shield open.” He looked over at Kaidan. “Ready, K?”
“That had to be tough man,” Vega said, “not getting to have a childhood because you had to keep moving around all the time.” He put some salsa on his eggs and took a couple of bites before adding a dash of pepper sauce.
Castiel set his jaw. “I’ll take that chance,” he replied. “I won’t rest until Sam and Dean are out of Cerberus’ hands.” He turned and walked toward the door, then stopped and looked back over his shoulder. “At least wait until I’ve left to tell Stannis, please.” He vanished in a rush of wings and the briefest whiff of ozone. Liara closed her eyes and let out a heavy exhale, then slumped back into her chair, her arm and shoulder still tingling from the angel’s touch. She looked up at the ceiling for several long minutes, wondering how she would tell Shepard that his last Irregular had left and that she didn’t lift a finger to try and stop him.
Dean admired himself in the mirror. “Not bad,” he said. “Not bad at all!” He grinned. “We look pretty good, I think.” Castiel tugged a bit at the collar of his shirt until Dean walked over and adjusted it for him. He did a deep knee-bend and got an impressed look on his face. “And they’re comfy, too.”
“Here, catch!” Sam tossed him something wrapped in foil and pointed back over his left shoulder. “There’s a whole assload of them in that store right there.” Castiel opened the package to find what looked like a slightly moist granola bar. He hungrily devoured the bar, and strolled past Sam into the store. Dean and Sam heard the sound of another foiled wrapper tearing and boxes falling from shelves, and walked in to find the angel shoving fistfuls of the meal bars into the pockets of his coat along with about a dozen small energy-drink bottles. “Good thing we remembered to bring it from the Normandy for him,” Sam jibed. Castiel turned when he heard Sam, and stood there with a meal bar sticking out of his mouth, looking rather like a child who had been caught with his hand in a cookie jar. Several bars fell out of his overstuffed pockets before he bit off a chunk of the bar and ate it.
“Anytime, Wrex.” Shepard smiled, and Garrus made a big show of clearing his throat.
“Stannis,” Kaidan said, “I don’t know if we should--” The words died in his throat when the woman looked over at them.
“Izzy…” Meshach came around the table and put a hand on her shoulder. “We’ll do our best to keep looking for him. You know that right?”
pollu--” His words were cut short by a sharp punch to the face. Camael staggered under the blow and immediately put a hand to his nose.
CASTIEL: (facepalming) Oh for my Father’s sake…
Shepard and Tali sat down to watch the sunset, and Kaidan called up his Omni-Tool to read a text. He walked over to Dean and Sam. “You guys need to get back to the Normandy ASAP,” he said. As if on cue, the shuttle landed and its doors opened.
“Because,” Azrael said quietly. She took her time getting up, and looked Sam in the eye. “When you and your brother think that you’re left with your own devices,” she remarked, gently tapping Sam in the chest, “that is when you tap into your own power to do truly great things.” She shrugged. “Besides, would you really have believed me if I’d said “Hi, I’m an archangel who needs to send you to a world where man is in space, there are aliens that can live on sugar and aren’t Bugs from
“Ordinarily it wouldn’t,” Azrael responded between wheezes. “But only half of me is camped inside your head.” She took Sam’s hand, and the angel’s complexion slowly returned to normal. “Sorry about that--needed to tap your soul for an energy shot. How are you feeling?”
“Perfection.”
Castiel looked at Kaidan. “You don’t see the mark on his forehead?” Kaidan shook his head. “It’s an Enochian sigil,” Castiel explained. “We called it the Mark of Death--he’s got an angelic assassin controlling him.”
Shepard raised an eyebrow. “London? I don’t understand--why aren’t we hitting the Citadel directly?”
EDI: Agreed. We should let this remain our secret.
Stannis gets himself together with help from the rest of Team Free Will, we learn how he dealt with the secret in the Hall of the 21st, and Kevin snarks at an archangel.
was grieving too,
Sam looked down at the table, then looked over to MedBay where a body lay on one of the beds, covered with a sheet. “Do it,” he whispered. Azrael stood and leaned across the table to give Sam a kiss on the forehead.
“It marks a turian’s birthplace or, if they’re in the military, their unit. All these soldiers are wearing the markings of the Ninth Platoon. Word of advice: Never trust a bare-faced turian.” Dean nodded. He opened his mouth to ask another question when another soldier leapt down and grabbed the first one by the lapels.
“Mmmph.” The angel finished chewing and swallowed when Dean fixed him with an annoyed look. “Sorry--I, uh, should be okay now.” He cracked open an energy drink and drained in three large gulps. A couple of drops ran down his chin, and he wiped his mouth with his sleeve, then let out a poorly-stifled belch. “OK, let’s go.”
slaves. Our time on the other side of the Door, the two million-plus years we spent speaking to our own vessels and forming friendships with them...it’s taught our Consensus that our people
Israfel looked down at the floor. Tears welled in her eyes, and she took a deep breath. A knock on the glass made her look up to see K’a’l looking back at her. The husk nodded and put a hand over the roundel marking where its heart used to be.
“Led down the garden path?” The turian scanned the lower level. Shepard and Kaidan continued to wander the floor, occasionally talking to other partygoers, throwing a few credits on gambling tables, and distracting guards while Shepard quietly hacked a security sensor or two. “I think that’s the phrase that humans use. It’s not just you--I’ve got that feeling too.”
“Yes.” She leaned against the rippling forcefield, and the husk did the same within its glassteel prison. “It’s been a while, my husband. I have much to tell you.”
Tali checked over the shotgun. “I always regretted not picking up one of these when we were rewriting the Geth heretics,” she said as she slotted a fresh clip in it. “This looks like it’ll be very useful. Thanks.” She quickly punched up a diagram on her Omni-Tool. “OK, let’s head through that door, and we should be close to the network hub that we need to access.”
Dean scratched his forehead for a second and sighed. “Then we’ll have to make it up as we go along, just like last time. It sucks, but we can’t really do much else.”
The Cerberus commander pulled his sidearm and fired twice--the shots bounced off the human, who advanced on him with anger etched on his face. The stranger reached out and clapped his hand on the top of the commander’s head. Blue-white light streamed from the commander’s eyes and mouth, and burned out from under the skin on his face and body, tracing implants and circuitry. The commander collapsed to the deck with smoke coming from his burned-out eye sockets. The stranger looked up at the camera above the exit from the shuttle bay and smiled before vanishing with the sound of flapping wings.
“Yeah--Dr. Chakwas and I had a chat about the one with the trenchcoat. Castiel. She said that his medical scans were better than normal--they were perfect, like he was created rather than the product of random chance or grown in a lab.” Shepard stroked his chin. “But there aren’t any signs of spliced genes in him. She also said that Sam’s DNA showed signs of being almost completely rewritten.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The pair rounded a corner, and spotted a handful of husks and cannibals. “Shit,” Miranda whispered as they got into cover. Sam punched up a function on his Omni-Tool.
The door to the lounge opened. Sam looked up from his book to see Azrael enter. “We’ve got two problems,” she said. “Which do you want to hear about first?”
“No,” Castiel said quietly. “I’d, uh, rather not.” He got an uncomfortable look on his face. “I...I feel better when I wear it,” he admitted. “More confident.”
On the bridge, EDI looked over at Joker for a moment and silently registered Castiel's arrival in the starboard observation lounge. Joker looked back at her, smiled, and reached across the gap between her seat and his. EDI reached back to take his hand and returned the smile, mentally noting another question to ask Shepard the next time she talked to him.
“Long night?” The wiry blonde man stood and deactivated his Omni-Tool. Faber had a florid heart-shaped face and thin hair that refused to stay completely pinned up, which made her look like she’d been on a bender in the ship’s lounge even when she was stone-sober.
GLYPH: Dr. T’Soni, I have a message for you.
“Objection noted,” Mordin said, his Omni-Tool held up to the technician’s head. “Now, please release krogan.” The technician started tapping commands in as soon as he recovered, and a door opened next to the pod. “Will meet you up top Shepard--Hurry!”
Their room faced out on the harbour and the Cascades, affording them a lovely view of the mountains over the tops of apartment buildings that had grass and gardens on their roofs. Sam took a cursory survey of the storefronts on the streets below,  then went to take an inventory of the rest of the room. A mini-fridge next to the television was fully stocked with drinks whose labels he didn’t even recognize—some labels carried writing in strange scripts and pictograms, and a handful of the bottles had red tops emblazoned with the word DEXTRO.
“The channel has been closed, Dr. T’soni.” Glyph buzzed near the monitors. “I have received Agent Cerulean’s report, and it is ready for you to read at your convenience.”
“Go time!” Dean barked. “Shepard, it’s Dean--I’m giving you our coordinates! Try to lure that Reaper over our way and get it in the middle of the trap!” He punched a couple of commands into his Omni-Tool, then looked at Sam and Castiel. “Let’s get to the top of that ridgeline and outta this canyon--move!” The trio scrambled out of the area of the trap and up to the top of the steep ridge. A tooth-rattling foghorn cut through the air, and the Winchesters looked over to see a Reaper Destroyer heading toward their trap, chasing a tiny geth hovercraft. The hovercraft banked sharply, and cruised down toward the trap with the Reaper close behind. “Shepard, want us to provide a little encouragement to that Reaper?”
“Umm...Who are you?”
“By the Goddess,” Liara said. Before she could type a response, another message pinged.
.” Shepard slowly turned to look at who was speaking, and he blinked when he saw his brother.
“No--all Eve could tell me was that he just vanished. Mordin apologized and said he wasn’t paying attention. Can’t say as I blame him, since he’s trying to cure a disease.” Sam shook his head and rubbed his temples. “You’re sure Cas isn’t indoctrinated?”
“The children of Aneth’k have been avenged by their sons,” Israfel said quietly to the pile of ash still glowing on the bottom of the containment unit. “You’re free now.” She ran a hand down the glass of the containment unit and closed her eyes, drinking in the quiet left behind by the dissipation of the containment field around the unit.
“What the hell?” Shepard walked in and picked up the shell of Liara’s drone, holding it in his hands like a crystal basketball. “It looks like there was an explosion here.” He walked farther into the room, carefully stepping around a wrecked information terminal, and laid the shell on the bed.
to let go, Stannis. That’s what it took for me to finally understand why you’re rallying the galaxy together to fight an “unwinnable” foe. You’re doing it because it
The human nodded. “Got it. Pardon me.” She stifled a burp against the back of her hand, and handed the now-empty glass to the nameless angel that had given it to her in the first place. “Thank you again,” she said before turning back to Cadfael. “I’ve gotta coordinate a bunch of stuff, now that the fighting is over. Can Kael help with coming whatever’s left of the Citadel for anyone that got supremely lucky?”
Castiel looked at the cat and sighed. “I need to go,” he said quietly. “Sorry.” Ninja sighed, then stood and stretched before giving Castiel one last headbutt-rub in the face and leaping over to Dean’s cot, where he wriggled his way under the covers to snuggle up next to the sleeping hunter. Castiel sat up and reached over to fish a comb out of a pocket on his trenchcoat. He stood, ran the comb through his hair a few times and did his best to smooth out his fatigues, then grabbed his coat from the hook and put it on before heading up the steps and out of Engineering.
Dean smiled and nodded, and they kissed again. “I more than liked it. I just wonder how I’m going to measure up now,” he joked. “I mean, I don’t have biotics, but…” They rolled so that Castiel was under Dean. “Here, relax and let me show you a couple of other things I like.” He started to kiss his way down Castiel’s torso as the angel closed his eyes and sighed happily.
“So we’ve got to find Miranda and Oriana,” Shepard remarked. “Cas? You OK?”
Cadfael stroked his beard for a moment.
“This really hurts, Miranda--and the longer these damned things stay in Sam’s body, the harder it will be for me to keep shielding him. Please. I really do need...need your help. I’ve got his soul...arrgh.” Azrael gritted his teeth. “...sequestered.” The angel in hunter’s skin looked up at Miranda, tears streaming down his face. “Help...help…” The glowing spots became welts that swelled along Azrael’s spine, and he curled up with his head in his hands.
“So it’s like magic,” Sam interjected. “Sort of.”
“Heavy Fleet,” Han’Gerrel’s voice came in over the comms. “All forward.”
long time ago.” Israfel sighed, and an alarm beeped on her Omni-Tool. “Shit--I’ve got another thirty minutes, and then I have to get into uniform and go back on-duty.” She got up from the table. “You can bring that sandwich with you if you like.” She walked over toward the bookcase and pulled a bookend. “You don’t have to open the door like this--it’s keyed to your Omni-Tool--but I’m strange and find the idea of a secret passage to be amusing.” She grinned and winked as the door swung open into a short hallway. “The door lock is keyed to Omni-Tools for us, but it’ll just open for you because it's keyed to your genetic code. We’ll knock before coming in, though. That apartment is your private space; we kinda want to respect it.”
“You’re thinking of Mordin,” Chakwas said.
“Yes, P’a’l.” Israfel’s voice was heavy and warbled slightly as she fought back another round of tears. “Sometimes he acknowledges me. Sometimes he’s inert. But then you know that.” She placed a hand on the force field that surrounded the glasteel case and pushed slightly, causing the force field to ripple under her touch. “
“Shh,” Hannah whispered. “Shh. For what it’s worth, I forgive you. Just please, Israfel--promise me that you’ll do everything you can to bring Stannis back alive and in one piece when this is all over.”
DEAN: What, Cas? Angel Radio? I thought you turned that off?
“Going after the wayward son?” the reflection asked. Israfel nodded. “I’ll be okay, Izzy. It’s not like we haven’t done this sort of thing before.” The reflection smiled. “And it’s not the first time I’ve had to give you a pep talk in a bathroom mirror, either, young lady.”
“Why do you refer to yourself as “we”?” Dean asked.
Adeleh quirked an eyebrow and tilted her head sideways a bit. “Companion? Wait wait, don’t tell me--you’re the Doctor, and you need my help to defeat the Daleks.”
Team Free Will takes their first trip to the Citadel. Castiel becomes enthralled by a Mass Relay. And Garrus explains why dextro food will cause issues.
"No!" Static crackled over him as his barrier reflexively came up. “I am Stannis,” he bellowed as hot tears started to roll down his cheeks. “I am Stannis Michael Shepard! Me! Not him! Me!” He took several deep breaths, eyebrows knitting and mouth opening and closing as he looked around the room with wide eyes, then collapsed to his knees and started to cry. “It was all supposed to be mine,” he sobbed, letting go of Israfel. “The Normandy, the salvation of humanity...it was mine…”
“Come on,” Tali said, “The fleets are in position--let’s get inside!” The group fought their way up the outside of the base to a back door. “Cover me, I’ll hack the door.”
“We’ll get there soon enough,” Shepard commented with mild amusement. “Come on, we’d better get moving and get that signal cut off so the Quarians can evacuate safely.”
“Man...” Dean sighed. “OK, Thane’s apparently decided to lone-wolf it--but he gave us a pointer to where we need to go. Everyone ready?” Sam and Castiel nodded. “Good--let’s roll.” He popped his head around one side of the storefront, and saw a Cerberus combat engineer getting ready to set up an automated turret. Dean fired off another salvo of spikes from his shotgun and hit the turret’s housing, causing it to shred the engineer with a hail of deadly shrapnel when it exploded.
Vega came to get the Winchesters and Castiel out of the medbay when he, Shepard, and Liara got back from the Citadel. “Come on, man. Time to get you some new digs.” He led them down to the engineering deck and showed them to what amounted to a crawl space under the stairs where three cots had been set up in a u-shape. “It’s a little cozy, but it’s the best place we could put you. Loco wants you three to get fitted too, once you’re settled in.”
“If it makes you feel any better,” Garrus said reassuringly, “the car does have inertial compensators and safety harnesses. And I promise to be extra-careful when I drive.” Dean took another deep breath and closed his eyes for a long moment, then let it out. He opened his eyes and nodded.
“Really?” Sam asked as he took the diary and sat down in a navigator’s seat. “I thought you didn’t need to re-read things.”
Shepard shook the Councilor’s outstretched hand. “You don’t owe me anything, Councilor. At times like these, we all have to stick together.” He looked back toward Castiel, who was surrounded by empty energy drink bottles and meal-bar wrappers. The angel’s lips were tinted orange from the drinks, and Sam and Dean had walked back to check on him. “I’ll have a report submitted to the Council about my irregulars within the week--I was hoping to keep them under wraps,” Shepard said with a half-sigh, “but I guess there’s no keeping them a secret now.”
“My forgiveness?” Sam asked the angel in front of him.
. He still deserved a chance at some kind of life.”
“You wanted to have a fight in my CIC?” Shepard asked right before charging a heavy trooper. The trooper’s hard-light shield shattered, and Shepard fired off a shotgun blast that left the trooper bloody on the floor.
Castiel ripped open the wrapper of a meal bar and gobbled it down, then looked around with the wrapper in his hand until he found a bin marked with a turian throwing something inside. He threw the wrapper into the bin, then got out an energy drink from one of his coat’s inside pockets and shotgunned it before throwing the bottle into the bin. “How many of those have you had?” Sam asked.
Almost immediately, the answer came up:
“Uhhh yeah,” Wrex replied, “you do.”
Dean flew through Bobby’s front window, half-pushed and half-thrown. He landed hard, face-first, on wet grass and almost immediately passed out.
Thank you all for sticking with me thus far--I'm taking lots of time between chapters at this point because I'm acting as my own beta (so I am doing a lot of self-crit and heavy editing to make sure that I don't break character and that continuity is tight).
Shepard keyed in the comms code, and his mother appeared on the secondary QEC pad. “Stannis?” Hannah asked.
Udina makes his move, Thane goes to the sea, Kaidan returns to the Normandy. And Team Free Will is introduced to the Council in rather dramatic fashion.
Shepard stood with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Liara, they’re civilians. Not only that, but they’re untrained to the point of being clueless. EDI told me on my way to the shuttle bay that the ringleader of that group gave himself a black eye when he couldn’t figure out how to open up an M-8 Avenger--and I swear I heard her giggle. An Avenger, the most basic rifle in the galaxy and something that recruits learn to use their second day of basic training, and those flannel-wearing fools couldn’t even figure out how to open it up without hurting themselves.”
“The other three are safe, Legion. We need to go now!”
“--Normandy, and he wanted to come and see the, uh, the legend for himself.” A few of the soldiers snickered at that. “We’re sorry to bother you. OK Cas, let’s go,” Sam quickly shepherded Castiel away from the knot of soldiers and back out to the street. “Cas, what were you thinking?” he whispered as he and Dean hustled the angel away from the gates and back to their hotel. “They have guns, all we have is the salt I got at that grocery store we went to, and from what you told us while packing away all those pancakes at breakfast, you still don’t have your mojo.”
“And that was?” Hannah’s question, delivered in a snarl of barely-contained anger, cut Israfel deeply. A tear ran down the angel’s cheek.
“I’m curious Dean,” Garrus asked after a couple of minutes, “you have spirits in your world, right?  What are they like?”
Sam shrugged. “He’s unconscious and in the medbay,” he said. “And we’re kinda worried about him. You saw how he was in some kind of trance when he saw his first mass relay, and he was spending time around the ship’s drive core a lot too. After what you told us about the Reapers being behind it, we’re hoping he’s not becoming indoctrinated.”
Cortez raised an eyebrow. “You think they’re indoctrinated Reaper agents?”
“Because those are the rules;” Israfel shrugged. “an angel can’t inhabit a vessel--I prefer to call them companions--without their express consent. And we need to inhabit a vessel in order to walk among mortals. Shit, I’d have asked even if it wasn’t the rules.”
“Me too,” Benny replied in his cajun drawl. “Don’t mind these two.” He indicated the vampires on either side of him. “They’re with me. Come on, we gotta go.” The trees wavered in Dean’s vision. He blinked a couple of times, and they came into focus. The growls and howls of Purgatory’s inhabitants echoed through the forest, and Dean nodded.
“Don’t you fucking die on me,
“What?”
“Commander,” Glyph chirped, “Your Spectre ID has just been used to access the Citadel Archives.”
“Then we can’t fail.”
“Even Admirals are expected to serve,” Tali replied. “Besides, I’m much better at hacking than I am at ordering ships around.” She paused by a console and started typing on it. “Just checking the schematics...there. Through that door is the main battery.” The quarian looked at Castiel. “No offense--I just feel better when I can double-check for myself.”
“You…” the Reaper protested.
“Be careful!” Javik exclaimed. “This machine is about to rebel!” The Prothean narrowed his eyes and started to reach for his sidearm when Liara reached over and stopped him.
Dean reached behind his back and drew his demon-killing knife from its scabbard. Castiel pulled two angel blades from his trenchcoat and handed one to Sam. A trio of the grey zombies let out a metallic shriek and started to run toward them with an ungainly loping gait, finally affording the hunters their first good look at them. Strange blue veining ran over their bodies, and they each had a glowing blue roundel in their torsos. Their eyes also glowed blue, and their skin looked dessicated and wrinkled, their clawed hands and feet black as if burned.
Steve set one of the beers down next to Dean, then cracked the top on his. “Our Mister Winchester here is a really quick study.”
. You’ve still got a few minutes to make your call.” Hackett smiled and walked out of the comms room.
“You mean do I love her?” Israfel let out a half-sigh. “I’ve always loved her, Steven. But I'm not an idiot. I know that her heart truly belongs to you, and yours to her.” She reached over and took Hackett’s hands in hers and gave them a gentle squeeze. “The decision that you and I argued about, the one that drove me to depart from you...it was the right decision, but I didn’t realize it at the time.”
Steve laughed softly. “Yeah, it’s pretty handy--the Omni-Tool breaks down the old part or whatever’s left of it, and reconstructs it on the fly. Go ahead, give it a shot.” Dean activated his Omni-Tool and held his hand over the remaining vector coil. “Take it nice and easy,” Steve said. “Your tool will flash at you if you’re going too fast or too slow.” Almost as soon as the words came out of Steve’s mouth, Dean’s Omni-Tool flashed five times in quick succession and the energy arc vanished.
“I apologize, Commander,” Admiral Raan said. “It was only a few weeks ago that we thought we would be able to finally take back the Homeworld--Han’Gerrel...well, you’ve met him before. You know how he can be.”
“Where is Lieutenant Cortez?” Castiel asked innocently, looking up from his locker. “I wanted to ask him about some modifica--” The Winchesters grabbed him and hustled him toward the elevator. “Wait, what are--”
“Welcome to the Master Library. We started it when we arrived from the other world, right before the end of a cycle. Many cycles’ worth of art, literature, philosophy, science, and pretty much everything else we could cram into this ever-expanding space is here. Catalogued, preserved, translated, and--God willing--ready to share with the mortals of this cycle if we all win.” She pointed down to one of the spokes on the wheel. “That hall right there is where you’ll find the Nazara Dominion, if you want to know more about the race that got melted down to make Sovereign.” She pointed at another spoke. “And that right there is the hall where you’ll find everything you ever wanted to know about the Prothean Empire. I know of at least one archaeologist who will explode with glee if she gets the chance to look through it.”
CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS. SAM, DEAN, CASTIEL, SHEPARD, and KAIDAN are sitting around the coffee table. NINJA THE CAT is perched on the table grooming himself next to the whisky bottle.
“Aye aye, sir!” Kaidan snapped to attention and crisply saluted. “And Shepard, you never have to worry about me again. I’ve got your back.”
to offer you a chance to start over. Maybe not here, but somewhere. It doesn’t even have to be with me. But this is
“Yeah Joker,” Sam replied. “Where are you?” A Cerberus shuttle went flying past, and he and Dean ducked behind the store’s counter.
“We’re trapped!”
“Merry Christmas to us,” Dean half-whispered. “Here,” he said, reaching for a hefty-looking shotgun with four barrels stacked on top of each other. “Take this.” Dean tossed the shotgun to Sam and grabbed another of the same kind. He grabbed several clips and shoved them into pockets on his trousers, then picked up more clips and started loading them into the shotgun. “We’re going to go hunting for some Cerberus douchebags,” he snarled, sliding another box of clips across the floor toward Sam.
“Tongue…” Dean groaned softly. “I love tongue…”
“Damn.” Dean’s eyes widened briefly, and an uncomfortable silence hung over the room for a minute before Dean spoke again. “OK, so what about you? If they can “reprogram” humans and others, doesn’t that mean they can mess with you and your programming?”
“But now?”
“Yeah.” Dean--the Righteous Man--marched toward the crowd of hungry Leviathans that stood before him, flaming sword in hand. “Listen up, you fuckers!” he bellowed. “I ganked your boss--and you’re next!” Several of the monsters shrieked at him, and they charged. Dean bellowed a cry of rage, and waded into the morass of bodies, swinging his blade in a wide arc. Leviathans fell, heads separated from bodies, their black blood splattering the landscape, splattering Dean. He kicked and punched and threw his foes around the clearing, howling with release. This was Purgatory. This was pure. This was
"Stannis..." the woman in the circle whispered sleepily. "They're looking for you."
“We’re getting her out of here,” he said.
KAIDAN: Professionally weird?
“Welcome aboard, Admiral Raan.” Shepard smiled. “What brings the Admiralty Board to the Normandy?”
“Commander,” he said, “I brought a prayer book--will you join me?”
“Husk?” Chuck shrugged a bit and sat down at a nearby reading table. “Come on, Gabriel--it’s in glass, behind a force field. What’s it going to do to you?” He pulled out a chair. “Here, sit down. Let me do what I do best, and tell you a story.”
“Are you shitting me?! I haven’t seen my sister in a year and a fucking half!” Adeleh threw the tablet down and got up in the angel’s face. “Where is she?!” she demanded.
The last stop after a day of cruising gunshops and the occasional bar was a food court in Zakera Ward. “This place is pretty popular, especially with the krogan,” the turian drawled as they approached a kiosk decorated with a neon sign showing a bizarre fanged four-legged creature with fish-like eyes wearing a chef’s hat.”The Fish Dog Food Shack. Cheap, but pretty good. Just remember, you don’t want to order off the dextro menu.”
Sam turned and shook his head. “No, officer,” he said with a slight smile. “Thanks—he’s….he’s having a migraine. I think. We’ll get him someplace quiet where he can sleep it off.” He quickly turned back to Dean and Castiel. “I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore,” Sam quickly muttered as he and his brother helped Cas to his feet. “Let’s get off the street and find out where we are before Robocop over there decides that we’re trouble.” He looked at his brother and added, “You look like you’ve had a wrestling match with a bag of grass clippings. What the hell happened?” Dean had grass stains on his knees, left thigh, and jacket. His sandy hair was mussed, a dandelion mashed into his forehead. Sam reached up and plucked the smashed weed from his brother’s forehead, leaving a green and yellow smudge behind.
“Yeah,” Dean commented. “We were kinda on the run from some weird zombie-type things, shamblers with guns for arms, and a giant angry robot that was shooting some kind of big red death ray out its ass. Face. Whatever. Look, I can tell that you really don’t want us here, so why don’t you give us our stuff back and let us off on Mars, and we can hitchhike back, ok?”
“Mmm? Mmmhmm!” Castiel nodded emphatically as he chewed.
“Varren. They’re pack predators, native to Tuchanka but they’ve become a fairly common pest in most parts of the galaxy. So, they usually get hunted as a protein source. When they’re not used as warbeasts by the krogan and batarians, that is.” He pointed to the sign outside the kiosk. “That’s a varren, by the way--a cartoonish varren, but still a varren.”
“Cortez,” Shepard quietly spoke into his comm unit, “The bomb’s disarmed. Come get us.”
“Not in the way that it used to be--but I think I may be more useful now,” Castiel said. “I’ll still need to sleep and eat, and be careful not to overtax myself. But other than that...”
“I...yeah. So, uh...EDI kinda told me what you and Eve talked about,” he said to Dean. “Y’know, before you went to Tuchanka. If it makes you feel any better, I lost my mom too, when I was younger. Not to a yellow-eyed demon or anything, but I still understand what it’s like to lose a parent.”
“The mission parameters changed,” Gerrel responded defiantly. He looked over at Shepard, who walked past Sam on his way out of the comms room. “Shepard’s a soldier,” he continued as Shepard came down the steps to the holoprojector. “I’m sure he understands, don’t you Commander?” Sam saw the briefest crackle of static dance across Shepard’s shoulders, and quickly moved to station himself near the War Room’s exit. “If you could take back Earth with a little friendly fire,” Gerrel asserted, “you’d do it in--”
“Yes,” Sam and Dean replied in unison. Shepard looked at Castiel, eyebrow arched.
“Thank you Sam,” Dr. Chakwas said without missing a beat. “Your fatigues are on the bench over there,” she said, pointing to three separate stacks of clothing that had each been paired with a new pair of combat boots. "EDI even put your name on them. Okay gentlemen, which of you two wants to be next?”
Dean looked at Thane with suspicion for a moment, then shook his hand before turning his chair to face him. “Sorry--I’m just getting a little weirded out by the fact that everyone’s so nice here.”
Lawson and his bodyguards quickly led Dean down the hall to a large room. “Dean,” Lawson said, “we’re trapped.” A seething horde of husks stood at the far end of the room, behind a force field. "We gotta get through all them before we can save Sam." The hunter stepped forward and clenched his fists. Lawson stepped back and nodded at one of the troopers, who handed Dean his SMG. Dean looked at it and threw it to the ground.
Shepard’s Omni-Tool blinked. He tapped it, and a brief message popped up on the text-display:
In the cockpit, Joker watched as EDI paged through a leather-bound book. “That book must be really interesting, EDI,” he quipped. “This has to be the third time you’ve read through it.”
The two stopped before K’a’l’s prison, and P’a’l put a hand on the forcefield, causing it to ripple. “This.” He pointed over to Gabriel’s left. “And that.” Gabriel looked, and saw a holographic painting of a city filled with dragon’s teeth. Every spike had a person on it, and hooded figures moved through the fields of spikes with objects in their hands while an enormous Reaper loomed overhead.
“How many did we--you lose?” Adileh asked quietly. “Izzy couldn’t bring herself to share that with me.”
Dean scratched his head. “So...it’s like having a lead weight in the back of a car in the wintertime? Keeps it on the road?”
The angel looked over from where he was laying on the bunk in his cell. He sat up and smiled when he saw Castiel standing there staring at him with arms crossed. “Hey.”
“Welcome, Gabriel Shepard,” a pleasant female voice intoned. “If you require assistance locating a certain item, please press the panel to your right, and a guide drone will activate.”
“You don't need to do anything,” a fluid voice said in her ear. “Just watch.” As Azrael watched, people started to gather. They took their phones out and started recording the officers, and two people stepped forward to challenge them. The officers started to bark at the onlookers, one of whom hurled a stone that clocked one officer square in the forehead. The small crowd rushed the police, who ran down the alley to get away from them as a young couple helped the homeless man to one of the tables on the cafe’s patio and tended to a cut on his forehead. “See? Justice--rough justice, sure. But still justice.”
A lavender-skinned asari put a tray on the counter with some plates of skewers and beckoned Dean to the counter. “Best place for pie in the ward is the Sucrophage, by the way. The head baker’s krogan, but don't let that stop you--his pastry is divine. Trust me, you’ll love it.” She winked. “Oh, and here are your skewers. Enjoy!”
me to remember everything that you’d “blocked off” from me. When were you actually going to tell us?”
Tali punched up a schematic of the dreadnought. “Bosh’tet! The geth have everything this console locked out and initiated a security lockdown. The only way to disable the signal is to get to the drive core, but we’d have to override the lockdown somehow--and then the fastest way to get there is through the main battery.”
“Yes.” Shepard fixed Dean with a stern look. “The three of you are a part of my crew now, which makes Castiel my responsibility--let me find him. EDI, you’re with me. Page Liara and have her meet us in the shuttle bay.” He turned and walked out of the cockpit, EDI in tow. Joker turned his seat around.
After a long pause, Udina’s voice was heard again.
“Liara, you’ll have to take half the students in one of the Cerberus shuttles.” Liara nodded, and Shepard looked over at Jack. “Let’s get you all out of here before Cerberus decides to come see what happened to their cruiser.”
Dean turned, smiling when he saw his friend was awake. “Hey, Cas.” He pulled up a chair and sat down next to him, then reached over to take his free hand in both of his. “You had me worried, buddy. How you feeling?”
The Marine officer blinked, then snapped to attention and saluted. “Lieutenant Benson! Sorry ma’am, I didn’t know you were in the head ma’am.” He looked down at the Lieutenant in front of him. “If you’re done, ma’am…”
“Dean is asleep. I didn’t want to disturb him--it would have annoyed the cat.” Castiel took a sip of coffee and stood with Garrus, who chuckled.
“We’re leaving,” the new arrival said over his shoulder, still walking toward the elevator. He was well-built, with deep-set dark blue-green eyes, thick short black hair, and a square jaw with a slight pout that made him look like he had an underbite.
I freely admit that I couldn't think of how to work an explanation of how the Reaper Trap worked into this chapter--that will be in a future chapter.
Gabriel nodded, a sad smile on his face. “I hope so.” He touched his forehead to hers for a moment before putting his gauntlet on again and taking a step back. “I have to go now,” he said, a sad smile on his face.
So why don’t you go running back to that pile of scrap an--”
Liara watched as the reply scrolled up the screen.
” the man commented, “fighting some big war. That’s why you were sent back.”
“I once swore I would never shed angelic blood, Kael. So much for my promises,” Israfel said, voice heavy with sadness. “See to Chief Faber’s remains, please. She didn’t have any family, so Steven won’t have to write a letter.” He rubbed his chin for a moment. “And I need to give my friend his body back so we can have a talk that I’d hoped would wait until the end of the War.”
“I really don’t know what to say,” Joker said when the group got to the cockpit. “It’s like...well, like the Hand of God came down and slapped Cerberus.” He pointed out the windows of the cockpit at the debris field. “There was a cruiser here, judging from the wreckage. But all that’s left now is pieces and a few trashed fighters. The Academy is untouched.” A wrecked fighter floated a few meters off the starboard side, its pilot still strapped into the cockpit.
“Roger that!” The brothers jumped out of cover and shot their way toward the manager’s office. Shepard, Kaidan, and Wrex laid down covering fire while Sam hacked the lock. The door opened, and the Winchesters ran inside to find a terrified Volus cowering behind a desk and a very pale and unconscious Castiel slumped over in a chair.
“Right here,” the group’s leader said. He was supporting a girl that bore close resemblance to him. The students behind him started murmuring excitedly among themselves. “That guy in the coat, he--”
“Izzy…” Gabriel said as the pair walked into the starry hallway that led to the Master Library. “It had to be done. I know, you told me that you swore to never shed angelic blood unless you absolutely had to--and it came down to letting Camael live, or letting a shitload of people die, many of them dying before they even got to see what was outside of their worlds.” He looked over and saw the angel’s crestfallen expression. “You made the right call," Gabriel said, his voice quiet and reassuring. "You kept your promise.”
“You may want to keep the biotics offline if you can,” Shepard said. “At least until after you’ve been had something more substantial than a couple of electrolyte IVs.” He scratched his head. “I need to go check on Kaidan before we head out to Tuchanka.” He turned to walk out of the room when Dean stood and put a hand on his arm.
Tali opened up her comms. “Tali’Zorah to Fleet--the Reaper signal is about to go offline.”
Heaven, now.”
A single text message pinged on the asari’s Omni-Tool:
The husk shifted to its knees and put its hands against the glass of its case for a moment. It sat back on its heels and clawed at one arm. Black ichor infused with eezo oozed from its skin, and the husk daubed the claws of its free hand in the wound, then started to draw a set of pictograms on the glass.
He was free again. Once more he was a wavelength of celestial intent, skipping through rivers of stellar dust at the speed of thought, unencumbered by the demands of a celestial bureaucracy that had long ago decided to ignore its divine mission. He no longer felt helpless, the way he did when Metatron stole his grace and cast him and the other angels out of Heaven. Indeed, he now felt like he could help his Father’s creations again--to do what He had asked of His eldest children before leaving them to watch over His creation.
Shepard nodded and watched as Earth and the Reapers came into view. The fleets lined up opposite each other as they closed in, two armies ready to clash for the survival of the galaxy. “Signo dato meo,” Shepard declared, his voice firm and defiant as it went over the comm to every ship and fighter in the Allied fleet, “emitte inferos.” The translation of the Commander’s order flickered up on every viewscreen and HUD in the fleet:
Israfel knelt in the Orizaba’s meditation area. “Father,” she quietly whispered. “I know you won’t reply, you have other things on your plate right now...This war has pulled us in a bunch of different directions. I hope that I remember what I’ve learned here, and…” the angel sighed deeply. “I hope that when the time comes, I can do what needs to be done.” She looked out the window at the stars and smiled slightly when she saw one twinkle. “I’ll do my best as always, Dad.” She put a hand on the window. “I'll see you soon.”
“You killed angels?” Sam asked.
” The woman smiled slightly. “Good to see you on this side,” she rasped. “I need you to find Sam, asap. He has something I need.” She closed her eyes again. "The circle of holy fire will protect me."
Azrael looked back to see a red-haired man wearing a pair of round-lensed gold-framed glasses smiling at her. “Not very big on mediation these days?” she asked. The man nodded back toward the street, and Azrael looked back to see the man--who had only one hand--standing up from the table to cross toward the office. “You’re shitting me. Seriously?”
Israfel sighed again, and Hannah saw the outline of Lt. Benson biting her lip. “He was right,” the angel replied. “I’m sorry.”
Azrael nodded and leaned over to kiss Sam on the forehead. “I’m honoured to be your companion, Sam. I just want you to know that.” The angel smiled and vanished.
the turian mouthed. Dean nodded, and the two of them trained their sniper rifles on him. On a three-count, they each stroked their triggers. Dean’s round hit in the center of mass to drop the Engineer’s shields, and Garrus administered the coup de grace by blowing the engineer’s head off with a fragmentation round.
“I know,” Shepard grumbled. “The salarian Councilor uncovered some shady dealings by Udina and called me to help get to the bottom of it.”
Sam crossed his arms as well. “Yeah, Shepard sure doesn’t seem to think much of you.”
“Umm…” the child was at a loss for words at the spread. “Do angels eat?” He looked quizzically at his hostess.
“Khalisah bint sinan Al-Jilani, Westerlund News,” Joker said between giggles. “I’m sorry, I just...I…”
“Oh, sorry Tali.” Shepard waved a hand toward the Normandy’s irregulars. “I’d like to introduce Sam and Dean Winchester, and Castiel.” The hunters each shook Tali’s hand in turn.
“Aye aye.” Joker’s voice was firm, determined. Shepard gave him a slight smile, and left the cockpit.
“Do you like it?” the strange woman asked.
“Why do you call me that?” The child raised an eyebrow.
Shepard turned away from the screen to face his squad. Garrus and Kaidan scanned the area for any more Cerberus interlopers, as Castiel stared down at the floor.
“It’s OK Cas,” Shepard said. “I’ll make sure they’re paid for them.” He patted Castiel on the shoulder. “In the meantime, let Doctor Chakwas finish her exam so you can get some sleep, since I’m sure you’re pretty tired. I promised Admiral Hackett and the Council a full report on you, Sam, and Dean, and they’ll want that medical data.”
“Somewhere near the base,” came the reply. Castiel paused his work, then looked up at the shuttle, squinting into the late-afternoon sun. “I don’t know exactly where--I retreated as soon as I could feel its presence. But if we can find the Reaper and lure it here, there’s a good chance that the Normandy can bombard it into scrap with help from the Quarians. The work would go much faster if you and Sam were able to help, by the way.”
“My god,” she said. “Your electrolytes are dangerously low,” she said. “Your blood sugar, too. And you’re...anemic?” Azrael nodded, and started to sway. Miranda reached out to steady him, and the angel took Miranda’s hand in both of his. He gave Miranda a gentle squeeze and a weak smile, then turned his gaze to Kaidan.
“I take it that Gerrel guy got into it with…?” Dean whispered to his brother. Sam nodded slowly. “Gotcha.”
“Exactly.” Israfel nodded. “I’m sure he’s managed to get hold of a datapad and read up on what I’ve been up to, but that doesn’t bother me overmuch--the message I brought was one for all of our people, even angels like him that we may not think are deserving of it. He knows all of the tricks that Dad dictated to him for the tablets, sure...but he’s just one angel and he’s only so creative. We work together and coordinate our efforts, we can stay a step ahead of him and take back our home.” She scratched her chin for a moment. “As a bonus, we can also get ahead of any threats that may come after.” Israfel looked at Bartholomew. “We’ve got most of a Consensus, brother. Malachi and Rebecca have been on board for a while now. Same with all of the unaligned angels--the non-aligned angels asked me to speak for them, which is the only reason I’m here. But to make a Consensus work we need you, too.”
"Hard to say. Sacrifice in war is expected. He did us proud, but... we're a hard bunch to please. Living your life for the cause, society first, platoon first. It's just all expected for a turian.” Garrus shook his head. “To say that Wrex will be upset about this, by the way, is an understatement.”
Sam’s expression darkened. He set his jaw and tensed, and he clenched his fists. Before he could act, the angel put up a hand and the force field turned bright orange. A gaggle of husks came loping around from where the elevator would be, and were incinerated by the field.
“Let’s move, people,” Shepard barked. “We have to get to the Council before Cerberus does!” He dropped down into the elevator and ran out into the corridor, with Liara and James right behind him, pursuing Kaidan’s retreating form.
Gabriel nodded. “Yes--I knew her as Rasa, but yeah, her.” The younger Shepard looked back at his brother and gave him a sad half-smile. “The both of us, we’re...you’ll find out things in the coming days--not all of it will be pleasant to hear, but…”
Team Free Will goes to Sur'Kesh, and meet everybody's Favourite Krogan Uncle.
“I know, but…Shit.” Israfel opened the door, and she and her son got on the lift to the Library floor. “You know, you sound--”
EDI stood up from the co-pilot’s seat and walked over to the group. “It is a pleasure to meet you,” she said with a smile, pleasantly shaking hands with each of them and curtseying. “If you need to speak with me, you may come up here to the cockpit or hail me from any part of the ship. Shepard, may I speak to you in private?”
KAIDAN: What you reading?
Dean’s eyes grew wide. He sprang excitedly from his seat and scampered over to the credenza to pick up the box and bring it back to the table. “You, my friend, are a prince among angels.” He opened the box and carefully took out a miniature pecan pie, garnished with a small pouf of whipped cream and a tiny sprig of mint. “Ohhh look at you, my luscious pecan-y beauty,” he cooed, holding the pie in both hands. Dean set the treat down on the table and gazed at it like a treasure hunter looking at a priceless relic, his green eyes twinkling in the light from the lamp over the table.
Kaidan’s voice cut in. “Uhhh….am I the only one who’s concerned that we have maybe an hour’s worth of air left?”
SHEPARD: Yeah. Professionally weird.
The woman took another sip from her tea. “You may not believe me if I tell you--but to answer your obvious question, no, this is not an Alliance holding facility. Not by even the remotest stretch of the imagination.” She let out a half-chuckle and looked at him. “You’re in Heaven. Alive, but still in Heaven.”
“Clear six o’clock.” Sam turned, and the brothers ran forward to vault the gap to the next terrace. A small trail of Cerberus bodies lay scattered in a side hallway. Troopers mostly, but two distinctly female bodies--one in a grey suit of armour and another in black--lay crumpled on the floor next to each other. “Looks like we’ve got some new players,” he said. Almost on cue, a bright red dot appeared on Sam's chest. Dean grabbed his brother and yanked him to the side just before a bullet went flying through the space where he had been standing. “Thanks,” Sam said.
DEAN: I swear to God….
Gabriel took a deep breath and glared at the soul in front of him. After several seconds, he shook off P’a’l’s grip, turned, and stalked back down the hall. “Just...leave me alone,” he said as he left. When he got to the lift, Gabriel ignored it and set off a biotic charge that launched him up to the door out of the Library. He stormed down the hallway to his apartments and stood in the middle of the living area, static still arcing over him. He clenched and unclenched his fists a few times as he tried to calm his rage at discovering his angelic parent’s secret, then turned and walked into the exercise room. He detonated his barrier with a cry of anguish, sending exercise equipment and practice dummies flying against the walls, then sank into a heap in the middle of the room. A jumble of emotions clashed inside him, and all that Gabriel Shepard found himself able to do in response was cry.
“You don’t look very happy to be here, Dean--I thought for sure you’d be trying to beat the Quasar tournament or betting on the varren races.” Garrus leaned in with his own drink in hand. “Worried about Cas?”
