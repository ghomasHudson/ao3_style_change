“I don’t like that fact that the only reason Cas is being hurt because he’s gay,” said Dean. Biting his lip, Dean made decision.  Looking down at his hands, so he couldn’t see the faces of his friends looking at him, he continued, “because in another place or another time, that could be me being bullied or beaten.”   Dean took a deep breath, “I mean, I’ve dated both.  Men and women.”
Cas sat back down, and looked at Sam intently.
“Improvising,” said Dean.   “Dad took all the weapons after last time, and I wouldn’t have time to go back for home for them anyway.”  Dean checked his watch.   He had 19 minutes before the deadline.
“We keep it quiet, because Cassie was technically still a minor, when he first came to live with me,” said Gabriel.  “I’m less worried now he’s 18, but I don’t plan on advertising what I do with the neighbours.”
Dean shook his head and stared up at the sky.  “You lot are morons.   I’ve had enough.   I’m going back inside.   I expect you gone in the next two minutes.   Or I’m calling the cops.”
“And you shot Gordon?”
It was very light, and Dean looked puzzled as the lifted he the flap at one end, and tipped the contents into his hand.   It looked like the two embarrassing necklaces they’d been given by the shop assistant at Topeka. He looked at Castiel confused.
Huge thanks to everyone for their comments and kudos.
“You wish,” said Dean with glee.  “Although I bet there’ll be someone in jail that will be happy to make you their bitch.”
They made it to breakfast a little after 9am.    The waiter, Ryan, from the previous evening was working and offered them ‘their’ table on the patio again.   They were both ravenous and quickly accepted the offer of a fully loaded plate of bacon and eggs, with toast, pastries, fresh fruit kebabs, coffee and orange juice.
Castiel took a deep breath and tried to calm himself.  “Everything I said about my parents was true.   I was an emancipated minor, at the age of 15.  I’ve been living with Gabriel since then.   But my grandparents died when I was five, and they left each grandchild a trust fund.  A large one.  But with the situation I was in, I was able to get certain access rights a bit earlier than normal.  Which annoyed my parents and most of my siblings even more.   There’s an independent lawyer that controls the fund. I cannot access any of the capital until I am 25.  I have a prior agreement for certain expenses, like medical, education, rent, food, and clothing which as long as I stick too, there are no issues.  I also get a small general spending allowance for day to day stuff.    If I need something out of the ordinary, I can apply to the lawyer for specific approval.  I can’t go and buy a Tesla, but as long as I can demonstrate that the cost is reasonable, and not for drink or drugs, he signs it off.”
Gabriel returned to the lounge about ten minutes later.   “He’s already asleep.”  Gabriel offered out his hand to Dean to shake, and Dean took it slightly confused.  He was instantly pulled into a hug, “Thank you,” said Gabriel with heartfelt appreciation.  “I don’t know what would have happened to him if you guys hadn’t been there.”
“Shut up Benny,” said Dean uncomfortably.
“OK, remove your jacket, and lift that shirt of yours,” said Alistair.
“Now we’ve cleared that up, I think we have some unfinished business we need to discuss back in our room.”  Dean stood up and pulled Castiel to his feet.

“The bright sneakers.”
Dean was everything and more that Castiel had ever remotely thought sex could feel like.   He was warm and welcoming, and so tight around him, that all Castiel wanted to do was stay there being held by Dean forever.
“What the hell were you doing?” Castiel hissed angrily.   “Are you trying to get yourself killed?  They won’t treat you kindly if you spend time with me.”
When their exam results had come through, Castiel had received the grades he needed, and had accepted his place at Berkeley.   It had taken Castiel less than 30 seconds for him to ask Dean to come with him.
"Dean?" he queried, his deep gravelly voice bouncing around the room. "You prayed to me," he stated simply.
Humming gently as he washed his hair, Castiel felt relaxed and loose in a way he wasn’t sure he’d ever experienced. It had been a very long time since he’d felt a spark of attraction to someone like he had for Dean, and even longer since he’d had intercourse. Being with Dean had felt amazing even without knotting, but it was the feeling of caring for someone else that was making him smile. Realistically he knew it was crazy; Dean was a complete stranger. He knew almost nothing about the man, not even his full name.
Smiling, Castiel lay down in the middle of the bed, as instructed.  His cock bobbing as moved.  He watched as Dean walked to the end of the bed and stood there regarding him contemplatively.   Castiel found it strangely erotic that he was lying naked, and yet Dean was fully clothed.
Dean realised then that they weren't really grown men, they were late teens, like himself, probably they knew Castiel from school.   "Leave him alone, or I'll make you."
Dean’s phone pinged.  “Hang on Gabe, I’ve just got a text.”  He glanced at the screen, “it’s from Cas.” He said with relief.  “Stay on the line.”   Dean swiped the message to open it.
Missouri pulled the curtain around Dean’s bed, for privacy, as Dean kicked off his blankets. “Hmm,” she muttered as she checked him over. “You’re doing well. But I think things are going to move fast soon. I want to get you into a delivery room, and get you hooked up on a monitor.”
Sam started talking as soon as they had pulled out of Gabriel’s drive.  “What was all that about?  What didn’t Cas want me to know?”
“You can come through,” said the nurse.
“How would you feel about switching up the duds a bit?  Maybe wear a pair of jeans instead of that tracksuit?  I don’t think I’ve seen you out of school uniform, and technically you aren’t even obliged to wear that, now that you’re a senior.”
At the first touch of his mouth to his cock, Cas seemed to become a molten mess. He head rolled back, and found himself clutching at the blanket beneath him. "Dean!" he screamed loudly into the night air, and followed this with a verbal torrent of what to Dean sounded like Enochian.
Dean choked, “Fuck Angel, how the hell do you go from blushing virgin one minute to man-whore the next?”
“I want you,” said Castiel kissing down Dean’s neck. “I want you to teach me what you know.”
Stay safe everyone.
Very slowly and very deliberately, Dean moved his legs to make space for Castiel between them.  He let his knees bend and fall open, as Castiel knelt between them.  Looking at up Dean, Castiel gave a reassuring smile, “You’re stunning.”
Sheriff Mills walked Dean back up to the cabin, leaving Deputy Hanscum with Alistair.   It didn’t take them long following the main road, the glowing remains of the cabin’s burnt out shell lighting their way.   Dean nodded acknowledgement to Benny and Lee who were waiting with the officers, and Sheriff Mills instructed one of the officers to take a car down the road to pick up Alistair and Deputy Hanscum.
Sam appeared about 20 minutes later. Dean was very pleased to see him, and tears sprung to his eyes, as Sam reached for his hand.
This is a short chapter, so I thought I would share it today.  There will be a longer chapter tomorrow.
“I didn’t share what you told me, Cas” said Dean explaining.  “I didn’t think you’d want me to.”
“You did everything you could, I know you did,” said Castiel sadly.  “I’m glad neither you or Sam were hurt.  I wouldn’t have wanted you, either of you, hurt because of me.”
Benny and Lee were horrified when they first caught sight of Castiel.  Dean had told them about the attack but seeing the damage first-hand had shocked them both.
Castiel finally added a fourth finger, and rotated his hand finding Dean’s prostate.   At the gentle touch Dean practically howled, throwing his head back into the pillow heavily.   Castiel had stopped touching Dean’s cock after adding his second finger, not wanting to bring on his orgasm too quickly, but Castiel could see copious amounts of precum dribbling from the tip.  “Are you ready Dean?” said Castiel his voice punching through Dean’s pleasure induced brain fog.
“He had it coming,” said Alistair.
“Castiel?” queried Charlie back after a pause. “Are you sure?”
Lee Webb was also friends with Benny and was happy to include Dean in their friendship circle.  Lee was slightly shorter than Dean, had longer hair that he would flip back constantly and was seriously into music.  Lee was more outgoing than Benny, but the three of them made a good group.
Castiel raised his eyebrow, and then winced in pain as it pulled on a bruise. “OK.”
“So buddy, gonna tell me what’s going on in that brain of yours?” John finally asked.
Dean sat quietly next to Castiel.  He answered any question put to him, but it was clear that his mind was elsewhere.  Castiel kept his leg firmly against Dean’s, providing a solid presence for Dean to latch onto.   Once they’d been through the full story, and everyone’s involvement at the trail head was explained, everyone had questions.
Dean let Castiel guide him.   He tuned out any consideration for the weird situation of actually dancing with Castiel, and just for a moment enjoyed the feeling of dancing with someone.
Castiel nodded, and briefly closed his eyes again, before jerking back awake.  “Yeah.  Sorry, I guess the meds again.   I get sleepy.”
Dean smiled at that line.   More than once Dean had thought Castiel had smelt of the fresh outdoors, all ozone and crispness after a strong rainstorm.
“Fuck you,” said Alistair to Dean.
“Cassie. You’re my brother and I love you. But putting that to one side,” said Gabriel. “I’ve worked with you all through your training, and, if you will accept my job offer, I’ll be your boss – several times removed. I know you. I know what your colleagues think of you. I’ve seen your appraisals and references. You are an excellent doctor. But unless you’re dealing with a child, you can come across as cold, unapproachable, inhuman and unsympathetic. So, trust me when I tell you, showing some compassion or some kind of emotion is not a bad thing. In fact, it might make your patients and colleagues like you a little better.”
“We both knew our paths were going to diverge,” said Castiel staring out the window.  “But the things we’ve shared in these few short months, and even in the last 24 hours, no one can take that away from us.   Our future may be challenging and difficult, but I don’t see that as an impediment, considering what we have already been through.”
There was another pause from Castiel, before he finally breathed out a very quiet, “yes Dean.”
“Go around the back, and make sure they don’t try getting out the windows,” said Alistair to one of the boys.
“And?” said Sam.  He seemed confused.
“Cas, you better know now.  I have a filthy mind, and dirty mouth, and I want to use it on you.”  Dean nuzzled his neck, “I want to hear you moaning, and sighing, and begging, and screaming my name.  I want to know you like what we’re doing, and that I am the cause of it.”  From his position behind Castiel, Dean slid his hand down, stroking Castiel’s firm abs.   He paused as he reached Castiel’s groin, stopping just shy of touching his cock, and Castiel gasped slightly.  “May I touch you?” he asked softly.
The conversation was interrupted however, when a tall stern looking man walked into the cubical like he owned the place and stood imposingly at the end of the bed.
“Is everything alright,” Jess asked.
Sighing, Dean left his position at the door, and approached him.  “Oh for goodness sake.  Come here,” Dean said, before he could change his mind.
TW: Illness and Death in this chapter.  Please look after yourselves.
“We don’t want to impose,” said Dean.   “We just wanted to see how Cas was doing.”
While the jets massaged his back and legs, Dean looked over to see Castiel watching him.   “Most motels I’ve been at never had anything like this. The main consideration was nearly always cost, not amenities,” said Dean, relaxing.  “This is something else.”
Oh yes, and I used Google Translate for the Latin.   Brackets are the translations for ease.
“Wow, is that really the best you got Alistair?” said Dean, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Cause I gotta say, it’s pretty weak for a guy that looks like he can’t lift a five kilo dumbbell.   Or perhaps that’s the issue, you tried, but it fell on your head.”
“Yes Sir,” said Dean.  He’d automatically reached for Castiel’s hand after dealing with the weapons, and seemed surprised to find he still holding on to it.  “I’m good to drive though.”
Dean nodded and mentally saved the image of Castiel bending over like that for another time.   Pulling himself together Dean indicated the mats, to Castiel and Sam.   “OK.  I don’t want to do any throws or anything that might hurt your ribs again.  We’ll concentrate on some close quarter stuff.   Sammy go easy on him.”
“Whoa, wait,” said Castiel hurriedly.  “Castiel.  I’m Castiel.  I’m babysitting Sam.”
Glancing at Castiel, Dean blushed. “Yeah. I’m good.”
Thanks again to breezeranger for her beta skills, and suggestions.
love.”
They had both been too caught up in concentrating on the drive last night, trying not to have an accident to attempt to make conversation in the car, and then other events had driven thoughts of, well, anything else, from their minds. His Omega had needed caring for. Suddenly he realised he’d even said ‘my Omega’ to Dean. He’d never said that to a sexual partner before. He should speak to Dean about it. Perhaps, they could stop in town and have a proper breakfast together, and talk, maybe learn a little more about each other. Maybe he should encourage Dean to see his own Doctor, it was clear that Dean was unwell and it was affecting his scent. Yes, he’d take Dean to breakfast first, and hopefully they could talk about what might happen next between them.

Checking his mirrors to ensure the coast was clear, Dean slowed the car as much as possible, without coming to a complete stand still.  Benny jumped out, slammed the door and rolled off into the vegetation on the side of the road.  Dean applied the gas, and within another minute found the turning for the trail head on the left.  The area was little more than a single track about 50 yards long that lead to a small, currently empty, gravel strewn area that acted as a small car park.   He sighed in relief as he discovered he was the first one there, and after quickly assessing the area, he parked the Impala in such a way that he could still exit using the track, but the most likely spot for another vehicle to park would mean that it would be closer to the tree line.   Dean’s hope was that it would mean Alistair would have his back to the trees and give Benny a better chance of maintaining cover.
Huffing a little in mock protest, Dean sassed, “I don’t begrudge it. But it seems like Jack’s getting more of your attention than me.”
"You are well aware it would take a lot more than a single bottle of scotch to affect me to the same degree that it affects you."
“Good for you Sam,” said Gabriel enthusiastically. He returned to looking at Castiel.   “So, bed baby bro, what’s it gonna be.   Sofa or the Playroom?”
“Stay here,” said Castiel. “I will see if they have rooms.”
It was done innocently enough, but it sent a spike of arousal straight to Dean’s groin as Castiel fed him from his plate.  The steak was incredible, just as Castiel had said, melting in the mouth.
After being buzzed in, and logged in at the reception desk, Dean and Sam were quickly taken into a side room for assessment where a nurse was waiting.
Supernatural – Supernatural - Supernatural – Supernatural - Supernatural – Supernatural
With his mouth full of lasagne, Castiel nodded.
“Bite me,” responded Castiel to Benny with a raised eyebrow, and a small smile.
“You guys are amazing,” said Castiel impressed. “Did your Dad teach you?”
Cas stared at his brother.  "You did what?"
Dean sighed. "OK. OK. Calling you Cas that moment, just seemed wrong. What you were doing was too big, too good to not use your God given name. And I can't believe I just said that. But look, it just felt right. I'm not sorry though, and I can't promise I won't use it again."
"Epic." Cas finally concluded.
“Gabriel,” warned Castiel.  “No joking about this.   Last thing I need is some assbutt at school to think I’m ‘advertising’ myself.”
As they headed out of the room, Dean offered Castiel his copy of Rebecca back.   “Keep it,” said Castiel quietly.   “I have another.”
“Definitely some of it is OK,” Gabriel sorted through and selected a couple of plain platted leather bracelets, and a couple of plain silver ones.   “Unless you decide to get these engraved with Daddy or Sweet Boy, you should be OK.”
“Sorry Lisa.  I didn’t understand that bit about Entropy and Equilibrium, and I hoped Cas would explain it,” said Dean waving Castiel’s book.  “I’ll catch you later.”
“Yeah,” John said.   “He’s running a team building and survival training camp for rich city types.   He asked if I would come down and help out.  He says they tip well.”
Dean whimpered slightly, feeling both the loss of Cas’s presence and also the discomfort from in moving his now aching lower body.
Dean sat on one of the sofas, sipped his water and grinned.   “I think Noah liked you.”
“So, are you going to wear your new stuff to school on Monday?” said Dean.
Castiel still had some concerns about Sam agreeing to everything, but he did share that Dean had said he wanted to move in with Castiel, and promised to bring Dean and Jack to the first available Saturday dinner, when Jack was released from hospital.
Dean held him close and kissed him back.   “I can’t say it like you, but know I mean it.   I love you too.”
Strippers exposed far more flesh than Castiel was currently showing, and Dean hadn’t felt affected by them, as much as he was affected by this.  Dean felt his heart beat speed up, his mouth go dry and he was fairly sure several pints of blood had rushed southwards, causing an uncomfortable tightness in his jeans.
“I was going to order food.  Chinese OK?” said Gabriel.
The last two scan’s had been duly reported to Crowley and logged with the court. They hadn’t revealed anything they didn’t already know. Jack was still ‘small for his dates’, but apart from that seemed to be healthy.
"Don't worry, I got wipes," said Dean reaching for the picnic basket.
“You have me, Dean.  Always,” said Castiel reaching for him.
Castiel turned swiftly, ignoring the rapidly cooling mess in his boxers, and kissed Dean passionately.  “You were wonderful,” he stated firmly, leaving no room for an argument.  “There aren’t enough words for how happy I am.  How happy you made me.”
“Image?”
Dean knew he could ill afford a room, but he was just too tired to argue. Dean just nodded and watched as Castiel exited the car, jogged to the porch area and rang the doorbell.
As though hypnotised Dean felt himself walking towards the messy overstocked rack.   Dean stared at the magazine, his jaw dropping as he looked at the picture on the front cover.  “No way,” he breathed.   That was Cas.  His Cas.  Nothing but a towel hiding his modesty.  Special edition proclaimed the front cover.  Hands trembling, he reached for the copy - how could he not?
“Sneaky,” said Castiel impressed.   “Given you didn’t have my voice for a response to you, how did you convince them I was there.”
“Yeah.  OK. Thanks Cas,” said Sam distractedly, and went to the bathroom.
Sam and Castiel had spent the first hour or so going through Sam’s homework.   Before trying to jointly translate a book in Latin that Sam had borrowed from his uncle.   After discovering several references to exorcisms and demons, Castiel had declined to handle the book any further.
Cas was well aware of everything he was doing to Dean, he could feel every shudder and tremor as Cas worshipped him. His own pleasure felt secondary to him, compared to ensuring Dean felt good. But one look at Dean’s face, his cheeks tinged with pink, his lips swollen and plump from their earlier kisses, his green eyes staring into Cas’s blue ones begging without words, and Cas’s resolve shattered.
"Aw shucks," laughed Dean. "You say the nicest things."
Squinting at him, Sam looked Dean up and down. “How are you so calm?”
“Come here,” said Dean dragging Castiel closer.
Picking up the first gun, Dean expertly assessed it.   Confirming the safety was on, he released the magazine and checked it, cleared the gun removing the bullet from the chamber, checked the slide was free and moved easily, and knowing it was empty, pointed it at the wall and pulled the trigger to get the feel for it.  He quickly reloaded the gun and pocketed the ammunition and extra clip, comfortably slipping the gun into his jeans at the small of his back.     He then repeated the process for the second gun, grunting in satisfaction.  He placed the second one in his jacket pocket.      The whole process had taken less than two minutes.
Dean stepped forward, invading Castiel’s personal space, pushing him back until he bumped against the table.   He placed his hands on Castiel’s hips to anchor himself for a moment, and then pushed his entire body against Castiel, before sliding both arms around his waist in a hug, holding him tightly.  Burying his head into the crook of Castiel’s neck, he whispered, “I was an idiot.”
Castiel held out his hand and Dean willingly grasped it, allowing himself to be pulled back to the bed.   All doubts were cast aside as he raised Castiel’s hand to his lips and kissed the palm, then the wrist, before continuing the kisses back up to Castiel’s face.
As Castiel stretched, his back and shoulder muscles flexed under his shirt, and it pulled up a fraction, causing the hem to slip free from its securely tucked in status, and allowing a sliver of taught flesh to be flashed to anyone who might be watching.   And Dean was watching.  Watching as the seams of the shirt were abused across Castiel’s shoulders, the already tight trousers across Castiel’s backside seemed to become a second skin, and the legs of his trousers tighten as his thighs tensed and worked to keep his balance.
“Hello Angel,” said Dean with a grin.  The use of Castiel’s ASL name seemed strangely natural.   He reached out and pulled Castiel into a tight hug.  “You OK?”
Rising again to stand, he said, “Climb in Cas,” and offered his hand to steady Castiel as he stepped into the warm water.     Dean waited until Castiel had settled, before dropping the towel and stepping in himself.    Dean noticed Castiel glancing at his naked body, but neither said anything.   They leaned back against each end of the tub, resting their heads on the inbuilt pillows facing each other.
“Anything to eat with that?” asked Castiel.
Dean lent gently on the door frame smiling as he watched Castiel shuffle his feet slightly, his arms slightly raised, as though he was performing a waltz.
"I understand, Sam," said Castiel meeting the younger mans eyes, and understanding the depth of sincerity there.  "You and Gabriel both."
“Dean!”
With Jack resting his head on one side, and Dean resting his head on the other, their hands inter-linked and positioned over Castiel’s heart, Castiel felt complete.
“Here, let me walk you out,” said Dean to Castiel, and followed them both out the door.
“Oh wow that feels good,” said Dean blissfully closing his eyes to enjoy the sensation.
Dean dropped his head; how was he going to explain this.
Castiel studied him some more.  There was a kind of recklessness about him.   He played without inhibition, happily moving his feet and hips in time to the music, the smile never wavering despite him singing along to the music. He nodded politely to anyone that threw a coin in his open guitar case.  “I think it’s his attitude,” said Castiel watching him. “He seems to be happy, a free spirit.   He’s doing something that makes him happy, without caring about the audience.”
Henriksen nodded.   “Are you familiar with the book?  Or perhaps one of the many films.”
“Oh yes,” she said reassuringly. “It’s just Jack’s circulation system getting up to speed.”
“Very impressive,” said Zar.  “Do you have any idea what you intend to do with your degree afterwards?”
Dean nodded, “That sounds great.”
Dean invited Castiel around to their place for dinner and a movie on Thursday, which he accepted.   At Castiel’s insistence, they picked him up from the library car park, which was much quieter, and was away from the stares of the other students.
Knowing that Castiel would do his usual vanishing trick at the end of the lesson, Dean deliberately picked up Castiel’s physics book, so he couldn’t leave without it.
“As you’re staying, I can put it on your room, and you can settle up when you leave, if you prefer.”
Wandering through the kitchen, then to the bedroom corridor, he paused as he saw Castiel’s jacket lying on the floor in the corridor.   Slightly further down was Dean’s plaid shirt.   He was about to retrieve it when he heard a deep muffled voice from Dean’s room moaning Dean’s name.
Whatever response Dean was about to make was silenced by a knock on the door. “Only me,” said Ma, as Castiel opened the door.	 She had a large tray that she placed down on the largest surface available, the chest of drawers. “As promised. Hot chocolate, cookies and some sandwiches. I hope ham and cheese is OK.” She smiled happily at Dean, oblivious to the tension in the room. “Your lovely Alpha explained you would both be leaving early and has already settled up. There will be a breakfast bag to go on the hall table. You can take it on your way out. Just let me know if you need anything further tonight. I’ll be right downstairs.” She looked at both of them and sighed, “Oh to be young and in love again. You know, I shouldn’t say, but you do make a lovely couple.” She patted Castiel kindly on the chest on her way back out the door.
Dean glanced at him.  He felt there was an undercurrent to Gabriel’s words.  “I understand.”    He hoped Gabriel picked up his intent.
Castiel moved to face Dean, and pushed him gently against the fence post, pressing their entire bodies together, chest to chest.  Dean gasped as he felt Castiel’s groin against his.  Castiel was already hard, and it felt so good against Dean’s own erection, that Dean couldn’t help but moan as Castiel pulled him in by the belt loops on his jeans, to increase the pressure.
“But that is how the babysitter asked the Pizza man.”
"But you might want to save it for later," said Cas easily. "For after dinner."
Gabriel looked over at John and raised the bottle in salute.   “You’ve raised a couple of fine boys.”
“Have at it,” said Dean easily.
“Um…. We brought Cas some Gatorade and grapes,” said Sam handing Gabriel a bag.
“How about getting me a large whisky,” said Dean. “I feel the need about now.”
“Have you seen Cas this morning?” said Dean to Benny as he took his seat.   Castiel’s desk was conspicuously empty.
Castiel sighed, “Don’t laugh.  But do you know the character Constantine?”
“Fuckers,” cursed Dean under his breath.   Suddenly the name calling, the slur, and Castiel’s reserved behaviour made sense.   “Are you out?” he asked quietly, not wanting anyone else to hear.
“Hey sport,” Gabriel said happily to Sam.  “Dean-o, good to see you.”
Castiel had repeatedly shown how much he loved the Winchester’s.   Proven by the level of trust he placed in them no matter how many times Dean screwed up.
Laughing slightly, Dean finally reached Castiel’s mouth, and brushed the pad of his thumb over Castiel’s bottom lip.   “Bossy!”   Dean lowered his face and nipped carefully at Castiel’s lip, before carefully exploring his mouth.   Castiel’s hand found its way to the back of Dean’s head, and held him there, as Castiel tried to rut against Dean.   “Ah ah ah Angel,” rebuked Dean, pulling away.
“Just get out here,” said Dean impatiently.   “Let’s take a look.”
“Thank you.   I had help.”  There was a glint of humour in Castiel’s eyes.   “Gabriel called in a favour from one of the hairstylists in his employment.”
Castiel wanted to pull Dean into his arms, but with his hands already full of Jack, he contented himself with just being in his presence. “I suppose we should talk about the future.”
“Love you my Omega, my Dean,” said Castiel, feeling Dean lose himself in the pleasure.
Dean was unsure, “I’m not sure he’ll go for it.  He’s incredibly concerned about anyone getting close to him getting hurt.”
Dean kissed his shoulder. “Thank you for letting me do that for you,” said Dean.    “Here, let me clean you up.”
Castiel blushed and nodded mutely.
“What part of ‘fuck me’ was unclear?”
“It’s good.  Just need a second.”    Taking several deep breaths, Dean relaxed, and allowed his body to adjust.
“And,” prompted Castiel.
Following Missouri’s instructions, Dean rolled on his side facing Sam, who had returned to hold his hand. Dean couldn’t see the monitor, but he knew his heartbeat had jumped considerably.
Dean was completely unprepared for the boy to physically flinch and step back, almost falling over his chair.  He heard several of the other students laughing as the room emptied.
Suddenly there was a warm comforting arm around him, and Castiel was right there. Dean knew that he shouldn’t be doing this. He shouldn’t be crying on some random stranger, and an Alpha at that. But, in what had been months of constant stress, the kindness of strangers had wrecked him. Castiel was right there when no one else was. Right now, to Dean, Castiel seemed to be a tiny bit of light in a vast galaxy of darkness. He wasn’t sure why he felt so safe with the Alpha. There was something reassuring about Castiel, just holding him without saying a word. Safe. Yes, that was it. Dean felt safe and supported. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt like that. Still sobbing Dean’s hands tightened on Castiel’s jacket, and he buried his head in the crook of Castiel’s neck.
“Mostly,” said Sam.  “But Dad had a friend Rufus, who was an ex SEAL.  He taught us quite a bit one summer.”
“Do you think Alistair was driving?”
Dean kissed and nipped at Castiel’s neck, as he reached down sliding his fingers through the soft hair of Castiel’s groin, and took a grip of Castiel’s cock at the base.  He didn’t move initially, just gently holding it, until he felt it begin to swell in his hand.  “Do you like that?”
Cas jumped slightly at Dean’s words, and tipped his head on one side studying him, as though confused.   “I injure you, and you want to buy me coffee?” he clarified.
Sheriff Mills sighed, “I wasn’t surprised to hear you didn’t trust the Chief down in Lawrence. I’d heard a few rumours that made me uneasy.  When Lee came to my office to explain, well, I couldn’t leave you boys to do this alone, on the off chance that your crazy plan worked.  I’m glad I listened to my gut.”
Laughing Gabriel pulled the truck into the driveway of his house. “Come on. Ro can’t wait to see you again.”
“I wanted Alistair and his goons to think that I had you in the cabin with me.  But I knew I might have to wait a while for them to show up.   I didn’t want to pretend to talk to you for hours, so, I made a recording,” said Dean.  “It actually only lasted about 30 minutes, but I kept it playing on my phone on repeat.   I started it playing around 9pm and only stopped it when Alistair knocked on the door.  Benny said it drove him nuts listening to it repeatedly.”
Thank you for reading. All feedback appreciated. Even just a full stop to let me know someone read and enjoyed it.
Benny and Lee continued walking and talking about inconsequential things, until they reached the corner of the field before walking back along the far side.  Benny was able to cast a couple of glances back to the storage sheds, and saw Alistair and Gordon walking back to school with a couple of their friends.
Dean smiled as Castiel “waltzed” him around the library.
“That is an understatement.” said Castiel.  He took a deep breath.   “My parents are, at best, religious fanatics.   They did not take having a gay son well.   I have four older brothers, Michael, Luc, Uriel and Gabriel, and a younger sister, Anna.  One day, I was at some Church Festival and I met a boy from a visiting church.   Luc saw me kissing him, it was the first time I had ever kissed anyone, and he outed me to our parents and the whole congregation.  They all demanded answers, and having been brought up not to lie, I admitted to it.   The church elders decided to perform an exorcism,” he noticed Dean’s shocked reaction.  “Yeah, like that works.   Then they started talking about conversion therapy and sending me away to some commune somewhere remote.”
Castiel reach down between them and took Dean’s cock in his hand.  “Любить тебя – это как дышать… я просто не могу остановиться.”      (**Loving you is like breathing… I just can’t stop.)
“I fell asleep at Cas’s,” confessed Dean.
“I will.   Look at me Angel.”  Dean had already toed off his socks, and slowly crossed his arms grasping his T-shirt and pulled it off in a one fluid motion.  Castiel couldn’t tear his gaze away from Dean’s hands, as he unbuttoned his fly slowly, before slowly lowering his jeans and boxers, kicking them off.  Once he was naked, Dean knelt at the end of the bed, and then unhurriedly crawled up Castiel’s body, placing random kisses as he went.  When Dean’s face was level with Castiel’s crotch, he grinned wickedly, placed a delicate kiss on the head of his cock, and then continued his slow progress up to Castiel.   “Do you know how gorgeous you are?” Dean said hoarsely, planting more kisses on Castiel’s chest.
Dean nodded and left his room, grabbing his dressing gown as he went. He padded to the toilet facilities and afterwards stopped to look in the mirror as he passed. He felt different and looked different. Lighter, brighter and happier. He looked at his face and was surprised to see his reflection smile at him. He looked again, checking for signs of something else in the mirror, something supernatural, but then he realised it was just his reflection and he was actually smiling.
Zar described how he managed to be overheard by the professor, discussing with another student the best spots around the university for an assignation under the teachers noses, and how the dining hall storage room was the best place because of the abundance of table cloths for ‘cushioning’.  But he specifically let slip that he was planning on rendezvous there at 5pm.
After a long, stunned silence, Castiel drew in a deep breath and pulled back slightly to look into Dean’s eyes.  “Have you been touching the cursed objects in storeroom 13?” he finally asked.
“I can deal with bullies Dad,” protested Dean.
“The Impala is yours.  You’ve always looked after her like she was your baby.  Now she is.  It’s time for you to do your thing now, Dean.  Not mine.  Your future lies elsewhere.”
“Don’t say it like you don’t like it,” teased Dean.
“Do you have a language kink?” said Castiel mischievously.
“Yeah?”
Dean turned at the sound of the voice.  Despite the incredible low volume, Novak’s voice sounded remarkably deep for such a young man.   Dean couldn’t decide if it sounded more like he’d gargled with gravel or had spent several hours yelling himself hoarse.
A short five-minute walk from the campus was a small coffee shop.  Castiel had made Dean walk behind him the whole way there.  Relaxing only when they were inside the shop.   It was obviously a favourite haunt of Castiel’s as he was greeted by name as soon as he walked in.
"May I kiss you again?" asked Cas.
“Gabe said he wasn’t involved.  Cas just lives there,” said Dean firmly, shutting down that enquiry.
Shaking his head, Dean waved a hand over the jewellery items.   “Is any of this stuff not advertising a sexual kink?”
They met Gabriel in the driveway at the house.   Gabriel was on his way out to a business meeting with a film distributor and was already running late.   Gabriel jumped into his little Prius, lollipop hanging from his lips, shouted a “be safe” at them, and sped off.  Dean was slightly pleased that Gabriel wouldn’t be around to laugh at Castiel as he was practising.  Learning a new skill took time, and often it didn’t always look that great in the beginning.  Dean hoped that Castiel would have at least a couple of moves to show off when Gabriel got back.
I love hearing your thoughts and theories about what will happen.  I'm not changing anything based on comments, so speculate away, and you can all see how clever you were at the end.
Castiel huff a laugh at the pun.
“Hmmmm,” responded Dean, he was only half listening, his brain was taken up with the wonderful feeling of Castiel kneading his leg.
Castiel smiled, appreciating Dean’s honesty.  “But I would imagine you’ve seen a lot of different places.”
“Thank you, kind sir,” said Castiel.
“I don’t understand that reference,” said Castiel, looking confused.
Copying his father, Dean drank the rest of his whisky in one go and put the glasses into the sink.   His father was leaving again tomorrow for Texas.   John had already explained he’d be back next Saturday by lunchtime, would be dropping the truck off in Lawrence, at Matty’s request, and they would be heading back to Texas immediately in the Impala.  That gave Dean only 6 more days with Castiel. His fingers reached for the tag around his neck and he smiled sadly.  It just wasn’t enough time.
“Not sure where to start.   On any given day and all at once, I am pretty sure Dean-o could take all the spots in the Fuck, Marry or Kill trifecta,” said Gabriel.
Dean knew something had changed.   He felt Castiel mentally and physically pulling back from him.    He reached out quickly, and grabbed Castiel’s wrist before Castiel could move away.
Dean threw it into the ditch behind him.
The tension between them released and they relaxed back into each other’s company for the journey home.
“He left me a note. He asked me not to look for him.”
Then just as suddenly he could feel that moment when the pressure eased, Dean released his grip on Castiel’s thighs and instead reached out to touch Castiel’s hands where they rested on his own hips, “Move Cas.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll leave her here for you while I’m gone,” John reassured.  “Matty’s sending a guy up to get me and pick up our gear.   He’s loaning me a jeep for the summer, he wants me there every other week for the duration.  I’ll be leaving Sunday morning, be away for a week, then back again.”
After an hour of cleaning, Dean felt that Jack’s room was as ready as it would ever be, and he wandered to his kitchen for a drink of water. Grabbing a bottle from the fridge, he grimaced as he saw that a ring of sticky something was marking the shelf on the door. Sighing, he made quick work of emptying the fridge and washing everything down with sterilising cleaner, before putting everything back neatly.
“How about you Dean, any plans?” asked Kali.
“I’m not sure I’d know what do if I ever met someone I’d seen in porn in real life. I can’t quite imagine saying, ‘oh you look familiar, weren’t you the pizza man’?”
“That generally happens next,” said Dean biting Castiel’s ear lobe.
Jesse was a member of the football team with Benny.  During class, and within earshot of Castiel, Jesse suddenly asked, “Hey Benny.  You got any idea how much a hooker charges for a blow job?”
Thank you every for your lovely comments and suggestions.   Huge hugs to everyone.
There was no answer from inside the little cabin, and Alistair gave a small shrug as he flipped a cheap plastic lighter and threw it on the ground in the middle of the petrol.   The fumes caught immediately, and soon the whole cabin was ablaze.
Castiel broke off from the attention he was paying, looked up at Dean and growled at him, “Let’s save that for another time too.”
Cas nodded, and groaned loudly in pain as Dean and Sam hoisted him upright.  His back and stomach felt like they were on fire.    He sagged against the car weakly, Dean holding his upper arm and hand to ensure he didn't fall.
“When Alistair came at me, he thought I was unarmed.   But I’d hidden a knife in the gravel.   When I kneeled, I grabbed the knife and threw at Azzer, to stop him chasing Cas.  Alistair kept coming, I grabbed the gun after that,” explained Dean.
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
“Yeah, I do,” said Dean quietly. “Cas gave me the chance to choose, and I want to choose him.  I know it's a crazy situation, but Cas is my True Mate.”
“Can I see him?” tears leaked from Dean’s eyes.
Dean quickly peed, gave his lower regions a wash and his mouth a quick rinse with mouth wash.   When he’d finished his ablutions, he slipped on his pyjama pants and returned the bedroom to a tousled haired Castiel stretching his arms and legs, as he lay in bed.   Turning to face Dean, he smiled, “Hello Dean.”  Castiel’s morning voice was deep and gravelly.
"Dean, I understand," said Cas simply. "I am not unhappy, or in rush."
By the time Benny had made it to the corridor, Castiel was nowhere in sight.   Benny was just about to go to the cafeteria to tell Dean he’d lost Castiel, when Dean and Lee appeared from the other end of the corridor.  Dean looked incensed, and Lee was trying to calm him down.
After checking with Sheriff Mills about the time she wanted them at her police station for statements, Dean texted Benny and Lee the following morning, they had to be there by noon.  John agreed to drive the three of them, leaving Sam back at the trailer.
“I’d say that is very likely,” said Benny.  “That means who ever has him is mobile.  Harder to track.”  Zooming out, Benny looked at the photo overall, “Is it me or is Cas doing something odd with his hands?” Benny handed him back the phone.
Castiel nodded and mumbled.
“I’m trying to keep it together for Jack.  Getting stressed won’t help him,” said Dean.
Eyeing him suspiciously, Castiel indicated the vast array of cookies, cakes and pies in the display case.   “Are you sure, because the apple pie here is to die for.”
Dean had tried getting details of Castiel’s plan from him, but Castiel refused to budge.  The only detail he’d given was that Dean should pack an overnight bag and be at Gabriel’s house by 6pm.
Eyes going wide, Dean’s jaw dropped open for the second time that day.   “No way.”
Castiel knelt so he was eye level with Dean. “Dean. There was only one room available. I will take the blanket and, with your permission, I will sleep in your car.”
"No Cas. No. I mean….." Dean was flustered, and then saw the merriment in Cas's eyes. "You're making fun of me."
Sam gets to meet Charlie and Gilda.  Castiel helps out Rowena and Gabriel
Dean took the opportunity to take hold of Castiel’s cock and gave it a stroke in time to his thrusts.   “Do it Cas.  Cum for me.”
“Well I can assure you, your before, during and after care was amazing,” said Dean happily.
“You’ll do it anyway!” screamed Alistair. “Now fucking kneel.”
Castiel huffed and sucked at Dean’s shoulder.  “Maybe I am, but it doesn’t make it any less true.”
Dean groaned and flopped backwards on the bed to avoid looking at Castiel.   “I am never going to watch them again. Too weird.”
“I promise,” said Sam. He squeezed Dean’s hand gently in return. “But it won’t be necessary.”
He didn’t want to disturb Castiel, but he seriously needed to pee.   “Sorry Angel,” he muttered, as he carefully twisted in the bed, wincing at the soreness he felt across his hips and ass.   But it was a good kind of pain, that Dean wouldn’t swap for anything.  Eventually he managed to extract himself from the sprawling octopus that was Castiel and slide out of the bed.  Castiel remained asleep, lying on his stomach, his arm reaching toward Dean’s side of the bed, his face relaxed and serene.
...~~~...
“Cas?  Oh, you mean Castiel.   Yeah, he’s the school’s cross-country champ.  No one runs like him,” said Benny slapping him on the shoulder.  “You’d think a pack of hell hounds was after him.”
“Promise,” said Dean.
“As you said, my life is very bizarre.”
Gabriel had no problem with the boys coming to his place to study and actively encouraged it. But as soon as they walked through the door, they were confined to the lounge, dining room and kitchen.  In true Gabriel style, he announced there would be no ‘hanky panky’ whilst the exams were on.  Dean had just looked embarrassed, while Sam howled with laughter.   Castiel knew Gabriel was doing it for his benefit, and Sam’s, but it didn’t make it any easier.
Dropping his eyes in embarrassment, Cas gave a small shy smile.   Dean put his hand up to take over holding the handkerchief brushing his hand over Cas’s as he did so.  Cas sighed as Dean caressed his hand and nodded.  “OK.”
“Don’t make me separate you two,” said Dean.  The banter between the three of them made Dean relax.   Things couldn’t be that bad if they were already teasing each other.
Dean walked over and gave his brother a long hug. “Thanks Sammy,” he said gruffly.
Feel free to suspend your disbelief at the details in the court room.  I have never been to court and have no idea how these things actually go.   But given this whole world is AU, and A/B/O dynamics, customs and laws are whatever we want them to be, please just go with it.
Dean groaned.   “And they think I’m the Dom.”
This time Castiel picked an older man, he looked like a retired rocker.  “Hmmm.   I think the skinny jeans and leather jacket look is a classic.”
John was waiting for them eagerly, and happily ruffled Sam’s hair as he emptied his school backpack over the kitchen table and started his homework.
Dean could see every tiny gesture that he made. As Cas turned, Dean waited for Cas to see him, but after a moment he realised Cas’s eyes were closed, and he hadn’t noticed Dean standing there gazing at him. Blushing at the thought of being caught watching him, Dean still couldn’t tear his eyes away from the frankly beautiful sight of Cas’s body as it shimmered and spun in the morning light.
Castiel books a night away for them together at a hotel and gives Dean a necklace that says Assbutt, Castiel wears one that says Dork.
John let go, and studied Dean’s face carefully, before nodding, and turning to Castiel, “Good to see you again.  I hear tell you’ve had a pretty rough time of it lately.”
John patted Dean on the back, and they broke apart.  “Maybe all he needs is a friend.  Someone in his corner,” said John.
“Look after each other boys.   Goodbye son.”
Watching as Castiel pocketed the card again Dean said, “I thought you were some kind of penniless student living on welfare.  Are you secretly a millionaire?”
Clutching a hand to his chest as though Castiel had physically slapped him, “you wound me,” Dean said.
“I don’t mind helping,” said Dean quickly, “just let me know what you need.”
Cas had bumped into Dean, quite literally, in the library.   Dean had been sitting reading at one of the tables, when Cas who had been carrying a mountain of books that he obviously couldn’t see over or around had fallen over Dean, the pile of books scattering around them, as Dean had instinctively thrown out his arm to catch the falling man, and ended up with Cas sitting in his lap gasping in surprise.
“Right.  Sam, you’re with me.”   John opened the car door and gave the boys one long last glance.   “No detours, or pit stops.  I expect you home asap.  Capisce?”
I'm still very new to AO3, and not used to tagging.   If you think there is something that should be tagged, please don't hesitate to let me know.
“Yes, that’s correct,” said Castiel.   “But how’d you know?”
John just held Sam, allowing him a moment to let the tears flow, and looked back at Castiel, who was just as surprised.
Dean’s eyes flew to Cas’s and then looked away, “what kind of question is that?” he asked.
“S’eep now.  Clean later.”  Castiel’s eyes were closed, and he felt absolutely boneless.  He couldn’t have moved, even if he wanted to.   “Thank you,” he murmured.
“I’m not going to ignore you Cas.”
“Good to see you too.”  Sheriff Mills had seen Alistair’s body from the road.   She walked around Dean and bent down to check he was dead.   “You can put your hands down,” she said and nodded to Castiel who was approaching.
Pacing up and down the short room, Dean looked up when the door opened.  Benny slipped into the room, looking concerned.   “Teacher sent me.  You OK Cher?”
“Gabriel!” complained Castiel, interrupting.   “Behave or Sam and therefore Dean will have to leave.”
“Not just that,” said Dean. “Thank you for saving Jack, for helping me keep him, for being his Papa.” He added quietly.
Another nurse appeared and injected a clear liquid into the cannula in the back of his hand. It took a few seconds, but Dean immediately felt calmer. He could hear the nurses calling out stats from the monitor, and Missouri talking to him; he could feel Sam holding and squeezing his hand; he could feel something pressing on his stomach and the smell of blood. He was aware of everything, but couldn’t find the strength or the inclination to actually be worried about it.
“And I’m Jess. Also single.” Jess stayed watching the outputs on the monitor, but trying to give Dean some privacy with his pup.
Dean's anger dissipated slightly. "Still not cool, Bitch"
“Well looking like you do, I bet you aren’t ever without a date for long,” said Benny smiling at him.    “But let me tell you now, you ain’t my type.”
Castiel carefully withdrew from Dean.   Dean whined a little at the sensation of loss.   Removing himself from the bed, Castiel reached for his earlier discarded towel, and quickly placed it under Dean to catch any lube and Castiel’s cum as it leaked from Dean’s ass, and then gently massaged Dean’s thighs to ease any aches that he could be experiencing from being in such an unusual position.
“What?” said Dean surprised.  He heard Castiel yelling at Gabriel to go away in the background.
Cas smirked proudly and gripped Dean's hips before licking him from base to tip. Dean swore again and clutched wildly at the wall to stop his knees giving way.
“I’ll do everything I can to find a way, as often as I can,” said Dean.   “But in the meantime,” he said kissing along Castiel’s jaw line and down into his neck before pushing back into the cushions and laying on top of him, “we still have a week together.  Let’s make the most of it.”
Dean and Castiel walked side by side, the small group making their way down the corridor together.  It was like a boxer being led to the ring by his entourage.   The whispers followed them.   Lee wasn’t in their first class, so he peeled off to go to his own classroom.
“Not really.  I mean, I’ll probably help my Dad with his business for a while,” said Dean.  He deflected the attention easily, “it’s Sam that’s the smart one.  The teachers are already suggesting that maybe he skips ahead a year, and I know he’s already checking requirements for Stanford.”
“A…L?   Alistair.”     They were on the front steps of the school now, and Benny grabbed Dean’s arm forcing him to stop.  “Dean!”
Dean shook his head, and took a large swig of whisky straight from the bottle. "Look the whisky is for me, and I would like you to join me. But you don't have to."
Claire burst into laughter at the other end of the phone.   “It worked then.”
Reluctantly Dean realised Castiel was right. Dean realised that his scent had probably given him away to Castiel. He’d been running on empty for hours before stopping to rescue Castiel, and the thought of trying to navigate his way to Lawrence via back roads and in this dreadful weather was too much.
“Yes, yes,” cried Castiel.
“Mi casa es su casa,” said Castiel as he tipped the bags out on the bed and started to put the clothes away in the closet.
“Fuck,” said Dean in stunned amazement.
gone to all this trouble.”  He kissed Castiel again.  “Thank you.”
The male Omega nodded politely at Dean and smiled. “Hey. I’m Jon. Is this your first pup?”
Dean smiled happily and kissed Cas again and again, gradually increased the pressure and friction between them before reaching down between them and taking hold of Cas's cock. Cas swore once very loudly invoking his father's name in vain before Dean smothered his mouth with more kisses.
“Fuck you’re hot when you swear.” Gripping Castiel’s strong thick thighs Dean pushed gently, the lube easing the way, and in a single smooth move he slid fully into Castiel.  Bottoming out, Dean paused, needing a moment to gather himself, and checked in on Castiel.  “Angel?”

He turned in a slow circle, looking out over the shoreline and then the forest before finally spotting something about 100 yards away. The uneven shape of the lake meant that certain parts were hidden from view, but he caught a glimpse of movement, behind some trees a little further along the shoreline. Given the proximity of the motorbike, he assumed it was Cas, but decided to check before announcing his presence.
“If you head back about a quarter mile, there’s Ma Frampton’s B&B. That’s probably the closest.”
Dean estimation of Alistair’s fighting skills were already fairly low, but watching him carelessly handle and disrespect the knife he was carrying made them sink to even greater depths.   “Where’s Cas?” demanded Dean.
Dean wanted to call out, but experienced had taught him that stealth and cautiousness were usually better options.
Castiel was sitting by a lake, enjoying the warmth of the setting sun on his face, when he felt rather than heard Dean's distress. He knew people didn't understand their 'profound bond', but having saved Dean from Hell, quite literally, he instantly was on alert. The urgent whisper or weak whine of "Cas", had every molecule of his body focus their attention on Dean. With a flutter that left a few leaves dancing in the wind, he transported himself to the bunker, where he knew Dean was.
Cas smiled and placed the book carefully on the table. "I believe I would like to take a walk with you."
“No seriously.  It was the least I could do, for everything you did to… sorry I mean,
“Perfect.”  Dean piled up a few more items.  A small frying pan and several large kitchen knives.
Dean had achieved his GED, and with Gabriel’s and Castiel’s help and encouragement had applied to the California Fire Service.  Sheriff Mills had volunteered a letter of reference, and Dean had been accepted to join their training program.   Not only would he receive training to become a Firefighter, but he was also paid a salary.   His supervisor was impressed with aptitude and natural leadership skills and had already recommended additional certifications to boost Dean’s career.
Dean face turned red, partly with embarrassment and partly with anger. "What I did was wrong. I didn't mean to think," he stressed the word think, "about you." He rubbed his hand through his hair, brushing droplets of water off onto the floor. "This is so humiliating," he mumbled.
Making good on his offer to teach Castiel some basic self-defence moves, they agreed that Dean and Sam would go to Gabriel’s house on Thursday that week, straight from school.
“Shut up Bitch,” grouched Dean.
Everything had happened so fast in the labour ward, and Jack had been taken away so quickly, that Dean hadn’t had time to really understand and process exactly how small a 2½lb baby really was. If anything, Jack looked even smaller. He had a very fine dusting of blond hair on his head, his arms and legs were thin, and his skin was bright red. Dean was startled at that, it reminded him too much of how Benny looked when his Polycythaemia had hit. “Is the redness normal?” he asked the nurse that was monitoring Jack. She was reading Jack’s file and making notes.
“I…. um…. OK.  Don’t get mad,“ said Dean defensively.  “I wanted them to be really angry, cause people do stupid things when they’re angry.  So, I thought, what would really upset them….” Dean trailed off.
“I’m sure we’ll get to that,” said Castiel shyly, “but I hope you enjoyed that with me.”
“We’re good.”
When Dean turned, he saw that Castiel had climbed into bed.  He’d taken the left side of the bed and was lying down, arm bent supporting his head.  He’d pulled only the sheet up over himself to his chest, leaving the blankets at the bottom of the bed, his towel lay discarded on the floor.  The subdued lighting meant that Dean couldn’t see the blue in Castiel’s eyes anymore, but he could feel his gaze.
Once the waitress had taken their order, Dean turned his attention to Castiel.  “You’ve spent too long hiding Cas.”  He indicated Castiel’s familiar clothing, his standard uniform of sweatshirt and jogging bottoms.   “At school I can see you wear them to blend in.  But why are you wearing them during the weekend too?”
Thank you to everyone who has commented or left kudos.   BTW: if you don't think this is worth a kudos, please drop me a comment to let me know why.   I would love to understand what I can improve upon.
“Oh, goody for you,” said Castiel sarcastically.   “Now not only will I have the Jocks after my hide for being gay, but the girls are going to hate me for …” he paused.
“OK.  Forget I mentioned it.”  There was a small pause, before John spoken again. “You know we leave in a couple of weeks, have you two talked about that?”
“Yeah, I know.  Don’t acknowledge you,” said Dean sadly.   He walked away a few steps before turning and calling back to Castiel.  “But you can acknowledge me if you want.”  He ran off before he could any response.
Castiel dropped his head, “You never made any secret that you weren’t going to stay.”
“I’ve never left the US,” said Dean.   “Russia sounds exciting.  Did you learn any Russian?”
But again, Castiel’s lessons had been disrupted, and the rumours were starting to circulate again.  This time, it wasn’t a Sugar Daddy that had brought Castiel’s new clothes, but the ill-gotten gains of his drugs business.
“After relinquishing you,” suggested Castiel.   “Handing you over to me?”
“Thank you, I would appreciate that.”
Cas was about to speak, when a glare from Dean made him close his mouth.
Dean yawned.  “I know you are still thinking about it.   I promise we’ll talk some more tomorrow.  But right now, I think we’re both exhausted.  We should get some sleep.”
“You said I should ask,” said Castiel reaching up to touch Dean’s jaw tenderly.   “But I also want to offer.   I gift myself to you freely.   I am prepared to accept whatever you are willing to give me.”
Placing his helmet in the footwell, he climbed into the passenger seat. Gabriel looked like he was about to say something, but Castiel cut him off. “Just drive, Gabe. I’ll tell you on the way,” said Castiel.
Confused, Castiel looked at Sam, who was looking at the floor ashamed.   Sam suddenly crumpled against his Dad and started crying.
“I am not surprised,” said Castiel.  “Can we have the bill?”
“Unarmed?”
Huffing, Dean took a large mouthful of coffee.   “It’s just me, my brother Sammy, and Dad.   Mum died when I was four.   Sammy’s four years younger than me, and says he doesn’t care who I like, as long as they aren’t a douchebag.  My Dad – well I gotta say he took it better than I expected.”  Cradling the mug in his hands, he stared up at the mirror, checking who was within earshot.  “He’s an ex-Marine, so I expected a whole heap of shit about it.   Especially after he walked into my bedroom and found me with a guy giving me a blowjob.”
The first indication that something was different was as Dean was standing at his locker.   The usual clamour of students in the school corridor died away.  It was like a tidal wave of silence, followed by loud whispering.  Turning to see what was causing the commotion, Dean looked down past the students to see Castiel walking determinedly towards him.   Dean’s mouth dried up, and even knowing the selection of clothes that Castiel had to choose from, the appearance of the man in front of him took his breath away.  Their eyes met and neither could break the intensity of the stare between them.
“Never took you for a metal fan, Cas,” Dean said when the song ended.
Dean leaned forward and kissed him gently, allowing his mouth to relax and their tongues find each other.   They kissed languidly for a while before Dean sighed and said, “I think I should be thanking you.  You were incredible.  This place is incredible.   Can’t we just stay here?”
On the plus side, Dean hadn’t seen any further signs of being followed, which he took a win.
"Uh huh," said Cas trying and failing to stop Dean from gently moving in a very enticing way up and down his body. Realising Dean had slowed down of his own volition, "Anything," said Cas. "I agree to anything and everything you want."
“I can’t believe this is happening so soon,” said Dean. “I was sure Jack would be late, despite what Missouri said.” He bit his lip. “Sam. Charlie was going to be my birth partner. But she’s out of town with Gilda. Will you stay with me?”
The doctor smiled. “I’m Doctor Brown. One of the doctors on duty tonight. May I check on how you’re doing?”
Castiel blushed and ignored him.
Dean continued to kiss him as he continued his ministrations on Castiel’s ass.     Dean could feel Castiel becoming more eager.   This time he didn’t ask, and just slid a third finger into Castiel.   Castiel tensed slightly before relaxing, but this time Dean didn’t give him a chance to adjust.  He twisted his fingers and lightly brushed over Castiel’s prostrate.
Unable to stand the unease any longer.  Castiel reached for the remote and paused the movie.   It seemed to take Sam several seconds to notice, before he turned and looked quizzically at Castiel.
“You shouldn’t be thinking about getting him to bed at all,” said Gabriel with a wink.
Castiel continued to try on the various items of clothing that Dean had selected.   He realised quite quickly that the skinny jeans weren’t an option that actually suited him.   He preferred round necks on T-shirts rather than V-necks, almost any shade of blue on him looked better than green, and he favoured dark greys and black T-shirts if given a choice.   Dean and Noah swapped out a lot of items after the third outfit, realising that some things were just never going to look right on Castiel.   Finally, after nearly three hours, a lot of clothing changes and Noah bringing them some coffee from the staff room, they had their final selection of clothing.  Most of the items would mix and match anyway, despite them being put together in specific sets.
Dean sat staring at Jack, committing every feature to memory. His tiny nose flaring as he breathed, his little forehead wrinkling as though he was thinking hard about something. As he watched, Jack yawned, stretched, and opened his eyes. Dean gasped.
When he had finished, Cas stood up slowly, giving Dean some space. Cas carefully reached over to turn off the water, whilst maintaining a hand widths distance between them. He wanted to touch and kiss Dean's chest, but he wasn't quite sure how Dean would react. Now his desperate need was sated, would he still want him? He turned to face Dean. "God Cas, that was ….." Dean couldn't speak, so instead Dean lowered his lips to Cas's and kissed him with an intensity that Cas wasn't expecting.
"Yeah, me and Cas," said Dean firmly, steeling himself for Sam's reaction.
Gazing out the window, Castiel debated exactly how much to tell his brother. Gabriel was also an Alpha, so would probably understand the compulsion Castiel had felt to care for Dean, but he wasn’t sure he would understand Castiel’s regret at the situation. Gabriel had always been a love them and leave them kind of Alpha, before he’d met the love of his life, his True Mate, who was now his wife, Rowena. Castiel also knew Gabriel would not leave him alone until he had the full story.
Grinding his teeth together, Castiel refused to speak during the entire class, and dashed out the door as soon as the bell rang, so Dean didn’t even get the opportunity to speak to him again.
“Dad no,” said Dean visibly upset as his father’s intentions were becoming clear. “Sam?”
Castiel opened his eyes, and gazed up slightly unfocused on Dean.   “Is it always like that?”
Dean looked over at Uriel and schooled his features into his best ‘mess with me and die’ face.   His father had taught him the trick of looking about six inches behind the eyes of someone you wanted to intimidate.  John described it as the psychopath stare.
Dean's eyes few open and immediately settled on the crystal blue eyes of Castiel. The events of last night came flooding back, which with the look of adoration and delight on Cas's face made Dean feel the heat rise in his face. Yep, he was in bed with Cas. And in an instance, he realised he was OK with that.
They appeared in the same position as they had left the shower room. With Cas gently nuzzling Dean's ear. Although Cas had taken the opportunity to dry them, they were both still naked.
Castiel smiled, one of his large gummy grins. “I promise you my undivided attention as soon as you are well enough, Omega mine.” He eased Jack into a comfortable position, skin to skin, allowing Jack the best access to his scent gland. Castiel sat reclined in the chair, with Jack nestled into his neck, taking in therapeutic lungful's of Castiel’s scent. Jess pulled up a second chair for Dean opposite Castiel’s so Dean could watch them.
Both boys were willing to share their schoolwork with Dean, which helped him quickly catch up on the syllabus.  Every school was different, and Dean had been frustrated that they were covering work that he had already done elsewhere, but he also found that he was missing huge chunks of other things.  Between them they managed to fill in a few gaps, and quickly became friends.
Dean kissed him again, “God Cas, I don’t deserve you.”
Castiel blushed furiously and turned away to get his books from his bag, refusing to say another word.
“Dude, whatever you do, don’t admit that to anyone else,” said Dean grinning.   “We need to up your street cred, not destroy it.”
Dean sagged dejectedly. That would add at least another hour to the journey. He was so tired. He rubbed his eyes, and scrubbed his face trying to will himself awake. “Seriously?”
Gabriel opened the bag and tipped the contents onto the coffee table.   It was a collection of the various bracelets and a couple of leather necklaces.
“It was a while ago, but I’ve read the book.”
“Um, yes, thank you,” said Castiel blushing.  “Your ranch is quite lovely.   Oh, and Ryan was very good at looking after us during our meals.”
“How about you?” said Dean.  “You mentioned kissing that boy at Church.  Anything else?”
“Dean!” exclaimed Sam, putting down his book and standing up. “I was beginning to worry. You were gone for so long.”
Dean glanced over at Sam.   Neither their father or Dean, had ever especially sheltered Sam from the world.   Sam had participated in all the same training that Dean had, with guns, knives and self-defence.  They had both spent a lot of time around adults at various survival camps, listening to stories that both men and women told of their adventures, their battles, violence, and on occasion their sexual exploits.   At 14 years old, Sam was still hopefully innocent, but not unaware.
“You’re sure Gabe won’t mind?”
“Good idea,” said Dean. Fortunately Dean did know the area well. He took the phone from Castiel, and on the open Map app, he dropped a marker. “It might not be exact, but within 100 feet or so.”
Dinner turned out to be a very comfortable, informal get together in Gabriel’s back garden.   The large decked area that Dean thought looked like a dance floor, actually covered a sunken firepit.   With the cover removed, there was built in seating, with lots of comfortable cushions and cozy blankets.  Gabriel handed everyone toasting forks, and a started to pass round a selection of meats, vegetables, and cheeses to be toasted over the pit.
Dean laughed, “Yeah, I’ve probably watched way too many makeover shows.”
“I think I’ve been to or through about 43 of the states.  I used to keep track, but it got old very quickly.  We didn’t always stop to look at the local attractions. How about you?  Been anywhere exciting?”
Releasing his hold on Castiel’s wrist, Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel, drawing him closer.   “I think maybe we both need to use our words right now,” Dean huffed into Castiel’s hair.
This chapter has a short sex scene at the beginning. If you don't want to read, please skip ahead until you see the line starting "Wonderful".
“Call me John.   Pleased to meet you,” said John returning the handshake.   “I guess you heard about the excitement last night.”
Gathering his weird collection of items, Dean swept out of the house, Gabriel and Benny hot on his heels.   He threw everything he’d selected from the kitchen on to the backseat of the Impala.   Gabriel made as though he was going to get in the car as well, but Dean held up his hand.   “Sorry Gabe, I need to you stay here.”
Cas broke into a wide smile and gently reached for Dean's hand. "You did all this?" he sighed. "It's lovely."
As always, a huge thank you to everyone who has read this story, and leaves Kudos or Comments.   I appreciate each and every one.
It was about ten minutes before the end of the movie when Gabriel returned, carrying a couple of small bags of groceries.   Glancing at Castiel and Dean, he rolled his eyes, and mouthed “Friends?  Right.”
Dean felt so turned on he couldn’t think about anything other than the sensation of Castiel against him.  Castiel wasn’t applying any pressure to Dean, but their cocks were occasionally touching through their underwear, sending exciting frissons across Dean’s whole body.  At the back of his mind Dean knew they had agreed to discuss what would happen, but Castiel was clearly taking the lead, which Dean did not object to, and discussions don’t appear to be in Castiel’s play book right now.  As though Castiel had just read his mind, Castiel broke their kiss to breathe and whispered in Dean’s ear, “May I touch you intimately?”
Each page was Cas in a different setting.    The photos were actually rather good, and showed Cas’s figure off to best advantage.  He wasn’t naked in every shot and you could see a progression through the story being told in images.   Standing in front of a large soft bed, one arm resting on the cross bar of a large picture window, with his shirt open and loose, his thumb hooked into his jeans pocket.   Then lying back on his elbows on the bed, his erection covered by his jeans, but a clearly visible bulge present, as though watching his lover off camera.   Another of him lying face down on the bed, naked in that one, with his ass on display, looking like he was asleep after being completely and utterly fucked out.   Further poses in various states of undress, showing off incredible abdominal muscles, and his treasure trail leading to covered but clearly generously proportioned cock.
“Your plan worked then,” said Lee.
“Storms washed out the main road about half a mile further down,” said the officer. “It’s impassable.”
“Erotica,” said Gabriel grinning wildly.   “Jimmy’s first photoshoot hit the shelves yesterday.   A nice little gender neutral magazine, for women or men.”
They made their way back to school independently, at Castiel’s insistence.  Dean was trying to absorb the situation that Castiel faced every day.   He couldn’t imagine how someone’s parents, people that were supposed to love and support you, could be so hostile to their own child.   More than ever he wanted to show his support for Castiel, as a friend should.   It wasn’t Castiel’s fault that his family members were assholes.
“Do I sense your Alpha being protective?” said Gabriel trying to tease him. “Has the great marble edifice that is Castiel cracked?”
“Good Cas,” said Dean huskily, continuing to stroke Castiel.  “I like hearing you say that.”
“It’s OK,” said Sam. “It’s not the first time someone thought that. But I’m single.”
I hope you all enjoy the next installment.
“And that smell of gun oil from your car the other night,” said Gabriel.
"Jerk." Sam gave them both a little nod goodbye and left them, stopping to say goodbye to Jess on his way out.
“Guys,” said Dean.  “I know you’re doing this because Cas is my friend.  But I think I need to tell you something.”
Dean raised his eyes from the hem of Castiel’s shirt, and finally looked into Castiel’s anxious blue eyes.   Every interaction between them had been building to this.   The smiles, the glances, the rescues, the “hello Dean’s”, the manly hugs, the slaps on the back, the hand on the shoulder that rested a moment too long, the way Castiel always made sure there was coffee for Dean in the morning, how he always let Dean pick the movie they’d watch, and the long soul gazing between them, even finding a book for him on Nordic Runes - every damn thing that Castiel did, always led back to Dean.
It was during one of their many movie nights, that Dean had tried to broach the subject of sex with Cas, even going as far as asking if Cas was maybe ACE or Demisexual.  Cas had blinked several times, before kissing Dean passionately, and confessing that he had been trying to think of a way to tell Dean that he’d never actually been with anyone before.    Cas was just scared of messing up and frightening Dean away.  Dean had immediately returned Cas’s kiss with an equally passionate one of his own, and said that he was happy to wait as long as necessary for Cas to be ready.
“None of your damn business,” said Dean firmly.   “Just fuck off and leave us alone.”
Reaching out with his left hand in the semi darkness, Dean tentatively linked his fingers with the right hand of Castiel.   “Tell me what you want,” said Dean.
Internally Dean cringed at Castiel’s continued belief that people wouldn’t or shouldn’t be seen with him.   “What about if we drove out of town?  To say, Topeka?   It’s not so far to be unreasonable, but far enough that we’re unlikely to see anyone that knows you.  Stuff will be cheaper in the Mall too.”
Dean felt like he was King of the World at the moment.  Here was a freaking Angel, begging him, trusting him, allowing him to make love to him.    And Dean knew that was what this was.  It wasn’t sex, it was love.
Dean’s gaze turned from worry to relief.  “Assholes,” he said without any heat.
Sam grinned happily, as Dean reluctantly replaced the pie and carried the box out to the kitchen.
Castiel blushed an even darker shade of red and glanced at Dean.   Dean swallowed audibly and gestured with a finger twirl that Castiel should do a spin.
“Well to quote a master, you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, smarter than you think, and loved more than you know,” said Gabriel tenderly.
That was not what Dean expected.   “And?”
“Sounds great.  Where’s Cas?” said Dean trying to sound casual.
“Good,” said Dean.  “Thank you Sheriff.”
Alistair had telegraphed his move before he’d even made it.  Dean blocked the punch easily and shoved him back, sending Alistair skidding to the floor.   Dean spun quickly, towards the shorter boy, his fists raised ready to defend or attack.  The shorter boy wisely took a step backwards away from Dean, grabbed Alistair by the arm and pulled him away.
“Do not make me smite you, human,” Castiel said commandingly, but the moment was broken a second later as he grinned.
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
Dean stared at him.   “I really should you know.   No one would ever know.  I can make you disappear, and no one would ever find the body.   I could say you ran and escaped.”  He raised the gun and pointed it at Alistair.
“Please make sure he’s OK.  I don’t care about me, but you have to save him,” pleaded Dean, holding on to Sam firmly. He saw Sam nod at Missouri, an unspoken acknowledgement of the situation.
Cas glanced up, slightly confused and then looked away hurriedly. "I am unaware of any woman staying last night," he replied honestly. He stood up quickly, "I have things I need to do. I will see you both later."
Dean waddled to his closet and dug out a clean pair of underwear and pants to change into. Once that was done, he grabbed his maternity bag, and made his way to the lounge to wait for Sam.
“Er…. Jessica,” said Sam thinking of the girl that sat next to him in his form group.
Perhaps having spent so much time on carefully preparing Dean, Castiel knew what to expect, and deliberately calmed his body, which allowed Dean a much easier entrance than Dean had expected.   “You’re doing so well,” said Dean.  Moving his finger slowly he stretched Castiel, as Castiel had done to him.   Gradually easing the way with more lube, and careful pressure.   He carefully rubbed another finger alongside the first and let it slip inside.
“DC Comics Constantine?  The guy wears a frigging trench coat and a tie.”
Dean melted at Castiel’s touch, “Yeah.”
Gabriel arrived a couple of hours after Castiel’s call, driving a beaten old pick up truck, and jumped out the cab happily to greet him. Castiel stood up and met him halfway, both pulling each other in for a welcoming hug. They had often joked about their complete lack of family resemblance, with Gabriel being several inches shorter than Castiel, and a lot slighter in build. His hair wasn’t as dark as Castiel’s and his eye colour was a warm golden brown that suited his toffee and nutmeg scent. Continuing their hug, they took a moment to enjoy each other’s familiar scent.
Dean had a premonition that something else was going to happen on Tuesday.   He texted his concern to Castiel that morning.   Dean was convinced that if someone had already slipped gay porn into a locker, planting something worse in Castiel’s locker was a possibility.   Castiel thought it unlikely and was unconvinced by Dean’s argument, but as Dean pointed out, it wasn’t exactly an inconvenience to move his stuff to a different locker and if nothing came of it, so be it.   Therefore, that morning as soon as they could access the school, Dean and Castiel transferred the content of Castiel’s locker to a different one in a different corridor and moved the padlock.
