“When you’re ready to move,” Castiel said as he took a wet towel, cleaning his hands and arms. Dean walked in the room behind him, a clean, dry towel open for his hands. “I want you guys to take our room. Dean and I will bunk with Benny or Jack.”
“Look, I-”
“Yeah,” Dean answered with a nod. “I still feel like I’m dreaming.”
“I never intended for my camp to become what it is,” Chuck sighed, moving around his bedroom and wandering over to a small table with a decanter of alcohol and glasses. He poured himself a glass and then raised it to Dean. “I suppose you wouldn’t trust anything I gave you to drink?”
When Castiel opened his eyes again, he expected it to be because Jo had entered the room, and he was momentarily confused when he saw Dean stepping carefully over to him, a coffee in his hand.
“We don’t mean you any harm!” Castiel called out and Dean glanced over at him, raising a brow at the deep intimidation he put in his voice. Castiel shrugged back and then looked up, listening. “We are just passing through and were looking for a safe place to camp for the night. We’ll leave!”
Dean glanced at him, blowing out a slow and steady breath. He hadn’t talked about Lisa in so long… As he struggled to find the words, he was surprised to hear Castiel answer first.
Castiel smiled widely, picking up one of the pieces and examining the fabric. “There was a sewing kit in the gear we picked up at Bobby’s house. I bet the needle would go through this. If not, we’re on a military ship. They probably have something that would work on board.”
Dean swallowed hard, knowing he was missing something but afraid to ask. Instead, he lifted the mug and drank the rest of his broth, before falling back with a contented sigh. His eyes were growing heavy and everything felt warm. Beside him, Castiel took the mug and smoothed the blanket over him.
“Dinner’s ready,” Jody said, giving him a small smile as she reached in to help him scrub the clothes. They worked quickly but efficiently, Jody emptying and refilling the tub with cold water twice before the water was clear. By the time they had rung out the clothes and had them hanging on the shower curtain rod, Castiel had made his way up the stairs and was standing at the doorway watching them.
“We’re almost there,” Castiel was telling Charlie, he was on his knees beside the bed, Charlie crouched in the small space between the bunks, her forehead pressed against Gilda’s. “Just keep pushing, Gilda, you’re doing so good.”
Dean chuckled and nodded, already planning out what they would need. It would have to be a work in progress, but it would be a fun project for them to do, regardless. “Yeah, how about we head over to Menards after we get some breakfast?”
. He tried to look up, tried to tell him he was being stupid and to escape, but nothing came out.
“You okay with that?” Sam asked and Dean nodded, glancing at him again.
“Cas,” Dean said, reaching over to grab his arm. Castiel nearly jumped a foot in the air, spinning towards Dean with wide eyes, his hand going to his katana. “No, it's okay!” Dean said quickly, releasing his arm and holding up his own hands. “No danger, promise.”
of the door closing, and despite Castiel shutting it gently, it felt like a slam. A finality. An ending of Dean’s heart.
He could get used to waking up like this every day.
They were safe enough to share a meal with, however.
“Uh,” Castiel started, and Dean watched as he tried to place the scene in his mind. Dean squeezed his hand and took a step forward, Charlie leaning back from him in surprise.
this.”
The water was still hot as they rinsed off and Castiel chuckled as Dean said, “Despite the creepy atmosphere and the ‘almighty Chuck’, I wouldn’t mind living with this water heater.”
“Hush,” Castiel whispered back, hooking his chin over Dean’s shoulder and giving him a squeeze. “We don’t know that. They could be well hidden, they could be on the outskirts of town. If your brother is anything like you? He’s stubborn and resourceful, he’s smart and he’s not going out without a damn fight.”
He had an hour to kill when he got home and after putting away the groceries, headed up to the shower. He tried to make his mind shut off everything else, other than focusing on getting clean. If he got himself worked up before they even started their conversation, it would end up going horribly wrong. Naturally, that simple fear meant that it was all he could think about and by the time he got out of the shower to dry off, he was a mess of nerves.
Castiel smiled fondly at him and lifted the mug up, blowing on it gently before holding it out to Dean. “Drink this and I’ll explain,” he said, helping Dean untangle from the blankets to grab the mug with both hands. The ceramic was warm and he tentatively let the liquid touch his lips before he deemed it safe enough to drink. The rush of salty broth made his stomach growl and he took a huge swallow before looking at Cas expectantly.
The moon was full and high, giving them enough light to see by as they followed her across the grounds. Dean looked behind them, knowing that if anyone were to look out a window, they would easily be spotted walking across the grass. Charlie seemed aware of that fact, for she continued to the street and darted across it, leaving Dean and Castiel running after her to catch up.
As suddenly as the weight was there, the chains were gone, leaving Dean blinking into utter darkness.
. In a way, it was everything Castiel had ever imagined when he thought of his future with Dean. And he could see it, even now, being their life.
“Missed you,” Castiel whispered as Dean pressed their foreheads together.
Dean watched them go and took a moment on the deck, turning his face up towards the sun. The breeze was chilly and he shivered in his jacket. Despite the clothes they’d gotten from Jack and Kelly’s, they were going to have to do some searching for winter supplies when they made land. He made a mental note to check with the girls to see if they had anything for the newborn and cursed under his breath that he hadn't thought of that before.
Chuck stepped around the table and turned, walking back up the steps to his quarters. Then the room erupted into sound. The group moved as a single unit, stacking the chairs, folding the tables, and clearing the space. Dean, Castiel, and Jack followed the group to stack their own chairs, then stood, waiting to see what would happen next.
“So… what now?”
Despite the sun still being out, he walked into the bedroom and stripped the sheets off the bed. He threw his own blanket down before climbing on top and pulling one of the edges over him. He knew he wouldn't have any problem falling asleep.
“Want to see if she runs?” Castiel asked, pressing their foreheads together.
Anna screamed as the last Lifeless ripped through her upper arm, fingernails breaking through her skin like a knife cutting butter. Dean shot forward, stabbing his blade through the creature’s back. It let out an awful howl, Anna’s scream matching it in pitch as it jerked away from her, tearing her arm open.
“You too,” Castiel agreed, reaching for Claire’s shoulders and pulling her in. “This is Claire, and Jack is still sleeping in the car. Claire, this is Gabriel’s fiance, Kali.”
Castiel breathed out a sigh of relief, feeling at ease that Jo was completely committed to taking care of Claire. He grabbed his coat and prepared to stand when Claire turned worried eyes to him.
“It’s good,” Dean said back to him, giving him a smile, “but I’m not carrying your drunk ass to bed.”
His breath hitched, the sound seeming to echo in the small space the bunk bed provided, like they were in their own little world. “Cas!” and “Fuck!” and “God, so good!”spilled from Dean’s mouth like a mantra, Castiel taking in every gasp and moan as encouragement. Dean squeezed his thighs around Castiel’s shoulders, his fingers tapping out a warning on his head, and Castiel swallowed hard, taking Dean over the edge.
Dean just smiled and opened his granola bar as he stood and turned, ready to continue walking.
“Nervous?” Dean checked, shaking his head. “No… should I be?”
Sam sighed and Dean jumped as the chair beside him was pulled out, the legs scraping against the tile.
Dean eyed the map, nodding as he watched Castiel trace an alternate route to the one they were on. Then he reached forward and pointed. “Why don’t we just go straight? If we went this way, we could avoid Chicago and -”
“I didn’t think I’d ever see you again,” Sam whispered against Dean’s cheek, clinging back just as desperately.
Still, this would be the first time they would be in close quarters for longer than thirty minutes and he was nervous. He tried to look around the house from his mother’s perspective, then looked down at his own clothes and grimaced. He would have to change before they got there… He thought of the kids upstairs. What would she think of Claire? She hadn’t said much about him choosing to adopt a teenager…
By the end of the bridge, Charlie had slowed so they were all three walking together once more. The air was still, grey and cold, though the snow had stopped falling late in the night. Dean exhaled slowly, watching his breath hanging heavy before him before disappearing.
Castiel chuckled and was about to ask what type of pie Ellen usually made, when the woman herself called out loudly, "Alright, Dean!" She down a few pints and slid them over the polished wood to the patrons at the other end. "You're up!"
“Shut up,” Castiel muttered, turning to leave the room.
Dean’s heart stopped right there in the middle of his chest. The boy, Jack, hugged the container of muffins to his chest, Claire having taken the rest of the goods, and then smiled up at Dean again. And Dean couldn’t move. There was no way - it was just a nickname! Cas was common, right?
“Garth said he was going to be down in the kitchens today,” Jack said softly, Dean and Castiel flanking him on either side as they moved towards the locker room.
Sam was uncharacteristically quiet and Dean covered the silence by finishing his drink. The popping of the bottle as he released it from his grip was the trigger Sam needed to
Castiel looked confused, shaking his head slowly. “Dean… they’re not just lakes. They’re -”
And he looked at Claire, the beautiful young woman that had somehow, someway, turned into someone he was so proud of. And Castiel was happy, content, with the family they’d managed to piece together, glued with love, patience, and acceptance.
In the far corner, a fat, fresh Christmas tree stood, decorated with popsicle stick reindeer and clay handprints, large golden and red baubles. There was silver tinsel sprinkled across the branches, twinkling with the blinking colored lights, stray pieces littering the floor with pine needles. Dean found himself inhaling, as if he could smell the pine or the freshly baked cookies he could see sitting on a plate on the coffee table.
“Don’t you dare think that. Dean deciding to drink himself stupid by himself was
Dean shrugged, turning to look at Castiel. The expression Castiel shot back mirrored exactly what Dean was thinking. They had no idea.
the amount of frogs at the other end! There were like a million!”
The alarm pealed through the hall just as the sun came up, waking the entire camp. Dean groaned as the lights followed next, bright and fluorescent. He covered his eyes with his arm and gave himself a moment to pretend he hadn’t heard the alarm.
“Jack, sit and eat your breakfast.” Castiel waited for Jack to climb up into his seat again before he turned to focus on Claire. “You need to watch your language,” he said firmly, picking up his fork and just barely stopping himself from pointing it at her. “Jack doesn’t need to be listening to that, and you will get yourself in trouble if you don’t stop using it.”
“He asked if you were up.”
“A piss-poor attitude and lack of vision?” Chuck interrupted, giving a shrug. “You have been hell bent on one thing and one thing alone - taking apart the camp I have worked so hard to build. This is a new empire, Dean. A new world. The End is truly the beginning and we have the opportunity here to be reborn and live a new life.”
The Roadhouse was large and crowded, full of patrons even though the sun had yet to go down. As soon as they were able to get through the door, Castiel was hit with the smell of
kids, too. He was the one-
Kali flitted between them, keeping Castiel company at the grill before coming to check that the kids didn’t need anything. By the time the first pumpkins were carved and set aside, the food was ready and they were all sent inside to wash their hands.
“What? Oh!” Sam’s eyes darted over and he stood straight, dipping his head in greeting. “I’m sorry, Your Highness. We didn’t know you were in here.”
Jack pressed the doorbell and with Castiel’s warning, pulled his hand back instead of hitting it a second time. Then, the door flung open and Ben rocketed out and nearly took them both down the steps in his excitement.
“Do you need help?” Dean asked Jody as she stood, hoping that she wouldn’t, but willing to get up from the table if she did. Dean had offered her his bedroom - the bed was bigger than Sam’s, which was weird since Sammy was basically a goddamn
Jack looked contrite. “I’m sorry, I just didn’t think-”
Instead, he forced himself to lay there and try to sleep. He sighed, frustrated, and flipped over again, reeling back in shock as he was face to face with Charlie Bradbury.
"Should we... take a tour?" Castiel suggested, smirking at the low growl that answered him back. He laughed once, loud and sharp, and then spun on his heel and took off in the direction of their bedroom.
Sam pursed his lips, thinking, then smiled. “The car!”
“Dean, darling, would you show Castiel around the school for me? Mr. Kline is our new third grade teacher, he’s taking over for Mr. Turner. Castiel, this is our school nurse, Dean Winchester.”
If Sam’s in a hotel room, that means they’re on a hunt and hopefully his future self just ran out to grab a bite to eat… he stared at the door instead, willing it to open.
“Jack… is this all gasoline?” Castiel asked in surprise, picking up a red, five-gallon gas can. Dean pushed up onto his toes to peer over the stack of boxes and equipment and saw six more jugs.
“Fuck,” Dean whispered, his breath coming in gasps, but he couldn’t bite back the smile on his lips. Dean felt Cas’ own smile against his throat, then the brush of his lips, before the other man pulled back slowly. Castiel brushed past Dean, reaching for the pile of their toiletries on the bench. Castiel came back with a washcloth and bar of soap, working a good lather up in the cloth before turning towards Dean.
Dean reached between them, groaning as his fingers were immediately coated with slick and he pulled back to suck them between his lips, groaning obscenely around them. Castiel’s cock twitched, a fresh wave of slick pulsing from his hole in response.
On the other side of the car, Dean was out, standing on the pavement, making sure to keep most of his body shielded by the door.
“Oh sweet, beautiful, best friend of mine, how I have missed the dulcet tones of your voice. It fills me with so much happiness that I can hardly stand to-”
Ben and Jack nodded slowly, and Dean gave a small smile to each of them before continuing. “There are going to be times where you should stand up for yourself and your friends,” he said, nodding over at Ben, “but it should
He was embarrassed too, embarrassed at being caught by the waiter and by Claire. With his parents, he’d mastered how to keep a tight rein on his emotions and it was this infuriating man that never failed to draw them all out of him and leave him bare. He looked over at Claire again, the teenager still smirking at him, and he realized that right now he was supposed to be an adult.
“Just turn out the light when you’re done, baby,” she answered, staring for a moment more before turning away and heading towards the stairs and back to bed.
Castiel gave a soft laugh, then asked, "Why were fireflies your favorite?"
Dean jumped, shoving his good leg against the tile to push himself backwards. His back hit the wall, giving himself full view of the kitchen, his backside protected. At the far end of the table, Benny sat, his head leaning against his fist, a bored expression on his face.
The sun was finally peeking through the clouds, pushing the rainy afternoon back and heating the air around them. It was too cool for the AC, but warm enough that the windows needed to be open. Beside Castiel in the passenger seat, Claire scowled as he cracked the window, immediately punching the button on her door to crack her window before reaching up to wiggle her ear.
“Cas?” Sam said softly, leaning his forehead against the door. “I… please let me in.”
Castiel made a soft noise of protest, his voice strained as he asked, “Can you get his other side? He’s too weak.”
Meg gave just a moment for Castiel to think before she continued.
He followed I-80 until it became I-280, then went north on I-29, effectively avoiding Omaha and whatever barricades the larger city would’ve brought for him. He could almost taste a cold beer and feel Bobby’s leather couch under his ass…
“Is this a joke?”
“Much better!” Uriel announced as he strode back into the room, Dean, Castiel, Anna, and Alfie already sitting around the fire. Alfie had dragged over the stools, their wet clothing hanging over them to dry, and Uriel nodded his thanks as Dean shoved the last stool towards him.
He swallowed back an argument, reminding himself that if they were going to survive the rest of this move, now more than ever he needed to pick his battles. Instead, he sighed and looked in the rearview mirror, smiling at Jack slumped over in the backseat, a nest of pillows and blankets surrounding his booster seat.
Summers were somehow harder than the school year. There was something about the kids that kept him
“Dean, you can’t stay up all night worrying about something that might not be,” Castiel answered, giving his arm a squeeze. “We have no idea what we’re going to find.”
"I am really hoping to change that," Castiel whispered.
She beamed back at him, reaching for him and holding on tight. Dean inhaled, closed his eyes, and grit his teeth as they moved. He exhaled slowly as he opened his eyes and then glared at Charlie who was pulling on the edge of her shirt.
Castiel nodded and followed Dean over to the couch. He sat down beside Dean, the Alpha's leg pressing against the entire length of his. He felt his stomach flip pleasantly and he ached to just reach out and take the Alpha's hand. This, however, was not the time for the conversation they needed to have. Instead, Castiel folded his hands over his lap and made himself busy looking around the room. There were paintings on the wall and he recognized a lot of the images from places around the castle grounds. Dean caught him looking at one and he bumped their shoulders, gaining his attention.
. Dean lifted a hand, running his finger over the sleeping baby’s cheek. When he looked up, Castiel was watching him from across the fire, a small smile on his lips. Dean found himself returning it, watching as Castiel went back to work preparing food for everyone with Jack over the fire.
“I know it’s a far cry from ‘Where’s the angel?’.”
Dean’s eyes narrowed and he turned to Ben who was refusing to look at him.
“Shit,” he whispered out loud and pulled his shirt from his head. He tossed it over towards the hamper and then settled back against the pillows, his fingers tapping nervously against his stomach. He needed… he wasn’t quite sure. But he knew someone who would know what he needed. He reached for his phone and flicked into his recent contacts.
Charlie shook her head. “No, the last time we had an ultrasound, it was too early to tell. The one we got at the compound was just rudimentary, making sure the baby’s heart was beating and that they were growing.”
“When Gilda got pregnant, I was the psycho Mom. We’d been planning this for years, you know? We debated on who was going to carry the munchkin, and I was not thrilled at the idea of being pregnant, though I would’ve done it if she wanted me to. I go back and forth feeling guilty that I wasn’t the one pregnant when shit hit the fan.”
“Are you – is this – I don’t believe that the middle of the night is the best time to be ‘entertaining’ guests, Castiel.”
The morning came fast. Jack puttered around the kitchen, restless in his excitement for a change of scenery. It made Dean smile, despite not wanting to move from the nest of blankets he and Castiel had made of their sleeping gear on the living room floor. Castiel seemed to have the same idea. Quietly laughing at the sight of Jack humming to himself, he wrapped his arms around Dean and held him close.
“It’s not like it’s going to be iced over or anything,” Dean replied, giving another shrug. Castiel wasn’t having any of it.
Jack had taken it upon himself to raid the local clinic after the end and stolen boxes of medical supplies. It was how the little house was so well stocked and why there was a medical bed sitting in the middle of the dining room. But the hope Jack had that the stolen supplies would save his mother had long since faded. Jack knew his mom wasn’t going to make it. Their entire little community did.
Gilda smiled at him and replied, “Thanks, Benny. My feet are freaking killing me…”
“Just, nothing.” Dean shook his head and kicked Sam’s chair back with his foot. “I just knew Cas wasn’t going to stick around. He
“Didn’t John tell you? I’m the first of your three lessons. We gotta get going, too, if we don’t want this to take all night.” Benny lifted his arm, his skin strange and translucent, and he appeared to be looking at a watch that wasn’t there. He chuckled to himself and then met Dean’s eyes. “You ready? It’s going to be Christmas morning before we know it.”
Castiel paused in putting on his jacket, turning his head to look at Dean. There was something in his eyes, something Dean couldn’t decipher, and then he gave a sad smile and nodded. “Yeah, funnily enough, I think we are.”
“He’s gone, Sam. He’s gone.”
Castiel looked up as there was three soft raps against the door, seconds before it was pushed open. Anna was already in her dressing gown, and she smiled as she slipped into the room and crossed it in a few quick steps. Castiel smiled at her in greeting and moved to the side of the mattress, giving her room to climb into the bed with him.
Dean cleared his throat, glancing over to see if he’d gained Castiel’s attention. Castiel was walking beside Dean, but he wasn’t
“I just…” Castiel trailed off and leaned forward, Charlie immediately reaching in her back pocket for a flashlight and clicking it on. “Thank you, Charlie,” Castiel said with a smile and then gasped. “Yes! Here! Look, Dean.”
Dean choked on the air and silence fell around both of the tables, interrupted only by the waiter who was standing beside Dean.
Of all the fucking places…
“My mom used to sing The Beatles. You know, before.”
“He’s righ’ there, ask’im.”
Jack looked over Dean’s shoulder, then leaned in and whispered, “I know what Chuck is planning.”
Castiel held his breath.
Waking up was not as pleasant as falling asleep.
“Fuck,” he groaned, rolling to the side, the body falling with a thump beside him. He wiped at the blood in his eyes, Castiel’s knees falling to the ground beside him. “You could’ve… fuck.”
Those, too, stopped after two weeks, and that was when Dean knew.
“Cool,” she settled on and turned back to her food. Castiel let out a sigh of relief beside her.
“She would’ve been proud of you.” Castiel cleared his throat, shifting to get more comfortable in the dirt. Dean moved to sit beside him, finally looking at the mess before them. The flames were almost gone, though the scent of the thick smoke was still heavy in the air.
Behind him, Jack nodded at that, and Dean reached up to ruffle his hair.
Gabriel shook his head, then flopped back against Lucas’ pillow with a sigh. Lucas reached over and took Castiel’s hand, giving it a tight squeeze.
Dean groaned and pushed down, hollowing his cheeks and swallowing hard, taking Castiel to his climax. Dean swallowed all he was given and kissed his way back up Castiel’s body. “Good morning,” he said with a smile, echoing Castiel’s first words to him.
Castiel nodded, knowing the strangeness of being in this room without each other.
“You going tonight?” he asked softly and Dean glanced over at him, nodding.
The broadcasts, too, thinned out. Only coming once a day, the remainder of the time was left on eerie static except for when the city itself came over to announce the delivery schedule for care packages. It was the only time they were allowed out of their homes, to meet the armed military truck to get food and toiletries. Each person had to come out of the house in order to be counted, everyone made to stand in a line, six-feet apart so the gunman could see each and every person easily.
“I appreciate you saying so,” Castiel answered, though Dean knew he didn’t believe it. “I saw him take aim and I fired, causing his shot to go wide. The bullet went through your thigh,” Castiel glanced down at their hands, a small smile playing at his lips before he let his gaze trail down the length of Dean’s body, “but with Kelly and Jack’s help, we were able to get it all out.
“This is my job, Dean,” Castiel interrupted him quickly, squaring his shoulders as he turned to face the other man head-on. “Despite our… past relationship, I am perfectly capable of being a professional and I expect you to do the same. We are coworkers, nothing more. And if you can’t simply show me around the school-”
not the one who broke his brother’s heart.”
It was amazing… how small and fragile this new, tiny human was, and yet he was here, being passed between the group, warm in his blankets, crying and smiling and
“Do you think,” she said slowly, fingers pausing, “we should tell Dean?”
"You were lucky to find Bobby and Ellen," Castiel agreed, finally settling back down and laying his head on Dean's chest.
The makeshift fire pit was overturned, flames licking their way towards the cafe bar by way of the trio’s sleeping gear, the stools, and all of their clothing from the day before. Smoke was thick and black, clinging to the air, and it made Dean’s eyes water. On the ground, Uriel was crouched over Alfie’s body, though his spine was twisted in an unnatural way. Dean didn’t need to see his face to know why.
“What did you do?” Castiel asked and Charlie looked back at him.
It felt like an eternity before it finally did, the key clicking into the lock and the door swinging open to reveal Eileen. She was smiling as she entered but it immediately fell along with the bag of food she was carrying.
Still, even with all of the bits and pieces they’d picked up, they weren’t all that close to figuring out what Chuck’s end game was. They were positive, however, that he had something big planned and they were coming up on its debut.
He couldn’t tell her that he still closed his eyes and pictured his future with a man who was gone. He couldn’t tell her that every time he thought of himself, old and grey on a porch in a rocking chair, telling stories about his youth - she wasn’t the one in the stories. He couldn’t tell her that when he watched romantic movies with her or saw other people’s relationships around him, he always, without fail, thought of Castiel and what they
Bobby had cleaned out the kitchen, the fridge and freezer empty of all perishable food. “When did you guys lose power here?” Dean asked as he let the door fall shut.
Castiel pulled up outside of the large yellow house, suddenly nervous. Jack, however, was just barely able to keep from launching himself out of the car before Castiel stopped. He chuckled and unfastened his seatbelt, grabbing Jack’s bag before following after his son up the front steps.
“My mom died in a fire.”
“Ow! What the fuck, Jo!” Castiel jumped back, immediately placing his hand over the spot. Jo took the opportunity to punch his other shoulder.
Castiel hoped he came across as easy going and pleasant when he smiled at her. Inside, he felt like exploding. He cleared his throat and turned, watching as Dean pushed away from the windowsill and came to join them. He kept his eyes off of Castiel’s face, instead focusing on the center of his chest as he held out his hand.
“Yeah, Cassie, I think we will get to—”
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said sincerely and Dean nodded before turning back around. He realized as he punched in and draped his stethoscope over his shoulders, that this was the first conversation they had without Castiel being mad at
Sam glanced over at Eileen, then leaned forward, pushing Cas’ arm down until the angel dropped the cards back on the table and sighed.
Castiel had a shotgun strapped to his back and he could see the pistol on Jody’s hip, but neither one of them wanted to draw unwanted attention. Where the melee fighting in the street attracted other Lifeless to them, a gunshot could mean death. Dean wondered if their hearing and other senses were better now that they’d changed.
“I’ll… think about it,” Castiel said after a moment. He cleared his throat and an awkward silence fell between them.
“The wound on your shoulder was quite infected. It took me a day and a half just to break your fever. Thankfully, you didn’t fight much when I went to dress the wound or to take medication, but for a while I honestly wasn’t sure-” The man stopped mid-sentence and shook his head, looking back down into his bowl. “I wish we had some bread.”
“The sexual tension between you two is so uncomfortable.”
As soon as Dean saddled Crowley, Castiel slipped down from the hay bale. They climbed into the saddle, Castiel shaking his head at the offer to be at the front, and then they were off, trotting into the night and to the forest path. Dean carried a long stick with a lantern at the end, giving them enough light to see by as they made their way through the thick trees.
“We’ve waited long enough,” Castiel answered back and pressed their lips together again.
Of course Castiel would remember the Impala.
“As much as I come across as being independent, moving across the country by myself, I’m a very ‘social’ person.” Dean snorted at the air quotes, smiling fondly as Castiel continued on. “I don’t like being alone, I don’t... I don’t thrive on being alone. And I honestly don’t know if I could’ve made it this far without you, Dean.”
It had been almost a week since their near-run in at the barn. Five days in which they’d spent each night camped out in whatever cover they could find. It was too damn bad that they were in farm country, as the small groves of trees or scattered forests were making them backtrack more than anything before the sun set. The company, however, helped immensely, and despite the blisters reopening on Dean’s heels, he wouldn’t really change much. Other than the obvious, that is.
Castiel stayed at the door for a moment, watching her, and felt Kali and Gabriel slip off to the other side of the house. He stepped into the room and moved towards the nook, reaching down to squeeze Claire’s shoulder. “Well, what do you think?”
Castiel gasped as he's shoved through the door to their master bedroom, taking in the sight before them. The bed is large, possibly larger than the one he had at the castle, with a deep grey canopy covering it and sunlight pours in through the oversized windows.
Castiel reached forward, taking Dean’s hand in his own. He could feel Dean’s pulse where his thumb was pressed against the back of Cas’ hand, knew the thin layer of sweat gave away Dean’s nerves. And he tugged slightly, smiling as Dean leaned in towards him, pliable to whatever Castiel wanted.
If only Dean could have stayed so lucky.
Dean didn't respond, only moved in and sealed their lips together. The sounds of the night fell away as Dean kissed Castiel breathless, the rest of their words falling away as they explored each other in the grass. Tomorrow, Castiel would focus on business. Tonight, everything was about Dean.
“Hmm,” Castiel agreed, then gave a soft smile. “You know… you have a very pretty face. It’s very… symmetrical.”
He wanted a drink.
Dean clenched his jaw tight as he rolled his eyes up to the ceiling. He should just stay quiet, let Cas enjoy his newfound love for the classic Christmas songs Sam has been playing relentlessly, and yet -
“I was planning on getting us all some family counseling, just because there’s been so many changes, but…” he trailed off, suddenly overwhelmed with guilt. He was already screwing things up. Getting Claire into counseling should’ve been his first priority, and instead, they’d spent the last month getting the house ready, seeing Gabriel and Kali, having the kids meet his parents for the first time… He hung his head and jumped when he felt Jo touch his shoulder.
Castiel closed his eyes for a moment, then turned around and grabbed his briefcase. Claire stomped after him, grabbing the paper plate he’d left on the counter with her breakfast. She pushed past him out the front door and he sighed as he locked it behind them.
“You know, you’re going to hit a rock and faceplant,” he called out as she stumbled once, spinning around to flip him off. Her cheeks were as red as her hair and she beamed back at him.
“No, I never forgot you, Cas.” Dean cleared his throat, his cheeks turning slightly pink and he took a large gulp from his water glass. “I don’t know how I put it off for so long but… took me a few years to fuck up.” Dean gave another laugh, then shook his head. “Though, best fuck up I ever made.”
The passenger door opening, the car flooding with sudden yellow light, made him jump, and he turned to see Gabriel sliding in beside him. His older brother closed the door and immediately reached for the handle to recline the seat, falling back with a few clicks. Wherever he was, Gabriel never hesitated to make himself comfortable. Castiel envied him that ability. They stayed, silent, until the overhead light shut back off, the chill of the winter air starting to cut through the heat that had collected from the drive.
Dean clicked his tongue, his eyes far off as he recalled the story. "I was four when it happened... Michael and his soldiers came to the castle, promising fealty, troops, and gold. My father accepted them with open arms, not for a moment thinking anything would be wrong. I was just four, Cas, just a child and..." Dean's voice dropped and he closed his eyes. "They lit the Royal Chambers on fire, trapping us inside. I was able to escape with Sammy through the laundry chute, but my parents didn't make it."
“No, Dean,” Chuck cut him off, shaking his head. “You don’t.”
Dean looked down at the counter, a feeling of sadness for Castiel washing over him. Castiel deserved to be happy, deserved to have Inias, his best friend and his lover, here in his life. Dean hated that Castiel lost him. As if he could read his mind, Castiel reached across the countertop and laid his hand over Dean’s wrist.
Dean shivered as he sat up, reaching behind himself to tuck the sleeping bag around Cas’ shoulders so the cold air wouldn’t rush in and wake him. Castiel’s breath hitched before he continued snoring softly, with each exhale releasing a small puff Dean could see. They really needed to get warmer gear…
“Kelly said she had one of my business cards, she gave me a call yesterday. I hand over a set of keys, make sure no unexpected visitors come, and work on getting them set up with a new life. I only let you into the house because Jack knew you, but-"
“No,” Gabriel answered, sitting back up and taking Castiel’s other hand. “Like the Shurley Brothers. We’re even better than the Turtles.”
They sat on the dock until the candles were burned down, effectively leaving their past behind. As they walked hand in hand back to Jack and Kelly’s house, Dean was excited to see what tomorrow would bring.
Twenty-one was so young, and yet… Claire had always been headstrong, stubborn, and driven. Whatever she put her mind to, she ended up achieving. She was a successful artist, living comfortably off her oil and watercolor paintings, had bought a house in the last year, and was flourishing. Kaia had completed a computer engineering program and was in school for her Masters and she looked at Claire as if she hung the moon.
Kevin was a talker too, spending most of his days with Charlie as her assistant teacher unless Chuck had him out on a mission. Garth would flit about all of the groups, keeping an eye on the comings and goings of the camp and making sure everything ran smoothly. Despite being the most overly friendly, Garth was impenetrable. He let nothing slip, and he changed the subject smoothly if anyone was crossing into forbidden territory, without even letting on he was doing it.
“No! No, I just... Jack’s sleeping over there tonight and he invited Claire and I to stay for pizza…”
“This is why I don’t have the uterus in our relationship…”
As Dean trudged back through the trees, he heard something that made him stop, his heart hammering in his chest. He listened, frozen, as another twig to the left of him snapped. Whatever was moving towards him was heavy and trying its hardest to be quiet. He swallowed hard, cursing himself for not having grabbed a weapon when he left their camp.
Castiel felt himself flush and he didn’t bother to hide his smile. “I will miss you, Anna.” She made an offended sound and Castiel quickly amended his statement. “I mean, I will miss being woken up by you, walking these halls with you in the early hours before the rest of the castle has risen.”
Dean’s eyes widened and he found himself smiling. “Jack? Where is your mom’s car?”
“Charlie!” Dean warned, Castiel caught him as he tripped over the first step and nearly sprawled himself on the deck. Charlie threw the door open, her gun already raised, and they ran into Gilda holding a shotgun aimed right at them.
“We don’t have a choice, now come on,” Dean hissed back as they moved around the large, plastic wrapped rolls of hay. He heard Castiel muttering something under his breath, but Dean ignored him, instead focusing on the sounds ahead of them.
“Dean?” Castiel asked in alarm, looking around the area for some kind of threat. “What is it? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
“She’s tired. Every day is getting harder.”
“Well, at least it worked for the Klines, right?”
“No, I was at the hospital when the city really started to fall, and Inias was in the National Guard. We…” Castiel trailed off and cleared his throat, his hand slipping from Dean’s wrist to pick up his coffee mug. “We heard over the radio that the military had fallen.”
The bunker was aptly named - it was a large, round room cast out of what Dean assumed was melted down scrap metal, but he never bothered to ask. Either way, it was huge and it was hard to believe that they were beneath the kitchen right now. There were hanging lights that flickered a few times before turning on, casting everything in a bright yellow hue. Dean had done enough yardwork with his uncle to know there wasn’t a generator anywhere on the property that he had ever seen, or solar panels on the roof, and he wondered what Bobby had rigged up. Bobby was a crafty son of a bitch.
"I wanted to unite our kingdoms," Balthazar said slowly, leaning back against the seat as the carriage lurched forward. Castiel glanced out the window, watching until his home was out of view from where he sat. His throat suddenly felt tight and he blinked a few times, letting his attention drift back only when Balthazar cleared his throat.
“Dean and I have flashlights, and I found more batteries in Bobby’s desk.”
He was half asleep, floating warm and happy, when a scream ripped him fully awake. Beside him, Castiel jerked up into a sitting position, immediately reaching for his weapon. Dean was quick behind him, forgoing the machete to grab his pistol.
This morning, Castiel had already swallowed down the thick, pink medicine that was supposed to make him feel better and was picking at a plate of pancakes on the tray table. Gabe was underneath the covers beside him, nearly finished with his plate of french toast and bacon.
“Oh! Anna told me there were stables, she was going to show me them later this week.”
beef, and took a large share of steak tips that took up half of his plate. There was gravy and cream sauce, a pasta dish with olives and something that looked like mozzarella cheese. The pitchers turned out to be iced tea, and Dean accepted a full glass before returning to his seat.
” Chuck whispered, his hands gliding down the wooden closet doors at the back of his room as if he were caressing a lover. “
“You have a tattoo,” Castiel whispered, looking down at Dean’s naked chest, seeing the dark black sun outlined at the top of his chest. He reached forward and traced the outline of the pentagram in the center.
Instead, Dean was left with his thoughts. They turned back to Lisa and Ben, to the images of bodies on their own front lawns, and to the mistrust and panic in the eyes of the few people he’d run into. Hollywood wasn’t real, apocalypses weren’t real, and none of this made any sense. He tried to remember things Sam had said before the phone lines went down… if he’d known that was the last time he’d get to speak to his baby brother -
It had taken a while to get to this place. Lisa had taken Ben away just before his second birthday, telling Dean he needed to get his shit together before he lost them forever, and Dean had spiraled even further. Without Castiel, he’d been a wreck, but without Ben? There was nothing for Dean. Instead of drinking every night, he woke up and started instead. He was never found without a drink in his hand, except for when he was at work, and fuck if he wasn’t the luckiest son of a bitch there was for not losing his license or his job.
At the door, a tall man stood in a dark suit. He looked like a businessman from the TV, his face all serious and eyes all squinty. He looked over each of the brothers, then turned and left the room.
Immediately Dean was transported back to his childhood bedroom, Castiel’s body pressed against his, his skin soft and warm. Dean could still smell the Suave apple shampoo and the spring-rain scent of his deodorant. He heard his own words, echoed in his head, “This isn’t working anymore.”
"What... is it?" Castiel asked, shifting to look at it closer, making sure he didn't accidentally bump into it.
that it was the water that turned Uriel and Anna, but Dean’s gut told him there was no doubt. While Dean warred with the idea that someone like Dick fucking Roman would try to hurt billions of people for some sort of twisted monetary gain, Castiel seemed to feel guilty over the lives he was unable to save, his gaze lingering on the empty houses and makeshift memorials longer with each one they passed.
“I like you,” Dean said when he caught his breath and Meg winked, patting his cheek.
“It's a shame Dean decided to miss out,” Sam said after a moment and Dean watched as Cas’ face fell.
It was a flurry of activity as the rest of the group collected everything Castiel asked for, Benny  docking the ship on a small island which Jack proudly proclaimed was one of the ‘ducks’. He went on to try and explain how many ducks were in the chain of islands before Gilda screamed at him to “Shut the duck up!” and he scurried back above deck, telling Castiel to call him if he needed him.
“You don’t know me anymore,” Castiel whispered, but even he thought his voice fell flat.
Dean flinched as if Castiel had slapped him and he glanced to the side, his eyes wide and beautiful as he met Castiel’s gaze. Then he cleared his throat and looked away, the flush moving back over his cheeks.
Gabriel himself was manning the counter, his assistant Kevin was bent down and stocking a fresh batch of donuts, fresh from the fryer. Dean inhaled deeply and turned to Ben before his son could even ask. “Yes, we’re definitely getting some.”
“I already went to the shed! I pulled all of the camping gear to the front and Mom had kept boxes of Dad’s old clothing. Some of it fit both of you if you wanted to look.”
Charlie let out a shaky breath and nodded, reaching forward to ruffle Castiel’s still damp hair. “Alright, well,” she shook herself and sat up straight, “tomorrow morning, Chuck is going to conduct an interview with you both and with Jack to find out where to place you. What did you guys do pre-end of the world?”
They stayed locked on Dean’s own, full of so much emotion it made Dean’s own stomach twist. John’s voice was still in his head, “I missed out on the best parts of life, these chains are my burden to bear, don’t make them yours.”
Dean gave him a small smile and watched as Gabriel tried to pull back from their borderline chick flick moment.
His head was spinning with a million emotions and thoughts, all of which revolved around Dean Winchester.
“Don’t you dare say that, Dean Winchester!” Castiel hissed, the gentle hand gone as he grabbed Dean’s chin and forced his head to the side so he had no choice but to meet Castiel’s eyes. “I don’t know why Anna and Uriel changed, but it is
"I remember that... I could barely stand working through my first trimester with Jo." She looked up and smiled at Castiel over Dean's shoulder. "Dean, are you going to introduce me to your friend?"
“Hello, Ben,” Castiel said from the front door and Dean found himself smiling as he walked into the front hall to greet them. Jack and Ben were gone almost immediately, leaving Castiel holding a stuffed backpack and a pillow. “Wasn’t sure what you had,” he said with a shrug as Dean reached for them.
Castiel glanced over at Lucas before looking up front to where his mom was trying to hide her smile. He was just glad he wasn’t the one to ask it this time.
“Claire!” Castiel snapped, then looked at Jo. “Nothing like that, it was
Sam was met with silence and Dean held his breath. Then, slowly, the door creaked open.
“I promise, we don’t mean you any harm.”
“Shut up, Gabriel,” Castiel fired back, glaring at him. “It was not a booty call. Hell, it wasn’t anything like that! I just- I just saw him and we decided to catch up, that’s all.”
“Chuck knows everything,” Jesse replied with an eye roll, giving a friendly smile. “I believe he has different radios set up in his quarters, but I’ve never asked. He tells us what we need to know.”
“Yeah,” Charlie agreed, nodding her head, “but you’re so stuck in your own ‘presence’ and honestly? Your presence sucks. You’re miserable, you reek like alcohol and despair, and I could use a change of scenery. So! Up and at ‘em.”
“Your brother didn’t want anyone but us to find him,” Castiel said as he rejoined them, holding out the map. Dean just stared at him, glancing down at the map, then back up to his face. “Sam isn’t in Poughkeepsie, but he left this for us to find him.”
“Mostly,” Castiel answered with a laugh. “But, no, my days there were all run by my duties to our kingdom. Here, it’s… different. I’ve gone with Balthazar to meetings, of course. We’ve talked with the council and heard the townspeople’s complaints and concerns, but… even that didn’t feel like a job. It’s been amazing to watch how Balthazar interacts with his people, both hired hands and citizens.”
“I miss my family. I miss the ease of picking up the phone and finding out who Gabriel’s flame of the week is, hearing all about how this one was ‘the one’ because she was able to do a double shot of tequila without wincing.” Castiel gave a soft smile and Dean nodded, the ache he had from missing Sammy flaring strong in the center of his chest. “I even miss my mother’s phone calls, asking me when I’m going to settle down and get married, harassing me about taking a vacation.
smiling as they searched Dean’s face. “Close quarters and all that, but the past needs to stay there. For you
Together, they sat curled up on the bench, overlooking their new life together.
“Yeah, it is,” Dean answered, nodding his head. “Why? Does Jack want to do another sleepover?”
“ - then that would be a conversation Castiel would have with both you and Jack. I don’t think, no, I
“Castiel, are you going to say hi to your brother?”
Eileen nodded and reached over to pat Sam’s arm, looking up as Castiel entered the living room again carrying a glass bowl of dip. Castiel placed it on the coffee table, retaking up his seat on the couch and picking up his playing cards.
Vicki smiled and patted his good leg, shaking her head slowly. “Lucas is still very sick, Castiel. You and Gabriel are doing so well, that’s why you’re on the pediatric floor. I promise, we will visit Lucas as often as we can, okay?”
He pushed the thought away and instead focused on hanging up his coat and pulling off his gloves and boots. Gabriel, however, hadn’t returned yet and he took a deep breath, realizing he couldn’t put it off for much longer.
“No, Sam, perhaps that was the wrong word,” Cas argued back quickly, nodding at Eileen as she tugged the back of Sam’s shirt until the hunter took his seat again. “He was just… surprised, I guess, that I was staying.”
Claire was going down the same path as her mother and it terrified him. Even knowing that Castiel could be ruled as unfit, she was incapable of controlling herself. The path she was spiraling on made him turn to Meg and his brother, Gabriel. They both agreed and pushed him to make a change.
“You’re both ridiculous,” Castiel mumbled, turning to look out the front window. The drive had taken almost three hours with Dean having to reroute them several times to get around blockages in the roadways and steer them clear of cities that looked dangerous. Smaller towns were usually bare, but the countryside was flat, making it easy for them to see groups of Lifeless in fields. Driving, however, had given them the ability to see more of how the Lifeless acted.
Despite her crushing his head to her chest, Castiel found himself laughing. “I was dying to talk to you at dinner, but it didn’t seem like the appropriate place.”
Tears burned Dean’s eyes and he shook his head, groaning at the sudden wave of dizziness. No, Cas needed to
Anna quietly closed the bedroom door behind them and Castiel let out a slow breath. His bag was open, clothes from yesterday spilling out over the floor by his bed, the covers pulled back where he’d tried to sleep the night before. But everything else…
Dean glanced over to see himself as a child staring in wonder at Santa Claus, taking his time to place each present perfectly underneath the tree. Then he filled the stockings hanging by the fake, construction paper fireplace taped against the wall by the tree. John stopped and took a handful of cookies before he picked up the bag and started back out the front door.
Dean nodded, swallowing thickly and reaching up to wipe his eyes. “They found her in the hallway outside of my room.”
“That is only a taste of what the chains feel like,” John whispered, coming into view. His body was glowing a pale, green. If Dean wasn’t sure it was his bed he was feeling beneath him, he would’ve thought he was somewhere else entirely. All he could see was his father, dripping in chains that sparked against his skin.
Patrick is, but… I hope it works out with them. He seems like a good dude, and Ben likes him. That’s what matters, right?”
“Well, I’m going to go eat my lunch before recess is over, but I’ll see you tonight when I drop Jack off?” Castiel said, looking up and meeting Dean’s eyes.
Castiel swallowed thickly, the laughter gone from his face as his eyes flickered between Dean’s eyes and his mouth. “I… appreciate that, Dean.”
“Fuck, baby, you taste so good,” Dean whispered, bending down to kiss him, letting Castiel taste himself on his Alpha’s tongue. Castiel shifted, wrapping his arms around Dean's neck and holding him in place, groaning into his mouth as the Alpha slipped two fingers inside of his hole. It wouldn't take much, Castiel's body was craving his mate's, slick and stretched and ready, but the press of Dean's fingers inside of him made him dizzy with want, and he let his Alpha explore until he was moaning, breathless and impatient.
“But if I wasn’t here-”
“Bu-bu-but Mickey! Daddy! Lucas broked Mickey!” Castiel screamed, angry that
It was clear from the start how much they cared for one another, their playful banter made Castiel wish he’d grown up with siblings of his own. Sam pulled out stories of their childhood, working as hard as he could to try to embarass Dean -- like how he’d been caught by the Milton’s trying to snag a pie cooling from the windowsill, how he’d been playing tag with Sam and some of the other neighborhood kids and tripped, landing himself face first in a pig pit. Dean, for his part, gave it back as good as he got, and by the time they got to the edge of town, the three of them had tears pricking their eyes from laughing so hard.
Dean laughed and shook his head before dipping down to press their lips together. The Alpha's cock was heavy and thick where it pressed against Castiel's thigh, the scent of
“Well then explain it to me, Claire!” Castiel thundered back and Dean looked over at the boys, shaking his head when they looked like they were going to ask.
"You can't touch it... not yet. It's still healing..." Castiel watched his brother swallow hard, and looked up to see his eyes were shut. "They said I have to be really careful with it while it's healing."
“One of the older kids on the playground,” Jack answered, his voice now muffled in Dean’s shirt. “I told him he was a liar liar pants on fire, but-”
“Well, you ain’t exactly Father Christmas,” Benny replied, shrugging his shoulders. “Though, you might give The Grinch a run for his money, I ain’t about to sing that damn who-song.”
“Uh, yeah, little brother.” Dean looked over and up, and then chuckled. “Well, in age anyways. Castiel, this is Sammy. Sam, this is Cas.”
Castiel looked at the remaining food, safe for now but much too close to the fire, and nodded, following after Dean through the door into the foyer. A sudden popping sound made them jump before the sprinkler system kicked in, water spraying in all directions from the ceiling. They ran the rest of the way to the doors, Castiel unlocking them quickly and the pair jogging away from the winery.
“They’re good people,” Castiel answered, nodding his head. “No rush. Once you’re healed enough to travel, we’ll continue on to Sam.”
“Yeah, well, it does in the apocalypse.”
“Sorry,” Castiel said quickly, pulling him back. “Looks like it was probably from glass…” His fingers were gentle, but it still stung as he pressed around the wound. “No glass,” he announced, finally meeting Dean’s gaze with a smile. “Once you’re cleaned up, I found some skin glue in that kit and we’ll take care of it. You should probably take an antibiotic, too, just in case.”
Castiel sighed, the angry expression back on his face. “Yes, I’m fine, and
“You don’t answer a question with a question, Dean.”
From his spot, Castiel hugged Dean's back, his cheek flat against the Alpha's shoulder; he was able to breathe in Dean's scent, happy he would get to scent Dean -- his mate -- for the rest of his life. His hands moved to Dean's stomach, holding on tight.
By the time they reached Bobby’s driveway, all three of them were breathing hard and filthy, and Dean was grateful that out of all the blood on their hands and clothes, none of it was their own. The only sound around besides their breathing was the Singer’s Salvage Yard sign creaking in the slight breeze.
“You sure as hell treat him like he’s broken, brotha,” Benny answered, blitzing forward so he was standing before Dean and gave him a pointed look. “Though, he’s got the best lesson of all.”
Castiel hated hospitals. Even more so, he hated hospitals when someone he loved was laying in the hospital bed. Claire was very much awake, of course, the scowl only slightly askew on her face as she glared at him, royally pissed that he’d taken her to the hospital in the first place, but it didn’t calm his anxiety any.
Balthazar leaned forward, holding his glass for Castiel to toast him. "Well, I'd say this is a great start. Don't you, friend?"
“It’s alright,” Castiel reassured her, giving her a smile. “I don’t mind coming back another day or waiting.”
“Daddy will
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel whispered, reaching for his leg to give it a squeeze. He couldn’t imagine not seeing Jack for four years of his life, missing his first years of growing and learning. His heart ached for Dean.
When he was both dressed and full of food, he slipped into the corridor and headed towards the great hall. He’d made plans with Balthazar and Anna to visit the marketplace within the upcoming days, but he figured it wouldn’t hurt to visit more of the grounds on his own.
“Who is Bobby?” Charlie asked, but Dean ignored her in favor of spinning back around and pointing up at the words.
“Sorry for passing out on you yesterday, I guess,” Dean said, lifting the bowl to his lips to drain the rest of the broth. The man cocked his head to the side, a look of confusion flitting across his face.
Claire nodded and stuck her arm out for Jo. “No… just… saw it and took it.”
“The late King Michael ran things a little differently… and when he fell ill, King Balthazar tried to rule as his father had. But, before taking the crown, Balthazar was known by our people. He came into the city often, would share stories, food, and drink with what his father considered the common folk. When Balthazar took his father’s place, he found he couldn’t rule over his friends the way his father had.
It didn’t matter that he was sober now - since apparently the hospital forcing him to detox didn’t count - Lisa was firm on her stance that he would have no relationship with Ben if he didn’t go through rehab. He picked the easiest, cheapest program, and when he was discharged from the hospital, that’s where he went.
“I’m still really pissed at you,” she said against his shoulder, and Castiel gave her a squeeze in response. “Okay, hit the call bell if she starts throwing up or if there’s any other changes, okay? I’ll be around to check in on you.”
“You know…” Dean trailed off, listening to the sound of Castiel breathing for a moment to make sure he wasn’t asleep. “Washington DC isn’t that far away from New York…”
“It’s fine, Cas,” Dean answered quickly, then visibly flinched. “Sorry, Castiel. It’s okay.”
“But if I stay on ‘this path’, right?” Dean asked, watching Missouri nod and smile. She wiggled her fingers at him and Dean sighed, lifting his hand to place into hers. He closed his eyes and squeezed Missouri’s hand, gritting his teeth against the sensation.
Jack promptly stuck his tongue out at Claire and Castiel forced himself to blow out a slow breath.
He straightened his tunic, unnecessarily once more, and then reached for the door. He shook his head and bit back a laugh when it opened to reveal Anna, bouncing on the heels of her slippers, her hands clasped tightly in front of her.
“Yeah, Dad, I can live with the things that drive me nuts. Because there’s always a way for us to compromise or for me to let go or vice versa, you know?”
Dean raised an eyebrow and smirked. “Is that really what King Zachariah sounds like?”
Dean jogged after them, warning them both to be careful on the ladder since all of their shoes were wet from the spray. Charlie ignored him, still talking at rapid speed.
“I’m done!” Jack said at the same time Claire scoffed, “Who the hell wants to come hang out in a teenager’s room? That’s
Sam stiffened and sat up, shaking his head before he was even looking back at her. “I haven’t spoken to Dean in three years,” Sam replied, swallowing thickly. “He doesn’t remember Cas, doesn’t remember how important he was. And it…” Sam trailed off and shook his head again. “When Cas took Dean’s memories, Dean became jaded, angry. I mean, you saw it.”
"So what are your boys' plans for the evening?" Jessica asked as she sipped on her tea.
“Were you with him when he passed?” Jack asked and Dean bit his lower lip, holding his breath for the answer. He and Castiel had never really talked about Inias or Lisa together, only in passing.
The creature was silent, moving smoothly through the overgrown grass around the back of him, pouncing on his back and taking him down. For a moment, his heart skipped a beat and his mind supplied “Lisa”. Then the pain kicked in. He screamed, twisting away from the creature, its teeth and nails digging through his right shoulder as he jerked back. The scent of his blood only drove the thing mad, blood leaking in thick rivulets out of the corners of its eyes as it growled wildly and gnashed its teeth in the air. Dean kicked out, propelling himself back a foot and knocking the thing away.
“Her husband was beating the shit out of her, her and their son, Benjamin. I finally convinced her to leave him, I told her that no matter what, I would help her. She went the legal route and they took her into a woman’s shelter. He found them, though, and he picked Ben up at school, basically holding him hostage to convince Lisa to come home. So, I stepped in.”
Lucas let go and Castiel fell back against his car seat. Mickey, with his head half torn off, rested  on Castiel’s lap. Lucas broke Mickey! Castiel screamed and lashed out, slapping his brother hard across the face.
, Cas.”
morning. So, will you move in here with us? And I want you to be here, with me, with our kids… when I ask you to marry me. Because that’s going to happen, too. Because we’ve spent so many years apart that the thought of not spending another-”
When Dean blinked away the tears in his eyes, it was to see the sedan’s brake lights as Castiel started her up and then drove off, out of Dean’s life again. He didn’t remember dropping the bag of pie, but his phone was suddenly in his hand as he clung to it like a lifeline.
“Four days,” Jack replied. “Garth kept saying the ‘fifth’ day. Dean, what are we going to do?”
“Well, he’s a moron,” Sam replied and Eileen gave a small laugh. Dean swallowed hard, looking between them. He avoided Charlie’s gaze, knowing the redhead had her head turned and was looking at him.
Claire licked her lip and stared at him for a moment. “Yeah, well, just so you know? I wouldn’t mind.”
As they were leaving, Castiel locking the door behind them, Castiel had a look of pure excitement on his face. “You know,” he said as they started walking towards Dean’s car, “I really, really missed rides in Baby.”
Castiel gave a small snort and shook his head. “Do you think if you had put Dean in further danger then I wouldn’t have eliminated you?”
“What?” Sam replied, standing up from the chair, only stopping when both Eileen and Cas reached for him. “He can’t say that shit to you Cas, enough is enough!”
There were five liter plastic containers of water stacked against the third wall, directly across from the door, and a box of what Dean assumed was full of nonperishable items. When he pried the lid open, it contained dry rice, pasta, beans, and -
“The food,” Castiel said, but Dean shook his head.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean mumbled, untangling his legs from the blankets and reaching up to run sleep from his eyes.
But when he looked up, Castiel was gone, the echo of his words heavy in the air.
“No,” Charlie answered simply and Dean did look at her for that. “The feeling you have right now? The one that’s making you angry, the one that's making you lash out at me?” She shrugged and stood, clapping her hands in front of her. “You’re a dick, Winchester.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"The fireflies were always there, too," Dean said with a smile, lifting a hand to point to the side. Castiel turned his head and realized they were surrounded by the lime-green glow of hundreds of fireflies, blinking their lights as they weaved through the grass undisturbed by the humans laying there. He hadn't noticed them before, too focused on Dean. He closed his eyes and could hear their soft buzzing. "They were my favorite part."
“It's no big deal,” Dean mumbled with his back still turned. “It's not like Lisa is going to need them…”
“You said there were people in Poughkeepsie?” Dean asked, watching Sam nod.
He also forced himself not to look at the black Chevy Impala sitting in the third spot as he walked past.
As luck would have it, they were. However, the barn was chock full of farm gear, leaving very little space for them to squeeze in. As Dean secured the doors behind them, they stood in silence as they waited for their eyes to adjust. There was a thin stream of moonlight coming in from a crack in the roof.
that was the lucky one.
“They remind me of family. Of home, I guess.” Her voice was quiet and he opened his eyes then, moving back enough to look down at her. She was still leaning her head on his shoulder, her hands busy twisting the headphone cord around her fingers. “I’ve been listening to them a lot lately.”
“He knows he’s family,” Dean said to her, talking over the hushed reassurances Sam was giving Cas. “He’s always been family.”
Dean gave a short laugh and nodded. “Yeah, she’s a teenager,” Dean replied with a shrug. “I’m glad she feels comfortable enough with me.”
Jo nodded and bent down, coming back up with two tankards. “He came in a little while ago, but he’s at The Bunker. Mom made up a few roast turkeys and all the fixins for dinner, I can pack you up a basket if you want to head over there with some food.”
Mickey and Lucas was crushing his head!
Dean nodded and went to the SUV, pulling out his katana. “Benny and I will clear the house,” he said as Jack came over to the side of the car with him. “You and Cas stay here with the girls,” he ordered and Jack nodded quickly, reaching in for the diaper bag and sliding it over his shoulder.
Beside him, Charlie snorted and Dean rolled his eyes behind his arm. “Well, if you’re sober, this will go a lot faster. Come on, up and at ‘em, cowboy!”
They crouched down beside a small restaurant, just barely able to see the sign for The 4th Street Tap with its large Pabst beer advertisement. Charlie was running her hands along the side of the building when Dean suddenly noticed the mural. It was a well kept painting depicting an ocean scene, but what was on it… Dean stopped, cocking his head as he tried to put together what he was looking at.
“Harder,” Uriel grunted, the door jerking forward again. “Hold it!”
Castiel, Gabriel, and Lucas sighed together.
For the first time since Wednesday night, when he’d called Sam over in a panic over Castiel, he felt at peace. He wasn’t worried about bumping into the other man, he wasn’t bogged down with what could’ve been and what had been. He wasn’t craving anything other than another story and an excited rambling of his nine-year-old.
“Do you think we’ll actually get to see Mickey and Minnie? And Pluto and Goofy and Donald Duck?”
Jesse swore but Dean twisted and pushed up out of the chair only to be met with the barrel of his own gun.
“That they are buddy,” Castiel laughed.
Castiel just nodded, looking out over the ruined winery.
In the dark, Dean reached forward, finding Cas’ hand easily. He felt the other man’s hesitation for a moment, then smiled when Castiel threaded their fingers together. He didn’t know what to think, but everything was warm and pleasant and felt
- it was still not the most comfortable talking to Sam about this. Dean was the big brother, the one who was supposed to support, help, and provide for his younger brother. He didn’t know how to get their roles reversed once more.
“Morning,” Dean greeted, smiling at Castiel, and Claire snorted beside them. Dean’s eyes flicked over to her and she smirked back at him.
They were quiet, and while Castiel was probably thinking about Sam and their travels to Poughkeepsie, Dean was thinking of another brother.
Castiel thought of the boys, both strong and independent in their own ways - Jack curious and inquisitive, flourishing now that he was in high school and able to pick up more science classes. Ben was smart and charming, so much like his father, and had been putting his head together with his Uncle Sammy to pick out engineering colleges for the following year.
“Dude, it’s been like two minutes. You haven’t even tried.” But Dean smiled, understanding what Cas meant. His own brain wasn’t shutting off easily…
“Ketch, no!” the man in Castiel’s grip gasped and tried to twist free. The sound of the gun going off made Dean’s entire body tense, but it wasn’t until two more shots rang out that pain erupted down Dean’s leg.
Claire nodded and looked away, a smile still playing on her lips. Castiel waited, knowing she would tell him whatever it was that was on her mind. The most important lesson he’d ever learned from Claire was that of patience. He didn’t have to wait long before she blurted out, “I’m going to ask Kaia to marry me.”
“You guys don’t even know me,” Charlie whispered, her hair falling forward again and hiding her face from Dean’s view.
“Where’s…. Where is his body?”
Charlie shrugged, pushing away from the railing and turning her back on the town. “There’s  nothing we can do about it, Castiel,” she said calmly. “We got out who we could, we took out what we could, and now we need to move on.”
“So?” Dean sighed. “What’s that got to do with the price of tea in China?”
“I will. And I’ll… well, I bring Ben back to Lisa’s around four. I can drop Jack off then unless you need to pick him up earlier?”
“You saw him?” Castiel looked up again, watching the smile on his sister’s face.
Castiel looked up from his coloring book and saw nurse Vicki walking into the room, a huge smile on her face. She immediately came to the side of the bed and sat down on the end, looking between him and Gabriel with a wide smile on her face.
Jack looked uncomfortable as a girl younger than him came from behind to pick up their plates and glasses, and Dean wanted to laugh at how for the first time since they’d arrived here, he was on board with Jack’s line of thinking. When the table was cleared, a hush fell over the room and Chuck stood, his arms out wide once more.
Castiel felt his own face flush and he kept his eyes trained on the side of Dean’s neck, not wanting to see the waiter’s expression, just knowing the man had heard him. Dean swallowed hard, his pulse beating rapidly against his throat, and he nodded.
“I told them to go play for a bit,” Meg said with a shrug. “We can all digest a bit before dessert.”
“You’re here! You’re here!” she kept repeating, not letting him go until Michael cleared his throat pointedly and took his spot where Anna was, giving Castiel the friendliest hug he’d ever received from the eldest Novak - outside of Michael being drunk.
“Let's go out back! Mom said we can use the trampoline!”
Castiel chuckled at Jack’s slightly muffled voice coming from somewhere near Gabe.
“Oh fuck you!” Dean called out, but Charlie was gone.
Castiel made a small noise of surprise and Dean smiled as he watched him return the hug, his eyes closed as he listened to whatever Sam was whispering in his ear. When Sam pulled back, Castiel clapped him on the shoulder and nodded.
“You got it, kiddo,” Gabriel said with a wink, picking up a particularly gooey strawberry croissant for himself. He looked at Castiel and gave a “go on” nod before leaning back against the car. “Kali should be here soon, she just had to stop at the office.”
“I’ve told you a hundred times, Dean-o. You don’t have to be sorry. I appreciate the apology, I do. But dude, I’m your friend. I got your back. I was worried about you, okay? I don’t-” Gabriel sighed and shook his head, popping his gum once more. “Look, whatever happened with you and Cas happened, but you were just like my pain in the ass little brother, too. I wasn’t there for Cas, I was there for
Dean climbed on the back of Sam’s snowmobile, muttering “This is the only time I’ll let you drive my ass anywhere,”  causing his brother to bust out laughing before he flipped the ignition. The rest of the group climbed onto a snowmobile, and then they were off.
The most brilliant smile stretched over Dean’s mouth, his eyes wet with tears, and then he reached his free hand up, cupping the back of Castiel’s head and drawing them closer. Castiel went willingly, as if anything could keep him from this, from Dean.
“It’s called a pilot, Castiel.” Lucas rolled his eyes and shifted further away in his seat to look out the window. Castiel hoped he was doing what Dad said and was going to go to sleep.
He pulled the cap off and started coloring the side of Lucas' bandage he could reach. Lucas winced once, but shook his head when Gabriel asked if he should stop. When he was finished, he handed the marker for Castiel to do the other side. Castiel did his very best coloring, making sure there weren't any huge white spots left and that he didn't slip and poke Lucas in the eyeball or his mouth. When he recapped the marker, he and Gabriel both leaned back to survey their coloring job.
Behind them, Uriel was shifting the bodies, making his way to Anna. He could hear them talking softly, but Dean’s eyes were stuck on Castiel’s worried gaze.  Castiel swallowed hard, his eyes shining and Dean opened his mouth, finding there were no words.
“You’re here to show me --” Dean cut himself off, jerking back as Benny reached for him again. He glared up at his former friend and shook his head. “Christmas Past? What is this, the fucking Christmas Carol? Are you
“That’s a bad word, Claire,” Jack quipped back, immediately lifting his arms as a blonde teenager with a snarl that could rival Sammy’s bitch face came around the side of Dean. She was glaring at him, probably wondering what a grown man was doing with her brother, and Dean raised a brow as he took a step backwards.
“Ben! Let’s go!” Dean called up the stairs, knocking his knuckles against the wall for emphasis. His son definitely got his time management skills from his mother…
“Chuck!” Mommy screamed and then there was an awful sound followed by total, dark silence.
“Cream or sugar?” Castiel asked, trailing off as Dean picked up the mug and took a healthy sip. “Guess not.” Castiel turned to dump a spoonful of sugar into his cup before returning to sit beside Dean. They were quiet for another moment before Castiel sighed. “I am truly sorry, Dean. I shouldn’t have punched you.”
“Frodo never sent Sam away, not in the books. In the film, it was purely for cinematic effect,” Dean replied, watching the small smile twitch at the corner of Charlie’s mouth. “In reality, Sam never would’ve left Frodo, because their friendship, their mission, meant everything to him. And despite Frodo’s trust in Smeagol? Sam didn’t trust Gollum.
was scrawled in thick, red car paint. This close, Dean could see the metallic flakes in it, but from back in the driveway…
Dean glanced over at her and was suddenly hit with the scent of alcohol. He forced himself to breathe through his mouth and took half a step back. “Uh… did she… do it on purpose?”
“Dean?”
Castiel smiled and let his head rest against his elbow. He was quiet for a moment, thinking of everything he’d seen of Balthazar. “He’s a good King.”
Dean looked up as Castiel gave him a squeeze, but Castiel’s eyes were still focused on Jack. “I miss him,” Castiel admitted. “He had so much life in him; sometimes I wonder why he was taken and not me. But I know that he would’ve wanted me to keep fighting, to move on. I try to live by that every day that I am given.”
Castiel gave a small laugh and shook his head. “I think we were much more than that.” Dean didn’t answer, not that Castiel really expected him to, and the silence that stretched between them was awkward. “I’m sorry… I meant, thank you for the coffee.”
The girls nodded at him, lost in their own world. They all took turns offering their congratulations, shaking off Gilda’s offer to hold the baby.
“We have a lot to catch up on,” Dean started, reaching for Castiel’s arm and moving his hand down to take Cas’ hand in his own. “But… this is Castiel. He saved my life, a few times over, and… he’s…” Dean hesitated, glancing over at him. Castiel squeezed his hand, giving Dean the go-ahead to say whatever he wanted for them. “He’s my partner. He’s… everything.”
Though his parents had since come around about Castiel’s sexuality, he was more than aware that their ‘coming around’ had been done when he was in a relationship with a woman and their wishes were focused on getting him and their grandchild back down for visits. It wasn’t even really his father; Naomi was the one who controlled their household growing up, made sure their outward appearances were perfect, and kept the entire house in line. When he had told her at fifteen that he thought he was bisexual, she’d promptly dismissed him and told him it was a ‘phase’, then made it mandatory for both he and Gabriel to participate in any Church events. His relationship with Dean had put a significant strain on the family through Castiel’s high school years, Naomi going out of her way to ignore everything and anything about it.
Sam nodded and stood, leaning over the counter to turn the water off. “You do. Stop thinking about it, Dean, okay? Seriously, I know you. You’re going to drive yourself crazy. Isn’t Ben coming this weekend?”
“Oh, yeah. I mean, no, you, Claire, and Ben are welcome here any time. It’s nice having other people around, you know? And, uh,” Dean hesitated, swallowing hard and reaching up to scratch the back of his neck, “we’re friends, right?”
instead of talking himself in circles before the news simply… stopped reporting.
I got a few chapters written, so, surprise! Early chapter ((there will still be one posted on Saturday))
“Get off me,” Castiel grumbled, jerking his knee up again. Gabriel looked down at him, hesitating, but finally conceded and stood, allowing Castiel to at least sit up on one of the cushions before throwing himself back down.
kind of conversation with him. As he walked over to pull open each of the drawers on the desk, checking out their size, he forced himself not to analyze how he just enjoyed having the other man walking beside him.
Dean took a moment to realize he wasn’t talking about the baby anymore and he threaded their fingers together, squeezing his hand. “I mean, I’m glad you did. But, Cas… it would’ve been okay if you hadn’t saved me. Just knowing that you, Jack, and the rest of them were going to be safe? I mean…” Dean gave a small huff, shrugging his shoulders in Cas’ embrace. “I was prepared for that to be my end,” Dean whispered.
“Stop him, Sam! Stop him!” Dean whispered, stepping close to his brother’s back, his eyes wide as he watched Castiel pick up the bowl.
He pulled into the parking lot at the same time Dean arrived.
“I’m sorry, Lis,” he whispered, though for the life of him… he wasn’t sure what it was he was apologizing for anymore.
It would definitely work better than the hunting knife as far as killing the Lifeless went… he sucekd with a bow and arrow, Sam was definitely a better archer. He looked up as Castiel walked over with a few of the books, his eyes trained on the weapon in Dean’s hand. Dean laid the machete down in favor of bending down to pick up a heavy-duty rucksack from Bobby’s stash, holding it open for Castiel to situate the few books. “Go ahead,” Dean prompted when he noticed Castiel’s gaze continuing to return to a bright-blue handled katana.
“You’ll find other early morning adventures to fill your time, I’m sure,” Anna said back, but the tightening of her arm told him she felt the same. “Is there anything else you need to have sent?”
Chuck had never been much of a hugger, and Castiel hadn’t expected him to start now. Their father looked up and gave a curt nod, the corner of his mouth turning up into a smile as he reached over and patted the couch beside him, inviting Castiel to sit. Castiel followed his brother’s lead, jumping as his father laid a hand on his arm.
“I’m yours,” Dean whispered and Castiel smirked, pushing up to his feet and twisting them around before Dean could even take a breath. Then he was falling onto the bed, his legs falling open wide. Castiel made quick work of the rest of their clothes, then climbed onto the bed on his side. Dean turned to face him and they came together once more.
Dean yelled, jerking back, the feeling of chains back around his throat. “No! No, I can fix this, I
Castiel looked confused, shaking his head as he turned away from Dean back to Charlie. “I’m not sure if I can handle two of you,” he muttered and Charlie let out a sharp laugh, dropping her legs down to the floor to lean her arms on the desk instead.
The boy across the street was Jack Kline, the child Castiel had called CPS on earlier in the week. Which meant, the man chasing after him and lobbing snowballs at him,
Uriel was crouched over Anna’s body, his sweatshirt removed, and he was busy ripping it, presumably to take care of her wound. Alfie was peeking into the room, his eyes wide and terrified. Castiel was focusing on anything but Dean, and despite that being the least of his worries, that was the only thing Dean could focus on.
Dean shuffled down the road, his knife held slack in his right hand, and prayed.
Castiel made a soft noise of protest, pressing his nose against Dean’s throat and exhaling. “Thank you for being here.”
Dean reached up with his free hand to rub his forehead. “There’s not… we don’t have ‘unresolved’ sexual tension. We just have a history.”
holiday and she just
“To be honest, man, I’m not mad. I get where you were coming from. Though,” Dean let the peas slide to his lap and he turned fully, meeting Castiel’s gaze head on, “despite the douchebag deserving it? I know from experience you don’t get too far by punching every asshole who beats on his family.” Dean shrugged again and picked at the corner of the frozen vegetable bag. “It’s part of why I do what I do.”
“Dean, come on!” Castiel was bordering on begging and Dean bit the inside of his cheek, trying not to laugh.
He felt the moment his words registered, Castiel’s entire body stiffening against him before he relaxed again into Dean’s back.
“Then we will find him, Dean,” Castiel replied, as if it was that simple. “Your brother left you a direction back in Sioux Falls, and he wouldn’t leave this city without leaving you another. We will find him, Dean. I feel it in my bones.”
Castiel glanced up, meeting Dean’s eyes questioningly. Dean swallowed hard and Castiel smiled, nodding his head in understanding. He leaned in, kissing Castiel softly. Castiel washed the rest of Dean’s body before handing over the washcloth for Dean to do the same for him.
Castiel breathed out and downed the rest of his wine, focusing on the burn for a moment before he sighed. “That’s what we said tonight.”
“They can’t hear you,” Missouri supplied helpfully and Dean glared at her before crossing the room to stand over them.
It was one of the last moments of clarity that Dean had had… the last moment of normalcy. Sam had kept him calm and convinced him to call 911, but the instructions he received were baffling. Unphased, they brushed him off and gave him a number to report to before hanging up. Their house hadn’t been the only one affected, nor was it the first. It took almost another twenty-four hours for random “violent attacks” and “domestic violence” to turn into a state of emergency.
Dean snorted a laugh and nodded his head, clapping Castiel on the shoulder before taking off down the driveway towards the Novak house. Castiel caught up with him quickly and met Dean on the porch, opening the door and waving him in. Though it had been years since Dean had been in the Novak house – at least to Castiel’s knowledge – he kicked off his boots and hung up his jacket before heading towards the kitchen.
“No,” Gabe replied, shaking his head. “Lucas?”
They worked together side by side to cook dinner, Castiel chopping up some vegetables to roast and Dean making a fresh alfredo sauce. As the pasta was cooking, Castiel pressed Dean into the corner of the counters, kissing him until the pasta water boiled over.
Castiel reached up, starting to run a hand over his mouth before he jerked back, staring at his fingers. He wiped them on his jeans, shaking his head as he said, “I can’t… water gets tested, though. It goes through - Gabriel said the virus was easy to spot under a microscope, there’s no way a water filtration -”
Castiel tied Phoenix’s reins to the post outside of The Roadhouse, nodding his head to the gentleman who held open the door. Inside was just as busy and loud as the last time he’d been there, and he noticed Ellen and Jo moving their way flawlessly behind the counter as they served the thirsty patrons. He smiled, weaving his way through the people to the counter and caught Jo’s attention.
of the hatch to below deck that made any thoughts of crawling back into bed disappear.
He heard the sound of china clinking and he darted for the kitchen, hoping it was Sam he would find and not himself.
“I have always given a shit, Dean. I turned my back on my brothers and sisters, forsaken my heaven and God for you and your brother. And I have never, for a single moment, regretted that. I have been first in line as your personal punching bag, the one you easily lay blame to, despite me making mistakes and decisions similar to those you and Sam yourselves have made. I have watched you fail and fall and picked you up, lent you support, believed in you… and never been given the same courtesy. Instead, I’ve been insulted and ostracized, second guessed and handled with ‘kid gloves’. I refuse to play that game any longer.
“On it,” Dean agreed and slipped out of the room and grabbed the intake paperwork on his chest pain case, then found Jo coming out of ED-3. “Jo.”
As they arrived at the Hudson River, Benny led them as close to the Hudson Walking Bridge as he could get without actually driving over it and parked, getting out to stretch his legs with Jack. Dean parked the Kia beside him and glanced over at Castiel, the other man nodding his head.
They dried off and, after Castiel took a quick look at Dean’s leg, dressed quickly, refolding their things and stopping at the sinks to brush their teeth. As they were leaving, Dean smiled and reached back, Castiel’s hand finding his own and twisting their fingers together. They paused at the door and Castiel reached up to turn off the lights before they left the bathroom.
He groaned and reached blindly for the edge of the table, grabbing it as leverage to haul himself up into a sitting position. He reached down and pulled his pant leg up, hissing out loud as he saw the dark, raised imprint of chains snaking up from his ankle.
“Yeah, well,” Dean said, waiting for Castiel to look over at him, “we have a tendency to pick up strays. And we need good people around us.”
Castiel swallowed hard, forcing himself not to show any reaction. He was silently cursing himself for not looking into the history of the Kingdom he was now living and ruling in… He cleared his throat, eyes trained on Dean as he continued singing, and said instead, “I thought the Late King was King Michael.”
her music, but honestly, he would take the quiet moment with her like this, even if it meant a headache.
“You just don’t get it!” Claire’s sudden scream made Dean jerk out of his thoughts, the boys startling awake beside him. The back door slammed open against the side of the house and Dean winced, hoping it hadn’t dented the siding.
“Where were we?” he asked, eyes focused on the cards in his hands.
Dean smiled then. The mix of emotions he suddenly felt was overwhelming. He was torn between agreeing, telling Cas that despite everything, his life was better thanks to Cas being in it, and reaching for his go-to defense.
When he set the glass down, Castiel leaned against the counter and looked at him. Dean reached up to wipe the tears from his eyes and then chuckled, shaking his head. “I’m sorry, I just… it’s really not funny.”
Castiel gave a small smile. While he had been closer to Gabriel, Anna and Jimmy were closest outside of the twins. Out of anyone in the house, Anna would probably understand. He thought it over for a moment, then nodded.
“I’m Castiel,” Cas said finally, reaching forward to shake her hand, “and this is Dean.”
It didn’t matter that his brain was yelling it was for the kids. He quickly filled out his information and handed back the phone, his own pinging a second later as Castiel texted him a ‘Hello’ text.
“I don’t know if the second one will be an option for much longer… or at least, I hope it won’t be.”
Claire’s eyes lit up as she took in the overflowing box of danishes, croissants, cinnamon twists, and muffins, all a variety of flavors. “Thanks, Gabe!” she said as she reached in, pulling a lemon danish out. For once since they’d left New York, she looked
“Oh, I… I’m sorry… were you talking to me?” he managed to get out. He cleared his throat and forced himself to stand taller; he was the crowned prince! He had no reason to feel nervous.
“What-” Dean blinked, realizing he was looking out of a window in a motel, rain pounding down against the glass. Although he couldn’t remember the last Christmas he’d had with his parents, as soon as he turned around and looked around the motel room, he knew this one.
“Claire, I don’t mind you asking me any questions, okay? But… I’m not sure if that’s an appropriate topic of conversation for us to have, okay?”
Vicki nodded instead of answering and knocked on the wall, pushing the curtain back enough for Gabriel to push the chair through.
The three of them fell silent for a moment and Dean looked around the small kitchen, noticing signs of Kelly in every corner. He knew from experience what it was like to lose a mom, and while Jack had been lucky enough to spend many years with his, the pain was still one and the same. He thought of how his father never let go of losing Mary. Their mom was a constant reminder in the Winchester family until even her memory had become tainted and dark. It wasn’t until they’d moved away from their dad and into Uncle Bobby’s that Dean was able to really grieve for his mother, and that was twelve years after she’d passed.
“Leave him alone.”
, through the two children our love created. Instead, I was driven to madness.”
The water felt good pounding down on his shoulders, but it was nothing to the hard, hot lines of Castiel pressed against him. “Shit,” Dean whispered into the side of Castiel’s neck before letting his forehead drop to rest against Castiel’s shoulder. He gave a small laugh, his tongue darting out to lick the water from Castiel’s skin. “You feel so fucking good.”
“Alright, lets get everything packed up tonight as best as we can, and we’ll leave in the morning at first light,” Benny instructed and the group nodded in agreement.
Dean pulled one of the blankets free, handing it over to Charlie, and found himself burying his nose into the sleeping bag. It smelled of Castiel and Dean found himself smiling again, his eyes closing, and soon fell asleep.
He stayed in front of the open fridge for longer than necessary, searching for something he knew wasn’t there. Then, finally, he reached in and grabbed the first thing, kicking the door shut with his foot and turning toward Sam again with a carton of milk.
The doors swung shut behind them, making Dean start, and Garth chuckled.
“Shit, brother,” Benny whispered and Dean looked up to see the Cajun looking at the Lifeless. Then Benny grunted as Jesse moved, slamming himself into Benny’s legs and taking them both down.
Dean nodded and started pulling open cabinets. These were all empty except the far cabinet where there were a few cans of soup and crackers. Dean was smiling as he pulled them down. “These were Sammy’s and my favorites,” he said fondly, running a thumb over the label before putting them on the counter. He would toss them in his bag later.
“You just going to stand out there?” Castiel asked, his voice lower than usual and it made Dean’s breath hitch.
“Good afternoon,” he greeted as he crouched down, scratching the cat behind the ears. Baby began purring, rubbing his head against Castiel’s fingers before moving around to mark each of his legs. Castiel chuckled and then scooped the cat up, continuing to pet him as he walked towards the barn.
His stomach twisted at the idea of food, so he left his pack by the door and stretched out on his right side, curling up with the blanket. Despite everything feeling heavy, he couldn’t sleep. The swaying of the boat on the water was making him nauseous and he was glad he hadn’t forced himself to eat.
Instead, he ignored her and pushed forward. Castiel placed the bowl down on the dresser, looking at future-Dean, passed out on his stomach, a look of discontent on his face, even in sleep. Dean wanted to scream, but he could only watch as Castiel finished off the spell, the light fizzing out into a powder blue smoke that filled the room.
A second set of hands joined Castiel’s and then pillows were shoved behind him, propping him up into a sitting position. Dean’s eyes felt like they were glued shut and he barely managed to open one before there was a warm, wet cloth running over his face.
“You didn’t answer me,” Gabriel said, nudging Castiel’s leg with his foot. “Hottie McWinchester, a midnight booty call?”
“Cas, you’re family,” Sam whispered, setting the mug down on the bedside table. His eyes trailed over the spellwork on the bed, then returned to Castiel.
There was a soft glow coming from the bottom of the house, the kitchen he assumed, but it did nothing to mar the beauty of the land around them. There were hundreds, maybe even thousands of fireflies blinking lazily around the meadow. The river and the scent of the few remaining wild flowers and changing leaves, gave the perfect ambiance.
“Do you know what this is, Dean?” Chuck asked, accepting the bottle from Garth and placing it on the desk in front of him. His fingers trailed down the side of the plastic, but his eyes were trained on Dean’s face.
"I find iron-work to be fascinating," Castiel said, giving Bobby a genuine smile. "I would be happy to see your craft one day."
Dean spent two days hiding out in the crypt, keeping up with Tylenol and changing the bandage on his arm until the gauze ran out.
“Uh, you too, Meg,” he answered, giving her a nervous smile. “You’re very important to Cas.”
They’d made it through Lake Michigan, slowing down through the Strait of Mackinac, and were just coasting through Lake Huron when it happened. Dean was leaning over the railing, looking out at the water. They were in Canada now, or so he thought, it depended on how far north on the lake they were. Part of him wondered if Canada was any different than the US, if they’d had fewer cases, more real humans left…
“Oh no,” he whispered, leaning his head back against the seat. Claire had a crush. He was so not ready for teenage dating… He looked in the rearview mirror, seeing Jack had looked up when he spoke. “You’re not allowed to date until you’re forty.”
“Nothing,” Castiel answered softly, shaking his head. “You’re just an amazing man, Dean Winchester.” He leaned forward, kissing Dean gently before pulling himself up from the deck. Dean sat there for a moment, surprised, before he reached out and grabbed the leg of Cas’ pants.
He started cleaning up the kitchen, then ordered up two large pizzas. As he started picking up the living room, the doorbell rang and Dean winced at the screech his son let out, stomping down the stairs as if there were seven kids coming down them instead of the one.
“Here goes nothing,” he muttered to himself as he walked with the bike towards the side door, hoping that the creature was still busy next door and that he was alone.
“I knew it!” Dean yelled, jerking his arm out and sloshing half his drink on Sam’s reindeer pants. Eileen had insisted they all get holiday pajamas — Dean’s were laying over the back of his chair. “Sorry Sammy.”
Dean licked his lower lip and looked up, something catching his eye from between the bare, stretching branches. He ducked his head and squinted, then started walking forward.
Slowly, Castiel reached over and took the lighter from his fingers, returning to lay his hand over Jack’s on the candle. “Then we’ll wait. When you’re ready, we’ll light a candle for her.”
“Since the first day you came to us, Dean, you haven’t trusted us. It seems to be… ingrained in you, really. A gut reaction, perhaps?” Chuck cocked his head but clearly didn’t expect a response, folding his arms over his chest as he continued, “You’ve been watching everyone around you, putting off your don’t-care attitude, all while manipulating what you could to gather information. Jesse told you what I asked him to, of course, but it was your boy, Jack, sneaking after them in my storeroom that truly tipped me off to your intentions.”
“Awesome!” Ben gave a fist pump, nearly skipping up to the counter. Gabriel finished with his current customer, then immediately turned his attention to Ben pressed up against the glass.
When he focused his attention back, Dean’s eyes were locked on him.
it. Though Charlie was very open about being gay, and would gladly tell Claire if she asked, it wasn’t really his place to share the information first. If he implied it and she got it on her own? Well, Claire was a smart kid. “So, you and Mr. Cas used to date though, right?”
“Lisa found out, of course. She saw the signs, and then I got into another accident. Wrapped the Impala around a tree, and Lisa was gone. Wouldn’t let me see Ben… I’d managed two months sober then, not counting being in the hospital. I was angry at Lisa, I was angry at Sam, I was angry at my dad… Ben was almost two and I didn’t see him again until he was six.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you mad,” Jack whispered, looking down and toeing the ground.
“Life can be uncertain when you’re only eighteen years old. I was scared, Cas. I was fucking
“Hot chocolate! Dad, can I get hot chocolate?”
“I’ll swing by and pick him up tomorrow afternoon,” Castiel said as he started down the steps.
“Say you’ll be my mate, Alpha.”
Dean hissed at the sudden sting, jerking back slightly.
“Alright Ben, I’m going to the bathroom real quick. Stay at the table and make sure you ask the waiter for ketchup. Got it, dude?” He smiled and held out his closed fist, Ben immediately knocking their knuckles together.
Then, it was just Dean and Castiel alone. Castiel broke the silence that had fallen between them first, turning in the seat so he was facing Dean.
“Chase is on the case!” Jack answered, then started making police siren sounds as he ‘drove’ himself over to the cabinet, much like his favorite cartoon character. Castiel was already resigned to the fact, through his own son and the grades he taught, that he would never be free of Paw Patrol.
Beside him, Dean suddenly paled and Castiel opened his mouth to tell Dean that he really didn't have to get up and sing, not if he didn't want to. But before he could say anything, Dean was shaking his hands out and standing up, reaching back to squeeze Castiel's arm once before he moved away from the bar and started going around the tables. Castiel shifted, leaning his arm on the bar so he could see around the room easier. The once loud, crowded bar seemed more subdued somehow, everyone sitting in their seats or leaning against the walls to watch as Dean took his place at the front table.
“I was,” Dean admitted and sighed, “but that’s not an excuse. People hurt all the time, what I did… the way I chose to cope -” he stopped and shook his head. “I’m an alcoholic, Cas. It runs in the family, and who knows? I could’ve had a problem anyway. What happened between us didn’t
“You’re alright.”
“Don’t worry, Cassie,” Gabriel said softly after a moment, when they were both sure she was gone. “I won’t let us get separated.”
Dean flashed a brilliant smile and turned, though he quickly fell in line beside Castiel as they continued down the path. Castiel found himself stealing glances to the side, and if the Alpha’s smirk was anything to go by, Dean was completely aware he was doing it.
“You told him what?” Dean demanded, fingers itching at his sides.
“Surprise,” Balthazar whispered, reaching down to take his mate’s hand.
"I can already tell you're going to be trouble..." he muttered, shaking his head before turning back around and striding forward as the line moved. The three brother's stayed in their line, Gabriel with a hand on Castiel's back to keep them together. None of them needed to be told again.
“Oh?” Naomi sat up straighter, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “Things are going well then? Is there going to be a grandchild in my future?”
“Alright,” Dean agreed, looking up as Jack came bouncing back over to them, his hair still damp and flinging droplets of water.
The dark red skin around his neck and face that wasn't covered looked twisted, soft and hard at the same time. Slowly, Castiel lifted his hand to touch but Lucas shook his head.
As he was pulling the meat off the grill, he felt a light hand on his shoulder and looked over to see his mother standing beside him, a soft smile on her face.
The comment did nothing to curb Dean’s laughter, and he fell to his knees, laughing until tears were streaming down his face. Castiel gave a soft huff of a laugh and ignored him, going through their things until he found a flashlight to turn on so he could shut and lock the closet door.
“Baltha-“ Castiel turned his head in alarm, but Balthazar shook his head, squeezing Castiel’s hand in warning, his eyes never leaving the page.
Castiel nodded at that, he understood that more than Dean knew. He’d had the same type of relationship with Kelly. Though he loved her, too, in his own way, she knew that his heart wasn’t fully hers.
“Anna, I told you to stay put!”
“Did you ever stop to think,” Claire sobbed, spinning around in the middle of the yard to face him again, “that if
Castiel stared just as hard as Dean tried not to, watching the deep red flush that moved up the back of his neck and over his ears. Beside him, Jack was now nearly hanging off the back of the seat, pressing into Dean’s shoulder as he talked animatedly to Dean’s
Dean quickly focused on paying the pizza man and then called the boys downstairs to eat. The kitchen was noisy and full of laughter as Ben got paper plates and Dean served up everyone slices of pizza. Ben and Jack took their plates to the kitchen table while Claire and Castiel stayed at the island top to eat. Dean had hoped the commotion of dinner would sway Claire into another topic of conversation. He was disappointed.
“That’s DJ-”
The rest of the evening had gone smoothly, and everyone had retired to bed, but Castiel couldn’t settle.
Usually a beautiful chocolate brown, they were ringed in red, tears of blood slipping from the corners and making tracks down her cheeks. Her mouth was covered in blood that Dean knew in his heart was not her own. He reacted, giving into the fight response that was screaming at him from his gut, and slammed her backwards until her head cracked against the marble counter.
“Fuck,” Castiel swore, withdrawing his handgun and whipping the door open, reaching out to grab the bottom of Jack’s shirt and jerk him back.
Last night, he dreamed of him. And he woke up with tears dried on his face.
Jack turned his head, the look on his face showing his hurt, and if Dean hadn’t been so worried that they were going to get shot and looted, he would’ve felt bad. Castiel however kept his eyes trained on the visitors before them.
Castiel pulled back slowly, pressing kiss after kiss to Dean’s lips in what he hoped was reassurance, then pressed their foreheads together. He just breathed, every one of his senses surrounded by Dean.
Castiel laughed and shoved Dean’s shoulder, pushing him towards the table. He left to get the lasagna from the oven and Dean reached for a pitcher of lemonade, pouring a glass for himself and all of the kids. The lasagna was passed between them all, Meg helping Jack and Ben at her end of the table with their slices, and then a basket of garlic bread.
Though the dreams of ‘what ifs’ and ‘why nots’ were still tied up in Kansas, Pittsburgh became something he’d never expected. It was a stop on the road of figuring out what the hell he was doing with his life, and somehow, Kelly became the answer. Kelly was everything Castiel had needed.
There were two metal tables to his right with various items on top that ranged from gas cans to canned goods, firewood and gardening tools. When he tipped his head back, he swore his heart froze in his chest. Despite everything being upside down, he could clearly see a man crouched down on his knees, his back to Dean.
trusting me!”
“Holy moly, Batman,” she laughed as she glanced up. “Haven’t eaten in about a year, huh?”
“So Kelly and Jack?”
“You guys can sit with us!” Kevin called, pulling out the chair on the opposite side of him.
"God, Cas, I've wanted to do that since I met you in the courtyard," Dean replied against his mouth. "You looked so handsome standing there in the sunlight... I hadn't even planned on heading that way, but the idea of not seeing you, not seeing your face, was too much to bear. When I realized who you were..."
“Mom let him stay a night or two on the couch before she threw a fit and told him he couldn’t take up the living room.” She turned the glass in her fingers. “He crashed on my bedroom floor after that. Started bringing a sleeping bag with him when he came.”

“It is in God’s eyes that this marriage is resolved, for True Love shall not be interfered.” He took the scroll and rolled it up, placing it to the side before pulling the next document forward.
Dean stayed and watched; Charlie immediately jumped into her role, pushing sweat-dampened hair back from Gilda’s face, kissing her softly and whispering to her. Gilda grimaced between pushes, her knuckles white where they gripped Charlie’s hand and the bedspread, but every once in a while she would laugh and tip her head up, kissing Charlie softly.
She was breathing oddly, though, that was really all that told Dean she was in labor. Granted, all he’d ever
Castiel nodded, wondering what the hell that had to do with the Klines. Ruby had been a hot mess, with a whole bunch of daddy issues. She had been a bad influence on Sam until the Winchesters had found out she was being molested by her father.
Dean blinked and reached forward, Charlie helping him by taking one of the sides of the map to open it wide.
Castiel felt his cheeks flush and he shrugged, taking the basket from her and holding out his hand to help her down. “Well, maybe I’ve just never had the pleasure of having a chef who cooks as good as your mom.”
“Fuck,” Dean whispered, stumbling over a knocked down display in his haste to get away from the aisle. He needed to get out of there, needed to press on.
Dean spun around, sloshing what was left of his coffee over his hand, to see Charlie scrambling up out of the hatch. Her hair was still braided for sleep, her eyes wide and terrified.
could and should and would be a better boyfriend than Dean. At least he wouldn’t force Castiel to hide their relationship.
“Right,” Castiel nodded and clicked his tongue. “You know, Claire, you can talk to me about -”
With his arms full of the new clothes and a throw blanket from the back of the couch, he found the laundry room and threw all of the clothes and the blanket into the washing machine. He stripped and added those clothes in before starting it, smiling as it began filling, and headed towards the shower. Thank goodness for well water.
The angel was perched on the edge of the bed, laying things out in a neat row. He seemed torn and Dean almost asked him what he was doing. Then, he started to move, mixing and measuring things into the bowl, chanting in soft Enochian. He slipped his angel blade free and continued chanting, then turned the blade on himself.
If he was attacked now, by a creature or another human, he didn’t think he would have the strength to fight back.
“Hush,” Mary whispered, smiling against the back of Dean’s hair. She wrapped her arms around him tightly and stood, pretending to sneak off to the corner of the room. She crouched behind the large box TV, pulling Dean against her chest.
“It’s a bad idea, Cas…”
“I think this morning Chuck told us we were at fifty-six?” Kevin replied, looking at Jesse for confirmation. “He updates us every morning on what he’s heard of the outside world, our supplies and munitions, and how our camp is doing overall.”
The potatoes were warm and heavy, the wine sharp but sweet, and all of it was making Dean sleepy. Uriel had refused the wine, saying the apocalypse wasn’t a good enough reason for him to negate his sobriety, but the remaining four polished off six bottles before the sun went down. Uriel sat and watched them while drinking his water and picking apart the rest of the potatoes.
Dean gave a small laugh and shrugged his shoulder again. “It’s not… a bad thing, I suppose. Home is where your family and friends are, right? So, I would say I’ve got it pretty good.”
“Dad, it’s like… nine thirty! They only opened a half hour ago!”
Quietly, they began to strip. Dean was hyper aware of the fact that Castiel was standing just feet away from him in his boxers, and he resisted the urge to sneak a peek. There was a charge in the room, something had
She mumbled softly and rolled onto her side, immediately falling back into a deep sleep. Castiel brushed her hair back and pulled a blanket over her before leaving her room quietly.
When Claire’s mom was discovered in an alleyway, beaten and with a needle in her arm, Claire went missing for three weeks.
“And what exactly is so ‘happy’ and ‘merry’ about Mom and Jack being gone?”
Jack was already in the car and buckled, playing with his iPad. Castiel glanced over as he turned the ignition and gave a small snort. He didn’t think it was possible to eat Eggo waffles angrily, but Claire was proving him wrong. She scowled at him with her mouth full.
“How do you know it’s a he?” Castiel asked, crossing his arms over his chest. Anna raised an eyebrow and he found himself flushing in response. “I just... “ He bit his bottom lip, thinking. Then asked, “How did you know Balthazar was the one?”
Moving through the rest of Sioux Falls, finding their way to the interstate and Castiel getting them through the East Gate, was almost… perfunctory. At first, Dean thought the other man was simply hung over, but they’d both had some Advil and a few glasses of water before they repacked their clean clothes and set out. And Dean was sure Castiel would have complained about it at least once by now. No, there was something else…
Castiel nodded and Gabriel spoke up from the other side. "So, what's underneath the bandages?"
Castiel didn’t used to be an early morning person, and the way he held tightly onto Dean, stretching and spending the next forty minutes kissing, meant he hadn’t changed in that aspect. To be fair, Dean could’ve been content to stay in their private bubble for the rest of his life. He still couldn’t believe this was happening.
Castiel jumped slightly as Dean slid his leg over him to crawl in, but quickly got with the program, shifting and reaching across the aisle for Dean’s sleeping bag to pull over them. There was a quick scuffle to open Castiel’s sleeping bag, resulting in Dean accidentally kneeing him in the nuts and kissing him in apology.
Of course, then he saw Castiel and nearly tripped over his feet.
Charlie and Jack sorted through their laundry, determining what needed to be washed now and how much water they needed to do so. Castiel and Dean set up all of their sleeping bags and blankets before they resettled together on the cold, dusty couch. Gilda glanced at them once before giving a small smile, understanding their need for privacy, and she turned her attention back to Samwise, singing to him softly.
Claire nodded and turned away from him, making her way across the front lawn. He sighed as he watched her go and sent up a silent prayer that this would be good for her, good for all of them. He hated that she was hurting, knowing he was at least part of the reason, now that he’d taken her away from the home she knew, her friends. But she was bright, and smart, and beautiful, and fun… she
Balthazar turned to look over his shoulder, his look conveying all Castiel needed to know, and he doubled his speed to get down the stairs and catch up with the king. Together, the three of them made their way into the Audience Chamber where the Royal Priest was standing at the head of the table, three scrolls laid out before him. Castiel’s eyes widened as he saw Dean and Sam standing to the left o the priest, and Xavier Milton, the Baker and Anna’s father, to his right.
Jo stared for a moment, then burst out laughing. Dean glared at her. “What the fuck, Jo?”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, gasping against the sudden burning in his eyes, and Becky roared to life with a deafening clank of chains.
“Cas,” Dean breathed out, reaching down and finding the top of Castiel’s head, his fingers threading through his hair. Castiel moaned around Dean’s cock in response. “Shit,” he whispered again, giving a small chuckle that quickly slipped into a groan as Castiel’s hands slipped beneath his thighs, pulling him in closer.
Castiel smiled, the inside of his palm itching as he remembered that moment with Balthazar a few months ago. He wondered briefly if that would’ve felt different, more impactful, if it had been with his true mate…
“Alright, so if we go South here, we could avoid Chicago… it adds another couple hundred miles though, if we want to avoid the major cities in Iowa…”
Dean smiled softly, thinking of Sam as a teenager. He filed away the information about Claire - was she adopted?
put there, as the scene started to wash away. He shivered as he opened his eyes in the darkness of his room, alone save for Charlie who was perched on the edge of his bed watching him.
Fuck, he was thinking way too much about this. It wasn’t his business. Castiel didn’t need Dean’s help for his child. He sure as hell didn’t need or want to know about Dean’s relationship with alcohol. That is, if Gabriel hadn’t told him, which wouldn’t surprise Dean at all… Maybe that’s why Castiel didn’t want anything to do with him… not only was it about their past, but Castiel knows how fucked up Dean is, and why the hell would he welcome that back into his life?
