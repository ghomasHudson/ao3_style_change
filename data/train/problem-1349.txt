That was when I began to monitor him.
It is the most comfortable place to write, less complicated, fewer characters, more to work with.
“Oh Jesus. Sherlock, oh Christ. I FOUND HIM!”
Mycroft is always the one who protects Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
I’m in a hospital.  Doctors and nurses are present, pushing past John. I see their shapes as they flutter about me. I would rather have John.  They also speak to me, but they are dull.  I don’t care to listen yet.  I try to push them away but I am weak and it hurts.  My arm is pinned under a load of debris.
John took a breath.  “I mean that last night, something happened and I didn’t get to remember what, and that isn’t fair.”
‘37-8-60’
I guess what I mean is that I'm a good mate, I can be a lousy friend.
Mycroft is handling it. He does the next-of-kin paperwork. He handles the big decisions. A surgeon is being flown out here from who knows where, the best he could find. I can’t even offer my assistance with the jargon right now because I know one of the questions involves the DNR in his living will, and I can’t be in charge of something like that. Mycroft will handle it, he has people to explain it. His people are everywhere.
Something tells me someone actually does want me here. The only person I know that has that power is Mycroft.
I… I have to stop thinking about this.
It was a blast, though not much of one. The roof was set to come down in a relatively small implosion. Old building like this one, it needed just a gentle prod in the right direction to get it to fall. There was no time to take cover. Now the building is in pieces and I am trapped.
But something wants me back.
It looks like he really does want me around to keep an eye on things. I guess I’m one of the ones that he trusts. I wish he would have told me that he was going to do this. Especially the phone thing. I thought he wanted me solving the case, taking care of his brother that way. Maybe he didn’t want me dividing my time anymore. I can only guess that his biggest priority is Sherlock, and I am integral somehow to the roadmap he has planned out.
I see him. That is him. He has a wide array of equipment covering him, but he is under there. I step closer. Lestrade puts a hand on my shoulder and squeezes it. I step closer. He normally towers over everyone and everything, in personality, if not actual height. He looks so tiny now. I step closer.
The sound of clattering bricks and bending support beams overhead give me the urge to run. But I can’t run. I am pinned in place by a load of debris.
There were case notes in here, too. Little bits of details that were enough to remind me of a blog post I wrote up. Many of the notes were mostly about the specific things I did to help solve the cases. Even in shorthand scribbles, he made me sound indispensable to his work.
I remember when he was a child and I was a young adolescent, Sherlock would tell me stories before bed.  He would make them up, they would be about anything and everything, but for a while, they were all about pirates.  One particular pirate story I recall involved the sailing of a ship to an unknown island.  They found that it was ruled by monkeys who told the pirates that they had the most incredible treasure imaginable. Most of the pirates raised their swords to the monkeys and demanded they be given the treasure.  The monkeys climbed the trees away from the pirates.  The pirate captain thought for a moment, then asked if the monkeys would share the treasure with the pirates.  From the trees  the monkeys bundled down armloads of bananas.  They said the bananas were their treasure because it was what they valued most.   They all ate bananas  together.
John pauses for a few moments. He is deciding something.
I get up from my bed, my pillow still calling me for a few more hours. I bid my bed farewell and get dressed.
I demand explanations from the nurse. She threatens to call security. Was I shouting? I may have been shouting.
I try to respond but my transport is failing me. I can blink. I can smile.
John glanced over.  From the pained look on Sherlock’s face, he was having a similar level of discomfort from a similar hangover.
I am guilty of putting a lot of thoughts in his head.  Some helpful, others not.
It is hard not to feel dire in my circumstance. I know I ruined things. I know I made a mess of everything. I wish I could go back and fix it. I try to think of the things I will change if I make it out of here, but there is a simple truth that is tingling in the back of my mind that I must acknowledge.
I know I am probably overreacting. There are so many other things that are really going on in my mind. Things that I am trying to suppress, things I don’t want to even consider.
I can’t do anything to make myself noticed.
Once, we’d been working a private case, something he took a fancy too. It involved the theft of a racing pigeon, and a lying ornithologist. He solved it quickly, but he’d sliced his arm on a piece of broken glass from the struggle. Not too deep, but it needed to be cleaned out. I offered to do it for him, tape it closed and wrap it. It was while I was working on the wound that I asked his blood type. A simple enough question. He told me it was B Positive. I wrote it down later, kept it in my files.
Finally.
Machines are breathing for him, they are making noises, they are monitoring and keeping him alive.
The doctors dissipate. Dr. Korhonen eventually brings me into the room. I hold my breath.
They will find a way to blame me for this. They always do.
John looked up, his eyes blotchy and red.
I am ushered out of the room.
Lestrade is here. He’s handled it too. He took statements, coordinated the rescue efforts got the team in as soon as I figured out what happened. They found the body of the young guy, and they have a lead on the suspect. He has people too, he’s going to handle the rest of the case.
When all the pressure was trying to take me away, I was there, right there with him.
I drink some more. I am glad this isn’t better quality.  The mood I am in suits lousy alcohol.
At this point, I don’t know how else to act.
I do good work. In the end, it helps. I solve crimes, punish the guilty. I do more than most. But this man is dead. Have I done enough?
When finally my symptoms were gone, I was allowed to go home.  Grandmère finally said to me that Sherlock was brand new to this world, and he would need a guide.  It is up to me; If I wanted him to know the things I know, I would have to teach him.
“Oh God,” someone says.
He could have even continued on in school, he only went to a graduate degree because he grew bored of academia. The chemistry interested him, the bureaucracy of education did not. He could have become a scientist, but only certain studies were worth his time. He had no intention of getting stuck anywhere, doing work just because someone put it in front of him.
In my mind, he is too precious of a resource to fall into the hands of thugs and terrorists, or even Moriarty, in whom Sherlock finds a challenge and an interesting adversary. If he knew half the things I know about James Moriarty, then he would run as far as he could without looking back.
Everything takes time.  He will be back, don’t worry.
It is time to break the illusion.
But with his help, I will be back.
I’m still not learning. Talking to people helps get information. It might be lies, it might be the truth, but you have to at least initiate the conversation. You would think I would know all that, given my line of work.
“You know him,” continued Lestrade, “he isn’t finished with his work. He will be back before you know it…”
He lied to me.
I am being hoisted up by my shoulders. I was on the floor. Spilled my coffee, (his coffee). Lestrade is putting me back in the little room but it is hard to see. I wipe my eyes again and again.
I was there.
There are faces looking at me.  Voices calling.
(See the end of the chapter for
I’m startled awake by a knock at the door.
I’m trying to remember the last time we spoke. I didn’t see him before I left this evening. I spent the day thinking. He was still avoiding me.
Something is going on.
“John, I have told you everything I know.”
My arm is free. Aching, but moveable. I reach for him.
I am being beckoned into Sherlock’s room. John still isn't back, but they want to deliver their news now, so we begin without him. There are three doctors and a nurse who have been on Sherlock's team since he was brought in, but all I care about are Dr. Korhonen’s findings.
I saw John Watson upstairs, smiling, tears in his eyes, holding Sherlock’s hand.  I knew that my familial ties to Sherlock have  been usurped by John’s companionate, possibly romantic feelings.  That beside Sherlock will always be a John Watson.
“No.”
Somehow it worked. Within a day I had both. He exemplifies purpose and joy. Shooting people and chasing murderers shouldn’t have fixed me, but I never claimed I was like everyone else. He wasn’t like everyone else either.
Sounds wake me.
My anchor had disappeared.
I found a body, the one I had expected to find. But my suspect triggered the demolition early. I didn’t expect that. I should have known.
John is here. He has one of those high-vis vests on and a hard hat. I can’t find the energy to speak. But I can smile. I give him a grin.
I am still nothing, stuck in this body that isn’t ready yet.
When John awoke that morning, he felt more than a little hungover.  He opened his eyes to see a bedroom he did not recognize.  He was wearing a shirt and jeans, his shoes were somewhere out of sight. He would have gotten up to investigate, but his arm was pinned.  It was playing pillow to a guest in the bed.  Curled up to his side was a mostly nude consulting detective.
On breaks and during the summer, I would come home and he would be so different from the last time I saw him.  I felt like I was being punished all over again, and he was being taken away from me. He would know so many different things than what I had been teaching him, learning on his own.  I found out when home one winter break that he left the piano for violin.  I hardly spoke to him for days when he told me.
I was caught off guard by something I read in the chart. I was attacked by one small bit of information and I guess I fell apart.
I head upstairs. May as well. There’s nothing I need to do in the office anymore. There’s only so much solitaire you can play.
He should have taken my offer years ago to work for me.  He has a fantastic brain.  It could be put to some use. Instead he's playing hero with his friends, stopping villains and causing trouble.  It makes it much harder to keep track of him  than if he worked as an analyst or an operative.  But of course that would stifle his spirt. One of the reasons I cherish him so much.
Then there were notes about astronomy in there. I am not sure why, but he was learning about the stars.
I am known for being cold and cruel.
I promised him I wouldn’t leave. I was going to come right back… I just needed a minute for air.
“So,”  he said.
Never exactly knew how to tell her about Sherlock and John getting together. Not that I know about any details, I just don’t want her holding a torch for him like that if he can’t reciprocate.  She should move on. I feel bad for her and she doesn’t deserve it.
Of course it didn’t entirely turn out that way in the beginning.  The first time I held him, he vomited on my new cowboy jumper. He didn’t seem to want to learn anything I had to teach him, being an infant.  But eventually there were a number of years where Sherlock and I were inseparable. From the time he could walk, he followed my every step and copied my every movement.
I try to push past and get off the bus myself, making it out into the rain. Umbrellas were everywhere, I don’t see the woman with the orange scarf.
She tells me she has packed some clothes for Sherlock and a lunch for John, she couldn’t get through to him or the Detective Inspector, so she reached out to me.  She is unaware of the seriousness of the situation as well.
Sherlock and John lay in the bed, completely naked, staring at the ceiling.
I think a lot of me is broken.
I ride for about an hour and a half, silently fuming about the situation, trying to think but I kept getting caught up in circles of anger. I stare ahead, trying to work any of this out, but my thoughts are interrupted by a tap on my shoulder. An older woman with an orange scarf looks at me expectantly. I start to stand and offer her my seat, slightly taken aback. She smiles. Before I move away to give her the seat, she holds something out to me. I thought it might be money for giving her the seat, so I shook my head and forced a tight smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
I am not known for that.
John in the show always ends up walking away when he's angry.  Even if he hasn't fully explored why he's angry, or what the other side is coming from.
John left.  And Sherlock was alone again, trying to move on.
There’s light. I wake up to the sound of his voice.
The End
He asks if I remember how much he loves me.  He then asks if I know how sorry he is.
Everyone is different, they only know what they know. I hope the situation being revealed in several different minds tells a bigger story.
Because I did find something.
Oh. John’s crying. Yeah, I see why Mycroft sent for me.
I have to continue to wait.
He was keeping me there.
Because before that there was love.  And there still is.
Everything else happened quite naturally. We evolved into having a life together. It started with casual touches, then incidental kisses. It was never something we discussed, nor was it something that was distracting. Comfort, not romance.
I’m probably going to die.
John tried to think of any innocent explanation for their circumstances, but was failing miserably.
Or maybe he just doesn’t want to deal with John. I don’t know.
John doesn’t need me. All I do is say the wrong thing to him. He doesn’t want emotional support, he doesn’t need a shoulder to cry on. He is where he wants to be.
I freshen myself up in the loo, it has been a few days since I had a shower. I need a change of clothes so I go upstairs and quickly put something clean on. I take a deep breath.
“This man fell asleep at the table,” the maître d’ said, indicating John.  “After that, this one,” he indicated Sherlock now, “jumped up in alarm and began to take away all the bowls of soup around the dining room, trying to prevent others from eating it. One guest did not take kindly to the suggestion and threw his bowl at him.”
I shall inform my staff to put some pressure on bringing him here by the time the meeting is out.
But he has a way of hurting me, even when unconscious and broken. He picks at the parts of me that are insecure and uncertain, then unravels them.
I’m getting frustrated.
I was inspired to continue by your feedback.
There was a brief silence while John considered this.
To drop the metaphors.
Fingers twitch in my hand. Just lightly. Just for a moment. I will stay here and I will keep talking until he comes back to me. And I will never leave again.
“Nothing yet.”
“Sherlock, it’s Lestrade.  Ring me when you get up, we’re going to need a statement about the incident at the hotel last night.  The chef eventually cracked and admitted to doctoring the soup, we can probably tie him to the murders as well.  I hope you don’t mind that we put you in your room, it was closer than the hospital and the paramedics said you two just needed to sleep off the drugs. Anyways, if I don’t hear from you I will check on you in the morning, maybe bring your suit back from the cleaners.  Turrah.”
I’m ferried into a narrow room with official words being passed back and forth as if to lull us in with the confusion of it all. I can’t. I can’t focus on the guilt of being on my feet when he is on a table somewhere having a building removed from him.
I’m the reason Sherlock is in this state.
And yet…
“Anything?”
Was this relationship just another act?
“Fuck,” thought John.
John reeled slightly. “Hey, I don’t know about you, but I’m still fully clothed.”  Sherlock was only wearing his pants and oddly, his socks.
There is smoke in the air and dust in my lungs.
Poor girl. She has always had this thing for Sherlock. Doesn’t quite know how to act about it. She’s awkward but adorable. I wish he knew how much he was leading her on. He probably was doing it on purpose to get special access to Bart’s.
“It doesn’t matter, consumption of alcohol doesn’t typically affect my memory.  Clearly something else is at play.”
That’s what we do. Everything we do centres around crime.
I remember John.
I open my eyes again.  And for once, I actually see.
Apparently the doorbell had been going for some time, they need me back. I’m in his room, there are papers everywhere and apparently I drifted off for a bit.
It doesn’t matter. I am still trapped here and he is still dead.
I see Mycroft as the only one who could understand Sherlock growing up, so he was burdened with dealing with him in his adult life. This is partly a self-imposed burden.
The shapes move away from me. Good.  They can stop bothering me and let me see John again.  I have a feeling that there is something important that we need to say.  I remember that things were good between us.  Comfortable and more comfortable.  Like we belong together. I think something was changing.  I need to know for sure.  I wish i could articulate this.   Instead, I just say his name again in the half-whisper of a voice I have.
He is ashamed and confused. I don’t have the words to help him.
Every time I take a step away, he does something new.  I have been gone a matter of hours and he is talking. He is awake.  Even in his recovery, I just have to turn away and he is someone new.
“Right. Okay.”  Lestrade turned his attention back to the maître d’.  “Why is Sherlock covered in soup?”  Sherlock’s jacket, shirt and trousers all had a considerable amount of leek and potato soup on them.
I finish talking with Donovan. She actually tells me she hopes things turn out okay. For my sake. Not quite a ‘get well soon’ for Sherlock, but it is a lot more than she would normally give. Maybe it is just because he’s not awake enough to hear it.
This story takes place in the place I like to call Series One-and-a-half.
“Where are we?”  John eventually asked.  Sherlock turned slightly from his tucked position.
But I was sent away again.  This time I was sent away to school.
“Does that change things?  I mean, we still ended up …here.”  No matter what, they’d never ended up in this situation in the past.
I feel bad for making him tear out that page.
If he wasn’t able to discover something about me through deduction, then he would research, call in a favour or find someone who knows something. It would take him no time at all, and then he would figure it out.
There is no point to this.  I shouldn’t normally be here.  Like I said, I never sit at his bedside. I have a country to tend to.
My staff say he still is in Baker Street.
“You don’t even know what I was going to say.”
I don't approve either way.
I need to stop thinking about this. It is not going to get him better. I am a medical professional as well, I am realistic in situations like this, I need to be honest with myself, not much is going to get him better. He needs time, but I need to talk to him now.
They are trying to frame everything so positively but I can see through their optimism. It is uncertainty that they offer me, not news of any kind.
They had a crew in looking for evidence, anything we can use. They found a tripwire, triggered the whole building to come down. Probably tripped by Sherlock when he went searching for the body.
“What are we going to do? Barge in and start making accusations?” John said skeptically.
I watch him.
When I was about seven, I contracted the chicken pox, as is common for children of that age.  My mother was still expecting, so I was sent away to stay with my grandmère for a few weeks. I was very upset.  I had been looking forward to the arrival of my new sibling, i couldn’t wait to become a big brother.
7:08pm  Come to Restaurant at once.  About to make a move on chef. SH
I haven’t been handling anything.
Of course, then followed several other calls and texts.  The Detective Inspector was quite ecstatic when he called.
Help me.
"There's a staff loo that you can use to get cleaned up in. Maybe have a shower? It’s just down the hall. There's an sleeping area, you can get a bit of kip in, too. I'm sure it will be no problem."
I also feel like I am in the way. Like how Mycroft has things covered on the most part. He has people and his people have people. He is well connected and has near unlimited resources. Yeah, I know I sent him home, but he would be here in a second anyways if one of his people called him.
They go on their trips and their cruises and tours all over, and they expect me to keep my thumb on him. As if they expect me to monitor his every move and report back to them.
I have to stop… I can’t listen to this. I notice that I am on my feet now, heading towards the operating theatre, to get as close as I can get. Lestrade follows, flashing his ID every few steps. Looks like he is my minder. What am I going to do? Scrub in and demand to help? I would feel a lot more useful than I am being right now, drinking HIS coffee and waiting for someone to tell me if only they had found him sooner he might have a chance.
John sighed.
“Clearly something happened … between us last night.”  John was trying to organize his thoughts carefully and delicately, but it wasn’t really easily done.
“Those bowls must be heavy, he’s going to have a sizeable bruise on his collarbone.” Lestrade muttered.  They continued down the hall.
It was nearly full of observations in his messy, spidery scrawl, many of them were in some kind of shorthand, but I was to able to decipher the general idea.
Again, I don’t want to know. Their relationship is their own thing. Nothing to do with me.
I wish he would get here.
There's a hand in mine.
Maybe we should start a football team. Or pub darts. I am good at darts. I think Sherlock is too. He was arrested ages ago for starting a fight while hustling darts in a pub. He was probably still in his early twenties, and I only heard about this when I looked into his arrest reports. Maybe he is good at darts. We should play sometime when he’s better.
7:10pm  Don’t you dare. L
I wait some more.
It could be a mistake, always possible. Something the hospital recorded incorrectly. His files might be mixed up or out of date. Not likely, there is little chance that Mycroft Holmes would allow for that. Mycroft probably has his medical records as an app on his phone. He would have noticed, and would have fixed it and fired (or worse) the individual who got it wrong.
I look back up, but the bus had come to a stop. The woman had gotten off. I stand, trying to push past the people loading into the bus. I called for her to wait, but no-one moved for me, no-one stopped her. They all were in their own worlds.
His research linked the last few pieces of what we were missing in the case to connect the victim to the killer.
I felt his hand squeezing mine.  I called for him.
Sherlock wakes up
I finish my coffee, throw away the paper cup, silently considering the sandwich. It looks awful, but I’m quite peckish right now. Instead of indulging in terrible food, I walk away from my makeshift office and make my way back to Sherlock’s room in intensive care.
“And do you have any idea where your trousers are?”
“Will they be okay?”  Lestrade asked the paramedics.
I have a few updates from Donovan, keeping me posted on the suspect we have identified for knocking down the building. Our case is strong, but he has a lawyer now and we are going to need all we’ve got to get him charged.
I’m not always an idiot. I could see the grooves on the next page from where he had written. I took a pencil and rubbed over the impression. It was just a few words.
“Sherlock, we will have you out as soon as we can. I am going to need you to stay with me, alright?”
John nodded slightly.
Any half-wit can see what happened between them.   They moved their little 'friendship' into a new phase.  I saw it all over Sherlock.  For months he has been less anxious, less bored.  He's been happy.
“For what, exactly?”
He’d probably say he has no need for anyone, and will be fine alone. These days alone means ‘with John’ but the sentiment is usually the same.
My phone rings.
I struggle to breathe.
Sherlock furrowed his brow.  “Meaning?”
Noise is flooding in. Voices I can’t understand.
I’m an idiot. He always says I am, and most of the time it is true. I didn’t answer my phone. I wasn’t ready. This is my fault.
I value him like the monkeys valued their bananas.
Please don’t let this be the end.
(See the end of the chapter for
I didn't expect to continue this story, I hope you enjoy, there might be more.
No.  That was before, I think.
It made mention of that stupid night with the cut I bandaged. He wrote ‘Find out blood type’ in the top corner of the page. He didn’t even know his bloody blood type, he just made it up so as to not look like he didn’t know something that I thought he should. There was another little scratch saying ‘AB- NOT B+ FIX THIS’. He also planned on telling me after he found out. That made me feel like a jackass.
Donovan also tells me she’s been calling me all day but it kept getting redirected, this is the first time she has gotten through. All her texts in the last few hours have bounced back.
I remember this story the best. I’m not sure why I remembered it now.
I’ve always been proud of that.
I am always on the back foot. I’m the idiot. The bumbling fool that says the stupid thing so he can sound more brilliant.
I know that is a small detail. Most people don’t even know their blood type. But that wouldn’t be like him. He would know every detail about himself to the decimal point. He knows what his type really is.
He chuckled at that, so I know there’s no hard feelings. He takes a swig of the coffee.
I dread this message. What do I even say? I don’t really know how he is. I usually have someone else to explain this to people.
Something else caught John’s eye, and he immediately averted his gaze.  “There’s … er… some … errr…stuff… on your pants.”
Sorry this one took so long.  I accidentally deleted it when I was working on it.  Everyone remember to always back up your work!
It just reminded me that he lies. He lied all the time just to keep me away from what he was doing, or having secrets. He could never just tell me the truth for once.
Sherlock glanced down.  If he could have disappeared at that moment, he would have.
I am not floating away.
My brother and Lestrade appear at the door.  I am with my family.  People that matter.  With people like this, I could survive a thousand collapses.
Things I have heard for my entire life.
I tried to say it in the debris. When we pulled the ceiling and walls and bricks from on top of him. When we noticed the state of him. I was begging for him to hold on. I probably cried, shouting as he went unconscious, holding his bloodied hand. I said I was sorry for leaving. Sorry for avoiding him. And when the rest of the rescue team pulled me away so they could stabilize him, I said I was sorry for being an idiot.
Another cup of coffee is out beside me. I don’t even remember drinking the last one. I have no idea who keeps putting it there. The little waiting area is cold and crowed with my own thoughts but the coffee keeps my hands warm. I take a sip. Sugar again.
“So,” agreed Sherlock.
What happened next was also entirely self-evident.  Something else changed.  John's guilt about missing the text message, his time at his sister's, obvious.  Their relationship moved to a sexual level and it wasn't working.
The rest of the injuries are lesser, but considerable in number.  Several fractures, numerous lacerations. There is the possibility of more surgeries, with long healing times or permanent damage. He will have to undergo plenty of recovery and physical therapy when he is able.
“Take me to Baker Street first, then I’ll go back.”
My heart sinks when I remember his parents. Should I contact them somehow? I think we met once, just in passing, they seemed nice. Bit of a contrast to my family of alcoholics and arseholes. These people would care and are probably on their way. Mycroft would already have someone handle it.
Sherlock paused.  “I don’t really know.”
I had been gliding along an endless dark ocean.
“Meaning, you think we had sex.”
I get there pretty fast, like someone had all the lights queued up to green for me. Someone probably did. I head upstairs.
And before that there was the Uxbridge case.  The corridor.  No longer just friends. He wanted me and took me.  I remember that.  And it was fine.
“If I am going to be murdered in a hotel like the previous victims, I need a room.”
I’ve seen him put on an act before, many times, when he wanted information. He would put on an accent or conjure up some tears, or put on a costume and become an entirely different person.
I mean, it was a surprise, when he finally acted affectionately to me. He mostly just did it in response to things I did. Like when I handed him a mug of tea, I once clasped his hand around the mug. Just a casual but warm-hearted gesture. It wasn’t an hour later that he was trying the same on me. I genuinely felt like he was learning to show love at the time. I don't know. Was he copying me to manipulate me somehow? Was that what this was?
I've already alerted my staff to the absence of John Watson.  I received a frankly frantic phone call from the Detective Inspector, whom I instructed to go home and get some sleep.  My staff will find John.  I will go to my brother.
Something happened.  Something big.
I will have to meet with them and talk to them beforehand, let them know what happened. It isn’t that I didn’t tell them everything, it is that I didn’t know how to tell them. They know he’s been in an accident, but they do not know he hasn’t regained consciousness. My mother wanted to talk to him on the phone when I called her. I told her he was being examined and couldn’t come to the phone. Not an outright lie, but a convenient mislabelling of truth.
“That was…” shuttered Sherlock for the fifth time.  John lay back on the pillow, sweaty and breathless, a look of pleasure and satisfaction was plastered all over his face.
The notebook was about me. Notes about me. Like how I like my coffee and what takeaways I prefer. My shoe size and my height, and the fact that I am allergic to penicillin. As if he was doing a report on me for a scientific journal.
My mind is slowing down with my body. I am having a hard time focusing. The aches are getting sharper and I am feeling cold. I’m able to move my head, but breathing is getting worse.
I have John.
I hear the sirens. I don’t know how long it has been. The stars have moved. I try calling out again. It is pathetic, barely a whisper above the shifting of the debris.
“What did you mean, that wasn’t what happened last night?” John demanded, sitting upright.  Sherlock stretched, covering his eyes with his arm.  John frowned.  “What is this, some sort of game?”
I hope that came across.
I’ve never seen John look so relieved. He said he tried to get back as fast as he could, he just stepped out for a change of clothes and he nodded off. He thanked Mycroft for the car that found him, and didn’t really say anything else. I don’t know that I really believe him, we all offered to bring him anything he needed. Something else is up.
When I first met him, I didn’t know that it was the kind of meeting that would change my life. My therapist used to tell me that I needed purpose and joy in my life. Purpose and joy led to positive mental health. I had neither. I couldn’t be in the army any longer, I was unable to be a surgeon again, my relationship with my sister was as rocky as ever, and what friends I had were either still in the army or nearly non-existent. There was no purpose, I had no joy.
Sherlock touched the area gently with his free hand.  He tried to remain dignified.  “A hematoma of some description.”
I pull the notebook out of my pocket. I run my fingers across the imprint from the missing page.
We sit for probably an hour. My body is aching for sleep. I am also remembering the sandwich I had what feels like a lifetime ago.
Ah yes, they are easing me into the medical jargon. Start by calming me with the easier to follow information, then they introduce the more difficult concepts. It is a technique much used in dealing with anxious loved ones with simpler minds. I let them know that is not the case.
I sent Mycroft home. He had put in a lot of hours, and he had to prepare for his parents showing up tomorrow. He looked pained to actually leave. I don’t know how many times he must have seen Sherlock in a bed like this, but this has to be the worst. The thing is, you never get used to it, seeing a loved one in this shape. Any shape except perfect, really. With how much Mycroft really is obsessed with Sherlock’s wellbeing, this must be torture.
“It’s all fine.”
Molly messaged me about the body. She did postmortem on him, it was a stab wound to the upper GI tract that killed him, the debris from the collapsed building that penetrated the corpse did not contribute to his cause of death.
Sherlock looked at John.  “What do you mean, ‘No,’?”
John is back in with Sherlock, they are done checking him over for now. John started talking again. To Sherlock. I guess it is more important he keep doing it, now that he’s waking up.
Deserves.
And we fight. Squabbling like children sometimes.
I was trapped. I was dying.
I cough again. I taste blood in my mouth now.
John lay back down.  Sherlock stirred next to him.  His eyes opened, but he did not move.
I think I fell asleep.
And that was… fine. I was almost ready to go.
I had the forethought to request a bottle of brandy for the desk drawer. I rather think I’d like that right about now.
A nurse walks in. She does the vitals, she checks him over in the usual manner.  She talks to him, even though there is little evidence that he will hear or have any capacity to understand in the state he is in.  Perhaps I should have been talking to him, like John does.    The nurse leaves.
“Don’t bother, they only booked one bed for a reason, if you take my meaning.”  Lestrade said.  Everyone seemed to understand.  The paramedics heaved John on to one side of the bed, taking off his shoes afterwards. Sherlock was still covered in soup, and was entirely dead weight.
I stand. It is time. We head down the corridor to a different wing, a different world. Intensive care.
That is one of the reasons I can’t face him now…
I pour myself another half-glass of brandy.  I am not normally this nostalgic.  But I feel as if I have been sent away again.
My body is sending me new signals.  Immobility is one of the primary ones.  What doesn’t hurt, I am uncertain if I can move at all.
And there it is.  All at once.  Gaps in my memory are suddenly filling in.  I try to make sense of it all.
I am just about to snap at them and demand to know what is going on, because something is definitely happening. A nurse comes in, Mycroft looks at me expectantly. Lestrade looks as if he is about to burst. The nurse looks to Mycroft, who nods once, and then she leads me in past the doctors into his room.
“Did you see that!?”
“Listen, mate, it will be okay. He…”
His chart said his type was AB Negative.
Sherlock handed John a business card.  It read: ‘Sherlock Holmes, Real Estate, Birmingham’.
So that’s it, the case is out of my hands. I guess I am on holiday now.
I’m not sure why I thought of that.
I have love. And I have all the time in the world.
I don’t know what I can do to help, but I probably should do something.
“…Amazing?” John said, nuzzling Sherlock for a kiss. Sherlock kissed him softly, but broke away quickly, shaking his head.
I take the seat next to the bed.  I've seen him stabbed, poisoned, and overdosed in the past. But I never sat alongside his bed during those times. Those injuries were from his other life. The life before this business he invented for himself and giving him a raison d'être for his life.  It got him on the other side of crime, solving it instead of living amongst it.
There is a glimmer of possibility when they mention treatment. Dr. Korhonen has options.
Tucked in between the folios and the stacks of paper, I found a notebook.
There’s a knock at the door.  Detective Inspector Lestrade enters the room before I could put away the alcohol. He sees the look on my face and decides to ignore it.  How he knew I was here is a mystery, I didn’t make myself known when I was upstairs.  Perhaps he is a better detective than I give him credit for.
I don’t need an anchor.  I don’t need an ocean.
He also needs to go have a shower.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mr. Holmes is checked into room 115, just along here,” the maître d’ explained.  There, the hotel’s concierge was waiting with a spare door key.   He let them in.  It was a comfy room with one extra large bed.
Nothing.
Because it goes back to the original problem. When things changed, and I had to leave. I messed up something that was turning into a big deal for him, and it was enough to change how he felt.
Speaking of which… my phone is ringing, it is Donovan.
I let my eyes close.
I am no stranger to blood. I have seen a considerable amount before. I have seen my own before. But this is different. They all stop clearing the debris and watch John. He looks so hollow, so shaken.
Why couldn’t he just have taken what I offered him? A comfortable job, a generous wage and safety. I offered him right out of university. He chose to find other ways to occupy his mind.
“He kept asking me about the dessert.  He said it was supposed to be the dessert that was drugged, not the soup,”  the maître d’ said, helping Lestrade carry Sherlock’s rag doll body down toward the hall.
I sigh and throw the rest of my naan in the foil container. I had better get to work, check on Donovan. Make sure everything is going well.
Sherlock squeezed John’s hand back.
I know most of his hiding places, spots he didn’t expect me to know about. Little places for putting his experiments, disguises, weapons, or worse. But there was always this briefcase. A big one with a lock on it. It was tucked in the back of his closet. I saw it once when we had to do a search, when we were worried that he might be on something. I did try to get into it with no luck, not without breaking the thing. When I mentioned it to Mycroft at the time, he said it was not important and to continue searching elsewhere.
“It’s not drugged, don’t worry.”
I hope you enjoyed it!  It was very fun to put together!
A lot is going on in my head. Lots to consider. Mostly trying to find out where all the guilt I feel really needs to be. This book had confused things a bit. Good to know that he was comfortable in the expanding of our friendship. But I feel terrible for assuming he was lying. For assuming he was trying to trick me and manipulate me when he was just trying to find his own way through his own feelings.
I am patient with her, She can be distracting and sentimental, but she loves my brother as a mother would love her son.
I listen some more.
I do try with him. I always have. However, Sherlock detests me for meddling. Which I only do because he needs the supervision. Sherlock does what he can to evade me, to stay outside of the range of my cameras and my spies. Then I set up more cameras, recruit more spies.
Sherlock hasn't been happy since childhood.
After that, there was a page torn out of the notebook.
I just…
I had expected John Watson to have arrived by now.
He holds his hand to mine.
Which makes me think of what else he was lying about.
I find my way upstairs, back from the office space I have been lent on behalf of the hospital.  I may be invested in the wellbeing of my brother, but I can’t coordinate everything from a bedside.  I have specialists coming in tomorrow from Helsinki, recommended for their treatment of patients in Sherlock’s condition.  I am arranging for our parents to return to the UK from their trip to America.  Their flight was delayed, I offered to charter them a jet, but they told me ‘not to make a fuss’. I’m not sure they fully understand what has gone on here.
“Sherlock,” replied John.
Our parents are on their flight back to the UK. They arrive this evening. I will instruct them to get settled into the hotel and come in the morning. Delay them just a bit longer. I want Dr. Korhonen to come up with some answers for them.
“No, we need to witness a dinner service.  The victims have both been estate agents so far, found in the hotel with their throats slashed after ordering a big meal in the hotel’s adjoining restaurant.  Tox reports for both of them showed a high amount of some kind of sedative in them.  They were murdered after consuming drugged food.”
But of course that begs the question as to why I am in here.
I must be in shock, I don’t feel much pain, mostly aching from the pressure of the debris. It is uncomfortable and heavy on me. I try bending everything, wiggling parts of my body to see if it will come free or is still capable of movement. I can’t tell if everything is working. It is too much sensation all around me. I can’t tell if my legs are even still attached.
“I have the feeling I owe you an apology.”
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
“If we find out which chef is responsible for putting drugs in the food, we can isolate who was the intended target.”  Sherlock was posting another sheet of paper on the wall with the dozens already affixed there.  “It means we are going to have to go to this hotel.”
I heard those words.  They came through.  A thick accent, somewhere Scandinavian. He was talking to John.
Sherlock is no stranger to intimate relationships, I understand that he's had several, even one or two meaningful ones. I try not to pry, but I worry, constantly, for his safety.  So I investigated his chosen partners, and disposed of many of them when I found them of an unsavoury sort.  He likely didn’t miss them, it was just another thing to stave off the boredom.  He fell out of the habit of friends and lovers for a long time.  I suppose that is my fault, for making them all leave. But I do what I can to protect him.
They wipe my eyes and sit my bed up more.  As they moved me, I think I imagined I saw Mycroft through the glass window of my room.  He was walking away from me.  He’s walked away from me a lot in the past, only to pretend he isn’t sorting my life out for me.  Maybe I want him to come here and sort out everything.
I need to tell him that I love him, too.
“This is a bad idea, John.  We still don’t know what happened to us.”  Sherlock was already leaning in.
“Oh, should I see if there is another room nearby?” the concierge asked.
The doctors swarm to the bedside and I am being held back by the nurses. There was an alarm on one of the machines, it was beeping but I didn’t think… it couldn’t mean…
They left me in the room with him alone so I could meet him, get used to him. I looked at him.  He looked useless and pathetic in his cot.  He made little noises and wiggled a bit.  He didn’t know anything.  Grandmère was right.  It was up to me to teach him what I knew, so he wouldn’t be useless any longer.
Lestrade wakes up to some messages.
The combination he sent me opened this briefcase.
The car finally got to the hospital. I tuck the notebook into my pocket and walk inside.
But that was it.
I got it from the little place on the corner, near Scotland Yard. It was where I first met Sherlock, actually. I’d go there for lunch and he would be there. Not to eat or whatever, but just doing his observation thing. He must have been there at lunchtime for days before I noticed. I thought he might be stalking me, when I finally went to confront him, he ran away. I chased him down, and since the curry place was so close to the Yard, I had about a dozen officers running behind me after him.  When he was cornered, I asked him what he was doing staring me down all those days. I had to get rid of the rest of the officers before he’d answer, claiming there were ‘too many idiots listening’. It turns out that he’d witnessed something on a case I was working on and he said he knew who the murderer was. I go to take his statement, and he told me what he’d witnessed was what the victim ordered for lunch at the curry house that day. He didn’t see the murder at all.
I listen.
“Correct.”
John waits.  In his head is the guilt about what happened between them.
“Everyone fan out, keep your torches low and watch your footing. If you see anything, report back on the radios. This building is unstable. Keep alert for the signal to clear out.”
“‘We could just pretend it didn’t happen and go on as normal’?”
I am such a chicken. I should just ask her out.
I should have asked if it was okay. I should have talked to him. I am so ashamed for not making sure he knew how I felt. It is more than friendship. More than cases and chases and catching the bad guys. More than kisses and casual touches. I don’t know what that means, whether or not he feels it too or if we can take the time to discover what it really is, together.
“Like what?”  John asked, still on the verge of being furious. Sherlock reached to the floor and picked up a discarded business card and showed it to John.  It said: ‘Sherlock Holmes, Real Estate, Birmingham’.  It also was covered in something crusty.  John was about to toss the card aside in revulsion, but stopped when he detected something he couldn’t quite place.  He brought the card closer to his face and inhaled.  The card was covered in dried leek and potato soup.
Of course that isn’t true.
He’s not there.
It is useless to wish. Nothing will change.
“Help me out, guys.”  Between the paramedics, the maître d’ and the concierge, they managed to get Sherlock’s wet jacket, shirt and trousers off, leaving him on the bed beside John in only his pants and socks.  There was a small spot of soup that made it to Sherlock’s pants, but he’d have to deal with that in the morning.
I head downstairs and head to the cabinet for some paracetamol. Headache swimming around from all the cigarettes earlier. I down a few tablets, then go to the kitchen to pick at the remains of the takeaway I got on my way home. There’s still some naan and a bit of curry left, so I tuck in.
Soon I was walking away. Now I am a mile from the hospital, looking at bus schedules.
I find a bus. The sky is threatening rain so I climb on. I don’t know where it is heading, I just ride for a while.
It had been over a year, the two of us living together. I realized when I read that chart that I hardly know anything about him. I mean, fuck! I know so little. Not where he went to school, not his middle name or birthday, not if he preferred the Beatles or the Stones. Nothing.
I am not lost.
I was in a broken building.
It hurts to move, to breathe, to blink.  All of it.
But the truth is if I were anywhere else, and if something happened, I would be lost.
I should have spoken to John. John would have stopped me from coming here, had he known. He can sense danger in a way I can’t explain. He would have known it was set to blow. I would have listened to him. I should have listened to him. But it is also why I avoid telling him things. Sometimes the game is best when facing the danger head-on and I want to see what happens next. He has the caution of a man with experience.
There was a knock at the door.
I almost have him arrested for wasting my time, but he explains the whole story based on the evidence he knew about the people in the curry house, which he’d been staking out over the last few days. The curry matched the stain they’d reported in the newspapers. Sherlock was at the curry house making an inventory of all the kinds of curries on the menu.
I'm drifting again.
John is different. I don’t even know why I chose him. It was as if he walked into my life with a limp and an arrow above his head with the lettering
painted on it. He complements me perfectly.
I hear feet. Voices. People.
“Do you remember how much we drank last night?” John attempted.
He tells me that Sherlock had seen me from the window when I was upstairs. They all did.  He hasn’t said much more, but he did say my name several times.
I want my ocean back.
He moves some of the rubble away, smoothly as possible, piece by piece. Soon there are other hands moving more pieces. The more they reveal, the more they whisper to each other.
“I suppose it would make the job easier if they are knocked out.” John admitted.
There is a chair, one warm from a recent visitor. I reevaluate the tiredness on Mycroft’s face. It is grief. He must have taken some time beside his brother, before they got me. It must be bad.
I walk to the bedside to finally be with him again, but as I get there, his eyes gently close again. I look to the nurse, who is already talking to one of the doctors. The doctor pushes past me and does a quick examination.
I was more concerned for his mind to begin with. I have to admit, when he fell unconscious, I made a silent plea for his mind to remain intact.  His body is, as he says, just transport.
I tried. Eventually I tried. It wasn’t the text I expected. I expected a message about my absence, or something about what happened that night. I did read the text. But it wasn’t until well after the bloody building came down. He left without me and now look what happened! Hours and hours, like that. While I sat ignoring a message.
I see the sky filtering it’s reds and blues through the small window. It is evening already.
I take my seventh cigarette break today. It keeps me awake. God dammit I am tired. I caught a couple of hours when we had John locked in the waiting room, and a few more in the break room when I got to work, but I think it is finally getting to me. It has been days since I saw my bed.
I try to shout, but I just cough again. Breathing is more difficult than it was earlier.
My phone chimes and I am shaken from my sleep. My head is aching all of a sudden. I dread getting out of bed.
“Thanks for the coffee. Too much sugar, though.”
Dear lord.  It was my fault.
I can move my head a bit. That is probably a good sign. To one side of the broken room I see the corpse. The one I had found before the collapse had been triggered. It lays at an awkward angle across some bricks and rubbish. Mid twenties, auburn hair, wearing contacts but normally wears glasses, probably wanted to be a chef. He reminds me of Mycroft in the horse riding accident. Not for looks or anything. Just as Mycroft had looked so close to death, this kid looks like he could get up and walk away, unscathed, were it not for the stab wound that killed him.
Please come back and fix this.
They wouldn’t let me in the ambulance, so someone drove me, probably Lestrade. Now I am here. A hospital trauma centre that is too rich for the likes of me, but I am happy it is here when he needs it.
I have to stop thinking about this.
Before that, I was alone for a few days.  He was at his sister’s.  He came back, but didn’t talk to me.
He knew everything about me.
So I call back.
Sherlock will recover. He will be fine.
They let me read his chart. Apparently Mycroft put me on a list that gave me privileges like that. To be honest, it wasn’t as bad as I expected. Well, it is still entirely awful, still fully frightening, still unacceptable.
I wonder if emergency services are even on their way. I had been to three other sites before this one. If they were following my text to John, it could be hours. This building was slated to come down in the morning. The area was cleared. Someone must have questioned it, though.
I’ll try again soon.
“That was not what happened last night.”
I don’t feel stronger.
A machine beeps in the background.
I try to clear my vision by blinking.  I can see at a bit more of a distance.  I think that shape is Lestrade. That makes me feel surprisingly more relaxed.  I am glad he is here.  I know he’s been here for me in the past.  At times when nobody else would listen, he listened to me. I try to say something but his name comes out as a barely audible hiss.. I point at him, which earns me a glance.   I think he has a phone in his hand. He glances at it frequently.  He is waiting for a text or a call.  That is the only reason to do that.
But there is hope there. That’s good. That’s something to cling to. We always look for that, it helps us keep on fighting for the patient, so the patient can fight for himself. So I have hope, I will fight for him. I am cautiously optimistic. Really.
I want my phone.  I feel like I should be able to make a call.  Call someone to help me.  I feel so trapped.
I know people are all scared of him, but I have known him for years, the lengths he goes to in order to protect his brother, pushing the line of what is appropriate use of his power, it is just his way of showing how much he loves him. He tried to pay me for keeping tabs on him when we first met. Obviously I turned him down. But when I realized who he was to Sherlock, it kind of made sense. It isn’t traditional or even normal for that matter, but it is love. He is one of the most caring people I have ever known.
My eyes are open.
And then I see John.  I would recognize him anywhere. I know his shape, I know his smell. I know the sounds he makes.  He is speaking to me, but I am too tired to understand.  I will worry about that later.
However, I have a feeling that this case is only in my hands as a platitude. Major crimes or some shadowy government agency can take it off my desk at any time.  I’m almost tired enough to sign it off to Mycroft.  I’ll see how my team handles it for now.
I want to tell him that it is okay. That I’m sorry. I want to tell him anything. I think he knows, though. He found me and that was all that I needed. Just him. Just the two of us. As it should be. And I can rest easily with that. Nothing more.
I was drifting.
(See the end of the chapter for
I have been avoiding it. Avoiding thinking about why everything went to shit. It was my fault. I just didn’t know how to fix it.
It is Mrs. Hudson.
John started talking as if his words were life-rafts he was throwing out to a dark ocean. At first it was fine. He was telling stories. Then it got a level of personal that I didn’t need to know about.
I can turn my head the other way a bit to see through the crumbled ceiling to the night sky. There are stars visible from where I am. I have learned a bit about stars since the gallery. Their movements in the night sky are actually fascinating. I can almost understand why one would study astronomy. It appeals to the chemist in me, where I would use my microscope to study the minute, a telescope would study the massive.
There was another moment of silence.
It was only after the suspect was convicted of the crime that I found out that he had actually been stalking me. He wasn’t only there memorizing the menu, he was learning about my habits and whatever else he could deduce from lunch. He needed to know if I would be the right detective to work with. He had a wide selection of detectives to choose from, almost all of us are at that curry house. But he decided I was the one he wanted to work with. Everyone is an idiot, but I was just less of an idiot than everyone else.
