away from attempting to give him a blow job on the end of his bed.
Cas has cleaned enough of the flour off his face so that Dean can now clearly see the pitiful look Cas gives him. Dean sighs at him fondly, then crosses over to the shower. He turns on the water and motions for Cas to come closer. Carefully, he strips the angel out of his shirt, leaving it turned inside-out so that the flour on it doesn’t get all over the floor. He then instructs Cas to finish undressing while he checks the temperature of the water. A moment later, he’s herding Cas into the open shower and reaching for the shower head. It’s moments like these that Dean’s grateful he installed detachable shower heads in the bunker. This way, he can hose Cas down without getting himself soaking wet.
He’s actually very clever, arguably
“You mean...have our date in your
Thank you so, so much for reading this all the way through! I hope you enjoyed this story as much as I did. It was a lot of fun to write, and I'm gonna miss working on it.
The angel blinks at him, puzzled.
Then, a look of realization passes across the younger Winchester’s face as he puts pieces of their conversation together. He nearly looks like he’s about to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns his attention to the book he was reading, and that’s the end of his conversation with Cas. Similarly, Cas’s attention returns to his discovery about Dean and gift-giving. He decides that perhaps he should offer Dean things more often. In the coming days, he actually

He pointedly looks at the price tag, then smiles.
As per usual, I should have the next chapter up in a day or so!
The angel gives him an exasperated, yet fond look.

takes a little maneuvering. Finally, Dean gets a hold of it. He retrieves the screwdriver, standing up straight once more, when suddenly, the muscles in his back start to complain.
“Ever since Jack walked in on us, it hasn’t been the same.”
“Nah, took one last night,” Dean replies. “You go ahead.”
move of wrapping a leg around Cas’s hip, their five minutes are up. Dean knows this is the case as soon as Cas pulls back to look at him, a mixture of disappointment and desire on his face. Dean sighs, sliding his hands down Cas’s chest. He lifts his head up from his pillow and presses a final, lingering kiss to Cas’s lips before the angel removes himself from Dean, and Dean reluctantly sits up. He slides out of bed and sets about getting dressed, pulling a clean change of clothes out of his dresser. To his surprise, Cas gets out of bed as well, getting dressed in his clothes from the previous night. When Dean shoots him a curious look, Cas steps over to him and places a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Sam frowns.
I thought it would be nice to write a little bit of Sam's perspective for this chapter, kinda change things up a bit. The next chapter will be up here soon, so until then! :)
Cas does and immediately notices the new painting hanging on his wall. He stares at it, wide-eyed.
for, Dean can’t help but gasp when he feels Cas’s lips on him. He uses his hand that isn’t tangled in Cas’s hair to reach for Cas, seeking out one of his hands.
see his face.
“I...I believe I may have misplaced a book,” Cas says.
—Dean slowly peels his hands away from his face, tempting fate by letting his hands hover just to either side of Cas’s hips. Dean doesn’t touch him, but it’s a near thing. Cas glances down at him, but doesn’t say anything. Dean bites his lip.
“Wait...
“You don’t think that Jack will...
He lets his eyelids flutter shut, his lips parting slightly. He has just enough time for a shallow breath, and then Cas’s lips are on his. He feels the angel’s hands grab at his hips, pulling him closer, and Dean moans shamelessly at the touch. He winds his arms around Cas’s neck, tilting his head further to the side to deepen their kiss. Cas moves his jaw deliberately, like he’s trying to draw out their kiss for as long as possible.
“When I had you take back the books I pulled from the library, I had a personal book on my desk. I think I may have put it with all the research I was working on, because now I can’t find it.”
Dean tosses the ice pack somewhere on the kitchen counter and sets to work. Despite a few careless mistakes, like forgetting to preheat the oven and almost missing the sink when he goes to strain the boiled potatoes, Dean manages to make dinner.
For the better part of two weeks after that, Dean would occasionally catch Cas staring at him with that same, strange expression. The angel never said anything though, and eventually things went back to normal. He was never mean to Dean, and he didn’t treat him any differently, even if he did seem to fidget a bit more in Dean’s presence at first. Dean wrote it off as being part of an
“You should, um...you should probably get dressed,” Cas says in a low voice. “Sam’s expecting us to…”
“We’ll be right back,” Dean assures him.
“I, uh. I got kinda bored with the other stuff,” he lies.
He may have spent the first few years he’d known the angel denying it, burying the strange, confusing sensations that seemed to bubble up in his chest—and admittedly, in
Dean makes a face, and Cas starts rubbing little circles on his chest to soothe him.
Cas furrows his brow.
Cas tries to repeat himself, but Dean quickly cuts him off, sliding out of the bed and getting to his feet.
why I’m not going to read it. Now go put it back.”
“Oh,” he mutters. “Did you want some? You can have some of Sam’s fries, he never really eats them anyway.”
He looks intently at the angel, jabbing a finger in his direction.
As it turns out, Cas actually had a hand in the creation of cats.
“I’ll be here when you get back,” Cas assures him.
Dean blinks at him.
In case it isn't obvious, we have a very exciting chapter coming up next, so if you like what you've read so far, stick around!
Cas nods.
Cas frowns.
Dean looks up at him and smiles.
Dean shouldn’t be so surprised when it happens. But really,
“So...what does that mean?”
“Of course we did, it was
“Dean, I...I’m sorry,” he says weakly.
Instead, Cas decides that he and Dean need to have as many movie nights as possible. And
Cas’s lips are soft and warm against his own. Dean can feel the stubble on Cas’s chin as the angel tilts his head further to the side, deepening their kiss. His hand slides up to cup Dean’s face, holding him gently, yet somehow keeping him exactly where Cas wants him. After a moment, Dean relaxes into the kiss, letting his lips move entirely of their own accord. He hears—and
“But Cas, I—”
he says, trying to cheer the angel up.
He smiles as Dean holds him tighter at that. Cas then finds Dean’s hand with one of his own and laces their fingers together, letting out a contented sigh...
Cas nods his understanding.
“Well, it’s obvious you were having a sexual dream about me.”
Dean grins widely at him. He turns around to unlock the door, when he pauses. He looks over his shoulder at Cas.
Within the hour, they’re standing in the aisle of a home goods store, looking at queen-sized sheets and comforter sets. Sam, ever the practical one, is comparing prices for a couple different sheet sets. Dean on the other hand, is completely lost in his own little world, wondering if maybe he should look at some new pillows for himself while they’re there. Cas, however, looks like a deer in the headlights. He never imagined that there would be so many choices for what to put on a bed. His eyes scan over the length of the aisle, and he’s not sure where to begin.
“Dean...I’m not mad,” he says gently.
The second thing Dean notices, he discovers completely by accident. As he looks at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, he spots clusters of small lines at the corners of his eyes. They’re barely there, and honestly, he probably wouldn’t have noticed them if he hadn’t gotten an eyelash in his eye first thing that morning. He looks at them a little more closely.
“If you think I love his hair because of its color, you’re
Cas shakes his head.
do you?” he asks. “I mean, he’s a pretty smart kid.”
“You know, between you and me...I’m getting kinda tired of beer.”
“Please?” Jack says, grinning up at Cas.
Having found something other than the thought of climbing into bed with Cas and ruining their friendship to occupy himself, Dean tucks the strange book under his arm, and collects the research materials Sam needs. He then tiptoes out of the angel’s room, gently closing the door behind him. He makes his way to the library where Sam is fully engrossed in an old manila file.
Cas nods eagerly. They ignore the scattered papers they’re stepping on as they move towards the bed. Dean quickly sits down on the edge of the bed to remove his shoes and socks. Cas, already barefoot, starts to run his hands over Dean’s arms and shoulders. When Dean manages to get his shoes and socks off, tossing them haphazardly onto the floor, Cas crowds between his thighs, nudging them apart with the press of his hips. Dean happily allows Cas to inch closer.
He glances back up at Cas’s face, then suddenly remembers something. He turns towards his nightstand, about to open the top drawer when Cas stops him.
So, I ran into a little extra spare time and got this part ready to go earlier than I thought! Yay, productivity?
Silently, they both drain their glasses of whiskey. They sit like that for a while, each processing everything the other said.
“Dean,” he pants, “I want you to know...whatever comments I made earlier about you being a present for me...I didn’t mean to imply—”
naked Dean, trying to hide himself by pressing into an
He sighs.
Dean finds a book sitting on his nightstand and decides to occupy himself by flipping through it. He leaves his door open so that if Sam or Cas should come by to check on him, they won’t find him doing anything suspicious.
Cas slowly guides Dean’s head back, tilting his chin up so that his throat is bared. Then, Cas removes his hand. Dean pauses.
Cas is surprisingly vocal in moments like these.
Dean takes a bite of his hamburger.

“Hey, Cas,” he smiles.
“Thank you, Sam,” he smiles.
“Sam,” he mutters, his voice uncharacteristically quiet.
Cas understand.
“Oh, I did, did I?”
Cas swats Dean’s behind as the hunter walks around the table to go make breakfast. Dean turns on his heel to face him, a look of surprise and amusement on his face. Cas chuckles at that, fine, little lines appearing at the edges of his eyes and mouth as he grins.

Cas looks up at him, his eyes full of fear and worry.
They make it to the door of the angel’s room when Dean turns to Cas, grinning widely.

Both Dean and Cas blink at him.
Sam stares at him, mortified. After several moments, his mouth finally remembers how to form words.

“Why are you reading about Greek mythology?” the angel asks. “I thought you needed information on Native American folklore.”
Sam furrows his brow.
“Hi, Sammy.”

“Hey, demons don’t exactly do many things right, but

At first, things don’t seem all that strange. They seem...
He ghosts his fingertips over Cas’s lower stomach, delighting in the way it makes Cas shudder and buck into his mouth. Cas moans a little louder as Dean swirls his tongue. Then suddenly, both of Cas’s hands fist in Dean’s hair and the angel goes completely silent.
Dean blinks a couple times, his eyes starting to mist over.

“Wait, so...you’re

to get on Heaven’s hit list aren’t you?” he teases.
“Right...sorry.”
The hunter drops his head back onto the bed dramatically.
Cas points at the engine grease on Dean’s shirt. And hands. Dean shrugs. He then walks around to the front of the car and sits on the hood, looking at Cas intently.
It makes Dean wish he would have thought to turn on a light in their room that morning, just so he could have seen the angel grinning up at him as he wrapped himself around Dean playfully. They’ve been together long enough that the ‘honeymoon phase’ should have worn off, but for some reason, each time it feels like they’ve finally settled into their relationship, something comes along and makes it all feel brand new again.
Dean nods.
he inquires.
The look on Sam’s face suggests that he most certainly is not.
“Okay?” Sam urges.
“Oh my God,” Sam mutters.
“Look,” Dean says softly, “I didn’t understand what was going on, but I think I do now.”
Dean sighs and goes to remove Cas’s arm when he feels a leg start to slide around him as well.
idea you’ve ever come up with.”
“Your brother basically said we couldn’t...
“Hey, it’s okay,” Dean says, having a seat on the bed next to Cas.
“It’s not important,” Dean cuts him off, looking intently at Sam.
He smacks the bottom of one of Sam’s feet. The younger Winchester twitches slightly, but doesn’t wake up. Dean shakes his head.
Inside the package is a cottony, slate-blue comforter set that seems to match Cas’s eyes perfectly. He watches as Dean’s features soften into a look of joy and amusement.
“R-Right. Um...thank you?”
Sam audibly rolls his eyes.
Dean tilts his head back down and looks at Sam and Cas. He must notice the exasperated expression on his brother’s face, and the open look of desire on Cas’s, because he furrows his brow at both of them.
Dean frowns.
“What are you talking about?” Jack asks them suddenly, his attention no longer focused on Sam.
Sam suppresses a smile.
“I don’t know, Feathers,” he says, his voice
“I’m going with you,” Cas replies happily.
Cas nods. Dean gives him a wary look.
“Okay, Dean.”
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asks, pulling him out of his thoughts.
“You know...in the library,” Dean adds.
Cas nods and shuffles out of the kitchen. Dean sets to work cleaning up the mess. He’s not sure how Cas managed to do it, but the angel got flour all the way on the opposite side of the kitchen, next to the table. Dean doesn’t question it though, he simply wipes down the counter, sweeps everything up, and goes over the trouble spots with a wet mop. Sam pokes his head into the kitchen when Dean’s nearly finished. The younger Winchester surveys the cleaning supplies, the open cookbook and the utter lack of anything in the oven.
“May I?” he asks.

“Oh, absolutely. In fact, the stakes are
Sam contemplates this for a moment.
The angel looks him up and down for a moment, then smiles to himself.

“What’s going on, you guys?” Dean asks, doing his best to sound genuinely confused.
The older Winchester grins excitedly.
“So, when you say

“Oh...alright then...Nothing like a man and his car, right?”
Dean cautiously surveys the kitchen again. He inches a little closer towards Sam.
“I don’t know, Dean.”
“You know I love you, Dean. That hasn't changed."
After several gentle thrusts, Cas gets into a steady rhythm, finding a pace that they both seem to enjoy. Their combined moans and gasps of pleasure start to fill the room as they learn the lines and textures of each other’s bodies. Suddenly, Cas moves
He draws back for a moment, holding Cas’s face in both of his hands so that the angel is looking at him.

The older Winchester adopts a guilty expression.

he murmurs.
The angel reaches a hand up and gently presses two fingers to the side of Dean’s jaw. Dean can suddenly relax his head down, and he’s finally able to meet Cas’s eyes. He watches, transfixed, as Cas holds his gaze while sliding down Dean’s chest in the same direction his hand went just a few moments earlier. His jaw falls open as he watches Cas lick at him, slowly dragging his tongue over Dean’s right nipple. He lets out a long moan, grabbing at Cas’s hair. Cas starts to suck at the sensitive bud, laving his tongue over it. Dean bucks his hips up at Cas, delighting in the result. It’s no secret that Cas’s efforts have had quite the
Sam runs a hand over his face, exasperated.
“Okay,” Dean breathes, buzzing with excitement at whatever it is Cas is going to do.
Cas furrows his brow. He looks through the translations, stopping when he discovers a very
No, that’s not quite it.
Cas’s lips find Dean’s in the dark, and he silences the hunter with a long, lazy kiss. Content with this, Dean adjusts his pillow and closes his eyes.
“What’s wrong?” he asks Cas.
He turns his attention back to Dean. Dean is staring up at him.
“So,” he says, looking at Dean intently. “How’s Cas?”
Cas nods his understanding.

Dean grins up at him. Cas lowers himself back down so that his face is hovering no more than an inch from Dean’s.
“Not at all, Cas. I promise I’m not. I was just...
When dinner’s ready, Dean calls out into the main part of the bunker, informing Sam and Cas that it’s time to eat. Sam shows up a few moments later, but Cas is nowhere to be seen. Neither of them bother to address it, something Dean is immensely grateful for. The two brothers eat in silence, and when they finish, Dean informs Sam that he’ll take care of the dishes.
Sure enough, after breakfast has been eaten and the dishes have been washed and put away, Dean enlists Sam’s help in seeing what they can put together. They settle on giving Cas the room at the beginning of the hall, two doors away from Dean’s room. Sam’s is the one at the very end of the hallway, chosen for its privacy.
“Actually, I think I would enjoy that very much,” he decides. “We could have dinner somewhere, and, uh...perhaps we could make a romantic evening out of it.”
Dean sighs.

Dean hasn’t noticed them before.

Sam sighs, running a hand over his face.
On a morning like

“What is it?” Sam asks, closing his laptop.
Cas considers this.
“I know.

Dean stifles a moan at that. He nods.
Cas smiles at him again, the little wrinkles at the corners of his eyes returning.
Thank you so much for reading! It was interesting to write something a little bittersweet, as I haven't really done that before.
Cas nods, hugging Dean a little tighter.
Sam waits for it to kick on, but as the seconds tick by, his hope that it will do so begins to dwindle. He groans in frustration.
“Look, I don’t know...Maybe make something? Read books?”
Sam sighs.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean yawns.
“It’s only temporary Dean. My lifespan is...

for Cas. The truth is, he’s known for a while now.
“Wow,” he says at last. “That’s just...
Sam blinks a few times, trying to stay alert.
Sam hastily walks out of Dean’s room. The power returns a moment later, but Sam doesn’t care, he’s already on his way to the garage.
He opens the door and walks out into the hall, pausing in the doorway.
Jack furrows his brow, seemingly unpleased with Dean’s attempt to redirect his attention.
“You mean, watch a movie?” Cas asks.
Dean’s eyes go very wide. He pokes at his neck experimentally.
—it’s just a far cry from how Dean behaved last night. Still, Sam decides not to push it. He’s said his piece, and now they’ll just have to see how things play out. After breakfast, Dean says he has some research to do. He borrows Sam’s laptop and heads into the den area, making himself comfortable on one of the couches. Cas joins him a little later, glancing at the computer screen. Dean appears to be looking at...
“Okay. Thank you, Cas.”
“Cas...Do I
Cas chuckles softly.
Cas simply stares at him, baffled. Dean steps over towards his dresser and opens one of the drawers. He pulls on a grey, long-sleeved shirt, and turns back to Cas. The angel blinks.
Dean stares at the table, lost in thought.
“A night light? Why?”

“Morning, Sunshine,” he murmurs.
had a lot of it. But
Dean stares at Cas’s desk, trying to look for something there to distract himself. Those efforts come to a screeching halt when Cas shifts again, curling up slightly. He watches as the angel slowly slides off his pillow, making himself comfortable underneath the covers. For a moment, Dean allows himself to fantasize about crawling under the sheets beside Cas, and cozying up to him. He imagines what it might be like to wind an arm around him and bury his face in Cas’s hair. When they’re in the bunker, Cas doesn’t bother with his hair, which leaves him walking around with an almost perpetual bedhead.
“—are not being very
Thank you so much for reading, I really hope you liked it! The story is almost over, but stick around for the conclusion! It should be up in the next day or so.
“Here,” he says, walking over to Dean, “I’ll make the eggs. Go have a seat and try not to drop anything else.”
He watches as Sam quickly pieces things together, then nods his understanding.
Cas plants a long, passionate kiss on Dean’s lips by way of response. When they break apart, Dean bites his lip in anticipation. He glances pointedly at his bed beside them, then back at Cas.
For a moment, Cas contemplates telling Dean that no, that isn’t what he wants.
Dean lays his head on Cas’s shoulder.
To emphasize his point, Cas slowly slides a hand under the fabric of Dean’s t-shirt, his fingers warm against Dean’s stomach. He leans forward and kisses the side of Dean’s neck once more, his lips lingering on the skin there. Oh.

despite his obvious need for rest. He sighs.
Dean rolls them over so that Cas is sprawled out on top of him, and Cas lets out a pleased moan. He lets Cas coax his jaw open a little wider, and soon they’re sharing slow, open-mouthed kisses, their hands gently roving over each other’s bodies. When they pull away for air, Cas looks down at Dean, his blue eyes bright and shining.
“But I have to warn you...there will be some very serious penalties for late books.”
“What if you two had a date night?” he asks, yawning.
Dean does the dishes in a haze. He takes his time about it, letting the repetitive motions of scrubbing, rinsing, and then drying the dishes soothe him. He thinks a lot about what Sam told him, and a lot about Cas. He thinks about all their interactions over the years, about how things might have been different if Dean had manned-up and told him how he felt a long time ago. He sighs, staring down at the sink. He only got a

is a pretty apt description. He shuffles his feet like he just woke up from a nap, stretching as he enters the kitchen. He’s dressed in a wrinkled Journey t-shirt and a baggy pair of pajama pants. If Sam didn’t know any better, he’d think it was going on seven in the morning, rather than seven at night. His brother’s hair is a bit messy, though he doesn’t look nearly as bedraggled as Cas, who walks into the kitchen behind him. He’s wearing one of Dean’s old hoodies and a pair of sweatpants, but that’s not what catches Sam’s attention. To put it lightly, Cas’s head looks like it got into a fight with a pillow, and
“My trip?” he asks.
As always, enjoy!
Cas pauses for a moment.
He slips into their room, closing the door gently behind him. He quickly strips off his flannel, followed by his t-shirt. Dusting himself off, just to make sure he doesn’t have any hair stuck to his skin from the barbershop, Dean walks over to his dresser and pulls out a nice cologne. It’s the one Cas got him for Christmas—
His hands quickly press against the front of Cas’s chest, pushing him back.

Dean’s eyes go wide at the suggestion. In an instant, the fear and disappointment of having to leave Cas in the morning begins to lessen.
He leans over and pecks Cas’s cheek quickly.
Cas bites back a laugh.
Dean stares daggers at him.

Cas makes a noncommittal grunt.
Dean peels himself away from Cas and has a seat on the bed. He scoots himself over to the far side and lays down, pulling a pillow under his head. He then stretches out his arms towards the angel, encouraging Cas to come lay down with him. Cas has a seat on the edge of the bed and Dean quickly wraps his arms around him, gently pulling him down onto the mattress so that they’re both facing the same way. Dean wraps an arm around Cas’s middle, his hand coming up to rest against Cas’s chest. Dean buries his face in Cas’s hair, sliding his arm that isn’t draped over Cas’s side beneath the angel’s head, cradling him. Cas rests easily in Dean’s arms, and they lay in silence for several minutes, just taking in the way it feels to be so close together.
—and lets him sleep until morning.
“Not at all,” Dean replies.

Dean blinks several times, shaking his head before settling back down onto his pillow.
To emphasize his point, Dean reaches a hand between them, grabbing at Cas’s cock. The angel groans.

“What else am I supposed to do, Sam? He’s a
“No apology necessary, Sammy.”
“Every now and then, birds go through a process where they settle down and start making a home for themselves.”
“I saw that your light was on,” the angel says quietly. “I...I just wanted to make sure that you were okay.”
He looks at Cas intently. Slowly, the angel pieces together his meaning.
Dean trails his hands over Cas’s shoulders, pressing several kisses to his chest. Cas affectionately strokes a hand through his hair.
when Dean learns something else he didn’t know about Cas. As it turns out, Cas, the sweet, innocent, angel of the Lord who regularly sleeps in a shirt that says “Bee Happy” ever since Sam and Dean got it for him as a Christmas present, and occasionally indulges in PB&J sandwiches when he thinks no one is paying attention—yes,
Cas hums, watching the way Dean’s face contorts in pleasure as he starts scissoring his fingers in and out of him, stretching him open wider. He licks his lips, giving Dean a particularly

the quip would upset him, especially when Sam is chuckling good-naturedly at him like he always does when they start taunting each other.
Cas nods. Dean lets out a shuddering sigh.
He pulls away slightly, looking into Cas’s eyes intently. For the first time in days, he sees the unmistakable glint of desire in them.
“I mean, just look at his reaction,” Sam says. “Cas gave you a

Dean manages.
Sam huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. Dean looks at him for a long moment, then chuckles.
“Should we wake him?” Cas asks.
“No,” Dean assures him. “Sam has no idea about what I did...but I used his notes to help with the translations.”
When he gets to the bunker, Dean decides to spruce things up a little bit. And why not? He’s had one recent “upgrade” to his appearance, so why stop there?
He wraps his legs around Cas a little tighter as the angel’s hips begin to stutter.

Sam fidgets slightly. This conversation is
“What?” he asks.
He tries to look anywhere but the front of the angel’s pants. He turns his head to the side, staring at the wall, but right when he thinks he can relax, Cas speaks.
Cas furrows his brow, frowning.
Dean lifts his head up to look over Cas’s shoulder. Sure enough, the pages of translations from Cas’s diary are sitting in a neat stack on the edge of Dean’s nightstand, instead of being scattered all over the floor. Dean glances back at Cas and notices how the angel is staring at him, his blue eyes filled with emotion. He grabs Cas and rolls them over, laying on top of his chest. He presses kiss after kiss to Cas’s lips, moaning happily as Cas kisses him back. When they break apart, Dean suddenly seems to realize something.
“You’re very welcome, Dean. Is there anything else you need?”
“But...but if you’re still an angel, then how did you…”

and Dean cries out, tossing his head back on the pillow. The angel buries his face against the side of Dean’s neck, kissing him as he repeats the same motion over and over. He slows the roll of his hips into Dean, making sure to hit the same spot that made him cry out in pleasure each time.
Sam hums, digesting this information.
“I, uh...I got a mattress topper,” Cas offers, not even bothering to address the fact that they just made out in Cas’s bed.
The words hit Dean light a freight train. A hot blush covers his face, from his cheeks all the way to the tips of his ears.

Cas furrows his brow.
Satisfied with Dean’s response, Cas resumes his previous ministrations, bobbing his head a little more quickly now, taking all of Dean into his mouth. A moment later, Dean feels a finger pressing into him. It’s warm and slick, and Dean grins to himself, knowing that the deliciously smooth glide is being provided via angel mojo. It’s certainly the most

aspects of each other, there’s more than just simple lust at play. Dean’s hand slides up to tangle in Cas’s hair, his fingers scratching lightly at Cas’s scalp. The angel makes a low sort of rumble at that, and lowers himself back down. Dean can’t see him with his head tipped back like this, but he can

“So, you
I like getting to be close to you and feeling how warm you are and hearing your laugh and—and…” he trails off, staring up at Dean.
“You bought him something else?”
“Yes, I am,” Sam agrees, happy for the change in the topic of conversation.
For some reason, this strikes a chord with Cas.
“What the hell was
“Say no more.”
Dean lifts his head from Cas’s chest, glancing up at him, his eyes shimmering with amusement. Cas starts to rub his back and shoulders, and Dean rests his chin on Cas’s chest so he can look at him.
They have a few texts that are written in Enochian, and Cas occasionally works on translating them. Dean starts looking for loose papers on the desk, hoping to find a copy of Cas’s translation, but he doesn’t find anything. Dean suddenly realizes he has no idea what Cas’s handwriting looks like, not in Enochian anyway. And he’s only seen Cas write a few things in English. He flips through the book, looking at the strange symbols carefully. A few of them look familiar, but he doesn’t know what they mean.
Sam quickly turns back to the first page of the book and starts reading, his lips mouthing some of the words.
“Although...I don’t have any money,” Cas mutters.

“Look, just promise me that whatever you decide to do, Dean, you will talk to Cas.”

“Have you talked to Cas about it?”
Dean gets to his feet and Cas swats at him playfully.

for most of my life. I have eyes, I can kinda see it.”
“Wanna grab lunch somewhere?” Dean asks him.
. The angel returns the gesture, and Dean swears he can taste a spark of electricity on Cas’s tongue. He tangles his hands in Cas’s hair. They quickly find a rhythm, moving in sync with each other as if they had done this hundreds of times before. It’s familiar, but also exciting, and it makes Dean feel just a

Unfortunately, Cas doesn’t seem to be having too much luck. And while Dean does his best to encourage him, he knows Cas is beginning to get very frustrated.
Sam just can’t wrap his mind around it. His illusion of the sweet, innocent, angel of the Lord has been shattered.
The hunter grudgingly pulls back, meeting Cas’s eyes.

He glances over at the desk.
“I think I’m gonna change my shirt first.”
“But, uh...Sam kinda wants his books back though. If you don’t mind.”
“No one’s ever...
Sam rolls his eyes.
Dean contemplates this for a moment.
“How are you feeling?”
“He never said anything else about the rest of the bunker,” Cas says intently.
“I can leave if that’s what you want, Dean.”
He then claps Cas on the shoulder and grins widely at him. Cas feels just a little bit giddy at that.
Dean nods eagerly. Cas smiles at him, then wordlessly helps him out of bed. The angel slips himself out of his t-shirt and sweatpants, tossing them onto the floor with all their other clothes. With Sam out of the bunker for a while, neither of them need to worry about getting caught being naked as they head for the bathroom together. Dean’s a little unsteady on his feet, so he leans on Cas the whole way.
“Alright,” he mutters.
To emphasize his point, Dean reaches over and wraps his arms around Cas’s neck, pulling him in for a hug.

Dean laughs nervously.

“Right,” Dean mutters. “Date.”
Dean’s heart skips a beat as Cas stares directly into his eyes. His whole body feels jittery with anxious excitement. He pulls them a little closer together, stroking Cas’s cheek with his thumb. Dean can feel himself breathing more rapidly, his heart starting to pound in his chest. He licks his lips. Cas’s eyes suddenly dart over Dean’s features, his expression softening
“Sorry Sam, no more bags,” he announces.
He huffs and Dean wraps an arm around him. Perhaps he shouldn’t find the angel so adorable when he gets upset, but he does. There’s something amusing, and almost
Dean buries his face in his free hand.
Not long after, he’s speeding through a hardware store, finding the supplies he needs to hang it in Cas’s room. Completing that in record time, he returns to the bunker. Quietly, so as not to alert Sam or Cas, Dean makes his way to the angel’s room, juggling his purchases carefully. He carries his tool box in one hand, the bag from the hardware store looped around his wrist, while he holds the canvas painting in the other, leaning it against his chest. Dean puts everything on the foot of the bed and sets to work hanging the canvas painting with the skill of someone who knows their way around homes and tools—which he does. He then sneaks his tool box back out into the garage and decides it’s time to make his presence known. Dean re-enters the bunker with enough ruckus to draw attention to his “recent arrival.”
“Is it me, or does your bed feel a little...
Dean gawks at him, completely lost for words.
Dean wants to stay in the shower a while longer, but eventually, they have to get out. Reluctantly, he turns off the water and Cas steps out first, getting them some clean towels. Cas quickly towels himself dry, then wraps Dean in a towel, pulling him out of the shower. Dean lets Cas dry him off, enjoying the way the angel’s hands rub at him as he works down both of Dean’s arms, then his torso, then his legs. He grins when Cas playfully tosses the towel over his head, then frisks his hands back and forth to dry Dean’s hair. When he’s done, Cas lets the towel slide down around Dean’s shoulders, using it to draw him in for another kiss. Dean wraps his arms around Cas’s middle, pulling their bodies flush together. They both sigh contentedly and when they pull apart, Dean gives Cas a sleepy smile.
“I’m just worried about getting old, Cas,” he admits quietly.
“Gee,
The whole room descends into chaos as all three of them try to yell over each other. Dean snarls at Sam for barging into his room, Sam screams at Dean for not putting a sock on his doorknob, and Cas alternates between defending Dean and apologizing profusely. Upon realizing that Dean and Cas are making
Sam opens his beer and takes a sip.
“You’ve probably never had your own room before, have you?” Dean inquires.
The third thing that catches Dean’s attention happens in the last place he would have expected. He notices it one morning at the barber shop, when he looks down at the bits of hair that have just been trimmed from his head.
I know, I know. Terrible cliffhanger, I'm sorry. But hey, at least it can only go up from here!

He yawns again. Dean feels a little flutter in his chest.
Cas sighs, releasing Dean’s wrists.

for you.”
“Okay, let’s hear it.”
Like a bird’s eye view of the front of Cas’s sweatpants. Dean stares pointedly at his book.
“What do we do?”
“I don’t know...maybe...focus your energy somewhere else?”
The angel smirks at him, and Dean thinks he’s never seen a more beautiful expression on Cas’s face.

Dean fidgets in his seat.
As always, I hope you enjoy! :)
He turns his head, and Sam quickly spots the source of Dean’s discomfort. There's a decently-sized, bright-red mark on the side of Dean’s neck.
He squirts a little onto his neck and the top of his chest.
Cas gives him a strange look.

Cas swirls his tongue, and Dean lets out a broken cry. Suddenly, Dean registers the feeling of Cas’s free hand sliding down the back of one of his thighs, then coming to rest against his ass. Cas pauses, his mouth poised on the tip of Dean’s cock. He raises his eyebrows in question, his finger teasing between Dean’s ass cheeks. Dean nods eagerly.
Thank you for reading! :)
Cas steps fully into the kitchen, wringing his hands nervously. Dean immediately takes notice and sets down the knife he’s using.
Cas frowns.
Cas smiles softly at that, reaching a hand down to stroke Dean’s hair.

“Dean...I just wanted to make you understand. Nothing I did seemed to be working and—”
Sam sighs.
He’s in the middle of doing a quick scan when something catches his eye. It’s small, and Dean nearly doesn’t see it, tucked away along the edge of the engine well. As he leans closer, however, he can clearly see a thin, flathead screwdriver nestled in the space between the Impala’s engine and the shell of its body. Thankfully, it’s not in a spot where it could have caused any damage. Dean realizes it must have fallen out of his shirt pocket last week while he was replacing one of the spark plugs, and mentally kicks himself for being so careless around his pride and joy.
“Well...that’s just because I’ve had more practice than you, Cas.”
“I just wanted to make you more comfortable...I saw that the thought of you aging while I remained the same made you

Dean freezes, staring at him like he just realized that Sam was in the kitchen. Sam takes a good look at him. Dean’s a bit on the dishevelled side, his clothes slightly wrinkled and pulled at odd angles across his body. He
At some point, Cas’s focus drifts away from the animals of the Earth, to people. Or rather, to one person in particular. Dean grabs a fresh piece of paper to start translating this next bit, writing down his translations as he works. As he reads the translations, he thinks that Cas’s tone has shifted a bit. He’s not talking about honeybees with childish fascination, nor describing the anatomy of cats in a clinical fashion. He almost sounds...
“Then, I unload the groceries, we get Cas in the kitchen, so it’s just me and him, and I convince
“Yeah...Was it Dean?”
“Yeah, okay. That’s a good point.”
Dean is quiet for a moment.
Before Dean can protest, Cas reaches down and pulls the book from Dean’s hands. Dean doesn’t put up a fight, he simply lets the book slide out of his fingers. Cas holds it up so he can read, the book hovering just over Dean’s head. Dean almost curses out loud. He can’t get up because he’ll knock into Cas’s hands and make everything more awkward than it already is. He can’t exactly scoot backwards because his toes are already jammed against the headboard, leaving him with only an inch or two of wiggle room if he goes for that route. He
And that makes him in love...
Sam nods his approval.
So naturally, that means it’s about to get ruined, namely by Dean and Cas. Dean stumbles into the kitchen first. And really,

Again, Dean shrugs.
Sam ducks his head slightly as Dean tucks the comforter set under his arm.
“I’d heard about such a thing before, in Heaven that is,” Cas says quietly, stroking his thumb over the back of Dean’s hand. “But...I had never experienced it firsthand. It didn’t even occur to me that that’s what it was.”
“Well...
“Hey, Sam. Can I talk to you for a second?” Dean calls.

Dean admits in a low voice, not quite meeting Cas’s eyes.
Cas nods.
Sam turns to look over at the bed, his eyes going wide in surprise.
imply that he doesn’t like Cas exactly the way he is, but...it’s kinda nice to see that some aspects of Cas’s time spent as a human have carried over. He still drinks coffee on occasion, and when he feels like it, he enjoys catching a few z’s. Dean carefully steps into the room, making sure not to startle the sleeping angel. Forget the saying about letting “sleeping dogs,” lie. Personal experience has taught him that the rare, sleeping

With that, Dean slides out of bed and carries Jack towards his room. It would be much easier if Jack were
Dean sighs, then quickly reminds himself not to be impatient with Jack. Though he looks like a teenager, Jack has only been alive for a couple years, which meant his
Before he can do that, however, he’s stopped by a little voice in his head that sounds suspiciously like his younger brother.
Cas talks about how he wants to run his hands through Dean’s hair, or kiss his lips, or hold him tight, or share a bed so that he can wake up beside him every morning—all in the same affectionate tone as before. After a while, there’s no more denying it.
“Yeah, Sam?”
Cas gives Dean a knowing look.
The microwave dings, signaling that the popcorn is ready. Cas walks over to the microwave and removes it, then opens the bag and dumps the popcorn into the bowl he grabbed. He picks up the bowl and makes his way over to Dean.
Dean is pulled out of his thoughts as Cas slips into the bathroom behind him, hair still tousled from sleep. The angel doesn’t strictly need sleep, but since coming to live with Sam and Dean—

Dean’s face flushes a deep red.
He stops suddenly. Dean can feel his breath starting to get more rapid, his heart pounding in his chest.
It wasn’t easy to get Cas to start sleeping. But now that he’s developed a taste for it, it’s become quite the challenge to get Cas out of bed in the mornings.

in the kitchen.”
Dean says quietly, his voice full of conviction.
Dean stares at him for a moment.
Cas can tell by Dean’s tone and the way he nuzzles into the back of his neck that Dean’s teasing him. It’s a sweet gesture, but it makes Cas realize he doesn’t have an answer to Dean’s question.
Dean runs a hand through Cas’s hair, pushing it back from his forehead. Cas makes a soft noise at that, leaning into Dean’s touch. His grip on Dean’s middle seems to lessen slightly, and Dean sucks in a shallow breath. He leans down and presses a kiss to the top of Cas’s head. Cas hums appreciatively and tilts his head back, glancing up at Dean. He inches up Dean’s body, until their faces are about an inch apart. Dean presses a quick kiss to the angel’s lips, then starts to pepper his cheeks and chin with soft kisses. Cas’s arms relax around his waist, holding him just tight enough to keep their bodies flush together, but not so tightly that it inhibits Dean’s breathing. Dean takes a deep breath, relieved.
Dean takes a long drink from the whiskey bottle. Then, he gives his brother a bewildered look.
“Why would I get reading glasses?”
about Cas here lately?”
Cas glances around. He has a feeling he knows what Dean’s going for, even if they’ve never actually done this in real life. His suspicions are confirmed when Dean turns and locks the door. In an instant, Dean's hands are on Cas’s hips, pulling the angel flush against him. Cas reaches out to steady himself, and he winds up with a hand pressed against the door on either side of Dean’s head, boxing him in. Dean quickly seals their lips together once more, moaning loudly as he starts to grind their hips together. Cas manages to pull away before things go any further than that. It’s not that he objects to what’s happening in principle, he’d just
Cas kneels between Dean’s legs, nudging them open a little wider. Dean stares at Cas’s form, licking his lips. He shamelessly admires Cas’s smooth chest, his lean stomach, his strong hips and thighs, and of course, at his

The angel hesitates for a moment.

His older brother holds up a finger and makes his way over to the hutch in the corner. He pulls out two small glasses and a mostly full bottle of whiskey. He returns to where Sam is sitting and places the glasses on the table between them. He pours a finger of whiskey in Sam’s glass, then about two for himself before setting the bottle—still uncapped—on the table beside them. Sam’s going to ask what this about when Dean quickly lifts the glass to his lips and downs the whole thing in one go. He then proceeds to pour himself a second round.
He looks Dean over. Dean
Sam hums thoughtfully, then stretches.
“How bad is it?” he asks quietly.

The initial process is slow going, and Dean doesn’t have very much luck right off the bat. Enochian is a very literal language, which means a lot of common sayings in English don’t translate over very well. This difficulty is only made worse by the fact that Cas has been observing human behavior for centuries, and living with humans on a full-time basis for quite a while now. This means that Cas has a tendency to want to use idioms or phrases he’s picked up during his experience on Earth, even when he’s talking—or

good—but it’s not nearly enough. As Dean draws Cas in for another kiss, the angel slips a hand between them, wrapping his fingers around their cocks. Dean grunts into Cas’s mouth, tensing at the contact. Cas starts to quickly stroke them both and Dean hisses against his lips.
“Boy, that was fun!” he calls. “You guys don’t know what you missed!”
the angel says firmly. “Those actions are a way of expressing my love for you...If you think even for a

Cas nods against his shoulder. He sighs, relieved, winding his arms around Dean’s middle.

is the only one who gets to be a part of Dean’s nighttime routine. He gets to change into a set of pajamas and snuggle up under the covers with him. He gets to have casual conversations about whatever the two of them feel like talking about while he holds Dean close, listening to his breathing and his heartbeat start to slow as he drifts off to sleep.

Sam nods his understanding. Dean sighs.
about to watch you string him along.”
Sam gives him an awkward shoulder pat. Cas stares up at him, his eyes wide with excitement.
When they get back to the bunker, Cas manages to sneak his new mattress topper inside while Sam unloads the groceries and Dean inspects his younger brother’s purchases. After reading the instructions on the box, Cas unpacks and unrolls it. He removes the sheets, lays the topper on the mattress, then replaces the sheets with clean ones. According to the box, the topper will have plenty of time to “rise” before tonight when he and Dean will watch tv together, just like they always do. The angel is immensely pleased with this development and can hardly wait for this evening. To occupy himself, he decides to try out Sam’s suggestion.

The scene is set at night, colored in a palette of soft greys and midnight blues that actually complement the existing furnishings in Cas’s room quite well. The barn sits in a field that seems to stretch out in every direction, tucked away in the middle of the countryside somewhere. Though it isn’t an
