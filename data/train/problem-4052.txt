“And what? Finish the trials and kill yourself?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think…” He coughed. He couldn’t say more than a few words without having to stop to catch his breath. “We should go.”
Cas tilted his head.
Dean took a shaky breath and shook his head. It was not okay.
“Uh-O… Okay.” He coughed nervously. “Go. We’ll be back soon.”
Was Dean really suggesting what he thought he did? That Sam’s childhood would have been like Max’s if not for Dean who… who…
“What?! What do you mean he doesn’t pick up?!”
“Go to sleep, okay?” Bobby looked back at them. “Rest and we’ll see what we can do tomorrow, okay?”
Kevin stirred and groaned something under his breath.
It’s him. He’s sitting there with his back against the wall, cheeks wet, skin pale, palms smudged by something grey. His breathing is shallow and rapid, like he’s barely living.
Next chapter comes on Wednesday because I won't be at home on the long weekend (it's a long weekend in Hungary, at least).
“Why are you saying this?” she asked. “You can’t give up now.”
“She’s stubborn as hell” Bobby explained, loud enough for Sam to hear.
Castiel was shocked to hear Dean talking about himself like it was an other person. The demon seemed to see this written all over his face because he stepped closer to the ring of blue flames with a smirk.
“How was I supposed to know that?!” Castiel yelled back. He was now out of patience too. “I was unconscious!”
But he had to stay silent if he didn’t want to make Charlie and the angel behind him angrier. Why reason with them? He knew he was guilty for some stupid things too, like erasing his own timeline, but he had had a good reason and the result hadn’t involved letting freaking Lucifer out.
“Sariel has an eye on you.”
The blood in Castiel’s veins froze. It wasn’t Dean’s voice. Just like his eyes, it was a demon’s too. With every step the other man took towards him, the fear grew in him. It was new. He was never afraid of Dean. He feared for his safety and wellbeing, but he never felt fear because of him.
“The hell is he doing there…” Dean muttered, mainly for himself, and sped up a little. Whatever happened, they had to get there. Fast.
“We can help” Josiah volunteered. Ariel nodded. Clara too, after some hesitation. “We know the places where our brothers and sisters are working. We try to convince them that what they do is wrong and turn them to our side.”
He didn’t need any ingredients for the summoning. During his long research in Heaven he had come across an ancient summoning spell. By the description it seemed to be strong, forcing the demon to come and stay more effectively than other spells. There was just one requirement. The summoner, an angel, had to use a portion of their Grace.
“We have no time for this.”
Susie grinned at it then turned to Dean.
“Cas?” Kevin leaned forward a little to see the former angel’s face. “You okay?”
“Bobby…”
Something familiar approaching me.
“I know, Sam… I just… I want to believe that the same thing won’t happen again. That Metatron won’t turn them against us.”
Jody had looked at him questioningly when he had suggested he would go with them in her pickup but she hadn’t asked anything. Sam was thankful for that. He didn’t want to explain this too and cause more trouble for the woman.
He still didn’t know yet if Dean made it through and if he did was he himself again. There were still too many questions, too many uncertainties and he just realized how hopeless and heartbroken he felt. The Dean in the chamber hadn’t been the Dean he used to know. The broken but strong and kind man who he come to l…
I messed a little with the timeline in the Dorothy part. I don't know what Robbie Thompson thought when he wrote Slumber Party. I really want to know what he's thinking.
“Dad…” he choked out because something was gripping his throat tight. He couldn’t breath, be couldn’t move. And his father was just getting closer.
Ephraim nodded and raised his hand.
“Where is he?”
“As I already told you, I didn’t find out much. Some of the lower European gods say that they saw him about a century ago but nothing after that.”
that suddenly started
“Thank you” she said with a low voice. “Thank you.”
Becky was waiting for the three of them at the end of the stairs. She put a hand on her chin, rubbing it between her thumb and index finger.
’ Sam agreed.
“I told you already!” I bark out as the pain reaches my throat. Or maybe the Mark, I’m not sure. “I don’t want to be fixed!”
Today I decided to write the very end of this gigantic fic of mine. Oh boy.
And after losing her son, it was a good way to heal for Jody too. She loved the little girl with all her heart and the two of them raised her peacefully. As peaceful as they could in the world they lived in.
The girl leaned against the bus. And Ephraim appeared on the other side. Castiel quickly stood up.
The angel turned away slowly, drawing his knees closer to his chest.
Just in time. Hearing the noise, the front door opened and a group of men and women rushed outside and headed towards the left side of the house. Sam didn’t recognize any of them as vampires so he assumed they were demons.
Becky grew silent for a moment, so out of character for her, then sighed and shook her head.
“You cleaned the bunker?” Sam asked with disbelief.
“Where’s Cas?”
Castiel gasped in surprise. He was getting weaker with every passing second and for a moment he almost fainted. But he didn’t stop. He couldn’t stop. First he had to stop the nightmare, he couldn’t care about his stolen Grace.
said. “He’s dying!”
Sam quickly turned forward.
“This one would be the last.”
The last episode had the best ending. Ever. Shake it off, Dean!
“Sam…” he whimpered. “Beth…”
“You should sleep.”
Not that he hadn’t been protective as an angel, but it felt different as a human. Humans didn’t possess the power of an angel but they could release a hidden strength when the ones they cared the most about were in danger. Like when he had killed Ephraim back in Idaho. He hadn’t thought about anything but getting to Dean when he had stabbed the angel. Or when the ghost had threatened Dean’s life in Hurleyville. He hadn’t thought about the consequences, that maybe he could die in the process. No. He had had to get to Dean.
“Honestly? A living hell. The Leviathans have both the tablet and the prophet so we can’t kill them. The whole world is a set table for those bastards. Luckily your grandpa Henry dropped in a couple years ago and showed me this bunker. I gathered everyone I could. Garth and some other hunters. I also found Emmanuel and moved him here with his wife, Daphne.”
“You better visit me in that timeline of yours!”
The former angel quickly drove back to the storage facility and picked up Sam and Linda.
Sam suddenly froze. There was an other way. This one solution always hung before him but he tried to ignore it. He didn’t want to remember, he tried to forget its existence for years but it always came back in the darkness of the nights. But now it made its reappearance in his daily life. The very thing he was afraid of may be the only way to help his brother.
Metatron looked down at his blade then back at Dean.
“And may God bring them back to us.” Dorothy showed Bonnie an equally ridiculous smile. From the corner of her eye she saw Charlie sending her a warning gaze but she just kept smiling until they signed their ‘Purity pledge’.
to be His right hand man, not those filthy archangels, one worse than the other!
Around six in the morning Gadreel put down his pen. He just finished writing the text in Kassite, an other dead language but according to him it was steadily leading them to a more translatable one.
“What happened?” he asked, turning back to Cas. “Why are you sorry?”
“Of course you can leave. I came all this way to
Seated at the edge of the bed, Castiel looked down at his hands, shaking slightly after using the stolen Grace. He was exhausted. Dean somehow took a great amount of Grace from him and he had no idea how. The man’s body absorbed the Grace like a sponge would water, but unlike the sponge that would stay wet, the Grace in Dean was undetectable. Like a black hole had consumed it. He had to find an answer to this. If something was going on with Dean – be it either good or bad – he had to know.
As the night fall on the city the time came to finish his job. Castiel took a deep breath and walked in.
Castiel turned on his other side and curled up again.
“I don’t know and I don’t care right now. All I want to do is to pick Cas up, with or without angels, and get back to the bunker as quick as possible.” Dean looked at Sam. “You feel okay to call him?”
“Where did you get hurt?” he asked with his usual monotone tone like he wasn’t just facing a ghost earlier. There was also some tightness in his voice but Dean ignored it in his anger.
Dean stood there for a seconds, waiting patiently for the boy to come out of hiding. Then he decided to go further. That was how he had found Timmy the last time. Maybe he would ran into him just like that…
other was doing to him.
Sam stepped forward, unsure if it would be safe to get any closer to the one he once called his brother.
Cas smiled at them.
“Honey is a very wise advisor” Castiel nodded.
“What a stupid boy he is.” Despite her words, her voice indicated friendly admiration.
“Back in the church… We stepped closer to something better. You wanted to die but you changed your mind. I was so damn scared when Naomi told me you would die when you finish the trials. Then you let it go. You didn’t finish it and I was so damn happy.” Dean blinked a few times. “But when the docs told me you were dying… When Gadreel showed me what you told Death…” He blinked again but he couldn’t hold back a single tear that rolled down his face. “I was terrified. You didn’t finish the trials then you wanted to die? I couldn’t let it happen, man… I couldn’t…”
Dean tried to back away from the woman but he almost fell under Sam’s weight.
Sam acted without thinking. The years he had spent with hunting came with many actions that he now did instinctively. Like giving comfort to those who needed. So in one moment he was still leaning on his forearms but in the next his hand was already on Hannah’s.
He already missed those idjits. It was good to see them again after all those years. Sam had grown a lot. Well, not in height but in spirit. All the hardship made him stronger. And Cas. Cas showed more emotions than he had remembered. He understood humans more. And he was certain he had more human in him than angel. Good. That was good.
He didn’t expect Bobby smack the back of his head. Castiel looked up again, one hand rubbing his aching head. Bobby was watching him with a frown, the fatherly kind with he always looked at Sam and Dean.
“So… Sam told you to help me?”
“Woa, man! Easy!”
Castiel stopped talking but he already drew Linda’s attention at him.
Nervousness had settled in Dean’s stomach as the fire had turned into blue then black. The sigil on the wall had flared up, the same wall the Empty had appeared to take Cas away, and a portal had opened up with all its black gooeyness. One last check on their weapons and they’d been ready to go.
Dean bit his lip to stop arguing back. He knew it was mainly his fault that those things had happened. Sam possessed by an angel and becoming a killer, Kevin dead, Cas burning out… It was all his fault.
“Yes” he answered. “Yes, of course.”
“It’s okay.” The former angel’s voice was soothing as he spoke. “Calm your breath. You’re safe.”
Sam felt the temperature dropping in the room. Kevin put down his pen, Ms. Tran closed her book. Even Toto stopped chewing. Every eye was fixed on Dean.
Kevin nodded.
I reach for the Blade again.
“But I don’t think any of them wants to kill you” Lee reassured him and patted his shoulder. “Just thought I’d warn you before you start wandering around to have some small talk with the guests.”
That quickly made Sam stop.
A barn door.
Sam chuckled. Dean getting frustrated because of an angel’s limited knowledge of human expressions was never not funny. Even when that angel was someone who wasn’t really that someone.
he didn’t want to be alone. He needed somebody’s closeness. Someone familiar who would chase his fears away. But there was nobody. He was in the middle of nowhere, Sam and Kevin far behind him, Cas far ahead. He had to survive the night on his own.
I don't know what to think about Season 10 yet (not the best season premier so far). I'll watch and see. Also I may borrow some ideas but I won't (intentionally) copy whole plotlines.
“What the hell are you doing here, Dean?” he asked between his teeth. “If you’re looking for Sam and Cas, they’re not here.”
“Angels?”
The blade entered the skin, the meat, crossing the throttle, then reappeared on the other side. The red eyes and the beast’s opened mouth flickered with yellow as the hellhound howled in pain then its whole dead weight fell on Sam.
“You are not pleased to go there” the angel stated.
“And you Dorothy?” Suzy asked. “What made you reclaim your virginity?”
“I can’t tell you.”
With that I stab the Blade into her stomach.
“Just your average angel turned demon. You were looking for me but I decided to find you first.”
“Would a magician explain their tricks? Of course not, silly. But let’s talk about you instead of me. Do you miss it? The blood on your hands and the desire to kill burning inside you?”
“I simply banished the one who didn’t belong there” she explained. “That body is not Gadreel’s to use.”
Dean laughed with emptiness.
” The man paused for a moment. “
“Why did you give her your number?” Dean found himself asking. He crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the window as Cas turned the car around. They were heading toward the main road.
’ the voice said. ‘
“That’s the problem. Crowley couldn’t find out. Everyone he asked hadn’t seen him in a century.”
“No” he answered honestly, out of breath. “Can’t breathe. Hellhound.”
And his heart skipped a few beats.
“You were stupid, yeah, but you wanted to do good. I, for one, won’t judge you. We all do mistakes. Like Harry when he ran to the Ministry of Magic to save Sirius. He wanted to save his godfather but unintentionally caused his death. Yes, he blamed himself but he stood up and continued fighting for the right cause.” Charlie leaned a little closer. “And you have to do the same. You have to learn from this and go on.”
The deeper they walked inside the darker it became. With the opened door and being out of use for quite some time, the service was cold. Castiel’s cheeks were freezing, his fingers numb even with gloves on. Everything was silent. Too silent in his opinion. Not even the noises of the city were heard. Someone was watching them, he could feel it, the eyes following their every movement.
“It’s alright, Sam” she reassured him, eyes still fixed on her hand. “It was just… strange.”
Dean leaned his head lower so he could look into the boy’s eyes.
All eyes turned to Sam. They hadn’t heard from Gadreel since Sariel banished him from Sam. Castiel had tried to pray to him a few times but he never answered.
Someone’s about to open the Cage.
Sam let them have their moment then cleared his throat.
She would have thought about it more if not for the sight that welcomed her. Or more likely the sight that didn’t welcome her.
Beth’s eyes rounded slightly.
“Yeah… I’m myself. Still a demon, but I have control over it.”
Castiel had to look away. He couldn’t keep the eye contact because he feared Dean would see the pain in his gaze.
“You know, Castiel, I just want to make sure you’ll tell me the truth.” The angel stepped closer and leaned into Castiel’s personal space. The former angel tried to move away but the wall prevented him. “Let’s play a game, shall we? I leave you two here for two hours. You watch your human friend bleeding to her death. And when I come back and ask you some questions, you’ll tell me the truth. If I’m satisfied with your answers, the girl can leave healthy. If not?” Malachi shrugged and grinned. “I don’t think I have to tell.”
Dean angrily rubbed his eyes and looked away. Castiel understood what he was feeling right now. Being the source of everything bad without any intention was the worst. They walked on the same road.
Sam shook his head with a grin. When his eyes met Cas’ questioning gaze, he waved his hand. He hoped Cas knew he was just messing with Dean. After that comment and the growing regret he felt it was the least he could do.
To his surprise his words offended his little brother.
Castiel put the photo back to its original place and sat down on the bed. The so called memory foam sunk under his weight. He knew that when Sam had been sleeping Dean would retreat here and pray to him. He still remembered those desperate words, asking for his whereabouts, his wellbeing and begging that Castiel would look after Sam when the trials had been killing the younger Winchester.
“So this storm is surrounding us?” Becky asked as they were walking down the stairs. Sam, Cas and Hannah had been on the roof to have a better view of the ripple. Every direction they looked they saw a brown stormy wall in the distance, the north side of it closer to them.
looking and stepped closer
“Wise choice.”
For a long while there was silence then the demon started laughing. Sam glanced at Cas but the angel just glared at Crowley like he wanted to shoot daggers through his meat suit.
“Sam!” she beamed and walked to him.
“Boss left a few days ago with her husband. Haven’t heard of them since.”
“Cas?”
“So? How’s your world?”
There had to…
“What are you talking about?”
Castiel didn’t look at Ephraim as he stepped into the woods. His brain worked all the way inside, trying to come up with a good way to convince the angel that he couldn’t just kill anyone with a bad day. He didn’t want to kill him. He was still determined not to kill any of his siblings. Bloodshed would not lead to anything good.
“Come on…” Beads of sweat run down my brows. I gather every ounce of my energy into my palms and push it inside him.
Annie paled all of a sudden and adjusted the collar of her jacket.
Cas was still staring in front of himself with unfocused eyes. Hannah and Daphne talked to him but he never replied. Sam wasn’t sure if Cas knew what was going on around him.
The girl behind her tensed. Castiel wanted to turn around and reassure her that everything would be alright but he didn’t want to blow his act. He fixed his eyes on Ephraim’s shoes, waiting for the angel to finally answer. The seconds passed in an agonizing pace until…
“I did it for them” he said with a weak voice. “All of it.”
“We’re done, I guess.”
It took a while for Crowley to appear. He smoothed his suit, swiping off some invisible dust, and just then looked up at them.
Gadreel watched Castiel for a while then nodded. He raised his hand and placed two fingers on the other’s head. The angel closed his eyes and watched.
Sacrificing Gavin is for the best.
Hannah frowned at that a little and Sam suddenly feared that the angel didn’t like him ordering her around but then she looked around with the same frown. Sam sighed in relief. She was just concentrating. Good.
Charlie looked for the third angel then she noticed that he was kneeling next to the flowerbed under the window. Standing up he showed the other angels something Charlie couldn’t see from that far.
Castiel turned. Meg was laying there, watching him with a never resting gaze, always focusing on a different part of his face but always coming back to his eyes.
Castiel coughed and smiled. Yes. It was a nice place to die.
“I… I can’t read it…” Cas shut his eyes tight. “I don’t understand it…”
Everyone gathered around the woman, even the hunters from the other timeline, and waited with held back breaths what the psychic would say.
Cas shook his head and turned back to his own book.
The girl knitted her brows.
Then one day, after a half hearted experiment, the door finally opened and she saw the familiar sight of the bunker’s garage. Charlie ran to the library without looking back.
“Some other time” Dean said. “I have other plans for today.”
Dean’s breath was shaking slightly when he inhaled. He so knew that it had been Crowley. Who else would have been?
Dean leaned even closer. He could fell every puff of air that left Cas on his skin.
I dug my nails into the table to calm my nerves then pulled away. My desire to kill was my demonic side, the one that had made me think about those who needed the blood more than I did was my humanity. And the trigger was Sam and…
But the most unexpected thing happened. Someone grabbed Dean’s hand and stopped the blade just before it was stabbed into Dean. Both Castiel and Dean looked at the newcomer with rounded eyes.
Dean was sitting at the edge of the bed, leaning on his knees with his face covered by his hands. His thumbs were massaging his temples. His breathing was slow but with every inhale his shoulders raised high.
Castiel closed his eyes and welcomed the burning cold once again. He was glad Daphne didn’t mention exactly what he had to do. He didn’t want to hear it. He didn’t want to think about it.
“Dean, do you even know what you’re talking about? You wanted to sacrifice yourself
And he should definitely try
He didn’t expect Cas to start crying. His body trembled with every sob and tears steamed down his face uncontrollably. Sam jumped away from him, almost hitting his head into the car.
Castiel could cross the angel warding.
Maybe Hannah won't be in canon anymore but she'll still be an important POV character in my fic. I'll miss you canon!Hannah! You had so much potential.
“Then why does she ask questions?” Gavin tilts his head. “I don’t understand…”
Castiel’s vision blurred again but he didn’t feel wetness this time. The power drained out of his body and he felt his head dropping.
Metatron sled down the wall to the floor. Blood covered the grimace that was still on his face but he grinned widely, his features turning grotesque.
“Hey, Garth. Long time no see.”
“Do you remember the psychic kid?” he asked. “The boy who moved things?”
“Do as I say when I’m still nice” I warn him and wave the Blade in my hand. “You don’t want to meet the pointy end of this.”
“I don’t think, I know.” Metatron chuckled. “You’re too rigid. All business all the time. What would your human say?”
If more people had that philosophy like the reverend, Dean thought, the world would be a better place.
“Holy shit!”
“Cool.”
“So, we’re back to this.” He stepped next to Dean who opened the truck to take out shotguns, bullets filled with salt and a bag of everything they needed to find and burn the body.
“Just answer the question, Crowley.”
Hannah watched his face, the shining eyes and the wide grin that reflected the gratitude his soul radiated perfectly and also the warmth that she felt coming from him whenever she was around. And it was directed to her. He had never honored anyone with that kind of warmth, only her. It was only hers.
wanted to apologize for everything he had done but he didn’t find the courage. He tried to form the words in his head but they ran away like scared little mice. Yeah. He was a coward as always. Nothing new.
“Well, you can help him by taking him to the nurse office. He needs an infusion and he would be back on his feet in no time.”
instincts woke up inside him
Somebody patted him on the back. Castiel glanced up and realized that Kevin was still sitting there. The young prophet showed him a sympathetic smile.
Dean let go of Crowley’s neck and turned away fast. His head ached in waves. The pain was light then unbearable then light again. His vision blurred and his limbs felt weak. It was a bad decision to see Crowley. He shouldn’t have come here.
It was great.
Reaching out towards me.
Crowley raised a brow.
Sam shrugged.
Hearing this, Timmy relaxed a bit and stepped out the room. Dean saw the action figure he was holding between his fingers, relaxing then clenching his hand around the toy. Dean could easily read the meaning of those tiny movements. Anxiety. He had to deal with it himself.
I wandered around a little. Sightseeing, you cold say. Killed some vampires and werewolves on the way. The Mark was pleased and still is. I can hear it humming lightly in the back of my mind like a bellyful kid after dessert. And when the Mark is happy I’m happy too. We have an effect on each other, positive and negative. We’re in very positive right now.
Dean spent most of his time in the dungeon, looking at the wall, expecting a portal to open and Cas to step out of it. He didn’t know when that would happen and he didn’t want to miss it.
“Can I trust him?”
“Yes” he answered. “That is one of the many things I regret. Dragging you into this without the proper knowledge.”
“I’m watching over you, don’t
She stepped closer and raised her hand. Sam waited patiently to see what she would do, holding himself back from moving even just slightly. The girls little fingers closed around a mop of hair and she carefully moved it up and down. She did all of this with a solemn face then all of a sudden she broke into giggling, having more and more fun with his hair.
An excited grin appeared on Charlie’s face.
Hannah looked back at Castiel.
“Cas?” I call him. I can feel panic rising in me, because Cas doesn’t respond. His head would fall forward if not for my hands still on his face.
“And how did you know it was us in the first place?” Charlie positioned her blade higher, ready for the next attack.
“Trust Bobby, okay? He wouldn’t let anyone in without a good reason.” Lee turned to Meg, smiling at her. “She helped us a lot. Hell, maybe we would be dead by now without her.”
Sam soon sighed and glanced back at Dean.
“I don’t know. A demon, maybe? Can you, you know, look around the area? Maybe you can sense who was here?”
My heart stops then starts beating again with double the force. No. It can’t be. Cas still had enough mojo left to stay alive. He’s okay. He
“Wait, what?!” Bobby couldn’t believe his ears. “Your brother turned demon played hide and seek with you? Did he want to kill you or something?”
“Some Fate chick told me my soul’s a mess after everything.”
“I have no other choice. We know nothing about the Mark. There’s no other way to save my brother.”
could fix this. But I don’t want to be fixed, damn it! Why can’t he understand? I’m happy the way I am. This is the new me. This is the real me.
The portal was gone.
The angel shook his head slowly, eyes never leaving Dean’s.
“Cas?”
Dean frowned.
“Not our problem?!” he yelled. “Fuck you, Dean! What about Bobby and the others?! They were hiding from the Leviathans! What if someone lets Lucifer and Michael out?!”
“That’s not a question.” He heard Cas’ answer. His voice sounded strong and when Sam looked at his reflection he saw determination in his eyes. “I’m going to protect Dean.”
“Okay. There are two things. Crowley’s real name in Fergus MacLeod. He was buried in Canisbay, Scotland. You can find his bones there. When you get them and make a deal with Crowley, be sure to have Ca– Emmanuel with you. He will know if Crowley didn’t change certain parts of the deal.”
Dean sat through the lecturing with an annoyed face. He was at the point that if the woman doesn’t stop talking in the next few minutes, he would leave without a word. The needle was out of his hand for ten minutes now so nothing kept him here anymore. Not that it would have stopped him.
The darkness around him
“If you want to know the lottery numbers, I can’t help.”
Hypowhat? Dean blinked at the girl and looked around. She was acting rather calm despite that she just scolded him. If she was calm that meant everything was alright, right?
“You have blood sugar problems?”
The demon’s eyes widened and looked down. Castiel frowned and followed his gaze.
Nothing, not even an echo was heard in the darkness. After all that noise and commotion, this silence was the most disturbing thing Dean had ever heard.
“How do you know that?”
It took a little more than half a year to win and give the people of Oz the freedom they had dreamed about for so long. The next few months were spent with rebuilding from almost zero. But they were so happy and optimistic that they didn’t give up and in the end they succeeded.
“What two angels do in this forest?” I ask them as mocking as I can.
“What happened?” he asked.
“I’m a human, Crowley” he said, forcing his voice not to shake and reveal his true feelings. He stepped closer and put his palms on the table. “But let’s talk about you instead. How did you get back?”
“I trust both of them” Castiel reassured him. “They are good angels and would be great allies.”
Since they had found out that Dean already killed Gavin they agreed that they still had a chance to stop this. It would be not Gavin who would be sent back in time but one of them who would then stop Abaddon before she could kidnap the guy. They found the spell Henry used to travel forward and with Cas’ knowledge of the boys’ family tree they now knew that a Campbell lived in London around that time. They just had to gather the ingredients: angel feather, tears of a dragon and a pinch of the sands of time.
. Three months or four passed since Metatron killed me but I don’t really care about time. It means nothing to me. Days pass by, the world around me changes but I stay the same. I robbed a store? Who cares! Cops can’t get me. I bet some guys almost to death? They deserved it. I can go wherever I want and can do whatever I want. The world is my playground.
“Excuse me.”
“I’m fine, I guess” he answered after a while. “I was translating the demon tablet for Crowley for a while. Two of his goons impersonated Sam and Dean. Poorly. I quickly figured out it weren’t them. Then that Metatron guy saved me and now he wants to kill me because of the angel tablet. I think there’s something on it he doesn’t want us to find out. Probably a way to reopen Heaven. I’m translating that right now with Gadreel. He’s a great guy, by the way. Doesn’t want to kill me or anything. Since I can’t go outside I’m stuck in here so I started playing a lot of video games. The wi-fi is great and nobody can track us here so I torrent a lot.” Kevin finished with a shrug. “Dean annoys me a lot but I guess I’m fine.”
“I thought it was a punishment.” Castiel tried to keep his voice as calm as possible but was failing. “I thought Father Time sent me back to die by the hands of Ephraim.”
“Does…” Sam started uncertainly. “Does Father Time exist?” Then he quickly added. “I’m not asking for his whereabouts. I just… I can’t trust Crowley. He manipulated us so many times in the past. It’s because of him that Dean…” Sam took a shaky breath. “Please, tell me. Does he even exist?”
Dean let out the steam with a sigh.
The cemetery was as abandoned as it was before. Dry grass, tombstones covered in plants, dying trees. Even the air felt foul, smelling it made him sick and as the wind blew it chilled him to the bone. He was shaking, not because the weather was turning cold as the end of fall approached. He was nervous as hell and he couldn’t help it.
“As you can see, the ripple is like flower petals.” She placed together her hands by the wrists and imitated the petals with her fingers. “When the sun is setting down, the flower senses the change and closes it petals.” Missouri closed her fingers. Now her two hands made the shape of a closed tulip. “If the petals are the ripple, then the light is the change in time.”
Then he felt something soft against his back.
“Dean?”
Sam shifted on his feet.
Dean quickly got out of the Impala and stormed into the store. Some of the customers looked up at him with disapproving looks but then soon turned back to shopping. Dean didn’t pay attention to them. He hurriedly made his way to the cashier who was happened to be not Cas but a woman with long blonde hair. Nora, if he remembered correctly, Cas’ boss with whom the former angel had the not-date.
She was alive for one more day, life support kept her with her mother for one last day before her body gave up and the girl passed away. Elisa lost her will to live. Her life was centered around her little girl and losing her left her with no purpose to live.
When Meg finally hushed her last parting words to Cas who squeezed her hand gently, they were finally ready to go. There was just one thing left.
The smile grows.
“Where did you find it?” he asked. He sounded surprised and his voice seemed weaker. “I lost it after I shot Lucifer.”
“No Crowley, let’s go” Sam said as he rushed back to the library.
Hannah observed his face for a while.
“They live here too” Sam said. “The religion that created them binds them to this place. They have to save it if they want to survive.”
She heard Bobby asking about the shouting and as she opened the door she nearly collided with Castiel but she didn’t stop when he asked what had happened. She had to get back to Heaven and interrogate the Scribe of God.
New York -> 10.09
He watches me with caution. He moves his hand behind him and pulls out Ruby’s knife. He holds it up and looks me in the eyes. I see sadness in them. And fear.
Hannah was so surprised by this sudden change in the angel’s behavior that her grip weakened. Castiel lived with this opportunity. He shrugged off Hannah’s hands and quickly made his way towards his room. The angel and the hunter both looked after him.
“I see” the angel nodded and reached up to touch Sam’s forehead. The headache was gone too. “Who would want the key?”
He thought about the dream again, the one he had in the barn. When he had met Dean in his dream. When Dean had told him he had forgiven him for everything. It had been a nice dream. Saddening, but nice. He hadn’t dreamed since he became an angel again, but getting closer to his death had given him the chance to see the Dean he knew again. There hadn’t been any black in his eyes, any menace and mock in his voice. He had been simply Dean.
Sam sighed again. To be honest Gadreel had scared him the other day. The angel had taken control of his body without asking but at those times Sam was still conscious and had a say in everything. At that time however…
“So I decided to find Gadreel, get some information out of him, and lure you out of your bunker.”
Castiel followed the orders with unshakable calmness. The two other were more experienced than him in this area so he trusted them to lead him and his character to victory. He found out that he liked games more where his decisions had an impact on the outcome. It was interesting to see where his choices would lead.
Castiel sighed.
With a sigh Charlie had to agree. But Dorothy would understand it. Sam could barely stand on his feet. Cruel to say, but in a state like that he would only hold her back. She wouldn’t be able to defend him and save any potential victims at the same time.
There's a lot of copy-paste from 9.01 - I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here.
“No, Dean” Sam answers. “I’m doing this now.”
Or maybe… he could come up with something similar? Up until now every ghost they had met was real. He had honestly never faked anything. But when losing his friend was on the line… He needed something creepy. Similar to Slenderman but not the same. And the name…  Thinman? Yes. Thinman was good. He could post some stories on their site under a fake name. He would then show it to Harry and be on the road in no time. Good.
After he finished, Linda was silent for a long while. He respectfully didn’t look her way when she swept away a tear.
Dean wanted to ask so many questions. Cas started acting strange again. He had a feeling that the ‘still getting used to the Grace’ thing was a lie. Yes, he had to admit he didn’t know how his previous re-mojoing had gone, but an
“Don’t wanna talk about it” was Dean’s answer.
“It’s not important, I…”
“I remember how excited you were to go to Denver.” She raised her hand before Sam could say anything. “Believe me, you were. You were restless, always walking around the bunker, never stopping, sitting down only when Gadreel helped Kevin. And then you came back and do nothing but sulk in the library.”
“Okay, that’s settled” Dean said quickly. “I go to sleep.”
“Because it’s you.
“Yeah, it looks like.” Sam stepped towards the angel and hugged him when he got close enough. “I’m sorry, man. I shouldn’t have hit you.”
Dean nodded and, with his eyes fixed on the ground, he started from the beginning. He told him about the future where Lucifer took Sam’s body, where Dean was a ruthless leader and Castiel was broken and always under the influence of drugs.
and the
Cas froze under his hand. His fingers in his hair relaxed and he slowly, like he was afraid to see what he was hoping for, raised his head to look Dean in the eyes. For a while he just stared at him, eyes narrowed like he was trying to figure something out. He slowly reached out with his right hand, palm hovering until it finally settled on Dean’s left shoulder.
“What I want to know” Hannah crossed her arms, “is what is she exactly? If she’s a demon, she shouldn’t be able to control angels.”
Oh. That must be a sore memory. Dean looked down at the books and cleared his throat.
He finally opened his eyes
“Don’t sweat it” he had said. “I don’t like surprises.”
Theo eyed the plate warily. Castiel could tell he was disgusted by the food. For an angel who never ate – and if they did they tasted molecules – it was a strange experience. The coughing had happened to him too but he had forced his first human meal down his throat because he knew humans needed it. But Theo wasn’t the kind of angel who spent much time among humans. He didn’t understand many things about them. He felt sorry for him. He would soon face other human functions too. Very uncomfortable ones.
“He can be” he agreed.
Once sitting under the tree, Dean leaned back and watched the treetop. Some of the leaves were still green but most of it had a nice orange and red color. The sunlight shone through them and as they moved in the breeze the light twinkled. The man took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Why couldn’t anything be this peaceful? Just sitting outdoors and not giving a shit about the world.
“Castiel” the woman said with a low voice. “If you’re not telling me what happened to my son in this instant, I’m going to beat it out of you.”
“How…”
“Why were you running down the stairs?” Sam asked. “You’re lucky you only got this.”
“Beth, we are friends” he said rapidly. “We’re Garth’s friends.”
“I’m sorry” the man apologized quickly. “We were deep in researching. We didn’t hear you.”
“Keep fighting.”
“We’re desperate, Meg” Sam said.
“But he wasn’t here” he’d said with a lower voice after a while. He’d tried to ignore how weak he’d sounded. “He didn’t come back. If he could, Jack would’ve brought Cas back. He didn’t, so he can’t. Cas can’t come back.”
“My Grace is not corrupted” she said, partly to herself. She started doubting her words and it was all Metatron’s fault.
Castiel watched the back of Malachi’s head. In that other timeline the angel had captured him only because he had been with Muriel. How Malachi had found out about Susie, he had no idea. Something was not right with this timeline. First the strange Enochian symbols, now this.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry” he said with a shaking voice. “I didn’t mean to…”
“Hello?” he called out again. “Timmy?”
“I can ask you the same question!” Sam snapped back. “Cas! Who is he!”
“But why?” he asked, sounding too whiny for his ears. “Hannah, we don’t have time, we have to…”
Sam smiled at her thankfully.
“Thank you” Sam said with a low voice.
The hunter watched him for a while, visibly not pleased that Castiel tried to change the subject.
. But the vision just went on with the demon kicking both bodies with so much enjoyment Dean wanted to throw up.
Sam nodded and sent the man a thankful smile.
“I’m very curious about your story, Dean. It seems very interesting by just looking at you. Would you mind to share some details with me?”
“He was the county champion” Sam explained and sighed sadly. “He lived the best months of his life here. If not for me…”
Sam flexed his jaw and relaxed it as he looked down at her hand then into her eyes.
“I still feel bad about it.”
“Cas?” He carefully shook him. “Cas? You hear me?”
“Clara, you’re a young angel, right? You’ve just heard about Sariel, but you don’t know zir as much as we do.” Ariel’s gaze turned desperate. “Ze’s dangerous, Clara. And she controls Bartholomew and through him all of us. I’d rather follow Castiel than Sariel.” She turned to Josiah, the question clear in her eyes. The angel nodded and put away his blade.
“Cas…” Dean’s hand sled up to the back of Cas’ neck, rubbing his thumb just under his hairline. “I am real.” Then after a pause he added. “We are.”
Sonny gave a friendly pat on his shoulder.
“Sum…” Bobby looked at one then the other. “The hell’s going on, Sam?”
Castiel didn’t move for a long while. He needed to process everything. Dean had the Mark of Cain, Michael was freed by angels, he killed Metatron, he pured Dean’s soul, gave back Castiel’s Grace and now he wants him to heal the hunter. There were many things he didn’t understand and he needed to discuss it with Dean and Sam.
. Wonderful
“Yes, killing Gavin MacLeod was an unfortunate mistake, but I didn’t expect any better from you. You tend to make stupid and unnecessary decisions in the name of a greater good. Which in this situation was very uncalled for. You made everything more complicated but maybe it’s better this way.”
“And now that the angels fell there will be more of that stuff.” Charlie nodded in agreement.
Hannah clenched then relaxed her left hand, the one he had touched.
He didn’t expect the look on his face.
Daphne smiled at his panic.
Castiel nodded but then frowned. Hannah was avoiding the subject she wanted to talk about. She shifted on her legs uncomfortably, avoiding Castiel’s eyes.
Sam looked at his watch. If he was right, they had half an hour before the ripple would get to them. They had lost twenty minutes when Sam decided that a painkiller would help Cas. Only then he had found out that the Impala ran out of those and had to buy some in the closest town. Cas had been conscious at that time and told Sam to not worry about him. But Sam hadn’t listened. He couldn’t just sit there while his friend had been in pain.
He tried to call out his name but he felt something hitting his shoulder and everything became dark.
As you can see I can't post two chapters a week. So from now on for an unknown amount of time there will be only Monday updates. I'm still feeling positively about how good I'm doing. I've never wrote anything this long, not to mention posting it weekly.
The angel smiled weakly
“What happened exactly?” Cas asked, silencing Hannah with a raised hand before she could say anything.
Dorothy carefully opened the door but she couldn’t prevent it from creaking loudly. With light steps she entered the barn that was only lit by a streetlamp outside. Without a good sight, her other senses heightened.
The man shook his head. He looked at Castiel uncomfortably who understood what he wanted without a word.
“Give it to me!” he demanded. “It’s my turn!”
“Let me see.”
Dean smiled, satisfied with the answer.
“I don’t care what you meant” Hannah cut in. “And you would neither.”
“It’s not that cold.”
“Castiel. It is good to meet you, Susie.”
She looked at every little information, everything she needed to know, everything that was important for the others.
“You just arrived?” he asked as he stepped back, motioning towards her dusty cloths.
But instead Dean stretched, moved behind the driver’s seat and tried to find the most comfortable sleeping position.
‘Thank you, Elisa. Be happy in Heaven with your daughter.’
The cemetery didn’t change at all. Same dry grass, same dead trees, same old tombstones. Even the foul air is exactly like those years ago when I drove here to stop those two dicks from starting their fight. As a human I only felt how heavy the atmosphere was, now however, as a demon, I can see the air boiling. I see the sparks of tension, everything living and dead hiding in fear of what will happen.
50 chapters. I've never thought one day I will write something this long. Now look at this! And it's still not finished.
On the sixteenth day Dean was picking up the negative emotions inside the bunker.
“Yeah, they exist too.”
“Bobby Singer. From an other timeline I suppose. Missed me?”
Cas sighed with relief, body quickly relaxing.
“Nothing.” Sam shook his head, looking back too. “This was not supposed to happen.”
“No, it’s… it was one of my friend's.” Then he realized what the woman had said. “Here too?”
“Okay.” Dean stood up too. “Timmy was in the barn the last time I was here. Maybe he’s hiding there now too.”
“So it’s the three of us against the world again” Dean summed up, leaning back in his chair with crossed arms.
All of a sudden Sam’s eyes and mouth started shining. Something bright left his body then his back sled sideways on the tree’s trunk and Sam fell on his knees.
For a long while none of them spoke. Hannah turned her attention towards the towns and nature they were passing, watching humans interacting, walking. Living. They were like ants busying themselves around the anthill. Those creatures she liked to watch a lot. She admired their hard working nature and their devotion to their queen.
Dean’s phone rang not long after that. He took it from his pocket and answered the call.
“Deserve forgiveness?” I say and smile. “Neither do I, but you always forgive me."
“Are you stalking me?” Because there couldn’t be an other explanation to this.
’ Gadreel confirmed after hours of silence. He sounded exhausted. ‘
It was
his command no matter how
Castiel packed his things and took a bus to the school. Apart from him, just a few people were on the streets. It was still early in the morning but he wanted to be there before anyone else could see him wandering around the school. He didn’t want to appear suspicious. Humans distrusted everyone who didn’t act normal, he had learnt that. What if they’d call the police and he’d be taken into custody? Who would save the girl then? Castiel couldn’t risk it.
That bastard was right. This
But there was one problem and Gadreel pointed it out after he took control over Sam’s body without any warning. The Winchester didn’t have time to react and when he was about to protest he was already pushed out of the way.
“Don’t do this” Sam whispered to him, pleading, but the other Dean only shook his head.
Castiel straightened himself, still having the shadow of the proud and powerful leader of his garrison he used to be.
“I remember how angry I was at everything” Sam had continued. “The demons, the monsters, the whole world… But mostly I was angry at myself. Because what if I had done something differently? What if one small decision would’ve changed everything and Jess would be still alive today?” Sam had shaken his head, his eyes welling up with tears. “I sometimes imagine what my life would be like with her right now. We would be married by now, have kids…”
Sam turned to Missouri who looked at the man with narrowed eyes. For a moment she kept her serious face but soon a gently glint appeared in her eyes.
Dean shifted a little.
“Cas?” Bobby frowned at that, momentarily stopping him from glaring angrily. “It’s Emmanuel.”
Dean opened his eyes and found Cas gripping both of his shoulders tight. And he was gripping his arm in return. It was around noon and they were parking next to a gas station. By the smell Dean could tell that Cas filled the tank not long ago.
Dean sat next to the box, close to the edge. Too close in Sam’s opinion. He looked so vulnerable with his legs pulled up to his chest, arms around it, and chin on knees. He was rocking himself slightly forward and back and maybe he hummed something, Sam couldn’t tell, because when he took one step towards him, it stopped.
I spin around as I hear the familiar voice. It came from the other side of the crypt where I’m standing. I make my way around it, careful, not to be detected.
Arriving to the station, she looked at the large schedule, informing humans about the departure of buses and their destination. She read the city names with narrowed eyes, trying to find out where she should go next, where her lost siblings were, where they could return to Heaven.
” Dean explained. “
“Would you rather put Cas in danger?!”
“Why? Don’t I follow you everywhere you go like a shadow?”
“I know. I'm just so embarrassed, Jace. I could just die.”
But how will I find an angel willing to help me? I killed two of them, Cas wanted to kill me because of that. I’m in Heaven’s Most Wanted. Not that I wasn’t on the list already, but maybe I’m number one right now.
Bobby sighed and rubbed his eyes as he walked down the corridor towards one of the many storage rooms. He had to take a look at the food supplies and the water cleaning system and the wards and…
A shadow of hurt passed over Dean's features.
Dean swallowed down a sob. He had to be strong for Cas. He had to make sure the angel knew he was right next to him, supporting him, anchoring him into the world of the living. So he moved the blankets and climbed under those. He didn’t know if Sam was still in the room but he didn’t really care. He moved closer to Cas, put his arms around him and pulled his body close to his chest. He wanted to comfort him like his Grace comforted his soul. He had to hope, he had to believe that he can help him, that Cas can survive this. He was a stubborn guy. He would make it through.
“Because I said it” Sam nods. “Dean, we know how to cure demons. I can help you.”
“Ma?” she asked.
“Cas?!”
“The hell are you talking about?”
am strong.
“I brought him clean cloths” Castiel spoke, putting down the neatly folded cloths on a chair.
“You have to believe in yourself more” the woman said. “You have to keep fighting.”
tablet!
“And what about you, Dean? What was Lachesis talking about?”
“Why?” he asked. “What does she want with me?”
“If you lie to me, Dean Winchester, I will rip your throat out” the man said. “Where is Castiel?”
The hunter glared at him for a while. Castiel saw the tension building in his body, readying himself to shoot back a remark, but to his surprise Dean only sighed and gave him a quick nod as he turned to open the door.
“Of course I’m okay” Dean said with a big grin on his face. Castiel was shocked to see that it was
“The night of the meteor shower. One of them visited me not long ago.”
He had let himself to be misled so many times. By Meg, Ruby… Even by
“Okay” I say. “Where are they?”
By this reaction, Bobby knew something had happened to that Emma in Dean’s timeline. Poor kid… If anyone deserved to have a child, it was Dean. But he didn’t say anything, no matter how much he wanted to talk about it, tell Dean how many great things Emma inherited from him, how a wonderful young lady she was turning to be. They didn’t have time for that now.
bleeding palm.
“Are you alright, Susie?” Castiel tried asking but the girl didn’t seem to hear him. He gave up asking questions.
“You got out?” he asked, still standing in the doorway, not daring to step closer.
Tessa smiled but didn’t make any comments about his thoughts.
Cas’ eyes lit up.
“Answer the question, Crowley” Cas growled at the demon as his blade appeared in his hand.
from all person?! Didn’t he learn his lesson? Don’t trust the demon who gives you great offers but never tells you about the small letter part on the second page of the contract?!
space and it scared him
Castiel carefully stepped closer.
“They are coming from both ways!” the angel informed him. “Get ready!”
“Gadreel killed him.”
“And you. Are you crazy? Going against a demon on your own?”
Dorothy never liked these kind of things. Sitting around with strangers and talking about emotions? No. She would gladly talk about self defense or battle strategies but not emotions. After a prayer and silencing a woman called Tammy who was about to read a horrible poem, Suzy looked at the two of them.
“Let me guess. Jody?”
“What?” Cas asked behind him.
Seeing the shock on Garth’s face made Dean grin.
but he embraced it. Just like
“Do you love me?”
But he was now here in the Empty, looking for Cas.
“You didn’t feel like Emmanuel and after Bobby explained everything…”
The girl shrugged and looked away, the corner of her mouth tilting down.
Sam shifted, adjusting his legs while sitting on the frontbench of Jody’s pickup. The sheriff was driving and between them sat Annie. No. Alex. She was still Alex. And Sam didn’t trust her. She was still loyal to the vampire nest that had abducted her years ago. This whole story about the demon attack could be a trap. He had to keep an eye on her.
“Then what?”
“But what you’re about to do is stupid, even for a Winchester” he said. “I expected better from you.”
Realization hits me. He was there. He was there, but he didn’t ask for help because I lived a normal life. He didn’t want to drag me away from the ‘apple pie life’ I was living and pretending to like. That’s why he teamed up with Crowley, that then led to that horrible end. Damn, that fool…
Hannah turned around. Sam walked to them, stopping next to the angel. He looked more tired than when she had left with Castiel.
“None of your business.”
“Angels killed an other pack of werewolves a few states away a week ago. They were my father’s friends. When he heard it and found out that other packs were killed too, he decided it was better for us to leave. Garth has a safe house near the lake.”
. But not any blood. The blood of the angel who saved me from Hell.”
But he wasn’t better. Moreover, Cas was the best of the two of them. Cas wanted to stop Dean, even if it hurt him. He had known what he had to do. But Sam? He wanted to unleash the Devil itself to this world. Cas had tried what was right and Sam had almost let the world burn.
“Great…” she sighed and looked back at the body.
Dean barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes. He kept it for himself that he would still say the same thing. Sam hadn’t cared that he would free the Devil by opening the Cage. The only thing he had been thinking about was curing Dean and he hadn’t cared about Bobby. Dean so wanted to kick Sam’s butt for that.
“You know what?” Charlie cut in quickly before the argument could continue. “Text us where you are going and we’ll see you there.” She put down the phone and a heavy sigh left her lips. “I swear I almost went Kindergarten Cop on them. That was horrible. Poor Cas.”
He had gotten a message from Sam that morning, telling him that the witch hadn’t been in the house anymore but he would look for her. Castiel wanted to tell Sam to just give it up and move on but he quickly changed his mind. Sam had to get there on his own pace, he shouldn’t rush it.
“Why are you here?” Dean asked. “I thought angels can’t dream walk without wings.” He paused. “Are reapers angels?”
will go beyond my limits and do whatever I want because there’s nobody that can tell me what to do.
“What happened, Garth?” Bobby asked.
I let out a long breath and look down at Cas.
Dean watched the waitress with wide eyes. Sam could see his face becoming whiter with every passing second and the man’s grip on his list tightened. Dean looked like he just saw something horrible.
“Don’t say anything, okay?” Sam asked them. “Don’t embarrass him. If he stays like this, I don’t want him to repress his true self, okay? Hell, he can become a drag queen, I don’t care. I’ll love him, no matter what.”
Beth nodded.
Dean’s eyes shot up to his. The angel saw the anger slowly twisting his face.
Cas exchanged a few words with Hannah who then nodded and made her way to the passenger side but before she could got inside the car, Sam turned to her.
Castiel shook his head. Something stung his eyes, so he quickly rubbed them.
Claire.
Hannah fixed her gaze on the road ahead. She heard her siblings crying in fear, screaming in anger. Each of them repeated the same two names.
With a cold feeling in his chest he realized that he had wanted to do the same in desperation. He had been about to let Lucifer out when the rock hit him.
“It’s nice to meet the Prophet of the Lord.” Hannah nodded towards him with a small smile that was maybe meant as friendly but came out so forced the teen made a step away from her so Cas was standing between them. Not that a former angel would have a chance against an angel.
The boy pulled away again but not as quick as previously and his face lit up with happiness. Kid needed more compliments in his life.
“Why did you drag Cas into this?!” I continue, my voice getting louder. “If you had the Colt and you wanted me to be dead so much, why didn’t you shoot me already?! Why did you give him the Colt when he’s so ill?!”
“A child’s soul is so pure and so young, still not fully bonded with its vessel” Ariel explained, “it can be heavily altered by the angel or demon possessing it.”
had caused?” Then he continued with a loud voice. ”
“You’re from earlier.”
“There’s a traitor” she explained. “An agent who reports to Metatron and follows his orders.” She swallowed. “You’re not safe.”
“Don’t be. It has nothing to do with his angelhood. You would be surprised to see how similar you two act.” The woman looked down, rubbing her hands together. “Our marriage was never out of love to begin with. He needed an identity and becoming my husband was the best way to do that. My duty was not a union with him. I had to take care of him until the time comes when he returns to his own life. Besides. Even if I hoped that one day we would love each other like every other couple, I knew his heart would never truly belong to me.”
I mentally shake myself. My breath hitches and I grip the Blade like my life depends on it. I’m shaking. Cold sweat beads on the back of my neck.
Hannah leaned a little closer and spoke with a lowered voice.
“We won’t miss any meeting” the woman explained.
“I guess your date with our dear angel didn’t go well.” The creeper checks me out quickly, then returns his gaze back to mine. “Or not according to plan at least.”
I look around one last time. I stayed here for more than two weeks, time to move on. Maybe somewhere cloudy and rainy. I had enough with sunshine for a while.
Castiel rubbed his forehead. Why were angels following him so blindly? He was just one of them, the same as them, nothing more. Why did they still do as he said? He was not a leader. He was a soldier following orders, not the one giving them.
“Okay. What do you want? You don’t just summon anyone for the sake of summoning.”
Sam looked back at the road. He couldn’t look at the expression on Cas’ face. The pain and the sadness that was so similar to the one he had when they had thought Dean was dead. At that time he could neither watch the broken being behind the empty eyes, who had lost every will to live, who had tried everything but failed.
Cold ran down Dean’s back. Yeah, he should have stayed in his room, listening to rock or maybe continuing Game of Thrones. One hour of blood and sex. On a second thought that may not be so wise. His stomach agreed with that.
“Or maybe you value them too much. Your time among them weakened you, Castiel. I used to think highly of you but now you’re nothing. You’re just a human.”
“So?”
Castiel narrowed his eyes.
! I trusted you and you failed me! You failed Sam, you failed Cas, you failed everything!”
It was the moment something hit Dean. He faintly heard Robin screaming then he hit the closest column which was made out of metal.
“Sam!”
“Nora?”
“Morning, Cas” he greeted him cheerfully. The smell of coffee almost tempted him into throwing his diet out the window and drink a gallon of it.
Sam wanted to hug his brother so much but he didn’t have time. If… No.
“You’re joking.”
Charlie heard footsteps approaching and soon Sam appeared in the doorway. The man let a small smile appear on his face at the sight then seriousness took over again.
Sam smiled at that. Maybe there was a storm coming but he couldn’t help looking at the small but significant bright side. And this was definitely a bright side.
“And you want to change this beautiful timeline? I just have to stab Dick then everything turns back to normal. And as much as I wanted to kill you myself, I accept this offer of Lady Fortune.”
Very short chapter, sorry ^^"
While he waited for Sam’s answer he watched Maritza and her husband. Larry put an arm around her and pulled her closer to his chest. The woman took a shaky breath then leaned her head on his shoulder.
A sad smile was on his face when he sent:
“Good luck with that then” said the demon. “And now if you excuse me.”
Maybe he made a mistake, he thought later. Because as soon as Garth looked at him the man’s eyes widened and his breath hitched.
“Drink.” He offered the bottle to Dean while he reached over him to open the door on the other side.
“Who. Is. Your. Spy. Metatron!” she roared, the walls trembled. “How do you know about that incident?!”
“I don’t know but that’s not what bothers me. There weren’t any demons last time.”
“So, angels are nothing better than demons?” Jody asked, taking a sip from her cup.
Sam raised his head, eyes wide. Did Death just…
“Did my father send you?” he asks me hopefully, looking up from his burger which he eats eagerly. We’re in Rufus’ cabin. I thought this would be the safest place for the kid until I figure out what to do with him. I repainted a few symbols so there won’t be a problem.
Her vessel’s heart beat stronger and the humming was back again. There was one human she could say she was close to. One human that confused her but made her curious and…
So, what was next? No matter how hard he looked at the tablet the symbols merged together and soon he saw nothing but a big blur. Maybe he should write it down in an other language. Some Arabic or Mesopotamian language. Then translate those to Sumerian maybe? He was sure there would be some Sumerian dictionaries back in one of the storage rooms.
Was she working for Metatron without her knowing it? Was she spying on Castiel and the Winchesters then report everything to the scribe? If so, what had she already told him? Did he know about the ripple and Father Time? Was he already planning something that would stop them restoring time? Would she just lose total control over herself and do whatever Metatron ordered her?
“A wicked witch” she deadpanned.
The human smiled at that.
“Why are you giving up?” Meg had asked with a low voice when she leaned closer. He couldn’t hide it from her. As a demon she could see his true form falling into pieces, so there had been no reason to try denying it.
“Safe from what?”
“But you tell me when you start feeling dizzy” Sam warned him as he handed him the keys and Dean accepted it with an eye-roll.
“Candy’s ghost helped Sam and Dean after Kevin…”
“Why did you two fight?” she asked. “Bobby told me you’re friends. Why would friends hurt each other?”
The wonder, the hope, even the exhaustion was gone from Cas’ expression. His face was stubbornly neutral, making Dean fear that he would say he—
“Just called” Sam answered and followed Kevin. “They’ll be here in twenty minutes.”
“I’m sorry…” Sam muttered under his breath. Both his gaze and arms dropped to his lap.
“Spoilers, handmaiden” she warned him. “And yes, I’m dead serious. Last time I was just a hunter in training. Now they consider me a hero in Oz. I want to help you guys any way I can. We’ll stop Abaddon and Metatron. Just trust me.”
’ Gadreel explained. ‘
“I have the location” she said in a hurry. “I know where he is.”
“I’ll be okay, Mom, I promise. You don’t have to protect me anymore. You can go to Heaven.”
The girl’s her eye lit up with happiness at the sight of the man.
Kevin’s smile grew a little and he looked back at his work. The bubble of happiness inside Dean grew. He felt great.
A trembling breath broke out of him and he let Dean’s arm fall from his grip.
“Because I let him into Sam’s body!”
“You ready, Josiah?” the first angel asked.
Rings? Oh, yeah. The rings. They are still in my hands. First I raise my left then my right, dropping the rings into Death’s open palms. He puts his own on while he pockets the others.
“And you can’t leave him yet” Cas nodded and looked at the storage too. “So you cause a diversion, luring out the demon while I free the prisoners?”
“You seem…
Dream or not, he was sure his father would have killed him in the very moment he found out who he had become in every aspect. He had ordered him to kill Sam after all. He had beaten him prior his time in the boy’s home. Werewolf, yeah.
The angel ran a hand down his face. No. Dean should never find out. Castiel wouldn’t be able to live with the thought that Dean once again blamed himself for something he hadn’t committed intentionally. He was glad about Hannah’s actions. Dean still sent him a questioning look, but it could have been worse. He should thank her later.
“Zachariah did what?”
Her eyes welled up in tears again. It seemed accepting the fact that she had human emotions opened up a carefully sealed gate inside her.
He quickly turned his back to her and rushed away. On their way back to the bunker he had successfully locked away the memory. Even though she sat not so far from him, he managed to forget everything that had happened. He hadn’t looked at her in the car, nor in the library for too long and he had been good. But now she approached him and wanted to talk to him. He couldn’t do it…
Meg nodded and looked down at her hands on her lap.
“Crowley mentioned Dean back in the dungeon” she informed him.
“Cas.” Sam leaned over him so Cas could see him. “You okay?”
I snarl and charge at him. Yeah, good plan. I get tossed against the closest desk, flying over it and landing on a chair that breaks under my weight.
Behind him he heard Sam walking up too, hitting the shovel into the ground.
Dean nodded but he was still uncertain. Not that Sam and Cas wasn’t capable of hunting on their own, but Sam was still ill and Cas was a human. He wanted to go with them just to make sure they’d be okay but he would just rush into danger. And he really wasn’t for that.
. Probably the one who knocked him out. Was it a demon? What if the rings, the key to the Cage, were in the hands of a demon? What if they open it? Apocalypse number two?
I put a smirk on my face and step closer to the blue flames.
came to me” he informed Dean. “At first I didn’t want to use it because I believed in you, Dean. After everything you did I still believed in you!” he repeated and he couldn’t stop the pain to be heard in his voice. “I hoped that a part of the human that I knew and admired was still there hidden somewhere! I worked day and night without rest to find a cure for you!” Castiel shook his head and whispered “I believed in you…”
“Oh, Sammy.” He shook his head. “You really think you can come out as a winner?”
Hannah tilted her head.
“I see you want to tell something. It’s better getting over it fast than wait until the last moment.”
“Yeah” Dean nodded and turned the key to shut the engine. “You two stay here. I’ll have a look around.”
it was y-Emmanuel’s room. When he felt like it, he retreated here to be alone with his thoughts.”
Tomorrow looked brighter.
“Then do something. A miracle or anything.”
“He became a werewolf and joined a peaceful pack” Sam explained.
Castiel’s phone was placed back on the nightstand and he felt the bed dipping as somebody sat then laid down on it. Castiel took a shaky breath, finally opened his eyes and looked to his left.
But Castiel’s smile just widened, like he had expected this.
“Of course” Dean answered without hesitation. He’d meant everything he’d said. He would never take back any of his words.
“I knew you were trouble” Vesta hissed at her. “I should have killed you right there in the office.”
Castiel looked at her. The demon arched a brow, head turning to the direction of the library’s entrance. Sam looked up at her too but soon his eyes wandered away and a strange expression appeared on his face.
“Dean?”
Dean scratched the surface of the table lightly. Cas had a great poker face as he spoke but Dean could tell when he forced himself to be calm and not give into sadness. His lips were pressed together as he continued reading – or not really reading, just looking for something he could still understand. His fingers were tense around the book, just like his shoulders.
He knew he shouldn’t be that optimistic. Lachesis said there were things that were destined to happen. He could only hope that when they face one of those, they would know what to do this time around.
“Prove it.”
Someone had taken the rings.
“Damn straight, you should have.” She nodded and took a seat at the map table.
“What about the Leaders of Hell? The ones who are still free and alive? Abaddon, Mammon, Asmodeus, Beelzebub and Sariel.”
When he wasn’t looking Dean turned to his side, showing his back to him. His whole body was tense and his breathing was irregular. Castiel understood that he shouldn’t bother Dean now when he wanted to be left alone with his thoughts. So the former angel took a seat on the chair next to the bed and waited.
The man turned to Dean.
Hannah glanced at Dean who did the same. They disliked each other, that wasn’t a secret. But at that moment she knew they agreed in one thing. They couldn’t trust the three angels, not yet. Hannah had no idea who Clara was, knew almost nothing about Ariel, but she had seen Josiah in Castiel’s memories. Josiah had sided with Metatron in secret. Who could tell if he would do the same again.
“Do you wanna hit the shower first?” he asked while avoiding eye contact. Castiel felt concern growing in him. He learnt to read Dean’s habits well to know something troubled him.
Castiel felt the sadness spreading out in his chest. He raised his other hand and brushed Dean’s hair.
Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel as Charlie kept looking at the car far ahead of them. The sun set down behind the horizon, coloring the sky to a dark shade of orange decorated by black clouds. Soon everything they saw from Vesta’s car was two lamps.
“You think?”
“He’s a damn good one” the man added, smile growing.
was fighting. The ancient
“And you think you can kill me now? Silly Vesta. You’re underestimating me.”
Castiel looked up. He was sitting at a desk surrounded by the tallest bookshelves a human could just dream about. The archives of Heaven had the biggest amount of written documents, the earliest from the dawn of time when angels were still young. So Castiel was hoping to find something here. There must be a way to erase the Mark of Cain. And he would find it.
Sam commented.
Timmy sobbed then quickly rubbed his eyes. Dean knew he understood it. He was a clever kid. With a guardian like Sonny he could be anything.
Cas folded his arms.
Dean shut his eyes tight. Not the best moment to think about that conversation.
it. It makes me confused.
“Last time I was human I remembered mostly everything from my knowledge. This time however things changed. Last week I tried to remember the name of every prophet but couldn’t. I didn’t pay much attention to it, it was not the most important part of the information I possessed. But recently I found out I couldn’t remember how to speak an ancient language. I’m now trying to find out which one I still remember.”
“You should let the steam out” he said. “It won’t work in the long run.”
“PM” Sam nodded. “I thought you would need a long sleep so I asked Gadreel to help.”
? Why couldn’t Crowley’s kid be a dick? A demon spawn? An evil son of a bitch? That I would kill without hesitation. But this kid?
Cas looked down at his feet and he started walking down the stairs. Sam’s jaws tightened slightly but he was the one to finally enlighten him.
Hannah swallowed and lowered her hand.
“Dean and I were killed by Dick in his timeline. But in our timeline where Bobby died, he saved us as a ghost.”
“I cannot promise, but there is a chance I can fix your brother from the inside.”
Castiel shook his head.
Cas looked up at him, smiling sadly but thankfully. Dean wondered how he could still smile with so much honesty. He had went through hell, both literally and figuratively, and now he was sitting opposite to Dean, living a human life like it was the most natural thing to do.
He saw Sam turning to him hopefully. They needed this conversation soon. But not this soon.
“Thank you, Cas! I love you!”
My stomach is twisting. I was thinking about normal people who need the blood more than me? I thought about their wellbeing? Is that a twinge of conscience?
“You won’t go down that path, Dean” he told him. “You’re not going to accept the Mark from Cain again, you’re not going to become a demon ever again. We’re here to change things, to make everything better, to never do the same mistakes again.”
Dean showed him a thankful smile.
“Yeah, that’s great and everything but it doesn’t change the fact that I was murdered!”
But the portal didn’t open.
“Can I eat pie?” he asked after he got to the end of the list.
“If Michael is out of the Cage, then…” he started but wasn’t able to finish.
“The bruises on your arm when you went to Sonny’s. It was him. And you came back… because of me… You left the place you loved because of me…”
Dean raised the angel blade and made his way down. He took one step at a time, pausing to hear any noises. He was down the corridor in a few moments and after he looked around he turned back to Sam and drew a small circle above his head. Angels.
Dean slowed down and stopped, staring at the ground ahead of him, which was white in the morning frost.
Sam looked at Cas begging. He couldn’t say it without starting skirting around it. Cas sent him a brief smile then turned to Crowley. By then the smile completely disappeared from his face, his features hardened like stone.
The angel tilted her head.
“You think playing jokes with me is entertaining?”
It seemed nothing could change Daphne’s opinion about him. She stuck to her word, no matter what.
“Man! That was…”
“Ready when you’re ready” he’d said.
“I’ll have a Caesar salad” Sam said and turned to Dean.
Sam avoided his eyes and nervously played with his sleeve. Cas on the other hand was leaning on the table, burying his face in his forearms. He occasionally took a shaky breath. Hannah stood behind them with folded arms like a bodyguard, watching them with sadness. Her body was tense; Bobby guessed she was ready to jump in, whatever happened. A desk away from them sat Lee, watching the four of them with curious eyes.
They thanked the guard for his help then sat back inside the Continental.
“I've been destroyed. Socially and romantically … totaled.”
Dean shifted in his seat. That was partly if not mainly his fault.
The three angels protested, said that they didn’t need to rest, but Cas heard none of that. With Cas leading the way, the angels left the library followed by seven pairs of eyes, some reflecting distrust.
“A demon, Abaddon, changed the past. Because of this, an old friend of the Winchesters didn’t die and his ghost didn’t save him when Dick Roman attacked them. Kevin and the leviathan tablet were both in Dick’s hands thus nobody knew how to defeat them. We found a powerful time deity, Father Time, who sent us back here. That’s how we knew where you were.”
“Dean.”
Gasping for air I quickly take the angel feathers from Noriel’s pocket and zap away, and hopefully find myself somewhere where I can finally be alone and wait for the end in silence without anything coming up again.
“We shall take this back to Castiel as soon as possible” the other angel says. “Come, Noriel. He’s in Heaven right now, looking for a cure.”
No. He didn’t know that someone personally. He only saw the memories.
Gadreel turned around and Dean looked at him too. Eyes filled with unshed tears.
Castiel’s breathing hitched. He didn’t want to do it. He didn’t want to shoot Dean. He didn’t…
and he moved even closer
Gadreel nodded. He admired humans’ devotion to their families. It gave them the power to fight in any situation.
And the best reason why I have to do this:
“So?” Lee sat down at the far end of the table. “What’s the plan?”
“Why?” Metatron asked. “How does it react?”
But before he could take his bag and support Cas, he stopped. He would soon leave this place behind with all of those who he would never see again. Unfortunately he got used to the thought that they were here with him even though he had known well this time would come. The time to say goodbye.
“Great” Dorothy snorted. “Do angels have any manners? No offence” she added when Hannah sent her a glare from the other side of the room.
Castiel looked around once again, checking if he had made any mistakes, then took his angel blade and cut his hand deep. He hissed as the metal touched his Grace but he didn’t stop until there was a long open wound along his palm, showing the glowing essence inside it.
“They hid in the bunker where we live now and…” Sam licked his lower lip. “And…”
It took him a week to finally get used to night sleeping again. The earlier days resulted many grumpy mornings, but after his big mug of coffee he snarled less. Charlie gave him a few tips how to make it a bit easier like what he should drink before sleeping and what to eat in the morning. He was thankful for her help. She was like a cool big sis who took care of him and whom he could play a lot of video games. They played Pokémon X and Y and he finally managed to finish Alan Wake. Charlie helped him find all of the pages and pointed out and explained every reference they came across. Charlie was a smart gamer so he didn’t mind her talking a lot.
“Fine, I guess” he said. “Gadreel’s still healing me. What about Dean? Is he there?”
I zap away, leaving the hidden door open.
Hannah’s eyes widened in fear and all color drained from her face. He didn’t know angels could pale but it appeared they could.
And with that Charlie’s all attention was on Cas again and she just talked and talked and Dean just smirked as the former angel tried to find a way out of this situation.
Hannah shook her head.
Castiel sighed. He had to agree with Lachesis. Their search was basically a quest they had to struggle with. And also he didn’t think Atropos would have helped them. He was sure she was still angry at him.
He wanted it to be over right
A few days after Sam first summoned me I went down to Crowley. After just one glance the demon could tell something was not normal. As a human turned demon can be normal.
Dean watched him, eyes wide like Castiel just made a miracle. Maybe he did, Castiel didn’t know what was in his young mind.
“Wow. Okay.”
“Dean…” Castiel started but the man quickly put up a hand.
The Men of Letters had a lot of medkits around the bunker. One of them was in the library. Bobby put it on the table and took some gauze out of it and carefully stuffed it into the angel’s nose.
