He rips at his hair and tries to breathe. His crotch feels wet and messy and foul. An exit sign beckons and Steve kicks the door open with more force than is strictly necessary and gulps in lungfuls of foul city air. The smell of sweat – bodies – cigarette smoke – abruptly gives way to the garbage smell of New York at night.
“I got back. Let me take you to the hospital,” Steve says. He is proud of himself for not using the Captain America voice.
“I’m not going to the hospital,” Tony says, and there’s not even fight in him, he just tilts his head back like he’s trying to melt into the wall. He squeezes his eyes shut and takes a shuddery breath. “I don’t want to fight, ok, just, I need to regroup–”
He’s ushered through the velvet rope and through the doors emblazoned with a large 54 and into a tiny foyer. “Fifteen,” the man says with a gummy smile.
The man looks to be about Tony’s height, towering over almost everyone on the dance floor, his movements loose and easy and confident. He strides, people part for him. Half his face is hidden by some ridiculous mask like what Steve used to wear – and that sets off little waves of something sharp and leaden in Tony’s gut – but this man is
Tony has heard that language before. In the bill for Project Wideawake. They want to test him. They want to do experiments on him. They want to know what he can do.
After Paris, before Tony left and came back with fancy new toys for the rest of the team, they sat on a Quinjet and Tony held a bottle in a paper bag on his lap.
Steve sits up, chest to chest with Tony, and Tony gasps and throws an arm out to clutch at the back of the sofa.
She's running. Tony smells grass and autumn night and dew and the river. He's home, he must be home. There are voices all around and his vision is spotty and he insists, weakly, that he can walk himself. That it's not so dire.
“The worst part,” Tony says, with a hollow little laugh, “The worst part is everyone knows I’m not good enough for you,” he finishes in barely a whisper. “I have to convince myself every day, I see you – out there, people love you, Steve.”
Tony's skin is on fire. He tries to shift around in bed, thinks distantly of levering himself up and into the shower, and pain shoots up his spine. His pelvis burns. He fumbles one hand behind him to try and pull out the plug but it's agony to move.
, he wants to say, but he feels as though he has been bolted to his seat. Maya is saying Tony hired her to control the research.
He wants to scrap the mission, but Steve has never really gotten what he wants, so a few reckless decisions and accidental deaths later, their recon is done and there are no AIM prisoners to interrogate. Steve gets home a day earlier than expected and Tony meets him at the door, hospital tag still around his wrist, shuffling his feet, his face sallow and quiet and ashamed.
Tony jerks, and bites back a scream as pain lights through him. He falls on his broken wrist, and Steve pushes his hips down. A warning. The sheets abrade his oversensitive skin. He tries to push up on his elbows and notices not one, but four Androderm patches on his forearm in a neat little row before his shoulder gives out and he falls hard.
Do you want me to let you die, Steve asks. Is that how you wanna go? Do you want to leave me this way?
It’s a bad week. One of Tony’s missiles blows up an entire squadron of Special Forces in Afghanistan, and Tony takes the opportunity to take it personally. The tower is crawling with reporters, so Tony’s response is to sleep it off and hope it goes away.
Steve's feet are thrown over the lip of the bath, his body too monumental for something as pedestrian as a bathtub. The water is brighter red than Tony expects. Steve's thighs are just under the surface.
Steve takes the path through the park. His feet pound the pavement. He pushes himself, wants to feel air burning his lungs, wants to ache. Wants, with every cell in his body to turn around and go back to Tony’s apartment and wake him up and kiss him until he can’t breathe.
Steve waits, entirely still, lets his anticipation coil and dance and thrum underneath his skin. He wants it, he would do anything for it, he would say anything, he would be a terrible spy, it’s been months since they’ve done this and all he wants is the taste of Tony’s skin and Tony has to give it to him, Jesus, he’s whining, he must be beet-red, his balls are covered in his own slick, Tony knows, every time, exactly what to deny him.
There’s just Tony’s wet moaning and Steve’s gasping sobs for a moment, and then Tony just catches the flash of Steve’s shield coming down in his peripheral vision, shining in that sliver of light.
“Don’t say that,” Steve says, hideously embarrassed, Christ, he can feel the blush all the way down to his chest.
His gaze goes hard and angry and Tony can’t look away. Steve doesn’t have to move a muscle in his entire face, his eyes telegraph everything and anything Tony could ever hope to know.
, Steve thinks. Tony shifts the angle of his body, leans back on his shoulders and they slot together so tightly Steve gasps on the next thrust. Steve splays one of his palms over Tony’s chest, over the scar from where Extremis fixed his heart, feels his galloping breath, pushes back unexpectedly, quickly, one hard grind that buries Steve to the hilt and it’s so good, it’s intoxicating, and Steve’s hand leaves his hot skin to find the wretched identicard somewhere on the coffee table –
No, Tony says, as boldly as he dares. He pulls away. He moves his legs after what feels like an eternity, frozen beneath Steve's body, subsumed by the ultimate violence of his rut. He shifts his weight and can't help the moan that falls from his mouth. His gland feels raw as an open wound.
You fucking abandoned me, Tony tells him. And I can't even smell you. I can't tell if you've been fucking someone else.
“I don’t know how to do what you’re asking,” Reed says, his hands up, his monitors abandoned, the blue glow spooling over his face in the early hours before sunrise. “I don’t, AIM has been working on it for years, there’s a sizeable difference between looking at another universe and getting to it–”
. Tony's heart feels loud and too fast. He's burning. He feels his forehead, just to be sure. Steve, he cautions, and Steve is already denning, locking the door, drawing the shades on the window.
” Tony mumbles. “It could literally be anyone, take your pick, I put half of the superhuman community in prison and I got Captain America shot and all my friends are dead and all my partners fucking
and then Tony is twisting one of Steve’s nipples. It’s dirty, it makes Steve shake and gasp and his mouth opens and some of Tony’s come is spilling out of his mouth and Tony
Tony doesn't need the bond to sense his increasing desperation. Steve has always been terrible at recognizing his own ineptitude.
Steve’s breath is ragged and ugly and the music is loud and relentless and he rises to the invitation with a shamelessness he didn’t think he was capable of. The man’s throat makes a noise every time Steve pulls out that drives him closer to the edge. He puts his hand back up on the wall, lets the drywall crack, revels in the headiness of this place, this moment, thoughts darting in his head:
Tony has a role. They're mated. He should touch Steve's face, and kiss his eyelids, and tell him it's going to be fine. That they're going to get through this.
He doesn’t realize it’s welling in him until he is shaking with violent, silent sobs. He puts the helmet down but it’s too late already, he’s already sitting back beside Steve’s body. He tips his forehead to the A like it’s Steve’s forehead and not some pathetic stand-in.
He should go see Tony in person, but he knows if he does, he’s going to have to look at Tony. He'll have to behold Tony's grief and Tony's shame and he'll get upset again. He'll lose what little nerve he has.
Maya Hansen is walking down the aisle, sitting down, shrugging off her trench coat, pulling a thick stack of files from her bag –
Tony tries again for a kiss, but Mystery Man plants a hand on Tony’s chest. Nudges his other hand up under Tony’s ass and jerks him closer, watches Tony’s face, inscrutable. Tony can’t stop looking at his mouth, at the way his lips part.
“You look like someone I know,” the man is saying, and he probably doesn’t think Steve can hear. “He got away.” It strikes Steve as the wrong thing to say when he’s kneeling in glitter and filth and Steve’s cock is jutting out of his suit like he made this costume expressly to take it off and the whole thing feels sordid and miserable but somehow he can’t manage to stop touching the guy’s hair glinting in the light from the disco ball. It reminds him of Tony. Tony’s hair always started to curl when it let it get long.
Tony doesn’t meet his eyes. “And I didn’t mind it,” he says, like if he wants it badly enough Steve won’t hear it, maybe.
Steve has been putting out Fight for hours, ever since they pretended to be civil and chopped wood and Steve puts two fingers inside Tony's body and tests him for ripeness and Tony's world tilts on its axis.
“I’m sorry,” he says, because the list is long. Abandonment, failure, heartlessness. He doesn’t know which one he’s apologizing for just now.
“No,” Steve says, firm, because tenderness is not the order of the day, “wait.” He wraps his entire hand around Tony’s half-hard length. It’s more of a massage than a hand job: Steve pulls down the entire length, soothes his thumb over Tony’s velvety skin, so careful to let the tips of his fingerless gloves catch just enough for Tony to feel it, Tony loves that. His eyes are closed, he's holding himself back from thrusting himself bodily at Steve. He hardens up quick, so Steve plays with his balls, hefts them in his palm, runs them around in his hand, pulls ever so gently.
It's dark. The window is open. Steve is brushing something over his forehead, is peeling off the patches on his arm. Maybe not, the hands are unsteady. Very un-Steve-like.
Steve wears crisp slacks and a jacket and a dress shirt buttoned all the way up. He limps to their booth like an old man and gets some cruel measure of satisfaction out of the way that Tony hovers like he doesn’t know what to say, what to do, how to help.
He limps in, barefoot. He carries his IV bag with him, dangles it from one finger. It takes all his strength to open the door.
Tony laughs; it’s not kind. He bends, kneels, takes Steve in hand. Steve is leaking; he can smell his own arousal, can smell Tony’s, can feel his balls brushing the carpet. Tony rolls them in his hand, feels out the shape of each one with his fingers. Rests them in his palm like he’s gauging Steve’s enthusiasm.
Tony gasps a little and Steve feels drunk with the power. He did that. Emboldened, he smoothes his hand down Tony’s chest, and Tony lays back, watches him with wariness and hunger, both. He runs his fingers over Tony’s balls and realizes he’s holding his breath. The shape of Tony mesmerizes him; he would do this forever if Tony would let him.
Steve is at the landing when he hears it, and it’s bad today, because Tony isn’t even trying to stifle the ugly wet sobs Steve can hear coming through the heavy oak door.
Steve hauls him up again, levers one thumb into Tony's pressed-together lips, pries his jaw open. Open your mouth, he snarls. Steve holds him like that, with one hand. Jerks himself off onto Tony's face with the other. Some of it lands in Tony's eye. Steve looks in his mouth, even as Tony is starting to drool. Spits, once. Closes Tony's mouth, puts his hand over it. Swallow, he says, and he feels Tony's throat as his adam's apple bobs over and over.
He’s not sure what compels him to press the tiny recessed button on the side of the card, but he does it.
He knows the voice. He knows it. It’s just out of reach and Steve lies on his back and tries to ignore the pain and looks for the name, he knows he has it, damn it, he knows it, he knows it –
He lets himself have it. He acquaints himself with the concrete. He tries to still his racing heart. The thing on his ankle catches the light from the tiny slit in his door and shines.
“You’re turning into your father,” Steve says, because he always comes back and Tony is losing his fucking mind. He covers his eyes and rocks himself back and forth on the tile in the foyer and thinks of the taste of whiskey.
Tony shifts his weight and Steve has to swallow down a gasp because even though he’s going a little soft, he can feel everything, he’s still inside, and this is the wrong time and place to be having this conversation –
“Let me see,” Tony says, and he’s there, forcing Steve to open his fist, hot and warm and alive. “Ok, hey, I’m sorry,” Tony says, “Look, you’re already healing–”
The metal snaps into shards. Less flexible than the last iteration. Tony can make him a new one when he’s feeling better. No one needs him that desperately.
“I miss you when you’re not here,” Tony is saying, and Steve feels Tony’s length drag along his tongue before Tony’s back in his throat again. His vision is collapsing. He doesn’t mind, it’s nice here. Blood roars in his ears.
Okay, Steve says. He sounds tired. He sounds like he sounded after Insight. Eager to relinquish responsibility. Weary of the game. You still - do you want my skin? You're still not stable, he says,
What the fuck did you take, Tony says. He tries to weigh the likelihood he will come out of this alive. He tries to determine if this is his last opportunity to be honest.
Steve licks at him like if he tries hard enough, he can singlehandedly coax Tony into wetness. He bites at the insides of Tony's thighs. He buries his face in Tony and Tony buries his face in the shitty hospital bedding he bought a lifetime ago and wills himself to open, to bloom again, to self-repair. If he were wearing the nanotech he knows it would erupt on his chest.
“Shut up, Mike,” Gary says, breathless, as they slide their window open. “You’re gonna wake Steve up.”
Steve looks at the thing in his hand and fumbles it; tries to look at the face of the card, he could swear that there’s something there, faded writing - if he looks at it the right way there’s a shadow that looks like it could be –
Tony calls it rehearsal and locks himself in his office and lets his eyes go white and tells himself that one day he will be past this. Regret is a problem, just like grief. Just like shame. Every problem has a solution.
“Ultron programmed her,” Tony mumbles. “I don’t think I can handle that, if she goes, too, Steve, everyone turns on me or, or, or leaves.”
It’s been some time since Steve has seen Tony in a suit. He’s thinner now, less bulky. He can’t train like he used to. Steve will never flip him onto a gym mat again. He’s no less attractive, objectively. He’s wearing a red shirt, some dark grey 3-piece thing. It’s an event. Steve’s noticing now, the way he actually showered, did his hair so it flips, dabbed cover-up under his eyes because the paparazzi drift around them like a gathering storm.
” Steve says, and rests there, on his elbows, and that’s when he feels Tony’s cock still bobbing between them.
“I love you,” Steve tells him, and Tony’s eyes snap open. Steve slides down to the floor, both of them on their knees. Tony watches Steve’s biceps, hungry, subdued, as Steve reaches around behind him, snags the jock with one finger, pulls it into his own lap.
Steve breaks the mug. He’s vaguely aware of the coffee spilling over the side of the counter. He steers himself to the sink, tears in his eyes. He fumbles with the faucet, runs his hand under cold water. It doesn’t matter, he’ll heal. Nothing is permanent.
There’s no mud on his jacket. The piece of paper with Steve’s eulogy is soaked through. His words look like they’re dissolving off the page. He balls it up and whispers it to himself under his breath.
The man looks at him a little too long, nods, jerks his thumb. “You’re in.” His voice is straight Brooklyn.
“That’s your excuse,” Steve says, and blinks and blinks because he’s ruining Tony’s coffee. He rummages in the cabinet for his French press, shoves his kettle in the sink, opens the coffee bag so forcefully he rips the side of it. “You’re really gonna commit to your stupid sacrifice play–”
“I know,” Tony soothes, and slides a hand around Steve’s cock, teasing, loose, not enough for pleasure but just enough for torment. “You wish you could stop,” he whispers, “but here you are, Steve. I wish you could see this. I wish
“If you weren’t an alcoholic, I wouldn’t have to,” Steve tells him, and Tony closes his eyes as if he can will him away.
“You can be mad at me,” Tony says. “But I am not responsible for your survivor’s guilt, that’s not fair.”
Steve doesn’t want that. He’s greedy. He crowds Tony against the island, hops him up on the counter, and Tony goes, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist. It’s novel, having Tony tower over him. Tony must decide it’s ok, because he tangles his fingers in Steve’s hair, commits to
Tony puts his head between his legs and seriously considers re-crushing his hand between the table and the arm of the chair. He slips his hand into his pocket, instead, tries to fumble the lid off his prescription bottle and his little white pills go spilling out all over the floor.
He is perfect and useless and whole. He touches his throat, looking for bruises, but there’s only sweat in the hollow of his throat and his racing pulse.
He understands, now. He can’t treat him like a child; it’s too much of a tip-off. He never would have done that before, he can’t do it now. Explosive anger has never solved anything for him, either.
Tony lets his filters come up, lets himself slide sideways. The feeling of the paper under his hands goes away, the weight of the crowd’s silence fades into white noise. He blinks and blinks and blinks at the microphone. He is very distantly aware that someone is taking photos of him.
Steve puts his hands everywhere, gentle until he forgets to be gentle. He folds Tony like a pretzel like he does when he's in rut. He hikes Tony's gown up, pulls his ankles apart, dives in like Tony's body still belongs to him.
It’s not untrue. He thinks about the letter he wrote and thinks about what came before. A band-aid slapped on gaping wound.
Steve was always good at reading the room, knew how to shock and awe and sober. Knew when he’d slipped back into the past. Knew when to leave.
He dresses in the dark, slips out of his underwear and slides into his lurid second skin. If he leaves, he doesn’t have to listen to round two. He doesn’t need to fester in his own hideous loneliness. He needs to be elsewhere. Saturday night, he’ll patrol. Maybe he finds someone who needs saving, maybe he finds someone who needs punching. Tony used to call it ‘expressing his rage,’ but Tony was joking.
Tony reaches, for the first time since he laid there in that fucking bunker freezing to death. He plucks at the string. And this time, he finds absence.
. He can’t stop his hands from roving over Tony’s bare skin, the shudders that would be imperceptible to normal unenhanced humans are music to him, and he maps the roiling of Tony’s muscles and the shuddering rhythm of his breath. Tony’s body opens to him like they were both made for this, like for a few moments all can be right with the world, and Steve bends to kiss his chest and plants his hands up by Tony’s head and moves.
The first time is miraculous, even for them. Tony has the scents of so many people on him by the time they even make it into bed. He's old. He has not been careful about who he's let use him. Free with affection, bombarded with heartbreak. Guilty, blown up, shredded, stitched together. And again. Alive until the day he's not.
“Don’t tease,” Tony all but moans, but he’s levering himself upright, already fitting his body back around Steve’s, curling around him like a snake, wrapping his smaller hand around Steve’s massive fingers, stroking the head of Steve’s cock and all but ignoring his own –
“They should just hang me,” Tony says, but the joke falls dead on arrival and he feels lightheaded and like his limbs are prickling with pins and needles.
Tony was so willing, so beautiful and strong and cocksure and he was so lost, and there they were, two opposite polarities orbiting around each other until they snapped together.
he says. He slides into panic and gulps in breaths of air and moans because his ribs are broken. Steve holds his body and feels his lungs fill with air, feels his bones shift beneath his burning skin, brushes dirt and grit out of his hair.
Tony’s head snaps up, because he said no flyovers. No interruptions. A sacred place. He barely catches the gold before it runs past the hems of his sleeves and creeps up his neck. This isn’t going to be a war zone.
“Oh my god,” Tony says, when Steve pulls away, low and subdued, like the shock is settling over him in a slow wave. He jostles himself while Steve sits with his own smugness. “I can’t - I can’t feel. Steve.
Tony lies there. His body will be jerking in his bed as Steve breaks his body, as Steve’s shield flakes his armor away like it’s nothing. Tony prefers not to fight, here – he likes to watch Steve’s face. It’s a side of him Tony didn’t get to see until the end. Like all of his restraint and all of his patience had drained out of him all at the same time. Like Tony. No, this time he’s a silent observer. Steve punctures one of his lungs and Tony smiles through the psychosomatic blood in his teeth.
Steve closes his eyes. Of all possible outcomes, this is his luck. He laughs, because it’s not funny, none of it is funny.
“Fuck,” Tony says, and his eyes are wet, and all the anger Steve thought he’d worked out on his run comes rushing back. Tony sees Steve, then, startles so hard Steve actually drops his shield and raises his hands. Tony deflates, casts his eyes around like he’s been caught. The sink is full of bandages. He sways unsteadily.
“I care about you,” he says. “That feels like a lifetime ago, Steve, I thought. I’m trying to do better.”
You're bondsick, Tony, Steve reminds him, and it is the most condescending thing Tony can fucking imagine.
There is an itch. He doesn’t recognize it; its presence is baffling. Once upon a time he might have suspected someone was leaving him a dead drop, but now he’s a feeble irrelevant thing. People don’t bring him missions anymore. He flips it over - nothing on the back, just a stamped logo that says Stark Enterprises.
“I have work,” Steve says evenly, and if it’s a half-truth, Tony’s been telling him half-truths from the start, hasn’t he. He has people to extort. He can’t even help himself from looking at his watch; he’s due back at the airport in 2 hours. “We said that we would make the distance thing work, Tony–”
Tony sits on the floor. Once the armor has been called, once he has been swaddled in red and gold, he locks down the tower and brings the Faraday cage down and locks the workshop and scans and scans and scans.
He reminds himself: he wanted it this way. Anonymity. Wanted people to stop looking at the flag, at the legend. Wanted people to see him.
It’s generally not so easy. There must be some caveat, one of Tony’s secret stressors that eats away at him on his own time. Something to deal with later. Tony’s eyes are closed, and Steve reaches one gloved hand to stroke at his face, to slide his bare thumb into Tony’s easy slick mouth.
“It’s ok,” he says, more for himself than for Tony. He looks at the wall behind the headboard. “Are you ok?”
Steve gathers Tony's arms up behind him, wrenches his arms back. Leans down on one elbow, presses Tony with his full weight. Let me in, Steve says, bending to bite Tony's ear. He licks over Tony's gland, only glancing, and the pain is so sharp that he is certain he's going to vomit.
Tony has a sheen on his face, one perfect tiny ringlet of hair plastered to his forehead with sweat. Standing in the moonlight, the angles of his face are sharper – he’s lost weight. He skates the edge of good bone structure and junkie pall. His hair is just long enough to be rakish without looking scraggly. He’s wearing eyeliner like a rock star and a few delicate gold chains hang from his throat – more misdirections. He looks high, he looks dangerous. He looks like the kind of guy Steve might take pity on in daylight.
Tony runs his fingers over his chest, under the collar of his shirt. Over the port where his fake heart used to be.
“You can pretend,” Tony says, and lowers his voice to that cadence he keeps for his lovers. “We can both pretend?” Steve lets his eyes drift back to Tony’s eyes, and that’s a mistake; he can’t stop looking. Steve wants him, all of him, friend and lover and teammate and confidant, wants all of him from the eyeliner to the cut of his clothes and the hair curling over his brow. He’s wringing his hands, he’s barely hard. His nose is bleeding. “I could go all night with you,” Tony tells him, and Steve actually balls up his fist.
You smell atrocious, Steve whispers. Like. Rancid, he gets out. You smell like you're dead already but I can feel how much you hate this and you keep saying you want it and you don't, I don't.
“It’s,” Steve pauses. The rhythm is not one he's used to hearing from Tony. Regular. Something else underneath it. “Are you okay?”
Don't fucking touch me, Tony snarls. It comes out as more of a slur. Too much Androderm, too many raging Alpha pheromones on his skin, rubbed into his mucous membranes, dripping into his eyes. How dare he. It threatens to swarm him. Tears prick in his gummy eyes. How
Steve kisses him full on the mouth and Tony moans into his mouth, bereft, betrayed. Steve enjoys it. He enjoys making Tony speechless. It’s a rare joy.
There isn’t long, Tony knows that. Extremis is in its own death throes, flipping wildly between the hulking Helicarrier wreckage and trying to feed him information about his spinal cord, severed in two places. There’s nothing for the enhancile to do – he lost too much of the volume of it when Steve ripped his armor off his chest with his bare hands. He’s too far afield to swing regeneration like this. He’s not going to make it.
Tony lets himself have the almost-silence, runs his hands over the silk of his vest, loosens his tie, waits for the world to recede into something better, something nicer, something less wild and sharp. Euphoria without connotation. Better to do it here than the main level; there are cameras sometimes. He thinks about the team seeing photos of him here, imagines Jan’s face. He should have talked to Rubell about that. Pepper doesn’t even tell him he needs to get out more, anymore, she just tells him his schedule and gives him his coffee and looks like she’s going to cry when he tips Jack into his cup.
The man laughs. “Once or twice,” he says. His voice wavers a little. He hesitates. “I’m Tony,” he says.
Tony kisses him like he’s not holding a mouthful of semen, like it’s a game, like it’s a test. Steve keeps his mouth shut at first, his head buzzing with
Tony leans forward, kisses Steve, and Steve should have known that he was never going to get all of Tony, just pieces, just like it’s always been. Tony’s too big. Larger than life. Tony licks around Steve’s mouth like he’s going off to war and he intends to make an impression. It seems like it lasts forever. It’s almost enough.
They wait in a conference room and Tony feels dull and tired and middle-aged in his ill-fitting suit. Jen slaps his Klonopin into his hands.
Tony holds him up, cradles the back of his neck, rubs his thumb insistently against the underside of Steve’s cock. Looks at him all the way through. Steve feels lightheaded and erased, can’t imagine what his cock looks like, how obscene it must look. His pulse throbs in his neck, in his forehead. He feels his own cock jerk in Tony’s hand bump against his own stomach.
He’s not here as a hero tonight; he threw that excuse away the minute he let the man at the door undress him with his eyes and stepped through the doors on his own two feet. He has spent so long feeling old and he has hidden himself away and here, he’s just another beautiful body.
Tony wants to tell him he's already lodged. That he wouldn't know where to begin the process of excision. That the problem has always been the two of them, living, dying, entangled.
“Your taste in partners is consistently terrible,” Steve agrees. He’s perched on the edge of the conference table, picking at the shreds of his uniform.
The curtain around the freestanding bath is drawn. The room smells like tobacco, like clay. The water sound gets louder and he steps barefoot into a cold puddle of water that bounces the scant light of the sunrise around the room.
Reed looks at him, all fathomless hate and onerous betrayal. Steve thinks it’s more emotion than he’s ever seen from the man.
Tony’s been on the phone with Ross for an hour. He paces. He twists his watch, he drags his feet. Occasionally he breaks his circuit to wander over to where Steve has been arranged so he can slip the pad of his thumb into Steve’s mouth.
The elevator stops and the lights don’t come on. They crowd him; someone is on their knees and putting their fingers in his hair. He bites someone’s bare arm and gets his face bashed into the tube wall for his trouble. They hold him there, his legs twisted under him, one of his eyes swollen shut, his breath coming in ragged wheezing gasps.
It’s not what he wanted, not exactly, but it’s closer. It’s further away from kindness. It’s more like a favor. It’s more impersonal. He probably would have died if he’d been allowed inside Tony’s body. It’s probably not the sort of drug you can try just once.
Steve sucks in a breath. He can’t stand it, not knowing. “Did someone do this to you,” he says. “Is someone – geez, Tony, you look like hell–”
Steve is laughing at him. “Look at you, terrorizing innocent civilians. You honestly believed people would just look at you and see their savior?” He steps right into Tony’s space, and a shiver of pure icy fear runs through Tony. Steve stands like he’s about to throw a punch. “Look at yourself.”
Steve’s spandex leaves little to the imagination, and the man cups Steve’s balls through his pants, gently, hefts the weight of him in his palm. “You’re big,” he says, all throat, with the sort of gravel that chain-smokers have. He trails the tip of his finger over the head of Steve’s cock where it’s pressing up against the seam.
When Tony inhales, he smells the desert. He smells the dank of the cave, and the precise reek of the way he puked in his suit when he went through the wormhole and he tastes the dust on Titan when Thanos put Tony's own armor through his body.
They talk about Tony while Tony gets a month's worth of calories from a tube. They talk about every off-label solution on the market. Steve asks about surgical solutions, he asks about extant research. Steve fails to accept that his biology is unique, that the science has always been poorly understood, that a critical component to success is Tony's will to live.
Tony opens his mouth to say something about the tears leaking out of Steve's eyes and Steve gives a barely-perceptible shake of his head, holds one finger to his lips.
I don't feel good, Tony says, and then Steve is on his tongue, gripping Tony's head like he's going to crush his skull against the tile, but he just crams his entire length into Tony's mouth, against Tony's throat. Tony actually feels him pulling his jaw apart. He slaps one of his hands wetly against Steve's thigh.
Maybe you broke it, Tony tells him, and he hopes Steve can feel even a fraction of rejection Tony has been carrying around. Maybe you splintered it when you put your shield in my fucking chest.
“I think I can handle it,” Tony snaps. He’s leaning on his elbow now, curled over the counter. His breathing doesn’t sound ok. A bruise is blooming over his side.
They’re swarming the way crowds do when someone is lying on the ground having a heart attack. Tony used to say that everyone loves a spectacle. Steve doesn’t carry the kind of authority he used to; once, people would spring apart for him like he was Moses himself, but instinct sets his feet moving and he’s elbowing his way through before he can think better of it. His face is covered, he reminds himself. Don’t sweat it. People will stare, it’s fine. The crowd seems to go on forever. People are yelling. He has to get to whoever is injured, he has to –
No one is bleeding out on the pavement. It’s just people, gorgeous people in bizarre outfits waiting around in the chill of the fall air, flocking to the neon signage like moths. He can just pick up music from deep inside the building.
Sharon is late, so the technician wheedles on, wants to talk to him about the serum, and Tony drags himself through the familiar science of it. They move on to ballistics, and three slugs are deposited into Tony’s hand; the others, unrecovered. He rolls them around in his palm and uses Extremis to quiet his tremoring, traitorous hands. Imagines melting the bullets down, reloading them, inserting the rounds into a pistol. Imagines what that would feel like, in his chest. Would he die?
Tony doesn’t need to try too hard – he may be a shitshow right now but he’s always been a charmer. Seduction is part of the package. Tonight he finds he
“Proof of life,” Steve says. “As long as you lend your assistance to me with this project, I make sure they stay alive. Tony has some ideas about the portal. Of course, I trust you’ll keep this between us. SHIELD clearance, red tape, you know.”
Tony holds his hands up and slides himself onto a barstool. He fingers through Steve’s mail, sets his folder down, runs his fingers over the keys to Steve’s bike. He threads his fingers through his hair. “Ok,” he says in that voice that Steve has come to recognize as backpedaling from a transgression. “I came to apologize.”
It’s packed up tight, but he has a crowbar and anxiety trying to crawl out of his stomach, so he tears the crates up and lines up the canvases, the framed letters, takes each piece reverently out of its container and smooths his hands over it, presses his face into the folds, imagines he can still smell cosmoline and gunpowder on Steve’s 90-year-old clothing –
The curves of his muscles have been whittled away to almost nothing, and his body lays on the table, naked except for the sheet someone has thrown over his groin, his ribs poking up through his skin, his eyes hollow and dark.
Tony says “I’m fine,” and there was a time Steve would have been able to decide to believe with all his heart.
Steve doesn’t sleep. He doesn’t know if he’ll ever get to have this again. It feels like goodbye, which is ridiculous. The sun will rise again, tomorrow. They’ll be on the same team. This Extremis thing, it’s just another thing. Even if this raw thing between them doesn’t survive, their friendship always has.
“They won’t do this for you, though, will they,” Tony whispers, his lips grazing Steve’s ear, and Steve’s eyes roll back behind his closed eyes.
“There was this asshole,” Tony says. “And he thought he was better than everyone else. He didn’t pay attention to what he did, he didn’t care where he was going. He lived without intent.”
Michael tells Gary to scoot up, there you go – and Steve watches a roach scuttle across the ceiling. He ekes his hand under the waistband of his boxers. Harder, Gary says, and sometimes he sounds just a little bit like Tony, the edge of a growl in his voice like when he used to get angry. Their bed knocks against the wall they share with Steve, and Steve cups himself and imagines it’s him, imagines it’s Tony above him –
Tony lets him do it – fatigue, or weariness has overtaken him for now. He’s never worn it well. “Let go of me,” he says quietly. He doesn’t pull away. It’s halfhearted at best.
Tony slides off the counter, doesn’t let him leave, wraps his arms tentatively around Steve’s waist. “What is this for you?” Tony whispers. “Tell what’s going through your head.”
He cries for a while, until his breathing subsides into something steady, deeper and deeper. He’s almost on the edge of sleep when he startles awake again, feels around desperately until he finds Steve’s hand and grips it with all his strength.
“How much did Rhodey tell you before he took off,” Tony says. He tries to ease himself onto the closed toilet and Steve barely catches him before his legs give out. He is in
“There are other Avengers,” Tony says, and Steve doesn’t have the heart to tell him that there aren’t, that 5 people does not a team make, but Tony’s eyes slip shut as he rocks into Steve’s thrusts, finally still, finally some measure of peace written on his face, not rapturous, but
He is taken back to the Helicarrier on a Quinjet, fussed over in medical, given time to call his armor and pull himself the fuck together, and then he is escorted to his mandatory psych evaluation.
“You know, the only person who’s been consistently right about the outcome of this little thought experiment of yours is
“Why do we need this,” Tony says now, as he looks at the specs. “It’s in the Everglades, I hate Florida.”
Tony places himself in an imaginary future where Steve succeeds because Steve's force of will can conquer all. In this future, love saves the day. In this future, they love each other. In this future, they are more than two lonely liars clinging to each other.
His costume doesn’t rip, but it’s a near thing. Steve isn’t expecting the suddenness of it, the almost-violence, and sharp panic wells in him as the wall cracks a little where he braces himself with one hand. His briefs have bunched up under his balls and it’s too dark to see, but the air on his skin feels obscene.
Tony wonders who will be the first to give up. He wonders if they are the last, if the team is dead somewhere, if they're going to do this forever, just the two of them, until Steve goes insane or Tony withers and dies.
“I’m gonna tell you a story,” Tony gasps. Steve’s blood drips into his face. He knows Steve is dead but he’s so close, it’s been so long since he’s been allowed to
, Tony says, and it shouldn't feel so wretched, the bond is still closed, he knows it must be the Androderm and the Alpha sweat and the days of fever and hunger and despair. But Tony is small and he is human and Steve stands among gods and Tony loses to gods every time.
“Is this ok,” he asks again, makes his voice softer, devoid of pity, but gentle, patient, in the way he knows Tony needs.
A bus boy wearing nothing but tight red gym shorts walks in front of them holding a plastic bin full of wine glasses. The line of men sitting at the bar swivel their heads around.
, he thinks, and he can hear it clear as a bell in some stranger’s voice and his mouth smiles and then it’s gone again like a dream he can’t quite call back and –
Tony's kneeling-collapsed on the shower tile, in Steve's lap. Steve's cock, fully hard, bobs between them. One of them is naked. What's my temperature, Tony asks, but all he can focus on is Steve's neck, is the way Steve keeps touching him. Stop, Tony says, Stop.
“Sounds like you,” Steve says, back in his corner like nothing ever happened. “You’re all about executive decisions these days.”
If he tries, Steve can still smell the antiseptic of the room where he woke up after the ice, can smell the heady wash of Tony Stark’s cologne. The dumb way his mouth smirked up into a grin, the eyes. The eyes. Tony sharpened the world for him and washed the past into a dull blur, a faraway dream.
and then the man slides his mouth all the way down and Steve feels his nose nudging against his pubes.
Steve is losing his will. Tony imagines it must be exhausting, making love to a body that thinks it's already dead. Both of them nurse their hurts privately between rounds. Their collective failure to spontaneously snap back together as if no time had passed, no hurt had been exchanged is unbearable alone, doubly unbearable together.
It’s completely unnecessary, and it will make Tony’s day very, very, difficult, but he snaps a tiny silver padlock through the hardware. A whim. An indulgence. “There’s a key in your desk,” Steve informs him. He traces the line of Tony’s cock over all the layers with one finger, and then lets Tony acquaint himself with his new reality.
Tony, Steve tells him, like he is delivering news about a death, and the joke is on him. You're malnourished, he starts. You're. He falters. You're bondsick.
Steve carefully pulls his suit jacket off, toes off his leather shoes, and leaves them under the coffee table. Slides in next to Tony, worms his arm around him under the quilt. He rubs Tony’s shoulder and kisses the crown of his head.
“What do you want with me, Steve,” Tony presses. “You don’t have one night stands.” Steve wishes Tony would have always been this open and unfiltered and hates himself for it: it’s the coke, it’s the alcohol. Tony’s loose-lipped and rough and he swallows and his Adam’s apple bobs –
“Oh,” Tony says. There is something heartbreaking in his speechlessness. Tony’s always had his tongue about him. He nods to himself. He sniffs. He’s high.
He’d forgotten what it feels like to have metal in his chest. He’s seizing, maybe, what’s left of him, his body is jerking where he isn’t pinned between Steve and the ground by this fucking piece of metal through his heart.
He watches, for a while. Tony’s skin turns pale as death in the blue hours of the morning. It makes the shadow under his eyes stark, the rise and fall of his chest seem fragile. He watches as the golden hour dawns and Tony seems to soften in the beams that fall through his enormous picture windows.
“Do you have any idea how much shit I’m taking for you right now,” he says, curt, somewhere behind Steve. Clinking, glasses. Liquor sloshing into a glass. Tony steps into his field of vision without his jacket, rips his glasses off, tosses them carelessly on the coffee table. "You cost me money, you cost me time."
“Why is he suddenly ‘my’ son, when he doesn’t want to wake up early?” Tony wondered aloud to anyone in hearing distance.
He grabbed Tony’s body underneath the arms and pulled him up to the surface, gasping for breath.  He dragged him onto the pool deck and immediately started CPR.
The lyrics at the end of the chapter are from "Goin' Out of My Head", a song initially recorded by Little Anthony & the Imperials in 1964, written by Teddy Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein.
Alphas could feel their mates from miles away and vice versa.  Tony hadn’t even mated with Steve properly yet, but he did most definitely feel something.
“God, Doc!  What do you want me to say?  That I’m unhappy? No, I’m not. That there are problems between Cap and I?  At the moment, there aren’t, if you don’t count the mundane.  Come on, you know me somewhat… you know my M.O. with significant others…”
And, with that, Tony sunk back down under the water, but he didn’t come up seconds later like he did before.  Steve continued to watch to see what the Omega was doing, but after a minute, then two minutes, he began to worry.
As they exited the hospital, the two men found their way, this time only holding hands, over a beautiful black Jaguar XF sedan still idling under the porte cochere. They both jumped into the back seat without warning their beta driver of their entrance.
“Guess you can call me a ‘neat freak’ in that aspect, Tony,” He retorted. “The only times it smells like my Alpha are when I’m in rut and when I come back from my workouts...”
As soon as the elevator doors closed on Sam’s floor, Tony and Steve couldn’t exactly keep their hands and mouths off of one another.
The usually suave genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist had gone silent; he may have even slicked a little bit.
This caused the two friends to start giggling like schoolgirls. Happy abruptly stopped laughing as he got a big whiff of the pheromones permeating the space.  He instantly turned around, gun drawn and pointed towards Steve.
“Wow, I should not have called you that. What kind of asshole am I? I know what you are, you know what you are. I know what I am, and by now, you know what I am. But, I had no reason to say that to you. And, I should really shut up now.  Boy, look at the time! Damn, I have a thing to go to, so I gotta go…”
“Nat, why are you even agreeing with her?  You want Tony to wake up just as much as I do, if not more…”
“That’s fine.  I’ll just get out of your hair… maybe we can talk about all of this again, when you’re rested…” Steve countered.  “I’ll come back later, okay, Tony?”
As Steve took a bite of their creation, a soft growl came out of him.  The sound sent a shiver down Tony’s spine and a bit of slick wet his derriere.  Tony knew Steve could smell his spillage, but he continued to eat near him.  The faint scent of Omega slick wafted towards Steve’s nose, as he chewed on his latest bit of sandwich.  He swiftly finished the piece in his mouth, before sniffing the air again deeply.
“I know, Pop, but I just need to get out for a little bit and swing around.  It helps calm me down.”
He just smiled at him, and that was it: Tony Stark was intrigued by the American hero, Captain Steve Rogers.
Every time he asked himself a question about that day and the mitigating circumstances around it, he would get the same answer:
Seconds felt like hours between them, until the svelte Army captain moved over to the bar, looking at Tony’s vast collection of scotch, Irish whiskey and bourbon.
Soon after, he set it down on the island, “This would taste so much better with some Tito’s™ in it or maybe even some Jose with a shot of grenadine and a cherry…”
“Tony tried to drown himself…” the Captain responded, continuing to do CPR.  “I thought it would come back up from underneath the water, but he didn’t…”
“No idea, sir…” The A.I. responded truthfully.  “Are you feeling alright, sir?  I’m not detecting any illnesses…”
“Nope… not all… I’m good…” The billionaire replied quickly.  “Great, honestly… you should be a masseur…”
“Stupid? Wrong?” The billionaire interrupted his friend.  “I know, Bruce. You’re sorry, but what I don’t understand is the face that it happened.”
“You know what, Sam?” Tony responded immediately, trying to calm himself down.  “That’s a great idea. Sorry that you had to hear about my lesser status…”
“Young Sir, I don’t think I am able to do that. Your fathers have given me special instructions to wake you and your siblings promptly at 8:10am to allow you time to get yourselves ready to come to the kitchen.”
When they found themselves around one another several months later, things were still awkward for Tony.  At least there were people around to distract him from his thoughts and intentions.
“I just might be. And, by-the-by, I thought you said that you needed someone with my expertise to help you?”
The billionaire could see Steve’s very evident ‘approval’ of him naked plumping up in his gym sweats, causing him to slick again.  The chlorine in the pool, however, deadened the scent.
“Ugh, I hate you, J…” Tony growled as he sat up to a sitting position.  “And, yes, please pull them for me…”
The sweet smell of cinnamon & brown sugar with a touch of metal slowly began to permeate his apartment as soon as he got his floor.
“Doc, you can call me ‘Tony’; I’m not gonna tattle on you…” the philanthropist responded with a wink.  “And, I think the Captain has helped with my recovery in so many ways…”
“Whoa, Hap!  Whoa!  No need for the gun!” Tony shouted back, as the Captain covered the billionaire with his body.
Standing feet in front of them was the billionaire in question, dressed in a red & black 3D-gradient print tracksuit with a pair of black Nike™ Epic React 2 Flyknit running shoes.
The loud voice shocked the young man enough that he fell off the bed and onto the floor, covers and all, with a loud thud.
“‘Hose me down’? Omega, why would you want to do that?” the Captain responded, a bit taken aback by the question.
“Steve, you can’t control every situation. Just like I can’t control who writes some trash rag about me in the press. But, when I can control is what I do next.”
Annoyed by this new feeling in his arm and frustrated that he was awake at an ungodly hour, Tony threw his bed covers off of his body.  Lying there in just his Iron Man boxer-briefs, he sighed loudly in disgust.
Here is the 3rd chapter of my lovely story.  Please let me know what you think!  Happy reading & enjoy!
Finally, Steve found his way over to Tony, who looked uneasy (even as he sipped from his highball of single malt scotch).
“Hey, you…” The billionaire stated, before entering the room and sitting down on the bed next to the alpha.
It engulfed his hand, swiftly cascading up his arm and around to his scent gland.  The spot throbbed as a smell enveloped his breathing.  Cotton, soap, and cherries:  the combination was intoxicating.
He would work in his lab, while Steve did public appearances as Captain America; both had their own individual missions and those together for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Eyes flickering open, he turned slowly towards the source of the pleasurable perfume, seeing that he was napping on the bedroom’s dark brown, hand-tufted leather sofa.
“Steve…” Tony gasped as he tried to catch his breath.  “You have to… Uhhhh, you have to s-s-s-stop…”
Steve and Tony weren’t sure what to expect, when they arrived at the hospital that evening, but from the looks on their companions’ faces, things were not as they seemed.
“He’s not in a fucking coma, Pepper…” Natasha reminded the older woman.  “He’s in an unconscious state…”
“Smooth… very smooth…” was all the hero muttered, before turning back to the bottles and choosing one.
“He looks so peaceful…” Natasha said quietly, moving to take her friend’s hand in hers.  “I should’ve been there with them.  I could’ve done something.”
Somehow hearing the other man’s words, the philanthropist popped up out of the deep, “No, it’s not okay!  It’s not fucking okay, Steve!  I’m a grown ass man, and I’m getting discombobulated by an Alpha! For the first fucking time ever… in my motherfucking life!!  Do you know how angry that can make a person?!  No, of course, you wouldn’t know! You don’t know how it feels to be an Omega!”
“‘Plastered’? Who’s getting plastered?” Tony asked back, recapping the juice bottle and putting it back in the fridge.  “It would be one drink, Cap…”
Tony looked deeply into the blonde’s eyes; they were such a perfect shade of blue that intoxicated his senses.  It distracted him so much that he didn’t notice that Steve’s right hand was moving up his arm and was pulling him closer.
“Ha ha ha, Dad… You’re so funny.” Peter’s sarcastic response wasn’t lost on anyone.  “But, I can’t clean my bedroom now…”
“‘Someone threatening me’?!” Tony retorted with a chuckle.  “Happy?!  Really, Steve?! He would never threaten me! He’s just being protective!”
Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Pepper and Thor were sitting around with him chatting, when Steve arrived.  Wearing his trademark brown leather bomber jacket; a fitted long-sleeved navy & olive green-plaid sport shirt that was cut for his body; olive-colored trousers that shaped the roundness of his ass; and, toughened-up & laced-up brown boots (which he wore often while riding his motorcycle), he was pure Alpha and proud of it. He strode over to the group with a soft smile and a wave to all.
At noon, the good Dr. Banner and the sassy assassin escaped back down to their respective floors, leaving Steve and Tony alone yet again.  The two men moved swiftly around the kitchen, making lunch for one another.
“Not always… well, maybe… sometimes… sometimes… okay, this was the first time,” Tony tried to explain.  “Please don’t hold this against me…”
“Nat, are you teaching my J things?  Because he just said that same exact sentiment to me not 5 minutes ago…”
Sorry, this has taken me so much time to post.  This chapter was done, but RL made it hard to find time to do so.
“Same with you, Sam.” The billionaire responded, also shaking the man’s hand, as he too left the room.
The other three Stark-Rogers children had made their appearances, dressed and ready for their day and were busily eating at the dining table, when their older brother finally arrived.
“But, you have to be supervised by an adult at all times, and you have do all of your chores, along with your siblings, for a month.”
They hadn’t even noticed when the elevator had come to a stop and the doors came open on the ground floor, until they heard the abrupt sound of someone clearing their throat.
Nat and Sam trotted their way around the reservoir for the second time. Steve ran past them again making sure to wave at them and state lightly “On your left…” before jogging towards The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MoMa) for the umpteenth time.
The billionaire playboy looked at the war hero and took the drink in his hand without saying a word, letting the moment sink into his psyche.
Every time Pepper asked him to go down to the cafeteria to eat, he would say he’s not hungry or not ready to eat yet.
“Saved by the A.I.,” Tony muttered lightly, before responding, “Hold that thought, J. Steve, Alpha… do I need to hose you down, so we can leave the hospital?”
The billionaire sighed, as he took the steaming hot mug of coffee handed to him by Steve.  After he took a short sip, he sighed again.
Behind him sat Dr. Tiffany Ben-Hamin, longtime therapist to the stars and to one Anthony Edward Stark.  At 5’5” tall with olive skin, dark brown hair & eyes and a strong, sharp jaw line & chin, Doc (as Tony calls her) was seated behind her desk, listening to her patient’s words intently.
is a soul song written by Al Green.  It reached #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and # 7 on the Hot Soul Singles Chart. Billboard ranked it as the No. 12 song for 1971.
“Well, this isn’t the 1940s, soldier. And, we can’t just ‘use our words’ to defeat a problem anymore.”
“Hey, kid,” Bucky spoke up, placing a fresh glass from the cupboard in front of his nephew.  “Your dad just spoke to ya.  You gonna answer him?”
“You’re not eating pancakes made by your pop?”  Natasha questioned, as she walked over to her nephew and placing her hand on his forehead.  “Are you feeling alright?”
“Language, Harold! They are children in the car!” Tony responded brazenly, before getting a dirty look from Steve.
He knew the tone, the cadence, the matter-of-factness; he just couldn’t put a finger on which it belonged to exactly.  He needed to open his eyes to see the person’s face; to open his mouth to say something… anything; to release his body from its current confines to move and touch said person; to open his heart to –-
Tony sniffs in air loudly and replies (quoting ‘Top Gun’), “‘I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow, but it’s looking pretty good so far…’”
Steve wasn’t sure whether the Omega knew how to cook at all, so he had them opt for cold-cut sandwiches.
He tried to open his eyes to see where it was, but he was too tired to do so.  He fell back into a deep slumber, deaf to the world around him.
Layers of ham, turkey and chicken interlaced with Colby, Swiss and provolone cheese on nine-grain bread with fresh greens, mayo and cranberry mustard.
“I know, Brucey Bear! I heard you the first time!  But, how… how can I be mates with Steve?  I’m an Alpha!  I can’t be mated to another Alpha; I just can’t!”
After that, the two men walked into the living room, continuing to talk about everything.  Tony had sat on the couch, as Steve moved over to his stereo stand, where his record player was sitting.  He picks a record out of the bookcase nearby, places the vinyl circle on the turntable, and sets the needle down on it.  Softly, the dulcet tones of piano, drums, bass, trumpet, trombone, saxophone and clarinet filled the room.  A jazzy melody danced out of all of the instruments in a beautiful moment of musical excellence.
“Come on, Tony!”  Steve shouted, doing chest compressions, being safe not to mess with the arc reactor.  “Come on!”
’.  JARVIS had made him a list of books that came out after he crashed the plane and was frozen in the ice.  All of them classics that he never got to experience before now…
“Hey!  We needed to have conclusive proof…” the assassin replied as she poured her own cup of Joe.  “…for several hours…”
“Yep, I think he hates to give up a good thing…”  The Black Widow responded.  “Kinda reminds me of Tony…”
“Well, I was going to make carbonara for dinner, but I might need someone with your expertise to help me…”
This chapter has no song lyrics, because I couldn't find the perfect song for it.  And, this chapter is basically a filler to move things along.
“How dare you ruin my trust?!  Goddamnit, Bruce!  I should’ve been the one to tell everyone what I was!”
Tony blushed, as Steve turned back to making other things while the pasta cooked. The two continued to talk as the Army officer pulled tomatoes and a ball of fresh mozzarella out of his fridge.  He made his way over the window sill and pulled fresh basil leaves from the spice garden box Natasha got him a year & a half ago as a housewarming present. He cut the tomatoes and mozzarella into slices, alternating them on two plates. He made sure to put freshly-washed basil leaves between each layer, before drizzling extra-virgin olive oil over all of it.  He left the seasoning to personal taste.
“Nope.” Peter replied emphasizing the ending sound as he filled the tumbler with the citrusy liquid.
“Ugh, I don’t wanna!” He whined loudly.  “I was perfectly fine & dandy sleeping in my comfy, warm, snugly soft, king-sized bed!  J, why are you being so evil?”
“He’ll consider the polite gesture, Tony. He’s old school. I’m surprised he didn’t get you a drink first or hasn’t come in here to wonder where you went…”
“Really, Tony?  Now, I need to know what brought on this whole state of affairs.  Spill it, or I’ll use my alpha voice again…”
As soon as Steve stopped, Tony sprayed himself down with the nozzle, diluting any Omega slick residue, but it didn’t dilute the scent.  That Tony got rid of with a splash of whiskey on his skin.
“Which, in your case, will lead to another drink, then another one, and then you’ve had five in rapid succession…”
“And, I want that too, Tony. I guess I’m letting all of the past crap go to my head. I shouldn’t be. I should be in the moment with you and your amazing omega scent.” Steve replied, scenting the bonding gland on the philanthropist’s neck.
“Whoever went after them is dead,” Natasha stated honestly.  “Mark my words:  my hands will be involved in taking care of the asshole that did this.”
He knew the only person that could be observing him was Steve.  (Jarvis would have let him know that the Captain had left the floor).
“No, Cap, I’m gonna do this!  Bruce, when-the-hell are you gonna pull your Omega dick from between your legs and mate with Nat?  She ‘is’ the Alpha you’ve been pining for… for what:  3-4 years now?”
He couldn’t think of those things; he had to think of the here-and-now, and he had to keep hope alive that Tony would wake up soon.
“You make me tired, Rogers…” Tony stated, yawning loudly.  “Honestly, I’m at the point where I just want to take a nap...”
Tony kissed the tip of Steve’s nose softly and sweetly, before resting his forehead on the other man’s. He could smell the Army officer’s scent returning slowly to its original heavenly aroma.  “You gonna be okay now? Are we gonna be okay now?”
As Steve left the room, Tony quickly followed after, seeing the older, younger man find his way into the kitchen busying himself with making something to eat.
“Good idea…” the blonde rumbled against his love’s breeding spot.  “Lead the way, but not too fast…”
“Will do, sir, and sir, you know you don’t hate me… you like Captain Rogers more to try something he enjoys…”
“What do you mean, ‘can’t stay longer’?  You just got here...” Tony responded back.  “You haven’t even had time to make any excuses to leave. If anything, that’s my M.O., so what gives? Something someone else did?  Something I did?  Because honestly, I wouldn’t doubt my idiocy in these moments…”
“I decided to come see what all the hype was about with running the Park, like any other warm-blooded, normal human being would…”
“What-the hell just happened?!” He emitted aloud after a prolonged wait.  “I never have people leave my events early!  His ‘I-Have-To-Be-Up-Early-Tomorrow’ excuse better be pretty damned important!”
“First, we teach Happy how to act around you.  Next, when we get back to the tower, we are going to decompress.”
{Chapter Two's title is "You Go To My Head" sung twice by Frank Sinatra (in 1947 & 1960). I heard it and it was perfect.  I posted some of the lyrics at the end of the chapter.  To hear the song in full, go to:
As Steve continued to draw in his sketchbook, the scent became more intense upon the front door opening and the other man entered the space.
Steve put his phone on speaker, so that the billionaire could hear the conversation as well.  (Apparently, it was an important call).
“Its okay, Harold,” Steve answered back.  “I’m protective of Tony as well.  Just don’t let that happen again.”
He winked at her, and with a smile, he left the office, but not before snagging a sucker out of the candy dish on the doctor’s desk.
Tony found his way to his master bedroom and made his way over to his king-size bed. Slipping his hoodie, sneakers and socks off, he crawled back under the covers, snuggling deeply into the 1000-count Pima cotton sheets.  He rolled onto his side, back facing the door, and front facing the big windows that were currently covered by huge blackout curtains.
Not only had he chosen the man’s favorite without knowing it, he had shown the billionaire that he had also chosen him for his Omega.  As soon as he had done this, the American hero slowly walked over to him, standing oh so close enough to scent him, but not enough to mark him.
The First Avenger strode over to him and shook his hand firmly, allowing Tony to feel how strong his grip was.  Their eyes were locked on one another.
“Stark, what-the-hell are you doing here? It isn’t zero-scotch-thirty yet…” Sam quipped with a smirk.
“Hey, guys…” Sam finally spoke up.  (Everyone had forgotten he was there).  “I’m gonna head out.  I don’t think I need to be here for this…”
As they continued to eat breakfast and chat, the Avengers team wasn’t expecting the tornado of terror to come.
“Мы встретимся снова, капитан,” the mysterious figure stated matter-of-factly.  “Я без колебаний завершу свою миссию по уничтожению тебя.”
“Hell, if I know.  I’m the messed-up one here; you’re the therapist. Shouldn’t you know and tell me how to fix it?”
Steve grinned at the omega adoringly, making the officer’s warmth radiate up from Tony’s hand, through his arm and outward towards his whole body.
The Captain shook his head, clearing his brain, before rubbing his hands over his eyes.  He took a deep breath, not longer smelling his omega.  He looked down at his wet body, confused by what had happened.
“I think the idea of you swinging around at all is dangerous,” Steve spoke.  “But, if you are under adult supervision, and said adult limits your swing time to only one hour…”
The three adults continued to bicker with one another over everything; it would get someone upset, namely Steve, who was dealing with a lot of emotions at that moment (mostly due to lack of sleep).
After four minutes, Steve started to feel stabbing pains in his chest and neck; he instantly knew what that meant:
Even though all four of the kids had half of Steve’s serum-enhanced DNA, the doctors Strange & Banner were more worried about the half of their DNA that came from Tony and Tony himself.
“What?” The other two adults questioned back sharply, still frustrated by their current conversation.
She pushed the ‘analyze’ button, and let the machine do its work, as it repeatedly stated, “Stand clear -- analyzing… Stand clear -- analyzing…”
And, we all pretty much know who is saying that, don't we? He had to come into the story sometime, or it wouldn't be MCU-related. This is how I am introducing him.
He turned his head towards Tony and moved his free hand to the billionaire’s cheek stroking it tenderly, before capturing his lips in light pecks. Soft moans emanated from their bodies as their interaction deepened.  Steve drew the brunette’s top lip into his mouth, before entering his mouth, tasting him and savoring him with his tongue.  Tony let go of the arm he was holding, allowing Steve to move it around to pull him even closer.
“Uhhhh… Can’t wait to get you into my bed…” The billionaire groaned eager to get all of the Alpha’s clothes off, with or without his help.  “Just wish this car ride was faster…”
The voice that spoke came from a little girl, eating pieces of a syrupy buttermilk pancake.  With light brown curls, big blue eyes and a bright smile, she was a perfect amalgamation of both Tony & Steve.
I may bring a little bit of smut or sensuality to the next chapter.  It would be Steve & Tony's 'first time' so-to speak.
“I have even been skipping lab time, just to get ahead of homework,” Peter continued on.  “So, I think I’ve earned my time to be a teenager, sleep in a little bit and to be Spiderman, when I want.”
Tony replayed the events over and over, wondering if he’d done the right thing by letting Steve leave.
“Then, explain, pal…” Bucky chimed in.  “Some of us need a little reminder of what’s up with you teenagers nowadays.”
“I think you’re seeing things, Natasha…” Pepper retorted, shaking her head in disbelief. “It hasn’t moved at all.”
That’s when the billionaire did a spit-take, spraying jet black Ethiopian coffee across the island, almost hitting Steve.
“Huh? Yeah. Oh, I’m sorry…” Steve responded moving swiftly out of the cab.  “Zoned out for a second…”
“Thank you, sir. Now, Mr. Hogan has been waiting for you both downstairs, and you know how he gets when he’s been waiting for a while.”
“That bedroom of his though… yikes!” Tony muttered under his breath toward his husband, who merely shook his head and rolled his eyes in annoyance.  He mouthed ‘
“Oh, come on, Tony…”  Natasha piped up, frustrated by her friend’s actions.  “Don’t be a stalker. Did J wake you up to let us know we were here?”
Peggy pours them each a splash of the whiskey and raises her glass. “To Bucky Barnes,” she says, “Commando, hero… best friend.”
“Peg had a woman’s name on her hip, said she got it when she joined the army. She told me about it after—well, she was making a point. A couple of them, actually.” Steve grins sheepishly to himself, and Tony swallows thickly. “That—uh, Angela—must have been her. Right?” he asks, eyes wide and hopeful. Tony just nods, but it sparks a brilliant smile across Steve’s face. “I told her I’d take them dancing once they found each other,” he says wistfully. “I’m glad they did.”
“I never was much good at dancing, but when you find her, I’ll take you both. Show you around the city.” Peggy smiles at the offer. Steve bites the inside of his cheek and thinks of the last time he was supposed to take a girl dancing, at Bucky’s behest. “He should’ve gotten that,” he says, voice raw. “He had a mark. He was supposed to find them and—and take them dancing.”
“They got married twice,” he recalls. “Once in the UK, once here. Best weddings I’ve ever been to. Them and the Jarvises were the only reason I ever wanted to find my—” he cuts himself off because
Ironman cannot save everyone. That was glaringly clear from before the suit even had a name. He tries, he does, for probably longer than advisable, but. He’s not enough. No collection of armor, no amount of tech, none of it is enough.
“For me to run your company better than you,” she replies, and then points a perfectly-manicured finger at him. “You’re still a majority shareholder and that means You. Attend. Board meetings.”
He’s got a soulmark on his hand, a scrawl of black on the inside of his ring-finger. It’s a name, almost, and one he—
It feels like half the army thinks Peg’s his soulmate, which—well, he can’t help but feel a little flattered. She’s one hell of a woman, and whoever’s worthy of her must be pretty special, too.
His right-hand, though. There’s something about that hand that’s got him more balled-up than anything else about his new body, and it’s barely two inches long. He uncurls his fingers slowly, holding his breath—which he can do for
about him, even when he’s just sitting around the mansion in everyday clothing, reading whatever he can get his hands on. Not when he’s sketching the skyline or being nice to teenagers or deliberately misusing memes to get a rise out of Barton. Somehow, Steve Rogers is all the good of Captain America and none of the propaganda.
The curtain around his cot shifts, and a man in a white coat steps through. Steve shoves his hands under his legs as the man—the doctor, though not one whose name he can remember—informs Steve that he’s here to do a check-up, to see if there are any side-effects of the procedure.
Steve Rogers comes into the world as unblemished as his mother—on the outside. On the inside, he is a mess of too-small lungs, a weak heart, and a plethora of other maladies no one’s figured out yet.
“Anthony Edward… A.E.” Steve turns to him, face a baffling dawn of comprehension. “You’re A.E. Stark.”
Tony nearly holds a placating hand up, then remembers the repulsors and thinks better of it. “Captain?” he asks, breath baited. “Captain Rogers?”
There’s just something about Rogers that draws Tony to him. And everyone else on the planet, obviously, but Tony thinks he wins points for worst idea. Figures he’d fall face-first into annoying the Star-Spangled Man as part of some faux-apathetic game of
They settle into teamwork, all conscious of the weirdness around the edges. Tony keeps an eye out for new heroes, gives some hands-off support to some small-time little guys saving one neighborhood at a time, and races Jan and Thor through the skies over Manhattan.
“Please,” he says, then takes Steve’s face in his hands and kisses him himself. Steve’s hands are warm when he wraps them around Tony’s waist, the inside of his mouth hot and liquid, molten and lovely. Tony slides an arm around Steve’s shoulders, fists a hand in his hair, loses himself in the rhythm of give and take. Steve kisses like he wants Tony immediately and forever, a heady intensity that makes Tony imagine staying here all day.
So Steve had trekked back and forth to the bookstore every week or so, had worked his way through the rest of Holmes, some battered Agatha Christies, and even one coverless Shakespeare that Mr. Kohn had managed to talk him into instead of swath of Hardy Boys. He’s not sure he
There is bright, bright light around him, a bunch of voices going quiet, and Steve feels cold and warm and exhausted.
kind of ‘oh shit’.” He should really, really shut up, or at least say something intelligent. “I mean, whew, congratulations Steve, you’ve rendered me speechless, do you even know what kind of accomplishment that is? Uh, well, you probably know very, very well—”
Steve blinks. His vison is turning fuzzy on the edges, and sigh that he’s about to lose consciousness. But he has to know, he has to
“You still have to show me around New York,” she says, and even through the static of the radio he can hear her voice choking, “take us dancing.”
Or maybe the statue became the woman? Steve’s not quite sure—when he asks Mr. Kohn he just laughs and says
Tony gasps awake, eyes wide and blinking, feeling tethered and sluggish and like his throat is sandpaper on a steel file. There’s a tube in his nose and he spares a moment to think that it’s probably the worst feeling he’s ever experienced—
They make themselves a lot more oomph, but it’s still only one of them that makes it out. Seeing Rhodey’s relieved face, feeling an ache in his chest that has nothing to do with shrapnel, that almost makes it worth it.
“Uh,” Tony says, because the truth is he’d gotten distracted trying to teach the ‘bots to play catch. “Avengers stuff?” One look at Pep’s unimpressed face has him changing tactics. “Didn’t I make you CEO? What’s the point if I still have to go to boring meetings?”
—“no way is that a bad thing, well, ok, I guess maybe for everyone else on the planet? And homophobes or whatever, and uh, the president maybe, but whatever, who cares about them? Anyway, that’s solidly a
Steve is smiling softly at him, stupid hands and rambling sentences and all. Tony swallows thickly. “Uh,” he says, mind gone blank.
He’s unnoticed when he first leaves the elevator—Pep’s back is turned, immersed as she is in conversation with Cap. Tony eyes the kitchen and the stretch of exposed living room he has to cross before he’s out of sight. Open floorplans are terrible for avoiding people.
. If he’d been born without illness, if he hadn’t had to scrape his way through the ‘30s, if he’d been one of those fellas Dr. Erskine hadn’t wanted to give the serum to, he might’ve grown into something like this.
“Sure am,” Tony replies, bemused. “Bunch of family names shoved together. All terrible, if you ask me, I’m sure as hell not going around being called
It isn’t even easy for Tony, when Steve says he wants to know what happened to all the Commandos—to Peggy.
books that Steve’s never read before; she’s struck a deal with the bookseller, she says, and he can read these while he’s sick so long as he gives them back when he’s done.
You’re not meant to talk about soulmarks—that he and Bucky had shared was a testament to their bond and the fact that he’d just pulled his best friend back from the dead—but Steve is desperate to know just that little bit more about
There’s a wounded sort of look on Steve’s face that makes Tony’s stomach twist, and he launches into a babble just to fill the silence. “I remember this one time where I, uh, was trying to deal with a, a
AI—would’ve have warned him not to set foot on the common floor of the Avenger’s suite when his CEO was lying in wait to eviscerate him.
“Fucking hope not,” Tony mutters, and goes back to staring at the piles of Stark Industries crap lying around the cave. If he’s going to get the two of them out of here, he’s going to need something with more oomph than a car battery.
,” Tony says, mostly to himself. One moment the Captain is lying still—the next, he’s bolted into sitting up, eyes darting wildly around the room.
“Because it reads like Whitman,” Yinsen interrupts, voice as level as it always is. He lets a tiny little smirk slip onto his face. “Though my ear for American poetry is a little lacking.”
His soulmate isn’t Peggy, but he wouldn’t be upset if it were someone like her. Someone with her unflinching bravery, with her nerves and spine of solid steel. Every time the world tells her
He makes it halfway to safety before Steve catches his eye and Tony freezes in place. Steve quirks an eyebrow and Tony lifts a finger to his lips, resuming his quiet creep away from Pepper. With any luck, Steve’ll keep Pep distracted until Tony’s home free. He’ll throw Cap a party later.
“Um,” Steve looks down at him, biting at his lower lip. Tony wants to bite it for him and kiss away the sting. “Do you—”
When Anthony Stark is born, his soulmark is an obvious pattern of ink across his tiny chest. His mother cries to read it, squints through tears and joy and pain at the proof her baby boy was born for love.
Liking Captain America, the impossibly living legend, would just be admitting that his father was right. That the man, the myth, the “good person” yardstick, was actually as good as Tony couldn’t be.
He smiles faintly. She’s worried for him, obviously, or she wouldn’t have been so gentle. He appreciates it, even if he had wanted to be alone.
uncommon is that Steve—born early, too small, and coughing before he even screams—is alive to see the sun rise on his thirteenth birthday.
“At least we can finally give him a proper burial,” Tony murmurs inside the suit while Jan gasps over the comms. Natasha crouches down and starts tapping at her gauntlets, Clint is explaining to Thor that the man in the ice
Tony’s chapter is longer because he has to share (and that’s how I justified writing so much of him being a thirsty ass bitch)
What an employee-of-the-year job he did, that the middle of bum-fuck Afghanistan wanted his Wells Fargo Wagon come to visit so badly. Small wonder he found himself the Merchant of Death when death was flying off the shelves.
on the bottom. What do you think?” he asks, turning to Steve. Who is looking dumbly at him and not responding. Tony frowns. “Hello? Earth to Cap?”
He immediately course-corrects to make it look like he was walking over to them the whole time, ambling casually over to their position by the couches. He’s been more convincing.
He’s soldering a new electromagnet together when Yinsen says, carefully as casual as if he were commenting on the terrible weather, “Your mark is very beautiful.”
He takes a long, hissing breath. “Buck had a soulmark, you know? And I didn’t, and he used to say it didn’t matter if I got one or not, said he’d be there ‘til—” his voice chokes. He swallows around the lump in his throat and looks away from Peggy’s sympathetic eyes. “I used to be so afraid I’d never get one and Bucky’d find his and that he’d—leave. And now he’s dead, and I’m the one with the mark, with a
His usual reaction to when someone is doing things to him is to pay them to like him or poke them with a stick. This time he does a little of both.
He feels gutted when he finishes, exposed. Like he’s just handed over the secret to Tony Stark, the fully labelled dissection of every hope and regret he’s ever had—like Steve could look through him, now, and see every wound he’s ever hidden, open, bleeding chest and all.
Steve finds him in the library, a real-life pulp-and-paper book in his hands. It’s not something Tony does very often, but he’s feeling suitably maudlin tonight and this book is one he can’t put on an e-reader.
And then he tries to turn over and there’s a car battery tied to his chest and an electromagnet inside his body and panic, panic, this is what panicking feels like, oh god oh god
, but there’s something about him that Steve finds fascinating. He’s not stuck on Mr. Stark or anything—there’s an awful lot of flash and bang in the man, and Steve’s not quite sure what it’s hiding—but there’s an undeniable spark to the man, an intense quality of brilliance that leaves him quietly captivated whenever they’re in the same room.
“Happy birthday, Steven.” The gift is in last week’s newspaper, and Steve takes it with reverent hands.
It’s not uncommon, being born without a soulmark. Most people only get theirs after making some decision or another, a sign that whatever choice you just made had cemented the path that would lead you to your other half. Steve thinks it must be nice, being born with a mark, knowing that you were always perfect for somebody; but he’s not surprised to be born blank.
“Are you sassing me? See if I build you anything nice now,” Tony scoffed, and then quietly played acronym games until he could call the return device YO-YO.
The reactor had ended up just above his mark, one of the scars from the shrapnel trailing down into the top of the neat writing. He would think—if he didn’t know better, he would think the mark came second.
What must it be like, Tony wonders—though not for the first time—to wake up and realize all your friend’s happy moments have already happened, and you were there for none of them? To not have been there when Rhodey found Carol, when Pepper first met her niece, when Jan learned to fly. To have missed all the things you thought the future would bring.
It’s Stark who responds first. “Give us coordinates, Rogers, we’ll find you someplace safe to land—”
Stark whirls around, spots Steve, and shakes his head comically. “Come on Rogers, call me Howard,” he corrects, turning back to what ever he was working on. Steve knows from experience that the man can carry a conversation while inventing an entirely new technology, so he just steps forwards and keeps talking.
Steve looks down at his hands braced together in his lap. Tony thinks unbidden back on a history of people trying to perfect the human form, and how no one had made hands so well as Sarah Rogers.
The nicknames are probably the most schoolgirl-crush of him, but Tony’s always been a nickname. It’d be more unusual if Rogers didn’t get any. There’s

They are not the same, not really. Captain America is a hero built from decades of stories and tales and propaganda, a legendary figure for 20
Really, it’s nothing unusual that he tests out different body armor or builds a one-of-a-kind motorcycle. He even takes a look at the shield, where he has to grudgingly admit to himself that the old man did a pretty solid job on that one—though Tony’s got mock-ups for a return device for the rare cases where Cap misses the rebound.
By the time he is five, Tony can read it for himself. He sounds out the words to the mirrors turning them right way, though some of them are things he doesn’t understand. He writes it down, a childish scrawl that does not capture the turns of the ‘w’s or the slide of the ‘e’s, but requires less contorting to read.
Watching him at the Expo with the not-quite-flying car hadn’t been enough to distract him from trying to enlist. Up close, with the war on the line and the promise of success Project Rebirth had given them all, it’s like watching the future come to life.
it meant. He could lead a lecture on readings of the text it came from, literary criticism and wild theses that make this assertion or that claim. Tony could rant about Whitman’s varying influences, the period of his life when it was written, the historical context and metatextual references and all sorts of ridiculous conjecture.
But even with all his daydreaming over what his soulmate might be like there’s no ignoring the obvious.
Steve abruptly shoves his hand in Tony’s face, palm out. He blinks, jerking his head back, then stares at the scribble of black on Cap’s finger. There, in very familiar handwriting, is a signature Tony’s never actually used.
“You should know that just because you saved my life doesn’t mean I’m not fully equipped to ignore you,” Tony deflects. He makes a face. “I’m
Tony had blinked at him. “How do you even know what a yo-yo is? Weren’t those invented in the sixties?”
