“Clearly Home Ec isn’t doing you any favors,” Another kid, Bruce Banner, spoke up. He sat to the left of Natasha, keeping his voice low enough, only for the other two to hear.
“…Good point,” Bruce replied, he saw the pained, hungover state of Tony, “You shouldn’t have drank so much.”
Unfortunately, Tony was wrong.
“So, all of you–” Coulson briefly stopped, glancing at Tony for a moment, before continuing, “
Tony’s back harshly collided with a door frame. He got so carried away in his conversation– squabble with Steve that he didn’t bother to look to the back of him. He grimaced, rubbing his back as a poor attempt to soothe the pain. He gritted his teeth, watching Steve bypass him through the hallway’s doors without even asking if he was okay.
Darcy cleared her throat, rather loudly, to put a stop to all of the side conversations everyone else was having around the bonfire.
------
Tony rubbed his forehead.
“No, genius, we take a small drink of this–” Clint said, wiggling a large bottle of Smirnoff Vodka by the top, “Preferably the amount of a normal shot, maybe more, that is, if you want.”
After about fifteen minutes, Darcy stepped down a ladder she was on before heading over to where Tony and Steve were.
“What is it now?”
“Well, shit,” Tony sniffed himself, “You have super soldier senses or something, Captain America? I didn’t know you could smell me from all the way here.”
“I never said that you said that.”
With that, Tony decided to call it a day.
Natasha snickered at the snide attitude that matched Tony’s annoyed expression.
“Clint, is that really the worst you can come up with?” Pepper rolled her eyes.
Tony hoped he didn’t make a huge mistake. This kid could talk his–
“Sure,” She replied, sarcasm practically dripping off of her voice.
He did a once-over of the rest of the people who sat amongst the bonfire – Darcy’s best friend Jane Foster, foreign exchange student Thor Odinson, and a Sophomore girl who went by the name Wanda Maxi-something.
“What do you think he’s been doing for the past week and a half?” Sam spoke up.
Steve, the blonde Tony had made a not-so-appropriate statement about a minute ago, had his full attention on him. A frown was etched onto his features. As predicted, he wasn’t amused. Tony could have sworn Steve’s frown would become permanent if he held onto it any longer.
“Sure.”
“This is what you’ll be wearing.”
And he wasn’t disappointed at all. The more people, the merrier. If anything, it meant that the normally unoccupied rooms – there were many of those – would be put to good use for the night.
“Is he really going through the whole neighborhood?” Jane asked, from the front passenger seat. She was a little more composed than the others. While she and Thor sat in the front seats, the others were seated in the trunk of the vehicle, all huddled up together.
“You sure?” Tony asked, “I mean, you don’t have to. I can just order a cleaning service. My parents won’t be home until 7:00.”
“Hell yes,” She replied, plopping down across from him, “Never in my life did I think I’d ever see you wear a construction uniform.”
“Take a seat,” Coulson said. Before Tony could proceed to do that, he stopped him, “Wait, I’ll need your phone.”
------
,” Jane plainly said, her mouth open in shock.
A chorus of laughter filled the area.
------
He really did.
That was when he froze for a second.
I mentioned, you will be expelled,” Fury said, “Any questions?”
Bucky Barnes did a quick glance of the field with his eyes, double checking to see if Tony and his friends had left to the locker rooms inside the school building to change into their P.E uniforms.
After a good 15 minutes, he flipped over, lying on his back before pulling his phone out of his pocket. It was the first time he’d check it since Coulson confiscated it.  He got a text from Natasha, one from his mother, and a few from his group chat with Bruce, Clint, and Nat. Those were only among the many though. He decided to check Natasha’s first.
adamant on that opinion of his.
“I’m good at building things,” The other shrugged, “Now, can you tell me what I’m here for?”
He had applied to vast array of colleges since summer began, including his dream school, UC Berkley. Next was the vigorous work of applying to as much scholarships as he could possibly apply to. They weren’t all going to give him acceptance letters, if any, and financial aid alone could only help so much. Tacking on as many extra-curricular activities he enjoyed, keeping a good GPA, and volunteer work was the next step among many on his application journey.
Oh no. Oh no, no, no. He had to have heard Fury wrong.
They could only look on in astonishment as they watched Tony pull the undershirt off, tossing it to the ground beside the floral outfit.
“Change that to the whole city,” Tony replied, seeing Rhodey’s incredulous expression, “Word gets out fast when Howard Stark’s son is throwing a weekend party.”
At that text, Tony hesitated, his fingers hovering over the touchscreen keyboard. Tony never saw it that way, he never considered himself “noble”. Or was the guilt he was carrying actually make that true?
“I’ve seen the way you act around MJ. You become more jittery than usual and you’re always bringing her up whenever we talk about things that have nothing to do with her.”
“You look like shit,” Clint said, as soon as Tony took the seat behind him.
“Ouch,” Natasha said.
“It looks like it’s about to swallow you whole,” She giggled, exaggerating the appearance of the over-sized outfit on Tony’s fame, “So, what brings you here?”
.” One of the front office administrators said through the speaker, repeating her words for clarity.
“You’re really going to do that? That’s not embarrassing for you or anything?” Wanda spoke up.
While Tony was reaching in to grab a cookie that wasn’t burned beyond repair, Natasha was rummaging through her backpack. Clint would cautiously peek out through the bleachers, making sure there weren’t any teachers in the near vicinity of the field.
That was what they proceeded to do.
“Come in,” He could hear Shield’s principal, Nick Fury, from the other side of the door.
“What page are we on?” Tony asked, poking Clint on the back.
“For the love of god Peter, call me Tony.”
“Okay, I’ll see you guys later,” The guidance counselor awkwardly said, after he didn’t see a change in their body language, “Make sure Tony gets a uniform!”
The loud sound of a car honk interrupted Steve mid-sentence. He unknowingly came to a stop and glanced up, seeing a 2006 red mustang convertible make a stop parallel to the curb, yards away from him. He saw a redhead at the wheel, her wavy hair reaching her shoulders. He quickly realized that was Natasha Romanov, a feisty and intimidating senior who he shared a couple of classes with, including gym. Next to her in the passenger’s seat was Clint Barton. He was your typical class clown with a crude sense of humor. He furrowed his brow, seeing the two loudly talk to each other, probably in the middle of an argument. Tony Stark’s presence, even when he was not physically there, still haunted him, in the form of his…lackeys? Just his night.
“I’m with Foster,” Natasha added.
“Wow, the Screw Guns really do a number on my fingers,” She said, clenching and unclenching her hand. She grimaced, the soreness of her fingers not going away.
“Yeah, yeah, I figured,” He replied, before facing the other, a sloppy grin emerging on his features, “Thor, that’s a unique name. I’m surprised I haven’t seen you that often at school. Do I have your number? I think I should get your number.”
His four hour shift at the dealership miraculously became eight after his coworker fell ill. Why was his work was so short-staffed in the first place? He had schoolwork to get to, mountains and mountains of it. He opened the door to his apartment before flipping on the light switch. Another day, another empty house. His mother was working at the hospital for the rest of the night so he’d have the apartment to himself.
“We were about to play ‘Never Have I Ever’,” Darcy Lewis spoke up, her jolly voice a contrast from Natasha’s more serious tone. The brunette patted the empty lawn chair next to her, “Sit down and join us.”
Once Tony was in his very short boxers, he hugged his chest with his arms. His form immediately shivering.
Peter said, genuinely taken aback by Tony’s sudden change of subject. He knew just who it was Tony was talking about, but he was too bashful to dive into the subject. Tony obviously couldn’t see it, but he could sense Peter’s cheeks heating up. The easily flustered nature of his was easy to predict miles away.
“The rest of the year?? But–”
Tony’s face lit up when he saw Darcy among the 26 students that were currently in the room. She gave him a tiny wave, her usual optimistic grin plastered on her face. He proceeded to take the empty seat closest to her, which was only two seats away.
“How long have you guys known each other?”
“I’m touched, Stark,” The exchange student said.
Tony had a knowing smile.
It was a long day and Steve felt like passing the fuck out.
“Found it,” Natasha said, pulling out a bag of pre-rolls that were mixed in with a couple of golf ball sized cannabis clumps. They were a darker green hue than the cheaper alternatives. Beside Natasha, Tony spat out a large glob of mint chip cookie in disgust.
“Yeah, even managed to roll a few for me,” Natasha winked. She handed one of the joints to Tony before doing the same to Clint.
“Don’t talk me out of this,” Tony said, pointing at her.
“Seriously, Tony. This might not be as bad as you make it out to be. If you pay more attention to the upsides of getting to work on this project, then you might find yourself enjoying it.”
“Of course not! It’s just a little excessive. I have important things to do outside of school, y’know?”
“That’s a pretty judgmental thing to say. We don’t even– fuck!”
Tony arrived to his first period class, two minutes before the bell would ring. He promised himself he would go to the front office and explain his Saturday detention absence first thing, but he arrived later than anticipated. He scanned the classroom for empty desk and got himself seated in the first one he could find.
Tony did an obnoxious wolf whistle, the weed in his system knocking out all inhibition. That immediately caught their attention.
“God, I haven’t played that in ages,” Tony replied, proceeding to take a seat, “Are we stripping in this version cause it’s fucking cold out here.”
“We’re–”
“Chapter 12 and 13. And we didn’t have any new homework, all we had to do was finish the study guide,” She interrupted him, her annoyed expression not going away, “I swear, this is the last time.”
Steve let out a stifled sigh, his irritation exponentially growing. Tony’s mocking voice didn’t help.
Some of the others weren’t in such great shape either. Even the less outgoing Wanda had her fair share of alcohol. Natasha leant towards Clint, her hand lightly gripping his shoulder. They watched as Tony attempted to balance on a thin ledge, his arms outstretched. The dark-haired boy slightly tipped over before completely losing his balance. Before he could completely fall over to the ground, he felt two arms grab him on either side.
Once he regained his composure, he turned around, ready to head to the room he was told to go to. Instead, his phone vibrated. He fished it out of his pocket, almost staring fondly at the screen as he received a new text from Peter Parker.
“We’ve been too easy on you, Tony,” His mother, Maria, spoke for the first time since he arrived. She was completely upset, it was as if she was almost on the verge of crying with a tinge of anger mixed in. Tony had never seen her so disappointed before and he didn’t like it one bit. “And we can’t keep going on like this, not anymore. We need to do better.”
“Maybe you shouldn’t skip so much,” She said, her stare now away from Tony.
Tony sat down on the empty seat, next to his parents.
Peter Parker immediately took a liking to Tony, the moment they met one day in detention. Well, Peter was volunteering to clean up the storage room next door and organize a few things in the room Tony was staying in at the time. He was a nerdy, at times coy, freshman who shared Tony’s interest in engineering and physics. Tony remembered fondly rolling his eyes when Peter once had said, “you’re like an older and much cooler version of me”. He had a protective streak towards the kid even if he did annoy him at times.
“Hi, Tony. You’re wanted in the Principals office,” She said, her words terse but friendly enough. She was used to seeing Tony’s presence here, but she was never visibly annoyed or tired of him, like many of the faculty here.
“Lighten up a bit, would you?” Tony defensively said, he changed his tune once he saw Steve’s lowered brows, his aggravated expression unchanging, “Fine, fine, Steve it is.”
There were a few short laughs amongst the group of students.
“Is this about my detention? Because I forgot about it. I was completely swamped in homework over the weekend and the thought of it just passed my mind–”
Plus, he had his three best friends alongside him. Ever since they met in the sixth grade, Tony, Clint, Natasha, and Bruce were inseparable. They had distinct, sometimes clashing personalities, but they somehow made it work. They were always there for each other whenever each of them went through something such as Tony losing his former butler and family friend, Jarvis; Clint losing his mother; Bruce and his heartbreak with Betty Ross; and Natasha being separated from her two sisters due to her parents’ very messy divorce.
Apart from his detention mishaps at school, Tony loved his life.
“And why the hell does that matter?” Fury said, practically snarling at him, “This was something important,
Coulson’s voice was in a somewhat reproachful tone. He wasn’t on board with Tony’s facetious, sarcastic tone.
“Fuck, I can’t stand those asshats.”
“Well I don’t need to be. I just know those types are overrated.”
please tell me what you think of this fic and thanks to those who leave a kudos!
Tony turned around from his crouched down position, cellphone in both hands. He resisted the urge to let out a sigh when he realized the voice belonged to the timid yet overzealous Peter Parker. Tony stood up, leaning his side against his locker. He noticed that the hallways had cleared out, everyone else ready to go home for the weekend, just as he was.
“Yup,” Tony popped the p, his attention faraway and inattentive. He absently but lightly swung his legs from the desk as they barely reached the floor. All he was thinking about right now was what time he’d get home, “I work on projects at home all the time; robots, engines, solar powered devices, all sorts of gadgets.”
“Bruce,” Tony whined, thankful to hear his voice, “Where were you all night?”
After what was possibly the most humiliating ordeal Tony has ever dealt with in recent times, he was able to make it to his second period class of the day as each class spanned 45 minutes on Mondays. Before leaving to class and begrudgingly telling his friends about what went down, he had his parents pull him aside in the office. The long-winded lecture he got from his father and the disappointed words his mother threw at him was just…crushing. It preemptively set him in a grouchy mood.
The brunette only nodded before sitting back at her desk.
“Mom?”
“Compared to being expelled, yes,” Bruce said, adamant on his words.
“Okay, okay,” Clint said, innocently putting his hands up.
He partially shielded his eyes from the harsh afternoon sun, seeing a group of three students. Fortunately, there weren’t any teachers in sight so it was just them. He pursed his lips to the side, his eyes unmoving. All of them were very familiar faces. Like him, they were seniors – Bucky Barnes, Sam Wilson, and Steve Rogers.
“Fine, you can help me,” Tony gave in, “Just so you know, we’re making fried chicken and waffles.”
“…By not talking about he who must not be named, got it,” Bucky said, earning an amused chuckle from Sam.
“No, I’m ordering takeout for the both of us cause there’s pretty much nothing to eat.”
“I never said that.”
“Hmm, you do make a point,” Clint uttered, he skipped ahead of the other three, “Come on guys, we have 30 minutes till lunch ends.”
Tony’s momentary happiness was immediately whisked away the moment he placed his phone back in his pocket.
Next to the desk she was seated in, her friend, Clint Barton, had his book bag open. Clumsily stuffed inside of it was a bag full of homemade mint chip cookies, the concoctions a disorienting mix of brown and green with flecks of black from how burnt they were.
------
“Tony.”
As Tony began to put on his clothes, Thor drove back towards the direction of Tony’s house to finish their game of “truth and dare, but without the truth”.
“Wow, Quill really outdid himself this time, huh?” Clint said, eyeing the dried, high quality cannabis between his thumb and index fingers.
“Let’s hope not,” Tony said. He suddenly took off his coat before unbuttoning his floral print shirt. He pulled the garment off of him, revealing his sleeveless undershirt.
His steps were slower, his self-assurance slowly waning. He knocked on the principal’s door.
Tony loved these idiots with all his heart.
Tony heard Peter’s voice from the other line.
------
Tony almost sighed, instead he begrudgingly gave up his smartphone to him.
important, to me. Do you know how bad this makes me look?”
------
“I’m sure she’ll have a good time, just cause she gets to spend some time with you. You’re one of the most kind-hearted people I know.”
Tony stirred a few times before opening his eyes. He grimaced and clutched his head in pain as the harsh sunlight invaded his eyes. He furrowed his brows before shutting them back closed. His throbbing headache was persistent. He didn’t dare to move one bit; the pain was too much for him to bear. Of all the times Tony had thrown and been to parties, he had never drank so much at one before, now that he thought about it.
“You think your stingy rich neighbors will call the cops on us?” Clint asked.
Steve chuckled at his mother’s dramatics.
“What does it look like?” Natasha said.
“I’ll catch you up on things after I give the outline of what we’ll be doing today.”
Tony was getting nervous, again.
“Sorry, something caught my attention,” Steve quickly apologized, “What’d you say again?”
“Yeah, you do.”
Tony, Natasha, and Clint were lying beside each other on the grass, staring at nothing in particular. The talkative trio retreated into a peaceful silence, the chirping of the birds being the only occasional source of noise. A thin plume of smoke remained above them even after they finished.
The sad thing was that Quentin was right. Tony didn’t have his usual quips spraying out of his mouth in retort against Quentin’s words, because of that. An uncharacteristic guilt was bubbling within him, as much as he hated it. His scathing words were something that wouldn’t escape his mind.
Oh yeah, cause he wouldn’t let her.
------
“I’ll try them,” Tony said, making a beckoning gesture with his hand for Clint to hand the bag towards him.
“And if you have an unexcused absence for
After Coulson recapped the whole project to Tony, they were the last to head out of the classroom, Coulson locking the doors.
“You heard me throw up my entire body weight,” Tony slightly cringed, pulling his knees to his chest. Bruce always knew how to dote on him. If not, he’d probably end up dead on the roadside if it wasn’t for him.
“This isn’t about the detention,” Fury interrupted him.
------
Tears were practically streaming down Clint’s face, his laughter uncontrollable.
“But I wasn’t even on school grounds when that happened!” Tony retorted, his leg rapidly bouncing, “You can’t punish me for something that happened outside of school.”
As of what Tony currently knew, Coulson was the team leader or chaperone who oversaw the volunteers/students, that there were 31 high schoolers who were the considered the team of volunteers – all of them juniors or older, and that there was a large construction site not too far from the school that their work would take place in.
“Taking a break, Darce?” Tony said.
Tony forced his eyes open and sat up. He nearly doubled over from the sudden nauseous feeling in his stomach.
Tony removed himself from the hold of Thor and Jane, clumsily making his way back to his seat.
They all stood up from their seats, Rhodey making sure Tony could walk on his own two feet. Thankfully, he had his balance in tow. The alcohol warmed up his system pretty good, but he wasn’t completely gone yet.
How was he going to explain this to them?
It was 3:49, which meant it was time to start his first day of volunteer work.
After Coulson finished, everyone got up from their desks, the desk tips slightly scraping the against the floor and their steps quick and prepared. They were clearly ready to head outside to start yet another day of hard work. Judging by the enthusiastic atmosphere within the room, this type of project was unmistakably enjoyable for them, much to Tony’s surprise. He could see Darcy wait for him by the door. Before he could reach her, Coulson’s voice stopped him in his tracks.
“Thank goodness,” Clint added, earning a few snickers among the group. Tony slightly shoved him in jest.
“Make sure the questions are super embarrassing. This one here looks like he hasn’t done anything too obscene, but you’d be surprised,” Tony said, nudging Rhodey on the arm.
“Oh, don’t worry about me. I can hold my own weight.”
“So, you’ve been living there for almost six years and you
“I’m not stalking you, if that’s what you’re thinking,” Tony retorted, ignoring the other’s cold tone. He wasn’t going to let himself get intimidated, in any way shape or form, by Steve fucking Rogers. He’d play it cool instead, maybe he could entertain himself at his expense. It was the least he could do, to keep himself from going crazy in this project he was forced to do.
“I know this is something you’re not thrilled about,” Coulson said after a short silence. He watched Tony sit over top of one of the desks, his way of getting comfortable.
“All that money and no class,” The brunette said.
Tony maneuvered himself through the groups of people in his foyer, their conversations easily drowned out by the blasting of music from the nearby speakers. His hand tightly clutched onto his plastic cup of some unidentifiable alcoholic drink. It tasted good so it didn’t matter too much to him.
“Fine, I’ll try. I won’t make things hard for you guys. Y’all have a job to do and I have a year-long punishment I can’t back out of…unless I want to get expelled.”
…and he had to get there in 11 minutes.
Tony couldn’t help but to grin at Peter’s jubilant voice.
“Tony!” A familiar voice whispered.
“Let’s all go. I want to see this,” Thor added.
When he exited his bedroom, he saw a view of the foyer.
“What? I’m taking the dare to new heights,” Tony said, his nonchalance heightened by his drunkenness.
“I’ll be in my office since he’s meeting me there,” Coulson said. He noticed the stiff body language between the two boys, his discomfort surfacing just by looking at them, “The both of you look like you saw someone get run over by a truck. Why don’t you two introduce each other to yourselves, get comfortable. You’ll both be working a lot together for the rest of the year so that initial bond is important.”
“Cold, huh?” Natasha said, as if it were the most obvious thing.
Tony was well-renowned for the grandiose parties he would throw for the school when his parents weren’t home. It just so happened that his "detention" spanned the length of two detentions - two slips and all - and fell on the same day both of them were out of the house. Maybe he could make an excuse that he forgot about it. He could get his dad to vouch for him and they could reschedule it. Fuck, he was a genius.
“I don’t think that’s healthy,” Bruce shrugged.
He felt his phone vibrate in his coat pocket.
“Okay, that’ll do,” Darcy said, she then beckoned Tony and the other two to join them, “Come on, you guys!”
“Ms. Garrett is out to get me. It’s all some part of her calculated scheme to get me kicked out of this school,” The moment their second period class ended, Tony began his tirade, “Notice how it’s five detentions before you get a referral and once you get three referrals in one semester, you get expelled. These two slips add up to my fourth detention after getting two referrals. She’s counting down my days here as we speak...”
“Guys, make sure not to blow it in my direction!” Bruce called out to them, keeping a far enough distance from the other three.
“If you really want to know why I’m here, I’ll tell you,” Tony exclaimed, sprinting up to the taller male to catch up, “I mean, I thought you’d already know, it’s common knowledge around the school, by now, at least.”
“Miss, I’m trying to catch my breath.”
Tony froze.
“I get mandatory community service for four hours, three to five days of the week, Saturday detention every other week, and no more absences or tardies. Oh yeah! And a 2000-word essay on why it’s wrong for me to run around in my underwear in front of my principal’s house! Easy-peasy.”
“He says you ran around his property yelling like a madman while he was having a meeting with the district’s school board directors, at his home,” His father said, unable to look at Tony. He was furious.

****************************************************************
Steve.
Bruce stood up quickly and helped Tony up. ''I'll get a cab, alright?'' he said and held the door open. Tony wrapped one arm around him and held his belly with the other. Bruce called for a taxi and helped the other get inside. ''Wait, stay with me, please?'' Tony asked. ''I'm scared.''
Tony was doing good. He no longer had morning sickness and didn't feel as heavy as he'd expected when he had first got pregnant. His godmother didn't have to work late like she had to last week so they were watching movies and eating popcorn almost every night. Tony was happy.
When Tony stood up and tried to bend over to reach his boxers, Steve opened his eyes and leaned on his elbows to get a better look at Tony. ''Goodmorning,'' he said, his voice still thick and sleepy.
Pepper groaned, “Seriously?”
At the front desk a woman sat with her hair pulled back and glasses tipped down to the edge of her nose. She was furiously tapping at her keyboard when Steve stopped and stood in front of her.
“It’s okay,” Steve said when Tony simply ignored the intrusive sound.
Pepper’s face went red, but she didn’t loosen her grip. She turned to Steve before she’d said something she really shouldn’t to the man who signs her checks. Even if, technically, she signed her own checks.
As the elevator began moving up, Jarvis spoke again, “Facial recognition, sir.”
Tony snickered and shook his head, “He’s probably playing some game. He’s two on the inside.”
Tony wiggled his brow, “You could always find out.”
“Excuse me?” Steve managed to say after a moment.
“Different things? Different how?” Tony inquired. He wasn’t going to let Steve off the hook that easy.
talk. Like, really. But he didn’t mind because he liked to listen. Even though a lot of the things Tony said in his rambles went straight over Steve’s head, the parts he did get were easy to chime in on. Tony could talk like a machine, but he didn’t interrupt Steve when he wanted to add something in. On the contrary, he looked deep into Steve’s eyes and really listened to what he said, then fired something back at him, either witty or plainly insightful. It was bizarre to Steve how easy it was to talk to Tony. They were on two completely different wavelengths, but somehow it was like they weren’t so different at all.
“You mean,
Steve managed to fall into step with her as they turned the corner to a large set of glass, double doors. He could see from there that the office was empty. Something akin to annoyance flashed in Pepper’s eyes; Steve barely caught it.
his body being stripped under that gaze.
Tony opened his mouth, closed it, thought for a moment, then said, “That too, but it’s not like I can’t do both.” He held his hands out, as if the idea was brilliant. Pepper gave him a look that suggested he was growing a second head.
“Oh,” he perked up. “No one’s dead? Well that’s a relief,” because for a moment there he wasn’t sure if that report included a manslaughter and warrant for his arrest. Pepper sagged her shoulders and let her mouth fall open in disbelief. “What? Okay, sorry. I’m kidding,” he rolled his eyes, while silently admitting to himself that he wasn’t really kidding.
In the office, Steve was surprised to see Tony re-enter first. He’d tried not to stare at them while they were having their obviously private conversation. Plus the walls were soundproof, so staring just felt creepy when he realized he couldn’t even hear them.
Steve felt himself sweating, “Uh, what are you?”
Tony scoffed, “You think I’ll give up that easily. Like I said,” he gestured to the mess on their table that was once their dinner and enunciated “Cour-ting.”
They stopped to observe him. Steve pointed at the vehicle and turned his head to Tony, “Is everything okay in there?”
Tony tilted his head and pushed up on the balls of his feet to somehow increase the feeling, and yet it felt like it would never be enough. Steve’s lips were incredibly soft and no matter how well Steve played the
They were trapped in a haze. It was all touching and tasting, neither bothered by the wet smack of their lips in the relatively quiet hallway. But the haze wasn’t thick enough to ignore the way it felt when Tony pushed his hips forward, sliding the full length of his clothed girth against Steve’s leg. It was like a bolt of electricity shot through Steve’s veins. The shock of it all was enough to thrust him back into reality.
screwing on the first date even considered a lifestyle?
Steve eyed it, and didn’t accept it right away.
“Please stop,” Steve groaned and fought the smile off his lips, because he sincerely didn’t appreciate being made a spectacle in front of nearly his entire class.
“Fine, fine. What do you suggest, Boss Lady?” He twisted the screwdriver in his hand as he listened to what she had to say.
Steve shrugged a little then, “Yeah, besides this one is much more than what I was paying at my old place.”
Steve shrugged and Sam barked out a laugh.
“So how about that dinner?” Tony asked, and when Steve’s eyes lifted to meet his, he spread his mouth into a wide grin.
“Uh, excuse me. Mind telling me what the hell that was about?” Sam said as he fought off his grin to appear more serious than he was.
It wasn’t like there weren’t other people to mess around and have a good time with, but as typical of a reason as it was, Tony just couldn’t stand the idea of losing this battle. If there were a problem he would fix it. This thing with Steve was no different. Steve’s reservations about sleeping with Tony were that he wasn’t a wham-bam-thank you ma’am type of guy.
Steve stood from his seat almost immediately and his height seemed to shock Tony. The billionaire’s strides faltered and his eyes grew wide.
“I’m six foot four,” he answered, sounding unsure.
Tony faltered before he took another bite. “Jesus, he’s not… is he…?”
Pepper rolled her eyes, “Oh
“It’s not a good time for me,” Steve’s voice might have cracked a bit, but he was going to ignore it and stand his ground. Tony might have noticed, because he looked like he wanted to burst out into laughter. Thankfully, he didn’t.
to look at.
Steve lifted his eyebrow at him, but forwent the sink in favor of seeing what was inside the steel, double-door fridge that was nothing like the white, old, rumbling one he’d seen during his brief tour of the apartment.
And then he was gone. He walked off, waved a hand over his head and left the apartment without much of a goodbye.
She smiled and interrupted him. ''Yes, I came home early last night. And when I went to his bedroom this morning I saw your note. Thank you for comforting him, I'll take it from here,''  she said and he smiled. ''Alright, thanks,'' he replied and turned around, hearing the door close behind him. He knew Peggy always had been a good parent to Tony but he was still worried about him, something wasn't right.
''Goodnight, Bruce.''
The next morning Tony woke up in a good mood. He got dressed in his maternity clothes and grabbed some coffee in a to-go mug and went on his way to Steve so they could go to the doctor together.
[[ 6 weeks later ]]
''Can you please hand me my boxers? My back hurts,'' Tony explained and Steve immediately helped him get dressed completely. Steve smiled when Tony slipped his arm through the sleeve of his hoodie and sat down again, blanket wrapped around his waist.

''Come on, Peggy isn't home. Just get inside, please?'' Tony begged and Bruce took a deep breath. ''Fine,'' he murmured and took the other's hand, following him inside. ''Are you sure she isn't home?'' Bruce asked to be sure and Tony smiled. ''Peg? Are you here?'' he yelled through the house but didn't get an answer. ''Kiss me,'' he said and pulled Bruce on the couch, smirking. ''W-what?'' he stuttered and carefully lied down next to him but Tony just pressed his lips against Bruce's, tugging at his shirt. Bruce returned the kiss, sliding his tongue into Tony's mouth. Tony moaned softly and Bruce took off his shirt. He placed his hands on Tony's hips while Tony ran his hand over Bruce's abs, getting hard quickly. ''Take off my pants,'' he whispered and Bruce pulled back, unzipping his pants and slowly taking them off while he locked his eyes on Tony's erection. Tony bit his lip and as soon as his pants came off he pulled the other back again, kissing him heavily but when Bruce slid his hand into his boxer, he gasped and pulled back.
''I know that,'' he said and waited for his drink he desperately needed.
Tony finds out he's pregnant and isn't happy about it but hearing Peggy's words makes him less nervous to tell Steve. Although when the moment is there, he doesn't know what to say.
They just stared at each other, thinking about the biggest decision they ever had to make in their life while cars went by on the street and people carried on their day.
Tony put some more mayonnaise on his bread and bit his lip. ''Yeah.''
Steve wants to keep and raise the baby together but slowly forgets about Tony when a certain someone pops up in his life. Meanwhile, Tony finds out what he's having and couldn't be more excited.
''Steve?''
''Absolutely. I'll just order a pizza, ice cream and watch movies. You deserve a girl's night out, Peg,'' he confirmed and Peggy gave him one more kiss before disappearing into the bathroom.
His godmother was just brewing some coffee when he came in. ''Sure. Just be careful and be back before dinner time!'' she replied and heard the door closing.
A few hours later, after dinner, Tony decided it was time to tell Steve and walked to his place. A thousand thoughts went through his mind as he was walking, thinking about everything that could go wrong, everything that Steve could say but it all went away when he stood there in front of his door, swallowing nervously. ''May the force be with me,'' he whispered to himself and then the door opened.
''Just wait... uh, I heard what happened between you and him and so I came here to give you this and here's the candy you dropped,'' he said, unsure as he handed him both things. Tony closed his mouth and took the candy and flowers from him. ''Thank you... I guess. Is that all you came to say?'' he asked and Bucky shook his head. ''I talked to Steve and we both agreed on that this situation you two are in, is too complicated and I really don't want to make things more uncomfortable so I decided to stay out of the way and just be friends with Steve but what I'm saying is I think you should talk to Steve. He's willing to make things right... again. But he's too afraid to talk to you so that's why I'm here too. To ask if you would call him?''
''She? It's a girl? Oh my god, honey, I'm so happy for you! A little daughter, oh she's gonna be so cute and I can braid her hair when she's older,'' Peggy said in excitement, tears forming in her eyes. ''I'm so proud of you,'' she whispered and placed her hand on Tony's shoulder. ''And don't you worry, alright? I'll help you with everything you need. Now and when she's born,'' Peggy promised him but it reminded him of Steve, feeling sad again. ''So what did Steve say? Was he excited?'' his godmother asked, not knowing what had happened before and Tony sighed, shaking his head. ''He missed the appointment. I went there so we could drive together but he had just gotten out of bed so I had to borrow his car,'' he explained but didn't want to tell her about Bucky. ''Speaking of him, I'm gonna bring the car back and tell him about it. I'll be back for dinner, I promise,'' Tony said and left.
They were silent for a moment until Steve laughed and leaned against his best friend. ''Thanks, Tony. Let's get out before we get caught,'' he said and dragged him along again, this time laughing.
Bucky had just left when Steve opened the door for Tony, dragging him inside. ''Tony, listen,'' he began as he put him down on the couch. ''I'm sorry for missing the appointment. It was stupid and it won't happen again but last night, Bucky just showed up. Said he missed me and it was a mistake breaking up with me and I just fell for it. But we're over, I told him that. He just left,'' he explained to him but Tony was still upset. ''Why did you let him open the door? You know he doesn't like me,'' he argued and Steve took a deep breath. ''I didn't know it was you, Tones. Come on. I'm sorry,'' Steve apologized. ''Does he even know that I'm pregnant with your baby?'' Tony asked and Steve swallowed nervously. ''No, he does not. But it doesn't matter, because he's not coming back,'' he said and took both of Tony's hands in his. ''Believe me, Tony.''
*********************************************************
I had the best time of my life last night with you but I think it's been a mistake. Don't be angry, please. I'll always be your best friend.
Steve smiled and closed his eyes, gently pulling Tony towards him so they could cuddle as he nodded. ''Don't worry, Tones. I'm not going anywhere,'' he said and hid his face in Tony's pillow, eventually falling asleep.
Tony chewed on his lip and shrugged, looking down. ''Not long.''
''What do you want to do?'' Tony heard and was surprised by the question. ''What d- You aren't angry or upset?'' he asked and eventually looked at Steve who came closer to gently hold the other's hands. ''Now why would I be angry? I mean, yes this is overwhelming and unexpected but this wasn't anyone's fault,'' he assured Tony and pulled him into a hug.
''Take it easy, Tony. Don't get yourself drunk. You know Peggy's gonna be angry if you get home drunk,'' he mumbled but gave him another beer nonetheless. ''I won't get drunk.''
Bruce pulled him inside gently and invited him to sit next to him on the couch. ''Shh, it's okay. I promise, everything's okay,'' Bruce mumbled, hand stroking Tony's back. ''No, it's not!'' Tony exclaimed and leaned into him, hiding his face. ''Then what's going on?'' Bruce asked once more. The boy in his arms didn't reply. Instead, he cried for another twenty minutes until he fell asleep.
Pepper grimaced, noting that her boss smelled like motor oil and burning metal. He was wearing an ACDC shirt that was covered in tar, and he was greased with oil and soot from his fingertips to his elbows.
“Tony—” Steve tried again, humored but sounding exhausted.
“How about that. I’m a different kind of home wrecker.”
“Tony,” she warned.
“You know, to go with the flowers of course,” Tony shrugged as if there was something to be impressed about in the king sized Snickers he was presenting Steve.
Tony tilted his head, inspecting Steve as if he were a tool in his workshop.
He let out a breath, taken from his thoughts when a business ready woman brushed past him to get inside. Nobody really seemed to notice him there. Even at a towering 6’4, built like a brick house, he felt small compared to all of them. It was as if just looking at him they could see that he’d gotten this shirt in a five dollar target bin, and that he’d gotten lucky when he found these slacks at the Goodwill in his size.
“I’m only saying that we could ask them to send us a dummy. That’s all,” a charismatic voice said; one that Steve vaguely recognized from the news and miscellaneous interviews.
Maybe they both had seen it coming, but it was still a shock when their lips met. Steve let out a little gasp just before Tony’s lips completely melded over his
Both Steve and Sam sputtered. Sam spoke first, “No! No way.”
“Whoa, whoa!” Tony stopped him, straightening his back and sending Steve a playful glare. “Are you saying I’m not buff?”
He could definitely say he wasn’t expecting to see Tony Stark standing outside, leaned against a silver sports car, holding a bundle of roses in one arm and what looked like a Snickers bar in the other.
“Good,” she nodded, “Follow me. I’ll take you back to Mr. Stark’s office.” She walked off then with brisk, long strides that weren’t easy to keep up with.
Tony swiveled back towards his work desk and picked up the little robot he’d been building out of toaster and old computer parts. He half listened to what she had to say.
Tony scoffed, “Fine.” He pointed next, “But I reserve the right to serenade you if the feeling overcomes me.”
“What? What does that even mean?” Pepper sputtered while Tony walked around her back towards his office. “And how do you know he’s gay, or single?”
“Let go, Tony,” Steve said and something sparked in Tony’s eyes.
“H-how do you know my name?” He stammered, wondering if this was a robot or if someone was speaking to him over an intercom.
Steve was feeling a little nervous. He'd called Bucky to come to the mall so he could finally have a talk with him and Tony together and tell Bucky that he was becoming a father soon. He tried to hide his feelings when he noticed Tony. ''Hey,'' he said but it came out rather soft. ''Hey, Stevie,'' Tony answered and sat next to him. ''What's going on? You look a little pale,'' he mumbled and Steve sighed. ''Yeah, uh-''
Tony was surprised and grateful for Bruce's hospitality. He nodded and took the phone, dialing Peggy's number.
Everything was okay. Tony and Steve had forgotten about their shared night and went back to being best friends. They helped each other with homework, ate lunch together with their other friend, Pepper, they hung out together like before and to be honest, it felt good. Until this morning... when Tony had woken up by nausea and threw up for two hours. The first hour, Peggy held him and tried to tell him it was just a fever, that it would be gone by tomorrow with some nursing but after two hours she began to worry and decided to call a doctor who came as quickly as he could. ''I'm Doctor Lee. Can you tell me about his symptoms, please?'' he asked while he listened to Tony's heart which seemed to be nothing wrong with. ''Yes, of course. He's just been throwing up for two hours and he told me he has a strange feeling in his belly. Can you tell what it is, doctor?'' Peggy asked worriedly, looking at her son. She knew she wasn't his real mother but it felt like it anyways. The doctor asked Tony a few more questions and quickly came to a conclusion. ''M'am, as far as I can tell, he's pregnant,'' he explained and Tony sat up quickly from where he was lying down on the couch. ''What did you say?''
Tony was too confused to do anything about it but the other already pulled back with a smirk on his face. ''We'll figure this out, alright? If everything goes alright, we'll graduate within two months, then we don't have to worry about college anymore. I will find a job and there we go,'' Steve proudly said and kissed his best friend's cheek.
''Hey, Tones. Umm, you told me you'd call me this week but you didn't and I was wondering how you and Sarah were doing. You're probably still angry but I was just worried...'' Steve admitted and Tony leaned against the wall, hearing him out as he stared in blue eyes, feeling a tingle as he did. Since a few weeks ago he began to feel horny and read it happened to many men and women during pregnancy.
''Fuck me. Fuck me now,'' Tony replied and wrapped his leg around Steve's waist who in return lifted him with slight effort only to lower him onto the couch and continue the heated kiss that was interrupted.
''Are you going to tell Steve tonight?'' she asked, driving back home. Tony chewed on his lip again and nodded. ''I have to. He needs to know, it's his baby too. I'm just gonna tell him he can be as involved as he wants too,'' he said and she smiled. ''I'm proud of you, Tony. I really am.''
''Steve... I hate to ruin your fantasy but we're not a couple. We just had sex. Casual sex. I was super horny and you showed up and I fell for it... it won't happen again,'' Tony pointed out and pulled away from Steve. Steve's face fell and he shook his head.
*******************************************************************
Steve chuckled and cupped his cheek. ''Hey, you don't have to be shy with me,'' he explained and slowly came closer, gently pressing his lips against Tony's. Tony easily gave in and parted his lips so Steve could slide his tongue inside. Steve began to kiss a little rougher and Tony hummed, pushing him down on the mattress so he was on top of him, tugging at his shirt. ''Easy,'' Steve said with a smile, pulling back as he took off both his and the other's shirt, biting his lip at the sight of Tony. ''I never noticed how muscular you actually are,'' he commented and grabbed Tony's ass which made him gasp. ''Steve!'' he shrieked and then laughed, coming closer. ''Is this.. okay for us to do?''
''Is that a trick question?'' he asked as Steve couldn't keep his eyes away from the sonogram. ''Come on, Steve,'' Tony sighed, his knees beginning to shake.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
''Tony! Come in, Pepper and I were just about to call you, we've ordered three pizzas and we were thinking about going to Maya's birthday party later? You were invited too, right?'' he asked and Tony nodded. ''Yeah, I was, but, uh, I need to tell you something so could we maybe go outside or something?'' he asked and waited for an answer. This was gonna be hard.
''We're having a girl,'' he said, getting excited again. ''Really? Oh, Tony, we're having a girl!'' He laughed and hugged Tony shortly. "Let me see the picture!'' he mumbled while he stared at Tony.
Tony nodded. ''Yeah, me too,'' he assured her and got into the car, happy to sit down again. ''I'm just so nervous,'' he said as he stared at his sonogram, still trying to believe he really was pregnant and he had to tell his best friend.
Peggy finds out Tony is having a girl and is excited about it. Steve explains what happened and tries to apologize. They come up with a name for their baby girl. The next day, Tony meets someone and is having a good time until something goes wrong.
After a wonderful night of satisfaction and screaming each other's names, a ray of sunlight shone through the curtains, waking Tony up from his sleep. He yawned and opened his eyes slowly, stretching out before looking around his room. He frowned when he saw a note on the pillow next to him, quickly reading through it;
Tony shot Steve a confused look. ''Next time?'' he said, getting up with a little effort and support from the table. ''What do you mean?'' he asked.
''Bucky? What was he doing here?'' Peggy asked and Tony shrugged. ''He apologized and asked if I wanted to call Steve. I said I had to think about it. I'm still really angry about what Steve said to me,'' Tony mumbled and Peggy hugged him. ''You know you don't have to call him, right?'' she pointed out and he nodded. ''Yes, I know but I think I'm gonna have to talk to him eventually. I mean, I don't have to forgive him yet, just talk,'' he explained and grabbed his phone. ''I'll be upstairs, thanks Peg!''
That made Tony smile. Maybe this wasn't so bad.
Tony was talking to Peggy while they were having breakfast. He told her everything that happened and cried again but she dried his tears and told him he did the right thing. ''No more crying, alright, sweetheart?'' she asked and Tony sniffled. ''I know, it just feels so sudden and I really like him, Peg,'' he said and shrugged. ''I know you do but as you said it yourself, stress is not good for the baby so being alone is good right now. And I'll be there for you all the time, okay?''
''No. Not a good idea. You have to leave,'' he said. He wanted to do the right thing, he wanted to send Steve away. He was still so angry what he'd said but his hormones became the boss of him and his body.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Steve walked into the living room and smiled at Tony. ''Hey, Tones,'' he said. ''Can I talk to you for a second?'' he asked and Tony wiped his mouth with his sleeve, nodding. ''Yeah sure,'' he replied. ''I'll be back soon,'' he said to Peggy and she nodded.
''You didn't even give me a chance to say something before you stuck your tongue down my throat and don't pretend I did not try to send you away. I warned you that this wasn't a good idea but you kept going so I decided to go with it too! Ain't my fault, Steve,'' Tony countered and dragged Steve outside on his porch. ''Get out,'' he said and pushed Steve towards the pavement, his cheeks crimson red with anger.
''Hey, Steve- oh, dear,'' she said when she noticed Tony next to him, smiling. ''Hey, Peg!'' he chirped and walked past her, straight to the bathroom. Steve leaned against the doorframe and shrugged. ''I'm sorry, he came to my house and he wanted a drink but he just wouldn't stop... I don't know if you know what's going on but-''
*************************************************************************
''Very funny.'' Was the only reply he got.
Positive. Tony couldn't stop staring at the word. It never meant something to him before until now. Positive. ''Fuck,'' Tony said and dropped the test on the floor. ''Goddamnit!'' he yelled and slammed the door when he walked back into the living room. ''Unbelievable, just unbelievable, Peg. It's fucking positive!'' he breathed out and hid his face in his hands as he began to panic. ''I don't know how to tell Steve. This is just going to be life changing... I can't do it. I can't tell him, Peggy. Can you imagine me telling him I'm pregnant while we were supposed to forget about all this? Why couldn't it be just a fun night? Why?''
She answered the phone rather quickly and told him everything was okay and he could stay the night at Bruce's place as long as he would tell her what had happened.
''And then he just kissed me and I pushed him right into the river,'' Pepper said while cackling and Steve was laughing so hard he had to lie down on the floor. Let's just stay here and not go to Maya's party,'' he suggested and both Pepper and Tony nodded. ''Yeah, this is too much fun,'' she cheered and raised her glass. ''To us!''
The days he had to go to college were exhausting but worth it. There were rumors that Tony was pregnant but nobody really knew for sure because he was good at hiding his belly because it wasn't that big yet. He had told Pepper a week after Steve and she had squealed in excitement, rambling about all the presents she was going to buy and the stuff they needed. And now they all graduated, proudly getting their picture taken with their diploma.
Tony slept for hours and woke up around dinner time. He opened his eyes slowly and sat up with a groan. ''Bruce?'' he said unsure, not seeing him in the living room. Soon, he heard someone coming downstairs and when the door opened it was indeed Bruce who was wearing a soft smile when he noticed Tony was awake. ''Hey,'' he softly said and handed Tony a blanket. He happily accepted it and wrapped it around his body. ''Can you get me some water?'' he asked and Bruce was already on his way to the kitchen, coming back after a minute. ''There you go,'' he said and gave him the water and a bag full of jelly beans. ''Thought you might like some candy. Last time we went out, you told me that was your craving,'' he admitted and chuckled.
But twenty minutes later, Steve knocked on the door of his best friend's home, waiting for Peggy.
****************************************************************
Tony read it ten times until he realized it wasn't a dream. ''Oh my god...'' he whispered and stood up, quickly getting dressed. ''Peggy?'' he called as he went downstairs, opening the door of the living room. ''Peggy? I'm going to Steve, alright?''
''Pizza's got here five minutes ago, so they're still warm. What were you guys talking about anyway?'' Pepper asked and Tony looked over at his best friend, shaking his head. He didn't want her to know just yet. Steve smiled at Pepper while he grabbed a slice of pizza. ''About a school project for science,'' he easily lied and took a sip of his beer.
[1 week later]
''I'm so happy your baby's healthy, sweetie,'' Peggy said while walking back to her car.
[[ 1 week later, after the appointment ]]
''Bucky? I- uh, are you- are you looking for Steve?'' he stuttered and strangely glanced at the roses in his hand. Bucky cleared his throat and nervously scratched his neck. ''To be honest, I was looking for you. Just hear me out, alright? I suck at these things so give me a chance before you shut the door, please,'' he began and Tony was too shocked to even try and close the door.
[[Hi, Pepper gave me your number. Sorry for bothering you but I kinda wanted to ask you out for a while but I didn't know if it was appropriate since you're pregnant but I finally got the courage. You can definitely say no, I understand your situation is complicated. Just let me know. Bye! -Bruce]]
Tony shot him one last look as he turned around, seeing Bruce sitting on his chair on his porch next to his with a shocked look on his face. Tony glanced at Bruce for a moment and then went back inside, tears rolling down his cheeks again. Things were still messed up with Steve and he felt half responsible for it but he also felt anger towards Steve, no matter how much he loved him. Tony didn't want to lose his best friend but he felt like he was losing grip.
Steve blinked and focused his eyes on his friend. His face was probably red, because it felt uncomfortably flushed.
The woman’s eyes sparkled, and he wondered if it was because the light hit her just right. She turned to her computer, and without the heat of her eyes on him he was able to relax a bit. He looked around the desk, and his eyes landed on a nameplate. It read: Maggie.
In the office, Steve decided to sit in one of the comfy looking leather chairs. Behind the main desk was a large window that displayed a view of New York City he’d never seen before. He let the landscape take his mind off of things until he heard the door open behind him and the voices that followed.
“Jarvis, turn it down please,” Pepper asked as she approached Tony.
If he hadn’t just ended things with Buck, he might have accepted Tony’s offer at a date. He was undeniably attractive and obviously intelligent, if not a bit more out of the box than what Steve was used to. But, he could tell Tony wasn’t a flowers and chocolates kind of guy. He was more of a hello-goodbye, one-night fling sort of fella. And Steve just wasn’t interested in short time investments.
“Do you purposely forget these things, or do you do it to test me? Need I remind you that I was valedictorian every year in my undergrad and masters programs? I’ve never failed a test Tony.”
Steve’s cheeks were starting to feel hot, and he knew they were growing redder by the second.
“Of course. We’ll arrange for you to stay in a suite for now. Once you find a place you like, we’ll cover your living expenses for the year. It’s the least we can do.”
“Excuse us for one moment,” Pepper said to Steve, flashing her award-winning smile.
“Go out with me,” was his response and Steve bit his lip before he’d said something stupid.
? And damn, Tony wanted to reach out and touch those muscles. The way that bargain bin shirt clutched to his chest and squeezed around the obvious bicep muscles was enough to make Tony’s mouth water. Never had he ever been so turned on by cheaply made clothes.
Steve wiped the sweat from his palms onto his pants and braced himself, then turned to eye both Pepper and a man that could only be Tony Stark. Of course, he wasn’t exactly what he’d been picturing.
He went to the sink to fill the glasses, but Tony’s voice stopped him.
Steve scoffed out a laugh and shook his head. “Should I check the fridge?”
“You know,” Tony continued on, and Pepper was growing increasingly red. “We’ve got some extra suites here in the Tower. Hell, the whole fourth floor is empty.” Tony said, sounding nonchalant, but Pepper immediately cut in.
Steve looked behind him at the inquisitive group of his peers before he turned back and begrudgingly grabbed the roses. Almost immediately afterwards, he pushed up to Tony so that he could whisper, “Can we get in please?” Steve nearly begged because he swore everyone around him had their phones out taking videos and photos and it was just too much for him.
Tony did quiet down, but he was still smiling, obviously pleased with himself. Almost as an after thought, he held the candy bar up to Steve.
Pulling out a water bottle, he wordlessly closed the fridge and opened the bottle to divide the contents between the two glasses. He slid one over the counter to Tony and lifted the other to take a few gulps.
Tony rolled his eyes, “Hey, I’m just asking you out on a date. What’s the harm in that?” He turned to Pepper with his question and she opened his mouth to shut him down again.
Steve laughed at that, because he’d assumed Tony hadn’t
Steve scratched the back of his head, looked to the side, then peeked back at Tony who was looking expectant. “Well, I have to say no to your offer. But, I would like it…” he paused, unsure of how to say this without being rude. He tried again, “I would like it if you could help me find a new place to stay.” He looked at Pepper then, and she relaxed her shoulders.
Steve shook his head fervently and explained, “He’s a good friend.”
Unlike the magazines, television programs and billboards, the Tony Stark who entered the room looked like he’d just rolled around underneath a car with a leaking engine and took a moment to use the oil as a secondary lotion. He smelled like iron too.
His eyes grew wide, and he pushed away before he felt more of the hardness between Tony’s legs. Or worse, Tony felt the hardness between his.
The dinner was nicer than Steve thought it would be. It wasn’t just the fancy restaurant. Actually, instead of some five star spot, they’d went to the burger joint three blocks away from Steve’s new apartment. The driver, who Steve learned was named Happy, dropped them off in front of the apartment and they’d walked from there.
A week after watching his apartment get demolished, Steve stood outside of the tall tower that was Stark Industries, fidgeting and wondering if he should go back to Sam’s place and pretend he’d never seen the on from Tony Stark himself.
“And we know you’re in school. We’d like to offer you a scholarship on our behalf. In addition we’ve taken the liberty of covering your mother’s hospital expenses from this moment forward.”
,” Tony rose his arm and waved it in the air to emphasize his obnoxious singing voice. Steve quickly grabbed it and put it down, effectively cutting off the horrid tune.
Steve’s eyebrows rose in genuine shock. “Really? Maybe we can ride together sometime.” He hadn’t meant to say that, but the words slipped out before he could stop them. And by the way Tony’s face lit up like he was a kid on his birthday made every regret Steve felt about the offer fade away.
With the door closed, Steve felt like he could breathe again.
Who would’ve thought the guy whose apartment he’d demolished would look like
“I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
Tony followed him. “Not technically,” he said, pointing a finger with the hand he held his glass in.
But he had, and Sam practically forced him out of his apartment so that he could make the meeting on time. And now he was here, with sweaty palms and a shirt that was a little too tight around the neck.
“Oh. Okay. The ex, right? Recent ex?” Tony asked while he finally took that bite, and then shoved the rest of the burger in his mouth because there wasn’t much left.
Tony shrugged his shoulder and nodded.
“Uh, yeah,” he straightened and turned to face his assistant once again, this time fiddling with his screwdriver. “Twenty-three, college kid, dying mom.”
Steve closed his eyes and shook his head, a pesky smile lingering on his lips. He found himself unwilling to say no, maybe unable to, so instead he said, “I don’t know, Tony.”
“Wow,” okay, he couldn’t hold it in anymore. He let out another breath, this one a bit more exasperated.
She didn’t look up and Steve grew increasingly uncomfortable with being blatantly ignored.
He cleared his throat, because if he stared at Steve like this for much longer he was bound to really drool on himself.
Steve took a bite of his own burger, and after swallowing and taking a sip of his cola, he explained, “I have… had a James too. He was my best friend, always had my back.”
Up the two flights of stairs, they made it to the apartment relatively quickly. Steve turned when they’d made it to the door, and fixed Tony with a bashful look. “I think it’s best if we part here,” he said, and Tony didn’t argue.
Tony nudged Steve with his shoulder and Steve nudged him back because, well… what else was he supposed to do? And maybe there was this fluttery feeling in his chest that was steadily forming the longer he spent time with Tony. But he would ignore it, because that feeling was decidedly dangerous.
He took a moment to do just that, letting out a few calming breaths before his anxiety got the best of him. A few seconds later and the car’s engine revved and his heart felt calm. As they moved off of the curb, he looked over at Tony who was staring back at him, completely unbothered.
to drink New York tap water?”
Pepper groaned and nearly stomped her foot in frustration, but she didn’t because she’s a big girl. “I don’t understand how you think,” she grumbled and Tony grinned at her. When she didn’t return the gestured, he sighed and held up his hands in defeat.
He was exactly not what Steve needed after his mom and Bucky and his apartment, even if he was…
Oh, boy. He nearly forgot.
“Oh,” He said, less upbeat than before. That didn’t happen too often. He usually had a short talk with Hill or one of the other front office workers before his detention was rescheduled.
