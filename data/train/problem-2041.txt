The path headed up to the center of the park where there was a fountain in the center of a pond. Benches around the edge of the circle were almost entirely empty, except one where a homeless person was tucked under a ratty looking sleeping bag and several unfolded newspapers. John sat a few benches over from him, but didn’t disturb the man. Everyone who could be ought to be asleep at this hour.
The little stand off with Mycroft came to mind, and John felt a surge of annoyance. John thought he was doing a remarkably good job at withholding his temper. He didn't even roll his eyes, and the sigh never made it past his lips, but he thought them.
“Paracetemol,” John replied, nonetheless shifting to let Sherlock’s long fingers curl around the length of his half-interested cock.
John was
“What do you mean?”
“We’re getting rid of that couch today,” John announced, putting an arm over his face.
"He gave me a choice, if that's what you mean."
Greg wished, desperately, that he’d paid more attention in that little training seminar about dealing with aggressive suspects. Not that he’d needed it on any of the perpetrators that he picked up, but there might have been something useful that he could use on Doctor Watson.
“Harriet?” John asked.
“Sherlock is needed for questioning,” the sergeant said. He frowned.
“Then the state of you when I came to inform you that John would be returning was-”
Also, Sherlock finds out that he is wrong about John’s condition in a very short time after this chapter. It may take pages and pages to get there, but it’s not far off in terms of a clock inside the story.
“Stamford,” the rounded man replied. “Mike Stamford?”
Greg couldn’t help but think that Sherlock’s response wasn’t the same as a denial.
who gave it a read through and had very wonderful corrections for me.
is required for appropriate thought processes,” Sherlock replied, sipping his tea.
John grit his teeth together against the memory of all the scrubbing, clenching his fists against a surge of renewed agitation.
"More than twelve, then."
Sherlock proceeded to make a meal out of John. John couldn’t find it in him to protest. He decided that so long as intercourse didn’t start equaling forgiveness, they were alright. There wasn’t much to do to stop Sherlock, anyway, and his mouth was not to be turned down lightly.
“I’d be angry with anyone who threw themselves away on drugs,” John said, the tension within him at odds with the relieved feeling of Sherlock’s approach. He delivered Mycroft the cup of tea, and wondered if he ought not have done that.
be enough. John would allow time for it to grow into more.
Neither of
Sherlock stepped forward as John shifted Harry’s weight from the tree to himself, and, almost like they’d discussed it, he helped John get Harry’s arm properly over his shoulders.
It could be the drugs. The aftermath of Sherlock’s habits was different every time, as though the wolf within him enjoyed figuring out new consequences to add to the rapid detoxification.
John finished unbuttoning his shirt, feeling his cock stiffen as Sherlock’s eyes raked the length of John again, slow and steady. John had never thought a look could be erotic before he’d mated Sherlock, but there it was, that one right there was just about pornographic. “I want to feel you on every inch of me,” John promised.
“Do you blame me, considering the state I found you in?”
“Why would they mix it with Luminol?”
It felt like something out of a fairy tale, honestly. The top of the hill was the one he had visited with Elisabeth before on his first visit, and now he thought of just how practical it was that they had such a large estate. John wondered if the other groups of the pack had the same amount of space.
John looked up at the roof of the plane, fighting the urge to be angry that Sherlock had just half-stripped him on a plane and given him a handjob just to get his brother to back off for the sake of a private conversation.
John opened his eyes, and found Sherlock staring into his. Their lips came together again, and John didn’t fight the building tension. He managed one more thrust before he spilled himself, head arching back.
So he stood in the corner by the window and watched the humans argue with John.
“Would you care to explain to me,
“That is all, for now,” Mycroft said.
sound like an excluded child? John felt the words like a knife in the gut. He fisted his hand in Sherlock’s coat and pulled him close, wrapping both arms around him. “How could you ever ask me that?” he said softly into the wool-clad shoulder.
Fingers touched his cheek.
what that meant.
John knew a way to get him up. “So that sergeant was a friend?”
It was impossible to tell if the growl in the room came from him or from Sherlock, by that point.
"You'll need to, ah... clean up first, please." She gestured to the small bathroom connected to the room. "And then, we're ready to get started. Dr. Haughermann is prepping the surgical room."
John replied.
In the end, John gave Sherlock the phone, and set to cleaning the blood off the couch. Though there was no food to speak of in the house other than what John had gotten on his last run to the shop, but there were a surprising number of chemicals. The meat tenderizer was a brand name he was unfamiliar with, but it was the right stuff, so despite telling Sherlock they’d bin the bloody thing, he set about cleaning up as he’d seen his mother do when he was younger.
John could feel the swirl of Sherlock vibrating through him, radiating out with the music. He went down the hall. Sherlock still hadn’t given him keys to the flat. The suspicious part of John’s brain, the part that knew he’d been dragged off by strangers hunting werewolves while he was in a warzone, was starting to suspect there was an ulterior motive to that, as John might be less likely to leave the flat if he couldn’t lock up, and unable to lock up without Sherlock would theoretically mean that he would be most likely to leave the flat with Sherlock… but that was a cracked line of reasoning if he’d ever tried one. Sherlock hadn’t bothered locking the door when John left. Opening the door intensified the sound and the feelings.
Well, that ripped up the story entirely. While John could imagine Sherlock and Mycroft being siblings, it was much harder to picture Sherlock in a pack of them. John decided not to focus on that for the moment.
Mycroft cast a glance at the two of them that still managed to look more concerned than the smug twitch of his mate's lips from where she spied them at his side.
His mate was through the door with no answer.
Even thinking about it sent a shock into the agony of his shoulder.
"That can be arranged," Sherlock rumbled, pulling John back against his chest with the arm around his waist.
John held back his grimace and retold the therapist what he had told Sergeant Hall. Any caution he’d felt before about maintaining active duty status for anyone involved was muted by the echoing space inside him.
path, because Sherlock was a fixed satellite, moving along just beside him.
There was Michael Timothy - a hard name if only because the man had two first names and the slim smile when he’d told John everyone called him ‘McTim’ was so drained of enthusiasm that John preferred not to think about it. McTim was one of the three that had taken the Colonel down on to John, along with Joshua Anson and Donald Crouch. The two men who had gone into the bunks so hard were in the hospital room that John had woken up in, as was the man who had taken that vicious right cross.
The conversation in the library faded. John was not the only one watching as the latecomers made their way in.
John could understand the urge, there were enough people that the conversation was almost smothering. He wanted to join Sherlock, but even though he was not very active in the conversation, every time he started to get up someone asked John a question and made it only polite to remain seated to give the answer.
“Good on you,” Greg said. “But he’ll probably get himself held overnight. Sherlock has a habit of mouthing off at inappropriate times at inappropriate people.”
John.
Couldn’t they backtrack a bit to the tearing off of clothes and the welcome-home arousal?
“You had not realized the number of days,” Sherlock said, speaking against his neck as nimble fingers undid the tie on John’s dressing gown.
A few steps further, Sherlock’s hand caught his.
Whenever John praised Sherlock, a curious expression crossed the man’s face. John had to wonder if anyone had ever praised him quite so openly before. A part of him was sad if no one had, another part pleased at the reaction he garnered from his husband.
There was an old rule: If Sherlock did not to reply to
“I stay with Sherlock.”
At that the therapist made a soft humming noise and took a note in his folder.
To top all that off, they contacted John's next of kin.
That was a bit odd, honestly.
Simple requirements are sometimes the most difficult to satisfy.
“ ‘Allowed’ implies some sort of agreement on terms.”
“In my experience, the Abbeys are preferable,” John said, closing his eyes.
Close, warm Sherlock seemed to have joined forces with the adrenaline crash and the combined might had knocked John asleep. In the wake of his lulled senses, John was disoriented. He struggled for a moment to place the events of the last few hours and sort out where it was that he - no, they were.
John groaned, and made to move.
“They don’t work,” Sherlock whispered in his ear, as though it were some greater confidence. “Not strong enough. My body burns it off faster than caffeine.”
None of them were at their best.
They all changed at different speeds, independent of age. It seemed to be rather based on the size of the wolf. Seemed to, because once it started, it was over too quickly to take them all at once.
“So the landlord hasn’t heard of you. What, exactly, are you doing there?”
“Provided he cares to look away,” Horatio said from behind his newspaper.
I am a horrible person for the cliffhanger, I know, but this is not the end of the entire story.
“Is he under arrest?” John asked.
“Christ, you don’t know, do you? You were gone, of course. I guess I just thought-”
John heaved a heavy sigh, unsurprised at the mangled remains of the kettle. It might just be the act of buying a kettle for their flat
tending to him now. He’d been empty for so long that he didn’t know how to feel the wonder at his mate’s touch. He wanted to
John opened his eyes again, hoping against hope that however long it took them to get on with it wouldn’t be too long.
In the ‘morning’ - John assumed that though he had not slept the amount of time that constituted a night, what time had passed was sufficient to make this a new day - he was taken from his little room before the morning hall roster for a physical.
“Sorry, I’m just a bit- well. We were out of paracetemol,” he groused. “And tea, and the bloody kettle is in
John is not amused.
As it turned out, Sherlock’s room was conveniently right where he’d left it on his last visit. Something about Sherlock seemed to relax as they passed into the privacy of his childhood room. Any talk of dinner quickly went the way of John’s too-new clothing, discarded in a pile on the floor. Then it was all hands touching, with fingers sliding and gripping. John barely noticed the room around them as they make it to the bed in a half-stumble. Sherlock was more interesting than the blue room around them, his lips pressing kisses more fascinating than anything the shelves and furniture could hope to offer to his untrained observations.
"You don't get to shout insults at me and demand I stay in the room with you," John retorted, glancing back at his mate.
The sensation of it was bewildering. What Sherlock usually felt of John, aside from the intense desire that was an undercurrent to his warmth, was a general solidity. John was like an anchor in a stormy sea, if one insisted upon utilizing poetic metaphor to describe the sensation. John
“I better hurry then.” That got a laugh out of both of them. “Dorothy Hawkins, you’re one in a million.”
“That’s a funny way of putting it,” Connie said. “What do you mean?”
Some things ought to be regulated, John thought privately, and told himself to put it on hold because somewhere in this over-sized house there was breakfast.
“Christ, they must have thought it was you.”
“To the Abigails?”
. It's been a very interesting ride for me as an author, because I've used it to help myself work on some process things. I wrote a draft of the whole story, the bones, and then fleshed it out as I edited it. (I believe it might have taken me twice as long otherwise, and it already took quite some time!) This has saved it from the problem that happened with
John stripped down to his vest for blood pressure tests, ran on a treadmill with machines monitoring his vitals, had his temperature taken. Then they had him take his vest off. His scarring was checked over - first the closing wound on his neck, and then he was asked to remove his vest so that the other wound could be looked at.
then there’s no reason to call you Captain, is there?”
"Mate for life," John said, tossing the towel onto the bed. Mycroft looked surprised. "Or did you mean that you lot are possessive? Stronger than I am? Faster than I am?"
The third day was spent entirely naked and/or sweating.
He could hear violin music from the hall, and set his shoulders as he headed down to their door. As he passed down the hall, one of the doors was ajar slightly. John frowned, shoulders going tense. The last thing they needed was something
his active mind corrected him. And it was not that John was without emotion to share. The opposite was true, when he opened himself to it, John had the most vibrant of feelings.
This was different.
“Tell me?” John asked.
Sherlock was questioned separately.
“I will,” John assured him when the tang of uncertainty from Sherlock made it seem that words might be needed in reply.
“Never failed us before,” John said. He couldn’t help the chuckle, especially when Sherlock huffed angrily at the notion. “Look, even without the rest of it, I keep thinking ‘what if he died’,” John admitted, reaching up to undo the third button of his shirt front. Sherlock’s eyes fell to it again, watching him, but calculatingly. “And I’ve seen…” John bit back what he wanted to say about the sand and the blood and all the things he couldn’t remember, and instead offered, “Let’s just say I’ve an active imagination. So. Why don’t you remind me that we’re both alive?”
“Sherlock.”
The orderly didn’t seem to notice the sincerity of his request. He just nodded sharply and exited the room, closing John in behind him as he went off to do his duty.
“It’s late, you shouldn’t-”
“Coffee?” Stamford asked.
“Let’s just talk about Sherlock, then, shall we? How does a jobless bloke like him afford Montague Street, anyway?”
“That’s brilliant.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John couldn’t even compare the way he felt tucked into the chair in the coffee shop to how he had felt on the train, and it was nothing like the fog of the previous days in Germany. The ache was fading, miraculously, and the clarity of his vision was starting to admit a bit of color. He looked out into the darkening street and lost himself in the colors that the sunset painted things. Here felt better, felt right. It felt like if he looked long enough he would find Sherlock somewhere out on the street, just waiting-
“I suppose he suits Marianne well enough,” Mycroft said, straightening upright and adjusting the fall of his coat. “But he wouldn’t last five minutes with Sherlock.”
"You will have to restrain yourself," Mycroft said softly to Sherlock. "Haughermann is-"
like…
There was a pause, somewhere downstairs, and then the relieved return turned into an annoyed rush up the stairs. At least the double-annoyance made the queasy feeling less intense.
I still have my Sym playlist up and running. I occasionally still add stuff to it. Keep in mind, not all of the songs are Johnlocky. There are a few songs which I consider very Sheriarty or Viclock and some which have nothing to do with John or Sherlock, but reminded me strongly of the vampires in this universe and their overall relationship with humanity.
Sherlock made a noise like he very much wanted to say ‘dear lord no’ but nodded. “I will be eventually. The taste of bad blood sticks to the tongue like tar.”
And then he came home.
"But this is the way to Baker Street."
They ducked swiftly into a jewelry shop. The kind of shop that sells diamond rings at twice the price of a house and half the weight. The kind of shop that celebrities find extravagant.
When John next opened his eyes, he was at one end of an empty hall.
That’s when Sherlock realized that he hadn’t noticed his absence at all. He’d spent the entire day miles away from home and no one even realized it. He could allow that his stand-in would’ve kept them from noticing while Mycroft held court maybe, but the entire day? Surely one of his tutors, his servants, Mrs. Hudson,
None of that mattered, just then. Sherlock couldn’t find it in him to care about it, even as a puzzle he had successfully solved. Where he had recorded those answers in his mind palace was empty, a blank room that was like a note written on white paper that was washed out in too much sunlight.
"I'm here," Sherlock said, voice so low it was almost inaudible. He didn't repeat the assurance, but the warm arm around his shoulders tightened, and warm breath puffed against his ear.
Down went the pipe-wielder.
In the boxy little room with its drab walls, the crushing feeling of failure radiating from the other invalided soldiers soaked from into him. Even their exercise time - something that had been instituted after the incident with the Colonel as a precaution - was bland.
She took a long drink from her cup and gathered her wits about her. “Sorry. Forget it,” she said, squeezing his hand again. “So, is that all of your stuff?”
His words cut off as John snapped his head back into the cheek turned towards him. It was enough to send garbage heap off-balance so that John could shove him aside. The second man with the pipe took a swing that John ducked. The swing followed through into garbage heap, and the blow struck the man in the head.
He wondered if he would ever understand Sherlock’s war on rest.
Sherlock turned, soothed by the proximity of his mate, but puzzled by it because his mood was still the heavy one that had descended the moment Milton collapsed.
"I know who Haughermann is," Sherlock retorted.
"I don't know," John growled. "It just... the longer we were apart, it hurt, alright? The tremor in my arm came back, everything went gray, I... I don't know."
“Caught that,” John said.
“One in a million and two, sergeant, now get going.”
"He's fiercely independent," Elisabeth said proudly. "It was a terror having the two of them in the house growing up."
tonight. “Who’s the on-call for it?”
“Mister Watson-”
There were things to be thought about the representation that had been made of him. Things like how Sherlock had written him rather romantic in his double escapes, only to be felled by the inevitable frailty of his body. (John didn’t think of himself as frail, thank you very much, but Mycroft did have a point about that second escape being rather improbable.) Things like how Sherlock assumed he would survive the worst of it all.
Provided Sherlock can manage to cease his interruptions--
Sherlock guided John into the bedroom.
“Obvious,” John replied, meeting his mate’s annoyed look. “But are you even trying?”
Sherlock turned to look at John, then back to Mycroft, and his eyes glinted. “Precisely the sort of self-important name one would expect from an organization that cannot even recognize two separate members of the same species in their presence.”
seem to turn up a lot.
Behind his mother, Sherlock stilled and looked up at him.
She had taken a photo of Doctor Watson’s bruising, and it looked ugly. “What’s this here?” Greg asked, pointing at some strange markings on the Doctor’s shoulder.
Well, he used both when he could be reminded of time passing. It threatened to blur together, getting harder and harder to distinguish.
The lighting in the hall was different from that in the interrogation room, and Dr. Watson blinked, bleary eyed, as he looked around. He certainly saw Greg where he was standing, but it was almost like he didn’t really see him. For a moment it appeared that Dr. Watson wasn’t sure what to make of his surroundings. He looked… lost somehow. It was strange to see the man look that way, especially after Greg’s first impression of him. Dr. Watson had seemed nothing but competent and in charge with the injured person in the flat. This Dr. Watson was a big change from that one. The impression lasted only a moment, and the second pass of his eyes around the station was more aware. He definitely saw Greg that time, but gave a bit of a huff instead of approaching. Instead, Dr. Watson tried to ask one of the officers in the hall a question, but got a gruff brush off. Then he seemed to sigh and turned and headed in Greg’s direction.
Connie tugged rather viciously on Sherlock’s sleeve, and her insistence drew even John’s attention to her. “You ought to just
Some tea,
John set his tea next to Sherlock’s on the desk. Before he could think more about it, he stepped over, moving up behind Sherlock, and took him by the hips.
“You seem to be caught up in this whole ‘mated’ thing,” John went on. “Yeah, some things are different, and I’ve no clue what all those things are, but no surge of oxytocin in my brain is going to make me lie to you about anything.”
overdosed.”
The receipt from the train purchase wasn’t in the outside pockets of Sherlock’s coat, so John had to search for the inside one.
bollocks,” John replied. “You do realize the chord on the kettle is cut in two?”
“Whatever. Don’t deduce it yet,” John said.
Sherlock demanded, using altogether too much emphasis for any single question. Somehow that worked for him, though John didn’t think he could get away with it.
Once the introductions were out of the way, they all settled down and got to catching up, and just like any large human family John had ever visited there were stories to tell back and forth and several children to settle down out of the way.
Then Sherlock started to talk.
Sherlock wasn’t even sure what it was. One minute he was languishing in his flat, focused on ignoring the dearth of John and the ache of being without him, and the next the ache was something harsher. It was raw, it was huge, it was a gaping chasm that Sherlock teetered on the edge of.
“Your mate is safely in the hands of the British Military.”
A rush of pain came, then, starting with a sharp stab that faded to an insistent ache.
For some reason, that was funny. John didn’t bother withholding his snicker as he got out of bed and scrambled into pants. After a moment of searching he found his dressing gown. He was all thumbs tying it off, but he headed into the sitting room at a quick trot, hoping to keep Sherlock from getting himself arrested for exposure. “Evening, Sergeant. Tea?”
John withheld his blush. Sherlock lacked the compulsion, preening slightly at the praise of their connection though his pride seemed to keep him from outright boasting about it.
“It happened
That man was not Sherlock Holmes.
"Don't let me interrupt the sibling rivalry," John said, fighting a yawn. Given the looks on their faces, John doubted he even could. It was ridiculouss that he was tired, they had done nothing but sleep for weeks. Well, sleep and have sex, but despite how athletic Sherlock could make that, it still wasn't the same as full body physical exertion. The closest they had come to that was the treadmill test, and Sherlock had taken the lion's share of that on himself.
“Is she an ‘Abigail’ or an ‘Abbey’?” John asked.
“Sherlock?”
Breathing a sigh of relief, he switched lines over to dispatch.
Honestly, this chapter sort of snuck up on me the other night. Originally the whole of this story was from John's perspective.
That conclusion was in line with Sherlock’s rudimentary understanding of his mate’s situation, but the deduction was hard to verify. How, Sherlock struggled to reason, did something so small - that cut from the mug,
take possession of the phones. Both of them. The one that was Harry’s that John had and the one that was Harry’s that she’d got in a store after giving up hers. Information flowed from his fingers that was undoubtedly helpful to the recipient - it could only be Clara, John surmised, as Sherlock would drop dead before
“Doctor Watson, would you like to go to the A&E?” Greg asked anyway, not about to start a precedent of letting Sherlock answer questions about Watson’s wishes any more than he expected Watson to answer Sherlock’s.
John snorted, and then looked down the hall. The man had a point, he was just largely irrelevant. What was relevant, the only thing that was relevant, was that Sherlock was playing all his frustration out on the violin.
“Right,” John said, “does it work the other way around, then? For humans, I mean? Sherlock said something about... genetic predisposition to...” John wondered if he was cracked for even thinking this when Sherlock’s expression shifted and John got a rush of something that
Sherlock’s hands tightened on his wrists and his lips took John’s firmly. It had been easy to coax Sherlock into kissing, and though it had not been his first instinct for showing affection, he had quickly taken to the act. John was happy to reciprocate, liking Sherlock’s possessive fervor. John could feel the same urge in himself. Once his wrists were released in favor of further touching, John reached out for his mate, getting his hand into the blatantly
like this. John adored him, actually. John felt connected, felt needed and wanted and so many other things because they poured out of Sherlock like the tall wolf had been waiting years for someone to be there to listen to what he felt. The idea that Sherlock might stop or… or
John was adaptable.
“What was the other reason you came to speak to me today?”
isn’t Mycroft most of the time.”
“Sherlock,” John said softly, eyes drifting shut, “who
Sherlock huffed in a large breath, puffing up to snap his next accusation. “What good-”
Harry found him by the exit they’d always met at when they were younger. She took one look at him and ushered them both out into the street.
Sherlock gave a little snort and closed his eyes. For a moment he seemed to be avoiding it. John could almost imagine the wolf that was Sherlock clinging to his agitation with all his claws, and then it slipped. The look on Sherlock’s face relaxed from the wrinkles of tension bunched around his eyes and mouth, and the pale face of his mate looked the way it had that fateful morning after when he’d asked if Sherlock wanted him.
Sergeant Hall gave him a small smile instead of a reply, and then nodded towards the stack of his clothes on the end of the cot. “Well, it obviously did you some good. Get dressed, and I’ll make sure there’s an orderly to take you back to your room.”
“What are you doing?” John demanded as the sergeant yanked the door open hard enough to rattle the hinges.
"It was unlikely that you'd be willing to speak freely in front of him, and this is as 'later' as I can contain myself to wait for," Sherlock said, nuzzling John's neck with his nose.
“I woke when the bunk pitched me onto the floor,” John said, honestly. “I think I stepped over someone when I went to help the others with the guy. I know he downed at least one more. Are they alright?”
“And I told you, Detective,” Dr. Watson replied, “yesterday afternoon I went for a walk. I met with an old friend, Mike Stamford, who works at Bart’s. He gave me a tour of the place, and then I went home.”
John slid his hand inside Sherlock’s dressing gown. His mate shifted to accommodate the gentle push, and John climbed onto Sherlock’s lap, because those were, possibly, the strangest words he’d ever heard spoken in devotion. They made no sense and yet they were correct, and John found himself shivering with desire at just the hearing of them. Nothing much about the way their relationship had begun was particularly romantic, at least not traditionally. That was fine, though. John wasn’t much for flowers and chocolate by candlelight, but those words were worth more than what could be packed into any of the cliches.
“Ahh, yes, of course, two hours after everyone else from your shift headed off home, and you’re still at work. Never mind the train receipts on the corner of your desk,” Sherlock said, stopping beside John’s chair with a hand out. “Come along, John.”
“Sherlock?”
Apparently the sergeant knew that tone as well.
The clocks all chimed the hour mutedly, as though even they were worn out by the full moon.
It kept them their privacy, at least.
John moaned, helpless with the pleasure of that touch. Once he got his voice back under his own control, he chuckled, "You seem continuously surprised by that. Like I'm something speci-"
That wasn’t precisely possessive behavior, but it was… something. Showing off, perhaps. Well, the sergeant had initially considered John a hired personal physician, and that was right off the list after this little display.
“Not really, no. I mean, you’re here, so I probably don’t need to worry about warning
Sherlock frowned inside, the nervousness from the previous evening gnawing at the bottom of his left lung like a parasite trying to-
“I only make you repeat things when you’re being absurd.”
It was only a little while later that he heard the rushing footsteps of his mate making his way into the alley to find him.
“What do you mean, ‘tomorrow?’” Lestrade asked.
After a full two minutes of glaring while Milton bled on their sofa, Sherlock muttered, “Kitchen, left cabinet.”
Two clear blue eyes glared at John in angry accusation, thick brows drawn together almost menacingly. The man in the bunk had an almost sinister appearance that was far too vibrant for the washed out room they were in. He seemed alive, but vicious.
“You’re not,” Sherlock said.
“Who is that?” the woman on the phone asked.
“I guess now you’re a sergeant, you can keep me hanging when I’m doing you a favor.”
It had been an introduction he had been eager to make, two people he wanted to know one another so both would understand their importance to him.
of feeling brought Sherlock down.
The qualification did not sit well with Sherlock. It tainted the contented feeling, and nagged at Sherlock. Neither part of him was pleased about was John's reticence to speak.
The rumbling sound hadn’t been thunder, it hadn’t been part of the dream at all.
“You sound surprised.”
“Morning,” Mycroft ventured.
Time passed sluggishly, two days of listening to the soft groans of the wounded, of familiar speech that took John right back to where he'd been when he'd been in that military hospital in Kandahar. None of the talkers - McTim, Anson, or Crouch - had much to say beyond general personal information. John listened to how they had gotten there, but only with half of his mind. He didn’t offer anything back. He didn’t know what to say.
Harry stared at her drink, her shoulders shaking.
John leaned against the wall of the elevator, too tired to argue. “Groceries,” he said. “And a kettle.”
Resisting the urge to tense, John continued the gentle scrubbing he was doing to the cushion. “How do you figure?”
And then the weight was gone.
A face swam into focus. He wanted that to be Sherlock. He wanted the utterly inappropriate reaction to his injury to be nosing and licking at it, and he shut his eyes again as the Sergeant grasped him by the elbow and urged him to his feet. His balance was off, but he followed along into another corridor. Where he was lead he could hear some low talking, and then the grip on his elbow urged him onto a flat surface.
She seemed shocked. “You mean Mycroft hasn’t given you the ‘humble civil servant’ routine?”
Unlike Sherlock, John was far more reserved with ‘sharing’, as his mother had put it when he had asked privately, his emotions.
John chuckled and gave Sherlock’s waist another squeeze. Sherlock shifted, taking bow and violin in the same hand, and covered John’s arms with long fingers. They stood in silence for a moment, John holding on and Sherlock anchoring his arms. John buried his face against Sherlock’s back, pleased at the warm feeling of his mate and the loosening muscles that signaled a lessening of the earlier agitation. He was still mad, they still had things to talk about, but Sherlock went so far off the deep end-
“Well I didn’t stop to ask for names,” Dr. Watson said, “at the time I thought I’d just go back to the flat and see about it.”
That was good. It calmed something dangerously anxious that had been rattling around in the cage of John’s chest.
John didn’t even need to close his eyes and focus on it. The words tumbled out of his mouth as though he’d been ordered. “Turned on.”
Through the bedroom door, he heard the front door open, and Sergeant Lestrade’s cut off greeting of, “Evening, Hol-
Each of the stories poked at John like a jab to a bruise. Each of these people - wolves?
Shifting to put his nose into John's hair, Sherlock glanced at his brother. "Even you haven't forgotten that Dresden was part of East Germany."
Sherlock perched in the arm chair, curled over the phone.
His mate stiffened, but barely paused his playing.
Sherlock turned his attention hastily back to the pavement, bending further in the manner of some figure that Greg had only ever seen in origami to reach under the dumpster without laying on the stained tarmac of the alley. When he unfolded it appeared that Sherlock had fished out a scratched mobile.
“Oh. And you may want to pick up the two assailants again. Charge them with attempted assault, if you need to. I’ve the rips in my clothes to prove it.”
None of the trying worked, though. The attempts colored his nightmares, but the real memory hovered just out of reach, leaving him with only dark figures and the flash of wicked teeth. On good days, surely, he would wake knowing he was fine, but on bad days - and just now they were all bad, all empty and lonely - John woke with the feeling of teeth sinking into him.
“It was a crime, John,” Sherlock replied, growing impatient. “One that had apparently started as a robbery and escalated. There had been robberies in the area at the time, and I was there long enough to overhear that the method of entry was the same, but something had changed about the robbers, because they’d put an end to the middle-aged man they’d smeared across the walls.”
“Trust me,” Sherlock replied, lifting his other hand to stroke John’s hair from his temple.
like he'd lost a part of his mind.
Here he was on Montague Street when he ought to be headed home to the wife.
“Well there’s a spot of trouble over on Montague Street with his name on it. Not in your usual haunts, of course, but you did ask.”
“Eleven days since you saw her, though she called yesterday morning.”
came over him, and John couldn’t think of anything but Sherlock.
It turned out that Horatio was an engineer. His wife Anne, John was told, was in education. They lived in Swindon, and Horatio was pleased to report that though Sherlock had never done particularly “well” with university - a fact offered complete with quotation marks, a fact that Sherlock snorted about, and made John curious - he was often a house guest when he felt the need to make use of his old oath on Broad Street. It only took John a few moments of puzzling before Sherlock muttered something about antiquated policies of pompous establishments purporting to teach. Then Horatio, who had cottoned on to John’s confusion, said that it was the Bodleian that Sherlock really liked to visit. John found himself quite amused to think of Sherlock making the trek from London to Swindon just to go to the library.
The night had been terrible, again. After the meal and three chapters of the out-of-date novel he’d selected from the meager pickings the orderly had wheeled down the hall for him, John was left with nothing to do. He was confined to the room pending the results of his blood work, and the four windowless walls weren’t much in the way of company.
Mycroft’s tone was soft instead of condescending or accusatory. John blinked back the memories and nodded, feeling that wrong sensation grow within him, like an itch left unscratched. There was nothing for it, though, no cure that could be had. John wondered what Sherlock was doing, and then forced his thoughts away from the dark haired man before they could stir too deeply.
"Georgiana?" Horatio said.
he wasn’t broadcasting what he felt about it. Rather than interrupt the call further, John pulled out of his grip and rose, heading into the sitting room.
“They'll be talking about you," Sherlock murmured against his spine before licking a stripe up it. Clever fingers were busy elsewhere, pushing in and slipping back out in time with his words.
Though sporadically affectionate and sometimes passionate, John’s brilliant husband was stronger against the pull of desire than John himself had proven to be. And he was making a very obvious effort at being considerate. Of course Sherlock would do nothing like ignore what John had asked for just to be held in front of the bookcase. John still wondered how this would all work, with only the one of them tending towards affection. He chastised himself for the morose thought. They had not been married a month, and they got on quite well together, didn’t they? That could be enough while they figured out the rest.
Sherlock glared furiously at Mycroft, the sort of look that most often preceded shredded clothes and a rougher-than-playing tumble for the two of them. There had been times, times when they were younger, when nothing less than fangs could settle the air between them, when only first blood was enough.
When Sherlock tore out every rose in the garden.
He was still standing on the curb when two strong, familiar hands caught his shoulders.
John’s skin was crawling, just enough to set him on edge. He resisted the urge to pace or to fidget because he knew that would make him look guilty, and he wasn’t guilty, he didn’t even know bloody Milton.
was not the correct word, exactly. Satisfied? That was closer, certainly, and while it was imprecise, it would do for now, as the true importance lay in John. Sherlock was
“We will figure it out,” Elisabeth said firmly to her son. Her eyes found John as he swayed, and she frowned. “John?”
John made it to the front door, but he only got it a few inches open before it was slammed shut by a long-fingered hand. John squared his shoulders and set his jaw. "Let go of the door, Sherlock."
John woke up, naked, to one of Sherlock’s one-sided monologues.
John stroked his hands against Sherlock’s chest, feeling the warmth of skin and the smoothness of silk, and he nodded. “It was awful.”
“Why don’t you go set up your lab, then?” John asked, feeling a smile tug at the corners of his lips. “You’re lusting after it.”
No, that was untrue. Sherlock knew himself capable of many things - many more things where John was concerned - but platitudes and the like were something he was unlikely to come up with when concocting a plan.
"Job interview, actually. At the nearby clinic." He straightened his best shirt and checked his hair in the mirror. Both were about the same as they ever were which suited him just as well as it ever had.
Sherlock leaned in close to whisper “No, I just need a cover while I test a theory.” And stuck the bloodied end of a test swab in his mouth.
Sherlock flapped his hand dismissively in John’s general direction. “It was child’s play.”
John ignored him, instead pecking out some bland little lies letter by letter onto his keyboard. God, it’d be quicker if he’d chosen to write out the blog entry by hand one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-five times, tied it to the feet of one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-five pigeons and flew them out to his readers. Although it would’ve been a tad embarrassing when ten of those pigeons circled back around to their front door. Eleven, actually. Mrs. Hudson reads the blog too.
A hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbing his shoulder. There was the smell of chloroform and then there was nothing.
“Yes, yes. Very funny, little brother.” Mycroft hauled himself up with all the haste of a glacier. “Well, this was lovely, boys. But I’m afraid I must be making my departure.”
It was ridiculous. Stupid. There was too much furniture around. They could get hurt. His leg’s been stiff recently, he shouldn’t risk it especially when he has to work tomorrow. It would be just mad to start a fighting match in the living room for kicks and the worst part was Sherlock was taking off his shirt so he could not possibly say no.
“That is a very good question, Sherlock.”
And he was having such a good day.
Sherlock smirked as John swung into a half-decent Chinese restaurant. They took a seat by a window and sipped at cool glasses of water while they watched the quaint people of the quaint town trickle by.
John grumbled, as grumpy as he had been since he got up. Although, the vampire couldn’t blame him. The dungeon was rather cold for a human’s delicate sensibilities, the silence was rather infuriating and the place smelled awfully moldy. There was quite a lot for him to be grumpy about. “Time we should be using to Get Out.”
"Sleep well?" Sherlock asked as John picked up his morning cup of tea from the kitchen table, where it sat every morning. The vampire was dressed in the same suit he wore yesterday. He still smelled faintly of italian restuarant and blood. A violin perched on his shoulder like he was born with it. He looked fresh as a daisy in a detergent commercial and John hated it.
John watched as the vampire’s face scrunched like he’d just bit into a rotten lemon. “Enjoying yourself?”
"No, that sound back there. The one the kids were making.” The one that was still ringing through his head like the lingering burn of vomit.
John searched his mind. “That you really can’t keep stealing my socks?”
"We don't even have beans and toast anymore. Just stale crackers and formaldehyde." John hissed after the client awkwardly shuffled back to the sofa. "You might be able to survive on bodily fluids and unpaid debts, but the rest of need a bit more cash."
John scoffed. “Could you at least tell me what’s wrong?”
By the time he collapsed into his bed, he distantly hoped that he wouldn't ever wake up. Because he knew that when he did, he would be so sore and the wound that he hadn't the energy to treat would probably be infected.

"That's the thing about Vampires. They've got wisdom and power and beauty spanning the centuries, but with it comes an awkward adolescent phase several generations long." She chuckled in that light, airy way of hers that instantly eliminated any trace of weight which could've been in her words. John never really paid much attention to Mrs. Hudson. She had always been the nice old lady who seemed exactly like the grandmother everyone is convinced everyone else has. But now he found himself wondering exactly how she got herself caught up in this mess.
“That. Is. Fascinating. Isn’t it, John?” Sherlock said entirely truthfully. He only mentioned the cat rumor thirty minutes ago to a man on the other side of town.
John ground his teeth as he watched Sherlock, sopping wet and wearing nothing more than a towel, stare blearily into the middle distance. He rolled his sleeve back down. He wasn’t used to this. He hadn’t been so lost on what to do with an injured person since before medical school. Even as a child, he knew how to deal with most seasonal illness and whatever scrapes and bruises his father could throw at him. “Why would he do this to himself? Why would he let it go so far, if he knew this was going to happen?”
“Is that skull real?” He attempted to make it sound casual. Just a passing curiosity. But he knew at this point he had a better chance at making his bacon regenerate into a living pig and fly out the window.
Sherlock pulled himself to his feet, wiping some of the dew off his ass. “Oh, I’m terribly sorry. I had no idea you owned the flowers. Oh, am I also breathing too much of your air? Am I intruding under your patch of sky as well?”
“Then maybe you should’ve tried more… traditional methods.” John suggested with a pointed smirk. Sherlock only rolled his eyes in response.
“John.” Sherlock said to himself as he spurred his Helios into a gallop, testing the word on his tongue. “Well that’s not terribly magical at all.”
“Shut up.” He growled with definitive finality. “You can just shut up right now, because I’m not listening. I’m not selling off you’re clothing. I’m not leaving. And you’re not dying. I’m not going to let you. Do you hear me? I won’t listen to another word of your damn theatrics. So you have two options. Tell me how to help you, or sulk like a fucking child. What will it be?”
“Bought tea yesterday, actually. But I rather figured you’d tell me they’d binned that along with everything else.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The second thing John noticed was that Sherlock didn't seem to have any trace of a gag reflex. He tried not to dwell on this too much.
“How cute.” It was a rather meticulous painting of Sherlock about two centuries younger dead asleep titled ‘Ye Darke and Mysterious Vampyre’. There wasn’t anything mysterious about the cloud of rumpled curls floating over his head, the small lake of pinkish drool collecting on his pillow or the matching warm flush of his cheeks. “You look so young!”
John was about to peck out some quip about plotting the murder of his flatmate when the door burst open. Lestrade rushed in like blessed rain after a drought.
"Sherlock, please."
“So be it. Anthea.” A woman slipped silently out of the door nearest to him. She moved with a quiet grace. Like a shark, drifting silently through the depths of the ocean.
He nudged Sherlock’s shoulder, not expecting a reaction but unsure of where exactly to start. As he expected, nothing happened. He pressed a finger to the vampire’s neck to measure his pulse and proceeded to swallow a panic attack when he found it to be roughly 10 beats per minute.
“Time?” John chuckled, picking at his possibly expired orange chicken.
“Not sure. Do humans consider 1:15 to be morning? I’ve always wondered.” Sherlock replied as he kept a careful eye on the eggs. “Also, do you like your eggs runny?”
"She seems to have bled to death. None of the wounds are very deep, so it would've taken awhile. These marks left by the fishing line looks like she struggled while she was being tied up, so she was conscious for at least the beginning. But she didn't fight very hard, or the cuts would have been messier... The killer must have had some way to incapacitate her." The horror of knowing that his young woman was probably awake and aware for every cut and slice didn't hit him the way he expected. Mostly, it just seeped into his subconscious and waited for a more convenient time to make itself known.
"Well... maybe relaxing isn't quite the right word." Sherlock conceded.
“Sherlock! My favorite customer!” He said with all the sincerity of a Shakespearean actor. He glanced at John with a strange expression of surprised amusement that put him mildly off balance. “How have you been? It’s been too long since I’ve seen you last.”
John took it, watching with fascination as the dim light of the lamp dripped off the edge. "You just asked me to cut myself while under the influence of... something. You do realize this is absolutely mad, right?"
Sherlock took a deep breath, gradually releasing the padlock of deeply rusted iron wrapped tight around his throat. He took another, letting sound and feeling trickle through like sputtering brown water from old pipes, gradually getting clearer. He thought of all the years he’d left behind. All of the familiar names lost to disease, injury and time. And all of the vaguely familiar faces he’d never bothered to put names to for simplicity’s sake. He thought of all the half-lived lifetimes he’d survived through, just drifting by on the razors edge of a dead name and a line of cocaine.
“I was born.” Sherlock answered, fairly confident in his answer. “How else would one become a vampire?”
“I don’t care if you go out starkers! I don’t have time for this. They don’t have time-.”
"Do what?" Sherlock asked, glancing down at himself in baffled confusion. "Wear coats?"
“Try it.” Sherlock mumbled against John’s chest. “I dare you.”
“But you still have to get permission to cross the threshold of a dwelling in which a vampire resides from the owner of the dwelling and Mrs. Hudson has been out for the past week.”
Sherlock considered the question, as a shakespearean actor would consider the words 'to be or not to be'. Mycroft prepared himself for a truly historic eye-roll. "...Probably not."
"Fine." Lestrade conceded, stepping out of the way. "But if you're wrong and one of them dies I'll-... you'll never feel my warmth again."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh.” Lestrade glanced at the darkened windows with surprise. “So it is. Funny how that happens.”
“They’re vampires. What does that mean? Where they… targeted or something?” John asked as Lestrade handed over a file.
And in another room, a maid of the Miyamoto household awoke from a drugged sleep on a bed encrusted with rose petals and felt a cold dread creep up her spine as she realized something was very wrong.
“John. Watson.” A shadowy figure at the other end called out in precise, measured syllables, like a nurse calling you up for your examination. Or a demon in the waiting room of hell, calling you up for judgement.
“Well, I’m hardly going to run about london in my dressing gown, am I?” He retorted over his shoulder.
"John." He said, his hands snapping to his sides. There was a buzzing silence as Sherlock tried to find the answers to the hundreds of questions John was undoubtedly about to ask. "Uh- this is my brother, Mycroft.
“No.” The golden man said seriously, his features solidifying into something hard and immovable. “You can’t be here after dark. Go, now.”
"The praise. You praised her work so she'd follow us."
“Playing hooky. That’s what people these days do, right?” He asked softly, almost dreamily. “We spent too long away from home. It’s good to just… be.”
“Sher-“ John gritted his teeth, resisting the urge to slap his flat mate.
“So… how long have you been a vampire?” John asked the first thing that came to mind. It wasn’t exactly the best choice for an attempt to act normal. But it was something.
John nodded, standing from his armchair to make himself a proper cup of tea. “Well, now that we’ve established that I will continue babysitting for you, are we finished? I can practically feel Sherlock making faces at you through the wall.”
“You'll be ok, someone's on their way right now.” John, deciding to play along with Sherlock's delusion, put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “You’ll make it through this.”
“That doesn’t mean what you think it means.” Sherlock mumbled, turning bright red anyways. “And don’t take it personally, she sends a letter like that to literally everyone I spend more than ten seconds talking to. Molly’s had a poem.”
John rolled his eyes audibly as he ducked back into the ground. “Just, give me a second. I’ll build one.”
"Yes he is. Tell him it’s Sherlock Holmes. I’ll be waiting.” The vampire stated definitively, leaving no room for further questions.
Lestrade was gawped, still panting from running up the stairs. “Where are you going?”
"Can you hear that in the background?" Sherlock cupped his hand around the speaker to amplify it and replayed the segment. "It's constant throughout all the videos, but it's most detectable in the pause between sentences right.... here."
“Sherlock.” John started. “What are you doing.”
Sometimes, you don’t need someone to pull you into the light but to step into the darkness with you.
Pain vibrated through his very bones. Old pain. The kind of pain that would sell for thousands these days, if only he’d had the foresight to keep a journal on the nightstand by his death bed. It traveled in waves, like the unassuming start of a tsunami. The symptoms of a shift in very structure of the earth.
“Yes. I asked for one bed because we’ll only need one bed.” Sherlock said with false sugar in his voice, as though explaining the matter to a child.
They walked out and down an unfamiliar street. At first, John thought it was a shortcut to baker street. But as they wandered further into increasingly more secluded and desolate areas, the more obvious it became that Sherlock had something else planned.
Sherlock didn't answer, only smiled approvingly at how quickly he caught on. "She'll need some time to change her clothes and google the address. I estimate... oh half an hour?"
John knew the answer was obvious, but he stated it anyways. Just to make it real. “A girlfriend.”
Sherlock hadn't meant to actually kiss him. The preliminary transfer of saliva to facilitate feeding may be mechanically similar to a kiss, but could never really be mistaken for one. But John started it. And once he initiated the kissing it was impossible not to reciprocate. God, he kissed like he meant it. He kissed thoroughly, with determination. As though he had every intention of twisting Sherlock in a knot like a cherry stem. And it was working. Holy hell, was it working.
John waggled his head in agreement, groaning as another flood of mild euphoria washed through his system. “Is it always like this?”
"Sore." He mumbled into his mug. After a seconds consideration, he re-thought the question. Shouldn't it be a little more than sore? He raised his arm to take a look at it. There was still a slash on his forearm. Not terribly deep, but at least five inches long. John didn’t have much of a chance to look at it the night before, but he was sure it hadn’t healed half-way on it’s own in the last 12 hours. He vaguely remembered the feel of something wet and cold. “Fine, actually. Did you… do something to it? While I was asleep?”
John woke up to the sound of violin music seeping up through the floor, thick and raw like honey right off the comb. He moved to haul himself out of bed and immediately regretted it. His muscles felt like rubber bands all stretched to their limits over a bonfire. The early morning light bypassed his eyeballs entirely and burn straight through the back of his skull. It felt like his second day of bootcamp all over again, except this time around he was trapped in the body of a useless, broken old man.
“Yes, if you’d just listen!” He hissed, baring his teeth with irritation.
Sherlock hummed his approval. Then, after a half second's pause, tipped the vial back over his mouth to shake out the last few drops. When it was clear there was nothing left, he began licking the rim of the receptacle for whatever traces were left over. Even Molly seemed to be shocked.
“Because, if you comply, you’ll find the rewards rather... generous.” The smile was back. John was suspicious that this ‘reward’ would end up being something like ‘the continued use of all your limbs’. “And if you don’t, I’m sure you’ll come to regret the consequences.”
“Did you feel anything?” Sherlock asked as he turned the appendage over in his hands. It was warm, but pleasantly so. The skin underneath the strange barrier was completely unmarred, the firm structure of muscle and bone underneath it was still perfect in every way.
Sherlock shuffled around, pulling half the blankets off of John in the process, until his legs were stretched straight out in front of him. “Is that better?”
Sherlock grimaced at the wording of the question, as if the word 'date' physically injured him. "Dating is for mortals. I would never bother with anything so... frivolous."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and ran to his horse. As he swung into the saddle and prompted the tired old thing to a trot, he shouted over his shoulder, “Wait! I never got your name!”
Sherlock watched from the armchair by the window as John writhed in his sleep, brow gleaming with sweat. He muttered and grunted half-words to whatever shades haunted his unconscious mind, lashing out helplessly against the thick darkness. Sherlock knew the ‘proper’ thing to do would be to look away, pretend not to notice and let John work out his own demons. It should be an easy choice. He’d been making it since John moved in. The choice to keep quiet, preserve the man’s dignity but nudge him in the right direction from the shadows.
“Atropa Belladonna. Beautiful death.” Sherlock muttered to himself as he pulled on his gloves, carefully plucking a few flowers and leaves and pressing them between the pages. “Surprisingly enough, a close cousin to the common potato.”
As soon as Sherlock’s gaze left Watson’s, the man seemed to lose the strength in his spine, folding down over his knees silently.
For a moment, the door to the furnace of his temper threatened to burst open, but John managed to keep it shut. “First, it’s not judgment, Sherlock. Second, I’m allowed to be upset when I… do you even know what those sorts of drugs do to you?”
While the tea steeped, John looked for clean plates. The only ones he could see were at the bottom of the mess in the sink, and there was something that appeared to have solidified on the surface of them.
"Even you must admit it was rather sloppy," Mycroft added, ignoring Sherlock's snide comment.
“It will save you the time in checking our alibis.”
Someone was at one of the doors, banging on it and shouting against the crack to get word out into the hall. If anyone else was speaking, John couldn’t hear them. There was only the grunting of men trading blows.
“... It seems better than just sitting around, yeah. Why, have you got a better idea?”
Sorry this chapter took so long. It was just a hard chapter for me and I've had a lot of work lately, so I haven't really had time. I might still go back and do some touch ups later, I'd just really like to get something posted today.
“Every weekend?” Sherlock asked, seemingly out of polite concern. “That must be such a nuisance.”
“The little idiot keeps finding ways to slip out. Worries me half to death, especially with those strange rituals and things going on.” John’s attention perked slightly at the mention of the subject of their current investigation. Sherlock continued to maintain an appearance of making idle conversation. “Every weekend, I have to lock poor spot away in his cage, it’s the only way to keep him from getting out.”
"It is," replied Sherlock suddenly gasping and frantic. "This case just got 30% more complicated." Usually, Sherlock would be delighted at that fact. Positively, disgustingly glowing. But this time it seemed to terrify him.
He rustled through his bag for a clean set of underwear and a shirt that didn’t smell too bad and headed to the bathroom to change, rigidly ignoring Sherlock’s impatient fidgeting as he did so.
The golden man scoffed, the hard line of his mouth twisting into a cruel smirk. “Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Yes, I do own the flowers. I planted- ok, well I didn’t plant them. -but I’m the one who cares for them. I water them in the hot seasons, I shelter them in the cold, I do the weeding and the fertilizing and last spring the bees were particularly lazy so I had to pollinate them.” His emotions flashed across his face in rapid succession. Sherlock wished briefly that he could slow time to a crawl to give him the chance to study them more closely. Then they came to a halt at confused bafflement. “What do you even want deadly nightshade for, anyways?”
“Well that went well.” John smirked, trailing behind the detective as he swept stormily down the street.
And see the sights they did. They visited pretty much every well-travelled nature trail through the country side and well-loved local business, chatting with the friendly locals and learning about the inane local gossip. All their experiences were lovely and filled with small town charm and boring as all hell.
"Shit," The writer muttered to herself. There was nothing left to write. No words that had yet been unspoken. No ideas that hadn't been thoroughly used and abused and tossed aside like a sticky condom. It was as if the universe had run out of ideas. As if life itself had run dry.
"A bit, yeah."
Then a thought passed through his head. Just a whim, really. He wondered how much it would take to wake Sherlock. So, without really thinking, John pressed the flat of the cold blade against Sherlock’s neck.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mrs. Hudson's been kicking up a fuss because you don't have rent." John said pointedly, shocked that he didn’t see the financial state they were in as dire. When he first moved in, he was given the impression that Sherlock had exactly the sort of inexhaustible wealth one might expect from an immortal being of myth. But as the months went on, it became more and more apparent that his monetary wealth comes and goes with all the predictability of the average tornado.
Sherlock snorted, finding the idea absurd. “Do you really underestimate my ability to defend myself so much? The fittest of them had skin of paper and shaky hands.”
The trail ended in a stretch of forest that looked like all of the rest he’d passed through. Although he couldn’t help but note that, whether due to the setting of the sun or his own excitement of having found it, the place seemed to have a glow about it. He swung out of his saddle in one swift movement, noting how the thick grass seemed to welcome the presence of his boots. He grinned without really knowing why and reached into his saddlebag for an apple to feed his horse.
Luckily, Sherlock was already waiting at the end of the alley. At the first sight of his unmistakable silhouette, she stopped and ran back towards John, apparently assuming that the smaller man would be easier to get past than the towering, imposing caricature of a man that was Sherlock Holmes. She was probably right, to an extent.
“What?” Lestrade asked, though they thought it in unison.
Mycroft occupied the leather armchair by the fireplace like a massive military force occupies a country. With determination and sheer force. It was a rather unsettling sight, not only because his substantial amount of… substance didn’t quite fit into it, but also because Sherlock had marked that chair to be his in every possible way aside from pissing on it. Seeing Mycroft in it was just… wrong.
Sherlock looked back to his reflection, jumping slightly as he realized John was right. “Ah! Yes. Don’t want to forget those.”
Read the note in neat, looping handwriting.
“Yeah.” John growled, his throat too rough and dry for anything else. He resisted the urge to just shove his mouth under the tap and poured himself a glass of water. A rather troubling thought occurred to him. By his nigh-impeccable sense of time, it should be late evening and Sherlock was making breakfast. “It’s not morning, is it?”
So John decided to give Sherlock the benefit of the doubt on his sibling relationship.
"Don't mind him, John. Charles is used to being everybody's favorite," Sherlock said.
“You keep checking your watch,” John said. “Do you need to go?”
“Three meters,” John replied. “You twitch and turn to look for me if I’m farther than that away from you.”
“Stop that,” John said gently. “It’s not nearly so dire.”
Across the table, Sherlock was having his ear all but talked off by a suddenly loquacious Connie. Every time he tried to turn his attention anywhere else, she grabbed his sleeve and gave a vicious tug.
“Routinely. More often when the person I’m talking to refuses to do it.” The sergeant folded his arms and frowned. “I meant what I said, Sherlock. I don’t care if your brother is the bloody Queen herself, if any of this has to do with any combination of you and an illegal substance in the present tense, I will haul you to jail for it. They can sort you right into rehab, and then I’ll wash my hands of this.”
Doing a head-count based on Sherlock’s information, John thought that there were only a few absent persons. He was pleased to be done with the majority of the handshaking and sniffing that had to be gotten on with. Aldrich… whatever his last name was, and his mate, and Sherlock’s father. John couldn't quite think of a polite way to ask after them. The stories were more being told to him more than it was a conversation of any sort.
“I really don’t need that much sleep,” Sherlock protested.
Sherlock led the way around the buildings and back into the little alley, coat flapping with the agitated speed of his movements. John’s mate sniffed at the alleyway from one end to the other. There was what looked like dried blood all over the place, but some of it was faded, and John wondered if he’d missed a storm in the last few days. He certainly hadn’t been paying much attention to the weather.
Greg pressed his lips together. He had a strong stomach, but that scene had managed to unsettle him. He wouldn’t dwell on it now. “You seem to be trying to keep Sherlock from getting arrested.”
He must, he thought, be quite a sight. Sherlock wasn’t winded, but his chest was heaving for breath as he came into the alley at only a bit less than a dead sprint, demanding loudly, “John!”
“Yup.”
Because all of the siblings had stories to tell.
the tea growing cold in his hand. To illustrate this to anyone observing, he ignored the look and set his tea aside.
“I figured it’s safer to wait. If Sherlock’s due back anywhere, it’s here.”
Minutes passed, minutes that seemed to stretch on and on. Greg shifted from foot to foot, looking away from the pair of them only to turn back, concerned about the blood that would be coming from Dr. Watson’s hand. That was when he noticed that Sherlock’s pants hadn’t just snagged, the shards of the mug had managed to cut his knees.
urge, not the sort that Sherlock was used to feeling from his wilder side, but, once that solution was presented, it was not hard to conclude that some things with John would only happen in time, and the only cure to
Looking over, he found Sherlock was staring at him. Reaching further, there was the familiar sensation of desire, but there was something sweeter about it.
John could feel Sherlock’s eyes following him as he paced in a loop the four steps to the far side of the kitchen and back. He could feel Sherlock’s concern warring with his own agitation on the subject, but rather than let it seep into him, John pushed it away. He had figured that much out just yesterday, and he thanked whatever lucky star had gotten him this far for the aptitude with it. He focused, instead, on Milton-the-dealer, checking to make sure that there wasn’t a more serious injury. Because-
The attention was slightly intoxicating. He reached up and tugged another button open, just to see Sherlock’s eyes follow his fingers and to feel the rush of want it caused.
Eventually sleep stole him from consciousness, but unlike the first night with its comforting whirl of images of Sherlock, that night John’s sleep was filled with dreams of being lost in a dark, endless expanse. It was a place far too empty to be London or anywhere but the desert that John’s nightmares often dragged him back to. He was trapped. No. He was lost... no. He was abandoned there.
“I take it they hadn’t.”
Sherlock took John's hand as the sibling snarking between the two wolves tapered off, and then the plane started to angle down for landing.
“It’s unlikely to be spiked,” Sherlock quipped at her. “John wouldn’t compromise your position.”
“Earlier,” John clarified softly, “we had neither of us slept, and I had not eaten.”
“What do you mean?” John asked, getting up and crossing to join him at the window.
“Breathe, John.”
and more to do with the
They stared at each other for a moment. Mike frowned. “Are you still-”
“Do you think you can remember it?”
"More than that, John," Elisabeth said, patting his arm as though she knew what he was thinking, "they need to know your scent. You're part of us now, and we look after our own."
Sherlock cocked his head curiously, narrowing his eyes slightly.
The grating noise happened again.
The walk was brisk, and John’s stomach complained at him, but rather than stop at a shop for groceries he went straight back to the flat.
, not the least of those were his former ‘bad habits’. The lack of John was the sort of thing that might tip Sherlock right back into that behavior.
Then Sherlock’s warm weight was gone from his lap, and John was left to huff out, “Told you to leave them.”
with Sherlock. And this was Sherlock’s place - their place, and it should feel just as safe as his mate did. But here in a place that was supposed to be safe, he felt like he was back in captivity.
“No, don’t,” John said, elbowing Sherlock to shut him up. “It’s unrelated. I haven’t seen Harry in… it’s been-”
“Come to bed.”
The implication in those words made John so angry he felt sick. He started to turn to reply to it, but Sherlock was quicker.
John thought he might start keeping a list of things that Sherlock said that were like that. He was starting to wonder if Sherlock had ever been in a relationship, or if being mated had just scrambled the man’s otherwise highly functional brain. Though, no, the gap between expectation and assumption seemed only present in things related to John.
Sherlock made a curious noise, the one he did when he was waiting for an answer. In this case, an explanation.
of all this had taken Sherlock unforgivably by surprise. It was almost excusable, given the startling feeling that afternoon of an irritated John going… well. The only way to explain it was that John had gone almost
Given that go ahead, John pressed one of the cups into his hand. They stood silently, both of them making similarly uncomfortable faces at the taste and smell of the tea that was somehow
In the grayness that had become his existence, in the absence of Sherlock, having the army taken away was a staggering blow.
“Sorry,” John said, setting his shoulders with a little wince.
That stung, and John hadn’t expected to feel that sort of thing.
“No, John, redundant.” Sherlock sniffed, tucking his attention back into the screen of his mobile.
The Colonel growled with what air he had left in his lungs, struggling beneath the weight, and John held on desperately, despite the gouges being dug into his forearms by the man’s blunt nails. Still he held on, despite the pain in his arms. If he let go, John knew it would end badly. He clung to the man.
A grunt answered him, but Sherlock waved him on.
Sometime later, after a shower in a surprisingly immaculate bathroom, John frustrated himself to sleep. It was the only way there was of describing it, because he neither fell into sleep nor did he pass out. He exhausted his way right into it, taken by the agitating lack of ache.
Sitting back, John scowled. Not only did the pipe-wielder trip over the kettle, he smashed straight into it. The thing was ruined.
is who you chose for a dealer?” John grumbled into his neck.
“Just… trust me, Clara,” John said, “I’ll ring you back.”
“It’s gone off. I didn’t know that tea bags
“Hohne Station.”
“Sherlock said that Marianne’s less… active.”
Something changed, then. It felt like- Anticipation. Curiosity. Sherlock knew he had felt those things when he’d come across the puzzle, but once he had solved it, they had faded. Now they were just words that related to how he cataloged the scene in his mind. If he played the discovery from the beginning he passed through the sensations, but they were more like colors than feelings.
The abrupt departure from Oxford.
Sherlock left him at the bedside, moving to collect their nightshirts. John sank down heavily and made lazy work of undressing himself. He managed to rid himself of jacket and waistcoat, and his neck cloth came away before Sherlock returned in only his shirt sleeves. For just a moment as he looked up at Sherlock, John thought that perhaps his husband really was proof against sleep. Then Sherlock bent to help him, and as his face came into closer proximity John could see the bags under his eyes.
that was what happened to the tea. So it didn’t matter that there was a kettle he could put on the hob, because his tea had gone from evidence to break room supplies at the Met and he would honestly rather drink piss than try that mint again.
were speaking either.
“That’s not fair!”
“How do you research that sort of thing?”
“A great many things are possible, John, but they do not all come to pass.”
Sherlock sighed again, “This is insufferable,” he grumbled. He leaned back into John, head tipping back so that he could stare at the ceiling.

He jerked awake violently, coming back to the waking world gasping for breath and with a heartbeat racing from some unknown terror that had crept towards him across that expanse of nothingness he’d been left to.
John knew he liked her when they first met, but he had greater hopes of some sibling camaraderie now that he knew that about her.
John gave Sherlock a squeeze and released him, turning towards the table to limp his way over. The turn became a lurch halfway around, exhaustion finally taking its toll over his legs, and John’s knee buckled. He pushed his hands out, closing his eyes in anticipation of the impact with the rug, but warm arms caught him instead. John was pulled back against Sherlock’s chest.
John had experienced the shock of that revelation at a most unfortunate moment. He had admitted to being feverish, undoubtedly the fevered dreams had featured nightmares of wolves, and while he had been recovering he was taken from the hospital to Russia. Given the travel times and the medication that would likely have been administered -- factoring in the fever when he was taken and the disruption in his treatment, as well as the healthily closed scar and normal body temperature John had when entering Sherlock's cell in Siberia -- it was likely that they had actually been taken within a reasonably short time from each other.
John staggered as the second blow connected, putting him off balance.
“Keep an eye out, would you John? I doubt you’d like to end up in the back of a patrol car, seeing as to how we’ve just gotten free of the onus of questioning from yesterday.”
And so we say our farewells to
He didn’t exactly have tender feelings towards most of his family on his own. Sherlock didn’t have to-
like he was Sherlock’s, just as he should, and that feeling was strong and sure.
Sherlock stepped forward, crowding John against the counter. Instinctively, John put his hands around Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock curled down to breathe against his ear, “As you wish, John.”
Almost before they were officially released by the sergeant, Sherlock hustled John away from the alley. Bullied, really.
The wavering between breakdown and blow up was gone.
Sherlock hopped neatly out of the skip, not too dirty looking but smelling distinctly of rot from whatever he’d been rooting through. Even John could smell that from several feet away. It was always curious to him how the distinct rancid decay scent of bins and skips managed to adhere to anything and everything that got near it.
“A lot of grass and dirt,” John grumbled.
Sherlock stepped into his personal space, then. Long fingered hands stopped John’s at his belt, and Sherlock knelt in a rush, wrapped an arm around John’s waist and leaned in to press lips against John’s stomach.
“It’s on, just on vibrate,” Sherlock said from somewhere beyond the shadows of the sheet.
closed again.
“Dr. Watson’s assailants have made bail,” the sergeant said.
The morning was never as bad as the evening, for some reason.
John changed from the tattered ones he had on, made the bed, and climbed into it.
there would be another surge of his brother’s strength, he was unprepared for the full force of it. When Sherlock snapped backwards the second time, a full body jerk, Mycroft was sent staggering backwards into the shower.
take from all of it is Sherlock,” John said.
“I’m your mate, not your puppet, Sherlock,” John said patiently.
Sherlock smiled slyly at John. "There
“Don’t know, don’t care,” John said, turning in Sherlock’s arms to put his face against his mate’s neck. The motion made him hiss, and Sherlock whimpered involuntarily. “You’re going shopping.”
That query received no response. Sherlock went back to staring at the pictures of John, silent and still.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nodded. “And you propose we remedy this lack of understanding through sex?”
“It takes a particular sort to stand up to my brother’s intellect,” Mycroft said, tipping his head as he observed John.
The Colonel was notably absent, the bunk over John’s stripped of bedding. John changed his sleeping position anyway, uncomfortable with the recollection of the fight and the dream before it. The other soldiers seemed to appreciate the act, and John learned a few names that he tried to hold onto.
That was impressive no matter how many times Greg saw it in action. When Sherlock was on a rant, he spoke in a single unending sentence so filled with logic it was like an assault with a physical weapon rather than just words.
“What?” he asked with an arched brow.
The thought sat in Mycroft’s mind like a boulder blocking a path. It was a bitter lump that sometimes obstructed the desired flow of things.
“Maybe,” John allowed. When Sherlock shot him an ‘oh, please’ look, John amended, “Yes. But.”
, John decided - had known Sherlock for years. Each of them had a story about how Sherlock acted, things he had done, what he liked and what he hated. Amid the drinks that were handed about and in the evening light of the library, they seemed to be conversing specifically about Sherlock rather than other things. The rational part of John’s brain knew that Sherlock was the only thing he had instantly in common with them, and common ground was a good place to start a conversation, but whatever part of him was mated to Sherlock was anything but rational. Mycroft’s challenge in Dresden, Sherlock’s warning upstairs, Elisabeth’s surprise at meeting him, the chip on Charles’s shoulder, Aldrich’s paranoia… all of his closer interactions prepared him to be wary of this new family he was being introduced to, and the common ground just seemed like they were flaunting their knowledge of Sherlock to the newcomer.
A second swing of the pipe was ducked, but John knew he wouldn’t be able to keep this up for long. Even a very stupid fighter would stop aiming for the head soon enough. He had to think. Think, dammit!
Sherlock
Something in John snapped.
“Not enough blood,” John replied, the words bubbling up without his authorization for them. Sherlock looked down at him with a winning expression.
"Interesting," Mycroft said. John heard it distantly, and then the door opened and closed and the older werewolf was gone.
"The woman barely spoke my language," Sherlock said dismissively.
All of this feeling was
Sherlock ranted to himself in the confines of his mind - cause so much chaos? Everything he had known of John prior to this was stable, steady, and caring.
There was one thing that Mycroft could think of to take the fight back out of Sherlock.
Instead, Sherlock concentrated on what he knew for certain about John.
It took three strides for Sherlock to grip him by the shoulders. The warmth of his hands was a shock. “John.”
Brief forays out of the flat for groceries taught John a bit about the surrounding neighborhood of Montague street, but for the better part of the next two days they stayed inside. John became quickly acquainted with what Sherlock called ‘his experiments’, and was thoroughly impressed by his mate’s… thoroughness, even if he could not be sure what the purpose of all the mess was.
Harry took the seat across from him, and the words between the two of them seemed to just stop. She stared at him like he was some kind of a miracle, some wonderful thing. It was somehow an awkward sort of look, the kind he was only used to from patients in the field, and the sort that Harry had never managed for anyone, to John’s knowledge. He picked up his cup and took a sip of the too-hot coffee.
"That," John chuckled out as Sherlock slumped against him and they both flattened out on the mattress, "was amazing."
“Three years,” the sergeant replied. He fumbled with his desk drawer and took a framed photo out, offering it to John.
"Did Sherlock read this?"
“What is it?”
"Despite the unusual circumstances," Elisabeth said, her voice sharp, "your family will be pleased to meet your mate, Sherlock."
John didn’t have much argument at that, so he chuckled into Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock tugged him back down and stroked his back. Finally, John came up with a retort. “We are witnesses in an open case.”
They came in two groups. Mycroft and his mate Anthea seemed almost to possess their own
“I should have made a better story,” Sherlock muttered, entirely to himself. The sound of his voice was swallowed into the body of the refrigerator. He came away from the refrigerator with an armful of food. When he caught Mycroft inspecting it, he met his eyes and said, “Slimming?”
John smiled into Sherlock’s neck. They were a mess. The flat was a bit of a wreck, the kitchen a disaster zone, and under normal circumstances John would have taken one look at it all and turned right back around and headed back out the door. But John’s normal was different now, and Sherlock was here.
As quickly as it came, the moment passed. The thoughts felt alien to him, as though they belonged to some other John Watson.
"You misunderstand my apprehension of the situation, Captain Watson," Mycroft said.
“Oh.” Really, this was an unexpected pleasure, to be able to properly introduce his mate to his mental acumen.
They were out of practice, but they knew each other’s bodies well. Sherlock let John set the pace, capturing John’s lips when he planted a hand on the back of the couch for a bit of balance. It felt too good, after so long. John had to close his eyes and try to distract himself to keep from losing it before Sherlock.
Sherlock strode back over. When John felt his mate close enough to blot out some of the white, he opened his eyes and looked up at him.
“To us, it is,” Elisabeth said. “A wolf can sense their mate, even from a distance.”
Behind the two of them came a beautiful woman who had a baby in one arm and a young lad following behind her. Elisabeth rose from her seat, ignoring the two men to step over and greet the woman - Joscelin, John overheard.
"You weren't hurt, were you?" Sherlock asked, low and serious, speaking with lips against John's sternum. "All this clothing... the antiseptic, things smell muted. Tell me,
In the painful intervening days, John had all but forgotten that discussion in the library. Now that it was mentioned again, though, he recalled a question that he failed to ask at the time. His intent to question was interrupted by a growl of complaint from first one and then both of the empty stomachs in the bed.
