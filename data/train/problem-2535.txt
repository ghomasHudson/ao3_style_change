John has no doubt Sherlock has estimated how long it’s taken them to get here, and catalogued every bump on the road, every sound he’s been able to hear, or rather the lack of any—no other traffic, no voices. He must be aware he’s practically in the middle of nowhere, in an isolated house surrounded by farmland, with little chances of escaping until he knows more of his surroundings. So he’ll be compliant for a while.
John has managed so far. It looks like Sherlock has got used to it.
The last lock opens, and John, having pinned Sherlock down to the floor with all his weight, starts unlacing the hood. Sherlock is squirming under him futilely.
Maybe John is not quite the man she wanted him to be. But he’s her man. He’s the one. Perhaps she won’t be able to change him to her liking, as someone else did, but she can make him remember what he wants to be, just like he makes her forget some things she’d rather leave behind.
Sherlock doesn’t deign to answer.
“Yes!” Sherlock says hastily. Too hastily. John might not have Sherlock’s skills in observation, but he’s not stupid. Besides, he’s learned to read Sherlock’s behaviour all too well, having spent so much time with him.
It must be a surprise for Sherlock that John’s hand travels further down, along his thigh, and lingers on the ticklish underside of his knee. John scraps it lightly with a nail. Sherlock tries to squirm away from the touch, but to no avail—he’s immobilised most efficiently. Snug leather straps, durable buckles. Murray should consider making dungeon furniture for sale.
John hopes it’s a ‘no’ to his unasked question about sexual assault. But even if there wasn’t one, it’s still a shock, to learn that Sherlock had been…tortured?
“What?”
It’s not like Sherlock will have many opportunities to be naughty, locked up in the cage, but John very much looks forward to finding out any signs of disobedience. It’ll be more fun.
“Sherlock?” John prompts.
John tuts. “No, Sherlock. No. I’ve been too indulgent with you. I know you won’t like it, but you need a lesson. Come on.”
John can’t help a chuckle. “Oh, not entirely, no. But you might enjoy yourself anyway…”
“Guess which one I am.”
He’s at the bottom of the pit, and he’s never climbing up. He can’t do it. Not alone.
“He is,” John mutters, still moodily. “You haven’t seen him lately.”
On the plane, he tries to doze off in his uncomfortable seat a few rows from John and his wife. It would be better if John shouted at him, even punched him—and then forgave him. But John hadn’t said a thing, hadn’t accused him of miscalculating, and it makes the weight of guilt heavier.
“Easy, Sherlock, easy,” John keeps muttering. He finally takes his gloves off and tosses them away. “What the hell got into you? Christ, I could have cut you for real!”
This time, he woke up gasping for air again. His breaths come in as ragged gulps and he can’t control it, a phantom pain in his lower chest where Mary’s bullet pierced him. But it’s all right, he’s healed, he’s alive.
John shrugs. “Boys need to relax. All work and no play makes us all a bit edgy. We’d be very grateful if you helped us…to get off.”
“It’s
It’s a nice touch that his face is exactly at crotch level if he tilts his head back a little. As for his rear end, it’s presented quite nicely, too. There’s not even any need for a welcoming sign, “Please enter,” strapped to Sherlock’s backside: the pose itself is obvious enough.
, okay?”
Mycroft gives him a glare. “You should muzzle him if he’s so poorly socialized that he still bites, or find him a trainer if you can’t spare the time to show your
“Moron,” Sherlock mutters, audibly this time, when the heavy door closes behind his brother, and John gives Sherlock’s jeans-clad arse a light spank for his rudeness.
He anticipates the peaceful rural scene, them sitting around the kitchen table and Sherlock on all fours at their feet, temporarily meek after screaming his voice hoarse during the long, harsh whipping, with his arse burning red, available for any of them to use as they please. The most delightful thing about it—all of them will be aware that he isn’t going anywhere now that he hasn’t used his most solid chance at running off.
She knows what. It’s a trick she’s done so many times.
John doesn’t need Sherlock’s deductive skills to understand what Sherlock wants to ask and doesn’t quite dare to. Once, John had made a promise. He’d told Sherlock he’d never share him with anyone else, not again. But Sherlock must know all too well that it’s John who invents the rules and changes them if something isn’t to his liking.
John was apprehensive about sharing Sherlock with Sholto and Murray again, mostly out of possessiveness—who wouldn’t want such a gorgeous fucktoy all for himself? But friends will be friends. How could he refuse when they’ve been so eager to have another go?
John taps at the arch of Sherlock’s left foot with the thin plastic ruler, to give him a feel of it. Building up anticipation.
At least ten more slaps, then, to make him forget his vanity. To banish all thoughts out of him, except for one,
“Please,” Sherlock breathes out, long past caring for dignity.
John pops the button of Sherlock’s trousers, then slowly tugs the zip down. He can see the muscles of Sherlock’s abdomen quivering a little. John tugs at the elastic band of his pants. “Let’s take a look… A preview, so to speak… Oh, very nice. Though we’re more interested in your rear end of course.”
He proudly looks at Anthea, on all fours at his feet, as naked as John, except for a soft leather collar decorated with studs and a silver engraved nameplate.
John gives Sherlock’s penis an experimental stroke, just once, and Sherlock jerks in his bonds with a desperate groan.
know Lestrade would show up the minute he did?”
John manages to open the door to the basement flat one-handed, still holding the wobbly Sherlock tight because there’s one more set of stairs and he doesn’t want Sherlock to fall. “Careful, mind the step…”
close. Maybe that’s the reason for everything.”
Sherlock rocks back and forth, his cock drizzling precome onto the sheet. His face is beautifully contorted with need. John feels his own penis twitching in his pants.
“I shouldn’t have left you alone when you were bound,” John says after a pause. It’s not the only thing that worries him, but at least one of them.
There’s always been something underneath his good-humoured countenance and patient manners and cuddly jumpers. Something angry and lost. Frightening.
John lingers for a moment, then grabs Sherlock by the waist and roughly pulls him close. They don’t usually kiss if it’s not in the rush of coupling, and it’s always more about claiming Sherlock’s mouth than being tender. Otherwise they get a bit embarrassed afterwards. But hugging is okay, Sherlock likes it. Now he lets out a shuddering breath against John’s shoulder, a sound between a sob and a laugh. “So we’re fine, I guess?”
“You had a cake. How about a birthday present?”
), Sherlock isn’t certain at first if it’s not a delusion—a parting gift from his overactive imagination.
The idea about the cellar looks worth considering too. But maybe later, John tells himself. Later, when Sherlock gets used to him.
Sherlock crumples the hem of his dressing gown in his palm, but it doesn’t feel like holding a hand and he lets go. John wouldn’t hold his hand anyway, he’s not like that.
John waits. He’s a patient man.
“Hush!” he orders and tells Mycroft, “He considers you a threat to his master, that’s all. Perhaps there’s something in your tone. Try to be more friendly, Mycroft, if you want your fingers to stay intact.”
He doesn’t ask,
“Why? Nothing happened to me.”
Sherlock stirs up violently, lurching against the confines of the cage, but it’s steady enough not to rattle.
“It’s different because it’s you,” Sherlock says at once, in a convinced tone.
Just a few strokes—and he comes onto Sherlock’s poor abused anus and the tender flesh around it, making more mess. He should have laid down a sheet to catch any excess lubricant and bodily fluids, but now it’s too late. Besides, he rather enjoys the sight. Sherlock looks so good, covered in come, so contented, so…happy?
Sherlock pokes him in the ribs, lazily. “Do I make you feel like a complete human being?”
It’s strange to see Inspector Lestrade standing in the hall, all casual, hands in his trouser pockets. A familiar figure on a new stage. Behind his back, there’s a lovely view of the garden through the glass door. It’s actually a nice place, this cottage. Perfect for a retired ex-military man, very peaceful. One would never think of a makeshift dungeon down in the cellar. Hopefully.
Despite being naked, a little unsteady on his feet, and undoubtedly anxious about his foreseeable future, Sherlock walks under their guard with his head high, like a proud monarch held captive by common soldiers. He should be wearing a crown.
Sherlock shakes his head.
. He’ll be dead like Mary. Free to escape. They’ll need to extract Rosie of course, but that could be managed.
“Shh, it’s okay, I just added something relaxing to your usual enema.”
“It looks like my husband has made a good use of you,” she comments with a cheeky smile towards John.
Instead, Sherlock’s hand slips off from John’s hip, and then Sherlock moves away entirely, rolls onto his back without saying anything. John awkwardly turns to his side to look at him.
“Fibbing, Sherlock. I’m not John. I can tell when you’re fibbing. Of course you were terrified. Did John whip your little arse well enough for you to learn your lesson? Lower your pants and bend over the bonnet. I want to take a look at your behind.”
When Sherlock finally cries out, “John, please!”—it’s the signal they’ve been waiting for. The whipping ends, though Sholto continues to play with Sherlock’s hole, seemingly fascinated with it. John goes round the table and crouches down to see Sherlock’s face. Sherlock tries to turn away from him, unsuccessfully, to hide that his eyes are moist. Still not quite free of his pride, still worried what other people might think of him, even if they are absolute brutes.
“Yeah, he’s here, I mean he’s around, but he’s… um… a little busy right now,” John blabbers. “Couldn’t you leave him a message or something? I’ll make sure he calls you later.” He realizes it’s a bit rude and suspicious, ushering Greg out just like that, so he adds, “Tea maybe? Sherlock won’t be back soon, but I feel bad letting you go after such a long trip.”
Sherlock grabs at Smith’s arm and flails weakly with his other hand, trying to get free from Smith’s hold, but his struggles become less and less vigorous, and Smith keeps whispering, his crooked teeth bared, “Maintain eye contact. Maintain eye contact. I like to watch it happen.”
Is there shuffling of feet? A crowd gathering around? An insidious doubt grows stronger. No, it’s not John. Someone else. This someone tugs at the base of the butt plug and starts easing it out. Its widest point passes his sphincter agonisingly slow, making Sherlock squirm a little and huff into the hood, and when the thing is finally gone, his empty hole twitches of its own accord, cowardly, dreading some new abuse.
He’s also unlikely to have someone living with him, like John used to.
Sherlock comments John’s achievement with a stifled, “Mmmfff!” He’s hardly to blame for being incoherent. John is short of breath too, the feeling of warm tightness around his cock maddening. He yearns to thrust in and out, mindlessly, like a mating beast, make his prey howl under him, but he wills himself not to hurry and to savour each moment. He doesn’t want it to be over too soon.
“Now, Sherlock,” Mary orders sternly. She’d come for a little bit of gloating, not just dropping Sherlock at Baker Street and then taking John home.
There’s an abrasion on his cheekbone and a smudge of someone else’s blood on his sleeve. He practically reeks of adrenaline, and that’s how she likes him.
“You’re well versed in anatomy, Sherlock. You know how sensitive the soles of your feet are. Very susceptible to pain. Lots of nerve endings there. You must have a pretty good guess how we’re going to correct your behaviour. Major, hand me a ruler please. It’s on the lower shelf. Yes, right there. Ta. Bill, you can take another one.”
“John—” Sherlock begins.
That could bring welcome oblivion. Stupor. Nothingness. It’s a wrong thing to do, and John would be appalled, but John isn’t there. Maybe he never will be.
They’ll clean the rest of his body, but this crust definitely stays.
John shrugs. “Yeah. I suppose. You know, one secret more, one secret less…maybe it doesn’t make much difference. I just need time for it to sink in.”
“So basically, you knew you’d be abducted and brought here against your will? On the whole, was it what you had expected?”
Sherlock shakes his head slightly, and John clambers to his feet. A few seconds—and Sherlock, huddled on the wooden floor, dares to prop himself up too and takes a wary look around.
It comes out like a moan. Sherlock doesn’t dare to ask,
Lestrade cringes. “Look, I’m not your handler... and I don’t just do what your brother tells me. Well, not always. I was worried, too, okay? You usually respond when there’s an interesting case. I didn’t really think…” He casts a quick apologetic glance at John. “But I thought I’d rather check, you see?”
The drug that knocked Sherlock out still makes his head feel clogged and fuzzy. He’s not quite sure what he’s saying and what John is answering. What did John ask him about the girl on the plane? “What, she’s still up there?” or “Wait, who’s still up there?” John’s voice sounds different somehow, laden with emotion. The way it was when he spoke to John on the phone, ready to jump from the roof.
without breaking skin, flicking it hundreds of times, before the victim went mad with pain. Imagine that? In the Middle East, there’s a different approach. No elegance, just blunt force—there are so many delicate, tiny bones that can be fractured, crippling a person for life. Nasty business! But don’t worry, we prefer the first method. Ready, Bill?”
Murray yanks Sherlock’s trousers down. Sherlock makes a loud protesting sound into the gag.
Sherlock scowls. “Oh for God’s sake, he’s a fight dog! He’s supposed to be like that.”
he is.
When John thinks Sherlock is ready, he puts on a latex examination glove, applies more lube. Sherlock is desperately aroused by now, watching him with pleading eyes.
They strike at the same time, John to the left and Murray to the right, and Sherlock predictably responds with a muffled wail, caught unawares despite all the warnings. Oh yes, he’s very sensitive. And it’s just a warm-up.
He’s not sure that he’s doing the right thing, initiating something sexual, but it’s always that way with him.
Indeed, that was a miscalculation on John’s part, he must admit.
When the door smashes open (
But they’ll work on his misconceptions. There’s plenty of time for that.
“Naughty,” John chides, grabbing Sherlock by a fistful of hair. “Let’s show him how we deal with wayward prats.”
“That’s”—smack—“what you”—smack—“are going to remember,” John declares smugly. Something tells him Sherlock won’t delete this.
“I’m not upset,” John murmurs and heaves a sigh because he has little hope that Sherlock won’t pursue this theme further.
After having put his bag into the boot, John—instead of taking the place next to Mary—slips into the back of the car too, from the other side. “Lie across,” he says. “Rest your head here.” He taps at his lap. It’s a far too generous offer, and it looks like Sherlock is unsure if it’s not another trick. John forcibly manoeuvres Sherlock’s pliant body so that Sherlock finally settles against him with a blissful sigh. Nowadays, it takes so little to make him contented. Just a small promise of tenderness. Sherlock winds an arm around John’s waist, and through the fabric of his shirt, John feels a peck of a quick, almost shy kiss on his chest.
Mycroft chuckles a little. “Of course not, though it is by far the greater pleasure. I’m here to make sure you are comfortably settled, nice and discreet. You’re a celebrity these days, Sherlock. You can’t afford a scandal.”
John sighs into his shoulder. “I kept talking to you, too. When they took me after the funeral, they didn’t know for sure if you were alive or not. But they thought you could have faked your suicide to save me and the others. They mentioned the snipers and how you were forced to jump… And you know what? I was glad they kidnapped me. The mad hope they gave me—it was worth it. All the time I was there, I kept picking up things—whispers, laughter, gossip. I know you were caught in Serbia. I know what happened, they talked about it. God, Sherlock, the first thing I thought—you’re not dead, it’s for real. And then it caught up with me—they knew about it because some of Moriarty’s other thugs were beating you up then. Torturing you.”
It startles John for a moment that Sherlock sees it that way. He’s really convinced that they are here for him, not vice versa. But maybe he’s right, they are. At least John is.
“We can’t keep our babysitter waiting,” Mary reminds him, keeping her eyes on the road. “I said I’d be back in an hour.”
Sherlock clenches when he feels a dollop of lube on his anus. “Easy, easy,” John warns him. “Relax, or it’ll hurt much more.”
“For god’s sake, what should I have said? Should I have begged you to stay? Please, John, or Seb, or whoever you are, don’t go because you’re the love of my life?”
the easiest choice. I’m sure you understand, you’re the clever one.”
Meanwhile, John wanders around the flat aimlessly, bursting with anticipation. He rolls up the sleeves of his dark button-up shirt; Sherlock likes it when he’s dressed in black instead of his usual jumpers and cheap chequered shirts he wears for work. All sinister and menacing instead of plain and cuddly and kind.
“No,” she says firmly. “No. We won’t leave. We owe him. I owe him. Magnussen. Ajay. He protected me against them. He tried his best to help
She doesn’t hope for a proper answer, and of course Sherlock doesn’t give her one.
They burst out onto the porch of the Diogenes Club giggling, John’s hand on Sherlock’s arse again. This time, Sherlock looks happy about it. John had dealt with him in a most pleasing way, without any additional implements. Sherlock had been still sore, but it never stopped him from enjoying himself. The curtain had got a little bit stained; John wonders if Mycroft will have to pay for the laundry. Fortunately, they’d managed to sneak out without meeting him again. Maybe Holmes the Elder is more delicate than he lets other people think.
“You are here to have a rest, just like I promised,” John continues as he caresses Sherlock’s calf, pleasantly smooth, with only a dusting of hair. “No cases, no exertion. Simple life. Peaceful routine. It took us some trouble to organize this for you. But I see you don’t appreciate our considerable efforts. We can’t have that.”
John takes a step back to enjoy the view. It’s predictably pleasing. The hood makes Sherlock dehumanised. Turns him into an anonymous plaything to be pinched, poked, and otherwise tormented.
If something
“I got a new identity, but I was to be summoned if my services were needed, to repay for a favour to a certain person.”
“So it’s psychosomatic then. Your limp,” Sherlock says as they sit side by side in the taxi. “You left your cane in the room when you ran after me. But you were shot. In the shoulder.”
No, not this one, it’s some silly nursery rhyme, why does it keep coming to his mind?) If John finds syringes in a Petri dish, he’ll be angry and concerned, he’ll come to the living room, squat by the sofa, so close…
“Behave,” John tells him sternly. “Bear down. Yes, good.”
“You want me to stay?” John asks gingerly. Maybe he’s interpreting Sherlock’s mood in his favour and Sherlock is going to say,
Mary laughs, despite herself. “No. No, not possible. You’re kidding me. How could everyone not see… No, scratch that. How could
His lips are slightly open, his eyelashes fluttering, but he doesn’t respond. He waits.
Much later, they uncuff the pliant, unresisting Sherlock, exhausted by relentless fucking from both sides, turn him onto his back again, and fondle him everywhere, pumping his leaking cock until he comes shuddering from head to toe.
John cringes, but Mary can see she has persuaded him. Without Sherlock being safe and sound, they have no leverage over Mycroft. He’s not overly concerned about saving John Watson per se. He only tends to his brother’s interests.
“See that?” John points at the camera on the wall. “It’ll keep a constant watchful eye on you, so please behave. Don’t play with your cock without us and don’t even think of taking out the butt plug. You might think we’ll be asleep and won’t notice, but you can never be sure. Also, don’t soil the cage even if you are desperate to relieve yourself, or you’ll be very, very sorry. And don’t try to call out for help. No one will hear, except for us, and my friends really don’t like to be disturbed in the middle of the night for nothing. They might come back here and teach you some good manners.”
“How so?” John wonders lazily.
When they open the boot, Sherlock doesn’t just squint in the bright artificial light of the garage—he glares. It’s a fierce and haughty stare:
“Because the real John is alive, and Sherlock would want him back. Sherlock is lost without him, and you’re just…sorry, but you’re just a substitute Mycroft tolerates for Sherlock’s sake. We’ll promise to find out where they keep their hostage. That woman, Moriarty’s partner, will surely contact you again. You’ll let yourself fall into her trap and I’ll back you up, but she shouldn’t consider me a threat. Besides, we should get Rosie out of it before all hell breaks loose. I’m sure Mycroft will agree to support us, he’s not too fastidious. I’ve got a plan. We’ll make the best out of what we have. That old story with the secret-selling mole could be of use.”
Afterwards, another relocation. Sherlock responds better and better to being manhandled. No attempts at twisting out or kicking as they drag him across the cellar and push him head-first into the barred dog cage. It’s no easy fit for a tall man, but Sherlock manages to hunch there, kneeling, bent double, and Murray shuts and locks the cage door behind him. Sherlock will spend the night like that, cramped into an unnatural posture, his hole stretched wide around the heavy plug, his thighs covered with crusted drops of cum. They’ll clean him up tomorrow, but for now, it’s better if he feels the evidence of what has been done to him. It’ll teach him humility.
John was going to walk Sherlock back to the room where he’d undressed with Sherlock still naked, on all fours, and wearing a hood, not to spoil the illusion. But now the plan doesn’t seem to have the same appeal.
A loud smack on Sherlock’s backside and a muffled whine. Sherlock keeps his lips pressed tight in order not to cry out.
John was vague about his plans, and much of the kidnapping scenario surely was a surprise for Sherlock, but probably not all of it. The hints John dropped must have given him a general idea, or he would have been more reluctant about leaving London.
“…because they don’t even think of looking. Besides, you’ve seen him, the way he was when he came back. Overly agitated. Poor reaction. He was clearly on something. My guess—heavy painkillers. Then he was on drugs. Then he was on morphine when you… oh well… And now it’s drugs again. I tried my best to push him away. I thought he’d notice. But he didn’t look. He was afraid to. I’d call it elective ignorance. Every inconsistency—he took it for his fault. I think Mycroft suspected something was off. But even if he guessed right about me, he wouldn’t say anything. He doesn’t care for John. John is nothing to him. His brother, though, is another matter entirely. Sherlock sacrificed two years of his life to keep John safe. What would he do if he learned John was dead?”
He avoids looking at the puncture marks dotting the underside of Sherlock’s arms. Another sign of negligence.
Sherlock stops dead and frowns at him. “Does it bother you? People talking?”
Hence this question about a birthday present, in a low, raspy voice. An invitation to read into it whatever Sherlock wants to. It makes Sherlock stare at him, openly, all pretence forgotten. There’s apprehensive hope in his eyes, and John can’t help a crooked smile.
They lie tightly wedged together, Sherlock’s head on John’s shoulder, and it’s such a familiar feeling that it’s almost heart-wrenching.
With that, he leaves the room. He’ll wait in the next one; he’s brought a chair there to get all cozy. He can hear the client murmuring, “Oh, that’s good” and “Fuck” and “Yeah, take it”—and Sherlock’s soft, stifled moans in response.
It takes some effort to strap Sherlock to it, but not too much. It’s as if Sherlock knows he should at least try resisting, but can predict the results right from the beginning. His intelligence plays against him. It often does.
A sharp smack. And another one. And another.
On the whole, extracting Sherlock from a quiet B&B in the middle of the night has been hugely entertaining, at least for the abductors. A boost of adrenaline after a long stretch of mundane, uneventful life. Due to his connection to Sherlock Holmes, John has had more activity recently than either of his army buddies, which included lots of running around London, a few fights, and even some shooting. So he can’t begrudge Sholto and Murray for wishing to have an adventure. Dropping Sherlock twice on their way to the car was careless of course, but oh well, it wouldn’t have happened if Sherlock had stopped squirming, so it’s partly his own fault.
John makes an amused sound, rubbing little circles between Sherlock’s shoulder blades. “That’s a good deduction, yeah. Was it intentional, getting me dirty?”
“Sherlock told you that?”
“No. That man… It was me. It took quite a while. It took surgeries to make us identical. It took learning how to speak like him, how to walk like him, how to think like him. Lots of rehearsal. But Jim was always planning things ahead, so he had plenty of time to have me changed and trained. I did it for him. I wanted to.”
When they arrive in London, John and Mary will fetch Rosie and then go home, and he’ll probably have chips in a cardboard carton from a stall on the corner. He’s allowed that.
Mary is simply glad everyone is gone. It’s just her and John and Rosamund Mary. A family. Maybe not an ideal one, but still a family. There are things they will never share, but those are in the past. She hopes so.
The blindfold is still on, and so is the gag, but John’s voice seems to have reached Sherlock’s consciousness, finally, for he goes slack and lets John carefully take the hood off. Sherlock’s breathing comes out in ragged, struggling gasps.
“That’s not only a punishment,” John explains. “We like to tenderise the meat before we fuck it.”
“Sherlock? Are you all right?”
She’s about to say, ‘Yes, what a nice happy ending,’ when it strikes her. “Oh my god. She’s not going to let John live. The riddle—it’s a dead loop. It starts with her singing a song, and when solved, it just takes you back to her. She didn’t give Sherlock a direction. She mocked him. John is going to die, like the other one.”
The front door swings open. Sholto and Murray are back, both grinning and a little muddy.
But oh well, who wants an ending anyway, however happy it might be?
“Because I can’t... you know I can’t. She thinks you’re dead.”
John gives Murray a sign to stop. Predictably, Sherlock makes a frustrated noise, poor thing.
John nods. “Probably not.”
He also said, I’m not the man you thought I was; I’m not that guy. I never could be. And his therapist would probably suggest that this speech was hardly meant only for a dead woman who couldn’t hear him.
Murray takes the butt plug out none too gently—not because he’s annoyed with Sherlock, he’s just impatient to shove something else in its place—and after another fit of vigorous but silent thrashing on Sherlock’s part and some fumbling with a condom on Murray’s, Sherlock finally gets his arrogant arse full of cock.
It’s so bizarre that Mary can’t say what she feels at the moment. Surprise? Strangely, no. It’s as if pieces of a defective puzzle suddenly click into place.
The past catches up with them faster than they anticipated.
to be passive. From this moment on, you’re stripped of your privilege to make decisions for yourself. You may enjoy—or not enjoy—what’s being done to you, but you have no say in the matter.”
.” But when it’s not dirty talk or commands, he finds it hard, making speeches.
Instead, Sherlock huffs out an angry, sardonic  laugh. “What does it matter? Since when is it of any importance what I want? You seem to know better what’s good for me. If I behave, I’ll be rewarded with a friendly visit now and then, like this one. And meanwhile—'Get on with your life, Sherlock, find someone. Take your chance. Go shag anyone who’s interested. Have a night of passion in High Wycombe. You’ll feel so much better. You’ll feel complete'.”
“That’s not what troubles me.”
“Definitely.”
Actually, Sherlock should be glad they haven’t had to drag him to Sholto’s secluded cottage all the way from London. Luring Sherlock to Sussex has been tricky, but totally worth the trouble. Not only because it has made the kidnapping part easier, but for Sherlock’s sake too. Several hours in a boot would have been torturous, while a short trip must have felt simply unpleasant.
“Why would I care for Mycroft’s plans?” Sherlock says bitterly. “I only cared for yours. But it was fine with me,” he adds quickly. “Whatever you wanted, it was fine. If you thought I deserved it…if you enjoyed it…I’d go along with that. Honestly, I would. It’s not that I’ve changed my mind. I haven’t. It’s just—” He backs off and clenches his fist against his mouth, almost bites into it.
“Not a slut?” John wonders. “Just wait a bit, we’ll make you into one. How do we want him, lads? Back or front?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Really? I correctly anticipated the responses of people I know so well? Can’t everyone do that?”
He reaches for his wallet, but John stops him. “Nah, not like that. We’ve discussed the matter with the boys—and we’ve decided that we want a different form of payment.”
Sherlock stares at him, unblinking, his cigarette forgotten for a moment. Maybe it’s an unexpected statement for them both.
John isn’t good at difficult conversations, so he starts from afar. “Now people will definitely talk if Greg blurts something out. Not on purpose of course, but…”
“It’s very handy that I have a vet among my friends,” John explains in the meantime. “I didn’t have to buy a breeding stand, I just borrowed it. A few modifications—and it fits perfectly, doesn’t it?” John fastens thick leather straps around Sherlock’s hips and shoulders. “Do you know what the thing is for? It’s for animals who have to be held down for mating. The difficult ones. Aggressive ones. Just like you. No-no, don’t move, it’s your own fault that we have to do this. You could have been polite with the clients I’d found for you, but you chose not to.”
He knows something that Sherlock, too busy being ashamed of himself, doesn’t see. Mycroft might talk in a snide, condescending manner, but he’s really concerned about his brother. He isn’t happy with Sherlock’s current situation, his newly re-established arrangement with John, highly indecent in nature. But the alternative seems much more bleak. Sherlock on his own, left alone with his mind to race out of control, tearing itself to pieces, is a danger to himself, too prone to self-abuse. So Mycroft would rather leave his brother in John’s capable hands than let Sherlock overdose in some dirty back alley.
Sherlock regards him coldly. “Are you telling me you never slept with anyone but me before? All the while we were fucking? And don’t even try to tell me off for foul language. Because that’s what we were doing. Surely, you wouldn’t call it lovemaking?”
“How is it different, what
“…and one day he asked me to get acquainted with someone who was of interest to him. To keep an eye on that man. Nothing more.” Her voice hitches a bit when she says, “It was you.”
Sherlock is all arrogance and snide remarks, always uptight, always wound up like a tightly coiled wire. He’s unbearably, almost inhumanely perfect in his work and his looks. But in bed, he’s still inept, spectacularly ignorant in some things, and even insecure at times. Someone else might think it’s a flaw, but not John. A weakness—yes, but a weakness to be exploited and relished. It has made Sherlock open for many suggestions of a very dubious nature. Made him trust when he should have been wary.
happy about this Irene Adler situation, despite his best efforts to do what’s right, just this once.
Sherlock looks at him, uncomprehending. Oh. With all this talking, he seems to have forgotten that the game is still on. Well, they need to remind him then. His daring escape has been useless since he hasn’t really got away.
“The love of your life?”
“I’ll take it as a compliment. But that’s not what we agreed to,” Sherlock says slowly, as if he’s still sure he can talk his way out of it. At the same time his gaze darts towards the door. An escape route. No-no, that won’t do. John gives a sign, and his friends grab their prey from behind.
“We could,” Murray volunteers immediately and not so subtly pokes Sholto in the ribs so he would agree, too. It’s blatantly obvious that they want Lestrade to leave as soon as possible. And yes, Sholto, even one-handed, will be of better help with the car than John.
John is still looking away. “Don’t you want me to?”
Of course he isn’t.
Sherlock writhes and groans through gritted teeth, but he’s not going anywhere. John won’t let him. He knows it, and Sherlock knows it, but it’s most enjoyable to have Sherlock struggling, even if half-heartedly, and to feel how
It’s very promising that they’ve been able to reduce Sherlock to giving short responses right from the start. He’s usually far more talkative when something isn’t to his liking. Sure, there’s still some defiance left in him, but at least he tries to hold it back. The soles of his feet must be burning and throbbing; he will agree to anything right now to avoid further torment. Later, though, when he recovers? He might cause all sorts of trouble, so it’s better to be watchful and never give him a breather.
Some more struggling—and the naked detective is stretched on the bed across John’s lap, his head to the left and feet to the right. Sholto holds his legs, and Murray secures his arms. Sherlock may writhe all he wants, but he won’t escape.
“Sherlock,” John says almost softly. “We’ve been very indulgent so far. It’s better if you don’t make us cross. We know how to break people. It’s not a threat, it’s facts. But you have a choice. Cooperate willingly, and you might enjoy yourself. Just try it. Move your hips back a little. Yeah, right. Like that. See, it’s easy. Now, forward. And back again.”
John wipes a stray tear from Sherlock’s cheek. “There’s no shame in it, you know,” he says. “It’s a natural physical reaction. Like arousal. You can’t control it, but it’s okay, you don’t have to. No one is going to think less of you here if you cry or scream, or even if it turns you on when somebody fingers your arse. Any reaction is fine, Sherlock. Except disobedience. When you’re given a command, you’re going to obey, instantly. When you’re asked a question, you’ll answer at once. Is that understood?”
Sherlock isn’t quite sure what’s real anymore, except for the primitive desire to stay alive. It’s still there, despite everything he’d done to get an appointment with death.
“Why not?”
“What if it was?”
The second set of stairs on the other side of the room leads up into the house, but Sherlock isn’t going there, not just yet. He isn’t tamed enough to be allowed into the living quarters. As for a tiled corner with a drain and a shower nozzle, he’ll get acquainted with it much sooner, if not right now.
He isn’t, normally. The only times when he’s clingy and needy are the moments when he’s exhausted and utterly broken down. It shows how far from normal Sherlock is now. He clutches at John’s shirt like it could save him, and John can’t help but remember Sherlock grabbing at his shoulder urgently before he’d collapsed in the hands of the paramedics. “We can trust Mary.”
“Don’t you think he deserves another correction?” he asks.
John shrugs. “I dunno. It’s just… It was a bit extreme. Not quite a conventional first time.”
She waits for him to continue, and he does, after a while, “Remember Sherlock telling us Moriarty must have found someone who looked very much like him, to scare the kidnapped kids and cast a shade of suspicion on him? There wasn’t only the man resembling Sherlock. There was a man resembling his closest friend as well.”
He stood there and couldn’t do anything to help. She said she liked him. She said they were even now.
Afterwards, it gets easier, at least for John. The rest of his hand is naturally pulled in—and his fingers curl into a ball. He stops for a short while, letting Sherlock get used to the sensation, maybe too intense. Sherlock looks both astonished and spaced out.
“Yes, yes, it’s me,” John confirms tersely. “You won’t fight if I let you go now, will you?”
“That was actually brilliant, escaping from a locked cage. A very impressive entrance,” Bill says, and it’s funny how Sherlock brightens up. So predictable.
Sherlock blinks. And blinks again. He’s not going to cry like a four-year-old. Definitely not. He has no reason to. “Nothing,” he says, and it’s true. “He even tried to be my friend, I guess. He just…wasn’t the usual you, and I thought it was my fault. I thought—”
John snaps the ruined glove from his hand, unzips his fly, and smiles into Sherlock’s dazed face.
When Sherlock finally stops thrashing about, having understood the futility of his efforts to break free but far from reconciling with his defeat, John tells him, mentor-like, “Being tall doesn’t mean being strong.”
“Where are we going? Can’t you tell? To the basement flat. 221C. Don’t worry, Mrs Hudson is away for the whole weekend, she won’t mind.”
Sherlock comes back and starts dressing. He does it very quickly, like he’s in a hurry.
But before that…there had been that warm and cosy moment when they fell asleep on the stairs and John forgot he was getting married and everything seemed to be fine. Awkwardly fine because lying on the wooden steps wasn’t really comfortable and his ribs hurt a little, but still.
“Is there something else?” Sherlock wonders, perceptive, as always. Insensitive, perhaps, but still perceptive.
Unlike Sherlock, John is dressed in a suit. Maybe not as posh as Sherlock’s usual outfits, but quite presentable. Adequate for the place they're going.
“One word, Sherlock! One word to let Greg know that you were held here against your will, and you could have left, but you were too proud to ask for help, weren’t you? It’s either that, or you enjoyed your stay with us. But then again, I suspect your pride wouldn’t let you admit it. Yet. Either way, we’ll have to work on your behaviour.”
He’s still angry, Mary can feel it, and he has every right to be, but will he get over it? She very much hopes he will.
“So Mycroft planted his agent on me,” John says slowly, looking into the darkness behind the window. “Did he say why? He suspected something?”
“So on the whole, it
It’s nice to have an understanding without having to say anything else. If John had any doubts whether Sherlock would be eager to be his whore again, now there’s no uncertainty about it.
Maybe John won’t come. If he doesn’t, no one else will, but then it doesn’t matter.
John stares blankly into the corner of the room for several seconds, avoiding her gaze, and his voice breaks slightly when he says, “Okay, I’ll see you later.”
“It’s not too late,” he promises to her fervently, desperately, on his knees in a burnt-out bedroom. “I’m here. You’re not lost any more. You just...you just went the wrong way last time, that’s all. Tell me how to save my friend. Eurus... help me save John Watson.”
John turns to Sholto. “I think we should spell ‘cum dumpster’ on his forehead. It’ll look good on him.”
John was sincere when he tried to persuade Sherlock he should call her back. Or more exactly, he wanted to be sincere. He wishes Sherlock well, doesn’t he? Sherlock deserves a chance at something more or less normal, if a romantic entanglement with a lunatic dominatrix counts as such. But… Oh well, John isn’t an entirely selfless man, and he knows it, so why pretend—he’s definitely
Sherlock waves at him dismissively. “The others could help you with that. And we’ll all happily return to our own business.”
Another hallway, another heavy door—and here’s the Stranger’s Room. Does Sherlock try to discern any sounds around him—furniture creaking, low murmurs? Does he wonder how many men have gathered here to watch him, whispering to each other, laughing quietly, making bets? The room has an intoxicating smell of oil, shellac polish, and wax, very masculine, but John doubts that Sherlock is able to feel it. It must be difficult to breathe through the small nostril holes in the hood, let alone enjoy any aromas.
It seems like it’s difficult for him to pronounce the word ‘slut’, though he didn’t seem to have a problem calling himself that in the cellar, while John was fucking the hell out of him. It was so much more simple down there.
Unfortunately, the café has no licence for alcohol beverages, or John might have ordered himself a different drink rather than just tea. On second thought, maybe it
“You said I shouldn’t make any video messages without telling you first. So. I’m telling you.” She waves a disc with ‘Miss you’ written on it.
John keeps rubbing a hand between his shoulder blades and makes soothing meaningless sounds. The police officers must be staring at them, but Sherlock doesn’t care.
Soon Sherlock, pressed into the mattress, is freed from his clothes entirely. It takes some effort to take his shirt off because he’s still trying to worm out, and Sholto gets kicked in the shin while fumbling with Sherlock’s shoes, which doesn’t improve his mood in the slightest.
John knows he should consider himself fortunate that things have turned the way they did, even if there are minor mishaps sometimes. He knows it… But he can’t say he’s entirely happy. He can’t help thinking that something is off. Not with him, not with Mary. Despite their little domestics now and then, they’re alike, they’re both predators, partners in whatever they do. They enjoy what they have in addition to their unexpectedly normal married life. It’s Sherlock who worries him.
“Jerk yourself off then,” John orders, rubbing his come into Sherlock’s skin.
“Both.”
“John?”
John sleeps lightly, stirring a few times to check on the live feed from the cellar. They left the light on, so he has a perfect view of Sherlock squirming in the cage, trying to get more comfortable and always failing. But he doesn’t try to pull the plug out, clever boy. Finally, Sherlock stills, his head bowed, and maybe dozes off, or at least tries to. Very well. He’ll be busy during the day, so he needs a good rest.
John looks at her rear end longingly. He hadn’t been able to sniff her crotch.
“She didn’t know me,” he says, contemplating the floral wallpaper pattern. “She thought I was a nice guy. Someone ordinary. I just…I just liked someone thinking that of me, I guess. Because
It’s strange and exciting to find Sherlock still so compliant, still willing to let John own and debauch him like this, despite his doubts. It’s a heady feeling. Maybe also somewhat disturbing. Is it trust on Sherlock’s part? But why would Sherlock trust him
Something must show on John’s face because Sherlock suddenly frowns, and the blissed-out, relaxed expression dissipates as if it’s never been there—just a phantom over the usual wary tiredness. Turning away, suddenly awkward, John finds paper tissues, hands them to Sherlock. They both clean themselves in silence. It’s as if a cord that bound them together for a short while has been suddenly cut in the middle, and they have been left with its useless halves.
John’s mind, already clouded by sleep, supplies him with a very vivid picture of Sherlock writhing on a dildo and begging for release, all his arrogance stripped off him along with his clothes.
Sherlock saves him from trying to answer obviously rhetorical questions, both Sherlock’s and his own. He pulls the sheet tighter around his shoulders, as if he’s cold, and says in a more measured tone, though it still sounds strained, “Look. I understand you meant well. Probably. But don’t do that again. As far as I remember, I once said I never begged for mercy, but here I am. Begging you. Don’t push me to…other people. It’s not helping, providing me with substitutes.”
John pats his arm awkwardly. “It’s okay. A drop of glue—and we’ll mend it. Promise.”
“Do you know why you’re here?” he asks.
“Was it intentional?” he finally inquires. He looks like he won’t be surprised. He looks like he’ll accept it if John says ‘Yes’. After all, John beat him, not just once, and shared him with Mary and others when Sherlock clearly didn’t want that, yet John’s armchair is still there, in the living room, as an invitation to stay.
, she tells herself. Re-lax. Two syllables.
“Wakey-wakey! No, no, don’t touch it,” John warns him before Sherlock tries to wipe the sticky semen off. “Wait until it dries. I said don’t touch it, or I’ll add some piss to it.”
Sherlock shifts uneasily in his stocks. He’s got a cramp. His nerves are acting up.
Is knowing that Sherlock enjoyed himself too an excuse for further experiments? What if next time Sherlock doesn’t like it? Then what?
John relocates the mirror so that Sherlock can see his own reflection. It’s a delightful sight, though Sherlock might consider otherwise.
He tried to save her. He tried his best. When Mary said she wouldn’t let Vivian escape and practically provoked her to take out the gun, he talked and talked and talked, he gloated, he jibed, so Vivian would aim it at
It sounds so bitter, so caustic. Mary couldn’t imagine John held so much resentment for Sherlock. He’d never spoken like that before.
“Mmhm, in a while,” she says.
“Will somebody be looking for him?”
“What?”
“Sherlock, calm down, it’s me, it’s all right.”
A moment of silence. John considers speeding things up with a ruler again when Sherlock finally manages, “No, we don’t need a gag. John.” He adds John’s name hastily after a pause, as an afterthought. And visibly tenses up, aware of his almost-failure.
“How about Rosie?”
“We should take pictures,” Murray suggests. “You said he’s got a website? If you post them, he’ll have a line-up of clients. Well, not of his usual kind, but you might make lots of money on him.”
“Right to the hilt,” Murray comments cheerfully when John is all the way in.
Sherlock is used to John not finishing his sentences. “You shouldn’t be worried about STDs. I’m clean.”
But John isn’t there, of course he isn’t. And it’s good. Good. John shouldn’t see him like that. He’d be worried (wouldn’t he?), and it’s not fair, making him worried.
John laughs, a little embarrassed. “How did
His voice hitches because Sholto emphasises John’s reasoning with a few jabs of his finger, in and out of Sherlock’s hole, as an additional method of persuasion. You can never overdo debasing on the first stages of correcting a difficult subordinate.
And yeah, they are more or less even. They both weren’t supposed to be like that. Former assassins living under false names, with a past to die for. Literally.
Only John is allowed to take Sherlock without a condom, and now he does just that—forces his swelling cock into Sherlock’s warm, pulsing passage. The sphincter might be dilated, but John’s so well hung that when he slams all the way in, Sherlock certainly feels how much more he’s stretched. It makes him groan, full voice now. “Oh, John… Oh…”
There is one more thing, actually. One very important thing. And a few less important ones. Maybe she should have said something about it when he confessed to her. That would have been the right time. She’ll have to tell him now anyway because their plan of survival depends on it. Ajay has made Mary delay her preparations for quite a while, but perhaps it will turn out all right in the end.
John chuckles nervously, somewhat disturbed by this outburst. “Did you think Mycroft would have allowed something like that—you being prostituted to a whole room of strangers?”
Leaving Sherlock on another verge of panic is clearly a bad idea too. John takes a quick look around. The only option that comes to his mind is a bit of vandalism. There are dark, heavy curtains on one of the windows. John rips one of them down. “Here. You can wear this.”
John’s fingers were stained with blood. So much blood. There wasn’t that much when Mary shot him.
John smiles to himself. They must retrieve Sherlock’s handcuffs from Mrs Hudson. It might be awkward, so it would be Sherlock’s task. Maybe he’ll just steal them back…
John wanted Sherlock not to be dead, and he very much wants him to be alive
Well, that’s unexpected.
“But it could. You never know what might go wrong. I might have slipped on the stairs, and you would have stayed there, tethered, until Mrs Hudson came home.”
“Uh. No. If not for the car, I’d rather go back if everything is really fine?” The end of his phrase turns into a question.
He’s been barebacking Sherlock for quite a while, so he doesn’t bother with a condom. Sherlock gives a muffled “Oompf” when Sholto rams his entire length down his throat while John simultaneously pushes into him from behind. They quickly pick up the pace, overeager after a long wait. John’s balls pound against Sherlock’s buttocks, and the meaty slaps are accompanied by the sound of Sherlock’s gagging and occasional moans as he slobbers all over Sholto’s penis.
Every second in blackness and silence must seem like an eternity as he waits and waits and waits, flinching at every imagined sound. Is John still there, or has he left? Will he watch at least?
“Why did she let you go?”
“Well, it worked anyway,” she says cheerfully while she deletes a message to Mycroft on her phone—LAZARUS IS GO. “It was Sherlock who almost spoiled our scene, poor thing. He tried so hard to make Vivian shoot him instead of me that she almost did, despite her deal with Mycroft. Do you think he’ll keep his word and let her escape for cooperating with us? Not that I’m really interested… By the way, what did you want to tell me? You said you needed to tell me something, before we left for the aquarium. God, I need a shower. I’ve got that fake blood all over me.”
This very moment, the door upstairs swings open, and Murray calls out, concerned, “John, we have a visitor.”
“Well, you know me then.”
“Sherlock, will you behave and let Major use your mouth, or do we need a spider gag?”
John thrusts into him brutally, a surge of possession overwhelming him. That’s his prey, his bitch, his trophy. His. His. When John feels he’s going to come, he pulls out, none too gently, and spurts his semen all over Sherlock’s behind, onto his twitching hole, onto his buttocks. It feels almost ritualistic, marking what belongs to him.
John definitely likes the sound of Sherlock growling in frustration. It’s very arousing.
John feels sorry for him. Sherlock’s customary diplomacy and tact are notorious, but at least he could thank Greg for taking the trouble and driving all the way to Sussex on his day off.
“Now crawl to the sling.”
Mary huffs in response. John wonders if that means she’ll eventually concede, or will she insist on taking him home after they drop Sherlock at Baker Street?
He trails a hand lightly along John’s spine, and John gives a quiet woof. Sherlock smiles.
For some reason, words about being disappointed always work on Sherlock. His expression turns into one of dread, and then he quickly lowers his gaze, having understood that he’s betrayed himself.
Sherlock doesn’t try to kick anymore as they drag him out. He’s smart enough to understand it will be futile. But his gaze frantically searches the garage, gathering more data.
realise Sherlock is very far from being fine. So why does John ignore all this? Why does he prefer to stay away, not to see Sherlock for weeks, unless something happens?
“Remember our agreement? You have to pay your part of the rent. I’m not going to pay it for you just because we’re a couple now.”
“I’m a perfect copy. Hell, I’m more John Watson than he ever was! You know, it’s like glass doors. People keep banging into them because…”
“…because they look but do not observe?”
Maybe it’s something
Sherlock struggles in earnest, but he must have underestimated his adversaries. Sholto may have problems with his left hand, but the grip of his right one is tight enough. As for Murray, he’s perfectly fit, though maybe not as impressively muscular. People sometimes get the impression that John is the weakest of the three, because of his limp and his cane that now rests against the wall, and also his not quite prominent height. It’s a rather unpleasant surprise for them when it turns out that a heavy cane can be a deadly weapon and John’s not always limping. Not when he fights anyway.
“Oh, that’s unbearable.” Mycroft cringes, contemplating John’s attempts at courting his pet. “Stop him. I don’t want your mongrel anywhere near Anthea.”
John misses Sherlock’s sinister cheerfulness and his snide remarks and self-assured smugness. Sherlock is too composed, too compliant—a shadow of his usual self. It’s as if Sherlock is afraid to test John’s patience, convinced that too many ‘a bit not good’ things will earn him a punch rather than a half-hearted reprimand in public and a mutually satisfying punishment in private. Or, even worse, that John could walk out on him and never come back because he’s got Mary—and it wouldn’t be a problem to find another whipping boy for their mutual entertainment instead of one who's too difficult to handle.
“Strip. Clean yourself. Bedroom afterwards.”
She can’t but smile fondly. “Aww. I always suspected you’re a romantic. Now go find a rope. No, stop, I think I’ll kiss you first.”
In the next room, John palms his erection, listening to Sherlock’s howls. It’s very convenient that Mrs Hudson is away.
looks at John, or avoids looking at him, that makes her wary. If she were to judge by his facial expressions only, she’d say he’s still mourning the loss of a very loved one. John is lost to him, though he’s right here, in his flat, typing a new blog entry.
to want. Something ordinary. Nice. Like that girl on the bus. And with me…you can have what you need. Go back to normal now and then. Look for a romantic entanglement, as you call it. Flirting, dating, having dinners with women. As if it would miraculously fix you and stop you from craving what you think is indecent—dark things, dirty things, things you’d rather not talk about. And meanwhile, I’ll be waiting. That’s what I do. I wait. I never asked you for anything.” He pauses, plucking at the hem of the sheet, then finally looks up. “But I want to ask you this, now. Don’t try to fix me, too, by setting me up with someone else who might want me. Do you think The Woman might be my back-up plan? I never had a back-up plan. Unlike you.”
know me now. You know what I am. You might still want to be with me, for the sake of Rosie, but…”
For a moment, Sherlock looks at him without saying anything.
“No more clients for today,” John promises, caressing Sherlock’s cheek with the back of his hand. “You’ve got your pay for the whole month now. Isn’t it nice? Next time, you’ll choose for yourself if you want to behave nicely or be held down like this. It might seem harsh, but maybe it’s easier for you this way when you have no choice. Besides, people pay better for a scene like this. Just a few hours—and it’s all over. You’ll be sore for a while, but I’ll take care of you. It’s good to have a doctor for a partner, isn’t it? There’s just one more thing we have to do before I take you upstairs to have a nice hot shower. Do you know what I need to do?”
“What were you thinking, leaving Sherlock a message?
“Awesome, isn’t it?!” Sherlock exclaims in an exaggeratedly excited manner. He’s always excessively cheerful nowadays, except for the times when he thinks no one is looking. He’s sad when no one is looking.
It makes Sherlock wake up from his stupor, and he hurries to the bathroom. Good. All the old reflexes are there, despite everything that has happened lately.
John exchanges glances with Sholto, they both nod to each other, and John gives his permission, “On you go. But maybe we should take his gag out first, hmm? What do you think? Do you want to hear how vocal he can be, or would you rather he stays mute?”
Sherlock still doesn’t respond, scowling at him. John sighs. “Okay, you’re forcing my hand. The table then, chaps. Face down.”
'Well, you were the one who left,' John almost replies, but bites his tongue. They don’t need to go into all that again, do they? A bit of groping on the steps seems like a better option.
It’s utterly irrational, but he’s tempted to close his eyes and imagine John is sitting in the kitchen, waiting for the kettle to boil. Or maybe he’s cleaning the stove, humming a pop song tune under his breath. (
“John,” he breathes out, and his voice breaks on the name. It sounds like a sob. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” He skims his hands up and down John’s calf in a frantic caress and keeps murmuring into John’s thigh. “I knew you’d promised to never share me with anyone again, but at some point…it became so real…”
It’s a pang of anguish, to see him like that and know it’s temporary.
Is it John’s voice in his head or not?
He’s prepared for more acrid comments, so it’s very much a shock when Sherlock says quietly, “Thanks for organizing this for me. Talking your friends into this. Planning everything.”
Sherlock frowns, more perplexed than offended or frightened. “Although I’m flattered by your interest, I must warn you that I consider myself—”
John slides his finger further and further in, spreading the lube, slowly rotating the digit until the sphincter muscle eases. “That’s right. That’s a good whore,” John  praises him. “How about a little reward? Let’s find your sweet spot, okay? Oh, here it is.”
a slut. No matter how raw he is, he’s fully hard when John reaches a hand under him. Good. But he’ll have to wait some more, until John’s release, for the sake of subordination.
do? How is it different if you don’t want it?” John bursts out.
While Sherlock is still shaking with aftershocks, John pulls out, more or less gently, having returned his hand to the ‘silent duck’ shape. He’d be glad to continue, but his own cock is demanding release too insistently.
The first real stroke lands in the crease between Sherlock’s buttocks and makes him cry into the gag in surprise. The skin is pulled taut there, highly sensitive. Unlike Sherlock’s butt cheeks, it’s not crimson yet. All the more reason to mark it. More blows follow—as do Sherlock’s stifled grunts, acknowledgments of precisely measured, accurate aim.
Murray and Sholto step closer, synchronically, blocking any possible escaping routes. John tugs at Sherlock’s improvised cloak, and it slips to the floor.
Sometimes, it hits him after a particularly brutal scene—a nauseating feeling that he’s doing something revoltingly, inexcusably wrong. How could it have come to this?
In his obscenely tight shirt and jeans, Sherlock looks like a slut desperate for a shag. Without them, he’s touchingly vulnerable, like a nervous virgin, which is even more arousing. John is glad he satisfied his carnal needs to some degree before coming here, or he’d make Sherlock bend over the nearest upholstered ottoman right now.
It’s the second hug in a day that John has got from him, which is two hugs too many to be normal, but obviously, at the moment, ‘normal’ and ‘fine’ are both relative terms when it comes to Sherlock. Or him. So John doesn’t question what it means and simply pulls Sherlock close, sweat and come notwithstanding.
Meanwhile, John complains to Sholto, “You can’t even imagine the trouble it took me to persuade him he needs a respite from work.”
“Okay. We have something else to do then. It’s picture time!” John declares cheerfully, fishing out his phone.
“Only it turns out he isn’t,” John adds bitterly.
“We do, if I say so.”
Sherlock’s lips twitch as if in pain. “Don’t. Just don’t. Stop acting as if you really care. If you feel like you ought to have concern for me, forget it. It wasn’t a real rape after all. No need for guilt.”
“Like…like an earthquake,” Sherlock manages to utter.
“Do you think I’m with you only because of Rosie?” she cuts him off harshly.
John—she still calls him John, and he doesn’t argue—quirks a brow at her. “What’s that for?”
But he failed Mary again, this time irreversibly.
He feels like he’s wearing a plaster mask of Sherlock Holmes because he’s very tired of being himself, and simply tired of being, but there are cracks in the plaster and they are getting wider and wider with each day.
He moved in with Sherlock three month ago, on a spontaneous whim, after what was supposed to be a one-night stand. Or more exactly, a one-night orgy. Deflowering Sherlock together with two of his army mates was fun, albeit of a somewhat brutal kind. Living with him… that’s been more challenging, but not without its perks as well.
Mary watches them in the rearview mirror, clearly amused.
Sherlock’s lips twitch in a crooked, unhappy smile. “Theoretically, no, I wouldn’t mind. However, it’s not what you would find fulfilling. Because whatever we have—one would hardly describe it as a romantic entanglement.”
He also enjoys lathering Sherlock up in the shower, toweling him down, having a feel all over him through the plush terrycloth, and then putting him to bed.
He suddenly catches her hand. “Um. Mary, listen…I’m not good at making speeches, but…you know I’m not the man you thought I was; I’m not that guy. I never could be. But who you thought I was...is the man who I want to be. If it makes sense to you.”
Sherlock lying on the unmade bed, naked, among the crumpled sheets, looks very picturesque. A few days’ beard growth in contrast to his smooth, white skin unexpectedly adds vulnerability to his appearance. A sign of how neglectful he’s been to the perfection he still is.
“Why not?”
John sighs. “Because I’m an idiot, apparently. Listen, I’m serious. I’d rather you’re not alone.”
“Three bloody years… How could you do this to me? I thought you’d got rid of… yeah, how very practical of you.”
“Much better,” John praises him. “You’re a quick learner. Now, show my friend that you appreciate his attentions. Work with your pretty arse.”
Anyway, however wrong it might be, John wouldn’t turn down a pint, maybe with an additional shot of something stronger in it, just like on his bachelor pub crawl with Sherlock. The thought of it makes him feel uncomfortable, not because the memory is a bad one, more like the opposite, despite them both having spent most of the night in the nick. They ended up doing some rather indecent things in there—weren’t bachelor parties all about doing indecent things?—and John had been rough, maybe too rough. Partly because he'd been drunk and pissed off over them having been arrested—and maybe just a tiny bit excited that they might be caught in the process. And partly because putting as many bruises and bite marks on Sherlock’s body as he could manage seemed like a parting gift Sherlock would enjoy.
“I like it when you’re so open for me.”
Sherlock isn’t the only addict in here, only he went full speed down that road while John still manages to be discreet about it. He’s had a lot of practise in hiding his true self. No wonder he’s good at it. Only his mood swings give him away. Undignified crying and fits of rage are equally embarrassing, and the latter problem is also unpredictably dangerous. John tells himself he’s not like Harry, at least not yet. But the mere fact he's comparing himself to his alcoholic sister should probably be a tad alarming.
John is hers. He belongs to her only. She’ll do anything to keep him. It’s primitive, animalistic awareness bumping through her veins.
He says it so casually, like it’s nothing special, planning such things, taking responsibility for them. Making sure it’s discreet enough not to tarnish Sherlock’s reputation. Making sure it’s safe.
“Are you angry with me because it took me so long to decide?” he whispers into her ear. “I thought it might be for the best for
, oh no. He enjoys Sherlock’s exasperation, the small sounds he makes. An inflatable butt plug gets him especially excited.
“Oh yes. Good dog. Very loyal. We’re going to win a considerable sum, which is good in itself, but beating Mycroft is even more pleasant. As for the breeding stand…you’re going to enjoy it, though maybe not at first. Just imagine, John—you, a proud fighter, bound and subjected to humiliation, with all the party guests gathered around in a circle, whistling, encouraging Mycroft’s pack. You’ll feel something meaty pressing into your body from behind, right under your tail, deeper and deeper. It’s frightening how wide you’ll be stretched, and it will make you want to struggle again, but there will be no way to escape the bindings. Mycroft’s dogs will have you, no matter how much you thrash about. The only option will be to give in and become their bitch. They’ll take you one after another, brutally, not caring for your pleasure in the least—thick, throbbing cocks inside you, vicious thrusts ramming you forward. And when it gets almost unbearable, almost too much, you’ll come—helpless, violated, shuddering… As I said, John, you’ll enjoy it a lot.”
“Sherlock…you look like… Are you afraid of me?”
John frowns, looking down at him in doubt. “Is it what you want? To continue?”
“Thank you, sir,” Sherlock sobs out.
Mycroft looks Sherlock up and down, a glass in his hand. “I probably should be embarrassed over the state my brother is in, but I’m hardly surprised. He tends to choose provocative outfits even when he’s to visit Buckingham Palace. I’m afraid it’s something in the family line. So very like Uncle Rudy with his cross-dressing habit.”
“I don’t think so,” John drawls. “Don’t lie to me, Sherlock. Don’t disappoint me.”
John crouches down beside him, wipes his tears, ruffles his hair. “Tough, was it? But it’s all over now. You did well.”
For a while, they are silent, until John asks, “At some point, did you want us to stop? For real?”
Okay, she is jealous, let’s admit it. She has been for a long time, maybe right from the start. It’s not like John has ever given her a reason for that. He never looks at Sherlock in a suspicious way as if there were something more than friendship between them. But it’s the way
John gives his mouth a light but staggering slap this time. “Sherlock, shut up. Don’t make me angry. You’ve screwed up enough for today. One more word—and you’ll be in bigger trouble than you are now.”
“Oh Sherlock,” she croons teasingly. “I’ve never thought you to be the cuddly type.”
Sherlock hasn’t touched himself yet, waiting for John’s permission, and now he’s overeager to obey, driven to the point where no dignity is left. The awareness that Sherlock is so full of him is thrilling by itself, but seeing how turned on he is…it almost makes John spill in his pants. It’s more than intimate, feeling the spasms of Sherlock’s orgasm from the inside of his body. It’s like being one with him.
But he also knows Sherlock’s aggressiveness is always a sign he’s nervous—and appalled at his own anxiety. Greg probably isn’t paying attention, but Sherlock’s posture is very rigid. Undoubtedly, his legs must be weak and tingling with pins and needles after the whole night in the tiny cage, cramped for too long. He doesn’t want Lestrade to notice.
“Uh-huh,” Sholto murmurs sleepily.
To calm down, John tells himself that on the whole, they are even. Why should Sherlock have been celibate? John had made him into a highly sexualized creature with a penchant for games of a certain type, and of course Sherlock couldn’t stay abstinent. John never asks about his experience—and Sherlock never talks about it. It’s an unspoken rule.
