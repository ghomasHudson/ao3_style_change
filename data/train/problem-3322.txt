Those are his orders, and that’s what he’s attempting, though he’s starting to believe he’ll have to defy all of Heaven and Hell to see it done.
It wouldn’t be half bad, honestly. Sand between their toes. Cas is bad at relaxing — always feels like he needs to be somewhere, doing something — but maybe he’d learn. Maybe he just needs practice.
He stops at the bedroom on the left. “Sam’s room,” he says, and his voice sounds oddly normal; he pushes the door further open with his fingertips near the hinge. Then he gestures. “There.” On the floor.
The words feel farther and farther away now. Lately, what he wants to do is treasure Dean Winchester; to show him he’s worthy of love.
Castiel sucks in a breath. The words cost Dean; he can tell. The trust, the vulnerability, the unspoken admission:
“Count on it, Winchester,” says Dustin, and Castiel thinks it’s meant to sound friendly enough, but there’s something that puts him on edge about the way Dustin’s grin bares his teeth.
He expects it to be slow and languid, like when Dean’s exhausted after a rodeo, pliant in Castiel’s hands. Instead Dean’s quiet and intense, studying Castiel’s eyes before he kisses him, tracing deliberate hands over his chest, his ribs, his hips. “You’re incredible,” he murmurs again. “I want to — Jesus. Cas —”
“A crude device, but effective.” The point of the blade seems to dig harder under Castiel’s chin; Michael’s watching him, his face still. “Like you, it seems. When my counterpart sent you here in an effort to frustrate my designs, I thought he’d gone senile. I suppose he knew something, after all.”
The green of them is hazed with pain and maybe whiskey. “Cas,” he slurs, “I was jus’ thinkin’ about you.” He smiles. “Cas. Castiel. Hey, Cas.”
It’s a novel feeling, and sends an unfamiliar warmth through Castiel’s chest. The women he’s been with have curled up with him like this, yes, but it always felt like a claim on him, a — violation. With Dean, it feels like a privilege.
He breaks off, laughing, when Dean elbows him in the side. The bartender grins over the counter at him and says, “Double whiskey for the champion here, comin’ right up.”
he said once, which made Dean get up abruptly and walk out of the room so he wouldn’t start crying or something equally stupid.
So Castiel leans across the seat and kisses Dean. He wraps his wings around him, tight, and tastes the sweet lingering flavor of ice cream on his tongue; he wills phantom feathers to press confidence into Dean’s shoulderblades, confidence and calm.
There’s a job ad, too. It shows the caretaker’s living quarters — one of the old houses, among the last to be abandoned, still outfitted with a 50s-era kitchen. Well for water, generator for power. It lists the job duties — everything from leading tours to shingling roofs.
“It’s not a flunkie, it’s his son,” the woman interrupts sharply, “and I expect you to be civil to him.”
McKenzie’s twisting at a loose thread in his shirt. Dean wonders if he ever worries it looser, or if it’s just always been there, and always will be. “You think,” he says suddenly, loudly, “you’re gonna
A confusion of things happen after that. Dean is naked, a long beautiful expanse of skin, and Castiel likes that; Dean wants Castiel to touch him, he said he wants Castiel to touch him, so Castiel does. Dean melts in his hands, shuddering and needy and grateful and demanding, but he also wants to touch Castiel too; that’s a new discovery for Castiel. Dean’s hands yank at his trenchcoat, his tie, and when Castiel pulls back to help him remove them, Dean’s eyes track his hands, pupils hungry and enormous.
“I mean —” Dean makes a vague, frustrated gesture in the air above them. “I never exactly hid it from him, you know? But we weren’t really a —
Out on the street, there are people waking up. Parents rushing out of homes to find their children. Some of them look distressed; most of them just look confused. Castiel watches them brush it off, speak to each other, smile.
They peel themselves out of bed not long afterward, and go to find a bar that’s still serving food. Castiel ate at the rodeo, but he’s starving all the same; once he gets his burger, he doesn’t pause until he’s licking the last of the barbeque sauce from his fingers, and catches Dean watching him, eyes dancing, as he dunks a pair of fries in his gravy.
He got a look at Dean’s bare chest earlier, explored it with his hands, but this — this is different. He’s muscled, yes — flawlessly so — but there’s just a bit of softness around his belly that makes Castiel want to touch it all the more, to run his tongue over the divots of his ribs —
He also develops a nagging fear that he made up the whole thing. Not just the tension between them, but the invitation itself — a product of his fevered mind, a late night after a long day, and too much imagination paired with too little of the real thing. By Friday, he’s going back and forth on an hourly basis: Did Dean actually invite him? Did he mean it if he did? Should Castiel stay away, or should he go?
“Hey,” Castiel says, looking up quickly at Gabe. He’s standing just across the counter, eyes sharp — closer than Castiel realized. Castiel rubs a floury hand on his jeans. “I need to run. I might not be back for a while.”
“I did a little Googling,” he admits, after a moment. His voice is even, suddenly, if scraped hollow. “When you were at work. I took it off your browser history, after. About PTSD.”
Cas is holding a pile of documents; he thumbs through them. “We have a guide to the birds on the property. If we want to go birdwatching.”
his father would say, which of course is great advice when you haven’t already put your foot in your mouth by thinking a ranch owner lives in her damn bunkhouse. Instead, he picks his way between large puddles and wonders the whole time if the cowboys are watching him, if they’re laughing quietly to each other about what an obvious city slicker he is, or maybe worse, if they’ve already dismissed him entirely.
It’s untouched, not a ding in the fender. Somehow, it sailed across three lanes of traffic and landed in a ditch without hitting a thing.
The Lebanon post office is the sort of place where people stop to talk. There’s the banks of P.O. boxes; the counter where people sort through their junk mail; the stamps display; the line for service. Weathered farmers with their hats pulled down low commiserate over the state of the roads. Kids cling to their mothers’ pant legs. Women compliment each other on haircuts and ask after families’ health —
The cowboy from earlier — the second one, the beautiful one — is standing at the foot of the steps. His hat’s tipped far enough back that Castiel, for the first time, can see his eyes. There’s an ironic look to them, a bit of humor tugging at the corner of his lips. He shrugs, and turns to go just as the screen door swings open, forcing Castiel to stumble back a step, apology caught in his throat.
Castiel has seen would-be vessels before with their eyes burned out. He’s seen discarded vessels rocking and clutching themselves, their minds seared away. He’s never quite seen something like this.
For a moment, Mrs. Butters’ smile seems to have teeth in it. “There’s a lot you can hide by slipping it between the trees. Of course, I’m no
“And I’m not anyone’s fucking bitch boy! Okay?” He runs an angry hand through his hair, spiking it up on his scalp.
Sam and Jack are already there. They both look up at him, startled — then at each other. They both blink.
It stands well over Castiel’s vessel’s head. It’s not a perfect sphere — many years of additions have bellied out the sides. When Castiel puts his palm to it, he can sense the traces of the people who built it — the farmer who started it fifty years ago, setting aside used bits of baling twine for a rainy day; the townspeople who come together every year to work on it, and the visitors given scraps by locals passing in their trucks so that they, too, can help the twine ball grow.
“I’ll bring some more supplies, too,” Dean agrees, thinking of what he’s got. Plenty of salt, and those iron throwing stars are pretty cool, but — “I’d feel a hell of a lot better if we could carry shotguns around this place.”
He looks down at his phone screen. It’s almost out of battery. The time it’s reporting doesn’t make sense. It finishes ringing — then starts again.
“Yeah, you’d be pretty fucked up if you did.” Dean’s head swivels again — a teenage boy on the front steps of a porch, playing with a knife. Or he was. He must have caught it in his hand wrong, blade-first; blood is seeping there, but slowly. On his face, though —
He writes Dean his thanks, later that night, by the light of the hurricane lamp. He fills his letter with all the love and all the ranch life he can fit on the page. He posts it the next morning, before his drive home.
Dean glances swiftly at Cas. But Cas is already shaking his head, smiling; “No, thank you. But I’ll let you know next time I’m in town.”
He knows he’s being a little superstitious. In a weird way. The inverse of Cas’s own deal, almost; like if he acts for even one second like he’d be okay in a world without Cas, the universe will take him at his word.
Castiel catches his hand. He raises it to his mouth and kisses it, on the knuckles, along the veins. “That’s why you said yes?”
Dean’s accepted it gracefully, but Castiel still feels guilty. With the rhythms they’ve fallen into over the last month, exiling Dean feels like ripping off his own arm. It doesn’t help that Charlie has been planning a trip out specifically to meet Dean, and see him ride in the Stampede; she’ll be occupying Castiel’s spare room, and now engaging in the familiar, awkward song and dance of pretending to be straight while insisting to both Castiel’s parents that no, they’re not dating, they’re still just friends.
Suddenly, he remembers the feeling in his chest, the first time Charlie asked him sharply, pale-faced, if next time he could stay off the phone with her while he drives. The strange, lump-in-his-throat wonder of it: that
“Wait,” says Dean suddenly, horrified. “You don’t think he could’ve — you don’t think he was — watching this morning?”
Castiel swallows. “Vessels, they’re — not every human can be a vessel. It burns them out. The more powerful the angel, the greater the tax on the human body it occupies. When it comes to archangel vessels — few of them survive the experience with their minds intact.”
“I said shut up.” Castiel finds his jeans from yesterday and digs for his wallet, types in the credit card number one-handed. “It’s done. Where are you staying? Did you get my letter from Christmas?”
Finally, when he’s relinquished his tension enough to give Gabe a hand with the cookies he’s making, Castiel’s phone buzzes against his thigh. He steps away from the counter to check it.
How long they stay like that, Dean doesn’t know. He lets his hands roam over Cas’s body, lets himself hitch into Cas’s touch. They both cheat a few times — a little bit. Fingers slipping underneath hems, finding heat. Dean wants to touch all of Cas — everything. He wants Cas to touch all of him.
Sam’s right, probably. Cas wouldn’t mind. He’d also probably just drift away, like he does; he’d take it as a sign it’s time for him to move on. He’s done it before, and they’ve kicked him out of the bunker before, and Dean’s sure as hell not gonna do that this time.
That makes Castiel laugh. Missouri smiles and stretches an arm across the table. “Come on, now, give me your palm.”
Dean dreams, a lot. It might be, Castiel thinks, that the pain keeps him from slipping into deep sleep. At first, he thinks that the tossing and turning is pain, too, but Dean’s grinding his teeth in his sleep, alternating between rigid stillness and thrashing so hard that, more than once, he nearly expels Castiel from the bed.
“He’s got a hunt he wants my help on, back in Colorado. I figured — I can’t let him see you, and you’ve probably got better shit to be doing, so —”
Michael is laughing. He isn’t looking back at Castiel; his blade is almost within reach. “Are you serious? The one thing that’s been a thorn in my side — that’s been keeping you from me — and it’s the weapon I need to turn you. That is
“Come home for Christmas,” Cas says. “You’ve already got the time off. I — want to see Christmas at the ranch. I want to see
“Yeah. Guess we got off on the wrong foot,” Dean agrees. “You wanna do that? You talk, while I work? I wouldn’t mind the company.”
— and Claire’s skidding up, a handful of envelopes in her hands and her face flushed with excitement. “John Lewis!” she cries. “Gotcha.” And she’s got salt, and a lighter; and the ghost shrieks up in flames.
He looks so goddamn beautiful, like this in the dusk, the gold glow from the kitchen window half-lighting his face. Greta would have to be blind not to find him attractive. He’s
There have been enough times Dean thought about him jerking off; hell, he’s maybe even thought about Cas when he was in bed with somebody else. A time or two.
Dean stares for only a moment. Then he reaches out and hooks his fingers in Castiel’s shirt and pulls them together again.
Dean’s head jerks toward him in surprise. His mouth is open, and a flush creeps up his jaw. “I — was cooking dinner,” he says.
Dean mutters under his breath, tossing his duffel in the trunk and slamming it again; Cas has his hands in his pockets, watching him. His face is serene. Like this is a perfectly normal day, a perfectly normal thing to offer.
The shock on Cas’s face is fading to something equal parts worry and wonder. “Dean,” he says, “if going to Jenny Lake is too much — we don’t have to. I regret even proposing it.”
He looks guilty about it. Castiel feels something jealous and protective flare between his ribs. Against his better instincts, he asks, “Do they actually think they’re going to put you to work? Already?”
And Gabriel always seems willing to do it. Castiel smiles, then remembers: “I told Anna. About Dean. While everyone else was screaming. Do you think — I mean, if Dean’s okay with it — do you think we could have her over to meet him?”
The closest serving to him is frosted in pale pink; beside it is another in baby blue. Then there’s one with rainbow stripes across it. Another in violet, blue, and hot pink. Then baby blue, pink, and white. They’re —
“Your father would borrow a pickup truck from a friend at work and drive the whole family out to a Christmas tree farm and cut down one you liked. He’d try to make Pillsbury cinnamon rolls for breakfast, and burn half of them. His mother Millie would come visit for the day. For Thanksgiving, your family would go to visit her.”
“We checked,” says Sam. “It’s fine. The water stops short of it. People seem pretty puzzled by what’s going on — I think the US Geological Survey is officially saying an earthquake opened up an aquifer — but they’ve said no one was hurt. I don’t think anyone’s spotted anything truly weird yet, either.” He sighs, and runs a hand through his hair. “How’s Jack?”
So Castiel takes over. Thrusting up into Dean, stroking his cock in time — flicking a thumb over the head, rolling fingers underneath his balls, squeezing the base when he gets too close. He presses his palm to Dean’s stomach, his chest, making the blood rise there and fade — never enough to bruise. Just enough to paint Dean with his handprints, to watch the way Dean’s eyes track them in the mirror, through the daze of overstimulation — the way with each one his breath goes more ragged, the movement of his hips more urgent, his ass tighter around Castiel’s cock.
Dean’s pinned under Castiel’s still-encumbered knees. He arches to reach for Castiel’s hips again, but Castiel curls over — he feels his abs tighten — and covers Dean’s mouth with his own, an open, sloppy, possessive kiss. “Want you,” he breathes, “want —”
“Couch, mostly.” Dean checks the handwritten label on one of the tapes, and his mouth twitches in a smile. “Me and Sammy were supposed to share, back when we first moved here, but I was gettin’ home late half the time and — well. TV used to help me sleep. Got to be normal after a while.”
Castiel considers. He wants to know more; could ask more. But Dean’s not volunteering it, and he’s not sure what kind of question to formulate, so instead he says, “My family was the definition of a
He doesn’t want to pressure Cas or anything; he doesn’t want to assume. So he lingers by the door when they walk in, watching Cas move across the room. He unknots his tie, skating it smoothly between two fingers, and Dean watches, helpless. He’s pretty sure he shouldn’t be this spellbound by the play of fabric in Cas’s hands, by the way it brushes the inside of his wrist.
He writes about bouncing between motels and learning to cook what he could on hot plates, in microwaves, on the occasional beat-up range.
Dean nods vaguely. He takes another step, and the door swings loudly closed behind him. He’s moving slowly, like a man in a dream. He looks light, almost peaceful, but — drained. Hollowed out.
He bites down on his lower lip. He can’t quite make himself believe it. But he can — he can stop telling himself it’s
“I’m sorry,” he says, later, after a spell of silence on the drive back to the motel. “That I’m not better at writing, I mean. You’ve been — your letters are fucking awesome.”
There’s still so much Castiel doesn’t understand. If Michael is broadcasting any signals of revelation, he isn’t hearing them. He has no desire to return to Heaven and learn what’s transpiring there. So he has to hope — that the war of the future is being averted. That Michael is true to his word. That he won’t come back seeking Dean.
He says it like it’s a relief. Like it would be all right for his father, this man whose orders he trips to obey, to know what he’s done for survival; like the world would end if he knew what Dean’s done for joy.
When Dean pulls back, there’s a small smile on his face. He ducks in again to kiss Castiel squarely on the lips, and when he steps away, there’s mischief in his eyes. “Just in case the old man is watching.”
The insinuation doesn’t pass him by, and it’s not inaccurate. Castiel musters his dignity, even though he’s flushing all over. “At the end of it, actually. I just got out of the shower.”
” Dean breathes when they break apart, “yeah, but dude, if you’re not trying to find out if I can still make a go at round two, we’d better get dressed.”
They order wine — a bottle. Their waitress is Caitlin, Max’s mother; there aren’t many names in this town Dean doesn’t know by now. If she’s surprised to see just the two of them dining in together, she doesn’t show it. She carries the bottle to the table and uncorks it for them, pours them each a glass.
Dean is looking at him — just looking at him, with an unbearable kindness in his eyes, and Castiel can’t stand it, he
He doesn’t want any of those people as a dinner guest. The only person he wants as a dinner guest is already sitting right across from him; already told Dean last night:
his smile, can hear the wicked curl of amusement in his voice. “You all right there? I catch you in the middle of somethin’?”
But Cas isn’t done. “I also,” he says, “when I look at you right now — I see a man tired from work. And I love you for that — for the labor you give to others. For your kindness. I see that your muscles ache, and I love you, and I want to heal them. I see that you have come seeking my company, and offering yours, and I love you, and I want to take that attention and hoard it. I want you always to be looking at me.”
When Dean exits the highway and squeezes the Impala’s broad body across two lanes of bridge traffic into the left-turn lane for Castiel’s street, Castiel swallows his anxiety and asks, fingers twisting in the fabric of his jacket, “Do you have to be back tonight?”
Dean nods, apparently satisfied. Then a sudden laugh catches on the corner of his mouth; he slumps back in the bed and puts a hand over his face. “We are
“Fine,” he says, and takes a big bite of Dean’s hash browns, even though they only taste like molecules.
Dean is frozen. Cas is still staring at him. His fingertips, faintly sweaty now, are still resting on Cas’s palm.
Castiel flinches instinctively, hand flying up as if to shield his face. He stops it belatedly, cheeks burning — he’s always hated being photographed. Jo cackles, thrusts the camera back into his hands, and runs as if he’s going to chase her.
The fine trembling starts in Dean’s hands. He clenches them on his knees, as if to make it stop, but it only spreads. His shoulders are shaking. His teeth chatter, once, before he locks them together. He draws a great, hard, breath, then another.
Dean goes back into the kitchen. He pushes open the screen door and sits on the back steps; he’s pretty sure Cas knows he’s there, watching, but neither of them speaks. Cas seems focused on what he’s doing, carefully inventorying the plants along the back fence.
There is a poet who hails from somewhere on the darkened prairies stretched below him. Somewhere tucked between the rippling hills. She wrote about them once:
Claire and Cas are both frosty toward him that night. Which is some kind of bullshit, Dean thinks, given that he brought them a lead.
Jack wriggles again, and stretches out a fat little hand in a wave. “Hewwo!” he says to the plesiosaur in their shooting gallery.
His eyes are on the road, but his head still twitches a little when Castiel looks his way. He laughs, a little self-consciously, and adds, “I mean — the best. Did his homework. Straight A’s. He was joining soccer teams and, and mathletes shit faster than I could keep up. Smartest fucking kid you ever saw.” Now that he’s talking, the words seem to spill out of him, like they’ve been there, at the ready, all the time. “He didn’t really like talking to Dad about it, but he wanted to be a lawyer. And like — be a lawyer who did
It’s weird that Dean doesn’t even feel that scared of what’s about to happen. A little sad about it, maybe; this might be his last chance to delude himself into thinking this thing with Cas could be real. This might be the closest he ever comes to saying it out loud.
“Yeah.” Dean’s face cracks into a wounded, helpless smile; he shakes his head, looking down, and Castiel sees that his eyes are glittering. “Yeah, I — miss him like a fucking hole in my head. All the fucking time.”
“I just gotta,” he says, then laughs, shakily. “Just gotta keep winning.” He opens his eyes. “If I can win Calgary, then we’re good to go.”
The three of them have been sleeping in the house more often lately. It’s nice to have a morning coffee on the porch and watch the sun rise; Dean still uses the bunker kitchen for most of his cooking, but he did finally move his memory foam mattress upstairs. Jack’s starting pre-K soon; it’ll be weird having him out of the house so much. But for now, they’re spending every spare moment on the beach they can.
The morning isn’t awkward. Dean might’ve expected it to be, except he didn’t, really; that’s the funny thing about Cas. He’s awkward about things that don’t matter, but he’s perfect when they do.
They’re works of art; the twine balls, and the people who create them, and the people who preserve them, and the people who come to see. They’re a marvel both quotidian and incomprehensible; a simple thing done long enough to make something stupendous and strange. They’re the product of decades of thankless toil — and yet they’re not quite thankless. Sooner or later, if you wind enough twine, people start to care.
When they reach the pulloff, they stop and unload the horses. “Cas,” Ellen calls casually as she adjusts a buckle, “you want Daphne, or Es?”
going to keep his hands to himself. He runs one down Dean’s chest, tweaking experimentally at his nipple, and the other up his left high, marveling at the feel of the fine hair there, and Dean gasps and bucks against him and his gorgeous cock is
That’s probably not practical. “Hey,” he murmurs to Jack, “so Sam and Eileen’s house is underwater now. You got a plan for that?”
They stay on the line for another hour. Sleepy half-conversation, but neither of them is quite willing to hang up. At last Castiel says, gently, “Dean — get some rest. Sleep until noon, why don’t you, and I’ll be there when you wake up.”
“Oh my God,” says Castiel, “stop talking,” and he barely remembers to grab his phone and car keys before he goes.
Blood seeps between his fingers as he laces them through the vessel’s. But there’s no recoil; no force throwing him back. Just two men sitting on the pavement, hand in hand.
He has his hands over his ears. He’s squinting into Castiel’s light, shying away — trying to make himself small. Castiel’s voice echoes, reverberates down every frequency; the man on the TV finally shuts up, white light fuzzing him into nothing.
Dean runs across the ad by accident. He’s surfing local newspapers, scanning for something that might resemble a hunt, and he skims through the classifieds for the hell of it. Sometimes there’s fun stuff in there, chickens for sale, or even a haunted dresser.
The women are on their feet; they’re hugging each other. Then they’re hugging Cas, pulling him into their tight circle, exclaiming.
That’s one thing. But then there’s also — how does Cas’s memory work on a given Tuesday? Does he forget things? Do they get hazy with time — does he edit them without realizing? Does he ever look back and hope he said what he meant to, got the words right? Or can he pull it all up like a text message chain, a perfect record, no room for doubts?
Abruptly, he turns and strides back toward the truck. Castiel cranes his neck to see what he’s doing, but when Esmeralda shuffles restlessly beneath him, he realizes he’s pulling the reins as he turns, and relents.
Castiel smiles. “What are we telling them, then? That you begged an angel of the Lord to brand your skin during — a friendly game of pool?”
the saddle, which he’s proud not to struggle with — it’s easier than it was at age six — though a small part of his brain notes Dean standing at the ready, should he need help, and feels tempted to falter.
“Blue Earth,” Dean echoes. “Shit, that’s — we’ll be there early. Pastor Jim’s in Blue Earth, I don’t know why my dad didn’t —” He swallows. “Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let’s do it.”
Dean moves cautiously. Houses have never been home turf for him, not since he was small; usually when he’s moving through them, he’s hunting something, trying to save someone, looking for clues. He avoids the creaky steps by instinct. His fingers are light on the doorknob.
Dean cracks an eye open. “You sure you’re like — game for this? I’m not — taking advantage of — a baby in a trenchcoat or something?”
Castiel’s family Christmas trees growing up were always immaculate; he’s sure he must have made some pipe cleaner ornaments in school as a kid, but wherever they wound up, it wasn’t on public display. The Harvelles are different. There are pine cone owls with googly eyes and little feathers for wings; there are popsicle stick picture frames on strings; there are lumpy clay horses, or maybe they’re wolves, wobbling on loops of embroidery thread. They all have labels nestled in their individual cups of tissue paper, many of them in a handwriting Castiel knows by now is Bill Harvelle’s:
“Thanks,” Dean says, shaky, when he pulls back. “I — thanks.” He still looks washed out, but he doesn’t look as dazed. “Do you think — what the fuck do you think it could be? The case?”
“Didn’t mean to freak you like that,” Gabriel’s saying, crouching at his side. “Just want you to know that I know, and it’s — not a big deal. All right? I got your back, I won’t tell anyone. Thought you might like it, not carrying that secret around all the time.”
Maybe he hasn’t believed he’s actually gonna make it. Not until now. He’s going to see Sam and Jack. He’ll have to tell them that Cas is gone. How the fuck is he supposed to do that?
His shirt is a familiar one — the plaid, lavender and blue. He’s wearing it buttoned. His hair is styled carefully, his face clean-shaven, and when Castiel’s eyes finally reach his face, his lips part; his tongue flashes briefly, nervously, against the back of his teeth.
That’s what he’s got on the slate today, anyway: Grand Marnier, out of Kessler, a six-year-old mare. A little sweet, a little fiery, a “nice little dame of a horse,” the announcer is saying, and Castiel doesn’t know who still uses words like dame, but that’s fine, it’s fine. She’s a light, pretty roan, dancing in the stall, and it takes Dean longer than usual to set himself, to get his rigging on tight, but that’s fine, too. Dean knows what he’s doing. He sets himself, resets himself, shoves his hat down low and gives the terse nod that means
If the dead are options, he’s got a whole list of people he’d want to see one last time. He has experience with the dead, though. More than enough of it; raising them, putting them to rest. No. Someone living, then.
But the questions are easier this time. Dean’s not sure if that’s how they’re written or he’s just run out of fucks to give; either way, he has no problem answering. He can tell Cas some things he likes about him, no problem. He can tell him he’d like to share his record collection with someone — like to sit and listen, point out the guitar nerd shit and just soak up the words. That he did that a little with Jack, and he’s still not sure where to settle the lump of
They pack up and leave Colorado without much further delay. Castiel is anxious to get away from the scene of the vessel’s death, and Dean won’t let him use his grace to move them; he might be right about that, Castiel thinks. His grace could attract attention. Right now, with Dean hidden the way he is — they might just be able to slip away into the broad belly of America, vanish on two-lane roads.
Goddamn ghosts always disappearing while you’re talking to them. They’re as bad as angels that way. Dean rolls his eyes and starts down the hill.
But it’s a hell of a lot harder to remember that, right, when Rachel is pacing the room, asking questions like:
Dean smiles. It makes the lines around his eyes crinkle; it makes his skin look faded and thin. “Yeah,” he says. “I was.”
Castiel hasn’t yet been inside Dean and Asa’s bunkhouse. He retrieves his bag from the car and follows Dean up the steps; the moths are flitting around the yard lights, and Asa’s already disappeared to bed.
Maybe it isn’t fair. Maybe Dean’s pinning too many of his hopes, too much of his self, on one guy. It’s what he’s trained to do, after all; grew up with no one to rely on but Sam and his dad and himself. He should talk to Mia about it, probably. But he kind of already knows what he’ll say.
Cas looks startled. He opens his mouth, closes it. Then the corner of his lips lifts a little and he says, “Naomi told me once — after I stole the angel tablet — that I’d always been a spanner in the works. That there were many times they broke into my head to wash it clean.”
Dean heaves a great, final shudder, and tips his head back, and warm liquid spills over Castiel’s wrist. It’s white and pearly and Castiel feels the strange urge to taste it, but then Dean makes a desperate little sound and redoubles his own efforts, eyes still closed, and Castiel’s body feels like heaven; like he’s made of heaven, the stuff of ecstasy, and Dean’s throat is right there and bared, so he kisses it, claiming, open mouth and the slight rasp of teeth, and he spurts his own hot streaks of semen across Dean’s bare belly, his hips.
He looks up. The girl with her hand on his arm is pretty in an anonymously blonde sort of way, and it takes him a minute to place her as Jo Harvelle.
Does that mean his attraction is simple gratitude? Castiel rejects the notion almost the instant it occurs to him; that Dean is heart-stoppingly beautiful, he’s known since the moment he saw him. But he’s also
It’s got to include Cas. That’s what Dean keeps thinking, the whole drive north and west. Cas is Jack’s dad — as good as, anyway. Cas is the one Jack chose, when he hadn’t even been born yet; shit, the kid even made himself look kind of like Cas.
“Yep,” Dean agrees. He’s eating more frosting; he pops his finger out of his mouth with relish. “Named — well, the Men of Letters called her Subject B.”
“Sleep or whatever, yada yada, okay tough guy. Stare at the ceiling all night for all I care. But the bed’s plenty big enough for two.”
in there.” He shakes his head. “I mean, people are drinking and they’re smoking and they’re — they’re snorting whatever. There’s a five-hundred pound guy on stage with a mohawk just screaming. Guy who let me in points me toward this table with his friends and says I can join them, so I do.
He’s spent so much time among Dean’s family. Not his blood family, no, but the people who belong to him: Bobby, Jo, Ellen. He’s fretted over what they think of him and done his best to show them how much he cares about Dean; he’s marveled at the ease of them all together, at the way they make Dean more himself, the way they show parts of Dean that might have stayed wholly hidden. It’s been a daily privilege to be welcomed into that family. To be given that much.
That seems to startle Dean for a moment. Then he plunges on. “But I guess — the whole holidays thing, and then Sam with his date — it all made me realize. Sometimes, doing things the TV way, it lets you — I dunno. Stop worrying, and just do them instead.”
He sits back to find the lube among the sheets and squirt more onto his right hand. He stays there, though, studying Dean’s flushed chest, the minute reactions on his face as Castiel slides his fingers back in.
December in Alberta is dark and cold. Dustings of snow on the streets that never really melt, just mingle with gravel into a hard-packed gray-brown crust. Ice builds up on the Bow River, piling at its curves into mazes of broken blocks. Outside the city, the landscape is white studded with pale stubble from horizon to horizon. The mountains look like their truest selves, towering rocky and snow-mantled against the blue sky.
this strange and precious phenomenon, this vulnerability. Castiel touches Dean’s elbow, and he doesn’t respond. He touches Dean’s hand, and it curls, unconscious, into his. He touches Dean’s spine, counts the knobs of it, and when he reaches the base Dean stirs and nestles closer into his shoulder, but he doesn’t wake. So Castiel spreads a palm over his ass, daring, and loves the swell of it — he loves this man, all of him, body and soul.
Asa’s being gracious enough not to notice the tension the air. Jo’s in Calgary for the night, visiting friends. Ellen and Bobby glance at each other, a few times, as the meal gets more awkward, but leave well enough alone.
Castiel leans back to down his shot in a single gulp. As he does, out of the corner of his eye, he sees two women walking down the street. They look vaguely familiar, but it’s not until he’s set his glass back down that he places them: Emily the MRI tech, looking sleek in all-black, and the angry receptionist — Regina. She doesn’t look angry now. She’s laughing, head tipped back, hair falling around her shoulders. As they pass, Castiel sees Emily grin broadly as Regina slips her hand into her back pocket.
And then he’s gone and Dean’s alone, gasping sobs of air on the dungeon floor, and wishing he hadn’t. Listened. Wishing he could take it all back. Wishing he could just
Castiel has never been sick, not really. He’s never been hospitalized, never been seriously injured, never had much more than the common cold or a stomach flu or pneumonia, once in college. All of which was miserable, certainly, but it wasn’t — like this.
The guilt that Castiel’s managed to temporarily forget twists back into his gut with a vengeance. “My dad did.”
Castiel reaches out tentatively with his grace. And it’s not repelled this time — this time, when he tries to knit the man on the pavement back together, he succeeds.
Sometimes he thinks they should have a real home, a house, with windows, like Eileen does. Sam now, too, since he moved in. But then — he hates the idea of the bunker empty. He hates the idea of leaving the first place Cas learned to belong.
a water nymph” — and looks distinctly green until they redeposit her on shore. Then she smooths her skirt and harrumphs slightly. “The
no.” Dean chokes out an incredulous laugh, but he’s smiling as he twines his fingers with Castiel’s, pulling him closer. “Shit, sweetheart. It’s a good thing. It’s
In the morning, over coffee, Dean says, “Do you want to — take her for a drive?”, and Castiel doesn’t need to ask what they’re avoiding; he doesn’t need to hesitate before nodding yes.
Cas slides their fingers free and tilts forward to kiss Dean, hard. He removes Dean’s pants with a minimum of fuss, sliding off the bed to yank them down over his heels, and by the time he’s back Dean’s already found a condom, is already rolling it onto his cock, slicking it with lube, and Castiel catches his wrists and draws his hands away and sinks down onto him, groaning at the stretch, but not stopping, not until Dean’s buried deep inside him and flushed and panting beneath him, sweat beading on his forehead. He stays there for a moment, pinning him, and feels Dean’s hips tremble with the effort not to thrust; then Castiel smirks down at him and Dean gasps, “You absolute
“Hey, Cas. Uh, Castiel.” His voice comes out soft and choked, barely above a whisper. “I’m — I’ve never done this praying thing, so. Sorry if I’m fucking it up. I just thought —”
There are people waking up in the neighboring motel rooms, yelling in alarm. Castiel lets his light fade, but the damage is done. The night air blows through their window, hot and humid, and the AC sputters and dies. Slowly, slowly, Dean lowers his hands from his face.
“Come on, kid,” Dean’s telling Jack now, “let’s get you over to Eileen’s place, all right? She and Sam are gonna make you the
Castiel can’t explain the prickle of unease that spreads down his wings; he has heard, vaguely, of Dean Winchester’s father. Also in Hell. Cut from the same cloth — or maybe not
He means the ghosts, obviously. Though that can’t be obvious to Greta. He can feel Cas’s eyes boring into the side of his skull.
somewhere in his throat and takes Dean by the hips and flips them, so that Dean’s the one with his back in the grass, ribs arching against him, straining up to keep kissing him, desperate, like he’s not the one that took all day and failed to make a move.
“Hey.” Dean points at him warningly, which only makes Castiel laugh harder. “She needed washing anyway, you —” But he’s cut off by a fresh peal from Cas, and after a moment, finds an empty cassette box on the seat between them and throws it deftly at his head.
“What if we fuck up, though?” The fear is tight and acute in his chest. “What if we’re being too harsh? Or not harsh enough? I mean, like — my dad. He was a shitty,
His words seem to catch Dean’s attention in a way he didn’t entirely intend. Dean turns to look him full in the face, eyes searching, and Castiel realizes, with a swoop in his gut, that they’re green. They’re also
“Stay,” Castiel tells him, almost absently, levering himself off the bed. He finds the bottle he needs in Dean’s duffel, and when he turns back, Dean’s just as he left him, picture perfect — his head turned to the side to watch Castiel, eyes dazed with lust, muscles trembling.
Everyone’s looking at them. Cas with something soft in his eyes; Eileen with a small crooked smile. Sam clears his throat. “Okay. So, what now?”
“Yeah.” Dean’s voice comes out a little throaty; his fingers tighten again. “I mean — don’t get me wrong, Cas, I’m not exactly a prude over here. Third date, I am
After that, at last, the air loosens between them. The sun comes out, and with it, the conversation that’s been trapped on both their tongues. They ride side by side, Floss loping ahead of them, and Castiel tells Dean about growing up in Houston; about Dartmouth, and his friendship with Charlie; then, haltingly, sure he’s going to bore Dean, about the work he’s doing for his Ph.D.
Castiel has spent the last day winging around the country on his grace; the rumble of the Impala’s engine through the seat feels like home. He watches Dean’s hands on the steering wheel, Dean’s eyes on the road; they turn onto the ramp for the highway. Dean’s spent his whole life like this, in this car, driving from somewhere to somewhere else; Castiel wonders how many times he’s visited each twine ball. He wonders what Dean thinks about when he sees them. What pulls him back.
He receives a nod of confirmation in response. “They used to hunt buffalo here. There’s more, down the ridge.” He’s quiet for a moment, eyes on the nearest stone. “I found a cover, years back. On a bit of land we lease from the Blackfeet Nation. They paint them these incredible designs, and when they wear out, just leave them out for the sky. Let them melt back into the prairie again.”
They stop halfway home to gas up at a truck stop, and Dean ducks into the empty convenience store to find something with caffeine. There’s pop music playing, still, over tinny speakers.
“Anyway. This vessel you were talking about.” Dean turns back to his paper. “Think I tracked him down, though it wasn’t easy — I was looking for someone who died bloody, ‘cause, well, you know. But then I figured, if Cas can heal
Of course. It makes sense that Ellen doesn’t just oversee the ranch; she must spend plenty of time on horseback herself. And Esmeralda may tolerate Castiel well enough, but she’s undoubtedly used to working with a much more talented rider.
Then Dean is there, hand ghosting briefly across Castiel’s back before the contact disappears. “Hey, I’m beat. See you boys tomorrow?”
Dean’s body feels warm all over. Like Cas’s gaze is a physical thing. Feels it drop to his lips, his shoulders; feels it skate over his chest. He swallows.
With his free hand, Castiel touches Dean’s lower lip — presses it to his teeth, watching it pink and swell, then hooks a fingertip inside to touch the flat of his tongue. Dean tries to close his mouth and suck on it, but Castiel grips his chin, refusing; “Keep talking.”
Cas yawns. This has been a thing with him lately; he claims to not need sleep, but the more his powers dwindle, the more Dean catches him dozing in the bunker library, or once, passed out cold in his own bedroom, face down in the pillow. That one scared the shit out of Dean, got him in there half-straddling Cas shaking him before Cas turned over, blinking owlishly and demanding Dean get
She doesn’t do any of those things, though. She just drops her chin and closes her eyes. After a few long minutes, she releases him, smile warm, and says, “Thank you.”
“Hey, Cas,” he manages, and his voice barely wobbles; he’s proud of himself. “We were thinking maybe — get back on the Disney horse?”
He dispels the image with a flutter of paranoia. It’s bad luck, to imagine so boldly; it must be. He hugs his arms around himself and tempers his thoughts.
Castiel cups his hands around the back of Dean’s neck. He touches their foreheads together. “Pray it to me. If you can’t speak — try praying it. In your head.”
He’s too lost in his thoughts to notice that the man across the room is moving again, muttering in his sleep, until it’s too late.
Besides — he doesn’t want to interrupt this. Cas looks happy. The women’s eyes are glued to the feeder, but they keep murmuring to each other and smiling. One of them puts her hand on the other’s arm.
There are even more people there than before, a few families with children that Castiel thinks he might recognize from the rodeo. He hangs close to Dean’s side at first, unsure of himself, but then Bobby jerks his chin at him and barks something, and at Dean’s encouraging nod, Castiel hurries over.
Cas clears his throat. “You’re also not — our actual daughter,” he says in an undertone, leaning forward. “But we both care deeply for you, and we want you to know that — if this change is at all difficult for you —”
Castiel writes to Dean — he can’t seem to stop writing to Dean, even when he’ll see him before he sends his next letter —
The woman in the doorway has straight brown hair with streaks of gray and a hard, determined mouth. In spite of that, there’s a startling kindness in her eyes.
“It’s not,” Castiel counters, and the words break the dam on the grief welling up inside him. He finds that he’s crying, hot tears on his cheeks. He says, again, “It’s
But there’s got to be a line. Cas knows the stuff from — from before he raised Dean. The stuff after — that’s different. It’s got to be.
the answer is yes. But there’s a more pressing question, and Castiel moves to test it even as he asks, “Do humans experience it too? This — this feeling?”
That’s not true. He’s sure it isn’t. He explained Cas to Mom, after all; Charlie was always asking about Cas. With Charlie, though, with Mom, he never wanted to — let on too much. He didn’t want them asking questions he didn’t want to answer. And now that “too much” is where he’s
Dean says he doesn’t remember the dreams. Eventually, Cas believes him, mostly because the blank space seems to haunt him; mostly because Dean seems to hate being tormented by something he can’t see.
“And Garth and his family,” says Sam. “They’re — I mean, they’re grateful for everything they have, right? They don’t take anything for granted. No wonder, after what they’ve been through.”
“Nah, I think we’re good,” Dean starts to say, but the other cowboy grips his shoulder and gives it a shake, grinning over at Cas to say, “Dean sucks at pool, c’mon man, you gotta cheer Dustin up after his shit day. Let him beat you at
Cas casts a sidelong look over at him. “Well,” he says slowly, “I was talking to one of the staff members, and she said the birds are more active in the evening. We could take our binoculars and go looking.”
know. Like, Mia thinks — Mia says I maybe got fucked up as a kid, like I started thinking it was about what I could do for people and they’d leave if I couldn’t or — I guess also if I could, and then I never really stopped. But you never left. Or — you did, I guess, but you always came back.”
It’s not really a sore subject between them, not anymore. Jack seems happy with his new role presiding over Heaven. But Dean still feels — he doesn’t know. He’s got a lot to make up for with Cas about that. More than he ever really can.
We taught ourselves so much of this shit. It’s easy to forget, right? Doesn’t feel that special when you’re doing it every day. But — Dean, you remember what I said to you after the first Trial? Back at that ranch?”
After breakfast, they go to the bait shop. “Hey, Clarence,” says the guy behind the counter, and Cas tugs Dean closer to his hip and says, “This is the friend I was telling you about. Who inspired me to learn about fishing.” Then, an instant later, he corrects himself: “Boyfriend.”
“Cas goes free. That’s my condition.” Dean swallows, and Castiel hears a roar in his ears that isn’t from Michael’s grip on his grace; that’s from the sound of his world tumbling into dust. “You don’t hurt him. You send him back to his own time. You wipe his memory of — of all this. And I’ll say yes.”
Castiel approaches the front desk anyway, but just by the look on the face of the woman sitting there, he knows she’s the same one he spoke to on the phone. She gives him a narrow look over her glasses, and directs him to the chairs in the lobby.
Because it’s shocked, but it’s also heated; because Cas’s voice just dropped a full goddamn octave. Because Cas just walked into Dean’s bedroom and saw him touching himself and stopped dead — and didn’t turn around.
She smiles, a little softer. “About five years. My mother and I started it. She would be here, but she’s recovering from hip surgery. I don’t usually talk about that, actually — I like to keep the focus on the participants — but I was adopted. She and I went through some hard times about it, and came out stronger.”
Castiel stares at his beer. He has no idea what just happened. He should go. It’s a long drive back to Calgary.
Anyway. Ghost towns; they mean that kind of place, sometimes, but more often they mean something a lot more dressed-down. A few old foundations, maybe, and some grave stones vanishing into the prairie. A single adobe building still standing at the end of a thirty-mile road. That kind of thing. They’re mining towns, mostly, at least in Arizona — sometimes military outposts. They filled up with people digging for gold, or copper, or silver, and when the ore ran out, the people vanished away again.
all of him, and he’s so breathless with it that he doesn’t realize it’s Dean in the chute, Dean in the dust and the sun and the sky, until it’s all over and Dean’s jogging out of the arena and the announcer is declaring, “An eighty-seven-point ride for Dean Winchester, which puts him pretty near untouchable, and boy was that a pretty one!”
and they’re somewhere south of Edmonton, the last chords fading out and Castiel thinking he should reach to turn the tape over, as Dean doesn’t seem to have noticed, when Dean says suddenly, “He was a good kid.”
They’re nearly home — if a building they’re squatting in counts as “home” — when Dean’s phone rings.
He only got cleared by his doctor this morning, and he’s been humming all day with it. Cas knows he’s been visiting the horses daily, brushing them with slow strokes until their coats gleam, murmuring against their noses, but — this is different.
“Only if you teach me,” Castiel answers, and smiles himself back to the bathroom to retrieve his clothes.
It isn’t much. Just a feeble attempt to sit up, thwarted immediately by the EMTs. It’s something, though, and the crowd has seen it too, their collective exhale audible in the still air.
Before Dean can answer, there’s the sound of a keycard in their door, and it swings open. Dean has his gun half out of the back of his jeans, but it’s only Claire, grinning wide. “I already distracted the clerk and copied your key. Good thing, too — they’ve got us kids in a whole separate building. We’ll need someplace to meet.”
In the morning, Dean makes pancakes. Might as well get your toddler god in a good mood before you ask him to start destroying his creations.
The first puppy opens its eyes on September 5th, the last on September 10th. They move the cattle down from their summer range on September 19th, and Castiel rides in the line again, watches Floss, ears pricked, already back to work.
The sliver of his brother’s face he can see over Jack’s shoulder is mortified — miserable. “I’m sorry, Dean, I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, I just —”
It takes Cas a while to answer. Dean wonders if he’s thinking, too, about that dock by a lake in a dream — a decade ago now. More. “I have,” he eventually says.
Then, abruptly, his shoulders go still; after a moment, they sag. When he turns to face Castiel, his eyes are glittering with fury and defeat. “You’re not gonna. Are you.”
“I mean it,” he says, less formally. “It’s — humbling, seeing all these people come together. I was talking to Sheriff Mills —” he nods his head at the no-nonsense woman who showed up half an hour ago in full uniform and is currently assembling a salad “— and Rufus Turner. The whole town comes out to these.”
“I see,” Mia says. Her voice is dry. It’s impossible to tell if he’s startled her or not. “Well — I think it might work best to circle back to the God question. Why don’t you tell me about this relationship, first?”
He tells stories of nighttime raids. Of thrilling chases — of fights with the Apache. Of the off nights, drinking and laughing; he tosses out famous names like they’re nothing. He talks about rounds of cards and target practice, about singing by the campfire, spending their money in the boomtowns that flared and died over the years — Bisbee, Tombstone, Willow Creek. “‘Course Willow Creek was different,” he says, “because it was an Army town, and a
Dean’s rigid posture wavers, for a moment, then melts, seeking his warmth. “Do you think,” he says, and then, “after dinner?”, and it takes Cas a moment to realize he’s talking about Ellen and Bobby.
If his behavior discomfits Dean, he doesn’t show it. He just glances back to the west, adjusting his hat. “Yeah, well. No time today. I gotta get back.”
“There’s got to be some catch to this,” he observes lazily, marveling at the fact that he’s allowed to stroke his thumb over Dean’s shoulder. “You’re an internationally wanted criminal. You’re secretly the prince of — Azerbaijan.”
“I need to hide you.” Castiel’s not sure when he stood, how he moved across the room, but he’s standing before Dean now — kneeling before him, reaching out to place his palms on Dean’s ribs. “Hold still.”
It’s remarkable that Sam’s face can turn an even stranger color. “I, uh — yes, I guess. One-night things.”
Castiel groans into the kiss, his body straining at once for Dean’s touch, and when Dean laughs again he swallows it, fisting his hands in Dean’s shirt, hauling him close. Dean lets him, falling into Castiel as he pulls his shirt free of his jeans and slides his hands underneath it. He stills when Castiel drops his head to scrape his teeth over the pulse in his neck, but is moving again a moment later as Cas returns to his mouth, too fixated to stay away for long. Somehow, despite the tight press of their bodies, Dean’s hand slips down between their bodies to Castiel’s belt, deftly unbuckling it and thumbing open the button to his jeans, and he’s nearly got Castiel’s fly unzipped before Castiel manages to catch his wrist in one hand.
If Chuck can pull Lucifer and Lilith out of the Empty, then Jack — God-powered Jack — could do the same.
and not only to Castiel. He makes him laugh. He took him to see a coral reef. He washed his damn car.
Dean winces again, like he’d like to protest, but he doesn’t. He sits very still as Castiel touches his forehead, his shoulder.
“Of course,” says Cas, and he follows Dean into the house; he wishes him good night at his bedroom door.
It takes longer than he thinks it should. The glare of the sun off the white-coated roof forces him to squint out at the horizon; from here, it’s a low, wooded bluff, unremarkable. Hidden below it somewhere is the sluggish Vermilion River. When the air conditioner groans to life beneath them, Castiel jumps, but Dean doesn’t budge. A pair of starlings speeds by, swerving around the corner of the building.
He doesn’t expect Dean’s eyes to widen, or for a heartbeat of silence to pass before he breathes, in a voice that scratches in his throat: “That could be arranged.”
“Yeah. When Lucifer killed you. Before Jack brought you back. I was — that’s when we met her, you know.”
Cas reaches out to touch his temple. “Yes, but it’s exhausting you. Sooner or later, you’ll lose control. You need to put them back, Jack.”
Dean blinks up at him, raw and wanting. His emotions are tangled and easy to read, right there on the surface, on the verge of a prayer — lust and shame and a craving for approval, a craving for
“All right,” Dean interrupts, “come on, then,” and when he starts across the yard again, Castiel has no choice but to follow.
His voice comes out gruff. There are tears in his eyes. His chest hurts, but it’s singing, too; singing with some emotion he can’t name.
Dizzy warmth surges through Castiel’s chest. He tips his head back, drawing Dean down for a kiss. “Do you want to?”
He finds immediately that he loves this. The way Dean’s eyes follow his hand, hungry and awed; the way he can use Dean’s rhythm, the brushes of sparks across his prostate, building and quelling and building again. He swipes precome off the head of his cock with his thumb, and at Dean’s intake of breath, raises it to his mouth; Dean’s eyes close as he sucks hungrily on Castiel’s fingers, one after another. His body is shaking with effort by the time Castiel drops his hand again, and Castiel applies himself in earnest, throwing his head back against the wall and jacking himself hard.
“Hello,” he tells the woman wiping down the bar. “I’m looking for a man.” How to describe Dean? “He’s — very beautiful. With green eyes.”
It’s a box set of Humphrey Bogart movies on DVD. Twenty-four of them, says the cover. “For the rig,” Anna explains. “You can say that — HR sent them or whatever. They got an anonymous complaint.”
To his surprise, Dean also has an envelope for him. He flushes when he presses it into Cas’s palm — “It’s not much,” he says. “Just — well.”
“Hey,” he says. “You down to ride Esmeralda? Help us round ‘em up? Asa says he thinks you’re good for it.”
“Dean Winchester,” he says, “I have loved you in a thousand crappy motel rooms. And I mean to love you in a thousand more.”
In this small human form, it’s a taste in his mouth; it’s a scent on the air. It’s the rhythm that beats the dance of atoms, the key that twists wavelengths of light. It’s the burn of ozone after a lightning strike. It’s the clap of thunder that might be Castiel’s father’s voice.
For a moment, Cas looks confused; then his expression clears. “But you want experience with just-dating first.”
His officemate Hannah asks how it’s going that week, their first sociable exchange in a month; when he answers, startled, that he’s well, she smiles at him and tells him he looks happy. Rowena takes one look at him in their lab meeting on Tuesday and raises her eyebrows with a knowing smile; mercifully, she confines her comment to a broad Scots innuendo as he’s on his way out, to which he blushes and does not reply.
Then there’s Dean’s hands on his skin — Dean’s mouth. He doesn’t give Castiel a chance to shrug off his layers of shirt-jacket-trenchcoat completely, just gets them unbuttoned and burrows inside, breath hot on the heat of Castiel’s skin. He tongues Castiel’s throat, his clavicle; his hands are working on Castiel’s belt.
“Grace. That’s your power, right? What you used to heal me? You dumb fuck.” The insult sounds strangely affectionate. “Does it — will it come back?”
When Dean tries to move him back under the showerhead, though, Castiel doesn’t let him. He sinks to his knees instead, letting the spray beat the top of his skull, and takes Dean’s half-hard dick in his mouth. He blows him like that, with water running down his face, over his lips, and guides Dean’s hands to his hair when he tries to flatten them against the tile. Dean is kneading Castiel’s scalp in time with his strokes by the time he comes, soft and gasping, and Castiel swallows it down.
That’s what Castiel will piece together later, punishing himself, watching the footage in slow motion, over and over again. Now, he only sees that the mare doesn’t leap right and Dean is off her back and then she’s clear and bucking, her hoof catching Dean’s chest and slamming him back against the bars, and there’s blood, so much blood, and Dean’s not moving, just a crumpled heap, leather splayed out around him, and Castiel can’t see if he’s all right, he doesn’t know if Dean is even
Shifters. Demons. Hell, hallucinations. There isn’t a person he loves he hasn’t seen with something alien puppeting their body — something evil. He’s been testing his own damn family since he was practically a kid with holy water and silver.
Gabriel and Kali have already plated it in individual servings, Castiel knows; they also brought a blowtorch for the “final caramelization.” But since the last time Castiel saw it, something’s happened to the marshmallow meringue.
Content warnings: this chapter involves Castiel grappling with his feelings & responses to his family's homophobia. Also, a very brief oblique reference to an eating disorder.
“I’d like to talk to you again between now and then,” Mia’s saying. “I realize we haven’t gotten into the God question at all, and I suspect it’s something we could work on for many sessions together, but we can at least discuss your immediate concerns this week. Is that something you want to do?”
He seems to have run out of words to say. A few minutes ago, he felt like he could talk about Cas forever, and now he’s caught in nothingness — stuck on those awful weeks without him.
But his words make something in Dean crumple. He looks down, and he bites his lip. “Right. Yeah. I mean, I get it. I’m sorry.”
“I am — in,” Castiel repeats, careful. The atmosphere in the Impala feels taut, though not unpleasantly so; Dean seems almost — shy. Castiel understands that. They’re in each other’s company by choice this time. It feels like delicate new ground.
It’s been a long time since Castiel’s shared a bed with someone. He’s never once shared a bedroll under an open, starry sky.
The room is clouded with steam, but Castiel can see Dean through the translucent windows in the shower curtain. He’s standing with his head down, motionless, spray beating on his skull; Castiel can’t see his face.
On the drive back, they roll the windows down. Dean half-shouts along to his favorite Metallica songs. Cas knows a surprising amount of the words.
The quiet mood between them lingers all the next day. It persists through breakfast, and the remaining rides, and the ceremony where Dean’s handed a five-thousand-dollar winner’s check, which he folds carefully and tucks inside his wallet; it persists through the first few hours of their drive, through
When Cas explains about Dean’s theory, Sam has questions. “So — this plesiosaur fossil. You think it was
He makes an undignified squawk when Dean pulls him off the counter, legs still locked around his back, but Dean’s bracing him, carrying him, and Castiel holds on for dear life. “Directions?” Dean asks politely, swaying just a little at the center of his entryway, and Castiel manages, “Straight back, second door on the left, don’t
He could have run earlier. He could have run when Castiel was asleep, exhausted; his ribs weren’t marked yet, so Castiel would have found him, but Dean might have tried it nonetheless. He could have distracted Castiel at any point, slipped away like he did in Des Moines. He didn’t.
There’s no doubt about it from this distance. Dean’s blushing deeply, his gaze on his hands where they still hold the stick. His shoulders are turned toward Castiel, but his head is low, in profile, and when he glances up to meet Castiel’s eyes, he quickly looks away.
A wave of hot rage surges out of nowhere, and leaves Castiel’s lungs tight and aching. He looks around for something he can punch, tear, destroy; there’s nothing. He clenches his fingers hard in the fabric of his jeans.
Dean’s an idiot for not thinking of that earlier. Cas’s deal was to save Jack’s life; he must have been there. He must have heard the whole thing. He must have been carrying this, for months — for
He’s only been home for a few days when Dean’s caller ID appears on his phone for the second time in as many weeks. This time, Castiel is in the shower; he misses it. When he sees the missed call alert flashing on the nightstand, his heart beats faster.
And then there are the holidays. Castiel isn’t sure what brought this on, but he knows Dean’s been nesting lately — redecorating his room, cooking as often as he can. He can tell there’s something Dean isn’t telling him, and he wonders if it’s maybe — maybe there isn’t a place for Castiel in all this. Maybe Dean’s trying, too hard, to convince them both that there is.
Dean makes Castiel sketch the warding sigils on a piece of paper for him — the same ones that are on his ribs. Then he copies them, in white paint, around the interior of the Impala’s trunk;
“What’s your favorite cowboy song?” he asks, curious; it seems like the kind of thing Dean would have an opinion on.
He loves his new little porch, even with its questionable doormat that seems to hold rainwater for weeks at a time; he loves the uneven sidewalk he’ll have to shovel and the overgrown hedge. He loves the jackrabbits that hunch like quiet boulders in the yard, some mornings, and take off at the first sign of the neighbors’ cat.
Okay. There’s a lump in Dean’s throat; he nods. He knew that, it’s not like he didn’t know that, he’s just —
Castiel hates him. Michael is his commanding officer, and Castiel hates him; that one thought gasps for air through the fog in his brain. The blade is still in Michael’s hand, held loosely by his side. Only an archangel can kill another archangel, that’s how the stories go, but maybe — maybe, if Castiel had his blade —
Dean accelerates again. Gravel crackles under their wheels. The world feels more hushed now, though, heavy with anticipation. The night air is growing just a little bit cold.
Castiel steps back to make way, but the last of them stops in her tracks, catching his arm. “Castiel!”
Then he yawns. Abruptly, the weariness of the last day and a half hits him. The fizzing nervous energy in his chest feels easy enough, finally, to let him sleep.
His grip recovered, Dean holds the blade carefully in both hands; he tests the balance of it, the sharpness of the edge. If he’s aware he could turn and stab Castiel right now, he doesn’t acknowledge it; his Adam’s apple bobs. He passes the blade back.
Castiel obeys. And then Dean is gone again, and they’re moving out, Bobby in the lead: a long, straggling line across the prairie.
“Thank you,” Castiel tells him. Dean’s lips are parted and pink and shining, and Castiel feels the urge to press two fingers against the lower one, so he does, smearing come there too; Dean’s eyes flutter closed, and he sways into Castiel’s touch.
Dean is staring around with his face tight, throat working like a fist, and there aren’t any memories Castiel’s going to bring up that aren’t already there.
Michael looks down. “Adam? Say yes, and the same will go for him. He’ll remember none of this. Say no, and — well. I might leave him ruined. I might just keep him.”
Dean takes the wheel over Sam’s protestations. Sam’s wrong; he isn’t still drunk. He’s just — well, he feels loose. Almost giddy. He feels like anything could happen. After all, what more do they have to lose?
“No need to thank me,” says Dean, but he looks beyond pleased with himself as he turns to Daphne’s saddlebags.
He returns to the bunkhouse instead and, with nothing more to distract him, opens the door to Dean’s room.
“Oh, no no no.” Dean shifts out of the way to make room as the waitress deposits their plates in front of them; then he shifts back and points at Castiel with his fork. “No. You are
Claire shrugs. “I dunno. Hang tight.” She grins suddenly. “Maybe I can lure it in. You’ll be the bait.”
“Yeah. I mean — yeah.” There’s something brittle in Dean’s smile. “He keeps looking at me in the rearview mirror and — not saying anything, just looking. Gets us back to the hotel and pretty much carries me up the stairs and dumps me in the bathroom. Spent the whole night barfing. Sam woke up and asked what was wrong with me, what happened, and Dad said I did something stupid and he had to go get me, and —” he sucks in a breath “— I blew up at him. Like I was still scared as hell, and ashamed, and I just — started yelling. About how he’d — embarrassed me. I told him I hated him.”
Castiel can’t remember if she’s used his nickname before. “I’m not sure what we’re talking about here,” he tells her frankly, because he isn’t.
“It’s, um. Nice to meet you,” Dean says, striving for a semblance of dignity. Castiel slips a hand beneath his shirt, tracing the line of his hip. “Cas has told me a lot — about you —”
The humans will identify it anyway. They can do that now, Castiel knows; they’ve developed technologies for reading their own DNA. The watchman will be missed, and the stain on the pavement will be the obvious answer. They’ll take a sample. It’ll be confirmed.
The Silver Maple Dining Room turns out to be separated from the main building by a stone terrace, a half-flight of steps down. There are a few metal tables set out in the dappled sunlight, some of them occupied by other couples. Eyes follow Cas and Dean as they pass. Dean shifts uncomfortably so that the back of his knuckles brush Cas’s.
Still, he went out with a few other women in college, until finally his friend Charlie sat him down to tell him in no uncertain terms that he was gay, and should stop trying to pretend otherwise. She laid out a thoroughly researched case complete with photos of all his secret — he’d thought — crushes, and Castiel had his first panic attack and rode in an ambulance with an annoyed EMT, and Charlie apologized about fifty times and somehow made the insurance paperwork go away so his parents would never see the bill and ask.
He sits on the ledge and watches Dean below him. He’s turned the horses loose, apparently unconcerned that they might wander, and is tossing scraps to Floss as he prepares something in a broad pot that sits directly in the fire. The shadow of the hill is creeping toward the little camp; summer at northern latitudes means long days, but it’s nearly seven in the evening, all the same.
He can see himself reflected in Cas’s eyes — his own unshielded gaze. He looks a little soft, a little overwhelmed. A little bit — the corner of his mouth quirks, the skin around his eyes crinkles — a little bit helplessly happy.
They go out for burgers at the local bar. It’s got a mechanical bull; Dean thinks about riding it for Cas. Showing off. He’s not really in the mood for it, though. Maybe they’ll be here again sometime.
Dean only has to shift his hand a few inches to brush against Cas’s. He feels Cas go still — then slowly turn his palm up. A question.
Claire’s in their room when they get back, perched across the armchair with her ankles crossed, flipping through a pamphlet of activities.
They’re all still looking at him. Dean knows his face is red. He hates this; he fucking hates this —
He’s aware that his usual garb is reasonably dressed up, by human standards. More dressed up than Dean’s. He could — well, he could try to get
“Will he be able to ride?” he asks, because it’s suddenly come crashing down on him. This isn’t just about Dean, though it should be; it’s about
“Sounds fun,” Dean deadpans. “Okay. If you’re fucking off anyway, what do you need me for? Ditch the kid, squeegee our brains, see you later. Never, preferably. Why do I gotta say yes?”
“I remember,” Castiel tells him. “You can’t, from here. My windows face north. But I can see it in the building across the street. It’s all glass, top to bottom. Like a giant mirror.”
There’s the way he sheds his leather coat before he climbs on, shrugging and letting it fall off his shoulders and draping it over the nearest chair. He pulls his necklace off, too, the golden charm catching briefly on his forehead, and slips it in the pocket of the coat. Then there’s the way his fingers flex on the handle at the bull’s shoulders, testing the grip, and the easy swing of one leg over its back.
Sometimes Castiel thinks Dean’s just happy. He’s got Jack, they’re all safe; he has everything he wants. It’s nothing more complicated than that.
Dean rides an 88. He’s third on the day, and happy with it; the draws favored his competitors. For a first step toward something so momentous, it doesn’t feel much different from a regular weekend, a regular score. Castiel takes him out to dinner to celebrate, and Dean lets him, and at ten they pick up Charlie from the airport. She flings her arms around both their necks in turn and interrogates Dean for the whole drive back downtown, about his ride and rodeo and rules and mechanics, and Castiel learns half a dozen things he didn’t know before.
His fantasies of Dean, already an agreeable standby, are quickly becoming part of the fabric of his daily thoughts. They invade his dreams, too, more and more insistently filthy, until it strikes him that it will be quite difficult to look the man himself in the face without blushing from the roots of his hair to his toes.
when he unbuckles his belt and splits open his fly and works his jeans down over his hips and slips his fingers into the dense curls surrounding Castiel’s cock.
Maybe he’ll be able to find out more with a deep dive into historic newspapers, or a visit to the local library. But that’s a project for another day.
“Food goes in here, please,” Hester calls to him, and Castiel turns to follow her. He sets down his burdens on the kitchen table next to Kali’s.
He keeps glancing up at Castiel as he works. It’s hard to tell what’s in his mind; his eyes are assessing, lingering, almost as if he’s reassuring himself that Castiel’s still there. Or maybe he’s trying to catch a glimpse of his own fate — maybe he’s searching for a hint of Jimmy Novak in Castiel’s face.
Castiel considers his next words carefully. “Your father is — not an impartial observer. He might expect to see the worst in Sam.”
For a moment, Castiel thinks he’s going to need assistance. His cheeks turn red, then redder; then he holds up a hand and reaches for another long gulp of wine. He meets Castiel’s eyes weakly, looks for a moment like he’s going to say something, then shakes his head and returns to his pizza.
That makes Dean laugh, tipping his head back; he looks beautiful like that, Castiel thinks. “Got froglets down, but can’t say tadpoles? That’s all right, kid. Let’s get a look at them. You gonna show ‘em off at daycare?”
As they emerge back into the sunshine Dean elbows him. “So,” he says, “you wanna do the drop tower?”
When he gets there, though, it’s quiet. Dean sits for a few minutes and thinks; then he goes and gets material to build a tripod over the well, a hook and a bucket and a dipper for scooping out water.
One hand on Dean’s hip to guide him, the other propping himself up on the blanket, and Dean goes with him, falling onto his back with a gentle
Castiel can’t quite hide the fond, ludicrous smile that spreads across his face. As if there was any question of doing anything else.
Castiel doesn’t stay the night — he’s behind on work, for one thing, and he also feels some vague sense of propriety, like he’s come courting and shouldn’t overstay his welcome, push Dean’s family too far. He’s pretty sure Dean would laugh at him, if he put it like that, but he’s not entirely convinced he’s wrong. When he’s saying his goodbyes, Bobby stumps down from the porch to gruffly shake his hand. Jo gives him a hug, and Asa bobs his head, tipping his hat. Ellen just raises her beer with a smile.
