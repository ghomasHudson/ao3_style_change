My gaze shifted over to Dean, who was also looking at me, his eyes narrowed slightly, as if he was trying to look right through me. When he noticed my eyes on him, he cracked a small smile and winked.
It was Castiel who finally asked the first question, and if only to avoid talking about his own life. It wasn't particularly exciting, he had to admit. And rather lonely, honestly.
"My name is not Gabriel and I do not work in customer service," he announced soberly. Dean turned his head back towards him.
"I mean, where will I go?" Cas elaborated. "Will I... Can I stay with you?"
"Yes. I cannot tell you how long we were standing in the hall. It could have been a few days only or months, but after a while, some men closed the covers on a few of us and made us climb into vans. We were around forty persons per van and it was rather small. Uncomfortable. We drove for hours."
"Please," I begged, clutching to his shirt and pulling him closer. "Need you," I whispered and Dean's breath quickened, lips attacking my mouth, tongue parting my lips eagerly. I'd never really been kissed before but Dean didn't seem to care that I was clumsy,
Sam came back in the afternoon and joined Dean on the couch, while Cas was still busy playing with the Rubik's cube. The look Sam sent him when he noticed was curious and a little confused, but after he traded a glance with Dean, who shrugged carelessly, Sam decided it didn't matter.
I suppose this is a special occurrence though.
He turned around so his back was facing Sam and Dean, and took off his shirt. He heard Dean breathe out in surprise and looked down on himself self-consciously. Everything appeared to be normal on his front, chest and abdomen toned and human-looking, but he had no way to know what he looked like from behind.
Dean had never fled before, had never been to the Official Omega System Facility before, but he knew what they were like. When they had first found him they had taken him to the Official Installations of Colleges of the Omega System. And they were the same as here.
And Dean was ready to give that back.
As a precaution, he moved away from the road, behind the trees. He didn't want to try his luck again. He had no idea where he was, or even what day it was. He tried to keep out of sight as he walked.
"I’m not hiding anyone. I only gave refuge to an Omega in need… ”Castiel started to say, but nobody seemed to listen to what he was saying.
"Did you call the System?" Dean asked instead, in a trembling voice.
He could have talked to Charlie about it, his friend and co-worker, but he knew she would go crazy when he told her that he had rescued an Omega from the street, and in two minutes he would have her in his living room trying to ask Dean questions, something that would not help the situation at all.
The Omega watched him for a few more seconds, with those green eyes confused but still very bright. Then he dropped his head against the wall, and his arms fell to his side. He suddenly surrendered, and Castiel knew he was surrendering, deciding to trust him because he had no more choices.
"But I didn't do anything" Dean tried to defend himself, resuming the march.
"You don't have to hit him! He has not resisted! ” Castiel screamed, but to no avail, the two men continued to beat Dean until he was hugging his own body on the ground, his sobs barely audible amid the yells of the others.
"Charlie, I need you to accompany me on a trip, it is urgent. I promise to tell you everything on the way" he explained, stopping in the middle of the apartment.
He held the gel and opened it, extracted as little as possible and applied it to his feet. They were swollen and very sore, but Castiel was right, the green gel had a strange sedative and relaxing power. In seconds he began to feel that he could move his feet without much pain, which was a relief.
"What hurts the most?" Alpha asked without taking his eyes off of him.
"My name is Castiel," the Alpha offered with a slight smile. "I helped you at the service station when that Alpha tried ..." Castiel let the sentence die in the air, looking like he struggled with the words.
It was a lot of information, the story was way different than it had actually  been, and Dean wished he had a notebook to write down what he should and shouldn’t say. But he knew it was impossible.
It was what he did. He waited a few seconds, but he was nervous about keeping the Alpha waiting. But this Alpha did not smell upset or angry. Castiel still smelled as tranquil  as before.
"Can I enter alone? Please?" Dean asked looking at the wood on the floor under his feet, holding his breath for a few seconds, not knowing what the alpha’s reaction would be.
"Please, don't do call, I'll do whatever you want ..."
"Okay, it's your choice and I won't object to that," she agreed, then looked back at him, her gaze more intense. "I hope you're doing the right thing."
"Come on!" the Alpha shouted, already angry again.
She looked at Charlie for approval, but all she found was her friend's face creased with doubt.
“You were disoriented, you didn't know where you were until you were with me and feeling better. You told me where you were from and I was trying to help you return,” Castiel continued narrating the story. "This is important too."
He debated whether or not he should tell Dean. But if they were going to do it the Omega had to be aware of everything.
Castiel considered the possibility for a few seconds. He wanted to help Dean find a brother, and free him from Alastair, and perhaps doing it by illegal means was not a bad idea.
"You are burning up " Castiel whispered, visibly concerned.
"Dean!" corrected the one in front of Dean, still holding his shoulders.
"I have to ask you, please ..." the manager began, taking Dean's free arm.
Castiel raised his eyes to her. He felt his heart tighten in his chest.
"What is the name of the Omega?" He questioned, calm, like someone who just got up and has all the time in the world.
He suddenly opened his eyes and sat up on the bed quickly. His breathing was agitated and he brought a trembling hand to his chest trying to calm down.
"You can't be nervous. I'm going to help you, I will. I swear," Castiel emphasized, clenching his jaw, and fixing his blue eyes on Dean, who had even forgotten to keep his gaze down.
She watched him until Castiel nodded, and when she was sure he wasn't going to come out screaming again she released him and started walking towards the Alpha.
Dean lo miró por un momento. Curioso, intrigado y un poco asustado. Alpha estaba comiendo la misma sopa que él, así que si tenía algo que los hiciera dormir, ambos se quedarían dormidos ... pero tal vez no tenía nada y solo quería demostrárselo a Dean. La idea parecía inusual. ¿Por qué este alfa molestaría tanto? ¿Por Dean? ¿Una segunda categoría Omega?
Sam doesn't react as expected.
"Can you kiss me?" I therefore asked and Castiel looked down at me sympathetically.
I needed it.
"The ladder I bought here tipped over while I was on it and I fell down and now my fucking back hurts," he explained whiningly, touching his lower back in demonstration, and his face distorted into a painful grimace.
, right? "I've been talking to -- somebody and it got me thinking, and when I asked Mom later, she--" I rambled but Benny interrupted me.
They ate up in silence, until Sam came back from the bathroom, fully dressed and with damp hair. He had his car keys in hand and stole some of Dean's food, which Dean only commented with a scandalized, "Hey!"
"Come on," Dean repeats and pushes me in the right direction. I whimper quietly but do as he says. There's no use in protesting anyway.
Responsive as he always was, Dean turned out to love bottoming way more than either of them had expected, causing their roles in bed to reverse immediately. From then on, Dean was the one getting fucked into oblivion and Castiel got to experience what it felt like to be inside Dean's body. He liked it a lot better that way as well.
I smile at the warmth in Dean's voice. His brother is the only person he talks about with such open love and affection, and it makes me feel warm just hearing about it. It reminds me of my own family.
It was our secret...
I didn't ask how he found out. Just like always. I just assumed he had his ways.
"N-No thanks," I stuttered, trying to get to my room quickly. So far, I'd managed to stay out of his way, but it was getting more and more difficult as time went by.
Just for the fun of it, he set the box down in the teleporter and pressed the button. It appeared on the other side -- red.
Suddenly the lips are gone, leaving me aching for more, and the beautiful face is looking down at me smugly, dick still pushing in and out of me relentlessly. I feel so amazing it's almost unnatural.
"No. I suppose we didn't," she mumbled and I could see resignation and guilt behind her indifferent facade. "Well then. Mac and cheese it is," she said.
"Come to bed with me?" he asked and tried his most convincing smile. Cas looked at him, surprised. "We could touch some more?" he offered cheekily.
"Alright, Charles," was all Castiel said.
He sets the plate on the floor in front of my bed, as if I'm a dog that needs to be fed, but I don't care and simply sit down on the floor to grab the dry piece of bread. It's not much but it's better than nothing.
Dean froze. Castiel Novak? A frown spread on his face. Why the hell would Castiel Novak, their company's most important inventor, send him
Our orgasms hit at the exact same time. I am cramping up, come spilling out of my dick violently and my mouth falls open in a silent cry. The world around me is trembling, colors mix, white flashes and I am close to passing out but hold on to those overwhelming sensations I need to feel. Dean's about the same, I notice now, holding on to me for dear life while my clenching hole relentlessly milks the come out of him. It's messy and dirty, but it's perfect.
They spent the rest of breakfast talking about the things they'd created, noticing some similarities but also surprisingly many differences in them. Castiel quietly made a note in his head to start working on some of the things Jimmy had mentioned. Some of his ideas were truly genius! But then again, Jimmy was kinda him, so he shouldn't be all that surprised.
He didn't wait for an answer.
My heart is racing when Dean takes off our pants and throws them to the ground next to our shirts. I don't remember when I ever felt this good.
"I..." Dean stuttered. "I was going to, I swear."
Castiel sighed. His suit was uncomfortable, his tie felt like it was choking him and he was convinced people were looking at him weirdly, as if they were silently judging him. Castiel didn't like the feeling. He wasn't good with people anyway and everybody here knew it, making his loneliness at events like this even more prominent. But then again, Castiel told himself, he didn't have time for friendships anyhow because he was basically married to his work.
"Okay. What was in that hall?"
Not knowing what else to do, Cas turned his attention to the running TV, joining Dean in watching the same show as before, the one involving cowboy boots and doctors. Apparently, a guy named Dr. Sexy was the lead character.
Castiel was going to ask him out; how did he expect anything else? Why else would the man send him flowers; why else would he bother to do all these things for him without wanting anything in return? Of course it all lead up to this.
"I can
"Alright, hickeys first then?" Cas asks, lying down his book on the table and turning towards me, making me stutter in surprise.
, a taunting voice said in the back of his brain.
He saw Castiel wincing on the bed in reaction, looking up from his book with a surprised expression on his face.
"It's easier to just roll with it and not question it," Jimmy announced. "That's what I'm doing, anyway."
What if he didn't though? What if Dean didn't want to go out with him, get to know him? What if Castiel wasn't enough? And he knew he wasn't.
"Hey, Cas," he suddenly said, a humorous tilt to his voice, and Castiel looked up with raised eyebrows. "I'm pregnant," Dean announced, grinning widely, and held up a
"I've been working on it for three years straight. It was a frustrating and wonderful time and I never would have
"I need water," I croak and it hurts when I speak. Dean nods slowly.
What else was I supposed to do anyway?
"That was very enjoyable," Cas decided, smiling at Dean, and Dean scoffed knowingly.
I turned around and realizing it was Dean, I smiled.
Cas looks confused for all of five seconds before he remembers why we did what we did, and then nods quietly.
"I'm talking about the general public, not just you."
"It's been a long while since I've let anybody do that to me," Dean says when I'm following the cut on his throat with a finger. My eyes fly up to his. "You could've killed me."
"I'm... I'm sorry," he ended up saying and he could practically
An example.
Also, the robots in this building seemed to be rather trustworthy slaves, seeing as they could be controlled. The guy would never expect a
I wasn't worth her love...
And no, he was not being sarcastic.
"You okay?" a voice sounded from next to him and Dean's gaze lifted up to its source. Castiel was standing in the doorway, leaning against the frame with his arms crossed and a somewhat worried expression on his face.
"How's your head? Should hurt like a bitch," he says nonchalantly and I stare at him some more, not reacting in any way. I'm gonna die anyhow.
Castiel couldn't do anything but nod, still confused by this man's rapid mood change but willing to do anything to keep him this friendly. Still smiling -and Castiel had to admit that a smile suited him way better than a scowl-, the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper. He grabbed the pen from Castiel's chest pocket and wrote down his name and phone number without hesitation.
"Dean, just tell me what's going on, please? I'm starting to get worried..." Sam muttered, wishing for Dean to just get on with it. He was feeling too anxious for patience.
"Fuck!" Dean exclaimed, almost jumping in his seat, that's how surprised he was by the sudden appearance of the vehicle. He'd seen the episode before of course -he'd seen
"I know, it's a pleasure to meet you," he said and a genuine smile spread on his face. It was really sweet. "Dean has told me a lot about you."
"Yes, Dean, that's exactly what it means," Castiel said and smiled in a way Dean had never seen him smile before. Dean couldn't believe what he was hearing.
God damn it.
Sam cleared his throat. "So... what are we gonna do about it?"
"Romantic," Dean smirked, winking at him, and thoughtfully, Castiel stopped.
, but shoved the thought away quickly. He didn't actually want to know.
no one notice the difference between robot and human?" Sam asked. Dean's theory worked fine until that point.
"Would've never thought Dean was one of them though. I was convinced he'd have made a move on you if he was," she kept talking, hitting Castiel's feelings like a freight train at 100 miles per hour. "Oh, right, sorry," she apologized when she saw the look on his face. "That was inappro--"
He spots me. And freezes.
"I'm serious," he snickers himself and even though I'm pouting slightly, a grin steals itself on my face. I can't stay mad when everything is funny.
, but I heard it all. Every little thing that bothered her about me, I knew. Even though she never mentioned any of it. Needless to say, I couldn't stand it for long. So excuse me if I prefer being crushed on without getting too close and consequently hearing the hurtful things the guy I like might think of me later," Dean finished, breathing heavily, that pained look still in his eyes.
Then she wanted to know where I went when I wasn't at work since she barely saw me home anymore and I politely yelled at her to "mind her own fucking business". She didn't take well to that. From then on, all we did was shout at each other until I left the apartment furiously, throwing the door shut behind me.
He held the toy out for the camera.
"Let's make the final stab together," Dean says and his arms wrap around me, hand covering my own one around the knife. He guides me forward resolutely and raises the blade to the man's chest.
for you! He'll say yes. I'm sure of it," he tried to calm Dean down.
Afterwards, Dean took away the plates while I wiped the table clean. I was leaning over it when Dean passed behind me and before I realized what was happening, he'd grabbed my ass and pushed me against the table, making me bend over in surprise. I could feel his hard dick pressing against my ass through our pants.
got caught.
I was preparing dinner at the moment, cutting some vegetables into small pieces and putting them in a pot.
I did so immediately, noticing a middle-sized box lying on top of the small table out of the corner of my eye. Considering that it hadn't been there the day before, I supposed it had something to do with what we were doing right now and it didn't take long until I was proved right. Castiel picked up the box, successfully stealing it out of my sight, and I heard the box being opened. He took something from it and from the sound that followed I realized it was lube.
"Shh, it's gonna be fine," Castiel said soothingly and I sobbed again, desperate tears leaving my eyes.
She'd been bugging him ever since the day he got rejected, stopping by to 'check in on his work', and because Castiel couldn't exactly tell her she was annoying, he never said anything against it. Nevertheless, it was a little disconcerting, feeling her eyes boring into his back, the inexplicable scowl on her face never disappearing. Castiel didn't even know what it was he'd done wrong, but it must've been something major the way she was looking at him...
Sam shrugged helplessly, looking to Dean for help. The latter replied, "Dunno. Curiosity?" and took another bite of his burger.
, who was so much like Cas that it hurt to even look at him. He'd been robbed of the light of his life and given an infant he'd never wanted.
Shifting in his seat uncomfortably, Castiel shook his head. "I'm not with a guy either. I'm not with anyone, unfortunately."
"Dude, I just got fucked in the ass so hard."
"So," Dean started slowly, not able to control the words that came out of his mouth, "if I kissed you right now... would you feel something?" he asked, leaning towards Cas with a small smile.
Dean only looks at me for a few seconds, taking in my disheveled appearance, before he finally answers.
Cas wouldn't know.
Before he let me out again, he blindfolded me, so I had no idea whatsoever about where I was or what the building we walked in looks like.
Castiel
He immediately felt Gordon's responding blows as he tried to defend himself. First on the ribs, then on the chin. But Dean was not discouraged, he kept hitting, now anywhere he could.
"You better cover yourself with blankets"
Dean didn't grab it. He knew it had just been opened, so it probably wasn't poisoned, but he really believed he wasn't capable of actually moving just then. His whole body was shaking.
"Do you want me to go?" he questioned. If it was an order or something the Alpha wanted, he had no choice but to obey.
For this story there are two people that I would like to thank. Thanks_tacos, who was by my side from the beginning, motivating me to write something totally new for me but what I can't wait to do. He helped me and still does it with the translation of the chapters, from chapter three on, making what I write understandable in a language that is not mine. Thank you! I will be eternally grateful for helping me fulfill this dream.
"An Omega is not given anything. You must be a good Omega to deserve something," Dean defended, not in a disrespectful way, just repeating what he had been taught.
He looked around trying to find some Omega. He didn't know why he suddenly felt that need. He had never stopped to look for Omegas in the places he was. I saw them, I saw how they treated them, but now I looked for them.
"To escape?" Dean inquired, a little bit of hope in his voice.
He felt bad for taking advantage of the situation that way, he knew Dean was only talking because of the fever, he was delusional.
The following days were relatively calm. More of the same. The same Section with the blond-haired and strangely neat and perfect woman, who Dean discovered was called Lady Toni Bevell, a System social worker who took care of the Omegas.
"I know, but we can't tell them that you ran away. Let's do it differently. Do you agree?"
If he had money, he could buy the best Omega, educated, attractive, and not a damaged, marked Omega. Because he knew that this would be the first thing they would do to him when he entered the System’s facilities - they would mark him as an escaped Omega. And it would hurt, but what would hurt more than the physical pain would be  the fact of having to carry that brand forever.
Dean opened his eyes but saw nothing but darkness. Everything around him was dark, and as he moved he felt a sharp tug in his neck. He realized that it was because he had fallen asleep in a strange position, his body folded in a weird way, leaning against the wall, and his head had lolled to the side at a strange angle. It had resulted in  the cramped muscles and pain.
The two got back in the van and drove away along the dirt road, leaving a cloud of dust. Dean stayed still, unable to believe his luck. Not only had he been spared the call to the System, butthe beta had left him food and water. He quickly unwrapped the sandwich and ate it so fast that he almost couldn’t tell what it was. Chicken, maybe? He knew he shouldn't eat a stranger’s food, it was a risk; but he was so hungry that if he didn’t do something, he would pass out in that place, and that was a worse risk.
Hi everyone! I'm back :)
Dean's stomach stirred just to remember that and to think about having to return. But he was trapped again, and this Alpha could also use it for his friends. It could even be worse. Alastair always let him rest in his cage later.
What he had expected to be few hours turned out to be many, and it seemed to extend endlessly. Dean had no way of really knowing how many hours had passed - 3, 6, 10? But it felt like an eternity in there. His body ached again, his ribs shouted at every hole in the road the van passed over, and his arms and legs were stiff from being in the same position for far too long. He wanted to get out, and stay still, although he was sure he would still feel the rattle of the van several days later. He was dizzy, nauseous; it seemed like he was going to vomit at any moment, except for the fact that he had nothing in his stomach to bring back up.
Within seconds, the Alpha was by his side. He approached too fast, wanting to reassure the Omega by holding his body, but the surprising and invasive touch scared Dean, who screamed in panic.
"Do you have any questions, Omega?" Her contemptuous tone when saying Omega was palpable.
Dean looked at him for a moment; he seemed very sure of his words, and that unsettled him a little.
"It's for you," Castiel said, smiling kindly.
"Me too," Castiel added.
"Lo siento, Dean, no quise asustarte ..." Dean escuchó sin estar seguro de lo que estaba escuchando. Los alfas no se disculparon nunca.
When the day gave way to night, the sky was tinged with a pink and violet that had Dean watching most of the time through the window. It looked as if he had never seen a sunset, or as if he had not for a long time, and he did not take his eyes off the window until everything went black.
"Don't get your hopes up rookie, it's only an hour," Jacob replied, without taking his eyes off the sky.
"Yes, Alastair," he confirmed. "He will be very angry with me"
"I'm going to buy it" Castiel revealed, under her watchful eye.
He felt his feet shuffle across the pavement, to a large, bearded man, watching him with cold eyes and a dark look.
And there was the fact that if he managed to be Castiel's Omega, he would be a third-grade Omega. He already had three Alphas. And Omegas who had such a record were frowned upon by society.
"Who? Who did they take away? ” Charlie asked, understanding his friend's despair, but not knowing who he was talking about.
With trembling fingers he lifted the shirt he was wearing, which was not his, it would be the alpha’s, something that made him even more nervous. He was wearing clothes of an alpha, that was wrong everywhere.
"When I was on my way to judgment we stopped at a service station. And there was an Omega ..."
Castiel had sat on the edge of the bed, and as he talked with Dean his fingers played with the sheet. He hoped Dean would have said something, but the Omega did not make any comments, he was too scared to speak. If this Alpha decided to use it, there was nothing he could do, he was alone in his house, his true Alpha was who knows how many kilometers away. No one could help you, if someone really wanted to help an Omega.
He rubbed his palm with his thumb, unconsciously. Skimming over all the scars from that place. It was a bitter pain which helped him focus on reality.
"At least I have an Alpha" Hector retorted angrily.
"Come on, we’re late for court," said the same voice, now closer.
She raised an eyebrow. I knew it was possible. She was a lawyer like him. Perhaps they had never seen a case about an Alpha understand an Omega from another Alpha, but they knew it was possible, and that it had already happened.
It was almost like a mark of Cain, forever on his arm, a curse to remind him of what he had done.
"You're right, the trouble isn’t worth it," said the Alpha, finally. Dean took a breath, but continued looking at the ground, arms wrapped around his aching body.
Hi!! A long enough chapter for you to enjoy quite a bit. Cas and Dean are getting closer, and Dean begins to share some things, although he is still very scared. What do you think? They like me? They do not like it? I await your opinions! I come back soon ;)
"Yes" Dean replied crestfallen. "When they came to clean, they opened the door and I took the opportunity to get out, I ran as far as I could," he said, scared.
I knew she was going, they were friends years ago, Charlie was the most loyal friend I had.
With that idea in mind a knot formed in his stomach and he could not continue eating. The price could be very expensive.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel was resting his head in his hands, bent forward on the uncomfortable and hard waiting bench when Charlie arrived.
The idea sickened him. He still remembered the scars on his palms, the fear, his body trembling at any movement ...
"We have an order to search your house. You’re hiding an Omega, ”the taller, rude man spat.
He wanted to warn him so he wouldn't be scared. The last thing they needed was for Dean to be scared and refuse to let Castiel help him.
"No, but I won't let you hurt him anyway," the second Alpha spat.
He rarely left the house. Sometimes to run errands, but these tasks were usually done with Alastair, who took him to the shops and waited for him, making sure Dean wouldn't spend more than he should. Which he never did. He bought only what was strictly necessary for the house or for his Alpha. Nothing else.
"I won't hurt you," he said, in a low but firm whisper. He wanted the boy to know.
Dean was going to answer him, but his eyes fell on those of the dark-haired Omega who was still looking at him threateningly, and he opted to remain silent.
Castiel held his hands carefully, just from below, without really pressing, just letting Dean's hands rest on his as he watched the small marks scattered on his palms.
From where he was he could see the alpha move from side to side in the kitchen. It looked like he was preparing something to eat, and he looked very focused on that. It didn't seem like he was going to call the System, otherwise he should have done it already. Dean wondered why he hadn't done it yet.
He spent the rest of the time enjoying the wind and the clouds. He looked at them longingly, and tried to find some with familiar shapes. He could swear he could see one forming a car and a gun, but when he asked Héctor, he said that he could see nothing.
"That's perfect!" Castiel smiled excitedly, squeezing the Omega's hands tightly. They hadn't let go of each other, and neither seemed interested in doing so. "Do you want to go to the bathroom or have something to eat?" Castiel asked nervously.
"I can ..." He looked up excitedly, but that emotion dissipated immediately, understanding what that meant.
I hope you like it, and if you want to leave your comments about what you think will happen :) I love reading them.
Castiel let the sentence die again.
"You don't know me" he said instead.
He stepped closer and sat him on the sofa. Trying to avoid placing his hands on his ribs he lifted him until the Omega was standing and began to guide him to the bathroom.
"Better that way."
"Es un trabajo muy difícil escapar de un alfa, si te encuentran ..."
The entrance hall was not at all warm. On the contrary, somehow the walls seemed to suppress painful memories. Probably from Omegas who were crying for their destinies. Omegas sold, and Omegas who returned to Alphas who did not want, or who suffered at the hands of those who considered them inferior.
"Charlie I have to ..."
If the Omega used such a loving nickname, it could only be someone important. Perhaps the person he kept saying that he had to find.
"With your permission, I apologize for my friend's behavior. I am Charlie Bradbury." She held out her hand in formal greeting, and the Alpha took it with some suspicion.
"Dean?" The alpha tried to call him, but even though the Omega had his eyes open and seemed to be looking at him, he didn't really seem to see him. "Dean, we’re going to have to go to the bathroom, I’m going to pick you up, alright?"
He had been in contact with the beta from the service station where he had found Dean,  because he knew the man had been worried, but also because he needed to talk about the Omega on his couch with someone.
"Sorry Dean, I didn't mean to scare you ..." Castiel apologized, really sorry about what had happened. The omega was still scared and he kept scaring him even more.
Castiel took a small first aid box out of the closet. He would start with what looked uglier: the left eye.
"Dude, don't move" it looked serious but out of focus.
He did not hear what they were saying, but a plate of food entered through a small slot, which showed the light outside, but nothing more than that.
"I'm sorry, Alpha," he whispered, also aware that it was good to apologize.
"Your alpha did this to you?" the alpha questioned again.
The ringtones were endless, it seemed like hours and not seconds, until Charlie finally answered his cell phone.
"Okay, well, I'm going to pass you the Dean's Alpha contact. But please, check up on your friend."
He did not want to challenge this alpha, he did not want to make him call the System or get hit, but the weight of that truth was stronger than everything. The man judged him as if he knew him when they had actually been together for less than 24 hours. Alastair had had twelve years to make him a good Omega and still had problems with that.
Castiel nodded silently.
El alfa se detuvo cuando Dean giró la cabeza y la apoyó sobre las rodillas dobladas. Castiel quería saber, necesitaba saber más para ayudarlo, pero no quería presionar. Y aparentemente la conversación había terminado.
Castile nodded in agreement and walked for what seemed like a block to where the man was sitting. And Charlie followed closely, looking around at everything.
"Anything new?" Dean asked and walked up to the counter.
Nevertheless, worst case scenarios fly around my head right now, pictures of my naked, mutilated body on the cold basement floor. I sit down on the hard mattress, averting my eyes as to not look Dean in the eye when he steps closer.
"Come in, Inias," he growled in reply, forcing him to close the door behind him, and stepped closer to him, right into his personal space. "Now, is there
"Thank you," Castiel said and smiled as if he didn't have a care in the world. He didn't seem all that nervous. Fuck, even Dean was nervous, and it wasn't even a real date for him.
"Bullshit," Dean responded. "Come on, tell me, so I can help."
"Oh, Cas," he sighed, caressing my face with gentle fingers, and I sobbed quietly. "Don't cry," he said and pressed a quick kiss to my forehead. I knew it should make me feel worse than before but it didn't, not really. Instead, it even helped me calm down a little... "I don't like it when you cry."
Castiel huffed. "You're one to talk," he commented the nickname. "How old are you anyway?" he asked, curiosity getting the better of him.
It was disgusting and pathetic and Castiel only hoped nobody would ever find out about this part of the night.
That prick. That stupid, arrogant prick.
"Yes, Dean?" Castiel said, picking up on Dean's sudden mood change immediately, a worried expression on his face. "Is everything alright?
"Yeah, I thought... I thought maybe it might be fun." Dean shrugged. He seemed even more insecure now than before, so Castiel tried not to question him any longer.
My lips travel down to his collarbone, slightly pulling his shirt out of the way, and I can hear Cas suppress a moan. It starts a fire inside of me. I bite down hard, just as hard as he had before, and smile to myself when I hear Cas gasp. His hand's in my hair all of a sudden, pulling me up slightly. His eyes are closed when I look up at him. He's beautiful.
What the hell is wrong with him? Let Alfie ask Castiel out, Dean doesn't care either way... Except that Alfie is just so
the feeling. The idea of Castiel choking me to my orgasm took control of me and my mind went dizzy, if from the lack of oxygen or from the pleasure I felt, I didn't know.
Dean opened his eyes slowly.
The door closes again and a few seconds later, Dean is standing in my room, staring at me as if I'm an angel. I don't break eye contact when he comes closer and cups my face with his hands. His eyes are full of wonder.
But most importantly, at the moment, "You might."
"Thank you," Cas emphasized and Dean slapped him on the butt one last time before walking into the kitchen. Cas seemed unfazed.
"Ah, that's my Dad. I suppose I have to go now," Dean announced, turning away from him instinctively but shooting one last smile at Castiel. "I'll see you around, Cas," he added.
you staring at me, Cas," Dean grumbled after a few silent minutes and Cas averted his eyes.
"True," Dean agreed, letting out a laugh at that, and proceeded to grin at Castiel happily.
For a change, Cas knew what that meant and didn't mention it once.
He was kinda attractive, Dean thought.
"You," I replied breathlessly and Castiel hummed contently, adding a finger and pushing it in quickly. It was too fast but I could handle the painful stretch, as long as I was gonna get relief soon. I wanted to fuck myself on his fingers so badly.
Castiel's eyes narrowed.
Hesitantly, he reached out to Castiel and cradled his face, turning Castiel to face him. "I'm sorry for being a dumbass," he apologized.
Castiel only deserved the best.
Dean hadn't known what he'd felt when he looked at Cas at the time, but he certainly knew now. He'd known for a while, actually.
"It's just... I've been thinking a lot lately. About people, and... I don't know," I said vaguely.
Suddenly the memory's as clear as day.
The day passed, though, somehow, and after what felt like a lifetime, Dean was laying in his bed in his pajamas, the room dark, and he couldn't fall asleep for the life of him.
No, losing Amara's affection really was no loss. As for Castiel... Dean had to admit, the flowers had been kinda nice. And the guy was friendly at least. As opposed to Amara.
"Will you call me tonight then?" she wanted to know, her face stony as always, and she came to stand in front of his desk determinedly. Dean had to admit, it was somewhat threatening to have her standing above him like this, quietly seething on the inside. He didn't know what to say as to not anger her even more.
"I really like you, Dean," Castiel assured him. "And just because I was too dumb to realize you wanted to date me doesn't mean I haven't wanted that all along. You're the most beautiful, most amazing person I've ever known. And, if you still want it, I would be
That's when his lips met mine and I immediately stopped struggling, mind going blank. All I could think was,
, my friend. New people,
"Dean?" Castiel asked and Dean forced his attention away from his cheek. "Are you okay?"
Silence. I didn't look at him.
"Yeah,
Mom came into the kitchen right when I was done cooking, eyeing the contents of the pot warily. When she saw what it was she sighed loudly.
Sam looked up at Cas, eyes determined, and said, "You're staying. Are you okay with that?"
I filled a plate with noodles and gave it to her, then I took another one for myself. We sat down at the table and ate quietly. I could feel that Mom was lost in thought.
"I don't know, just tell me!" I say impatiently.
Luckily enough, the elevator ran smoothly and when Dean arrived in his office, he immediately saw what Meg had meant. On the middle of his desk was a bouquet of flowers in a vase, filling the empty space and seemingly enlightening the room with their colors. They were beautiful...
"You'll see it once you get to your office. I told them to bring it up there," Meg said, a smirk tugging at her lips but she kept her concentration on the computer. "Seems like you've gotten yourself an admirer."
hot, and Dr. Sexy doesn't know what to do with himself. This is the episode, in which he tries to work through his grief with meaningless hook-ups; I've already seen it. I'd tell you more but then I'd spoiler you and I can't have that. Let's just say there's some really unexpected plot twists to come," he explained, his barely contained enthusiasm overriding everything else.
"Found your ID in your purse," he mutters. "Forgot to look at your age though."
"Hey, buddy," a familiar face looked down on him and smiled. "Good to see you're alive, man."
Over the course of the next few days, Dean received more presents. Even though he was surprised at first, he quickly got used to them and began to expect them whenever he walked into his office. The flowers were a different kind every time, but all of them were beautiful and had a sweet note with them.
If Dean and Cas did it, why not us two?
Still, he didn't argue, knowing it wouldn't change anything, and left the room silently.
"I'm not one to interrupt potential last kisses, but I'm starting to feel like a third wheel, so I'm just gonna press the button now, okay?" Jimmy asked and Dean couldn't help but laugh.
"I assume some people could refer to candlelights as romantic, yes," he decided matter-of-factly and then quickly continued lighting them.
"So, which one do you think would be the best one for a pie?" Dean asked after he was done explaining, in an attempt to test Cas's new knowledge about baking flours. Of course, Cas didn't know the answer for the life of him. So, he ended up pointing to a random one and hoped for the best.
"Oh God, don't tell me you're a massage therapist," he laughed and Castiel simply smiled.
Flushing, Dean ignored the comment and asked instead, "But... but why do you look the same if you're not the same person?"
Again, that bastard's words echoed inside of his head. Who the hell did that guy even think he was? Bothering Dean throughout class, making him jealous by telling him-- telling him--
just fell out of," he said bluntly and once again Castiel was stunned by just how similar they both looked. Truly this wasn't a coincidence, was it?
"Who was the one to take you in when nobody wanted you? To love you unconditionally? To make you scream in pleasure whenever you needed it?" Castiel growled, a third finger pressing against my pucker, just waiting for the right answer to push inside.
But where was everyone? Amara and that other guy?
"Sounds like it was an accident though," Sam decided, but judging by the look on Dean's face, Dean didn't trust the whole thing. He seemed apprehensive and unsure what to think.
First of all, Dean had come in rather early the day after, having gotten used to receiving flowers in the mornings. Needless to say, there were no flowers that day and Dean wasn't sure why he was feeling so out of it when no delivery came. He was surprised, for the most part. And bothered. But he knew he had no reason to feel that way. He had more or less
"What the hell?" I yelled, completely shocked by this newest revelation, making Cas and Dean jump apart in surprise. They turned towards me, eyes wide and mouths open.
the authority. But I can assure you, Winchester Corp is not content with the amount of time and resources your invention currently takes. Now, if you would please get in the
I feel inadequate.
"Sorry I didn't tell you he was coming, I just figured he'd be welcome," Dean apologized and I shook my head quickly.
They talked about everything and nothing on the ride to the restaurant while Castiel directed him. Conversation was surprisingly easy, considering. When they arrived at the restaurant, Dean was relieved to see it wasn't overly fancy. It was nice, but not suit-and-tie nice, and it seemed right up Castiel's alley.
Okay, that had worked way better than expected.
"I feel sick, Mr. Singer, may I be excused?" Castiel asked, already hurrying towards the door. All Mr. Singer could do was nod in surprise and then he was gone, speed-walking to the bathroom.
"Always," I whispered, almost too quiet to be heard, and Dean kissed me again before he stood to walk out of the room, smiling at me when he closed the door.
, and he was weirdly possessive over them. He couldn't help it.
'Thinking'. Of course. 'Napping' would be the more appropriate term.
"Wanna learn somethin'?" Dean asks when he's sitting on the bed across from me, both of us high again.
I hear shuffling from outside the door and instantly know that I screwed up. I made too much noise. The guy knows I'm conscious now...
Still, it was quiet. The silence wasn't necessarily uncomfortable, but it confused me a little. Wasn't small talk the norm? Then again, Castiel in himself confused me, so it really wasn't that surprising. I simply didn't know what to think of him, other than, 'He's hot.'
Dean's hands travel all over my body, unashamed and hungry. I suck it all in. All the attention he has denied me this last week, I'm taking it all back now, pulling him down towards me, pressing myself against him, kissing every inch of skin I can reach. I'm in heaven.
After discussing and deciding on a sufficient plan, it was time for Sam to go back to bed, and Dean also opted to get ready for sleep. Cas stayed on the couch like the previous nights while Dean disappeared in the bathroom, and watched the clock ticking away. It was a little after three AM.
"I am. Because I know how they did it." The bastard smirked. "I know everything, Sammy."
a robot?" he shouted again and Inias pursed his lips in annoyance.
I only now notice that my left hand is free but it's of no big use, as I soon realize, since I can't reach anything that might help me and simply fingering on the handcuffs doesn't magically pop them open either. I am trapped.
"Uh... I did," Cas plays along, at the same time as my left finger points at him. Apparently, it's obvious to the both of us who's the more courageous one.
did you figure out?"
"It's just... I really like you, you know?" Dean admitted and looked back down at Castiel's chest. A sweet blush was covering his face and Castiel damn near melted at the sight.
"Nah, it's fine," Benny assures me and I smile, starting to take a liking in the guy. He seems alright, really.
"What's your last name?" Castiel suddenly asked, realizing the only possible explanation for all this.
"O-okay," Dean stuttered.
There was just so much
like we were happy and most of the time we even believed to be. Most days it wasn't hard to pretend, when everything felt good and we were lost in each other. Most days were fine.
Dean and Cas moved in together in senior year. They were sick of college dorms and had decided to look for an apartment close to school, and they'd succeeded.
Setting his jaw and balling his hands, Castiel started walking again, eyes determinedly fixed on Dean. He ignored everything around him; ignored the homophobic slurs and nicknames he received from Dean's team mates, ignored their laughter when they made innuendos about shoving several things up his ass. All that mattered was Dean and his silence (he'd never participated in this childish bullying), his cute little frown when he noticed it was
"Thanks, bitch."
was 'Baby'. And it was a 'her', apparently. So, after the short (and somewhat confusing) second introduction, Cas found himself standing next to Dean while he worked on the car, handing him tools every once in a while and listening to Dean's elaborate explanation about how Baby's engine worked, what was important to check on a car as old as this one and why exactly a 1967 Chevrolet Impala was the greatest car to ever exist. Cas didn't understand most of what Dean was telling him, but he listened attentively nevertheless. And whenever Dean pointed something out to him with his arms burrowed elbow-deep in his car, Cas continued pretending to understand, even though he was far from it, just so he could keep watching Dean.
Dean shook his head in disbelief. "Like, what do you want to drink?"
What am I supposed to do? What am I even gonna do outside? I don't know anymore. The door in front of my eyes is wide open, inviting me, taunting me, knowing that I'll be back without a doubt. I feel inferior.
"So good, baby, coming on my cock alone. So proud of you," he muttered and I involuntarily clenched around his dick again because of the over-stimulation. Dean came with a shout, slowing down inside of me, pulling out of me slowly, and collapsed next to me.
," he continued. " You
"Long story," was all Castiel said to that.
"Dessert?" Castiel asked afterwards. "They make a great apple pie."
did not have the patience for this.
And Cas did. He followed Sam past the cheery librarian, who waved at both of them again, and outside into a black muscle car. It was still raining, but not as heavily as before.
and he likes it... He has no clue what it means but he likes it.
I came home drenched in sweat and motor oil and stepped into the shower quickly. The water felt amazing on my body and I didn't leave the bathroom for about half an hour. I hoped Mom didn't mind showering cold.
"Hello, Mr. Winchester, sir," he greeted his boss respectfully, before taking a look at who was walking next to him. Eyes widening, Castiel took in the sight in front of him, because the unfamiliar man was exactly that, a
Turning to his side, Dean opened his eyes in defeat. There was darkness in the room, just like in his heart, but at least there were no more memories.
"Welcome home, pal," he chokes, silently screaming the words he cannot yet say but
I couldn't stand the loneliness of the apartment for long, so I left, not knowing where to, but when I passed Castiel's flat and instinctively stopped, I knew. If there was one person who cared about me -if only for sex- in the whole mess that was my life, it'd be Castiel.
The sound of the flush sounded from the bathroom and Cas knew Dean would open the door any second now and disappear in his room. Even now, Cas couldn't wait for Dean to wake up again, so they could spend more time kissing each other.
The last flickering hopes of Dean Winchester being straight were soon destroyed however, leaving them no choice but to accept it.
"No, I am not," Cas replied, not seeing the point in lying.
What followed was silence, and Castiel was thankful for it.
He grips my hair suddenly, pushing me onto his dick slowly and pulling me away again, setting a steady rhythm. I involuntarily follow his movements. I have trouble breathing.
Sensing I was uncomfortable, Benny let it drop.
A lewd smirk appeared on Jimmy's face. "Well, not so much a 'gay thing', because I didn't, like, sleep with him or whatever, but this one guy had the
"Told you mind readers were real," Charlie said, shrugging when Castiel told her about it the next day. "But you wouldn't believe me."
All of a sudden, the door opens. It's Dean -who else could it be- and he brings lunch. I crawl over to him with swollen eyes, suppressing my tears, and take the plate quietly. It's steak this time, already cut into even pieces. Dean has been giving me nothing but homemade meals once I started doing what he told me to and I had to admit, his food was actually quite good.
"Dude," he said in between snorts. "You did not just offer me a
Ten minutes later, he was back in the room with two plates full of food, setting them down on the table, and gestured for Cas to get over there. Cas complied immediately and watched Dean putting syrup and butter on both their pancakes, impatiently waiting for Cas to sit down.
"Ah, there he is!" John Winchester's voice suddenly sounded from behind him, right on cue. Castiel rolled his eyes defeatedly for a moment, before turning around with a weak smile on his face.
But he trusted Castiel, he had already told him that, so now he had to move on.
"Are you sure this is not just a whim? Dude, don't misunderstand me," she hastened to say when Castiel sent her a murderous look "but Dean has an Alpha, from which he ran away. Whether you want to or not, that speaks a bit badly of him ... I know, I know, he was mistreating him, that's true. Maybe he's actually a bad Omega ... "
“Dean, listen to me. I need you to listen to me. ”
Maybe he wasn't going to do it at all, but that didn't make any sense, risking being caught with an escaped Omega, when he could surely have any Omega he wanted. The man did not seem precisely poor.
Holy shit, Castiel! She bellowed, a mixture of admiration and disbelief on her face. "Tell me everything" she almost screamed.
"You're crazy! You're not going to accomplish anything like that" Charlie snapped, holding his friend by the arms and forcing him to shut up.
Charlie plugged his big headphones into his ears and forgot about the world.
"So who did?" Dean asked hoarsely.
Castiel tried to convince him to lie down on the bed for the night, but there was no way, the Omega refused after the first question, was terrified when Castiel insisted, and huddled in the corner of the sofa when the alpha tried to bring up the subject again. He didn't want to force him, and he didn't know how to make him understand that it was better without it looking like an order. So he  let  it go, the sofa wasn't the worst anyway.
Castiel stood in front of the place and looked at it with disdain. He had already been to the System facilities in his city to solve some slopes between Alphas by Omegas, but now it was different.
Dean tried to look around, but unconsciousness claimed him and he closed his eyelids heavily again.
"He should be made to go back to his Alpha to be punished ..." The Alpha was still loud, but he already seemed calmer and the scent of his anger was diminishing.
"We're almost there" Castiel coaxed him to continue and part of Dean got excited about the incentive.
He walked across the parking lot, to his car, where he had left it the day he arrived with the Omega.
Now, in his cell, Dean ran his finger over the record on his hand, number 5743 was still there, to remind him where he was.
Castiel got up and walked over to Dean. It was then that he realized that his feeling that something was wrong was actually correct.
In reality Dean had not yet overcome his fear that at any moment he would ask him for something in exchange for everything he had been giving him. And the list was long, so that possibility terrified him. He couldn't say no to an Alpha.
"Dean," he tasted his name as if he was trying something unfamiliar. "Another escaped Omega. Aren't those bastards tired of making us work? ” he spat and released a file, which surely contained the Omega's information.
"Come on, you need to take a warm bath to lower the fever," Castiel told the boy, leading him to the private bathroom.
He lowered the light intensity and settled in his bed, but he couldn't sleep.
"No" Dean retorted shaking his head. He wasn't hurt, the scars were just a reminder that he was a bad Omega.
They forced him to keep walking and when he was standing next to the truck, they opened the big cage and pushed him inside. This time, he could not stop the impact with his hands, so he hit the ground hard when he landed.
The omega nodded and Castiel smiled again. They were making progress, no doubt.
Dean was shaking, he didn't want to be hurt, but he also didn't want other Omegas to get hurt because of him. He knew that many Omegas were authorized to work, with permission granted by their Alphas and the System, and some places hired them. Restaurants, shops, service stations - places where the politics of the place protected Omegas or where they believed they could be good officials serving Alphas and betas.
He felt like everything was spinning around him and realized he had hit his head. He tried to get up, but his strength had abandoned him. He could no longer fight, there was nothing more to fight for.
Dean froze, looking at the man blankly. Then, he withdrew without adding anything else. He was slow to understand that it was the same alpha who observed him at breakfast.
"Someone has called the System. And they’re coming to ..."
"I prepared a very rich and nutritious breakfast. Do you want to come to the table?" The question took the Omega by surprise. He opened his eyes and turned his gaze to the counter.
Dean wasn't sure if the Alpha expected a reaction from him, but he just stayed where he was, without risking any movement. He could not deny that he was starving, and whatever the Alpha was cooking, it smelled so rich, but he could not eat, he feared he would fall asleep and call the System, then it would all be over. He would have run away, gone hungry and scared  for nothing.
"My brother" Dean repeated, in a soft and sweet voice.
"I will be with you, and I need you to stay with me," the last words were a silent plea from the Alpha to the Omega, and he nodded silently.
"I'm going to call the Omega System to come and get you and take you to your Alpha, damn Omega ..."
"Are they burns?" Castiel questioned, looking up at the scared Omega in front of him.
For a few seconds it seemed that the Alpha stopped to contemplate him, happy with his answer.
Dean started by tasting the juice. With small sips, he did not want to overdo it. But the truth was that he was afraid of what the Alpha would want in exchange for all that.
Alastair had shown him his cage and taught him rules and regulations, and the penalties for noncompliance. At first it had been difficult, over the years it had become easier, but even so he was still a bad Omega, he had many things to learn.
He was instantly upset, scared.
Well, I've been missing, but let you know I'm still working on this story! One more chapter, which I hope you enjoy! I await your comments! I love :D
He felt like he was going to pass out. His legs didn't seem to support his body. He was hungry, cold, and in pain. He wanted to crawl to somewhere warm. Almost without thinking an idea invaded his mind. Castiel's bed, and he is appearing before his eyes with a tray of food. But instead it was Ketch who appeared.
Castiel seemed to notice Dean's inner dilemma, so he offered a calm smile.
Only one thing was sure, he could not let Dean return to his alpha, although he had no idea how to prevent this from happening.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Alpha ..." he whispered in a hoarse voice and with a dry throat.
Suddenly a scent  of Alpha approached, it was soft, but Dean felt worried. And then followed a blue-eyed Alpha who appeared before Dean. He wore a white apron over  black jeans and a blue shirt.
He said those words and pushed Dean into the crowd again.
"Why would you do that?" The words came out of Dean's mouth without thinking, but he couldn't understand why an alpha would help an Omega.
Dean tried to let go, but the Alpha's hand more resembled claws that squeezed his arm tightly, cutting off the blood circulation, and reminded him of Alastair; when he got angry he seemed super strong, and would grab Dean so tightly it hurt, or tie him with a rope just as tight. He still had scars on his arms and wrists from that.
A thought invaded Dean's mind and almost made him stop short: Castiel is not going to let anything happen to you.
"No" Dean whispered hurriedly.
"You shouldn't have tried to go back. You should have kept going, we are not slaves to anyone. Even the Alphas" the red haired boy screeched.
"I'm going to need you to help me, do you think you can do that?" he tried again.
And I would also like to thank Arianllyn who very kindly offered to edit the translation of chapters 1 and 2 that had not gone through that yet. Thank you very much, you contributed your grain of sand to make this story possible.
Dean finished eating and leaned against the damp wall.
He spoke monotonously, like he was tired of repeating the same speech over and over, but anyone would have noticed the tint of satisfaction to his voice when he said that the Omega would now be marked, and that he would return to his Alpha, which, clearly, was nothing any escaped Omega wanted.
"Would it have made a difference if I was only 17?" I want to know and Dean looks me up and down quickly, checking me out quite obviously.
"I suppose..."
My gaze flies up to him again in horror and I shake my head quickly. I have never nor will I ever kill a human being with my own two hands. Not if I can avoid it.
And even though Dean knew Cas didn't actually
And even though Dean knew it was a bad idea, all he could do was nod. He didn't know what made him do it, but he knew that he didn't want to take it back either.
Dean looked at him in surprise. Apparently, Cas had been right..?
I nodded.
So, the topic was left untouched for the most part and Dean managed not to think about it any longer.
"Oh," Dean said. "Well, good."
"Uh, alright," he said and paused for a second, wondering if he should introduce himself as well. He didn't even know what this guy wanted. "I'm Dean," he added nevertheless, deciding to be polite for the moment and see where this would go.
"Of course," he replied, strangely earnest, and I smiled widely. I couldn't say why but I liked this guy already.
"Hey, Cas," Dean said quietly, as to not wake up his brother yet again, and Cas turned towards him with a slight smile. Dean was leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed, mirroring the fond smile Cas himself had on his face.
When I arrive back in my room, I leave the door open, wanting to hear when Dean is coming downstairs. I don't know how he'll react to me wandering around the house and killing his victim without permission but I don't think he'll be all that angry...
I look up at him in wonder. He wants me to cut him. He
Dean guides his cock inside slowly, the wet heat of my mouth pulling a moan out of him, and I taste his pre-come on my tongue. It's salty.
He pulls me closer and kisses me, slow and sensual. It's the first time he's kissed me like this and I crave more of it. It feels like pure love.
"Uh..." he muttered, not knowing what to reply. He was so stupid.
"And I thought I'd fixed it," he mumbled, his mood suddenly not as elevated as before, and took another bite of his sandwich disappointedly. Every time things went well, he had to screw it up.
from his
As if reading my thoughts, Dean's head turns back towards me. "Don't worry, I don't mean in terms of sex. Well, that too but not only," he tells me and I blush at his words. If I'm too virginal to even hear about sex, how does he expect me to
"Yeah, see you later," Castiel answered and stared after Dean in confusion as he left.
That was when Dean suddenly spoke up with the most unexpected words.
Groaning, Dean pushed his fingers in as deep as he could and then pulled them out again, only to repeat the motion over and over again. He added a third finger after a few thrusts and was rewarded with a guttural groan. It was a heady feeling, being the one to draw these amazing moans out of Castiel, this guy who was usually so stoic and unimpressed and now putty in his hands. And he kept pushing back into his hand, too, like the only thing he wanted right now was to get Dean in deeper.
in his head as loud as he could for as long as he could and nearly got a heart-attack when Dean visibly flinched and glanced back at him for just the fraction of a second.
To everyone's bewilderment, Castiel didn't even bat an eyelash at Dean's words and rather smiled at him, a slight blush on his face, and started a silent conversation about whether or not their English essay was due on Thursday or Friday. Dean just shrugged, smiling back.
Dean was a little offended. He was not
And Cas did so without complaint. Once he was inside, the first man made him turn around, pulled up his dress shirt and opened the cover on his back.
"Not really," Dean chuckled and looked down at Cas again. "Only since yesterday."
It wasn't even as if Dean was jealous that Balthazar got to hold Castiel's hand for one whole evening and that he'd be known as 'Castiel's boyfriend' the entire time they'd spend there. It wasn't even as if Dean had had an undeniably strong, unrequited crush on Castiel ever since they met two years ago -- except it totally was.
The voice sounds vaguely familiar. I can't fit a face to it yet though.
"Well, Charlie says we're about the most disgusting couple she knows, so..." Cas trailed off.
"Very much so," I smirk and lean in to kiss him. He doesn't expect it but reciprocates anyway, hand reaching for my waist instinctively. I press against him.
He probably wasn't a morning person.
When the slight burn of the hickey has finally passed away, Cas pulls away slightly, hands still on my stomach, and looks up at me with hooded eyes.
"Oh, thank you," he said and smiled.
"It has a brown leather cover and is about this big," Castiel answered, showing its size with his hands. "And..." he hesitated, wondering whether he should tell him the truth. "It's the only thing I have left from my mother... That's why it's so important," he explained quietly.
"Nothing," he muttered in response and hoped for his life that his tormentor would just leave it alone and get it over with. His hope was destroyed quickly.
I stayed quiet, Dean's eyes still staring into mine with pity. I didn't say a word but that was okay. Dean understood without me having to tell him.
"I think you gotta practice that for a little longer," Dean laughed fondly and Cas nodded, determined. He was an ambitious learner when it came to the small things, and even though car stuff seemed to be lost on him -which was a shame, really-, he was quick with most other things.
"Dude, you awake?"
Deep in thought, he passes a store window and slows down, something catching his eye. He tilts his head. It's a TV and it's running, a news channel informing people about the events of the day. He can't hear what they're saying and the video quality is bad, but he watches nevertheless.
"Um... To ensure it doesn't tip over, I guess," Castiel answered and the second the words left his mouth, he knew he was done for.
"You don't get to kiss me, unless I allow it. You do as I say," he explained and I nodded quickly. I'd do anything as long as it made me have those lips on mine again.
"Cas is awesome, seriously. You'd like him. He's a nerdy bookworm just like you, but he's
Or that's what he kept telling himself at least.
Hesitating for only a second, Cas decided to believe him and nodded. His whole body slumped in relief and he leaned back into the couch exhaustedly. His mind still seemed to be racing but it was better than before.
Castiel guides him back with a hand on his shoulder. "Dean, you're being very rude," he scolds him quietly and fixes him with a look asking him to be patient, and Dean can't help but stay where he is, pressing his mouth closed in frustration. His lower lip is trembling as Castiel turns back to Alfie, and he knows what's coming next. "Sorry, Alfie. You were saying?" Castiel encourages Alfie to continue while Dean's getting sick to his stomach.
He must've sensed something was wrong, but I didn't want to talk about it just yet. First I wanted to kiss him and take comfort in his touches, but I knew he'd push me away if I did so. After yesterday I knew that Castiel was a control freak, he wouldn't let me do that to him without permission.
"God damn it, Sammy, I called you when I met Cas in freshman year and
I feel uneasy when I think about what we've done. The things that could have happened...
Dean typed a short reply and climbed back into the car, anxiousness making way for excitedness.
'Welcome home, love.'
It takes hours until I'm thinking clearly again. Most of the time under the influence I'm a barely conscious mess, holding on to Dean with a death grip and blabbering unintelligible sentences. I feel like I'm flying.
I jerked off four times that night.
He looked back out the window, the men having disappeared into the hospital. Now was the perfect time to go. They wouldn't see him leaving Dean's Baby and therefore not question where it was he came from -- or it would be easier to lie about it, at least.
"Hello?" Jack said, startled.
The extra day didn't help, to be honest, but at least he'd had a day off. He still went to work in a dark spirit the next day.
"Let's go to the couch," he ordered and I followed him quickly, sitting down next to him when he did. Castiel didn't look at me when he said, "Did I say you could sit down?"
"She's barely home, man! And when she is, she's pissed at me. When she tells me that she loves me it sounds forced, and she'd be better off if I wasn't there anyway. She must regret having me," I explained reluctantly and Benny's expression grew even more absurd.
Silence fell as Castiel poured himself a cup and sat down across from Dean, who had opted to open the bottle of water and gulp it all down in one go. It was kind of impressive if you thought about it.
"A couple. They checked on us from time to time. Our backs. I do not know what they were doing. Like I mentioned, the covers were kept open until they made us enter the vans."
"Shut up, old man."
I pull at the handcuffs again, making my wrist hurt even more. I know there's no use in trying but I do so anyway, and involuntarily, the clatter of metal against metal cuts through the room loudly.
He was good to me. Mostly.
"I--"
"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun," Dean said and winked at me playfully. I felt the usual uncomfortable warmth pooling in my gut and shifted in my seat slightly. Damn him and his ability to make me hard and uneasy at the same time.
"What happens afterwards?" Cas inquired, finally asking the question that'd been bothering him since yesterday.
With that decision in mind, Castiel entered the building. Meg was at the counter, as always, that suggestive smirk on her face she always seemed to wear when it came to Castiel. He never knew what to make of it though, so he usually ignored it.
And that was when he touched something cold. He stopped.
Immediately realizing what I had just witnessed, I blushed furiously and threw the rest of my laundry inside of the machine, pressed the button and
I heard Dean casually following me back to the dining room where Mom was already waiting for us, smiling up at Dean happily. My new step-dad smiled back and pressed a gentle kiss to her lips, while I sat down quietly.
It was only day one of Mom being away and staying with Dean proved to be difficult. The things he did became increasingly more inappropriate and I was struggling to hide in my room all day. It was way too boring up there, so I couldn't stay in there for too long, which of course meant I had to deal with Dean and his weird ways.
I loved him.
He's back not even fifty seconds later, a box in his hands -- together with a sharp knife.
"Hey, you," the smaller one exclaimed, coming closer, and Cas turned his head towards him.
"You do feel though, right? Like, in general?" Dean continued, genuinely interested, and Cas glanced up at him, nodding thoughtfully.
I believed it did.
Before he could worry about it any further, a thought crossed his mind. Maybe he didn't need to find some kind of button or lever or whatever. Maybe destroying the thing might work just as well. This way nobody could ever turn the whole thing on again.
him doing all those things to me.
He smiles.
"Tired?" Dean asked, smirking, and Cas glared at him jokingly.
But it was okay. He had expected Dean not to be able to get aroused while on drugs. It was only natural. Then again, this wasn't about riding Dean, this was about
The man only scoffs and his grip on my hair intensifies. I suppress a painful groan as he tugs my head closer. "Yeah right," he says, unbelieving. "And how can I be sure you won't tell anyone?" he questions and I can't bring myself to break his gaze, lip trembling slightly. I just wanna go home.
"Wh--what?" he croaked and his voice betrayed him for a moment. "I can't get in there, it's gonna kill me!" he exclaimed.
"I do not know what 'duh' means, Dean."
"Hey buddy," Dean said and licked his lips involuntarily. I couldn't help but stare at them.
"Oh please," she said, eyeing him up in annoyance. "That's what you call progress? Sending toy cars back and forth? I wanna see
To be honest, Dean was pretty sure that if he
It was about a week or two later, when he followed me to the laundry room.
At his nod, Castiel laid a hand down on Dean's thigh. "You do know what I actually mean by that, right?" he added then, lifting his eyebrows expectantly, and Dean flushed terribly. Taking a quick glance around he didn't recognize anyone, so he nodded again and gulped down his nervousness.
"You... You were in our kitchen?" I asked and Castiel tilted his head slightly. It'd be cute if I wasn't so freaked out. "How?"
"You called for me, sir?" Inias's quiet voice finally sounded from the door and Metatron turned towards him. The door was opened, Inias's hand still on the handle, and he looked as uncomfortable and guilty as Metatron would expect him to.
In that big room there was everything, like in a normal and well equipped house. There was the Alpha’s room, which was just where Dean was, a little higher than the rest. There was the bed where he was curled up, a thick wooden wardrobe and a bedside table next to the bed. A large window covered two walls. Window was in the bedroom and in the kitche. It was really very colorful and modern. The furniture was not normal furniture, but seemed original, like those that Dean saw in the magazines that his first Alpha used to collect.
Dean didn't need to wait for him to finish talking. He already knew what he was going to say. His body felt it. Vibrating with nerves and fear, he stood up, without evaluating the consequences of his still fragile state.
"Dean ..." Castiel returned and realized he didn't know Dean's last name. But it was not necessary because the perfect man did not seem to need more information.
The sound of busier morning traffic circulating brought him back to reality, with a desperate blow of his heart, and his mind already alarmed. He looked around to realize that the weather was beginning to clear up, and he was still alone. What a relief.
Dean ‘s memory trip was cut short the moment a dull thump brought him to reality. To that cold, dark cell he was in now.
Suddenly he no longer believed in this Alpha. He never should have, he couldn't help him, however much he wanted. He tried to help him now, Dean had heard his screams and protests, but they had been useless. No one could intervene for him. Why would someone do it?
?" the man answered.
"We could've gotten together after time," Dean said weakly, knowing that his argument was pathetic. "You know what?" he added before Castiel could reply. "Forget it."
Dean nodded, pointing a finger at him. "Exactly!" he exclaimed.
Cas thought about it. There wasn't much he did remember, there was the factory hall, the van, the hospital and the library. Then Sam and Dean. Apart from that, not much else.
On his way back to the car, Dean's phone pinged with a new message, and he opened it curiously. It was from Castiel and it made Dean smile.
after all. Also, I was less than half his age, but Dean didn't seem too bothered by that. It was like he got off on making me uncomfortable.
"Hello Dean," Castiel greeted me and I entered without his consent. "Are you alright?"
Dean scoffed through his crying. "Of course I'm sure. I've been in love with women before, and it's not like I can just like men, too."
"Will you ever stop?" I'd question.
"Oh, really?" I ask. Dean's been telling me a lot about his life lately, mostly about anything concerning his little brother because apparently, Sam's the only one he has in his life beside me. I feel special that I get to hear about him.
Then, finally, with his goodbyes in mind, Cas opened the car door and left.
