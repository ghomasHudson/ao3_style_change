Sherlock grumbles a yes, then flops into one of the chairs and John pushes the plate in front of him.
John walks downstairs first, to pick up the decorations and the clothes he rented for them. He had found the same store Sherlock used last time and found the perfect attire for the detective, and the one for himself isn’t too bad either.
“I don’t think we should … you know, we can’t keep them, don’t you?” Sherlock’s heart breaking is visible on his face, and he says “but John” the way kids say “but Mum”.
When he finishes, John realises he’s smiling again. If he thinks about it, not much has changed in the last few weeks in Baker Street. They solved two cases, sevens, John went to the clinic and worked on his blog whenever he had a quiet minute, with the small addition that every time he sat down he found himself with a kitten in his lap a few moments later.
“Well, this is just as dull as the flat, just colder.” I mumble, and it is just to annoy him, when he is the one doing me good. Walking, our hands brushing between us from time to time, has already done me good, his plan working, and I thank him by being an arse. How is it that he still puts up with me?
Footsteps: slow, heavy, strained. An older person, or a good disguise. Sherlock presses against the wall behind the door, making sure he is hidden from view, giving him the element of surprise. He breathes quietly, heart sounding too loud in his own ears, as the door is slowly pushed open.
„Rosie, do you want to come to play after school?” Emma asks as she puts her coat on. It’s very pretty, green with a red flower on every pocket.
There is so much knowledge I have to acquire first, research to be done, and I can’t wait for John to go to work tomorrow so I can start.
Mike, thankfully, doesn’t comment on my behaviour, even though I’m sure it is obvious to him. Instead, he smiles that smug smile he has had on his face ever since John and I told him we had decided to tie the knot. He is – and I cannot blame him- quite proud of the pivotal role he played in our relationship as the mutual friend being the man who introduced us, and John insisted he undertake the role of best man. I didn’t mind, since the only alternative would’ve been my brother, whom I didn’t want to invite at all. That he would be there was, again, John’s work.
For one day, he feels less of a freak, John realises and instinctively pulls him closer. It is very sentimental, but John is not going to tell Sherlock that. Instead, he makes a pact with himself to be more understanding when it comes to heads in the fridge and eyes in the kettle – or not, maybe. Those are still annoying. John leans up to kiss Sherlock’s chin, a small promise to keep defending him against the arseholes out there, those at New Scotland Yard who call him freak.
John comes in from through the kitchen, putting the kettle on before he steps through to the surprisingly quiet living room. Sherlock is there already, he can hear the old floors creak and the rustle of his coat, but there is no yelling or enthusiastic violin playing going on.
So, for the past half an hour, I’ve been looking at a piece of cloth taken from her blouse, to prove her last hours had been spent at her office. With her boss.
I tear my eyes from the building and let it wander further.  Rows of white chairs have been placed on the stone terrace, and I can see just the spot at the edge of the pond, where I will say “Yes I do” to John Watson. My hands are sweaty again but I dare not wipe them against my suit and ruin it.
He spotted the letter in John’s hand. Fine, red letters on the front. The seal had been broken. And John was angry. Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment, squaring his shoulders. Anger he could deal with.
“Didn’t plan on doing this again,” John says, his own voice sounding strange in his ears. He tries humour, but fails, fingers digging into the detective’s skin as another wave of pain hits him. To his surprise, Sherlock squeezes back.
He found himself lying on an antique sofa in Mycroft's home. He made an extra effort to bleed on it in areas that would be difficult to clean. He knew it was a lucky thing that he had managed to remain conscious long enough to force the medics away from him. Only John got to patch him up. The wound went from his fifth rib down to his thigh and was bleeding steadily, a constant stream of blood ran down his right side. At least the perpetrator had been an amateur with a knife. If he had his usual weapons Sherlock may not have survived. Wincing slightly, Sherlock began to file away the sensory information he had received, this was a wound type he had not yet experienced. Cataloging it was of the utmost importance.
Harry was seated on the end of the bed, waiting for them. She motioned to the chairs beside her in silence, and the air became thick with tension. Suddenly John was anxious. His gut was saying this was not a good thing. "John here's my chart. Read it carefully and then I'm going to tell you something ok? But you both have to promise me right now that you'll understand where I'm coming from ok?" Harry pleaded with them both and if it hadn't before now John's stomach was on the floor and his heart in his mouth. His hands were steady when he picked up the chart. "Oh
There was, of course, one photo lying at the base of the box, its edges well thumbed, its image unforgettable.
Mycroft was in a bloody fantastic mood, having woken up wrapped in a warm Gregory and spent a very enjoyable shower in his company, and as a result he was doing some of his best work, apparently a good shag does wonders for the state of the government. In fairness, the past fortnight or so had been great from a work and relationship standpoint. After the major misunderstanding and subsequent reconciliation, affairs between himself and Gregory had been phenomenal. It still astounded him to know that Gregory loved him, that had been reiterated many times, whispered into worshipped skin over and over. Mycroft blushed a small bit thinking about it, and rolled his eyes at the knowing smirk Lucia gave him. "Yes yes,alright, now be sure to tell Francoise that we are not free until the new year and even then I do expect him to have resolved the issue before that. Also, remind Vikram of his precarious position and ensure he is place under level three surveillance before we go." Lucia frowned in confusion and then chastised herself "Of course, Christmas with Mummy, I'd all but forgotten." Mycroft gave a small smile and ran a hand through his hair. "Indeed. Sherlock will once again be in attendance but with John at his side I am hoping we can avoid any major incidents. We will have to pick them, Gregory, and our luggage up later on today." He shuddered sightly at the thought of the sniping that would occur. Shaking his head he runded back on Lucia. "What about your latest conquest, have you put your plan into action?" Lucia gasped and Mycroft just raised his brow, he was not an easy man to hide things from and though he'd been surprised he could not say that he disapproved of her choice. It had become clear to him when she returned from Vienna that there was someone at home she wanted to see, but as it happened that was only, and evidently still was, in a friendly capacity. He tutted good naturedly at her "Come along dear, Miss Hooper is a lovely woman and would be lucky to have you. I am reliably informed that she will be in attendance on New Years eve, midnight is a wonderful hour, don't you think?" Lucia gave a wry grin and shrugged "I'm working on it sir. Her majesty has requested that she be formally introduced to Greg, perhaps for afternoon tea after the holidays and she would like you to thank him, your brother and Dr Watson for their service to the country. In other words she's understandably very curious about your love life." Mycroft checked his watch and rose, continuing to give instructions as he moved to the door to leave. "Accept her invitation and set a date, take a look at Gregory's schedule first obviously, and I want full daily updates on Tedison's work while we're away. I do not want to return to another Egypt fiasco like David left us. We will of course be available in an emergency but preferably I want no interruptions. I've been neglecting Mummy something awful recently and I intend to make up for that in these next few days."
The lake front was lined with trees and shade, and as the sun beat down it was pleasant enough to sit amiably in the tall shadows, horses tethered together, watching the light dappled on the soft waves. The five of them were actually enjoying themselves, and when the time for lunch rolled around they had actually become quite a tightknit group, though secretly John was still a little scared of Mummy, the soldier in him kept the fear at bay. Something about the little looks Greg kept giving Sherlock when he wasn't looking made him dubious. Greg knew something. It dawned on him that he probably knew about Sebastian, Mycroft being the fountain of knowledge that he was. John allowed that thought to slip his mind as they trooped back to the horses and onwards for lunch. T
"Thank you Lucia. Do try not to gloat too much about this later." Lucia smiled and tapped her nose "It's just between us sir. Wouldn't want anyone else thinking they can do my job." she laughed and sidled to the door "Also, Sherlock and Dr Watson have met with Clara and are with her now in the hospital." she exited with that, leaving Mycroft alone with his guilt. He'd been neglecting his love quite badly indeed. "Perhaps a gift, an apology, and a declaration are in order." and he began to issue a series of texts, beginning with one to Gregory.
Every surface was covered in flowers, boxes and envelopes to the point where John was pretty sure there were more of them than there was actual furnishings.
The night of Molly Hooper's batchelorette party was an odd night. Perhaps, one could argue, that there was just something in the air that made everything a little bit more... Fun. The smallest of jokes and wise cracks were suddenly hilarious, everyone was in a great mood and just happy in general for the girl who had once said that she didn't count was getting married within the week, to a Detective Inspector of Scotland yard no less. Dimmock was a good man, and would treat Molly as if she were a million pounds (a proclamation Sherlock had gotten out of him after cornering him in an alley and threatening to break him if he hurt her. (Sometimes John wondered if he'd pushed the whole 'showing emotions for people you cared about' lark too far.) and she was truly in love with him. It had taken Sherlock's Fall and his subsequent dependence on her to get over her crush on Sherlock. How could she love someone who was empty because they had to leave the one they actually loved? It wasn't fair to anyone, and then she'd met Michael.
“Do you know where you are and why you're here?” John asked tentatively, his mind racing. If Sherlock's lack of recognition extended from the moment of trauma to the recent past it was unlikely that he'd be able to answer the second part of that question with any degree of confidence. There was also a time game to be played. Every doctor knew that a coma patient waking up was likely to express some form of short term memory issue - be that a memory reset every few minutes or a chunk of missing time. God was he hoping that was what was happening here.
Surprisingly to all involved, it was Mycroft who replied to him with a melancholy smile. “Sometimes, the risk is worth the reward, wouldn't you think?”
In the evening as forkful after forkful of dinner passed through his lips like clockwork, John wondered if, somewhere out there in a rehab facility in the Swiss alps, Sherlock was eating properly. He hoped so.
John was, he was certain, exhausted. Three cases back to back, barely four meals over the past two and half weeks, next to no sleep, he was genuinely astounded that he was still able to stand let alone apprehend criminals. Sherlock of course showed no signs of even being ruffled, and he'd only been eating what John had time to put in his hands. John was growing a beard at this stage, and as soon as the third case wrapped, he made a decision.
"Sherlock" three knocks and the clack of an umbrella. Mycroft. "Sherlock I am here, I can help you brother." The man sobbed "I'm not safe to be around them." "Who?"Mycroft asked, still outside the door he could have opened. "People Mycroft. I'm begging you. Put me away, please, I don't... I don't want to hurt them. I'm not safe for them. For him. God look at... Please." The door opened and the ragged intake if breath was almost as shocking as seeing Mycroft smile would have been. "Ok little brother, ok." Mycroft's fingers flew across the face if his phone and then through Sherlock's curls as he sobbed,
"It's not much. In the summers when Mummy and Father wanted rid of me, this was where first Mycroft and I and then I alone would be sent. I spent some of the best and the worst summers of my life here, I thought you might enjoy it, of course there's a contingency plan if you don't I can make the call right now and-"
John's key turned in the lock and Sherlock sat down abruptly at the table, bending over his microscope intently. If he had have been really looking, he would have noticed the slight bulge of John's pockets but he was a little bit too focused on his own to take it in. "I'm almost done with these, Molly has more at the morgue. Want to come along, shouldn't be too long and then we can have dinner." He called to John as he strode through the sitting room and into the kitchen. He flicked the kettle on for tea. "Sure, anywhere in mind?" Sherlock smirked to himself. "Yes" John simply sifted good naturedly, deciding not to press the issue. Besides he felt edgy enough as it was with the boxes in his pockets, and while he was attempting the practiced calm he had learned it did little to help him feel any less like Sherlock could see right through him. An hour later and Sherlock hopped up from his microscope, skittering about with nervous energy. John closed his laptop with a click and rose from his armchair as Sherlock pulled on his coat and scarf and trundled off down the stairs yelling back at him to come on. Grinning John took off after him and was greeted to a waiting taxi at the end of the road. "Seriously though Sherlock how do you do that? It's like you're a homing beacon for taxis!" John babbled as they squashed into the back, legs pressed right against each other. Both were secretly panicked behind a mask of calm, fearing that they would be found out. John cursed himself for putting them in his right hand pocket and Sherlock wished he had a right inside breast pocket to stash his in as well. The cab pulled up to 's and they alighted, heading straight to the morgue.
Holmes had awoken to find the other side of the bed quite bereft of the sleeping man he had been anticipating, and that had been a rather disconcerting few minutes for him. Perhaps, his mind insisted, even after the events that had unspooled between them that night, or more correctly, that morning, Watson had changed his mind - this thought had plagued him for long minutes before he strove to find Watson and adress the issue.
"I'm going to the shop when I'm dressed, anything you want?" John called out from his room. Sherlock had to bite back the retort he was about to call back, telling John that he wanted him gone so that he could do some research on proposing wouldn't really suffice. "Nothing in particular." Although John had been asleep he had been too wary of him waking to start his research. John reappeared fully dressed and stooped to Sherlock's level on the couch, smiling ther light kiss to Sherlock's cheek. Which Sherlock promptly returned, and then John repeated the action, and Sherlock followed suit until they were lip locked and John's hands had carded themselves through his hair. Sherlock pulled back just slightly, whispering between increasingly intense surges "The shopping John, you'll want tea later and not be able to have any, you can have me any time, all the time" John sighed contentedly and rose, caressing Sherlock's cheek softly before leaving.
The hedge maze had always been a favourite of Sherlock's, the physics of it all had been a great occupier of time when he was seven, especially when hiding after an experiment gone awry. The chemical spill had been one to remember, with Sherlock hiding for two days at the center because he was the only one that could get there. The maze had been specifically designed for him when Mummy had realised his abilities, her own little experiment. He remembered she had almost seemed pleased when it came out that he had been there the entire time. The centre of the maze was tranquil, the perfect spot for thinking. It housed a small conservatory and fountain that were surrounded by a sea of green. John was in awe of the ease with which Sherlock navigated, just as he had been during the first case. The maze was so very silent, it reminded him of Afghanistan in that respect. T
John toyed gently with the new ring adorning his finger and smiled, how something so utterly small could carry so much meaning was mad, but there it was. Obviously he loved Sherlock and whether they'd gotten married or not they were a done deal, for life and that was that. There was something about knowing that there was legal proof that the whole world could see that said Sherlock was his... it was exhilarating in a way he'd never thought it would be. He snuggled further back against Sherlock's chest, sleeping sitting up had done his neck no favours that was for certain, but how could he say no to another dance or another drink with the gang? After all he didn't know when he'd get to see them all together again.
John steeled himself. If he wasn’t careful, there could be no denying what he said next, and though he was quite hopeful he wouldn’t have to deny it, there was always the possibility that he would. “The other… the other is that when I do it, you... blush. The colour of it is… well. It’s quite comely on you. I think.” The fire crackled, and Holmes didn’t breathe, didn’t speak. Careful not to move too suddenly, John edged forward and put a hand on his shoulder. “Goodnight, then.” He said quietly into the stillness, and was about to turn and walk away when Holmes’s hand flew up and grasped his tightly.
John began to move, getting up. He was surprised to find Sherlock looking hurt, and then covering with the indifference he was used to. "I'm just going to the bathroom, I'll be right back" he hesitated a little before planting a soft kiss on Sherlock's forehead. He smiled involuntarily at the bemused look on Sherlock's face, clearly they would be taking this very slow. John was surprisingly fine with that. Everything about this was need for the both of them. He'd waited this long and Sherlock was most definitely worth it.
It'd just been the four of them - the brides to be, himself and Mycroft, but Greg could honestly not remember being to a better bachelor party. Maybe it was because he'd been in charge, but he doubted if anyone out had had a better night than them. The morning however... at least he'd been a good boy and had a pint of water before crashing into bed last night, avoiding the worst of the hangover. Plus, the pictures on his phone were a great way to start the day, mainly because apart from a few 'selfies' (a word his niece had taught him the last time they'd spoken on the phone) he wasn't in any of them.
Greg Lestrade was not a secretive man. He was perfectly comfortable with being open about almost every part of his life. He liked, however, to be given the option to be open if he chose. Sherlock Holmes had never made that easy, there was no option with him because he knew everything about you instantly. Which is great for a crime scene, but not so good for live people with secrets and problems. Mycroft Holmes was neither a secret nor a problem, he was just new, exciting and confusing all at once.
He had offered anything, and right now all Sherlock could think of was sleep. This golden opportunity would be wasted on something so mundane that he would almost be ashamed, if the thought of it wasn't so enticing. John's head on his pillow, his regular breathing pattern soothing Sherlock to sleep, a tentative hand in his curls maybe, the other wrapped around him, warm and possessive. It was a pleasing thought. Still, Asking for it would be uncomfortable. The likelihood of his pale complexion working against him was high, and blushing over this would make it worse. Still, it was late enough to request sleep, the sun had gone down and Sherlock was tired. With that in mind he dragged himself off the couch, tied his dressing gown more tightly around himself and made his way to the kitchen.
Sun cream applied, all four men went off to change into more weather appropriate clothes; for John and Greg that meant shorts, white  t-shirts and sandals, and a camera slung across their necks. For a Holmes that meant three quarter lengths, deck shoes and pale linen shirts with the sleeves rolled up . All ensembles were completed with various sun glasses, aviator style for Greg, the classic Ray Ban for the rest.  Mycroft pulled a parasol out of thin air and they were set (John had brought a knapsack with water bottles, food, sun cream and a small first aid kit just in case), strolling out the door and across the courtyard to a garage that seemed to know they were coming because it slid open as they walked towards it.
Sherlock, to take him away for a moment from the screaming information in his brain and just soothe him with everything he had. Something about the cottage itself, the grounds, something about them was making Sherlock let go and John was there to catch him, to coax him through.
“You're looking at RAMC Captain John Watson, two tours of Afghanistan. Trust me. Don't go there. He's young, there's every possibility that he'll be the same annoying dick he was before in a few weeks anyway. Right now though there's nothing anyone can do for him, or for you, so I'd recommend taking off, maybe getting some food into you.”
But he wasn’t in the business of leaving questions unanswered, and even if the truth was going to upset this strange sense of kinship, the equilibrium of the ignorant wasn’t worth it to him. For better or for worse, this case ended now.
Resilience was one of John's more useful traits and thanks to it he was fully functional again after a few days in bed. At his check up the doctor had been totally baffled by the speed of it, his ribs were healed entirely, the holes sealed up and scarring nicely. Even the brand on his shoulder had become just that- a brand. No blisters left and there was no sign of infection, Sherlock had been diligent in making sure John was cleaning and bandaging it every day. He still had not seen the blackened words himself, but that was mote self preservation than anything else. Seeing everything, connecting the dots, it wasn't something he would enjoy doing with this wound. He didn't really want to know the time it had taken to burn the flesh, which letters had the flame behind them for the longest, where it had been pressed in and pulled off. He had been waiting for it to be healed sufficiently that seeing it would be ok. Doctor Stapleton removed her stethescope and shrugged. "Alright Dr Watson you're healthy as a horse! Keep disinfecting your shoulder for another few days and you'll be in the clear infection wise. I hope I don't see you again too soon" She smiled kindly at him and wandered off, waving absent mindedly to him as she went.
Well, whenever John finished his shift, which left Sherlock ample time to plan his next move carefully. Caution, after all, was a skill he
"So yeah, I guess that's a plan" John smiled at Greg as they closed the door. "Hello Sherlock, Mycroft" John bustled into the kitchen. "Tea Greg?" Greg smirked at the light pink dusting the brother's faces "Ta John. Afternoon Mycroft, Sherlock" Mycroft smiled tightly while Sherlock grunted. "How does Saturday look for you?" Lestrade took out his phone. "Around eight good for you John? I've a meeting till about half seven but I should be able to make it across in no time." Sherlock looked across at a bemused Mycroft who simply shrugged, this plan was new as their calendars had no record of it. "Saturday at eight sounds good to me." Sherlock watched Greg squeeze John's arm in... Solidarity? Before John blushed and smiled at Sherlock shyly. Roll the dice Watson. "Erm Sherlock?" Sherlock's heart was pounding. Was this actually happening? "Would you maybe um...Wouldyouliketogooutonadatewithmeonsaturday?" The faster he said it the easier it was, until the words were a blur of long vowels and harsh consonant sounds. Sherlock replayed the audio again in his head just to be sure, and his face broke out into a beaming smile when he nodded. Greg cleared his throat before turning to face Mycroft who was already pretty well stunned "Mycroft would you care to join me, I think a double date requires two dates, unless I'm very much mistaken?" Greg sounded suave, confident. John kicked him for having the gall to hide his nerves. Mycroft blushed, the colour standing out against his usually neutral face,and nodded. "I believe I can clear my schedule." John turned back to the kettle and slyly high fived Greg as he passed.
In later years, Every time that they had something they couldn't express in words they would meet back there, in the bus, and sing to each other, and when the band split up they took the armchair and the bed with them to their apartment. Sometimes when the other couldn't sleep they would sing softly into their ear and watch as they relaxed into their arms again, and when, many years later, there was only one of them left, having sung him to sleep for the final time, Sherlock sang to John's headstone every night, knowing that somewhere out there, John was singing too.
John and Greg sat staring at each other through the brief exchange, fascinated by the dynamic the family had. It was quite unsurprising that Mycroft and Sherlock were the way they were if this was anything to go by. Family gatherings could not have been jovial affairs. Mummy- as all parties in the room called her for the guests did not know her name, glided to a throne like chair, heading the group. From her perch she could survey everyone. "You must be Gregory, I have heard an awful lot about you from Mycroft, you're the only worthwhile thing he has to talk about, I'm glad get to meet you, usually he would make some excuse to avoid this" she laughed softly at Greg's incredulous look at Mycroft who stared intently at his phone. John and Sherlock shared a grin at his expense. "Yes hello, and you are?" Greg held out his hand and she shook it politely. "Please, call me mummy, makes things much simpler." Greg smiled and sat back down, hoping to draw her eyes to John who sat quietly, praying that he was inconspicuous.
"How do you do it John? Forgive me for all the times I have failed you, come back each time I betray your trust, allow me to take over your life again and again when I have proved I'm not trustworthy? It's going to happen again and again because that's what I do: I ruin people's lives, I run them down and get them into situations they can't escape and they end up dead. I don't... I won't let that happen to you, I promised I would leave you alone, let you
Season’s greetings were exchanged, food was passed around the makeshift dinner table, and there were plenty of faces stuffed with cream rolls and turkey that you’d be surprised no one had managed to collapse from overeating. Bearing in mind that they were all still pretty much on duty that night, they had all agreed on no alcohol to be involved in that night’s festivities. Thus, sparkling juice replaced wine in their glasses, and too soon, it was time for the presents to be unwrapped before they were all to return to their lives outside the staff lounge.
“Let’s dispense with the pleasantries, shall we? Invalided army doctor, prefers to spend nights in not-so-comfy hospital chairs rather than back at your own apartment, albeit one you dislike at best; you have an elder brother who’s drinking his life away and, judging by your frown lines, still not entirely in control of your psychosomatic limp. No, don’t look at me like that, the limp is only gone now when you’re doing the night shift. Evidently you still miss the desert grit and violence. Now be a dear and run along like the rest of your incompetent team. While you’re at it, get me my release papers,” his patient shot back.
He eyed it dubiously before tentatively running his hand over the smooth blood-red wrapping paper. Sherlock glanced at his parents once again for permission before pulling the ribbon apart, delicately removing the wrapping paper and lifting the lid. He pulled out the lump of material inside and unfolded it to find himself staring at a gorgeous Belstaff coat of a very dark navy blue colour. It was mostly wool but comfortable enough to wear in London weather and Sherlock was simply

"There are more. Even you should be able to gather that obviously the solution will become apparent as you continue on. Now, either be silent and sit here to wait or read on." Sherlock spat and turned back to look ahead. Lestrade cleared his throat and picked up the next one. The letter was dirty, gritty with sand bleached by the sun. "This one is dated the 26th of December 2010 and is from a man named John Watson." Sherlock interrupted. "Captain or Doctor to you. Take your pick." Greg sighed "Fine Captain John Watson. Dear Sherlock Holmes, I'm going to hazard a guess that your brother is the one who added an address to the bottom of your letter. He could have made a bit more of an effort in emulating your writing, his is nothing like yours. I suppose I ought to thank you for the letter, it was probably the single best part of my day which is unsurprising given the fact that I'm in a warzone, you know, people dying all around me and what not. It was hands down the single strangest one of those letters I've ever read and thank God for that! Usually it's just some old bird waxing on and on about how they're forever in our debt and how proud they are that we're fighting the good fight. At least yours was interesting. You shouldn't do drugs you know, bit not good that. I should know, I'm a doctor. But I think you already know that, and you're clearly staying clean because that brother of yours seems the type to lock you away for any relapse. You work with the police then I take it? I have to say (though it sounds awful) that the case you're working on is quite interesting, haven't got any news of London for as long as I've been stationed here so it's good to hear that it's still as... Violent? As ever. I hope you get the suspect acquitted, can't say I'd not be impressed. You seem like a very smart man Sherlock Holmes so I'm not going to wish you a 'pleasant festive season' I'm going to wish you a good case. If you do respond, I'd love to hear all about it, and how you solved it. Best wishes, Cpt. John Watson RAMC."
He'd only seen the madman two weeks ago for Christ's sake, and he'd been resigned to probably never seeing him again. A part of him wondered which was better: never meeting again, or meeting like this, across IV drips and defibrillators. John knew, selfishly, that seeing Sherlock in any capacity was always going to be important to him. Soulmate or no, Sherlock had brought something into his life that had made him actually
"This." John breathed it into the scant space between their mouths and then, with one last look into his eyes, closed the distance and kissed him. The inhuman noise that wrenched from Sherlock's throat as lips, warm and wanting, met his own was almost a sob, and before he thought about what he was doing he was clutching John to him, hands scrabbling for purchase at his back, and they were suddenly pressed together from head to toe.
A/N I don't even know... We haven't seen any Anderson or Donovan so I just... Deal with it. Also decided Anderson is called Jim cuz why the hell not
Sherlock rolled his eyes and did the same, revelling internally at the glorious sound of paper being torn apart. Lestrade's gift was the first that came to hand, a large box that was quite weighty and had been wrapped in newspaper as well as wrapping paper, both of which were covered in pictures of the deerstalker. John giggled from behind him as he opened it. A box full of cold cases was nothing to be laughed at and he caught Lestrade's eye to give a nod of thanks before moving onto the next one. Quite obviously from Lucia, a sleekly wrapped black box containing a beautifully designed phone that had obviously been enhanced, and a small post-it informing him that Mycroft hadn't been aware of it's existence and had therefore not put his blasted monitoring systems in was just an added bonus.
Sherlock’s face softened just a touch and he finally looked up. “Really, I’m sure. I’ll… see you tomorrow?”
"I did say that love is the most vicious of motivators, why just last-- wait. Repeat yourself precisely, exactly what you just said." A gleam, bright with the turning of wheels in his mind overtook Holmes' eyes and Watson struggled to mimic himself exactly.
Sherlock looked down at the hand that the doctor had been holding. It had felt… right, somehow, to have their hands intertwined, the doctor’s roughened fingers warmly nestled alongside his own. Beyond that, though, Sherlock couldn’t seem to ascertain if he felt anything else for the other man.

Sherlock however chuckled as the train was announced over the tannoy. "As ever Lestrade, you see but you do not observe." and he was dashing off to the back of the train, hopping from one foot to the other excitedly. The doors opened and out came a short blonde man wearing a wooly jumper and a crooked smile. Sherlock pounced on him, wrapping his arms around the man who did the same in return. "I thought I told you to be careful?" Sherlock hissed, voice muffled by the wool but still audible to the astounded
He wondered about how long he expected himself to keep up this image of a stable, focused career man. As a child, he envisioned going out into the field and saving lives. He envisioned a long, satisfying life spent healing wounds and improving quality of life for others. What he didn't envision though, was constantly being on the receiving end of his father’s abusive habits at an early age.
For once, he had let his heart rule his head, and he had literally chased John Watson to his front door. The door to the staff lounge, mind you, but what does it matter? Evidently he had mistaken John’s compassion for interest in something more. He had left heartbroken, seeing John kiss that nurse. It had only served to remind him that John deserved someone better. Someone normal, just like Mary.
"Good, we can do that some other time" Sherlock stared up at him. "If you'd like. I mean it's not like you have to or anything" Sherlock cut him off and rolled them over so he was on top. "I think I would like that very much" He ground his hips against John's, bathing in the groan it elicited. "Fucking hell" John moved until they were perfectly aligned and reached a hand between them. John had rather small hands, but big enough for this. Mouths still locked he began to stroke up and down, circling the slit and moving back to the base, spreading precum over both of them. Sherlock was moaning his name over and over, reveling in this new sensation that was blazing through his entire body. John's hand moved faster, both men gasping. "John I'm... I" John flicked his wrist and Sherlock was coming, spurting over John's stomach and seeing this John followed suit, shuddering against each other until they were spent and John flopped against Sherlock.
"I have to go but if this, if I'm something you might be interested in, I put my address in your phone and I'm there all week after today. Come see me." John breathed against his lips and then stepped back as a darkly coloured car pulled onto the runway, waving gently and then racing off with a phone against his ear. Sherlock for his part stood shocked on the tarmac, fingers tracing the imprint of John's lips on his.
Squeezing Sherlock's hand, Father spoke. “Son, you'd be surprised to know that I, too, didn't believe in soulmates, until your mother came along. I may not have looked like it but I was very quiet as a little boy, for a period of time, quite the unsociable outcast. I did not want anything to do with anyone and whatever friends I had, I couldn't keep for more than a year, at best. I had myself convinced that no one in the world understood me. That belief flew out the window when I made friends with this lady right here,” he gave Mummy a nudge and wide smile, “she opened my eyes to what I'd been missing, and more importantly, she opened my heart. Everything else was history, and it was just a bonus that we eventually realised our soulmate numbers matched up.”
John, satisfied with his patient's progress, went over to the nearby bin to dump his used gloves. He then washed his hands thoroughly and proceeded to direct the stranger to one of the small office-like rooms situated on that floor.
Aside from anything else, the real problem was that there was a complete lack of reciprocation on his part, and John, being dense, would need the clear indication that Sherlock too was interested in this new facet of their relationship. And also, though slightly less so, the fact that John may not actually be' on the same page' as it were. He'd have to figure it out and once he did--
“Well… uh… I… He's uhm, blonde but leaning towards a sort of brown, short enough that you'd think people would notice but they don't, probably because he has a sort of … presence. He fills up a room even when he's the only one in it, and while he isn't exactly a genius, he's pretty damned smart, except for the psychosomatic limp but that is easily fixed, and he's a bit sarcastic but also genuinely kind to people who definitely,” Sherlock swallowed roughly, “definitely do not deserve it. His name is John, and we are little more than acquaintances at best despite Mycroft's
The fact that John Watson had his attention from the first moment, and was holding it even now, even though they would likely never meet again, a thought that made his throat tight and his stomach drop.
John brought Sherlock back to him and dipped them both low, "Really John how clichéd are we being-" but he never did finish that sentence because John's lips were taking every word.
The arrival of food put a stop to that as John's stomach began to rumble. Sherlock released his hand and John dug in, burning his mouth slightly on the soup. It earned him a slight click of the tongue from Sherlock. "Yeah, yeah… I'm an idiot, play a different tune will you" John joked, rolling his eyes. Sherlock chuckled, the silky baritone resounding through them both. "Hasty: maybe, idiot: never." There it was again. That irritating stomach flip. Every time Sherlock said something even bordering on kind it happened. The soft tone Sherlock took when he said it made John's heart flutter in his chest, he could feel the nervous energy rolling off the taller man in waves. It was quite frankly adorable the way he felt so unsure of whether the things he said would cause an adverse reaction. He was vulnerable and that alone told John more than anything he could have said. "Why now?" John had been pondering for a little while, but when it came to the silver eyed genius that sat across from him he was at a loss. "I was afraid. That you weren't feeling the same and one wrong move would ruin everything. You might not realise it John but you have become one of the most important aspects of my life and I didn't want to scare you away." John was shocked at his candor. "You were right of course, I needed time to come to grips with all of it, I needed that. But thank you." Sherlock's brow furrowed. "For what, John?" John smiled. "For being braver than me. I never would have worked up the courage to act on anything; I honestly had no idea you even considered
Instead he pulled John's face to his and kissed him. Well he tried to, he wasn't quite sure if he was doing it right because in theory he knew what was expected but as a practical example this was his first attempt so there was room for error but still there he was, cold lips pressed forcefully against John's. For his part John was very still, which, while not conducive to the "kissing experience that ended in quite a lot of sex" Sherlock had been hoping for, was definitely an improvement on trying to run away. Sherlock only pulled back when he was 86.5% sure John wouldn't be going anywhere if he stared at him with a little surprised 'o' mouth and Sherlock preened a bit at the flushed pink of his cheeks.
John loved him back. The words whirled around in his mind palace, filling his John room to bursting. He understood now why people felt the need to say it to each other. Sherlock had known how he felt about John and how John felt about him. It was in every word they spoke, everything they did for each other showed him that they loved one another, but this was so much more. It was confirmation that he was not alone, that he would never be alone again. He smiled down and brushed his hand lightly across John's cheek before leaning in and kissing him gently, careful not to hurt him.
Their cases had seen them travel a great many places, and meet all sorts of people of contradicting tastes and beliefs, and John had come to the conclusion that his love, be it for a woman, a man, or, more specifically for Sherlock Holmes, was something to be enjoyed rather than quashed.
"I never met John without Sherlock until after the fall. They were inseparable, always working and dashing about together and it was clear that they were the closest two friends could be without crossing the boundary into being lovers. The best thing about being invisible is that you get to see everything. Every time John's eyes would linger when Sherlock turned away from him, how they orbited each other all the time, the way Sherlock would stare at John for hours on end, especially if he'd drifted off and he thought no one was watching. Then when Moriarty set him up he looked... As if his whole world were crumbling around him, which it was, but only when John looked away, because when he was there, Sherlock could pretend he would be coming out the other side. He died for John, and John would have died defending him, nearly did the way he worked to get Sherlock aqquited of all crimes. Sherlock lived with me for a while and he'd wake up and call for John in the night, beg for John when he was ill or injured, I even saw him crying a few times and when I asked him what was wrong he'd just show me blurry cctv footage of John doing something heartbreaking like taking one of Sherlock's pillows to bed with him or noting down the results of the experiments he'd left behind or just staring at the sofa with a wry smile. When he realised that John needed the cane again he was inconsolable for days. Sure he worked every day and most nights to stop Moriarty's web but John was all he thought of. When he was finally able to go home he thought John would hate him, that he'd be left loving this man who couldn't stand him and he was dejected before he even set foot outside the door. I was on the stairs when he knocked and John opened up. He blinked a
When he did finally find words, They didn't satisfy Sherlock's need to express the depth of his feelings.
Sebastian was pleased to find the new gas worked even better than the last, the twelve minutes of hallucination had really been a spanner in his plans. Now that Watson was asleep he could finally take a look around the place he had watched for so long. It felt surreal being inside after staring through windows for such an extended period, Like a film star at a premier. The game was simple. Sebastian had calculated it all very carefully, he had promised Jim that if there came a point where he was out of the picture that he would take over. The genius would be compelled to search for his blogger and his brother would provide a perfect middle man, his extensive cctv would finally have a use. Jim had gifted him all of his favourite toys, using them to fulfil his wishes seemed rather appropriate. The upstairs room housed John's uniform and though it was not integral in the scheme of things it was a personal touch, a warning. He bounded down the stairs with it in his arms and dressed the unconscious doctor in it, glaring at the captain's badge on his sleeve. That was the place to begin. When he was fully clothed Sebastian tossed him on the sofa and ate some food, knowing it would at the very least rile Holmes. Lighting a cigarette, Sebastian leaned back against the counter and looked at the London streets far below, filled with people who had no clue how very different their days would have gone had John not returned. There was no need to be cautious now, his audience would be watching carefully regardless, glued to the screen. He giggled, the motion wracked his body for a minute or so and then he sidled back to the couch. He threw the limp form over his shoulder with ease, constant training and exercise had made him incredibly strong. Jim had liked the muscles. Sebastian tightened his grip around John and slammed the door shut with a low click.
John grinned and nodded firmly “Tomorrow afternoon. Try to eat something, Mrs Hudson will probably come up later with tea. See you then.” Quickly, because he really was going to miss the train if he didn’t hurry up, John pulled on his coat and waved goodbye before running out the door.
"What about Debbie? She seems like she'd be down, and I heard that bunk seven girls are all looking for some action tonight, some sort of pact." Mike thought about it but then shook his head, scratching her name off their list of potential girls for John.
"I want to do it too, and whether or not the government thinks so, it's official to me and to you and that's all that matters. Part of me wishes things were different, that I could tell the whole world about you and how much you mean to me, and one day maybe we'll be able to do that too but for now, I want to marry you, so I'm going to go down to the lake, and in ten minutes exactly you're going to follow me, and marry me in front of the only two people in the world that know about us and it's then we'll start the rest of our lives together." John's answering kiss was lightning and Sherlock almost didn't want to break away and leave, but he had to. John's desire to be with him in the most permanent way he could think of was the only reason he let him go, but the ten minutes he had to wait before following him were torture.
That had been back in August, and since then Greg had even met Mary a few times, but not so often that, when her name popped up on his phone, he wasn't alarmed.
Times like these, he wished he had someone to back him up. Or, he wished he had the foresight to be at least bothered to wait for Lestrade and the rest before giving chase. Sherlock often did not have the upper hand when he had to resort to hand-to-hand combat, and right now, he was running out of options, fast. Adding to that, he was still not at his physical peak, having just barely recovered from an almost fatal overdose. Somehow his decisions of late hadn't been the best.
He was currently on his dinner break, but was not feeling up to eating anything. He thus had an hour to spare - instead of lazing around in the pantry, he made up his mind to visit Sherlock. Seeing that youthful, troubled face relaxed and free of tension, John’s shoulders slumped in exhaustion and before he knew what he was doing, his left hand had reached out and wrapped itself around the pale, bony hand that was resting atop the blankets. Sherlock’s skin felt smooth and chilled beneath his own calloused, warm hand, John noted.
"It's getting late. Perhaps we should retire. I trust you all know where you'll be staying in the house? It hasn't changed since last year." Murmurs of assent were scattered, and satisfied that they would find their way Orabelle opened the door and let them free. "Don't worry, I'll make your excuses with the rest of the family. Goodnight all." Greg handed the boys over to Orabelle after receiving two enthusiastic kisses on the cheek and sidled over to Mycroft who ignored him, again. He shook his head and threw his hands in the air. "Right. Goodnight all, it was lovely to meet you and I'll see you in the morning." He left the room alone and Ford tilted his head to the side with a frown. "Mycroft, why are you ignoring your boyfriend? Gregory is a very kind man, I don't see what you're trying to achieve." Mycroft's eyebrows flew to his hairline and he looked around the room to find everyone, even the girls giving him confused looks. "He's trying to maintain his golden reputation with the relatives. It wouldn't do for the British government to be gay now would it?" Sherlock scoffed. "Oh. Well. We can be trusted you know Mycroft. In front of us there doesn't need to be any of that messing." Aurora said and there was a chorus of yes's. "Mr. Greg is really nice, and you made him sad." Athena frowned. "You should probably apologise." Artemis finished with crossed arms. Mycroft looked into the supportive faces around him and wondered why the rest of the family couldn't be as accepting as these were. Maybe, when the oldest generation died out, they could breathe a little, until then however he'd stick to the group in front of him now. "I... excuse me." he all but ran out.
Mycroft took in a sharp intake of breath at that last sentence, and Father did nothing but reach out and grab hold of Sherlock's wrist on the table. Sherlock's father very rarely offered advice as it was mostly his wife's role in the family, but it was here and now that he found it apt to take up the responsibility, and show Sherlock that his parents would always be there for him to fall back on when he needed comfort.
Once the snow speckled couple had 'finally deigned to grace us with your presence' Orabelle lead them all upstairs, chattering on as they went. "Let's see… tomorrow lunch will be served at two thirty, I invited dear Martha to join us but she's visiting her sister for the holidays so it will just be the six of us. I am assuming that you all brought presents?" she asked with a sly glance at the suitcases laying at the doors to their respective rooms. "We can do presents afterwards, and then in the evening les Holmes français ont arrivé which is perfect because I for one have been waiting an awfully long time to hear -" Greg attempted - in vain - to stifle a yawn and like the ordinary, doting mother she was Orabelle chivvied them all to bed. Within the pine scented confines of their room John splayed himself starfish style across the majority of the bed, Sherlock wouldn't be sleeping anyway. Sherlock lay with his violin clutched in his hands plucking the strings in a melancholy tone. "John?" he whispered, checking if his fiance was awake. "Yeah?" John called back to him, concern evident in his voice. Sherlock sounded unsure, and that just didn't happen. "I've been… researching." Sherlock paused dramatically and John waited for the second half of that sentence to arrive before he let his imagination run away with him. "Surrogates. I've been researching surrogates for us and I have realised that was probably not the best thing to do because most couples do this together and what not, and we're not yet married but… It's Christmas." and John, his wonderful, clever John, understood almost immediately. It was Christmas, and while they were surrounded by family and friends, there was a sense that the place was empty. He didn't want to spend another Christmas alone. "That's 'kay Sh'rlock, s'long as we make the final decision together I don't mind you doing your thing. We'll… start the whole process in motion when we get home?" Sherlock was upon him before he had the chance to register movement in the dark room.
When he was younger, though, he had never really pictured the life he was living now… Now was excitement, staying up late at night going of case files, chasing suspects till four in the morning, and now was loving a moody consulting detective who pouted when he didn't get his way.
Notes: This is it guys! This is the last chapter! Since I had gotten a few replies that people would stick with me if the rating were to go up. This is my first time ever writing smut so, I know it isn't so great. I wanted to make the moment soft and sweet. They deserve some happiness after all I've put them through. So, if you see anything wrong or you could help me with the smut that would be appreciated :D.
The ambulance seemed to take an eternity to arrive. When Sherlock had finally been loaded up into the emergency vehicle, John's expressive face closed down into a stern blank mask. He answered the questions fired off by the Paramedic almost robotically. To an onlooker, John would have appeared totally in control, but John had felt as if everything was moving in slow motion, or as if his entire world had been shaken to the point of ruin. '
Notes: It gets better I promise! They're... just going through a hard time. I have good plans for this story and it doesn't end here. :D I hope I have done The Fall some justice. I'm sorry this is so late! My life has been hectic lately! I'm in a play currently and have tons of lines to memorize, I have a HUGE test coming up (the kind that determines your future big), and I've been out of town *sweatdrop*. I'll try to have eight up by tomorrow! I'm pretty much finished, I just got to run it by my extraordinary Beta! Next chapter: The threads are finally explained! (sorta...kinda)
“Here, John. I-I want you to have this. I-I can’t…I just can’t keep this anymore. Harry would want you to have it anyway. She wanted to surprise you with a new phone for your birthday anyway. It seems only fitting that you just take this one,” she states, refusing to look at John in case the tears return at full force. John tries to refuse, but Clara quickly tramples that down with, “I…I just can’t look at it anymore, John. Please?” Begrudgingly, John nods his acceptance.
As if sensing his thoughts, Sherlock bows his head and whispers an, “I love you,” against his mate’s lips before gently capturing them with his own. This is what the night was missing. He didn’t need flashing lights, alcohol, or (to use Sherlock’s word) exotic dancers to have a good time. Being in their flat with the man he loved the most, was all the celebration John needed.
In Clara’s letter, John reads of Harry’s self-destruction and alcoholism. The distraught Clara details how she put Harriet through several courses of rehab with the promise of success only for Harriet to relapse a month later. An ultimatum was then given: Clara or the booze. Surprisingly, Harriet stopped drinking. She promised not to touch the stuff, and so far, she had been truthful. The problem now lies in the fact that Harriet is now taking artificial emotions.
', didn't explain any of the details and had led Sherlock to believe that it was someone other than John. Of course the consulting detective refused any other mate other than his beloved blogger. He has finally found, in his opinion, his soul mate, and doesn't need a red thread to confirm it.
The child-like detective’s eyes continue to shine as he quietly tries to say, “But you said—,” before John interrupts, “I know what I said, Sherlock, but I didn’t mean it. You are the most precious thing in this world to me, and for making you feel like otherwise will forever haunt me. You are brilliant, love.” The younger man blushes at the familiar praise, but looks away with an air of melancholy as he says, “It’s okay, John. You don’t have to try and make me feel better. I’ve always known that I am a freak. It was wrong of me to assume otherwise.”
When they arrive at the Holmes’ residence, Sherlock quickly goes to find his mother and father in the kitchen as John departs and goes to find Mary in the living room. As soon as he enters the room, Mary begins struggling to stand, but John walks over to her and helps her up. He quickly lets go of her hand and steps back to regard her silently. There is a long pause in which neither of them say anything. Despite the peace John feels in his decision, John can’t help the white-hot anger that spills through him at the sight of the woman he once proudly called his wife. Mary’s face screws up in justified apprehension and worry at the prospect of what John will say.
As Sherlock had expected, John explodes, “Sherlock, why the hell did you do that? What on Earth were you thinking? What possible inclination did I give that made you think that I would ever want to see her again?!” Sherlock curses his transport as he unsubtly flinches at John’s tone, but he completely ignores what John said as he replies, “While your anger is understandable, it is completely unnecessary.”
The only solace he achieved was when he was able to go into his rooms or work in the labs in the Science department the school provided. Sherlock wasn’t able to always avoid Sebastian and more often than not, he would return to his room with bruises he hadn’t originally left with. When he had finally graduated, he developed a cold mask of indifference and a hardened heart.
Notes: I'm sorry for the Angst guys! Next chapter WILL be fluffy. I promise! Another thing... The threads are back! (They are staying too! :D) I'm not sure if I have mentioned it to you all, but I have to move the update days to Wednesday and Saturday. My life is going crazy and I've got too much on my plate at the moment. I hope, when all this junk is over, that I will be able to update sooner. Until then, please bare with me! I'm working on the story I swear! :D (p.s. I found that text about dying and biscuits on tumblr. I didn't come up with it unfortunately )
Sherlock stares at the fresh cuts that now litter his pale skin before he carves one, last vertical gash into his arm before he drops the razor blade onto the ground and stares blankly at the needle sitting just a few feet away from him. He thinks back to what John said just two days ago. As he remembers the hateful words that fell from thinned, angry lips, his mind seems to play them on repeat along with all the other insults his brain could unhelpfully supply (which just-so-happened to be them all, he could never truly delete them no matter how hard he had tried). The memory grew stronger and stronger, and the detective tried to block out the sound by placing his hands roughly into raven curls and pulling. John's hatred only continued to reverberate against his mind palace's walls louder and louder until he hastily tied the tourniquet and forcefully grabbed the needle, poised just out of reach of his inner elbow—ready to be plunged in, with trembling and clumsy fingers. The self-loathing only mounted as he realized that John was right. He was a freak... A machine... A monster.  He had somehow ruined it all. There was no point in staying anymore. He had failed and lost the one person he had promised to protect.
John seems to have been lost in thought until a jarring motion brings him back to the white hospital room. "Let. Me.
I hate to do this and I apologize.... I'm going to have to update now on Wednesday and Saturday. I'm working on getting the updates done but I'm not sure I can do it for Monday. (again, sorry!)
flat that is devoid of bullet holes and a watchful yellow smiling face painted upon the wall. He 'lives' his life. He wakes up every day, limping around the confined space, just going through the motions.
"Nothing can stay hidden forever, no matter how much it is wished, because just two months later John became aware of Sherlock's dark past."
Sherlock only had to wait for about ten minutes before another text was received, telling him that the car was parked outside. Sherlock grabs his coat and trade-mark scarf before making his way to the door. There, he hesitates only momentarily before calling up the stairs to John room informing him that he would be back shortly. When no reply came, he was out the door thundering down the stairs before slamming the other door on the ground level. He was in the car his brother had sent him in only a matter of minutes. This is one of the only few times Sherlock can remember being thrilled to see his brother.
Sherlock stands from where he lay sprawled out across the sofa, to stand in front of John. "I agree. We should settle this estrangement between us."
In the end, the women, was defeated by sentiment. She had been a worthy adversary and it had been fun watching John squirm but, like every case Sherlock has been assigned to, it was solved and came to an untimely end.
The Consulting Detective rolls his eyes, but eventually states, “John, really, she’s your wife. She’ll do something to gain your trust again. You can’t stay mad at her forever. You’re going to have a baby. You’re going to have to forgive her eventually, for your child, if nothing else.” The older man’s blood burns through his veins as Sherlock remains impassive, apathetic, and imperious when he has no idea what he is talking about.
University wasn’t much better. When Sherlock sat down for his first lecture, an obnoxious man sat close by spouting off his latest sexual escapades. Sherlock took one look at the offending man and knew his life’s story. Sherlock quickly stands and spouts off, “Wrong! You are clearly lying! You have touched your noise nine times throughout your speech which indicates falsehood. There is also the fact that there is a white stain near the button of your trousers. I wonder what that could be!” He says sarcastically and filled with scorn. “You haven’t met your soulmate and I know that the only woman, or nurturing person, currently present in your life is your mother. I know that because your clothes have been ironed, tailored and washed, not by you, by a professional. It is possible that you go and get them professionally done, but there is a sentimental touch to each stitch. Ergo, mother. The girlfriend is an easy observation to make due to the fact that you have no one to seek from someone else. Obvious!”After Sherlock sits back down, the lecture hall explodes with laughter and jeers. Sebastian stands quickly and exits the room, but not before he can step up to Sherlock and menacingly whisper, “You will pay for this.”

Before you say anything, no. This isn't *really* a case fic. This case was just to get Sherlock interested in the crimes. To lure him in, if you will. This case won't really come up again. I just needed to connect point A to point B, in all honesty and I felt that this was a good way to do it. As always, happy reading, everyone.
to 221B. He pretends that he didn't drive John away and that he is just taking a shower or sleeping in his room. One can only pretend for so long.
you. I told you this before this whole mess started! I wouldn't leave you no matter how much of a pompous arse you are! You are the single most important person in my life and it bloody gutted me to see you lying on the floor like that. I was so afraid you had died. I was afraid I had lost you." John's breath caught on the last sentence and he buries his head again.
Slowly, Sherlock shakes his head before stating, “Mary, this isn’t like you. Who is making you do this? Please, I can help you!” The ex-assassin smiles darkly as she replies, “Oh, Sherlock. No one is making me. I became this all on my own. Haven’t you figured it out yet?” She slides off his lap, folds her hands behind her back and begins circling once more. Sherlock’s eyes narrow briefly as he tries to get his drug muddled mind to work, properly before it finally clicks as. When it does, he jerks back so violently that he almost tips his chair over. His verdigris eyes bore into hers as he mutters in disgust, “It’s been you, hasn’t it? All these murders. Those people...Mary, people are dyin—.”

He carefully lays Sherlock down on the sofa and then walks into the kitchen to prepare tea. He takes two mugs down along with two tea bags, fills the kettle with water and sets it on the stove to boil. When the high shrilling sound is heard, John carefully pours the boiling water into the, tea bag filled, mugs and gives it a stir. He takes out the milk and pours the perfect amount into his own cup before doing the same to the other. Once the liquid has turned the right color, he removes the tea bags and measures out two spoonfuls of sugar into Sherlock's mug.
A small smile spreads across Sherlock's seemingly passive face until he wipes away all traces of emotion and responds in an indifferently with, "Experiment, John." The frustrated doctor mutters a few grumbled responses about having to constantly buy milk because a certain someone uses it all. John leaves his abandoned tea and instead stomps back up the stairs and into their shared room in order to change his clothes. When he comes back down the stairs, he utters an exasperated goodbye and then he was out the door on his way to the to the nearest the hour is up Mycroft arrives, as promised, bearing a pair of wedding rings along with the matching engagement rings. When Sherlock opens the box, the plain titanium bands gleam up at him.
When he finally leaves one of Mycroft's many houses, the consulting detective springs into action. He begins packing his meager belongings
But on one sunny day in January, Mrs. Hudson calls him and asks him to remove some of Sherlock's old book. So, with a heavy footsteps and heart, John travels once again to 221B Baker Street. When the cab drops him off at the front of the building, he reaches one shaky hand forward, turns the doorknob, opens the door, and continues up the stairs to the familiar flat. Instead of a cheery Mrs. Hudson, he sees a man that invade his dreams nightly and was said to be dead. "Hello John."
thoroughly as Janine leaves, presumably, for work. Sherlock’s fond smile slips off his face completely as he goes back to case mode in the blink of an eye. Whilst this is all occurring, a disbelieving smile spreads across his face and he tries to subtly look around the room for cameras for that ‘Gotcha!’ moment. When he finds none, his smile slowly turns into one crestfallen shock. When John is sure Janine has gone, he finally turns back to the detective, clears his throat, and tries desperately to hide his jealousy as he questions Sherlock about the nature of his relationship with Janine.
After those words are uttered, Sherlock and John both drift off into sleep with smiles on their faces.
My roomate, Kay, listened to this chapter and at the end, she stated, "Why does it have to be an odd number (this is technically chapter 7)?! Why can't it be an even number?! Even numbers are divisable by 2 and it takes to people to make love!!!" Needless to say, she was advocating for the love to be known from the beginning. She did not succeed XD.
So, this is sad, I know. It seems like things aren't going to turn out well. I know it feels likes some stories just won't end the way you want them to, but, I promise you, that things will be alright. Even now, I'm so distraught over season 4, episode 3 did not end with Johnlock, but I am so proud and happy to be a part of such a wonderfully incredible community that sticks toghether and creates our own endings. You'll get this happy ending. I always want to reassure you of that, and because I am gay myself that means that I plan to continue to strive for more LGBT content, even if I have to create that content myself. Sorry. I've been thinking A LOT lately about a lot of things and it spilled over here. I'll get on to the notes. ^_^;

Without turning around, Sherlock states, “As much as it pains me to say, I owe Mycroft a favor. I was stupid to assume that he would do what I asked solely because it mattered so much to me. I am in debt to him, and normally, I would be able to refuse his demands, but I must pay this debt.”
He must get out of here. He needs to get away before he does something incredibly stupid like punch the detective in the face or hug him tightly until he finds out what is wrong because he
is carved into his skin in striking red letters. John takes a dish towel in hand and presses the wound with one hand, and with the other checks for a pulse. When one is found (barely there but there is one) John lets out the breath and tears he had been holding and steadily reaches for his mobile.
,’ John thinks bitterly as he begins to recklessly grabs the box containing Christmas lights from Mrs. Hudson’s flat and then begins to pound his way back up the stairs. All the while struggling with the front door, which he does not close after finally getting it open after five minutes of fumbling, and the Christmas boxes as he continues to viciously think,
Sherlock's shoulders visibly deflate and his eyes cast downward. When he does reply it's in a quiet hesitant tone, "I never thought I would have a soulmate. When I had found John, though, I had given up. I knew I was doomed to never find love and that I would always be alone. He had tried to court me on our first case together but I didn't want anyone, at the time, who wasn't my soulmate. Soon all that had changed and I found myself reluctantly in love with him. When we had found out that we are threadmates it no longer mattered, it just added to the love I already possessed. I constantly worry that he will find someone better. I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet, yet John loves me anyway. I don't deserve him. I've put him through so much. I just want this to be good for him. I just want to do one good thing for him after all the damage I've caused."
When the car has stopped outside of the Diogenes Club Sherlock quickly makes his way to the back room in which his brother occupies. Once they are completely alone, Sherlock begins to speak, "I wish to marry John." Mycroft's ever smug expression slips only momentarily into one of confusion before it is firmly back in place when he replies with, "Of course, brother. Congratulations….What does any of this have to do with me?"

“You’re become repetitive...or don’t you remember? What was it that he said again? Right.” She clears her throat and suddenly her face morphs into something dark as she shouts, “THAT’S WHAT PEOPLE
what's in front of them!" When Sherlock had finished ranting, he crossed his arms over his chest and glared at the wall as if it had all been its fault. John just quietly laughed and reached for Sherlock's hand in order to pacify the agitated detective. Unfortunately he noticed something.
It was all because of his damn pride, and he took his anger out on the one person who did not deserve it. He knew he shouldn’t have said it. As soon as the words had escaped past his treacherous lips, he instantly wished he could take them back. He would give anything to banish the look of absolute anguish that passed across Sherlock’s angular features as he nodded and left the room. John had seriously screwed up, and he has no idea how he was going to fix it.
Seems to be the recurring thought for John as he lay, just like the soldier previously, bleeding out. Just before he loses consciousness, his red thread flickers. Once...twice…..and then fades away as if it had never been present. For the first time in twelve years, John’s eyes well up and the tears slip past tightly shut lids as he silently mourns his loss. He’s crying silently…...when one cries silently it's because they just can't stop.
' His smile then widens as he looks over to his left and sees the sleeping man. If Sherlock had to think of a word to describe this moment, even though he would scorn himself later for such
By the time Sherlock has finished the self depreciated thoughts he finds himself in the kitchen in front of the mirror.
March 31st, 1972 starts out like any other normal day. Marideth Watson knew that any day now she would be welcoming her second baby into the world, and she was so excited! As her contractions start, however, the excitement ebbs a bit. Today was the day. Geoffrey Watson had already prepared an overnight bag for Marideth, and their toddler named Harriet is staying with her grandmother. The two adults load into the car and Geoffrey makes the short trip to the hospital. Once there, doctors and nurses quickly grab a wheelchair and whisk Mrs. Watson away and into a room to check up on her periodically. Everything seemed to be going well. Everything seemed fine.
When the pair withdraws, Sherlock’s bowtie was, once again, askew. The consulting detective’s face was set in a firm scowl as he moodily repositions his bowtie for what seemed like the hundredth time that morning. “I hate these horrid things,” Sherlock grumbles. John walks up to his moody fiancé and gently places a chaste kiss against his cheek and whisper, “I think you look beautiful, love.”
Sherlock’s eyes blink rapidly for several long seconds before he sucks in a sharp breath, face guarded but his eyes are full of hope as he haltingly asks, “W-what do you mean by that? You know you are always welcome here.”
The sad look from before passes across his bright eyes briefly until he nods his head, his soft smile never truly leaving his face while his eyes remain impossibly sad as he lisps out a , “S’okay, Jawn. I know.” The detective draws John into a warm embrace, the doctor’s face presses into Sherlock’s shirt. He could swear that the ghost of lips once again press against John’s hairline, before the detective saunters away to his room before John can really make sense of any of it.
The once self-assured, confident, ebony haired man has now been reduced to a sniveling, crying mess on the hardwood floors. He doesn’t know how long he sits there, but when he does stand again, his feet have gone numb and his face feels tight where the tears have dried on his cheeks. He buries his hands into thick curls and pulls to try and ground himself before he is walking swiftly into the bedroom and over to the bookshelf sitting in the corner. He pulls down a copy of
Sherlock’s head whips around at breakneck speed as he instantly drops his arms and straightens to his full height. A scarlet blush spreads across his cheeks and his eyes widen as Sherlock realizes he’s been caught doing something sentimental and incredibly ridiculous.
Sherlock was laying on the bed, facing the wall, with his back turned away from John. When Sherlock feels John's presence his body goes rigid as he awaits for the punishing words that were sure to fall from John's mouth. When none came his curiosity had gotten the better of him and he turned his head slightly to see John's face. '
Notes: This chapter is super short and I'm sorry! I didn't get to write yesterday. I was having a super bad day, and when I do that I write angst. I promised myself that this would end well and did not want to kill off the main characters when I was in such a bad mood. I hope you like this one though. Rating will possibly go up in the next chapter. I have to apologize though, there isn't a lot of dialog and because of that, It probably sucks. I plan to add more in the next chapters. Also, I haven't decided on this yet, but I may upload the next chapter today as well due to the fact that this one is so small. Let me know what you think! If you see any mistakes, let me know :).
He picks up the last photo before turning back to Lestrade and saying, "The killer is the type to parade in front of family members, pretend to be grieving over the loss of such a talented woman, but is secretly joyful and giddy. Her hatred and resentment for the three women, grew until she just couldn't stand it anymore. Our killer doesn't have a talent. No one believes she will ever really amount to anything. She finally broke one night when Brianna had called to tell her the exciting news. She was getting accepted into an animation studio which was her dream job. Alicia is your killer. She drove over and killed her after having an argument about said job in which Alicia wanted her to decline. She had already killed her younger sister and mother, one more wouldn't have made a difference." Brianna's father steps angrily forward at the accusation against his middle child but stops when he saw Alicia's face.
Two chapters in one day! Don't get used to it! It will not happen very often. I wanted to post both, though, because I am giving you the option so that you don't have to read the Prologue.
Wilkes looks at the amateur detective and laughs, “See! I was right.” John purses his lips as Sebastian continues, “We were at Uni together. Had this trick he used to do. He could take one look at you and know whom you had slept with and what you had for breakfast.” Sherlock, eyes still downcast, quietly murmurs, “ It’s not a trick.” Sebastian carries on as if Sherlock never spoke: “We all thought he was threadless back then… Oh, you poor bloke. I fear what you must go through every day!”
The sleuth suddenly looks up from his laptop and loudly declares that he needs his cellphone. When Sherlock doesn't move to get it himself John takes the hint and stands to retrieve Sherlock's phone, which lay right in front of him, but not before muttering something along the lines of, "Lazy sod," and a few insults that were said mostly said in adoration and good humor. When the detective and phone are reunited, long violinist fingers scroll through his contacts before clicking on one and a message is sent.
members of Scotland Yard were partaking in such deplorable behavior? If you two were actually doing your jobs instead of—how did you put it—getting off at crime scenes, you wouldn’t need Sherlock’s help.” When the adulterous pair only sat in stunned silence, John turns to the amateur detective, sweetly smiles, and says, “Come on, love. I’m hungry. Is Chinese alright with you?”
As John once again reaches out to comfort the detective, he briefly makes contact with Sherlock's signature Belstaff coat until the ebony haired man wrenches himself out of John's grasp, and the detective's long legs propel him out the bedroom door and down the stairs at a pace faster than John can keep up with. The guilt he is now feeling nearly sends him toppling to the floor, but he catches his footing at the last moment. John races to the opened window and watches as Sherlock disappears around the corner and out of sight.
Notes: Mystrade because my friend likes the pairing and Mycroft needed a soul mate. I'm going to have to change the update day to "whenever I can" because my computer crashed and everything (EVERYTHING for Red) was deleted. I'm slowly getting everything back but it's taking a while. It usually takes me 3-4 days to write but now it is taking me longer due to the fact that I have to borrow someone else's computer. Fortunately (unfortunately?) There are only about two more chapters left and then Red will be over! If you all will stick with me, I have a series taking hold in my mind and it's begging to be written.
Years had gone by and he is now eighteen. He has still not found his love, so he decides to become a soldier in order to pay for university and the obvious other reasons (God, Queen and Country). He has his things packed and says a goodbye to his crying mother and proud father. Harry is out somewhere, most likely sloshed, at a party or a pub, so a ‘touching goodbye’ would have to wait. He gathers his things and walks into the airport terminal, looks back on more time, takes everything in for a moment or two, turns, and then proceeds to board his plane.
As the evening closes, Sherlock seems to become even more restless than before. John’s concern only grows when the detective stutters out a reply when asked of his well being. When Sherlock nearly drops his fork for the fifth time, the concerned blogger demands to know what was going on. Sherlock’s shoulders slump slightly and his bottom lip protrudes into a small pout. When their eyes meet, the agitated sleuth sighs and goes to stand in front of his soulmate. He gently takes John’s hand in his own and traces the knuckles in his grasp.
John’s shoulders lose some of their tension as he asks, “Alright, so what are we doing instead? Quiet night at home?” The older man would never admit it out loud, but the thought isn’t so unappealing. The Consulting Detective quickly dashes those thoughts as he goes over to the couch, draws his knees up so that he is propped against the corner, gazes steadily at the ceiling, and petulantly whines, “Not quite. My mother has invited us to Christmas dinner this afternoon.”
The morning dawns quickly and four men get ready for this important day. When each man has put on their special suits, Mycroft and Sherlock head down to Baker Street to pick up their separate threadmates. When the wedded pair sees the other, two sets of gasps can be heard.
The now agitated amateur detective sits beside his mate once more to envelope him in a possessive cuddle. Mycroft smirks at Sherlock’s futile efforts before declaring, “It’s tradition, Sherlock. The Holmes family has practiced this particular tradition for over 100 years. You can’t break it now.”
In 1935, W. L. Hopper rethought the original idea and created a safer device that focused on one particular emotion at a time to efficiently extract the feeling. Instead of throwing away all of the discarded and unwanted emotions, people with mental illness demanded access to the positive feelings. In 1939, Pathogens Incorporated bought out the production of the bottled emotions and by 1945, injectable and artificial emotions were finally approved by the government and could be purchased by the general public. The people, who willingly gave away their emotions, quickly demanded payment for their service, and for a while, this was a wonderful system. Suicide rates plummeted for those with defective, mental illnesses, the economy was enriched with this new business, the monetary value of money rose dramatically, and those who did not want their emotions would not feel anything after each extraction. Bottling emotions were a great success.
Sherlock’s face morphs throughout John’s speech from the utter heartbreak over John’s obvious distress at having him gone, to utter confusion. He looks at John and the older man’s heart breaks when he notices that this once self-assured man could look so lost. Taking pity on the childlike man, John gently squeezes the digits wrapped tightly within his own before a warm smile spreads across his face as he gently states, “I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock. I plan to stay here with you for as long as you’ll have me.”
As soon as the bullet makes contact, Alarm bells sound inside his mind as Mary slips away unnoticed. He only has a few chances at survival, but even if he executes these strategies perfectly, he will still probably die. Murdered by the woman he promised to protect in order to keep John happy. None of that matters now, does it? As he falls on his back he quickly recognizes the first signs of shock and he begins to desperately search his Mind Palace for anything to calm himself down. ‘I’m being put down, too,’ Sherlock thinks as Redbeard ambles toward him gleefully. He continues onward, but Jim Moriarty is the next to visit him. Softly Moriarty begins to chant of Sherlock’s inevitable death. It wasn’t until his next words that Sherlock begins trying to desperately claw his way back to life, “John will cry buckets and buckets. It’s him that I worry about the most. That
"I love you-" he had to pause midway to kiss for emphasis "-quite a lot". He felt John smile rather than saw it,  tasted his pleasure like it was tangible on his lips and shivered in anticipation as he was spun around to lean with his back against the pool wall while John loomed between his thighs.
As it turned out Sherlock wanted only two things: Baker street, and John at his side. So John, ever the faithful companion, whirled about the cottage preparing various bits and pieces for the journey and for thei- his, return. Sherlock whirled about too, pulling on his customary suit and disappearing for a devasatating ten minutes only to return with a beautiful wooden chest in hand. He placed that gingerly in the centre of the kitchen table and then stood by the door, waiting for John to catch up.
The first phone call they had shared was the second most heart wrenching call of John’s life. Having to talk Sholto down was difficult, mostly because John didn’t know what it was that he would find grounding, but he was fairly certain that talking about the war wasn’t a good place to start, and the fact that the only other time they had seen each other was at the wedding… it didn’t leave many options. So, finally, John had spoken softly about some of the happiest memories he could think of; about their time, brief though it was, together. About long nights spent awake in each other’s arms, and gentle hands on tanned skin, and secretive looks across tents. Until his breathing was something approaching normal and James had laughed shakily “Those trousers can’t have been regulation John, I still don’t believe they were” over the line.
Sherlock cleared his throat. " I know traditionally the best man or maid of honour would speak, however seeing as technically this wedding is a testament to the fact that I am literally John's best man I think an exception is made. When John told me for the first time that he had feelings for me I wanted to tell him just how much it meant that he was willing to go on this new adventure with me, how shocked I was that anyone, especially someone as utterly good as him could feel this way towards me, and that I would try my very best to be everything he deserved. I wanted to, but we went to sleep instead. I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all round obnoxious asshole anyone could ever have the misfortune to meet. I am dismissive of the virtuous, unaware of the beautiful and uncomprehending in the face of the happy. So if I didn't understand why John would agree to a relationship with me, it was because I never expected to be anyone's friend, let alone their lover, seriously it was incredibly unlikely." There was a chuckle at that and Sherlock smiled softly down at John. "Certainly not of the bravest, and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune to know." John reached up and squeezed his hand while the guests smiled. "John I am a ridiculous man, redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your love and friendship. I cannot honestly say that I deserve this man, but I vow to you John in front of all our family and friends, one last thing: From now on I will strive to be deserving of you, and I will always be there for you no matter what. You have proved your strength time and again, through war and injury and tragic loss, and it is that strength that you will have to call on often through out our life together. You are seated" a quick glance down at Mary "with the two people who will love you most in all this world, and I think I can speak for both of us when I say we will never let you down, and we have a life time ahead to prove that." The guests were teary eyed, Sherlock could see Molly dabbing at her eyes and Edgar smiling proudly up at him, and he felt John's lips graze the back of his hand. " As Lestrade mentioned there's a lot to be said about John and myself. Before any of this, John's primary function in my life was to be a flatmate, a companion, an assistant for my work. There are many cases I could describe for you here, many have been described already on the blog John started the day we met. One case in particular springs to mind, A request from a member of the guard at Buckingham palace to help him with a stalker problem he'd been having..." Sherlock continued on about the case of the mayfly man, how they couldn't find the man who'd called them until they saw the pool of his blood on the shower floor, no weapon, no killer, just a man lying dead on the floor, until John realised he was alive and shot into action, keeping the man alive. "I will solve the case, but John will save your life." A small girl's voice chimed in "But who was the bad guy?" "Yeah and what did those ladies have to do with it?" Sherlock sighed and ran a hand through his hair.
"I don't know about you, but I'm in it for the sex." John winked at him and Greg nodded along playfully even as the hurried to catch up to the others.
"Overwhelming in what way, You said they were almost the complete opposite of the Holmes' but you never really spent time with them because they can't be around the other side of the family?" Sherlock sighed. "John by the end of the day we'll probably have two poems, four songs, a play and at least three characters in a novel based off of our relationship, and that's ignoring interpretive dance and spirit kind of overwhelming. I envy the fact that you don't have to deal with this sort of circus of a family. That is to say they weren't quite as eccentric as mine, not that I wish my relations to be dead, or that I envy the fact that yours are. To clarify, I am irritable and they are... 'free spirits' as Mummy would have me say." John frowned to himself, that was a lot of art and 'free spirits'? Sounded very Woodstock. Still, he'd dealt with Holmes', he could deal with this. "In case you've forgotten I spent a week with the obnoxious side of the family, if all I get this weekend is epic poems written about our wedding I think I'll be alright don't you?"
A/N Hello dolls I'm back! Writers block is a bit of a bitch guys, seriously not fun at all, so if this is terrible I apologise but it's all my brain would spew out so deal with it! French names, Idek... I assume that mother-in-laws ask about weddings and grandkids because ya know, that's the type of thing they care about? That's a conversation they needed to have anyway so yerps... There may be some French conversation next chapter so be warned that might happen and yeah that's pretty much it, thanks for reading, reviewing, follows and favourites! ~S
“I realised I’d left something important behind.” He had, God he had. The most important thing in his life.
"It was when I was pointing my gun at that cabbie's head that I realised exactly how I felt about you, my heart was pounding so hard, I thought you were going to eat that tablet. Hell you probably were, but when I thought you were in danger, the you were going to die I couldn't help but realise it. That I loved you. Even now when I don't know if you feel the same I can't deny that there's something about you that makes my entire being quiver with anticipation and lust and terror at how you can do that to me without even trying just because you're you. God you have no idea! Sherlock... If I were to ask you something, you'd tell me the truth right?" Sherlock frowned "Of courth I would John" Damn his lisp.
him because they were kissing at midnight if he had to kill someone. (Well maybe not that far but, the sentiment was there.)
That had been back in August, and since then Greg had even met Mary a few times, but not so often that, when her name popped up on his phone, he wasn't alarmed.
Taking that as a sign that anything to do with family may be an unwelcome discussion, John nodded and said nothing more. As Sherlock turned to hand the phone back to John, the scattered moonlight streaming through the window provided enough illumination for John to catch sight of Sherlock's left elbow.
The mass exodus from the plane began in earnest and Sherlock stayed seated with John in silence. What was there to say? They had to get up eventually and as the last to disembark the runway was essentially deserted when they stood there, luggage at their feet, staring at each other for what could have been an age. In the end it was Sherlock who held out his hand for a goodbye handshake and he was suitably surprised when John took his hand and held, frowning at the ground and clearing his throat gruffly.
politics, tactics, war, peace. You name it and he knows how to play it to his advantage. He convinced everyone that he didn't want anything more than to run the country behind the curtains. I wasn't so easily fooled. A man who puts 24 hour surveillance on his brother cannot convince me that he cares for nothing, that he has no heart. For some reason he had it in his head that he didn't deserve love like other people did, that he wasn't worth it because he was too fat and secretive and emotionless. When he first met Greg... No one but me and perhaps Sherlock, had he been conscious, would have noticed the slight flush that crossed his cheeks when Greg wrapped his arms around him at Sherlock's bedside. The inspector was just offering comfort to a man who was probably about to lose his baby brother, but how often do people hug Mycroft Holmes? Then when Greg asked for his number God I thought he'd have a heart attack! But it took years for him to admit that he liked Greg, they were friends by that time and suddenly Greg's marriage was breaking down and the CIA needed help tracking BinLaden down for good... So he got to run away for a while, telling himself and by extension me that he shouldn't have gotten his hopes up because no one would want him, especially not Greg. It was... Painful to see him so full of loathing for himself. When we got back after a good three months Greg called over to his London apartment to welcome him home and as he was leaving he just spun on his heel and goes "Mycroft you don't have some secret American version of you that you're married to now and just had a honeymoon with or something do you?" and Mycroft splutters and blushes and shakes his head and he says "The last man I had in my life was a long time ago Gregory, I had to have been thirty years younger then, although why that concerns you I don't understand." so you can imagine the look on his face when that pours out of his mouth, eyes wide and all that. Greg just smiles cheerily and moves to go, he just about turns the latch when he turns around saying "That's good. Uh... Screw it! Mycroft I've been dancing around this for a good seven years now and it's time you knew that I like you and if you would want to, I'd like to take you on a date." and when Mycroft asked him why, genuinely shocked, Greg said "Well for one you're probably the most handsome bloke I've ever met, you're smart and witty and more sarcastic than even your brother, I don't know. There's just something about you that I want Mycroft, and I think that something is just... You."Greg kind of proved that Mycroft was good enough to deserve love and kindness to him and I'm forever grateful." Again Lily was solemn when she looked to Molly for her answer.
"You know, I almost didn't believe him. But then I thought again. It's 're scared. Scared of what this case means, sure yes that too, but really scared of him. Of what you'll do if he leaves, what you'll do if he stays. Scared of loving him. You do. I know it, and if I know you have to know. You need him more now than you've ever needed anyone other than yourself and that is scary . Now, I know you have a blind spot for this sort of thing, But he's right there waiting for you with his bloody heart at your feet and you keep stomping all over it! He's my friend too, and I want to see him happy. You could make him happy Sherlock. You could." Sherlock turned away from him. "I don't know how." He murmured softly. Greg breathed a laugh. "No one really does. The secret to it is trying. All you have to do is try to do the best job you can making the other person happy, even if that means leaving them alone." That was what he'd done with Mycroft. Purely professional relationships were fine, but what Greg was looking for? Never.
“Or trauma to the head.” Papa says and Rosie just ignores it, Papa says weird things a lot and Daddy says it’s better to just let him talk sometimes. Daddy knows Papa very well, because they met long ago and Daddy likes Papa very much.
“I’ll be there when you do,” John whispers, his fingers tracing along the line of Sherlock’s jaw, feeling the freshly shaved skin. He knows Sherlock knows what he has been thinking. Sherlock met him when he was at his lowest, and he must have seen from the moment he entered this hospital room that John was worse, now, both physically and mentally.Surely Sherlock had seen in him that he had given up.
“I should start another list. ‘What our cats are saying without words’. That one was definitely a ‘feed me, now.’” John grins and follows him. By the time he had the tin with cat food open, two more hungry mouths were waiting. John gets a few head bumps against his shins, scratches a few ears, then decides to use the loo while the kittens feast.
Yes, there were accidents including pee, and Mykie can get very loud when he wants food- which is always- but John would’ve thought that having cats would be way more difficult and chaotic. Maybe it’s just that he is used to a high level of chaos ever since he started living with the world’s only consulting detective.
Do normal people ever feel like this? Do they seek intellectual input to a point of madness, or can they just take a break and not think without the help of certain substances? They must. How else would they survive two weeks on the beach every year, shopping sprees and bank holidays? In moments like that I envy them for their little brains, happy to be filled with crap telly and nonsense books.
“You need it.” Is all the answer I get, and he is back on his feet a moment later, reaching his hand out for me. I stop arguing against my own interest and heave myself up.
“Yep. To keep your mind occupied a bit. You can read it today, or the next time you feel like this, and I'm not there for some reason.” He turns to me as far as the busy pathway allows it, cheeks pink with the cold. “ You know, you can always call me.”
“Well,” Papa turns his head a bit to look at Kathy, whom Rosie has almost forgotten about. “Adults like their paperwork. They like things to be official.” Papa sometimes talks about himself, as if he is not a grown-up. Rosie likes that.
They booked a hotel that night and rented a car for when they were in Edinburgh. They took the train a week later as it was the most comfortable way to travel with Rosie. She could move around and they could read and play games instead of having to deal with her dislike for car rides.
The man turns a bit, pointing towards the opposite corner. Slowly, he makes his way across the room, Sherlock not taking his eyes off him for a moment as he sets up his meager excuse for a bed.
His knees felt like jelly, but Sherlock wouldn’t give destiny the satisfaction of dropping to the floor. His hand curled around the edge of the kitchen table so he could hold himself up.
