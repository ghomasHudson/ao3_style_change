The clicking of heels marks the woman’s departure. The door swishes shut behind her. The various monitors ding and beep.
-- ” on the edge of incoherence, Sherlock rolls his head from side to side, his breathing shallow and uneven. “I need to. John. Please. I
“Of course,” Sherlock says dryly. “The whole encounter was closely monitored from the very start. I may be reckless with my own life, but I do try to be not quite so cavalier with yours.”
Sherlock grits his teeth, tries to ignore his parched throat, but gives in after less than ten seconds, extracting an arm from the tangled bedding and stretching it out towards his brother. Mycroft places a cold bottle of water in his outstretched hand, and Sherlock sits up and drinks, trying not to look too pathetically grateful for the hydration.
Sherlock doesn’t collapse, or shake, or seize. He pulls the book off the shelf before turning to face Johnson, who stands there looking rather poleaxed at his failed gambit.
John takes a shuddering breath, goes rigid above him. “Oh,” he says softly, sounding almost surprised, and then he’s coming, his cock untouched, each wave a delicious rippling pulse around Sherlock as he spurts forcefully, warm and wet across Sherlock’s chest and belly, a splash of semen landing on the curve of Sherlock’s neck and he’s still coming, abdominal muscles contracting as he gasps and shudders like a drowning man. Sherlock fucks him through it, bending his knees for leverage as he manhandles John’s smaller frame, all passivity abandoned as he pounds into his lover’s open, willing, welcoming body, the pleasure so tightly wound around his spine the tension of it verges on unbearable.
“Why now, after all this time?” John’s brow creases with the questions swirling around his brain. “It’s been three years. Why did he not emerge sooner after Moriarty--the old Moriarty, I mean--died?”
John gets the hint, and with Sherlock’s assistance pulls his jumper and vest up and over his head in one only-slightly-awkward motion. Sherlock runs his hands over John’s torso, over the tangled scars of his shoulder, over his well-muscled biceps.
John’s face is impassive, but he can’t help but glance out the corner of his eye at Sherlock’s profile, the clean line of his jaw, the length of his neck now wrapped in a soft blue scarf. He’s almost overwhelmed by the momentary impulse to pull that fabric away and taste the pale warm skin hidden underneath.
“Then I came back here, and I saw all this shit from a life I never wanted, and Jesus. I’m so tired of being alone, and I miss you so much, all the time I miss you. I miss you so much that I cope by pretending you’re here, and how fucked up is that? I’ve been talking to an imaginary you just to get by because I’m not right unless I’m with you and I don’t even remember why I’m here by myself and it just felt like...fuck, it’s just all too much, I can’t do this anymore. I’m so lonely and I’m so angry, Sherlock, and I’m so tired of feeling like this, I don’t want to feel like this anymore and
“Not tonight, though,” John says, then gives another, slightly smaller yawn. “Honestly, I think we’re both far too tired to give an undertaking like that the full attention it deserves.”
The room is higher quality than their previous arrangements. It is actually more of a quasi-suite; the first half of the room is set up as a living area, with a sofa and small dinette set. A kitchenette alcove to the right contains a small under-counter refrigerator, sink, and two-burner stovetop. Past the kitchenette, a dividing wall runs three quarters of the width of the room; beyond are two queen beds and the ensuite bathroom.
“You need to stay hydrated,” Sherlock says. The mattress is so thick and dense, it barely even dips when Sherlock stands. “I’ll get you water before I go.”
The very few times John has attempted even the most minor contact, a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder or a brushing of fingers against his hand, Sherlock freezes, going still and watchful, his pulse jumping visibly along the pale column of his throat.
Sherlock had never mocked, never belittled. Of course he hadn’t. He is aware that he is himself a odd, difficult, perplexing man, and it would be hypocritical and unseemly for a person like himself to mock the odd or unusual inclinations and behaviours of others. But still, he had found himself confused (and he realises, in the clarity of hindsight, more than a little fascinated) by the kinds of needs, the kinds of urges that would drive people to act out these deliberate, elaborate, ritualized sexual scenes. What would possibly drive a person do such strange and awkward things, in the pursuit of erotic satisfaction?
For a time they watch the swans and ducks gliding across the water. Sherlock wraps his coat around himself, hands sunk deep into his pockets as he gazes silently across the water.
John scrubs at his eyes with balled fists like a child, then drops his hands to his lap. “Sherlock,” he says, quietly. “Listen. I have to ask. Did something happen that you’re not telling me?”
Sherlock just nods, but looks away instead of laughing. He’s clearly feeling self-conscious, so John changes the subject.
The two men are comfortable together, not needing to talk much as they eat, and John is shocked by how quickly they fall back into their groove of togetherness.
,” Sherlock sighs. “Your arrival in my life changed my mind on a good many topics. In many confusing, frustrating, eye-opening ways.”
“Thank you,” Evelyn replies. And in return, rest assured I will do all I can to assist you. Just, please, keep yourselves on the right side of the law. Which means…” She reaches once more into her bag and pulls out two battered red passports. “You get to be yourselves again. The fake ones have already been incinerated, because they’re just slightly incredibly illegal.”
the mother of my child. I will do whatever I have to do to get my daughter back from that woman. I promise you that.
Sherlock doesn’t back down, but his shoulders sag just a barest touch as he exhales. “Perhaps I don’t,” he replies, his tone softening a fraction.
. It’s the difference between being terrified of the unseen terrors of the dark, and knowing exactly what monsters lurk in the inky depths, the dimensions of their teeth and claws and how best to kill them in a fight.
“And, of course, I didn’t want to disappoint you even further, didn’t want to burden you with dealing with a drugs lapse on top of everything else.”
Nothing else on the chalkboard looks useful to John’s eye. He sees CVS receipts, an appointment card for Lehigh Valley Pediatrics, a magnet proclaiming “Librarians: the original search engine.”
There seems to be a moment of nonverbal conversation between the two before the young woman ducks her head and moves away silently to the storage area. The pharmacist places his hands on the counter, leans his weight forward. His gaze is direct.
John could accept the ill-treatment. He absolutely didn’t like it; they had, for the most part, moved on to a point where unintentional rudeness was tolerated (Sherlock was, after all, Sherlock), but outright nastiness was no longer part of landscape. But John felt keenly how badly Sherlock was hurting, so he accepted it, let it wash over him.
“It’s not too bad right now,” John replies. “The local still hasn’t worn off completely. It’s going to hurt a hell of a lot more tonight.”
“That actually sounds lovely,” he says, and is shocked by the fact that he means it. “I’ll ask John about it.”
The phone rings again, the standard boring stock ringtone the phone came with, and the simple chime has never sounded sinister or full of terrifying portent until now.
Sherlock’s hands stroke across the muscles of John’s arms and back as he works his way up Sherlock’s torso, pressing kisses into his skin as he works the buttons open one by one. When all the buttons are undone John pushes the cloth aside to taste a flat, dark pink nipple, pulling it into his mouth and sucking hard. Sherlock gives a sharp cry as John lavishes attention on the hard, peaked nub of flesh, each swipe of his tongue sending sparks of pleasure singing through his nerves.
Sherlock is, of course, the quickest study that ever lived and he’s getting the hang of this now, giving back as good as he gets, and John's tender affection is shifting into something much stronger, much darker, something hot and needy and primal beginning to build as he kisses Sherlock, weaving his fingers in dark curls to pull him closer, their kisses growing more frantic as their mouths and tongues meet and press and slide and work insistently against each other.
It's late morning, bright sunlight filtering under the blackout curtains. His body is leaden and aching, his mind fuzzy with the confusion of the time change, the internal and external clocks still at war with one another.
“No,” Sherlock murmurs, voice deep and rough as gravel. “What I want is you. Now.” His pale eyes lock with John’s just for a moment, and there’s hunger there, but also fear and a little sorrow and John feels it too, the unfairness of it all, the spectre of loss a shadow  over the two of them yet again.
And the scar. The scar just to the right side of the midline, where Mary’s bullet came within a hairsbreadth of ending his life. It is still a bit reddish but paler, well-healed and beginning to fade.
“No, but I know Maria,” he says. “She’s brought nothing but trouble to me and mine. If you’re of a mind to stop her, good on ya, I’d say.”
“Okay, the occasional prawn. Whatever. The point is, it makes a difference. Also hydration. Smoking doesn’t help either.”
, so intimately familiar with Sherlock's body that he knows exactly where and how to touch him. His finger just barely brushes the edge of Sherlock's prostate, lighting sparks of pleasure deep in his pelvis. “Yours. All yours. Please, just-”
John can’t help but think of Sherlock in that moment, and he can’t help but laugh at the hopeless irony of it all, despite the beating. “Oh, I agree,” he gasps. His body sags, his vision going dark at the edges.
The large glass doors slide open at their approach. Beyond them is another cloudy afternoon in southern New Jersey. It smells like car exhaust and rain.
A vision rises, unbidden. Sherlock in the back of that ambulance, pale as death itself, blood welling from a dark round hole in his chest as his vitals crashed and John trembled with sick cold fear, absolutely certain he was going to watch his
to be easier to live with, to be less difficult and demanding and unkind, and in that narrow way of looking at it, John supposes that yes, things are better.
Emboldened by the moment and the darkness, John reaches out, brushes Sherlock’s wrist with the backs of his fingers. His skin is warm and dry, the hairs sparse and silky soft.
He’s about to pull away and begin putting dry goods in the cupboards,when Sherlock’s left hand comes up and long fingers encircle his wrist, holding him gently but firmly.
“You taste amazing,” John purrs, then places a hand on each of his inner thighs and spreads his legs even wider, opening him up completely for his insistent tongue.
. He tries to open his eyes or move his arms, but he’s not yet capable, not really fully awake or in control of his body, and all he can manage in the end is a flicker of his eyelids and a tiny twitch of his left hand.
The trip takes a little less than two hours, and the time passes remarkably quickly, office buildings and warehouses gradually giving way to farm fields, dotted with billboards advertising skiing in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania Dutch cooking, some tourist spot called Crystal Cave. The miles roll under the wheels of the SUV, the rhythm of it a soothing staccato that counterpoints the classical music, lulling John into a state of relaxed near-hypnosis hovering on but not tipping over the edge into sleep.
John closes his eyes again. The image of Sherlock receiving his come like a blessing, like a benediction--it is seared forever into the deepest, darkest part of his brain.
“One time for a case, Mycroft granted me access to some very interesting...files. Containing evidence of some truly astonishing events. Those files, John. They changed me.”
sorry for not being completely forthcoming, but I will never apologize for trying  to keep you safe.”
“No!” Sherlock looks stricken, then reconsiders. “Well, yes, I guess that’s it, actually. More or less.”
“I know, but…” John stops, pauses in consideration. “Okay, I admit that when we started this, I didn’t know where we would end up. But I like where we are. What we have is good. It’s brilliant. It works for us. I don’t want to risk that. Also, what about…” he runs a hand over Sherlock’s back, over the pale scars that have faded but will never entirely disappear. The intent behind the gesture is clear.
"Brilliant," Sherlock sighs, and the hushed awe in his tone compels John to kiss him again, tracing his lower lip with just the lightest swipes of his tongue. Sherlock follows his lead, opening his mouth just slightly (still a bit self-conscious over his earlier gape mouthed mauling, John supposes), tentatively meeting John’s exploratory tongue with his own, allowing John to dip into his mouth and taste him, toothpaste and pad thai and Orangina and just the barest hint of cigarette and he tastes gorgeous, amazing, intoxicating.
In one of his more forward-thinking moments, John turns his mobile to silent before shoving it back into his pocket and scanning the perimeter of the room.
“Sherlock!” Lestrade’s voice carried sharply through the dusty, gloomy air. “I came out here on your say-so, it better be good. Let the EMTs look at John and come tell me what the hell’s going on.”
Sherlock answers with a halfhearted glower, but fetches his phone from the desk before exiting the room and shutting the door halfway behind himself.
The only question for John to answer, now, is what’s to become of the child still living in the belly of his estranged wife-in-name-only.
, it’s fireworks and shooting stars and for a second John almost can’t breathe for the intensity of the sensation.
He sweeps out of the room in his usual manner. John and Patricia follow in his wake. Patricia carefully closes the office door behind herself, all the while staring daggers at Sherlock’s back and not bothering to hide it.
John sighs and brings his hand up to rest on Sherlock’s shoulder. He can feel John considering the different paths to take, as his fingers trace patterns in the silk covering Sherlock’s shoulder.
A strong hand hooks under his right arm, pulls him off the now bloodied and barely conscious man on the ground and hauls him to his feet.
“We’ll just do it the old fashioned way, then.” John leans back a bit, right hand still gripping the back of the chair for stability, and licks the palm of his left hand, wetting it thoroughly. Pushing stray tendrils of self consciousness aside, John wraps his spit-slicked hand around his very hot, very hard cock, gives it a first, tentative pull.
“That’s exactly the point, and you’re not getting it.” With a little grunt of effort, Sherlock turns onto his side to face John. “You rely so heavily on the framework of safewords and structured, formalized communication. I appreciate your thoroughness, I do. But you know me so much better than that. You knew I was fine, and if I hadn’t been fine, you would have known that too.” Sherlock tilts his head, his expression even and calm. “Like last time, when I started to panic. You saw that before I ever said a word, didn’t you.”
Instead, John kisses him back, pushes his shoulders down onto the bed. These are no longer the desperate fumblings of late nights and flayed nerves but instead something slower, sweeter, more deliberate. He straddles Sherlock’s slim hips, presses a line of kisses down his long neck, moving down his bare torso, exploring him with lips and tongue. His mouth finds a perfect, hard pink nipple, closes around it, sucking and nibbling gently as Sherlock shudders underneath him, tiny choked whimpers caught in his throat.
He turns to find Sherlock less than ten yards away, the gun in his gloved hand perfectly steady despite the shock and fear in his wide pale eyes. His ragged breathing plumes frosty white in the chill night air.
John has to admit, Lestrade knows just how to deal with Sherlock in high dudgeon; his calm acknowledgement of responsibility effectively negates his burgeoning anger, visibly takes the wind out of his sails. Sherlock breathes in deeply, exhales, the tension in his shoulders unwinding just a fraction. He inclines his head, just the merest suggestion of a nod.
In this shifted headspace, the memory of his earlier poor behaviour stings Sherlock deeply, makes him feel ungrateful and ashamed. He drops his head.
“I have to, you know I have to,” John breathes into his skin as he releases the tiny metal jaws. Sherlock screams.
Sherlock looks up at John, his lips pursed together in a moue of disdain as he waves a dismissive hand.
“Pedantic git,” John murmurs good-naturedly. “Okay, I just wondered if...   when you were in school. Did they, um, employ corporal punishment?”
John turns away from the spectacle, mouth twitching downward in distaste, then glances up at Sherlock with a slightly furrowed brow. “How did you -- ” he begins, then shakes his head. “You know what? Never mind. Just tell me what we’re doing here.”
Sherlock’s body grows still; his messy curly head drops, resting against John’s chest. “We’re wasting valuable time,” he sighs, his raspy, sensual voice flattened by the intrusion of harsh reality.
“Don’t you fucking dare,” John says without looking up. He’s already figured most of it out, though. It’s actually not a very good novel. He pretends to read for a few more minutes, just out of a lack of much else to do.
“It’s identical to every other note,” he remarks, beginning as he always does by stating the painfully obvious. “Written on lightweight tracing paper, similar to but different from the pattern paper used by the tailor. The ink is blue biro, cheap, the kind of pen found in a million different places, so exceedingly difficult to trace. Exact same message on each. Problem is, the message is absolute gibberish.”
in front of Mycroft) and steeples his fingers under his lips, trying to force the headache out of his brain through sheer force of will, trying to
Sherlock kisses his shoulder one more time before settling his head on his pillow, eyelids frankly drooping. “It is indeed. Get some rest, please.”
The trip upstairs is slower than either man would like, Sherlock occasionally bends double, the muscles of his back contracting in violent shivers.
Figueroa straightens his spine, adjusts his cuffs and smooths the lapels of his fifty-dollar suit jacket. “And
“Yes,” Sherlock rasps, low and ragged, almost a moan, flexing his hips, pushing his now stiff and pulsing erection into the circle of John’s fist.
“How much does a white female newborn go for these days, anyway?” Sherlock asks. “Heaven knows teenagers aren’t finding themselves up the duff like they used to, thanks to video games, IUD’s, and dairy hormones. So I’m thinking high six figures? But you’re the specialist, Mister Johnson, so you tell me.”
He closes his eyes and listens to running water, to the elderly pipes groaning and creaking, to John’s sturdy baritone as he serenades the stained tile walls of the bathtub.
In age-old human instinct, he brushes the back of her tiny hand with his index finger. She reaches out and grabs hold, closing her fist around his finger with a shockingly strong grip.
“I find those truly repulsive, you know.” Sherlock says, crinkling his nose in the way that John can’t help but find endearing. “They’re simultaneously gritty and pasty and taste nothing at all like meat.”
In the course of Sherlock unspoolings his deduction, the civil, amiable, slightly amused expression on Martinez’s face has hardened into a slightly terrifying frozen rictus.
He’s answered instantly by a swift and stinging slap to his right cheekbone; his head snaps hard to the side with the force of impact, making him see stars under the darkness of the blindfold. His head is still ringing from the blow when John grabs his face, hard along his jaw, and kisses him, rough and demanding, tongue pushing insistently into his mouth before he draws back and slaps him again.
“No. God, no.” John dips his head, kisses him. “There’s been no one else since, there couldn’t be anyone else but you.” He pulls back a bit. “And um, you?”
“You could stay for dinner,” Sherlock says, surprising even himself. “There’s a newish place on Marylebone. Caribbean, not too fancy. I helped the owner out of a spot of trouble, he always gives us extra chapatis.”
“He could have gotten you out and he left you there for five days?” John exhales sharply. “Fuck him.
Sherlock is just tying John’s left laces when Sophie knocks and enters, a sheaf of paperwork in her hand. She looks upset and worried, and John’s fond spot for nurses along with the memory of her recent kindness combine to make him feel so, so much worse than he did about pissing off the attending.
“She took a bunch of my clothes and my credit card,” Jennifer replies. “Called me up out of nowhere, said she was back in town, needed a ride and a place to stay. We used to run in the same...social circles, you could say. Once upon a time.”
"I get that," John says. "I do. But we're here now, at the edge of the frying pan." He waves a hand at the direction of the innocuous-looking plant. "Go on, then. Open the card."
In the brief, terrifying moments when he forced himself to look into this abyss, Sherlock prayed desperately to a non-existent deity that he be the one to fall ill first. He would hate to leave him, make him face this alone, but he knows that John is much stronger than him, and if one of them could possibly survive this he knows it would be John.
“John,” Sherlock says, and his voice is calm, too calm, deathly calm in the way only a man fighting off panic with every fibre of his being can sound. “John.”
“As you can clearly see.” Evelyn smiles thinly, plucking the paperwork from his fingers and returning the sheet to its envelope before slipping it back into her bag. She pauses as if in thought, then pulls out her mobile. “Would you like to speak to him?” She presses a button, turns the screen so Figueroa can see. “He’s probably having his breakfast right this moment. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind an Atlantic City detective interrupting his coffee and toasted blueberry muffin.”
“I see.” Sherlock nods once, turns on his heel, and disappears into the shadows. A door at the far end of the room slides open, then closes with a soft click.
John considers, then nods. “All right, love.” He withdraws his fingers slowly, not able to resist gazing for a moment at the mesmerizing sight of Sherlock’s twitching, gaping hole, slick with saliva and lube, open and waiting for him.
He wakes late in the morning, feeling distinctly ill and unrested. Knowing more sleep is out of the question he rises, goes into the sitting room to find Sherlock unconscious, sprawled messily over the sofa, long pale bare feet dangling over the upholstered arm.
With trepidation, John eases open the door to the hallway. To their surprise, the passage is utterly empty.
“Turn it on NOW, Mycroft, so we can find your brother before he’s cut up and sold overseas for parts.”
A few minutes later, the mattress springs creak and dip as Sherlock joins him, the scent of cigarettes clinging to him as he spoons against John’s curled back. He presses a chaste, contrite kiss to the back of John’s neck, his breath warm against cool skin.
wants, not necessarily what Sherlock needs right now. So he stays still, resists his urges and keeps still, pretending to sleep.
Mycroft had also clearly seen how making his troubled and addiction-prone brother the sole heir of an enormous pile of money might be a frankly terrible idea. Splitting his estate between the two of them gave John a stake in making important decisions, without insulting or diminishing Sherlock in the process.
“Sherlock,” John murmurs, then licks at the crease with his tongue, the concentrated taste of him intoxicating, exploding in his brain. “Sweetheart. Can I -- ”
“John Watson.” John meets the man's imperious gaze with equanimity. “Holmes, is it,” John says, the question evident in his inflection.
“A Tesla?” John shakes his head in disbelief. “Good God, I thought I couldn’t hate this wanker any more.”
He does so love a touch of the dramatic. It’s a weakness, to be sure. But then again, it’s his only weakness.
“But,” John says, “I would--” he looks into Sherlock’s eyes, and a constellation of emotions Sherlock can’t even name play across his expressive, careworn features. “I would very much like to hug you.”
. “Oh, pet, I’m so sorry. I won’t leave you alone, I wasn’t thinking. I’m coming with you, the bathroom floor can wait.” He grabbed a couple of dry towels and took Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock’s large palm wrapped around his, docile and trusting as he let John take the lead.
“Why didn’t they kill you?” John asks him bluntly. His composure has finally cracked. His voice is thick and hoarse, and Sherlock knows he’s been crying.
Fortunately, he doesn’t have long to consider the question; Mycroft’s inscrutable omnipotence somehow also applies to London traffic, and a black car pulls up to the kerb in front of 221b less than two minutes later. John pulls on his jacket as he jogs down the steps.
“Listen to me. Don’t come here,” Sherlock is speaking quickly now, one word tumbling over another. “It’s a trap, John, don’t -- ”
“From one to ten? About a six, I suppose. I mean, I got shot and it hurts. But still, I’ve felt worse in my life.”
“Come here.” John pulls him up hard by his hair, hauling him into his lap. Sherlock struggles awkwardly to comply, knees aching, half-asleep lower legs a shower of pins and needles. John brusquely arranges the long length of his body across his knees, legs resting on the bed on John’s left side, his elbows and forearms to the right, arse over his lap.
“I am,” murmurs Sherlock, as his fingertips slide over the small of John’s back, explore the swell of his arse.
“I want to sit on your cock,” Sherlock tells him. “I want to fuck myself on your cock and then I’m gonna come all over your chest.”
. I understand you’re under a great deal of emotional stress, but if you continue to harass and obstruct me and the other members Doctor Watson’s caregiving team, you’ll leave me with no choice but to remove you from this room.”
John’s real reason for wanting to watch a movie is completely relaxed against him, his weight surprisingly heavy and slack, his breathing deep and even.
Turning the corner onto West Smithfield, Sebastian wraps his too-large coat a bit tighter around himself, a poor defence against the creeping endless damp.
(He also discovers, incidentally, that it’s not Tuesday but rather Wednesday. John goes over the past two weeks as he remembers it, can’t find the snag in his personal timeline, decides to let it go. It’s not the first 24 hours of his life he’s lost completely, and more than likely not the last.)
His hands are folded across his belly as he stares at the ceiling, resolutely gazing at nothing in particular. Mary’s voice registers, triggers an upswelling of something thick and black and ugly in his chest. Anger? Disappointment? Despair? He doesn’t even know anymore. All he knows is the black wave will swallow him whole if he allows himself to feel it, so he doesn’t. He just stares at the ceiling. Notes a spiderweb forming in the corner.
Sherlock does the same, then burrows back under the coverlet, arranging himself next to John, his larger body curling around him in a protective way that John finds he enjoys very much.
, oh God, as the unbearable need and tension builds and builds until his body finally blessedly explodes in sensation, a blinding spasm of pleasure seizing every muscle as he comes and comes, a rush of heat as he spills hot and wet into John’s still-shaking body.
What looked on the outside to be a fairly bog-standard rectangular postwar bungalow has a recently and extensively remodeled interior, done in the understated yet expensive style John has always associated with British government employees working with generous expense accounts. The floors are grey-washed farmhouse pine, the walls parchment white, the kitchen countertop thick, silver-flecked granite. The far right hand wall of the living room is made up entirely of an oversized column of quarried grey and white stone, with a large glassed-in gas fireplace at the center.
“I acted as quickly as I could,” Mycroft continues, softer, a note of something close to pleading in his tone. “Please believe me, John, when I tell you I moved heaven and earth to bring him home. The Serbians knew Sherlock had value, believed he could be used a bargaining chip. But the British government doesn't bargain. Not with criminals. There was nothing I could do. No leverage. So instead, I...all I could do was make Sherlock’s presence at home enough of a necessity to justify going in undercover to retrieve him.”
John kisses him, presses their foreheads together; they stay like that for a moment, breathless from laughter, utterly wrapped up in each other.
With the mission complete, the nurse again helps John back across the room, but this time he changes their trajectory just slightly en route.
“I thought I had lost you,” Sherlock rasps, voice low and gravelly with emotional strain.. “I thought I would never... and I can’t...John.
(Later, John will attempt, many times and without success, to sort out the chain of events in his mind, to pinpoint who panicked and pulled the trigger in this tense moment. He will be almost entirely certain it was Nestor, the man whom he so cheerfully humiliated in front of his boss -- but no matter how many ways he reconstructs the scenario, he will never be entirely sure.)
The streetlights flickering past play across Sherlock’s face, sharpening his features, alternately bathing him in light and shadow.
Kitten heels tap up the steps, and John backs an arm’s length away as Mrs. Hudson appears in the kitchen doorway. “Yoo-hoo, Sherlock! I brought you some--” She goes completely still at the sight of John, her silence as sudden and sharp as turning off a radio.
Sherlock is quiet a moment, eyes going a bit unfocused as he considers the question. “The roots of the Moriarty organization are too deep, too entrenched to be destroyed easily. I crippled the network, but unfortunately I didn’t kill it. Mycroft pulled me out of Serbia before I could solve the final piece of the puzzle--”
“You like our owl?” the young, pale man asks, his deep honeyed baritone echoing in the cavernous room as he steps out of the shadow and into the golden afternoon light pouring through the wall of windows.
“This is real,” John whispers fiercely into his ear, then traces the delicate, blood-hot shell with his tongue, making him gasp softly. “This is us, and this is real. I swear it is. Do you believe me?”
It takes him several moments to understand what John is talking about. He feels like everything is moving at half speed, his limbs swimming against thick, invisible treacle.
“Very well, then. We will deal with the larger picture later. For the moment, let’s focus on what happened to Travis.”
The baby’s cries fill the space between them for a few minutes. John finds the dummy and returns it to her mouth, and she latches on, sucking with vigor.
“But even that can’t protect you, not from a truly enterprising rapist. I suppose Rajakovic was the type who didn’t find it much fun to sodomise an empty husk of a human being. A more energetic sort, you know. Enjoyed a challenge.” Sherlock’s lovely lips twist into a hideous caricature of a smile. “I’m sure a spot of bloody, disfiguring torture would have fit the bill, and he certainly hit me and kicked me and threatened me with death on a daily basis, but he never really went all in, never caused any lasting damage, and I figured out early on that he was under instructions from somewhere to keep me alive and more or less in one undamaged piece. The beatings needed to be kept relatively, well, light, nothing that really slaked his thirst for absolute power and domination over another human being.”
Mrs. Hudson, trying to fatten Sherlock back up,  invites them down to her flat for an American Thanksgiving dinner.
The pain unspools time into a thin, endless thread; it feels like the next minutes last an eternity as John carves precise, delicate lines into his living canvas of skin while Sherlock whimpers and weeps quietly beneath him.
John fights the near-overwhelming impulse to say yes. He is just in the middle of figuring this out, and having Sherlock so close and warm and real fogs everything up, spins him about, makes it so hard to think...
His former landlady’s smile returns to full blinding wattage. “Of course I’m certain! Don’t hover about like a stranger, come in, come in. We’ll have a bite and see if Himself turns up to join us.”
“Oh,” Sherlock says. “We’re talking about this. Did I ask to talk about this? Somehow I don’t recall.”
The woman’s expression shifts from friendly to openly excited. “I know you! I’ve read all your blogs, I watched the true crime special on the ID Network. I’m a huge fan!”
He is genuinely surprised when John instead glances up at the sitting room windows and says mildly, “If we need to go to the shops we’d better get a move on. It’s really starting to come down out there.”
John sighs, just a small barely audible huff of air, as Sherlock kisses and touches his way up his body. As Sherlock touches him reverently, inch by agonizing inch, John is reminded of anatomy classes, of the engraved plates labeling every bone, every muscle.
Sherlock nods wordlessly, turns his back to John and lets him massage the shampoo into his hair, combing out the snarls with his fingers. “Okay, rinse.” Sherlock tilts his head back, ducks under the shower head as John watches him, transfixed by the sight of his dark hair plastered and dripping, rivulets of water streaming over the faint scars on his well-muscled back. He straightens, turns back to John, pushing his wet hair back with two hands and smiling down at him.
“Sometimes,” Sherlock says, and then stops to consider as if uncertain what to say next. “Sometimes, when I was a child, when I couldn’t-- my brother.” He inhales, exhales the next words in a rush of air. “He would read to me.”
Several intensely pleasurable minutes pass before Sherlock breaks away, gasping just a bit for air. He gazes down at John, kiss-bitten lips reddened, pale silvered eyes sparkling with a lively, affectionate warmth.
Ten days have passed since he walked away from Sherlock Holmes, and John Watson is absolutely certain nothing will ever happen to him again.
“But it’s okay now,” John murmurs, running his hands up and down Sherlock’s biceps, peppering kisses across his jaw. “It’s done with, and it’s all okay now.”
“You have work of your own to do,” Sherlock demurs. “And I absolutely do not want to keep you from playing catch up.”
“What do you want?” he murmurs into Sherlock’s mouth between shuddering breaths and messy kisses. “Anything. Anything at all.”
He hates how much he’s hurting Sherlock, oh God he does, but every cell of his body is screaming in alarm now and he understands, instinctively, that he’s running out of time.
“So you’re looking for something a little different than NHS clinic work, I take it?” Mr Atherton asks.
John feels vertiginous at the sight of it all, the evidence of his daughter’s life with these strangers, and the dizzy feeling makes him sway just a little.
Sherlock just looks at him for a moment, then brings his head down and kisses the bare skin of John’s belly, licks and mouths at his flesh experimentally while John strokes his hair. It’s not quite sexy--John has the oddest feeling of being sampled, of Sherlock analyzing the data he’s acquiring through his lips and tongue--but it is sweet, and he can’t help but smile when Sherlock picks his head up and proclaims, “You taste good.”
Sherlock goes into the restaurant, returns with coffees and a box of doughnuts. He takes off his coat, tosses it into the back seat before slipping back behind the wheel, placing the box on top of the dashboard.
“Which is precisely why I’m so concerned. You’re mistaking formal education for sound judgment.” Sheldon’s voice softens just slightly as he tries a different tack. “We’re prone to that error, Doctor Watson. You know that. We’re clinicians, not superheroes and definitely not immortal.”
Sherlock has a brief, hazy impression of smugness and and expensive cologne, but he doesn’t bother to regain consciousness for his brother’s lecture on his reckless behaviour. It’s not something he hasn’t heard a hundred times before.
He cleaned his slicked hand one of the discarded towels and stood up, circled round to the foot of the bed. Sherlock still lay as John had positioned him, his head turned to the side, quiet and compliant, waiting to do as he was told.
A long moment passes as John tries to find the words to explain the hurt and confusion in his heart.
“I know, you incredibly literal-minded prat.” John kisses him. “I’m just saying yes, God, of course I want to. I  just want to make sure you’re sure. Also, there’s the minor detail of not having condoms.”
Despite his exhaustion, Sherlock gives John a look of bemused disbelief that makes him look more like himself than he has in days. “You can barely make it to the Asda half a mile from your house.”
After several long breathless moments Sherlock broke away, gulping for air, and rested his forehead against John’s. “I love you,” Sherlock said quietly, his voice trembling. “I love you more than anything else in this world.”
It’s locked, which sends a strange, sharp stab of pain through John’s heart. “Am I?” he asks, not even really loud enough for Sherlock to hear through the door. “Making you miserable?”
“John,” he cries out softly, barely more than whimper, and he sounds distressed, almost in pain. “John. I--”
Sherlock nods, huffs a tiny chuckle as he pulls John into him, walks them backwards, shuffling them clumsily to the unmade bed until the backs of his knees touch the mattress then tumbling both of them into it, landing gracelessly on his back as John ends up sprawled inelegantly on top of him. With a grunt John rights himself, throwing a leg over Sherlock’s hips, leveraging himself up onto his knees and elbows.
“Shh, pet,” John croons in his ear, bringing the rod up to his chest, holding it with two hands, sliding up his throat, using it to gently but firmly nudge up Sherlock’s chin. “Look. Look at yourself and tell me what you see.”
Eyes fixed on the digital payout display in front of him, John is silent for half a beat too long, then exhales, shakes his head.
His torso is long and lean, shoulders broad, the flat plains chest layered with just enough muscle to keep him on the right side of too thin. A stripe of pale white scar peeks over the curve of his right deltoid; John reaches up, tracing the line made by a cruel whip with a feather light touch of a thumb.  The sight triggers a brief silver stab of pain in John’s heart, blade-sharp sorrow at the thought of the similar sibling scars just out of sight, crisscrossing Sherlock’s muscular back, a silent testament to the horror he’s endured, both those John knows of -- and those as yet untold.
‘Hmmm,’ he responds, and I know that he is miles away, as usual, somewhere deep in the velvet shadows.
‘’Course they do.  I’m just saying kids run away for a reason, and if you ask me, it’s usually to get away from something.’  He slouches off to the photocopier.
Okay, yes, I am a doctor and it shouldn’t surprise me, but the idea of him as an even remotely sexual being bends my brain into backbreaking contortions.
His thighs slide up around my hips and grip.  My cock leaps in response.  I pull back, look down at him, survey the wonder of Sherlock aroused.  It is dazzling.  His pupils are so dilated that his eyes look entirely black.  A luscious, rosy bloom has spread across his chest.  The pulse in his neck throbs close to the surface.  There are pink patches on the crests of his cheekbones.  His mouth has a looseness about it, puffy from my kisses.  I kiss him again, hard, thrust my tongue into his mouth, love the vibration of the moan he emits.  Between my legs, I am throbbing.  Tingles are spreading out all across my belly and down my inner thighs.  My backside is alight with sensation, something I have never experienced before.  My head is spinning with need.  I grind against him, wanting.
‘What we have here, I think, is a young man who is extremely talented.  One day, Master Bennett, you will make one of this country’s best forensic psychologists, if I am not mistaken.’
‘Good point,’ I nod.  ‘But didn’t Doctor Johnson say: “when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.”’
Having arrived in Sussex, Sherlock and John set out to meet their clients, the parents of the missing boy.
She sighs.  ‘I told him not to leave without at least giving them some idea of a way to find him, a phone number or something, but he wouldn’t have it.  He said he wouldn’t have a chance of getting away if he didn’t keep it a secret. He seemed to think they’d send him off somewhere, a mission or something, if he told them.’
Suddenly he bobs up right in front of me, his belly brushing against mine, his cheeks beaded, his eyelashes spiked.  Water streams from his pointed chin.
The route to Amberley takes us around the north of the town, with an epic view back across the Arun river valley and out towards the High Downs, the same view as from Tipsy copse, where we found the altar and the book.  The sea glitters navy blue in the farthest distance.  We wend our way down the hill and park behind the little café by the bridge.  It is just as the woman in the Castle Magic shop described.
It is hot.  Baking, in fact.  I’ve yomped miles in worse heat, in Iraq for instance, but today I’m older and my knees aren’t up to it anymore.  Sex takes it out of your knees – an under acknowledged fact.  And right now, Sherlock has managed to fuck my knees up good and proper.  Not that I wouldn’t do the same again given the chance (and I sincerely hope I
She nods sympathetically.  ‘She’s such a funny woman.  They have such odd ideas, you know.  Peculiar.  But I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.  Losing a child.’
She sighed, obviously feeling she had put up enough of a fight to satisfy any karmic forces that she’d had no choice.
‘Oh, no, I wouldn’t be involved.  I told him it was cruel and wrong.  Against Coven rules.  Remember the Charge of the Goddess, I said.  “An it harm none”, Jonny.’  She looked extremely sad.  ‘He wouldn’t listen.  Next thing I knew, it was all over the evening news that he’d disappeared.’
The heavy tread of the DI’s oxfords on the risers, each step somehow conveying a sense of existential exhaustion even though it’s not yet noon--John knows the timbre of his tread promises a solid seven of a case, perhaps even an eight.
These are the profound thoughts swirling in John’s mind as he watches Sherlock undress. What comes out of his mouth is decidedly less eloquent.
“I want to devour you,” John growls against his lips. “I want to consume every piece of you. I want drink you, swallow you, make you a part of me, in my cells and my bones.”
“The baby,” John rasps, awash in terror, the fear and nausea rising, his dinner threatening to escape. “Sherlock.
in it. But he never cared a thing for it, so I did the caring for him, made sure the money kept flowing in. But in the end all his enterprises, all his skill and brains, and it was all so just so he could fund his bizarre fixation. He was brilliant, but God he was dumb. Obsessed and dumb. I didn’t see that until it was too late, and he left me twisting in the wind because he threw his life away over his obsession with
John’s fingers card through his hair, nails scratching oh-so-gently against his scalp. Sherlock relaxes into the feeling, tears drying as the awful cold feeling crests and then slowly recedes, leaving him relaxed and sated on the other side.He hums and nuzzles into Johns thigh, brings his arm up to drape across John’s waist, feeling the ache of overtaxed muscles and stinging reddened skin. The two of them are silent for several minutes, enjoying the warmth and closeness of their exhausted bodies.
John unlocks the front door and lets himself in, takes the steps up to the flat slowly, the dread increasing with each riser.
John places a gentle hand on this shoulder. The young man startles a bit, flicking his sad grey eyes up at John.
It takes a little time to transition into a grudgingly peaceful detente. The grumpiness still hangs in the air between them, the weight of it tiresome, to be sure, but not quite unbearable.
“You grew up just barely hanging on to the lower middle class,” Sherlock murmured. “Your dad had a decent enough job, something white collar, likely management, but he had little ambition to move up and watched his peers pass him by. He insisted your mother stay home instead of work. She resented it. He drank a lot, mostly in pubs, further compromising family finances. They fought a lot. About money, mostly, but also about the drinking and your father’s lack of ambition. He had a temper and a violent streak. He started to hit her, relatively infrequently, but when he did the beatings were brutal.
There's a truth here about Sherlock, something no one save John has ever understood: in the old times, this moment right
John scrambles clumsily to his feet, straightens, shrugs off the assistance offered to him as he shakes his head, trying to clear it. He’s wasted far too much time already, and now he’s lost the trail, lost Sherlock -- It’s almost certainly a trap, John decides, and he’s on the wrong side of it, and
“No,” John strokes his cheekbone with his thumb, tucks a lock of hair behind Sherlock’s ear with careful tenderness. “You don’t ever have to apologise. Not ever, all right?  We have time, we’ll take time. And it’s absolutely fine.”
Sherlock nods, top teeth digging into his lower lip in concentration as he positions their bodies, bringing John’s knees up over his shoulders, slotting their hips together.
Overwhelmed by emotion John presses forward to kiss Sherlock, bending him almost double as he smears messy kisses against his mouth, his face, his neck.
Sherlock is walking up St. James on his way to a haircut, the most boringly routine task imaginable, when they snatch him up in broad daylight.
“Of course,” Sherlock says. He removes the clip from Martinez’s gun, pockets it before placing the firearm back on the desktop. “I believe we’re done here.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer him for a long moment. John is about to think he’s going to ignore the question completely when he finally replies, low and quiet.
He took the cheque with his head held high, his pride still intact. If his goals and Mycroft’s happen to coincide, well, he can live with that. And quite comfortably, on that amount of money.
She nods, taking back the box and stowing it back under the bar, then turning away without further conversation.
“That’s enough for now. You really need to rest.” John turns away to put the cup back on the side table. Sherlock instinctively reaches out and seizes his hand in a burst of panic, the movement shooting fireworks of agony throughout his body.
You wanted us to get in to see him? You’re welcome.” John realises his voice is getting louder, lowers his volume. “Anyway, you’ve done it to me tons of times.”
The flames of his anger fuelled by her ugly mockery, the impulsive words tumble out of John’s mouth before he can think better of them.
“John,” Sherlock says, moving closer, close enough to place his hands on his chest and look down into his eyes. “You should know, you must know. I will always want you.” He brings long fingers up, brushes a fringe of soft hair off John’s forehead. “But I don’t want you to always feel so afraid of losing me. That’s a burden you shouldn’t have to carry.”
His gaze slipping lower, John takes in the firm, barely rounded curves of Sherlock’s pectorals, the spare dusting of dark hair between them, the layer of defined muscle only slightly softening the outline of his ribcage. His nipples are slightly oval, dark pink and hardened.
John shakes his head, can’t help but chuckle at his own lack of foresight or awareness. “God, Sherlock, no. Of course not. I just… I haven’t been thinking ahead at all, have I? Thank God you are.”
It’s not a video message. It’s a text from private number. John wonders (hopes) it is from Sherlock.
John has never given Sherlock more than he can handle, and Sherlock knows that he never will, but the belt is absolutely for giving Sherlock what he
“The spanking isn’t your punishment,” he purrs. “The punishment is how I'm not going to stop until you come untouched all over your pretty lacy knickers.”
Sherlock's eyes crinkle in a flash of amusement as he stands, holds out his hand to assist John off the floor. John accepts, allows Sherlock to pull him to his feet. Their eyes meet for the briefest of moments before John turns toward Mary.
“You all right?” he asks, and John shoots him a disbelieving look in return. Sherlock shakes his head at the obvious answer to his own question. “I mean, above and beyond -- ” he flaps one large hand around vaguely -- “all of this.”
A tall, familiar-looking older man hovers uncertainly in the doorway. “Dr Watson,” the visitor says in a gruff yet kind tone. “A pleasure to see you again.”
Alex Johnson emerges from the courthouse, pauses to don mirrored wraparound sunglasses before crossing the street against the light, mere metres away from where the SUV is parked. He’s a pallid, nondescript man, with the bloated but still vaguely muscular look of a former athlete slowly losing the fight against the gravitational pull of middle age. His suit is well cut and clearly expensive, his salt and pepper hair cut in a short, bristly way that John viscerally dislikes.
“The conditions have been set,” Mycroft replies, “and she has agreed to abide by them. If she doesn’t, well. Sadly, my control doesn’t extend that far. And neither does yours. We do what we can, Doctor Watson.”
John looks away, picks a piece of imaginary lint off his trousers, his heart shying away from this difficult truth. “You don’t know that for certain.”
But still it had always been an inequality, one that Sherlock didn’t even seem aware of and John had made his peace with, but still present and consequential in some very real way.
The detective cocks his head slightly and waits a beat for John to answer. When he doesn’t, Figueroa shrugs slightly, and drops his hand, affecting an unperturbed air.
“I don’t see myself that way,” Sherlock said, voice almost a whisper. “My body is nothing, transport, an afterthought.”
“I did indeed,” Sherlock murmurs, though John can hear the cheeky grin in his voice, he needs to make sure. He lifts his head, pulls back to look searchingly into Sherlock’s face.
“But,” he continues, kind but firm.“Sherlock, you know you should have told me. I would have agreed.”
John carefully stows both the printout and Sherlock’s crumpled photo in his wallet, determinedly not thinking about how to atone for his appalling behavior if (when) he sees Sherlock again.
Over the next few weeks, the pair resume a careful, cautious, somewhat stilted simulacrum of normalcy.
The intensity is disorienting, overwhelming, and John looks away, nods briskly. “That’s settled, then,” he says, in a casual tone that rings utterly false even to his own ears.
“On the contrary,” Sherlock replies in a low, throaty whisper. “I believe this is the most sane we’ve ever been.”
“I asked if you had any plans for the summer hols,” Dad says. “We’d been looking at going to Greece, you loved it there when you were young, didn’t he, Mum?”
“You feel so good,” John murmurs. Sherlock shivers, whimpering low in his throat at his touch. John traces the crease of his groin with his tongue, savoring the clean musky taste of him,  then dips his head in between Sherlock’s thighs, gently licking and kissing the soft wrinkled skin of his scrotum, taking first one testicle in his mouth, then the other, making him keen and writhe with pleasure.
“Oh love,” John breathes, and bends his head to press his mouth to the warm crease where groin and thigh meet, nose pressing into coarse fragrant hair, breathing in the earthy, spicy musk of his body. “Oh lovely,” he repeats, not even fully aware he’s saying it, “Oh lovely, oh love.”
The level is mostly empty, save for a handful of cars barely visible at the far end of the structure and one slightly battered-looking black delivery van parked nearby.
“I don’t know,” Shan gasps through chattering teeth. “I...I don’t know such stuff. I just do eyes. You Nexus, huh? I design your eyes.”
He sits crosslegged on the floor and reads the yellowing newsprint, looks at the photos of he and Sherlock in those ridiculous hats, and for some reason tonight instead of remembering the anger and turmoil and tears, he remembers all the good times, all the amazing nights of adrenaline and danger and laughter and friendship.
John wakes up, disoriented. He is lying curled on his right side, metal floor beneath him, hands bound behind his back, the smell of diesel fuel strong in his nostrils. Clearly the drugs haven't yet fully worn off because it feels like everything is rocking under his prone body.
“Would you have? If she had begged for mercy, if she had asked you to let her live, would you have killed her?”
Sherlock considers for a moment, then nods in agreement.“That’s probably the most likely reason. But still, I’d like to make a more thorough investigation.”
“Gorgeous slut,” John murmured fondly, and pushed back into the wet cavern of Sherlock’s mouth, groaning at the heat and the lewdness of it all, of what he was allowed--no, even better,
Sherlock nods, turns his head to find John’s mouth with his own. John kisses him, soft and tender, as a rush of fierce affection courses through him, a desire to shelter this unbelievable creature, keep him safe and whole and alive. Before he can give voice to any of this, however, one of Sherlock’s large warm hands lets go of the table edge, cups the hardness in John’s trousers, strokes him clumsily through the layers of fabric.
John watches as Glenn tidies the room a bit and changes the bed, humming just a bit under his breath the entire time. He then brings John  a fresh cup of ice water, tiny beads of condensation on the foam cup, paper top still on the straw.
“He was like an open book. Vulnerable. Nasty people would have hurt ‘im, so I let ‘im stay with me. I had a decent little setup, and...and I shared it with ‘im. We just, well, we clicked. We were a team. Don’t know why. Never felt like that before, not about no one.
,” he growls, knowing even as he says it that none of this is Mycroft’s fault, not really; in fact, in his condescending, presumptuous way, he is desperately concerned and trying to help in the best way he knows how.
He walks out of the hospital, away from the wreck and ruin of the normal life he had tried and failed to carve for himself.
“I don’t mind taking care of you,” Sherlock tells him. “I don’t mind it all. In fact, that seems to be the very point I’m trying to prove here, either to you or to myself or to anyone else that cares to notice. I am both able and very willing to care for you. If you would be so kind as to just
John’s mouth quirks just a fraction. “Tempting as that sounds,” he says evenly, “I think I’d prefer takeaway.”
“In that case,” Louellen replies, “Could you please stop stalking about and sit down so we can have a civilised conversation?”
“Sherlock,” John says, low but urgent, as if reading his thoughts. “Sherlock, love, listen to me. Are you listening?”
It has, so far, not been a particularly challenging or exciting afternoon. Lestrade had asked (begged, really) for their assistance in combing through cold case files sent down from Manchester, a string of unsolved murders with similar styles and details, trying to find a connection between them and a spate of possibly-related homicides in Enfield over the past month.
He rescued Seb that night, showed him he was so much more than what his creator made him to be, whispered fervent promises in his ear under the cover of darkness. And now Seb is an angel fallen to earth, all alone in this rotting, dying city, alone and cold and hungry because he believes in Jim, believes in his words, believes in his crusade.
“What about you, though?” John asks.”You haven’t been getting any rest yourself. You must be knackered.”
But he also knows John won't have it out with him here, in public. John is singularly protective of Sherlock's reputation and public image and he would never, ever chastise or even criticise him in front of others, especially not London’s finest.
John spreads his arms wide in sardonic invitation. “All right,” he says, his voice calm but deadly serious. “Say your piece.”
From outside the window an idling van driver honks the horn, loud and jolting, breaking the charged, intimate silence between them.
“You could be trying to poison me,” he observes archly, though he’s already mostly discounted the possibility.
“I opened the door with my big mouth, didn’t I?” John puts his water glass back down, studying the ridged pattern of the tumbler with more attention than it really requires, not quite able to look at Sherlock. “We’re both permitted to have feelings, you know. Occasionally.”
John nods. “Of course.” Revealing it was the difficult part; if there is anyone he trusts with this part of himself, it is Sherlock.
John waves off Sherlock's offered arm as he carefully swings his feet out of the SUV. His hubris is rewarded when he tries to stand; his knees wobble embarrassingly and he has to clutch at Sherlock to stay upright.
The danger zone, back then, was in the liminal space after solving a challenge, when Sherlock was full of good feelings -- but was then inevitably confronted with the cruel, crushing reality of an empty room, an empty
John is roused by the arrival and consumption of another disappointing lunch, followed by Sophie taking her afternoon round of vitals, noting his normal temperature and healing stitches with approval.
“Here?” John murmurs, gently cupping his heavy, swollen bollocks, thumb gently caressing the delicate, stretched-tight skin of his scrotum. He massages them with care, pushing them gently up against his body before releasing them to rest heavy in his palm.
The waitress dotes on him, tucking her hair behind her ear, refilling his coffee cup every five minutes and slipping him a piece of free pie that he won’t eat. He looks up bashfully through long dark lashes as he smiles shyly in thanks.
Though Sherlock doesn’t seem especially amenable to being cared for. In fact, John’s beginning to wonder if his recent domesticity is irritating Sherlock, contributing to his distant, chilly demeanour.
The second is, the heretofore abstract nature of his love and concern is completely evaporated, replaced instantly with the bone-deep knowledge that he will do whatever it takes to get this child safely into his arms where she belongs.
) an unscratchable itch under his skin, the image of pale eyes and dark hair now a permanent fixture in his mind. He needs context, he tells himself. He needs the hard reality of information in front of his eyes, needs the inescapable truth laid bare before him.
“This is the designated point.” Sherlock pauses, looking uncomfortable. “For our...appointed rendezvous. With Maria.”
“Of course I do,” Sherlock replies. “She was merely responding to a perceived threat. If I hadn’t been woken from a sound sleep, I never would have swatted at her. My arse will be fine in a few days, while my thoughtlessness cost her her life.”
John shrugs inwardly. He’s long past his lifetime limit for room-temperature hospital jelly, no big loss there.
John huffs a breath of laughter. “Yes, you git. Of course yes.” He brings their joined hands up to his lips, kisses Sherlock’s fingertips. “I told you it was going to be all right. Do you remember?”
It’s evening -- the glass of the narrow window at the far left corner of the room is dark -- and the single-bed hospital room is lit only by the bedside lamp and the bluish digital glow of the monitor screens that surround John’s bed. Those screens are attached to a cardiac monitor and PCA pump, respectively. A variety of equipment stands silent guard at the perimeter of the room, waiting to spring into action if needed.
“Blame it entirely on my husband,” Sherlock says, demanding fingers tugging on the hem of John’s jumper. “I was as pure as the driven snow before I met him.”
“Good evening, fellas,” Molly says kindly. The toys turn and march away, back to their places in the shadowy corners.
“Honestly, Sherlock!” she tuts, pretending she doesn’t even see John underneath him, his legs still wrapped around Sherlock’s arse. “I can see you’re a bit distracted, but I’m in the middle of my programme and the delivery man’s downstairs, he’s been ringing the doorbell for ages--”
“It truly is,” Sherlock says quietly, his tone a little remote and preoccupied as he bends over to take off his trainers and socks. John follows suit before the two of them walk across the beach, cool sand squishing between their bare toes.
Dizzy and almost overwhelmed with sensation, John breaks the kiss, sliding wet lips along the rough end-of-day stubble along Sherlock’s jawline as Sherlock’s hands pull him in even closer, roaming restlessly up and down his back in unspoken request.
“A little,” Sherlock admits, which means he must be utterly exhausted. “But I---I hate to break the mood, but I have a lot of work to do. I need to research this Boardwalk Angels gang--”
Sherlock wakes from a nap--he’s so tired, still, he looks and moves and acts like he’s better but he’s still healing and he gets so damn tired-- to John’s heavy, shuffling tread on the stairs.
Even a man as mentally disciplined as Sherlock usually gets bored on stakeout, willing to chat or trade stories or tell stupid jokes. But not this time. Sherlock says little, muttering terse one-word replies to John’s queries.
“Oh, I know, I know, but he’s just so...“her lips tighten in distaste. “He’s involved in shady stuff, I just know he is. Coming and going at all hours. I barely do any legal work, you know. He keeps everything to himself. All I do is answer phones and do billing, and most of those seem super padded.”
Tonight, the spectre of her hovers over the two tense, unhappy men as they sit in grey silence in front of a gently crackling fire.
“Fucking hell,” he sighs. Sherlock was right, John needs to rest, not tie himself up in mental Gordian knots he doesn’t have the strength right now to cut through. He carefully rolls himself to the right -- he hates sleeping on his back, so the recently-regained ability to curl onto his side is a tremendous relief -- and folds and tucks the flattish hospital pillow under his head. He deliberately slows his breathing, relaxes his toes and calves, calls up every trick he learned in his Army days to push himself down into sleep almost on command.
Sherlock exhales hard as he shifts just slightly, his spent cock slipping out of their joined hands. He doesn’t stop or slow as he continues to stroke John, coaxing him ever closer to the edge.
For the first time in his life Sherlock allows himself to trust, to believe with his whole heart. He surrenders to the gravity well of this new star, drawn inexorably in by the promise of warmth and light, allows the pull of it to finally coax him into a deep, dreamless sleep.
“You don’t find the fact that I’m a naive, blundering idiot sexually offputting?” Sherlock asks, clearly skeptical.
Somewhere several stories below a door clangs shut, the hollow sound ringing and echoing up the vertical stairwell to John’s ears.
“No,” Sherlock says, sharpish, and then looks a bit surprised at his own tone. “I mean. I’d rather if you came in with me.”
“What about you?” John asks, his voice coming out a shade more confrontational than he really intends, betraying his self-consciousness.“What you do about it?”
They spend the entire evening staking out at the back of Big Pete’s Discount Furniture on 5430 Kidder Avenue, waiting for the building to go dark.
“Well,” Sherlock shrugs with a show of supreme unconcern, “it would make my mother happy. This is the only wedding she’s likely to get, unless someday there’s legal recognition of the special relationship between a minor official and the British government he loves.”
“I know,” Sherlock finally says, conciliatory. “Stop stabbing at the jelly and eat your soup, please? You need the fluids and sodium.”
John’s breathing hitches as he uses the crop to pull Sherlock closer to him, pressing his warm sweat-damp chest into his back. His freshly-spent cock is still soft where it presses against the cleft of his buttocks but John still sighs into his ear, pressing his pelvis close, thrusting insistently against him, and Sherlock knows that if this ravenously insatiable man hadn’t already come twice in the past four hours and who knows how many times yesterday, he’d already be pushing his face down to the floor and pulling the plug out of his arse to fuck him hard for the third time today.
He’s a bit surprised when Sherlock answers. His beautiful angular face on the small screen is pale and impassive mask, eyes cold and blank.
“No,” Sherlock asserts. “I can see why you would think that, but I swear it wasn’t deliberate. I am, however, more than pleased with that outcome, of course.” The corner of his mouth twitches up in amusement as he scans the room, eyes landing on the lovely grey haired woman striding towards them like a flowy, flowered battleship at sea, a harried-looking Mycroft and his always serenely cheerful dad following a half step behind her. “Oh look,” he says, a wicked gleam in his eye. “There’s Mummy.”
They kiss and kiss, lying on their sides facing each other as morning melts away towards the afternoon, their hands moving across shoulders and backs, not yet quite daring to venture underneath clothing. After what feels like an age, John hooks a leg around Sherlock’s longer ones, drawing him closer, sighing into his mouth as they finally allow their bodies to  press more fully against each other. With a jolt, John feels how both of them are undeniably aroused, John hard against his stomach as Sherlock’s erection pushes against his hip.
They kiss slowly, almost carefully, exploring the boundaries of this new interaction. Sherlock seems--not hesitant, not uncertain, but inexpert, perhaps, a bit unsure of how to proceed. John takes the lead without hesitation, gently nipping and pulling at his full lower lip, dipping into his open mouth, seeking out his wet tongue with his own.
--The names and the idea of death by jellyfish are very very loosely adapted from the canon ACD story "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane". And yes, there really are tiny almost invisible jellyfish in the Oceania region that can kill you. Although how practical they would be as a murder weapon...well, probably not very.
Sherlock smirks.“Ooh, yes. You’ve got a taste for the really good stuff, don’t you? Your backer knew  about your heroin habit, but he didn’t know you would lose all control when granted access to pharmaceutical grade drugs, didn’t expect you to go crazy like an obese child in a candy store. That’s where the money’s gone. A body full of healthy organs is worth hundreds of thousands on the black market. You should be rich. Well-off, at least. But your clothes are high street, your shoes cheap. You’ve crashed before you’ve even got off the ground. You’re out of money, and you’re desperate.”
They cross the street, climb the set of stone steps to the front door. The polished brass plaque to the right of the doorframe reads “Bonner and Johnson, Attorneys at Law,” engraved in black script.
“Such language, Sherlock,” Mycroft tuts, sounding smug and starched and perfectly put together. “I would have called, but your phone battery is dead, as is John’s.”
John, of course, knew better, and the truth of the matter was much more difficult and complex to deal with.
“A nap first, then,” Sherlock declares. “After that, huge plates of horrible fried crap food. Then we’ll figure out our next move.”
Despite his hammering pulse and the crushing weight of fear pressing down on his diaphragm, John wills his voice to remain calm and uninflected.
John fucks him slow and deep like that for ages, and their bedroom is silent but for their moans and sighs and the sound of flesh sliding against flesh.
“I’ve thought a lot about it, and believe me when I tell you that this one time, Sherlock, none of this is your fault.”
“I bet you could if I pierced them,” John muses aloud. “Barbells that rub and catch on your clothes, making them hard all day long, keeping you so turned on all day long that you beg for me to touch, tug and bite and suck on them. I’d never even touch your cock, just play with your tits until you come hard all over yourself like the shameless little slut you are. You would love that, I bet. Wouldn’t you?”
If you are a surgeon or an ICU nurse, please be aware that I know there are many, many inaccuracies. Google and my personal experiences had to fill in the gaps.
John reaches for his gun; Jefferson snarls and bats it away like a cheap child’s toy. It clatters uselessly to the pavement as Jefferson hauls John up by the lapels, punches him in the face, makes him see stars.
John can feel the tightness in his shoulders and jaw, inhales consciously and deeply through his nose, tries to breathe past the moment.
(If she’s not, is he still willing to be her father? He isn’t ready to face the answer to that question just yet.)
Sherlock exhales as he climbs to his feet. "Very well, then,” he says crisply, with a practiced detachment John knows he doesn’t feel. “Let’s get it over with.”
“I thought maybe…” Sherlock takes a sip of coffee then sets the mug on the table, inhaling through his nose as if steeling himself for something difficult. “I was wondering if you’d like to take a walk through Regent’s Park.”
John leans his just slightly against Sherlock, their shoulders and arms pressing together. “So an inventory, then. What do we know, at the moment?”
The wave of menthol is strong enough to make John's eyes water, but it does push back the awful taste just a little.
Her face is perfectly guileless, open, cheerful. She has no tells. That very lack is her tell. John is getting pretty good at this.
“Okay, not that polite,” John chuckles, amusement winning out over irritation as he heads for the kitchen.
He’s so strong, always, and even now he’s so brave in the face of fear, and it’s for the sake of John alone, and John loves him for it.
John replays the events of the afternoon back in his mind, finds himself coming back to a singular question. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Sherlock tilt his head just slightly, anticipating his query.
He dreams, this time, in brief snatches, confusing, disjointed images and sounds that never quite resolve into any kind of linear narrative.
Sherlock complies; John positions himself between his knees, slowly sliding his fingertips down the warm, sweat-damp skin of his torso and back up again, thumbs circling his pebbled oval nipples.
John does, deep and hard, his wet lips smearing against Sherlock’s, breathing each other’s air, panting and moaning into each other’s mouths as they move together. The pace quickens, Sherlock gripping them both tighter, stroking harder, the friction and the slide of it so good it borders on unbearable.
Sherlock can tell by John’s posture that his back is sore; he’s still sleeping on the cheap futon in Harry’s spare room. Hasn’t found a place of his own, then. He shaved just before leaving for Baker Street, and he is wearing the blue jumper that Sherlock likes best. John clearly made an effort to look nice for him.
He can’t deny a sudden little ripple of anxiety, as the grand idea of leaving hospital suddenly seems more than a little rash now that they’re out here, alone, standing on the pavement.
“Yes. Mycroft Holmes is my brother.” Sherlock's voice doesn't change, but somehow John can still sense an annoyed sigh lurking within.
"Easy enough to plant undercover agents and steer Mary towards them. Mycroft did the heavy lifting there as well."
Stewart had said with an ugly sneer, and part of the reason that hurt so much was there was truth in it. John could try to minimize it, to deny it, but deep down he knows he’d been a slag in Uni, in the Army, keeping out any risk of real emotional connection with a man by by hiding behind a wall of furtive, loveless promiscuity--ah, he sees that now, and God, that awareness stings like hell, adds fuel to his already-immense pyre of self-loathing.)
“Shit,” he murmurs. His voice is barely above a whisper, almost too quiet for John to hear. “That wasn’t how I wanted to...John. I need you to wake up. I don't -- I need --”
,” says Sherlock, in a tone so sharp it could be used to perform surgery. “Maria Zimya. What can you tell us about her?”
Unfortunately, being absolute bottom-shelf rotgut, the bottle is made of plastic instead of glass, and rather than smashing dramatically against the wall as Sherlock undoubtedly intended, it bounces harmlessly off the plaster, clattering hollowly to the floor  unharmed.
“I got the fetal cell DNA from a blood sample I collected at the house in Camden. And I...” Sherlock’s expression turns somewhat sheepish. “And I already had your genetics on file.”
“I’ve improvised with less,” Sherlock replies before reaching into the shower and retrieving the bottle of body wash. He picks up the razor, the plastic comb, and a fresh towel before positioning himself between John’s knees and lowering himself to the floor, sitting back on his heels. He first quickly combs John’s still-damp hair, then carefully combs through his thick, wiry beard. He leans to his side and reaches over to the sink. He scoops out a cupful of water, mixes it with the liquid soap, and thoroughly lathers John’s face with the mixture.
John blows out a breath. “Martinez -- or Winters, or whoever he is -- obviously knows the contract is a route for us to get to Maria?”
“David Caldwell for Re-Election to Camden City Council,” John reads aloud, then nods. “Yes. I’ve seen the signs at street corners, now that I think about it.”
One corner of Mycroft’s thin mouth twitches upward in a small humourless grin. “By the by, just in telling you, I've made you an accessory to my crimes against the Crown. So you may want to keep this conversation strictly between us.”
He’s not any closer to figuring this mess out, not really, but as he pockets his mobile and opens the cupboard to search for a mug John realises his heart feels ten stone lighter than it did an hour ago.
“William Scott, he says briskly. "Interpol. This is my colleague, Gregory Lestrade. We need to ask the pharmacist on duty a few questions.”
The nurse must have removed the absorbent dressings last night, though he doesn’t really recall it happening. The bullet hole is smaller than one might expect, scabbed over in vivid reddish-black. The neatly stitched incision above, bisecting his left side just under his ribs, is still raised and a little angry. The edges are crusted with dried blood, the surrounding skin stained orange with Betadine.
Then the fragile bubble of dreaming bursts, and in loosely connected flashes John recalls the confrontation in front of the Wawa, the alligator man in the green tracksuit, the glimpse of movement in the corner of his eye, the bite of the needle as it sank in between his neck and shoulder --
Still caught up in his slow, slightly fuzzed out survey of his surroundings, John belatedly notices a soft, familiar sussuration of breath, which almost but not quite qualifies as snoring.
Sherlock peers closely at the young PC, making the man squirm a bit under the intensity of his gaze.
“Because you want to know, don’t you?” Sherlock’s voice is still low and quiet but his tone goes just a shade harsher, a shade more accusatory. “Some part of you wants to know the lurid details, the physical reality of what was done to me, the blood and the sweat and flesh and the violence of it all. Some part of you wants to picture it, and I know that horrifies you, because you’re a good person and you care about me, so you try desperately to shut it down, push it away. But the harder you try, the bigger that blank space grows.
Understanding washes over John, and the hollow despair in its wake is almost too much to bear. He swallows hard against the lump in his throat,  pushes down the hurt. Shakes his head.
Another awkward silence stretches out between the two men, both of them seemingly uncertain as to what to do next.
They stay like that for several moments, breathing together, John’s hand warm over his heart. The incipient panic fades, and Sherlock’s shoulders relax as the warmth returns, flows around him, cocoons him, protects him.
“I want to mark you,” John says. “Permanently.” He kisses Sherlock again, demanding and possessive. “I really want to, I have for a while, and maybe it will help you feel…” he stops, kisses Sherlock again. “Say I can, love. Say yes. Please.”
“A bit,” Sherlock replies, eyes still closed, hand wrapped around John’s waist, fingers pressing into the bit of flesh there. “But can we...can we just, stay here a bit longer? This is nice.”
Sherlock grins, then holds out a hand to John, pulling him up and out of the kitchen chair, stumbling gracelessly back a step in the process.
John’s shakes his head in disbelief. “You followed me out here not to apologize for your arsehole friend, but to find out if I really do like cock.” he barks a hoarse, humorless laugh. “Jesus Christ, Al. Yes, okay? Yes. I like birds, but I also like blokes. Happy now?”
“I know I’m working the homicide of Travis McGinty,” Lestrade says wearily. “I know I have Sherlock Holmes on record as a private forensic consultant. I know Sherlock has been working some leads on his own without telling me, because that’s what he always does. In addition, I know that fifteen minutes ago Mycroft Holmes gave me the last known location of Sherlock’s phone and told me to stay here and wait for you, and I do what Mycroft Holmes asks because if I don’t I’ll end up working in Animal Control. So, therefore,” he concludes with righteous exasperation, “I know Sherlock did something definitely impulsive and likely dangerous. At the same time, I clearly don’t know a damn thing. So would you be so kind as to enlighten me?”
“Right, then,” said John tightly. There was nothing else for it. Honestly, he should have stepped up yesterday and not let Sherlock get himself this far gone. “I’ve had quite enough from you.”
Sherlock kisses him back with equal fervor, with a hunger and greediness he’s never before shown, mouth open, inviting him in, full lips hot and searching against John’s, tongues wet and messy and near-frantic. Sherlock kisses him and kisses him, and John somehow feels like they hadn’t ever kissed before, not really, not like
“A change of scenery always helps,” Glenn proclaims, guiding John to the recliner, arranging pillows to support him, and making sure his IV is secure and flowing freely. “I bet some fresh sheets on the bed and something cold to drink would fix you right up.”
And what pleases John now, in this moment, is to bring Sherlock pleasure after his punishment, fucking him with careful aching slowness. He angles himself just a little bit shallower than usual in order to press against Sherlock’s prostate with every stroke, the silver sparkling pleasure of it a counterpoint to the insistent burning of his back and thighs and especially where the rough denim still rubs against him, John still clothed against Sherlock’s own shivering nakedness.
“Back in the eighties,” she says, setting the mug back on the table, “My husband passed away rather...unexpectedly. Or maybe not so unexpectedly, all things considered. Anyway, he left me a bit of money, and I bought my first business. A little corner market. Deli, beer, cigarettes, that sort of thing. The first time I met Maria, she was fourteen years old. I caught her shoplifiting soda and chips. She was a defiant little creature, stared me dead in the eyes even though I caught her red handed.
When John awakens again, he’s blurry and hazy and in a lot of pain, to be sure, but he’s markedly more aware of himself and his surroundings. His sandpaper-dry eyes struggle to focus, and he attempts to survey his surroundings without yet taking the gamble of turning his head.
The light of the screen in the darkened room is beginning to make his head hurt, so he puts his phone down and closes his eyes. He’s truly tired now, he’s exhausted himself with far too much activity today, but although he gives it a sincere attempt in a very comfortable bed, sleep seems to have completely fucked off for the duration and John remains resolutely, hatefully awake.
Sherlock draws the blackout curtains three-quarters closed against the new day, letting just a slim vertical slice of oncoming daylight in between the heavy drapes to illuminate the room.
Sherlock opens both eyes and looks at him. His face goes funny for a second as several different emotions attempt to cross his features at the same time.
it triggers every single one of John’s primal instincts, every nerve ending alight with a fierce possessive devotion he never knew existed in this world, a shimmering, transcendent feeling he now knows he can never again live without.
As sick to death as John is of being horizontal, his side and abdomen are making known their opinion of his questionable life choices, and truthfully, the rest of him doesn’t feel much better.
Yesterday morning, at the scene of the third homicide, Donovan suggested that perhaps the murderer was a Klingon. Sherlock had literally chased her from the room.
“Rocco, come in, please,” Atherton says. Rocco steps hesitantly into the kitchen, and John can instantly recognized the grief etched in the man’s pale features.
“Knees on the floor,” John ordered, the military edge creeping into his voice, brooking no dissent. Sherlock’s eyes widened first in surprise, then in pain, then something else altogether bloomed there. He allowed John to pull him by his hair into a sitting position, off the couch, then whimpered just once as John maneuvered him into a kneeling position on the floor. John pulled his head back by his hair, two fingers under his chin, tilting his head up so Sherlock was forced to look at him.
, uniquely so, gangly limbs and manic energy balanced by an innate, improbable grace -- a lithe, sinuous appeal that is surprisingly sensuous yet always primally, fundamentally male, never feminine in any aspect. Sherlock is absolutely, undeniably, gorgeously masculine in every manner and form, from his strong dark brows to the set of his shoulders, the flat planes of this torso, the narrow set of his slim hips.
John can feel Sherlock calculating scenarios, trying to figure out how to get the homicidal gun-waving man out of the equation without any of them getting hurt.
Ned Macgregor looks desperate, exhausted, pale enough to practically glow in the gloom of the warehouse. He’s not yet aware of John’s presence, his attention currently occupied with holding a large, lethally sharp butcher knife to Sherlock Holmes’ throat.
In reality, it’s 2:17 pm on a cloudy Friday afternoon, and all he can see are the assorted low metal outbuildings of the airport, the extended middle finger of the traffic control tower just beyond, and past that, a grey ribbon of highway snaking across the far distance. Above them, a 737 takes off for parts unknown.
John plucks the water from the table, nudges Sherlock with the bottle. “C’mon, love. Roll onto your side for me?”
“Well,” John says. “We are scheduled for another meeting tomorrow, and I look forward to seeing you again.”
Sherlock opened his mouth for him, and John pushed eagerly into the lovely wet heat. The angle was a bit awkward, but so worth it for the sight alone. A low moan escaped from John’s throat at the sight of Sherlock’s reddened lips stretched around his cock as the bound, blindfolded man suckled him eagerly. John wrapped the fingers of one hand in Sherlock’s hair and supported his weight on his other hand and began to thrust, gently at first and then deeper, watching the saliva gather at the corners of Sherlock’s mouth, sliding down his chin as Sherlock struggled to keep down his gag reflex. John pulled back, letting Sherlock recover his breath, then began to thrust deep. Sherlock began to drool in earnest around John’s cock, and the sight of his subjugation sparked something dark and primal inside of John.
John quirks an eyebrow, nods. “There’s gonna be police all over the place in about ten minutes. Keep your head down, stay out of the way.”
“Don’t you dare die on me, Mr Holmes,” he growls, an edge of panic colouring his voice. “Doc’ll fucking kill
Sherlock waves a hand at him. “Don’t be ridiculous. You haven’t the means, and I wouldn’t dream of taking it. Now, if you’d be so kind as to do as I ask, and quickly. The time for sitting and drinking tea is over. There is a great deal of work to be done.”
John chuckles in near-disbelief. “All of that spy stuff, going on a house where it looks like someone’s Nan is having us over for tea.”
He pulls it gingerly out of his jacket, swipes the screen. As he reads, his shoulders relax one fraction of a degree.
Six swiping movements; four letters, written in his messy all-capital half-cursive scrawl, located above the small white crater of his scar, the memento Mary left behind.
The three of them sit, regarding one another in stony silence. A minute passes. Sherlock and Louellen eye each other with chilly suspicion.
“Sherlock is an expert in the Nexus 6 units,” Doctor Holmes states. “He knows their specifications, their abilities, their reasoning processes better than anyone else in London. Well, aside from myself, of course. His insight will prove invaluable, I’m sure.”
as his eyes roam across miles of ivory pale flesh, taking in every dip and curve, every detail of Sherlock’s physical being.
“I’m not irritable,” John snaps, but even as he says it he knows it’s true. He’s stroppy as hell and for good reasons, poor sleep and jet lag and crap food and worry all piling up on his shoulders until he’s practically crawling out of his skin.
Sherlock grits his teeth just a bit at the familiar wave of annoyed fondness that Molly always provokes in him.
that does him in, makes John’s chest tighten and his stomach lurch as the suspicion hardens into a black, cold certainty.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock says kindly, with the private tenderness he reserves for John alone. ”No, it’s truly okay. You’ve just come out of heavy sedation.”  He brings the straw back up to John’s lips, patiently waits for him to take another sip. “You’re also on enough morphine to drop a rhino, so it’s absolutely to be expected.”
“All right,” John breathes. “Yes, God, fuck, you’re so amazing, but we’re never going to get there if you keep that up.” He closes his own hand around Sherlock’s larger fist, stilling his movement, then takes their joined hands away from his cock, already missing the delicious friction of it. “Ah. Okay.” he places a flat palm on the centre of Sherlock’s torso, over his heart, and pushes gently. “On your back, then, love. Knees up.”
John comes to full consciousness to find himself kissing Sherlock, slow and deep, disregarding morning breath or the press of his full bladder as their bodies writhe and rut against each other in mindless, instinctive need.
“You can, if you want to,” John murmurs. Even through the fog of pleasure and frustrated torment, Sherlock understands the shorthand of the statement, reminding him of his capacity to choose this, reminding him of his safewords.
“Doctor Watson, John, ohmyGod thank God you picked up thank God, I don’t know what to do, I just got here and I found him and I don’t know what to
That’s how Lestrade finds them a few minutes later, wet and clinging to each other, while a charred corpse lies not ten feet away. He raises a single eyebrow at them, and Sherlock sighs, annoyance tinged with a touch of self-conscious embarrassment.
He finds himself in a dark, narrow, rain-damp alley in between the casino buildings. A pool of streetlight and the flicker of passing cars at the right end of the alley directs him to the main road. Without pausing to catch his heaving breath John sprints to the intersection where the alley opens into Pacific Avenue, turning his head left then right, hoping to catch a glimpse of Sherlock.
“You’re easily eight years younger than Maria, so you didn’t meet in school. In addition, the edge of a facial tattoo is visible despite your headscarf, and the later-in-life conversion to a conservative religion are highly indicative of a history of incarceration.”
“Got it,” John says. He moves closer to Sherlock, places a hand on his forearm. “Will you also let me get you something to eat and maybe some coffee? You haven’t eaten since last night. You have a ton of work ahead of you and you need fuel.”
The unreality of it all makes him feel far away, almost untethered from his body as he takes a damp flannel and cleans her face, her hands. Her body is mottled with purpura, the lesions an ugly blackening violet, and the color of them makes him decide on the navy dress with flowers instead.
He almost bins all of Mary’s things, but in the end his pragmatic, frugal nature wins out and he spends an entire afternoon boxing her belongings for the charity shop, stacking them in neat rows against the bedroom wall.
“Such a good boy,” John says with approval, kissing his full mouth once more before straightening, dipping into the drawer again and finding the heavy black boar’s hair brush.
John shakes his head. “I’m still a bit…” he begins, then trails off as his belly gives a sudden, ominous lurch. For some reason, an atavistic bone-deep politeness reflex kicks in; despite the fact that this woman, whoever she is, is clearly deeply involved in snatching him off the street in broad fucking daylight, he’s not about to vomit all over someone’s nice furniture if he can possibly help it.
“It will get cold,” Sherlock promptly replies. He kisses John one last time before rolling off him and climbing out of bed, zipping up his jeans. “Shagging later. Dinner now.”
“God, John, yes, yes, fuck, oh God.” He babbles heedlessly at the wet heat of John’s mouth surrounding his testicles as his fingers stroke his twitching, leaking cock, gently first then more insistently. “I want,” Sherlock pants. “I want, I want--”
“Adequate,” Sherlock pronounces with just a bit of a wheeze. “Though I find it lacks the sophisticated notes of, say, a quality hand sanitizer.”
Sherlock takes another sharp drag, exhales twin plumes of smoke into the damp spring night. He glances sideways at John, looks away.
“You’re a tease and a horrible person,” Sherlock pouts. “There is no such thing. You’re making that up just to torture me."
“I remember lessons with Mycroft,” Sherlock says. “He was the one who played piano. I played violin, but I sat with him while he practiced. He said I had an ear for music.” His long fingers still, and he shakes his head. “They feel like my memories, but they’re not, are they.” It’s not a question
Sherlock shakes himself out of his brief reverie--he could think about John’s eyes for days, can even admit that to himself now without embarrassment, but that doesn’t mean it’s a wise use of mental capacity or time--and slides his arms into the sleeves of a crisp pale-grey buttondown. “I was thinking,” he says casually, as if he hadn’t a care in the world what John thought of the idea, “We ought to do it out at the house. There’s a registrar’s office not far away, and we could have some people over for a small...thing...after.”
random, not at all.  I can’t quite see the connections it would take to take all of this back to Moriarty. I’ve tried, to a certain degree, but if I’m absolutely honest, I find I...I can’t really bring myself to look too closely.
Sherlock moans against John’s lips. The idea of it, of John marking him, claiming ownership of his body--it lights his skin on fire, sends ripples of terrified, delighted arousal singing along his nerves. “Yes,” he breathes, feeling as if all the air is gone from his lungs. “God, John. Yes. Anything you want.”
“I looked at your memory files,” John replies. “I started to… I was going to look at the other stuff. I was. But I didn’t. I didn't want to.”
“It means…” Mrs. Hudson hovers in the doorway as she searches for the right words. “I wish someone would have taken me aside just one time and told me that thriving on drama like that, well, it has a cost. If I had known that sooner…” She looks more serious than Sherlock has ever seen her, and her eyes are sad. “I might have done a few things differently. I suppose I regret that.”
John lets his eyes roam over Sherlock’s pale, naked torso, so slender but surprisingly muscular, the dusting of downy dark hair between his pectorals, his small, oblong pink nipples.
Sherlock nods, takes the cups. John goes back to his side, opens the door and climbs in, careful not to hesitate or show strain, in case Patricia is looking at him through the shop window.
Alan shrugs. “Is it true?” he asks, and at least he has the decency to look ashamed while saying it.
Sherlock realizes there may be an easier way to get what he wants out of that locked room. He adjusts his posture, reframes his body language into... someone open, friendly.
He has a vague sensation of John taking off his collar; he wants to tell him to leave it on, to never take it off again, but he’s asleep before he can fully articulate the thought.
“You’re a bit of a white collar criminal,” notes Sherlock dryly. ”I’m sure the National Health Service would be thrilled to know of your larcenous habits.”
Something in the soft endearment broke the spell. Sherlock stared levelly into the eyes of the terrified man underneath him. “If you had killed my husband,” Sherlock hissed, “You would have died in this room tonight.” He sat up, flipped on the pistol’s safety and handed the gun backwards to John.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies. He looks at John and smiles, his eyes sparkling for the first time in far too long, setting John’s spirits alight. “Bless her menopausal criminal heart. It’s a puzzle.”
A moment stretches out between them. Sherlock’s eyes are blown wide and dark, only the barest sliver of pale green around huge black pupils.
“Shh,” John says, kissing the crest of his pelvis, “It’s all right, love, you’re doing so beautifully.”
Through his haze of wine and lust he makes an effort to push past his reluctance and find the words of filthy encouragement he knows John loves to hear.
“I don’t…” Sherlock begins, trailing off as he uncharacteristically struggles for the right words to convey his thoughts. “You need to understand that I have no particular love for that line of work. It is what Holmeses do, by default. Some family businesses paint houses or run launderettes. We are in the intelligence industry. My brother, my mother, her father... the line stretches all the way back to the time of Victoria. For several years they left me in peace as my drug habit made me too much of a security risk, and it wasn’t until after I met you and became more stable that my abilities again outweighed my liabilities. Mycroft has insisted I retain my active status, but most of the time I try to avoid it like the plague. Occasionally, it’s a mutually beneficial arrangement, but it’s not the work or the life I want for myself.”
Sherlock’s amiable expression falters, shutters. “I should have been, as well,” he says quietly. “John, I--I owe you an apology for that. Not seeing the truth sooner was an unconscionable failure on my part. I should have known. I should have warned you--”
“My own body betrayed me so completely, all my naive, arrogant notions about superior discipline and self control utterly demolished. I thought I was better. I thought I was
John is on the very brink of closing the gap between their mouths when he hears the unmistakable tap-tap-tap of Mrs Hudson’s heels on the stairway.
“You need fluid,” he says, and disappears into the kitchen. John hears the crunching of broken glass underfoot, then the low groan of the sink taps. Sherlock emerges a few moments later with a clean jam jar filled with water.
. It’s the difference between being terrified of the unseen terrors of the dark, and knowing exactly what monsters lurk in the inky depths, the dimensions of their teeth and claws and how best to kill them in a fight.
Sherlock thinks, but he’s still in that calm submissive space where he wouldn’t dream of arguing with John, so he remains quiet.
Sherlock stops in the middle of the sentence. He picks up the card again, and as he looks at it his face transforms, the light of a correct deduction sparkling in his eyes as he spins on his heel to face John.
“I do, but he’s not one to be trusted for a moment, and we’d be fools not to take out all the additional insurance we can. Especially now that we’re closing in on the endgame. Patricia’s obvious interest in you is an opportunity to gather some of those loose threads, and we mustn’t pass it up.” Sherlock pulls out his phone, checks the time.”She will be walking into the shop in exactly six minutes. Go in, loiter a bit, act like you’re checking the menu. In four and a half minutes, get in line. She’s quite taken with you, she will almost certainly initiate a conversation. I doubt you’ll need to do more than act politely interested.”
He’s curious, but now is not the time. Sherlock blinks, clears his mind, but puts a pin in the thought to revisit it later.
“I’m not wearing fucking pyjamas to a law office,” John grunts, wrestling with the top button whilst simultaneously trying to keep from pitching over and giving himself a concussion on top of all his other injuries.
“You want more, don’t you?” John asks mildly, pressing his questing finger in to the second knuckle, just barely ghosting over his prostate before pulling out, pressing in a second finger alongside the first. “Such a dirty cock-hungry slut. You want your arse filled up completely when I punish you, don’t you?”
Their hands tangle in each other’s hair, fingers tracing along the backs of necks and across shoulders but no lower. Their bodies are still carefully, deliberately separate, and John is fine with that, well aware of how easily all this could overwhelm both of them. They have time, time enough for everything at last, and this singular new expression of physicality seems like far more than enough to deal with at the moment.
John brings his hand back to Sherlock’s face, breaking the kiss. Sherlock is gasping for oxygen, apparently not having yet discovered one can snog and breathe through one’s nose at the same time.
“I did. There’s a key, a long metal thing, to turn the main water valve back on. Almost everyone had one, in the cellar or whatnot. Easy peasy. I knew folks growing up who hadn’t paid the city for water in years. Maybe ever.”
He’s just getting comfortable when Sherlock comes in, a glass of ice water in one hand and two white tablets in the other. He glances briefly at John, at his naked shoulders visible above the sheets, and he blushes adorably, cheeks turning bright pink.
A shy, slightly chubby, short-haired woman enters the room, carrying a tray containing a dome-lidded plate and varied plastic cups, as well as a steaming teacup.
He thinks of Katie Kravitz, that gun pressed into the flesh over her heart. He desperately hopes she is still alive.
His head swims just a bit, the blood rushing to southern regions as the familiar, insistent heat makes itself known, beginning to build between his legs, making his cock swell and thicken against the flannel of his pyjama bottoms.
The physical aspect is brand new, yes, but he sees now that the two of them have been in a romantic relationship for
“I’m not angry,” John repeats in a voice utterly devoid of inflection. “And we’re not doing this in the back of a cab.”
“As much as you are able,” she amends. “I do know you two, after all, and I am by necessity a pragmatist.” She re-shoulders her tote, flicks her hair back over her shoulder with a manicured hand. “And speaking of pragmatic, I must attending to other pressing matters, but I am certain we will be communicating soon.” She looks at John, her expression softening slightly. “Get well quickly, John. You have more work ahead of you.”
The betrayal, in the end, is what hurts the most. It’s lodged like a bone in his throat, something he cannot swallow down. The betrayal is what he can never forgive, no matter what carefully-crafted non-apology he may offer in words.
“Your job, as it were, encompasses far more than the mundane,” Sherlock says, suddenly more serious. “Surely you know that.”
A man with an ounce of sensitivity would have mouthed a platitude and let the matter drop.  Derrin Stewart does not have a single drop of sensitivity in his entire thick, lumpy, oddly-shaped body. “What happened then?” he asks with what looks to John like a bit of a sneer. “You run her off already?”
“Quite big of you to concede my point, despite the insults,” Sherlock murmurs. He drains his tea, then closes the notebook and rises from his chair, carefully folding his shirtsleeves up to his elbows before favouring John with a small but genuine smile.“You clearly cannot be allowed to run amok in the kitchen, committing random acts of needless dairy.”
“It’s jasper,” says John, “from Yemen. I saw it in a marketplace in Aden, the morning after I wrote the first letter to you. The colours reminded me of your eyes.” John pulls the pendant over his neck, places it in Sherlock’s hand. “I want you to have it,” John says, voice rough and choked. “To remind you that I’m always thinking about you.”
John’s eyebrow quirks in amused disbelief; not once in five years has Sherlock done the washing up without threat of bodily harm.
And in truth, now that he’s on the other side of it Sherlock is forced to admit that despite his misgivings the party, overall, turned out just fine. In fact, it was lovely. Lily, who despite being a brilliantly intelligent baby is still only a baby, understood very little of the goings-on but delighted in the event nonetheless, grabbing at balloons, tearing apart wrapping paper, and shoving fistfuls of cake into her mouth with gusto while the adults laughed and clapped and took photos and drank a remarkable amount of chilled prosecco.
“He would have figured out exactly where to find her. Days ago.” Sherlock doesn’t sound sad, or lost. He sounds
“Not all the time,” John rasps. “Sometimes I shout and stomp away, or do or say things I regret -- ”
“Hey yourself.” Sherlock slides the closet door shut, comes over to John’s side of the bed and perches on the edge. “Are you hungry?”
“Oh God,” John breathes. His wall of denial is crashing down; every fear about the fate of his daughter he has so steadfastly suppressed and ignored comes rushing out at him, hitting him with the force of a knee direct to the solar plexus.
John reached for the plate on the bedside table, peeled the foil from a plastic cup of applesauce, and began to feed Sherlock.
The Chief Inspector is the sort who manages to look sweaty and rumpled from dawn to dusk, one of those career desk jockeys of indeterminate middle age with a retreating hairline and an expanding waistline. He looks up when John flings open his closed office door, Lestrade close on his heels.
“Your pride is not worth causing internal injury. Or falling and cracking your skull like an egg. If you absolutely must wear them, just leave them unbuttoned. Your jumper will cover--”
John collapses back onto the bed, panting out sharp, mewling cries as Sherlock sucks him. One hands finds Sherlock’s head, weaves fingers into dark curls, not pulling or demanding, just guiding him, showing him how to best give him pleasure. “God, Jesus fuck,” he gasps, “Sherlock, God, you’re so good, you’re so good.” Sherlock hums at the words of praise; the vibrations travel through John’s cock straight up his spine, showering his brain in sparks of electric bliss. Without warning, John is suddenly, dangerously close to orgasm; he wants to, God how he wants to come hard into Sherlock’s lush wet mouth, rush of hot white pleasure spilling across his waiting tongue, come dripping from his beautiful lips as he tries to swallow it all down. It would be so good, God, it would be
?” John protests. “He’s running a pill mill in a poverty-stricken ghetto, and almost certainly committing a laundry list of felonies in the process.”
“Jesus Christ,” John breathes. “You’re the dirtiest thing I’ve ever seen. Tell me how good it feels, fucking yourself like that while I watch.”
Sherlock untangles himself from the sheets and rises. John can’t help but notice, with a shock of surprised arousal flooding his nervous system, that his erection is plainly visible, tenting the fabric of his loose pyjama bottoms as he clambers out of bed and ducks into the loo.
“Yes, I know,” John avers. “I didn’t want to wake you. We’re very near the airport. I figured that gave some reliable cover for the presence of a non-native.”
impromptu vacation," Sherlock informs John cooly, tone devoid of emotion. "I'm having their whereabouts traced, but it will take time."
recently gutshot in a parking garage in New Jersey, of all the goddamn places on Earth, and consequent to all of that pretty much mostly dead and
“S’alright,” Sherlock mutters, exhausted, eyes closing, slumber already claiming him. John feels his own body clamoring for the sweet pull of sleep, but fights it off for few minutes more, long enough to stumble into the loo and wipe himself down with a wet flannel, then bring one back to bed for Sherlock.
John huffs out a frustrated, contemptuous noise, shakes his head. “Look. I’m trying to be honest about my life and my decisions. You and your friends in there should do the same. So, no hard feelings. Just... lose my number, okay? I mean it. I have so much to deal with, and I don’t need this particular brand of bullshit.”
“I’m sorry.” The words tumble unbidden out of John’s mouth, as raw and pained as the gash in his flesh. “I’m so sorry.” And now that he can see the toll his actions have taken on the person he loves most in all the world, the unshed tears begin to fall unchecked. The pain and regret are enormous, overwhelming, and he can’t hold it in anymore, warm wetness running down his cheeks, fat drops falling on his injured arm. “Jesus, Sherlock, I’m so fucking sorry.”
“God, I love your nipples,” John sigh, his steely voice softened with just a touch tender reverence. “Such small delicate bits of skin, but the way it drives you mad. Jesus. I could watch you like this all day, just teasing and torturing you like this and never even touching your cock. Could you come like this, I wonder? What do you think?”
After several long perfect minutes of mindless sated nuzzling Sherlock stills against John’s mouth, as if a question has suddenly occurred to him.
“I could have done it,” Sherlock mutters, sounding more noticeably drunk than even a few minutes ago.  “I could have done it, several times over. I could have. Maybe I should have. But I didn’t. Because...at the bottom of it all, even in the midst of all that horror, I discovered I truly wasn’t ready to die. The will to live is the strongest instinct we have, and even while I was being raped and beaten every day, I still desperately wanted to live.
“Just pointing out.” He tosses the shirt aside, allows John to pull him back down into bed, twining their arms and legs together and exchanging lazy kisses back and forth.
Taffey is an...unpleasant looking man. Not fat, exactly, but flabby and moist looking, his skin the color of an underground mushroom.
“I need to get us cleaned up. Will you be all right for a moment?” Any other time Sherlock would give him a snarky rejoinder about not being mentally handicapped; one-foot-still-in-subspace Sherlock just nodded and closed his eyes. John hurried to the bathroom and fetched dry flannels and a basin of warm water as quick as he could. By the time he returned to the bedroom Sherlock’s breathing was calm and even.
Sherlock straightens, grinning, his shy self-consciousness fading in the face of an opportunity to take the piss out of John. "I have seen porn, John,” Sherlock replies, tilting his head and quirking a sardonic eyebrow. “I am well aware of the mechanics of that particular act. And while your size is impressive, it’s not so far outside the norm it requires a warning label.”
And in point of fact, Mycroft has always been the one that subsidised their misadventures, with the occasional grumble or guilt trip to be sure, but he had never denied anything to his brother, or to John now that he thinks about it. And for that matter, he hadn’t ever used money to leverage or manipulate either one of them, excepting that one initial offer made to John, an offer he now sees was only intended to test his motivations and protect Sherlock from those who would take advantage of him.
But John persists, knowing that despite Sherlock’s refusal to share his own bed with him, the act of taking himself back to his own room would be interpreted by a fragile and insecure Sherlock as a rejection, as a repudiation of the tentative progress they had made not so many days ago. No, doing that would making an already difficult situation even worse.
various states of undress over the years. That doesn’t mean that he fails to notice the flat, hard planes of his stomach, or the shadowy trail of dark hair that starts just below his navel, disappearing into the waistband of his snug pants. It does mean, however, that he’s gotten quite skilled at hiding the fact that he notices.
“I was sent to infiltrate a Serbian arms smuggling ring that looked to be one of the last remnants of Moriarty’s operation.
Sherlock’s bedroom it is, then. Sherlock turns on the bedside lamp and sets the water and aspirin on the table. He returns to the sitting room to see John already dozing in his chair.
He dresses carefully and dries his hair, waiting for John to ring the doorbell, trying to ignore the nerves gnawing away at the pit of his stomach. He’s pacing the sitting room, crossing back and forth across the faded rug on bare feet, when he hears Mrs. Hudson open the front door. Sherlock is not at all surprised to hear Mrs. Hudson speaking in fond tones, and John’s deeper voice growing muffled as she envelops him in a hug at the foot of the steps. Sentiment and fondness won her over in the end, and Sherlock can’t help but smile a bit at the notion.
get the fuck out of our flat,” John rasps at Mycroft, scrubbing a hand across bleary eyes. He looks for all the world like an angry, sleepy, bleary hedgehog, and Sherlock feels a fierce, protective stab of adoration.
“Research, John. Jennifer hasn’t notified the actual police, I’m certain, due to her criminal history. If Maria’s ill and desperate, she may slip up, use the credit card more than once or twice, leave a trail for us to follow. Even if she hasn’t, we have her birth name, we can look up school files, property records, construct a data map of her known areas…”
As he reflects a bit further, John begins to consider what it must have cost, emotionally, for Sherlock to say those words out loud, to admit to feeling lost, adrift without the older and wiser sibling that had loomed large over him since the day he was born. Viewed from that perspective, it makes sense, how Sherlock reflexively denied overwhelming emotion, pulling back into his shell, retreating to his mind palace to regain a shred of his shattered equilibrium.
Before he can answer, the handle turns, and he turns his head away, embarrassed, as the nurse from earlier this afternoon --
“You’ve watched me do it a hundred times besides, and there’s no way I can sew myself up one-handed and half-drunk,” John says. He cocks an eyebrow, his lips curving into a rueful smile. “Face it, right now you’re the only game in town.”
‘Okay,” John says, voice low and soothing. “What I’m getting is, you think that I’ve been so much more, um,
After a few moments of lovely, heated snogging, Sherlock breaks the kiss and sits back up on his heels, straddling John’s  hips, the warm springy flesh of his bum a pleasant weight against John’s very interested groin. He tugs the shirttails out of John’s jeans, undoes the fastenings of his plaid shirt carefully, slowly, focusing on slipping the small white discs out of their buttonholes as if the mysteries of the universe were contained beneath.
“I don’t think this is --, if I -- this isn’t good, okay, and you have to. Please.” John is fighting for each breath now, the icy tremors of shock setting in as his abdomen fills with blood, his diaphragm unable to expand properly. “Please promise me that if I don’t -- if I can’t -- you have to keep going. Promise me you won’t stop until you find her.”
“Oh,” he breathes out, and tilts his hips upward, pushes back, carefully, and is rewarded by sparking shocks of a complex, compelling pain-pleasure. “Oh, God,” he groans, brokenly. “That’s--fuck, that’s it. Oh, God, just like that--”
“I…” John pauses, considers, decides to make Sherlock work just a little for it. “If you need my assistance.”
“Cabbage,” replies Sherlock. “To dry up milk production. Old midwives’ remedy, remarkably effective.”
“All right,” Sherlock murmurs as he turns away, and John doesn’t miss the flush that stains those sharp, pale cheekbones.
He resumes plugging quarters into the machine with numb fingers; another minute passes. She takes another two steps towards him, coming more fully into his line of sight.
He probes that awareness, carefully, like a loosened tooth. She’s so abstract to him, still, a blank space awaiting definition, and John doesn’t quite know how to feel about her as yet, as a real (though tiny) person rather than the object of their long strange quest.
“I did?” John asks. It’s the first time, really, that Sherlock has alluded directly to feeling physical attraction to him.
He exits the car, ducks into the restaurant to use the somewhat grimy restroom, washes his hands. He regards his reflection, briefly, in the wavy, shatter-proof mirror.
I may have been the one who pulled words out of the air and arranged them in a semi-coherent manner, in order to finally finish this story at long last...but as the saying goes, the real story here is the friends I made along the way.
It’s just another day in their lives, utterly ordinary, nothing special in particular. But what Sherlock understands now is how happiness, when you really have it, sometimes looks like nothing in particular at all.
“I hate to wake you, I really do. I got us a room, you need to get up now just for a few minutes. Come on, ground floor. It’s not far.”
“I believe that will do,” Sherlock says evenly. John nods and rises; with Sherlock keeping a weapon trained on Martinez, John keeps his newly acquired gun pointed squarely at Nestor, although at the moment the man is moaning, maybe sniffling a little bit as well, and generally not looking like much of a threat to anyone at the moment.
He’s on his stomach, head turned to the side, neck at a funny angle. He tries to roll over, and every muscle in his back and legs (and shoulders, and arse, oh,
Sherlock and John made it through the ordeal alive and relatively unscathed. Moriarty is dead, his network shredded, the threat hanging over them neutralised at last. Their happy ending has been secured. All is well.
“I have an idea,” he says after a bit of thought, climbing off Sherlock. He grabs a pillow and folds it in two, shoves it under his head as he lies back in the hopelessly tangled sheets.
“Most of all, you may forgive me -- and I will be grateful forever that you have forgiven me, profoundly so -- but I will never, ever forgive myself, not even on the day I die. The only thing I can do, then, is learn to move forward while bearing that guilt, to accept the truth of what can never be undone, and live with it for the rest of my life, as well as I can manage.
“I assure you we are indeed police officers,” John ventures, showing the badge Sherlock pressed into his hand moments earlier.
John and Sherlock in an old Ford Focus, crossing that bridge as the sun rises over the city. They’re dressed in street clothes. Sherlock’s hair is cut short, a cigarette smoldering between the fingers of his hand as it grips the steering wheel. They’re both grim, resigned, tired beyond exhaustion.
“Please,” Sherlock says again, and buries his face into the sweat-damp curve of John’s neck, nibbles at him with his sharp white teeth, soothes the nip with catlike swipes of his soft tongue.“I want to see you. All of you. Please, John.”
“He’s an adult,” John snaps, “despite all evidence to the contrary. He doesn’t need you to fight his battles.”
John can’t believe his ears. He shakes his head. “What, you think I’m just going to...lie here, while strangers are holding my child?”
His eyes close involuntarily as shivers of animal pleasure skitter up his spine, lighting up the base of his brain,
Sherlock stabs a long index finger into the pile of paper. “The person we need is right in front of us. The attorney of record.”
“Okay,“ Sherlock murmurs. John unbuckles the leather strap, pulls the collar free from his neck. For a moment he feels an odd dislocation, a moment of vertigo between submission and real life, between what he is and what he could be.
What he doesn’t expect is that the instant the front door closes Sherlock wraps long fingers around his upper arm, stopping him before he can start up the stairs.
“New mobile,” he said. “I’d like to see you every day, I’d love to, but I’m going to leave it up to you.”
“The key card doesn’t work,” Sherlock tells him. “Lee must have locked the building down when the police arrived.”
That brings Sherlock out of his daze enough that he picks up his head, looks down at John with a slightly lifted eyebrow.
“It was an invitation I couldn’t possibly refuse,” he replies, cool and brusque despite his emotions.
Her blue eyes are sharp as they focus on John’s supine form on the couch. The look she gives him isn’t
Finally after what feels like an age that could be measured in geologic time, the cab pulls up in front of 221B. Sherlock throws a couple of bills at the driver and launches himself out onto the pavement before the taxi has even come to a complete stop; John follows in his wake, trying unsuccessfully to stifle his laughter as Sherlock fumbles with his key at the front door with unusually clumsy fingers.
They smile at each other, a moment of improbably perfect harmony. They’re sure of each other, as certain and solid as the floor beneath their feet, and Sherlock loves John so much he almost can’t breathe.
“This is the hard part, isn’t it?” he says, quiet and serious. “When we’re not…” he waves his hands in the air, vaguely gesturing towards nothing, and everything. “Running on adrenaline, chasing leads, solving cases, running down bad guys, facing danger and death. That all comes so…not easy, it’s never easy, but we attract it, we’re drawn to it, we keep finding ourselves in it up to our very necks, and we just keep moving forward. Like sharks that can’t stop swimming. Things only get hard when we’re just, you know. Existing.” He shakes his head, looks down at his hands. “John. Why are we such rubbish at just
“Indeed she does. It was her home from birth until age fourteen. Her parents were young, uneducated, never quite managed to establish a steady address. Mainly, they bounced from one relative to another.” Sherlock purses his lips, deep in thought. “This town has one of the highest percentages of abandoned property in the country. There are literally thousands of empty buildings.”
His words are calm, but dipped in reproof and edged with hurt, and John suddenly sees with sharp clarity that of course that’s what Sherlock is doing, and John is pushing back on it because he feels weak and not in control, and that’s what he does, isn’t it, says something unfair or unkind to Sherlock when John is the one feeling unbalanced and out of sorts and...
“Something unspeakable, I hope,” Sherlock rumbles, his voice honeyed and deep in the way he knows John loves.
,” he murmurs, giving Sonia a smile as warm and private as the one she favoured him with a moment earlier.
A moment passes in silence, then Sherlock’s body begins to quiver and hitch. John tenses, strokes his damp hair, concerned. “Are you all right? Did I--”
-- and the pair leave the car, sticking to the shadows as they make their way to the back door. From an inside pocket Sherlock produces a heretofore unseen set of lockpick tools.
“You’ve walked out twice on me tonight. And here I thought I was being charming.” John tries to smile; it feels false, hollow, like it hangs all wrong on his face. He gives it up.
“Come on,” John murmurs as he rises, pulling a gorgeously naked, unprotesting Sherlock to his feet, leads him into the small, dingy bathroom, turns on the shower.
A moment of uncomfortable silence stretches between them, two men floundering about, both clearly miles out of their emotional depth.
“Maybe…” Sherlock pauses, experimentally cupping his testicles in his palm, assessing. “No, I think I’m fine.”
John surveys the group he’s facing, and suddenly sees with stomach-dropping clarity that he’s the one being irrationally aggressive, a crazy old man ranting and waving a gun at a bunch of frightened kids.
“Correct in every particular,” Sherlock replies. “And sad to say, exactly the sort of person I expected.”
She sighs in consternation. “I knew it. I’ve always had a feeling about that man. He just…” she makes a face, shakes her head. “Gives me a bad feeling, you know?”
His brother had surmised the impetus behind the invitation immediately, of course, and had sent them a multitude of congratulatory gifts (again, guilt) most of which John found extravagant and Sherlock found condescending. One of them, however, is surprisingly acceptable to both of them. John is wearing it today--a soft jumper of expensive cashmere, the colour a luxurious slate blue. Sherlock has to grudgingly admit that Mycroft--well Anthea, most likely--has impeccable taste, for the shade brings out the colour of John’s dark, complex eyes perfectly.
John places the iridescent sliver carefully in the bag. “Gloves are for preserving the integrity of evidence for trial. Replicants don’t get trials.”
who I am, thanks.” Sherlock moves closer to the shelves, swipes a finger across the edge. “Needs dusting in here. May want to have a word with your cleaning person.”
She’s sleeping, carefully wrapped in snug burrito-style in a pink striped blanket. Her head is bald save for a bare dusting of pale fuzz. Her lashes are already long and dark against cheeks that are chubby and pink.
After that comes the incomparable relief of nothingness, a span of time that simultaneously seems both eternal and momentary.
John crouches in the shadows, heart sounding thunderously loud in his own ears, waiting to see if the screech of the bay door attracted any attention. A minute passes, then another. No one arrives to investigate.
As John completes his survey of their quarters he realises Sherlock is just standing there, gazing at him blankly, almost robotically. He’s not really fully awake, and John decided to take full advantage of the moment.
John’s face is a study in careful concern. “Do you...Okay, then. You want me to put your collar on you because you have strong feelings you need help to process.”
Sherlock works on his laptop, blue glow reflecting off the pale flesh of his torso, muttering to himself occasionally. John flips through the television channels, finally settling on an old nature documentary. The warm, hushed timbre of David Attenborough’s RP accent is a balm to his system, makes him feel just a little bit more like his old self, like the self he was before Mary, before Mycroft’s death, before leaving 221B one last time, following Sherlock without knowing if they would ever return.
“I wish that were the case, but it’s not. It’s not just about you and me. You have people who love you, who want to protect you. If I come here to stay, she’ll be poisoning my tea within a day.”
Now, however sipping flat warm lager at a table with five barely-friends from his Army days, John feels anxious and annoyed and like he pushed himself far too hard far too soon. Alan is gripping the edge of the table for dear life; likely he’s been getting shots forced down his throat since he first set foot in the pub.
John patiently works him with his tongue, first tracing wet swirls around the tight furled knot of his entrance, then licking catlike stripes along the entire exposed cleft. He takes his twitching, iron-hard cock in his left hand and strokes slowly, carefully, not quite enough stimulation to bring him to climax but enough pleasure to help him relax and open up to John’s careful ministrations.
“I can do it,” he proclaims, and even as he says it he knows he sounds far too much like a nap-deprived toddler.
“Thank you for apologizing,” Sherlock finally says, a bit formal. “It wasn’t necessary, but it was...kind of you. So thank you.”
At the top of the steps, the first door in front of them is closed. The nameplate identifies the occupant of the office.
While John waits for the area to become fully desensitized he sends Sherlock upstairs to scrub his hands, with the admonition not to touch anything on the way back down. Sherlock complies, though not without giving John his very best 'I’m not a moron' eyeroll.
“I don’t have one,” he says in a small, sad voice. They regard each other for a moment, then Seb gives her one of his sweet smiles, boyish, bashful.
“Mrs Hudson, please,” Sherlock sighs, taking the plate from her and placing it on the kitchen counter. He turns his head away to hide his blushing embarrassment as he does so, and John can’t help but grin in amused fondness.
Sherlock nods, brings one hand up, tentatively brushes the bare skin of John’s shoulder, sweeping fingertips slowly across the line of his collarbone, raising goosebumps on his skin, making him shiver with anticipation as he moves lower, carefully, with an agonising slowness that’s perfect and unbearable at the same time.
--and emerged on the other side just fine. Logically, there is no reason this relatively undamaging incident should be this emotionally destabilizing.
John presses his bony hips down to the mattress. “Behave, slut,” he growls, slapping Sherlock sharply on the inside of his right thigh, just above the knee, making him give a garbled cry as his hips try again to thrust off the bed. “I know you’re close,” John tells him.”You’re so close. But not quite there yet, are you?” He slaps him again and again on his inner thighs, alternating sides, striking the delicate flesh until his fingers are stinging. Sherlock cries out as his hips flex involuntarily, so close, so very close to the precipice but unable to tip over.
Cradled in her left arm is an infant, dressed in a pink footed jumper. The baby is only a few weeks old, but wide awake, already picking her head up, curious about the world around her.
“Look at how badly you want it,” John chuckles, dark and soft. “And you’re at my mercy, aren’t you? You need it, and you need me to give it to you.” He runs his fingers across Sherlock’s puffy lower lip, slips two of them into his mouth. Sherlock watches himself suck desperately at John’s fingers as they fuck his mouth, the drool shining wet in the corners as John shoves two more past his sore overused lips. Sherlock sees his mouth stretches obscenely around four fingers as his cock bobs stiff against his belly, wet with leaking precome, and he cries out in sharp pleasure when John pulls his wet fingers out of his mouth and wraps them around his painfully hard cock.
“I’m looking forward to seeing you, too!” Patricia replies. “And you too, of course, Mister Holmes.”
“You play beautifully,” John says, his voice rough and low as he gazes at the long pale line of Sherlock’s neck, the strong angle of his jaw, dusted with the beginnings of a gingerish stubble. The simple, uncomplicated humanity of that imperfection, that mark of an exhausted man needing a shower and shave and a good night’s sleep--it makes something blaze forth inside of John, hot and bright and wanting.
Don’t let anybody ever persuade you that renovating a house is a doddle.  I think it’s the most stressful thing I’ve done since battlefield surgery.  Especially with a genius detective ringing up at all hours of the day and night asking case-related questions, and whining about where the sugar is, or isn’t, ‘and why aren’t you here, I miss you.’
After our meal we take our coffee on the terrace.  The garden slopes steeply down towards the meadow beyond where I watched the tractor earlier.  The hedge that separates the two is heavy with bramble blossom and dog rose.  The sun has set behind the Down, and bats are hunting, whirring over our heads as we sit in comfortable wicker chairs.
Jesus, Sherlock, I want to kiss you.  I want to stand up and grab your lapels and drag you across this table and snog you senseless right here, in the middle of this pretty little restaurant garden, surrounded by all these people, who will stare, and I don’t care, because I want to kiss you so much.
Sherlock crouches down and rummages in the dusty hollow under the tree.  He pulls out a plastic carrier bag.  Something is wrapped inside.  He glances in.
‘No, Sherlock.  I need to be here when the builders arrive, and I’m not getting up at 4am when I’ve shagged you the night before.  There are limits.  Especially with my knees.’
Later, an owl breaks into my dreams.  It’s weird, shivering cry draws me into consciousness, and I realise that Sherlock is wrapped around me, snoring gently.  (That’s another thing people don’t expect about Sherlock, he snores dreadfully, to the point that I am beginning to suspect sleep apnoea as the root of his recurrent insomnia.  I can hear him through the floor of my bedroom at 221B.  Snores like a bloody hog.  It’s that stumpy little nose of his.)  He has fastened onto me like a cross between a giant sloth and a limpet.  And you know what?  It feels fantastic.
‘Mmmm,’ he says and sips at his iced tea without looking up.  Thank goodness we are booked at the pub later, I think, getting back to my pigeon breast and puy lentil salad.  Need to get food inside him to keep his brain firing at optimum levels.  It’s a habit I’ve forced him into over the years – before we met, he would go for days without eating.  Now I think he has come to terms with the fact that food might actually be useful fuel for his immense mind.  But he’s taken some persuading.
It’s a hot drive out to Chichester to see the detective in charge of John-Matthew Allen’s case, and we sit in traffic on the A27 for most of it.  Sherlock isn’t very good at heat.  Cold is his natural element.  I’m not sure his body is capable of regulating temperature very well.  The more he sweats, the crabbier he gets.  By the time we arrive at the broken-down 1970s office block that forms the home of Sussex Constabulary’s detection corps, he is the foulest mood possible.
And then Josh looks up at me, and for a moment I think he will cry.  ‘When you find him,’ he says, ‘tell him I said hi.’
A woolly dog, one of several hanging around, comes up and sniffs our trouser legs as we pick our way across the encampment.  Nobody else seems to be around.
‘Subtle as a brick through a windscreen,’ I agree.  ‘We’re trying to find John-Matthew and we wondered if you could help.’
And no man could commit suicide more easily than him.  He would know exactly how to do it, the surest, quickest, most painless way.  I know he can do it.  He’s done it once already.
He hesitates, takes a lungful of air, expanding his ribs, and then plunges forward.  The muddy water foams up like cappuccino froth, closing over his head, and then he bursts through the surface again, slick and lithe and wiping his wet ringlets back from his face.  He rolls onto his back and skulls a little, and I can see his gorgeous cock floating, ghostly white under the brown water.
His mouth progresses, rasping and sucking, finding the tender places on my stomach and hips, the sensitive spots that make me squeal or moan.  He works his tongue along my hip bone and down my groin, tugging at my belly hair with his teeth.  He nudges between my legs to lick ribbons of pleasure up my inner thighs, until I am shaking with desire.  He works his way back up then, until he reaches my scrotum, and butts it gently with his nose, breathing deeply the musky odours of my crevices.  He sucks one of my testes into his mouth, and it is at this point that I lose any power of speech that I might have retained.  He seems to like the taste of that one, rolling it on his tongue, because then he tries the other one.  I become aware that I am making an odd keening noise in the base of my throat.  No one has ever done anything like this to me.  Bits of me are singing that I never thought could be sexually responsive.  Especially down there.
Presently the woman comes over, still partially naked, like an English amazon, carrying a tray on which are three enamel mugs of tea.
I stumble to the river’s edge and watch him feeling his way, edging up to his knees and then thighs.  The hairs on his legs squiggle flat with water, droplets making crystal globes on the pale flesh.  I detect goosebumps on his forearms from the shock of the sudden cold.
Before I start, a little preamble, just so’s you know, okay?  I’ve been Sherlock Holmes’s friend, flatmate and colleague for five years.  It doesn’t throw me anymore when people make assumptions about us, though it used to.  I don’t bother to correct them these days.  It’s too much work, anyway, and they never listen.  People think what they want to think.  Sherlock says they can think what they like.  We know the truth.  And we do.  It’s far more complicated than anyone would believe.  That’s how life tends to be, in my experience.
It has been five years since I met him.  Nearly six since I was shot.  In that time, I have slept with a number of women.  Not one of them has seen me without a t-shirt.  Having sex while clothed, at least on the top half of the body, is not as bothersome as you might think, though it can be rather frustrating.  Still, it is a sacrifice I am willing to make for my own privacy, and for my partners’ peace of mind.  I don’t want them to see what is under there.
So yes, we slept late and made love, and then lay in the after-glow, which is my favourite part, especially when I’m tired and Sherlock fucks me.  It’s not that I don’t like being fucked, believe me, it’s fantastic, but it tends to be rather, well, rough, that brutal but thrilling invasion.  I’m more the tender, loving type.  I like it gentle.  He always says that when I do it to him, I don’t do it hard enough.  Maybe he’s right, I don’t know, since I don’t have another lover to ask.  Anyway, we were lying in each other’s arms, letting our heart rates drop, sweat soaking into the sheets, kissing and looking into one another’s eyes.  (Yes, it’s sloppy, but that’s who we are, even after this long.  Ten years we’ve been together, and four since we signed on the dotted line, as he likes to put it – the civil partnership was literally a matter of paperwork, seeing as we both felt that we’d had our ceremony on the banks of the River Arun, under those shivering silver birches.  So we are husbands, too, as well as lovers, friends, colleagues and all the other stuff.)
This wasn’t Sherlock admitting he was wrong.  Of course not.  He is never wrong.  He was simply acknowledging that I had a point about the inconvenience.
‘I will find us a cottage, and make you a garden full of flowers, and build you as many hives as you want,’ I tell him.
Sherlock let himself through the wicket gate in the low hedge, and walked unsteadily out onto the sloping lawn.  I followed, entranced at the sight of him surrounded by green, the pasture below the hawthorn hedge, the grass, the late roses making aching splashes of colour in the midst of it all, echoing the sudden roses in his alabaster cheeks.  The Down reared up behind us, and in front another, on the other side of the valley, cupping us in their soothing embrace.  The river between glittered for a moment, as silver as Sherlock’s irises when he’s cracked a case.
‘What?  What is it?’  I retrace my steps until I am standing in front of him.  A soft night breeze ruffles the late valerian growing out of the cracks in the stone wall beside us.  The air is fragrant with rose and night-scented stocks.
Resigned, I pull the cloth the rest of the way and drop it on the floor by the bed.  And then I look at him and wait for the consequences.
‘Thought you might like something,’ she says and, leaving the tray with us, she sways away on her swinging hips.
His eyes were unnaturally bright, which told me he was nervous.  I changed gear and then reached out to hold his hand as we careered up the Amberley road on the way home.
I pulled him tighter against me.  ‘Don’t say things like that,’ I whispered.  ‘I don’t want to think of you that way.’
I lie down across his body, taking my weight on my elbows, feel his belly and chest under me, feel him moan and undulate.  His hands skim my back, stroking tenderly.  We kiss, slowed by emotion.  I want this to last, I realise.  Forever, if I can make it.  I want it imprinted in my memory, this perfect moment when we are finally joined.  Who needs a bloody ceremony to prove they are One?  We have this.  Alone together under the sun, with a warm breeze on our skins, and the rest of our lives to share it.
‘You want to know if I know where he was going.  I don’t.  I just think he went off to discover stuff.  Find out more about the world.  Knowing Jonny, he’s thought about it a lot, planned it.  Got himself a place to live and everything.  Knowing Jonny, you won’t find him either.  He’s clever.  He’ll have worked it all out.’
‘As you said, it’s the living that counts,’ he agreed.  ‘But providing for our future would be a good idea.’
‘The sugar is on the top shelf on the second cupboard, where you left it last time you used it!’  And I put the phone down on him.
The Mumbai police were delighted that Sherlock caught the man – because Sherlock, of course, kept running, leaving me wallowing in a filthy alley, with dozens of kind, well-meaning, but non-English-speaking slum dwellers clustering round me, trying to help.
After we have lain there a while, my hands riveted to his rapidly softening member, I decide to take action, but when I get up, he moans and grabs at me.
I check my watch.  It is half past two.  Okay, better get on with it.  I’ll have to face him sooner or later anyway.  Better make it sooner and get it over with.  And I walk stiffly back along the street, hoping my erection isn’t too obvious, and trying to think about a particularly nasty anatomy lecture from my undergraduate days to distract myself.
‘You know the road to Amberley, up round the north of town?  Just before you get to the museum, there’s a bridge over the river.  Walk north from there.  You might find some travellers who could help.’
At that moment, Sherlock and Mrs Bennett come back into the house, chattering away about the amount of traffic on the A27 these days.  Josh looks at me and rolls his eyes comically, and I can’t help laughing.
I try not to groan.  After all this time, I’m still not used to the things Sherlock has deleted from his hard drive.
Then, the garden.  There would have to be an extensive and established insect-friendly flower garden, because I was not yet confident enough of my gardening skills to feel I was up to planting one from scratch.  A vegetable patch was a necessity, of course.  I had already successfully experimented with putting tomato plants in grow bags on the roof at Baker Street.  (The aubergines had not done so well, and Sherlock had snaffled all the chillis for evil experiments.)
‘There,’ I said to myself, and the brambles clustering around the fence.  ‘We’re ready for business.’
Sherlock takes out John-Matthew’s book and shows it to her.  ‘We’re trying to find the boy you sold this to,’ he says, pointing out the neatly inscribed name inside the front cover.  She starts looking worried.
‘You didn’t go to the police?’ Sherlock asked her, leaning on the counter and looking through the glass at the silver rings.
He takes the box from me.  ‘We only need one of the condoms, but we’ll use all the lube,’ he says.  ‘Do you want me to put this on you?’
‘Oh, Jesus fucking wept!’ I cry, almost leaping off the bed, but he hangs onto my hips and rides the shock out, and then starts doing unbelievable things with his epiglottis, and fuck me if Sherlock Holmes isn’t actually deep throating me!
It is a short walk back to the hotel, but we dawdle.  There are a few people about, taking evening strolls, walking their dogs before bed, making the most of the cool evening.  It is pleasant to be out, to bid passers-by a good evening, to enjoy their village by moonlight.
‘Take me, John,’ he whispers, his voice breaking a little with emotion.  ‘Paint my insides with your name, carve your love on my soul.’
Josh comes in and flops down on the sofa opposite us, beside his mother.  He eyes us sullenly from under his dark fringe.  His pout is impressive, even for a sixteen-year-old.  There is a vague air of unwashed t-shirt about him.  Oh, I remember those years fondly.
Then suddenly, he grabs my shoulders and pushes me over onto my back.  He kneels up between my legs and looks down at me.  His muscular chest heaves.  For a moment, he hesitates, and then he reaches out and tugs at the hem of my t-shirt, his eyes wrestling with mine.
The garden was still a riot of colour, despite the lateness in the season, the borders enriched by rusty heads of sedum and burnished dahlias, the delicate pink of Japanese anemones, the gaudy pink of nerenes, and a low clump of blue salvias, thick with bees.
He lies down on his back in the grass, his head circled with a halo of daisies and campion, and holds his hand out to me.  I kneel down and slide my hand up his open thigh.  So smooth.  I want to tell him how much I love him.  I want to tell him how beautiful he is, what he means to me. But there are no words for this. I understand him now, his greed for union.  He has no words either.  When I look at his face, I see his eyes are brimming.  He feels it too.  This overwhelming thing that we have, that we share.  Only death can ever part us now.  And even that won’t be for long.  For how can I live without this?  How could either of us?
‘Quite apart from the fact that we’d never get buildings insurance with your record,’ I pointed out, ‘it’s expensive to replace every time you burn the roof off, and it takes weeks too.  Possibly months.’
‘I walked up the river and sat on the bank.  It was the strangest thing.  I’ve never felt at home anywhere, at least not until I met you.  But here, I felt like I was coming home.  Like I belonged.  I’ve never belonged anywhere, except with you.  It calmed my mind.  Can you understand that?  It made me feel peaceful, this land, this chalky place.  I don’t know why.  I’ve never been able to escape from the whirl of thoughts inside my head.  It’s so frantic in here, John, it makes me feel queasy sometimes.  There’s only one thing that’s ever allowed me quiet, one place.  Here.  Here, I can actually think straight.  Perhaps that’s why I wanted to come back.  To see if I had imagined it.’
would want this.  Now it comes to it, it’s the most fantastic sensation I’ve had in years, possibly ever.  Our bellies chafe, our cocks jostle together, and it is thrilling.  His hands slide up and down my back, and he moans, deep in his throat.  He grabs a handful of my buttock and sinks those long, intelligent fingers into the muscle, and it is like being plugged into the mains.  I gasp and squirm.  He gulps at my mouth, and I at his.  Heat is blooming up through my belly.  I kick off the sheet and we writhe in the soft draft coming through the window.  I reach down and take a handful of his copious arse for myself, and he gasps and throws his head back into the pillow, exposing the length of his neck to me.
‘You’re still doing it.’  He doesn’t look up when he says it.  Granted, he is politer now than he used to be, but even so.  I look down at my lentils, little greenish rabbit droppings in a swirl of rocket and creamy yoghurt dressing on the white disc of my plate.  I push the pigeon breast about with my fork, and even that reminds me of his lower lip, the voluptuously full one, the one I want to bite and suck so badly – I’ve never kissed a woman like that, slobbering, messy, but I want to kiss him that way.  Dear God.
‘Knowledge elicitation,’ Sherlock agrees.  ‘The foundation of all enquiry into the nature of things.’
‘Yeah, like, he read all that Stephen Hawking stuff when he was about 12.  I don’t get it really, but he was really into it.  That’s why people didn’t like him much at school.  Too clever for ‘em.’
‘Keep it,’ Sherlock tells him.  ‘It’s got about fifty quid on it.  Just give them a ring sometimes, let them know you’re alright, okay?’
We stop off at the pub and lean against the bar with pints of the local treacly bitter in our hands.  Neither of us is inclined to talk much.  Our sympathy is, probably unjustly, with the absconded son.
He pulls me onto his lap.  I straddle his thighs with his arm looped around my waist, marvelling at the roughness of the hair on his thighs rubbing against mine.  Everything is so intense.  The tips of our cocks touch, and electricity arcs between, making us both shudder and gasp.  I feel dizzy with want.  He leans his head down, and kisses the knotted flesh, and I moan.  Then he starts to lick, like a tigress laving her cub, as if his saliva will miraculously heal the ravaged skin.  But we’ve had all the miracles we are going to get, I think, at least in that area.  Still, the feeling of his tongue makes my shoulders curl in, cupping him, and I hang onto his shoulder blades and let the sensations consume me.
Reading a few pages, it turns out to be nothing like I expected.  It is gentle, rather sweet, even playful, like a guidebook on playing witches for small girls, but with a slightly Buddhist spin.  There are recipes for spells, different incenses and potions, and rites for various times of the year.  It seems just about as far from what the Allens believe as it is possible to go.  There is a sticky label on the back, above the bar code.  It says: ‘Castle Magic, gifts of spirit and mystery’ and an address in the main street of Arundel.
‘You walk round one of them clubs down there and tell me who isn’t?’  He flips through the file in front of him.  ‘I can make you copies of the salient points if you really want?’
‘Thank God I never have to be 16 again,’ I say, digging into my steak.  It is rare, perfectly done for my taste.  Sherlock purses his lips as he watches me eat the bloody meat.
‘A card!  Oh, darling, you shouldn’t have!’ I said, because Sherlock doesn’t believe in cards or presents.  (It’s not because he’s mean, incidentally, it’s just that he sees them as sentimental and unnecessary.  But he still buys them for me, because he knows they matter in my head, even if they don’t in his.)
There is a cry in the night.  I open my eyes and realise it isn’t me.  Which is something of a turn-up for the books, because believe me, it’s
We both stare at him, though for different reasons.  I mean, where the hell did that come from, love?  Sherlock’s never been unsure about anything in his whole life!
‘No one’s immortal, even you, much as I would love it to be true.  Your body will die, even if the idea of you remains.  Besides, I’m in the books too.’
s me.  But not tonight.  Tonight it is the man shivering beside me, rolled up into a ball with his back to me.  And yes, we are both heterosexual men, but I do what you do when you care for somebody, regardless.  I reach out and I pull him into my arms.  That shaking body of a man.  I take him and hold him, and he tucks his head into the space between my breastbone and my jaw, and he sobs, and I coo and hush and press kisses to his dark curls until the shaking subsides and the breathing steadies, and even though my t-shirt is now soaked through and I am awake in the middle of the fucking night, I don’t care, I really don’t.
‘Your parents merely wanted us to make sure you were alive and well,’ Sherlock explains, sounding surprisingly sympathetic, so that I wonder if he is remembering having run away from home himself.
The words lay between us on the pillow, a solemn lattice of intent.  I knew what he meant, but it was a heavy burden to bear, the weight of this extraordinary man’s life on my shoulders.  To know that my end would deprive the world of him too.  A double grief.  You’d think it would be flattering, but it’s not.  I want him to go on, to continue being the vibrant, thrilling, infuriating creature that I love, but he won’t be that man without me to provide the fire in his belly.
‘I like it here,’ he says, eventually.  ‘I definitely think we should retire here.  I could keep bees.’
‘Spontaneous orgasm.  Documented side effect of certain SSRI antidepressants.  Trust me on this one.’
(The current task was digging the entire ground floor out to an additional depth of four inches so that Sherlock wouldn’t spend his retirement in a state of continual concussion.  Believe me, it was a high price to pay for his passion for oak beams.  I was convinced I would end up with mesothelioma from all the bloody dust.)
‘Do you need any help?’ she smiles decorously.   ‘We’ve got some lovely new books on Iron John which might interest you.’
I look down between us and see his cockhead, slick with precome, beautiful and glossy and pink and proud, with the foreskin retracted.   Before I know what I am doing, my hand has slipped between our bodies and wrapped around both our erections, clamping the shafts together.  Instinct takes over.  We both pump upwards, into my fist.
All that stuff I was saying about being heterosexual, being straight, not being in a relationship?  We both knew almost immediately that it was bollocks.  Yes, we are both straight.  Well, I am, and I’m pretty sure he is too.  But you know when you’ve met the love of your life, and it doesn’t have anything to do with what hangs between their legs.
‘Another night,’ he says, finally dragging out the rumpled shirt.  ‘Oh God, do you think they have an iron?’
‘Just getting a cloth to clean you up,’ I tell him gently, and though he whimpers, he lets me go.  I come back from the bathroom with a warm, wet flannel and tenderly wipe him down, leaving a sheen of water on his pale skin.  I drop the used cloth on the floor and bestow a little kiss on the tip of his cock, which twitches in response.  Then I climb back into bed with him, and fold him into my arms.
‘I want you,’ he breathes in my ear in a hot gust.  And just to seal the deal, he tips his hips up and his erection pokes my thigh.
‘Mmm.’  He stared fixedly out of the side window at the view.  I knew there was no point in trying to coax him any further.  He was in his small, frightened place.  He has these moments.  Big, noisy, vain, histrionic and above all,
We finish our tea, mulling over the unexpectedly theological turn in the conversation.  The Sherlock surprises me by pulling something out of his pocket, which he hands to the boy.  John-Matthew takes it and looks confused.
John-Matthew examines me closely with a knowing look a thousand years old.  I’ve seen that look so many times before, across the breakfast table.
I wish I could explain how much I love him.   I wish I could make him see.  I think he knows.  I’m sure he does.  He must, after all these years together.  But still.  It would be nice to tell him.  Just once.
We struggle out of our boxers, release our erections.  I thrust against him, feeling the silk of his shaft as it bumps mine.
Sherlock sulked.  For a week.  Then he decided he was willing to accept that constantly rebuilding the roof would be an intolerable frustration to his scientific schedule.
‘I didn’t.’  He looks surprised.  I go on.  ‘Not that I didn’t think about it a lot, believe me.  Living with Harry does that to you.’
What I don’t want him to see, what he will easily read in the gnarled and puckered tissue of my shoulder, is that I should not be here.  I should have died.  In fact, I did die, twice, in theatre, as they wrestled to patch the artery that had been severed.  In every technical respect, I am a dead man walking.  There is absolutely no scientific reason why I survived.  Every surgeon who worked on me has pronounced it a miracle.  And as far as I can see, there is no reason for it apart from this:
I find myself bucking my hips, grinding up against his cock, wanting something I can’t even name, straining towards a union that defies me still.  He kisses and licks and nips his way up my neck and finds my mouth again.  His hands grip my buttocks, and knead.
Sharing a bed with someone for the first time, even someone you know as well as I do Sherlock, is something of a minefield.  Especially when both of you are the same sex and also heterosexual.  And Sherlock is heterosexual, before you ask - I know that because of Irene Adler.  (But we never speak of her.)
I stare at him.  The question is now dawning on me.  I know that Sherlock never does anything unless he will be utterly perfect at it.  The thing is, you don’t learn to deep throat by reading a book.
‘It’s not dying that matters,’ I whispered into his ear, his delicate, beautiful pink ear, cupped in mahogany curls.  ‘It’s the living that counts.’
When I look again, he is grinning.  He leans forward, brushes the side of his nose against mine.  Those voluptuous lips are so close now, so tempting.
‘That’s what you say about everything.  We have to talk about it, Sherlock.’  He mimicked me, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
I told him that the difference between bravery and stupidity was a very thin line, mostly comprising of whether you survive or not.  I told him I knew this for certain because I’d seen it happen to other men on the battle field.  I knew because it happened to me.  I was lucky enough to survive it.  Most people don’t.  But I know what it really was.  Idiocy and luck.  That’s all.  Sherlock had been trying to be brave, to save us all.  He got away with it.  That didn’t mean I didn’t know exactly what he’d been doing up there on that bloody roof.  Which was, not to put too fine a point on it, being an idiot.  Still, he gave his life to save mine.  I’d have done the same.  That was why I took him back.  That and the fact that he is as elemental to me as the air I breathe.  More, perhaps.
