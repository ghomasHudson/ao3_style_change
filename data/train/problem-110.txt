“They don’t realize what they’re missing,” I said, and Holmes huffed dismissively, eyes sliding from me in a moment of brief, rare modesty. “I’m sorry I ever doubted you from the first. I feel a fool, having spent years torturing myself for nothing. I know you are no machine, Holmes. You are the best man I know. But mine was an old fear, one that would abide no reason.”
I watched, heart turning over with thrill, as Holmes's pupils dilated. I wondered if he were aware of the response, if he were truly as conscious of his bodily processes as he had proposed to me once before.
But not if I fell to hatred that would consume me. I had seen what had become of my fellow men as the fighting went on, when their souls cried for payment for the brothers they’d lost in the form of greater, more despicable violence. It had broken them. I did not think I could be more broken, but I was not willing to test fate more than it had already tested me.
“You needn’t worry, doctor,” Mycroft said. “The train conductor has been left instructions to leave seven minutes later than scheduled. Your seat is in the fourth car, it will be waiting for you when you arrive.”
“—And twenty-eight minutes to the station, give or take a few if it rains,” he hums, his voice shifting somewhat in timber, like the string of an instrument, as I focus my attention on the pulse point in his neck.
Johann stared, blue eyes wide, before nodding. "If you're certain," he said. "Then I'd be happy to."
“It is good fortune I am here then,” I said, unable to resist teasing. “And that I have experience in negotiations such as these.”
“Do not move, or I shall drink it all,” she hissed. The three of us froze. “I won’t be taken to your English prison. I will not!”
“Mmm,” Holmes agreed. “The recent rain has preserved the tracks in the mud. See how the horses were forced to dig into the mud to gain traction.” He pointed to where handfuls of loam had been kicked from the earth in piles near muddied hoof-tracks.
"We have just established, my dear fellow, that you can be a fool on occasion," I said gently. Holmes just looked at me, eyes glittering. "I know my own heart. Even before you appeared in my clinic alive and shocked me out of my wits, you owned it."
“Precisely, Watson. Judging from the stress lines and dark circles on the man's face, his creased clothing, and the slight tremor in his hands, I don't believe he has slept in some time. All signs point to him being a victim in this. But you’ve not heard the most crucial element.”
I’ll tell you, gov! Last night, I was on the train heading home and along came some ridiculous ticket inspector, who started arguing my ticket was invalid! He made me and all the other passengers
I craned my neck to see what had seized his attention, and watched him sweep forward towards the telegram sitting alone on a desk beside the door.
Before the kiss could deepen and those nimble hands could drive me to carelessness, I pull away with a short chuckle. “I must wash up. I believe we need to be at the station by eight, and I don't intend to be late.”
“I had to practically carry you inside,” I snapped, irritated to be making the same point I’d already hammered to ground several times over.
“Eavesdropping? If he is not responsible for Peter’s disappearance then—” I rubbed my hand with my jaw. “By Jove. He is searching for Peter too. He knows his lover is missing and seeks to find him.”
“We could hardly deny a request from such a charming client,” I added, exhaustion spiriting much of the volume from my voice. “Young Fred was most adamant that we locate you.” At prodding, I unbuttoned my vest and shirt, easing my shoulder out for Holmes to treat with little thought to modesty. Pain, like liquor, had an effect of making me care little for offending the sensibilities of others.
“But you have your suspicions,” I cajoled, mouth twitching in a smile. “You always do, and you’re nearly always right.”
I had not laid eyes upon Holmes in twenty minutes, and it was a length of time that was beginning to seem conspicuous. Idly, I wondered whether it was possible he was plotting escape.
“Gentlemen,” Holmes said. His voice betrayed nothing of his concern as he turned on a prim heel, carefully setting the silk ring down upon the tea table. “Watson and I have much to do, and must discuss this case amongst ourselves. Wiggins, if you would kindly escort Fred home and bring back those letters he found?” He reached for a spare shilling on the mantle, palming it to the older boy.
“And as always, I appreciate your concern, my dear fellow.” He ticked a dark eyebrow. “But I must insist on the mobile lab. It took a great deal of time to acquire a trunk that would organize my materials without rattling my phials with every bump in the road, and I would not see my efforts wasted.” As I opened my mouth, his face turned conciliatory. “Come now, Watson. Three weeks without stimulation and you shall
Then, he was gone, and Anna Coram was pulling a second book down alongside the first, a second mechanism that no doubt served to lock my friend and Hopkins inside. My heart turned to stone, and adrenaline replaced the ache in my blood. I felt a soldier’s steel pour into me, for now that Holmes was safe, I needed only survive.
this holiday." Mycroft opened his mouth, but I cut across him. "And as his doctor, I insist upon it. Another stressful case without respite could damage his health irreparably.”
With that, the boys trotted out of the sitting room and left us alone. An invisible hand took hold of my heart in my ribcage, squeezing ruthlessly.
“Such a shame that my work was interrupted this way, by such a tragedy,” Professor Coram said, voice thick with fatigue and regret. “Who could have foreseen it? And that such a catastrophe should have come to such an estimable young man…” He shook his head. “After some proper training he was an admirable assistant. Smart and hard-working, and detail minded. Could read my handwriting as well as myself, too, which was no easy task.” He craned his head at Holmes, brows coming together to form a troubled, whiskery mountain range. “Tell me, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of it? Have you any idea how my assistant came to such a fate? How such a blackguard could have entered my house and left it with barely a trace of himself?”
“I am…better than I was last night,” she offered timidly. She dropped her chin, thin hands wrapped round herself. “It was quite a shock, to find Mr. Smith in such a state, and to watch him…” Her voice went thin, like paper submerged in water, but she recovered herself admirably, looking back up to me. “Thank you for your concern.” She held my eyes for a moment, saying nothing more, and I blinked when Holmes suddenly cleared his throat.
"I will ask about him," Ms. Tarlton said generously. "He was not feeling well after the inspector spoke to him and complained of pain, but perhaps a doctor as experienced as yourself could offer some him solace, now that the rain has stopped."
Time has taught me the solace of writing. Before Holmes—before the war even—whenever my heart was plagued with anxieties, I had found comfort in the recording of my thoughts. I seek its balmy reprieve now, in the low-lit silence of my bedroom. Even Holmes, sense and God willing, will not be awake at this hour, and I would not disturb him with my weakness for a decade’s pension.
I thought. Permeated to my bones with happiness, I found I no longer possessed the faculty to express it, and wordlessly I took his hand and pressed his knuckles to my lips.
“Inspector, if you could watch Mrs. Marker for but a moment,” said Holmes, moving to his feet. “Watson and I must check something within the household.” Bewildered but certain my friend had landed upon something if the housekeeper’s reaction was any indicator, I followed him out of the woman’s humble kitchen into her personal bedroom. Looking under the bed and within the woman’s cabinets, Holmes searched the room thoroughly before coming upon her bureau, opening the doors, and crying out in victory.
“We appreciate whatever information you can offer us about last night’s events, Ms. Tarlton,” said Holmes, and there was a sharpness to his attention on her that gave me pause. Perhaps he did not trust everything she’d given in her statement to Hopkins? I looked to the girl and saw only an earnest, fragile young woman, but as a man who’d loved a brilliant woman and who’d encountered many more, I knew better than to underestimate the fairer sex at any glance.
It was small and smudged, charred at the edges. A cornerpiece of letter paper, by the look of it. I didn’t recall seeing Holmes burning anything the day we left. I certainly hadn’t. Gingerly, I found myself limping over to Holmes’s work desk. Scrounging a lighter from my pocket, I lit the well-used votives on Holmes’s desk to examine the paper scrap. Thick stock, I noticed wearily, exhausted mind struggling to employ the methods Holmes had drilled in me. Cream color. More expensive than the usual cornerstore lot, but not embossed or ostentatious like that of an aristocrat’s. Professional paper, then, from an upper-class businessman.
“And able to make a fair deal on your invention,” Holmes hummed. “What would a good price have been, for this revolutionary machine of yours?”
“Please, Watson,” Holmes said. I blinked at the sound of that word in his voice, struck by its sudden and intense fragility. “If there is a chance that I have…” His eyes bored into mine. “Tell me what you meant.”
I blinked. “…I’m at your service, Holmes,” I said, becoming suddenly aware of how surreal a conversation we were headed towards. “I will answer anything within my knowledge.”
“I had the advantage of him,” Holmes said woodenly. “I knocked him into the water and liberated Hopkins’s gun from his belt. I fired two bullets into his legs to keep him from escaping while I reached for you but...” Blood departed Holmes’s face, and all volume left his voice. “...I confess, Watson. I also shot him because I wanted to.”
“Thank you, Mr. ‘Olmes,” Fred whispered, as Holmes stiffened. Slowly, as if through concentration of will, Holmes relaxed, and gingerly reached out a hand to pat the boy once, perfunctory, on the head.
“You engaged them,” Holmes said. “And clearly emerged the victor.” He offered a weak, if proud, smile, which at any other time would have rendered me warm with joy.
I slowly spread my hands, surrendering. “What do you want of me, Holmes?” I asked. “How can I satisfy you?”
“You saved me, then,” I said, speaking slowly so as not to tax my tenderized throat. “I knew you would. Didn’t doubt it for a moment. I assume you caught my kidnappers as well?”
Holmes’s blush faded as his face twisted dourly. “It is a side effect of my affliction for you that I care little to hear of your previous entanglements, Watson. That
“Four exclusive contracts,” I repeated, shaking my head in disbelief as Holmes aided me into the cab with a bent arm. “Ambitious fellow, isn’t he?”
Inclining Watson’s pale, clammy head back, I leaned in and pinched his nose, so any oxygen I gave him would go nowhere but his lungs. Then, quickly, I sealed my mouth over his and exhaled, breathing in through my nose, exhaled, again, again, feeling his chest rise beneath me.
The admission, so new and so earnest, sends my pulse to thrum, rushing warmth through my veins. “The feeling is quite mutual, my dear Holmes,” I say softly. The corner of his mouth curls in a fond smile, and carefully I slide a hand beneath his proud chin and tip up his face to mine. I press my lips to his, wondering not for the last time over their profound smoothness, and I smile against his mouth when his own hands tentatively reach for me.
“Missing train?” said the man, his ire retreating somewhat. “Aye, I heard it disappeared or something like it. Nonsense, I say, probably just took a wrong turn at a rail switch. Besides, it don’t concern me anyhow—me and my mates, we would have got off before London. And our tickets were valid, no doubt about it! And to top it all, the inspector gave everyone the boot—everyone but a cab of rich.” The man sneered. “Cuz o’course, their type don’t
I thought, my hatred jagged at its edges. It would have been exact justice had he fainted in agony and drowned, unable to lift himself from the same watery grave he had tried to deliver Watson into. I still had half a mind to finish the job, but no force on earth could have compelled me to release Watson from my grip, not even revenge.
“Five minutes to freshen up,” he says in my ear. Elegant fingers move to card idly through my hair. “Another five to dress. Twenty for tea and breakfast, else you’ll be unreasonable the entire morning—”
“I didn’t bother to look,” Holmes confessed, and that set us off on another round again, and by the end of it tears were streaming down my face and my throat was on fire, my head pounding at brutal tempo. My schoolboy snickering devolved in coughing, and the humor slid reluctantly from my friend’s face.
“I am not,” Holmes said, lifting an eyebrow, and I huffed, withdrawing my hand as an increasingly familiar heat welled in my chest.
Holmes was still staring intensely at me, but at my words, a tension had been released in his shoulders, and his bearing seemed the closest to normal it had been all evening.
We crossed the threshold of the bridge, jolting as wheels rolled from dirt to stone, and I took my chance. In the moment where the two of us jerked in our seats, I grabbed Anna by the wrist and jerked the barrel outwards. There was the thunderous blast of gunfire as she pulled the trigger, deafening me, and through the roaring in my ears I heard an unholy shrieking and suddenly, the world shook, rumbled, and tilted on its axis. I briefly experienced the sensation of falling, blinding cold, and then, in an ocean of numbness, nothing but darkness closing in.
"A drink, Watson?" he asked, carding a hand through his mussed hair, and I blinked in surprise. Holmes rarely, if ever, indulged in alcohol in the midst of a case. As a depressant, it maintained an effect opposite to that which he pursued in the thin metal of the needle. Perplexed, I watched as he began to pour the both of us two fingers of brandy. Hoping a third and final drink for the evening would dampen the queer skittishness of my nerves, I accepted the glass from Holmes as he stepped close, fortifying a smile.
“I anticipated my brother’s stubborn nature would make an appearance,” Mycroft explained. He lifted an eyebrow as Holmes swept off towards his room, before returning his gaze to mine. “In the future, I shall be more mindful of yours.” I bit my cheek, trying not to smile with minor pride, and Mycroft proffered a small smile of his own. “Take care of my brother, Doctor Watson. Do see he eats properly. He looks thin.”
“Shared interests is a good deal of it,” I say, bending down. “The rest is well within order.” To make the point, I kiss him lightly. Carefully, I press him backwards, guiding him supine against my bed sheets, and then make another. “I love you.”
“Good heavens. He must have swallowed half a distillery.” I coughed a bit on the rank stink of malt liquor emanating from the man’s uniform. His breath seemed to curl the very hairs in my nose.
I made a concentrated effort not to think of Holmes in a maid’s frock. I failed considerably. His eyes glowed with the thrill of the chase as he leaned closer, and the room around me grew uncomfortably hotter.
“I understand. We can speak no more of it, if it is a cause of discomfort. But I’m afraid, knowing this truth about you, that I may be unable to avoid asking you some questions.”
“I’ll fetch the bags,” I said, and grimacing, rolled my shoulders in preparation. “...And your blasted trunk.”
“You are…you are being cruel, Holmes,” I said. “This is below you. You cannot seriously blame my stories for Smith’s death.”
“Thank you, Holmes,” I said quietly, feeling strangely unwilling to breach the silence of our rooms with a loud tone of voice. “Won’t you tell me what you’ve learned, now?”
“I don’t understand,” I heard, and turned to see the old station master gawking down the tracks with disbelief. “The train...it’s gone!”
The two of us quickly moved where we’d been directed, past a small iron gate sectioning off a walled area just left of the train tracks. What we found, however, was surprising enough to draw me to stare.
My hands slide down the pale stay of his neck. “Is there?” I murmur, smiling against his skin as my mouth crept to the corner of his, trailing down his chin to his jaw. Slowly, his fingers curl in the fabric of my sleep shirt, encouraging me downward over him.
I found myself scowling, and Holmes’s attention on my hands grew seemingly placating. “I will be fine.”
“I must have misplaced it when I tried to send a message earlier—which I was prevented from doing! Blasted little upstart!” The man hollered the last towards the ticket office, where from behind the window, young Master Bertram cringed.
"Forgive my impertinence, my good man," Holmes began, as Johann retrieved two crystal glasses from below. "But I have recently returned from abroad and your accent is incredibly familiar to me. I don't suppose your family hails from the Scandinavian regions? Norway, perhaps?"
"Wiggins always has at least one of his associates posted in front of Barnes’s Books, in case their services are required. I've requested a meeting, and he should receive the message as fast as a young lad can run."
“Regardless,” he said quietly, almost too quiet to hear. “I cannot say with certainty that I will be after you’ve gone. But that is my burden to bear.”
“Peter Ables is a fellow female impersonator at the Circle, Watson. It explains why you never recognized him, and did not remember his name from your time there.”
From his pocket, Hopkins drew a small paper packet. He unfolded it and disclosed a golden pince-nez, with two broken ends of black silk cord dangling from the end of it.
“I would see justice done,” Holmes said coolly, voice firm. “But within the natural boundaries of the law.”
“We will require your home address, in case we need to reach you and search your home for evidence of your brother’s location,” Holmes said, and Fred nodded eagerly, rattling it off at rapid speed. I scrawled it down in my notebook, below the name of Peter’s place of work. “But for now, we will visit your brother’s place of work to interview his colleagues.”
Holmes sighed heavily, settling back in his chair with the satisfied relaxation of an interesting case solved and explained to completion. I bit the inside of my cheek, hesitant to disturb the repose that had finally embraced my tired friend. But I had to know the full truth.
“Concern?” the man said. He threw his arms in the air with a great drama, evidently gratified to be listened to even as his green eyes burned with anger. “My
At the silence that met her, Mrs. Marker looked up through her fingers and shrunk in her seat like dying flower. “No, no, I cannot,” she said, sobbing quite pitifully now. “Please, Mr. Holmes. I could not, I could not!”
“We need more information,” Holmes said, visibly eager. “This case is much broader than it appears at first glance. And I believe I spy a man who may be able to grant clarity into some of its depths.” He inclined his head, and I turned mine to follow the angle of his gaze elsewhere in the waiting room, where a plump, eccentric-dressed man sat on a bench, his face layered with displeasure.
In further testament to his good spirits, Holmes issued another low chuckle. “I suppose we can’t have that,” he said. “Very well. I agree to your terms, but only if you are ready to leave in no less than seven minutes, Watson. Your time starts now.”
Harrumphing, I did so, and frowned over the last lines of the document. “It says here that the loss or destruction of the prototype is only insured for up to fifty percent of its value. Still, Holmes, that’s a sizable sum.”
“It’s the letter.” My voice was hollowed out with disbelief. “Willoughby Smith. The letter he sent before he was killed. It came with the morning’s post.”
An appreciative gaze met mine, lighting a small warmth in my chest. “And what would such knowledge imply, my dear Watson?”
Coram’s face was cold, but the laughter that emerged from around his cigarette was far colder, ringing alarms deep in my marrow. “I see,” he said. “I see. You are mad, sir. I helped her to escape, you say? Then, where, pray, is she now?”
“You’ve quite the physician on your hands, brother,” Mycroft said slowly, and he sighed. “I suppose I should be thankful there is at least
air its patrons desired. The walls were lined in thick velvet curtains, which could be drawn over any seated alcove for privacy, and the place could practically be split in twain as the night went on, as the women took to the high stools at the right and the men took over the other side. The Circle was one of the fewer bars of its kind to allow women and I thought it just so too: the bar, dance floor, and stage were neutral areas no matter how very cliqueish the members were, and a few bouncers—also men and two particularly intimidating ladies—kept the peace better than any hired hand I'd seen.
"Yes, sir, my husband and I, we worked and lived here with the previous owners, oh, for nearly fifteen years before that. Lovely family. The master worked for the government 'til he was offered a position abroad. I had familiar experience with the upkeep of the place, and I was so opposed to leaving the house in which I'd lived all these years with my Harry, the good Professor offered to keep me on."
the train! Like we all were some fare-skimmers using old tickets! I never been so insulted in my life!”
“I apologize, my good sir, for our rudeness,” Holmes said, striding in with the lordly confidence that never failed to make me warm beneath my suit collar. “But you see, I told you I would return to you with news, and so I have.”
Like a slow-moving glacier, chill crept over Holmes’s face and into his voice. “See for yourself,” he said quietly, handing it off to me. Disturbed by his tone, I took it, and began quickly to read.
“I—no,” Ms. Tarlton said, cheeks a proper shade of red now, and I offered her a rueful smile on my friend’s behalf. Her eyes brightened, then, and she blinked. “Oh! Oh, but I do recall he left the manor briefly a few days ago. He sent a letter through the post, I remember he had mentioned the increasing price of stamps.”
Brow wrinkling, I opened my mouth to pursue that line of inquiry, but Holmes stood rapidly. “Now, I must prepare. Finish your meal, Watson. I’ve eaten all I could.” I frowned at the nibbled lunch upon his plate, but before I could protest he had disappeared into his bedroom with the packages he had bought earlier, and I was left to sit and marinate in my increasing anxiety.
“A report which will find its way into the hands of your superiors,” I added, crossing my arms with authority. “And I doubt you will emerge with your position intact, especially as an entire train disappeared on your watch!”
And with that, I left Baker Street for Ratcliffe, my heart hollow with dread and my pistol burning a hole in my coat.
There, limp on the wet cobblestones, lay Holmes. His slack face, a white crescent in the moonlight, was smeared with blood. Above him, their fists wrapped around thin wooden staffs, stood two figures, their shadowy backs to me.
had been too late. Heart twisting my chest, I read on as Smith introduced himself, explained his recent employment under Nicholas Coram, and began to detail peculiar circumstances that he’d been experiencing since his hiring.
The Professor scoffed, humorless and cruel. “You mean to say that I could lie upon that bed and not be aware that a woman had entered my room?” he asked, jeering. He exhaled smoke from his nose, a dragon in the dim bedroom light.
Holmes leaned in. “There was actually a point in my sojourn where I lived as a maid in Berlin for three months,” he said, low and cavalier. “It was actually quite amenable to my lifestyle, and even more so for the purposes of ensnaring one of Moriarty’s lieutenants. The man was woefully paranoid of everyone but his servants, and it was all too easy to lead the police to his door after he let enough slip in my earshot. There is so much whispered in front of those society seeks to ignore, Watson.”
Watson,” Holmes chided. “Merely acknowledge the possibilities. And do read the thing in its entirety.”
Fred looked despairing. "No, no, he's too busy lookin' after me to be courtin' any lass or to be havin’...uh-quaint-nances. He says it's his duty 'n pr-privilege but..." Fred sniffed. "But I know he sometimes wish he didna have to.  But he wouldna leave me, I know it!"
“A long commute for a man to trek in the night hours, the Strand to the East End,” Holmes commented. He puffed experimentally around his pipe. “But worth it, I assume, to work in a safer neighborhood?”
I could feel myself edging towards a despair that I could not bear to fall into. Shaking my head, I leaned close to him, hand leaving his to slide, with greatest care, against his cheek. I did not care for where we were or who could see. I merely needed to hold him, as best as I could, because against reason my heart was petrified still that he would slip through my fingers, haunted by a pain it had known for years and could not withstand again.
“That end may come faster than you think, Mrs. Coram,” I said. Pride in Holmes made me bold, bolstering my voice with righteous belief. “It often does, to people who underestimate him.”
All three heads in the room swiveled to Holmes, who was puffing at his pipe with energy. “No leads, no evidence of foul play but for the manner of his disappearance, and no crime scene to examine,” he muttered, and I turned my head to give him a look that said clearly,
“Why—why on Earth would you think…” I trailed off, disbelieving. I had never encountered such a mistake in Holmes’s reasoning before this moment.
“I do not ask you to betray your employer, madam,” he said emotionlessly. “But I’m obligated to inform you it will be the only thing to save you from the noose.”
But what would I do with it all? His treatises, his writings, those I could not part with, but could I even stomach to read them? Maybe eventually I would have the strength to decrypt his handwriting again, but at that moment, I did not trust myself not to ruin his scattered journals with salt water. His maps I would keep: they were useful and moreover, some were sentimental. His pipes? I gripped the one in my hand. No, they would remain, as would that blasted Persian slipper. His books? Maybe some of them, some I felt would be better used by scholars in a university library. His disguises? What the devil I could do with them, I couldn’t say. I fought a creaky laugh at the idea of giving them to Lestrade for undercover bobbies, and wheezed a little harder at the idea of a plainclothesman in a bar wearing one of Holmes’s preposterous sailor outfits. Good Lord, we had a priest’s vestment somewhere...
“It must have stopped somewhere here,” the station master said, leading us through the misty night. The grass beneath our feet was black-green, wet with dew, and pebbled mud lined the edges of the rails. “Without braking, it should have blown right through, but—”
“I say,” he snapped, his bearded face flooding red with anger. “Your manners leave something to be desired, gentlemen!”
But I would, because Holmes was as silent as the grave beside me, and I could not stomach yet another weight upon his shoulders for the business at Old Yoxley Place.
. I wanted to say everything I hadn’t. I wanted to beg forgiveness, for not having been clever enough to save him in time. For not having
“My older sister is lookin’ after im,” Wiggins informed us. “She’s a maid and had a little work for ‘im to do, in exchange for some proper food til ‘is brother turns up.”
“Excellent.” Holmes shifted in the wintry breeze, gathering himself protectively into his charcoal overcoat. “Then we must start with the train itself. Can you give us any details about it?”
Holmes scrunched his nose, possibly unconsciously. “Do you refer to those pet-names couples award each other?” His mouth twisted in reluctance. “I suppose if you required me…”
“There is only the physical left, Holmes,” I said, and nerves skittered like butterflies beneath my skin.
“Fool man,” I choked out, voice broken, hand spasming around the pipe like a talisman. He would have. It was very likely the truth of it, and its reality cleaved into me, more efficient and debilitating than a fallen axe. He would have. For all that Holmes did not say, for all that I didn’t express myself: Holmes would have done it. He would have faced that villain, that
That had an equally simple answer. "I cared for you deeply long before I loved you, Holmes. I do not need what you cannot give, when your friendship has long been enough for me."
The complaint, which had been seemingly aired to the entire waiting room at large, did not go unheard by my friend. Perking up like a collier, my friend alighted to the side of the irritated customer, who was standing beside a parcel of luggage with a foul expression of indigence on his face.
Holmes opened his mouth, but wretchedly, said nothing. After a moment, his expression gripped with sorrow, he said, “There is no one else.”
Holmes was on his feet, sweeping about for his coat, hat, and walking-stick. “I’ll not have you complaining of fatigue this evening, I require you at your most energized! This case could prove dangerous, and I’ll have you in no other state. You can be so terribly cantankerous, when underfed and ill-rested.”
For those few agonizing seconds, Holmes held my gaze, eyes fixed and steady upon my face. But as the shadow of the door passed over his features, sealing him away into darkness, his cold mask splintered. On the face of my dearest friend, I saw a fearfulness that would haunt me for the rest of my living days.
mind, Watson, requires stimulation like my lungs require oxygen, and my experiments and archival research will be as gentle exercise is to overtaxed muscles. A doctor such as yourself could call it restorative.” This time, it was he who ignored me as I scoffed. “In the least, it will give me something to do on this...
“Reginald the bee lover,” I said, echoing his earlier description of the man who had offered us guest lodgings at his Staffordshire estate. “He has hives, then?”
“Errors indeed,” I said, surprised. “The meaning’s clear enough, but it reads like a man asleep at the prompter!”
"Why, I believe it was easier for Mr. Smith to work. His room was directly next to the Professor's study, where the Professor keeps his journals and notes which were his job to transcribe."
“After I’ve—” My voice broke off, and a frightening thought took hold of me, plunging me into anxiety.
support me, if this went the way I feared most. I would survive, I told myself. I would survive, even if my heart did not.
Like most of Holmes’s acute observations, such a point was obvious once underlined. “So a sudden crime, then? Unanticipated?” Hopkins pressed, as we followed Holmes’s long, energetic strides towards the manor some hundred yards ahead. It was an austere thing, old brown stone and somewhat dour architecture on a cleared, slate green plain.
“Goin’ on eight or so months now,” said Quincey. “Business brought me to this island country of yours and will keep me here until the end of the year, at the least. Took me a couple of weeks to learn about this place. Helluva attitude your government has towards pubs like these, Doctor.”
Holmes lifted a roguish brow, and at any other time I might have cracked a smile. “You doubt my skills, Watson?” I crossed my arms, scowling at him, and he sighed. “Yes, yes, you have my word, my dear fellow. I will be the soul of subtlety. Understand I have no wish to draw the spotlight upon
“We should make for the back-door!” I cried, over the roar of gunfire. “They’ll have no choice but to be forced back, and I don’t want to be between them and escape when they do!” Johann nodded sharply, and the two of us, as the bullets lulled and men reloaded, sprinted for the exit.
"The imperative of my work, my dear fellow, never wanes, nor should it," said Holmes. My expression must have been something to behold, for Holmes succumbed to an exceptional wince. "But I apologize regardless, for having roused you so rudely. Please, allow me to call Mrs. Hudson for tea."
"Ties to home can often be the most potent," Holmes mused sympathetically, convincing enough one could almost believe he was a man who enjoyed small, trite conversation. "What ties brought you here to England, my good man?"
“A letter?” Holmes leaned forward. “Did he mention to whom he might have been writing? Family, perhaps, or school friends?”
“I shall aspire to provide,” Holmes said, dipping his head enough I could feel the heat of his skin radiate against mine. Chin tilting upward, mouth parting for his, the sudden sound of footsteps had the both of us pivoting on our heels towards the sitting room.
I closed my eyes, fingers curling around the pipe with trembling care. My heart yawned and swelled, seizing between my lungs. The world tilted around me, pressing in too close and unsteadying my knees, and I threw out an arm to catch myself on the mantelpiece, fingernails carving into the wood as my leg gave out. I clutched the pipe to my chest with my free hand, face twisting in pain.
Mr. Robinson suddenly looked as if he were edging towards a fit, his complexion flaring a deep red. “For God’s sake, sir, it’s priceless! They’re lucky I was willing to part with it for the price we agreed upon! It could change the very world we live in!” The man sighed in a heavy gust, and his spine stiffened as he composed himself. “But I’m a humanitarian, you see. I was willing to give it up for sale for a decent price, so the world could make use of what I’d created.”
Taken by surprise, he shouted as I barreled my full weight into him. His back struck the ground and I heard the oxygen wheeze from his lungs, the rattle of his stick scattering away across the cobblestones. I reeled back from atop him, launching my fist against his jaw. His neck snapped to the right, eyes popping wide, and without hesitation, I leveled another, slamming the bleeding knuckles of my left hand into his other cheek. His head jerked and I saw the whites of his eyes as they rolled backwards, and the man went boneless beneath me.
"I imagine the people whose homes he burned would disagree," I said dryly, reaching for the already-perused morning paper lying across my side-table.
"Because of—because of what I confided in you this morning?" I said, voice faint with disbelief. "Because of the case?"
Holmes did not respond, remaining as still as a statue as I reached for my hat, and it was only when I moved towards the door that he finally spoke.
“Good,” Coram said. “Inspector—my wife, the Doctor, and I will be taking that carriage you offered. Thank you, gentlemen, for your patience. We appreciate your dedication, but I’m afraid our time here together must end.” His voice went black as pitch. “
“Two young gentlemen to see you, Mr. Holmes,” she said, and the unmistakable note of fondness of her tone made all too certain a near-future of fresh pastries. Stepping aside to allow our house guests entry, I saw precisely why her motherly instincts had been roused.
“Thank you, sir,” Holmes said, with genuine enthusiasm. “You’ve been most helpful.” He looked to me, his pale cheeks flushed a fetching pink in the cold. “Come, Watson.”
willing to tend to your health.” Like a heavy sail in wind, he leaned back on his heels, grip twisting on his walking stick. “I concede to your duty of care, Doctor. The investigation can indeed proceed without my brother.” His flinty eyes narrowed. “For a few weeks, at least.”
At the sight of his back, my heart leapt to my throat in sudden despair. “Holmes,” I choked out, against every shred of wisdom. My nerves quailed as Holmes stilled, hesitating where he stood.
Holmes spun on a heel, but almost as if he had been frozen in time, he stopped mid-circle, knee bent. “Curious.”
“Let us attempt to locate this “special” passenger,” Holmes said, waiting patiently for me as I climbed from the cab, retrieved my cane, and paid our driver.
Mrs. Hudson entered with more tea, setting it down on the table before me, and I prepared the young inspector a cuppa as he continued to speak. “His work consisted in writing all the morning to the Professor’s dictation, and he usually spent the evening hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next day’s work. He would also transcribe the man’s notes, for his eyesight is failing in his age. Now, this Willoughby Smith has nothing against him in character or history, neither as a boy at Uppingham or a young man at Cambridge—I have seen his testimonials, and from the first he was a decent, quiet, hardworking fellow, no weak spot in him at all.” Hopkins sighed heavily. “And yet this is the lad who met his death early this morning in the Professor’s study, under circumstances which can point only to murder.”
“Ah.” I did so, and began to read. “It appears to be…a diary entry, of sorts, not a letter. He’s writing about his experiences at the Circle.” When the first was written, Peter Ables seemed to be a new member: his writing was enthused as he recorded his joy and gratefulness in finding such a place where he could meet others like himself. I moved to the next page, and found something more interesting, and distinctly more private. “Hmm. It appears that Mr. Ables had fancied someone he met at the Circle.” I moved to the next letter, and soon felt the tips of my ears heat. “Ah. The feeling was…quite mutual, it seems.”
He gasped for oxygen against the biological imperative to rid himself of the liquid in his body, and his bloodless lips frightened me. I struck him hard once, twice on the back, and he sputtered the last of it out. Then, as he sucked in great lungfuls of air, I took his precious face in my hands.
“The repair room—” I started, frowning, and he ignored me in favor of hustling us onward—with consideration to my cane, which I found myself relying on the moment we stepped outside of the station house into what had graduated from winter breeze to full-bellied gale. The world had darkened dramatically since we’d arrived to Chesterfield, the sky a stirring cauldron of dark grey and green clouds, and my clothes were plastered to my body in a wind that tugged at our scarves like invisible anchor-chain. Moving down the turnstile, thunder muttered in the distance as Holmes reached out to throw open the repair room’s barn doors.
My chuckle was but a hair too loud. “No, my friend. I’m afraid you know all of me there is to know.”
“I—I believe so, yes,” Mrs. Marker said, and indeed, she looked decisively cornered. “I do think he was at one point, Mr. Holmes, but before my service to him. She passed away, oh, goodness, I believe it was a decade ago now? He—he does not speak of it readily, sir.” She attempted to soak up the spilled tea with a fetched terry cloth, but in her haste only managed to spread it about. “Pray, sir, why do you ask?”
“I see,” Holmes said, frowning. “But you are…still an active member? Your ring, it still stands as a sign of valid entry?”
"Yes," I said coldly. "There were none such as yourself in sight. I did what was necessary to protect my friend."
"It's been a very productive evening, Watson," said he, with visible relish. Carefully, he began to peel away the false facial hair clinging to his face. "This case runs deeper than I had imagined."
In an instant, the world around me snapped into clarity. The heat which stirred my blood fled, leaving me cold, and I found myself drawing away from the atmospheric warmth of Holmes's body, mouth bone dry.
“It’s very rough, of course, and only deals with the essential points. The rest, I’m certain, you will see later for yourself. Now, first of all, presuming that the assassin entered the house, how did they come in? Undoubtedly by the garden path from the front gate, of course, but either way, they had to, somehow, enter either the front or the back door—both of which were locked. The back door is the likelier candidate, from which there is direct access to the study where the murderer might have gotten the murder weapon, and the victim’s adjoining bedroom. Any other way would have been exceedingly complicated and unlikely. As for the trail itself, the escape through the window should have left an easy enough path to detect, correct? It had been raining that night, and the ground was saturated and certainly would have shown footmarks.” Hopkins pressed his lips together, his brow knitted together in seriousness. “But my examination showed me that I was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal. No distinct footmarks were to be found on any path, coming or going.”
My hands dug into the meat of my thighs. My bad leg hollered at the treatment, but the pain was bright and noisy and sharpened the slurry of my vision into stark, awful clarity.
“I’ve got a mountain of work to do at the surgery, Holmes,” I said unhappily, stepping out into the shadowy London evening. The night was chilly and wet after a short downpour, and the cobblestone streets were lined with glittering, puddled streaks of reflected gaslight. “I won’t be home until quite late. If you’re asleep by then, I suppose I’ll see you in the morning.”
“Mornin’, Mr. ‘Olmes,” said young Wiggins, looking as rumpled and cocksure as ever. It had been years since I first met the lad, and he had sprouted up like a weed, freckled and mop-haired. Soon he’d be too tall for the threadbare clothes on his body, and idly I wondered whether any of Holmes’s castoffs would suit the boy. “I got your message, and I took t’liberty of guessin’ why you might've wanted a meeting.” Holmes lifted an eyebrow, inclining his head, and Wiggins nudged the fellow at his side with a gentle elbow. “G’won then, Fred.”
“I see,” said Holmes. “I have then only one question for you, sir.  What do you imagine were the meaning of Mr. Smith’s final words?” My friend took a long draught from his cigarette, face unreadable through the smoke that curled languidly from his mouth.
“It would certainly explain a few things,” I deadpanned, and Holmes scoffed, turning towards the storm front as if to physically ignore me. My face split into a grin at his expense. “And it’s perfectly paranoid. You’re truly afraid of being lost in the countryside?”
Holmes turned his face away, his cinereal eyes scanning the hallway from the open door. "Nothing of relevance," replied Holmes easily. Contrary to his tone, there was a stiffness to his expression that caused me to wonder. Did he question the professor's supposed wellness after his interrogation by police? Feeling the same ache in my shoulder from that damned Jezail bullet, I was all too familiar with the discomfort rain and cold could bring old injuries. Perhaps Holmes was merely reacting to the maid's chipper nature; my friend was positively arctic  in the presence of most women for reasons I can barely comprehend and scarcely approve. (The Woman is an outlier and exception to his general avoidance of the fairer sex: her influence, I believe, has been key for his giving credence where it was due to the capabilities and strengths of women, but it has been a slow process over time—and I confess I cannot see my dear friend spending substantial time with ladies of his own free will outside the boundaries of a case any time soon.)
“A heavy load, then,” I surmised. “Perhaps the rail company came to look at the scene of the crime, see what left there was to salvage? Maybe it was why the warehouse was disassembled—after the theft, what was left of it was needed for construction elsewhere.”
By the time we arrived in the right neighborhood a half hour later, the London streets were dark and animated with streams of nightgoers, a mixture of working and upper class, young and old coming alive to seek entertainment or survive in the seedier allies of Ratcliffe. To prosper, clubs like the Circle were confined to areas such as these, where working girls stood sentinel at every street corner; the community flourished best where shadows were wanted, and where bureaucracy turned its blinder eye.
So I fiddled with things by way of plot but not in any super apparent way to players of the game. I also decided to directly address the random racism that was put in the game with disapproval from Holmes and Watson (rather than just erasing it from the narrative), because while it's period typical for the time that doesn't mean characters can't react to it with morality.
that I could ever have doubted Holmes like I did. I felt thrilled, to be seen and known and not cast aside, to be
Holmes’s arm shifted and I watched his other hand search his breast pocket and retrieve a handkerchief. Promptly, he began to dab the cloth to his lips, wiping away color and leaving a smudge of pink on the ivory. The sight of it tugged at something within me, curling a hook around my diaphragm. Clenching my jaw, I raised an arm and hollered for a cab a tad louder than was necessary. My voice blasted its way through the crowd and secured us a ride, and as the two of us climbed in and Holmes's arm dropped mine, I ignored the feeling that something nameless and vital had just slipped through my fingers.
“I see,” Holmes said, as I furiously took notes. A missing Chilean director’s board and a unique electrical prototype. Things were beginning to take shape, I thought, but I could see nothing the clearer for it.
“It is a stroke of true luck, my dear fellow,” Holmes said, grey eyes glittering. “See for yourself.” He reached into his jacket and extended the paper to me, which I unfolded without delay.
“Perhaps if your stories were more precise, he’d never have attempted such foolishness.” My mouth dropped open at the barb, as if I had been struck. Holmes barreled on, steely eyes blank, mouth a cruel twist of distaste. “But then, your tales were never about the truth. My work, the true science of it, has been rendered the jumping point for romantic sixpenny tripe. You’ve witnessed the downsides to
“But you cannot know your limits if you have not tested them. Understand me, my dear fellow, that I fear, more than anything, being little more than a failed experiment.”
“S’not the distance, Mr. ‘Olmes. Easy ‘nough to hop on the back of a cab. Ratcliffe can be real rough at night. Gangs been havin’ tiffs in the streets for near a month now.”
“I don’t suppose there is room on your dance card for another, sir?” I nearly closed my eyes at the sound of another voice on my other side. Of all the rotten luck, to be—
A weak, wonderful chuckle burst from my friend’s lips, and at last the despair ebbed away from his fair features.
“Ah, forgive me, dear sir,” he said, voice tinged with regret. “I seem to have trodden all manner of cigarette ash about your bedroom. Where does your housekeeper reside at this hour? The least I can do is ask her to clean up the mess I have so ungraciously made.”
Hopkins blinked owlishly and I bit back a laugh. “I. Well, sir. It was only a paragraph in this morning’s paper, and all wrong at that, so you’ve not missed anything. I haven’t let the grass grow under my feet. It’s down in Kent, just as you surmised, seven miles from Chatham and three from the railway line. I was wired for early this morning, reached Yoxley Place at six, conducted my investigation, and was back at Charing Cross by nine, and came straight to you by cab.”
His body beneath mine seemed to fill me, solder every crack that had splintered in my mind. He was all but ice, yet through the contact of skin I could feel his pulse, frenetic but true, and I grounded myself in his living, gusting breaths against my face. His bound hands fisted in my collar, clutching me like a lifeline as he drew in needy gasps, and I closed my eyes, grateful tears pooling at the bottom of my eyelids.
Extricating something from his pocket, Fred lifted a hand victoriously to present something to the open air, and it was as if time stood still. I sat, frozen, and felt the blood drain from my face.
"It was a case with its own rewards," Holmes replied, and I couldn't help but meet his ashy gaze, heart in my throat at the softness I found there. "...I assure you, I have been compensated in full."
Squinting in the dark as I rubbed my arms in the cold, I sighed in relief at the flickering of a distant light in the inky darkness.  “At last,” I said longingly. "I do hope they'll serve tea."
Spinning on a bar stool, a familiar face had turned my way, mouth split into a wicked grin. I found my eyes already rolling good-naturedly at the very sight of an old friend.
“…I am aware of the difference,” I began, cracking a grin, “when you are genuinely charming or merely playing at romance, Holmes. Your attempt to distract me from the fact our client is a smuggler is quite opaque.”
, my dear Inspector,” I said, with admitted cheek. “Perhaps he learned it from the faint brown-black mud on your boots.”
I summoned a smile, my heart overflowing with affection. “You will have the rest of our lives to make it up to me."
“Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,” Hopkins said. “Forgive my disturbing you at this early hour without sending word, I’m afraid I had little opportunity to telegram.”
Finally, Holmes turned his head, and his eyes found mine. It was not possible, but I thought for a moment he could hear the sound of my heart racing.
“Please calm yourself, sir,” said Holmes, in a voice as smooth as silk. I thanked God, not for the first time, that my friend was not in a business where his charms could bring ruin to anyone but criminals. “Pray, what is your concern?”
In the corner of my eye, the constable shook his head—with disbelief or suspicion, I could not tell. “Alone?"
Holmes's eyes tore away from the heavens to the road, his face solemn. “You are quite right in that, my dear.”
had been the one to leave my gloves at the inn, you would have chastised me within an inch of my life, doctor.”
Holmes’s eyes returned to mine gleaming, and his answering smile was easily the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. “It would be my privilege.”
I scolded, and bit the inside of my cheek so as not to swear as he pointedly pressed the cloth against my wound.
Holmes visibly smothered a smile. “I see. The lot of you will split a pot, a handful of pence each. A two guinea prize to the man who can bring me any concrete information about Peter Ables.”
“…For whatever it’s worth,” I managed, voice thick. “I never wanted…” My voice broke, but through force of sheer will I mastered it, hammering it even. “I am sorry, Holmes. I never meant to cause you discomfort. Our partnership has been…my privilege. And so was your friendship. Thank you for…everything.”
“Another deluge,” Holmes said one chilly morning, as I mustered into the sitting room with the faintest of winter twinges in my leg.
“There is nothing to thank,” Holmes said calmly. The iron intensity that had shone from his eyes had ebbed, sliding behind more opaque glass. “Our country’s laws on the subject are a point of conservatism that I consider both backward and unacceptably cruel. I do not blame you for your reluctance in speaking to me about it, especially when there is much of the personal which we do not discuss with one another. I can only offer you my regrets that you felt you could
“I—oh–” The woman swayed, shaking so hard she crumpled in on herself, and it was only my swift reflex that kept the woman from sliding out of her chair to the floor. I guided her steady and she began weeping pitifully, burying her face in her wizened hands. “Oh, Mr. Holmes! How could you…I cannot bear…”
I nodded in agreement. “It won’t be easy,” I warned. “It is a very secretive place, Holmes, and meant to be. You must not come off as a Yarder. Many have attempted to infiltrate clubs like these in the attempt to blackmail or arrest members for homosexual acts. Everyone is on their guard, now more than ever.”
“By all means!” said Mr. Everett. “I can fetch that report for you, while you take a look at it. The warehouse is just behind that gate, there, on the left.”
I glowered, sharply tying my robe closed. "I don't suppose you could have waited to test your hypothesis until the
I thought. “Almost two ‘ole days, sir. He was meant to come ‘ome Tuesday night and he never did. I thought he mighta been workin’ all night at the shipyard and bunked wit’ a friend but he woulda told me if he ‘ad. But then he didn’t come 'ome last night neither and I asked about ‘im down at the yard and everybody said they hadn’t seen ‘im today and that he was goin’ ta be let go if he didna show tomorrow!” By the end of it, the boy was practically breathless, edging dangerously into bright-eyed distress.
Taking pity on the poor little chap, I smiled. “A pleasure to meet you, Fred,” I said kindly. Wide brown eyes swiveled unblinkingly to mine. “I’m Doctor Watson.” I gestured to Holmes’s expectant form beside me. “And this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes. We received your message earlier this morning. Why don’t you sit and tell us what it is you need our help with?”
“Always are.” With a parcel of Mrs. Hudson’s finest goods, the lad scarpered off, and I leaned back to see Holmes smiling at me.
“I’m afraid I cannot say yet, Professor Coram,” Holmes said, and exhaled a plume of smoke through his thin lips. “But I assure you, I plan to investigate the matter thoroughly.”
“…Very well,” I said, very likely sealing my fate. Within my flawed skeleton my heart rejoiced, and my mind cursed my weakness.
The man's confidence gave way in half-hearted contrition. “Forgive me, I should have introduced myself first and spared you the discomfort. Quincey Mulberry, a pleasure. I meant to make your acquaintance when last I saw you here, but I’d not seen you come by in some time.” His accent, American and gravelly, was as unfamiliar as it was pleasant.
“I have forged and tested every link of the chain, Professor Coram, and I am sure that it is sound. What your motives are, or what exact part you play in this strange business, I am not yet able to say. But in a few minutes, I imagine I shall probably hear it from your own lips.”
Swallowing through the dismay of dragging this on longer, my hand clenched tightly over my cane. “I meant only that I did not wish to make you uncomfortable, Holmes,” I said quietly. “With…with my feelings. With my affection for you.”
“For God’s sake, Hopkins, hold her!” Holmes said, reaching for the other arm as the woman buried her clenched fist in Hopkins’s chest with shocking force, doubling him over. From where I stood awe-struck at the woman’s energy, I saw movement in the corner of my eye, and when my eyes traced it to its source my heart suspended in my chest.
"Imagine that," I said drily, but faltered as suddenly, Holmes’s amusement disappeared like a doused candle. I turned, following his gaze to the track behind me, only to stare with confusion. Down along the rails, I saw the most peculiar sight: the spotlight of the train was flickering. Squinting in the fog, I watched as its yellow beam began to dissipate into the foggy night until finally, it faded away entirely.
“If you’ll indulge me,” Holmes said. “I know you’ve already given your statement to the inspector, but I find it best to hear such things from the source, as it were.”
“Ms. Tartlon. In light of these events, I bid you take the day off. Mortimer has already gone to his family home to recuperate, child, I give you leave to do the same.”
Blinking and pale, Ms. Tarlton nodded, and after leading us into the large sitting room, she quickly gave us a shorter, more emotional summary of the night’s events that paralleled near-exactly Hopkins’s early recounting to us at Baker Street. Her willingness to meet Holmes’s and my eyes as she recounted the tale only further solidified my impression that she’d had no part in the night’s tragic events.
Mrs. Marker paused, her expression turning to sorrow. “Ah. Poor young Mr. Smith, he was a smoker also.” Her voice went weak and quivery at mention of the lad’s name. “Not as bad as the Professor, of course, but…with his health, I don’t know that it’s better nor worse for smoking.”
“You have successfully engaged my interest and my services, Mr. Ables,” Holmes said. The boy practically spasmed with joy on our couch, straightening like a ruler.
He had slipped away into unconsciousness, but his breathing was level. Exhaustion had taken him, and I swayed where I knelt in the mud as its power took hold of me in kind. I squeezed his bound, icy hands in mine, pressing my mouth to his frozen knuckles. My own eyes slipped closed, mind reeling at what I had so nearly lost and marveling what had been returned to me. My Watson would live. He would live.
“I knew there must be a mechanism to unlock the room from inside. I found a panel in the dark, and reversed it to release us. Eventually.” He bit out the word, but swallowed hard. The stillness returned to his face. “I knew time was of the essence. I ran down the stairs, past the injured constable—”
“No time to waste, Watson,” Holmes said, and bemused, I had no choice but to trail behind him as he approached the new stranger. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the man had unusual red hair down to his shoulders, going blond-grey near the mouth, and that his hat was the kind I had frequently seen on the cover of penny-farthing stories in bookstores, worn by adventurers in the Aborigines.
“We know nothing of the sort,” Holmes said, lifting an eyebrow. “But do not despair, good inspector. We have made some progress.” With his typical demonstrative air, he gestured to the bureau, and pulled open its main drawer. Inside, the drawer was empty. “See its hinges, the stripping here.” He pointed to the edges of the drawer, strips of cherry wood chipped away. “Notice it was not locked, but that recently it has been opened so forcibly that the varnish has been chipped away. Such marks aren’t evidence of heavy use, but rather a quick and sudden draw at a poor angle.” Holmes mimed ripping the drawer from its inner shelf.
Watson. Space that I never conceded to another before knowing you, that I considered myself above sharing. Other people had only to that point disappointed me, and I believed myself above them, what they could offer me, independent of such piddling urges. Relationships with others, they only produced fluff to clear, cotton in the mind—obligation and expectation which distracted from my work."
I felt suddenly humbled by the admission. I tried to recall the first time I had ever felt stirred by thoughts of another, and remembered how in my youth, it had taken years to learn my own preferences, how to accommodate others, and what was possible between two people in intimacy. I could not imagine the fear of going a life without urges, only to encounter them without warning oriented towards the only friend I had in life. I felt sympathy well up like spring water in my gut. I realized then, definitively, that I needed to proceed with utmost care: to preserve my friendship with Holmes, yes, but to spare him any discomfort or heartbreak I could. For all that my friend hid behind a mask of emotionlessness in unfamiliar company, I knew him to be particularly sensitive. Rushing into physical intimacy could altogether frighten him away, or worse, damage him irrevocably.
