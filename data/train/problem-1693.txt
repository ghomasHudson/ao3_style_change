John straightened up and plastered on his best ‘everything is fine’ smile. “Good morning, we were hoping to impose on you for tea.”
From the sofa Mycroft made a sound, both John and Sherlock turned their heads to look at him. “I agree,” he conceded, “we’ve been running him through facial recognition software, starting with the American’s database given what Harriet had said.”
Of course, given who her family was Willa was born into a state of danger, but this was different. This was an actual physical danger she was in, not something theoretical or abstract. This was the very first time she stood below the sword and one of the few times in his life that Mycroft truly felt powerless.
Mrs. Hudson reached forward and yanked John to her, she was surprisingly strong given her age, folding him into a hug. “Oh John, it’ll be alright. She’s a bright girl and I’m sure half the country is already looking for her.” She reassured him and rubbed a circle into his back.
“Why do we dress up for the dead, they’re dead they can’t see us?” Sherlock mumbled under his breath and he undid his shirt.
He’d dreamt about Sherlock returning again. Sometimes it would be in the same ridiculous fashion he had done when returning from the dead. Other dreams John would meet him on the tarmac and Sherlock would step off the plane and walk over to John with that self-assured smirk because he’d always known John would still be there for him.
Sherlock was glad John wasn’t looking at him when he said that. He made a noise of uninterested acknowledgement.
John ticked off a mental note for dirty talk as he leaned down to start on Sherlock’s buttons. “Yes.” Sherlock said as he started to help undo his shirt.
“Can you tell me what happened now?” Sherlock asked as he sat in his chair and pulled her onto his lap.
“Daddy.” Willa turned so she was facing John, her small feet digging into Sherlock’s thighs. “I stayed up until midnight.”
“My room.” She mumbled into his shoulder sounding suspiciously like she was going to fall asleep there.
Mycroft got him several high-end jumpers and Greg got him two tickets to a rugby match, whereas John got Mycroft a tie that he hated to admit cost the price of one of his coats and a good bottle of whiskey for Greg. Mrs. Hudson received a new scarf and box of a variety of teas and she had made them baked goods that Greg immediately dove into and at one point unceremoniously shoved a cookie into Mycroft’s mouth while he protested.
Lestrade and Mycroft looked the same in the photo so it was a recent one, Lestrade’s children were also in the photograph. The four of them were seated on a bench in the back garden of Mycroft’s house, all smiling sincerely at the camera.
Helmets had been purchased as well and soon the girls were on their bikes. Willa was trying valiantly to keep up with Addison but she had the disadvantage of inexperience. Of course, the fact that they were both still in their Easter dresses didn’t help any.
Sherlock felt his lips curl up at the pure spite John managed to put into the question. “John, I have more than enough money. I have no interest in removing Willa from the life she’s grown accustomed to.”
Willa shrugged and played with the duvet. “It’s in the films. You’re supposed to kiss the person you love at midnight.”
“Alright, you sit here where I can see you.” John warned Willa and sat her in the waiting room adjacent from Kyle’s hospital room.
Aaron blinked for a few moments before answering. “Uh… five thirty on Sunday, give or take a few catnaps.”
Mycroft’s lips drew up into a line, clearly unhappy with being told what to do but he nodded anyway.
Sherlock was pleased by how much Willa was retaining from their impromptu lessons. She would be doing graduate chemistry before she reached secondary school if they kept up this way. He was also certain that between himself, John and her tutor (who he had yet to meet) they could successfully educate her without sending her to school.
John rose from his seat and he felt badly for laughing. He walked over to Sherlock and grabbed his arms. “I’m not mocking you. I’m just… it’s very sweet of you.” He said and leaned up to kiss him.
Those eyes were sweeping over John, deducing things no doubt. John had never really felt uncomfortable under the calculating gaze as many people did and he wasn’t surprised to find he still didn’t mind. The look though encouraged him to climb to his feet in the doorway and without thinking he stood at attention. Sherlock’s lips twitched like he wanted to smile.
“What do you mean? I didn’t do anything?” Harry insisted but John could see that her heart was in her protests.
Five hours later there was a needle in his veins but he couldn’t press the plunger. Damn his brother and damn the hope he’d given him. The drugs never made it into his veins that night and the following week he was on a plane bound for Brazil.
John opened his mouth to protest but Sherlock cut him off with a raised hand. “Have you thought to ask me what I feel should happen with
“Don’t mind me.” John ordered and nudged the file Sherlock had been reading back in front of his face.
Thursday afternoon Willa sped through her homework before even getting a snack. She waited patiently by the bathroom door after John woke Sherlock but as soon as he emerged she was a ball of energy. Sherlock had only held up the stopwatch and asked her to get the bowls. John had skipped cooking dinner and just ordered take away because the sight of Sherlock Holmes bent over the kitchen table explaining proper scientific documentation to a five-year-old was too precious to interrupt.
“No I think this is exactly where I’m supposed to be.” A man’s voice answered. Willa frowned because this was a woman’s restroom.
Slipping his hand into his pocket he pulled out a key and unlatched the box. He flipped open the lid quickly. Sherlock was right. The Sig Sauer rested on top, the clip lying next to it, but underneath were several beige folders probably containing important documents. That wasn’t what caught Sherlock’s attention though.
She began apologizing but John held up his hand. “No, you didn’t do anything. You haven’t got anything to be sorry over.” He insisted.
Sherlock looked up and, despite their conversation the night before, seemed surprised. “Of course.” Was his answer though and he completed it with an eye roll.
“No,” John said and suddenly grabbed Sherlock’s arm and pulled him back a little. He wasn’t looking at Sherlock though; instead, he was facing the other direction looking back towards the building. “What is that?” He said before letting go of Sherlock’s arm and pointing up.
John sighed on Sherlock’s left. “Then what happened to him? The autopsy,” Erik flinched, “proved he hadn’t ingested it accidently and there were numerous needle marks on his body.”
“John,” Sherlock’s voiced called out to him a tone that said this wasn’t the first time he’d said his name.
“I don’t, Sherlock.” John insisted. “There is a boy who carries half of my DNA but he’s not my son, he never was.”
Sherlock sighed in relief as he got a good look at her hand. No stitches necessary, just a long cut on the heel of her palm made worse because she’d been clenching her fist. She stopped crying after he’d cleaned it off and picked out a purple plaster.
Aside from a single fire truck left to make sure the fire was properly out the rest of the presence on the street was police. Most of the residents of the neighborhood had retreated back into their houses. Some, Sherlock could see watching from behind their curtains. There would be little chance of getting anyone to talk in this area. So he turned to go behind the building, hoping to catch sight of anyone who might be willing to talk with them.
“What?” Willa asked. She was immediately displeased that at no knowing something. John turned and gave him a sharp glare.
“Sit.” Willa instructed Sherlock when she saw his confused face, she patted the spot next to her on the bed.
“My homeless network needs rebuilding. I thought it was a perfectly appropriate allocation of my time.” Defended Sherlock as he resolutely refused to sit across the desk from his brother.
John was impressed that she trusted his daughter enough to let her hold the baby without hovering. They both pulled out their mobiles at the same time, exchanged a glance and then giggled.
John’s face had softened. “I’m not upset with you or having second thoughts. Now is just not the time to be doing this.”
After going back to work John somehow found himself in charge of the night shift. He knew he should be irritated with Mary over it and part of him was. Yet he grew to adore those late nights where the nursery was lit by the night light in the corner and the only sound was of Willa sucking happily at her bottle. As he fed her he would press his face into her silky soft hair and simply breathe. After her bottle, she would lay in his arms and eye him speculatively in the dim light, it reminded him of how Sherlock looked at the world.
“Willa’s allergic, learned that her first Christmas. Luckily I realized it at the tree lot rather than after I paid. She’s miserable in the spring.” John explained with a small smile.
John made it to the little café by the school first, not surprising if Sherlock had to come from Baker Street. He dropped into one of the little chairs and rested his head in his hands.
John ended up going with the black jeans and ignored his daughter’s look of smug triumph when she came back downstairs and saw.
Sherlock held up a hand. “I will look into the case but you’ll only complicate it by breaking the anonymity order.”
“They’re still in London, John,” Mycroft told him sounding bored, “we have faces and a car to look for. That is more than we might have hoped for.”
Willa had been quiet at dinner once she realized Sherlock wasn’t going to be there. They’d both gotten very used to his presence in such a short time.
She began pulling out Willa’s hair ties and then undoing the braid Papa had put in just before they left. Janine then opened the black box and pulled out a brush. She wasn’t as nice at brushing Willa’s hair as Papa was, even Daddy did a better job, and when she was done Willa’s entire scalp hurt from having her hair pulled.
For his part Mycroft didn’t even look up. “Gregory is hardly a goldfish Sherlock. If we must make aquatic references I would liken him more to a dolphin: social, intelligent…”
Mycroft must have seen his acceptance because he continued speaking. “When you get back from work you will take the child on a walk. Anthea will meet you along your way and take you two somewhere safe.”
John felt just a bit guilty beneath all the layers of rage and despair so he drew away from the others. “Fine,” was all me managed before stalking down the hall towards Harry’s room.
“Oh. OH! You beautiful, clever girl.” He cried and lifted Willa. He kissed her cheek as he spun her. He turned to John as he set her back down. “I need to go somewhere. Go home.”
There was a pub not far from the hotel and John figured it wouldn’t be so bad. A pint and a burger, hopefully some sort of game was on even if it was a replay. It would be nice to be around people since he hadn’t spoken to anyone really during the conference. All he could think of when he had down time was texting Sherlock or how long it was until he could go home.
Irene had always known, from the moment she met Sherlock Holmes and John Watson that they would come to this. Unfortunately for them it had taken them a decade to get that simple fact through their thick skulls.
Sherlock readied the toast and when Willa came down he handed it to her. “John has a headache.” He explained taking the hairbrush from her hand.
John, of course, ignored him and set to work peeling back the glass until there was enough space that he could reach out and grab whatever was hanging off the side of the building. He struggled a moment, part of the cloth pinned beneath the wood, but after pulling a bit more, it came free.
No sooner had Gregory fallen asleep and Mycroft had finally gotten comfortable did it seem both of their mobiles went off, almost at the same time.
She hadn’t deserved Clara and she knew it had been her own hand that had ruined her life, which was why the only people willing to celebrate her fiftieth birthday with her was her brother, his deranged partner and her niece.
Mycroft shook his head. “No, Reinette, I said I would hire someone to teach you French. You should have learned a second language years ago.”
That night had the promise of going an entirely different direction than it had, namely the bedroom instead of a holding cell. When he’d been abroad sometimes he’d think about it and try to deduce how it might have gone if they’d not been interrupted. He hadn’t done it so much after returning to London. If John had called off the wedding Mary might have terminated the pregnancy when she found out and there would be no Willa.
The next morning John only felt mild embarrassment about his small breakdown over Willa’s birthday. He wasn’t sure if the stress and lack of sleep were entirely to blame or if he’d been this dramatic in previous years, except of course without and audience.
Janine turned around holding a small black plastic box and a green box with a woman with brown hair on the front. Hair dye Willa realized after a moment, Aunt Molly had dyed her hair once using dye like that. “Alright come on then, like a good girl.” Janine told her and jerked her head.
“Something tipped her off.” Mycroft said by way of greeting when he walked out into the back garden where John had set Willa up on a blanket in the grass.
He was standing in the living room watching them in the kitchen with a particularly guarded expression. John smiled at him and waved a hand to beckon him in.
Harry crossed her arms over her chest. “So you’re ex attacks me on my birthday and kidnaps my niece? How is that okay, John? Don’t you see what he’s done?” She shouted, standing.
Also I have some plans for the future for this but I'm deciding if I want to make this into a series or have just one monster story.
Lestrade nodded and scribbled a note on a piece of paper before handing it to Sherlock. “DI Thomas, she’s young but good. I’ll call ahead and warn her you’re coming.”
Sherlock was practically a live wire by the time they left for dinner Saturday night. Despite having walked in on John and Willa clearly discussing whatever it was he hadn’t been able to hear much. What he had heard only confirmed his suspicions that this secret was the real reason behind why they were going out to dinner tonight.
He was gentle but relentless. One finger became two, and then a third was added right about the time Sherlock began losing digits of Pi.
John worked the next week. It was longer hours and he even pulled extra days due to one of the doctor’s being away still and the fact that Friday was New Year’s Day.
He assumed Sherlock was already asleep until there was a shuffling noise and the other man appeared in the doorway. “She doesn’t mind it, do you Willa?”
She quickly grabbed the sweater she’d been wearing and went to the window. Carefully she dug her fingers into what was left of the handle and pulled up. The window didn’t budge at first so she pulled harder, flakes of paint and wood chipping away at her efforts. When it finally gave it did so with a squealing so loud to her own ears that Willa paused, waiting for someone to come investigate the noise.
During one such arrest, his life took another bizarre turn. Colonel Moran showed up, in person, and bailed him out even though Cole didn’t even know how even begin to try and contact the man.
That night after John had gone up to bed Sherlock slipped out to put the word out through his homeless network. They would be especially interested in this case since one of their own had been caught up.
Gregory cursed loudly as he had to push Mycroft up and get his out. Mycroft waited patiently for the barrage of foul language to subside before he answered his own.
John hadn’t the foggiest idea of what Willa was up to but he watched her anyway. An hour later her gloves and hat were lying by his feet and she kneeled on the pavement in front of the steps. Her tongue was poking out of the corner of her mouth in concentration while she went about whatever it was she was doing. There was yellow stain on her cheek and a streak of green dye in her strawberry blond hair but John couldn’t bring himself to care about the mess.
to be his case, he couldn’t just be expected to sit at home and twiddle his thumbs like some no brained civilian. There was zero chance this was just some ‘random’ kidnapping, that his daughter had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Their lives did not allow for such coincidences. No, there was no doubt in his mind that Mary had finally made her move.
Willa crawled unsteadily around the floor of the cottage as John and Uncle Mycroft (John had mostly forgiven him and Mycroft had only argued over the moniker once) poured over the surveillance photos and planned the return to London.
While somehow being careful of the kitten in her lap she bent forward and wrapped her arms around Sherlock’s neck pulling him into a huge hug. Sherlock was grinning.
“Oh come on,” Greg snapped throwing his hands up in the air, “you really want them to spend the next few hours thinking their daughter is dead?”
Sherlock was still frustratingly in the dark. When Luke had approached them he’d believed that John’s secret had something to do with his military days. Except, the introduction of the wife and the gaggle of children all but eliminated that possibility.
Willa came back downstairs in a hunter green velvet dress, she was wearing black tights and black patent boots. She handed him a hair brush and her bag of hair ties before throwing herself down onto a kitchen chair.
Sherlock knew John was right and John assuring him he didn’t blame him helped loosen the knot in his stomach.
“Listen, John, I believe...” Sherlock started to tell him about his suspicions of Harry but movement from across the street caught his eye. A homeless man was making his way down the road, oblivious to them. “Oh, I’ve been so stupid.” He spat and pointed at the homeless man’s back.
. The girl. She was kneeling in the melting snow not far from John in a shockingly pink parka, not paying mind to anything going on around her.
Though for his discomfort Gregory flashed him a cheeky smile. It was short lived though as Sherlock chose this moment to huff at them in annoyance.
And yeaaah John might not be properly attired in jeans for NYE dinner at the Northall but I doubt anyone is going to say anything to someone showing up under a Mycroft Holmes reservation.
She lost it then, her ability to keep the great weight of it all in her stomach. She didn't even have time to stand before she was leaning over the bed, retching. The hospital phone dropping down to the floor, even then she could still hear the tone.
“Has she tried to contact you or her?” Sherlock asked. Something about the way John had said ‘that we know of’ seemed wrong.
He’d gotten spectacularly and wonderfully high the next day, and the day after that, and for the four months following.
“What do we get a girl born two weeks after Christmas for her birthday?” John asked as they left the school.
“That is true but it’s New Year’s Eve.” John agreed. “What’s the point in going out if you don’t get properly soused?”
John knew what she was talking about thankfully. He’d introduced her to nonalcoholic champagne two years prior during her first attempt to make it to midnight. “Yes, I’ll show Molly where it is.”
John shoved open the door and stormed back to his boring little house on the quaint little street. He bypassed Mary and jogged up the stairs to where Willa was napping. Not caring one bit if he woke her, John scooped her out of the crib.
There was cake, bits of cookie and presents. There was, however, a distinct lack of  beer or wine but Sherlock knew why and Harry was looking increasingly more agitated as the night went on.
John was confused at first when they sat and Sherlock left a seat between them. When Willa came in though she seemed to instinctively know the place had been left for her. John wondered if they’d spoken about it because any other time she and Addison would have sat next to each other whispering and giggling throughout the entire meal. Addison even seemed confused at this change for a second before sitting across from her.
Her eyes came open at that. “Uncle Mycroft’s?” She ask, her voice still heavy with sleep. She sounded more childish than Sherlock had ever heard her.
“No!” Sherlock interrupted forcefully. “I mean. Thank you for the offer but I would never displace you and your daughter.” He explained in a calmer voice.
After dressing he walked into the kitchen to check on the progress of their last batch of cupcakes. They still had a few minutes left in the oven.
Sherlock cast one last glare at John, who wasn’t facing him to notice, before looking at Willa and nodding. “Of course.” It was entirely possible that as long as she prefaced a question with ‘papa’ he would have great difficulty telling her no. He was worried she would catch on to that.
The familiar scenery of the road to Mycroft’s office flashed by as John held Willa to his chest. She fell asleep within minutes.
“I’ll call, John,” She continued sounding more sure of herself, “that way they won’t realize you’ve known for a couple hours already.”
The man it came from was approaching them rapidly with a friendly smile on his face. This man was more noticeably ex-military than even John and that wasn’t taking into account the small military tattoo on his forearm.
Willa didn’t understand why they only saw Harry a few times a year instead of the frequency in which she saw Mycroft or even Molly. John knew one day he would have to sit down and explain the addiction to her but for now, at six, Willa didn’t need to know those details. John would tell her about it when she got old enough that her own predisposition towards addiction became something she needed to be aware of.
Sorry for the slightly longer than usual delay in chapters. The real world hasn't been exactly kind to me.
Sherlock actually spluttered and just for that John was more than willing to sacrifice his bowls to her experiments.
Lukas shook his head. “No. Emma’s an alcoholic without a job while my brother owns one of the top advertising agencies in London. No, there was no way he was losing the case.”
“Besides baking is very scientific.” Sherlock continued and upon watching her face light up he knew he’d won the argument.
“Willa.” He said trying not to sound impatient. “Why did you decide on the tea cup in the first place?”
John looked at him properly for the first time since reentering the room. “Maybe I’m not ready. We all need to adjust to you coming back. I may not be angry like last time but this is still something I’m not used to yet.”
John collapsed onto his side despite the fact he knew getting up from the floor would be painful. “What the fuck?”
Willa shook her head. Nana trimmed the ends of her hair sometimes but Daddy had always said he liked her hair long so she’d never gotten it cut before.
John propped himself up on his elbows, eyes following Sherlock across the room where he dug through his bag for the brand new bottle of lube he’d purchased that morning. There were a few other new items stored in the bottom of his as well but they could be saved for another time.
“Willa why don’t you help Addison hand out the presents?” Mycroft called over, saving them from what might have been an epic sulk.
John nodded in agreement and chewed a biscuit thoughtfully. “I think he’ll agree to at least tomorrow but I’m not sure about Wednesday or next week.”
Gregory stirred on the lounge and Mycroft instantly regretted raising his voice. He’d decided that there was no reason to wake his husband until he was sure there was something to tell him.
“You said ‘putting the tree up’ not ‘getting a tree’ so the tree is most likely artificial.” Sherlock explained and sounded irritated having to do so. John was secretly pleased because Sherlock had been unusually patient and apathetic towards things that had once driven him mad.
Sherlock didn’t feel that way but he also didn’t want to argue over whether it was anyone’s fault. “We’ll find another lead.” He promised instead.
Sherlock, having read the meaning behind his change in direction, shook his head. “John, not a good idea.” He warned.
Will could just barely see herself in the mirror, mostly undistorted, but only if she stood near the left corner. She barely recognized herself though.
“The fucking security guard,” He explained by way of cursing even more. Mycroft actually looked confused so Greg took a deep breath and tried again.
John’s heart hurt at the sound. “Oh god. Hello you daft sod.” He choked out and grabbed Sherlock by the lapels of his coat, pulling him down to his level for a fierce hug.
John clenched his fist several times, knowing full well Sherlock could see him. “Yes, I did.” He answered finally.
John moved and sat in his own chair. “Because whatever you’ve been through it’s been a lot. You’ve not even been in London twelve hours, now is not the time to dredge everything up.”
“The only camera pointed anywhere near the alley only took a photo every two seconds,” Mycroft cut him off before he could accuse him of withholding information.
Harry nodded. “Then this woman came in and she saw Willa and was talking to her, asking her to come over. I told her not to and then… I don’t know, this,” she gestured to the wound, “I guess.”
Turns out someone *cough* wrote it and 3000 words of the next chapter entirely in present tense while the rest of the fic is in past tense.
John didn’t jump but his head whipped around quickly, Greg could tell he was wound tighter than piano wire. “Greg, Sherlock thought you would come.” If words could have marched in an orderly fashion from one’s vocal cords the ones coming from John’s lips would have.
“The whole room is fireproofed.” Sherlock said, as if reading John’s thoughts. He gestured at the sprinkler head. “That’s why the water was off last week.”
“I-I don’t understand.” Sherlock finally admitted wincing minutely at the raw emotion in his voice. He tried to step away again but John’s fingers tightened around his arms.
“Oh hello, John.” She greeted as she pulled open the door, she was in her dressing gown and slippers. “How was your dinner?”
As they walked along the inner circle Willa ran ahead of them, used to the freedom here. John let her go as long as they could see the puff on the top of her hat bobbing in the distance. As they turned and took the path towards the boating lake Sherlock saw a man he’d seen earlier when exiting Baker Street.
“Of course it’s okay, we’ll just have to be careful this time.” Sherlock said relieved they would finally be leaving soon.
John isn’t sure how much of these safety precautions had been put in by Mycroft and how many by Sherlock but he’s glad for them.
“Yes.” John conceded. “She will cry, but that’s only because she’s learned it’s how she gets her way. One cry and someone comes running for.”
Later he and Sherlock are downstairs in the office. Sherlock was still going through his cold cases and John was helping. Though tonight ‘helping’ meant that John was lounging in one of the arm chairs playing some tower stacking game Willa had downloaded on to his phone. It was oddly addictive.
Sherlock tried to do as John instructed but the other man had pulled down Sherlock’s zip and untucked him from his pants.
Almost as soon as the car stopped Willa went racing out, Mrs. Hudson followed with surprising agility for a woman who’d had her hip replaced over the summer. John had gotten all the way outside of the car when he realized Sherlock was still sitting stone still in his seat.
“Yes.” John agreed. “But you should have asked me first.  Two: we will sit down with Willa and explain we’re in a relationship. And three: This thing with Mary. It’s not over, it may never be over. We might be looking over our shoulders for her for the rest of our lives. I know you’ve been to hell and back for me already but I can’t make this go away.”
it’s best if I keep it on me when we’re out. Are you telling me it wouldn’t have been useful at the park?”
John was about to ask what he was apologizing for when Addison and Willa walked into the room, heads bent together. Addison was holding a mobile phone which seemed to be the point of focus. He immediately understood what the apology had been about.
“Why are you in bed?” John asked looking at the clock next to the bed, making sure he was correct as to the time.
“Let us know when the police have spoken to you.” John told her before sweeping out of the room, Sherlock hot on his heels.
“Whatever it is like, dear, just figure it out and stop all this silliness.” She informed him with a wave of her hand.
“Jesus, Harry.” John cursed as he worked to lay her out flat on the floor. “Come on, Harry wake up.” He shouted even though he knew it was no use.
There had been police milling in and out of 221B for what seemed like forever, though it’d been less than an hour since the first DS had arrived. They had started off asking pointless and redundant questions to the point John had been ready to channel his inner Sherlock. To scream at them about how vapid they were being.
“Mmmm,” Gregory had just popped something into his mouth. He quickly chewed and swallowed while waving his arms around as if that would help him do it faster. “She was there, found a sweater and some hair stuffed in a window. Sherlock thinks she put it there herself.”
Willa tilted her head back to look up at him. “You have to be nice to Aunt Harry, it’s her birthday.” She scolded.
From the corner of his eye he saw Mycroft look up from his phone. “I’m not sure what you mean, brother dear.”
Willa tried to scream louder and kicked at him more. Her screams were muffled by the woman’s hand still even though it was slipping as Willa fought.
“Molly, you’re not supposed to be in here,” he said as he zipped the bag shut again, obviously having figured out why she’d been taken off.
The ‘suicide mission’ MI6 had handed him had taken a mere five months to complete and hadn’t been as lethal as they’d hoped. Yes, he had been shot again but further quick thinking had saved his life. No one visited him in the hospital and because of this no one cared when he walked out of the Bucharest hospital a week later against medical advice.
John choked which led to a violent coughing fit. Once he could stand without support he walked over to Willa and took the book out of her hand. “Alright, enough out of you. Go clean your room. And no more watching telly with Nana.”
A sharp inhale from over Sherlock’s shoulder and John ripped his hand away like the computer had shocked him. He’d spotted Willa too.
Sherlock really did intend on taking cases again. He knew it wouldn’t be as simple as he made it sound, John would be more hesitant to run head first into danger but Sherlock had realized long ago he needed John to work at his best. He’d survived in exile but only just barely, there were new scars as a testament the fact he hadn’t been as quick as he should have been.
Mycroft nodded and quickly sent off a series of emails updating everyone who needed it that Willa’s hair would be much shorter than previously described. Only then did he sit down and finally begin eating.
Mycroft may have decided she was his to protect that day, not just on some promise to Sherlock but because he wanted to.
It was after eight when the sound of heels on the stairs caught John’s attention. Anthea stood in the doorway and looked at John.
Turning Sherlock saw a small dome camera affixed to the ceiling by the door. It wiggled back and forth when he looked at it, John was controlling it from work.
“We’ve got to do something about it,” Gregory continued obviously thinking along the same lines as Mycroft.
There was a line of dirt going up the stairs where Willa had presumably rested her hand as she ran up and down the stairs day after day.
Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes off John, worried, though he tilted his head towards his brother and Lestrade, “which I’m going to do as soon as my brother leaves.”
John sighed and set down his book. “Sherlock. she’s not even six for god’s sake. This year Willa learned she was different from the other children her age. While she was learning multiplication and writing short stories they were struggling to learn to read. This is the one aspect in which she’s just like them, let her have this.” John explained.
“Suicide?” Sherlock asked as he tossed the picture back at his brother. The photographs were unreliable as to whether the hanging had been staged.
“That night, after Bart’s, I was too busy trying to figure out who the fuck Sherlock Holmes was to even have time to consider it again.”
John was woken by Willa literally bouncing on his chest, the sun wasn’t even up yet. He groaned and fished his mobile out of his pocket. 6:12 mocked him on the screen. He groaned and grabbed her, rolling onto his side he forced her to lay with him for a moment.
Once in Afghanistan there’d been a fire fight in the street of the town not far from the hospital he’d been stationed at. The locals had been overwhelmed in the aftermath and John had been called out to help. The first scene he’d stumbled upon had been a mother holding her child and rocking him, she was nearly catatonic and covered in blood. When John got closer he realized none of it was hers, instead it all belonged to the boy. He was maybe five and dead long before John got there.
“No new damage, the old cast took all of it.” John said and Sherlock could tell he was pretending not to notice he was taking Willa’s pulse.
Mrs. Hudson opened the door with a knowing smirk. “I don’t mind dear, I know you and John still have so much time to make up for.” She reassured him with a pat on the arm.
“We’ll go out and get your father something else.” He winced after he’d said it, realizing it was the twenty-third and the shops would be mad.
Sherlock was on his feet less than a second before John was. They both darted towards the back of the restaurant, it was where the restrooms were. Where Harry and Willa were.
Sherlock nodded and carefully picked it up to show her. She was tentative to step forward until he reached out and pulled her closer.
“I’m going to stay home and order the Chinese for her dinner.” John said smiling at how eager Sherlock was to pick her up.
When his contract had come up four years later Cole had thought nothing of signing on for another four years. That decision had changed his life in ways he couldn’t have even imagined.
“I figured I had enough on my plate keeping up with father Christmas.” John said as they laid in bed the Saturday before Easter.
He moaned when he added the second finger. He watched John’s cock twitched at the noise, a bead of precome dripping onto John’s stomach. Sherlock pressed the fingers in and out all under John’s steady gaze. He scissored his fingers apart and moaned, John echoed him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as John immaturely stuck his tongue out at him from where he was laying on the bed.
Mycroft smiled smugly when he realized he’d gotten his point across. “I’m not asking you to. You’re aware 221C has never been rented successfully.”
He may not have been Sherlock but it seemed an odd thing something remaining intact after someone had gone through all that trouble to burn down the building.
Sherlock could only nod and pull the grapes out from the sink. As he turned he pulled one off and held it out to John. “Eat or you’ll moan later.”
There was a sinking feeling in John’s stomach and he finally took a chair, careful not to jostle Willa. Mycroft silently pushed a stack of manila folders in front of John, eyes flickering down to Willa for a moment.
Anyway enjoy. This chapter was difficult because it's kind of filler unfortunately things need to be set up. I've already started the next chapter so yay for that!
He stood under one of the patches where the ceiling had collapsed and the noonday sun was shining through. John watched as Sherlock held up the clump he’d saved from falling to the floor. The sun bounced off of it highlighting the blonde and red, it was a shade John could have recreated from memory. Anything he might have wanted to say died in his throat as John realized he was staring at a clump of his daughter’s hair.
“Is Sherlock my stepdad?” Willa asked out of the blue as she began pulling off the bits of burger she didn’t like, also known as all the veggies.
John shook his head and looked over at Willa. “I wasn’t really home…” he said carefully. He’d hidden from Mary and the pregnancy after she’d shot Sherlock, not sure if he’d forgive her. They’d only reconciled, or whatever it had been, during Christmas before he and Sherlock ran off to confront Magnussen.
When they arrived at the house he’d not been let down. Willa oohed and aahed over the lights twinkling at them from a distance. Mrs. Hudson had been the willing listener for the ride and was indulging in her chattering about how beautiful they were.
“You’re angry, Barnes, we all are,” Moran had reassured him while shoving several cups of coffee at him. “But you’re a soldier and we carry on, but now I’ve got a mission for you.”
Willa screwed up her face. “Gross.” She whispered just loud enough for them to hear. This earned her a smile from Sherlock, John hadn’t even though the other man was paying attention.
Harry’s eyes widened comically. “But,” her head whipped between Sherlock and him, “you’re straight.” She said to John.
laptop, with him. Sherlock had argued until John reminded him that there was a perfectly good computer in the office. John’s boredom on this trip was more important than Sherlock’s unwillingness to go downstairs.
Willa looked over it with wide eyes before she looked up at Sherlock. “Can you play for us? Daddy says you used to play all the time.”
Sherlock’s eyes followed them up the stairs and when they’d turned the landing they drifted back to John. A weight settled in the air and it made John nervous. He stepped down and began attempting to clear up the mess Willa had made.
In his hands, damp and slightly singed on the one sleeve was the sweater he’d made Willa wear out to dinner. As he held it up something slipped out of the one sleeve, Sherlock managed to grab most of it before it hit the ground. It took a second to realize he was holding hair, John grabbed the sleeve it’d come out of and sure enough there was more stuck inside.
John had always liked the woman. She was in her mid-fifties and ruled the school fairly. During their tour of the school she never asked why John had such strict policies about Willa and that had endeared her to him. Sherlock seemed to also appreciate her lack of prying into their situation, only asking necessary questions.
“Alright fine,” Greg sighed, realizing when he was trying to fight a losing battle. He instead handed the evidence bag to Sherlock who took it and after having put the hair into it, rolled it up and placed it in his pocket.
Greer Fisher was nearly the same age as John but exceedingly more wealthy, which explained the twenty-three year old girlfriend. John didn’t think he looked like the type to make his girlfriend disappear but he’d long learned not to entirely trust those feelings.
She was very pretty and looked a lot like Daddy, only shorter and with longer hair. She didn’t smell as nice though, she smelt very strongly of perfume and sometimes of the wine Daddy liked to drink. Willa occasionally tried to figure out if she’d be short like Daddy and Aunt Harry or if she’d grow tall like Papa. Right now she was shorter than most of her classmates. When she had told Daddy this he smiled and stroked her hair telling her it was because all the Watsons were short.
It was a silly thing getting so upset over cut hair, especially given the rest of the circumstances, but that was their thing. Every morning now they could be found at the table where Sherlock brushed and did Willa’s hair while they talked about what they were going to do that day. At night Sherlock would pull it out of whatever style she’d worn that day and brush it, often for much longer than was necessary. Willa never once complained though, she was always too busy describing her day or reading out loud from a new book that had magically appeared on her desk overnight.
He glanced over the paper and realized the number didn’t make sense to have been John or someone else who could update Harriet. According to the information they’d pulled on the number it belonged to a cell phone that had been purchased in China.
He stepped forward to the end of her bed and very intentionally wrapped his hands around the plastic foot board. His fingertips found the rigid plastic of the joint and he dug them into it. That little bit of pain was the only thing keeping him grounded, the only thing keeping him from lashing out.
Mycroft’s mouth snapped shut audibly as the news registered. “Keep me updated,” was all he managed to say before hanging up.
John pulled out of the embrace first and he reached up to stroke Sherlock’s cheek. “It’ll be alright.” He assured Sherlock instead. “We’ll be fine.”
“No. A text, a telegram, a bloody billboard. Just one word so I know you’re alive.” John insisted. “I won’t spend days wondering if your dead. I’ve lived through that enough times now, thank you.”
Sherlock had too in a way. He might not have been so willing to risk his life and freedom to protect Mary if she hadn’t been pregnant at the time. He’d seen John’s face though, once the idea of a baby had settled in, and had known that he’d do anything to make sure that baby was safe.
Sherlock hadn’t gone back into the dining room and John turned the other way to follow him. John spotted the small pink sandal lying in the middle of the hall as he turned the corner. “Sherlock?” He shouted not able to see the man. As he reached the end of the hall there was an exit. John shoved the door open.
It was only after Sherlock had bodily shoved John to the sink and ran his hands beneath the tap did John finally,
“Yeah, she gets a rough time of it.” Lestrade said knowingly but he held out the folder to Sherlock. “Look just take a look at it.”
Sherlock dropped the arm he’d been holding out, realizing John didn’t actually want to see the proof of his sister’s betrayal.
“Allergies.” Sherlock shrugged though he found himself looking at the folder Lestrade had intended to give him.
Willa had to bit down on the desire to protest that there’d been nothing wrong with the hair her hair had been before. She’d like her hair like that, everyone always talked about how pretty it was, but more importantly, that was how Daddy and Papa knew she looked.
John rolled his eyes. “That’s what I mean. I didn’t know that. Every person who I’ve ever asked to watch her has said ‘oh I’d love to babysit’ or ‘call me if you need any help’ before I asked. You haven’t. In fact I don’t even know if you just tolerate her because of me.”
“What are you doing on there tonight?” John asked because Sherlock hadn’t just been scrolling through the pages as he normally did. Tonight he’d been typing away frantically.
“Me? You’ve been going behind my back and meeting with the one person in this world you can’t stand more than Mary.” Sherlock growled.
On the walk to the bedroom John managed to remember himself through the fog of chemicals pumping through his blood stream.
John would brush his hand around Sherlock’s neck and ask if he’d stay up to hear Willa read something for a school reading log. Sherlock agreed. After she was done John would kiss him and ask if he’d stay up until Willa went to bed. Sherlock did.
“The next day was the last time Mary saw Willa, at least, that we know of.” John spoke, drawing Sherlock from his thoughts. “We spent a few months in a safe house until Mycroft felt we were safe back home. My first thought was that we couldn’t go back to that house, I wanted Willa to grow up here.”
John looked up at her in surprise again. He didn’t know Mycroft had been there and he had no idea what the tickets were about. “And what were they for?” He pried.
Mycroft looked up and his gaze seemed to pin John to the seat. For just a second it was easy to see the relation between Sherlock and his brother. “I may not regularly participate in sentiment but I do understand it, at least in this case. My brother-”
One look across the room at Gregory and Mycroft knew he’d received the same phone call. He looked as though he’d aged several years in less than a minute, suddenly pale.
John cursed inwardly when he realized he’d never updated Harry as to the status of his and Sherlock’s relationship. “Uh no actually.” He said.
American. Papa had taken her out and asked her to identify all the tourist’s accents a few times, they went out a lot when Willa’s arm had broken. The last time they’d gone she’d gotten over seventy-five percent of them right. Papa had looked so proud when she’d done that. She was certain Cole was American but Papa wasn’t around to ask.
She tried to say something but it came out mumbled, her mouth not moving the way it was supposed to.
She knew that Daddy and Papa would know by now that she was missing even though she really didn’t know how long she’d been gone for. Willa hoped Aunt Harry was alright and had been able to tell them what had happened. That way Papa could start deducing and find her.
Harry could hear the lecture about food costs stuck in John’s throat. John who looked at anything more than twenty pounds and died a little on the inside. Yet when Sherlock told Willa she could have anything John swallowed down his typical arguments.
John smiled and swallowed harshly, Sherlock watched as his Adam’s apple bobbed in his throat during the motion. “Sometimes I’m not sure about that but thank you.” He then chuckled weakly. “Also we won’t even begin to delve into the psychological implications of naming a skull after yourself.”
“I like cookies.” Sherlock offered. He remembered having cookies on his birthday as a child after the year he declared cake disgusting.
Sherlock changed in the bathroom while John put the lock box away again. Once the door was shut he mentally started berating himself. He’d very nearly ruined the first decent Christmas he’d had in over a decade by not thinking, the one thing he claimed never to do. Luckily for him John assumed he was only able to see things from the objective point of view.
It could have been that everyone else who knew had seen him and Sherlock dance around each other for the past eleven years. They were all too busy sighing in relief to bother to ask technical questions like ‘are you gay?’
She was halfway to the bathroom when Janine called out to her. “Here, change while you’re in there,” she handed a pile of clothing off to Willa.
“I know but I never know when it’s going to become urgent. Some of the most boring cases have turned spectacularly interesting.” Sherlock explained as he stripped down for bed.
John leaned his head on his hands and listened. They made it all the way through scene 1 before Willa’s head began to drop onto Sherlock’s shoulder, her eyes growing heavy.
One night about three years ago John had ventured downstairs, monitor pulled up on his phone, just to check in with the older woman. By some mistake he’d ended up with her cup of tea and that had erased any doubts he’d had that it contained a healthy dose of cannabis. Truthfully he’d slept better than night than he had for years prior but it was still worth teasing her over.
Sometimes it seemed that the only time Mycroft came to Baker Street was when he was the bearer of bad news. Usually, it was regarding the proverbial sword hanging above his or Sherlock’s or even John’s neck. This was the very first time, though, that the sword had swung around to threaten Willa.
He hugged her as she got to them. There was no warmth or particular fondness in their hugs, they were perfunctory. Simply the easiest way for John to determine the state of her sobriety. It wasn’t that John didn’t like his sister, he did when she was sober, but they had never been the hugging kind of family. Their parents had been the same way, reserved in showing their affection. It was why John hugged Willa and Sherlock every chance he got.
They were both still sticky and Sherlock desperately needed to wash himself off but there was something comfortable about laying like this with John.
Two tables filled the center of the room. One empty and the other covered in equipment like breakers, a microscope, and Bunsen burner. The wall of the room that connected to the kitchen had been fitted with locking glass cupboards filled with properly labeled and organized chemicals, he understood now why the kitchen had seemed smaller.
While Sherlock had stayed clear of John’s cock he didn’t feel the same compulsion for his nipples. He flicked his tongue over them relentlessly until John had thrown his head back and was arching off the mattress to chase Sherlock’s mouth with his body. When Sherlock scraped his teeth over one of the already engorged buds John hissed.
He looked around to see what had done it, he hadn’t noticed. There, at his feet, was a teacup lying in pieces with the saucer shattered in a halo around it. A noise involuntarily tore itself from his throat as he pulled his hands away, fully intending to reach down to see which cup it’d been.
Sherlock found John’s stomach, licking a reverse of his favorite path through the trail of hair that led down to his cock. About half way up he trailed off to the right and his tongue found a scar even older than John’s bullet wound. He nudged it with his nose.
The book was soppy and full of imaginative writing about how the child was so important the wind whispered their name. Really not something John normally read to Willa, she understood the Earth didn’t revolve around her, but a bit of birthday sentimentality was to be indulged. John grew misty eyed, despite how he fought against it, half way through the book.
Willa and Addison very nearly kidnapped Teddy from Molly the second they saw him. At eight weeks into parenting, Molly was willing to hover to the side and let them.
His jobs since Moran had pulled him from that holding cell had become less and less sniper work and more and more close combat, even assassination and a smattering of unarmed civilian kills, but never before a child. At least never directly a child.
The first time had been easy enough. Running him about London after a mad poisoner had done the trick but he knew this time it wouldn’t be as easy. Sherlock knew there was very little he could actually do to bring John back if their worst fears had been realized.
He slipped through the door and pulled it securely behind him. As he did Sherlock lowered the metal rod.
John hadn’t had any contact with Mycroft since Willa was a week old. Still for some reason he found himself climbing dutifully into the car, the petty part of him allowed Anthea to argue with the pram without any help.
John laughed. “He’s nervous which is perfectly normal for a dad-to-be, I was terrified. Once the baby is here he’ll have someone to direct all that energy towards.”
Sherlock managed to sit through the entire meeting with Doctor Drescher without any incident. The fact that she offered to set up meetings between Willa’s other teachers and Sherlock (after John’s approval) helped immensely.
Sherlock stepped away from John’s touch. “Your daughter is about to come around that corner, do you want to have this conversation now?”
Sherlock had stayed the night on the sofa, not leaving as he normally did. Willa had awoken before John, her internal clock dragging her awake at six despite it being a weekend. John had woken just past nine and momentarily panicked when he realized she’d not come in and gotten him. Then he heard her and Sherlock in the kitchen.
Sherlock cut in front of John, hand out and gesturing for Mycroft to hand over the file he held at his side. John wondered if Sherlock had been messaging Mycroft in the cab and already knew what was going on.
Willa was cleared for general anesthesia and Sherlock and John took up either side of the bed and stroked her hair as she fell asleep. The nurse, a different one from the woman Sherlock had startled, smiled at them.
“Oh. Well no Sherlock isn’t, not really. Mycroft is Addison’s stepfather because he and Greg married.” John said trying to explain the finer points of familial relationships.
“I can’t…” Sherlock said. “There’s nothing, I can’t…” He wouldn’t finish his sentences but John knew what he was saying. There were no clues on the street, just dozens of people walking past looking on in concern at the increasingly agitated man spinning in circles.
“I’ll go there and call the station on the way and you…” Gregory paused, he was worried and throwing orders out like the Detective Chief Inspector he was. “You find her.” He finished before decisively crossing back over toward Mycroft.
Only two of the presents were actually labeled as being from Mycroft, the others were wrapped in different paper and had no sender. It was obviously Mycroft’s attempt at playing Father Christmas for Willa. She had not surprisingly been more interested in rolling in the wrapping paper than in the frankly terrifying number of presents. Still when Mycroft arrived in the late afternoon she crawled over to him as he sat on the sofa and held out her arms to be picked up. Mycroft lifted her, still slightly uncomfortable with holding a child but getting better at it.
It had been her nervousness though, the constant toying with the hem of her blouse. It wasn’t the kind of nerves someone had after being attacked or even the nerves of an alcoholic needing a drink after a stressful situation. Whatever had been bothering her was something bigger than that, the way she’d seemed surprised when John had reassured her everything was alright. She hadn’t been expecting John to offer her comfort. John and Harry might not have been close but there was no way John would blame her for something like this. John was more likely to blame himself and self-destruct while trying to pinpoint exactly what he could have done to change things.
“Fine.” Sherlock interrupted with a grin. “Have whatever you like.” He looked meaningfully at both John and Harry, as if to say that directive was meant for them as well. Sherlock had clearly not been raised to understand the value of money.
If he weren’t so tired Greg would be annoyed. Everyone in the roomed seemed to be forgetting that he was a detective and damn good one too. There was a time in his life when his husband didn’t practically run the government and his brother in law wasn’t a slightly mad ‘consulting’ detective.
Sherlock pointedly rolled his eyes at the camera and went back to looking at the papers on Willa’s desk. Most were drawings though a good number had stories written on the back. For her age they were quite good and she was very fond of writing about a little girl detective.
Sherlock didn’t sleep that night. He had left Baker street with every intention of walking straight to the hotel but as he past Regent’s Park he turned and found himself wandering through it. At first there was no purpose to his detour until he spotted a homeless man walking ahead of him. This one had to be new to the lifestyle because it was far too cold and too late for any of the veterans to be out. Sherlock approached the man, handed him some notes and directed him towards the nearest warm place from memory.
“I don’t need to see papers. You’re probably the only person I’d believe saying that to me.” John said.
She gave a short nod and turned to leave, but before she reached the door, she turned to Greg. "Would you like anything, Detective Lestrade?"
Reluctantly John blinked awake. “I nearly forgot.” He confessed. He carefully untangled his hand from Willa’s hair and then shook her shoulder. “Willa.”
Sherlock did not answer her and hoped John would soon retrieve his offspring and remove her from the room. John, however, did not move.
Papa’s voice echoed around in her head. He’d once said that about the toilets at a shop when the didn’t have an automatic flush.
When it was time for cupcakes Sherlock pushed into the kitchen to help. He noticed John nodding at Willa behind his back while he argued the number 6 candle into the cake, it kept toppling.
“Good.” John nodded, hands now rubbing idle circles along Sherlock’s forearms. Sherlock closed his eyes against the sensation of John’s hands on his body.  “That’s good.” John repeated
John hadn’t ever not known where Willa was for more than a few minutes. Before Sherlock, there had possibly never been a moment where he couldn’t have told you exactly where she was. Since Sherlock had come back, John had relaxed because surely if Willa wasn’t with him then she was definitely off with her Papa getting into trouble.
Greg shrugged. “We were getting the other kids bikes, Teddy needed something with wheels too.” He rationalized.
John pulled out his mobile and then went over to join Willa by the doors. Once Sherlock was behind them he nodded at her.
“Who approached you?” Mycroft asked from behind John. It was first he’d noticed that Mycroft and Greg had followed them into the room.
There was no one else in the restroom when they got there and Aunt Harry pushed her into one of the littler stalls. Willa rolled her eyes even though no one could see her. Why did grownups push children around like they didn’t have any idea how to find the toilet?
Sherlock was sure he was pouting, just going off the amused look on John’s face but he stood. “I will spend an entire two hours exploring your cock.” He promised, whispering into John’s ear.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “If she has a tutor why does she attend a school that gives her work far below her standard?”
Sherlock scowled at her. “So you’ve decided to make Mary your enemy?” He asked and stepped into her line of sight. He might be furious with John but he wasn’t about to let her wind him up to doing something he might regret.
John made it exactly three hours before sending the text. He’d noted the time he got on the train and made sure to wait at least three hours. At least… if not exactly.
Greg sighed. “I don’t want to hear it, Sherlock. If he’s doing something illegal just leave me out of it.”
“Sherlock,” John said from somewhere behind him, he was close enough that Sherlock wasn’t worried about losing him.
Though now that there was something that might have been news Mycroft found himself loath to wake his husband. He wasn’t honestly sure if the phone call was actually news, perhaps it had just been an empty update paired with a concussion that had set Harriet Watson off.
She squealed again and threw herself at him for another hug. When she finished with him she nearly tackled John with the same level of enthusiasm.
“Wasn’t he the one with the divorcing parents?” Sherlock asked and John was surprised that he remembered that detail.
It was a stupid question. John would never have allowed Willa to ask him if he wasn’t serious but the fact that he’d already gotten the papers taken care of that was when Sherlock realized exactly how serious John was.
When the photographer called for a family only photo John had swooped in to retrieve his daughter from where she was playing with Addison. He’d gotten halfway to the dessert table, fully intending to bribe her into behaving with sweets, when Mycroft called out to him.
Greg nodded. “Alright so one person held her and the other one knocked out Harry.” He repeated trying to get a picture of what had happened. “So how’d they get her out without an entire restaurant noticing?”
He was thinking about the last Christmas he’d spent with anyone. That had been the Christmas he’d shot Magnessen to protect John. Sherlock had purposefully avoided the holiday in the following years, not that it would have mattered he was only a ghost then. The idea of spending the day at his brother’s house with everyone was causing panic to well up in his chest. There was no way he was going to spend the day in hell like that.
The bathroom didn’t look any nicer than the other room. Parts of the wall were peeling off and inside the sink was black even though the rest of it was supposed to be white. There were jugs of water sitting along the side of the bath tub. Janine put her things down in the sink and grabbed Willa by the shoulders steering her to sit on top of the closed toilet lid.
Once John regained composure he favored Sherlock with a smile. “God I’ve missed you saying things like that.”
Which was exactly how John ended up in the ‘just the family’ photo wearing a particularly misty eyed expression. Greg teased him over it for months.
“We’ll make our statements, Greg.” John told him, there was an undercurrent of steel in his tone, replacing the horrible flat affect from earlier. “And we’ll clear this scene but we won’t just wait at home.”
The fireworks went off louder than Sherlock had thought possible. He might have minded except for the look on John’s face. Somehow this man, who was well in his forties, managed to look like a child watching the first blooms of color unfurl above them. People around them were still calling out ‘Happy New Year’ when John tore his eyes away from the sky.
Willa flashed him a grin when he told her to pick anything off the menu. Not surprisingly she chose a burger and chips which John eyed longingly as he picked at the sensible salad he’d ordered. With any luck she wouldn’t finish all of her chips.
John licked and sucked him until he was hard, until Sherlock’s fingernails were biting into the leather upholstery of the chair, and then he pulled off.
“Alright come here.” Sherlock said and put the thermometer down for later. He carried her into his bedroom, he dug through John’s drawers until he found a plain t-shirt. He handed it over to Willa.
Sherlock pulled back and realized what John was saying. “How long has it been?” He asked and slowly began stroking him.
He’d had Harry looked into shortly after John had moved in with Sherlock and he’d had her looked into more closely just before John returned to London with Willa. She was mostly unremarkable as far as people went. Three years older than John with a petty criminal record stretching back into her early teens, no doubt her form of rebellion against their father.
“Doctor Watson I am so sorry, that was entirely inappropriate.” Mr. West apologized taking a step back towards his classroom looking like he wanted to hide.
Suddenly John’s hips snapped forward, head thrown and his mouth hung open with a wordless cry. Sherlock could feel him pulsing inside of him, coming hard.
John sighed and leaned against the wardrobe. “This is hardly dressing nice for you Sherlock and because it’s respectful.”
Willa bounced into the living room when she got home, shoes trailing behind her and she threw off her coat. Upon seeing Sherlock in his chair she went over to him.
John smiled and nipped at the inside of Sherlock’s pale thigh. Sherlock’s hips arched up, thrusting into empty air.
“Sherlock, there’s not enough evidence to support it even does anything.” John said and tried to stifle his laughter behind his hand.
John watched as Sherlock’s back disappeared down the street, chasing after his network of the homeless. As soon as he was no longer in site John turned and walked towards the main road to hail a cab. It took a while but eventually someone stopped for him. John climbed into the back and directed the man to Baker street.
Sherlock pulled back and rested a hand on the kitten. “John and I thought you were ready for a pet. It’s not a goat but I think this will do.”
She’d fallen into the bottle early, barely into her teens. She’d somehow managed to get into university but failed out in her first term. She never went back and instead spent her life shifting from shop positions to temp agencies and then back again. She’d met her future ex-wife in 2000, the relationship had been rocky from the start, but Clara had stuck by her through two stays in rehab. They eventually married in 2005 while John was home on leave, him being one of the few people to attend their wedding. The divorce came four years later after alleged infidelity on Harry’s part.
Sherlock was examining a photo of Willa on the mantel when John reappeared. Sherlock made no acknowledgement of him and he could feel John’s eyes on him.
She had no contacts to anyone even remotely connected to Moriarty or Mary Morstan (Mycroft still hadn’t managed to discover her proper name). She only got into trouble when she drank, hardly a career criminal.
Sherlock turned slightly in his seat. Whatever they’d been discussing while Greg’s back was turned didn’t seem to have improved John’s temper any.
John turned towards the stove and messed with the kettle so Sherlock couldn’t see his smile. “Why would I be lying? We are very happy she’s got the cast off. Aren’t you?”
During one such conversation Willa dashed between them and up the stairs, not heeding John’s calls to take off her boots. He shook his head and assumed she’d just realized she needed the toilet. When she returned though she had in her hands five bowls, his metal measuring cups, craft sticks and the box of food dyes.
Sherlock had feared cheating at first, a thought that had been crawling in the dark recesses of his mind since John had gone to Wales. Except John was barely leaving the house for anything other than work and on the rare occasions he left alone there was never any sign of infidelity. John certainly never seemed any more pleasant after he got back.
“In any other scenario Isabelle would have been the mistress but no your mistress is older, most likely as old as you are going by her perfume, not someone a celebrity manager would be dating.” Sherlock clarified for them.
Right now he was gorgeous and flushed, molded into the bed. His hair was mussed from running hands through it and his chest and cheeks were flushed with arousal. He was watching Sherlock with blown eyes.
Sherlock found himself surprised once again. “His marriage?” He wasn’t sure what he had thought but since learning of Mary’s disappearance he’d not speculated as to how the marriage had ended.
Willa finished her cake with minimal mess and as she wiped her hands Harry stood. “I’m going to pop into the loo before we’re finished. Willa do you need to go?”
“Because I am not a patient man and I will not be held accountable for what I do if you remove any more clothing.” Sherlock warned him with a carefully neutral tone.
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked at his partner. “John, I would have said something if you were hurting me.”
“This is the second time this week you’ve gone out after Willa’s gone to bed.” Sherlock informed him.
By the time he too stripped down out of his old clothes and found his way into the kitchen, John had set out a glass of apple juice and paracetamol for Sherlock and was halfway through his own glass.
Willa nodded even though John hadn’t told her he’d called her off sick. “It’s my birthday and we’ve made cupcakes.”
Sherlock’s back tensed in surprise for just a moment beneath John’s hands before he melted into the embrace. His own arms came up to wrap around John and he rested his forehead against his shoulder.
By the groan and eye roll it didn’t. “You were worried yesterday but didn’t mention anything to me.” Sherlock said as if that explained everything. Which, John guessed, it did.
Halfway through diagnosing the third ear infection of the day John remembered the conversation they’d been having right before Sherlock got upset. John had told him Molly was babysitting. Had that been what upset Sherlock? Had he wanted to watch Willa?
Lisa and Victor Long were crowded around their son’s bed looking distraught. A young girl, not much older than Willa sat in the corner and watched everything with shiny wide eyes. John introduced them and Sherlock noted he purposely affixed his ‘doctor’ title when he did.
Just after Sherlock had dropped the charity bags off his phone rang. He had, given the time, expected it to be John letting him know he was done and would be heading for the train in a little. Instead it was Willa’s school. It was odd because she’d been fine that morning and the pollen count wasn’t high enough to cause her problems through her medicine.
As they disappeared a car came to idle beside him. Sherlock rolled his eyes though he doubted even his brother would see it and climbed in.
Once they were done they splinted her arm up and tucked it inside the sling again. Sherlock considered the risks of carrying Willa and decided despite his need to calm her it was best if he didn’t. Though once they were back in the room he settled onto the bed and let her sit in his lap, her injured side turned out to keep it safe.
Willa was next. Upon hearing Mycroft’s voice she jumped up from where she was playing and dove for him, wrapping her arms around his legs. “Uncle Mycroft!” She squealed. “Have you brought me a present?”
Sherlock stopped instantly, even with his own mind in raging turmoil he knew better than to push a distraught John Watson. That could very seriously end with himself in the hospital and that would only be if John was practicing self-control.
Willa was out of her chair in a flash grabbing her coat, thrilled she was going with them on one of their investigations.
When Willa began speaking beyond ‘Dada’ and ‘milk’ John often wondered what highly inappropriate words Sherlock would try to teach her. Which was how John found himself with an eighteen-month-old who knew the word ‘Detective.’
Greg shook his head, "I'm good," he lied. He was dying for a coffee but always felt out of place asking for something from one of Mycroft's assistants.
After the voice, now cowed by his unusual display of anger, assented to his terms, Greg hung up and looked over to his husband who was watching him with a carefully neutral face.
“Yes.” Sherlock answered and stretched out so his feet were on John’s lap. John made a noise and swatted at them with his book but didn’t tell him to move.
Just as he was reaching for the remote to turn on the television his phone vibrated on the table next to him.
Their suite was done tastefully in dark wood and upholstery but light colored bedding. This was exactly the kind of room he could see Sherlock in, which was probably why it had been picked. The bathtub was approximately the size of their entire bathroom at Baker Street. Of course there was an equally large shower with enough fixtures to be confusing. John stared at it long and hard, imagining all the things he wanted to do to Sherlock in it.
Sherlock had planned on spending the next day in the office. He was working on a way to lure clients while somehow managing to keep the lunatics away, so far he hadn’t found a decent solution. When he walked out into the kitchen he found both John and Willa dressed for the day. This was odd because ti wasn’t even eight on a Saturday, some weekend days Willa didn’t even bother to change at all.
Sherlock moved methodically down first, his right thigh, stopping to pay attention to the joint behind John’s knee. John had always known how sensitive that spot was, particularly in hand to hand combat, but he’d never experienced how erotic it was. Already wound up from the rimming he moaned and thrust into the mattress. Sherlock then continued down again, biting softly at the Achilles tendon.
As he hailed a cab John stuffed his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels. “So any ideas of what to do tonight?”
“None.” Sherlock spat in disgust. “She left her flat of her own free will, though of course it was hard to tell because the morons at the yard had dug around it.”
John turned his phone off after sending his final text, he didn’t need to worry about anything other than getting through this evening.
Sherlock followed where he was point and blinked, a few time actually, surprised at what he was seeing. There was something hanging from one of the rear windows of the building. Some of the water from the hoses had dampened it and caused it to cling to the side, but it appeared otherwise intact.
Mycroft nodded. “Yes, seems he made a noose out of his own trousers and waited to hang himself until after the last check of the night.”
John worked a half day on Thursday, he was thankful. It kept his mind off the possible date he and Sherlock were going on. The furthest he’d gotten with planning was thinking they’d find the least packed pub and spend the evening there. By the time they’d agreed to go out on New Year’s Eve everything had already been booked, a pub was the best they would do.
Tossing the bottle behind Sherlock’s shoulder John climbed onto the bed after him, urging him futher back until Sherlock’s head was nearly off the other side.
“Molly was for three of them, now that she’s on leave they’ve got in a new guy, Golden, to do them.” Greg turned to John then. “You seen her?”
Emma, Noah’s mother, was surrounded by her family as everyone stood around the too small casket perched above the earth. Then there was the father’s family, standing far off to the side. Even those from the school had cleared away from them. It angered John and he found himself fixating on it. It wasn’t like those people had killed Noah, they’d just been related to the man who had. They were not only grieving for their loved one but were also in shock over learning someone else they loved was a killer.
Sherlocked had worked them up to a steady rhythm. It wasn’t enough to get either of them off but enough to build the tension. Sherlock’s cock was leaking, untouched, onto John’s stomach mingling with the other man’s come there.
“She left shortly after you, we assumed to continue her surveillance, we’d hope to catch her in the act but she disappeared.” He explained as he took a seat on one of the iron garden chairs.
“I believe I just receive the ‘hurt him and I’ll hurt you’ speech from your daughter.” Sherlock said and he sounded genuinely entertained by the fact.
Neither of them spoke during the entire cab ride to the hospital. John didn’t dare open his mouth right now, certainly not in the back of a cab. He wasn’t sure what the cause of Sherlock’s silence was especially since he hadn’t explained what was going, but he was grateful for it on some level. Sherlock being quiet meant he didn’t have to answer and that was going to keep him from appearing insane, even it was for just a few more minutes.
Irene had taken it upon herself to follow both John and Sherlock’s exploits after she’d ‘died’. They were much more fun than any television programme. She never claimed to have big brother’s skills of tracking and monitoring but her job put her in positions to illicit favors from some other very powerful people in the world.
Sherlock even willingly went to the shop when he realized they’d need extra supplies for baking their cupcakes. Willa wanted strawberry cupcakes and Sherlock had spent over an hour the previous day looking for a recipe that used real strawberries. She was also insistent upon purple icing but regular sugar icing mixed with purple food dye would work.
Janine laughed, but it wasn't a funny laugh, it made Willa's stomach roll and not feel right. "There are millions and millions of kids, you need to get over it."
“Irish?” Sherlock asked, his head lifting up like he had an idea. Harry nodded and watched as Sherlock tore his phone from his pocket. Both John and she waited as he did whatever it was he was doing.
“Well if Sherlock adopted you, which would be a bit different than what Molly did, he would be just… your other father I guess.” John explained. It was a difficult process to describe to anyone, much less a child.
Greg paused outside the door, there wasn’t enough space for him to enter as well without brushing up against surfaces. He imagined that was why there was a queue of cops and forensic officers waiting behind him.
“This is Lestrade, and I don’t give a fuck,” he punctuated the word with a punch to the roof of the car, “what you think, you need to pull Dr. Hooper off right now.”
He was close enough to Baker Street around eight to watch from a distance as John and Willa left for the day. They were both utterly unobservant and didn’t notice his observations. She was in her school uniform hair neatly held back by a black band and John by his dress was heading into the surgery. She was talking animatedly while John attempted to tie a scarf around her neck. He spent a full two minutes before finally succeeding in wrapping the purple scrap of wool. Then they were off hand in hand down the street.
“Yeah, sorry about that. How about I make it up to you?” John offered as he stood by the door, pushing his hands into his pocket.
As it turned out she was none too pleased to discover that Sherlock had resumed his life at 221B and he and John were very obviously carrying on with one another. She’d moved Cole Gilbert into London in February after their getaway and then in March came Janine Hawkins. That was when Irene felt stepping in was necessary, Mary only used Janine when things became personal.
Sherlock pulled the computer away and skimmed through the article. It was short but included phrases such as “overheard intimate moments” and “confirmation of long speculated romance”.
“Try? You’ll try,” Harry laughed breathlessly. “Try? Why the hell would I tell you anything for that?”
His face was very much the same and an irrational part of John wanted to smack him. Of course Sherlock would be the type of person to age gracefully and without wrinkles or grey hair. There was a scar through the edge of his right eyebrow, it was old and hadn’t been sutured well when the injury had occurred. His cheekbones were more prominent than they had been and John, for the first time, agreed with The Woman. You could injure yourself on those cheeks as they were now.
Mycroft took the paper, not bothering to look up from the laptop he was now navigating. He glanced at the sheet for a few moments before putting it down, returning his full attention to the computer screen. Greg waited with eyebrows raised for the update.
“John, really.” Sherlock said rolling his eyes against John’s objections, it was painfully obvious that Mason Cooper had not come from Luke.
John rolled his eyes, pursing his lips together, and didn’t bother answering. It was an old argument. He turned instead to find Sherlock.
John nodded knowingly. “You saw red and all you could think about was making him disappear so he could never even get to think about her again.”
“I know it’s stupid that I’ve been hanging onto this, especially since your back.” John said dropping the box onto the table with a thunk. “But I haven’t found the time to give it back to you.”
“Exactly. So why would the boy’s blood sugar levels continue rising even though he was getting the insulin he needed? How would he have gotten nicotine poisoning?”
Sherlock was about to scream in frustration but he took a deep breath and looked across at the children playing. First, irrationally, at all of the children at the playground and then closer at the Cooper children. And then…
“John you’ve been moving the money from Sherlock’s trust into a savings account for the past year.” Mycroft said easily as if this weren’t an entirely new revelation.
There was a single window in the room, opposite the toilet, and Willa realized she couldn’t be seen from the other room when she stood at it. The handed was rusted and the wood and paint crumbled when she touched the sill.
Suddenly there was a sharp kick to his shin and when Sherlock finally began processing stimulus outside of his brain he saw John jerking his head towards Willa.  She was still looking at Sherlock with such hope in her eyes but her smile had fallen just a little.
“Sherlock had left for his trip, we didn’t know you were going to be born so soon.” John said carefully, looking up at Sherlock who was watching them closely.
Greg sighed and recaptured his balance. He turned to the sea of gridlocked people lining up behind him. “Alright, get to work!” He yelled and despite this not actually being his crime scene, everyone listened.
There was a pinched look on Irene’s face and she huffed. “I’ll go, as you wish, though I expect you want me to find your daughter for you while I’m away?” Her hands were still on Sherlock’s shoulders.
Sherlock saw John shift uncomfortably out of the corner of his eye, no doubt trying to come up with a viable reason. “Was he losing?” John asked.
“Any ideas of who’s doing it?” Lestrade asked as he sank back into his chair after making the phone calls.
She looked startled under the force of his gaze. “She fell off the equipment at the playground. According to her teacher she lost consciousness for a little over a minute, we believe her arm to be fractured but she needs to go up for x-ray.”
They crossed the bridge and the jogger had turned left, this would be a true test to see if he was correct. Willa turned left as well but Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and steered them towards the right and back towards Baker Street.
“There is plenty of anecdotal evidence and besides not enough actual studies have been done on the subject.” Sherlock protested sounding offended at John’s laughter.
Sherlock didn’t grimace or scowl for the photo. Either he was afraid Molly would slap him or it was an effort to please her, John wasn’t sure which. As soon as she turned Sherlock glared daggers at him behind her back, John just took his own photo.
He’d manipulated Lestrade literally hundreds of times and never felt any guilt over it before. So it definitely wasn’t that. The only other option was the fact that he’d used Willa to do it. He hadn’t lied to Lestrade about Willa, Noah really was her classmate. While she didn’t actually know he’d been murdered yet, this would still affect her whenever she found out.
He pulled away after a moment and then came back with a warm wet flannel to clean them up with. John cleaned himself and then pushed Sherlock back over to his back. He was so gentle and tender as he cleaned Sherlock. It was a whole other level of intimate and Sherlock had to squeeze his eyes shut against the onslaught emotions.
“Hard to be sacrilegious when one isn’t actually religious, brother, besides it is tradition.” Mycroft told them.
Greg looked up at her and she noticed that Mycroft was also there, looking a lot less put together than she was used to seeing him.
Sherlock growled at his phone and barely resisted the urge to slam it against the wall. John was watching him, having finished his conversation with Lestrade.
John hugged her downstairs and didn’t smell any booze so he allowed her up to the landing. Sherlock was looming over head, arms crossed trying to make himself look more imposing.
Irene finally sat down, intentionally choosing Sherlock’s chair. She wasn’t surprised the dumb thing was still here after all these years, John probably would have gone completely mental on anyone trying to take it from him. “I don’t know. Shall we ask John?”
Willa kept kicking but then her legs began to feel weird, like when she was swimming. Her head got dizzy too.
John nodded. “She is and honestly I don’t think we’ll be doing this next year but tomorrow please just grin and bear it. It makes her happy.”
He and Sherlock had wordlessly agreed to keep the newest development from Willa. She still hadn’t cried yet. When they spoke about Noah and his death she would adapt a flat affect and it worried John to no end. Sherlock had disappeared after one such conversation and when he reappeared, an hour later, he’d purchased a book on grief for children.
On Tuesday John was paying bills while Sherlock showered when he realized there was a problem. Sherlock’s allowance had cleared into his bank account that morning. Mycroft had either forgotten about changing it back or simply hadn’t gotten around to it, either way it made John look at his finances a little closer than he had in years.
“Because she needs to be bored every now and then. She needs to learn how to cope with boredom in a healthy way. She needs to learn to interact with people. Her…” John stopped and struggled with what to say. “She just needs to learn that life isn’t always interesting.”
Sherlock had expected a few more questions and perhaps some resistance to letting him back to see her. Given her reaction there was a very good possibility Mycroft had anticipated this as well and called ahead.
“My brother wouldn’t kill his son. He was the kind of dad who dropped everything for his kids. He was trying to win full custody of Noah and Lydia. Why would he kill Noah?” Lukas pleaded.
Greer nodded. “Yes. I got in last night the police insisted I return to the country because of this whole mess. Knowing Belle they’ll find her in Monaco with alcohol poisoning in a few days.”
She found Mycroft and Greg in nearly the exact spot she’d left them. This time she sat down on the floor and waited.
John sighed and leaned into the hug. “I know, I just hate the idea of you going out without backup on case.”
“So I was wondering what you were doing on Thursday?” She asked. John could faintly hear a saw in the background and wondered what Aaron was attempting to fix now.
Some nights, even long after all the other nightmares of war had faded, he was still able to hear her screams when he finally pulled the boy from her.
Sherlock looked back to the counter. There was one of Willa’s cups, half drank, near where his phone had been.
Sherlock cleared his throat and spoke for the first time since the conversation had started. “Willa even if anything would happen between John and I, I would still see you as much as possible.” He promised before turning to John for confirmation.
Sherlock looked away again. “I’m not jealous I’m just…” he wasn’t sure where he was going with that statement. He took a breath and began again. “I return after six years and John’s life revolves around her, as it rightfully should, but yours does as well and I would bet money Mrs. Hudson is positively obsessed with the girl. By all rights she appears to be the most interesting person in London.”
Thursday was the night Sherlock decided to start opening up about where he’d been for the last six years. John found he needed considerably more to drink after this night.
John tried to read any clues from where Sherlock was driving him. The only thing he got from this was that they were headed back into London.
Greg, sensing the danger the DS had put himself in, had pulled him aside and given him what John recognized as the number to Mycroft’s office. Where there possibly was an actual filing cabinet containing the numerous threats to John and Sherlock.
Isabelle Durant twenty-three had been missing for just over three days. She was the only child of Sidney Durant who owned hundreds of computer processor plants in Europe and Asia.
Sherlock made a distressed noise at the unspoken inferences. “You’ve still not answered my question.”
Willa was so excited she bounced on her toes. “Daddy lets me read some of the stories on his blog! They’re all about you, you know? And how you’re a brilliant detective. Sometimes if I’m very good he tells me secret stories that he says he can’t put on the internet.”
John straightened up so abruptly that he shoved Sherlock’s chair into the desk. “So this is all we’ve got to go on?” He was agitated, “bits of useless video and a polite kidnapper?”
Willa did and they instantly dropped down to the ball of fur on her. She let out a gasp. “Oh my gosh.” She said in such a reverent tone. John thumbed the shutter button on his phone repeatedly, heard several other phones doing the same thing.
