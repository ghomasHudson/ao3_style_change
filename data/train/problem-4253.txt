Dean headed back towards the motel and silently sat on the bed. He set his head in his hands and his back rose and fell shakily as he struggled to fight back tears. After he regained his composure, he blinked and lifted his head.
Sam pondered. They would have to do some more digging around to see if there were any abandoned places a vampire nest would be at. But that wouldn't be too hard - they'd done it a million times already.
Sam and Jack stared wide-eyed at him, but understanding slowly settled in. It was the most logical place to look at that point, even if they wanted to deny it. Jack took a deep breath and helped Sam up.
At that point, Castiel didn't even care if Dean reciprociated his feelings. His heart utterly shattered at seeing how much he had broken Dean by trying to do the heroic thing. He had tried going out like a hero and giving Dean the motivation to continue on. But this effort was lost on Dean.
She nodded excitedly. He pulled out a chair for her and then took his own next to her. Jack sat on the other end and stared in wonder. They hadn't had this much homemade food since Mrs. Butters was there a long time ago. His mouth salviated as he realized just how hungry he was. It seemed that he hadn't eaten in days because of his crippling worry over Dean.
Five long minutes passed. Five minutes of them watching Dean as he struggled to breathe and cry out in terror at virtually nothing. Five minutes of Dean being his most vulnerable and most terrified in his entire life. Only five minutes, but it seemed longer than eternity. When it finally stopped, he collapsed on the bed and frazzled out like a dying light.
Sam mumbled something into his arms, but Castiel was already searching for the next part of their trial.
He continued to sift through Dean's trauma and memories, searching for just about anything that could give them a clue as to where Dean's soul was. He didn't want to have to go through everything one at a time, but at this rate they wouldn't be able to find anything even if they looked for a year. There was just so much built up in Dean that it seemed to swallow everything it touched. Plus he didn't want Sam to have to witness anymore of this. Just seeing what John did to Dean had already broken part of him. He couldn't let Sam see what Dean saw half the time. It would break both of them if they ever found out.
Now that God was powerless, he and Sam now had free will over their lives, something that they had wanted since they were basically forced into existence. Now, they could do whatever the hell they wanted with no reigns on them. Well, as much as he hated to admit it, Dean wanted to do Cas. It took a great amount of time for him to admit that even to himself, but it was a truth he could't escape.
Jack also voiced his agreement with Sam and they proceeded to stare hard daggers at the befuddled angel.
Unfamiliar scars littered every square space of it aside from the long gashes that apparently his fingernails had caused. His hair seemed to have fallen out in clumps, but somehow it had grown back a little bit to its original shape. Probably from angelic grace or magic voodoo, but if so, when did that happen? Dean's confusion was evergrowing as he focused on everything ranging from the scars to the starvation to the painful stabbing sensation he felt in his head and stomach. Everything hurt a fuckton. What he wouldn't give to sink his teeth into a fat and juicy burger at that moment.
"Ok you know what Dean? I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I'm leaving. I'm done. I'm so fucking done."
Now, as the three of them continued to laugh and enjoy their lunch, that feeling slowly faded. Sure, it was still there, and it hurt, but Castiel knew that soon enough Dean would be with them. He would join them and crack his unintelligent jokes and make fun of Sam and do all the things that made him Dean. Dean Winchester, the beautiful hunter that caused even angels to fall in love with him.
"My grace won't work on him. There's too much darkness in his mind. I don't know how we'll heal him, but it will be a long process. For now, we need to restrain him as comfortably as possible and work out a plan."
When the tension was released in his arms, Dean wasted no time and continued to lacerate any exposed skin he could find with his long fingernails.
He gently layed Dean down on the spare bed and watched sadly as Sam gently tied pieces of firm but soft cloth around Dean's arms and legs. It was the best they could do at the time. It wasn't like they had fuzzy handcuffs laying around everywhere. At least if he struggled with the cloth, he wouldn't injure himself further.
Dean's once wide eyes were now gently fluttering like a butterfly's wings. He struggled to keep them open until finally he couldn't anymore. He gently fell asleep in less than five seconds, leaving a bewildered Castiel to watch his chest rise and fall with small breaths.
The painful memory still burned in Castiel's head, but he shoved it out of the way and focused on the task at hand. He thought for a moment. He had hoped that they wouldn't have to go to this particular memory, but they had to. Everything else seemed devoid of Dean's presence, so this place would be the last that they would have to journey to. Castiel's wings tingled a tiny bit as he thought about it. He didn't want to go. By God he had hoped that Dean's soul would be anywhere but there. But it wasn't meant to be.
And just when the three of them felt like they couldn't witness this tragic tale anymore, Castiel and Jack felt it. Barely there and so faint that it was almost nonexistant, but there it was shining and it was beautiful.
"Jack, if you're out there. Please. Please just bring him back. I'm begging you." Silence. Of course. Jack was ignoring everything now. "Jack. Please. I can't go on without him. I'm trying man, I'm actually trying. But I can't. I need that stupid angel in my life. I admit it, I'm in love with him, so please just bring him back." Still more silence. Dean wanted to punch a wall in anger but he took a deep breath and continued. He closed his eyes, sat on his bed, and bent his head down.
He laughed again but that laugh was his last as Jack's emotions were roused. Dean? Going through all of that? His second father, Dean Winchester was put through all of this torture? And for what? Dean didn't deserve that. He didn't deserve any of this.
These feelings arose after Jack had left Sam and Dean for a short period of time. He waved goodbye and disappeared with the intention of fixing everything. Well, that's exactly what he did. He fixed Heaven, took down the walls, and made everything up there good again. He also fixed Rowena's Hell problems - something that didn't take a lot of effort. All he really had to do was think about his problems and viable solutions, and voila, it was done. Everything was okey dokey.
These attacks had affected Dean so much that he had to seal them off with the other traumatic memories. Of course he did. The attacks were the results of his fear of being abandoned. A fear that was so great that it trumped nearly all of his other fears.
No. It was too late. The past had already been written. All he could do now is focus on the future and hope for Dean's healing to turn out good. That was the only thing he could do. Have faith in Castiel and Jack.
Yes, and even when Dean was the spitting image of his abusive father, Castiel still found himself loving the man. Dean was most definitely not the caring person that he could have been if he had a "normal life." Dean could be abusive himself, even without his knowing. It wasn't his fault at all, but he had spent so long trying to get his father's approval that John's personality imprinted itself on Dean.
Upon realizing Sam who was struggling to process the sudden upsurge of emotion, Castiel and Jack patted him on the shoulders empathetically. They knew that Sam had never witnessed this firsthand, so he would take a while to process it. Castiel silently wished that he hadn't brought them here, but it was necessary if they were to ever find the remnants of Dean's soul.
Castiel sensed the sudden change in Dean's breathing. With inhuman speed, he raced over to Dean and he witnessed the man he loved experiencing a panic attack. He set his fingers to his forehead, but he still couldn't get through to the root of the problem, Dean's Athazagoraphobia. It was very obvious that Dean possessed this certain phobia, but it was so deepset into Dean's trauma that he couldn't fix it, thus not being able to comfort Dean in his attack on his mind.
Jack imagined as hard as he could. In his mind, he lifted the wall just ever so slightly and let a little bit of power creep into his veins. He felt the tug, but it was only miniscule pull compared to the harsh one before. It was one that he could control.
When Castiel had awaken, angels had flocked to him, accusing and threatening him. But none had the strength nor motivation to even raise a finger against him. After all, they were all technically dead. What good would it do to just "kill" again? Absolutely nothing. All they could do was hopelessly meander and talk amongst themselves, wondering and waiting for their fate. What Castiel was concerned about was the location of The Shadow. It was definitely awake and unhappy, but it was nowhere to be seen as far as Castiel could tell. Perhaps it was beating up another angel trying to find the location of Jack.
Jack tried to protest, but he thought against it. He stood up and staggered a little, but he caught his footing and slowly headed off towards the main room to find Sam.
"We got into an argument. A really big one. It was probably as intense as the one we had on the night I left... After Dean died and left me alone, I teamed up with a demon named Ruby to get him back. Well, when he returned from Hell after you rescued him." He gestured towards Castiel. "He was really shaken up, and I understand that. But I didn't have any choices at the time and Ruby was my best bet. Anyway we got into a big fight and I stormed out. I realize now that I was childish, but godammit I was pissed alright?"
Excuses, Dean. Excuses. He's just a liability to you. Before Cas came, everything was fine. Now that he's here, your life has gone to shit. It's no longer just you and Sam. He's there. And he screws everything up.
Despite his flaws, Castiel still loved the dense and sometimes stupid man. That was who Dean thought he was. All the self-loathing, disappointment, isolation, and every other negative emotion that a single person could feel was who Dean was. Cas had tried his damn hardest to convince Dean otherwise, but the feelings were there to stay. They had cultivated for too long, left bottled up and unattended. They plastered themselves to his soul and weakened his already fragile state of being. Those cruel feelings that were not true, but had been there for so long that had almost become truth.
With this, Sam's heart stopped. He glanced down at the other two, who were equally as shocked. Castiel? But he was in The Empty, Dean had told him so! Sam recalled Dean's tragic story of how The Empty had come with its black tendrils and took Castiel and Billie away, never to be seen again.  He called down to Jack,
When everything escaped, Dean's soul escaped as well and he was left in disbelief and sorrow as he wandered the confines of his mind. He had a vague idea of the events that had just passed, even if it wasn't fully him that was out there.
"If he's fine like he says he is, then we don't have anything to worry about. Come on. Cas you wanna go?"
He threw off the angel and the literal god and knocked over the medroom's table and scurried into a corner, eyes wide in sheer terror and pain. They were already bloodshot and seemingly bulging out of their sockets.
"Cas, you're in no shape to be going anywhere. Besides, why would you want to go? I mean... I thought you were trying to heal Dean? Ya know? Don't you think that going on a monster hunt could be detrimental to that cause?" He stated with a raised eyebrow.
That was the first time the three of them had genuinely laughed in over a year, and it was a goddamn beautiful feeling. The laughter soon died out, but the smiles remained plastered to faces.
The urge was so, so tempting. Right now, he could have everything he ever wanted and just be with Dean for one night. One night of nothing but the two of them and their love fusing them together. One night and they could be lovers like he'd always wanted.
A witch arrived and placed a curse on him, causing him to feel pain more profusely, by at least tenfold. The screams became even more louder and painful. They only laughed harder and cut deeper.
Jack's anger boiled over. As he was keeping Dean's soul alive, he was also listening to Boian's speech and his anger just... Exploded.
Castiel's face flushed a little but he turned towards the other two, waiting for their reactions. Sam just looked stupified but Jack looked very worried and confused, as always. Dean then raised his eyebrows at the two of them and Sam threw up his hands in exasperation.
But those concerns quickly dissolved as the night went on, alcohol consumption rose, and lust ran high. Surprisingly, Castiel was the one who made the first move, grabbing man #1 by the shirt and giving him a sloppy but greedy kiss. The man was taken by surprise, but he quickly melted into it as he stared at Castiel's beautiful angelic face. Man #2 didn't want to be left out and quickly joined in, creating a three-way kiss that was arguably the hottest thing Castiel had ever experienced in his life, well maybe a close second behind seeing Dean Winchester's bare ass that one time, which resulted in an immediate hard-on from his vessel.
"Dean. You are in the Bunker. Sam is here along with Jack and I, Castiel. You are safe. There are no monsters here."
"Thankfully, I remembered where the Bunker was. I just prayed that you were still here, but thankfully you are. How long was I gone?"
Skin and flesh peeled off like a banana peel. An especially insane monster carved out his cheeks and mouth so that his teeth and gumline were fully exposed like a freak monster.
One dick thrusting desperately into his mouth, rubbing the back of his throat and filling his face with heat. And another in his butt, rubbing against all the sweet spots and causing him to nearly choke with pleasure.
Castiel looked questioningly towards Sam, but the moose just shrugged his shoulders. Dean just chuckled and shook his head.
The two of them arrived back at the motel to be greeted by the two estatic residents. They did some research on killer clowns and found a little snippet of information about them in John's journal. It turns out that these monsters were vampires and that they had been terrorizing this town for quite some time.
"Look, Sam. I'm fine. I'm just thinking you know? We literally killed God barely three weeks ago. A man's gotta process." Dean rebuttled.
At least the majority of the physical pain was gone. If somehow Sam and Jack could bring him back to his senses, then not all hope would be lost.
Sam carelessly dug through the Bunker's collection of gadgets and knick knacks until he finally found it. It was buried under books, wires, instruments, and other junk, but it was there. He uncovered it and nearly laughed in relief as he flicked the switch on and it buzzed to life.
"More or less. Let's see you die and come back to life then spend the majority of your energy healing someone else and then see if you feel 100%."
"You teamed up with a demon Sam, a demon. In what kind of world would that go right? And on top of that you fucked her. You fucked a demon and then you probably drank her blood like some sort of kinky vampire or sumthin'."
His stomach was a shredded mess of skin flaps. His ribs were exposed and not just because he'd been starved but also the actual bone of the ribs was able to be seen and they were cracked and broken and bleeding with the rest of him. His intestines were actually visible and there was more bone showing because why?
Castiel tried to object, but Dean was already hobbling towards the bathroom. Cas grit his teeth and took Dean's arm over his shoulders and fully supported the grown man. Somehow, Dean seemed even lighter than earlier. His weight was merely a feather's mass upon his shoulder. Panic grew inside of Castiel. He desperately hoped that Sam and Jack would return soon so that this awkward tension between the two of them would disappear with an unbiased party.
After breaking out of the hug, Sam immediately opened the driver's side and turned the ignition on. He listened to her sweet purr and the familiar feelings of her rumblings as she strummed to life. He ran his fingers over the dashboard and relished her sweet scent.
Whilst lost in his thoughts and recollections, Castiel failed to notice Jack slowly approaching him. He jumped a little when Jack put his hand on his trembling shoulder.
"Dean. I know you're hurting inside. For years and years I've known. And now, I feel as though I can help. You just have to give me your approval."
"Is there anything you two need? Should I clean the wounds or...?" Sam cautiously asked, but Castiel merely shook his head.
Shadows flew overhead and screeched as they hurled towards the three, trying to engulf them in the night. But Dean yelled at them to go and a wave of energy erupted out of him and caused the three hunters to stumble backwards and fade away as they awoke in the real world.
Yes you could. But you were too weak and selfish to tell him. And now look. He's dead. And it's your fault.
Oh yes it is. Everything that has happened is your fault because you were too fucked up to do anything about it.
He didn't want to be insane. He didn't want to be eaten by dark and depressive thoughts all the time. He didn't want the phantom pains of everything to remain. He just wanted to be damn happy for at least one day.
A sense of deep fear buried itself in Dean's heart. A fear so dark and unprecented that Dean thought that his heart stopped. He looked down at his hands and they were shaking so violently it was like he was in negative temperatures. His eyes started shaking on their own accord and an overwhelming sense of dizziness set in his head.
Sam had never witnessed this firsthand before. He only had vague descriptions of the scene from Dean when he was brave enough to ask and only the most faintest of memories from that night. But witnessing it brought forth such emotion that he started choking on them. He struggled to find air and thoughts to process as he thought of how his mother had died and how their lives had been destroyed since that fateful night years upon years ago.
Sam, Jack, and Cas were jolted awake as they narrowly managed to escape the oncoming shadows of Dean's head, but there was no time to be dazed or confused. Sam ripped the wires from his head and then from his still-unconscious brother's.
"You'd better hope that he's alive or else your brains are going to be on the ground." Sam growled in reply, his voice just a raspy sound.
AND YES I have plans for fluff, comfort, domestic life, and everything else that's good. Diabolical plans for such tooth rotting fluff you will be begging for me to stop. I love love LOVE writing fluff and happy endings and I'm sad that I can't write any presently BUT do not worry! First we just gotta get the angst and depressing stuff out of the way.
"No, dad. I would never leave you and you know that." Dean managed to whimper out, but John continued on his tirade.
Dean rolled his eyes as he was being excluded out of something yet again. It was annoying how he still didn't have any answers as to why or how he had those scratches on his body, why his fingernails were caked in blood, why he looked like he just walked out of a WWII Concentration Camp, and why his insides hurt like hell. Upon focusing on his internal bits, his stomach did a quick roll and grumbled deeply. The ol' tank needed some fuel, and it was quite obvious that the rest of his body did too.
"Because Dean. Because we saw everything! We've seen how much you're hurting inside and how much you are like dad. We know. And we want to help you! But you won't let us!"
"Dean stop it! You're not fine, you're shouldering so much that it's going to crush you anytime now."
Mostly a filler chapter that's really sad but that's the whole point of this fic, to make you feel sad because Dean didn't deserve any of this
"Let me help. I know you're hurting inside. You can hide it from Sam and Jack, but I know you. I know how much you hate yourself and how much pain you're in. I know what you think about yourself. I've already told you this but you're not daddy's blunt little instrument. You don't corrupt everything you touch. You're not made to be used and then thrown away. Even if you think this about yourself, it's not true. No one thinks it's true because it's not."
He tried to sit up from the bed and ask about his prayer towards Castiel, but he groaned again as his dead muscles were suddenly brought to life and the scratches on his legs were rubbed. Castiel rushed to help him, but Dean just set his hand up to signify he didn't need help.
poking against his paper-thin skin. Dry cuts and callouses littered his legs, and the same applied to his abdomen when he lifted the white T-shirt he had on. And he could feel his muscles. The once strong, hunter-reinforced muscles of his arms and legs were now shriveled up like deflated balloons stuffed with raisins. His skin felt flaky and frail under his fingers, as if he could peel it off with a single, swift motion of his hands. Upon feeling his face, he could feel the gauntness of it and the bones jutting out like rocks on a cliff.
He sighed. He hoped that somehow they could find a way to fix his mind and rid it of the shadows that had plagued it everlasting.
He brought the minimal burger to his mouth and slowly bit down. The flavored juices flooded his tastebuds and a rush warmed him down to his toes. He chewed thoughtfully, savoring each separate chew and assessing the taste.
But he was falling. He couldn't reach it. It grew fainter and fainter until he couldn't even see it. He kept screaming for it, for that warm light that he could see. But then it was gone. And he was still falling.
Destien canon 3rd time confirmed?? ? ? ? ?/?  I'm quAKING WHAT THE HELL IS THIS SHIT WAS THIS CHAP FORESHADOWING OR WHAT HAHA
"Come on Jack. Let's go back to the store, we need more supplies anyway. I think I saw a good deal on tomatoes in the produce so I can make some pasta or something tonight." Sam said tiredly.
sound, but upon dropping the bottle from his lips, he could see the concerned faces of the other three people in the room. He sighed and set the bottle down. It was probably time for them to let the cat out of the bag.
It was almost laughable. Castiel, a celestial being that had existed before Creation itself, had found itself obsessed with a simple human soul. They were such common things. Hundreds of billions inhabited Heaven and Hell, along with the billions on Earth, not even accounting for those stuck in the Veil. All those souls didn't even deserve a glance from Castiel. He had lived his entire state of being not even acknowledging those below him. To him, they were nothing but toys that his father had created, things that didn't even deserve recognition.
Cas scooped up the body and rushed back to the bedroom he had been in not even fifteen minutes ago. He laid Dean down and covered him up tightly. Dean's face was full of sweat and was pinched in concentration. He twitched from time to time, like when he had collapsed after trying to have sex with Cas.
He turned around and let himself retreat back into the kitchen to finish cooking, leaving a dumbfounded Sam and Jack to stare at his lingering figure.
As expected, The Shadow tried to make him go back to sleep and beat him into submission as it had tried long ago, but Castiel relented. He wouldn't fall for any of The Shadows's tricks or deceivings, and even when The Shadow tried to hold their deal over Castiel's head, he simply stuck out his tongue and stayed awake.
After thinking for a while, Sam decided to not let his anger get the best of him and piss Dean off more in the process.
"No, I didn't make any deals with The Empty. To be completely honest, I have no idea how I got out. All I remember is being asleep then feeling someone praying to me. And that someone was you, Dean."
Sam and Jack looked at each other and agreed. That was a logical answer. Dean did love his hamburgers.
But then there it was. In the dark crevices of the deepest parts of Dean's trauma-ridden head, he found it. It was locked tight in a large box that vividly resembled the Ma'lak box he had been forced into a while ago.
Jack's yellow gaze shifted away and he stared at the wall, pondering as what to ask next. He still had so many other questions swimming inside his head, but he had no idea where to even start asking The most pressing one was taken care of, which was a relief, but the other questions persisted.
By the end of it all, he was exhausted. Mentally drained. He was just so tired and wanted all of it to be over.
"Well, I'm glad you finally noticed, you stupid little human." Cas laughed. "I just wish it had been sooner. I was about to get stabbed in there." Dean threw his head back and for the first time in a while, he laughed.
The feelings of helpnessless and hatred came flooding back despite the fact that the light was now fully covering him.
Oh but he left you too. You pushed him away, Dean. You pushed him so far down and he couldn't get back up. You pushed him away unknowingly and he never came back. He hates you, Dean. He hates you because you push him away and only call him when you need him.
Well, none of that mattered now. Nothing really mattered at this point. Castiel was alone in The Empty. No angel wanted anything to do with him with good reason as he had abandoned Heaven just to be with the Winchesters. To be with Sam and Dean.
They watched as Sam ran away to Flagstaff. They watched as John cursed out his own son and slapped the living shit out of him and accused and berated him over not being responsible and lazy and stupid and a failure, a disappointment, an ungrateful brat, someone that broke everything he ever touched, a child that he wished he had never had.
Suddenly, the times that Sam had done this in the past resurfaced in his head. The time he had left for Flagstaff, Stanford, the night he confronted Sam and Ruby, and all those other times. They came bubbling up like a boiling pot and Dean remembered all of them at that moment. He remembered how terrified he felt and how lonely he was at Sam's prolonged absences. He remembered how petrified he had felt at thought of being left alone, like how dad did when Sam had left for college.
After Jack's words, Sam tried to speak again, but he couldn't find the words. It made perfect sense. Dean's "new" personality that he had witnessed definitely resembled the Dean over fifteen years ago, when Dean was still young and full of vigor. Nothing like the depressed and miserable mindset he had formed over the years.
The two of them arrived at the bathroom. At that point, Dean gently pushed himself off of Cas and leaned on the door.
Sam, Jack, and Castiel all made nervous eye contact with each other. Did Dean not remember anything at all? It was certainly possible that he forced himself to undergo an amnesiac state of mind to cope with the trauma, kinda like Sam had done earlier. But yet it seemed that Dean had remembered everything, so what had happened in that split second decision he had made to kick all of them out? Did he even remember that? Did he even remember being kidnapped or anything that had happened in the past 8 months?
Sam threw his head back and started cackling, as did Jack. Eileen looked questioningly at him until he explained the joke, as to which she started giggling too. The laughter continued and then died down, Sam wiping tears from his eyes. Castiel still looked confused at the joke, but he shrugged it off and went back to inhaling bites of freshly baked brownie bites. They were sweet and tasted kinda like peanut butter and jelly if he thought about it. He would have to get one of those later and see if they still tasted the same as when he was human.
"And here you see an angel and a human finally confessing their love to each other after literal years of me third wheeling. It's about time!"
"And so why would we be here? What happened while I was gone? Did Dean get hurt or something and not tell me AGAIN?"
And thus they repeated the same until they arrived at a mediocre-looking motel in Ohio. Upon pulling in and getting their stuff unpacked, they all collapsed on their beds. Sam and Eileen on one, Jack on the other, and Castiel settled on the couch, as per tradition. When he sat down, a quick flicker of pain hit his head, but he brushed it off, not knowing what it meant. Probably something trivial.
"Do you happen to remember anything? Anything at all about what happened to you? And if you do but don't want to talk about it that's fine I was just wondering." He suggested.
"No reason." She replied. "Only that he helped get me kicked out of Heaven and killed many of our kind along with his brother and... Need I go on?" She mocked.
The angel pursed his lips in thought. Jack could tell that Castiel was trying to think of a way to break the news in a way that was "watered down" as he had heard Sam say from time to time. He wished that Castiel wouldn't do that. He may only be barely four years old, but he had seen things most people couldn't even begin to imagine. He could handle a gritty reality. He just had to know how Dean was holding up.
"He's suffering. All 8 months he was here he was suffering, never doubt that. And I know you're going to kill me now, but I can die satisfied. I can die knowing that I broke Dean Winchester. Beautifully. He's beautifully broken and he has no hope of recovering at all. You can heal his physical wounds, oh yes I don't doubt you angels. But those internal scars and all that trauma buried under the alcohol and women, all that has come unearthed. Good luck trying to put that back together."
His silence wasn't because he was mad at Dean. He wasn't angry at all. He just wanted to tread lightly because he had no idea what the hell Dean was thinking or why his memories were gone. But he feared that any sort of interaction or unprecented words could trigger some sort of reaction inside of Dean, which could cause him to spiral into a manic state again. He was also fearful of the reaction Dean had towards his last confession, the one of love. Did Dean remember it? Or did he block it from his mind?
The second after Sam said those words, past Dean and Sam materialized in front of them. Surprised, Sam took a step back towards Jack and Castiel and they watched in horror at the scene before their eyes. Sam especially. He stared at his culpability and wanted to cry out of embarrassment and guilt.
"What the hell are you saying man?" He nearly hissed out. Castiel cursed himself for even thinking of an idea as stupid as that, but it was too far now.
Sam grew panicked as he remembered the massive punch Cas received. He shook Cas again with more and more vigor as he realized the reality of the situation. Now fully panicked, he scooped up the angel in his arms and started towards the Impala. He looked behind him to see Eileen with the two children. She told them to run away to the police and not to mention the hunters at all. The poor traumatized kids had no choice but to oblige and Sam watched as they scurried away.
They found themselves in another dingy hotel room, except this time there was no John. Castiel and Jack turned towards Sam and were about to ask him where this was, but Sam's eyes had widened in fear. They looked concerningly towards him.
Sam was now filling with worry and anger. What the actual hell? After he had been tortured in the Cage, he sure as hell didn't feel "peachy" afterwards, he felt like... Well soulless.
He felt the fangs as they invaded every part of his body and sucked all the blood out of it as they could
"Sam. Sammy. What do you want me to do huh? Sit around a round table and discuss my feelings with everyone and how insecure I am like a giant group therapy session?"
"Well, I guess that's good. As long as Dean is healing, all we can do is wait." Jack responded after a slight pause.
But even if that was all he was, Dean was satisfied. At least he would have some sort of use in that time.
Castiel had never seen or dealt with a panic attack before, but from what he had heard, they were absolutely terrifying. An individial was left with an overwhelming sense of terror so intense that they couldn't breathe. A number of other symptoms could also present themselves. But to think that Dean was vulnerable to them... Never before had Castiel even suspected that Dean would be suffering from a disorder as fervent as this. He glanced towards Jack, who also held a face of disbelief. To all of them, this new snippet of information about Dean was earth shattering.
"I woke up without remembering anything. Sam, Jack, and Cas were there. I asked why Cas was alive, but he's been giving me the silent treatment. Before I woke up, I remember... I definitely remember Castiel dying but why? Why did he die?"
Jack glanced towards Castiel and Sam, but the angel and hunter returned the same confused looks. Jack licked his lips and tepidly leaned over towards Dean.
Afterwards, the three distressed individuals stared at Dean dolorously. They decided to watch him in shifts while the other two rested, all the while they would be trying to think of a way to get his sanity back. Castiel volunteered to sit with Dean first, even at Sam and Jack's objections. He simply raised his hand and told them to get some sleep. They would need it. Reluctantly, the duo agreed and shuffled away, Sam pulling out his phone to text Eileen, who was still out on cases. Castiel knew that they wouldn't be able to sleep, but any rest was better than none. Besides, he needed to ease up a little as well.
Dean stopped gripping his head and stared at himself in the mirror. Castiel loved Dean. He told him. He had told him and then he pushed Dean away and watched as he was taken by The Empty and taken to the place where he was supposed to die. And all Dean could do was watch.
He finally found the remains of the Ma'lak Box. It had been shattered into pieces like a pane of glass hurled out of a window. He had tried his damn hardest to make it as sturdy as possible, but there was just too much.
But present Sam could see how much Dean was suffering. He had failed to see it on that night, but now that he had matured and seen how much Dean had to undergo, he could definitely see how wrong he was and how much Dean wanted him to stay. He just couldn't properly express his emotions, so instead of bringing Sam back, he ended up pushing him away.
His arms and legs stopped twitching, but they had gone painstakingly numb. He tried to lift his right arm, but it was useless.
He wouldn't be able to shield everyone for the rest of his life, but for the time being, with their defenses so weakened, they needed all the rest they could get.
"Just let me help you. You've helped me so much. Without you, I would have died many times over. But because of you, I haven't. Because of you, I've learned to love and care for others. Because of you, I've learned the meaning of my life and why I was brought into existence."
They landed in a dark and dingy motel room. A slight bit of embarrassment hit Sam as he remembered that they used to live in these. All of those memories of just he and Dean, traveling the country and hunting whatever the world threw their way. He was of course thankful for the Bunker, their first real home, but he still had good and bad memories of the two of them in their crappy motels and shitty diner food.
Cas' eyes nearly rolled back in his head. Man #1's dick was filling him up so good, he felt like he would burst then and there. But then his arms were taken behind his back and he was left totally helpless, at these two mens' mercy. And it felt so goddamn good.
Tears started streaking down Castiel's face and he rushed over to Dean, who was still on the floor sobbing. He uttered hushed words of love and enveloped Dean in his body and wings. He couldn't change the past. He knew this. But this was all he could do at the moment. He wished with all his heart that Dean's soul could hear his words and prayers. Hear his thoughts. Hear that he loved the hunter and no matter what he did he would always be loved and cherished by all his family and friends.
On the way there, he failed to notice the pained look on the angel's face as he held onto his head. Castiel said nothing, and they continued talking about the case with almost no worries.
Jack, Sam, Castiel, and Eileen were seated at the dining table which doubled as the map table, blissfully eating a dinner that Castiel conjured up. Jack was left speechless as Castiel whisked plate after plate of many delicious looking dishes. A large salad bowl, potato salad, corn on the cob, fruit cocktail, a tray of brownies, and a huge stack of hamburgers balanced on an equally large plate.
But no. That would be taking advantage of Dean in his derived state. That would further hurt Dean, which was the exact opposite of what Castiel wanted. Sure, he wanted to be with the sexy hunter for the rest of his days, but not if this hunter was basically insane.
At first, Castiel prepared meals that Dean used to prepare. Greasy diner dishes that he and Sam had grown up on. Dishes that could raise cholesterol levels drastically just by looking at them. Fried chicken, bacon, pizza, burritos, nachos, loaded sandwiches, and his personal favorite, hamburgers. This wasn't Cas's fault though. Dean always prepared food like that and let his angel helper watch, so Castiel didn't know any better. Sam didn't really have a problem with these dishes, but he wanted to get Cas and Jack into good eating habits. Besides, Dean wasn't there at the moment. They could do without any cholesterol problems for a while.
While Dean was checking out his body and just looking totally unfazed by everything, Sam beckoned Jack and Castiel over to a corner where they conversed in hushed voices.
Internally, Sam was relieved that Cas would be staying. Someone had to watch his idiot brother. He would've done it himself but he was too pissed off to even think straight."
He racked his brain as he tried to remember what had happened last. What happened before the blur that was his current memories. He looked in the mirror and focused on his face and his words.
A quick twinge of pain hit him as he remembered that Dean wasn't here with them. He missed the man dearly even though it had been barely a day since he had possessed his body. Every second was excruciating. It seemed that everytime he and Dean would reunite, they would be brutally ripped apart immediately after.
Castiel let out a shrill sound, followed by senseless gurgling and moans. They were muffled as Man #2's continued thrusting sped up.
A small pile of clothes lay in a corner, abandoned by all who wore them. Two pairs of jeans, two T-shirts, three pairs of underwear, one trenchcoat, and one black suit and tie. The trenchcoat and tie stood out amongst the otherwise drab pile, but no one paid them any heed. Any clothing uncertainities were long forgotten.
"Dean, I really don't think you should drink a beer right now..." Jack noted, a hint of trepidation in his voice.
At Sam's words, they heard the door slamming. They whipped around and witnessed Dean staring behind the door, staring at it. Sam had just left like he had just described. Only this time, he would be seeing what Dean saw that night.
"After all I've done for you boys... After everything. I've dragged your sorry asses around my entire
Like one time Sam was making a request for lunch but he accidentally said Dean instead of Cas. Castiel did turn around, but Sam still felt guilty at his mistake. The incident was soon forgotten though and Sam tried his hardest not to slip up again. They had to stay strong so that Dean could continue to heal.
Castiel continued to stare at Dean with soft eyes. Dean still thought of himself as a failure, even after Cas had told him that he wasn't. That was why he ran away. That was how he got kidnapped. That was why he allowed the monsters to break him. Instead of Castiel's speech fixing the broken hunter, they instead created even deeper rifts in his mind. He blamed himself for not doing anything to help Cas. He blamed himself for being too confused to say anything. He blamed himself for throwing Castiel into the tragedy that was the life of a Winchester.
But what could he do now? Dean had just kissed him. Cas had hoped that this moment would happen ever since he rescued Dean's broken soul from Hell. While he was somewhat elated it had finally happened, it wasn't something he could derive joy from. Dean wasn't himself. It wasn't a kiss that he meant. It was just a kiss with no feeling behind it. If this was the case, what was its purpose?
"That's all just details you dumbass. Come here Cas." And with that Dean pulled Castiel into a giant hug and buried his face in his trench coat. "Let's get you out of here. My boyfriend can't just spend eternity rotting in The Empty now, can he?" Castiel's eyes widened and he could feel a slight redness come across his cheeks.
"Alright, well let's get settled in and see what's happening." Sam stated after they had a chance to recuperate.
Also, there's some other stuff that I need to address relating to Dean and Jack's relationship. When it comes to Dean, it's a very complex process to write his character in the show and in fanfic. He was done so dirty, he wanted to kill Jack one minute and then had him drive Baby another? I want to play on that dynamic. Dean needs to love his son more!
Definitely lots of angsty Dean here but comfort shall come eventually first we gotta get the angst out of the way
Castiel slowly grabbed it and cradled it in his arms. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he realized they had found it. Finally, they had Dean's soul safely in their arms. They had gone so far, and they finally had it. Relief washed over the three of them in a giant wave. It was safe and it was with them.
Sam and Jack arrived sometime soon after. Upon seeing Dean, they both started shouting and asking what the hell happened this time with him. Castiel merely stated that Dean had locked his memories away but when he went to the bathroom he had somehow unearthed them. Groans of exasperation and sheer panic were given.
"I think it would be worth looking into. Maybe your father wrote something about them." He suggested.
"Oh Baby, I'm so sorry." Sam cried. The Impala. Baby. Dean's car. It was ruined by monsters so that meant that Dean was somewhere but he wasn't there. Sam frantically looked towards Jack and Cas, confusion, shock, and pain written all over his face.
"C...C-Ca. Caass... P-Pl-ease come b-ba-back. I... I n-n-need you now m... More t-than ever. Ple-ase."
Dean actively recoiled and Castiel instantly regretted his words as Dean retreated back into his shell.
So he sealed them away. Everything. He didn't want to be God - he just wanted to be Jack. Jack Kline, a kid who's barely 3 years old but already is the most powerful being in existence. He didn't ask for any of this, it was just thrust upon him in a cruel flip of fate's coin.
"And then he thought he was free by falling unconsciousness, but alas it was not meant to be. Gwynth had a dastardly idea and pulled up his worst nightmares and past traumas. All of the abuse and mistreatment his father put him through was pulled up. He was only 4 when he had to take on the world. And how he just craves love. It's certainly pitiful how he thinks that no one loves him. He thinks he doesn't deserve any love! That's why he won't even
"What do you mean he's gone?!" The angel snapped and he banged his fist on the table. His wings were extended and puffed out to their maximum plumage. Jack stared at them, but he also winced at Castiel's aggression.
He then leaned his face into the love of his life's and let their touch starved lips meet each other in the middle.
"You see boys, that sigil means "Death shalt not take thee" so basically we could do whatever we wanted to this man without him dying. It was very convenient! And then this other witch came by and put a curse on him so that whatever pain he felt would be increased tenfold! Quite a useful spell if I say so myself. And then Gwynth, bless her soul, let us all peek into his mind and see what trauma he's got locked up in there! It was truly a mesmerizing experience, seeing everything he's bottled up for so long. The hatred he feels for himself and his father, and his unexplainable love for his little brother Sammy. Oh and how he cried! The poor little child crying for his brother, for his guardian angel, for his father, for just about anyone who would rescue him. Oh how he cried!"
Castiel agreed with guilt seeping in his voice. He knew that in Dean's earlier times, he hadn't been there to help as much as he would have liked. But he was busy running Heaven and doing his duties. And he didn't really want to associate with humans at that time in the past. Of course he had changed a lot since then, but... He still wasn't there for Dean as much as he should have been.
"But Dean, what are we going to do about this?" Cas made a grand gesture towards the darkness. "And what about your mental health? Are you going to wake up alright? Do I need to stay behind and help you or-"
"I... I think that this is the motel that dad towed Dean and I to the night I left." Sam said with a very noticable tremble in his voice.
The radio in Baby had also been fixed by Jack, and Sam took great pleasure in rummaging through Dean's old cassettes to play. They jammed out to all of his favorite bands in his name. He made a mental note to put an aux cord in so he could hook up some Spotify so he could introduce Jack and Cas to modern rock and some pop music. And while Eileen couldn't share the experience to its fullest extent, she still joyfully followed along with a grin on her face.
The firefighters and police officers arrived soon after. John and Dean sat on the hood of a police car, John cradling Sam in his trembling arms and child Dean leaning so far into John that it seemed he melded with his bedrobe. Sam opened his mouth to attempt to say something, anything to cope with what he was witnessing, but then he collapsed on the cold ground. It was too much to take in. Watching his mother die. Watching his father break down and watching his brother's life be torn to shreds by a cruel demon that they couldn't even kill at the time.
He quickly formed mouthless words without even knowing it. Why the fuck was Castiel with two other dudes and not him?
The hatred he feels for himself and sometimes Sam because both of them are just so stubborn and stupid at times.
When Castiel tried to talk to the newly resurrected hunter after his awakening, he was deeply saddened when he realized that Dean couldn't hear him or witness his true form. But this was to be expected. Although, it was still disappointing. He wanted Dean to witness the being that rescued him. He wanted Dean to notice him and see the truth of what had happened. He wanted Dean to notice his love for his soul and to return those feelings back.
The scene faded out into the dark crevices of Dean's head, ready to be rewound and played over and over again.
The angel continued to search Dean's head. He ignored the parts that involved Hell, but something else intrigued him. He held out his hand and motioned towards Sam and Jack to follow him. Jack carefully helped Sam on his feet and they followed their friend into the darkness. He transported them into another traumatic memory.
They watched as he tried his hardest to kill the monsters that were trying to apprehend him. He succeeded in killing a couple of werewolves, but there were too many. He was easily overwhelmed and dragged off. He didn't even try to resist. He was already too broken.
The dick in his ass and the dick in his mouth continued thrusting into him, and he moaned loudly as they continued to supply him with the pleasure that Dean Winchester could never.
While still searching and reeling from the new information he had witnessed, Castiel noticed that a dull static noise had appeared from the darkness. He wanted to stay and let Sam regain his composure, but time was ticking away quickly. It wouldn't be long until Dean's soul would completely disappear, he could feel it. His curiousity piqued as he headed towards it. Jack and Sam noticed his movement and slowly started stumbling behind, Sam supporting himself on Jack. They pressed on until Castiel grabbed ahold of the memory the static was tied to and transported them to it. He had no idea what the cause of it was, but obviously it was something that Dean wasn't fond of. Something that wasn't physical pain, but more psychological. Like the death of a loved one.
"If we actually pull this off, this will have been one of the fastest hunts we've ever done. I guess having a couple extra set of hands has its perks."
"No Dean. I can't. This isn't you talking. I don't know what it is, but it's not you. Talk to me, Dean. Please just talk to me for once. What's wrong? What's happening?" Castiel pleaded.
Castiel couldn't take it. He couldn't watch the damage he had caused. He just couldn't handle the guilt and shame he felt at that moment. He needed to find Dean and tell him that he was here and alive.
He told himself to stop it. It was okay. Dad wasn't there and Sam would be coming back. Everything would be fine. He was just freaking out for no reason.
Dean's head just nodded up and down like a stupid bobblehead. He seemed so insouciant at the moment that Sam found it hard to believe that this was his brother sitting there. If he hadn't seen Dean's battered self with his own eyes, he would have actively refused to believe that this happy-go-lucky oaf was his big brother.
Dean opened his mouth to say something, anything to console his father and tell him that he appreciated all that he had done for the two of them. Tell him that despite everything that's ever happened, he'll stay by his side and somehow get Sam back to them. That he will try harder and-
Upon first glance you saw his face. It was supported by a giant shackle on his neck. Blood caked every part of skin that is visible behind the overgrown hair. The hair itself was black with grime, dirt, and caked on blood. Also there was hot tar poured on it. Dean's eyes weren't there, they'd been carved out by a spoon or something. His eyelids were sewn open but his mouth was sewn shut. One ear was ripped off and the other one was torn to shreds and blood was pouring out of it. There were cuts, scrapes, nicks, and just plain gashes on every part of his body. He had no clothes on but it didn't matter because everything was just a mess of blood. His arms had nails and a ton of bite marks in them and they were being held up on chains. There were fingers missing and fingernails and there was no skin just raw muscle and tendon on his left hand.
His own powers scared him, but coupled with God's and Amara's, he knew he wouldn't be able to control himself. Without guidance, he would just be a walking ball of sheer power.
Now, as a forelorn Castiel stared at the shattered soul of Dean, his sorrow grew to the point of bursting. He had done the best he could to try and convince Dean that these feelings, these emotions just weren't true. As a final attempt to mend the broken soul that he loved, he poured out his heart and professed all his feelings of love and adoration for Dean. If he died without telling Dean what he truly thought, he would have dreamed of that forever in The Empty. That would have been his biggest regret.
The chills started. Then the heat. The chills and heat and twitching. His limbs were moving on their own, convulsing, as if they were fish out of water.
"Cas. How in the world did you get back? I thought that you were in The Empty." Sam asked, full of curiosity but also a little fear. He hoped that Cas hadn't made any deals like all of them were prone to do.
"But Dean, it's ok to talk about your feelings sometimes. It's not healthy to bottle all of them up-"
"Hello, Castiel. Remember me?" She said with a sneer. She always was the ugliest angel Castiel knew, both inside and out. So full of hatred for humanity, but not fully supporting Lucifer. Or at least not yet.
Castiel's face turned a dark red and heated up a little. His heart was filled with even more love for the Winchester. That beautiful and loving and sometimes stupid Dean Winchester. He was just so goddamn adorable. Such a child, such a shithead, such a beautiful human.
Sam buried his head in his arms again and attempted to breathe again. Each breath was shaky, but Jack provided support and brought Sam in close. The contact eased the hunter up, but they couldn't ignore the elephant in the room. They had failed to find Dean's soul amongst those memories of his traumatizing past. They had to keep going. But through how much? How long would they have to search Dean's personal trauma just to find his soul?
Cas had obviously washed it with care, not wanting any sort of flaws to remain on it. Perhaps he had done it as a surprise for Dean before he was taken by The Empty.
Castiel watched as the black tendrils approached and took him. He shuddered as he remembered the grotesque feeling of being pulled into certain death. But he had kept a smile on his face for Dean.
Castiel followed and held Dean tightly to his chest. He looked like a child, all skin and bones and clutching at Castiel's trenchcoat with white knuckles. Castiel then tried to heal the deep wounds he had inflicted upon himself with his nails, but for some reason his grace was blocked out from healing external as well as internal wounds.
But he never up and left Dean alone. He stayed and fought through everything. And eventually Eileen came back. Dean should have known that. He should have stayed and talked to Sam or done something to grieve properly other than leaving with liquor bottles lining every spare space in the Impala.
Dean smiled back as the tears started to fall. Using the last of his strength, he leaned up and tightly held Castiel in his arms. Giant sobs racked his body and shook his entire frame. The built up sobs and cries that Dean had buried for so long finally boiled over and he could let them all out. It hurt Cas to see Dean in such pain and brokenness, but he was elated to see that he was helping at least a little bit. Even after ten minutes of Dean spilling out vulnerabilities in his trenchcoat, Castiel still continued to smile and hold Dean close. He gently patted and rubbed Dean's head and his back, whispering words of encouragement and love to the broken man.
He put his hand on the angel's wound and concentrated. Immediately, the punctures closed up and the bleeding stopped. He opened his eyes and was surprised at his success. Sam breathed out in relief and gently shook Castiel to wake him up.
Another long hour passed and Sam was just about to leave to get a glass of water or do something that would get his mind off of his brother when Dean awoke.
And with that, he quietly entered the white room and shut the door. Castiel sighed and stood by the door for a moment. He knew that Dean wasn't mad. The only reason he would be at all was because of Castiel's prolonged silence. But what Dean didn't know was that Castiel was being silent for his sake.
Sam, Jack, and Castiel all turned around to look at him, all of them bewildered at Dean's random request. Why did he want them gone? Had they done something to piss him off?
Dean blinked hot tears out of his eyes and stared at Castiel. He opened his mouth, but he only choked on his words. Castiel smiled and put his finger to Dean's lips, gently shushing him.
Before opening the door, he took another once-over of Castiel/Dean in his new outfit. The suit was very loose-fitting, but it was the smallest size they could get. However, this flaw wasn't that noticeable as an oversized trenchcoat enveloped Dean's small figure. It was definitely strange, seeing Dean in a Castiel-esque trenchcoat, but he could get used to it. And besides, Castiel looked more comfortable in his usual clothes. If that gave him peace of mind, then Sam was thrilled.
"I assume you've asked Jack to track him down?" Castiel asked as he rubbed the bridge of his nose in exasperation. Sam nodded.
Then Dean getting sent to reform school and for the first time in his life making friends and having something for himself. Then Dean having a girlfriend but having to leave her and then cheating on another one then getting to go to prom but having that once in a lifetime opportunity ripped out of his clenched fists and trampled in front of him by John. And then Dean feeling so guilty over his own vulnerabilities and failures about being responsible for Sam that he just left his little brother alone all the time because he couldn't handle the sins of his actions...
Soon those dots evolved into deep cuts. Then teeth swarmed around him and bit every piece of flesh they could get ahold of. Blood flowed everywhere.
This of course was a stupid question. Just about anything nowadays could read minds and pick up memories that some people didn't even know existed. But still, it was the best option at the time.
Castiel felt Dean's muscles loosen and all the fight go out of his body as he was thrust into the familiar pose of his torturers.
Castiel opened his mouth to say something but Dean pushed Cas down on the bed and straddled his stomach. He pushed his lips to Cas's once again and his hips started to grind against the angel's nether regions.
"Of course I don't know anything about that Dean. But come on! You have to forget about that for just a while. I can help you as soon as we don't have a bounty over our heads."
He sighed. This time, there wouldn't be any light to cover him. It would only be neverending darkness. Jack had tried his best, Dean knew that. He was just too much of a fuckup to make any use of the poor kid's effort. Because of his mistakes, he would now be engulfed by the shadows of his own mind. But by now, he was used to it.
He knew that he was going to lose all sense of self and life when the box broke, so in a last and final desperate attempt, he tried. He tried to do the one thing he wanted while he could, and that was make Castiel his.
With newfound vigor, Sam rushed out of the storage room while calling out Castiel and Jack's names. Finally, he had done something to help Dean. He just hoped that everything would go right. Knowing their luck, it wouldn't, but it wouldn't do any good not to try.
"I don't know!" Castiel remonstrated. "One minute I was trying to talk to him, and the other he was just... On top of me."
After being shoved to the side, Dean could only stare in horror and disbelief as he witnessed his best friend being killed right in front of his eyes. When the gap closed to the other world and Dean was left alone in the dark room, he buried his head in his hands and...
Dean's thoughts were abruptly interrupted when Sam quietly rapped on his door. He snapped back into reality and headed over to answer it. Sam's familiar face appeared, looking worried.
Unsurprisingly, his hunter gut got the better of him. He gently roused Eileen from her sleep and called out to the two angelic beings who were locked in a tense standstill during an intense battle of Uno.
He drove to Oregon. He drove up to that abandoned town and sat on an abandoned doorstep. He pulled out the gun from his pantline and turned the safety off. His alcohol-ridden mind had told him to. He hadn't been sober in forever, so what was the point of trying.
Over time, he and Dean had begun to slowly mend their relationship. It was still very rocky at times, but at least Dean wasn't trying to kill him now. Well, not that he could, but the thought was there. That was all that mattered.
Sorry this was so so late but I ended up accidentally deleting the whole 10,000 word chapter in a dumb mistake and I wanted to die so yeah
Castiel sighed heavily and put his fingers on Dean's forehead, trying to send him to sleep. This didn't work though and Castiel looked at his hand, utterly baffled.
Sam snapped himself out of his thoughts and gathered his supplies. He threw away the bloodied and flesh threaded string along with the scissors. He didn't ever want to look at those ever again. His hands were full of blood and he scrubbed for a good ten minutes with as much soap as he could fit. There was just so much. So much pain and suffering that his brother had gone through. It was unfair. They had defeated God and set the universe right again. They had done the ultimate good. So why did Dean still have to suffer so?
Dean was lying on the bed, nearly having a seizure. Sweat dripped out of every pore on his head and body, his eyes were wide and shaking, his chest rose and fell shakily and out of rhythm as he struggled to breathe, and his limbs were twitching and convulsing.
Damn Destiel not going *fully* canon was actually the worst thing they could have done? Destiel is such a tragic yet wholesome relationship?? Why wouldn't you want to explore on that??? Tf? ??? ?
Cas rubbed the skin of Dean's raw arms, yearning for the touch of their lips again. That was definitely a better kiss than the one before. It was slow, deliberate, and mind-numbing. He wished that they could do it again a million times over and over and forget their present worries. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be for a long while until Dean would be ready to show himself. Besides, he probably didn't mean to do it in the first place. He was emotionally vulnerable and acted on his frantic feelings.
The box continued to scream and shake and attempt to break itself, but Dean held fast. He clenched his fists and breathed deeply.
"Gwynth. Why would you do this?" He asked, tears starting to fall down his face. The love of his life, Dean Winchester, was lying there, truly now a broken shell of a man. No wonder he couldn't detect Dean's soul. It was barely existant.
He found the memory and went back eight months to the Bunker's basement. The time where he and Dean would face certain death, or in this case Billie, if they didn't do anything to stop her.
Soon. It would be soon. Dean would be back soon. He had to believe it. If he didn't, he wasn't sure that he would be able to continue living.
He continued to stare at the warm light that continued to come his way. He could reach out his fingers and almost touch it. Just a little bit more... A little more... More, more, more...
The engine roared to life and Sam put Baby into drive. She voiced her approval and with a thrilled noise, they exited the Bunker and began the long ride to Ohio.
though. It was Castiel's. He could tell every stark difference in the two, even if they were in different bodies. Castiel used less emotion on his face, oftentimes keeping a stoic demeanor as his neutral stance. Dean, though, his face was oftentimes a flurry of micro-expressions. He never had a true "neutral" face like Castiel did. He always emitted feelings just from his facial expressions.
How would they ever break the news of everything that had happened if Dean did indeed seal off his memories in a last ditch effort at sanity?
"So. Cas." Dean stared. "As we can see here, you're alive. Thank God, er Jack, that you're alive. I have no idea how and you said you don't either, so I guess we're on the same boat there. But to be honest, I don't really remember much at all. I remember running away from Billie, then for some reason The Empty came and took you and her. And... That's really it Cas. I have no idea what happened at all between now and then."
Before he could stop himself, a low rumble escaped his throat. He roughly kissed back and flipped Dean on his back. Now Castiel was on top and had Dean pinned to the bed, his right knee locked inbetween Dean's legs and his arms pinning down the latter's.
While lost in his own thoughts, Sam had completely missed the note that was hastily thrown and written on the table. It was from Eileen.
"See Dean? You can do this. You're stronger than this. I know, it's something that you never wanted anyone to see. But we know Dean. And you don't need to be embarrassed. This isn't something you can control, so there's nothing to be ashamed of. We are not disappointed. All of us love you and would die for you. So stay strong Dean. You can do this."
Gwynth invaded his brain and forced him to relive all his worst regrets and pain whenever he passed out. Kind of like an angel would in the Empty, except for the fact that Dean had so many regrest and mistakes and trauma that he had tried to lock away that a trip to the Empty would be a walk in the park for him. So many nightmares. So many regrets. So many times his own family had called him a failure, disappointment, mistake, stupid, selfish... Every other derogatory term that existed could be related to him. And they were true. So true in Dean's nightmares.
"Yeah. Ok. So basically Dean was really depressed because he had just learned that his interference in Hell had been the first seal breaking of Lucifer's Cage. He was really bent up about it. And you, Castiel, well you weren't being much help."
He could still remember the angels rejoicing as he declared the news. Even after the dismal aftermath of the death of many of his brothers, Castiel still felt exhilarated as he began to rebuild Dean's body.
Now, he would be able to see Dean's reaction. He watched expectantly as the hunter attempted to process what had just happened.
"Now Jack. This is the hard part. Imagine letting out only a tiny bit of power. A very small bit. And imagine putting that power in a place where the Impala is and finding it. It could be anywhere. A garage, a forest, a desert, in a town. Imagine finding the Impala in a place where Dean would be."
He opened the passenger side and stepped inside. As he did, he wondered why the feeling felt unfamiliar. Then he remembered that it was always Sam and Dean that rode in the front, while he and Jack were in the back. He realized his mistake and was about to get out when Sam gently put his hand on his shoulder.
About halfway to their destination, they stopped at a quaint little diner to take a rest stop. Sam and Eileen ordered house salads while Castiel and Jack indulged themselves in the trademarked burgers. They happily ate with each other, relishing in the calm before the storm.
"Sam. You've left me alone for all this time. What's with the get up now? Is there a case or something?"
Jack and Eileen followed and Sam abruptly shot the vampire. But no need be, because Castiel was an angel. Any vampire that drank the blood of an angel was immediately vaporized. As soon as the first of the angelic blood hit the vampire's tongue, it opened its mouth and gagged as the blood began to poison it from the inside out. In less than five seconds, it fell over flat.
After what seemed like an eternity, Sam finished putting the suctions on his head and looked towards Castiel and Jack. They had the same deadpan look on their faces, but at least there was a spark of hope present now.
Castiel held up his hand and transported them back to the time 8 months ago, when Dean was taken captive by monsters and tortured to the point of insanity.
He cooked for them whenever he had the chance. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and sometimes even a teatime like in England. Sam speculated that Castiel wanted to cook because he wanted to feel useful and he thought that a little bit of Dean's personality had merged with their angel friend too. Dean did love to cook so, and they were basically the same person now, so this speculation wasn't all that strange. It was definitely weird seeing Dean walking around in his apron and not being able to say "Dean."
"I can't give you that much information, Dean. I don't know how to tell you in the right way." Sam signed and buried his face in his hands. Dean's confusion grew.
His eyes turned deadpan, but they didn't lose any fear to them. The terror was there, but it was overshadowed by the utter hopelessness that Dean had experienced 8 months ago.
"Did he make any deals? Is he trying to reach The Empty? Are there any angels or demons after him? Is he dead?" Castiel raged. Deep in his mind, he thought that would happen. It was Dean after all. Before he was taken, before his confession, he had told Dean to live on. To not look for him. He had hoped so desperately that Dean would listen. But as always, he didn't. And now he was gone. 8 months without any contact from Dean. For all he knew he could be dead! Dead! After his speech about living on and loving himself, Dean could have just gone off and gotten himself killed! He was like a needy child at times and Castiel hated that-
Castiel tried to say something, to protest, to fight back, but Dean just kept kissing and breathing on him. The urge to kiss back was stifling, but he relented and kept trying to push Dean off. Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, his body seemed sapped of strength.
Dean leaned back, satisfied, leaving a baffled Jack to stare at him. Jack opened his mouth in an attempt to say something to Dean about his deteriorating health and the effects of alcohol on the liver, but he thought better of it and nodded.
Jack was about to ask why he had to go too but Sam discreetly stepped on his foot to signify he didn't decide on that on the spur of the moment. Understanding dawned on Jack and he nodded.
Jack searched again. He dug deep into the forces of Dean's mind and desperately searched. If Dean's soul was gone, then there would be no getting it back because it was merely a glimmer. If it went missing, then it would disappear before you had a chance to even search for it. Sure, Dean could survive soulless, but when he would ultimately die of natural causes or of something else, then he would go nowhere. He would not find eternal peace in Heaven where he belonged, and Sam would live in eternity without his brother. No, that could not happen. He had to find Dean's soul somewhere.
Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a shadowy figure approaching him. He snapped his head towards it.
He started sprinting around, but everything was so dark that it seemed that he never moved no matter how fast he ran.
Castiel let out a cry of horror and held Dean's arms again and watched helplessly as Dean's body fell limp again. He shot a helpless look towards Sam and Jack, but they only returned the same to him.
Castiel opened his mouth to say something to past Dean, anything to console him and tell the poor man that he was here, he was alive. But once again, the scene interrupted him and cut out and they were thrust into another one. It was with Dean and Billie. Sam recognized the situation, as it was when he turned Dean into a ghost to hunt that poltergeist in that asylum, but to Jack and Cas, it was a new sight. A sight that they could have gone without seeing because of how painful it was.
The one-sided beatdown started, the punches and kicks came flying from John and into Dean's unresisting body. Dean crumpled to the floor and John continued his onslaught of abuse.
He called over to Castiel and Jack, who were silently standing in the corner of the room, deep in their own thoughts and sharing neutral news with each other. When Sam spoke, they looked up and saw Dean's head hooked to the polygraph and knew that it was time to start. As they started to come over, Sam pulled over three chairs and set them beside Dean's bed. He took the seat nearest to the polygraph and started setting the wires to his own head with suffocating silence.
Now with no choice, Castiel roughly grabbed Dean's hands and held them above his head so that he would stop scoring his own beautiful skin.
But Castiel stood as still as a rock and quickly averted his gaze. He didn't even open his mouth in an attempt to answer. Irritation rose inside of Dean.
The three of them thought that he was relatively stable and under a little bit of control until Dean slightly opened his mouth and let a few words spill out. The heartbreaking phrases shook all of them deep down to the core of their beings.
Sam laughed. If this wasn't Castiel then it was doing a damn good job of faking him. He slowly but deliberately opened the Bunker's door. Lo and behold his eyes were greeted with that familiar trenchcoat, black suit and blue tie, raven dark hair, and the unmistakable electric blue eyes of the angel, Castiel.
Jack's happy tone deflated into a dead one. Of course he would need God's power. If only it were that easy.
No. He didn't. Dean WAS a child. Hell at the age of four he was forced to take on the entire world on his thin and trembling shoulders on that fated night. He was forced to grow up and become something he wasn't meant to at such a young age. Of course he was needy and reckless and childish. He couldn't be any of those when he was younger, so it only made sense that he was like this now. A child with no guidance from a mother or father figure, and basically raising another child was a recipe for psychological trauma and stupidity, both of which Dean possessed a lot of.
Castiel's last sight was of Dean faintly smiling as the shadows made contact and attached themselves to his body. Dean just stared at them with sad eyes and continued letting them cling to his last bits of sanity. Castiel tried to call out, but he could already feel his consciousness returning to his body.
Sam breathed through his teeth harshly. Cas took after Dean so much that even his brother's stubbornness rubbed off on the angel. They were both insufferable sometimes in getting what they wanted. But at least they were here - that was all that mattered.
They had decided to take a quick break from hunting and instead focus on themselves. The past year had been rough for all of them, so a quick rest was definitely needed.
of Sam's mighty moose paws as he signified his return. Dean finished scooping the eggs into the plates and smiled at Sam as they made eye contact. Sam smiled back and washed his hands as Dean set their places at the table. Then they both sat down to eat and the familliar
Cas is inside Dean and is confused af (aren't we all) while Dean takes a fat, well deserved nap. Sam, Eileen, and Jack are chillin. Everyone's happy. Right?
That's all you think of your friends. You have no faith in them. You expect them to have faith in you but you don't return any in response. You assume that Cas will leave you. Does he deserve that? Does he deserve to be reduced down to that?
No. You're just making excuses. You didn't try your hardest. All you did was thrust Sam into a life he didn't want and basically force him to be by your side. That's selfishness Dean. You were selfish. Hell you are selfish. You don't want to be alone yet you push everyone away? You can't have it both ways. Choose one or the other.
Castiel did not want to part with it at all. He was so enamored with it that he wanted to leave some sort of mark on it as a claim. This was his soul, and he would do anything in his everlasting power to keep it. As he put the finishing touches on Dean's body, his non-existant form filled with sorrow. He had to give up the soul that had utterly stunned him. For the first time since his existence, Castiel found himself wanting something. He wanted this soul. He wanted to feel it and watch it grow and spend every waking moment of his life with it. But unfortunately, this was something that he couldn't nor ever could have.
"Right now he's stuck in a nightmare. I don't know what exactly, but it's a doozy, that's for sure. My lord, the amount of self-hatred one human can have is astounding. He wants to die all the time! What a sad, sad soul this is." He wiped a fake tear away from his eye, all while that stupid grin remained on his face.
Upon regaining consciousness, the angel nearly wanted to cry upon finally being released from his head that had him caged like a bird. To be able to think without reliving every moment of loss and guilt he had felt in his entire lifetime was a huge relief in itself.
He quickly pulled out with his phone and fumbled with it before he dialed Castiel's number. But the phone went immediately to voicemail again.
Sam snapped back to the present and realized he had Dean's hand in his own and was also softly rubbing the coarse and rough palm. He sighed and gave it a quick loving pat before setting it down. Dean's eyes never shifted away from the ceiling and his body remained motionless, devoid of all life asides from the shallow rise and falls of his chest.
He paused again and licked his dry lips. The feeling was strange to him as he was used to the feeling of Jimmy's body as his own. Every single action he did as Dean seemed foreign. He was slightly taller. He had bowlegs. He felt a little sluggish as his cholesterol was shot up to levels that weren't humanly possible, even if Dean's body was severely malnourished. It definitely made him feel a bit uncomfortable and a tad embarrassed to be invading Dean's body, but he didn't have a choice.
But before he could finish his sentence Cas did his trademarked head tilt, signifying his confusion.
Dean's horniness was mostly to distract himself from the painful pressure and stabbing sensations in his head from the box. To forget, he reverted to a feral state of mind running solely on emotion and feelings. His emotions at that point consisted of only Castiel and getting rammed into the bed.
Castiel tried to push Dean away, and to be honest it wasn't that hard since all of Dean's muscles were virtually nonexistent. But Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel's head now, bringing their kiss in deeper.
A faint glimmer of hope appeared in Dean's heart. Castiel was actually alive? Sam and Jack were there so it must be Cas. They wouldn't let a shapeshifter or a fake Cas into the Bunker, right?
Cas breathed out and closed his eyes as he felt the slow healing process starting. The entire process was overwhelming because there was so much to be fixed. The urge to just snap it all away was so tempting, but the risk of Dean's body going into shock was just too great. They had to do this the slow and hard way.
Dean was ready to die. His eyes were deadpan and had nearly sunk in. Dark circles under his eyes highlighted his pale skin. Dean looked like death itself had come to claim him. Well, that was what was about to happen. Billie was obviously ticked at Dean's near death encounters, but this time, Dean was ready. He had lost everything he had held dear to himself other than Sam. He was ready for death to take him.
Castiel turned to look at Jack's face. He set his lips together and slowly nodded his head. He turned back towards Dean and kissed his hand very lightly, then letting it slowly drop to continue hanging on the bedframe. Then he stood up and patted Jack on the shoulder.
At these words, Castiel nearly lost his self control. He had hoped and prayed for so long for Dean would say those words. And now, they had finally come out of those sweet, pure and plump lips with pure sexiness dripping off of them.
Dean looked up at Sam and Castiel with scared eyes. He hated the feeling of helplessness that radiated off of him, but he couldn't control it. He had just woken up basically in a different body, with no recollection at all as to how he had procured it. But then he saw Castiel again and all concerns about himself flew off the wall. How was Cas here? He sighed and rubbed his face.
Castiel's breath hitched as sobs escaped his throat. 8 months. 8 long months he had spent in the Empty with Sam, Jack, and Eileen searching with no rest for either of them, and Dean... Dean staying down here and suffering like he was in Hell again.
"Well, at least you can enjoy food now." Jack said gaily, glad to have Castiel in good spirits. The angel nodded. He shoveled another bite of fruit cocktail into his mouth before continuing.
How the fuck were they supposed to fix him now? He wasn't even a person at this point, just a terrified animal trapped inside a cage.
After 12 long and excruciatingly painful years of pining, yearning, eye-fucking, and everything else inbetween, he finally admitted it to himself. He loved the stupid angel.
In his heart Dean knew that as soon as the light engulfed the darkness, he would be free. He would be free from this everlasting darkness and be reunited with Sam and...
"We're going." The two celestial beings said at the same time. Sam smiled and lightly chuckled to himself. Of course they were going. He was stupid to think otherwise. This was Dean they were saving.
"But wait, Dean. What is going to happen to the rest of the angels? And how are you going to get me out of here?" Dean's eyebrows furrowed and out of his pocket he pulled out the angel blade and the vial. At the sight of this, the other angels retreated, hatred in their eyes. But Dean remained unfazed. "Sorry, Cas. This'll sting a little. But it'll be worth it to get you back." Castiel opened his mouth to protest but Dean just put his finger to his lips and shushed the angel. Then with careful precision, he drew the blade along Cas's neck and drew out his grace. Cas grimaced with the pain, but he withstood it and gasped when it was done. He felt immediately weakened, but at least his grace was in good hands. He opened his mouth again to say something, but Dean shushed him again and pulled him into another hug. "Cas. I'll explain when we get back. But we need to get out of here."
He had no idea what was happening inside of Dean and Castiel's head, but he knew that it couldn't be good. He saw how Castiel had collapsed from the pain and how tightly he gripped his head, so Sam could only conclude that it had something to do with Dean.
"Maybe they thought the car was already trashed on the inside." Castiel offered. Sam glared at him but he shut the trunk and car doors. He then headed back towards Jack and Cas as they planned their next move.
He just about climaxed then and there, but somehow the guy sensed this and clamped down hard with his mouth, delaying his ejaculation. He grit his teeth and began thrusting into the Castiel's sexy mouth.
It started out innocent enough. They resumed the kiss session for another ten minutes, and Castiel would've been content if it weren't for the painful burning sensation in his pelvic area. He had to have more. So he did what any slutty angel would've done, and ripped off the shirts of the other two while quickly taking off his layers. Man #1 and Man #2 gazed longingly at his perfect, chisled body, marveling at his hip bones, abs, and his beautiful face.
Jack, Castiel, and Sam slowly approached the terrified man, but that did very little to help. Dean curled up into a tight ball and pushed himself up in the corner as far as he could go without breaking the wall. His breathing became ragged and he started scratching at his arm. Brutally. His nails tore into the newly formed flesh and drew long strips of blood all over his arms.
He hated their arguments. He hated yelling with his own brother. It made him sick to his stomach. He hated the feeling of loneliness that would follow afterwards. They were family, in fact the only family they had. When they fought, the entire family split apart.
He said this with the trademark Castiel quotes. Sam chuckled a tad bit to himself as he remembered Castiel's "people skills." Even if the angel was in Dean's body, he was still their naive friend who knew little of pop culture references. At least he could use air quotes properly now.
Sorry I don't have a consistent upload schedule I just have a really busy life that's filled with school and work and it's hard to find a few hours to sit and type these out, and when I span them out over a week like a normal person I tend to lose that *spark* yknow I'm so sorry but I still swear I'm going to finish this even if it takes 5 years please bear with me. As always thanks for reading.
"Sam. You know that we have to go through Dean's memories to find his soul. I'm sorry but it's something that-"
"Hey Cas." Dean whispered sensually in his ear, causing quiet shudders to travel up Castiel's spine. "Fuck me. Fuck me like we're dying. Push me into the bed, thrust that juicy cock in my ass, and make me scream. You know you want to, so just do it."
After washing his hands, he returned to Dean with another pair of longer scissors. He carefully snipped the tar-coated hair out of Dean's eyes and tried his best to get it to look like it used to. The process was nearly impossible though, because there was so much tar and blood that he couldn't hardly do anything. He would just have to settle by cutting the excess hair away from Dean's face and hope that Castiel or Jack could fix the rest of it.
"I'll take care of it. I swear I'll be back as soon as I can be. Now come on, get your asses of my head before I kick you out myself."
And now, in the present, they continued thrusting Castiel who was stuck in a spit roast. His dick was already leaking with so much precum it felt as though he had already cum everywhere. He moaned loudly and without restraint as his body was violated so good. Is this what he had been missing out on by catering to the Winchesters? God, he should've gotten a divorce sooner.
Dean and Cas smiled at him then turned to each other and smiled even brighter. Then they tilted their heads towards each other and made up for 12 years worth of unsaid words.
"I know Sam, I know. But you didn't see what I saw. This isn't some small chocolate box of trauma. This is the trauma, fear, pain, hopelessness, and just about every harmful emotion Dean's felt all this time, pretty much his whole life's worth. It's also forty years' worth of torture in Hell. Sam, this isn't something we can just dig up and bury again. I hate to say it but Dean made the right call in trying to bury all of it. If he hadn't, he would be far worse than what he already is."
So those few moments of consciousness, even if they weren't him and just him as a soulless SOB, were probably false. False hope. A false reality that he built up where Castiel, Jack, and Sam were all living happily in the Bunker. It was just another cruel trick his brain played on him. That little bit of consciousness was fake. He was stupid to believe that it was real.
But now with the Bunker door being beat upon, all of their heads snapped up. Eileen glanced worridly at Sam, and Sam back at her before his gaze shifted towards Jack. Sam's face set into a grimace and he pulled out his gun while cautiously going up the stairs. Jack and Eileen took cautious stances, standing for any kind of danger that would be presented behind that door.
Castiel solemnly shook his head. He had no idea that his death by Lucifer had impacted Dean this much. He also didn't know that Mary had gotten killed, or at least thought to be killed, after his own death. Dean did such a good job of hiding it that the angel never suspected a thing. He had just looked so happy... So happy when he gave Cas that ridiculous cowboy hat and so happy when they visited the Stampede Motel where Dean could satisfy his cowboy fetish... He had hidden his misery so well that no one noticed how miserable he had been only a few days before. Only Sam had noticed the change, but he was satisfied to see Dean in high spirits.
Jack searched with all his might. The soul was somewhere here. It had to be. They had searched nearly every other horrific memory of Dean's... So where was it? If only he had his God powers then he would be able to fix all of this with just a snap of his fingers but he couldn't. The urge was there and it was so tempting. Coaxing him to open the wall and let everything out. But no. He had to rescue Dean without them. As much as it pained him to prolong the agony of his second father, he had to resist the urge. He just wished that he could be more useful.
Castiel realized that he could now taste food without its molecular structure hiding the taste, for whatever reason. He perked up happily and took another bite, this one being nearly twice the size of the first. He closed his eyes gleefully and let the comfortable feeling of food rush throughout his body. He had missed this sensation. It was one of the few perks of being human. Enjoying sustenance.
The scene shifted and presented every panic attack Dean had endured and hidden from everyone. There weren't a lot, but enough to make an impact on important events in Dean's life. Everytime he felt them coming on, Dean hurridly excused himself and hid himself away in his bedroom or the bathroom to tremble and struggle to breathe all by himself. They watched as he felt one in public. This was only once, after Sam had left to go the library and he had nearly broke down the bathroom door trying to get in.
But now, they could eat without any worries for once, a fact that all of them relished and enjoyed to its fullest extent.
Jack stared at Dean as the broken man mumbled and blubbered out prayer after prayer after prayer. Praying to anyone, anything. Castiel. Jack. Castiel...
It had been over an hour since Dean slipped into unconsciousness and since Castiel had told both him and Jack of what had happened. They both looked obscurely at Cas as he described the sudden upsurge of Dean's sex drive, but Jack somehow came to the conclusion that he was fueled by emotions with no filter because he had locked his soul away. Kind of like what Sam did when he was soulless, but instead of being an utter asshole, Dean was just really horny for an angel.
But Castiel was asleep for all of that. Asleep and locked in the towering vault of his mistakes and past regrets. At first, the dreams were regrets he had made since his beginning. Little things. He should have created this, he should have killed that. Minor, trivial things that barely even passed as regrets.
No. Now was not the time to be mourning. They had Dean back and he was ok. They had rescued him and he was healing. He wasn't there presently, but he would be soon.
Castiel grit his teeth. Dean did have a point, but he was very fragile at this moment. Even more fragile than he usually was. But he relented.
But now wasn't the time to feel happy. Castiel sighed as the grim reality set in. This was the time to save Dean and get the hell out of there.
Next chapter should be up soon. I already have a lot of it written, it's just a matter of if I have the time to finish it soon haha
As Jack sifted through all of Dean's injuries, he realized the full extent of them. If it weren't for the witch and angel magic, Dean would have died approximately 200 times over. As his grace traveled through Dean's body, he could feel all the fear, hatred, anger, sadness, and hopelessness Dean felt at that time. Castiel could feel it too. They could also feel the amount of sheer pain he went through. Those sadistic monsters spared no expense in making Dean feel everything that they felt. And then there was that curse that caused him to feel ten times more pain than what was needed. Then the nightmares. They could feel all the fear and loneliness in his nightmares. Trauma and repressed emotions came pouring out into his mind and he had to relive through everything that he hated about himself.
The time he did the same thing with Gabriel played through his head. Only the angel's mouth had been sewn shut, but still, it was so sad to watch how broken Gabriel had become. The once powerful and prideful angel was reduced to a blubbering pile of screams and cries while his mouth had been sewn shut. The same thing now had happened to his own brother, and not just his mouth but his eyes had been ripped out and the eyelids sewed open so that the gaping holes were always there, staring, accusing Sam of his carelessness. Twice now he's had to heal people who were victims of cruel, cruel torture. How long would this go on? How long would he have to cut away thread that was embedded deep into flesh?
No no no no no Cas can't be dead. It's Cas. Cas never dies permanently. He'll be back. He'll walk from that wall and he'll be fine. It's Cas for God's sakes. He won't die. He absolutely won't.
"How he struggled against me, and he would have won too, if Gwynth hadn't been there. But she was. And that was that. We did it. We captured THE Dean Winchester. We won! And so to celebrate we made a GIANT announcement. You wanna know what we said?" He asked expectantly. Sam and Cas just stared murder at him. He laughed but continued.
On one particularly lazy day, Sam was idly sitting on his laptop. He was carelessly clicking on articles about current events, skimming through them and running his hands through Eileen's hair. She was relaxed on his chest, quietly dozing. He was about to close up when a particular title piqued his interest. He mentally debated about it for a while before deciding to go with his gut instinct and click it. He quickly read the article and debated with himself again. Should he tell everyone else or leave it be?
It couldn't last forever though, no matter how much he begged. Since when do we get what we deserve?
This small victory, this little, tiny thing that was positive in their miserable existences was life-altering. They had Baby.
No. He sat on the ground. And he screamed. He screamed and cried and wailed as he watched Cas die in front of him never to be seen again. And he didn't do anything even after Cas had said I love you and Dean wanted to say it HE HAD WANTED TO SAY IT FOR YEARS AND YEARS but he couldn't he just couldn't it was too much so he just stood there like an IDIOT a big dumb stupid idiot and only watched and then he-
Castiel felt utterly enervated at everything. When he was in The Empty, he was so disheartened. All sense of hope was lost. It was The Empty, the place where there was nothing to hope for. There was only a sense of longing that emanated from every angel and demon there. Upon his arrival, he was stuck inside the endless sleep that the other supernatural beings had experienced, but he was the only one actually asleep. Jack had exploded, causing The Empty to be "loud" and thus awakening every single deceased angel and demon since the beginning of time.
Then Sam cleared his throat and the uncomfortable silence set in. One question hung in the air that no one seemed to be grabbing. A question that was so hauntingly large, that it was surprising that it wasn't addressed earlier.
He slowly sat up from the bed to get a better look, but a grunt of pain escaped him as he irritated the scratches on his arms and legs. He looked down at his arms and saw they were covered with deep lacerations. Dean's eyes widened in shock as he turned his arms over and over, wondering how in the world he got those. Then he focused on his bare legs and felt the same pain in them. These were deep scratches, but for some reason they didn't look like the scratches of a werewolf or some psycho scarecrow. They looked like scratches human fingers would make. He was just about to ask how in the world he got those wounds when he saw his fingernails. They were bloodied and dyed a deep, crimson red. Dried blood resided in the cuticles and under the nail itself.
