After twenty minutes, they still didn’t get so much as a syllable out of him.
Sherlock takes his time answering, as the simple act of recalling the English language is a near-insurmountable task at present. “I... I am going to be incredibly sore in the morning.”
John laughed and plucked the acorn from the box to hold it up between thumb and forefinger. “So, not a wedding proposal.”
He was bound on an overhead suspension. An involuntary spasm set a chain rattling. Then his vision resolved, and the room became all too familiar.

Heart beating faster in his chest, Sherlock lifted his hand, placing it palm-up in hers. He watched as she revealed a long pin, maybe three inches of steel with a pearl head, flexing her fingers to extend it. It glinted in the light, sharp and thin. Curiosity and the remaining frisson of fear buzzed in his head like too much pinched bubbly at Christmas.
They climbed back out into the moonlit night, and Sherlock couldn’t help but feel horribly exposed. Any moment the gunfire would start again. They would get this far, just to be killed.
Sherlock soothed the spot with another kiss before straightening and shifting, pulling John close again. John was more than pleased to note the fine tremor in Sherlock’s hands as he skimmed his palms up John’s forearms along his biceps. John mirrored the motion, certain the anticipatory banging in his chest was audible.
John rolled over to face him, studied him for a long moment while Sherlock glared at him.
Helen’s movement became erratic before long; the noises escaping her stretched from quiet grunts into a series of clipped, arrhythmic moans. Abruptly she went onto the balls of her feet, her calves and thighs tightening as she rocked against him one last time before shuddering with her orgasm. Saliva and her fluids clung to his chin as he pulled back; he couldn’t begin to imagine what sort of mess he looked like.
Fingernails raked across his still-stretched hamstrings and Jim laughed. His slender fingers--cool to the touch--slipped lower and around to Sherlock’s front until they traced the length of the erection Sherlock’s thin yoga pants couldn’t hide.
# # # # #
The darker edge of John’s tone, there at the end, loving and possessive, sent another wave rippling through Sherlock. As his hips rocked against the blanket again, the movement was enough to shift one of the thorns dangerously closer to Sherlock’s cock, and the thrill of that only drove him further.
“I’d better not fuck it up, then, had I?” Lestrade’s voice was rough again, abraded.
“I don’t know--sir?” Inwardly Sherlock thought,
“So you
It burned on its way down, but not as much as the stuff he’d gotten the last time he’d rummaged her closet the Christmas before. He winced, having not brought anything to chase it with, and offered the bottle to Sherlock.
Sherlock told him and Emile immediately set to tapping at the computer. “I’ve got it here. Do you know if your fees will be billed through us, to either Ms. Chamberlain or to Mr. Moriarty? It’s in her name, but he’s the one that’s reserved the room.”

The pain at his nipples, the restriction of hands and sight and even his mouth, and now this--
and then some.
“No, Daddy. I’m not.” The admission sounded like it’d been pried from Sherlock, desperate and ashamed.
Sherlock closed his eyes, unable to meet her gaze any longer.
Sherlock clenched his teeth, regretting by the second entering into this asinine dare. This was the sort of trouble they only got into when the dearth of cases stretched into mind-numbing tedium.
Cassiline priests were world-renowned body-guards dedicated to Cassiel--the one angel who followed Elua but chose to stay at his side to protect him, rather than to find love and family and a plot of Terre D’Ange for his own. Often Cassiel was referred to as
Just then, Sherlock’s mobile rang, and John’s almost instantly after.
<3 Chuck
“Your hair has gone grey,” Sherlock says one evening, hunched over steaming chips. The acrid tang of vinegar lingers, a sharp stab in the olfactory centres of John’s brain.
“Very,” Sherlock answered, voiceless.
Mrs. Holmes shot him a warning look before laying a hand on his shoulder, though she still faced Sister Roberts. “Thank you for your time, sister. We’ll leave our offerings and be on our way.”
It clears his head in a way he absolutely loathes, and nothing stops the ache that presses from inside his ribs, which are excoriated and brittle in the wake of being gutted clean. The pain will shatter him from inside out, he knows this.
Sherlock spun it over his shoulders, letting the weight of it settle before plunging his arms into the sleeves--it fit just so over his suit jacket, and in his full-length mirror it looked as though she'd had it bespoke just for him. The effect was--well, dramatic, but in a way Sherlock thoroughly appreciated. The only hints of sangoire peeked from the edges of the lapels, the red buttonhole that blazed there. It made the red mark in his iris stand out, and for once Sherlock was proud to see it so noticeable.
“Now you’re just guessing. That thing’s going to fall any second now.”
“Should one of us shoot you, in the foot or the shoulder?” Sherlock asked before he really considered his words.
He tried to call out, then to speak, then to whisper. His voice cracked, nearly nonexistent.
“Isn’t that sacrilege?”
The noise John made then was completely undignified.
The big one, a barrel-chested kid taller than John, nearly wrenches away, but John snags the back of his shirt and wrestles him into a headlock. The small one starts grappling with John’s arm to free his ear.
“You like this?”
“That’s right, beg for it,” Sally grunted. She released the cuffs, dropping to press her front along his back, to grab onto his shoulders for leverage as she thrust harder, faster. “I want to hear you.”
Sister Verreuil’s smile was sombre. “Be that as it may. Walk with me?”
I know some of you might not dig OFCs, so this is your warning. :D
One summer day, six months into Sherlock's training, a knock sounded at the door of Irene's study, where Sherlock was holed up, poring over
“Please,” Sherlock whimpered.
Sherlock thought a moment, really weighing the new future stretching before John and himself, all the possibilities it promised. There would likely be intrigue, he was certain, and danger too--they’d already decided to continue the detective work--but still, they would be together, with no dire plots, no government-toppling intrigue. They could make a home for themselves, a life together. He would never have guessed that something like that would be his for the taking.
...but "Fight and Flight" sounded catchier.
Sherlock swallowed, could sense the trap on Jim’s question. If he answered, he’d do Naamah a disservice by lying, and besides, Jim had been an adept of Mandrake--he knew well the bonds between servants and their patrons. Then again, Jim had a wide possessive streak. Sherlock could stay silent, but then omission might be just as damning.

Before he could wonder too long, Mycroft’s name lit up his phone.
He closed his eyes and knocked.
“Does that mean I get to claim a forfeit?” Sherlock’s words are voiceless, only breath shaped into syllables, barely echoing off the acoustics of water and wood. His face is hidden in the shadow of the dock, and John finds himself pining for the moon, wishing he could see Sherlock’s face properly in its light just now.
Sherlock woke sometime later, though when he did he wished to every last of Elua’s Companions that he hadn’t. Though the sedative hadn’t worn off entirely, it had eased off enough to let him wake, to let him feel every last bit of abuse he’d endured.
“And that’s where I come in, isn’t it?”
His extremities tingle with pleasant warmth, and for the first time in the three months since Mary and the baby--since, well, since they’d been
“Relationship?” Sherlock tilted his head at that. Then his eyes darted over John’s face, and John could almost see the wheels turning. “Your last two years of medical school, but she wasn’t thrilled when you wanted to go into service.”
“Where are you taking me?”
stand talking to him, and that only for his coin.”
“Not in the slightest,” Sherlock whispered.
His ploy did not go unnoticed. John licked his own lips. “All it takes is a yes,” he teased.
But then Emile met Sherlock’s eyes and gasped.
Darkness settled solid and snug over London, calling the neon and fluorescent out to dazzle. The London humidity hazed their glow, transforming it into something reckless and desperate.
John couldn’t tell who he hated more for it, himself or them.
Sherlock realised.
--Fun fact about The Berkeley: it was built on the site of a previous club called
John thought.
“This is as new to you as it is to me.”
So rather than answer the sea, he calls Sherlock.
“It’s unlikely Amelia has left Jim’s.” Sherlock crossed his arms and looked for all the world like a petulant child. “I
Sherlock’s voice caught his attention, muffled beneath water and ringing gunfire. “John--we’ve got to--”
# # # # #
Sherlock thought as he leaned forward.
At his side, one hand fisted and flexed, the ghost-like sensation of such a mark mirrored in his own hand.
John thought,
But Ames slacked completely, and ran a hand across the buzzed scruff on the back of his head. “You’re talking about--that conversation you and I had during your last visit, aren’t you?” His words came out as a statement, their weight enough to sink to the bottom of the Thames.
Sherlock smiled at that, even as John made a confused noise. “William nó--?”
“Nope!” He grunts as he catches the smaller one by the ear--an effective maneuver his mum had used on him many a time in his younger days--and the bigger one by the elbow.
Most times, John’s gorgeous girth is enough. It’s enough to feel that fat glans as it pushes past his lips, slides slick and bitter across his tongue and crowds his mouth; it’s enough to burn sweet and sharp as John pushes in elsewhere, until Sherlock is seated on that lovely cock and biting his lip with joy, sure that he will be sore in the morning no matter how much lube they’ve used.
Startled, John yielded with a noise lost between them, a cry for help and a prayer answered. His cane clattered to the frozen ground as he clung to Sherlock. Sherlock pressed his lips to John’s, soft and chilly from the air, hiding a furnace of heat within. He ran his tongue along the seam, until with a punch-drunk exhalation John opened to him.
Lestrade frowned. “I don’t know anything about bloody flowers--”
They agreed continue like this, as adept and patron, until Frédérique made his
Elua, didn’t Sherlock know
It was no surprise then, when Sherlock jumped back like he’d been slapped. “I was joking,” he said a smidge too quickly. “Just a joke. See how silly truth or dare is? If you’d taken me seriously, you would have done something truly stupid, indeed.”
John took a sip of the Scotch. It burned smoky and clean.
# # # # #
Selfishly Sherlock immediately thought of the UK-D’Angeline Ambassador’s daughter, Madelyn D’Arbos, her body left in an abandoned flat. “Someone wants to harm France and Terre D’Ange’s presence globally.”
Sherlock dropped to kneel at Amelia’s feet, his eyes downcast. Fingers
And, if John were being honest with himself, if there was some way to drag Moriarty’s name into the mud through all of this, it would be worth it.
Would this have been the case, if he’d been assigned to a dignitary, some faceless head of state? Someone older than him, someone with a family and a decent, respectable career?
swaying gently around him in the cool breeze. His bare feet sank into warm soil, soft from rain. John understood why Elua had fallen in love with the earth and its people. Before him Elua's statue stood, the smiling god who bestowed his love and his gifts so freely.
“It was a thousand things.”
John pulled out his mobile, tapped out a number and hit send.
Sherlock told himself. This was biology 101, and Sherlock wrapped himself in it like a blanket, safe and familiar.
And then John shifted again, and with no preamble he took Sherlock’s cock in his mouth, tongue lapping at the frenulum before he slid down further to take in as much of it as he could.. He wasted no time in setting the pace, occasionally glancing up to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
“Well he’s not, is he?” John snaps.
A crippled civilian who could protect Sherlock no better than a commoner, thanks to a ruined shoulder and a defect in his brain. Sherlock would have absolutely no use for him, then. He’d be dismissed, and utterly alone.
John thought as he drained his pint glass,
inside sloshed slightly, reflecting the light with silvery clarity.
want to meet Sister Molly or anyone else in the process. Just as he stepped out into the corridor between the alcoves and the bare earth,  he heard John’s voice and froze.
That slight milimetre of progress eroded away at the mention of his job. John stiffened and fell a step behind Sherlock, his eyes fixed on the middle-distance once more.
“Well, erm, if you accept--”
“I--” John shook his head. "I don't know where to begin."
. I observe.” Sherlock didn’t hide his testiness. “What do you want?”
“Or so I’ve led you to believe,” John retorted with a chuckle.
, that ringing drowned out all noise and fury burned in his bones. He couldn’t breathe.
And Sherlock, as the food had filled him and the cherry Coke had invigorated him, had turned sideways to stretch his legs along the booth, resting his back against the cool window. He launched into a meandering discussion that was nothing short of entertaining: he deduced the couple up by the register were in fact meth-makers, the table of ladies two booths away were all in college nearby and that one of them had just discovered she was pregnant. A gaggle of very drunk men in Carhartts and workboots who stumbled in were all on their way back from a local gay bar. This bled, uncharacteristically, into a story about Sherlock’s first experience at a gay bar--and being the only one of their number actually hit on by a woman.
written plain in the pinch between his brows.
And how would John take that? He’d insisted that he accepted Sherlock’s service, that he’d be okay with that, but it would be something else entirely to accompany Sherlock now, to wait and
John stood in the kitchen of
“I swear,” Sherlock huffed, the hallway still swimming in the aftermath of a head injury and the fulfillment of every last prayer he could’ve ever had.
“It’s nothing,” Sherlock answered; the shame of the truth felt too heavy. Elua, what if Sherlock
“This is ridiculous,” Brother Rocaille snapped. “I say we take this to our chambers to deliberate. In the meantime, Watson, you would be
When they were finished, Sherlock stood before the mirror once more, unable to hide beneath the gauze, which went on as a simple tunic and pair of rustic-cut drawstring trousers, just tight enough to stretch taught with movement. The diamonds scratched, and the sheer fabric soothed, whispered against his skin. The feathered mask hid all but his jaw and the bright fleck of red in his iris. The velvet collar clung to his neck, the diamond dipping into the hollow at its base.  This would be--
“What’s your signal?” he asked, a new realisation hitting him. There had to be some way to ensure to Roxanne D’Arbos that she’d completed her task.
He heard a creak from the next room: the tell-tale depression of springs. The squeak of the wooden bedframe. John sat up from where he’d been slouching toward the text, eyes boring through the wall he shared with Sherlock. A blush burned instantly at his cheeks, his neck, his ears.
Sherlock kneeled at the base of the massive statue, forehead pressed to Elua's feet. His hands and feet were bound in bronze manacles, heavy with Kushiel's chains. The curse of Naamah's grace hung heavy in the air around them. It infected John until it boiled his blood and set his skin afire. Prayers to Cassiel for relief went unheard.
“But what would the two of you make of it?” Dianne asked. “Once you’d caught the end of a thread that drew your interest?”
Sherlock stifled a cry, knuckle between teeth, just imagining the way Jim might look, nude save for the dark glimmer in his eyes as he wielded a flogger. Even in his mind his vision was painted in red and shadow. Sherlock stroked faster, nearly on the edge of orgasm.
Morbid embarrassment replaced all that vulnerability in John’s chest. “Leave it alone, Sherlock. Just go back to bed. Or to your violin. Good night.”
She held her hands out, one holding a golden wafer, the other a glass of deep red wine. The wafer on his tongue melted into the golden sweetness of honey, the wine heady and bitter.
“What’s he done this time?” The way she cocks her head does nothing to dispel the raccoon image.
Buckle up, y'all. :D
? Was their compatibility that distasteful to Mycroft?
John clenched his jaw until the muscle there shifted under his skin; he delivered a swift Cassiline bow and backed away, silent.
“You can’t be serious sir.”
my favourite pupil. You have so much--” Brother Vincent cleared his throat, his face twisting in an all-too-familiar attempt to push weaker emotions away. “I never really thought you were the same as the other young men and women that come through our doors.”
With that she reached for the other parcel, placed it across his lap. Something tremored behind John’s breastbone as he undid its wrappings.
Sherlock thought.
"Not another Cassiline, I hope."
Sherlock barely had time to slide free before Neck Tattoo dropped to his knees. He turned, jerked John’s dagger free from its new home just in time to see Meth-Teeth clamber to his feet and Ringleader tackle John to the ground.

, Sherlock thought.
“Well that sounds real nice,” Connie said. John wondered if she was a grandmother, because it was the same tone his own gran had used on him as a child. It wasn’t condescending, just simple and sweet. Despite himself, John found himself liking their waitress. “A’ight, I’ll be right back with yer drinks. Y’all sit tight.”
Sherlock slid into the spell, that beautiful subspace where he could let go and rely on Sally to guide him. His body relaxed, doe-eyes downcast. “Yes--” He faltered, unsure of what pronoun to call her.
“Elua, Sherlock--” this not-John gasped, before yanking Sherlock down to devour him, consume him with a kiss.
“What does this have to do with anything? I just got out--”
“Admit it, Sergeant Donovan, curiosity’s got the cat.” He poured every last bit of his training into that sentence, his voice curling deep and sure.
“No, you idiot.” Sherlock snapped at John.
Mrs. Hudson joined him, staring a moment before she rested light fingertips against the topmost scratch. She let out a thoughtful hum. “You really don’t recognise this?”
John didn’t waste any time grabbing his hand and dragging Sherlock back to his bedroom, where they proceeded to spend the remainder of the evening going over the... ah... terms and conditions of the winnings.
“John, oh, Naamah--”
but Sherlock loved it.
“I’ve been miserable most of today,” Sherlock admitted in return. “It was easy to deduce what choices they would give you. I was certain you would choose their terms of re-admission. Until Venice I was certain you despised me.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Instead he studied John’s frame, the steady tic of his pulse at his throat. “On the one hand, Angelo’s fettucine is homemade and I hear it’s rather good, but if you’re more the dim sum type--” that earned a twitch at the corner of John’s mouth “--ah, yes. Okay. Chinese it is.”
. Care to solve a mystery and save the day?”
They compiled her testimony, what little evidence remained, and had left her stranded at the hospital.
“Yeah?” came Lestrade’s voice on the other end.
When it became apparent to them both that Sherlock could, indeed, go another round, Victor hummed smugly to himself, and loosened the sash covering Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock blinked rapidly, the dim light too-bright after being so long in the darkness.
into their time alone. The anticipation thrilled in Sherlock’s veins.
, to “free her up” if only she’d run away with him.
He didn’t give Sherlock time to wonder at that cryptic statement. Sherlock followed the sound of footfalls across the room, the near-quiet squeak of a hinged door opening.
“Irene has trained you as best she could,” Jim commented idly later, tracing a fingertip along a score curving around the edge of Sherlock’s rib. “I’m almost impressed.”
John relaxed into his customary parade rest, then, barely comforted to be granted a reprieve from Sherlock’s and Sally’s ridiculous fighting. It wasn't necessarily that he disagreed with her most of the time--he hated the way they baited one another. It was a childish waste of time.
“Kneel.”
“Your wife is suspected of several murders, Mr. Chamberlain, as well as framing an innocent man for it. Now what we have to determine is your innocence.”
“Our family kept the story alive, but I can think of no more worthy owner. You have sacrificed the same way he did. I want you to keep this as a token of respect.”
THE CRUX OF equinox is not enough, not yet, to dispel the winter chill that huddles in night-time puddles, gripping the wind and pushing it along the midnight streets. The nearby village only has one high street, if it could even be called as much.
Here John hesitated again, and did not go into any further detail over his revelations--not the least of which concerned the possibility that all of the Companions had made their own sacrifices, and that Naamah’s could’ve been just as high as Cassiel’s own. No, now was neither the time nor place for that can of worms.
“Very little,” John admitted. He’d attempted to learn what he could of their folklore, but there was very little to be found save for the few mentions in the Ysandrine Cycle and a scan of an old portrait. The woman held the same scarlet droplet in her eye, her expression every bit of the same immodesty Sherlock wore. “One stopped a war, didn’t she?”
“She was, and more,” Sister Roberts answered. “Let me get your mother, and we’ll discuss what it means--but I’ll spare her the more, ah, intimate details of what your situation entails.”
, for my sake?”
Sherlock was only mildly disappointed to find he wasn’t ensconced in some dimly lit sex dungeon, but the night was still young.
He made damn sure, however, that his face remained neutral, relaxed. It would do nobody any good--least of all Sherlock--if Moriarty saw how much John disliked him.
, Sherlock had taken to puttering around the townhouse in his pyjamas. John had stepped out, insisted on a walk to clear his head.
Sherlock propped himself so that he could take her shaft into one hand, and traced the fingertips of his free hand along her inner thigh, over one strap and ever-closer to her labia.
Apollinaire chuckled. “It’s best to keep one's prospects in sight. The man is loaded--and so insanely well-connected I’d be surprised if he couldn’t sweet-talk his way into an assignation with the Queen.”
Ms. Adler howled with laughter. “You’re going to be a pain in my arse, aren’t you? But you’re right--I can’t pass up an honour like this. What are your terms?”
John caught Sherlock glancing at him, then. Sherlock’s expression betrayed a flicker of fragility before he shook it off, closed his eyes to think. That moment, though: the marginal widening of those eyes, blue-green-gold with that unmistakable red mote, the minute slackening of the jaw--little more than parting the lips, really--was just another pang straight to John's sternum.
“Rachel Howells, mid-thirties.” Lestrade gestured at the body before them, bent unnaturally on the cellar floor. She’d been found in the bottom of an abandoned house by some neighbor-kids two weeks after Victor’s arrest.
to denote the beginning and end of that particular act.
“Please tell me you’ve only just taken off a face mask, Sherlock. The fumes from that--”
His thoughts raced:
“nó Jasmine,” Sherlock answered. It would be safer to keep his name clear, and was common for adepts to take their House-name if they wished to protect their birth name in the digital age. “Call me William.”
“Tonight?
Sherlock let out a heavy breath, and at this point even breathing stoked the fire.
# # # # #
Sherlock’s head dropped back against the blanket, a nearby stem grazing his ear but not enough to distract him from the sensation of John filling him slowly. Once John was done, their hips pressed flush, Sherlock opened his eyes again and tugged John down for another kiss. This one was sweet, unhurried, where before there had been desperate frenzy.
John breathed in deep, new tears springing to his eyes--but these were from the swelling in his chest, the wholeness, the completion he’d come to find in Elua’s presence. He couldn’t keep the smile from his face, the one that etched deep into his cheeks and the creases by his eyes. He laughed even as he scrubbed at them with the heels of his palms.
with great pride my star student, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”
It isn’t uncommon, the few times they have rented a car, for Sherlock to insist they pass the entirety of a trip sans radio. Nor is it uncommon for John to pass the ride in silent contemplation of the man beside him, wondering what he is about. Tonight is no different. Sherlock stares at the road before them in singleminded focus, sure, but there’s something withdrawn in the way he’s avoided John’s questions this whole trip, the calculating gleam of uncertainty as the lights of London fade away and they roll out toward the country.
John was unfit for service. Sherlock would be better off if John resigned his gun, accepted his failure and his damnation. At least Sherlock could be assigned a better guard, if that were the case.
A memory slammed into him, inexorable: the dream he’d had shortly after his arrival at
they became Victor’s benefactor? Had Victor’s debts that had driven them to that state?
“Spread your legs for me, love,” John said gently. Sherlock could imagine the intent look on John’s face, the one he usually wore when he was concentrating on getting it just right.
“He’s contracting me for a night with--with Amelia?” Sherlock couldn’t hide the confusion and dismay in his voice. “Amelia Chamberlain?”
“I’m sure he’ll explain in due time. You two will have a respectable amount to recount.”
“I’m fine.”
"You're redesigning the House marques?" Sherlock asked, unable to hide the surprise in his voice. The current designs for each House were the ones set several decades ago by the main branch of each still in Paris. Traditionally a council from the main Houses in Paris met to negotiate a new design, but the last time might have been turn of the century.
“S’at so?” Ringleader sneered. A switchblade
Lips pressed just barely against her shaft, he whispered, “Sir, may I touch you, too?”
Bryony was at the front. Sherlock skimmed down until he found Frederique’s name highlighted. Both the date and Victor’s name in the patron column, right where he expected them.
The air was slightly chilly, but that wasn't really what had Sherlock shivering; it was the anticipation of the tattoo gun, the god-awful drone, the curiosity of what sort of pain he would experience. Even the anticipation was… distracting.
What would Sherlock do? How did he keep the bomb from exploding down here and destroying the whole building?
to John’s if they were indeed threatened.
“Drop it, Brother Watson, unless you’d rather perform the
He leveled a barbed gaze at her. Whatever this mousy little woman had to say, he had absolutely no care to hear it.
Sherlock stumbled toward the desk, the vague shape of things beginning to coalesce. His pulse hammered in his throat, hoping he was right.
Sherlock jerked back and tore at his hair. “Why, Elua? Why did you give me an
This,
John clenched his jaw, let his gaze slide out into the sanctuary, to Elua’s ever-smiling face. “I recall.”
As he worked along her shaft, giving her every possible visual cue he could, he gently circled her clitoris with his thumb, the little nub already swollen. She let out a noise at that, and he kept at it as he licked the length of her cock, just until her eyes squeezed shut and her hips jerked, trying to find more and better friction.
Sister Verreuil regarded John thoughtfully, her grass-green eyes holding his gaze. “Brother Watson, what were your initial concerns regarding Mr. Moriarty?”
It filled Sherlock with warmth, sunlight bursting through a thunderhead, a sharp thrill like beach glass after a lightning strike. He breathed John in, sweet and comfortable like the scent of apples, of home.
Emile and his coworker wheeled the contraption in through the servants’ entry, letting the booming bass from the party within escape into the taut silence of the hallway. Two minutes later Emile and his coworker reappeared, Dianne in tow.
“Oh, certainly not!” Moriarty laughed, all too pleased with himself. “Not at all. I wouldn’t
"Remember, love." She ran her fingertips along Sherlock's cheekbone, the ghost of a lacquered fingernail tracing his skin. "Every. Last. One." Each word was punctuated with a tap on his nose.
He would never have met a problem like Sherlock Holmes. But he never would’ve faced an eternity of torment for that, either.
Sally’s flat was nothing special. Plain walls with predictable artwork, the sort of mediocre decor befitting someone who mainly lived at her job. But the woman herself was hardly recognisable: hair pulled back in a low chignon while wisps sprang free to caress her neck, bolder makeup that accentuated her cheekbones, her lips. But the biggest surprise was what she wore: a bespoke suit, deep charcoal grey, that obscured every feminine curve and built instead a masculine silhouette.
Someone grabbed Sherlock by the sash, yanking him toward the contraption. Another guest threw it open, a heavy crack as the top panel flopped backward and hit the base. When the first set of hands pushed him forward he bent low of his own volition, resting his neck and hands where they were meant to go. Fear and delight in equal measure pounded in his blood, beat loud in his ears.
That noise promised hunger, promised such a good bruising.
John calls when the ache gets to be too much, when the siren song is too loud, when the answers to his prayers are not forthcoming. It’s not a remedy, nor even a palliative. It’s merely the auto-function of an organism instinctually delaying the inevitable just a little longer.
what I trained for. That’s the easy part, compared to--” John stopped himself, aware of what he was about to say.
Then Sherlock dove forward, driving his shoulder into Smith’s spine, and sent them both sprawling across the ground. Sherlock sat up quickly, a work of wonder in his own right, to grab Marcus’s arm and twist it back and up, a classic defensive pin.
“Is it so impossible for you to work out?” Sherlock tugged at his hair, vitriol rising from his center. Lestrade had called them back in--not that Sherlock had intended to do anything other than storm the ‘Yard that night, anyhow--and it felt like they were all just shy of spilling blood in his office.
Then a flash of insight occurred to him, though it was one that he hated to follow. It could lead him further down the rabbit-hole toward some larger plot against the D’Angelines in London, and he hoped to all nine gods he was wrong.
“Did you do as I asked?” Here a note of uncertainty crept into her voice, try as she might to reinforce it with iron.
All the way down the treacherous corridors, echoes and the noise of a building slowly succumbing to nature creaked around them, playing tricks on the ear. There were half a dozen times their little group froze, absolutely certain the guards were already tailing them.
And yet to deny the bait dangled before him would smack of sentimentality, wouldn’t it? His brother would never comprehend what it meant to serve, so to refuse the case would be tantamount to opening himself up to Mycroft for a whole slew of judgement.
Sherlock’s mind spun in place as they rode the elevator up to Amelia’s floor. He wrestled with his goal and curiosity as Emile led him down the hall. Before he could reach a decision they paused at Amelia’s door as Emile slid in the key-card. The door unlocked with a thick, mechanical click.
--aimed directly at his head.
He straightened his aching spine, looked to his shaking hands in the guttering light of the near-spent votives.
“What the hell
“Make yourself comfortable and I’ll go fetch Ms. Adler. Won’t be but a moment.” Her smile was polite, her tone perfunctory.
Sherlock growled in frustration. “Fine. I’m glad we’ve got this sorted.”
The smaller of the two looks up, slaps his friend’s shoulder, and they both turn to haul arse. Even drunk as he is, John is still faster.
John sighed in acquiescence.
His mood only darkened as he stepped into 221 to find his breath still clouding before his face. In that way only buildings could manage, it felt colder within, despite the shelter from the wind. The sodding furnace was out.
“Tell me Sherlock…”
# # # # #
When he could move no more, John collapsed there in the dirt. The mess didn’t matter. He drank in air thick as honey while the rain abated and the humidity ripened. Sweat stung his eyes and a familiar pain clogged his throat. A single thought pounded with his pulse.
“When do you propose we begin?”
“All right,” Sherlock murmured from his perch. “Here she comes, John. You’re ready?”
Outside on the kerb, Sherlock still clutched at his throbbing cheekbone, glad for the distraction. If he couldn’t have the dossier from the Night Court Houses, he could at least have… well. A lovely thought to occupy his afternoon. And the potential for another inroad with London’s finest.
Sherlock’s only welcome was a terse, “Get your arse in here,” when Sally opened her door.

In Carey’s books, Romani/Tsingano people are a major presence, both as a people oppressed and underrated as well as a strong alliance to the main character, Phèdre (occasionally they perform as Phèdre's "homeless network," actually!). They are portrayed in a very positive light. Two Tsingano characters possess what they refer to as the

And it draws a
Sherlock’s words hang heavy in the space between them. Despite the cool breeze, the air is too humid to breathe properly.
Of course Irene had found it funny and appropriate to saddle her debutant pupil trained to sexual pleasures with a sodding virginal warrior-priest.
Beyond the Eluine priests, triumph brightened Brother Rocaille’s face at the exact same moment that Brother Vincent’s heart visibly broke.
The car ride from Moriarty’s penthouse had been fraught, and despite framing the question every way he knew how, John couldn’t get a decent explanation from Sherlock. And now,
“I think it would be best if we got back home.”
How perverse was this, John wondered. How blasphemous?
“I. Am. Busy!”
“Cover me, John!”
Lips brushed his ear, and John bit back a whimper.  “I’m sorry, John. I lied,” Sherlock rumbled. “There is no case.”
4.) Method #12: Victory Method
might be obeyed? What would stop anyone from hurting him beyond his wishes?
Sherlock watched, aching for John, as John moved forward, placed his palm on Elua’s shin. His mentor watched John too, a genuinely bereft expression on his face.
For as long as Sherlock could remember, he’d had a bright red dot in his left iris, bold and bloody against the cooler hues of his eyes, which were green or blue or gold-shot depending on the light. He had been long-diagnosed with sectoral heterochromia, which explained the blue-green-gold; until then his parents had assumed it was also to blame for the red spot, though no one had ever seen vivid scarlet as a colour manifested by the genetic trait.
the centre of my whole world. Every path and crossroad leads to you. I will do everything in my power to prove that to you for as long as you’ll have me.” Sherlock closed his eyes, prayed it didn’t sound as ridiculous to John as it suddenly did to him. He meant every word of it, but that didn’t stop it from sounding silly.
John nodded. “And is that all you see?”
Sherlock’s Italian was rusty, the last thing on his mind, but still. He knew enough to get by.
The look on Luca’s face didn’t suggest that he understood a single word of Frédérique’s story, but he leaned forward all the same, laid a light hand across that nobby, arched spine and rubbed in slow circles, whispering the nonsense that supersedes all languages, that unintelligible wish for peace.
Lestrade shrugged, the thought lost in the pleasant buzz of a shared pint or two, tossed his jacket on the sofa. He flicked on the lamp nearby, dim golden light painting his features with warmth.
“I’ve got it here.” She dug into her apron pocket and produced the missing mobile. “It was that detective from the Yard calling you.”
The fire was a far more potent soporific than Sherlock would have guessed. Within minutes his muscles began to unfurl, to melt into the warmth and the softness of the quilts he lay between. His eyes grew heavy.
“I’m not leaving,” John promised. “I’ll never leave you.”
Mycroft raised his eyebrow, and Sherlock knew that point wouldn’t be conceded.
. I did this for
“I love you.”
“I couldn’t help but think about you sometimes,” Sherlock continued. “What you might hear, what you would see if you misunderstood and barged in… Part of me wanted you to see.”
Sherlock thought, and almost felt silly for it. It was still difficult, sometimes, to believe in a pantheon that defied the ordered logic of the scientific realm. But here he was, touched by one god and dedicated to another. It was a bit late to go back on that.
At , twenty-two, Frédérique knew the best way to help quickly was to take his natural bent for maths and his pretty face, and follow Naamah’s grace to Bryony House-Paris. His father, deathbed-ridden though he was, disowned him; Frédérique was forced to renounce his family name and take the House’s name, instead. Frederique nó Bryony.
), but I literally *just* found ANOTHER (
Sherlock whimpered.
Irene had, after Sherlock's agreement, left him there to his fate while she and Kate went to run errands. Only John remained, still camped out in the front waiting area, likely scowling enough to scare off any clientele.
Sherlock didn’t know what to say to that, so he laid a hand on Wilkerson’ thinning hair. He hadn’t been sure at first why Irene would vouch for the squirrelly, unattractive little man, but now he had a better idea. It wasn’t the worst way he’d ever spent an evening, certainly.
She couldn’t have been more wrong. The more Sherlock saw of this temple, the more he wanted to investigate its mysteries.
“Does it?”
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut as John finished his inspection, swallowing down that thought. It didn’t matter what either of them felt, if John even felt the same way he did. John was a Cassiline, dedicated through and through to his brotherhood, to the one angel to abandon all earthly enjoyment to stay by Elua’s side, content only in service.
On a more personal note, I knew about two short stories in the Kushiel-verse (
John couldn’t say a word to that, instead found himself hungry: he needed to taste more. He pushed forward, kissing Sherlock deeper this time. Sherlock responded in kind, then reluctantly pulled back.
“I do!” Irene produced a manila folder tucked under her thigh and offered it to Sherlock.
Even now, he refused to give in so easily--he was the best, the one most suited for this sort of play, wasn’t he? He wouldn’t dare shy away from this--an act that even his teaching had thought fit to skip over--simply because it was unknown. Sherlock gave a jerky nod.
That was it, then. Sherlock would live his life, and whenever Kushiel decided to ring him up with his destiny, he’d deal with it then. Or not.
John shifted, nearly on his side, and pulled Sherlock’s leg closer.
John drew in a deep breath, reigning himself. “I think I'm starting to see why Irene hired me. D’you get into scrapes like this often?”
“Let’s hurry,” Sherlock whispered when he pulled back, his words a puff of steam between them.
So this was the game, then. The no-win scenario. Sherlock could do this.
“Believe what you like,” Moriarty crooned softly. “Doesn’t matter, does it? All it would take would be a few well-placed emails, I think. Brother Vincent worries about you
Sherlock bit hard into the ball, swallowing reflexively. He whined around his gag.
By this point a small crowd has begun to form--party guests from inside have spilled out to watch the tussle. He’d forgotten to shut the door.
John could follow.
“That’s it,” John snapped. “I’m calling this assignation off. What would Irene think, knowing you’re doing this?”
When Jim spoke, it took every iota of willpower to keep from breaking his teeth. “Daddy’s waited for some time now, Sherlock. I know it must have been

would apparently be blind-sided by anyone who had the opportunity to dominate him. Was he that common, that easily swayed?
A birthday present, Jim had called it.
A new voice curled up from an alleyway beside them: “S’at what I think it is?”
Victor drew in Sherlock's bottom lip, giving it a sharp nip before releasing him. "Are you ready?"

-- The first stanza of Les Chants des Quarante-huit Heures, the songs and methods Cassilines are taught to accompany specific combat forms in The Counting of the Hours.
It sounded like a threat, like a promise.
Sherlock could hear the way John had probably assumed that sentence would likely end:
It certainly didn’t help that Jim was there, peering at him from the outskirts at all times. His presence was a buzz at the base of Sherlock’s skull, the press of a razor-sharp gaze between his shoulderblades.
Still, he’s borne it with good humour as they inspect the last of the streamers and fake spider-webs. The nearby dining room table stretches beside them, laden with every stereotypical Halloween treat: graveyard-dirt cupcakes with gummy-worms, little pumpkins made from peeled clementines and small wedges of celery, electric-green punch with a hand-shaped chunk of ice floating in it, a bowl of disgusting sour-cream-and-salsa made to look like vomit. The works. If it weren’t for Greg’s mum making it all before his parents had left for a country bonfire, they’d likely just be foraging on half-stale bags of crisps and soda.
When Sherlock called John in, John found him sitting on the bed, hair still damp from his shower. His pyjamas were the familiar loose, soft ones John recognised from countless mornings in Maison Adler. It stirred something bittersweet in John’s chest.
The clamps tugged gently, one at a time, as Wilkerson added the thin little chains to their ends, and the minute click as the weights were clipped on were the only warning he got before the pull intensified, the clamps straining just that much more against his flesh. The pain, sharp and sweet, thrummed in his veins until he let out a small cry.
Sherlock breathed in deep, breathed out slow. He was the incessant howl of the wind, the roar of the waves. He was not Sherlock Holmes,
Furthermore, Mr. Ames didn't have a trace of French accent, and it was highly unlikely he'd spent any amount of time there learning his trade. So even though he was House-trained (Eglantine, obviously, as their bent was creativity of any kind), the extreme unlikelihood that he would be chosen over a native D’Angeline set a great bar of expectation for the quality of his work.
The toy in question is a large hollow strap-on, dark purple silicone and artfully veined. Its interior is soft and more pliant than its exterior. Sherlock waits with barely-contained patience as John drizzles a measure of lube into it before smearing more onto his cock. John slips it on, and it increases his girth by another half-inch all the way around, adds to his modest length another inch.
“I certainly endeavor not to, sir.”
Sherlock's final footsteps into the kitchen changed all that, however.
So Sherlock followed his mother silently, his sulk apparent though he was smart enough not to voice his opinions, which were about as atheist as they came. He just wanted to get this all over with and get home to his experiments. It was a perfect waste of an afternoon.
Sherlock nearly choked on his tea. So John
Sherlock couldn’t help but stare wide-eyed at the body on the street before him. “John--we’ve got to--”
The driver put the car into park and came round to open Sherlock’s door. John climbed out and fell into stiff parade rest at Sherlock’s side and slightly behind, his proximity and dour disapproval entirely distracting.
John thought again of his dreams. The crossroads, always the crossroads.
A hard slap rang through the stillness, Sherlock’s thigh burning from the weight of Lestrade’s hand. He couldn’t hide the noise he made, then. Somewhere between a keen and an affirmative, it was mortifying. But it did nothing to dampen how much he wanted Lestrade.
“Yeah?” John asks with a grunt, his fingertips sunk deeply enough into the soft flesh of Sherlock’s arse that he might leave bruises. He slides back, thrusts again, long and sure. “Who takes care of you?”
Lime kool-aid, sprite, and just a lot too much vodka. It’s disgusting. He deposits it onto the cheap spiders-and-bats paper tablecloth and slips outside.
We're getting so close! Only two chapters left...
John studied him again with hard eyes, which raked over Sherlock in a way that left him feeling bare. It was odd that untrained John seemed to have the same effect as his brother’s eagle-eyed gaze, as Irene’s or Moriarty’s. Sherlock fought the urge to shift uncomfortably.
“But a few years later he got loose, set off for the road. An oncoming car crushed his hips, and I had to put down the only friend I’d ever made besides Mycroft.”
“And what happens if I win?”
London had gifted them with a miserable summer rain that washed the dawn sky white-grey. His training clothes clung to him, slick and taut. Before they'd gotten back home, a downpour had pummeled the earth of Irene’s little courtyard, bruised the lavender and gardenia. Loam and floral cloy swelled in his throat. Sleep-deprivation submitted to livewire adrenaline--sweat in the eyes and pulse in the ears. John's chest heaved from his exertion. The air tasted green--life, life, life.
Sherlock watched him through all of this; John’s face betrayed nothing but the economy of expression that always came when John lost himself to a course of action. His face was blank, his eyes sharp, as he stooped beside Cecily and Frédérique.
know how to do our job,” Sally chimed in, the scorn plain in her voice. “You haven’t given us anything we couldn’t have worked out for ourselves quite quickly. Must be nice to be
Then, in the span of one blink, of three, Sherlock’s shoulders twisted. John’s breath caught, and in unspoken agreement they met in the middle.
John pointedly tuned out their conversation as he continued making his tea, resolutely focused on replaying his pre-dawn failures.
Just the week before, the D’Angeline embassy in Germany had fallen victim to an explosion. Authorities deemed the event linked with the bombing in the U.S., but investigations into each incident yielded little.
He wanted to stay awake, at least long enough to make it to eleven and gloat mercilessly, but he wasn’t sure he’d be able. No matter; he’d set an alarm for the exact end of this farce shortly after they’d solidified the bet.
Sherlock waved him off. “It’s no bother, I’ll be fine--”
After the message sent, he registered his mistake. His thumb hovered over the screen as he stood, unable to decide if he should correct or not.
His stomach turned at the thought of food, but who knew when he’d eat again?
Sherlock flicked on a nearby light switch. The power was still on, as evidenced by the mellow illumination overhead. John pinched his brow.
Inspiration was hard to come by on my own, so google helped me out a LOT for this chapter.
have an alibi for him on the sixth. Witnesses. That would clear him for Noualt and Sebastian Wilkes, but not Frederique and his victim. We’ve still got the dates and witnesses for that one.”
in pain, wrenched hard at the sockets, above his head. His still-sluggish pulse pounded deafening brass drums in his ears.
Whatever Jim might promise him, whatever draw might linger in his damned transport, he would resist Kushiel’s urge. He couldn’t go back to Jim, and he knew that as surely as he stood there.
to come as Robin Hood and Will Scarlett. He promised me. He doesn’t even care about this stupid holiday--why should it matter what he dressed up like, if it was only to humor me anyway?”
Weak, early-morning sunlight struggled to lay its claim to the little courtyard behind
Here we have John's side of that night.
Emile grinned and rose, embracing them each in a quick hug. “Two
The way she cupped herself had Sherlock pressing into the mattress again, finding a slow rhythm. Warmth curled in his belly, pooled hot and heavy in his groin. She slid the boxer briefs down just far enough to reveal a prosthesis strapped into place. A packer. Sodding hell, she had a packer and Sherlock prayed he’d get to play with it, with her. He wanted nothing more than to feel its smooth silicone, to watch the way her face would relax and contort as he stoked this fantasy.
Jim only hummed, then drew out a little satin eye-mask, padded to block the gaps on either side of the nose, affording true darkness. Then Sherlock saw no more.
Sherlock willed himself to smile, to pretend like it wasn’t a question he’d heard all his life. Usually right before something unpleasant happened. “I was born with it. As I was saying--”
John watched on as Sherlock stared her down, silent for nearly a full ten seconds.
There was something in those words that perked Sherlock’s ear and made Mrs. Hudson titter.
John merely tucked his hands behind his back, levelled a mild expression at Sherlock. His voice, however, didn’t match his calm exterior. It came out light and amused. “You went pulling a cat’s tail, Sherlock--you got exactly what you asked for. I might’ve stopped her before she mauled you.”
He dropped to one knee on the bed, trailing his fingertips along Wilkerson’s chest and stomach, feather-light caresses that typically left goosebumps in their wake. He dropped light kisses after that, absolutely certain he would win Wilkerson’s attention.
And this time, when Sherlock was free to roam Wilkerson’s body, he knew: it wasn’t the acts themselves, nor the sensations they produced that pleased him. They were a lovely windfall to the real kink at play: exacting, rigorous attention to detail. Wilkerson was a man who took pride in his impeccable accounting for the Treasury. That his life behind doors would be no less precise came now as no surprise.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Ms. Adler let go of his chin, her eyes sliding from his face to scan the room blindly as she considered his answer. “No, I’ll take you at your word, though I may have to phone Sister Roberts. But here you are at my doorstep. You’ve dedicated yourself at Naamah’s temple?”
Once he’d collected himself as well as his payment and the gift Helen had left with Mal, Sherlock sought out John. Another of the house staff pointed him toward Helen’s stables, which stood on the eastern side of the property.
Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to blot out the noise his brain was kicking up: if this were a case, his teeth would have already been sunk in deep, his mind worrying at this problem like a starved dog over a steak. But the bombing was not a case--not his case, at any rate--and he still had his own responsibilities to account for more immediately than playing a political riddle-game. He forced himself to depart their company for the kitchen, to make his tea and collect his thoughts for the day--and the assignation--ahead.
Sherlock did, and Victor barely waited for it to open wide enough before thrusting in, sinking to the hilt on his first go--and it was too much, too fast. Sherlock could take him deep, given just a little more time, but he hadn’t had the opportunity. He gagged reflexively, his body lurching even as he fought to make sure none of his teeth so much as grazed Victor’s length, but he didn’t have time to catch a breath before Victor took his own pleasure, setting a punishing pace that left Sherlock struggling for air, tears stinging until they streamed from his eyes. His fingertips dug into Victor’s hips, hanging on for the ride.
Sherlock scarcely contained his excitement as he held up the textbook, open to reveal a name scrawled on the inside cover. “What’s your connection to Lorraine Carver?”
John repeated the stanza, praying he would hear nothing else, but Moriarty even interrupted that.
Sherlock’s mouth was molten heat and John needed. John swallowed hard and realised Sherlock watched him: Sherlock studied his face and nibbled at the tendon standing out. Already a rosy flush rode Sherlock’s high cheekbones, eyes blown wide and dark.
“John,” he breathed. “John!”
“We can’t slow down,” Felippa huffed, trying to catch her breath. “If

clients,” and here she broke off as a titter circled the room, “but a celebration--my brother and I turn thirty-nine today!” She paused for the smattering of polite applause and went along. “With that in mind, I’d like to present my birthday present to my favorite sibling and business rival.” Laughter, now. Then a male voice, clearing his throat as he drew nearer.
“What’d you do to piss him off?”
“You know me too well. How could I pass him up?”
, said it was his present to Sherlock. He’d offered him a world where D’Angeline purity reigned.
Then Sherlock shifted, side-stepping to switch places. Sherlock’s chest pressed against his shoulders, stomach flat against his back as those long, slender fingers snaked across chest and hip to pin John in place. John was immediately thankful for the erratic, flashing club lights, for the fact that he’d thought to “dress” upward and wear a pair of forgiving trousers--it would do no good, he was sure, for Sherlock to
Helen broke for the far end of the train car’s door and scrabbled to pry it open, undoubtedly counting on Cassiline discipline to stay his hand.
The godawful weakness of his flesh manifested low in him, an insidious snake curled in the cradle of his pelvic bone, ready to strike. John struggled to tune it out.
Sherlock was led back to his room, stripped and given a simple sponge, towel, and bucket to clean himself with. Fresh scrubs were laid out on his bed, and the guard looked as nonplussed as Luca looked apologetic.
wanted here, and if I were you? I’d get out of this building while you can.”
Which was for the best, really. Sherlock hadn’t so much as touched his mobile since they’d entered the suite, so it was incredibly unlikely he would be so forthcoming with Lestrade.
“Tonight? That’s what I was trained for. That’s the easy part, compared to--” But John cut himself off, his expression shuttered once more.
Fifteen minutes in the air, and Sherlock was ready to crawl the walls of the small aircraft ferrying John, the two missing servants of Naamah, and himself back home. After all the madness, they would have to stay still, to think and plan. That much quiet after escaping an island of guards, surviving a car chase was just unthinkable. Adrenaline careened through his veins, left him skittery and irritable.

The set of John’s face each time Sherlock had purposefully goaded him; the way his eyes widened, unguarded and vulnerable, the night Sherlock caught him listening to the violin.

Needless to say, his mission was proving more successful by the minute, until Sherlock opened his mouth to snap,
John opened his mouth to say something more about it, but the acolyte cut him off.
Satisfied, Jim stepped forward again, his body heat its own caress against Sherlock’s near-bare skin. Teeth on Sherlock’s ear left Sherlock gasping.
“But what does it mean?” Sherlock’s mother’s voice had risen, despite the sort of calm she typically exuded before strangers. Frustration tinged her words.
"They should warn every tattoo artist about anguissets, I think," he said with a laugh, clapping Sherlock on the shoulder. "You squirm like a bloody squid."
If the fire burned a little brighter after that, John wasn’t one to complain. By the time he remembered the disposable camera he’d stuffed into his knapsack, they were well and truly drunk.
Sherlock stood, pulling John to his feet. “I propose, for now, we… get acquainted. I would very much like to relax with you. It’s late, and I know we’re both exhausted. Do you feel comfortable coming to lie down in my bed?”
“Since you’re so polite about it...” John withdraws in one ruthless pull, leaving Sherlock empty and gasping before leaning on his good knee, jerking open the nightstand drawer with one swift tug.
Sherlock didn’t know what to make of a question like that, and he let his confusion show.
And still, he could imagine a future: days of intrigue and long nights filled with the lash, the paddle, skin and sweat. Jim could consume him body and soul and Sherlock would thank him for it.
“Jim,” he murmured.
. He is afraid and he is alone. I don’t care one way or the other about the allegations he’s facing. I only know that what he’s done, it’s been with love of one kind or another. If you have even a
but in the next moment Sherlock saw her posture shift. Determination shone in her eyes.
“Here, like this.” Wilkerson rose from the bed, guided Sherlock to sit with his back against the wide, heavy headboard. He slid open a nightstand drawer and produced silk handkerchiefs, dainty little flowered things in pastel colours. With them he tied each of Sherlock’s wrists to the headboard posts.
Sherlock swallowed, unaccountably nervous. He’d never actually performed the languisement on a woman before, though he knew well enough how to in theory--his training had covered the art of it, though Sherlock understood well the difference between words on a page and a body in action. If he embarrassed himself with this, he embarrassed Irene’s competency as his mentor.
Okay, okay,
“What’s that?” John asks, and his tone is light, teasing, even as Sherlock’s frustration pitches the poor lanky man’s voice up. “Speak up, love.”
The joviality fled Emile’s demeanor entirely. He regarded John with something new, a respect, or perhaps concern, he had yet revealed. He nodded sombrely. “I will do my best, Cassiline.” This time when Emile offered a Cassiline bow, it was no longer the flippant, sloppy gesture it had been when they met--this bow was crisp, exact.
An officer cuffed Smith and hauled him to his feet. After his rights were read the officer began walking him toward a police car.

“Mixing business and pleasure, I’m afraid,” the guest replied, a male voice, light and lilting.
Sally climbed back onto the bed and gestured he follow with the crook of a finger. The way her knees splayed and bobbed, her expression expectant and now surprisingly playful, she put him in mind of a mischievous young man, barely legal. And this--Sherlock had done this. Sherlock had yielded the space and the permission to be in charge, and she’d flourished with it.
had been another thing Sherlock had heard most of his childhood, despite only being a fraction D’Angeline, an eighth on his mother’s side.
From the corner of his clouded vision Sherlock watches as John retrieves the bottle of slick, and a tangle of black straps wrapped hastily around something large and purple.
“He’s waiting their decision. Your--friend--he’s troubled. I think you’d do well to pray for him, too.”
“Try it again.” John’s voice came out level, unruffled in the slightest.
“Obviously. But I have no idea
Dianne leaned back, and Sherlock could feel the weight of her eyes coasting over his skin. “Tell me, what will you take as your patron-gift? I have paid generously for this assignation, but I wouldn’t dare ignore Naamah’s traditions.” She trailed a silver-lacquered nail down the length of his upper arm. “Name it. It’s impressive you’ve lasted the entire night as our plaything!”
John was so keyed up that a distant part of his mind wondered how he would ever manage anything more than a simple kiss, but then he tasted honey and he found he didn’t care.
will escort your little crush to probably the most important social event he’s yet attended, and then when we get home, I will do things to him you will absolutely despise. Oh, he’ll love them, though. I’ll honour his safeword and everything. I won’t have it said I’m a rapist, after all.
Just like that Sherlock found himself wading once more into the bewildering quagmire that surrounded John Watson. The most obvious thoughts were the simple things that came first: John snorting as Sherlock shot off some of his deductions, or the comfortable silence they could travel in. That was the John he’d come to know in the months after the Chamberlain case. Quick-witted without any need to draw attention to himself or dominate a conversation. Steady.

“You are dismissed, John Hamish Watson, on this day, the seventeenth of February, the two-thousand and tenth year of Elua.

“His orders?”
of training and certification, the flechette wasn’t made for damage so much as it was pain for the sake of pain. It was vital that a servant of Naamah carry as few scars as possible, and for some the fear of the deadly blades was too much--they wrote it completely from their assignation contracts.
“About where your boundaries are,” Sherlock answered as if this wasn’t a tectonic shift in John’s entire world. “What we each want, at least for here and now.”
Kushiel’s temple was an old stone building, the main doors carved from heavy wood, a symbol of interlocking keys wrought in bronze fixed on the outside. Those symbolised the keys to Hell, which Kushiel had, at one time, kept for Adonai.

“You ask too much.” With that he dropped his eyes, bowing his head, the glimpse of her displeasure speeding his heart just a tic faster.
“Half a kilometer!”
His mother turned wide-eyed to him, ready to correct his rudeness, but sighed and nodded.
Sherlock let his voice rumble, no words needed, as he stepped back and knelt on the bare earth, heedless of his trousers, and lowered himself down. Thorns pricked his skin as he stretched out on his back, each a tiny pinpoint of light, a bright spot that danced behind his eyelids. John knelt between his splayed knees, mindful of the roses, and gently untied Sherlock’s shoes. John slid them off, and Sherlock’s socks. He gave each foot a massaging squeeze, a sweep of the thumb across the arches before he came back up to  undo Sherlock’s trousers.
Sherlock’s contract included him spending the night, and he woke the next morning still in Victor’s overlarge bed, buttery morning light pooling across the duvet tangled between his legs. Then he realised he was alone.
Sherlock pushed up to his feet, but left his gaze downcast. The soft chuckle Jim let out sounded like a threat and adoration in one.

And when Lestrade slipped in three, Sherlock let loose a cry so loud and strained he suddenly understood the ridiculous keening porn stars indulged in--his body couldn’t help but produce that ridiculous noise, and distantly, he tried to care.
John thought.
On the other hand, Sherlock reasoned, if he were to take the case--it was infinitely more likely he would only prove Jim’s innocence, and wouldn’t

It hadn’t been until Sherlock’s “death” that the dam broke, and John realised what a huge mistake he’d made, wasting time on denial. But then there was Mary, whom he’d clung to as a pillar. When he finally admitted to himself that he loved her, it felt like a bittersweet betrayal, but one he could only carry so far. Sherlock was dead and gone, had been for eighteen months.
Emile straightened and tapped his finger to the side of his nose. “Just a piece on loan from Mandrake House. Your ward’s patron signed all the appropriate forms for it, I promise you.”
Brother Rocaille grinned then, his glare still fixed on John. “Top of your class, questionably close friendship with the head of the London Brotherhood, and assigned, most unconventionally, to a servant of the

Before he knew it, fifteen, thirty minutes had passed and he had drained the mug. He drew in a deep breath, resolved to send another email to Brother Vincent before nightfall. He drained the remainder of the teapot into his mug, tried to savour the bitter taste as it hit the back of his mouth.

One would assume it to be a bit of loose wool from one of the sheep, but it’s the wrong makeup entirely and you don’t smell like a sheep, so it can’t be that. It’s from the seed head from a bulrush blossom; seeing as it’s late springtime now, and this particular bit is rather brown, it must be from last season, caught upon some of the thick vegetation around the pond you’ve almost certainly come to tell me about.”
Emile answered as he placed the package on Sherlock’s lap. “Came in to work this afternoon. It had your name, this address, but no sender. I wasn’t sure what else to do but bring it.”
his downcast gaze, his bent knee, his begging. He could easily imagine Jim earning
The sole of his boot struck the man’s sternum and he retracted, finding centre as the thug flew backward. In his periphery John could hear the last goon, the drug-addict, fleeing. Trainers slapped cement, carrying the coward far away. Already John’s eye began to swell, but all pain was absent in the moment.
“Say no more, Mrs. Hudson. I’ll be there as soon as possible. Is anyone hurt?”
“What’s your connection to Lorraine Carver?”
“You’re curious, aren’t you?” Sherlock’s tone slid into something sultry and coy.  “You are. What could be so good your boss would be willing to risk his
-- Listen, I know Sheriarty isn't everyone's cup of tea. If it doesn't suit you, that's okay, but don't flood my comments with it? Please remember, this story's here to give everyone a little bit of what they want, and that Johnlock is still endgame. I feel like I say this every chapter, but I swear it's true. I also know there are a handful of you Sheriartys out there, and I'm honestly excited to see what you think of this. I don't get to read that ship too often (
The fight went out of her then, and all she could do was cry, plead.
John nodded quickly, meeting his eye. “Moriarty’s just been discovered missing from his cell.”
The jangle of twangy country music spilled from a jukebox and the rich stink of fried food and stale cigarette smoke hit him as soon as he entered; a sign posted at the register directly in front of him directed smoking patrons to the left, non-smokers to the right.* Harsh, yellowy light did nothing flattering for the stainless steel countertops, the walls yellowed with age, the dull brown squares of terra-cotta tile on the floor. He wrinkled his nose, shook his head, and turned to find Sherlock.
She only smiled that way when she hedged around a truth she didn’t want to tell. “I know it’s a sore subject, and it’s been a while since it’s come up--”
Sherlock, who stood further into the penthouse and behind Jim, cut him a bewildering, accusatory glare that read,
the real question, isn’t it? So many of us from the Houses know each other, have history--it’s not like the isolation you contend with, Sherlock. Even between Houses, we’re encouraged to mingle, to build our network as wide and solid as we can.”
1.) Hey look, y'all! We have a chapter count! Well, I'm pretty sure that's the final chapter count. But hey!
Sherlock could almost guess the way that sentence was supposed to end:
melody of the song snared John, entranced him. It was an absolute pleasure to watch the man before him, lost in the music in a way John had never seen him before.
"Just fine." John's words were clipped short, bitten off before he had a chance to say anything more scathing.
joking, though…
John sees him as soon as he enters the kitchen, and his face falls into a weird mask of conflicting annoyance and attraction.
John’s heart slammed in his chest.
Sherlock did as told, fumbling at first with the button of Lestrade’s pants, each tooth of the zipper like a tumbler in a picked lock. Momentary success achieved, Sherlock leaned forward. The scent of Lestrade through his thin black boxer-briefs left Sherlock punch-drunk. He had no right to smell that good.
Sherlock tried his best to make himself comfortable on the plush little loveseat in the parlour, all too aware of its creamy damask upholstery, of the rich mahogany furnishings and sophisticated decor.
Sherlock looked down at his mug--he’d abandoned soda and requested coffee instead. Steam swirled up lazily. Across the diner the clatter of plates jarred the stillness, such as it was. A lone early-bird wandered in and Connie scuttled over to greet him.
The path through the hospital--for indeed, as John explained in a whisper as they navigated crumbling hallways, they were in the hospital rather than the asylum as Sherlock had assumed--was nerve-wracking in its own way. As they ventured further into the building’s  darkened bowels, every footfall, every rustle of fabric and creak of wood as they pushed past some part of a fallen staircase or rotting furniture was a deafening boom as they strained their ears for the sounds of the six remaining guards.

had been made. They planned to elope when the Dowayne denied her. Luckily, the night they were to leave, he contracted her there in Mandrake house. They’d planned it this way, so they might leave in the dead of night with very few questions. But then during play-time, while she whipped him senseless, he pleaded for her to pray to Eisheth--and then she knew how close she’d come to ruin. She turned him and his fortune away, no matter how he implored.”
Irene's expression sobered, and she studied Sherlock thoughtfully. "Don't say yes just because I've made a joke."
John is more broken these days than before Sherlock had found him after the military. So while he understands exactly where they are going, exactly what they are about to do, he aches for the memory of that much youth, that night of laughing and feeling more alive than he ever had before. That yearning twists his heart tight with guilt. This little trip won’t make John forget Mary. Nor the child he’d lost when she died.
When he woke again, it was to cold tile, the punishing buzz of fluorescent lights and the distant roar of the ocean, the stink of bleach and seawater. Every muscle quivered, ached. His skin burned, scabs stretching and pulling open  as he struggled to push himself from the floor, whose cold seeped straight into his bones.
, marked by Kushiel and servant to Naamah. Phèdre, led by her patron-gods, served her queen by uncovering these terrible plots. And just once the poem mentioned a word left untranslated:
Sherlock scoffed. “Good luck with that.”
“I’ll let you, don’t worry,” she snapped, every ounce of authority reserved in her smooth tone. She pointed at her nightstand drawer. “Condom first.”
“Very much.” John’s eyes closed, relishing the sensation. “Please.”
The next message came in.
and let his mind replay the evening, honing in on every detail he could muster. If he could do this thing--if he could prove his genius to Jim, and then impress him in the bedroom, there was absolutely no reason why it wouldn’t lead to more--
dinner. He watched the host and his guest, and played tirelessly through soup, entree, and salad.
John thought for a moment. “You were picked by Kushiel--but is that why you serve Naamah rather than become one of his priests?”
When Sherlock lifted his eyes from the card, Irene burst out laughing.
gets logged on the account.”
“I believe one of them may be a murderer.”
John cleared his throat, forced himself to lift his gaze, to submit to inspection. “She spoke with me.”
“These belonged to the last Cassiline to be paired with an anguissette, my ancestor on my father’s side.”
“I--”
came a traitorous voice in Sherlock’s head.
“Yes, John,” he managed.
Sister Roberts laughed then, and Sherlock wondered why someone with her dry humour might ever be a priestess to Kushiel, who’d always struck him as a dour disciplinarian. There were stranger things, though.
“Ah, yes. Unfortunate. But I still have you, which is more than consolation.”
If it is possible, Sally’s bedside manner is
Sherlock was twenty-five when he saw, finally, the power he wielded in yielding, in embracing Kushiel’s Dart and Naamah’s gifts.
that John had chosen Sherlock over his life’s work. Sherlock would see a broken, failed warrior limping back like a wounded puppy, desperate for a gentle voice and a warm hand. All for a desperate kiss on an abandoned island during the middle of a firefight.
Again, John found himself trailing in the wake of an elder, unsure of what lay ahead.
“You expected--?”
“I swear it.”
As much as I've tried to tie up loose ends, I am aware that it's been long enough that referencing events posted what, like, a year and a fafillion chapters ago may need better context built here to really do that justice. Let me know if that's the case, and where, so's I can fix it.
“Sherlock, the iceberg over there is Victor Trevor. This is his sister, Cara, and her husband, Mike Stamford.”
As Sherlock and an ever-reticent John stepped from their car, the morning that greeted them was bright and mild, promising to warm up as the day progressed. Ahead, the house sat tucked between hills whose grass had just hit the first vibrant rush of spring. Gleaming white fences closed in the extensive pastures, skirting the hills and dividing the meadows as far as Sherlock could see.
“Tonight: was it me, or the dancing that did it?” Sherlock’s voice rumbled quietly against John’s skin, down his spine and straight to his cock.
John stepped back. “Fine. I’ll give you fifteen minutes to text me. Past that, I will come in, throw you over my shoulder, and drag you out bodily.”
to be friends, in the beginning. Or else, circumstances beyond his control--the mote in his eye and pressure from their peers, the intimidation tactics his brother saw fit to employ--ran off the ones that might have stayed. That had been the case with John, hadn’t it?
There had been those times, late at night--
“I really can’t stand that woman. It was a delight to pull her down a peg.” Jim stepped forward, crowded him against the doorframe until that spicy scent filled Sherlock’s head again, muddled his senses. “Daddy is quite happy with you right now, Sherlock. Oh, Daddy will reward you just as soon as he can.”
John huffs, trying to find the sharp edge of his anger again, the indignation he’d felt earlier. The punch has worn that down to a blunt thing. “We
Sherlock thought he would burst from it.
“You may be able to work a great deal of this out in time with your own logic,” she said. When she met his eyes, her smile was soft, but her gaze was sharp. “We cognitive types are excellent at that, when we know how to do it in a healthy way. But your body… you more than most--”
Sherlock tried to find movement in the crowd, a sign of Mike moving toward the stage, but the only thing he could see from beneath the glare of the lights was the figure from the back, the stranger in grey, moving silently across the room toward them. As he drew closer, he fell into the odd region where Sherlock could no longer see him, so Sherlock cast his eyes about as if this were any other stage performance, for surely Irene had trained him in that as well.
Lestrade interjected with, “But I thought your lot got tattoos when you finished your time?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is it?” Sherlock snapped. Then, remembering their ruse, he softened his features, affected a dopey sort of concerned expression. “You know how much I love people-watching.”
“Irene--
Sherlock snarled, jerking his head toward a nearby office.
Sherlock rose quickly to answer his, upsetting the box from where it still halfway sat on his knee and knocking it into the floor. The heavy diamond clattered on the hardwood and rolled a few feet away.
Sherlock let loose a whimper whose edges were tinged with panic--he had a love/hate relationship with gags. The way they excited a patron were lovely, but there was something about the way this one act of restraint kept his words in check spooked him--not that he’d ever admit that or cow to it, of course.
. John bit his lip and squeezed his eyes shut. His traitorous abdomen tightened all the same.
“The way your voice sounds when you take charge--I won’t be able to think of anything else the next time we’re on a case together.”
The buzz arced over his skin, enveloping him. The sky hung above, its mercurial nature a blessing and a curse. Beneath him, the ground was ever-constant. After all else, a drop of Anael’s ichor still flowed in his veins.
the deduction.”
to tell him to leave John be. He wouldn’t be ordered by some--
“Certainly not. I’ll not diminish his debut-price.”
John ignored it momentarily, enough to wrestle her onto her stomach, pin her arms to her sides with his knees. With one hand he slid his gun free, pressed it to her spine, and with the other he snatched up the phone.
John’s brain scrambled to think how he should progress. If he got up to retrieve the bomb from the train or make a hasty retreat, she’d be up again, free to do what she wanted.
"I wasn't always sure of that," he admitted, and prayed Sherlock would understand.
FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO BE FOREWARNED:
The plug pressed in a bit further, a matter of millimetres. At each increment, Sherlock was sure there would be pain, but no: it was neither pain nor pleasure, just an odd sensation and sense of fullness his brain didn’t know how to quantify. His every cognisant thought narrowed down to that unforgiving steel implement, sliding smoothly and minutely into his body.
“Please.” The word escapes him, voiceless.
John’s voice was right in his ear, a rough whisper. “What do you need?”
Rather than heed his advice, the ringleader threw himself forward with a grunt, and John went into action.

“That was perfect,” Moriarty purred. “You performed beautifully--the violin
, you could say, that keep our little way of life preserved. Mary here is one such agent. She’s as good as giving as she is receiving.” Moriarty winked, and John wasn’t sure how to take that.
That whipped John’s head his direction so fast Sherlock was certain he heard John’s neck pop. “I what?”
The sweet tug of Naamah’s grace ratcheted sharp until it spiked through his chest, a shot of adrenaline and a more barbed need. Sherlock
Lorenzo entered first and stumbled on an overturned chair. The noise as it knocked against the matching desk was enough for Sherlock to catch his breath, head swimming and eyes squeezed shut against the inevitable volley of gunfire; surely the guards heard.
“No need,” John replied. “I’ll figure something out for us, later, if you’re hungry now. Don’t wait around for us.”
# # # # #
Sherlock turned to John, who had followed in silence, having given up his line of questioning in the car.
Inside the little box, rather than a gold band or some other meaningless piece of jewelry, was a fat acorn, roughly the size of Sherlock’s thumb.
Dianne squeezed his bicep again, something like sympathy in her eyes now. “I can see what he means to you--it is a hard thing, bound as you are between so many gods.”
Watson?”
He tried his best to get exactly what he wanted, since she would not freely give him a future with her at his side. He took far, far more in return. He violated Naamah’s blessing, and then he’d stolen the coin of her beauty. He’d carved it from her as ruthlessly as he wished.
“You are one of us, now.” Cecily’s voice was still bell-clear, though her posture was the broken mirror of her proud Camellian training. Now her straight spine and squared shoulders screamed of the desperate stiffness of someone who’d never start moving again once they collapsed. A good stiff wind, and that would be the end of her. “But Luca tells us
Sherlock stood poised outside John’s locked door, knuckles hovering inches away from knocking. John’s voice murmured inside, and Sherlock leaned closer, pressed his ear to the wood.
2.) DOES ANYONE UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE JOHN WATSON HAVE FRAGILE EMOTIONS?? Eugh. If I overdid it and he's OOC, just tap me on the back of the head. It was haaaaard, lol.
Unsatisfied with Sherlock’s position, Victor smacked his arse viciously, the ringing blows of which echoed in the stillness of the study, accompanied only by Sherlock’s responding moans, until Sherlock had worked his way forward, hips flush with the edge of the desk even as his face still pressed to its surface.
Which really only meant,
“There are forces at work, entire
name notably lacking from that list.
4.) John *is* posted outside the room, and is probably incredibly not happy with it. I did this as much for story logistics as angst-factor for when the two of them get together. But I'll throw the issue of his consent into the mix because when he insisted on being posted just outside he may not have realised what he'd be subjected to overhearing, and there was probably a great deal of discomfort on his part for it. And I'm counting that as a consent issue--"he could've walked away" was not an option, because he is
“All good things, I swear.”
With that Sherlock dropped his eyes to his plate, a cooling pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It was simple and hearty, and likely what the priests and priestesses were having for the day. When he took his first bite, flavour exploded across his tastebuds, a greedy enthusiasm for sustenance after what he’d been through.
