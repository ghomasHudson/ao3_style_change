He had to give John what he wanted. He had studied up on asexuality, knew that some aces (as they called themselves) would partake in sexual activities for the sake of their their partners, some might even quite enjoy sex itself and just didn’t experience the attraction towards others, but he also knew that others were completely repulsed by the thought of sex. He knew he didn’t go quite that far, but he also knew that he’d rather avoid it entirely, if at all possible.
“I suppose surgery would be out of the question too, what with your hand tremor. Surprised they hired you at all with your limp, even if it is psychosomatic, due to the rapid pace of hospitals. But then, I suppose it’s not truly an issue if it’s only psychosomatic. You should really fire your therapist, by the way. Which reminds me. Afghanistan or Iraq?”
,” he murmured with a small tease, earning a smile from Jim which had been his plan all along. He hadn’t meant to turn Jim morose, and he wanted to fix that. “But probably,” he said eventually. “Dad wasn’t the most accepting of things, and mum didn’t help much in standing up for us. I have to thank them, though.”
With that he rolls over.  He might as well have slammed the door in my face.  Not that he has not done so many times over the years, with little effect I must say, for I always open it and walk through anyway.  Well, except for the time he hit me in the nose and he apologised profusely for days and days saying he didn’t mean it and he was sorry because he would never in a million years want to hurt me and would I please please forgive him.  Yes John, always.
“Anything else, John?  Surely these are mere coincidences.”  My brother’s voice echoes in my ears, ‘The universe is rarely so lazy.’
Aaargh!  It's been such a long time since I last posted.  I am so sorry for the delay, life has been busy.  The highlight being a 2500 mile road trip that found me at two, yes TWO, Paul McCartney concerts (squee!!) and the Cirque du Soliel Beatles LOVE show in Las Vegas.
I hope he sees in my face that I, too, have everything I need.  Everything I have ever needed but did not know it.
“On second thought, no need," Sherlock said. "I’ll fetch my violin; all I came for. Back in a flash.”
As angry as John felt, he knew Sherlock was not at fault for any of this.  As his friend once so bluntly pointed out, John
“Tis not your fault, fool!” Cedric scolded Aldus, explaining to John, “Eduard needed to relieve himself. But when he did not come back I went looking for him. He was, he was lying in a pool of his own blood and I knew he was dead. Twas nothing I could do.” Quickly averting his eyes, he looked as if he, too, might cry.
Pressure builds in me, filling every part of my body; I breathe deeper, harder.   My heart beating so fast I wonder if my blood will break through my veins and wash through me.
“I am thinking I have things to do.”   I wiped my hands on my apron, and, untying it and laying it neatly on the bed, I walked out of the bedroom.
“Ahhh.”  John smiled back.  “Come here.”  He waved his hand, and Sherlock crawled up, flopping onto his stomach and laying his head next to John’s.
Didn’t remember going mad in the middle of traffic. Didn’t remember going to hospital (or leaving, for that matter). Didn’t even remember how he came to have a cab; the gaffer told’m his cabbie’s license was suspended until further notice.
, is it Sherlock?  What the hell are you doing playing with my cock?”  He opened his eyes and stared at the face inches away from his, the clear gaze looking at him in puzzlement.
What?  Just now?  What took so long?  He should have arrived nearly 24 hours ago.  But with further scrutiny I see that the text was sent at 7:45…yesterday morning.  And there are no others. Why is there only one?   Did he not wonder why I did not answer?  And why does he not tell me more?
“Breathe, Sherlock.  Come on, love.”  He touches my face, soothing me.  I open my eyes to see him showing me how to breathe, his mouth a big ‘O’ as he draws air in and blows it back out… breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out.  I stare at him, mimicking his actions; oxygen flows to my brain.
was somehow granted not only the privilege of spending the rest of my life with him, but the privilege to love him, and have him love me.  Forsaking all others.
“Why do you think you were having the nightmare now?  It’s been over 20 years since that happened.  What do you think caused it tonight?”
He is still smiling.  I am glad I have meant so much to him that nothing will make him so happy as to leave me.
Folding Sherlock’s note and putting it into a matching envelope, Simon dabbed its adhesive with saliva and sealed it shut. And as he pulled the laptop closed, his eye caught a movement; Sherlock was emerging from his singularly odd meditation, decoupling his steepled hands and relaxing into the chair as he crossed one leg over the other. And when he started speaking, Dr. Watson jolted awake, his face clearly broadcasting that nothing was more important than Sherlock and what he had to say.
John laid waiting, nothing happening, wondering what Sherlock would do next.  And though there was nothing in particular that came to mind, it was still unexpected.  And unexpectedly pleasurable.
Sherlock sobered.  “It never made sense to me that Moriarty was the mastermind of his own organization.  Yes, he was cunning and obviously devoid of any moral character, but I don’t see him having the necessary skills to amass that kind of criminal network on his own.  I would not be surprised if he got in the bad graces of his handler, who ordered a hit on him.
He stands there for several moments, his lips parted, a puzzled expression still on his face.  Have I broken him?
If anyone ever had the curiosity to know how often Sherlock Holmes slept, and why anyone want to know that piece of trivia, who knows, but if they did, the answer would be ‘rarely’.
John flinched at the flash of anger that swept across Sherlock’s face, at the way he drew himself up.  But John stood fast.   “I have lived with Cedric these two years, and never would I have guessed at the dark depths within him.  There be no way thou could know.”
It explained why he faked his own death and ruthlessly tracked and eliminated Moriarty’s men.  It explained why, on the happiest day of John’s life, Sherlock left the wedding reception early.  It explained why he had not seen Mary as a threat; Sherlock’s desire to see John happy suppressed what he knew to be true about her.
) didn’t always use it as a means to gain great wealth; they used for other, far more creative endeavors, for entertainment. And that made life interesting. Made it a challenge. But Sherlock was boring, just like the rest of them.
John’s brow creases.  “But we all die, Sherlock.  We are born, we live our lives, and then we die.  That’s how it works.  But, tea?  Why tea?  I drive a car, that’s statistically a lot more dangerous than drinking tea.  I breathe the bloody fumes that sit in the house whilst you do your experiments; hell, that has to be a
To those of you reading In My Life~ not to worry, I'll be right back on it.  I needed some fluff after the last chapter I posted!
“That goes without saying. Anything else?” Mr. Holmes’s question didn’t sound to be a sincere inquiry to negotiate further.
Walking into the sitting room, the TV is turned on low to one of those insidious shopping channels.  For some reason John John has been fascinated by the hostess, a slim, animated woman with long blonde hair and blood red nails, and a way of ending everything she says as a question.  I don’t see the appeal.
He looks around in confusion as if unable to tell where the sound of my voice comes from. (Over here, John.)  When he finally faces me, he looks as stunned as the day I told him my regret of not having kissed him.  I am pleased.  This will be easier than I thought. I imagined he might put up a small fuss, but if he is as willing to please me in this as he was to kiss me, it shall be an easy transition indeed.  I get up to start packing his things.  Most everything is mine so it will not be much trouble.
In a tone stripped of all friendliness, Sherlock said, “It’s none of your business, and it’s time for you to leave. You can tell my
Mycroft, trying to read his brother’s awareness, or lack thereof, of the situation, asked, “You don’t remember?”
John sits beside me on the bed, his brows creasing.  “Ok.  Now this is a new one.  I’ve never made anyone laugh before.  What is so goddamn funny?”
Silent except for the noise in my head as I struggle to name a feeling it is difficult for me to identify.  It is doubt.  So used to being the smartest person in the room, the person to whom others look for direction, this time it is different.  This time it is John who has the knowledge, the experience; the one who will lead
He hastened his stride, the backpack in which he’d stored the laptop and gun bouncing against his shoulder blades, and he grumbled at how long it was taking Andi to respond.
not right.” Nika rooted through a drawer for an antacid, half hoping she’d stumble upon something stronger.
“Not now, Sherlock…here it is.” ‘It’ is my mobile, not my penis; this development is even sadder than the dead pirate.
John typed, his sentences lurching forward as Sherlock waited to learn something he hadn’t already known.
sniper bested him!  This sniper beat him at his own game; he couldn’t even commit suicide without this person getting in a shot first.  A rogue sniper, or perhaps the hired hand of someone who wanted Moriarty eliminated.  You knew Moriarty as well as I did.  He made it his business to ‘rattle the bars’ as it were, the ultimate unwanted guest, insinuating himself wherever he pleased.”
John heard his name.  His name said in that same obscenely rich tone he heard every day at home.  The voice of Sherlock.  He heard it again, this time, breathed softly into his ear.  John’s eyes flew open and he froze.  Not with fear, but with wonder.  For right next to his own face was the
“What I was saying was, I don’t know what to do next, but if you think it’s something to laugh about…”
Looking up from where he was stoking the fire, impishly Todd said, “No babe, not letting you go.  Don’t worry, we’ll get you to work soon enough.”
“Yes, John.  Yes, tis all right.”  Sherlock hoped that John saw in his eyes what he could not say in words.  That he thought he, too, had fallen in love.  The light-headedness lingered, making Sherlock wonder if there were more to his injuries than the ones on his back.
Waving away Sir John's question, Sherlock covered himself with a blanket and stood, grimacing as his feet hit the ground. "We must be on our way. I haven't all day."
The ambulance ride took three seconds.  It took three hours.  It screamed by and it played out in the slowest, slow motion John could imagine.   Every moment was amplified by the paralyzing fear Sherlock would die.
“They say I lie.  They say they have never heard of a reward, but I believe they wait for my value to rise.  When my father dies and it is time for me to take his place, I will be worth an even larger ransom, one large enough to sustain their family for many generations to come.  This is only one of many ways in which they wear their ignorance on their lice-infested sleeves.  They could have been rich all these years, yet they gamble it away on the possibility there will be more.  Whilst they toil in the fields.   Fools.”
“They are lovely, and they smell…” he leans toward the bouquet and inhales, “heavenly, but ‘no’.  It’s only been a few hours, love, give it time.”
“I really have no time for this. Can’t you see I’m ill?” This no longer seemed strictly true, but it was none of Stam— the ghost’s concern. Sherlock flapped a hand in the direction of the door. “If you would be so kind as to show yourself out. Run along.”
Looking up at the magnificent creature beside him, John found he had trouble breathing. His heart pounding in his chest, he whispered, “Yes, ‘oh’.” John licked his lips, suddenly parched. “I- I am so…you are so…”
Resolutely unhooking the padlock from the clasp, Sherlock opened the cabinet doors wide. What he saw inside immediately caused him to forget his inner struggle.  Hearing the sharp intake of breath from the man standing beside him, Sherlock looked at John, instantly regretting his decision to bring the doctor along.  To be the reason John now felt the full force of his wife’s betrayal.
Trying not to be distracted by the expanse of naked skin, John attempted to glare at him.  But he found it was hard to be angry when he was faced with the very generous cock practically staring him in the face.
, is a one he takes pride in.  One with which he is comfortable, eager almost, to talk about.  His eyes are bright and amiable, his hands loosely folded in front of him.
A smile that did not reach John’s eyes tipped up the edges of his lips. “I wish you luck finding a blacksmith who has the time; they will be very busy, the tournament be days away.”
Following after him into the bedroom, I wrap my dressing gown tighter around me, hugging myself.  Protecting myself against the cool night.  Against my unease.
“It appears as if I have no choice. If it’s Mycroft…” Letting his threat hang in the air, Sherlock released his hand from John’s and strode quickly to the door. Throwing it open, he ignored the dog that still stood there, aiming his vitriol at the being that had the ability to—but made the choice not to—think rationally.
She’d barely made it out of the meeting; who would have thought that so many grown men and women could make such a fuss over an ordinary creature, cooing over Rose and patting her thick fur as she passed by. But thankfully, Dr. Juma had helped clear the way, leading Andi and Rose to her office. Rose was now secured in Dr. Juma’s private loo, a place where Simon wouldn’t have access to any privileged, or even ordinary, information.
“Why, John?”  Sherlock asked the question without indictment, for after all he knew John well.  Knew John would not hurt anyone without good cause.  It tugged at him to see that the man he looked at appeared to have aged several years in just the few days since he had last seen him.  What end could John have hoped to achieve which would be worth the toll it had so obviously taken on him?
I cannot think of anything.  All I have been doing is sleeping and I can safely say this act has no wonderment-making capabilities.
Walking straight to the front door, on my way snatching the keys off the counter and my outer garments off the coat rack, I tried not to slam it too loudly behind me as I left the cottage.
“Just in case Mark comes back and tries to do something he’ll regret.  You wounded his pride, you know.”
“Because all the blood that is supposed to give me an erection travels to my heart instead.  And then it is as if, because I love you so much, my heart has difficulty fitting in my chest.”
“These be my parents, my mother’s engagement ring and the one my father wore after they married.  Twas one reason I came to thee so late tonight; she said she wants me to have them.  For when I find the person I cannot live without.”
He is unaware I am awake; I play, well...’dead’, with stunning believability.  Or with more accuracy, in this case I pretend I am asleep.
Except…Ella had proved herself to be a far worthier opponent than Sherlock had thought she’d be. Perhaps it wasn’t a platitude but a clue?
Colin sprang up to fetch a cloth, bringing it back to dry her wet face. “I am so sorry.  You did not deserve to be treated in such a way.”
But he does not look fine. He will no longer look at me and his eyes are collecting moisture and he shuffles his hand across his nose as he sniffles. Perhaps he has developed allergies; while not common, allergies have been known to develop later in life.
Reaching the edge of the circle just as Mycroft did, she saw Sherlock stop struggling when he saw his brother, gathering himself into what he seemed to think was a dignified stance. But he couldn’t pull himself up straight, and his eyes were red and unfocused. Something was wrong.
Mrs. Hudson peered up through her glasses, looking through him. He’d known her long enough to know when she didn’t believe he was telling the truth, at least not all of it. And she was usually right.
There was nothing more Sherlock wished than that would not to be so; the less John was around Mary the safer he would be.  But there was no way around it.  As much as Sherlock hated to admit it, she was needed right now.
As I watch him, I know I never want to go through again what I went through today.  Whilst we are rarely apart from each other, when we are, I am able to cope, knowing I will see him again soon.   But today…  Today when I thought I might lose him forever, a darkness came over me that I resolve never again to experience.
If he were Sherlock Bloody Holmes he would be able to tell by how he held his head, the slope of his shoulders, the freaking length of his dressing gown, for god’s sake.   But not John.  With his ordinary mind he had to settle for facial expressions and words, neither of which was available to him.
But John was still remarkably sensitive when it came to the topic of Sherlock’s life and the possible absence of it (after the Fall, who could blame him?) and thus often took statements personal which Sherlock intended to be objective.
He stops the train of though right there. Why deflate the nice atmosphere with weirdly insecure thoughts about his sexuality?
“Don’t play daft on me now, Sherlock” Lestrade, not very keen on having a domestic taken place over his worktable, urged, gently but persistently, for them to maybe take this home to discuss. Sherlock dismissed him with another one of those damn condescending waves.
Sherlock lost his serious expression for a split second to give John a little grin. “Everything’s fine. More than fine, actually” he circled his doctor’s waist with his arms, pulling them flush together. John pushed against his chest, gently.
Unable to find a fitting response, Sherlock settled for witty humor (After all, he could be hilarious if he wanted to be!): “You’re one strange individual, John Watson”.
“I trust you” The detective stated breathily, before his voice dissolved again into the smallest, most wonderful, utterly erotic noises. John stopped his ministrations for a second, surprised by the genuine statement of affection. His heart was suddenly jumping in his throat, when he reached to bring this remarkable man next to him closer, to kiss him like he
.  A scientist, a genius, a hero in his own particular way and yet ... a child, driven by a need to understand the world around him, to understand the causal happenings of the whole universe, simply because he hated to not understand. A kind soul who pretends not to care about anyone or anything, but who escapes into the sweet lure of addiction whenever the world and his own existence gets too much. A scarred heart, controlled by a brilliant, yet sometimes cruel mind. A mind he seeks to always occupy so it wouldn't overwhelm him. Sitting in a golden cage to keep distance to everyone around him, because
“Greg’s hoping that the Fab 5 can help John to gain new confidence, so that he can face whatever comes his way like the wonderful person that he is-“
When they both reached their third cup of tea, there was a small comfortable silence that came with having a honest conversation that had long been overdue. John felt like he understood both of them so much better, for which he was thankful. Speaking of thankful…
“Do you actually listen to yourself from time to time or do you just enjoy hearing yourself talk?” Now, although John was… to say the least… intimidating like this, Sherlock Holmes wouldn’t just stand there and let himself be degraded out of unknown reasons. He straightened his spine (John was intimidating like that, after all) and put on his famous cold expression. “Excuse me?”
“Yet I can’t get that moment out of my head when I saw you falling. It’s haunting me whenever I close my eyes. I know now that…it wasn’t real but… I didn’t know then. Hell, part of me still doesn’t believe that I have you back”
“He was… look, I probably shouldn’t tell you that, but since you two seem so incredibly ignorant when it comes to talking about things which are actually important… we did all that we can…to stop him from…following you”
“Because I’m terrified, okay?” He huffed, a little surprised at his own outburst. “There. You got your answer.” He debated storming out of the room, for dramatic reasons, but the warmth of Sherlock’s embrace- which didn’t loosen one bit during their conversation- kept him rooted right where he was. He felt Sherlock’ heartbeat- erratic and fast, and
The exit out of the cab and arrival in the flat went by in a blur, for Sherlock managed to work himself in a state of nervous excitement, that left his heart pounding faster and his whole body felt like it was on
The last two weeks had been quiet, without exciting cases and much too much time to think, to mop around, to worry about Sherlock’s breakdown, about his role in this all, about what it meant for the dynamics of their relationship. Sure, he knew that he was in love with Sherlock (he came to terms with calling it that roughly three days prior, when he realized that he passed the point where he would have been able to lie to himself about it), but did Sherlock know, too? Did Sherlock
Sherlock had at first thought John was in pain.  Why else would he quake?  Why else would he moan against his lips when he kissed him?  When he pressed his mouth to John’s neck, gently nipping with his teeth?  Surely he was not hurting him.  Yes, Sherlock did wrap John in his arms, holding him as if he might not ever let him go, but not with his full strength.  He had no desire to hurt the man who had been so tender with him.  The man who made his chest feel as if it were about to burst.
“I’ve never known you to do one speck of housework, even after all the times I’ve asked you to help.  As I recall, you said ‘housework is for old ladies and others who have nothing better to occupy their minds and time’.  So something else must be up.  What is it, Sherlock?”
“Whilst you were napping, I went out and bought you a present,” he says, changing the subject, a sly smile on his face.
Stamford headed toward the nearest large cluster of lush foliage. With Sherlock in tow, when Stamford reached the far side of it, he stopped, motioning toward a clutch of makeshift tents.
No, had I listened to John I would be snuggled beside him on the second full night of our honeymoon, sated from ticking yet another entry off my Pail List. (The personal sacrifices John has had to endure in order to help me achieve my goals make me want to marry him all over again.  He says ‘It’s my pleasure’, but you and I both know how good he is at keeping a stiff upper lip.)
A wry smile lifted the side of John’s mouth.  “Thou has no idea.   One time he cut his finger and one would have thought his arm had been fallen off, so dramatic be he, whinging and moaning.  But he has proved to be a faithful squire, and I, for one, would not like to fight opposite him in battle; fierce and fearless, he be.  He charges in as if he were immortal, unconcerned for his own safety.  Tis the kind of man one wants at thy side when stakes be high.”
“It was obvious…Redbeard.”  John shrugs, trying to appear modest, but I know he is pleased with himself for having fit the clues together.
John looked at the lips that until now he had never realized called out to him like a Siren.  Yes.  Yes, he very, very much wanted to kiss Sherlock.
“So, Colin, you told John, but did not see fit to tell me?  For the last two days, you visited me because you
“Stubborn fool,” Sherlock spat, leaning away.  “I only do it so we be free of Cedric.  When he be imprisoned, like the animal he be, we can-”
John shrugged.  “She didn’t have any say.  She was able to keep Scotti with her in prison until she stopped breast feeding, and then she gave up her parental rights.  It was part of the deal Mycroft made with her. You know about that, don’t you?”
His cock straining painfully at his jeans, he took a panicked breath.  ‘Calm down, Watson, he’ll never have to know.’
“You show no physiological signs of food or sleep deprivation.” Ella went on as if Sherlock had not said anything. “You took a considerable amount of time to decide if you have had such difficulties before, and now you’re drumming your fingers; you seem nervous. Why is that?”
“But thou be in pain, John.”  He did not so quickly forget the small laugh that had jarred John’s injury.
“Well, unlike you, I don’t know within the first three pages who did it, why the brother cheated on his wife, and how the murderer escaped capture for three years even though he has ‘features so distinctive that even the plastic surgeons are at a loss as how to transform him into someone who...”
John looks back at his toast, finishes spreading the butter and adds some jam.  So what I said was true; that is why he is having trouble looking at me.
“Yes, John, by selling your services; it is as simple as that.  You do for him, uh, what you did for me last night and he gives you money.  It is all very straightforward and you both walk away getting what you need.  If you are worried you are not qualified, I will vouch for your expertise.”  My face, and groin, grows warm at the thought.  My eyes stray to his lips and I consider opening the window to cool myself off.
Clamping his mouth shut so as not to let loose any sound, he breathed heavily through his nose.  His hand moved faster and faster along his hardness, hastening his descent into a Sherlock-paved Hell, until a flash of white hot heat seared his brain and he released his need.  Gasping, a moan escaped him, and he prayed should someone have heard it they thought it one of the larger animals they had seen rambling through the forest.
“I be sleeping.  I heard an ‘umph’; it must have been when Sir John be hit.  Twas dark, but I saw a knife come down and stab him.  I rose to defend Sir John, but as I grabbed the intruder, that must be when he stabbed me.  I tried to overpower him, but he be too strong, and he ran.  He escaped into the woods.”  Cedric jutted his chin out, as if daring anyone to challenge his assertion he had done everything he could.
Turning back to the room, my eyes rest on John.   I have no need to remind myself he will not be with me much longer.  I see it in his pallor.  In the infrequent, shallow breaths raising and deflating his chest.  In his eyes as they open, wearily watching me walk into the room.  It is one of his rare lucid moments and my heart leaps as I see the light in his eyes.  As I see John,
“My goal, John, is not to have your wife arrested, but to see that whoever has it out for me will never use you a pawn.  Ever again.”
John turned, sitting straight in his chair and puzzling over Sherlock’s strange behavior. Puzzling over of the balloons that swayed with the air current in the room.
“Laila?  The old blind woman?  She be your mother?”  John asked with incredulity, rocking forward and resting his elbows on this knees.   “How does Sherlock not know?  He has long been acquainted with her.”
To Colin’s great relief, Sherlock did not pursue the matter.  Twas not appealing to have a conversation in the middle of the night about found family.  In front of Sir John and Aldus.  Besides, they be getting light-headed from lack of sleep.  At least Colin knew
With a sting in my eyes and a flutter in my chest, I think back to that very first year.  This is our first Christmas as a married couple, but those many years ago was our true first Christmas together, the first we were Sherlock and John, friends and flatmates, not fully realising the depth of our bond or what we would come to mean to each other.
“Do not be ridiculous!  For what reason would he have killed Eduard?! As you say, Eduard offended no one, and surely that includes Sherlock. No, he did not commit this odious act.  He could not have.  We talked, and came to the conclusion-”
Dr. Watson's wife.   Mycroft saw her immediate spark of recognition as Mary’s gaze settled on him for the briefest of moments.
“I fear my dear brother regards the MOD far too highly. He’s always been a bit, shall I say, whimsical.”
The Skull stared blankly at Sherlock, its eyes fixed on him. It really had no comment on the matter, but that didn’t stop Sherlock from fuming at it.
“That, I can’t answer. MOD isn’t certain when the chips went missing—sometime around a year ago, give or take a few months. The GPS hadn’t yet been activated, so there’s no way of knowing where they went. The serial number on John’s chip matches a number from the missing batch.” Mycroft looked down. “There was a bit of a mash-up at the agency during that time, and I daresay this is not the only resulting in, shall I say, misfortune.”
“We talked to several people, men and women both. No one who seemed untoward. Besides, Eduard did nothing to bring attention to himself; he did not bother anyone. We drank a few mazers, then Eduard went in search of a lavatory. Oh! But twas this noble, he looked to be - twas more friendly than the rest, but we never saw him before tonight.”
Had he known he was about to meet the person who was to become the love of his life, he would have been intrigued to know there could be such a thing.  He had, of course, heard the phrase, but had never given thought to the possibility it might apply to him.
“When Harry and I were little, Dad used to put the treats and stockings out.  Every Christmas morning when we woke up the milk and pies would be gone and presents would be under the tree; he kept doing it even after we found out there really was no Father Christmas.”  John paused as he hung up a stocking stitched with the name “Sherlock”, his hand poised on the tack as he looked away, lost in his thoughts.  Squaring his shoulders and clearing his throat, he continued speaking.   “When Dad left, Mum was always too drunk to remember Christmas, let alone keep up with the tradition, so Harry and I did it.  It somehow made things a little more normal.  I’ve done it every year since except when I was in the Army.  It just makes me feel…  I don’t know, it feels right somehow even when there are no children about.”
“That’s the key to the flat Mary lived in when we met.  Why would she still have it?  When we moved her I saw her give it to her landlady.”
The beeps on the heart monitor grew further apart, slower, until there were none at all.  The doctors left John with the body that had ceased to breathe. That had ceased to be Sherlock.
“The worst of it was, I later learned Laila had not been unfaithful.  Twas another Laila, a young woman from the city of whom the servant had spoken.  But twas too late, my Laila and Sherlock were gone.  Forever, it seems.  Laila, I have no hope of seeing; I cannot blame her for never wanting to be in my presence again after how I treated her.  But Sherlock?  Tis my greatest regret I am not able to see him one last time before I die.”
Taking Scotti’s chubby hand in his, John returned her infectious smile, finding strength in it.  “You be a good girl for Mrs. Hudson.  Daddy will be back in a few minutes.”
But John had come to accept, and embrace, Sherlock’s capacity to not only love but to love greatly. Passionately. Devotedly. And John had been grateful to start every single fucking day wrapped around a languid, warm Sherlock, listening to his rhythmic breathing. Knowing he loved and was loved. And knowing that it would be the same the next day. And the next.
Leaving the flat to take her rubbish to the bins, Mrs. Hudson shrieked when she saw who stood in the hallway at the foot of the stairs to 221b.
subtle.  Which of course means there’s something that does scare him.  I haven’t even a clue what it might be.  But he’s right when he says everything I do is to show him I love him.  Hurting him isn’t even an option.
Turning back to Sherlock, in a low voice that brooked no argument, John said, “I’m going to my flat to get out of these
“Yes, daily, as you so matter-of-factly pointed out.  Really?  You get it up every day?  More than once?”
I search for some clue telling me John is mocking me, for I see nothing amazing about getting drunk and landing in jail, but he is no less exuberant in his praise of me as he has been an entire lifetime.
John and Sherlock each try to come up with a solution to Sherlock's kissing anxiety. Sherlock's works.
As the helicopter came into view it shined a bright light onto two downed men and one fearful, but erect, one, whose hands were held high in anticipation of what was to come next.
Nika picked up the mobile, pressing Call as she walked to the spare bedroom to retrieve her carry-on, confirming to Mr. Holmes that there was nothing would please her more than to be of service. And when she was done packing, a task that took no more than a quarter-hour, Nika rode the lift down from the eighth floor to street level, hurriedly walking around the corner to the Irish pub, Sheep’s Head Inn; Oleg said it felt like home.
“Ahhh, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said as she neared the top of the stairs, putting on an expression that he hoped vaguely resembled a smile. He wouldn’t want her to inquire as to what was amiss.
He hadn’t lied to John when he’d said he was weary. Still, as tired as he was, he couldn’t rest; the packaging that had come with the sock puppet beckoned him.
Listening to John talk, the ache that earlier felt more than Sherlock could bear, grew.  It almost consumed him.   Grasping at the only thing he thought might be able to help John, “You have your daughter, now, John.  She needs you.”
John says he does not believe I have never felt sexual desire, that I deleted it or repressed it, or some such nonsense.  That since I now know how wonderfully blissful touching him and kissing him feels (he certainly rates himself highly), if I abstain from not only those activities but my daily ejaculations, my sexual attraction to him should be activated.  Then we can resume our physical relationship; take it to a more meaningful level.  Whatever that means.  It is already meaningful for me; is it not for you, John?
But to my dismay, He pulls page after page out of the large stack and proceeds to list my “good deeds”:
Whilst John spoke with Aldus, Sherlock went to the body and, leaning over to get a closer look at the mortal wound, inspected the gash with his finger. When he finished he rolled the body over, first onto one side, then to the other.
“Oh.” Sherlock’s foot went still. He looked at John intently, thinking. Not knowing quite what to do.
When he lowered his hood he saw an almost imperceptible twinge in the man’s eyes, a faint startle of recognition.  John’s mouth parted as if to say something, then closed quickly as if he had changed his mind.
“Good evening,” I say, holding out a hand in greeting, my smile saying I couldn’t be more pleased to meet him. “Giorgio Amici, here to collect Sherlock.”
Guilt flooded John. Truly, not his business. “Sherlock, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have... It really is none of my business. I just… doesn’t matter. Yes, I’d love some tea. Thank you.”
“Take my hand.”  I hold my open palm out to him, and when he puts his hand in mine, I guide it to the gap in my trousers, barely breathing because there is nothing more wondrous than to have John Watson’s hand on me.  It is his turn to moan, and I am humbled that such a simple touch can bring him such exquisite pleasure.
be alright after some rest, thank fucking God, I set the chart down and moved to the side of the bed, pressing my thighs against it to steady myself.  My heart pounding, heavy breaths flaring my nostrils, I closed my eyes, trying to squeeze out the painful memory of the last time I saw him this pale…at the foot of St. Bart’s.  When I reopened my eyes, I couldn’t tear them from his face; his dark curls a captivating contradiction as they softly framed the sharpness of his features.  Eyelashes black as night feathered against translucent skin.  Without thinking, I reached out and touched him.  Traced a fine cheekbone with my fingertips, ghosting along its ridge.  With the pad of my thumb, I smoothed the full bottom lip that had so totally entranced me since the day I met him.  Trembling, I was unsure if it was from the initial shock of fearing him dead, or because of his proximity.  From being so intimate with this man with whom I had so helplessly fallen in love, knowing I would never have the chance to touch him this way again.
I look away, pretending to whistle, but I do not think my declaration of innocence is fooling her one bit. Though, if I may say in my defense, it is not
Nika hurried into the hospital and down the hall to the office that only the day before had been hers. Dropping her things onto the desk with a whump, she turned on the computer, pulling up Dr. Watson’s file from the server. She studied it for what she could well have missed in the physical files.
Livid, John fought against lashing out.  Twould do no good. Sir Norman sat astride a horse, armed with a sword; John had nothing but his anger and his hatred.
ties, by the way. Or cologne. So what’s up, Sherlock? You’ve been acting weird all day. What’s it have to do with the balloons? You having a party I don’t know about. A party for two?”
be ill, for, in Sherlock’s innocence of how the world worked, he seemed unaware of the situation’s severity. As be typical of Sherlock, he showed no fear.  His head held high, had one not known otherwise, they would have thought he be out for a Sunday walk.
The apathy Sherlock showed towards the Inspector’s threat alarmed Lestrade more than the physical deterioration of the man sitting in front of him. Deducing crimes was Sherlock’s entire life and if losing that didn’t matter to him then there was little that would.
Disheveled, his hair be an untamed mess, his clothes filthy and streaked with blood, but never before had he been more beautiful. He struggled against the ropes that bound him, wild eyes frantically searching.
“It never stopped.” Sherlock took the bold step of enveloping John’s hand between both of his own. John
Sherlock’s bow glided smoothly across the strings, but he hardly noticed, his focus now entirely on the baffling rhythm of footsteps.  His eyes alert.  His head cocked just so, to catch every sound. Not yet aware how hard his heart pounded.
A very undignified scream escapes my lips and before I know it I find myself sprawled on the floor, having involuntarily taken flight from the powerful surge of electricity which attacked me.
I rub my overtired eyes and, hauling the pillows and blankets with me, I go lie on the sofa.  Arranging the bedding over me, I lay my head on John’s pillow, turning my head so my nose is filled with its scent.  The other pillow I hold, imagining it is John, squeezing him tightly to me.  My mobile now charged, I have brought it with me to the sofa and I clasp it in my hand, ready for John’s text.
Jim had to admit, however, that the good doctor cleaned up well. He wasn’t Jim’s usual taste, but then he supposed that preferring taller men was something he and John had in common. They certainly had a specific taller man in common, at the very least. Still, though…Doctor Watson obviously took care in his appearance tonight, no doubt nervous about what was expected among gay men. This really would be quite fun.
“I…me too,” John replied, awkward and flustered and far too obvious. How Sherlock could put up with it on a constant basis was a mystery. John was, as Jim had already more than clearly seen, an open book. Perhaps Sherlock wasn’t so blind to the surprising allure of Doctor John Watson, or perhaps—less likely—there were hidden aspects to the good doctor. In any case, Jim planned to suss out everything.
Jim was something different, however. John actually and truly enjoyed the time spent with him, beyond the awkwardness of the first half hour or so, and so found himself feeling a measure of defensive concern towards the other man on Jim’s behalf. It wasn’t just a gay thing to use someone to decide what you liked and then toss them aside like yesterday’s rubbish. The fact that anyone could or would do that to someone like Jim, who seemed so sweet and kind, was inconceivable. That was why John knew he had to be careful. He didn’t want to hurt Jim if this turned out to be something he couldn’t do, and he hoped that they could at least remain friends if…whatever it was they were doing didn’t work out.
Immediately on the defensive, John pulled away slightly with a frown. “What?” he asked, voice a touch hard. Trust issues, the therapist had said. Good to see that they were not gone. Made the eventual reveal so much sweeter.
Right. Nothing was going to be figured out until John arrived at the date. Still, he wished he knew a little more about what to expect, but he couldn’t risk Sherlock finding out too soon. It was amusing knowing that the genius had no idea his date was with a man, but something else tugged at him and made him want to keep it a secret a little while longer as well. He wasn’t ashamed that it was a man he was going to see, but a part of him still wanted to keep Sherlock in the dark for as long as possible.
“Despite what our neighbours would have us believe, a flimsy piece paper with our signatures on it is not in any way, shape, or form indicative of the significance of our relationship,” Sherlock began bitingly, the hand that had been shaking as he poured the wine now steady as he moved back to take his seat. “The fabled permanence of marriage, we both know, is not so ironclad. While divorce rates are lowering with every passing year, that is only due to the fact that couples have been cohabitating for some time prior, and only marry for the benefits. Far too much effort for benefits we don’t even need.”
Jim let out a small laugh, grinning. “You don’t need to tell me twice. Although hopefully next time I see you it’s on a date, not because of an injury.”
As they’d mentioned in the pub, John was no stranger to sex, and he hadn’t earned his reputation in the army by harmless kissing, but it seemed different having the interest of a man on him. And Jim was interested. In him. John. Would wonders never cease? Even more wonderful, Jim didn’t seem put off by John’s preoccupation with Sherlock, though he made certain it was known that it was only professional between them. Jim hadn’t seemed to mind, and he’d laughed at more than one story John told about the dangers of living in that flat, and his hand had practically stayed on his arm all night. John had rather liked it.
Glancing around the establishment, Jim took in the other patrons, the location, the music playing over the speakers…all so predictable. And
“He told me he’s known you about five years now. That you guys really just have a working relationship, but that he cares about you.”
“I just…” Jim looked away, moving to bite his lip before huffing and releasing it a moment later as the glue tugged. “I just don’t really want to be alone right now,” he murmured quietly.
It wasn’t like Sherlock was his mother or anything, and he certainly wasn’t John’s wife; they were flatmates and nothing more. Friends, perhaps, if people like Sherlock even had friends. So what if he’d stayed the night out somewhere. So what if it was with a man…though John was hoping to leave that part out. It wasn’t like John owed Sherlock anything. Nothing at all, in fact.
Fuelled by the morning’s experience, caught not in Sherlock’s orbit but instead another man’s, John yanked his arm out of Sherlock’s grasp and stood his ground. “No, Sherlock!” he declared, with enough authority that it stopped Sherlock dead in his tracks as he stared in shock at John, who usually never contradicted him about such things. John drew in a deep breath and crossed his arms over his chest. “Sherlock—”
“Your end of the deal?” John snorted again. “Sherlock, we’re in a relationship, not a business transaction. There is no deal. You’re not obligated to have sex with me just because we’re together, whether we’re in love or not. I knew you were asexual when we got together. I knew what that meant. And I meant what I said. Kissing, hugging, cuddling…that’s all that I want from you Sherlock. I just want to be with you. To be able to say, ‘back off everyone, this delightful and arrogant arsehole of a consulting detective is my boyfriend, and I’m going to kiss him now.’” John grinned slightly at that, and leaned in quickly to peck Sherlock’s lips with his own.
John’s eyes widened again and he took a step back as thought physically struck, before stepping forward beseechingly.
, Sherlock replied with a roll of his eyes. There was no denying the words were coming from the man across from him. The man whose hard edges hadn’t seemed to soften at all during their conversation.
L was due to inherit the jewelled egg in her father’s will, but only once she had finished her schooling at university. L, however, had no interest in uni, which was a sensitive and sore subject in the family. In came R. Together they apparently hatched (ignore this pun too) the plan to steal the family egg and sell it for money to run away together. L gave R the spare key to the house which he then used to sneak in and cause his mayhem, covering his tracks by breaking the glass pane in the back door to simulate a break-in. Sherlock, however, saw through this.
John was about to retort in anger again, before he processed Sherlock’s words, or rather the tone of his words. There was an edge to them, yes, but there was something else hidden there as well. Something…unsure. He swallowed down his anger, tried to organise his thoughts, staring at Sherlock as he worked his mind around an impossible thought.
John stared at the bed. This wasn’t his room. This wasn’t his room. He wasn’t certain when he got here, but he was here now. So he stared. The room was a mess. The police had been here too. He wouldn’t like the mess, John knew. He always kept his room pristine, unlike the rest of the flat.
John shook his head, and there was no regret or resentment in his eyes. “How could I ever regret this? How could I ever resent you? You give my life meaning, Sherlock Holmes. We’ll deal with whatever comes up in the future, but if this is what I’m lucky enough to have for the rest of my life, just you safe and warm in my arms, then that is all I could ever want. More than I had ever hoped of having.”
John glanced at him, a small smile shared between them, before he turned a little more on his stool to face Jim better. An unconscious gesture, and a good one. “I have to admit, I was…worried about this…date,” he said delicately, as though still unsure how to admit that this was what it was. “Like you said, I’ve never done with a bloke…er, man before. I wasn’t entirely certain what to expect.”
That would certainly be different. He’d seen the porn—hell, he’d even seen porn with women with strap-ons, though he’d never been quite
John didn’t really recall how he got there, standing in the doorway to 221B, staring but not really seeing. The police were gone now, though the mess they left behind still remained. Looking for evidence. Looking for the truth they wanted to find. They never would. That truth didn’t exist. Only the real one did.
Well then. The fancy egg was worth upwards of at least half a million pounds. It was insured, apparently, but the family wanted it back as it had been in the family for generations. He supposed that that could make the case mildly interesting, though still not something Sherlock generally cared for. Sherlock hardly seemed to care about the case at all…so why were they doing it?
As if he sensed John’s mood, Jim remained quiet and meek, only speaking to answer John’s questions during the examination, treatment, and paperwork. He looked far more dejected than he had at the start, and John could see that he looked a lot more worn than he had just a week previous.
Did Sherlock know? John had tested the waters during what would be their first dinner together, wondering if Sherlock could somehow tell that the unassuming man sitting in front of him was his soulmate, had even later brought up the mention of soulmates, but he had been ruthlessly cut down. Politely, but ruthlessly.
As Becca described, the injuries were hardly anything to worry about, though the patients certainly knew how to kick up a fuss regardless, and John was already envisioning the end of the day and perhaps a quick stop at a pub before braving the return to the flat. It was amazing what a sense of entitlement did to a person, and he withstood more than one strident critique on how they ran a business. One woman in particular had had John clenching his teeth, and he was surprised he hadn’t snapped his pen in half with how tightly he was holding it, when she began proclaiming that their unprofessionalism and ignoring of patients “needs” was the reason why they weren’t “
Thickly swallowing, John shook his head quickly. “Not until you tell me why,” he said resolutely, back stiffening, shoulders squaring, legs planted in military pose. Normally the sight would have intrigued Sherlock, but now it just made his shoulders slump slightly. Things had been going so well…
It didn’t take long before they were ensconced in a booth at the pub John sometimes frequented after a trying work shift, not even stopping to think about people recognizing him for more than a minute before focusing on Jim again, with drinks before the both of them.
The victims, who requested to remain anonymous for as long as possible, were a seemingly idyllic family, fresh off a recent weekend holiday, and had just returned home only to discover that they had been victims of vandals. Though the frontward appearance of the house seemed undisturbed, the real tragedy waited within. Upon entering their home, the family—consisting of a father, mother, and teenage daughter—found the interior in disarray, including a rather crude drawing of male genitalia on the entry wall in spray paint. Mirrors were smashed, sofa pillows were flung about, and potted plants were emptied on the carpet. In addition to the vandalism, there were also missing jewellery, silverware, and most importantly a family heirloom worth a pretty pound.
,” the voice said, sounding as though they had stopped walking into the room once John came into view.
Jim shrugged, cradling his own mug in both hands to fight off the morning chill, made worse by being wet and nearly naked. “They’re not too bad.” He smirked a little then, a tease in his dark eyes as he lifted his mug to take a sip. “Normally I don’t mind a few bruises, but only when they were fun to receive.” He winked at John, who spluttered into his coffee, before turning around in what John could only term a sashay. “I’m going to get dressed. If you stick around, I’ll make you breakfast since we didn’t get much of a dinner last night.”
another man before. At least, not in a personal setting. I’m still getting used to all this, but just because I can’t do this right now doesn’t mean I won’t be able to someday. And I’d like to. With you. Just…not now.”
Grinning larger now with that second text, John was reluctant to put it down when a patient was sent to him, but he didn’t let that affect his work ethic and he took the time to see to Mrs Ramsay’s rheumatoid arthritis before allowing himself to touch his phone again, where another message was waiting for him.
The doctor/nurse stood frozen for several moments before blinking quickly and licking his lips. “Sorry, do I know you?” He shook his head. “How did you know all that?” He seemed to hesitate for a moment, before swallowing. “And it was Afghanistan.”
“It’s my job…and my pleasure,” John added on, trying to be more truthful. After all Jim had been through, he deserved that much at least. And, after all, he
John wondered what his soulmate thought. As a speaker, did he believe he was alone? Did he believe he just didn’t have a soulmate? Was he hoping he did? Was he waiting to meet John? Was he even gay?
Jim laughed, resting his hand over John’s on his knee. “Maybe I just find you more fascinating,” he said with a grin. “I just want to get to know you. It’s been so long since I met a genuinely decent bloke.”
It still rather shocked him that someone like Jim could be interested in him, and yet there was no denying that after the man’s flirtatious actions, and especially not after there was a solid date planned for later that day. He was flattered, honestly. It certainly made up for Sherlock practically ignoring him ever since the case with the serial bigamist and her murderous husband was over.
Jim settled his hand over John’s arm again, giving it a small squeeze, and quietly drank his beer as they kept eye contact. John glanced down only briefly at Jim’s hand for a moment, his smile never failing, and Jim left it there for some time.
Jim, cheeks stained red, eyes wide but staring at nothing, lips swollen and bruised from John’s abuse and that which happened earlier, chest heaving for breath, and the tell-tale bulge in his trousers, laid sprawled on the sofa before John. John, whose eyes were equally as wide and whose chest was equally as heaving, was staring at the body before him like he’d never seen it before. He stumbled back, covering his face with a shaking hand.
For the second time that day, John (almost) spilled coffee on himself as Sherlock suddenly jumped up with an exclamation and proclaimed that they needed to leave. John rolled his eyes at his manic flatmate before tossing his mostly undrunk coffee away and grabbing his jacket to follow the impossible man out for another few hours of pointlessly running around London’s streets.
“John, the case!” Sherlock protested, reaching for him again, but John took a step higher up the stairs back to the landing.
tempting. He and Jim were having a good time, frankly, just chatting and laughing together, more at ease than John could remember being for a while. It wasn’t the first time he crashed on someone’s sofa, either, and he found himself reluctant to leave for a number of reasons.
As if reading his thoughts, Becca stuck her head in his door as he cleaned up from the previous patient, a young man with a narrow laceration on his cheek that needed little more than ointment and a plaster, having long since stopped bleeding on its own. John glanced up at her with a sort of tired hope, causing her to laugh. “Hanging in, Dr Watson?” she teased. “I’ve got just one more patient for you, and then I’ve been told to give you the all-clear.” She winked, and looked quite pretty when she did so, but John had already been warned off quite clearly at the start, so he never contemplated the matter seriously. And, to be honest, he was somewhat alarmed by the look of her wife in the photo Becca kept at her desk, who looked quite capable of taking him on despite his army training.
Jim looked regretful, but hopeful. John had to admit to feeling the same way. Jim had looked more than a little hesitant, and John worried for a moment he’d really messed up, before Jim had shyly asked if he might text him later. John had, with a grin, enthusiastically agreed, uni twats be damned.
Sholto was commanding, honourable, and steady. Before…everything. Back then, however, John had been enraptured, admittedly wonderstruck, his admiration for his commanding officer evident in his gaze he knew. The man was, however, everything that John wished to be, and so he couldn’t be too embarrassed by it all. And…yes, perhaps John had acknowledged that the man had a certain sensuality about him, a way of holding himself that could be downright indecent if he had had a mind for it. John wasn’t the only one envious (appreciative) of the man’s physique and bearing.
John was more tactile after that point, and he came to Sherlock’s defence far more quickly than he had in the past, perhaps in pittance for the harsh things he’d said before, but Sherlock didn’t care. He had John back.
Sherlock nodded, drew in a shuddering breath, before moving to crawl into bed to wait for his partner. He didn’t remember when they started sleeping in the same bed, it just sort of happened one night and then John never left. And John, perfect John, had never tried to push for more. He simply held Sherlock, as he had promised to always do.
“I eventually got out. Kicked him out of my flat, changed the locks, even moved after a few months when I could afford it. He…didn’t go away easily, but eventually he stopped, and I didn’t see him anymore. I…I guess I sort of just forgot him. I was happier not to remember him. Until a few days ago,” he grimaced.
“Oh, it’s no problem, really!” the man said hurriedly. “I was just on my way to get myself a cup, so I can easily get two more.” He flashed John a bright smile. “Please, it’s my fault.”
It was Sherlock’s turn to take a startled step back, eyebrows once more in his hair as he stared back at John. It was exceedingly obvious that he hadn’t been expecting John to admit to his sexuality. Asshole. The shock didn’t remain evident on his face for much longer, however, and he frowned deeply at John.
John paused, the knowledge that Sherlock couldn’t tell that it was a man’s number causing him to smirk slightly. “I’d say early- to mid-thirties, actually,” he said with a touch of smugness. He glanced at the number on his hand, wondering if he should rub it in Sherlock’s face that it wasn’t a woman at all, but something held him back. Perhaps it was the whole talk about John accepting a man’s number. More than that, it was John with a man’s number and a tentative date.
“Of course it was,” the doctor/nurse laughed, even if he did look a little rueful at his life being displayed so openly like that. “I’d heard you said things to upset the other nurses and Doctor Roberts, but…that was just something else.”
Turning at his approach, Jim’s smile faltered as his eyes slowly drifted first down John’s body and then even more slowly up, taking in the still slightly damp spots where John’s shirt clung to him a little more. He swallowed, letting out a heavy breath as he turned away, which both made John feel warm with a flush but also like a proud peacock. Though his self-consciousness had been sparked by Jim’s initial reaction, his ego had been stoked a little by realizing just what Jim’s reaction meant. He was still continually surprised at every show of attraction Jim displayed towards him, though he made him wonder if he ever looked the same.
John snorted, rolling his eyes as he leaned back in his chair, but he was smiling. No rush, still wearing scrubs, condiment against his cuticles. It took Sherlock far too long to put together that John was currently on his lunch break. And visiting Sherlock. Again. Finally.
“I really don’t want to be a bother,” a familiar voice was saying softly as he was led back, causing John to stiffen where he was, facing away from the door. “It’s not even that bad, it looks worse than it—
The man, picking up the bouquet from the rubbish, froze. He turned his gaze from the brightly coloured petals to the injured man in the bed, and Sherlock could see a tick of the man’s jaw where he’d clenched it shut. Ah. Struck a nerve, apparently.
However, when John finally got the courage to ask Jim if he fancied a bite to eat, there was no response. In fact, when he nervously sent a second message some odd minutes later, he got an error message saying his text could not be delivered. Every message after that also failed to deliver, leaving John in a surly albeit worried mood.
With that thought in mind, the sun’s rays slowly rising, Jim carefully began extracting himself from John’s hold. Timing, after all, was everything.
Sherlock took a deep breath, swallowed, and looked at John with a bright intensity, the likes of which he hadn’t seen in a few days as the illness stripped him of himself.
Now, this isn't a guarantee that the next chapter will be out soon after too. I'm going to be working on my other story I'm updating simultaneously with this one first, but I'm hoping that getting this chapter out means that at least my brain is done being dumb. For the most part. We can't expect miracles now!
Sherlock choked down an embarrassing sob, leaning forward to press his forehead to John’s chest, tightening his arms around the man. “John,” he whimpered.
Sherlock, cheeks a little flushed, rocked on his feet for a moment before moving to his spot across the table. He cleared his throat, looking at John across the table with another twist of his stomach. The lighting did, admittedly, look good on John, and it made their kitchen seem far more intimate. The heat in his cheeks did not dissipate as he thought about what they would be doing later, rather the opposite in fact , but this time the pink flesh was not due to any sort of pleasure.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed at Lestrade as John glanced once more at the pair of them before turning to leave. That wasn’t what he wanted at all.
“Jim!” John said firmly in his best Captain Watson voice, causing Jim to jump and stare at him in shock, cheeks once more brightly flushed when they had been dulling. “I’m not upset with you, Jim. I…I still like you,” he said, hearing and feeling the truth in the words as he said them. “And any other day, I’d most certainly be amenable to…all this,” he said, gesturing between the two of them. “But it’s a lot to take in. I’ve never…
John was…indescribable. He was a contradiction of self, too many personalities wrapped up in soft jumpers with the hard line of a gun at his back, firm harms with gentle touches. He rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s deductions, but his lips curled into a smile. He was…something else entirely from everything that Sherlock had ever known. Was it really any wonder Sherlock had fallen as deeply as he had?
Kissing was good. Sherlock enjoyed the kissing, the holding, even the gentle caresses of John’s hands over him. He would love nothing more than to do this and only this for the rest of his life with John, but he knew that that would make the rest of their lives together very short indeed, which he was not all right with. Not at all.
scent, and John Watson cried for everything he’d lost, everything he now no longer had a chance to have.
Jim glanced over at John from where he was fiddling with his keys to get the front door of his flat open, giving him a small smile a shake of his head. “No, I…I told him I’d call the police if I see him again.” Even after saying that, however, Jim turned back to the door and hesitantly pushed it open, staring into the dark entrance. “I should probably change the locks,” he muttered to himself.
Right. Just because he saved the number, that didn’t mean he was actually going to call the man. Right?
, the googly eyes Watson sent to Sherlock, and even worse were returned by Sherlock, were nauseating. However, it was obvious that Watson was only just coming to terms with his sexuality, probably hadn’t even acknowledged his inevitable attraction to the detective for what it was, which made him easy prey.
“Sorry,” John rushed to say, turning away quickly for the excuse of looking for his phone. “Um, lost in thought, for a moment,” he mumbled. “Er, Sherlock might be missing me.”
John moved into the room then, moved to take Sherlock into his arms, and Sherlock went willingly. Even though John was the shorter of the pair, Sherlock curled against him, clinging to him as though afraid he’d disappear if he ever let go. John lightly chuckled.
John’s flush returns with a vengeance when he remembers Antoni’s words. It’s true, the attention those eyes can command so easily is dazzling. He feels light-headed. For the very first time, he allows himself to be pulled in from these eyes, no longer caring what the sudden eruption of nervous tingles in his stomach might imply. No longer caring what Sherlock might see. What he might show him.
It felt like a heavy weight was lifted from his shoulders. He himself worried for a second there when John carried the silent treatment on for over four hours. But it gave him time to put Sherlock into the picture; enough for them to finally be honest with one another. They better be. Or else he’d end up punching both of them in the face. Probably wouldn’t be necessary, though. Those idiots would work it out. They always did in the end.
Sherlock was touched in a way he usually wasn’t; John rarely talked about his time in the war, so it was easy to forget what it meant, what it implied that his partner had been there to mend the hurt soldiers and innocents alike. A wave of gratefulness washed over him; to have John
The moment Sherlock made eye-contact with Rosie, there was no holding back. The little girl wrung her way out of the (subconsciously defending tightened) grip of her father’s hand and ran towards a slightly crunched down Sherlock. Donovan made another well-timed, low comment about her disbelieve of Sherlock being a good influence for a perfectly
... oh God, where was John?! (was that John's hand on his neck? Or was she choking him?) Why couldn't he find John's room? The room flooded with light, smelling of tea and gunpowder and woolly jumpers? Where was it? Why was everything black, thrown in utter chaos?!
family, deserved a shred of attention, too. Of course, he was being unfair here; Sherlock had made countless sacrifices for Rosie and himself and never once complained about it, but
loved bees)- but she was fighting sleep persistently. She was tucked safely in the crook of John’s arm and held onto Sherlock’s thumb, in an effort to keep both of her caregivers close.
His eyes flickered momentarily to John, seeking his friend’s approval and visibly glowing under the doctor’s approving nod. Mycroft was seemingly baffled for the second time that day.
Yet everything didn’t matter, everything faded away, when he heard two words, hastily mumbled: “Thank you”.
With a practiced motion, he took the detectives' pulse again (still too fast, but slightly better) and talked on and on, in hope that his voice could reach somehow inside the endless corridors of Sherlock's mind palace and help him to find the way out. Familiar sounds had always helped him with his PTSD attacks, so he figured it was worth a try. So, he just talked about everything and nothing, soothing and encouraging his distressed friend.
It was a terrifying thought, concerning their everyday life consisted mostly of Sherlock pissing off crazy axe murders, chasing down criminals in the dark alleyways, or blowing their flat up out of sheer boredom.
“Sherlock, no” It was the first time he spoke since they left the crime scene. His voice resonated hoarsely with the lack of use. “You shouldn’t have to adjust every single one of your actions to me. That shouldn’t be necessary.”
They held hands during the whole cab ride back to Baker Street. Neither of them felt the need to speak or look at the other; the silent presence was ensured by their tightly clasped hands. John was still angry. Angry about the whole fucked-up situation.
again, he found the left side of the bed no longer occupied. He closed his eyes and breathed, stubbornly ignoring the deep feeling of disappointment that settled in his heart almost instantly.
John didn't even know why Sherlock had taken the case. It was a two at best, nothing Sherlock would usually bother about. Maybe it had been because Lestrade pleaded him to come, after half of Scotland Yard’s officers were struck ill with a nasty influenza virus.
John didn’t miss the tiny smile flashing over Mycroft’s face and the way he subtly touched his left ring finger (more precisely the decent golden band situated there, something John had never observed before. Had it always been there?)
John’s mind returned to the core of the problem – Sherlock’s absence – and felt another small pang of anger in his guts. So, he had said it wasn’t a problem that The Work was top priority. But his family, for fuck’s sake
. Because John trusted him with this vulnerable part of himself; it was a gift; it was important … big …significant and…. Overwhelmingly real. Sherlock just wanted to take care of John. Because John deserved it. John deserved everything.
"I can't make tea onehanded" the doctor explained, an amused smile playing on his lips. Who would have known that someone as arrogant and obnoxious as Sherlock could be this adorable?! Sherlock gave a curt nod (so tea it is) and clumsily shrugged off his Belfast. "Get changed in something more comfy, will you?" John requested from the kitchen, because Sherlock still stood in the doorway, looking a bit at his wits end.
“I see, then take care my little scientists”. John leaned in and gave Rosie a soundful kiss, the kind of tickly, sweet Daddy-kisses she liked best, on her smiling mouth. He the brushed Sherlock’s arm in an affectionate gesture (They grew more and more acuminated to physical touch, and John had to admit that he was more than a little happy about it; Sherlock’s hugs were the best kind of hugs), and tipped his head slightly upwards to thank Sherlock for his babysitting, when something happened that John had not been ready for.
Sherlock stared into this face; this stupid annoying pitiful face of the meddling, cold, unbearably sad looking git; the face he wanted to scream at, the face he always sneered at, the face he couldn’t stand on most days … and …. didn’t. The need to make his displeasure known, to be mad at his brother for lying to him, for being so condescending and controlling, for leaving him and still pretending that he had any control over his life... the idea of fulfillment didn’t make him satisfied. He had felt so much anger, so much frustration over the years; nicely built up and directed at his brother- the man right before him, who clearly looked anything but hate-deserving right now. He had searched a culprit all along and found it in the only person he allowed near enough to actually be a target- and Mycroft took his faith enthusiastically, as if punishing himself for mistakes he didn’t even make. Of course, he didn’t make them…. He had been a child, damnit. Why… why had he been angry at his brother all the time? He couldn’t safe him from the coping mechanisms, which had been chosen for him and he later on choose for himself. It was easier to direct self-hate at someone else, but also so wrong. So damn
This looks very good so far and the process up to this point had been simple enough that John feels confident in his ability to reproduce it. But then again, that might be an aftereffect from the confidence-boost he has received yesterday.
He was the experienced one here, yet he somehow managed to handle all of this with the worst approaches possible. And now they came to a place where they had hurt each other on this new personal level, and John knew he had to fix it quickly, otherwise their relationship would be over before it even began.
“Then why-“ Sherlock continued nonchalant, only the tightening pressure against John’s stomach betraying the effect those words had on him- “are you hiding from me? What are you ashamed of?”
"No...as I was saying...could you stop interrupting me for a second, there?" John's voice was raised a little towards the end of his sentence, indicating a mild annoyance with the interlocuter. The detective smiled a little before he could stop himself.
John’s and Sherlock’s eyes meet briefly, and John thinks he saw a flicker of something in them, but that might have just been a trick of the light.
“As soon as I can, princess” John assured her. “Meanwhile, you and Sherlock have a good time” The Sherlock in question emerged next to John and gave him a warm smile. It was one of those rare smiles that covered his whole face, a smile that seemed to be reserved for him and Rosie only. It made John feel all fuzzy and warm inside, buzzing with an emotion he couldn’t quite place. He stifled a cough to overplay it, but he was sure Sherlock’s ever observant eyes had noticed. Glad he wasn’t commenting on it, John placed his daughter gently in Sherlock’s open arms. The sadness about her father’s nearing absence already forgotten, Rosie started to babble happily: “’Lock (John’s heart melted a little every time he heard her calling Sherlock by the special nickname she gave him) promised we’d make an ‘xperiment with Nana!” John feigned interest, but his eyes twinkled bemused at Sherlock who mouthed “Muffins” in his direction. This man…. John would never cease to be surprised by him!
It was then when the army doctor realized once again just how much in love he was with Sherlock. He was absolutely
“Shut your trap, you git”, he told him, gently. Sherlock, stunned into silence, stared at their clasped hands like it was the first time he had seen them. Somehow, John had managed to find the only thing to bring this gigantic brain network to a screeching halt.
That night, when they lay entwined among the sheets, and Sherlock was fast asleep, John pressed a gentle kiss against his partner’s sleep-warm lips.
“I missed you, too” the detective murmured quietly. A significant pause. Something was about to change.  He was ready. “That’s why I’m not leaving” he continued, gently maneuvering both of them a bit, so he could lie them down, to drape the covers over both of their bodies. “We don’t have to miss each other anymore, if we just stay together. How’s that sound?”
That morning, when John hopped in the shower with his mind still heavy from the prospects of the situation they found themselves in, he absent-mindedly wondered when the last time had been when he had to clean out the bathtub with bleach, due to one of Sherlock’s little ‘experiments’. Glad to find something else to occupy his mind, he pondered upon the subject nearly two minutes. Then it dawned on him. He couldn’t even remember. Nor could he remember the last time he almost gagged out his own lungs when finding rotten horse eyes next to the carrots. Or holes in the walls… or violent violin music at 3am… It not just dawned on him then. It was a downright epiphany.
"Sherlock!", Mycroft's 14-year-old voice resonated heavy in his ears, drumming through his skull. "It will be better. Stop struggling, Sherlock. She's gone now" Sherlock held his head and tugged at his curls, using physical stimuli to make the memory disappear (he really needed to sit down). Distressed, he noted that he couldn't breathe properly, as if Mycroft's arms were still wrapped tightly around his torso. "She's gone" The voice whispered again. "She won't hurt you anymore" "Shut up" Sherlock hissed (Why was the room spinning?).
For the first time, the realization of being in love with his best friend didn’t evoke melancholy longing of a past left behind, but felt… empowering. This-
A man made up from contraries, a personality of dichotomy: Calculating, yet reckless; arrogant, yet insecure; brilliant, yet oblivious; all-seeing and yet so fucking
"No" John answered coolly, unnerved by the personal assault on this clearly not personal matter. "Then you don't know how it this feels. How would you feel if someone who you love is described as abnormal?!" John stared at the thin line of the man's lips and really wished he had drank that second cup of tea that morning.
The detective sighed heavily and let himself slump down next to Sherlock. “Sorry, mate. It’s not my decision”
Sherlock felt as if he had been slapped in the face. The evidence. The evidence had been right there but he…he… misinterpreted it? Again, how was that even
Bobby, Tan, and Jonathan simultaneously stop to clutch at each other, squealing. They talk over each other, overly excited: “Oh my God, they’re living together!” “How do I look?!” “I wanna touch his gorgeous hair!!!”
“I like you”, he finally said, almost casually. Sherlock tensed, only for a split second, until he relaxed again. It came as a small shock, this open expression of sentiment, not that he didn’t… know. It just wasn’t something they usually said.
In that moment, Mycroft saw a glimpse of the little boy that was still hiding somewhere deep inside the heart of the extraordinary man he grew up to be. His heart grew three sizes.
" his brother's voice breathed into his ear, sickly close and real and Sherlock suddenly wished he was at home. He never once in his colorful career felt the urge to escape from a crime scene, but right now he wanted to go home and crawl under a blanket and kill the memory of himself humiliatingly clunging to his brother for support. A wave of nausea hit him and the last thing he registered before he escaped out of the room was Lestrade’s voice, filled to the brim with worry, asking him if he was alright (he wasn't, he felt sick).
Lestrade ordered Donovan and Anderson to continue their work instead of standing and staring. Although they obliged, John could still hear a comment whispered under a breath; a comment about questionable methods of raising children between crime scenes and dangerous experiments. He tried in earnest to ignore it.
John felt his face fall and tried his best to mask the growing uneasiness making him nauseous.  He put on a pained smile when Lestrade approached him, eyes never leaving the now delighted giggling Rosie who was scooped up in his partner’s arms.
and they did…. Things. And then he didn’t want to kiss him anymore and why, God why was this sentiment business so chaotic? He couldn’t
"Detach" he ordered gently once the door was closed. Sherlock gave him an adorably horrified look at the idea of ever letting his hand go.
How silly to think that some clothes could brighten his self-perception so drastically, but then again, he even smiled at himself in the mirror this morning; despite the belly and the grey hair and the dark circles around his eyes.
It was the moments where John asked himself if he loved Sherlock. Of course, he loved him, as a best friend, but somehow this status sometimes didn't feel like it was enough. After all, he had so many things to be thankful for, and if any other person evoked this amount of feelings in him he wouldn't have hesitated to take the relationship to the next level. But Sherlock wasn't any other person. Sherlock was different, so different and innocent in his own way, that John couldn't risc the fragile bond by rushing into things.
John clears his throat. “Well, it’s Rosie’s second birthday. And since her first one kind of… fell under the radar (of murder and grief and so much bullshit. He doesn’t say that, but he has the sinking suspicion that these guys already know anyway. Still. Doesn’t mean he has to
“I’m sure Sherlock will love it, too,” Tan remarks with an air of pretense nonchalance, when they’re back in the car. He doesn’t miss the slight flush John quickly tries to hide under his collar and smirks to himself.
As always, kudos, comments and bookmarks make my day <3 Thank you guys so much for reading and giving me feedback, I'm so glad you like the story <3
He gets it because he knows this look so well, and he knows how this look feels like. He’s no stranger to self-doubt and has, over the years, become attuned to it when Sherlock allowed him to glimpse past his armor of arrogance and intellect.
“You have no idea how much this means to me” John murmured against Sherlock’s stomach, tightening his secure grip around the detective’s waist. “God Sherlock…” he trailed off.
Sherlock’s first instinct was to stay right where he was. The bruise on his jaw still covered most of the area, obscenely darkened in different shades of purple and yellow. Lestrade had expressed concern he first time he saw Sherlock on a case three days before- without John, was the doctor seemed to spend more time at the surgery (probably to spend less time with Sherlock)- but was unable to get the detective to talk to him. Sherlock kind of wished he would have been able to let the DI in on the true reason behind the bruise and John’s absence, maybe ask him what to
“He is sulking, I’m presuming?” He motioned to Sherlock’s closed bedroom door with his teacup. Glad to have a conversation starter, John latched right in: “He’s in a mood”
“John?” the whisper was low and breathy, nothing more than a quiet sigh, but he’d be damned if he didn’t notice the vulnerability and trust Sherlock allowed himself to display. It warmed John’s heart – and something stirred in him that he didn’t allow to surface for a very long time. There they were again, the wonderful feelings of attraction and sentiment towards this wonder of a man, and finally John realized what he had so easily missed before: He wasn’t the only one who was (did he dare to think it?)
“Speaking of Holmes brothers, how did you get Mycroft to agree to this trip, anyway? I mean-“ John risked a glance at the backseat, but Sherlock was way too occupied to demonstrate the flight pattern of the common robin to listen in on their conversation- “I got this one with the promise of soil samples and leave patterns. But Mycroft? He doesn’t strike me as the nature type.”
He started giggling, and the vice around Sherlock’s organs loosened. He shrugged, a little helpless with interpreting manic giggles as an answer.
When John finished brewing the detective's favorite blend, he entered the living room to find a very disorientated-looking Sherlock draped in his chair. He looked strangely out of place, all long limps in a dressing gown, and tousled hair, and wide eyes. He seemed startled by the soft sound of a mug colliding with the wooden surface of their table. It would take a piece of work to get Sherlock fully back to normal, John then realized. But he was up for the challenge, because he knew that Sherlock needed him to. The detective had lost control and his vulnerable side surfaced, so he needed someone to rely on; someone to help him figure this new situation out; someone like John.
Sure, he was known for a short fuse and ticked off relatively easy because of seemingly little things (‘I swear to God, Sherlock, the self-checkout counter
'Sherlock Holmes doesn’t do nightmares my ass' John thought, as he had already figured out the real motivation behind the unusual request. Sherlock was afraid of nightly terrors. But since John was an expert on those, he took the invitation and hoped that his nearness and warmth would help to keep them at bay.
John touches the scar with his palm. He can’t see it currently because he wears his old trusty sleep t-shirt, but he knows it’s there.
John finished the pint in a hurry, guessing Sherlock had already left, and was anxious to get to talk to him.
A significant pause. After some time of consideration: “I wasn’t aware that this-“another pause, this time to think of the right way to speak his mind- “
John would listen, shaking his head fondly at the sheer dramatics of it all. Sherlock continued talking, even though Greg had joined John, asking him politely if he was free after this. John remembered that he promised himself to invent Greg out for a pint to thank him for his help when Sherlock had his breakdown, so he agreed happily.
The intensity of the gaze and the momentarily dilation of the pupils was enough to knock all the air out of John’s lungs. He suddenly didn’t feel so daring anymore. To his mortification, a blush crept slowly from his neck upwards and he would be damned if Sherlock didn’t look smug when he noticed. To save the last scraps of his pride, John did what a Watson did best in a moment of humiliation: Cover and flee.
And maybe, just maybe – John thought to himself when he waited for a taxi with his partner’s arms around his waist and his chin resting lightly on his shoulder; with his daughter’s comfortable weight in his arms and her delighted giggles in his ear about the kisses Sherlock showered her nose with – they were jealous. After all, nobody had thought (John included) that from all the people at the Yard, the sociopathic, arrogant detective and the crippled, broken army doctor were the ones who found peace in a domestic family life.
“I’m sorry” came the wet reply against his skin, voice heavy with a strong emotion that made John’s pulse pick up speed. “I’m so sorry”
When Lestrade had the suspect in cuffs, both of them were in high spirits. The chase had been tiring, but exciting, left them filled with adrenaline and a deep satisfaction. Sherlock’s head was clearer than it had been in days. A good case really solved all problems.
. The tremors stopped. His pulse didn’t quicken anymore as soon as the door of the flat closed behind him. He was better.
He searched for words to describe his confused emotional state but failed. He missed years of practice for this kind of conversation; and found to his utter horror that he was completely unprepared. Better stick with a train of thought he was familiar with:
"Sherlock" John's voiced reached him like through a veil of heavy cotton. He couldn't hear properly, white noise vibrated in his eardrums. In between was Euros, Euros laughing at him, loud and clear, while she sang that song about the East Wind. He tried to open his eyes, but the muscles wouldn't obey, he felt betrayed by his own body and trapped inside of the golden cage of his mind.  Images of Redbeard, images which seemed to betray him mocked him behind his closed eyelids ...his friend, his only friend, what was his name again?
John chewed his lower lip, while trying to pay attention to the soft, breathy crying of the subsect's mother, keeping Sherlock always in his field of vision.
“Can I give you a hug?” Antoni asks and wraps John in his arms the moment he gets consent to do so. “Usually, Karamo gets all the tear-jerking stuff, he’s going to be so jealous,” the younger man jokes to lighten the mood. John chuckles against his shoulder (he’s really getting used to all this casual physical contact and already makes plans how to incorporate it into his day-to-day life.)
He doesn’t really know whether it’s a good thing or a bloody complicated thing (considering Sherlock is Sherlock and John doesn’t even know if he’d be interested in any type of relationship whatsoever), but he has to admit it’s a thing that makes him happy thinking about.
the detective turned mid-sentence and stopped abruptly when took in the sight of a very concerned-looking DI kneeling next to a very miserable-looking doctor. All his pompous air left him at an instant.
John let him, welcomed the attention from his favourite consulting detective in the whole wide world.
Sherlock nodded soberly, pressing the heels of his hands against his eyes tightly. “I’m messing everything up”
Although they had known each other so long, this romantic entanglement was still so incredibly new, so incredibly fragile. There was hardly a day where John didn’t discover a new side of this madman; a man he never knew could be so caring, and loving; so attentive and sweet; so vulnerable and shy. It was a miracle that Sherlock decided to let John in, to show him all the wonders carefully hidden under layers of arrogance and deductions. Wonderful, brilliant, amazing Sherlock. Choose him, old, ordinary, broken John Watson. What a waste.
John, probably already halfway under the soothing sprinkles of water in his mind (a thought Sherlock definitely
John realizes that now, he thinks more about his own feelings than he had in actual years. And talks more about them, too. He had always lived by the mantra that it was no use to bother others with his own insecurity and vulnerability. That he had to be the strong one, always, because somebody had to be.
Or maybe my husband is up tending the baby.  “Is John John alright?” I ask, my voice husky with sleep.
“I’m going with you,” Andi shouted back, clasping her arms around his midsection. “You’re going to need a wingman; you can’t take this on by yourself. Now get going. You’re wasting time.”
Her hands stilled on the apron, lips parting in surprise until she found her voice. “Sherlock! Oh my lord! Come here, boy,” she said, dropping her apron and waving him to her. “Let me see you! It has been too long, it has been that. And who tis this ‘Dame’? Never have I known you to be so formal, no need to start today. Now, come here.” A smile spread across her face as she opened her arms to be filled by the “boy”.
Sherlock’s gaze strayed to the door that still had not moved, and quickly shifted his attention back to Colin, daring him to say something.
Books. Books about plants. Books about architecture. Torrid romance novels. Tutorials on sculpting. Claustrophobic stacks of magazines featuring everything from cats to fashion to travel to veganism, to…ah, who could have guessed… plants.
One more time she reads the note she found in the chair sitting by the bed.  It is in Pere’s hand.  No longer the elegant script she once knew, it was written by someone who was longer steady.
“Since you be headed to London as well, will you be traveling with us?  No time for sleep, but you will be safer than if you go alone.”
Rolling his sleeve up, John dipped his elbow into the water.  “It be just right; it will feel good.  Now come on, get in; thou be shivering.”
I smile at him broadly.  And lie.  I feel only the smallest pang of remorse for doing so, after all, what I am doing is for his own good.
wanted to do?’  I’m not complaining; Katie is a blessing and there is no other way I would have wanted to spend my life, but I can’t help think
But this time the lie was not about nearly blinding myself last Tuesday when the beaker of acid exploded.  Or how I am going to use him as a test subject for my new experiment.
“Sherlock, he’s a, well..he calls himself a Consulting Detective.  He works with me at Scotland Yard on a freelance basis.  Right brilliant fellow, but he’s been a bit off his game lately so he uses cocaine once in a while to try to get the juices flowing again.  It’s never gotten in the way before, not until the last few months or so.”
No, it didn’t bother John that Sherlock sent the picture.  What annoyed him was what Sherlock wanted him to do- attend Scotland Yard’s Annual Vicars and Tarts Orphan’s Ball.  Even though the event was for a worthy cause, the doctor was not one to dress in costume.  Certainly not in a vicar’s outfit wearing one of those ridiculous headpieces.
The cab began to spin, so fiercely that it stole the rest of his words. Sherlock threw out his hands, bracing himself against the violent motion, but it was the centrifugal force that held him in his seat. He peered out the window at nothing but blackness. And from outside the cab, Sherlock heard a high-pitched screech that grew louder and louder and, a moment before it became unbearable, the cab hit something beneath them and stopped moving.
mine.  And because with just one look he tells me I am everything he ever wanted.  Because, even after all this time, with one touch he tells me I am all he needs to make his life complete.  Because with one gently spoken word, be it ‘love’ or ‘sweetheart’ or ‘honey’, he tells me there is no one he treasures more.  And that he can do this with Katie, JJ, Jacob, and Jennifer, too, making us each feel we are most valued?  How can one not revere such a man?
I sit back as the vehicle chugs into the night, giving him time to settle. Sherlock faces out the window, as much, I imagine, to shut me out as to reflect on what happened in the flat. And as important as it is for him to reflect on and digest the unexpected intimacy of our kiss, I have a limited time with him and must get to work.
go alone? Did you talk regularly to anyone while you were there, take anyone home? Did you drink? Of course, you did; what am I thinking. What did you drink? Was there a change in staffing right before you were, well, right before we met? What am I missing?”
I take it back from him, perching it between my fingers.  “It says ‘Every minute of every day’.  That is how often I love you, John, and promise to for as long as I am alive.”
“Thou be—thou be the—devil incarnate.”  But John could not help from angling deeper into Sherlock’s mouth, desperate for more. Desperate to make it stop before he burst.
“I brought you … what you requested and your laptop. I’ll just hang the bag on this latch where you can reach it.” Sherlock approached the bed cautiously, prepared to, at any juncture, be told to bugger off, but there was no indication that John heard what he said.
“Tell your goons to release me,” Sherlock said, his delivery falling short of a full bellow. It didn’t seem to be from lack of effort; he just didn’t have the oomph.
At first John is as befuddled as everyone else. His words tell me, “We’re in the middle of an interview, Sherlock…” but his eyes say he would rather be anywhere other than here.
Dropping her container to the floor, she patted her hand to her chest. “Oh, Dear!  Oh, my,” she flustered.  “I knew you wouldn’t be able to stay away.  I don’t know how many times I’ve told Sherlock that very thing.  ‘We haven’t seen the last of John Watson’, I’d say, but you know him, once he gets something in his head there’s no persuading him.”   She tsked in disapproval at Sherlock’s obstinance.
"John, I know you are not the most luminous of people, but even you should know what I'm doing," Sherlock huskily reprimanded.
been talking about taking a trip, reviewing travel brochures for tropical locations.  He says it is to start working on his ‘bucket list’.  I do not recall a romantic getaway with a lover other than me being on that list, but then, I have not seen the complete list.
” John said mischievously.  With a burst of vigor, he swiveled around, leaving the bed from the far side.  Leaning down, he put his hands on the edge of it.  “Get thy pretty arse over here and help me; we need to move this so no one comes in.”
“Did this Gareth ask about me? Did he follow Eduard?” Sherlock drew nearer to Cedric, every sense focused on the squire.
John stands there holding his bag, his mystification at the sudden turn of events evolving into a stifled smile.
Simon pushed his way through the crush of passengers to the middle of the Tube carriage, headed for the lone, miraculously open, seat. Clasping the folded newspaper to his body, he ducked underneath the arm of the woman steadying herself with the support bar and slinked into the seat.
Hearing Sherlock root through the box of odds and ends on the table—a bee corpse, an owl talon, a cigar stub that Sherlock had discovered in a nineteenth century coffin, and whatever other small objects Sherlock deemed too “valuable” to dispose of—John was surprised that Sherlock actually found something useful. A paperclip. Used to attach the note directly over the article John was absorbed in.
“Simon’s here.” Andi’s response was sharp; she hadn’t time for niceties. And whipping the scarf from its owner, Andi wrapped it haphazardly around Rose’s head, covering the dog’s eyes.
For a time John stayed and watched Sherlock as he slept, the hand in his now relaxed in sleep.  He didn’t want to let go.  But he had no choice.
“I signed up for two years,” he replied, for the first time feeling the heavy weight of remaining abroad for another year.  It might as well have been a lifetime.
ou.”  When Aldus had asked why he called Sherlock “Eely,” a quick lie had formed on his tongue. “He looks like an eel, do you not think?  All long and thin and squirmy?”  Since then, Aldus called Sherlock “Eely,” unbeknownst to him telling Sherlock he loved him.    Sherlock was not amused.
By the time I am once again upright, John has propped himself up on his elbow, with a smile on his face that says he is entirely too pleased with himself.
Just as distressing as the fact that I did not speak to or touch John those three days was the fact I had broken my wedding vows;  I had vowed to every day show him how much I love him.  That I did not do, and I was ashamed.  Ashamed it took me three days to apologise and ask him what
Heaving himself upright, Sherlock put the phone on the table—text unsent—and drooped back onto the bed.
I go back into our bedroom and pulling the sheets up, lie on top of them, using the duvet and the blankets from the chair as my cover.  As tired as I am, I cannot sleep, my mind will not stop.  No matter how I lie, arranging myself in every configuration imaginable, I cannot find a comfortable position.  But it is not the comfort of my body that eludes me; John is not here.  He is my comfort now.  I put his pillow under my head, breathing in the scent of him, but it is not enough.  This is
“You do?”  I know Sherlock loves me, but ‘can’t live without’ me?  That seems to stretch it a bit; Sherlock’s one of the most independent people I know.  I didn’t think he
John had shrugged. “It’s not about the drinking. Sometimes, it helps to be around people even if you don’t want to talk.”
Not until his eyes rested on the roof of the building opposite them, the one he and John had scaled.
John doubled over, clasping his knees. Battling for breath. As hard as it was to tell Sherlock goodbye in a letter (
Thankfully, in my bachelor years, I could ignore the yearly fiasco, begging off familial, and the rare social, invitations. “No, I shall not be able to attend; Scotland Yard requires my assistance.  Grizzly murder, you know.  So sorry.”  Even the times John would come from his flat downstairs and knock on the door, “Come on, Sherlock, join Katie and me.  We’re having turkey and plum pudding…” he would say, appealing to my sweet tooth, but I would beg off with a cold (“How many bloody Christmases in a row can you have a cold?   Eh, Sherlock?!”) or a case (“Won’t work, Sherlock.  Won’t work.  Greg is in my flat right now.  Now get your arse downstairs!”).
What kind of spell has this man cast on me?! I do not believe in witches or spirits, yet what other explanation can there be?
His silent pleas ignored, Sherlock climbed the stairs to retrieve his laptop, pausing at the second-flooring landing. Debating whether to knock at Andi’s door. He decided against it. What more was there for her to say?
John, and I do not think I will ever figure you out.  What a wonderful life it will be trying to do so.
He looked across the camp at Sir John and Aldus saddling the horses, attaching the cart.  Judged the distance between them and the tents; Sir John and Aldus be not so far that they would not hear a cry for help.
The frown that had been pinching Sherlock’s face evaporated, leaving him expressionless. Whisking off his scarf and then his coat, with more care than usual, Sherlock draped them over the back of John’s chair. “John, I—whatever I’ve done, you needn’t take such a drastic step as to leave. I assure you, I never meant—”
Sherlock. Sherlock would tell him. John wasn’t keen on approaching the subject again with him after the disastrous turn the last conversation took, but he felt in his gut that Sherlock knew everything that was going on.
his priority’. And maybe throw in some corny joke about how the British Government wouldn’t be very amused when his little brother endangered the Queen by having a family weekend. Instead he chewed on his lower lip. Eyed Rosie laughing so carelessly. Sherlock smiling so brightly. Sherlock met his eyes over the crown of Rosie’s head when he gave her a kiss on the nose.
Damn John Watson, with his kind heart! Actually, hang on, more like: Damn Sherlock Holmes with his analytical brain!
Greg regarded him over the rim of his reading glasses. “Careful, young man,” he said sternly, but the twinkle in his eyes betrayed his playful nature.
John sighs fondly to himself and shakes his head at the impossible man that is Sherlock Holmes. How somebody could be so unbelievably smart and so unbelievably stupid at the same time, John would never know.
In this split of a second, Sherlock felt something he had never felt in his entire life: Regret. Technically, he knew that it had been the best possible plan. It was flawless, until the very last detail. And its success was an understatement; he had destroyed Moriaty’s web methodically and thoroughly. But- here John whimpered again, even more pitiful than the first two times- at what costs? He stood next to the bed before he even was aware that he’d been moving again.
It was a bit messy, and he dumped into several objects while he tumbled down the stairs in a dizzy haze- but he had to run, run as fast as he could to just get away. He would have run to the end of the world if it had changed a thing. The cold air burned in his lungs like fire, but he just continued running- for running was the only thing that made the voice go away- the burning in his muscles and the taste of bile in his mouth made him feel alive and
It was a tad too awkward, a tad too uncomfortable, a tad too honest; and Sherlock feared he’d crossed some sort of line, when he felt John tense up in his arms. He even prepared himself for another punch, if he was being honest with himself. It never came.
Sherlock took the invitation, and studied him intensely, though without his usual heat, for some minutes. At last, his eyebrows shot up, and his mouth quirked, as if he tried to conceal a sneer and was doing a dreadful job at it.
"Stop" Sherlock whimpered, begging his mind to cease the torture. But Euros sang, and sang and dead eyes smiled at him and he still couldn't remember the damn NAME (his knees scraped the ground, sharp stones ripped open his trouser legs. When did he kneel?) Still he couldn't open his eyes, he couldn't get OUT. Panic caught him like a powerful wave and for the first time in thirty years, the great Sherlock Holmes felt utterly terrified.
‘Robbery. No blood, no corpses, no danger. - SH’ John frowned at his screen, for he really disliked it when Sherlock deduced him via text message. He wasn’t that predictable, now was he? ‘The victims rabbit has kits. Rosie will like them. – SH’
“I…I’m sorry I hurt you... I’m so sorry…I..I…” John kissed the crown of the younger man’s head, suddenly getting what the whole turmoil seemed to be about. He took a shaking breath
“I’m sorry” The doctor peeked through his fingers, surprised. Sherlock had never apologized to him. For nothing. Now, it seemed like this sentence couldn’t convey more meaning. “John… I... I’m so
They made their statements, with Sherlock boasting all over the place about his intellect and the incompetence of everyone else on the planet, including is eerily silent blogger/significant other of some months. Lestrade sensed the tension surrounding the ex-army doctor, but he couldn’t really blame the man; he himself was close to slapping that arrogant sneer of the consulting detectives face. Just as he was about to start with his ‘Sherlock, we don’t run off on our own when we are not armed’-lecture when the younger detective gave him a dismissive wave.
The suspect was fighting against his hold, but the doctor had him in a steady grip, displaying his superiority in strength. Adrenaline was rushing through his system, making him feel alert and giddy and so damn powerful. He had missed this. Damn, how much he had missed this.
When the first burst of excitement had subsided, John placed Sherlock gently upon the only clean stripe of their kitchen counter, and leand against him, face pressing lightly against his partner’s stomach. He breathed in the clean stench of
The real John wasn’t easy to understand, like his Mind-John was, Sherlock mused. Real John kept his thoughts and intentions private, he was an endless mystery the detective couldn’t figure out. Sometimes he would look at Sherlock like…. that. He didn’t know which emotion it contained, but its intensity never failed to make his heart flutter. Why, sentiment was a tedious thing.
He had deceived him, that he did, but was working, against everything John thought he knew about his friend, to re-gain John’s trust in such a thoughtful manner nobody had ever bothered with before. John had never been treated like this before. John had never been
It was a level of sass Sherlock didn't know John was capable of. He forgot to sulk for a moment, to let the deep affection he felt for that man in this very moment overtake him. His John was brilliant and eloquent, and even the tedious Mycroft couldn't scare him away! How lucky he was to have him in his life as his ... companion. Sherlock made a face. His thoughts were running wild this morning. This amount of sentiment in his system would most likely cause him to blackout any minute! It had to prevented at an instant.
“That irresistible charm might come in handy now, pal,” John murmured, already bracing himself for the impact of Mycroft childish (because let’s face it, the Holmes brothers were just giant kids) punch against the passenger seat.
"You don’t have to be embarassed" John tried to prove his hypothesis about Sherlock's current emotional state. "Whatever you want, it'll be fine".
John would pity him now- poor, inexperienced Sherlock gets kissed, has an orgasm, and thinks it’s love- and then he would leave. They all left in the end.
“There’ll only be one bed in the flat.” Sherlock’s voice surprises him, he must have zoned out a little (how very cliché). How Sherlock guessed that, John would never know (he sure as hell didn’t tell him), but in hindsight he should have known better. Sherlock might have deduced it from looking at Bobby’s left shoelace or something equally hysterical.
Actually, he should have seen it coming (He was Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes didn't get surprised). He didn't (Now, what an inconvenience). He was extraordinarily stubborn and annoyingly shortsighted when it came to his own reaction to sentiment. But really, something like this had never happened before. The ludicrous feelings he occasionally had to acknowledge never, never interfered with The Work. He kept them well hidden under the surface, allowing himself to face them only in the quiet moments at 221B Baker Street. He couldn't take people seeing him this raw, this
Not the important stuff, anyway (yet, John couldn’t shake the though that he might be very mistaken here).
He continued to map the expanse of his friend’s back, while said friend tried to muffle his reactions. It was endearing- never did he think Sherlock this responsive to physical touch. But here he was- drawing sighs, and shuddering breaths, and tiny mewls from him, with nothing more than a light touch.
Sherlock looked at him, really looked at him- this stubborn, brave, wonderful man- and saw the determination in his eyes, and the genuine affection radiating towards him. He tried to deduce the default in all of this but came out empty-handed. John, gentle, loving, wonderful John, really wanted to be with him. Sure, Sherlock had hoped that he would but… most of the time entertained it as a mere fantasy. The prospect that everything that happened between them had a
Somehow, she reminded John very much of Mary in this posture, which did nothing to improve his situation. ‘She would have known how to handle this’ the thought pained him and he tried to push it down, but it kept returning to the surface. ‘She would have been the right amount of stern and gentle; she would have been a good mother. What the fuck are
"John" he whispered again, voice small and teary. He didn't recognize this inflection of weakness. He wasn't used to being this flawed.
on the genius. It must have shown on his face, for Sherlock’s gaze scanned him, nervously, a little …shy, before his eyes fell on John’s lips and stayed glued there.
Bobby saves him: “On that note, let’s talk bedroom.” He wiggles his eyebrows and Jonathan “whooo”s from his lounging spot on the couch. John can’t keep the grin off his face at their implications. He doesn’t see something like that happen in the near future, but it’s a nice thought, after all.
‘If you’re amendable, I’d very much like to repay you for your troubles. Dinner sounds suitable? -MH’.
I'm overwhelmed with the positive feedback this story received by the way. You guys are AMAZING; keep those comments and kudos and bookmarks coming <3
They stayed wrapped up for some minutes in probably the weirdest embrace John Watson had ever witnessed; and certainly, the longest time he witnessed Sherlock sharing human contact while being in his right mind.
it? How could he be smiling at him, that soft crinkly smile that reached his eyes solely reserved for private moments between them, how could he smile like that? Didn’t he realize just how much was at stake? Sherlock knew, he just did, that somehow his inadequateness, his sheer oddity would drive John Watson away, and with him all that had been good in his life.
Sherlock stopped the struggling he had begun. “But-“ the tone in his voice had nothing pompous around it anymore. It was small.
Sherlock wasn't an easy person, and extraordinary (in every sense of the word); and John sometimes just couldn't belief that he somehow managed to gain the trust of this particular man. The fall had proven that Sherlock's care could hurt like a knife to the chest, but the wound healed with the notion of the very concept of said care. Sherlock normally didn't care, but John picked up the little clues that he, old, dull, throughout ordinary John Watson, managed to break the genius’s barriers. In moments like these, the feelings that John very much did and acknowledged since the fall pushed themselves forcefully to the surface.
were different. Sherlock had died. John almost got married. Sherlock came back. John didn’t marry in the end.
“How can you be so sure of that? How do you know you won’t get tired of me…. Needing you? Of… caring for me?”
After another 20 minutes of successfully talking himself into the idea, John felt confident enough to bring his plans into action. What was the worst that could happen, after all?
“Does that mean I can’t kiss my doctor in gratitude?” Jim asked with a small smile, before dropping his gaze again at John’s look, hunching his shoulders further.
John’s eyes snapped open, his mouth working soundlessly, and then he sucked in a sharp breath when Sherlock’s hand slipped inside his trousers and cupped him through his pants.
“I’m quite aware what you probably think of me, John, you don’t have to sugar-coat it,” Jim said, and though the words could have been said in anger, they were more resigned. “What sort of slag does it make me to try to put out before even the second date.” He covered his face with his hands, propping his elbows on his knees as he slouched forward. “I can call you a taxi, if you want to leave. And I won’t bother you anymore, if that’s what you want.”
, at any rate. And speaking to the family would give them both a greater idea of what was going on, so he supposed there was that. He glanced at his watch again, considering what time he’d have to leave to make it back in time for his shift at the clinic, hoping that it wouldn’t be right in the middle of a bloody chase through London again.
John nodded, knowing where the toilet was thanks to his earlier investigation, and headed that way to find the kit while Jim moved to the open kitchen area. He still wasn’t quite certain how he’d managed to find his way into Jim’s flat, only that he had taken one look at Jim’s face when he mentioned heading home and felt that fierce desire to protect the man rising again. He’d tend to Jim’s lip, maybe double-check that none of his other injuries were hurting him, and then go home. Sherlock would be worr—well, no, actually. Sherlock wouldn’t be worried because he probably didn’t even realize John wasn’t there. Again. John could just not return at all that night and Sherlock probably wouldn’t even notice.
“Our cases,” John breathed, stepping forward. The lights of the candles fluttered over his expression, turning it both soft and severe at the same time, but Sherlock knew he had done right. Good. “Sherlock, seriously, what is all this?”
John ignored him, continuing his discussion with the now bewildered doctor who came to oversee how Sherlock was doing. Information parted, he glanced at Sherlock before giving the doctor a nod and leaving the room to give them privacy.
