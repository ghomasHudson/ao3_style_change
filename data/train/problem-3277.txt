Dean ran a hand over his mouth once Cas closed the door and looked at him.  “Yeah.  Got turned around a few times, so that’s why it took so long.”
Then there are fingertips on Dean’s sternum: light and unassuming, but Dean feels them like a two-ton weight.
Dean’s mischievous grin grew a little bashful. He smiled at Cas’s chin. “That’ll work,” he said. Then he grew quiet. Thoughtful. He blinked once, then twice. “I love you too, Cas,” he murmured. His tone was solemn. “Thank you for waiting for me.”
“Dean and I are together,” Cas repeated.
He steeled himself, walked to his desk, and read it anyway. It was a photo of Sam with a glare on his face, gaze directed slightly over the camera lens. He was hunched over forms on his desk with a pen in his hand. The caption read,
“Let’s go,” Dean said, crushing the invoices in his jacket pocket.
Dean felt helpless. “Cas, please, you gotta stop crying,” he pleaded.
Cas was endorphin-high and in love.  He dropped his forehead onto Dean’s shoulder and laughed.  “Too busy making out like teenagers to notice.”
Cas indulges in a pleased smile because he knows Dean can’t see it.  He returns to the cupboard.  By the time he’s gotten the ingredients gathered, Dean has gotten the bowls and cutlery, the pot and the stirring spoon. He arranges them on the kitchen island, then steps away.
Dean didn’t know how he had any tears left in him. “Jesus. Give a guy a break,” he said, his voice cracking.
A sudden lump formed in Cas’s throat.  He shook his head.  “I don’t remember - “
But Charlie interrupted.  She seemed a little confused.  “Have you not seen each other in a while?” she asked.  “I thought that you were - uh, good friends.”
There was a slightly-too-long pause.  When Cas dared to look over, he saw a small furrow between Dean’s brow.  He blinked at the road in front of them.  “D’you mean me and Sam?  Or - just me?”
The call ended.  Dean stared at the display until it winked out and all it was was a hunk of metal sitting in his palm.  He pocketed it and turned to his door, keys in hand, trying to quell the frustration of unanswered questions.  Maybe he should call his mom back.  Or maybe he should call Cas and see if anything had changed between him and Daphne since Dean had last called.
“So what?  You’ve got an oven.  We can warm it through.”
“Yeah,” Sam croaked.  He was still crouched down, facing away from them.
Cas fidgeted a little bit, but he answered Dean steadily.  “Just for a week or two.  Maybe more.  Don’t know where I’m headed yet.  Just needed to… get away for a little bit.”
Amara swung her gun to face Cas.  “Castiel,” she purred.  “I was hoping I might use you as blackmail material if Dean proved to be uncooperative in my future plans.  But now you know too much.”
Dean just shrugs.  He’s been quiet since entering the apartment.
One of the agents glared at Dean.  “Put your guns down,” he said needlessly to the rest, who had already holstered their weapons.  One of them immediately went to comfort Ernesto.
“My answer’s the same,” Cas said, tugging Dean’s hands away from his face, revealing ruddy cheeks and wary green eyes.
When Cas stepped away, Dean sat against the windowsill and linked his hands in front of him. His gaze was fixed on the floor in front of him.
“We’ll figure something out,” Dean said, more to reassure himself than to reassure Cas.
Cas looked around as he took sips from his mug, leaning his hip against the counter. The bakery was strange in the evening: cold, eerily silent, and lit up by light that reflected on the stainless steel surfaces and made Cas’s eyes hurt. It seemed like a lonely place. The only welcoming thing about it was Dean, who was making faces after every sip of his champagne.
He intended to fix that today.  He clutched harder at Cas’s arm, moved his other hand to Cas’s waist, and pressed a little harder.  A few seconds later, when Cas tried to draw back, Dean just shook his head and leaned in again.  He felt rather than saw Cas’s amused smile, but that was okay because Cas was still kissing him back and Cas’s hands had moved to grip Dean’s hair, just tightly enough to pull a needy noise from the back of Dean’s throat.
“I like taking care of you,” Cas said firmly. “That’s not the first time I’ve said it.”
“We’ll be back after New Year’s.  Don’t know when exactly.  You - you can still join us, you know.  Grab a one-way ticket, hitch a ride back with me and Sam.”
Dean laughed.  “Good to have you back, Cas.”  And it was.
he found that his imagination had gotten all the more torturous.  If he’d gone with Dean, it would have been so easy to find a quiet corner and talk, to soak up the atmosphere, to laugh softly at drunk relatives and brush elbows and -
Dean had stayed silent, probably sulking.
The coffee that Cas slides in front of him is perfect.  So too is Cas, who sits across from Dean and pulls out his phone.  He’s probably checking his email, Dean thinks, a thought that he stifles almost immediately, because no - the Cas sitting in front of him is Dream Cas and dreams don’t have emails.  They sit there and tap away because that’s what the dreamers want them to do.
Cas shoved a paper towel in his face. “Crybaby.”
Cas had the casserole dish in his hands and was walking to the table.  “Bought them,” he said.
Cas smiled wider. “Sounds wonderful,” he said. “And you? You’re taking care of yourself?”
“I know it sounds like the world’s ending, Dean, but it’s only a mild hurricane. Minimal risk, so long as I stay put.”
Cas had said, and Dean could only conclude that he meant he refused to take part in Dean’s life.  Was that it, then?  What that the end of their friendship?  Would Cas never hug Mary again?  Would he never meet Dean’s future niece or nephew?  He couldn’t wrap his head around the concept of a life without Cas, not after 16 years, couldn’t quite comprehend the possibility of it.  But what else could he conclude?  Cas had walked away, presumably back to Daphne, presumably forward into a new life where he moved to be with Daphne and her parents and left Dean and his family behind.
“It’s been in a car for 36 hours.”
Cas felt the grip on his heart loosen.  He delivered the flowers to Chuck’s sister himself, admiring the fragile arrangement as he took the elevator up to her floor.  Her office was full of other arrangements, all in varying colors and states of decay.  She looked up from her place behind her desk when Cas entered.  A look of irritation crossed her face.
Cas held the phone away from Dean. “I didn’t say I was good at either of those things.”
“Of course,” Cas said, looking at least slightly abashed. “I just didn’t think you’d take the time to read his poetry.”
Cas looked at his outfit. He’d taken off his tie and untucked his shirt. It was creased to kingdom come, and there was a coffee stain on his torso. “What,” he said, “Tired? Overworked?”
It had been a spur-of-the-moment decision after a slow morning at the bakery. They’d been staring at each other from across the kitchen, both half-lidded, both half-dozing, Cas at his table, Dean leaning against the fridge, when Dean had said, “Yknow, I dreamed of marryin’ you last night.”
It’s not easy, but Dean eventually closes his mouth.  He’s shocked and amazed and pleased and conflicted, but mostly he feels undeserving.  Nothing about Dean has the right to make such a difference in anybody else’s life, especially not in a life like Cas’s, not even in the life of Dream Cas.
Dean groped about for something,
Cas touched Dean’s face for a brief moment. “I’m sorry to do this to you.”
“I - I didn’t agree to this,” Cas said.  “I don’t know how to play with dogs.”
“Hey, Dean!” Sam said.  He was holding an exhausted pit bull puppy in his arms.  He made room for Dean right next to him.  “We were about to call you over.”
“What I said in the bar. If we got married, I’d be good to you.”
Dean raised an eyebrow.  “Oh, yeah?  What would you regret not saying, then?”
“I’m surprised you still want my opinion,” Dean said. His tone was miffed.
This, at least Dean could answer, though heat climbed up his jaw in mortification: “You’re my best friend, Cas, but I - neither of us knew it’d be like this when we met. By the time I trusted you, we’d been friends for months and there was never a good time to…”
“Wanna come with?”
He picked up the phone and dialed Sam.  Just to see how he was doing, of course.  Not also to see what was keeping Dean from him.
A month after Winchester Bakery’s opening, Dean sent a message to the group chat. It was a photo of a number - considerably large - in Dean’s handwriting, underlined twice.
They drank.
Cas looked up at him. “I could cook another egg if you’re still hungry.”
Dean was shaking him awake by the time they arrived at Cas’s apartment building. “My singing put you to sleep or what?” Dean joked. The engine was idling, and the street light that always kept Cas up at night flickered.
“Wow, is work that bad?”
And maybe that’s why Dean had left his door a little ways open, so Cas could take that risk.
“Yeah, not to mention the thousands of dollars it’s taking from my bank account,” Dean said when Cas brought it up. He scratched his cheek and sighed wearily. “Not sure I’m gonna survive this, Cas.”
Later, after clearing Dean’s plate and loading the dishwasher, Cas gave into Dean’s groggy insistence to join him on the couch and to “bring the grape juice.”
For days, Cas successfully avoided Dean.  Dean had been moved into his new safehouse, so Cas didn’t need to worry about being cornered at home, but avoiding Dean at the office was never going to work forever.  Eventually the director asked what progress had been made on the next case and Cas had no answer for her, so he finally settled down at his desk, where Dean had been solving and resolving a Rubik’s cube for hours.
Dean squinted up at him and grabbed at the covers. “Dude, it’s cold.”
Cas heaved Dean up a little more securely against his side.  “Charlie and I met a few minutes ago,” Cas said, then to Charlie, with a deep sigh that Dean felt all along his side, “Dean is regrettably my best friend.  He is also regrettably drunk.  I am so sorry.”
Dean was looking around. “Install a TV above it, some couches around it - I might take you up on that offer.”
Dean woke up warm. Too warm. He opened his eyes - swollen with fatigue - and was met by the sight of someone’s chest rising and falling in a cotton T-shirt. That someone had their arm slung over Dean’s side in a loose embrace. Dean tilted his head up to confirm his suspicions.
Sam sighed, long and heavy. “Cas, I’m sorry my idiot brother lured you out of your office to talk to me, but I can’t take a break right now. I’m on leave next week, and I have to finish up these files before the end of the day.”
Those dreams still weigh heavy on his heart when he turns around, wiping his hands.  And when he lifts his eyes to see Cas still sitting at the table and watching him, not even bothering to pretend he wasn’t, Dean dreams of the courage he doesn’t have in real life.
“But I’m not ready.”
“Don’t do it just because you’re lonely, Cas,” Dean said.  He sounded like he was begging, and he supposed he was.  “That’s - that won’t end well for anybody.  Not for you, not for her, not for me.”
“Because of the expectation of sex?”  There was a long pause.  “That’s probably one of the reasons.”
“Fine,” Dean snapped. “But if I lose business because you broke the hearts of every teenager in town, I’m docking your pay.”
“I’ve been lying to you,” Dean confirmed softly.
The fierceness in his voice left Cas at a loss, floundering in the sincerity. He couldn’t think of anything else to do other than to do the safe thing and agree, two or three beats too late: “Okay.”
Dean couldn’t help but smile at him, helpless with affection. “I’m happy for you, Cas,” he said, just as the guests stood up to welcome the bride.
Dean closes his eyes. “Fine,” he mumbles.
Something about the way Cas said it made Dean look away.  He still doubted Charlie’s feelings, but the fact remained that Charlie had left because he’d been flirting with Gilda.  He ran a hand through his hair in frustration.  “Even if that’s true - how was I supposed to know, Cas?  I can’t read minds - “
At the end of the walk, when Cas had deposited Jack safely with Gabriel in the front row, he took his place by Dean’s side.
“Then why?”
“No, it isn’t,” Dean said, so vehemently Cas sloshed cream over the rim of his mug and looked at Dean, startled.  Dean put a hand up to steady Cas’s nerves and walked to him.  He took the creamer from Cas’s hand and put it to the side.  “Look, Cas.  What I said just now?  Dumb.  I’m your best friend, dude.  Maybe not the
Jack was five years old and came home from kindergarten with a coloring sheet of Santa. Cas looked at Dean, mouth thin. “I’m tagging you in,” he said, then left the room.
Cas waits until Dean looks at him.  “How long have you wanted to do that?” Cas murmurs breathlessly.
Cas shoves him away and scrubs his face with both hands.  “Just let me know.”
It was one small consolation in a whole big mess of dumbassery, and the longer Dean drove, the more nauseous he felt, the tighter he gripped his steering wheel. The buildings and landmarks he drove past were all reminders of what he’d written - poems about Cas’s eyes and his hands, about his kindness and his devotion, about his tea and his socks, about the one time Cas had taught Dean the difference between paisley and floral patterns in the middle of the Macy’s home department. Poems about falling in love.
He didn’t hesitate; he got up.  He was suddenly giddy with the memory of last night, of the risk he took and the reward he received.  Warmth suffused him when he remembered the way Cas’s hands had shaken when he raised them to Dean’s cheeks, the awe on Cas’s face that he was allowed to lean in and -
“I’m the speaker,” Dean confirmed. He forced himself to relax the tense fists on his knees, but the tension just migrated to his jaw, his throat, his back. He was a tangle of knots, and the longer Cas stared at him the tighter the knots became.
He doesn’t say anything, but once they get into the car and wipe down their hands with antibacterial wipes, Cas heaves a huge sigh.  Dean looks at him, and his eyes are gentle.  They don’t speak on the ride home and eventually Cas’s heart begins to calm.
Cas took it, smiling. He looked good post-makeout, Dean noted. Pink cheeks, messy hair, wide smile. How could he have waited five years to see it?
Dean’s eyes were already closed, but there was a quirk of contentment in his lips when he flung an arm over Cas’s stomach and let his head fall onto Cas’s shoulder.
Cas looked up at the ceiling. His eyes were as shiny as glass. “I understand that. But I still feel like a fool, Dean.”
Dean yelped immediately, clapping a hand against his cheek. He scowled at Cas. “You’re lucky the show’s on, or you’d regret that.”
Cas doesn’t want to spend the whole ride to the party with red cheeks so he tries valiantly to ignore the way Dean’s looking at him.  “Thanks,” he says, just to get the conversation over and done with.
Cas didn’t look surprised. He barely paused. “‘
“Neither do I,” Dean said cheerfully.  He took the dog from Eileen.  It was laughably light.  “Let’s go, Willow.”
Sam raised his eyebrows at Dean, unconvinced. “So when? When he gives Jack up? You and I both know that’s never happening.”
“Why?” Dean asked.
“I was convinced by then that I’d never be with you,” Cas explained.  “You were flirting with Gilda, and you’d… never shown me any interest.”
“Yes.” The word was out of Cas’s mouth before he could think better of it, and he could hardly regret it when Dean’s face lit up.
When he voiced this thought to Bobby over their breakfasts, the man snorted.  “That boy could never stay away from you too long.”  There was a trace of the mildest sort of affection in his voice.  When Cas raised his eyebrows, Bobby looked away.  “It’s a shame.”
Cas sighed heavily as he pushed himself away from the table. “I blame you, you know,” he said, maneuvering around Dean to take a peek in the fridge. “I’ve lowered my standards of storytelling since meeting you.”
Cas had been caught up watching the slow rise and fall of Dean’s chest; he jumped when he heard Dean speak. He took a few seconds to stammer, “I - like I said, you’d be stewing in your own fluids if I weren’t here.”
,” almost as if he’d meant it.
“That could be a tradition too.”
When he looked up, Cas was still smiling at him. Even in the darkness, his eyes were affectionate. “It’s not your apartment that makes me feel better, Dean.”
“It’ll be a nice change.  Maybe you and Sam could throw around a football again.”
Dean shrugged.  “You deserved the nap.”  His eyes were half-lidded as he looked at Cas, but his lips were upturned.  And he still hadn’t let go of Cas’s hand.
Cas grunted in his sleep when Dean answered with a hushed greeting.
“Then I
Dean’s eyes opened to flash him an faux-irritated look. “Gee, thanks?”
Cas smiled a little. He looked at Dean for an answer.
His reaction seemed to surprise Dean.  “It - it’s fine,” he stammered.
I mean, it’s not my business but he said the date went well? I guess I just want to know why my big brother’s been listening to Celine Dion unironically on Spotify.”
Dean stopped and looked down at his arms.  Three six-packs weren’t heavy.  But he looked up at Cas and saw sincerity in the downturn of his best friend’s mouth.  “Yeah, sure,” he said, and let Cas take one.  “Thanks.”
“I hated my dad,” he had eventually explained a few months later to Cas. “But he was my dad. And I didn’t know that I could be relieved he was dead and still grieve at the same time. So I just kept my mouth shut and didn’t think about it. Took me forever to even start feeling better.”
Dean grinned.  “You were mumbling something about pie a few minutes ago.”
“Lunch,” Cas said, and he was amazed he could even muster up that word with how full his heart was.
The cooler was right behind Dean, so it’s not like it was much trouble, but Dean was too preoccupied with his thoughts to care.
He called Cas when he got home.  “Couldn’t have injected a
That drew a laugh out of Cas. “Not a chance,” he said, voice thick. But he was leaning in with his blue eyes and looking at Dean like he hung the moon.
“It’s nice to see you again, Dean,” Cas replied, because it really was nice to see him. He was wearing an apron just like Cas had imagined; it was dark gray with pockets in the front to accommodate tongs and other grilling tools. Underneath the apron Cas was wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, and Cas was only a little afraid to admit that he really, really liked it.
The music doesn’t stop.
fun, right?”
Aaron spoke hesitantly.  “We - we lost touch a few years back.”
No one besides his mom called him over the next two weeks.  He received a few messages from Charlie and Sam, and one preoccupied voicemail from Cas, but Dean’s afternoons and evenings were spent browsing through Netflix unsuccessfully.  He toyed around with the idea of calling Gilda once or twice, but just thinking about smiling gave him a migraine, so his phone stayed on the coffee table.
But Dean just winks and points up toward the ceiling where the mistletoe mocks Cas and his hopeless attraction to his best friend.  “Pucker up, buddy,” Dean says, just to hammer it home.
“Cas.”  It was the first word he’d said that day, and it felt right.
Dean drove for half an hour, then half an hour more. He’d turned down the music five minutes into the drive in respect to Cas’s mood. Eventually, though, after an hour in near-silence, Cas reached forward and turned up the dial, signaling that he was ready to return to Dean. Some vaguely familiar pop song filled the silence.
Sudden sharp needles of bitter disappointment burrow into his heart.
“About Cas.”
“I’ve had 16 years to think,” Cas said against Dean’s jaw.  “I’m sure.”
“You know each other?” Dean asked at the same time Charlie did.
Eileen smiled widely.  “I’m in,” she said.
Cas kissed him, helpless in Dean’s hands. When he drew back, he said, “Just because it bears repeating: my feelings for you are unconditional. Bakery or not.”
“Ass.”
When Cas kissed him back, Dean understood Cas’s tears because he was crying too. They kissed and kissed until their kisses no longer tasted like tears.
“I appreciate that, Dean,” Cas said softly.  He cleared his throat.  “Go to bed.”
Then -
he captioned it.
“Hey,” he said.  “What are you doing?”
It was an easy enough friendship. Cas was a little odd, yes, but only in the way a four-leaf clover was odd - odd only because he was remarkable and one-of-a-kind and made Dean remember sunny days when all he saw was rain.
hair is perfect.
Cas frowns.  “You should eat.”
Ernesto was one of their custodians.  He was six months from retirement, spoke only a handful of English, and had taken in recent weeks to showing a photo of his first grandchild to anybody he came across.  He was also at this moment extremely terrified.  Cas could see his hands shaking in the air as he called out in his accent, “Yes, it’s me - Ernesto!  Please don’t shoot!”
Dean looked at the clock and covered a sudden smile with his hand when he saw that it had just passed 6:30am.
Then he turned to Dean.  Dean was so grateful for Cas’s friendship he could feel it choking him.  Cas squeezed his shoulder.  “Take care, Dean,” he said, so low Dean could feel it in his bones.  How had Dean never noticed how blue Cas’s eyes actually were?
“Dinner,” Cas says, his vocabulary greatly reduced. He wants to wrap himself up in Dean but knows there has to be a long talk beforehand, and they can’t do that when Dean’s hands are trying to inch down Cas’s waistband.
By the time Dean parked the Impala, he’d been gone for 90 minutes. He wasted five more minutes staring at his apartment window from his car, and another five wasting away in front of his own door, terrified by what he might find (or not find) in his apartment.  Only when another door down the hall opened did Dean insert his key and turn the doorknob, holding his breath all the while.
Dean winced.  “Fat chance of that happening, since Cas isn’t even talking to me.”
Cas faltered. He opened his mouth but no words came out.
Cas looked at the clock.  It was edging up to 10pm.  Surely, he thought, Mary wouldn’t keep them working so late on a holiday?  He stared at his phone.  Maybe he could call Dean.
Cas could feel Sam watching him but he pretended to be heavily invested in the conversation his co-workers were having, though for the life of him he couldn’t remember the topic.
Or would that be too much?  Maybe Dean hadn’t called because he was feeling cramped.  Maybe he needed space from Cas?  The thought had Cas cringing away from his phone.
“No, I’m not,” Cas said stubbornly, though his nose was red and Dean’s thumbs were diverting his tears.  “And even if I were, look who’s talking.”
It took two hours, but they eventually managed to get the lights up.
“Hi,” Cas said.
episode that had just aired, then the second time to say, “I never got your thoughts on Campbell’s poetry.”
His phone rang.  He answered it even though he knew he shouldn’t, but it was Dean’s name on the screen and Cas had never ignored Dean’s calls.
he lie about his affection for Cas? Why would he lie to Cas, period?
Director Shurley put the flowers next to her computer and surveyed it.  “I have no doubt,” she said, almost absentmindedly.  Then she looked up at Cas and smiled.  “Thank you for the delivery.”
The wedding and reception of Sam and Eileen Winchester took place outdoors.  It was late spring, and the venue, an obscenely-priced private garden two hours from Dean’s home, had become a little too warm for Dean’s liking.  He wanted to loosen his tie, but he knew that if his mother caught him, she would haul him back inside and fix it for him like he was 9 again, trying to skip out on some distant relative’s funeral service.
Cas was suspicious as soon as he saw Sam at his office door with a wide smile.
Dean didn’t answer, and Cas tried his best not to read too much into his silence.
Cas doesn’t respond.  He’s staring at his glass of water.
at this shit,” he finally said out loud.  He had been so confident setting out.
Down the hallway, they heard the elevator doors start to slide open.  Cas was momentarily distracted, and Dean took advantage: he yanked Cas into the office by his sleeve, closed the door, and turned off the light.  Cas’s heart was a jackhammer in his chest: whoever they were hiding from definitely would have either heard the door close or seen the light.  Either way, Cas was trapped, hiding behind a desk with a felon in the office of the director of the FBI, and Cas wasn’t actively trying to apprehend or disarm the felon.  He would either be fired or dead by the end of the night, and he didn’t know which one he preferred.
Dean groaned, but he didn’t answer.  He was too busy pinching the bridge of his nose and trying to detangle the mess of thoughts in his head.  How could he have fucked up
It was easy then to persuade Dean into a hug. All Cas had to do was spread his arms and Dean was fitting himself between them with a sigh, almost relieved.
Dean chuckled.  The warmth of his breath made Cas shiver.  “We could start a tradition.”
Cas cornered him at the reception, where Dean was lurking at the edges of the dance floor. “Can we talk?” he said, leaning in to be heard over the music.
Aaron opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “I’ll say,” he said.
Cas smiled his thanks, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes.
“This place is way too big and way too far,” Dean cut in, almost like if he spoke fast enough Cas’s answer wouldn’t count. He fished his keys out of his pocket.
15 minutes later, Cas was unlocking the front door of the bakery with the key Dean had given him. (“What, was I going to give it to Claire?” Dean had asked. “She’d record a Tiktok in the kitchen and set it on fire somehow.”) The kitchen lights were on, so Cas followed the light.
was the typical choice for an occasion like this, but Cas hadn’t spoken a kind word to Dean in almost 3 years.  Could he start now?
Monday was both a relief and a sharp reminder of what he’d done - a relief because it ended a long 24 hours that he’d spent with his head in his hands, trying to figure out why any thought of his conversation with Dean made him feel nauseous and sad; and a reminder of what he’d done because Sam Winchester was simply not a subtle person. At work, he’d waved at Cas once from across the lounge, then slinked out and avoided Cas’s eyes for the rest of the day. It was not a reach to conclude that Dean had told him all about his failed attempt at matchmaking.
Someone knocked on Cas’s door.
Cas held up a hand. “I understand,” he said, smiling politely. “Certain… subgenres... are unfortunately stigmatized. We can change the topic. What are your feelings about poetry?”
Dean was staring at him, cheeks blossoming pink. “Cas, you know we’re not engaged, right?”
“To tell the truth,” Cas finished.
“It’s not for another - “
“I’m just letting you know that you don’t need to let me hold you back anymore. You bought a house, and I’m proud of you. You’re one step closer to that apple pie life.”
“Well, no, but waking up at 3AM is easier when I have a hot assistant.”
Joy suffuses Dean’s veins.  He’s grinning by the time he’s at Cas’s elbow, staring down at a stack of pancakes with a distinct layer of char.  “They’re perfect,” he says, not exactly lying.
Cas looks up from his plate and catches Dean’s eye.  Dean’s suddenly nervous, though he can’t explain why.  He stands and sweeps away Cas’s plate.  He washes it and dries it and stows it away in their cabinets.
The concept was so foreign to Cas he had to shake his head a little to make the pieces fall into place. “Sorry?”
It’s only when Cas pulls away with a raised eyebrow that Dean realizes that the dripping faucet behind him has stopped.
She was.  She was tall with big eyes and curls in the brown hair she kept swept back from her face.  There was something otherworldly about her, something that reminded Dean of Cas.  She made eye contact with him as he was watching her, and the smile that spread across her face was friendly and sincere.  He’d half been expecting something predatory to come across her face, but her face remained open and happy.
Sam freezes like a kid caught-out in the candy jar. “Ma’am?”
“I know,” Cas says quietly, his gaze flickering to Dean. “I dislike it, but I will abide by Jack’s decision.”
Castiel hums thoughtfully. His pen taps against the desk. “What kind of burden would this be placing on you and Miriam?”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. “Been a long time coming. ‘Bout time I made a change.”
“Okay. Cool. Yeah.” Dean touched his neck, his fingers slipping down to his collarbones. “D’you need—help?”
They go back to being coworkers, nothing more. Just the way Dean should have let it be.
“Dean.” Cain nods, solemn, and waves him up to the front. He lines Dean’s feet up with the wood plank delineating the closest they should step toward the plywood target. He goes over the basics—hand grip, stance, technique—in clipped instructions, his broad hands nudging Dean in slight ways to correct his posture. Miriam gives a salacious smile that lights a fire in Dean’s face. He glares at her until she puts her smirk away.
“Yeah, man. It’s like good sex,” Ash says, giddy. “Everybody involved has gotta want to get down and dirty, otherwise the whole situation blows.”
“Give them back,” Sam shouts.
Bart laughs loudly, even though what Dean said really isn’t funny. “Thanks, Dean, I appreciate it.”
Dean scrambles for his laptop, arrowing his cursor straight for his calendar… which hasn’t been opened yet today, for some reason. As a result, he never received the 30- and 15-minute warning pop-ups that the meeting was coming his way.
The attention makes Val shy away her hands. She tucks into herself, shoulders rounding. “I just started a couple weeks ago,” she admits, keeping her gaze away. “My supervisor hates it, but my sister did ‘em for me as a hiring gift.” Glittery purple, her favorite color. Kari has talent for it, even if the demand around here is too slim to start a business of it. “Too dark for the dress code, I guess.”
Sighing, Castiel attempted ten minutes more of fruitless fondling before chalking up the experiment as a failure. He shut off the shower and climbed out dripping wet, his body sluicing heavy rivulets along the floor.
The boy shakes his head. “Thanks, but no.” He hesitates, then adds, “My brother hasn’t been by, has he?”
Anger licks up inside Dean, igniting the fuel in his blood. “Yeah,” he says, shaky even as he tries to smooth his voice, to clear it of all emotion. “When did Bart announce this? How long has it been making its way down through the pipes?”
The second comes no quieter.
He slept well, all things considering. The silence they have now isn’t a result of tension. They’re just quiet. Wiped clean from conversation.
“So,” Dean says, licking bruised lips. “You don’t like when I touch his biceps?”
“Yes,” Castiel says. “A paid day outside the office.”
Dean comes around the side of the table, resting his knuckles against the file. “Someone took her for two days, then gave her back. Then she goes to try and find them again?” He shakes his head. “Doesn’t make sense.”
“Me. Ours!” Anael crosses to Dean’s side of the desk. She leans over his shoulder and points down at his screen. “Right there. Web services all but says that the BEAU work orders are our fault.”
Alicia nods. “I get it. Not every day you see a resurrection. You’d think our name is Winchester or something,” she adds, winking.
Dean withdraws quickly from his cozy dozing, over-correcting his position by tipping over in the opposite direction. Cas manages to save him from the worst of it, grabbing hold of Dean’s waist and hauling him upright again.
to the people who could teach him how to do his job in the first place.
Dean nods to Patience, thanking her. He then looks sharply to Cas. “Cas, you better stay.”
?” Dean shakes his head. “What emotions do you and me and Patience have that everybody else doesn’t?”
Cas’ reaction was hidden from him, but Dean felt the joke fall flat without needing to see his face. He turned to Cas regardless, hoping to catch his eye, to show Cas in some unspoken way that he shouldn’t take his injury so seriously. Humans broke their bones all the time; Cas was no different, now. But Cas already had his head down and flashlight bowed, heading back to the car as instructed, and Dean was left feeling vaguely guilty, lingering in the rain.
“Axe,” he says, lifting one arm. “Hatchet,” he says, lifting the other. “You’ll start on the smaller one, then upgrade if you seem capable of it.
“So what kind of problems do you all encounter, occupying this same space?” Castiel asks the collective, and Pamela and Jo jump in right away about the boredom and the in-fighting, the trouble of wanting to be alone whenever the rest of their collective clamours for attention. Castiel then presses them for what solutions they would make.
Miriam hums her tentative agreement. She eyes him up and down, a playful smirk twisting the corner of her mouth. "Good thing Castiel plays doctor with you so nicely, huh?"
Stupid Castiel, thinking Dean needed to be pandered to. Treating Dean like he needed some of his patronizing encouragement to get over looking stupid in front of their bosses.
“The full-service tiers are regrettably expensive,” Castiel agreed. “But as AS is a registered medical service, we do pursue the occasional pro bono work. You could elect for us to handle your needs during this heat, if you agree to sign the necessary consent forms.”
, Dean fell asleep, thinking. Hoping that Cas would accept this booking, unlike the past couple times.
A laugh bursts loose from him, to which Dean immediately clams up, his dimples dampening the grin threatening to overwhelm his face.
Dean retches again, his arms giving out beneath him, starbursts blackening his vision. He does not indulge this weakness though, just fumbles around until he finds Cas’ arm and wrenches it across his shoulders in a slipshod fireman’s carry. He begins stumbling in the direction he begs is the right way.
Michael’s gaze is cold and unflinching, his blue eyes kniving their way through Castiel.
“I don’t need an answer tonight,” Castiel says again. “Just—think about it.”
Castiel woke Dean early and proposed that they borrow the horse. He would have suggested it earlier, but had not thought their journey would be so long. Dean had not suggested it earlier because horses were walking death traps of doom.
“If you let me go, no one will hurt you,” Dean said. “I promise.”
Castiel was in boxers in a t-shirt by the time he got back and had two glasses ready to go. He quickly poured them each a huge helping. He drank his entire glass in one go while Dean took a seat at Castiel’s small round table. He shot his own drink and poured some more.
“Arg!” he screamed, reeling with instant sharp, radiating pain.
That, there, was the reason Sam was awesome. He loved Dean, but more importantly, he trusted him. He still looked as thoroughly unconvinced as everyone else, but they’d learned over the years that when Dean was onto something, it was best to go with it.
He’d taken singing lessons since he was eight, so fortunately, that part was easy. The lessons had started as a way to cure him of his crippling stage fright, and when that utterly failed, Castiel had begged to continue them anyway. Even if he was the only one to hear himself besides his coach, he enjoyed singing and wanted to make the most of his talent.
“Keys, Dean,” Castiel said, un-fisting his hands, running them down Dean's sides, sliding them back around his hips, and grabbing Dean's ass. “Hurry.
Castiel sighed. “I know, but it’s not what I was expecting. Jesus, I put desired role as “extra”. But no, listen, you’ll never—“
Dean hadn’t even thought about it. He flexed his knee gingerly, and, feeling no pain, set his weight upon it slowly. A small twinge of pain, but nothing more.
The woman was in her 50’s with red hair that was trying hard to reach out for the humidity. She had it under control with a couple of carefully pinned clips. Her black blazer and skirt were nice, but nothing fancy, and spoke of someone who was well put together, but not pompous about it. She extended a hand to Sam.
“Cas,” Dean said, his voice as rough as if he'd just done the deepthroating. “That feels fantastic, but
Castiel sighed, and, for some reason, a shiver went down Dean’s spine.
“Because if it's a birthmark and it's shaped like a sun, then this is indeed a crazy fairy tale and maybe you should get on board with the story.”
“Then let's get a little more naked,” Dean said, sitting up and pulling at Castiel's pants.
He was dreaming of Dean, of course. Of their time together in the swamp, and then of their childhood together. How Dean could be so stubborn, and yet so full of heart. He thought of Dean's brilliant mind, his deep green eyes and adorable bow legs. He could think about Dean until there was no room left in his mind for anything else.
“Dude we’ve been in the mountains all day, you have to be starved,” Dean said.
The girl giggled as Castiel twirled her around, laughing. Sam shot him a glance from the other side of the room, raising his beer in a salute to another job well done. Kevin nodded at him from his usual place behind the mandolin. Something about sword fighting had translated to instrument play quite naturally for him.
“Yeah, but the reason I don’t want to fuck her is that
Castiel jerked, or at least tried to, when Dean’s lips met his cock again. His fingers dug into Dean’s butt cheeks, trying to ground himself, and, if the wiggles and needy little jerks were anything to go by, wasn’t succeeding.
“I knew it the moment I met you.”
“Can you tell me your name?” Dean asked gently.
“Oh, I am very aware.” Castiel’s thumb glanced over Dean’s cheekbones in a way that was both commanding and gentle. Dean shuddered. “If you’d rather fuck me, I can be amenable to that. As long as one of us is pounding into the other, I’ll be happy.”
“And he’s the one you’re doing this for, the one who found the first hair and all that?”
Two blue eyes blinked twice. “You didn’t ask. And I didn’t know you were after Gatlin.”
And you know what? It turns out no one really gave a shit. They didn’t bat an eye at him being with Cas. They’d been congratulated once or twice at the party, which was weird, but otherwise it wasn’t really a big deal. There was still his dad to tell sooner or later, of course, but he’d cross that bridge when they got there.
“Hey, wait,” Dean said, stopping dead in his tracks. “Weren't you hired to kill me?”
Dean swallows. When did he agree to this game? His cock throbs, reminding him just when and how he agreed to all this. “Cas, then. Castiel.
Castiel looked entirely too smug as he took a seat next to Dean.
A corner of Dean’s mouth ticked up. “Good for you, Sammy.”
“It was going to take your eyes out,” Castiel said. “And then pull your soul out through the sockets.”
He prepared himself, drawing his sword and assuming the stance he had learned just a few short hours earlier. The beasts were as terrifying as ever, but now that Dean had some notion of how to defend himself beyond wildly wielding a rock, he felt fortified. His lips pressed thin in determination, and as one got past Castiel’s bow, he raised the sword and slashed.
That's when Dean realized he was on a boat. There was a gentle sway originating from beneath his feet and a tinge of salt to the moist air. If he listened for it, he could hear water lapping at the boat.
There was a bang as the headboard slammed into the wall, the two lovers rolling without a concern in the world until Castiel was on top of Dean, straddling him, pelvic bone to pelvic bone. He wasted no time sucking a nipple into his mouth while thrusting down with his cock. Dean’s own rubbed alongside the silky hard flesh, pressed between their hot bodies, and he threw back his head and howled, burying his fingers tightly in Castiel’s hair.
Castiel stood up from the bed slowly but without waver, and Dean felt like he was watching a master at work. He didn't even think to interrupt as Castiel picked up his sword from the bedside table and leveled it squarely at Crowley's chest. “Drop. Your. Sword.”
She nodded and they moved to help her stand, but she pushed them away. Prideful. She probably hated that she’d needed help at all. She really could have been Dean’s little sister if he didn’t know any better.
“That will be difficult.”
There were three people on Dean now, the beasts swarming and diving. He was doing his best to hold them off while meeting volleys and blows. To Dean’s amazement, he was up to the task of defending himself, but he had no opportunity to properly attack. He’d need help or he would die.
“You look amazing in this.” Dean’s fingers danced to Castiel’s fly and began to undo it. “I want to leave it on you a bit longer.” He began to lower to his knees as he reached inside. “While I do this.”
He crashed their mouth’s together, licking past Castiel’s lips without a pause. Cas groaned in response, thrusting forward and grinding into Dean with one long, fluid motion.
He would have to wait for the explanation though, for at that moment, the door to his room banged open loudly and Crowley slammed it behind himself. He made it halfway into the room before looking up and halting.
hard.”
Dean laughed, took Castiel’s hand in his own, and did just that.  They didn’t have anything they needed to have sex properly, but neither one cared. Dean crawled over Cas and kissed him senseless, pulling them both out of their britches to grind against each other unhurriedly, and, what seemed like hours later, both came with stuttering breath and whispered endearment.
“This is working,” Castiel said, panting gently. “Mind running
“Not that I’m not glad you two have made up and are already back to shameless flirting, but I have one more question,” Sam said. “Do you have any idea how you know who is being targeted? Are they connected somehow?”
and sure enough, at the first
“Castiel,” he finally said, rolling it around on his tongue.
“Dean,” Castiel warns, pinching his nipple.
“What?” Castiel asked. “I thought we’d dance some more and this seemed appropriate.”
He let one shoulder raise in a shrug. “Seriously. I wasn’t interested in anyone romantically at the time.” Not strictly true, there were a few guys that had caught his eye, but since that wasn’t going to happen, it didn’t matter.
Charlie snickered.
Sam rolled his eyes, but nonetheless leaned over to watch Castiel approach. “He’s cute,” Sam admitted. “And scared.” Sure enough, Cas was wringing his hands and his breathing was visibly stilted. If someone had said ‘boo’ he’d probably fall over.
“Why is it so hard for you to believe I’m telling you the truth?” Dean asked. “I thought you’d be most thrilled, he’s
The point was, this was nowhere near as fun as he'd hoped being bound with rope would be.
Cas leaned back from the table and bit his lip.
“Hello, darling,” he said with a distinct accent as he approached. “Are you Dean Winchester?”
Dean was flying apart at the seams. Which was ridiculous really, he’d been given plenty of blow jobs in his life. But this was completely different. It was too much, far too much, and yet, not enough. He needed more, needed Cas, needed everything he couldn’t give words to.
“Because if you're not him, he's going to be disappointed when I run off with you.”
“Caressing my hand like that. What game are you playing?”
"Yes," Dean gasps, "Yes, yes, god’s yes, fuck me Cas-"
One second he was on solid ground, and the next he was in a dry, gritty pit of sand, in over his head, and sinking deeper.
“I could,” Kevin replied. “I've got some spare rope up here, but I didn't think you would accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.”
She sipped hers primly, enjoying the drink. She waited until he had drunk and proclaimed her wrong before she started to laugh.
“You can't ask him,” Sam supplied from the corner of the room where he was lounging. “He's dead.” What part of that were these people not getting?
“It’s dated and worn down.”
“I told you before that the man we found outside Droplet Falls had been targeted,” Castiel began to explain. “I should add that those demons will
They’d been waylaid in heading upstairs by Sam, who had wanted to ask Cas the rather awkward question of why he didn’t have blonde hair. From what Dean had told Castiel earlier, he’d guessed that Mary had just enough warning of her imminent death to try to protect the infant by casting a spell to permanently change his hair and eye color.
“Looks like we’re too late for one of you,” Jody says, angling her coffee tray toward Dean.
The front room is empty, the kitchenette too. Dean calls out and the bathroom door slides open, revealing Patience, her hoodie pinched over her nose. She looks shaky and uneven, leaning heavily against the door jamb.
, among other sickening things. Dean nods at his fellow retreat couples as they walk by, who all seem equally amorous with their partners, holding hands and giving gooey grins at each other.
The next couple weeks of work pass in a mindless blur.
Castiel withdraws the plate at the last second, sending Dean into despair. “Move to the living room, if that’s okay.” He motions with his chin. “Grab the forks and napkins as you go.”
Max quirks a brow. “Cute, country boy. Now be useful and lead the way.”
of it chokes off lungs, stifles his breathing. His chest spasms, seizing his rib cage closed, crushing everything within him until he’s cold and still and the worst of his emotions are contained.
she’s biting back. He nods to her, his brows lifted with contrition, the best he can do to say that he’s sorry for that too.
In the comedown, Castiel settled heavily atop Dean, planting his brow against Dean’s neck to avoid his gaze. Castiel didn’t want to think about what would come next. How Dean would find a way to render what they did in terms less meaningful than they were.
“So no frenching,” Inias asks Miriam. “Does that mean you actually kissed?”
Castiel winces, head tilted askew. “Mostly, it isn’t. But there is something important I wanted to discuss with you.”
Dean follows Castiel into the elevator, the both of them settling in beside each other, backs to the far wall. He clicks his tongue with sympathy. “That’s rough. But I thought your brother, he got you the—uh—” His hand waves out at the legacy floor before he can stop himself from cramming his whole foot into his mouth.
“Looks good,” Dean says as the supper plates are brought out, the servers noting each attendees name tag color to verify which dish goes where. He gets the same steak plate that Garth does, except Garth’s is raw while his is medium rare. Dean watches from the corner of his eye as more than one server stops by Cas’s seat, stares at his name tag, and gives up, moving on to the next empty table.
"Okay. Cool." Dean nods. He feels like his fever is back again, with how his face is heating up. He clears his throat, motions backward with his head. "C'mon, then. Let's... go."
Still, despite Dean’s pronouncement that he doesn’t want them, Castiel manages to convince him to take home a bundle of daisies, if only because one of Dean’s misguided coworkers bought him an
Cas stands motionless. He grumbles something before abruptly storming away. Dean looks to his brother, uncomprehending.
The sound of splitting wood grows closer the further he walks, until Dean pushes aside a branch on the path and steps out into a clearing green. There he finds Castiel standing amid a haphazard wood pile, the grass at his feet scattered with half-hewn logs. He lifts an axe above his head and carries it down in a swift arc, slicing cleanly through the wood block standing on end atop a thick tree stump.
Dean glances over, finds Sam’s expression translates somewhere between
Every opportunity that Castiel has dared broach the subject, Bart assures him that he’s not actual management, and that he answers only to systems management, or occasionally to Adler, should a developer’s opinion be required. The rest of his team—the QA and developers, even
His snivelling smile liquidates Dean’s legs, freezing him in place. Dean takes a suckerpunch and falls square over, only Alistair’s grip on the front of his shirt keeping him from hitting the ground.
“The first night,” Castiel says in a rush. He takes a deep breath. “Don’t worry, I wasn’t involved in the, uh”—his hand makes a funny gesture, his mouth set in a grim line—“undressing. You took care of that yourself.”
Castiel fidgets with the bag of his belongings. He winds the belt into lazy loops in his hands, thinking without really thinking.
“Watch for Dijwar while we leave,” she instructs Dean, motioning her chin toward the dark clouds rolling in on the endless horizon. “It will take some effort for us to wake with this.”
Dean squares his shoulders and bows elaborately toward Claire. “Lead the way.”
“She just… stays like this,” Miriam says, frowning at the human, huddled alone in a dark room without doors or windows. “She doesn’t eat, doesn’t sleep. She longs for her friends to come find her, but she has no way of letting them in.”
“Burn the bunker down.”
It was a strange liminal space between them, the silence and separation between their bodies broken by the soft noises made from skin on skin. Dean’s pace began to quicken, and Castiel found himself lagging behind, the hardness of his cock seemingly unready for the heat that Dean was bringing his own.
“How curious a thing,” the djinn says, “your Castiel is.”
So sue him. He likes his hectic little corner of the company. He’d rather keep legacy as-is, rather not see Castiel leave it. Rather keep the project that he and Cas have made rolling a little while longer. Together.
Once at his apartment, Dean wastes little time shucking off his work clothes. The shower spurts on, warming up while he frets his way through his wardrobe. His regular off-hours t-shirts and plaids feel too informal for the evening. Dean settles for a sage green henley and jeans, and pulls out his worn leather coat to wear atop it, the single shirt a little naked for his usual wear.
That sets the girls off on further reprimands, their shouts filled indiscriminately with
He then switches over to a search browser, opening links for the first ten job posting sites given in its results.
For a brief moment, the world was silent once again.
, Max. She was
“Who’s talking barbeque?” Max asks, glancing between everyone.
Castiel jolts and, cursing, struggles to regain equilibrium. A hand plants roughly beside Dean on the desk. With his other, he guides Dean’s head back to where it was, cradled gently beside the column of his throat.
He blames this upward cant of his head as the reason why he finds Cas at all, his inattention resulting in him tripping over Cas’ body and sending Dean splaying. Dean catches himself roughly on one knee, saving himself from the full-body faceplant he was destined to make.
All these weeks he’s been left wondering where they stand, but if Cas is asking him over—hell, if he’s cooking Dean supper—then surely they’re still in good standing. Maybe enough time has passed for Castiel to feel good about work again, and if he’s happy about work then maybe he might be ready for—
Cas hasn’t moved so far as Dean can tell. He sleeps with his arms still folded across his torso, his mouth twitching through each labored rise and fall of his chest. Dean waits with his breath held until he can hear Cas’ soft, shuffling breathing, the rasp of his lungs coming slow through the dark.
Cas looks over to him from the front dash, Dean can feel it, he can sense the pull of Cas’ gaze upon him. Biting his tongue, Dean keeps his mouth shut and his eyes on the road. He already knows better than to let his nerves get the better of him. He never should have tried to pin Cas down with promises to stay. Never should have shown how badly he needs Cas to tell him that he will.
Every fiber in his being refuses to stay away.
“It’s insane!” Miriam thumps back into her chair, her hands engulfing her temples. “Axe throwing,” she murmurs again to herself.
“Holy shit,” Dean groans, toes curling. This really was turning out to be the best night of his life.
Dean laughs in spite of himself. “You’re so fucking cute when you’re mad.”
Sam hunkers down to Dean’s height. Blessedly, he doesn’t try to touch him. But Dean can sense the greater questions that are now coming with his brother’s attention:
Dean grabs a chair from around the table, lunges forward while throwing it at them. A djinn takes the direct hit, stumbles back in surprise. Dean uses the momentum to close ranks, grabbing someone’s scimitar arm and twisting, getting in close enough to gut his knife up between the djinn’s heaving ribs.
“Good, good,” Bart says absently. “Listen, how busy are you, really? Do you need your whole team to keep on top of things?”
“Yeah. But he was kinda—He was our kid too.” Dean picks at his hands. “After mom died, we—” He exhales, hard. “We argued about how to handle him.”
Cas awkwardly sticks out his arm. “Castiel,” he says, nodding.
Ah. Rage, then.
Dean forces himself to be still and steady, his touch light as he curves an arm around Cas, his throat working dry as he returns Cas’ mumbled goodnight.
With a nod, an angel offside ushers Pamela and Ash outside the room, and Castiel’s interviews proceed with the entry of the next humans.
But Castiel has such endless patience for him. “Yes. For a long time.”
“Wait, they walk? No getaway car? Nobody chased them down?”
Cas emerged from the dust cloud, the tips of his hair frosted white with powdered concrete. “I took care of the wall. We need a shovel to clear the rest of the way.”
“I didn’t have the chance to grab your preferred burgers and pie,” Castiel said, seemingly apologetic as he stepped away from the meal. “I’ll bring them for supper, if the afternoon goes well enough that you’ll grant me to stay.”
Kurt whips around to look at Hank, the whisper hissing through his teeth. “More strangers,” he says. “Cops, too.”
“Oh,” Dean says, turning cold. He knew better than to get his hopes up, but they had still gotten away from him for just a heartbeat, slipping loose from his ironclad grip. “Fuck,” he adds unceremoniously.
Castiel shrugs. He leans into Dean’s hand, cups it with his own. “Tomorrow.”
When Dean reopened his eyes, he lay on his side among his nest of pillows. An arm draped heavily across his waist.
“Mm. Yours.”
. Just so Raph knows how often they stand up and grab a coffee, apparently. Or so he can gather evidence that the company is wasting time maintaining legacy, as he likely already suspects.
The door to the motel room rattled, keys turning in a lock. Castiel hastily pulled up his trousers, zipping and fitting his belt buckle back into place. It was only once Dean had stepped inside the room that the moaning television became more than an afterthought.
Dean snaps his fingers. “They were heading south along Broadway. What’re the odds it was taking them out of the city?”
Dean stops at the watering hole to grab a coffee, mostly because he sees Anael is busy doing the same. If Hannah is their best connection to the other projects, then Anael is their best source for gossip on upper management.
Dean nods. “Clocking my hours for it at any rate. Always liked working on cars, and working with my hands. Spent decades maintaining a family heirloom, and, uh. It’s good. To finally have an excuse to do it for pay.”
Dean runs a rough hand over Cas’ scalp, setting loose the wild waves of his dark hair. He murmurs praise at the way Cas comes apart above him, his own orgasm building as Cas drives himself toward release.
“Pyjamas, Garth,” Dean grits out. “D’you have a spare.”
Maggie must read her tension, despite how Ryan’s trying to hide it. Her smile softens, becomes something almost encouraging. “You could probably take a couple hunts too, if you wanted to. I could ask Sam if there’s something we could work together—”
“So if Pamela wants to touch me,” Castiel says, “and I don’t want her to…”
The Empty is supposed to be peaceful, isn’t it? Not like Hell, or even like Heaven. Dean hooks his thoughts into that distraction, trying to remember what Cas had said about it after his last resurrection. But his mind comes up frustratingly blank.
A cold sweat breaks out along Castiel’s back, precursor to the uneasy revelation building in the back of his mind. He touches his fingers to his belly, tender and full of stitches. He summons his powers. Or tries to; warmth rises in his palm, and nothing more.
But Dean merely ran a limp hand up Castiel’s back, his palm rubbing slow circles as it slid back down. Castiel clutched at Dean’s shirt, afraid of what might follow, but Dean merely held him until Castiel felt foolish for attempting to hide in this way.
Dean swings his legs over the side of the bed, and relinquishes his grip on the blue comforter when he spies a bathrobe nearby, fluffy and freshly washed, that he pulls on to keep warm. He ties the knot loosely around his stomach and, stuffing a water bottle into the robe’s pocket for good measure, goes to see where the door leads beyond the hallway.
Dean fights down the instinct to flinch, knowing that odds are Sam already heard how he answered Mary’s call, that he’s been privy to years of the mewling desperation that creeps through Dean the moment he thinks Cas might be near.
Dean laughs. “Point taken.”
Sam lifts his brow, expressing the same doubt that Dean feels about this exercise. Dean heaves a dramatic sigh and swipes away from the picture of Cas. As soon as the swipe happens, Sam gags and Dean instinctively throws the phone away.
Dean plays with the label of his beer. “You saying we should leave them?”
Charlie pshes, knocking the back of her hand into his chest. “Not always. Just between classes and office hours.”
Castiel pauses in his stirring. “That long?” He stares at the saucepan like he’s contemplating discarding it.
Cas steps in, shaking his head. “No. This token is better protected than the others. If it could take out an angel, it could easily harm a nephil—”
Castiel nods. “He’s in my phone. But… I don’t know who he was. To us.” Not really, anyway. Not in any way that matters.
He sees her mouth gape open the moment before he shuts his office door.
Dean exhales roughly. “Cas, I—”
“Huh.” Dean shakes his head. “He never said anything about it to me.”
“Hysteria and narcolepsy,” Cas confirms. “A dangerous combination. Let us know if your symptoms have changed as well.”
“At least no one looks like they want to kill you. Yet,” Cas adds, glancing around the hall. “But it will be harder to ask any guests about anything strange that may be going on.”
“But you’re around still, huh?” the girl says, shrewdly eyeing Val’s own acrylics.
Dean settles in on the bed opposite, digging through the shadows by the floor before pushing his legs into a pair of dark sweatpants. The undershirt he threw on has its collar already soaked through with shower water. Castiel wants to run his fingers through the dark spikes of Dean’s hair.
time for Cas POV 🎉
Sam exchanges a look with Dean, one that Dean breaks by stepping forward. “You’re taking hitchhikers on this trip?”
“Hey, Bitch,” Dean says distractedly, shaking out a box of noodles into a pot of boiling water. He saves the packet of powdered sauce at the last minute, plucking it out from the roiling steam, and licks his fingers to stave off any burns he got during rescue and recovery.
Ellen crosses her arms, frowning harder. “I’ll be real with you, Cas: I don’t like it. I don’t like the idea of the world nudging me away from the rough edges. I ought to be able to screw up doing what I think is best.”
From the frontage road, a white truck pulls up, its doors decaled green with proclamations of the Minnehaha County Sheriff. Jody parks and climbs out, and Patience piles out from the passenger side, followed by Alex finagling herself out from the cramped middle seat.
I’m hanging out with her for eternity. She needs to stay in her corner, me in mine, for me to be happy.”
The room succumbs to organized chaos as everyone bumps and shuffles into a half-circle around the door, jabbing elbows at each other for not muffling their laughter. Anticipation breathes through them, inhaling so deeply that even Donnie leans forward on the bar, waiting for the door to swing open.
His phone returns to his pocket, nudging his leg into Castiel’s thigh again. They sit there, overly close. Ellen Piccolo sobs in a stairwell while the soundtrack swells dramatically, accentuating her despair.
Dean’s brows are tight, gaze narrowed to the wooden table resting beneath his fingertips. He looks wrung out and empty, painted in half hues in the hazy late afternoon sunlight. Something about this place has upset him greatly.
“You were a mechanic?” Castiel’s eyes brighten, and stars above, they’re blue.
It begins.
It takes Dean a second to adjust to waking, his mind lagging behind even as his hand follows the charger cable up to the nightstand. Dean squints at the screen of his cell phone, sparing it less than a second before jamming it against his ear. “Cas?” he blurts unthinkingly.
Cas watches him, fondly. Openly—
, Dean types into the chat box.
“A garden!”
spent in his office remaining suspiciously absent from his timesheets.
Sam can sense something’s off with him. Dean senses it in Sam too, can all but hear him rifling around for the right words to say. Gently, Sam asks, “Whatever went down with Cas… Should I keep between you when he gets here?”
It’s as expected: Cas hasn’t moved from where he stands.
Cas opens his mouth to answer but Max has moved on, honing in on the paper bag gripped in his other hand. Max reaches for it and, after a brief hesitation, Cas allows him to take it.
Castiel bends to retrieve one such book, both hands used to smooth its ruffled pages.
“Jesus,” Dean murmurs, eyes tracing over the bold letters proclaiming
A small part of him rallies against it, however. A new part, slowly tended to in the years he’s patched together.
Patience calls out to them, once they’re back within earshot. She’s made herself comfortable inside the back bed of the truck, her legs crossed, picking through the remains of her curly fries. “Not fun, is it?”
“Dean,” Castiel says archly, and whoa, Dean’s never heard his name in the guy’s tone of voice before, it kinda shocks him how much he enjoys it, “how many weeks are there until playoffs?”
“Dean?”
Dean can correct Indra all he likes, but it’s not like web services or any other project really cares who they are supposed to call for information, just as long as they can get the correct answers coming in on time. After so many years of SA shake-ups happening to legacy, it sometimes feels like everyone reaches out to Dean simply because he has been here so long, and they know he can handle it; they can give him all their questions and know that Dean will answer them quicker than whoever is the fresh hire on a given day.
“I’m doing the same motions as you,” Castiel continued. “Why are you …”
Uriel sighs, undoing the button at the base of his suit jacket. He stares out at the water with an unreadable expression. Castiel longs to know his mind again.
It wasn’t ideal, going to work with his pre-heat idling in his belly. But Dean couldn’t afford to lose this mechanic job anymore than he did the jobs prior. He was just thankful that his heat had announced itself on a Friday morning, and that the worst of his symptoms had staved off the nine hours it took to survive the day, allowing Dean to escape home without his coworkers any wiser to his actual secondary presentation.
His socks kicked off, feet bare, Dean breathes a relieved sigh. He twists around, finds Cas’s position unchanged from his staring match with the wall.
He drags Dean behind the nearest building, confirming their complete privacy before he asks, without preamble, “Did you enjoy the kiss?”
His chest lurched when Cas stumbled briefly, hands raised in surrender, but Cas had taken the hint and backed out of the kitchen, and Dean was already too far away to do anything to help. He just watched as Cas swooped up the blankets from his nest on the couch—
Castiel sucks in a sharp breath.
“Not quite. I’m using a jar of sauce as a base.”
Claire paces with her cell pinned to her ear by her crooked shoulder, firing exasperated looks Dean’s way.
Sam folds his hands over his head and blows out a long breath. The moment hangs dead between them. Dean keeps his head down and finishes his burger, chewing away in silence. He doesn’t meet Sam’s eye, not even when Sam says, “I’m going to call Max. Whether he can help or not, it’s probably a good idea to see what he thinks.”
Dean just about blows a fuse listening to Sam and Max hash out the details, with Max giving slow, too-vague descriptions of his location (“
Castiel is in the process of designing a heaven for a mesolithic human when he feels his world tear open at the seams.
Sam nods, approving. “Now, electronics aren’t allowed past the front entrance. You’ve hidden the burner phone you’re sneaking in?”
“Are you kidding me?” Dean blurts. He rifles through the contents of the newest basket, which is filled with French cheeses and chocolates and pasta, and packets of crackers and dipping pretzels. A bottle of wine sits nestled between jars of pasta sauce and flavored olives.
They pull apart, and Dean’s knees buckle. His brain blinks out a blue screen error warning, demanding an immediate reboot. Cas leans in close to his ear and growls, “I don’t want him touching you ever again,” and holy shit, Dean might actually melt into a puddle, it’s
Dean turns to find Patience jogging up from the spot where Alicia and Alex yet linger with Jody, Kaia and Max. She bows a bit beneath the former perimeter line, her breathing winded, but she recovers quickly. “Don’t shoot them,” Patience says, all rush of breath. “You can draw your gun, but don’t shoot. It’ll only make them mad.”
Something venomous uncoils inside Dean, squeezing his chest. His breath.
Kurt sours at that, enough that it draws his expression back closer to his usual constipated self. The glare he fires Hank’s way feels familiar too, so Hank calls it a win and leaves it at that.
, because RI is gonna replace it all
It’s a small comfort, reminding himself that it probably wouldn’t have worked out anyways. Dean has a rule against dating coworkers, after all. He needs to remain professional if he’s ever going to be promoted. A workplace entanglement just shows his head isn’t in the right place.
“So glad it’s you,” Dean moaned, rolling his hips to meet Castiel’s thrusts.
“Rowena,” Castiel rasps.
The girl, for what it’s worth, pauses her idle browsing of the aisle around them. She hangs serious and still at Val’s side, the half-filled basket of streamers and candles lumped against her leg, her arms drooping from her pockets.
How did these gifts even reach him? Dean doesn’t even know where he’s currently staying. Frowning, Dean heads back into the bedroom, searching for clues to his whereabouts. He pushes around water bottles until he finds a piece of paper pinned beneath an emptied glass.
Great, they’re going back to stats. Dean turns away, stripping his jersey off while facing his locker. Like fuck Dean’s memorized useless shit like that.
Castiel matched the pace he was observing, moving his hand dutifully in time to Dean’s own ministrations, pausing only when Dean tossed the lotion bottle over to Castiel.
The body of the message is simple enough:
“Hey, Cas,” says the man with long hair, crouching down. His elbows come to rest on the railing of the hospital bed, large hands folded together, fidgeting. He tries to smile. The gesture is as gentle as his voice. “How are you feeling?”
They chat idly a little while longer, but with no comforts found or reassurances obtained, they hang up shortly after.
“Hey, Hes,” Dean says, out of breath. His heart is pounding, loud enough to shake the room. He crosses to the laptop, his back kept toward Castiel.
Dean makes a wavering hand gesture Castiel chooses to interpret as agreement. He shuts the bedroom door and gives Dean privacy to change.
Cas watches him, quiet, caught in the same silence that had crowded in on them in the Impala, the air so tight with tension that Dean could barely breathe. Dean can’t stand the way Cas looks at him, so he tents his legs and folds his arms atop his knees, tucking away his face. He breathes loosely into the shadow of his arms, watching his vision spark while the tremors slowly fade.
“No,” Michael says, his voice pitching higher, body softening, as Adam clarifies, “Grief.”
With the calendar now open, the five-minute warning pops up with a jaunty chime, its counter marking the minutes remaining to the meeting in red.
“But does that make her happy?” Pamela posits. “If you’re both in heaven, but she can’t see you, is she really experiencing paradise?”
Fragments of a dream flitted through his mind, shifting and out of focus. What had started as him buried inside a sweet little omega had transformed into something sharper: the feel of broad hands pressing down between his shoulders, fingers digging into the nape of his neck. His chest squeezed against the sheets, scarcely breathing. His hips roughly pulled up, knees knocked outward, as he was mounted from behind.
Sixteen years of history is gone with her now, with nobody left behind to mourn the loss.
“Hm.” Dean just nods.
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel says sadly, although no one can hear him. He approaches the side of the bed and sits down carefully, two fingers extended.
Later that evening, Dean throws on a coat and heads outside to corner Benny about it, sniffing him out in the smoking area beyond the hotel bar. Benny hangs out back from the building with an old-fashioned in one hand, a lit cigarette balancing between the glass and his fingers. He glances over the collar of his winter coat when Dean approaches, and then holds out his hand. Dean pinches the cigarette off him and sucks it down with a deep breath.
Castiel gestures for the living room. “Take a seat. I’ll dish out a couple mugs.”
“I hope so,” Castiel answers honestly. “I want to make what’s best for humanity. We won’t get there without making mistakes.”
Home, meaning Andrea. The life they put on pause once Benny got picked by the Hawks. Dean stares out across the parked cars, breathing in the crisp night air. He holds the old-fashioned until Benny decides he needs another sip.
The formica beneath Cas’s hands cracks abruptly. He smooths the schedule over it and leaves the mess hall without looking Dean's way.
“What—listen to you, man.” Dean shook his head, seemingly embarrassed. “It’s not just about rubbing your junk, okay? I mean, it
Now the dorms are empty, the halls quiet.
“Still searching files.” Dean rolled his eyes and bit into his sandwich. “I got tired and left.”
Truth be told, Dean has kept on almost all the SA duties while Castiel continues to get acclimated. The guy seems barely to have a handle on the names and team positions of his coworkers, let alone what all is expected of him as their SA. Dean’s not about to jeopardize Inias or Miriam’s work by short-circuiting the new guy with an infodump containing exactly what all his job
Dean waves the offer up, but Castiel requests a hot chocolate. Charlie winks and shoots a finger-gun over to him, heading for the order bar.
They are getting closer; Castiel can sense it. A unified heaven may be possible yet.
“I’m not sure,” Jack answers, holding his hand up toward it. The creature mimics his motion, fanning out the gray digits of its right hand. “It seemed interested when I broke the token. It came up and started watching me.”
The parachute will open.
“Dean.” Cas’ eyes widened. “I didn’t know, I wasn’t thinking—I’m sorry,” he said again. “You can leave, I’ll take care of this,” he added, reaching for the pan.
He ought to kiss him. Ought to let Cas know that yes, he believes him now. He believes that he’s loving and that Cas loves him. He believes that they both are real.
Indra asks, “How do we make her leave?”
But Castiel does not accept the proffered hand. Instead, he stares down at Dean’s palm like it’s a foreign creature. His own hand tucks nervously into the pocket of his pants.
Sam says something then, but it’s lost in the pulse pounding in Dean’s ears. Dean sags, the whole situation weighing on him more than he ever wanted, the outcome he never expected hitting him like a train.
“Ain’t she a beauty? It’s our mobile casa, amigo!” Garth proclaims. He pats the side panel fondly with a giddy grin. “Booked us a campsite off the lake. Brochure says it’s got a real nice view.” Slinging an arm through Dean’s, he adds, “And it’s got hardly any neighbors nearby,” his eyebrows wagging suggestively.
“S’kinda nice,” Dean murmurs, glancing upward. “You can see the trees through the stars.”
Clues come up via email.
“C’mon, Dean,” Anael chides, tossing her stir-stick into the trash. “You know Raph. We’re each getting ‘action items’ to fulfill, in the aftermath of Bart’s transfer. ‘Everything is an opportunity’ and what have you.”
“Cold spots, weird smells, flickering lights.” Dean flicks his fingers out by rote. “Hex bags, sigils, and unusual objects. Y’know, the usual suspects.”
was here,
He knows how Dean has been staying late daily, despite Castiel’s best efforts to re-route production defects onto Inias’ plate. It is inconvenient, but Castiel will wait him out now, and catch Dean as soon as he steps out of his office at the end of the day.
Dean spies a distant lean-to where a small herd of cattle are grazing. Privately, he agrees.
“Fine.” Dean sloshed through the puddles toward the grave. He toed his boot against the bits of broken handle. “My shovel’s dead. Think the shed at the entrance has a spare?”
“It’s okay,” Ryan says quickly, too quickly to pass for natural. Maggie looks a bit bruised by it, leaving Ryan to struggle for what else she can say. “I only mean—hunting’s kinda your thing now. I’d only be—”
“Psh.” Dean waves them off, glancing aside. His phone vibrates on the counter, his pasta timer going off. He catches himself as he replies, signing in addition to speaking. “I can rest after this SA reshuffling is done. But supper’s calling, so ‘scuse me for a sec.”
After the last relative hangs up, Dean scrubs his face, hard, taking a moment to collect himself. He reminds himself again of why they’re doing this, the seven facts he’s supposed to remember. She lives on 5th Avenue, which online maps show is a cozy alcove down-and-over from the center of the city. Her mom and stepdad take care of her, working multiple jobs to keep their children warm and fed. A sister, younger by a couple years. Both seem kinda shy, based off what he gleaned from the family conversations.
“So,” Castiel agrees.
Castiel hasn’t said anything with humor. “I don’t understand.”
Ahead, from the entryway of the kitchen, a metallic clattering rings out along the concrete, and the smell of something burning floods the corridor. The noise continues rattling across the floor, followed by rough-voiced grumbling. Above it Ryan hears a woman’s voice laughing, distorted by something more than distance.
"Problem?" Dean raises one brow, leaning into his bluff. Maybe in hindsight it was a dick move, completing phase two on his own without approval. But what was Dean supposed to do? Just sit there twiddling his thumbs while there was work to be done?
Cain shrugs, neither concerned nor caring about their company. It’s a quiet but pleasant enough tableau—far better than listening to Bart talking inside.
On instinct, Dean leaned in as he took back the emptied glass, his nose skimming the top of Cas’ head. His nostrils flared, his blood spiking sharply before a cold wash of fear poured through him.
Dean chuckles as he pulls back, squinting upward. “Excited, are we?”
“Lots of strange types passing through today,” Kurt says idly, his attention glossy and fixated on an idea far away. “I was watching main street while interviewing Anne Lawson about the fundraiser next month. There was a whole convoy of out-of-state plates passing through, all heading for the old station road.” Kurt’s focus comes back into him then, honing in sharply on Hank. “D’you think they have something to do with the men who maintain the power station out there?”
“Done and gone,” Sam called back. “Just making sure.”
?” He turned back as much as he could, in their present state. “That’s what you’re worried about right now?”
Now that he is both awake and aware of the tubing wedged violently inside his mouth, panic seems the appropriate response. He reaches for his face with both hands; only one has the ability to touch the plastic. The other seems bound up in further tape and tubes. His chest heaves with shoveled breaths.
“Listen,” Sam says hastily. “You’re missing a lot. It’s kind of hard to explain.”
Dean jolts upright, eyes opening on a peal of flames. “Cas. What about—Sammy, did he—is he—”
After a long moment—more than a minute, maybe even more than an hour—Sam’s voice comes softly through dreams. “Get some rest, Dean,” he says, his hand patting firmly along Dean’s shoulder.
is on my
“Right, right, the radius thing—oh wait, you guys were serious about it? I thought, uh, wow—yeah, I’m pulling over now, I swear—”
Sighing, Cas drops to a saunter by time he reaches the bottom of the stairs. His gaze disdainfully flits around the frozen chaos of the room. “Don’t kill her,” Cas shouts to Dean. “She’s my wife.”
The basket beside it is filled with beef jerky and a family-sized bag of peanut M&Ms, courtesy of Miriam and Inias, per the card he finds buried in its depths. Even Anael, of all people, has sent him a modest bouquet of orange tulips and yellow lilies.
It’s just exhaustion. Dean knows it. He can’t keep this pace up forever.
“For what it’s worth,” Inias says to him, “I’m sorry you didn’t get the job. Lord knows why you want it, but we all know you’d be good at it.”
Dean’s heart coal flares wildly, before it gives out. That last flash of hurt before succumbing to the cool wash of grief.
He bent over the tub and turned the faucet, and then held his hand beneath the resulting stream of water, a motion he had observed Dean perform in similar circumstances. Castiel’s vessel sensed the transitory changes in water pressure, the sliding scale of temperature as it increased from cold to hot. After 3.28 seconds, he removed his hand as Dean would have done, and pulled the stopper to shift the water flow from the tap up to the shower head.
“Hey Dean?” he said. “I just want to say that I’m really sorry. I was a dick about this.”
“No, Cas,” Charlie said, “that is a statement.”
“Rhonda. She uh. She made me try on her pink panties.”
“Yeah…”
“Oh god,” Dean said to himself, his stomach rolling.
It was a shame Ava had such bad timing. Any other case, Dean would have slid her a card with his number.  She was beautiful, and had been entertaining and personable during her presentation of the liquors, chatting and flirting with ease. They’d learned she was in nursing school and had a basset hound puppy name Mowgli. Ava was exactly the kind of person Dean could see Sam settling down with one day.
Dean snorted. “Well apparently he knows Latin then. Seriously though, he has no memory and a freaking death wish. I could have picked better.”
“Sounds good,” Sam agreed. “And hey, don’t worry about the money right now.”
Castiel gave Sam a flat look that made
