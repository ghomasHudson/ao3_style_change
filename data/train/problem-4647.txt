“Not feelin’ it tonight,” he mutters.
warning: mention of past attempted rape/noncon (from chapter 8)
"Just what? Was snooping around in my stuff? Christ," Castiel mutters, fumbling with folding the photo before eventually just shoving it in his pocket. "Can we go now. Please," he says, almost begging. And he sounds utterly miserable.
Dean cocks his head. "I think you know the answer." Castiel doesn't even try to contain the smile on his face when Dean steps slightly closer. Castiel looks up through his lashes, marvelling at the boy in front of him. Dean's hands lightly caress Castiel's waist, curling around to rest on his lower back. Castiel's own hands curl in Dean's shirt and he closes his eyes just before their lips meet.
“Just trust me!” Emery shouts, voice echoing inside but his eyes are still soft and pleading and Castiel stares at him a moment before turning and placing a hand to the wall.
Castiel sighs, shaking his head. It will break him anyway when he leaves.
Dean laughs again. “Uh huh,” he mutters, sounding unconvinced. “Come here.” Castiel huffs, letting Dean drape his arms over his shoulders. “Proud of you,” Dean says softly, and his eyes are so sincere – boring down into him – that he has to duck his head, eyes falling to Dean’s lips instead. Dean grins, kissing him once more which Castiel leans into, before grabbing his hand and pulling him along.
Suddenly Emery is digging into his pocket and holding something out for Dean.
He heads back out into the hall, Emery close behind him and when he turns to meet his eyes he finds Emery's already on him, an uncertain look in his eye. And Catharlo feels it in his gut. Something did happen. And he's not sure what. And he's not sure if he ever will know. But he's not going to forget.
"Uh huh," Dean says, sounding a little sceptical. "Let me have a look." Castiel squints at Dean before shaking his head, the first guy's picture popping up. "No, not that dude. He looks creepy as shit."
“No, I’m not--” Dean’s chest threatens to crush him, the gripping becoming almost unbearable.
Perhaps he’s selfish. Because thinking about it now, he’s not sure what would have happened if Castiel
-----
The eldest whom sold his soul in return for his brother’s place in paradise after he’d been touched by a demon. Dean doesn’t hesitate in thinking he would do the same for Sam.
Castiel swallows down the lump in his throat. “You said--” Castiel tightens his grip on Dean’s wrist as he tries to push the knife further forward. He holds it there, eyes challenging. And calmly, as if taming a wild animal, he finishes. “You said that the angels took her to use her as bait.” Dean’s eyes well up with more and more tears and he can see he’s about to break. “If that’s true, why didn’t they?” The first tear falls. Because it’s true. The last Queen Mary was seen was entering her chambers with her guard. They never heard from her again. Another falls and Dean’s chest begins to heave. “And if the angels wanted to retaliate, to hurt you for what you had done to them, to
“Dean, please,” he pleads, begs, “It’s not working.” He finally looks to Dean, then, meets those beautiful green eyes, so bright against his pale skin. And his face crumples, chest caving as tears stream down his face, letting out a loud cry, that wracks his body.
“I was getting something from my locker.”
Dean tears his gaze away.
Castiel pulls away, a small smile on his face. His eyes aren’t filled with his usual amusement though. They actually look a little sad.
“What does it say?”
He lies in his bed, not wanting to get up. He thinks about it – about everything – for a long time.
______________________________________
Dean opens his eyes when he hears the telltale click of his door being opened. He wasn’t exactly asleep – he’d woken a while ago. And maybe it’s petty of him but if Castiel isn’t going to respect him then he has no problem making things harder.
Michael jabs again but pulls back at the last moment, successfully drawing Castiel in and the point of his sword rolls off his bicep just as Castiel spins away.
“Jesus Christ, Cas, are you fucking serious!” he explodes. Castiel sets his jaw.
“Yes, sir?”
Castiel meets his eyes then, but he's still hesitant. “Yeah, just my fucking ex again, I’m sure you know what that’s like,” he says, once more attempting to shrug it off and so Dean lets him. But Dean’s never spoken to an ex like that.
And then his hands slip.
Emery looks on in awe. Which means the grace would have been place here thousands of years ago. How the story goes… The fallen angel would have hidden it here. Devised all of this. Goosebumps riddle his skin. To be here, walking the very dirt the fallen angel once did…
Dean walks in circles, a hand running over his face, tears slipping quiet and unacknowledged down his cheeks.
He spins one of the swords in his hand before walking forward, slow as anything, predator and prey. And all the while, Castiel’s eyes never leave his. And Dean’s tense. Waiting for Castiel to vanish before his eyes – to press his blade to Dean’s throat before he can blink.
“But Your Highness, we cannot--”
“What are you talking about?” Dean asks, as soft as a whisper, and suddenly there are fingers grazing over the side of his cheek. His eyes flick open to find that Dean has stepped closer, tilting his head down slightly so he can catch Castiel’s eyes.
Charlie shakes her head, confused. “You don’t have to apologise.”
"How did you know where to find Castiel?" Dean speaks up suddenly. "And why aren't you surprised by Sam and I being here?" Emery parts his mouth to speak but Dean cuts him off again. "Was that you? In the shadows?"
He can feel the gazes of all the men around him but one stands out. The prince, arms crossed and posture straight, stands to the side of him. Castiel waits for a signal. But the prince doesn’t move nor say anything.
,” Dean spits.
And yet, Dean finds his eyes drawn to Castiel, watching as the sun highlights the sharp lines of his face.
He honestly thought that if Eve ever did get a boyfriend, she’d not tell any of them about it. But less than a week ago, out of nowhere, she told them all over text that she’d be bringing her boyfriend none of them even knew she had home for Christmas Day, much to the delight of those that had asked that question for all these past years.
“Okay.”
“Yes. What you did. Or do you not remember your hands around my throat?” Dean jerks back so harshly that it almost seems as if he’s forgotten about it entirely. “Trying to squeeze the life out of me after you’d beaten me bloody into the ground. And for what? Because I have wings on my back?”
He stumbles out of bed, muscles aching from their journey as he makes his way to the bathing room. He pulls his undershirt over his head and throws it to the ground, turning to begin filling up the water for the tub when he spots his reflection in the mirror.
“Fuck, he’s right. Someone’s here. What do we do now?”
But Dean doesn’t hesitate for a moment, pulling himself from his own trousers, cock already hard and leaking. He strokes quickly, pressing his face into the side of Castiel’s cheek, mouth wet on his skin.
Dean rips some cloth from a dead soldier lying nearby and takes Castiel’s hand in his own. Castiel barely reacts, merely watching as Dean wraps it firmly before carefully tying it off.
She looks like she’s about to scream as she holds a hand to her head, as though all of this is giving her one awful headache.
He's heading swiftly down towards the training hall now when Emery appears out of a side hall only a few steps ahead of him. Glancing around to find nobody close, Catharlo strolls up and grabs him around the arm to yank him into a servant's passage. Emery spins out of his grasp, stepping back until he meets the wall and lets out a pent up breath when he sees it's only him.
He nods and there is faith in his eyes. Faith that he doesn’t share.
Castiel finally meets Dean’s eyes. Guilty eyes. Dean’s shoulders slump slightly.
They don’t even come to a stop, Dean hearing the guards surrounding them on horses speak of Dean and Sam being saved and safe and sound inside the carriage, followed by the telltale sound of the outer gates grinding open. He peers out through the side of the curtain to watch as guards begin running up the hill to the castle to alert everyone of the good news.
Dean glances up just in time to see him walking over, his entire body sagging in relief. “Oh, thank god, I thought I’d come to the wrong cinema or something.”
“Personal guard?” Castiel scoffs. Maybe this prince isn’t as smart as he takes him for. One look at Dean and Castiel knows he doesn’t like that he’s spoken out of turn but how is he supposed to respond to something so nonsensical.
His eyes then flick to where Michael stands, not too far away, steadying himself against a tree. When he meets Castiel’s eyes, they are raw with shock and… And fear. His brother quickly looks away.
“No, I said no,” he responds, his own voice firm. “It’s not him, Charlie.” Something that almost seems like relief flashes over her pale features. “Why are you asking? Do you have something against him?”
Castiel doesn’t say anything as he sits, hands still in his pockets as Cillian and Sebastian watch him from over the table.
“I came to terms with it a long time ago. But seeing you both here now, alive and well, and not just that – on our side now… It makes me think, what if I could have just planned sooner. Taken you both with me. Because once I left, I couldn’t go back. The demon knew of me and it would have killed me if I had returned.” Mary grasps for Sam’s hand then as his younger brother’s eyes well up and Dean’s chest tightens, blinking to prevent his own tears from falling. A hundred thoughts and feelings flash through him in a matter of moments. All those possibilities… How different would he have been if they’d been raised here instead?
"Cas," Dean says, but he doesn't look up from the fire.
Castiel lifts his chin high. “Yes, Your Highness.” Dean glares at him for a few more moments and in those moments, Castiel observes another thing. His eyes – they’re green. If he hadn’t seen them in the light he would’ve guessed they were black – or maybe that just resembles the dark soul Castiel imagines he has.
It beats against him in a steady rhythm and Castiel sobs, loud and wretched and Dean’s arms only curl further around him.
"I love you. You believe me, don't you?" Castiel says, like suddenly it's the easiest thing in the world. And suddenly after all that's happened, everything feels easy.
Dean rubs a hand over his face. "It wasn't that easy, alright? Before I left we barely hung out and you barely talked to me and I thought you didn't fucking want me anymore. But you never said anything so I didn't know what to think."
“Is that alright with you?” Dimarus asks.
“How did you know? I’ve never…” he trails off, turning to meet her eyes.
But he doesn’t round it. He stops at the edge noticing the symbol in Enochian etched on the wall.
Dean’s smile broadens and he winks. “Had to brush myself up for you, sir.” He says it so easily that Castiel blushes, eye flicking away for a small second, unable to handle Dean’s gaze. And he’s annoyed at himself for it.
And that only means that even now…even now something could have happened and they just have not heard of it yet.
"We have a big group and we could always do with some more friends. You seem like a cool guy. You should come and sit with us." Castiel blushes at the compliment even though it wasn’t really a compliment in the way he wants it to be but it's hard when anything nice is coming out of the mouth of an extremely attractive guy.
Castiel huffs.
Dean swallows. “Told you what?”
Baudet purses his lips. "Unfortunately, not of this moment. However, we've been told there have been many meetings between the king and his generals – held in complete secrecy. Emery says that not even Dimarus has been told of anything."
“I do. It’s one of the first religions my mother and father studied seeming as they only lived just over the border.” Castiel looks up and leans slightly over, his shoulders nudging against Dean’s. He points towards the night sky and after a little bit of guiding and explaining, Dean starts to see the shape of an arm reaching down to grab another – as if pulling it up.
He’s not sure he wants to know. But he needs to. When all of this has settled, maybe he can ask Castiel for help with getting to the bottom of this.
Reyne’s lips part, hesitating a moment before he says, “Well, I’m glad. With all you’ve been through, having him by your side… I see a light in your eyes I’ve never seen.”
“You get more interesting every day don’t you, Castiel?”
As they come closer, the music and laughter louder now, Dean begins to notice other things. The musicians who sit at the very centre of all the bonfires play on instruments that some Dean’s never seen before and while all angels with wings on their back wear the same tops that tie at the back, they’re all of different colours and fashion. Dean recognises some clothing from sketches he’s seen in books on Yeoji and Akwanyo.
Dean strolls past him, shoving his shoulder roughly as he does but no one else seems to notice. Castiel looks down at his feet and takes another deep breath before following. He supposes he shouldn’t have expected anything more.
______________________________________
Dean still misses him. But it’s only been two days. So maybe after a week he’ll forget about Castiel all together and this fucking annoying miserable feeling will finally vacate his body.
Castiel huffs. "I can agree with that."
______________________________________
“Who said I didn’t want to?” Dean asks quietly, before leaning in and softly moulding their lips together. Castiel takes a moment to respond but when he does he can feel Dean smile against him.
“Perhaps I am being too morbid. Especially too much so for the morning meal.” She rises from her seat, taking her bowl with her. She hesitates. “It is just that I thought I was safe here. From the atrocities I saw out in the world. But now I know of what you suffered at the hands of the angels. And that is why I would share my thoughts with you. I wouldn’t dare with anyone else. I’ll leave you to your peace,” she says, before striding away.
“Loner too. Doesn’t have any friends,” he says, frowning down at his notebook. It’s not like Castiel seems to care – about anything for that matter – but it can’t feel too great not having any--
His own undergarments are down and off in an instant and he finally crawls back onto the bed, a hand on Castiel’s chest to push him gently back down but Castiel stops him.
No one wants to.
And he could see it – the push and pull of emotions in his eyes. But finally, he just nodded. Said that he did the right thing. That the angels would need their best warrior leading them into battle.
But before it can get too much Dean is planting another sloppy kiss on his cheek, whispering a “Happy anniversary,” and then he’s taking off back the way he came.
They stop at the end of his own street and for the first time in his life, Castiel wishes the walk from his street to his bus stop was longer.
Tears prick behind his eyes. “Stop.”
Dread fills Dean’s stomach but he quickly schools his features so as not to let his friend see. He nods before exiting the room. Dean stares at the red carpet, all thoughts of what could have possibly be discussed at that meeting – at what will be discussed at the one he should be heading to now.
Dean follows her eyes to where they land on Castiel.
"What? No! I don't--" Dean sweeps his eyes over the other girls sitting at the table, his cheeks burning red. They all give him the same look. "Is it really that obvious?"
The world is saved.
And Castiel can’t see anything in the dark. But he’d recognise him anywhere.
And if that's the only relief he'll get tonight, he's still grateful.
The heat burns his side and his body tenses, clenching his jaw to fight against the pain. The guard lets the heated iron rod fall away, giving him some rest before he starts up again, touching the tip to the back of his calves, searing though the cloth of his trousers and into his skin. He doesn't know how many times he's done it since he focuses the entirety of his mind on drifting away before the guard finally stops.
He folds his clothes and places them in the corner along with his sword and boots. He only realises then that he doesn't have his two golden bands. He'd never even thought of them when he was changing and preparing to escape with Castiel.
“I think perhaps that’s enough for now.” Dean opens his mouth to retort but casting his eyes over Castiel’s face shows the exhaustion clear as the morning sun. He nods, tight lipped. There is so much he doesn’t know. So many things he wants to ask. Needs to ask. The war. His mother. The mission.
“With their essence, the spell closed the doors to paradise and to the underworld."
Sam purses his lips together, head lowering as he shakes it before lifting his palm. Castiel narrows his eyes. “I tripped on the way through the forest.” Castiel sees then the graze upon his palm and smiles softly, cupping his hand gently and watching as Sam stares in awe as the graze closes over, healing completely.
"Dear Dean," he starts and pointedly does not look up, "I've decided that since graduation isn't too far away that I might as well take this last chance, rather than live knowing that I missed it."
Thankfully, some of the tension defuses when Deanna, Gwen and Samuel all take a seat at the table after offering everyone a drink – Mark still manning over the barbeque – and Dean’s left with himself watching as Castiel takes a sip of his beer, tan throat bobbing as he does, before he tears his eyes away, cheeks hot.
That was until as Dean had been approaching Dimarus’ office for that very choice when he found Emery lingering outside. As he had opened the door to allow Dean inside, he had whispered a name.
He usually relishes the quiet but today it only means that he can practically hear the thumping of his heart inside of his skull. Guilt and shame war in his chest accompanied by the tiniest sliver of hope.
Castiel watches after him, eyes pricking, hating that he even bothered to want to reconcile in the first place. Why does he even want to?
“Shut up.” Dean’s jaw tightens, his shoulders tensing and he can’t stop himself now, all of his rage rising to the surface.
“Sorry,” he starts, shaking his head at himself. “I should’ve asked first if you wanted to be left alone to rest or--”
“Looks like the trekkers are rising,” Dean says, standing quickly so Castiel doesn’t catch his checks reddening. “We should pack up our tents.”
Dean stares at the book lying in front of him. He doesn’t even know what it’s about – he just picked it blindly off his shelf and placed it on his desk. He’s staring at the first page. But he can’t see the words. All he can see is Castiel’s scars.
How could someone do such a thing to him? Dean still hates himself for what happened in Narla – for the whipping too – and he’ll carry that guilt and regret around with him for the rest of his days but this…
Castiel clenches his fists slightly around the crumpled piece of paper. He needs to hurry up and finish this.
His father doesn't speak until they've made their way up the stairs into the entryway to the dungeon. A few generals are waiting there and his father finally lets out a frustrated breath. "Nothing. Nothing at all."
There’s movement over his shoulder and she flicks her eyes to the end of the alley to find two women passing by. She inhales all the breath she has, ready to scream her loudest scream in hopes it will grab their attention when the man in front of her finally opens his mouth.
He has yet to tell Emery or Joren of the map, unable to have found a moment to orchestrate meeting with either of them alone without raising suspicion. But he hopes to do so soon. Carrying the burden of this knowledge alone is crippling him – and not only with worry that he will be caught before he is able to pass on the knowledge but with the fear that something else might be going on in this castle that none of them know about.
Castiel knows that three golden bands are reserved for the king and queen only and two golden bands for the princes and princesses of the Winchester castle. One golden band is something seen on the higher up generals and nobleman in Torrin. That’s as far as Castiel’s knowledge stretches but a quick look to the other guards in the room and they all have one silver band. And of course, the other day Castiel saw the Captain of the Guard adorning three silver bands, so perhaps the two silver bands are for personal guards only. Or possibly any high-ranking guards.
He glances to Alissande. “Are you comfortable with being alone with him?” She hesitates a moment before nodding and meeting Castiel’s eyes again. “Leave the door ajar and be quick. I have a meeting, remember?”
“You can take as many books from the library as you like. But those are mine,” Dean says. It’s as if he doesn’t even hear him at all for Castiel takes a step closer and grabs a book from the shelf. Dean closes his eyes for half a second before pushing himself up from his chair. “Are you going to listen to anything I say?”
He tries again. And again. On the fifth attempt, he nearly trips him but Castiel pulls Dean forward with him and it somehow ends up with Dean on his ass and Castiel still standing above him. Dean groans, clenching his hands into fists.
And then the two guards both pull out a dagger and slice into his jerkin, cutting the fabric from him. Their faces are both blank as they slice away, cuts deft and accurate, not even piercing his skin. And he knows these are some of the castle’s best guards. They are the king’s after all. And when they get down to slicing away at his doublet and undershirt until his chest is completely bare, scars visible for all to see, the guards only eye him up and down before looking towards each other. One walks around to stare at his back – no doubt searching for any sign of wings – and finding none, nods to his partner and they both swiftly leave the room with the bundle of ripped clothing, the wooden door shutting heavily behind them.

Despite the lightness of his voice, Dean shoots up from his desk, eyes wide and hair pointing in every different direction – and it’s only now that Castiel realises he must have been asleep.
Castiel nods. “We did.” And he wants to tell him it was because of him. Because Dean killed the king and stole the halo that allowed Castiel to unknowingly use its powers to tie down the enemy soldiers. But he leaves it. He will tell Dean everything when they have settled. For now, all he needs to know is that Sam is safe and he found the grace. As for Dean himself, however…
Dean thinks for a moment before asking, “What about the angels? Do you know of their religion?” He’s only heard bits and pieces from his mother who used to visit their capital, Iowan, to sort out affairs for years but he’s never found any books that go into depth about it. He never has many lessons on the vile animals mostly because they’re gone now and what’s the point but Dean’s always wanted to learn more to perhaps understand how they become such violent creatures – understand why they tried to take Torrin for themselves and most of all why they took his mother from her chambers.
When he slips back inside their chambers, however, Dean’s already up and riffling through his closet, throwing clothes on haphazardly.
While the restaurant is not packed, it’s certainly quite busy, and it takes a while for Castiel to find Dean but when he does, his pulse kicks up a notch. Because there he is, sitting in the corner, with his hands in his lap, staring at the menu in front of him and Castiel takes a moment to just gaze at him, eyes sweeping over all of his soft features and--
"We have the gold. Every single piece that you asked for." He turns and nods to two guards standing behind him. When Dimarus steps to the side, a small chest is revealed. It’s nothing special. Basic wood with iron latches. They wouldn't waste anything more for Castiel's bargain.
“This is Brady, Cillian and well, Seb again.”
Dean stares at him. "How do you know that?" Castiel stares back. Footsteps to their right have them both turning their heads to find Sam running towards them, torch in hand. And it's far too bright for this dark night, causing Dean to panic. Someone could see it and come searching.
All this time.
Castiel’s heart beats wildly, tears blurring his own eyes. And he doesn’t know what to say to encompass all that he’s heard. It overwhelms and he grips tighter to Dean and tells himself that no matter what happens, he won’t ever doubt Dean’s love for him. Even if it isn’t the kind of love he dreams for.
But when he imagines it, all he can think of is the wrong light brown hair. The wrong coloured eyes. The wrong smile. And hazel wings spreading from his back.
“I’m hurt, Your Highness. I thought you only ever talked of me.” Dean shakes his head with a fond smile.
“Okay.” Dean sits back on his heels and undoing his trousers before unelegantly kicking them off. He only pauses for an instant before he’s divesting himself of his undergarments and suddenly Dean is completely naked in front of him – no lake to hide him anymore. His eyes regard the dark flush that trails all the way down his chest until it greets dark hair at the prominent lines of his hips. Heat pools in his gut, cock twitching in his pants when he finally sees how hard Dean is.
The crowd of nobles stand at attention and once his father reaches the stage, all chattering dies with the music.
Dean swallows around a bite of his burger before shrugging. “What? I like looking at pretty things.”
. Stop trying to be so
“Fuck, Cas,” he breathes, hand growing quicker and quicker. His other hand trails down to caress Castiel’s jaw, grip rough and gentle at the same time and his eyes open to meet Castiel’s own just as his body tenses beneath Castiel’s grip. “I –
Dean hadn’t thought it was the best place but he’d had nothing else. In the end, it didn’t matter. Emery somehow had Catharlo whisked away almost as soon as he’d settled in the library.
“Dean, please,” he whispers. “You can’t take this out on me. I was only a
Patrus whirls as they cut, slicing into the air where Castiel once was, nearly nicking him a few times but Castiel is too quick and Patrus growls, harsh and guttural but Castiel keeps going, keeps on until he only gets faster and faster, some wounds healing but not all of them. Not in time.
He needs to remain strong if he is to see this out. Any second it feels like he could fall – fall so hard that he is unable to get back up. And he knows he’s strong. He’s pulled through many times before – more times than he can count.
He clenches his hands in his lap and gets up. Slowly he makes his way to Castiel’s door and with uncertainty, knocks lightly. Clearing his throat, he speaks, “Cas? You awake in there?” It’s only just past mid-afternoon but he knows Castiel – like him – is exhausted.
He barely feels present. He’s still been to all of his classes except for the one he has with Castiel – he doesn’t think he could bear it – but none of them were enough to snap him out of his daze.
Castiel’s sure this sort of thing happens often. Not too often. But often enough that taking a prisoner into the castle is not something these guards are strangers to. It wouldn’t be anything of a major concern.
“Why would you say that?” Sam eyes him curiously before shrugging.
“So, are you moving back to town, Cas?” Sam grins.
“I don’t need your help,” Dean says, as the next arrow lands even further away from the bullseye. Castiel stands from his position in the grass and steps closer to Dean. Just as he’s raising another arrow, Castiel grabs his wrist and pulls it down. Dean tries to shrug him off but Castiel holds him firm.
“I don’t know. What’s on?”
He pinches the bridge of his nose. Why is this so hard?
“You do the food for the prince’s breakfast?” he asks, and Hermana nods. “It is some of the best food I’ve ever had the pleasure to indulge in.” Hermana’s cheeks grow pink and she attempts to supress a smile.
______________________________________
The relief is clear in Dean’s eyes but there’s hesitance there too. It’s too late. Castiel’s already made him question everything. And he’s not going to simply forget something like that. “And what do you believe?”
But Castiel seems taken aback by it. For the first time, unable to speak. And there’s something there – in his eyes – but then he blinks and it’s gone.
"Yes."
No one in fact says much – Dean, Sam, William and the young boy included. Except for when Dean slowly but surely tells Sam what he knows. He starts from the beginning, with the gods, angels and demons. It's easiest to start there. Castiel rarely speaks or interrupts these conversations, Dean remembering nearly all of it perfectly well.
The only one still doing so.
Castiel stops breathing, the entirety of him filling with cold dread.
And as his chest heaves, a twisted awful sob escapes him and suddenly tears are streaming down his face as he cries and cries, all the while his chest ruptures inside of him. He sits back on his knees, leaning over until his forehead rests against the cool ground.
Castiel reappears ten yards away. “And yet, you are the one that has not gotten in a single blow,” he says, not understanding why Patrus isn’t fighting back.
"How do you know all this?"
It’s dark now, stars out. Castiel stands beside him.
Castiel’s mouth hangs open, short breaths punching out of him and Dean groans, almost certain he could come at the mere sight alone. He drops his head to find Castiel’s neck, lips greeting the skin beneath his jaw as he pulls Castiel’s leg up high over his waist, and rocks down into him.
Emery and Catharlo at least make up for him, inhaling their own meals like they haven’t eaten in days. Have they? Castiel doesn’t even remember. Everything has been such a blur.
Dean almost stands up to intervene, not wanting Brady to hurt him by thinking Castiel was actually going to attack him but Castiel shoves him away, pushing himself to his feet, chest heaving, hands in fists at his sides.
Castiel banishes the thought from his head and now all he can hear is ‘weak, weak, weak’ all over again inside his head.
“No. No, you see she isn’t dead. She is alive. She fled the castle that night and found her way to the angels. She’s been in hiding ever since and not so long ago, I was finally reunited with her. It was…” Dean trails off, words dying on his tongue. There’s a sadness in her eyes but more than that, her entire demeanour has darkened.
He wishes it didn’t have to be this way. He wishes he could choose. And maybe he could have. But he’s tired. He’s tired of it all. He just wants it to be over so he can be free. So, he can be okay for once in his life.
"A bit too much if you ask me," Castiel replies, to which Dean snorts.
______________________________________
His panic dampens for a moment as he wipes the blood from his fingers on his trousers, re-grips his sword and charges once more.
“He’s coming to see you,” Dimarus says.
It’s not long before a familiar face is standing before him.
A gentle kiss is placed at the top of his spine before Dean guides him back to rest against his chest, his head tucked beneath Dean’s chin.
And then, “I’m not sure I understand. You were perfectly fine to rattle your mouth off yesterday but not today.” Castiel still doesn’t respond and Dean smirks, leaning back in his chair.
Dean’s mouth parts. Mary purses her lips but nods. “So if Castiel had died at the invasion, the wings would have died with him and--”
Castiel's heart lurches in his chest. This must be all so overwhelming - all so terrifying. "It's okay, Dean. It's okay." Dean's smile is forced.
Dean can’t help the smile that spreads across his face before he averts his gaze, attempting to restrain it. “I’m sorry,” he says.
Dean doesn’t even make it to the bed before he collapses heavily to his knees. There’s blood on his fists and tears streaming down his face but nothing is worse than the ache that spreads throughout his body – the ache that feels like it might shatter him.
Down below, someone cries out.
Castiel’s startled out of his thoughts when Dean’s thumb comes up to smooth over the crease between his eyebrows.
“Cas, please, I--” Dean reaches for him, grabs him by the shoulder but Castiel jerks away from him as though burned.

And when Dean looks around at the end of the night, dancing amongst the crowd, all he can see are those he met along the way and those who have been with him all along.
Castiel vanishes. But he’s not sure if he has just disappeared or if he jumped. But he sees the rope that bound his wrists fall to the ground and before him, Michael’s head turns and he grins.
He identifies where they are going before they get there. The kitchen. A glance out a window as they pass through the hall and Castiel sees the sun high in the sky. It must be midday already.
“Of course, Your Highness,” the man responds, holding the bow out for Castiel and handing over the first arrow. Castiel plays with the bow for a moment, eyebrows pinched.
More tears spill down Sam’s pale cheeks as he shakes his head. “I am here of my own will, Dimarus. They freed me from the dungeons when the king enslaved me.”
______________________________________
“What happened?” Dean’s eyes fall away, sighing back against the jostling carriage, not doing his injuries any favours. “I mean, our suspicion about an outsider helping Castiel escape is confirmed now after that, although we only assumed it was one other, not two but it would make sense that there were more considering there’s two of you and Castiel would have been occupied with killing those guards and escaping himself although how they orchestrated it all at once--"
“Alright, then,” Dean responds, flicking his eyes back to the front. He’s not sure if ‘man’ really suits the description of Castiel. He doesn’t look older than himself and while he most certainly looks a man and fights like a man – even has the mouth of a man – the image of him sitting at the table before the laid out food, slightly hunched in on himself, hands in his lap and the exposed look in his eyes – he looked a boy.
the demon. That there is no doubt at all for if it is, the demon would not care for such trivial things as who lays with whom. It’s slightly easier then, when he speaks. “And for… For allowing him to manipulate me. For allowing myself to…get
Dean nods, taking the chance to wade closer to Castiel. “Of course.”
And if he can just get to him, Dean can save him, wipe the blood from his skin and the halo, the
Castiel turns his head to find a slight blush on Dean’s cheeks as he politely responds, “Reyne.”
Catharlo frowns. “It says it needs two of those with blood of the holy, both willing, to touch their vessels to the wall to be able to open the door. Blood of the holy, what could that--”
Next chapter will be up in exactly a week again! Much love and stay safe ♥
There's a moment of silence, in which Castiel's trying to find something else to say, before Dean speaks again.
Dean lets him go, Castiel falling back to the floor heavily. Dean’s breath hitches as he tries to hold back his cries. Castiel wishes the floor would open up and swallow him. Instead, he tucks his knees up and kicks Dean hard in the chest until he sprawls backwards.
Emery speaks to him quietly for a moment before they’re motioned forward and just as they did not so many moons ago, they slip out in the castle hallway and then out into the night beyond.
It hits the middle.
Dean huffs a laugh. “Because he asked you to? You despise him. Why would you allow him anything he asked?”
“I would stop talking if I was you.”
And it's that look in Joren's gaze, that surety that finally lets him breathe a little better for the plan has succeeded. Castiel and the allies will be long gone by now, Joren's arrow perfectly placed to puncture the many thick layers worn by Castiel but not to pierce anything fatal.
And he can’t do anything as Castiel finally walks away, the darkness consuming him and Dean continues to stand there long after he’s gone, a dull ache in his chest, silent tears staining his face, all the while, knowing that he just lost something that perhaps meant more to him than he ever knew.
“Excuse me, Your Highness,” the guard says, and one glance shows how young he is. By the time Dean turns to face the young man, most of the hardness has bled from him, replaced with that ever so charming guise.
Castiel keeps where he is, his cheek against his back, listening to his heart beat.
And that doesn’t even cover the ‘what are you doing with your life, Castiel?’ part of it. A part that truly, he doesn’t want to think about.
proud of you.” Dean’s heart stutters inside of him and it takes all of him not to let any tears overcome him for her words – they’re all too much. Such simple words – words he’s yearned for for over a decade now.
“I’m sorry,” he breathes.
It’s only been three days but Dean’s practically vibrating with excitement to see Castiel again. And he would think how fucking pathetic but he’s past the point of caring now. He spent the rest of the weekend trying to explain to his friends how he ended up getting that kiss from Castiel which mostly consisted of Dean flashing a charming smile and saying ‘
The sea swallowed them whole. The gods showed no mercy on that day.
“Yep.”
He wonders if it was a coincidence that Dean ended up across from him but glances to the side where his friends seem to be wiggling their eyebrows mockingly in Dean’s direction, tells him his answer.
He’d been excited at first. He must have been friends with this ‘Dimarus’. But as they approach now, Reyne sees him tense beside him. Is he worried this man will lash out at him too?
Not long after, dawn almost upon them, do they get word from another ally that slips inside their small inn quietly, that the other party has arrived. And that everything is in place.
Because those words have haunted him ever since Dean’s eyes glazed over – more so than the sight of Dean’s lifeless body itself. Those words, echoing through his mind, from Dean’s lips, unreciprocated.
Castiel’s breath stutters and his eyes go wide.
He gestures to Sam that he is done and for him to tell Dimarus all he wants. He has nowhere to be. He can take as little or as long as he wants.
Castiel’s gaze falls to the cobbles beneath them for a moment, ashamed and embarrassed of all that he has gone through when--
He sighs into him, marvelling at the thought that he’s actually kissing Castiel. That Castiel is kissing him.
“It was you, Castiel. It must have been the halo.”
This is real.

When he finally falls into a deep sleep, dreams of all kinds find him through the night.
“Ready.”
But Dean is still here, above him – his face gentle and eyes caring after making love to him in his cold, dark room. And he’s beautiful. Overwhelming so.
______________________________________
But Dean wouldn’t be looking anyway. He is.
excited. It’s about time you brought over a handsome, young man.”
“I don’t regret it.”
“Of course,” he says.
His whole body tenses and he feels like that boy again, stranded and alone in the castle, looking up into another boy’s face, hating him more than anything in the world, as though he was everything bad that had ever happened to him.
Castiel chuckles. "I won't." Suddenly, a hand bumps his chest.
Gwen purses her lips and he knows she doesn’t quite believe him. “The others are still a little way off so why don’t you go sit down outside, and we’ll have everyone come out for drinks?”
“No…” he whispers, his lungs filling with air but he’s not quite sure he’s breathing. “How?” he asks, the knowledge that the mysterious man that whirled into his life and into his arms was saved from death by his own mother – it’s almost too much.
"Really?"
“Hey, shh, it’s only me,” Dean says, voice lowered as Castiel rubs a hand over his eyes, trying to catch his bearings.
Dean grips him tight, heart pounding and he can’t stop the tears that well up and spill down his cheeks, the guilt loud and violent inside of him.
“Dude!” Dean shouts, flipping Victor and the rest of his friends off before self-consciously returning his eyes to Castiel and it’s so strange to see. Dean Winchester is the last person who gets self-conscious. Especially when it comes to hitting on guys because he’s had no problem doing that since the day they met. But this…there’s something different.
"Yeah, well, actually," he begins, that grin still plastered to his face, "--and I don't mean to be forward – but would you like to, I don't know, go out and get a drink sometime? Like a date."
But it still stands. For he wouldn’t have tried to abandon his people, would never have those moments, if it weren’t for the suffering. If it weren’t for Michael and the backs of his people turned on him.
And when he serves up dinner and the chatter dies down, he swears Castiel is somehow closer than before, almost snuggled up beside him.
Dean’s eyes flash with longing and disappointment but when Castiel lets his wrist go, his hand falls to Castiel’s trousers instead. And somehow, the fear eases. His breaths are jagged and searing hot against Castiel’s jaw as his hands fumble with the buttons of his trousers until they’re completely undone.
“You.” Dean turns to meet Michael’s eyes, intense and piercing. “What did you say? About the night all those years ago when your mother was confronted by the demon. When it possessed her, they reach Iowan from Anathee within a night.”
“We’re going to untie the rope,” the guard says. “Don’t try to fight.” He doesn’t respond as a sword is pointed at his throat. The guards behind him untie the rope before his jerkin is being ripped off – the buttons snapping in half – and pulled down and off his arms.
Beside them, the rest of the students finish, running their own lap at the normal pace and not succumbing to Dean and Castiel’s silly race.
He feels Castiel’s eyes shift to him, boring into the side of his face and he swears he barely breathes, heart a racquet in his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
And perhaps, he doesn’t mind it all that much whenever Dean gets a little close to him, or hearing that laugh or catching that smile.
Castiel wants to tell him. Wants to tell him to keep hope. That there are others out there who stand against the king. But he can’t.
He holds there a moment, head dropping forward to rest on Castiel’s shoulder as his muscles finally turn lax, chest heaving and all he wants to do is let himself fall backwards onto the bed but Castiel is still in his lap, one hand in his hair, the other curled tightly around him. So, he holds himself upright, wanting to savour this moment between them.
He would give anything.
Dean places a dramatic hand over his heart. “I thought you were the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen,” Dean says, dramatically quoting the line from the
It's not long after he hears the door open and he opens his eyes to find Dean walking towards him and without a word, sits down beside him. Their shoulders and knees bump together and neither speak as they stare out into the grazing fields. He rests his head on Dean's shoulder as a tear slips down his face. And yet he still doesn't feel a thing.
He pokes his head out just to double check no one is wandering in the back gardens and that the guards are in their positions by the doors and under the small arches blocking their view of him. Thankfully, they are and with his fingers clinging onto the cracks in the stone, he pulls himself out of the window.
And Dean catches him. Like he always has. Taking a few steps backward to regain himself before burying his head in Castiel’s neck and squeezing him so tight Castiel can barely breathe.
The sound of loud boots crunching outside has both of them pulling away.
But all he can see is the blood on his hands. The pain in his heart. Every scar on his body that Patrus has inflicted. Every torture that he has had to endure.
Catharlo looks at him strangely and despite the chainmail he wears, the sword and the shield on his back, despite how big he is, he looks as gentle and soft as always.
Three ingredients. The Three, Castiel calls them. The wings, halo and grace. They became human.
But if he holds on tight enough, it’ll be over soon. It’ll be--
His body reeks of hardness, of intolerance. Most men the size of him take the world in their hands and crush anyone who stands in their way. But a glimpse of his face and Emery is not so sure of him. His face is warm, a brown neatly trimmed beard drawing attention to the shape of his lips.
He can hear calls throughout the crowd.
It’s past midday when they stop for lunch. They park their canoes by a small dock, hauling each other out to go and eat under the shade of some trees.
"Seventh time," Victor responds from behind her.
He rounds the corner to the carpark behind the pub only to find two guys, standing a mere metre apart, and--
Nyree steps forward, Reyne close beside her. She raises her sword high, wings arching.
“Dean?” he says, as he stares into those green eyes – unfocused and glazed over now and-- “Dean! Dean, just stay with me!”
Or perhaps he's speaking too soon. Perhaps in a day, in a week, in a full moon cycle, he'll want nothing more than to go back to his old life. A sliver of shame washes over him at the thought. Because isn't it what he's been training for his whole life? To protect and serve his people? It's only now that he understands it's not just the people of Torrin. It's the people of the world.
He closes his eyes, focusing on his breath coming in and out, slower and slower. His face crumples and he chokes out a cry before the tears flood down his face again, his body trembling.
“So, you don’t get to leave,” he says, feeling more and more fragile by the moment, fingers trembling where they’re balled into fists. “You don’t get to give up. You’ll stay with me until the very end. Until we figure it out.” When Michael keeps looking up at him, quietly, not responding, he fists his shirt and shakes him like a desperate man, begging, as he shouts “Do you understand!”
“What are we out here for?” Sam asks softly, pulling Dean out of his thoughts.
He tears his eyes away from them, catches Castiel waiting a few steps away, watching him. The few that are travelling with them – human allies since none of the angels can travel safely with wings on their backs – wait further off, speaking quietly to Nyree, Reyne and Michael.
Castiel shrugs out of his jerkin, stands still for a few moments, holding Dean’s eyes once more – and Dean notices the way his chest heaves, breaths coming quicker – before he takes the hem of his shirt between his fingers and pulls it over his head.
Some days he itches for something more. A job of any kind, helping around the castle. But he sticks to training with Dean and getting used to being able to do what he wants in his time off.
Dean’s still looking at his stomach and Castiel can’t catch his eyes and no, no, he shifts himself carefully to peer over Dean, not wanting to cause him pain as he searches in the mud with his hand and
“I, uh…” Dean pulls the folded fifty dollar note from his pocket. “Your cut.”
Castiel’s sitting in the grandstand alone – early as usual – going over his clipboard that has the session written down for tonight when someone slumps down in the seat next to him. He jerks back in surprise, eyes flicking up to find Dean looking out towards the track.
“Because they are my family now. My people.”
Once again.
“Jes. How many were there back there?”
Castiel huffs a laugh, shaking his head before indulging him. “There might have been a sentiment about you being handsome.”
He strikes hard and fast, feigning a blow one way before he appears behind Patrus, striking another.
“Go where?” Dean asks.
Out of the corner of his eye the others have stormed out too, Nyree grabbing Dean, holding him back from coming over.
"What?" Dean says, sounding slightly offended.
Brady’s about to retort something in return when the one and only Bela Talbot strides over, perching herself on his table.
“You don’t have to be sorry, Dean.” It was quite frankly the best part of his night.
“Would you stay?”
Castiel barely remembers seeing Mary at all when he was younger – in their first years at camp. And why would he have? Michael took him away, carved out a space for them far away from where the other angels began to build a home for them to live. And only those few that were high in rank were permitted to see him – and even then, only every once in a long while.
“Well,” she says, perking up once again. “I must be off soon. I need to be back at the pub before anyone can get too drunk and start breaking things and I would like to squeeze in a dance or two.”
There is a moment between them taught before she says, “Dean?”
Dean shoves it off and starts on his doublet, pushing forward to capture Castiel’s lips once more. Castiel kisses back, a hand tangling in the short hairs at the back of Dean’s neck as Dean pants heavily, his hot breath sending a shiver down Castiel’s spine. The prince pulls completely away then, throwing his doublet to the floor and grabbing his undershirt by the back of its neck and pulling it over his head.
Luckily, his disastrous thoughts can’t spiral any further once they make it to camp early and he’s once again tasked with setting up his own tent and helping any of the girls that are having troubles. It’s enough to keep his mind away for a while.
Another muttering in disbelief, “The demon.”
The festivals in Iowan were like this. It hurts Castiel to even think it. But they were. There were stalls selling art and jewellery. Stalls with games and foods and people drinking and dancing everywhere.
They’ve warmed down and stretched thoroughly and everyone is waddling back over to the stands to pack up and leave after a hard session. Everyone of course but Dean who walks straight over to where he sits in the grass, usual clipboard in lap.
______________________________________
A hand is on his right leg suddenly, pushing it up the mattress at an angle so Dean can fit in between his legs and Castiel braces himself. He feels the slick head of Dean’s cock press against him and the deep, laboured breathing behind him before he’s pushing inside.
. He supposes he owes him the truth. Dean’s been so kind to him and yet he’s given nothing in return. He doesn’t have anything to give. Perhaps this is all has to give.
The ache in his knees turns into a searing flash of hot agony and Castiel presses his forehead into the wood, gritting his teeth to keep from crying out.
The man looks at him then with complete fear. “Never heard about anything strange being sighted,” he says, thought his hand slips where it’s wiping the glass. “And the best route is to stay down here.”
When night finally comes for them, Castiel tells him it’s best that he sleeps with Sam. That this place is still new and he shouldn’t leave his younger brother by himself. Dean doesn’t argue, knowing that it’s likely he just wants to be alone, although it’s still hard for him to leave him in such a state.
And so, this is how it is. At least for now.
But Castiel takes it. “It is, Prince Sam,” Castiel starts, Dean’s gaze falling on him once again, “Although, they’re not the only culture that doesn’t eat meat. Did you know that in many cultures in Yeoji, they don’t eat meat either? Some cultures even go as far as to only eat food that grows from the ground. It’s very interesting actually, I’m sure you could find some books on it in the library.”
Castiel pauses in his steps, his heart racing as his thoughts whirl. Emery and Catharlo say his name beside him but he can’t hear them as he stumbles over to a nearby building and presses a hand against the cold cobblestones.
“I thought I saw – one night I thought I saw wings in the dark but I – I don’t know.” Because there’s no such thing as an angel that can hide their wings. Everyone knows that.
“Fine. I’ll get you going. What’s your family name?”
“Do you have faith that I am enough? That I will defeat the demon with only one of the Three?”
He supposes, looking down at the man who gazes back, that now he does.
Castiel’s eyes flick down to the money in his hands before he takes it and for some strange reason, laughs.
“How do we win the prize?” Sam asks, visibly excited.
“Even after all we’d been through, even after giving up in our own Elo, she never gave up on you. And I didn’t believe her,” Elaria says, shaking her head, smiling now. “But now I do.”
Dean’s phone vibrates on his desk as he pulls a fresh shirt over his head.
“I don’t have a god,” Castiel says, repeating their own words back to them, teeth gritted as blood trickles from his ears and inside he screams. “I
“If all goes well, we will meet you back here, then. It will be a long journey ahead of us.”
The eighth only spares him small smiles, eyes narrowing as he attempts to make her laugh.
Dean and Sam are still alive. Still prisoners of a sinner, seeking revenge against the king. And if somehow, they came back, they could walk freely through the gates without having to disappear at all.
“Well? C’mon,” Dean says, nodding towards him.
He’s planned it perfectly. It’s nearing midnight now and Dean’s locked tight in his own room. Castiel has spent the last two days finding out everything he didn’t already know. The layout of the outside of the castle and most importantly the routine of the king and general’s private meetings. He already knew the guard’s rotation schedules and the location of the king’s chambers.
“Cas,” Dean says, eyes still blinded with the light. “It’s beautiful.” His voice is almost a whisper, not believing his eyes. But knowing all the same what he is witnessing.
“Back then, I wasn’t in control of my…abilities. My healing came and went. But it didn’t matter anyway. If he saw that I had healed before he said so, he would punish me again.” Dean presses his cheek against Castiel’s own in what he hopes is a comforting gesutre, not wanting to interrupt.
V stands immediately. “You must be tired. I’ll show you to a room while the others clean, if that’s alright?” Sam nods, bleary eyed, arms wrapped protectively around himself.
“Are they bothering you?” Dean asks, and Castiel’s eyes narrow before he understands whom he is talking about.
The sound of the castle doors opening has Castiel’s head jerking up. It seems too early for the guards to be rotating. He strains his ears but it’s no use at this distance. Another guard is talking to the two on duty and they appear to be arguing.
The colours of the walls and designs of the wallpapers change throughout their journey, however, instead of feeling overwhelming they somehow blend into each other seamlessly. He passes many sets of doors, all wooden with silver or gold handles and locks, and more artistic designs painted across them. Most of them, unfortunately, are shut making it much harder to understand where exactly everything is, although he’s sure he’ll find that out sooner or later.
“I suppose so, Your Highness,” Castiel says, and tries his best to keep any mocking tone out of his voice. The prince stares at him for a few moments, no one saying anything, and Castiel stares straight back.
He doesn’t close his eyes. He doesn’t dare.
He tells her then that the man he fell in love revealed himself to be an angel. It’s only then he tells her the man’s name was Castiel.
Castiel stares at him, into those beautiful green eyes that feel as though they can see straight into his soul, caressing the very being of him. He swallows before carefully resting his head on Dean's shoulder, not able to conjure up any more words lest he break. His tears come silently, chest tight as he holds it all in and when Dean's strong arms wrap around him, mindful of his wounds, he breathes.
But when he returns, finding himself in between Castiel’s open legs, hovering over him, he’s never felt such heat inside of him.
______________________________________
He walks beside him and Catharlo finally notices that he’s only a few inches shorter. The young man walks with purposeful strides, eyes darting around at everyone they pass, curiosity thinly veiled. His cheekbones are high and sharp, helping frame his eyes in a way that has Catharlo stumbling in his step.
Time slows.
He plunges his hands in wiping the blood away quickly before splashing it on his face and furiously scrubbing until he feels his skin go raw. His heart still races and his tears still fall but as he picks the bucket up and dumps it over himself, he feels the tiniest sense of relief.
But before he can disappear entirely, he throws one last look over his shoulder, holds his eyes and then, just like that, he’s gone.
, Castiel thinks.
Catharlo raises an eyebrow. “What are you doing behind here?”
“You love it.”
Castiel’s hand tightens around the hilt of his sword. “You know nothing of who he is. Nor what he’s been through.” He almost spits it, can feel the quiet anger rising in his chest. For how dare Michael speak to him of Dean as if he is a lesser man?
They've only been silent for a while after when Dean says, "Damn, what is this? Five times? I guess the universe just really wants us to kiss."
“Uh – cheeseburger’s a classic.”
trigger warning: attempted rape/noncon
“It was fine, Prince Sam. But nothing memorable.”
Dean steps away, shoulders held back, head held high. A prince, Castiel thinks. The human prince.
Dean laughs again. “What about the seventh? You know, black hair, blue eyes. Looks like he could fucking kill you with one hand.” Another crunch followed by a heavy thud and Dean goes silent.
Castiel’s breath stutters as he sees the outline of a ring.
Unexpectedly, the prince gestures towards the cart and a few guards start to make their way over to him. Nicolaus looks smug where he stands next to the him. The guards round to the back of the cart, pulling out a set of keys and unlocking it. Then hands are taking a hold of his shackled feet and he’s being pulled out. He lands heavily on the unforgiving ground, arching his back and tucking his head instinctually to lessen the pain that blossoms through his already bruised body. Not that it helps all that much.
The crowd cheers and Dean finds his gaze falling upon the crowd, taking in the different people. He spots a few familiar faces. Nobles he’s met before, women he’s danced with at balls.
Dean shakes his head before obliging, scanning his eyes over the bookshelf instead.
He doesn’t think he’s ever sat through a more excruciating hour in his entire life but finally it’s over because the professor is packing it up and telling them he’ll see them next week and Castiel’s shoving his things into his backpack.
She lifts her eyes then and there’s something there, something cautious before it’s replaced with that same sorrow and defeat.
Castiel continues to stare at him, eyes flicking down and back up once before he says, “You can call me Cas if you want.”
The night goes on, Dean speaking to Sam and Leda mostly but also being swept up by other ladies asking for a dance. They giggle and blush, flirting with him not so subtly and naturally he flirts back but every time, his gaze always finds Castiel – who in turn, is always watching, even if he tries to flick his eyes away before Dean catches him.
The demon looks at him, then, something strange in its eyes. “It’s not my fault the angels fell, stranding the souls in the in between with no way to enter paradise.” And it sounds almost…angry.
“And what of the war?” Dean asks suddenly, breaking his train of thought. And there’s that word again. War. He itches to correct it. But he doesn’t know what he can say to justify it. Dean’s eyes and voice are soft as he speaks. “You said you were there that day. What…happened to you?”
But his thoughts don’t get any further, Eve voicing them aloud for him. “Dean! It’s so good to see you,” she says as she pulls him into a quick hug before stepping back and threading an arm through Castiel’s, “This is my boyfriend, Cas.”
“There was an angel girl, only young. She was only trying to help some of the guards that were wounded, to thank them for what they’d done. And for it, they tried to force themselves upon her.” V’s eyes harden, that sadness now replaced with anger and Dean’s chest pulls tight. Across the table, there’s a slight flicker in Castiel’s eyes. Dean almost reaches towards him but restrains himself.
Dean narrows his eyes. “Sell what?” Castiel shoots him an exasperated look. Dean stares back a moment before, “Oh, yeah, we just had sex.”
“Alright,” he says, trying not to sound disappointed as he leads Castiel to the counter.
As he became older, and the camp grew and grew, closing the space between them, he saw more of the other angels but only from afar. Few words over the years were spoken to those who weren’t in charge of helping him with formulating the plan for his future which ended with sending him off on his mission. In those years, though, he rarely even glanced her – and in the times he did – he thought little about it. Just another person weaving through life, so close and yet so far from Castiel and his own woven path.
He takes it better than expected. Fear and hesitation are justifiably present but it’s taken over by that fierce bravery and strong will his younger brother has shown throughout their journey thus far – and throughout all his years – to do whatever he can to help.
“It’s okay, Sammy.” Dean grips Sam’s hand tight and his brother’s eyes shine with words unsaid. “We’re going home now.
“I’ll go fetch a maid to get some.” Castiel doesn’t even nod this time. Dean sighs, turning to leave although every part of him is yearning for him to stay – to go back and hold him close. Because Castiel needs the comfort. That’s why.
“Wait, where’s--”
“Well, I think you look very nice too,” he responds, and Dean’s eyes widen ever so slightly before he ducks his head, a smile on his lips. His friends whistle even louder at that and Dean rolls his eyes but they’re much lighter now and Castiel’s heart swells at the sight.
He feels blood trickle from his own nose but it doesn’t bother him. Not anymore.
He wonders if this was fate. Or if Dean just stumbled in the wrong direction and got swept up in Castiel's fate by accident.
Elaria reaches over and grabs Castiel’s hand, intertwining their fingers. And his heart breaks. Because they had no one. Two little girls, all alone after that?
Castiel places the bread in his hands back down on his plate. "Yes."
“Leave,” Dean says, voice raised above the waves.
“Bullshit,” he says.
Dean huffs. “Fine. But it’s not my fault if my hand slips and I accidentally grope you in front of everyone.”
Castiel suddenly throws his arms out to the side and yells something back and before he’s even finished saying whatever it is he’s saying, the guy punches him right in the face.
It sends fire through his veins.
Castiel cries out in pain, clutching at his side as he lands on the hilt of his sword but before he can even say something more, Dean is slamming the door closed.
“Not exactly.” A beat. “I guess I don’t need any more guards then,” he says, before turning and walking towards the set of double doors to the left. Dean waits until Castiel is behind him before opening them up.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean replies quietly. He looks the nearly the exact same since Castiel last saw him in person. The only difference though is he looks…sadder. His eyes seem dull compared to the piercing green that Castiel remembers. His smile is soft but it doesn’t reach any other features on his face. It doesn’t sit well in Castiel’s stomach. Dean should be happy. It’s what he deserves to be.
But no Dean.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
But it’s all he can think.
______________________________________
Dean pulls away, shaking his head. “There has to be another way. There has to--”
Castiel’s eyes are still trained on the stars, Dean watching him intently. “Some believe that in fact, the God of Light touched the fallen angel, leading the angel to fall in love and complete the spell – that the God of Light knew about the poisoning of hearts and this was the only way to stop it. It was their plan all along.”
“That’s right. You didn’t. There’s nothing to be sorry for.” Dean lets out a deep exhale, running a hand through his hair. They sit in silence for a few moments, listening to the sounds all around them. “We’re not good at this,” Castiel finally says, voice soft and Dean huffs, a small smile appearing.
Beside him, though quiet, he thinks Castiel appreciates it too. He still gets those looks every once in a while. That awe and wonder and gratefulness.
“But I saved you, didn’t I?” Castiel retorts but the rage in Dean’s eyes is only growing.
______________________________________
Dean swallows before meeting his eyes. “Yes, everything is fine. It’s time we get back.” Castiel nods, waiting for him to lead the way. And Dean does so quickly, taking the stairs up to the pub two at a time. He turns to give Charlie a small nod when he catches her eyes.
Dean blinks, his heart lurching in his chest because it’s all he’s wanted to hear since Castiel showed up at the door today but he’s no less confused than he was a moment ago.

Finally, that warm smile of Dean’s re-emerges. “Hermana, this is my new guard, Castiel. Castiel this is the head cook, Hermana.” The woman smiles, her freckled face kind and sincere.
And then, "I need to use the bathroom," and Castiel’s swiftly stepping out of the car and slamming the door behind him before Dean can stop him. Dean watches him go, more confused now than ever. He rests his head against the steering wheel once he disappears from sight. Why does Castiel even care? He hates Dean -- that is quite possibly the clearest thing of all.
Sam sits upright immediately. "No. He can't do that. Why would he do that?"
But, “The in between, yes,” she says, and there is no doubt to be found in her voice.
He takes a few steps forward, bends and swipes Dean’s legs out from under him.
He peers up under his eyelashes, face crusty from his tears and the dry blood. He has to at least try. Convince Dean that what he believes – what he thinks of the angels – is wrong.
The whereabouts of the Three were passed down by the descendants of the brothers to the leaders of the angels, the first of the Three, the wings, only being discovered after Iowan was built. After the leaders deemed it safe to bring the wings there.
Dean scoffs now – he can’t help it – and his father glowers at him. “If he was going to kill me, he would have done it already.”
“There was a boy. He wasn’t supposed to head into battle but I couldn’t find him here when they marched out. Emery, his name was.”
Dean’s cheeks burn, eyes flicking away. “I mean, it wasn’t much since the demon still has the halo which they showed me even, although they said of course they couldn’t get it to work because I know
Castiel shivers, his cheeks heating at the intimate touch. It’s still so strange. That he’s not repulsed by this – although there is still the overwhelming desire to jerk away, the desire to lean into the touch now overpowers it.
Castiel’s eyes flick over his shoulder, in the direction they were walking, before he shoves his hands in his jacket pockets. “Fine,” he grumbles, and begrudgingly follows Dean over to his friends.
He starts with his desk, rifling through every drawer as carefully as he can – making sure not to leave anything out of place but to no avail. It would help if he truly knew what he was looking for. What does the halo even look like? Surely not a giant halo filled with light or else he’d assume it would prove easier to find. He searches the trunk at the end of the bed, feels his way over the bed itself, fiddles with every book on the bookshelf, all the while a clock ticks in the back of his mind, winding down ever so quickly.
The easy grin finally slips into place. “Well, I was just wondering, you know, if maybe you’d like to go out and get a drink sometime.”
The chatter has grown slightly louder, eyes beginning to avert now as many go back to their own conversations. Castiel sits silently, staring at his bowl – three different grains mixed with summer berries. He swirls it around with his spoon, thinking now that this was definitely a bad idea.
The door to Dean’s chambers opening is what wakes him – making him jerk up to his feet, a hand on the table for balance as Dean stands there in front of him. It’s just past dawn. Castiel barely slept, crying until he had no tears left to shed and healing all of his wounds before he subsequently passed out in the floor.
When Hael leads the rest of the group to warm up, Dean doesn’t linger, instead taking off quite quickly with everyone else and Castiel’s left watching him go.
No underworld. No paradise.
Dean only just remembers to smile in time for the first shot. The next shot snaps just as Dean feels Cas rest his head in his shoulder. Dean smiles even more at that but then just in time for the third shot, Dean feels lips pressed to his cheek.
There’s finally a break in conversation, Dean somehow pulling them away for a moment of privacy.
Nyree barely spares them a glance from where she’s shuffling some papers around on a small desk.

All appear to hesitate before the mother finally steps forward. “You didn’t hear the announcement?” she asks.
He looks up at the stars and wonders if he should speak of them. But Castiel’s eyes are closed, head almost turned into his chest.
