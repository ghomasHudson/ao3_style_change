“That makes two of us,” Dean mumbled, and everyone turned to him, likely wondering how authentic that confession was. It was the god’s honest truth, and the evidence must’ve been painted all over Dean’s expression.
Castiel, who was rarely at a loss for words, suddenly felt like his mouth was stuffed with cotton. Truthfully, he knew, anything Dean was likely to do would arouse him immensely. Was that an acceptable answer? “Uhh…”
a reference to the angel Mike had fallen in love with. After everything Castiel had done to make sure Dean’s book was published, the months of turmoil in Sacred Sun Press where they battled with Zachariah and implemented new policies and leadership, Dean considered Cas the series’ literal savior. It was only fitting, then, that the once unnamed angel was now known as Castiel, and in the front matter of Dean’s fourth book, there was this dedication:
“Listen—” Benny begins, but Dean’s had just about enough of this.
“I know,” Dean says stupidly, because he can’t think of anything else to say and because it’s true—for a weird, awkward angel dude, Cas loses every shred of insecurity the minute he’s got his hand wrapped around a cock. In Purgatory his movements had been so sure, so strong and confident, that Dean had been happy to simply lie there and let himself get pulled apart. But he wants to make Cas feel good too, he wants to kiss his neck and suck on his nipples and settle between his legs until his tongue reaches Cas’ hard cock—
It would never not be a turn-on to hear Cas curse. It was a proven fact by now, since Dean was currently hard as a goddamn rock.
Dean crosses into the kitchen tentatively, like a human approaches a skittish animal, but he shouldn’t have been worried. It’s not
“Don’t go...I want to, god do I want to. You have no idea what you do to me, Dean. It’s just…” He bit his lip, took a deep breath, and continued. “My first time was not pleasant. Raphael was careless and quick and I was sore for a while. It’s your first time and I want it to be memorable for the right reasons.”
“Dean,” Castiel says, adominishing, “you are many things, most of which I haven’t had the honor of uncovering yet, but I can assure you that you're not ‘some librarian’.”
Castiel exhaled in disbelief, stopping in the middle of the sidewalk. “Dean...we were supposed to be partners in this.” He knew he sounded pitiful, even pathetic, but he couldn’t help it. “You...you don’t want my help anymore?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Missouri said dismissively. “Well, we might make it to the altar before you two—how’d that happen?”
Drop a comment below and say hi. <3
“I’d say you’re my favorite beta, but that’s like, most of the people I know,” he replied cheekily.
to move, but he inched in deeper and deeper until he bottomed out, then watched and listened for Dean’s reaction. The omega was breathing fast, arms shaking, until he finally whimpered, “Move Cas, please, fuck…”
“Calling Planet Dean, calling Planet Dean,” Charlie intoned in a robot voice.
“Uh, sorta feeling like a circus animal over here, Cas,” Dean mumbles, unrolling the cling wrap off the plate of burger. Castiel tilts his head in his confusion, and Dean flutters his eyelashes, a very distracting sight indeed. “I, uh, just mean—you keep staring.”
“Fuck me,” Dean repeated, not caring if he was coming across as desperate because, uh yeah, that was a good way to summarize the current situation. Still, though, Castiel’s expression was full of caution. Dean huffed impatiently, wondering how the hell to get his overly thoughtful boyfriend to fuck him hard into mattress
this guy to be just ‘cause he’s Hottie McHot Pants?”
Castiel heard distant clapping coming from behind them.
“Almost ready.” Castiel moved his fingers in a circle, while leaving sloppy kisses on Dean’s neck. “I’ve got you, love.”
“How’s the book?” Castiel whispered, one hand reaching down and caressing Dean’s lower back.
A particularly strong thrust into Dean’s crack makes them grasp each other tighter. “I’m not sure I can do that spell. I didn’t even know it existed until you told me,” Castiel points out.
“Just…stop. Okay?” Dean stews angrily for half a second.
“So call him—the King of Hell or Fergus or whatever his name is,” Sam suggests, eyes lighting up with an idea. “Ask him out for another date—”
“That’s all you know,” Castiel repeats blankly, sarcastically, because that is
“I don’t have to do shit today but rake these leaves, give the goats their hay, tend the garden, then go the store and sell some eggs and turnip greens. Then get up tomorrow and do it all again. That’s my agenda—got it, Sammy? Hop on or hop off, doesn’t matter to me.” Finally, he spotted the rake leaned against the barn. He opened the gate, careful not to let the goats out.
“Talking,” Dean said flatly, ‘cause yeah, maybe he wasn’t the most attentive listener but he could follow some simple instructions. Keepin’ his trap shut—it’d be hard, sure, but he could do it. “Are you coming back first?”
his expression cold and guarded. For his part, Castiel didn’t flinch or look away. He tried to convey as much remorse as he could, simply with his eyes, but knew it wouldn’t be enough.
, to have family relationships that were rooted in acceptance and love…not judgment and hate. That morning he had permitted himself to imagine a sibling, a person he could confide in and depend on.
“Aren’t you a sight,” Dean teases, reaching his hand down to ruffle the alpha’s untempered bedhead. Castiel attempts to shoot him an annoyed glare, but Dean just beams down at him with a strange sense of joy, so he rolls his eyes instead.
Once both canoes were in the water, they all paddled leisurely, attempting to keep their boats together. Between both pairs Dean and Dorothy were the more experienced canoers, so they sat at the stern, steering each canoe and calling out the occasional paddle-switch to Cas and Charlie. Even though Charlie was over eager today—her every word was seemingly suggestive towards Dean’s crush on Cas, which was making him impatient and embarrassed—Dean did feel guilty about not being a very effective wingman.
“You’re a terrible liar, Cas.” He rinsed his mouth with water and walked back into the bedroom before Castiel could answer. Dean opened his suitcase, looked for his comfy pajamas, but was hit with sudden inspiration. There were ways of making Castiel open up, mutually beneficial ways, in fact…
“It’s nothing…”
It’s been a crazy fucking day.
After a few wardrobe changes, it was a red leather thong Dean was wearing, and Castiel brought it down to his ankles swiftly. Then his mouth was on Dean’s cheeks, biting and nibbling and kissing, and Dean was doing all he could to stay quiet. But when he felt Castiel’s hands spread him open, a tongue licking flat and wet against his hole, he let out an unexpected moan that had Castiel urgently say, “Quiet,
Castiel nods, draining the last of his beer.
Castiel quirked up an eyebrow, as if Dean was intentionally making a double entendre. He wasn’t—or at least, he hadn’t
“When I thought about leaving you again...I couldn’t.” Dean could feel Castiel exhale, the airflow tickling Dean’s neck. Dean’s hands gripped Cas’ wrist, rubbing his thumb absently, his heartbeat pulsing loudly in his ears.
“Do you top or bottom?” The rasp in Castiel’s voice the only indication that they’re talking about something deeply intimate. The way Cas’ hands are cupping his ass, always skirting the edge of slipping a finger into his crack, makes Dean let out a low rumble of desperation.
He exited Alfie’s car but asked him to wait in the driveway. He knew this conversation could go several different ways, and he might need a quick getaway if Dean chased him off the farm with a shotgun. Not that he could entirely blame him, but still. He scanned the area, looking for Dean. His eyes finally settled on the goat pen, and there he was—handling bales of hay effortlessly, shoulders wide and sheening sweat. The front of tank top was clinging to his torso, and his loose jeans were snug around his hips. Castiel’s mind went blank, his mouth fuzzy and dry. There was
The thought enters the wolf’s brain like a door suddenly thrown ajar and he whines audibly. He doesn’t understand. He can’t have a name. He’s a wolf.
“They are when they’re attached to a face that pretty,” the guy answers smoothly, leaning into Dean’s personal space. “Buy you a drink?”
There are ripples of questions, low grumbles of confusion, but Gabriel presses on. “Cas and I were never
So he just squeezed Cas’ wrist instead, maintaining eye contact and hoping his expression revealed how really, truly fucking sorry he was to leave this unfulfilled.
Castiel, for his part, was on-board with a short engagement. He was in his late thirties and had been seriously dating Dean for three years now. In fact, they had pretty much been inseparable since the moment they had met. If there was anything Castiel was sure of, it was Dean Winchester.
“I know,” Castiel says dryly. “You seem to forget—I had to entice you with sex just to discuss your feelings.”
“So, just to summarize,” she said, taking a long sip from her coffee mug, “you and Dean interacted outside of the study, though totally by accident. You kissed outside a bar, and now...”
He’ll win this. And if he doesn’t win, he’ll at least survive it.
Dean laughs. “It’s just a burger, Cas,” he says humbly, taking a bite himself. Damn, that is delicious.
“Okay then,” Castiel chuckles, gathering his arms into the curve of Dean’s back, sighing contentedly. The air around them is fragrant and sweet, their scents pairing together easily from the domesticity of their lazy afternoon, and Dean takes a long sniff into the fabric of Castiel’s shirt.
Happy New Year, everyone! This month officially marks one full year reading and writing Destiel fanfic, and y'all, I couldn't be more thankful for you guys. Your thoughts and comments on this story have been giving me LIFE, so don't you dare stop. <3
The familiar shade of khaki, the dark brown hair, the unbearable, penetrating eyes…
but the last thing Dean wanted was to sit with a stranger and talk about his feelings. Well, unless he could lay on a couch and just ramble. Betty Draper made that look fun as hell on
“That’s not what
“Dean,” he said, trying to keep the impatience out of his voice, “you asked me to help you with this. Remember?”
“Anyways, everything was fine, then...people were screaming. It was so loud that I assumed someone had brought a gun, so I ducked behind the bar, thinking I’d have to dodge bullets.” Leo frowned, seeming stuck in the memory. “Anyways, once I realized someone was hurt, I followed the commotion. And the guy...Aaron...he was bloody, and pounded in, like his body was struck over and over with a meat tenderizer.” He stared at his hands, shuddering. “The guy had been beaten to death, it was obvious. But we have no clue how. Security always checks bags at the entrance, and then the cops came and searched everyone a second time…” He shrugged, though he looked shaken.
“Just twice,” Castiel answered mildly. Dean huffed in disapproval, turning and looking for the ghost, his expression murderous.
Dean shifts uncomfortably on his feet, taking a step back. “Whatever it is, Cas, it’s cool. Just tell me.”
“Not gay,” Dean corrected, “bisexual.” He stood up smoothly and took the stool next to Castiel, carrying their shots in-hand. Leo smirked and walked to the other end of the bar, tending to other customers and giving them privacy.
Dean glanced away, fighting the spread of heat on his cheeks. He wasn’t used to compliments unless they were of the unclothed variety. “Uh, ya know…Ellen…”
Castiel wastes no time in inserting two fingers into his hole once again, and Dean wishes they had thought to bring lube with them, but Cas’ fingers are wet enough they slide in easily. Dean breathes through the feeling and concentrates on the pleasure of it, wondering when and if Castiel might find—
, he thought, but resisted saying it out loud.
Still, Dean struggled to pay attention during the Donna and Jody segment. Halfway through a realization had struck him—sudden and painful as a pinch. So far, neither of the pairs had been unveiled as potential true mates. So where did that leave him and Cas? Despite Ash’s confident assumption about the shared chromosomes, maybe he had been wrong all along and
“Love you, too.” Castiel places a chaste kiss to the back of his neck, then says, “Go on…put your hand in the bundle.”
“Dude, seriously?” Dean asked, rolling his eyes. “Metatron zapped all those pop culture references into your head—but still left out
Thanks to that train of thought Dean was quietly spiraling, officially aware that he wasn’t good enough to even be Cas’ friend,
walking and
“It’s Castiel Novak!” a woman answers with a shout, and then a chorus of exclamation break out across the room. Still standing under the yellow flash of the stage lights, the whiskey in his system making his cheeks flushed, Dean feels like he’s been slapped in the face.
Dean sighs in his sleep, reaching a hand out dreamily to touch Castiel. At the sight, all the rage and fury in the alpha’s heart begins to disperse. How could he ever risk this? He reaches a hand up to pet Dean’s hair, settling his thumb on the other man’s parted lips, incredulous that he’s allowed this. He peers at the alarm clock and sees it’s half-past five in the morning… He groans, wanting nothing more than to swiftly fall back asleep, but they have a pack-wide meeting in an hour. He thinks back to the night before, to the conversation and the heated exchange him and Dean were having before being rudely interrupted.
“Mr. Winchester—”
The icy glare Dean shot his brother rivaled even Sam’s iconic bitch face. He slid his phone out from his pocket to prove that they still had plenty of time, but...oh shit. Twenty minutes until show time.
Holding him.
“If you’re trying to become packmaster just to force us into another fucking war, then it means a hell of a lot to
They hadn’t laughed much after that.
“You okay, Cas?” Dean asked quietly.
If Dean had been in his were form, his hackles would be raised.
“You’re thinking way too hard, babe,” Dean muses, kissing the edge of the alpha’s nose before pulling out a wide skillet. “Dinner’ll be ready in about an hour, and don’t forget we’re meeting with that Fergus guy at midnight, but in the meantime—” He glances sideways at Cas’ painting equipment, shoved in an unused corner. “Why don’t you, ya know, tinker around for a bit?”
“That’s the plan,” Castiel replies, feeling so joyful he could burst. He knew Dean had been joking, but
This had changed everything.
Of who is
Sam chuckled. “Well, I don’t have you in
“We’ll never forget,” Cas replies, practically reading his mind, dropping the soap on the tub’s edge and cupping Dean’s face with both hands. “What your father sacrificed for me, for us…” He kisses Dean’s cheeks, his nose, the unscathed side of his forehead. “It was the most selfless thing I’ve ever seen.”
“What can I say? Night like this, a guy could get used to it.” Dean gives him a mischievous, lopsided grin, but there’s sincerity in his voice that makes Castiel’s heart swell.
“Oh, please do,” Dean said cheerily. “Our editor would just flip.”
“He was my publisher. Found my novel submission in the slush pile, totally unsolicited. I was just some nameless farmer from Tennessee but he liked my novel enough to publish it.” He sighed, feeling emotional the more he remembered. “That was the best day of my life, you know? Finding out that, not only that my work was worth a damn, but a complete stranger thought so, too.”
of crinkled paper. Now there was a large, Dean-sized space vacant on the desk. “Come here.”
“Oh.” Castiel nods sympathetically, leans in and kisses his forehead, squeezing his wrist. “Very thoughtful of Sam.” Then he wanders into the bathroom, stripping down and turning on the shower. Dean drinks the contents of the vial before he can think too much about it, before he can wonder or worry or talk himself out of it.
“Don’t worry. I have better plans for you…” A few seconds later he freed Dean’s dick from the panties, though kept them on otherwise, and brought his mouth down. He licked the underside of Dean’s dick, then took the head into his mouth and sucked. Dean cried out in surprise. “Cas, holy shit, Cas…” Castiel steadied himself and took the entire length of Dean’s dick into his mouth, moaning when it hit the back of his throat, then looked up at Dean as he bobbed up and down. Dean was staring down with debauched, hooded eyes, reaching his hands into Castiel’s hair and pulling tightly. “So good, oh god, Cas, so good…”
Castiel 3:02 AM >>
B) Modern Magic AU, college AU, enemies to friends to lovers
“Apologies, professor,” he grumbled, pouring coffee into two mugs and joining Castiel at the table. Castiel cut his eyes at Dean, but took the coffee anyways. By now it was nearly lunchtime, a little late for a morning jolt, but Dean hadn’t slept or ate much lately. He needed something to keep him upright, and figured his new editor might disapprove of whiskey before noon.
“Shit,” Dean mutters to himself, kicking the ground in frustration. This development is producing a whole laundry list of fucked up and conflicted feelings for Dean. He hadn’t wanted Cas to leave; in fact, he had spent the past few hours crafting excuses and daydreaming about begging him to stay, demon-drama be damned. And if the risk to the pack was just too great, then maybe Dean would give up his home, his life, his family, and follow Cas wherever he wanted to go. It’s a ridiculous and grossly romantic notion, not to mention totally preemptive—they hadn’t even kissed in twelve years, so the whole “move to the ends of the earth to stay with you” thing might be presumptuous as hell—but Dean has already decided that life without Cas is like living in slow motion. Not his family, rebuilding the pack, or even years of one-night stands could keep the fire lit inside him.
“I’ll do you one better,” he whispered. He pulled Castiel’s hands to him, knocking their plates together carelessly. Lips brushed Castiel’s knuckles, soft kisses pressed against his skin, and he gasped faintly at the contact. Dean looked into his eyes, unwavering and open and full of affection. Castiel thought of all the kisses they had exchanged in the last twelve hours—short and long, heated and gentle, all of them practically mind-blowing. But this kiss was, by far, the most meaningful.
, Castiel thought,
“Dean, we’re not here on vacation,” Castiel reminded him, nudging him in the direction of the glasshouse.
When Dean glanced up, Anna was walking to the microphone. Dean sat up straight, every muscle tense, leaning closer to catch every word.
John nods at Rowena, fixes his gaze back straight ahead, and closes his eyes. Her chanting increases, an aura of purple magic swirling around John’s neck, and eyes wide with purpose, she yanks his head to the side and swipes her knife across, breaking the skin with all her might.
He had also escaped here during the three-day period of Cas’ rut, where—after his alpha had literally passed out on the bathroom floor—he had reached into Cas’ pocket and called Gabriel frantically. By the time the overzealous beta had arrived, Dean had managed to clean them both up of any, uh, obvious evidence of their encounter, straightened out their clothes, and gotten Cas to rouse slightly and drink some water. Still, Gabriel had taken one long look at the pair of them and grinned wickedly, the scent of alpha rut and sated omega heavy as a toxic fume in the small restroom.
“What about the boxes?”
“You’re all fucking hilarious,” Dean dismisses their guests dryly, cupping his hands around his mouth and in their direction. He doesn’t much like being goaded or provoked—he’d rather be the teaser than the teased—but he’ll put up with just about anything to keep his situation with Cas in an upward progression. Sam has his medical bag slung over his shoulder, but Dean tips his head towards the back hallway in a covert,
At first, it’s almost comical to Dean that the witch seems hellbent on threatening the wrong competitor. She obviously hasn’t done her homework, or she would know Dean is a million percent more worried about Cas right now. But after her words sink in, fury burns like a flame in Dean’s skin. Is she really going there,
Dean spluttered, eyes wide. “Dude. You can’t just say things like that.” He opened his mouth to speak again, but sighed, taking a shot of whiskey instead. “Two of them are for you,” Dean mumbled. He took his second shot, then handed Castiel the other two. “Here, drink up, you damn greedy angel.”
“Dean,” Sam continues, voice shaking, “I just want you to know that—”
The answers pops in his head in a voice that isn’t quite his, but he doesn’t have time to suss out the mystery of how he came to acquire this knowledge. He’s about to be knocked off-balance and preyed upon by the stubbornly resilient vetala, but he lunges to his left instead, seizing the silver knife that’s planted in her chest and rotating it thoroughly. Her mouth gasps open and she slumps on the ground, her skin turning brown and flakey, her body beginning to decompose right before his eyes.
He feels a pair of lips brushing the back of his neck, and he relaxes minutely, trying to clear his mind. It’s too damn early to get this angsty—and anyways, Cas is still
“Please, Anna, put me out of misery,” Dean mumbled. He was officially at the mercy of whatever vigilante plan his friend had cooked up. “Do you have a way to get the fuck out of this mess, or not?”
“Onto our last pair, Dean and Castiel, who share an Z-chromosome 4.1.” Charlie looked at them pleasantly, smiling down at them from her podium. “Just for context, this is why good research practices include sampling the largest possible number of individuals for comparison. If I had just observed Dean and Castiel, I would’ve assumed that all unmated alpha and omega pairs with the shared Z-chromosome are…well. I’ll let them explain.” Dean felt his palm grow clammy, sweaty, but he just gripped Cas’ hand tighter. “Castiel, would you read some of the excerpts I’ve highlighted for you?”
“You have our word as journalists,” Dean said, and Castiel tried not to smirk at the comment.
His eyes abandon their standard shade of blue, flashing vibrant and rich and on the cusp of red. It’s an old alpha reflex, a show of dominance Dean hasn’t witnessed firsthand in years, and Castiel shoves John to the ground, growling in rage and blind with fury.
It was unfairly arousing to watch Dean bake. Unfair for Castiel, at least, because they were in Dean’s childhood home, in the company of his brother and sister-in-law, while all Castiel wanted to do was bend Dean over the counter and feel the tight, hot heat of his body writhing underneath…
“Hey fellas,” Missouri greets, short and feisty with a gleaming white smile. “Have to say, I’m a big fan of you both. Dean’s a veteran around here, but we’re excited to have some fresh blood this time around.” She gives Castiel another signature smile and he can’t help it—his bad mood lessens slightly.
Gabriel looked strangely disappointed, though his tone was dismissively chipper. “Hey, I get it. The bachelor lifestyle is hard to give up. If Kali hadn’t threatened me within an inch of my life to finally settle down, I’d probably be doing the same.”
—and he hated to be dishonest again. “I’m sorry to have behaved so unprofessionally.”
It had all happened so fast…the fight, the reconciliation, the rut, the sex. Looking back, Dean wasn’t sure he was okay spreading his legs before he even got to have a fucking conversation with Cas. But hadn’t he initiated things? The whole jumbled up order of things was starting to mess with him.
“It’s…uh…” The amount of things Dean can’t tell his alpha is really starting to mount up, but he can’t exactly explain that he’s holding an abortion-in-a-bottle, even though he
this whole thing is. He continues experimenting, licking and kissing Cas’ cock when he runs out of air, then swallowing it down again with renewed vigor. He wonders if Cas would like it as much as he does when fingertips gently stroke his balls, so he reaches a hand up and searches for them shyly, as if Cas’ dick isn’t already stuffing his mouth full. He lets his fingertips graze the sensitive skin there, rolling them around his palm as his mouth sucks impossibly harder, and then he hears, “Ohhhhh, oh Dean!” and he’s coughing, choking, come suddenly rolling out of the corners of his mouth.
“You do sorta resemble a…rustic wizard,” Charlie grins, biting down on a piece of bacon. Dean glares at her theatrically and says nothing. When they decided to host a breakfast at Sam’s house for close friends and family—on the day he got sworn in as packmaster, and then, legally secured a hot ass husband—he didn’t imagine everyone sitting around, roasting him and his cape.
grinning wickedly, and taps the spine three times. The book hovers in the air before taking off at top speed, and Dean claps his hands together, smugly whistling all the way back to his office.
His fingers skate across his chin and finds a small patch of blemishes and patchy, uneven facial hair.
“You really are insufferable,” Castiel panted, and Dean could tell by the tone in his voice that he was already close to coming. “Everything I tell you to do, you do the opposite.”
talked yet. Jesus.
Castiel growls, half-asleep and cranky. “If it’s the same to you, I think I’ll skip today’s showing.”
“I’m meeting someone,” Dean says flatly, resisting the urge to say,
“You haven’t changed much,” Bobby notes, his voice comprised of deep and disapproving grumbles, and Castiel can’t help but smile at the sound.
“You know about Chuck?” Dean asked in disbelief. He supposed he shouldn’t be surprised—just because Chuck kept Joshua a secret from the people he loved, didn’t mean Joshua was obligated to do the same.
emotion Dean was experiencing?—but his words had been accompanied by an action. A kiss. And that was one social convention Castiel completely understood. He smiled, nodding in understanding.
Dean was distantly aware that Cas was speaking, but it wasn’t until he heard his name—or, rather, his alias—that his mind wandered back to the case.
a library.”
“So...it’s awful,” he said bluntly. He was so
“You’re welcome.” Sam squeezes his shoulder, then releases his grip. “And it’s because I love you that I’m not gonna say
Castiel reminded himself, not for the first time, that Dean had only been nervous because he was revealing his own prejudice. Dean was just another straight, southern guy (an
“Perhaps we could do that when we return to the bunker,” Castiel says, every word measured carefully as he speaks. Dean’s only a little ashamed that the thought of a cowboy movie binge with Cas makes his cock give a little stir, because shit, combining his two favorite things just might make him implode.
“Hold that thought,” Dean instructs, standing to clear their plates and empty bottles.
“Cas?” Dean called from the kitchen, and Castiel’s eyes became wide and frantic. He dropped the basket and swung the armoire open, stuffing the evidence of his discovery deep into the back. He had just managed to shut the armoire door, hands shaking, when Dean rounded the corner.
you, but that’s my dumbass fault, Anna, not yours—”
“We’re okay, Cas.” He pinched the bridge of his nose and sunk back into his heels, thinking. “I won’t say everything’s peachy, ‘cause you know that ain’t the truth. But I don’t want any of this bullshit to change things between us. I just might need some space this week, all right?”
“Well, I do find myself without a job, so I’ll keep my options open,” Anna said dryly. “Anyways, Sam...look on page twelve, the section I highlighted.”
“No, okay? I tried, but it turns out most art galleries won’t post photos online. And I couldn’t exactly come to you like Balthazar and Hannah and whoever the fuck else from Lawrence High you’re still Facebook friends with—”
in the dryer, you know? And some things are delicate.”
The idea had come to him after the fire, when Chuck’s remains had been ground down to a powder. All he’d needed to purchase from Balthazar’s store was some oil paints, linseed oil, and texturizing gel, and he had produced a ready-made pigment of human ashes. Using a half-broken mechanical pencil, he first sketched an image of his father’s wolf form, but stepped away from the rudimentary drawing—unsatisfied. He felt as though he were making a painting that would impress the pack, not a piece of art that would be a true portrait of how
The elders are still speaking, blathering on about the next trial and the rules, but he’s had just about enough of this. Even if he can survive the next trial, there’s no way he can do it better or faster than John Winchester. He limps his way inside the makeshift tent feeling defeated in every sense of the word—his body is damaged and aching, his self-confidence is at an all-time low. He wraps himself inside in a threadbare quilt on the ground, and shivers in spite of the late morning heat. He’s not worthy enough to be packmaster. He’s not a worthy alpha, a worthy wolf, a worthy man…
(Dean has gone as Hatchet Man for Halloween not once, not twice, but three times) when Charlie asks, “What’s up tonight? Wanna go to the Roadhouse?”
his type because Dean doesn’t sleep with douchebags.
“Are you okay?” Sam asks, more softly this time.
“What’re you doin’?” Dean asks, curious and a little weary.
“What the hell are you not telling me?” he demanded, crossing his arms and leaning closer.
“What?” Dean demands, eyeballs practically rolling into the back of his skull. “What the fuck?”
He was totally mortified, avoiding Cas’ eyes. What the hell was up with Charlie? Usually she wouldn’t embarrass him
Stopping that train of thought right in its tracks—he is at
Obviously, for Castiel, this evening would be an exercise in constraint.
“Dean.” Anna’s voice was firm, hardened. “How many times did I ask you to
“Gonna get some air,” he muttered to his brother, crossing his arms and heading for the exit. He didn’t love the idea of passing Gabe’s rich, fratty, and apparently not-on-the-market brother, on his way out…but there was only one entrance and exit, and the guy didn’t know what Dean looked like anyways. He could avoid him easily enough.
Castiel was a strong and assertive kisser,
, close enough to spy on Jody sitting solo at the bar, but hidden far enough away that they’re not outwardly noticeable. Dean shrugs and polishes off his glass. He’s feeling antsy just being here, remembering the one and only time he’s been at this bar and how fucking awful it was, how that alpha douche had nearly had his way with Dean. It only makes him miss Castiel more, with a desperate sort of sting that he’s been ignoring all day long. It’s almost as though he can feel his alpha yearning for him, searching for him, and it makes Dean dizzy and off-kilter.
“Both,” Dean answers timidly, jaw set with tension.
The orgasm hits him with unexpected intensity, considering it’s just him and his hand, but the image of Dean’s hole stretching around his—
Castiel’s stomach lurches. “What? No!” He untucks his feet from under him, trying to get Dean’s attention, but his omega’s gaze is suddenly glued to the floor. So Castiel does something a bit more drastic to rouse him—swings a leg over, straddling him, wrists crisscrossed and resting on Dean’s neck. He waits for green eyes to find his, and though it takes a few beats of concentrated staring, his omega doesn’t disappoint. The golden flecks, the lift of hopeless in his eyebrows, the lip he’s biting insecurely…
The realization dawns on him suddenly, like the swinging of a sledgehammer. “He’s the one who suggested it. He brought you the medicine the morning of the second trial.”
“Yeah?” Dean says softly.
“Nah, it’ll go quick,” she said. “Besides, you have an...
There’s two minutes to go on the clock, and his hands shake, the gun in his hand swinging as he walks. He can’t do this again, he can’t leave Cas, he can’t, he can’t, he—
“I’d love that,” he said, and Dean beamed and turned up the radio. Castiel felt a little apprehensive about developing a personal relationship with Sam, but now that summer courses were over and fall semester was in full swing, the college sophomore was no longer considered Castiel’s student. If he intended to stay in Dean’s life—which was really no question at this point—Castiel knew that their relationship would require spending a good amount of time with each other’s brothers. Thankfully he liked Sam, truly and genuinely, and looked forward to getting to know him better outside of the classroom.
“Somehow that is…not surprising,” Dean jokes, focusing on the last half of her statement rather than all the mushy stuff that came before. He knows he’s not dumb, but sure ain’t Charlie or Sam or Cas level smart.
Instead, he’d be sitting in the same room with him for hours on end, never allowed to say a word…
By the time they sit down for breakfast it’s nearly eleven, and Dean has assembled a casual feast—not only pancakes but eggs and bacon and sausage.
“Just checking in with Eileen, Dean. Chill out.” Sam finishes typing his text with a flourish and then locks his phone. He glances up, looking a little indignant, and Dean shifts uneasily under the scrutiny.
Dean feels off-balance by the confession, spinning and dizzy, and he’s seriously annoyed at himself for making this anything but hot-angry-alpha sex. But it
It was sacrifice worth considering, maybe in a few months’ time. At least, that’s what Dean had been thinking
Dean was startled from his thoughts by the slam of a shot glass. “I’m going to dance,” Castiel announced, eyes bright and playful. “Maybe I’ll see you out there?”
“Yeah, yeah. Definitely—yeah,” Dean rambles, clearing his throat. When he looks back up, Castiel is tilting his head and staring up at him with wide, soft eyes. Dean exhales loudly, tightening his hands into the bedsheets. “I, uh, have a question for you.”
“Fuck this,” he mumbles to himself, deciding here and now to stop that train of thought before it goes any further. It’s tradition for the pack to attend funerals fully shifted, so that’s what Dean does instead, stepping out in the evening coolness in nothing but his birthday suit. He quiets his mind and reaches for his second nature, the feeling easy and natural, like stepping through a doorway that was already left ajar. It’s widely known in were circles that turning becomes easier the more often you do it, sort of “practice makes perfect” or whatever, and he’s been shifting almost everyday since he was a child. It’s an unconscious gesture at this point, inhaling a breath on two feet and then exhaling on four paws.
At first he was still half-asleep, but plunging his face repeatedly into the tub of cold water was enough to make Dean fully awake again, and damn, if he wasn’t terrible at this game. Those little fuckers kept floating away, just out of his grasp (or, you know, mouth), until he grew frustrated enough to give up completely. Of course Cas was magnificent at it, which Dean only admitted begrudgingly...at least, until Cas started taking off his layers. Cas unhooked his overalls and unbuttoned the flannel, then the undershirt, evidently sweating from the half-dozen apples he had retrieved. Cas was now naked aside from a very tight pair of overalls on the bottom, body glistening with water that trickled down his chin and chest…yep. Dean was now the biggest fan of bobbing for apples.
“We can take a step back, if we need to,” Castiel whispers in his husband’s ear. It’s nearing midnight now, and he’s hoping to steal a quick moment away with Dean, just to catch their breath. His groom yawns and shakes his head, rallying to restore his depleted energy.
“Dean, please—” If Castiel could just quiet down Dean, could talk some sense into Zachariah, then everything would work out...
“He probably wants to talk to
In the end, Dean does end up echoing the marriage oath, though he says them so quickly he think he might burst. Cas, for his part, looks absolutely absorbed at every word stumbling from Dean’s mouth. They exchange rings, gold for Dean and silver for Cas (luckily wolves aren’t bothered by silver that’s outside the body, only inside). During the exchange, Pamela recites an ancient prayer for lasting love and fertility from a Gaelic verse.
The alpha scrubs an absent hand against his face and sighs.
“I really do,” Anna said. “And I have the perfect person in mind—Castiel Novak. He’s a great editor and a co-worker of mine. I’ll book his flight right now.”
Dean grimaces. He’s been reading
What the fuck.
“Do you mean that?” he asked, trying to keep the hope out of his voice. While Dean was clearly fine with the new physical aspects of their relationship, there was still a possibility that he considered Castiel just a hook-up, someone passing through that he could explore his sexuality with. If that was what Dean wanted, Castiel was willing to put on a brave face and deal with the consequences later. Anything to be with Dean, even temporarily.
“We need to splint your hand still,” he groans, annoyed at himself for forgetting. Castiel has removed the makeshift dressing and it’s swollen and red.
“And just to be clear, I’m not angry that you took care of it.” He glances at Dean, who only nods in understanding, and the held breath in the alpha’s lungs seems to deflate. “You made the right decision for us, no matter how difficult. I’m proud of you for being so strong.” In fact, Castiel thinks, Dean is almost always cool and quick-witted in a crisis. It’s one of the many admirable traits his future mate possesses.
“Not really…I dunno.” But Dean
“I already told you,” Anna said absently, sitting between Sam and Cas at the table and digging into her briefcase. “We’re rescuing you.”
“Hashtag hot omega sex,” he jokes, then frowns immediately, as if there’s a bad taste in his mouth. He should really, really never try to use a hashtag again.
and Cas?” Dean repeated. He was aware of how he sounded—territorial, desperate, whatever. He would deal with Sam’s teasing later. But he hated hunting with Cas if they had to split up. Sam had been a hunter his whole life, and was probably the best hunter living (apart from his badass older brother, of course). But Cas had always seemed more vulnerable. Angelic superpowers aside, Cas was too hasty, too eager to sacrifice himself. No way Dean would leave him during a potentially life-or-death situation—especially not now, with so much left unsaid.
“Dean,” Castiel said gravely, after reading the sign, “I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.”
“Regularly,” Dean said dryly.
“Tomorrow is…” Dean cleared his throat and glanced down at his hands, watching the smudged imprint the pads of his fingers left on the glass. Nobody but Sam and Charlie knew about the case study, and though Dean certainly trusted Ellen with this unusual information, it was still too fresh, too raw, to talk about just yet. “Basically, it’s gonna be our first chance to talk.
“Ditto,” he says, winking, some of his standard bravado seeming to return.
Of course he is.
He had never wanted to meet anyone more.
Cas freed his hand from Dean’s grip, eyes flashing indignantly. “That’s another thing. Why would you talk to Sam about this before you talked to me?”
for years. The series was based loosely on his childhood: in the books, a young widow named Mary Campbell travels across the country, hunting down the demon that killed her husband. Meanwhile, she’s raising her two sons, Luke and Mike (short for Lucifer and Michael, biblical names Dean found appropriate in this universe) to become supernatural hunters. Luke and Mike were already in their twenties by the start of the first book, and once Dean finally relented and joined Charlie for NaNoWriMo, he realized how similar the characters were to him and Sam. Luke was smart and skeptical, but kind and compassionate. Mike was headstrong and stubborn, but loyal and brave. Dean had written his family into his fantasy world without even trying.
Jess was standing on the porch now, talking loudly to a stocky, muscular man. He had dark hair, a beard, and a wool coat on. When he spotted Dean, his eyes turned wide and warm, clearly checking him out. Two weeks ago Dean might’ve been flattered, maybe even considered him a decent candidate in taking Dean’s metaphorical, gay “virginity.” But now…
“And Bobby,” Cas repeated. He turned in his seat, knees absently brushing Dean’s. “Well, that’s only two people, Dean. Nothing to worry over. And if I’m not mistaken, they legally
He felt the omega’s body trembling when the tip of his tongue approached his entrance, and it was tight, unbelievably tight and velvety and hot on his tongue. Dean began pushing back against his tongue, begging, “More Cas, gimme more,” so Castiel obliged, somehow keeping his face buried in Dean’s ass while wetting his pointer finger. He fingered the omega open, circling the tight space before inserting the first knuckle, still licking the border that dripped with slick and spit. Dean moaned unabashedly and thrashed above him, vocal in need just like the alpha had always imagined he would be. The second finger tested Cas’ patience immensely, watching the stretch of Dean’s glistening and needy hole be filled and stretched. With a sight like that he knew he wouldn’t last long, but Dean was quivering and wobbly with desire within minutes, dick erect again and fucking himself against Cas’ fingers.
“Dean,” Castiel breathes, more of a moan than a fully comprehensible word, and Dean answers by taking him back into the hot, wet heat of his mouth. Castiel’s hips buck up involutionary, and Dean puts as much force as he can muster into holding the other man’s hips down as his mouth sucks and licks and teases. He loves the sounds Castiel is making above him—he’s never been with someone so unashamed of sex, so unreseved in showing his appreciation. “Gorgeous, Dean, so good. Oh, baby, you’re so good. I’m so close…”
“Hey, what if...” Sam paused, seeming to consider the best way to word his thoughts. Unfortunately his hesitation only set Dean on edge. Sam was only cautious if he was suggesting something Dean would normally want to avoid... “To help you get over this mystery dude, what if I set you up with someone?”
Castiel was still shaking, still grinning wide and grand and outlandishly, by the time they crossed the threshold and entered the cabin. He tightened his grip on Dean’s hand and pulled him closer, lugging him sideways and kissing his cheek, his chin, his temple. For the past hour they hadn’t been able to stop touching, stealing spontaneous kisses at every opportunity, laying hands on each other’s backs and arms and elbows. Castiel wanted nothing more than to whisk Dean away to their bedroom and spend the rest of the evening—the rest of the week, maybe—slowly taking his boyfriend apart. No, not boyfriend.
He could only pray that Cas was in bed, sleeping it off. He gripped the steering wheel tight, imagining all the other scenarios.
Dean only nodded dimly, unsure what to say next. Castiel was full of surprises today, that was for damn sure. Did he
Dean tugged at the starched fabric currently imprisoning his arms, feeling sweaty and unsettled. He looked at Jess, wondering the softest way to delivery this news. “Uh, no offense to your cousin or whoever you borrowed this from, but…”
Is it enough to redeem John in his eyes?
was picturing Cas beside him. His lips, his eyes, his hands wandering down Dean’s abdomen, teasing and searching for...nope, hold up. No way he was gonna pop a boner in the middle seat, wedged between little old ladies. He needed to think of something else, but every other part of his life was too depressing—the Zachariah situation, the fact that him and Cas lived on two separate ends of the country and hated the other’s cities. Maybe they could compromise, pick somewhere in the middle? Cas would look fucking good as a Colorado rock-climber, or a Wyoming rancher…
Castiel 2:37 AM >>
—and while it’s true, part of Dean has barely registered that fact. This isn’t just some guy, this is his fierce and goofy and sexy and adorable angel. He doesn’t necessarily want to test this theory because Castiel is hot as hell, but he knows he would’ve fallen for Cas regardless of the vessel he took. “I, um…yeah. Hell yeah.”
Ash, in his wandering drawl of an accent, began with the basics—biological stuff about secondary gender that Dean had learned in grade school. It was widely known that everyone’s genetic makeup had the possibility of containing X or Y chromosomes, but fully-presented alphas and omegas have a rarer chromosome that betas don’t have—the Z-strand. According to a dozen scientific studies Ash quoted that Dean couldn’t make heads or tails of, there were literally hundreds of specific strands possible between the genders of alphas and omegas. The correlation between the Z-strand and successful mating was still incredibly variable, but supposedly, the closer and exact number of a strand could project a higher probability of mating. It dawned on Dean before Ash or Charlie actually confirmed it—this was the only reason he had been paired up with Castiel to begin with.
When the blood ritual is done Castiel puts his hand in a fist, probably hoping to stop the blood flow. Before he even realizes the immensity of the act or what the hell it may mean, Dean licks a flat tongue across the open wound. Castiel’s breath is labored above him, clearly stunned, because they both know blood sharing is sacred among weres and deeply evokes a mating ritual. But there are slight healing properties in Dean’s were form, even in his salvia—it’s part of the reason that weres heal so quickly—and the incessant burn of the cut has decreased considerably by the time Dean has licked and swallowed every sloppy drop.
She holds up three fingers dutifully. “I swear on the Girl Scout Law.”
He moans instinctively, louder than he would ever expect when having semi-public sex in a field, and he tenses up when Cas’ tongue laps him again. His slick is starting to trickle, damp and pleasant, and he cradles his head and pushes his ass further towards the sky. He’s gotten rimmed before, by a few others and by Cas himself, but this feels—different. Wilder. It’s not quite as skilled, seeing as Cas is lacking fingers and thumbs at the moment, but it’s sloppy and heady and carnal in a way he’s never experienced. He cranes his neck into a more comfortable position and reaches his arms backwards, separating his cheeks for better access, and suddenly that unbelievably wide wolf tongue is
wondering.”
“I…we…” Dean stared at him, blinking and sputtering, unconvinced he had heard this guy correctly because
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel replied, just as quietly. Unlike Anna, Cas hadn’t waltzed right in like he owned the damn place...which was ironic, since Castiel had practically lived here for a month. Dean felt his cheeks grow pink, thinking about how they had cuddled on the couch watching TV, made-out mercilessly in the kitchen while cooking supper, went through Dean’s panty drawer to pick out Cas’ favorites before running back to the bed and breakfast and stripping their clothes and…
The minute the doorway is open, the book zips through the threshold and lands on Dean’s empty lap. It’s a book called
There was a pause, uncomfortable and quiet, before Zachariah leaned against the table. “Mr. Winchester—”
“Yeah, it’s, uh, fine,” Dean says dismissively, sliding his bookmark in to hold his place. “Just my required readin’.”
“An alpha, asking permission?” Dean couldn’t help it—he grinned and shook his head teasingly. “Hell yeah you can. ‘Long as you can come across this desk so I can get my hands on you, good and proper.”
“We welcome you
had been like an unspoken inch under Castiel’s skin, a song he couldn’t quite get out of his head. He had never wanted to rush Dean, to push him into making a commitment he wasn’t ready for. But they had known each other for five months, and spent every waking moment they could together, and Charlie had practically proclaimed them soulmates in front of two hundred people, and—
Sam wrinkles up his nose, confused. “Huh?”
“I think he’s going into shock,” Sam announces clinically. “He’s lost a lot of blood…”
of them? Maybe he should just stay a wolf after all. It would be simpler for him, for Dean, for the entire pack…
“I didn’t ghost you,” Dean said defensively. “I sent you some emails.”
Sam smirked. “Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.” He went to the cabinets and started gathering bowls and utensils, setting the kitchen table. “And don’t think I didn’t catch your little comment about bro bonding. Jess wants to go visit her mom soon, so once you’re finished with the book, we’ll have a weekend of pizza and beer. Got it?”
He starts the water, grabs a towel, and tosses his loungewear into a vague, somewhat-clean-somewhat-dirty pile for later.
“Rowena?” Dean says tersely, elbows spreading wide on the counter, abandoning the whole don’t-draw-attention-to-himself thing because
“You look handsome,” Jess corrected kindly, and Dean groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. As he paced around, deliberating on what to do next, Sam walked towards the door and grabbed his coat. Sensing her boyfriend’s intention to leave, evidently, Jess followed suit and grabbed her sweater.
, he reminded himself sternly. It was a strange slip-up, considering he strongly disliked NYC and the apartment wasn’t quite homey (in fact, if Castiel had told Dean he moved in two weeks ago, Dean would’ve believed him). But it wasn’t about the city or the space...it was about Castiel. Dean felt most like himself whenever Cas was around, like he could be a writer and a farmer and a dude
“What’s that supposed to mean?” he said, voice shaking. Everyone in the room was silently watching the exchange happen, but oh-the-fuck-well, Dean needed answers and he needed them now.
Castiel nodded eagerly. Dean scooted further back into Castiel’s lap, nearly on his knees. “Do what I do,” he instructed, pushing his boxers down and taking his erection in-hand. He shuddered at the contact, closing his eyes, and Castiel hurried to follow Dean’s example. Once his erection was free, he stroked himself slowly and looked at Dean...who was staring, open-mouthed, pupils dilated.
And then, two prolific writers in wild, reckless, all-consuming love…
“Shit, Cas…” Dean’s hands are grasping the muscular slope of Castiel’s back, all smooth and solid skin. Castiel ceases his ministrations for a moment and licks a flat, wet tongue against the nub. Dean watches the whole thing with what he imagines must be a completely debauched look on his face.
Dean glances up finally, trying to read her expression—but it’s carefully masked. He nods.
“You do know that, as my BFF and wingman, you’re supposed to help Dorothy
Castiel cries out.
As Dean’s boyfriend, Castiel was indignant and defensive and angry about the whole thing. Anyone or anything that could make Dean react like
And then it happens—the most awkward thing that’s ever happened to Dean, and it goes down in such a way that he briefly wonders if he’ll spend the rest of his life replaying the moment and wondering what the hell he was thinking.
“It has been challenging, at times.” The waitress poured their coffee and Castiel wrapped his hands around the mug, warmth coursing through him. She took their order and left again, winking at Dean in a way that Castiel tried not to feel jealous about.
Meg had a good point and Castiel knew it. She could be smart and perceptive whenever she let her guard down enough to show it. “I know it doesn’t make sense, okay? But I feel like I know him.” Castiel sighed, head in his hands, elbows planted on his knees. “I sound like an insane person.”
A family.
They decided on a corner booth, ordering coffee to start. After a few minutes of silence Dean eyed him curiously. “Whatcha thinking ‘bout, Cas?”
Castiel had never wanted someone more in his entire life.
“Stop staring at me,” he mumbled sheepishly.
Ahhhhh I apologize for the cliffhanger, but I'll get things settled next week! Come yell at me in the comments. :)
Castiel snorts, shaking his head. “How are you feeling?” he asks, thinking of the ceremony, the ashes…
“That was a tragic error,” Rowena defends, sounding somber.
He turns back while the water heats up, looking…almost insecure. Castiel couldn’t hide his astonishment even if he tried, so he doesn’t, eyebrows raised and panic in his voice.
But his train of thought is disrupted by a scent. Woodsy, sharp, sweet. Sage.
would make an alpha drop so easily to his knees.
“You and Sam do,” Castiel answered matter-of-factly, standing now in only his boxers and a tight undershirt.
“Try me.”
Still coming down from his recent transformation, the alpha growls and dives down, mashing their lips together in a ferocious kiss. Dean moans lewdly as Castiel’s tongue slips into his mouth, his teeth nipping on the omega’s lower lip, and they exchange messy, half-crazed kisses, writhing around as their dicks rub against each other with maddening friction. Dean’s hands fist fervently into Castiel’s hair, tugging hard and impatient, the strands becoming even more disheveled and dirty. Castiel breaks free to leave bruising, enthusiastic kisses all over his omega’s neck. He sucks and licks and kisses over the claim mark, completely unblemished now thanks to their supernatural healing powers, and Dean whines under the attention. Cas feels teeth raking over his own skin, and he lines his throbbing cock back up, both of them moaning with pleasure as he sinks into the hot, narrow heat. He lifts Dean’s leg up higher towards his hips, and the omega cries out from the impact of thrusts now assaulting his prostate. Castiel is quickly becoming undone from the shameless display of neediness from his omega, his cock slick and wet and painfully erect, and he pants, “Not…gonna…last…long…”
“Dean,” Castiel says softly, reaching his hand up to Dean’s fingers, brushing him away to leave the tuning knob alone.
Sam huffs lightly with exasperation. “Yeah, I got that. I mean more…who’s holding the Colt, who’s grabbing Cas and Gabe? That kind of thing.”
“About you.” Eyes still trained on Castiel, he took a step forward, entwining their fingers together.
Castiel can’t help it—his eyes widen. “Hmm,” he says noncommittally, not wanting to give Dean the benefit of the doubt just yet. “Well, unfortunately for Dean, that’s not an inaccurate assessment.”
“You, bent over the table.” At those words, Dean’s stomach did a flip. Was he about to get fucked from behind on Cas’ kitchen table and
Dean pulled away sheepishly, throwing the crumbled napkins into a nearby trash can. “A nervous habit,” he admitted, stuffing his hands in his back pockets. He cleared his throat, trying to regain his composure. “I’d still really like to have our meeting if you’re willing...but if not, I understand.”
Dean chuckled to himself at the image and Cas legitimately beamed, as if Dean’s laugh was the best thing since sliced freakin’ bread. Really, this whole thing was getting too cute to put on display for the whole anthropology department—and his baby brother. He needed to not have a bunch of eyes on him as he processed everything that was happening between them.
“Once I get the bullet out, he’ll start healing immediately and feel a
“Well, the way I see it,” Zachariah began flippantly, as if they were debating something subjective and frivolous, “Castiel may find it romantic at first…maybe he’ll even love you for it. But he will eventually resent you. In this scenario, he lost his career because you were too proud to compromise—any idea what that does to a relationship? Here’s a hint. You eventually break-up. Afterwards, he works a soul-crushing job but still can’t afford his rent. Maybe he becomes homeless again. Speaking of—” Zachariah’s pitch took on an excitable quality, as if he had just thought of something
The alpha snorts, shaking his head, and continues.
Castiel’s knot swelled up with such intensity that Dean choked and sputtered, spit dripping from the corners of his mouth, tears forming in the creases of his squinting eyes. He tried to dislodge the cock from gagging him but in the process, Castiel’s come covered Dean’s lips and chin. Once he recovered and breathed again, Dean parted his lips and swiped at the white hot stripes of come adorning his face. He was like a gorgeously obscene portrait of love and lust and want, and Castiel watched the sight through his blurry vision.
The thought left Dean stunned.
Joshua leaned backwards, outwardly floored by this development. “There’s nothing you can do for me, Castiel, except let me forget about Zachariah and allow me to live in peace.”
Castiel already missed the easy buoyancy of this morning. Now he felt weighed down, worried about what they would say to Joshua while also replaying the events of last night over and over in his memory, wondering if he had misstepped somehow. Twenty minutes into the drive, Dean nudged him with his elbow, then shuffled his palm and placed soothing strokes on Castiel’s knee.
Castiel nods dimly, and after a few moments of silence, adds, “He’s been helping me...prepare for what’s ahead.”
before, and felt a little foolish doing so...that was, until Castiel moved his lips from Dean’s thigh, then swallowed him down suddenly, stroking Dean’s cock up and down in rhythm with his mouth. Dean fought the urge to move, to moan, to shout.
“Morning, all.” Sam is cut off by Rufus, who’s stepping up on a milk crate so he can be seen by the entire crowd. Dean looks at Sam impatiently, wondering what information Crowley or Rowena could have concerning a trial that was ultimately forfeit, but Rufus continues. “We wanted to meet this morning because, traditionally, sunrise symbolizes rebirth and new beginnings. Or at least, that’s the new age crap Pamela told me whenever she scheduled this meeting.”
Cas whipped his head around, apparently surprised at being summoned. “Next spring,” he called, “
“What the hell does that mean?” Dean demands. “So Crowley’s your pride and joy? Cool, you two are adorable. What’s that got to do with us?”
“Right. Um...no idea, really.”
Dean 2:52 AM >>
What worries Dean is the inflamed welt in Castiel’s right hand, the break in the bone around the knuckles that Sam diagnosed as a fracture. At least, they’re
Sam 3:31 PM >>
“Yes you do, or I’ll hurt you,” Dean insists, but his protests are abandoned the moment he feels an insanely tight, unyielding heat surround his cockhead. Good god, did Cas really just put the tip in without as much as a warning? Dean falls against the mattress again, the effort to keep himself upright making him shake, and he cries out the lower and lower Castiel falls. He bottoms out swiftly and Dean’s eyes are screwed shut, every muscle in his body taunt, trying his damndest not to immediately come.
Dean looked disturbed by this development, but stayed calm, placing a soothing hand on Castiel’s neck.
Before Castiel could fully understand, could prepare for the overwhelming implication of such a statement, there was a rounded set of lips puckering taut and tight over the head of his cock. He cried out and gripped Dean’s hair in strained and desperate tugs, scrambling for any physical tether to hold him down. Dean tucked his chin forward around the curve of Castiel’s cock and sucked him down deeper, sordidly and expertly, using one hand to pump the root of his shaft. The sounds were sloppy and slapdash and so totally explicit that Castiel already felt coils of warmth retracting in his balls. Dean made unabashed eye contact as his tongue spun around the slit, looking at the alpha with long and fluttering lashes before sucking him down again and again and again. It was as if he was making love to Castiel’s cock, treating it with such eager fervency and reverence…and surprisingly, it was that thought that made Castiel tighten his grip in Dean’s hair, eyes fixated on the omega’s messy, ruffled strands as he shouted, shook, and—
“Don’t think you have to worry about that last one,” he says truthfully, but decides to demonstrate by cupping the alpha’s chin with his hands. “I’ve thought about this—wanted this—wanted you—for…” He swallows, finally having the forethought to pause, not wanting to overplay his hand. They’ve spent twelve years apart… What if Cas wanted him way back when, but after spending a few weeks with Dean 2.0, changes his mind? He was completely different before the war…cocky and fun, irresponsible and swaggering. And, yeah, maybe he’s still those things occasionally, but now he’s way more stressed out with his family baggage and a trunkload of self-doubt, plus a schedule of daily tasks necessary to keep the pack running.
“Hey, now,” comes a slick and carefree voice with a thick accent, “the wolves are adorable, it’s true… I’m tempted to take one home as a pet. But I’ve always heard the MacLeods were the most impressive pieces on the chessboard. Wouldn’t you agree?”
place. It was exactly where Castiel would go.
and then Castiel curled a finger in towards Dean’s belly, fireworks exploding through his body. He gasped and moaned and lifted his hands up, searching for something to hold on to. He pushed against the stiff pillows and they tumbled sideways, knocking the cheap bedside lamp over and probably breaking it, based on the sound of the tumble... Oops.
In the end, it’s the combination of his mouth along with a hand gently rolling Castiel’s balls between his fingertips that makes him breathe out in a rush, “Dean, Dean, I’m going to—” Then there’s come shooting down his throat. Dean’s not usually one to swallow, but damn if Cas’ spunk isn’t half-decent. He still has a little come in the corners of his mouth when Castiel pulls him up and smashes their lips together, kissing greedily, as if they might never happen on the opportunity again. Castiel rolls them around until he’s on top, and it’s such an abrupt and playful motion that Dean chuckles and smiles into the kiss, feeling so dangerously close to happy that it aches a little. Because this thing between them, whatever it is, it’s not going to be forever. Hell, forget
but the hot wet goodness of Dean’s mouth. “Check-out is in...thirty...minutes…”
“Definitely not having second thoughts,” he says huskily, honestly, feeling so drawn to this man in ways he can’t quite describe.
John opens his mouth wide, like he’s settling in for a long and well-prepared argument, and part of Dean can’t help but shrink back on instinct. But Bobby claps a hand on his shoulder and says, “Dean’s right, we’re not here to discuss his love life. Why doncha save the pillow talk for your next sleepover?”
“Of course I did,” he insists, almost pleads. “That was…” He crosses the threshold of the bathroom door and cups Dean’s elbow, a light and caring touch. “That was the most erotic experience of my life.”
He forced his eyes to leave Cas’ gaze, and there they were, both of their brothers. Sam looked gawky and awkward at the scene unfolding before him, so much so that it nearly made Dean chuckle. Dean was making out— rather obscenely—with Sammy’s lit professor, so he supposed the discomfort was warranted. On the opposite end of the spectrum, though, Gabriel looked terrifyingly filled with glee.
“This isn’t fair,” he whispers, eyes wet with tears, “none of it was. That all of you, except me and Father, that all of you were…”
“I, uh, was just thinking...” He scratches at his scalp, wondering if there’s some remaining shampoo in there that Cas hadn’t rinsed out. When he doesn’t elaborate Castiel doesn’t pressure him, just shuts off the water and they climb out of the tub, toweling off and not bothering to redress before sliding into bed. It’s barely past dinnertime, but they’ve both died and come back to life today, so they share an unspoken acceptance of their newfound lazy state. Dean exhales between the cool sheets and the alpha tucks on his side instantly, spooning him from behind and nuzzling into his neck. Dean’s nearly drifted off to sleep when he remembers…
“Mostly he talked to me,” Joshua said.
“So…” Dean cleared his throat, setting his glass down with a pronounced thud against the surface of the desk. It was late afternoon on Friday and everyone else had left for the day. Dean was scheduled for the evening shift, but Cas’ assistant had called him just as he was parking his Baby thirty minutes ago.
*grins evilly*
A few minutes later, when they’re washing each other in the shower, Dean can’t help but hum “Tennessee Whiskey” under his breath. He blushes when Cas overhears and beams at him.
“What would you
Dean beamed, shaking his head and grinning. Castiel plugged Dean’s writing at any and all available opportunities, and it was adorable and generous every single time. Where other couples might grow vindictive and unkind, fighting for notability in the same field, they supported each other voraciously.
“You’re doing it again,” Sam warned.
“Shall we?” Cas mumbled, and they clambered up the steps together. Castiel took the lead as they climbed a larger set of stairs inside, walking down the landing until Chuck’s familiar door came into view. Castiel had worried all night about having this conversation, but the gravity of
Dean inhaled tightly and didn’t answer straightaway. Then slowly, he placed a tentative hand on the back of Castiel’s neck and pulled him forward. “Cas, if you felt that way,” he whispered, eyes roaming down to Castiel’s lips, “then why have you been pushing me away all morning?”
“I gotta talk to Cas,” he blurted out.
Six hours later—after going home to shower and change, checking in on Sammy, picking up Lisa, going to the Roadhouse, then driving her back home, Dean was finally,
and sucked mercilessly on Cas’ tongue, pressing his thighs against Cas’ sides. Whether it was the heat of the kitchen or the heat of their kiss, Dean was lightheaded and sweaty, wishing they could just forget about dinner and take each other apart for hours on end…
Dean 2:34 AM >>
“Shouldn’t he be waking up now?” Dean asks Rowena, distrust dripping from his tone. “How much longer does he have?”
Dean rolls his eyes, kicks off his shoes, and joins his boyfriend. He falls into Castiel’s arms easily, head tucked perfectly on his chest. “I was thinking more like…we can hold each for the next century.”
a voice says in the back of his head.
“I’ll go first,” Cas muttered. “After Dean’s phone call last night, I suspected things with Zachariah were worse than I knew. Anna quit this morning, and afterwards, I confronted Zachariah. He confirmed the blackmail, we exchanged some heated words, and I also...quit.”
“It seems your room is the exception,” Castiel said grumbly, checking the screen. “This is Ellen. I should probably take this.”
Something about that doesn’t settle well with Dean, and he’s absently scratching at a spot of dried painted on Castiel’s shirt when he realizes why. “You were painting earlier, when I was asleep, but you stopped for me,” he says softly.
“Yeah, you did. I mean, c’mon Cas…” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes. “You really suck at goodbyes, you know that?”
“My protagonist, Mike, I...don’t know that I understand him. Something’s changed and I don’t know how to write from his perspective anymore, which is a big damn problem, since he’s the narrator.”
Fuck.
“I’d love to,” Castiel says genuinely, then pauses, wondering if it might be fun to fluster Dean a little. He drops his voice down to a whisper, thankful both of their makeup artists are having a loud gossiping session right above them.  “There are few things we left unfinished last night…in the hot tub…”
“Cas?” he asks, a little softly at first. Then he stands up, rubbing the back of his pounding head. “Cas?”
So far, his search had produced nada.
Castiel 3:02 AM >>
It had been the only proper form of farewell Castiel could think of at the time. When he had finally spotted Dean, he was wearing loose jeans and an oversized t-shirt (noticeably borrowed) and tossing buckets of water onto the burning drywall of the Harvelle home. He was so focused, so fearless in the maddening turmoil and endless loss, though he was just fifteen at the time. The sight was so overwhelming that Castiel couldn’t bring himself to utter any words—they felt too small, too meaningless.
There’s come all over them both—Cas’ fingers and lower abdomen, the front of Dean’s jeans. It’s a gorgeous fucking sight. In a weird sort of sex haze, Dean takes Cas’ hand to mouth-level and sucks and licks the come off his fingers, eyes unswerving as he swallows every ounce of residue from the alpha’s flat palm and slender fingers. Castiel is watching him hungrily, like he’s a crocodile about to strike an unsuspecting doe, and Dean is wondering if their recovery time will be
worried for Cas, but these fucking monsters are proving him wrong.
“No clue,” he mumbled instead. “I know you’re disappointed, and hell, I am too. But I really think
Cas chuckles and shrugs, managing to look in-control of the conversation even while he’s wrapped in a goddamn blanket.
Weird.
He forces himself to stay planted.
“Your crush…it’s cute. Really.” Sam’s voice was teasing, as it had been for weeks—the minute Dean had come clean about his new obsession. No, not obsession. Creepy stalker people were obsessive. Dean was just, well...
a smaller part of his brain pointed out,
“I don’t know who’s more distracting,” Dean mumbled, “Dream-Cas or Real-Cas.”
your number, anyways?”
“No disagreements here,” Castiel mumbled, and they clinked their beer cans, drinking in silence. After a while, Castiel told Chuck about his upcoming trip to Nashville and the frantic deadline to finish Dean Winchester’s book. Chuck knew Castiel’s history and subsequent hesitation to return, but unlike Anna, he didn’t press the matter further. “I’m glad you’re helping Dean,” he said instead, smiling. “As the publisher, I shouldn’t play favorites, but—hell, who cares anymore. Dean is definitely my favorite.”
“Well, what are ya waiting for?” Pamela yells, grinning. “Let’s get this show on the road!”
how to use, and Sammy always made fun of him anytime he asked for help. Mega-nerd little brother.
“You were on the run,” Castiel defends, though part of his does feel a little…jilted. He spent all of his adult life feeling alone, never knowing he still had a living brother.
*takes a deep breath*
His fingertips are grimy with ash when he finally finishes, and though he’s full of grief at the sight of his father reduced to grit and bone, he has the familiar itch to paint something, to zone out and create. He thinks of his small studio apartment in Chicago covered in tarps and easels and various supplies, and is struck with sudden longing for the safety, the solitude it represents. Wolves by design are close-knit and family-orientated, making someone like Dean the ideal were. But Castiel has always felt on the fringe of most groups, incredibly close with a handful of people but utter strangers to the rest.
are you doing here?”
“You’ve been...busy,” he mumbled, looking at the newly blank walls. He thought watching Zachariah empty out Chuck’s office had been difficult to witness, but this… It hadn’t even been two weeks since Chuck’s death, but Zachariah was already erasing every part of him from Castiel’s life. He took a deep breath, resisting the feeling of hollowness settling inside his chest. He had to stay strong...Dean needed him.
It was appropriate, maybe even predestined, that Castiel chose that moment to nudge against Dean’s hole tantalizingly, sinking in with the tip of his cock. Dean drew in a breath and concentrated on keeping his body relaxed, allowing Cas’ stiffness to sink lower, past the ring of tight muscle until he eventually bottomed out. The intrusion felt wide and thick but not painful, not after all the prep and the never-ending slick, and Dean only needed a minute or two before he was ready. And then he was begging for movement, for deep and unrelenting thrusts, and Cas happily obliged. He held Dean by the hips, practically growling, pulling out before plunging again. Dean closed his eyes and focused on the feeling—the fingers digging vigorously into his sides, the arduous rasp of Castiel’s chest, the hot searing heat of his throbbing cock pounding into Dean. It was an out of body experience, being with Cas—like Dean was rising out of consciousness and watching himself be fucked within an inch of his life, rather than experiencing it firsthand. It was the only way to prevent himself from coming too quickly, and he desperately wanted this feeling to last…to spiral headfirst into oblivion with Castiel gripping him from behind, tethering him to the present.
“Huh,” is all Dean can manage at the moment.
Castiel 2:24 AM >>
Dean has to get back home to his alpha, has to move John along before they’re both stuck here forever. It’s not even his Heaven but Dean feels completely sidetracked here, overwhelmed by the immensity of seeing his own childhood put on like a live action play. But this isn’t real, it’s a recreation of John’s memory, and they’re both getting
It’s a beautiful thing to watch. Cas’ second orgasm of the night shoots come all over his stomach, the sounds practically hedonistic as his hole clenches tight, tight, tighter on Dean’s cock. And then without warning Dean is coming too, filling Cas up completely. His gaze turns blurry as he comes, his entire world centered around this one feeling, this sensation, this act of love that he feels pounding in the chest.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says smoothly on the other end, almost like they talk on the phone daily. “How are you?”
“It might be enough to usher them into
“Glad to be of service,” he says jokingly and with a wink, but it comes off way weird, too much of a paid-sex vibe that makes him cringe visibly. Jesus, Winchester, get your shit together.
?” Dean’s cheeks grew warm and he ducked his head away, rubbing his neck absently with his hand. “That’s ridiculous,” he mumbled.
Dean nodded lamely, scrambling for what to say. “Mind if I call you Cas? The, uh, other option is kind of a mouthful.”
“So you, uh…” Dean breathes out, not sure why he wants to talk right now when they should be getting down to business. “Can I ask you a question?”
Castiel licks his lips, his gaze striking, all-consuming. “What’s that?”
“Me likey,” he mumbled, sloshing the remaining whiskey around the bottom of his glass.
Castiel chuckles darkly and looks away. Dean’s hands slip from the alpha’s soft skin, but the other man intercepts him, reaching for his wrists and holding him there. He kisses the inside of Dean’s palms gently and the omega gasps at the sensation, the deeply romantic gesture of it all. Without another word Castiel stands up, stretching, and walks down the unlit hallway and out of sight.
“Hemingway does have one of the most effective descriptions of a simultaneous orgasm,” Castiel noted conversationally. “We’re discussing the passage next week in class.”
Dean closes his eyes, wondering if he can no longer see Charlie, if he won’t be able to hear her anymore. Because he’s pretty sure that she’s about to say…
“And this is Fergus—”
“Umm,” he mumbled into the microphone. He swiped through his phone, scrolling through his Google Docs app. “Well, I guess I might have
Dean accepts the compliment with a smile, but doesn’t get what any of this has to do with Cas. “Thanks, Cas. But…?”
“From your perspective, Dean, wouldn’t it be ‘fuck me’?” Castiel deadpans, somehow with a straight fucking face, and Dean’s laughter is punched out of his gut.
“I see.” She has such a mischievous glint in her eye that Castiel can’t help but ask, “Exactly how much of your friendship with Dean is built off of blackmail?”
“Don’t stare at me like
.” The, but-please-god-no-details-of-your-sex-life is heavily implied. “But later. You know we have bigger things to talk about.”
He even cancels on Tuesday night dinner with Sam because he’s at a really good section, and his brother seems more amused than disappointed, telling Dean that it’s very satisfying to finally get to call
They begin to stumble forward then, still kissing as their hands reach for buttons and zippers. The only sounds in the cabin are their labored breaths and quiet moans and it’s driving Dean insane, whole body pulsing with lust. By the time they reach the screened-in back porch, Castiel’s lost his denim jacket and shirt, and his pants are around his kneecaps. Dean’s got the same look going, and he pulls away so they can kick off their shoes and finish undressing properly. It’s a little clumsy, largely due to their rushed movements, but then they’re both standing in only their boxers, eyeing each other openly.
He tried not to wonder what that might mean.
The moment of stillness between them had Dean sweating with panic. He had gone too far, been too honest, put too much on the proverbial table. There was no way Cas would love someone like him...
Dean 3:34 PM >>
Realizing now that he’s fully stuck in his own head, but not having the mental fortitude to push his complicated feelings into a dark corner of his mind and abandon them for now, he just shadows Sam and Charlie as they return to the living room. Cas, god bless his inner exhibitionist, is still just wrapped in that goddamn blanket and Dean is wondering if he ever intends to put clothes on again. Sam is filling him in on their training plan, which Castiel seems to accept rather graciously, and it’s decided that the unofficial Novak Packmaster Task Force will reconvene tomorrow morning. Dean leans against the kitchen island with a purposeful sort of distance, though no one seems to call him on his aloof attitude. There’s more chitchat, general talk of strategy, and an appreciation for Cas’ creative maneuvers in the arena—though no one is blunt enough to point out he still lost, no matter how impressive his decision-making. Eventually,
“That’s a lot to ask of someone you just met,” Castiel points out, stalling. He isn’t sure what Charlie is about to divulge, but if it has to do with Dean, he’s desperate to understand the core of the tension between them. “But yes.”
that would drive a ‘78 Lincoln Continental? Jesus…
“Don’t feel pressured to leave with me, Cas. I want this to be
Dean lunged forward, almost spilling his beer. “Dude, what the hell! You can’t just sign people up for shit without their permission!”
“Can’t let you have all the fun, though, can I?” He disentangles himself and stands, examining the space of the mattress as if it were a puzzle, then pushes Castiel down flat, stripping him fluidly of his boxers. The alpha lets himself be manhandled willingly, knowing that whatever addition to their morning wake-up call his omega has in mind will likely be…exceptional. He’s proven right when Dean straddles him backwards, and it’s only when his slick-covered hole is in front of Castiel’s face and there’s suddenly a wet mouth licking his cock that the alpha fully understands what a truly
“My best friend,” she replies, though there’s something in her voice, something familiar…
“Cas,” Dean moaned, fingers threading into Castiel’s hair and pulling. “Your fucking mouth…”
They were enclosed in Cas’ office, and Castiel himself was sitting in front of Dean wearing a full suit—though his tie was backwards, which Dean secretly found adorable. Anyways, point was that the alpha’s scent had permeated the small space, a sweet and bright mint aroma clinging to every surface, every molecule of the stagnant air around them. The scent invigorated Dean in a way that made him fidget in his chair, that made him want to jump and run and be chased. It was the instinct of an aroused omega, and he tried to suppress the scent, to prevent it from leaving the pores of his skin. He panicked, hoping his sudden change in demeanor wasn’t obvious to Castiel. He had wanted to seduce Cas, sure, but with confidence and swagger. He didn’t wanna come off as a writhing, desperate omega slinging his slick all over the first available knot.
Dean isn’t his mate, not
“Isn’t this one of your favorites?” Castiel whispers beside him. Dean looks at the screen and then shuffles on his pillow, craning his neck to look at Cas in the glowing light. The angel’s eyes meet his instantly and Dean feels like the air has been sucked out of the room.
He needed an excuse, a reason to leave again so soon and without any notice
Sam just grins, sliding his light jacket off and draping it over the chair. “Hey, Cas. Fancy seeing you here.”
you know.”
Yet...he grows hard again almost instantly, just thinking his name.
“Cas, for the love of god, if you don’t shut the hell up I’m gonna
The books on sex magic, Dean learns, are scattered about each department of the library. There are some in Speciality Fields, a ton in Eroticism, and even a few on the bottom shelf of Self-Help. Dean snickers a little at that, but supposes it’s not totally far off—it
“Yeah, uh… Got it,” Dean replied huskily, clearing his throat to regain some form of composure. An assistant came over and gave Dean a few touch-ups, the photographer and Balthazar came over to instruct them on placement and poses, and then someone came and took off Castiel’s robe and Dean’s shorts. Dean tried to keep his eyes planted anywhere but at Castiel’s naked body, clad in only a pair of obscenely tight black panties. The man was an absolute vision, and Dean willed his dick to stay down.
and he moves without thinking, circling the pyre and meeting Castiel on the opposite side. The elders glance down at Dean in surprise, but don’t prevent the movement, so he goes to Cas and brushes his side against the man’s leg. Castiel reaches a hand down to scratch tenderly between Dean’s tucked ears, which should be soothing, but…
“I can’t stop thinking about you either,” Cas said, breathless. “I’ve been so worried about you, Dean. These past few days have been…” He exhaled softly, voice trembling. “Incredibly trying. Without you.”
“Right,” Dean says, his voice tight.
“Yeah,” Sam agrees, stiffing a yawn. “If anyone can find a way to keep Dad and your
He slowly slides the finger past his lips and makes his way back to Dean’s backside. As soon as his wet digit touches Dean’s hole, he gasps and pushes back
“Burying” isn’t the correct term, of course. He’s been gone for so long that it almost feels archaic, the traditions that weres have upheld in their grief. Cutting down trees to make the pyre, igniting the body in flame, and the next day, taking the ashes back into the ancestral vessel in some ceremonial way. Castiel has options, he knows, but one way or another he will do this. He must. He could grind the ash into a powder, maybe ask Bobby to toss them into a stew or a pie until the taste is unrecognizable. That’s the polite, palatable way that many modern weres choose to consume human ashes. In his childhood he once saw an omega sprinkle them into a cup, pour in a hefty helping of moonshine, and drink the remnants of her deceased mate in one gulp. But Castiel can’t imagine doing either of those things, not now, not after so much time has passed.
long without shifting—the packmaster’s wolf form should be as easy and fluid to slip on as a silk robe. The exact opposite of whatever Cas’ attempt had been.
“Ready yet, Cinderella?” Sam jokes, though there’s nothing but teasing affection in his voice.
“Last time?” Charlie repeated, eyes wide. “Did you and Cas join a fight club in NYC?”
Which was why his latest job offer to Dean hadn’t exactly been a surprise: Balthazar was releasing a new line of lingerie based around two fabrics. Leather and lace. The shoot would feature two men, one wearing only a shirt and the other wearing only panties. The ad would read:
“Hey, don’t knock my girl Cher. Redhead queer gals gotta stick together.” She stuck her tongue out and he nudged her on the elbow playfully. She led him to the side of the stage and towards a large, black curtain where two strangers were waiting.
Only then—
“Dean,” Castiel whispered reverently, removing his fingers and craning Dean’s neck, searching for his lips. Dean kissed him back, using his tongue to tease open Castiel’s mouth. He already missed the feeling of fullness from Castiel’s fingers. “Fuck me, please,” he growled, and sighed in relief when he heard a zipper being dragged, followed by the rustling of clothes. Dean breathed into the brickwall, anticipating Castiel’s next move, listening to the familiar sound of lube being generously applied to his boyfriend’s cock. He felt the tip first, accompanied by a burning throb that didn’t feel too uncomfortable, so Dean begged for more. Castiel moaned and slammed into him fully, but stayed stationary behind him, unwilling to move until Dean had adjusted. Dean breathed through the pulsing pain, knowing the discomfort would be replaced soon by insane waves of pleasure.
“Oh, you Winchesters…” Crowley pulls out a chair, the sound echoing in the otherwise silent room. “Years ago, when I knew Azazel was plotting to open the gates, I asked my mother to
“Apologies, brother, didn’t realize I’d be getting a second interview today,” Benny chuckled. “I know it’s hard to believe, but I haven’t always been this cute and cuddly.” He patted his stomach, which was slightly round, though he certainly wasn’t out-of-shape. “I’ve been farming for two decades, tobacco and corn, mostly. But I know my way around.” With that last statement, he looked at Dean pointedly, the suggestion clear-as-day. Dean fought the urge to take a step closer to Cas.
Castiel pulls off finally, still pumping Dean’s spit-wet cock with his right hand, and grins. “I did promise you last night I’d make you come…”
home for the night.
Dean knocked on the door and squinted, shielding his eyes from the sun. Sam was standing nearby with his hands in his suit pockets.
Castiel was quite possibly the most gorgeous man Dean had ever seen. He was nearly Dean’s height and leaned against a brick wall, though not posing for the camera—just staring carelessly ahead. And Jesus, what a gaze it was. His eyes were blue, mesmerizing and impossible, with his eyebrow arched high. His expression was lax yet intimidating, as if he couldn’t be bothered with you, but if he did—you’d be in hot water. Jesus Christ. His hair was dark and his scruff was evocative as hell and Dean was totally screwed. How was he supposed to focus on writing with a goddamn Greek god looking over his shoulder?
The raucous ringing of another gunshot.
“I’ve got this one, Meg!” Tom announces triumphantly, pulling a handcuffed Gabriel to his feet and vehemently shoving him through the span of the warehouse.
An unbidden image darted across his mind then: Castiel—or Cas, as Dean had started calling him, though only to himself—being here. Sitting beside him, in Sam’s unoccupied chair. He would be wearing patterned blue swimming shorts, sporting dark and mirrored aviator sunglasses, and look hot as hell with little to no effort. Maybe he would scold Dean for not wearing sunscreen—it honestly seemed like the kind of thing Cas would nag him about—and even reach into his own bag for a hefty bottle of SPF 50. After some disgruntled teasing he would smear the cold, white cream across Dean’s neck and shoulders. Dean would get a sudden chill, even on this sunny day, and it wouldn’t just be because of sunscreen. Eventually Cas’ methodical and medicinal touch would grow deeper, more tender and intentional. He’d massage the tight muscle of Dean’s shoulders until he felt pliable and relaxed under Castiel’s hands, eyes closing, head tilting to the side. He’d hum in quiet bliss while Cas’ lips found the sweet spot behind Dean’s ear, the place that always drove him wild, and then—
The validity of that statement hangs between them, heavy and unanswerable, and Dean just hums noncommittally in the back of his throat. Truthfully he can’t explain
choice. That’s all any of us have, okay?” She stood beside him, gripping his arm reassuringly. “The freedom to make our own choices.”
He feels Castiel’s fingertips graze his calf, his thigh, his touch no longer just enticing and firm, but—warm. Lulling, quieting, magically so. Dean’s skin is flooded with warm. “Oh,” he mumbles, the tension leaving his shoulders. He falls back against the mattress, body heavy and pliant. Castiel uses both hands to massage Dean’s lower back, using quite a lot of strength behind each motion, and Dean knows this should hurt—his usual way of dealing with back pain is just to drink more whiskey—but no part of this massage causes him pain. Castiel’s hands are confident, self-assured and skilled.
“Dean,” Castiel shouts. “Dean, please wait—”
“Dad,” Dean breathes, and there’s a warning in his voice that Castiel can’t quite place. He gets the distinct feeling that Dean knows what this conversation will entail, but Cas has only
librarian, the one Cas keeps talking about.” Something like a smile breaks out on his face. “He didn’t tell you he has a twin?”
“I never did right by you boys, not after your mother…” He trails off, face full of melancholy. “When I lost my wife, my mate, my omega, it was like losing the best part of myself. The part that
“Don’t,” Dean says gently. “You were right earlier, and you know it. We can’t let our relationship jeopardize the safety of the pack, Cas. I got this, okay?” He bends over, kisses his alpha’s forehead. “I love you,” he mumbles, lips brushing his nose and cheeks and chin. Before Castiel can protest, Dean is standing and leaving, closing the bedroom door behind him.
“I dunno, Cas. Sometimes you’re...intense. Like a literal force of nature.”
Until there’s a stinging slap against his cheek.
“Of course it did, Sam,” Dean snapped, answering instinctively, without giving it much thought. “This is Cas we’re talking about it. He’s not just family...honestly, I don’t think he ever was ‘just family’ to me, you know? He’s...he’s…”
—disapproving, deep as a sigh—would become a tradition between him and Castiel. And it definitely was not endearing. Nope, not at all. “You have to practice self-care. Writing can be very draining, and if you don’t replenish your energy, you’ll get fatigued.” Before Dean could argue that he had never practiced any hippie-dippie “self-care” and was perfectly fine without it, thank you very much, Castiel continued. “Even more importantly, we need to discuss something you mentioned in your letter.”
hangs on the tip of his tongue and he reins it in just in time, but the damage is already done. Cas’ expression is crestfallen and Dean reaches for him, pulling the alpha into the hug he had been wanting to prompt for five minutes now. “Cas, I’m really fucking sorry. About your dad, I mean.”
“Since January. Actually, the day I met you, I was supposed to be moving into my new apartment. I was called in on uncle duty instead.” Castiel gives him a suggestive smile, the motion lighting up his whole face. “Luckily, it worked out in my favor.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“No, it has to be now—”
he thought guilty. Chuck sipped the water slowly, smiling in thanks. Finally, he said, “Dean is good a man. His writing process is chaotic as hell, from what Anna told me, but he’s very hardworking and dependable.” Chuck wrinkled his forehead, seeming concerned. “Which is why it worries me—him missing deadlines and having writer’s block. That doesn’t sound like him. I hope he’s all right...”
“I’d love your company,” he says to John tactfully. Dean glares at him in the dark, as if he’s made the wrong decision, but Castiel figures that if he can help the Winchesters
“Oh, let me—”
“It’s okay to be nervous,” Sam says gently. “If it were Madison, I would be out of my mind.”
And then, when he spots everyone around him, he gasps in horror.
She just stares up at him, knowing how uneasy he is but not offering him an olive branch of conversation.
Dean offers him a half-smile, gives his wrist a squeeze, and then he wanders in the direction of the bunker. Castiel just stares, standing there longer than strictly necessary, feeling strangely melancholy as he watches his boyfriend head home alone.
The next several minutes were a tense, jumbled blur—rushing back to his desk, throwing his trenchcoat on, emptying his desk drawers and stuffing his pockets full of pens and notes and papers. He gathered a stack of books and lugged them under his left arm—trying to ignore the throbbing pain in his right wrist—and exited quickly, walking towards the bus station on instinct. At some point he texted Anna with the news, then stuffed his phone to the bottom of his pocket, attempting to clear his mind. He was still shaking with rage halfway through the bus ride, shoulders hunched and rigid, staring ferociously at the floor. That’s when he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He took his time retrieving it, feeling drained and lethargic, figuring it was Anna. By the time he dug deep enough, rifling through all the random contents lining his pockets, he had one missed call.
“What’d we do now, Cas?” he mumbled, hating how small his voice sounded, how defenseless. But he he leaned into the vulnerability, opening himself up to Cas in a way that felt easy as breathing. They were together, they were safe. They would take care of each other.
“Jesus,” Dean panted, “you’re a kinky little fucker.” Judging by the hand snaking its way into the front of Castiel’s boxers, he didn’t seem to mind. On the contrary, really, considering he shivered once his fist wrapped around Castiel’s thick and swollen cock. “Still want you to fuck me, Cas.”
He stood in the doorway, looking at Cas cautiously. “Uh, hey. Whatcha doing in here?”
that make Castiel?
“Cool. Afterwards I’ll stop by the senior citizen center for some bingo,” Dean quipped, and Castiel rolled his eyes. They were huddled together around Castiel’s computer. Dean tried not to think about how close their forearms were to touching.
“Pie is a reward, you two.” Dean planted his elbows on the table, looking at his brother and sister-in-law, grinning. “Family members who embarrass me in front of my new boyfriend don’t make the cut.”
Anna raised her head, exchanging a look with Castiel. Neither of them wanted to be the bearer of bad news, evidentally, but Castiel relented first.
He stood at his podium now, staring blankly at the papers shuffled in front of him. He watched the classroom empty out, and with trepidation, realized the only remaining student was Sam Winchester. He was hanging hesitantly near Castiel’s desk, backpack posed high on his shoulder.
“Cas,” the omega says, voice both firm and desperate. He puts a cautious, calloused hand through the wolf’s mane, making physical contact and staring into his eyes.
. What the fuck is happening? Cas looks at the elders, who seem to be waiting for some kind of confrontation to occur between him and Dean. But when the omega is too stunned, and frankly, too pissed to address him again, Castiel says, “Let’s proceed.”
Dean can barely speak, because the stream of water is massaging his hole in a way that makes his whole body shudder. “God, Cas,
Castiel breathes in and out, doing his best to push aside every scent—every other alpha and beta and omega in the vicinity, even the distinct whiff of soil and grass and fresh air. He only needs one scent to keep him steady, one aroma to spread calm through the tight center of his chest.
“A packmaster and his mate do not lead alone,” Pam explains, once the cord is securely fastened around their arms, “it takes a community of friends, supporters, family members, and loved ones to keep a leader rooted in the earth, the moon, and most importantly, the wolf. Do you, Dean and Castiel, accept the patronage of your pack, promising to hold their welfare as important as your own?”
He started by describing Castiel—the hair, the lips, the eyes. He tried to convey the smaller things he had noticed, the upturned smile he gave with awkward uncertainty; the sight of his long, slender fingers clasped together on the table; the genuine apology and subsequent amusement on his face after Dean had tripped on the strap of Castiel’s messenger bag, stumbling clumsily in his race out the door. Good-fucking-looks aside, Dean already liked Castiel, honest to god, and he couldn’t understand
“Weird...you must’ve had an out-of-body experience the whole time Zachariah was being a psychotic asshole to me.” He huffed into the air, taking a step closer. “‘Cause from where I was sitting, you just let it happen. You didn’t say one word to defend me, Cas, the entire fucking time. Even Anna spoke up, but not you.”
“Someone’s here,” Cas says, stating the obvious, then adds in a snarl, “another alpha.”
until the song changed and the tempo picked up. Then they were both moving fast, too fast, until Dean was way too debauched to even make a joke about how much he hated techno. They grinded against each other, breathless and desperate, hands clutching waists and thighs while lips searched each other’s necks. Just when Dean thought he might
The front door of the house squeaked opened, jolting them out of conversation, and they turned towards the source of the noise.
“Not an option.” Jody slinks forward, huddling closing to the brothers. “Dean—the way you reacted to him—” The sheriff bites her lip, choosing her words thoughtfully. “You’ve obviously met him before. What did he do?”
That’s a very, very big
Charlie and Dorothy were standing up, climbing into their canoe. Cas, thankfully, was still sitting next to him on the quilt. “Dorothy and I are heading out,” she said.
Dean looked between the two of them and narrowed his eyes. “You guys should really get a room whenever you’re doing the whole, creepy-Avatar-tail-connection thing.”
“What’s with the intervention? I work when I wanna work, end of story. I don’t come into your departments and tell you how to run them.”
“Just a few hours a week. Is that okay?” Her tone was questioning, but Dean could tell she had already made up her mind. “It was actually Castiel’s idea.” Castiel shifted on his feet, looking deeply uncomfortable, and Dean would have smiled at how endearing it was...if he wasn’t so confused. He looked at Jess again, ignoring Benny’s eager eyes on him.
“Anytime. Though you know I’m a busy guy,” Dean said lightly, which was an understatement. Dean’s fame had skyrocketed in the last two years, and it seemed like he was constantly going from shoots to commercials to events.
His dad had never even gotten a punch in, which is shocking as hell considering how differently the two alphas have spent their lives. The only damage to Cas’ body was self-inflicted, unintentionally, since he clearly didn’t know how to throw an easy punch. There must’ve been a method to his madness, though, since John has a broken nose and three broken ribs thanks to one supremely beefed-up Castiel Novak.
Castiel presses against it again just as his tongue licks at the head of Dean’s cock, and it’s official, Dean is in fucking heaven because Castiel Novak has killed him.
“Anna, what’s—”
“Dad,” Dean whispers, his voice faltering. “You’re—you’re gonna be okay.”
“You did it again,” he says accusatorily, shaking his head. “Charlie, what the hell? You can’t keep telling me these meetings are fifteen minutes
“Castiel Novak,” Cas says, suddenly all-business as he reaches his hand over to shake Ellen’s. She chuckles but returns the shake, looking at Dean like he’s invited an alien into the booth to have lunch with him. “Nice to meet you.”
“But y’all are talking about me like I’m not even here!” Dean snapped. Castiel shuddered at the sharpness of his voice, and Sam glared at him. Charlie opened her mouth again, likely trying to diffuse the situation, but she hesitated too long.
“I don’t plan to tell anyone,” Castiel continued, head tilted down, trying to catch Dean’s eye, “if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“Yes, it is,” Castiel said, a little out of breath as his fingers touched the lace of Dean’s panties. “Almost as natural as seeing you in these.
Instead, he finds Cas’ trousers and boxers pushed down, pooling at his ankles. His hand is wrapped around his thick cock, the tip glistening with precome, and he’s right in the middle of stroking himself in front of the mirror.
Castiel hums contentedly. “I never put them in any gallery…it was just for me. A dream of mine.” Dean’s face softens, his limbs feeling light and airy. He squeezes Cas’ hands, rubbing their thumbs together.
Dean—seemed lackluster and gray.
to place a hand on Dean’s hip, to draw him closer, to lift his chin and kiss him—
The shock and awe was evident on Joshua’s face. Clearly he had expected Castiel’s wrath, but instead, was face-to-face with benevolence.
“Oh, right. I’m glad you brought that up. Let me read some of those excellent, eloquent emails you sent me.” Dean could hear Anna’s computer mouse scrolling frantically. This lecture wouldn’t be over anytime soon. “On July 23, I wrote, ‘Hi Dean, how’s the book coming along?’ You wrote, ‘It’s going.’ On August 8, I wrote, ‘Hey Dean, hope things are going well on the farm! I’ve missed your updates lately. Got any new chapters for me to read? Three weeks until deadline!’ And you said, ‘Nope, sorry, not yet.’ On September 1, I wrote, ‘Hey, it’s deadline day! Can’t wait to read your manuscript! Don’t forget to send it as a .doc file. Let me know if I can help with anything.’ You said, ‘Sorry, it’s gonna be late.’ Then radio silence for six weeks.
“Good,” Castiel whispered, and Dean shuddered at the command in his voice. Cas nipped tenderly at his neck before smothering the space with wet, languid kisses. It was unrefined and messy the way Castiel’s tongue explored every inch of his exposed neck, breathing over the patch of damp, reddened bites slow and teasing until Dean felt goosebumps cover his forearms. Castiel’s movements were jarring and forceful and in-
“Hmm?” Dean mumbles, eyes closed shut, but Castiel doesn’t answer.
What the hell is going on?
“Point is?” Dean says, fighting the urge to chuckle.
“No, nothing like that. But…well…” He tosses a dishrag over his shoulder, kissing Dean’s nose lightly. “Six pancakes is a lot. Like, two entrees at IHOP
Even if it does involve Rowena.
Castiel’s eyes widen. “That’s terrifying.”
“Laying beside you on a blanket, looking up at the stars, but never touching you…” His hand drops Dean’s dick in favor of caressing his stomach, his arms, his chest, in the softest sweep of fingers the omega has ever felt. It’s tender and loving and Dean shivers and sighs, both turned on and relaxed. “For years after that, I dreamed of us in that field. Of turning you on your side just like this, kissing every inch of your body, and finally having my way with you.”
“So,” Castiel interrupts, a flutter of anticipation vibrating in his chest, “if Dean can emit enough light from where he is, a huge and concentrated amount—”
as the third trial. She had to wait for the right day and time, but now she’s channeling centuries’ worth of power and magnifying her own abilities to open the gates.”
“Y’know, Jody said she found him just sitting on the train tracks,” Sam whispers, rather gloomily. His eyes are wrinkled at the edges, tired and drooping, and Dean hopes he doesn’t have to work later today. Sleep deprived doctors aren’t good for much, ‘cept fixing scraped knees and handing out lollipops.
“You don’t think it could be—”
Yall, we’re getting really, really close now to the end of this story…I don’t wanna give out an exact amount of chapters, because I always underestimate my wordiness (lol) but we are certainly entering the climax as we speak. So hang on tight for the next chapter or two—it’s gonna be an entertaining ride!!
“We’ve gotta find the object
nasty. That would honestly serve Dean right, he thinks, with how weird he’s been acting during the drive. Somehow, he’s already managed to screw this up.
the woman’s pain…? Fuck, Dean must be the dumbest son of a bitch alive.
“Or you could come back to my place,” Dean blurts out, horror settling into his bones the moment the words leave his mouth. Castiel looks stunned too, still hunched over his hardshell case. “Uh, I, didn’t mean—not like that—I just meant, I still feel bad about, uh, everything, and if you want to come have a beer and I could make us some food, I dunno, maybe that could be cool? No worries though, you—you probably have plans, right?”
“Oh come on,” Gabriel teases. “You two have been practically married for like, fifteen freakin’ years.”
Castiel shook his head, eyes wide and grief-stricken. “I don’t want that, Dean. I want you to have everything you want, everything you deserve…”
, from high school) reprogramed it, and released it for free. Or the long, drunken story behind her Princess Leia, slave-girl-bikini tattoo, which she had gotten last year at Comic Con. Dorothy and Cas were shaking their heads and laughing, but Charlie looked slightly miffed, as if those were stories she would rather tell Dorothy at a
The grad student pulled him down the hallway—out of Cas’ hearing range, if Dean had to guess—and opened her mouth. But Dean was not in the mood to analyze whatever the fuck amazing intense thing had just happened between them, and so he grumbled, “Can’t talk about it right now.”
“I’ll grab ‘em,” Dean says, bounding up the stairs again.
There’s the sound of shuffling, of yells and whispers.
“I have to,” he mumbled, though that wasn’t entirely true. It was terrible timing, but Sam had arranged a meeting to interview a new accountant for the farm, which they were in desperate need of. Dean trusted his brother’s judgment, so truthfully, this meeting was just an excuse to go home. He needed to get the hell out of this city. The noise, the stress, Zachariah, the memory of those douchenozzle homophobes beating the shit out of him…
Dean couldn’t empathize his way out of a paper bag—at least, not like his brother—but he’s pretty good at inventive, imaginative magic. He doesn’t like to admit it, but it’s why his biweekly storytime is the most popular event the department puts on. He’s damn good at connecting with children and thinking quick on his feet, and toss in some magic and a few good books, and Dean’s one of those rare twenty-somethings who’s already found his calling.
“That would be—” Castiel begins.
“Penny for your thoughts?” A guy in a gray business suit with a navy tie stands beside Dean. He’s sorta handsome, in a bland sort of sense, but he’s smirking aggressively. There’s something about his gaze that makes Dean squirm.
Dean’s first immediate thought is Dean
and that seemed to pacify Cas, the alpha flashing him a wide and gummy smile.
. Castiel unfastens his own jeans and lets them fall to the floor. He is less naked and more three-quarters dressed, but at the sight of his alpha’s flushed and hard cock, Dean vibrates with anticipation.
“Like I have no control over my emotions, my actions.” Castiel’s voice is ragged now, his breathing uneven. “Right now…right now I want to break something. I want to punch Sam in the stomach even though I know that’s illogical, that he was doing the right thing by helping you. I want to bend you over the coffee table and pump you full of my seed again and again and again, want to watch you get round and full and pregnant even though you shouldn’t, not right now. I want to kill Azazel with my bare hands, to feel his bones snap, to see his blood. I want to leave and never come back. I want to hide away in bed with you and never enter the outside world again.” He covers his face with his hands, shuddering. “I’m afraid I’m no use to you right now, Dean. Not like this.”
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, avoiding Sam’s gaze. “So not the fucking time, Sammy.”
It was exactly as Dean suspected: Castiel had been holding back,
He tilts his head, thinking hard. “About finding myself again.”
Out the window, he spotted Jess in a sweater and a bandana, pushing a wheelbarrow of vegetables. She was gathering harvest to sell at tomorrow’s fall festival, and Dean smiled ruefully, only slightly disappointed to be missing the fun this year. Okay, more than slightly. He really fucking hated to miss it. But only because he had wanted to take Cas, to carve pumpkins and eat caramel apples and kiss him on the ferris wheel like a prepubescent girl—and who the hell could blame him? He was in love, he was pretty damn sure of it, and he wanted to do all the disgustingly sappy things people in love do.
“Really? You veto Black Sabbath, but sneak in a ‘Who’s Your Daddy?’ Darth Vader edition?”
“Hey,” Dean complained, flipping through the TV guide, “sex isn’t all I think about y’know.”
“No, Cas, just let me say this.” He took a deep breath. “Whatever I said, I guarantee I didn't mean it. I say dumbass shit when I’m drunk—you can ask Sam, it’s what I do. So whatever I said, I was
At that moment, he spotted Sam and Jess sitting side-by-side in a booth, chatting with a man who had his back turned. The couple waved Cas over, and he took a step towards them as the third man spun around, eyes searching for the newcomer.
a not-so-secret nester, and his space is filled with comfortable leather armchairs and glass decanters filled with whiskey and very, very masculine throw blankets. He turns on a nearby lamp, lighting up the interior with a soft yellow glow.
And before he can reply, she evaporates into thin air—brisk and easy as blinking. Dean’s hand is left grasping the empty space the witch left behind.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean whispered, sounding significantly more ruffled now than he had fifteen minutes ago. “You wantin’ everybody in town to play connect-the-dot, hickey edition?”
“The first trial has officially concluded,” Rufus announces, “the victor, who defeated his foes in under six minutes, is John Winchester.”
“Actually, I was wondering why you’re alone when you could be warm in my bed,” Castiel says smoothly. Dean’s nerves settle a little for the first time in days, replaced with a racing heart and a goofy sort of excitement.
“Shoot him!” John cries, and Dean releases the hammer, hand firm and eyes narrowed. But Azazel is struggling forcefully out of his grasp, the alpha’s strength nowhere near enough to hold a powerful demon steady. Dean knows the difficulty of hitting his target has just expanded tenfold.
—and they practice shifting. The pain is sometimes too much for Castiel, the break of every bone distinct and unavoidable, and he begins to doubt that he’ll ever be good at this. But according to Dean, it’s all about finding the correct mental space and rhythm, so he tries to meditate before each shift, reaching back inside his skull for that place of corporeal stillness.
Dean bites his lips, debating every variable. “Bobby?”
“All right, Bobby,” John whispers threateningly, in a tone that’s on a different freaking planet from
Balthazar shuts his mouth and nods curtly. The driver parks the SUV outside the entrance and Castiel opens his own door, knowing it’ll irritate his entire posse but not wanting to be waited on. The past year or two of sudden fame has really messed with Castiel’s head, and he constantly has the urge to escape the limelight, to get back to what he loves to do—writing, singing, playing. He shuts the car door with a slam and both of his bodyguards immediately flank him. They walk through security easily enough, a few of the workers stopping to take his picture or ask for autographs.
“Fuck,” Dean breathes, looking at the sight of Cas’ body like he typically eyes a good buffet. “Did you really just use your mojo to take our clothes off?”
“Is this okay?” Castiel asks, his voice husky but even as he waits for Dean’s approval. Dean nods aggressively and then feels just the tip of Castiel’s fingertip penetrating him. It’s tight, and he wishes he had stretched himself out recently so he might be more ready for the intrusion, but the water feels soothing and warm and Castiel kisses him through any discomfort. Cas has a knuckle in and Dean’s cock hasn’t even been touched and he’s ready to blow his fucking load. When he feels a second finger, the burn fades quickly as the heat of the water engulfs him.
“But I might hit you—” he argues, and John huffs an impatient breath and shouts again, “Now!”
“Boys,” Joshua began, exasperation in his voice, “is all this really necessary?” He waved a hand between the three of them, as if their current situation was ludicrous.
There isn’t enough time for Cas to deal with them, so he runs for the blossom. As long as he’s by the flower, has it in sight, he can deal with the other monsters. His grace isn’t at full capacity, but he has enough to smite the first two that charge for him. He can feel himself growing weak and pulls his grace back. Three leviathan against one angel and a little run-of-the-mill kitchen cleaner.
Who was watching them?
“Not exactly,” he mumbled. “But we have plenty of time for that.” A whole lifetime, Castiel hoped.
“What’d you do there?” Cas whispers curiously.
“Sorry, gotta go,” he says, almost regretfully. If he can just stay on the phone with Jody forever, maybe Rowena fucking MacLeod will never reach him, the trial will never start, and Cas will never be put in danger.
“I don’t know his name, but they were obviously together. I thought the guy was cute at first, but once I realized he was taken, I backed off. He was your typical cub.”
He wanders through the trees, worried and desperate, his chest aching as he thinks about Purgatory, about Cas, about the last time they were here together. He still feels a pang of emotion when he thinks about all those years ago—Castiel pushing him away at the portal, punishing himself because of some bullshit, self-sacrificing reasons. And when he had finally returned, Dean had been too angry and hurt to do anything but want to punch his lights out. And even though they’d gotten past that and had a half-dozen more ups and downs over the years, they had never shared that same intimacy again—not like they did on their last night together in Purgatory.
Goddamn it all to hell.
Dean was stupidly excited for his brother. He knew Sam and Jess would make fantastic parents—they were both such intelligent, kind, resourceful people. But there was another side of Dean that was deeply insecure and worried, realizing he would have to move out now so the second bedroom in the farmhouse could be converted into a nursery. Sam hadn’t asked yet—Jess was barely eight weeks pregnant—but Dean would have to start looking into other options. Maybe renting his own house nearby? Or getting an apartment in the city? His real dream, of course, was to build a cabin on the property. But he had always pictured himself with a family there, not living alone.
The petite but commanding werewolf directs Castiel to sit on the couch, watching as he gulps down the strange brown concoction, wincing at the taste. Another flash of annoyance surges through Dean—stupid witches and their stupid potions. Why can’t they just…
“Y’all spend a lot of time together?” he asked curiously.
Dean 3:20 AM >
Sam and Dean exchanged a glance, wondering how much to tell her.
Dean was already standing, shoulders shaking from anger before Sam could finish his sentence. The thought of being around another man, another alpha, was making Dean feel sick. “I told you I didn’t want this,” Dean hissed, unable to keep the irritability from accentuating every word. “What the fuck, Sammy?”
“Meaning?” Bobby asks flatly.
Right now, he has to be the kind of alpha his father would be proud of.
“Fine. Guess I’m the weirdo around here cause I don’t wanna watch Cas strip tease. Whatever. I’m just gonna be...outside. I think Baby needs, um, something or another. I’ll meet you outside whenever you’re not...you know. Naked.” Dean gave Castiel a final nervous glance and closed the door behind him.
The wolf loses track of time. It’s common in this form, considering the nocturnal nature of a were, and eventually, wandering the forest with only the cover of night becomes instinctual to him. He forgets his senses aren’t always this sharp, penetrating and strong. He can hear six miles in either direction, can pinpoint every rustling leaf as it falls from a branch, can sense the sway of grass before he even grazes it. He doesn’t need to eat much, his stomach stays fuller longer as a wolf, but he makes a handful of fresh kills just to taste the blood. Iron twang, bitter salt. He revels in it all, the warmth of the meat that he chews, the strained muscle of rabbits and deer still tight from terror.
“Yeah?” Dean asks edgily, on the verge of saying snarky but stops himself.
The thought of Dean’s throat made Castiel’s eyes wander, and
“I knew you were having personal issues, but this…” Castiel shook his head in aggravation. “There’s a lot of things I could fix, but a straight man being homophobic isn’t one of them.”
“You misunderstand me, Dean.” Castiel still hadn’t released Dean’s wrist—his long fingers burning hot against Dean’s skin. “I’m not firing you, I’m just...trying to figure you out.”
in this way, during a student conference no less.
Dean suddenly closed the space between them, lunging forward and wrapping his hands around Castiel’s neck. He swung his leg over Castiel and kissed him firmly, insistently, crushing their lips together in a surge of adrenaline. Castiel was flustered, head spinning, as he realized how chaste their previous kiss had been by comparison. Moments later, Dean flicked the tip of his tongue into Castiel’s mouth, withdrawing coyly before Castiel could react.
Dean looks embarrassed to have been spotted, the laughter dying off his face immediately as he takes in the hard lines of Castiel’s pursed lips. He’s not sure what the hell sort of game Dean is trying to play, but Castiel has zero interest in playing nice with someone so dismissive and rude. He glares at him openly, taking a sip of his bottled water without blinking.
he couldn’t help but begin to tense up.
“Alright, alright,” he says, waving his free hand around to get his rowdy ass family to settle down, “seriously, thanks everyone.” By the time silence is achieved, everyone is looking at him expectantly…even Cas…so Dean takes a deep breath and thinks, what the hell? If he can’t be sappy today of all days, then when
Dean didn’t know what had possessed him, but suddenly, he was standing in the kitchen pouring coffee for a guy that—only twenty minutes ago—he was convinced he hated. Wait, he did still hate Castiel. Right? I mean, sure, the guy had apologized and tried to bond with Dean by sharing his coming-out story. Which had prompted Dean to have an internal freak-out in his head—
“In case the message wasn’t clear,” he growled, rolling up the sleeves of his button-up in haphazard jerks and stomping towards the door, “I quit.”
He lets out a litany of swears when Castiel’s mouth tightens around the head, sucking Dean’s dick into his tight, hot mouth as he continues finger fucking Dean.
“We gotta get back, Dean. There’s no time to explain. But he is. He really fucking is. And he’s helpful and dreamy, so—” She searched Dean’s face, apparently summoning the right words of motivation. “Nut up, Winchester!”
“Your lips.” Dean stepped closer to get a better look. His foot was nudging Cas’s, their knees touching. “They’re all red and chapped. Mine only look that way after…you know...”
His short window for dealing with their unprotected forest sex has long expired, he abruptly remembers. But he hasn’t had any time to ponder it further, to freak out or feel excited by the prospect of starting a family so soon. But, for the first time in a long time, the possibility of bringing a new Novak into the world doesn’t
“What happened to you, Zachariah?” Castiel’s voice was quiet and small...though not from lack of anger. If anything, in this moment, he felt pity. “You grew up with a father who loved you, you had a home filled with love...”
“Hilarious,” Dean deadpans in their direction, and to prove he’s fully capable of hearing and saying the “C” word, he adds, “I bet
“It’s just early,” Dean said irritably. “Or have you forgotten that Cas and I were at the club...or
to answer this, but…” He bites his lip, thinking. “If you knew Dad might have an actual good reason to start up the Demon War again, why did you and the elders beg Cas to run against him?”
“Yes,” he said without a trace of doubt, and then more breathlessly, voice trembling, “Yes, alpha.”
“Thank you, Dean,” the alpha says soberly. He pulls away but Dean still has a hand on his neck, then shoulder, then arm. He’s struggling not to retain physical contact and tries not to think about
. And desperately. You need to publish your book so you and your family can stay financially afloat. Castiel needs this job so he doesn’t end up unemployed. I’m the one giving you both stability. I’m the voice of reason in this situation, whether you want to believe it or not.”
“Cas…”
Dead.
“Dean,” Jess said slowly. “You wouldn’t get in the way of a pregnant woman and pie, now, would you?” Her voice was dripping with feigned sweetness.
I'm now brainstorming for my next story, which will be a writer/editor Destiel AU. Can't wait to start writing.
“What?” Castiel can’t tell if he’s being complimented or insulted at the moment, but he’s hoping it’s the former.
It’s Cas.
“It’s
“Shit,” Dean mutters, scratching the back of his neck. His mom’s side of the family is filled with troublemakers, criminals—having them back in Lawrence, that’s the worst news he’s heard in a while. “Who? Samuel?”
“Please, stop.” If Castiel had to listen to more of Zachariah’s empty compliments, he might start feeling nauseous. “I...I need to speak with you.”
So the next chapter might be...the most intense thing I've ever written. Aaaaaaaah. I can't wait to share it with you all!!!
The brunette narrows her eyes for melodramatic effect, but the pack is full of scattered chuckles. “And we are certainly in a time of transition. We’ve lost not only our packmaster, but his second in command, and the results of the
“Close your eyes, handsome,” the makeup artist tells Dean, a large and fluffy brush in her delicate hand. Dean tears his eyes away from Cas’ reflection and obliges, and Castiel gives the attractive makeup artist a tiny glare. Pretty soon his own face is being sponged and dusted with various products, and he frowns in his chair, hating the feeling of his pores being clogged.
“First of all,” the bartender said, stretching his hand in their direction, “I’m Leo.” They both shook his hand, Cas participating in the action quite mechanically, as if he couldn’t understand why humans considered this necessary. Dean started to smile, then caught a glimpse of Cas’s chapped lips and felt irritated all over again.
Hey, friends! Long time no see! Sorry for the delay on this one. I'm right in the middle of finishing up a major
He didn’t wait for Gabriel’s reply, only waved a quick hand in the air before strutting down the sidewalk, searching for his car.
Even in this frenzy, sweat gathered on his forehead, Castiel is absolutely stunning.
“And you’re a greedy, pitiless she-demon who not even Satan himself could love,” Crowley said, easy a breathing. “Now that we’re done stating the obvious, perhaps we can continue with Miss Bradbury’s downright riveting presentation?”
Dean audibly huffed. “I’m talking about the twenty minute panty tease. I’m talking about, if I don’t touch your dick ASAP, I might fucking explode. And then you’ll have my death on your hands, and I don’t think you’d like me much as a ghost, and—oh,
hate you, and that’s what tearing him up.” Sam glanced at him earnestly, pleadingly. “And he doesn’t actually know you. Not the real you. If he did, he would see that you’re nothing like your family.”
“Okay, so,” Charlie said conversationally, looking up at Anna and Cas, “now we’re caught-up on Dean’s side of things. What’s been happening with you two?”
. And now you’re done with me?”
-Hate speech
Dean sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “What are the consequences, exactly? Of breaking the contract?”
, descendants of Odin.” The remaining three elders stand behind him, somberly waiting, and Dean’s heart is racing out of his chest. “Today we unite as a pack to celebrate the election of a new packmaster. Folklore dictates that The New Wolf shall rise from the center of a stone, solid as the earth and sustained by the blood of the pack.” There’s the sound of shuffling above Dean’s head, and Rufus begins pouring the goblet of blood over the circle of rocks, chanting a ritual prayer in Gaelic. “Historically, the packmaster is cunning and wise, loyal and fierce, intelligent and brave. This alpha—” Bobby stops his rehearsed speech, evidently hitting a snag before continuing, “or omega, should personify everything weres consider worthy, with the greatest of these being your family and your pack.” Dean nods without meaning to… But the priorities that Bobby is describing, those are
“Cas,” he croaks, fingers skating over his recently slashed throat, but he pulls his hand away without a trace of blood. “Alpha,” he whispers fondly, because he’s so overcome with relief and gratitude and love.
“Oh, come on,” she ribs him, elbow digging into his side, “I thought having a six-foot-tall, sexy-alpha-painter-true-mate boyfriend would make you realize how freaking
way or canceling my contract, which would essentially fuck me in the ass, and not in a good way.”
Castiel’s heart begins pounding. Could that be true? Is Dean still thinking about him in that way, even without the hot tub and the alcohol?
voice. Christ.
“I dunno how you do it,” she speculated, collapsing solidly against the couch. “Literature is fucking sexy. All those metaphors and similes…” She stretched, her back arched, and raised an eyebrow.
Leo rolled his eyes and poured them both shots, mumbling, “This is basically the start of a bad punchline. ‘Two gay FBI agents walk into a bar…’”
