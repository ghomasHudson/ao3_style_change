"I…I put you in jeopardy. I'm sorry, John, If you want to go home I'll get you there immediately. I could…I could let you have some time."
John nodded to him, quickly running down the street to catch his friend, he almost ran into him when he turned the corner; the detective was just standing on the sidewalk, staring at a densely wooded park next to them. The wrought iron gates covered most of the park, and you could scarcely see inside it at all, but you could just make out where a muddy footprint had been left at the base of the steep trail at the base of the entrance.
"He doesn't go up to people on the street and announce all of his family's habits and traits, sure, but he has never hid them. He doesn't care what other people think about him. Except for you. Because of you, he's been scheduling our meetings so that we always find him alone in his flat. You've been living with him for more than a year, and I've never met you. He's never even mentioned you. We might have thought he was living alone if Mycroft hadn't been keeping us up to date."
Something was off though. He felt his transport sniff at the air around him. It didn't smell like the house on Darter Street. The scent was familiar, of course, but not right for where he had passed out. Had he been moved? Being abducted in some way was a danger here—he had known a few friends who had passed out and woken up in chains. He needed to figure out where he was, and he needed to do it quickly.
"No," the Doctor said quickly, pushing Mycroft's shoulder. "We just see if any fish bite, and then if they don't we'll go back to camp."
Mycroft sighed. "You're right," he said, giving into the logic of a child. "Nemo must be a special fish."
John realized with a start that he was still staring at them. Was this some kind of new plastic surgery? Sherlock seemed unwilling to discuss it, even…embarrassed. John simply nodded, trying not to be rude.
"That leads to a business district, but the police are the not far other way. He couldn't live in that direction, it leads to some very upscale houses."
"You still don't understand," she said softly. "Sherlock I've always tried to show you, but you just won't listen to me. When you hurt, when you're scared, you don't have to pretend. Don't hide, Sweetheart. You don't have to hide in here where the world can't see you. There will always be someone who loves you who will pull you out."
"I can't…I've never really realized that you must have parents. I can't imagine you or Mycroft any younger than you are now."
There was the pattering of small feet, and then suddenly the young Sherlock was right in the middle of the living room, peering up at the middle-aged Mycroft. The man jumped, looking down in complete shock.
The boy helped his father reach into the bag and they started pulling out blankets, picnic baskets, chairs, and lanterns.
"It's been ages since you traveled with us," the Doctor insisted. "Just one trip, we'll have you back in two minutes. Well, relatively two minutes. I'll bring you back to the same Sunday at least."
Rose was still smacking the second Angel in the face with the hammer, muttering. "Stupid, irresponsible, evil, sons of bit—"
"Um," John said, trying to think quickly, "well, you know, we're friends. We visit each other a lot."
John didn't answer. He looked behind him—there was Sherlock's bedroom. He was still in the flat. This didn't make any sense. He backed out of the box, trying to see if he had seriously misjudged the size of the thing. It looked just as small as it had before. John set his hands on the wood, making sure it was really in front of him. He walked around the box, trying to find some sort of hidden door or compartment that might make this make sense.
The little boy ran into the room, taking in the basic patterns of the walls and simple furniture buried under the mountain of papers and books. He seemed to be looking for something very specific.
Sherlock sighed. "Do I really have to spell this out? There hasn't been any proper rain, John, but his shoes are caked in mud. Fresh mud. I thought rain would explain it, but there hasn't been any. Our chimney sweep just ran through a river bed then—not many of those nearby. I'd venture to say we start in the direction his footprints are leading and keep walking, his mud can't be more than a few minutes away. He was running, but he hadn't gone far."
"Police box," John continued, "is larger on the inside than it is in the outside. That's impossible."
Rose was crying. The lights around him were still slow and sluggish to his eyes, but he saw his mother now with perfect clarity. She placed a hand on his face, over the cheek she had just slapped. It was a comforting gesture, but her face was not as soft. She was glaring at him.
"Oh," the Doctor said with a face that made it clear he did not understand. It melted into one of surprise and then excitement all in less than ten seconds. "Oh! Really? Are you sure?"
John Watson had never been a very vain man. He knew his limits, his flaws, and his good qualities as well. He knew who he was yesterday. Today he realized he had always been completely wrong.
Rose took John's hand and sat him down on the bench. "It's a bit much. He's not prone to fainting, is he?"
Thank you all so much for making it to the end! I love this version of Sherlock (especially when he's younger). If you'd like to read more be sure to check out A Childhood In The TARDIS. :)
John frowned at him, realizing it was too late to call the couple back from their wild goose chase. "He had the business card in his pocket though."
"He's too young," Rose insisted for the tenth time that week. "He's only a month old, he can't talk."
The Doctor dropped what he was working on, and the sudden gaze from his eyes to Sherlock's was too intense. The young man looked away.
"I get it, really," Sherlock insisted, still not looking at him. "The TARDIS, my parents, me, it all seems a bit more real once you've been put in danger. You should be allowed to think about things for a while. I can give you as much time as you need."
The man shook his head slowly. He seemed drowsier as the seconds passed, as if he could fall asleep at any moment. The other were slowing down as well, dropping to the bottom of the cages into a deep sleep. "No. We never see them do it, really. We see them standing at the door. We find food in our tins, laced with something to knock us out so they can come in when we're all asleep. Then when we wake up, two or three people are gone."
Sherlock was out of the room before his mother could protest. Rose sighed and started pulling ingredients down from the cupboards to remake the pie.
"How could you?" she asked again, louder this time. She grabbed his arm, pulling it out in front of him and sliding up his sleeve, showing the small pinpricks on the inside of his elbow.
Sherlock shot his Rose a look and she backed away sheepishly. "Nothing. Sorry, Sherlock's right. It's not important."
"I'm older than I look," she assured him. "Do you want to know the other half, then? Do you know what really makes you stand out, Dr. John Watson?"
Sherlock gave her only a half-smile, but it looked genuine. John frowned, staring at the young woman. Sherlock had never mentioned having a sister. She could be a cousin, perhaps? He heard the door open again and a thin man stepped out, a wide grin spread across his face. His brown pinstripe pants and jacket seemed to elongate his already lanky frame, but it suited him. His hair was wild, a chock of brown wilderness that reflected the eccentricity on his face.
Castiel frowned, letting him shake his hand. “Time Lords aren’t supposed to exist either, at least not anymore.” His eyes darted over to the rest of the small family. “I believe your child is… in distress.”
"John is…fascinating. He tolerates my friendship and sometimes my company. But obviously that's all there can ever be."
"Amazing," the man said, shaking his head. "You two are absolutely amazing. People would love to hear about the things you two do."
The Doctor bit his lip a moment, trying to keep them walking. "Good job Sherlock, very good. I made the path. I've…been here before. Once or twice. A few times."
"And you never did," she said simply, laying her hand against the side of his face. "I asked and asked but you never wanted to admit that you were upset. I could see it, the way you dropped your fork at dinner, the way you kept your room door open at night for four days, I saw it all. The night after you got home and you thought everyone was asleep, you looked into our room for five whole minutes just to make sure you weren't alone."
"Mycroft has. Do you remember his bout with scarlet fever? No, I suppose you were a bit young. Anyway, if a human virus can affect him then you're both at risk." He moved the stethoscope to the other side of Sherlock's chest, listening much more intently.
John stared into the room. Sitting right in the middle, much too big to get in or out through the door, sat a large blue box.
"It's two hungry boys who ate your father's special surprise for tonight. I know banana cream is your favorite too, did you honestly think I wouldn't notice?"
"Judge Ronald Adair was murdered, remember? Lestrade called us, asked us to come down to the Yard and review the suspects.
The lights all shifted again, but not in unison this time. The colors of the rainbow split around them, and all four sat on the blanket as the lights grew incredibly bright, and then began to dim. The bugs went higher than they had, and suddenly they were all a shimmering gold that started to fade.
John nodded, not really paying attention to her. He was watching Sherlock's huddled form on the chair. "It's been a long Sunday, Mrs. Hudson. Would you mind coming back later? I think we'll both probably turn in early."
"Where shall we camp?" Rose asked. "We could stay on Earth, maybe try another century with cowboys— or pirates, yes Sherlock. Mycroft, any preferences?"
John stared at the boy for a second, and then the Doctor's words hit him. "I—Doctor wait! Where are you going?"
“My name is Dean Winchester, and this is my brother Sam. We’re just trying to help. We’re not looking to hurt anyone.”
He frowned. Why would he wonder who he was? He was Sherlock Holmes, the consulting detective. Life had always been like this. Moriarty was to blame, that was it. He had to solve this case or he could not be with John, or Molly, or Lestrade. That's why he had to jump off the roof. He had to jump into nothing. Then why was he still alive? Why did he remember watching John at his grave? Why were the lights out in here? He would have to speak to Mrs. Hudson about that.
"Busy enough," he nodded, pulling a stethoscope from his pocket. "We won't tell Mum that you're still on nicotine patches. She'll be happy to hear you've quit smoking, though."
"By Cardiff?" he asked, raising an eyebrow. The mask fell and he grinned. "Yes. I loved you by the time we danced."
John stood still, trying to work through what she'd said, but he finally gave up and just followed her upstairs.
"Oh, no," she shivered. "I'm happy just here, thank you. I don't like to set foot on boats, much less… whatever that Police Box is."
"Sort of," Rose said, opening the door wider for him. "There's a perception filter around the TARDIS. They don't want to notice us, so they don't. Do you want to try for the future again?"
"The ropes that had fastened the unconscious body of Mr. Whitmore to the back of the large African Elephant were tied in bowline knots. It had to be the work of the sailor."
"Well, far in the future when this planet is "discovered" by archeologists they'll call them Parum Splendorem Insecta, which just means Little Shining Bugs in Latin. Not a very creative lot, archeologists. Most people just refer to them as the Moira bugs, after the planet, though no one's quite sure who named the planet anyway. Completely harmless, only interested in food and each other. You can see them anywhere on the planet, but the best spot is right here."
"Okay. Why do you like this place so much?" Sherlock asked as the Doctor gently started to usher him to the door.
Sherlock was looking over John's shoulder, but if he hadn't known any better he would have thought he was staring right at his face. "They're aliens, John."
Sherlock frowned. He suddenly realized that there were a few things around him that usually weren't. There was the trashcan, a few feet away. The chair he was tied to was not usually in the consul room, but when he wiggled he realized it was bolted to the floor. There were water bottles and fruit and blankets spread on the floor. "What's going on?"
John smiled. Sherlock never did get to be a pirate like he wanted, but he had a feeling there were things more important to him. Sherlock had what he had wanted as a child, and he'd never have to go without it again.
"I think you'll like this one," he said pulling the ship to a quick landing. "Stay right there, I'm going to make sure it's safe."
"About a day," John said uncomfortably. He had no idea Mycroft had any sort of superior to report to, he'd always assumed the eldest Holmes brother was at the top of the ladder, but now he heard that Mycroft reported his actions to this little blonde woman. He wondered for a moment just how much power this young woman held. She had Mycroft, and therefore the British government, entirely at her disposal. She had Sherlock, the smartest man he'd ever met, acting like a petulant child. He wasn't sure who exactly this Doctor was, but he guessed he might have some influence himself. Whoever Rose Tyler really was, she had three powerful men wrapped around her fingers with seemingly little effort.
"Love isn't just a human emotion," she reminded him. "Your father loves me, and you boys, and almost everything else in the universe. Don't tell yourself that you're wrong for feeling something." She pressed a quick kiss to his cheekbone, patting him on the arm. "Go get the money. I won't tell him. Yet. I'll give you a few weeks. Maybe a month. Then I'm stepping in. I've made the decision."
"Mmm, not technically a machine," Sherlock started, but Rose held up a finger and he stopped midsentence. John sighed. This was not going to be a regular Sunday."
The boy nodded, pulling his legs up to his chest. He looked away from John shyly, clutching one of his pant-legs.
She smiled back at him, but continued the story. "We traveled around a bit, but I had an accident with the time vortex. It was necessary, saved a lot of lives, but it almost killed me. The Doctor saved me, but it left me a bit less than human. I don't age very fast. We didn't even notice at first. We fell in love, and we kept traveling. We went all over the universe, just exploring, for years afterwards. We saw an impossible asteroid, a diamond planet, parties and people and food like you've never imagined."
"Oh, no," Rose said, crossing her arms. The Doctor raised an eyebrow at her, but looked away a bit guiltily when she shot him a look. "We've just gotten ahold of you. If you're investigating, we're helping you."
"I'm not playing, I'm investigating. I'll just take a scan real quick and bring it back so you can tell me what it says. Mum's in there, she can watch me."
"Okay," the Doctor said, gently stopping her swinging arms. "You know that won't actually kill Weeping Angels, right. They're going to reconstitute in just a few hours. We'll take the boys home, then we'll have to come back to deal with them."
The criminal smiled, looking back slightly over his shoulder. "I understand why I had trouble going against you two, before now. You were cheating. You and Sherlock, you had an advantage over me. There are secrets, buzzing around our little planet, aren't there. I'm just leveling the playing field, Mr. Holmes.
The calm room he was in melted around him, turning into another room entirely. Not a real room—this was just another part of his palace, a little memory tucked away. He blinked in surprise, this wasn't a memory he visited often.
"Sherlock's right," the Doctor said. "With Mycroft, Rose's body didn't recognize the genes. The pregnancy was tricky; she was sick constantly, I had to monitor both of their heart rates at all times, he was born a few months early. When she was pregnant with Sherlock her body was expecting the difficulties. It made the whole thing easier, and in the end he came out slightly more human."
John flat out hugged him. He didn't mean to, but his heart was swelling with excitement. There were tears in his eyes. He heard Nurse Molly Hooper behind him, asking what was happening.
"Sherlock," Rose chastised gently from where she was leaning against the consul, "you know better than that."
He turned and looked at the little boy observing him, mouth hanging open a bit. He was not one to babysit often, if ever, and he had no idea what he was doing. He told himself to calm down—it was just Sherlock, after all. He knew this person, though he wasn't used to seeing him so young. He redialed the number on his phone again, holding it limply to his ear.
The man was tall with dark brown hair. He wore a tweed jacket with a bow tie just above it, and he seemed to have misplaced his eyebrows. He stared down at the boy. "Amy…I'm going to call you back. Tell Rose…no on second thought don't tell her anything. I never called you."
"You see it, don't you?" Rose asked with a smile. "That extra spark he has, the thing that makes him wonderful. I look at my boys and I see the universe in their eyes, and I think you see it too. That's half of what makes you special."
"Well, learn. I understand that your instincts may tell you that your first body is disposable, but it's not in your case. You said John has been making you eat?"
“M—marriage is a commitment o—one must not enter into lightly, but when the love is true…” The priest continued, growing ever confident in his words, though he’d begun to eye them warily, realizing they might not be joining for the right reasons.
Mycroft sat at his desk, his mouth parted in voiceless wonder, brows furrowed in confusion, unable to understand the alpha's reaction. Upset, he'd expected, but not this.
“Tell me their names son. Tell me!” Mr. Watson demanded, wishing to find these children and give them a firm talking to.
Mycroft, however, did promise to talk with Sherlock and get him to take on the appropriate role as his husband. John didn’t think it would hold very much weight. Sherlock didn’t like Mycroft and wouldn’t willingly fold to Mycroft’s will.
Throwing off the sheets with a heavy grunt, using much of his strength to move the heavily thick duvet, John panted with exertion and reached for his mobile resting on the bedside counter. Hurriedly dialing a number, John waited for an answer.
There was a brief pause on the other end, before Mycroft spoke again, voice filled with incredulity and uncertainty.
The other alpha was hesitant about intimacy and Gregory was more than willing to work their way slowly to it. It started with brief kisses, kisses that turned heated over time, then touches that lingered.
Mycroft quickly stepped on Sherlock’s bed sheet, halting his exit as the sheet slipped off partly, revealing his chest.
, and when Sherlock was done with him, he'd be milked completely of his seed, until all John could shoot was dry.
Slipping under the covers of their bed, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s lean waist and tucked his head in the crook of the taller man’s neck. Sherlock shifted in bed, released a deep contented sigh and leaned back into John’s welcoming arms.
John inhaled sharply at the threat. Not because he'd ever cheat, but with the way Sherlock's mind was now, he might just misconstrue truth, have a delusion of his supposed infidelity, and might actually attempt to de-man him.
"I'm sorry." John repeated, raising his head and outstretching his arm, reaching out to palm one of Sherlock's wet cheeks.
Sherlock paid great efforts in being his natural self around John and for the most part he was proud of himself for keeping up with the false image, still there were lapses. Times when John would lean in close while Sherlock was observing a body and the omega within would flitter happily, setting Sherlock’s stomach to knotting and his breath to hitching. Sherlock had to focus more than ever to restrain the soft whimper struggling to voice itself.
"Shut up." John demanded, though there was no malice in his words. In fact John was smiling from ear to ear.
John’s hips squirmed, the bulge in his jeans felt painfully restricted, but John kept watching. The alpha rocked his hips against the omega’s, compressing their cocks tightly together, and bringing them close to the edge. John could see the slick steadily pool around the omega’s ass, drench the sheets and soak the alpha’s knees.
Lestrade was a good man, yes, but Lestrade was an alpha, and omegas were appealing to alphas. True, John was taking suppressants and his scent was a sexual put off, but the longer Lestrade spent with John, he could grow a fondness for Sherlock’s husband. Lestrade was a man of sentiment and if John wasn’t careful he could receive the affections of Lestrade.
John shot Sherlock a look, not liking that his mate was insulting the other omega, but given John's lie, he could understand his spite.
Sherlock’s mouth was full, lips whitened as he took in more of the omega’s thick cock, filling his mouth completely and still wanting to take in more of John. There was so much. John involuntarily thrust up, driven by an instinctual need to seek out more of that pleasurable goodness. Sherlock gagged and instantaneously pulled away, releasing John’s cock from the sweltering cavern of his mouth.
Sherlock shut his eyes and brought up an image of John, naked, settled between his legs and feasting on his nipples one after the other. Sherlock's hands furiously pinching at the pink flesh, agitating and reddening his perked up nipples, needing more, wanting more.
Gregory took a calming breath and raised out his hand, staring hopefully up at the alpha, worried he might have pushed too much. Mycroft stared at his hand warily, before he hesitantly took hold of it, and gradually allowed Gregory to pull him back and seated himself on the couch.
"This isn't your fault." Sherlock's eyes lowered to the mess he'd created, and John knew it wasn't an easy thing for his omega to admit.
“Yeah.” John rasped staring down to the ground trying hard not to cry all over again, because he couldn’t, not in front of Mrs. Hudson—it would break her heart.
John would practice and learn, he’d get better, and when he was sure he could look at Sherlock while performing, he’d…
Then Sherlock sent him that look. That look that told John all he needed to know and his face heated with embarrassment.
John opened his eyes and turned around, collecting his food and placing it on the kitchen table, ignoring the bloodied human fingers in a plastic bag set out near him, John focused on eating his food.
Harry got a job and went to school much like John and the two lived contentedly together for several years. Harry graduated college first, as John decided he wanted to become a doctor and it would take him far longer to finish his education. Harry majored in social science and philosophy and soon got a job at a local college. John was happy for her, but he’d still felt a pang of sadness when she’d decided it was time that she move out of their flat and get a place of her own. Even after Harry moved out the two kept in touch, but it wasn’t the same. They hardly ever saw each other, but they did call and text every few days.
"Where is he? Is he okay? He's lucid and talking, right?" The alpha pushed past Mycroft and entered the home, carrying a large duffle bag.
John carefully folded up the papers and slipped them back into the envelope. Smile faint, John wiped away his tears and laughed sorrowfully.
Walking down the rows of dogs within a pet store, Sherlock was unable to choose a pet. It was a Holmes tradition. Before Mycroft and Sherlock were born, his mother had gone and gotten them a dog of their own. Mycroft was gifted a cream colored borzoi and Sherlock was gifted a red Irish setter.
"I'm sorry John. I... think a great many pleasing things about you, and find most of them I don't say aloud when I mean to, and sometimes think I do."
"I told your mother we made plans to shop together for our pups, she won't take you shopping. Now, would you please get out of the bathroom and go talk with her?" John laughed happily on his end.
The house itself was a special project, in some ways very old and in others quite new. The Doctor designed it himself, reinforcing it with metals from other worlds that would keep it standing for thousands of years, and then had it built for them in the fifteen hundreds on a huge plot of property they had purchased. No one was allowed on the land, but just to be sure he had put a perception filter on all ten acres. People driving nearby didn't even notice the heavily wooded area next to the road, let alone the little house nestled in the center of it. That house was guaranteed to be untouched and still standing no matter when in time they landed. Once they arrived they would flip the sign held on the front of the door from empty to occupied; that way they never had to worry about bumping into future or past versions of themselves. If it was occupied today, they'd just pop ahead a few weeks until it was empty.
She gave him a look as she sat next to him on the bed, taking his hand. "About what happened today, Sherlock. Don't pretend you weren't afraid. It was a scary day. Everyone was afraid."
"He also shouldn't be able to sit up on his own," the Doctor reminded her. There's never been a Human-Time Lord hybrid, we have no idea how far advanced he is. Our son is special."
Rose cradled the side of his face, a deep sadness in her eyes mixed with amazement. "You really don't know. You don't see yourself, do you?"
Sherlock hopped into the bench, clicking on the seatbelt he always wore when the ship was in the vortex. "I don't like new people."
"I need John for more than just moral support, you know. He is an Army Doctor," his voice went down to a whisper, "and I imagine he would be better than any of the quacks from the eighteen hundreds. He has a more modernized education. We're going to try to establish a time of death ourselves, but it's possible that knowing when he left work could save a lot of time. If we miss each other we can just meet up at 221 B Baker Street. It won't belong to us for a century, but at least we know how to find it."
"Best be off," the Doctor said, shooting his sulking son a look. "Good to see you, Sherlock. We'll be by again."
"Oh," Sherlock said quickly, "I suppose you're right. You stay in the flat, I'll leave. You can go on to bed, I'll be gone within the hour."
"Nowhere special," he shrugged without turning to look at her. "Just a little forest planet I know of. It's warm all year, no mosquitoes, and it has plenty of open space."
Sherlock pounded loudly on the door to the house, peering into the dusty windows. No light shone from within, and the whole place had the smell of being utterly abandoned. When no one had answered in five minutes, Sherlock kicked open the door, holding the side of his coat over his mouth as the dust rushed out to meet them.
"Oh no!" Sherlock cried, sinking into a pout on the chair as the little blue box appeared. As soon as the Doctor opened the door he was in front of it, shaking his head vigorously. "Dad, I'm not ready to leave! I want to stay here with John for a while! Please?"
The hand slapped against the side of his face again, hard enough to shake his teeth, and with a sudden crash he felt the Mind Palace crumble around him. He took a sharp breath and opened his eyes, his real eyes, gasping for breath. At first everything was blurry, but he saw someone in front of him. His body was tied firmly to something with soft ties, and he was sitting in a char of some kind. He tugged at the binds as his vision swam. He blinked finally realizing who was in front of him.
John patted his back a bit awkwardly. After a long moment, Sherlock pulled away, looking just as surprised as John.
It was his room. Not his room at the tiny flat he was renting right now, but his real room, the one from his childhood. He sat on his old bed, looking around at the nostalgic decorations. Of course it was a bit wrong—he had grown out of this pirate theme years before. This was his room, but as it was when he was a child. He shook, his head, trying to get his bearings. Why would his mind bring him here?
Sherlock gasped, automatically stepping back from John and closing his scorched eyes, John did the same, shaking where he stood.
"What's going on, Sherlock?" John asked, wondering briefly if he should dash upstairs for his firearm.
John was about to protest when a small boy poked his head out of the TARDIS. He was about to ask who it was, but the words caught in his throat. He knew those eyes, that hair, that apprehensive glance around the apartment. He'd never seen the boy before in his life, but he knew exactly who he was.
"For a while. Ten years or so I think. Then I started to wonder about…certain things," she glanced at the Doctor. "I wasn't aging, but I was still maturing, slowly. I was about thirty-five when I realized that if we ever wanted a child, it would have to be before I got too old. We weren't sure it was even possible, a Time Lord and a human, but a year later we had Mycroft. Seven years later Sherlock was a bit of a surprise, but we needed him."
Rose sighed, making sure the boys were out of earshot, before she stopped the Doctor and laid her hands on either side of his face. She placed a quick peck on his lips, then pulled back. "Listen to me, Doctor. I'm talking about Sherlock's love life. Sherlock is in love with John."
"Mycroft is asexual, I know, he has no interest in any kind of physical relationship at all. There's nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately he also seems to be incredibly resistant to forming close ties to anyone other than his family. I worry about him sometimes, that he might be lonely or regret his decisions later, but we're not talking about your brother right now. We're talking about you, the little boy who decided to idolize his brother and act exactly like him."
John took a breath, staring him down. He walked past him grabbing his coat. "If you don't want to tell me the truth, fine. I'll be at the bar."
"You never pretend for anyone, Sherlock. You never exactly how much sugar to put in someone's coffee, you don't reassure them when they're worried about you, you don't pull them into your life and drag them on cases and apologize when you've argued. I know my children, and I know when they're hurting."
Rose gave him a tight hug, and then she leaned over her son so that only he could hear her. "A month, Sherlock. Maybe less. You have to tell him."
The boy bit his lip, his curiosity overriding his obedience easily. He could still hear his mother talking to his father in the distance, so technically he wasn't in trouble. Besides, somebody might be in trouble. Dad wouldn't let him get grounded if he saved someone.
He sighed, grabbing his head. It hurt. He was so tired. He just wanted to go to sleep. Why was this case so important?
"I had a bit of an accident. Remember when we visited Moira when the boys were kids? I accidently crossed paths with Sherlock."
Molly chuckled. "Leaving our patient to spend time with your wife again? I swear he gets jealous when you go home early."
"Plenty," the Doctor nodded, "and they're edible too." He knelt down next to his youngest son and handed him the small pole. "Okay Sherlock, go ahead and cast it into the water."
Mycroft didn't answer. He stared straight ahead, trying to ignore the man. He had only been off the phone with his mother for a few minutes when someone had struck him from behind. How they had managed to get into his private office, he had no idea. What mattered was that he had awoken in an unfamiliar, dark place, handcuffed to a very thick pipe.
John sipped at the pint in his hand, staring dumbfounded at the scene before him. Old pals and new enemies sat around tables in the pub, arguing and laughing and belching in the fashion of a workingman just off of his shift. Some part of his mind was insisting that these people weren't really from the past. This was just a game, a role-play they had all agreed to assist in. It could be one of Sherlock's experiments—how far-fetched is too far-fetched for John Hamish Watson? It was believable, Sherlock had tricked him for the sake of science before.
"Come on, Mikey," The Doctor said gently, tapping the distracted infants leg to get his attention. The Doctor lay across the living room floor, his striped suit wrinkled horribly. He had his head propped up on his hand as he tried to make his young son look at him. "Mikey, hey. Mycroft, look at me."
"Good morning, Mycroft," Rose smiled, ignoring his grumbles. Every thirteen year old decided that his parents were dumb and his life was boring, it didn't matter if his life was extraordinary and his father was a hyper-intelligent alien. They'd decided to just ride out this phase, he was usually polite about his grievances anyway.
"You're going to get through this, you know. If anyone could pull through, you could," John said, setting his hand on Sherlock's arm.
"If I were a pirate," Sherlock announced to his dog, "I would want to bury my treasure under a huge tree like this. So, we'll probably have to dig deep under the roots."
Mycroft sighed, crossing over and looking down at the small boy. For just a moment he saw something melt on the man's face, and Mycroft reached down to fix the boy's hair. "The Sontaran affair?"
John obeyed, but winced when he found that it made it even harder to keep them open a second time. "You didn't answer my question. What happens to you, right now, if I blink?"
He jumped. It must have been a trick of the light before. The room wasn't entirely empty it turned out. In the far corner, between the two doors, someone had left a bit of art in the run down house. He supposed the cement walls had made it blend in before. There was no other explanation as for how he would miss an entire statue.
"For Time Lords, sure," he answered, following close behind him. "Your 'transport' is human. You've only got the one body, and you're stuck with it for life."
"Like I said, you were late." Sherlock hopped from the couch, peering out the window as if he expected to see something staring back at him. He pulled his wallet from the table and pushed a few dozen pound notes into John's hands. "Go get drunk. On me. Have fun."
Rose turned and found that, in fact, the grass around them seemed to be tinted a deep rouge. She turned quickly to the Doctor, afraid they should run, but he was grinning madly.
Sherlock cast an uninterested glance at the clock, furrowing his brow. "Oh. You're late. I expected you up before this. You were my alarm clock."
"Of course," she said quickly, trying to think quickly. She was getting quicker with these questions. Do pirates eat vegetables? Do pirates sleep with a stuffed animal? She had to think quickly or he'd outsmart her. "They have to camp when they bury their treasure."
Sherlock sighed, reluctantly hugging her back. "It would be simpler if I just didn't have to deal with these stupid human emotions."
"Morning, Sherlock," she said, careful not to let him think her smile was anything more than a greeting. He'd been insisting on dressing himself the last month or so, but for such a clever boy he had a child's sense of clothing. "Have you been helping Daddy with the trip?"
John frowned, setting down his paper. "Now? I need some warning ahead of time, Sherlock. What am I supposed to do?"
"Well," Sherlock shrugged, "if you believe one of my 'Uncles' is really dead, but he never does seem to stay that way. The Master supposedly died when I was ten. Theoretically, yes, we're all that's left. But if you do happen to see anyone with a fob watch and a big ego, let us know."
Say what you like about how careless the Doctor was about his own life—he was a very careful father to Mycroft and Sherlock. He'd lost children once before. In the horrible days of the Time War, his children and grandchildren had died, and there was nothing he could do but watch it happen. Now he had another chance; he had two boys just as intelligent and wonderful as his others. They would have loved their siblings.
"You…you have a jacket by the door. It looks like it's your size. There's a little metal disc sticking down from the pocket. It's too big to be a watch, besides, the look of your computer over there means we're probably in the early 21st century. By that time most people just got their time from their phones. Balance of probability says it is probably the end of a stethoscope. Only doctors carry stethoscopes."
For a long while after he woke up, he got to simply lie on the ground, not feeling anything. It was always like this when he sobered up. Slowly, more slowly than usual, he began to become aware of his body. Not this body, lying on a nice cool floor in his Mind Palace, but the 'real' one. The transport. It was the enemy that carried him around when he was stuck in the outside world. He refused to acknowledge that body just yet. This was a process, and it had to be done in order. There was a checklist.
Finally he sat up, his little nose wrinkled high on his face. She smirked. This little boy was absolutely beautiful, and he would grow to be a beautiful young man. His chubby cheeks had already receded slightly, and his eyes seemed to not be able to decide whether they wanted to be green or blue. She sighed, pushing him back onto the bed gently. "One more question, Sherlock, then you have to sleep."
Mycroft grinned, giving Sherlock a quick hug before running back out into UNIT to help a very resistant Rose.
Suddenly he was in the brightly lit halls of 221 B Baker Street. His coat and gloves were suddenly on. His mind was clear, but blank. John stepped out into the hall with him, pulling on his own coat. "We better get going, Sherlock?"
John's frustration went out of his voice. "I don't… I doubt we'll be able to really talk about anything while you're like this. If you're going to sleep, I'm going out. We're out of milk anyway. See you tomorrow morning?"
When the TARDIS was finally in the living room the door popped open and the Doctor stuck his head out. He smiled at John. "Hello there!"
John obeyed, turning to face Sherlock. He gasped, pointing over the detective's shoulder. "Sherlock—it's the angel statue from downstairs! It's right behind you!"
"We can check it out tonight, but I'm telling you if there's a Shifter or something here it's well hidden…"
The Doctor looked back and saw Sherlock standing very still behind him. The boys eyes were red and tears were starting to pour from them. He was staring hard at the newcomer, a look of deep concentration on his face. The Doctor seemed to understand because he ran back to his son and got down to his eye level, whispering so quietly not even Rose or Mycroft could hear him.
She ushered the Doctor out of the door, grabbing Sherlock's jacket sleeve and pulling him close to her. "Talk to him. Right now."
"But your brother can't," the Doctor said, laying a hand on Mycroft's shoulder. "He's too young, and I wouldn't send him somewhere on his own. I trust you to help look after him."
The windows of the Mind Palace were closed. The curtains were drawn shut tight, and not an inch of light filtered into small room Sherlock had set himself inside. He could not see the doors, but he knew they were all locked. No historical figures wandered the walls, spouting off random facts about their lives and accomplishments. He was fairly certain he'd laid out a comprehensive report on the different types of tobacco ash in another room, but he couldn't remember which one.
"Yes, yes, Amy, I understand that they're purple, but what shade of purple? Yes it matters. They have to match the blue ones," a voice said from the other side. The man walked around the consul, then suddenly caught sight of Sherlock. He froze, the phone still gripped in his hand.
"A new case, John? I haven't finished the last one," Sherlock said, trembling with his hand on the door. John just stared forward, looking at him. Sherlock took a deep breath. "Okay. For you. I'll do it."
Rose and the Doctor sat across from him while Sherlock detailed in length the way he had solved his last elephant-filled case a few days before. John didn't mean to stare, but there was a draw to the couple, something intangible but very real that made him want to observe them. They sat very close as if they were trying to occupy the same space. The Doctor's hand was curled lightly over hers, so casually that John wondered if he even knew he was doing it. Sherlock's story was just as convoluted and self-praising as his versions always were, but the couple was paying rapt attention.
The Doctor hopped up and clapped his hands once, loudly. "Well then. John knows, we've had tea, where should we go?"
"I wasn't. Statistically, Father usually wins against the Daleks. They didn't want to kill me, they wanted to use me as a bargaining chip, and I it. It was the equivalent of being yelled at for two hours by angry salt and pepper shakers. I told you that I didn't need to talk about it, but you bothered me about it for two days, convinced I need to talk about the experience."
Sherlock sighed, pulling off his jacket and rolling his sleeves up past his elbows and holding out his arms. "Don't be subtle please, it's not your strong point. Go on, check them for needle marks."
Sherlock heard the slap before he felt it. A hand came across the side of his face, hard enough to whip his head to the side. It wasn't the memory of his mother, she was sitting calmly beside him. It didn't happen in the Mind Palace—that meant it had to be happening in the real world. Someone had slapped his real face.
Sherlock peered closer at the body, and John could see the gears whirring in his mind. There were the sounds of footprints behind him and he realized the Doctor and Rose had finally caught up with them. The detective pulled a thin piece of paper from the deceased man's front jacket pocket, then jumped up to meet his parents.
"Sorry, I think we'll have to cut this short tonight. We should be able to get through one story, if we hurry," John said rummaging in his bag for a book.
Sherlock grinned. He was about to say something when there a knock at the door. The boy gasped and dived underneath the kitchen table, hiding himself expertly. John felt a twinge of empathy—how often had this boy needed to hide to know how to do it so well? It was just as well, he didn't know how he would explain it to whoever was at the door.
John smiled. It was an easy deduction, really, but not one he himself would have realized. "Amazing, as usual."
"Your notebook," Sherlock said suddenly, "John, do you still carry that notebook you were using to write down my observations?"
She chuckled. "So we'll remember to set their trip for another day. Will the nighttime surprise still happen?"
She sighed. "You've stayed with your Uncle Jack long enough to know that most people aren't black and white. He doesn't have to be gay to love you, Sherlock."
Sherlock wasn't paying attention. He stared down the street in the direction the man had been running, frowning slightly. "Why run that way?"
The door to the room opened, and a memory walked through. It was his mother, smiling, bright-faced, in an old Union-Jack tee-shirt he remembered from his childhood. She walked up to him, placing a delicate hand on his shoulder.
In less than a mile they arrived at a bare clearing on the ground. For about thirty feet all around there were no trees or grass or too many lumps. Right in the center of the circle was a small fire pit, obviously long since abandoned.
The smile faltered a bit. "What about John? Do you think he loves him back? If we push Sherlock into this and John rejects him—I don't think he could handle that. It wouldn't just set him back, Rose, it would destroy everything. Do you see the way he shows off for John? I thought he was just trying to be impressive, but it makes sense now. I don't think he could live like he was before, without John. Maybe…maybe it's better not to risk such a close friendship."
"Well, it's just something he'll have to get used to," his grandmother said, "now that we've got to pay some attention to…what was the name again?"
Sherlock looked away from him, helping his mother incapacitate the other Angel. The little family pulled people out of their cages, and the Doctor scanned them carefully.
"Hey, I know how the TARDIS works," the Doctor said, a bit higher pitched than necessary. "I've been piloting it since long before you were born."
"A few hours every couple days. I think I've eaten. John hasn't yelled at me at least, so he must have seen me have something."
"You've been awake for four days now, Sherlock. It's definitely a sleeping night. Mycroft is asleep in his room, it's your turn now."
Two men sat on the floor, on of them still chewing on the remnants of the banana cream pie. The froze when they saw Sherlock.
John took a step back, but Sherlock rolled his eyes. "They extend almost ten feet on either side while we're in space. You're perfectly safe. Watch."
The boy thought a moment. "This is the TARDIS, and there's only one of those. Mum told me once, about how Time Lords can change. Are you…are you Dad?"
The Doctor nodded sadly, gently taking his arms and examining them. "I didn't think you had relapsed. Really, that's not why we're here. We've just missed you boys."
"Well," the Doctor said in a long, drawn out drawl, "we've got that sorted. Did you want to go on a, um…ride in the family car, or would you rather just stay here a bit?"
He called his flat-mate's phone, but it went immediately to voicemail. "You're going to regret going out, Sherlock. Your parents are back already. Get home when you can."
Sherlock knew more about the device and how to use it than he father gave him credit for. More specifically, he knew if he could get a sample on the end of it then the device could guide him to more of the same sample. It was a feature the Doctor had installed only a few years before so that they always had clean water when traveling; just drop a bit of moisture onto the end and it would guide them to more.
"He's just excited," Sherlock said, trotting over to his seat and buckling himself in. "We're going to bury treasure."
John blinked, looking to Sherlock for an explanation. His friend seemed to be looking everywhere except at him.
Sherlock stood on shaky legs, walking slowly to the door. "I don't know how to do this. John, is it locked?"
John had to smile with her. Rose's eyes were unfocused, and he saw her reliving every moment as she spoke of them.
"It's just empty space, John. You can't learn anything from up here. It's on the surface of the planet that things matter. Calendars and streets and light bulbs—they matter. You can use them to deduce things, to solve mysteries and learn about the people who use them. Space is just nothing."
"They wouldn't eat Nemo," Sherlock insisted. "He's so blue he'd blend into the water and they couldn't catch him."
"Why?" John asked, staring at the stony figure behind Sherlock. They were stuck. The cages on either side of the room formed a very narrow alley. John and Sherlock were practically in the middle, a yard or two apart, facing each other. One statue stood behind Sherlock, and one behind John, blocking off their exits. There was no answer for a long moment, so he tried again. "Sherlock, what happens if I blink?"
"Not at the moment," Sherlock said. He'd resumed his inspection of the ceiling, but at least he was responsive.
"Because digging takes a long time, and they can't leave the treasure on the shore overnight or someone could come by and take it."
Now he was creeping slowly through the dimming twilight, following the beeps as they grew louder and steadier. Something was out here. His heart started to beat faster as he approached the shed out behind their house. His feet slowed. He heard voices coming from the shed.
He lay still next to her, and if he were any other child she would have thought he was drifting off. She knew better—she could feel the little ridges in his forehead that meant he was deep in thought. She tried to rub them away, but she knew it was just a matter of time before he asked another question.
Sherlock looked up excitedly. There was John, sitting across the dark flat in his chair by the fireplace. "John," Sherlock said, running across the room and falling to the floor in front of John's chair. He grabbed at his friends knees. This wasn't right, it wasn't like him. He was supposed to be cold and logical, but he was neither here. "John, you're here. John, I jumped off a building, but I'm still here. I'm so confused. Nothing makes sense here. It looks like our flat, but the lights are going out around me, John. Can I go to sleep now, John?"
"The man had this business card with him, and he looks like he was headed home from work. I need the two of you to get down there and see if he had only just left for the day. It could be invaluable in establishing a timeline and finding his killer."
"I don't have to," she yawned. "I just want to sleep, I don't care where. I'll stay up until you're asleep though."
Rose tapped the Doctor's arms and he nodded, kissing her once on the forehead. He sighed, looking at his son, and then placed a hand on Sherlock's shoulder. He didn't say anything, and he wasn't really looking at him, but the message was clear. He was angry, so angry, but there were only three people in the universe that were completely safe from the fury of the Last Time Lord, and Sherlock was one of them. The Doctor stepped out of the room, letting Rose have a minute alone with her son.
John shrugged. "I've always thought you were a bit weird. If anything, this explains a lot. The sleeping habits, your messed up sense of time, the secretiveness, weird experiments on my table, shooting holes in the wall—"
"We are not unique, we are freaks," he snapped. "I'd rather John never know that I'm not entirely human."
John walked back in slowly towards Sherlock, touching one of the tall columns of coral. "It's…the inside doesn't match the outside."
He jumped, find another statue like the one from downstairs was suddenly only about four feet in front of him.
"Dear brother, if you're not too busy planning your next meal or bugging the residencies of Britain's finest, please do me a favor. On Sunday, January 12th of 2013, please call your mother. Inform her to turn around and go back the way she came as quickly as possible. A mistake has been made, and it could cost John his life. Go back, find the river, find the house, bring a hammer. Give my best to Her Majesty; Sherlock Holmes."
As soon as Sherlock screamed, it took only seconds for Rose and Mycroft to make it outside. The boy was standing behind a very angry Doctor who had taken his screwdriver back and was holding his son out of harm’s way. The screwdriver was aimed at two men both holding shotguns trained on the small family.
Suddenly Rose was there, pushing in front of the Doctor, her arms crossed tightly. “What did you just call my family? Who the hell do you think you are? We’re not hurting anyone, what gives you the right to just barge up to our home?”
"How can I possibly know who you think it is?" Sherlock shrugged flippantly. John recognized the tone; he was being purposefully petulant.
Redbeard turned suddenly whining about something in the distance. Sherlock frowned. Redbeard was a good guard dog, especially for a rambunctious boy who tended to get into trouble, but he never whined. If there were something dangerous back there he'd growl or pull Sherlock back towards camp, but he was doing neither.
"Think!" John yelled out a bit too loudly, wincing when he realized the Doctor and Rose could probably hear him. He lowered his voice, but that wavering dangerousness cut into his tone. "You're the best detective in the world, figure it out."
"Sherlock…" the blonde woman said, looking at him like he was a misbehaving toddler. "Does John have any idea who we are?"
The Doctor pretended he hadn't heard him, but Rose stopped walking. "Wait, Sherlock's right. Why's there a path without people?"
"No sleeping just yet!" the Doctor said suddenly, swooping Sherlock up off the ground and carrying him to the spread out blankets. "Lots to do."
He had to tell him. Soon. And when he did, that would be the end of his association with John Watson. Some things were too impossible to hope for. John would never be able to live comfortably in their flat once he knew that his flatmate was in love with him. He had only a few weeks left, at most. A few weeks to spend as much time with John as he could, to store up a room in his mind full of memories that he could live off of once he was forcibly removed from John's life.
They were quiet again for a minute, then the Doctor looked back at him. "Wait, what do you mean harder to hold?"
"But isn't everybody?" he asked. "Everybody gets old and dies. Even daddy gets older, just really slowly. When you're born, you start to die."
"Here boy!" The Doctor called. "Come here Redbeard." The dog jumped up and trotted over to him, laying at his feet as he patted him. "There we go. Dogs always see right through regeneration."
Sherlock didn't answer at first. He looked away from John, suddenly finding the floor very interesting. "Uh, texting. Any time before this you would be expected to call, or not have a telephone at all. I prefer to text."
John fought against a smile. "He's right though, Mycroft. I wouldn't tell anyone. Your family is safe."
The Doctor opened the flask and sniffed it, running his screwdriver over it once before pouring a little on the his hand. It rolled off harmlessly. The men seemed to relax a bit, but the shorter man nodded to Sherlock. “The kid too. It won’t hurt him.”
Sherlock looked around, quickly realizing where he was. "The TARDIS? How did I get into the TARDIS?"
The large green field certainly didn't seem remarkable, but nonetheless when they stumbled upon it the Doctor clapped his hands together and sat the bag on the ground. "Give me a hand Mike," he called. "We have to hurry."
"But you're not. Mycroft is more alien, you know that. He doesn't need people, and you do. It wasn't Mycroft who would hide in our bed when the storms got too loud. You've always preferred company, at least once in a while. It's okay to be different from your brother, Sherlock. You're part human. You can need people in any way you want to."
"I've got one!" Sherlock said as he glanced conspiratorially down at the dog following closely at the family's heels. "Someday, in a distant scary world, Dad will wear a bowtie."
They had followed the dirt trail for only a few minutes before they found the muddy stream. There was an indent in the mud where the chimney sweep had fallen. Sherlock examined the muddy pit, determining which direction the man had been running from.
"I don't think you do," John said, clearly frustrated. He stalked ahead of him, and Sherlock watched his friend's back as he quickly descended the staircase.
"It was a broken neck," John said, bending over the body of a man lying on the street. The man had scraggily hair and a beard to match, with weathered lines running across his empty face. His patched clothing was threadbare and hardly adequate, but his skin was still warm from the layer of sweat. The mud caking his thrifty shoes had left slight tracks behind him, but nothing solid enough to follow.
John was about to say something when he heard it. Somewhere within the house, up the stairs, someone was calling for help. He looked at Sherlock and the detective nodded, dashing up towards the stairs.
A/N: This one technically breaks my own rules, because Sherlock isn't necessarily a child. He is however pre-John Watson, and the flashback scene, I believe, qualifies it. Sherlock is around 25. I've been trying to write little ACITT fics but this little plot bunny wouldn't leave me alone. Let me know if you have any ideas for shorts in this fic! Thanks to everyone for the reviews and support. Enjoy!
"Oh, I think you might," he taunted in a sing-song voice. "Your office is under the impression that you are doing some undercover work in Russia, courtesy of a friend of mine who knows a thing or two about your personal correspondences. Sherlock won't notice you're missing, will he? If I send him a bothersome text from your phone every few days he'll think everything is perfectly normal."
Sherlock twisted his mouth. Rose laughed; only recently Sherlock seemed to have realized it wasn't nice to tell his mother she was too stupid to be as much help as the other people in the house.
John leaned his head back, groaning. He slipped his hand underneath Sherlock’s jumper to touch the smooth skin on his navel. This proved to be effective, because Sherlock’s whispers were turning into soft pants. John hung on every sound.
“Ooh, you’re a bad man,”  he shivered, running his nose down Sherlock’s neck, letting out a soft gasp. He had been thinking of nothing but Sherlock’s mouth for the last hour, and the git probably knew it.
He left out the part where he had woken up in John’s arms, having traversed the space between them during the expository pre-dawn hours.
And from what Rosie found in Dad’s journal that morning, there was no question as to how much he longed to know Sherlock again, too.
Sherlock nods and lets out a moan that makes John shiver. John undoes the belt and zip and slips his hand inside Sherlock’s trousers to palm his erection over his pants. It gives John a rush, confirming Sherlock is as interested in the proceedings as he is.
“You okay?” John asked, falling next to him gracelessly, reaching up to stroke Sherlock’s sweat-glazed curls. “That was intense.”
“I was only pretending to be you, John. It was mindless. No need to thank me, or feel stupidly guilty.” His cheeks are burning. He’s been caught red-handed.
, John. That insufferable squawking outside. ‘Puffinus puffinus’- the scientific name of the Manx shearwater.”
Molly knew exactly what Sherlock meant, and she had to bite her lip to stop herself from audibly sighing.
“I promise, it won’t harm you in any way,” Xiaowen assured, and Sherlock couldn’t help but believe her-
“John,” Sherlock greeted, unbearably casually. He separated from Stella, moving towards John as if he were floating. If he had paid any attention to Stella, he might’ve noticed she was reeling from what must have been an uncomfortably long hug with a stranger (had it been long? John’s timeline had been disrupted). Sherlock’s eyes scanned John’s body for deductions as he glided over, and the familiarity of the gaze was like an embrace. John wondered, not for the first time, what the detective saw. Probably something along the lines of
He steeled himself, gave the microphone back to Sherlock, and took Rosie’s hand that wasn’t tied up with Stella’s. The audience was looking around at each other as if they’d watched an entire series just to be stripped of the finale, unable to hear the next words without the microphone. Rosie didn’t care. The only people she cared to see were Stella and Dad. “Your mother did some very bad things,” Dad started, and Rosie was sent back in time to when she was nine years old, asking questions about Mom.
They screamed when they saw Rosie drive up in Dad’s old Vauxhall. “ROSIE!” The sheer volume made heads turn, and more attention from London tourists on the Isle was the last thing she wanted, so Rosie tried to make her
“Oh, I intend to thank you, Sherlock. Properly.” John smiles darkly. Sherlock swallows, a flash of excitement crossing his features.
“Yeah? Okay.” He hardly had to think. He didn’t have a shift at the surgery the next day, and honestly, he didn’t want to leave this quiet haven for the bustle of London just yet. “More wine?”
“And I’m their doctor,” John called, carrying both suitcases and receiving some distasteful glares as he slid past.
It should have been simple. All this time, all Sherlock needed to do was ask. He had wasted countless hours, days, years of his life collecting, cataloguing, analyzing, and interpreting data on the John Watson Question.
“Well, that encounter was hard evidence of our sexual attraction to each other. Of course, there were other signs, but none so glaringly obvious. You wouldn’t have proposed today if there were any doubts of my attraction to you.” John’s chest was finally exposed, his shirt and jacket and tie discarded, and Sherlock couldn’t resist tasting a bead of sweat that had gathered along John’s collarbone.
Rosie placed her hand atop his where it was resting on her shoulder. “I’ve loved the life we’ve had together, Dad.”
“Ohmygod, John,” he gasped. John looked up, gave him a questioning glance. Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, unable to articulate that
It had been years since he’d seen this, having tucked it away in the attic after a particularly nasty bout of drinking and reading and re-reading the entries ten years ago.
This was the kind of clue he could tend to overthink. But after some internal deliberation, John scribbled SCOT into the four letter boxes.
He’d always thought this kind of thing- John being in love with a man, confessing it openly- would be a bombshell for Rosie. It was a topic he’d managed to stay far away from all her life, effectively hiding that part of his identity from her so as not to challenge what she knew about herself and her family. But as always, Rosie surprised him in the best way. She knew.
John handing Sherlock his mobile for the first time. John pinning down a criminal in a back alley. John reading a terribly predictable novel in his chair at Baker Street. John starting a fire in the kitchen after a failed attempt at a wretched shepherd's pie. John learning to dance, his own hands nearly shaking atop John’s shoulder. John kissing him. Oh
John rubs his brow. He doesn’t want to face this. Lately he’s felt like a Jenga set, with critical pieces slowly being taken out, leaving him increasingly unstable. One more piece and he’s going to topple. His life was only just starting to feel normal again, as if the pieces were gradually being returned to their slots. John took an online anger management class and started therapy again, and even Sherlock is seeing a therapist specializing in drug addiction. He has a nice place, with Rosie. He and Sherlock are finally on solid ground. He thought he could keep going like this without shaking the blocks. Childish. God, he could use a drink.
John slides his hand up Sherlock’s chest to his neck to his cheek, cataloguing every bump and smooth line on Sherlock’s body he’s never been able to touch, linger on before, and possibly won’t again.
“That’s settled, then,” he said, and John swallowed. He was going to be inside Sherlock, no barriers. Every one of his nerve endings sang with want, and he had to stop himself from reaching down to take himself in hand. Sherlock’s eyes flickered down to John’s maddeningly hard cock and back up, clearing his throat in the way he did when he knew John was not going to like the next words out of his mouth. “I know where to find lubricant in this house, but you’re not going to be happy about it.”
“John, you should try some. It will be helpful for the case if you know its effects,” Sherlock suggested, and Xiaowen held out the cup in an offer.
John kisses him, more fire behind it now. Sherlock responds enthusiastically, shifting his hips slightly for more contact. “I’ve wanted...this for so...long,” John mutters between kisses. When Sherlock only responds with a teasing roll of the hips, John pulls back, breathless. With only the boxers and Sherlock’s pajamas as a barrier between their cocks, it is extremely hard to concentrate.
Sherlock was astounded. John knew, even then, that a part of him had always wanted this for them. Before Watson. Before Mary. Before Paris. He’d let it go unsaid for so long. A note of sadness sung in the air, of regrets and time lost. Sherlock held out his left hand, and John knelt to place the ring on his finger. It fit perfectly.
Iris laughed. “So you’d give it away? Please. I had a microdose and the airline was already interested in a trial run.”
“The hen party’s on the move,” she told him. People were still milling about, much of the older crowd lingering around the bar, but the event was coming to an end. Earlier, she’d thought it might be inappropriate to leave her own rehearsal dinner before everyone else did, but she found she really didn’t care at the moment.
John sat down to watch, unsure if his unsteady legs would hold him through this performance. The soft acoustic picking started drifting through the room like a warm fire through an autumn breeze. Then, when Rosie started with the lyrics, the flames burned through his remaining composure.
Can I handle juggling three long fics at once? Hopefully. I had too much of a craving to update this.
"I'm right here..." Sherlock gasped, trying to even out his breathing. Lestrade turned back to him. "He's mad at Mycroft... not at me." He felt himself shake slightly.
"Really?" Sherlock squinted at her, reading her more closely. Slytherin, their year. Blonde, small, gentle, DADA and charms focus.... He'd seen her before a few times.
By the time several police cars and Lestrade's familiar car pulled up, John had a strip of his cardigan pressed to Sherlock's forehead and Sherlock had his coat wrapped around them both for warmth. Lestrade hurried over to them as soon as his feet hit the ground, looking more concerned than John had ever seen him.
"I think there's something not being told." He shook his head. "Not sure whose secret, or if it will be relevant, but for now let's focus on Adler." He turned the laptop to John and John begin to read.
"So what did Dumbledore say about Milverton and Moran?" John asked at dinner, piling his plate high with chicken and potatoes.
"I also wondered if you might fancy helping me track down someone who's threatening a Slytherin first year."
"How bad were you hurt over the summer?" John asked. "And were you still hurt when I hit you in Diagon Alley?"
"You think this was all a ploy to get you to name the girl Sherlock?" Sherlock grinned. "I say I'm a sociopath, but I do know some people."
Irene sat back in her chair and sighed. "He's making a huge deal out of nothing. Will's father expected me to come back and marry Will, I'd said yes as a joke, I honestly thought Will was joking when he asked." She shook her head. "That was the day I came out to him."
They both rolled out of Lestrade's bed and got changed, slowly walking into the kitchen. Lestrade stood at the stove, gently poking at bacon and eggs in a pan.
Dumbledore inclined his head. "Thank you both. If you do find whoever tried to harm you, Mr Watson, get in contact with me soon. That sort of thing has no place in this castle."
John caught up with him, four days later, a potions vial in his hand, seemingly empty. He handed it to Sherlock.
John and Sherlock carried their drinks back to a table in the Three Broomsticks and sat down, sipping them gently, relieved to be out of the freezing air.
Sherlock blinked slowly. "I'm not sure." He thought to transfiguration, there had to be a way of becoming a fly, or something, to sneak into the office. "We can't become animagi, that takes ages."
Sherlock slowly passed John in the common room, not even caring why he was in their so late, just wanting to get into his bed, pull the curtains around it, and sit in darkeness.
"You're welcome to come to mine for Christmas," John said. "Harry's going by her girlfriend's. It should just be me and my parents."
"That's exactly what might be in danger of getting leaked," Dumbledore said solemnly. "Not only that, but we have been informed that this man wants to target other prominent members of the magical community as well."
'I'm making myself coffee,' Lestrade called from the kitchen. 'I have that or orange juice, which would you rather have?'
"Hello," Sherlock said, smiling. "Sherlock Holmes, John Watson. We're hoping to talk with an Irene Adler?"
"What?" Sherlock asked in a low voice, looking out the sides of his eyes at John. John would never know how Sherlock could read people to tell when they were about to ask a question.
"Sherlock, it's Lestrade." His voice came strong and reassuring, rushing into Sherlock's brain, a glimpse of reality. "We're in London, alright? You're safe. Whatever happened back then, you're safe now. John and I, we're here now to keep you safe, alright?"
"He was getting coffee with a girl a few minutes ago. Probably is still at the shop if you wanna head over there," Anderson told him.
"What about Polyjuice potion?" suggested John. "The downside is that it takes a month, but if we use that time to figure out how to get through his locked door, we could use the potion to become a couple of teachers and go in without him thinking anything of it if he catches us."
"If it was just me," Smallwood growled, "we wouldn't be here. But how many people, good people, did you decide to dig through the dirt to find out the worst about? And then to threaten them."
'NEVER do something like that again, Sherlock.' She looked up into his eyes, and he felt shame at not telling her, not giving her word. 'I will not lose my boy again, do you understand?'
"Get that look off your face," Lestrade muttered, looking at Sherlock. "Don't think for a second that we don't know that you wouldn't have done what you did without some kind of good reason behind it." He sighed very softly. "Listen, I've got a mound of paperwork back at the office to work on so im gonna head off for now. Let me know if you need anything, alright?" He smiled. "Just glad to have you back. Be careful," he said meaningfully. "Mrs Hudson dont let him get into too much trouble."
"So Milvertone is dead," Dumbledore mused. "My question, Sherlock, is why are you so unwilling to tell me who it was?"
"You sound confident in that assertion." Dumbledore's eyes had always been piercing, but some days, moreso. Sherlock held the gaze.
John sat back, fumbling for his phone as his ringtone went off, realizing he'd forgotten to silence it. Mycroft's name flashed on the lock screen; John hit ignore call, silenced the phone and repocketed it, mulling over the difference between the Holmes brothers. At least Sherlock's texting didn't tend to be so annoying.
"She continuously spreads that rumor by some kind of clues in her regular day to day conversations," Sherlock chuckled, remembering when he'd taken John to view 221b. "Thought John and I were dating first time she met him."
"And on Christmas too," Mrs. Hudson sighed. "Horrible time of the year to be stuck in hospital." Sherlock nodded.
'If I think something's serious, you're gonna let me help you, alright?' Lestrade swallowed heavy, his eyes trailing to the photo of his niece. 'Don't wanna lose you again, do we?' he said faintly.
People moved past him at their normal paces and no one looked twice at him, so Sherlock felt quickly more at ease, checking the shop windows for signs of John as he hurried by, wondering if he should linger in one place and see if his friend were to walk by.
"Ah yeah. It's been a very busy week." He shook his head. "I read of that Lord Moran's arrest last night, I assume that's why you're holding your arm so stiffly."
Class was just starting as Sherlock slid into his seat, barely listening to McGonagall's lecture. He knew he would pass the Transfiguration OWL fairly well without much revision, but if the examiner was anything like mcgonagall, he would have to work a little harder.
And he believed her. "I'm transgender. It's not relevant, but I've never told a friend by choice before. So. There we are."
'Right.' Sherlock picked up his coat and moved stiffly past him, but paused, hand on the door when his brother's voice reached out quietly again.
"Just you is alright, you know." She smiled, sitting opposite him at the kitchen table. "Sherlock's been much happier since you've come."
"Once I told him that was more in line with being a superhero, but Sherlock insisted that superheros were inferior to pirates, because pirates were ordinary people, without powers." He looked away, still smiling faintly. "Never fully understood my brother."
"I'll just find a hair of his in his office or something." Sherlock shook his head. "Who were you thinking?"
"I told him he's a fool for letting you be in so much danger over the summer." Lestrade huffed. "So what's all this about Milverton that you asked me?"
Sherlock knocked carefully on the front door, taking a heavy breath to steel himself. Then the door swung open and Mr Watson was staring at him, clear and total shock over his face.
Sorry this one was so short, it's a sort of gap filler between where I was going with this, and where it will end up!
"You're not talking about a second great war are you?" Sherlock said, his voice small in his throat. McGonagall shot him a look.
It was still early in the morning when he decided to borrow Lestrade's shower and change into clean clothes and be ready when Lestrade woke up to go wherever he would go next.
"Theater students always seem like trouble," John said, shaking his head. Then, with a glance at Sherlock, added, "And now I know to be suspicious of the nerds..."
"Are you wondering if I'm worried about William?" Sherlock asked and John looked over to him. "Because I am."
"Forgive me, I realized belatedly that I'd changed the password and thought I should come down to fetch you both." Dumbledore gestured up the stairs, smiling. "Shall we, boys?"
John was stepping forward but Sherlock's look stopped him. John stuck his hands in his pockets and sighed, looking away. "Are you...okay?" he asked softly.
I've gone back and forth on a lot of ideas for this stuff, and finally just sat down and typed one up, so hopefully this plot doesn't get too stupid.
"No." Sherlock looked at John. "I spent a long amount of time figuring out what habits Milverton keeps; he says until nearly midnight on Fridays, well after everyone has left. Good for him to get work done that others shouldn't see."
"John. If you don't want me near you, I won't. It doesn't mean I don't consider you a friend." Sherlock swallowed heavily. "I probably always will."
He started up the stairs to their flat and Mrs Hudson called after him, "You both come for dinner when Sherlock gets home!"
"I didn't think they were that strict about who we sat by." Molly blushed slightly. "Besides, you were alone, and you said you wanted to talk to me and-"
"So," he said finally, watching Mary continue to not notice some crumb on the side of her lip and finding it endearing. "I-" he lost his voice somewhere in his throat.
"You think there's more going on because a friend of Will's is in the photo?" John asked. Sherlock kept his face turned toward the clouds.
Soon they were pulling up at Baker Street in Lestrade's car. He turned to Sherlock. "Do you want me to come with you?"
"There as an affair, quite recently, a thief caught red-handed in a theft of some expensive software," Mycroft looked John in the eye. "Perhaps you would've titled it the Affair of the Red-Handed Man on that blog of yours."
Sherlock nodded. "We'll decide the rest over our break once you've heard from Mary." He hoped it would go easily enough. He had no idea what they would have to say to Milverton, or if their confrontation would only mean them later having to break in and steal anything he had on anyone else... Sherlock frowned at the thought, wondering how many people Milverton might be after currently.
And John finally turned, Sherlock smiled, and John was standing, standing looking unsettled and shocked and afraid, disbelief and anger chased themselves around his friend's features and Sherlock stood quietly, allowing it.
"That's brilliant," Sherlock said quickly. "The potion's nearly done. We should be able to get into Martin's office soon."
"He worked for some dangerous people, or so I gathered, let's leave it at that." He sat back, sighing. "If you two were more involved with his death, I'd be worried but..." He looked away. "I'm still worried, to be honest. Maybe that group got word that Sherlock took down Moriarty's gang..."
"New development, as of last night." Sherlock smirked at Lestrade. "Lestrade knew, though he pretended not too." Lestrade's face grew pink.
Sherlock laughed bitterly before he could stop himself, and a sharp pain rushed through he chest. He gasped, clutching his injured ribs, slightly regretting his refusal of any kind of magical medical treatment from Mycroft's staff. Lestrade jerked, his face quickly becoming more concerned, but Sherlock shook his head and took a step back as he leaned against the wall, making sure he could still breathe steadily.
The man stood slowly, before walking over to face sherlock and roughly grabbing Sherlock by the hair, eliciting a whimper from the abused boy.
Sherlock paused for a moment before snorting. "Are you?" He didn't even smirk at John's look. "No," he said in answer and went up into the dark.
"My husband left the record with me before they put him to death," Mrs. Hudson said. "John got sherlock a t-shirt with some of the lyrics on it, show him Sherlock."
Sherlock shrugged. "It's worth a shot. No telling what will come of any of it, really." He looked at Lestrade. "Be safe when you go to arrest this Lord Moran guy. From what I'm hearing, he's trouble."
Sherlock let a smile tug on the corners of his lips. "I have to don't I? Astronomy and History of Magic are gonna be rough."
Mycroft said. 'Be careful. It's still a dangerous climate out there. There's a threatened terrorist attack on the rise and in your absence a new teacher as been called to Hogwarts. As well as this, I have some things of my own to take care of at the ministry.'
