“Hey Gabe,” Dean risks a glance at Cas and gets lost in a deep pit of blue. He forgot how amazing Cas’ eyes are up close. “Cas.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll teach you.” Dean replies with an easy smile.
Dean lights up, “Oh you are in for a treat! This is the best damn coffee I have ever had. How do you like it? I’ll get you some.”
Everyone cheers around him and disperses to gather their things. Only once the majority of the people have gone and only Dean’s friends remain, does Dean finally allow himself to deflate a little and slump into the nearest chair.
Castiel flushes because he forgot about how Ketch feels about his glasses since he got so comfortable with wearing them around the inn. “The airplane air irritates my contacts so my glasses are more comfortable for flying. I’ll change into my contacts as soon as we are back in New York though.”
“Hiya girls! How was school today?” he asks once they get situated in the back seat of his truck.
There are people everywhere, way more than he thought could fit in the small inn. Some are sitting on the comfy looking couches reading the paper or a book. Others are in the small dining room already eating breakfast. Dean sees most of them with coffee and immediately perks up. He goes in search and almost jumps for joy when he finds the heavenly beverage. There are several different flavors available so he chooses a dark roast and adds a splash of creamer.
“Yeah sorry I hope that's ok? Castiel is a little much for the kids to remember and say correctly. Don’t get me wrong you have an awesome name, but they’re only eight,” Dean explains quietly.
Cas stares at him in shock. Dean is now standing in front of his friend pointing a finger into his chest and breathing heavily. There is only a few inches between them and the air around them is stifling. Taking a deep breath, Dean steps back and surveys the room again.
“I couldn’t find the certificate. I couldn’t save the inn. And I couldn’t finish my article,” Cas mumbles looking down at their feet. Their dance has changed to more of a slow sway than the waltz Dean was leading earlier.
“That’s Carol and Chris,” Dean states.
“Thanks, Sammy.”
It took him forever to get comfortable on the small mattress, so different from his amazing memory foam mattress he has back at his apartment. The bed creaked everytime he moved causing him to flinch hoping he didn't wake up Cas. Cas. The way the man had looked at the thing when Chris rolled it in told Dean that the man really didn't want to sleep on the old thing, probably as old as the buildings itself, so Dean just took it upon himself to claim the roll away. Honestly it was the least he could do after Cas helped him calm down on the plane. When Cas had come out of the bathroom the night before, Dean pretended to be asleep so that Cas wouldn’t ask if he was okay.
Castiel watches her go already thinking about what kind of research he will need to do for this article. He feels a weight lift off his shoulders at finally finding a topic to write about and can relax a little. That doesn’t stop him from grabbing his tablet and immediately google any information he can find. A couple hours later he decides he deserves a break and might head into town. Last night when he went out with Dean it was too dark to truly take in everything so another walk during the day would be good for him.
“Dean are you alright?” Castiel asks from the king sized bed after Dean hasn’t stopped shifting around the last couple minutes.
“Oh that’s right,” Castiel had almost forgotten that the inn will be torn down within the next year. It’s so unfortunate that this beautiful historic inn will be replaced by a generic motel with none of this charm or history.
“I swear to god if you tell me one more thing went wrong, I am going to flipping lose it.”
“Speaking of fast cats! I have a question for you guys,” Dean interrupts him. Cas sends him a glare wishing that he could smite the man here and now. Since he can’t do that, he lets the teacher have his fun this time. “Why did the cat get disqualified from the race?”
“Papa!” Claire exclaims, pushing past Dean to hug her father.
He is still smiling when he feels a presence next to him. Dean appears at his side with a small smile playing on his lips when their eyes meet.
“Cas, now is really not the time,” Dean replies through gritted teeth not even registering the nickname. Thankfully Castiel doesn’t comment further and Dean can suffer through takeoff in a somewhat peaceful manner. Once the plane has leveled out and is flying smoothly through the air, Dean relaxes minutely. He opens his eyes, squinting at the harsh light.
Unfortunately, the prince has a point and he’s really not up for argument right now, so Castiel resignedly huffs out an agreement. Dean looks about as giddy as a stable pony but when confronted to fight and reminded by Michael to “get on” with their training, he’s about as hopeless as a four-year-old, maybe even worse than Samandriel.
“No!” Anna shrieks as the two siblings simultaneously tilt their heads in a calculating but also horrified manner. Cas looks up with glassy, depressed eyes which makes Dean regret ever assuming the worst in the first place. He can’t help being a pessimist.
“Can’t it be someone else? Michael? Uriel?”
Sam seems to sense him before he is even close.
Because from their point of view, beyond the large, open inner doors lies the infamous throne room. The very throne room John had coated in several royal colors and embellished every inch with pure, dazzling shades of gold in the loving memory of the late Mary Winchester. Two epitaphs surrounded by fluid, unbroken streams line the sides of the large staircase which leads to a titanic, splendid throne of gold (literally) fit for a King, or what Dean thinks is more accurately for a God. The high ceiling is supported by considerably long, heavy beams which enables the tall, stained–glass windows to bathe the room in a soft, golden glow with sprinkles of floral, spring hues.
Cas reached over and curved a hand over Dean’s cheek, running one finger down the little bridge between his nose and upper lip. “Thank you,” he said.
“Yeah.” The sound of Dean’s voice as he breathes out the word is so tired. There’s an almost-inaudible squeak as he rubs his forehead.
rather than kiss. But a moment later, the pad of Cas’s thumb gently swept at the fullest portion of it, tugging just enough to part Dean’s lips. “He’s your partner and your best friend. You won’t hurt me.”
Dean has to push him off after an embarrassingly short period of time, gasping. By the hair, ‘cause Cas just won’t

Castiel chuckled. “Oh? Where did you hear that?”
The measuring tape unwound from Cas’s chest and poked him in the bicep. “Lift, dearie,” Rowena crooned.

And when Dean’s hand stopped moving, Castiel gently pried his beloved’s fingers free and replaced them with his own, gently milking the last few droplets out of Dean’s waning erection with what he had to acknowledge was a very possessive and completely indulgent pleasure. Dean whined and wriggled on the plain blue fabric of Castiel’s sofa, pink-faced, overstimulated.
don’t make me turn this thing off, Novak!” Dean howls, fumbling for the volume button fast enough that his hands scrape over the charging ports with a sound like maracas.
“And that’s gonna be you?” Jo laughs. “All right, G-man. All right.”
Castiel jerked awake, gasping. He knew it was before dawn, and that the world outside was still cold and quiet, just barely tinged with sunrise. There was no way he
It’s over in seconds—so fast that Dean blinks.

Dean huffs out the rest of his amusement and leans a hip against the kitchen countertop. He doesn’t know why they’re still both standing in the kitchen—other than that they went to raid Cas’s frankly obscene supply of takeout menus before they decided on something else; Dean didn’t know that there
The color of her eyes swirled faster, edging towards green, and her two tail-tips switched back and forth with amusement, drawing thick snakey lines onto the sand around them. She stuck her head out towards him very smugly, her ear horns pointing towards him in a clear invitation for scratches.
Cas stirs behind him. “Dean?” he asks, sleepily. “S’still early.”

gets him Dean’s attention. His eyebrows, which until a moment ago had seemed gathered in a near-permanent furrow, twiddle just barely upwards in surprise.
Castiel nestled in and let himself doze, too. He shouldn't be happy, he knew. Dean and Sam had lost their father—even if he'd been a demanding and unhappy man.
They pass around the thermos. The water in it is weirdly cold, so cold that it bites at Dean’s teeth with a sting. There’s enough for a mouthful for each of them. It’s better than any whiskey Dean’s ever drunk.
It’s not really a surprise since Sam is highly academic and trained well in the educational field but it doesn’t stop Castiel wishing he had a friend to train with that is his age. Occasionally sparring with Michael helps a lot, but it’s strictly educational and business-like, never any jokes like he had with his friends, before the rumour got out about him. Truthfully, the harsh treatment he has received over the years have trained his heart cold for the hobby he once found enjoyable, only ever allowed to train with the siblings he trusted most, that mainly being Anna, Gabriel and sometimes Michael when he could spare some of his time, but nothing stops the longing for a friend who shares a common interest.
“Only if you tell me a bedtime story.”
“A BIT? You are going straight to bed young man. Here,” Anna spits, flinging a clean towel at his face. “There’s a bathroom just through there, get cleaned up. I’ll get someone to fetch your bed clothes for the night, and you’re sleeping with me under my watch.” As if hearing Castiel’s silent protests and colourful curses, she adds, “no excuses,” with a strict finality to them.
A sharp stab of pain clenches his chest at hearing the brutal truth laid out by Anael before him. He can’t imagine the hardships that Anael is facing right now, - correction -, he can, and its way worse. But this ignites a new burning hope that one day, when he sits upon his father’s throne, he will change the system, no matter how long he has to wait and that’s a certainty. He will fight for his sisters and brothers till his dying breath.
There’s no answer on Cas’s door when he bangs on it, impatiently. The fact that it swings open when Dean gives it a push leaves his throat sticking. The doors are supposed to automatically lock—
without even knowing the door was still open into the hallway. He squeezed his eyes shut, gripped the carved finial of the bedpost with both hands, and breathed.
of the cave options offered to her. She and Novak had growled and circled each other warily for a few days, snapping and snarling for dominance, before they both eventually grumbled and agreed to share the queen suite of caves.
Okay. Wow.
But because Garth—Garth, of all people—hadn’t meant that little tongue of flame that had burned away Castiel’s cautious enjoyment, Castiel cut Dean off. “Thank you, Garth. I really… this is wonderful.”
“I’m going to purchase an e-reader,” he vows, to Dean’s sleeping face, folding the cover of the book closed and settling it back on the nightstand. “I promise.”
“Nothing,” Sam says, cheerfully, and that’s even
Novak snuck her nose underneath his armpit and butted his elbow upwards so he could scratch at her ear horns. They were smaller than Angel’s, her jaw more narrow. Her skin wasn’t as soft as it had been when Castiel had been a child. Or maybe that had been just the memories of a young boy. When he looked up, even in the dark he could see the shadow of the hidey-hole where, once upon a time, he’d given Dean pie and fallen in love.

And he prays.
“Dean…” Cas’s face twists.
It’s a fucking perfect day.
Castiel blinked in surprise and then in relief. His breath eased out of where it had knotted in his throat. “I, well… alright,” he agreed cautiously.
Cas’s mouth tips up, just barely, at the corners. “I don’t know why you still insist on the strange names. Lightning bugs are synonymous to fireflies,” he says, in that low, broken-gravel voice, “and I promise, my butt
” Dean started, but then Impala leapt impatiently forward, and the rest of that got swallowed up by his yelp.
“Guess so,” Dean answered, but his smile was gone. He looked away. Castiel frowned, but Dean didn’t answer the question of his gaze. They finished off their bread in small bites and comfortable silence. Well, Castiel did: Dean crammed half of the rest of his slice into his mouth and chewed, noisily.
Holy.
He’d started to suspect months ago, when Dean was always so vague in his wiretapped conversations. When he always seemed to be laughing at them; when bugs went missing or malfunctioned; when it would sometimes take days to get approval to tap Dean’s new cellphone number even though he was already a known person of interest. Kevin wasn’t wrong when he’d say, “man, does this guy ever relax?” Dean never seemed to. No one goes that long without slipping—without giving them

what the hell—took one long, curious look at Dean, then double-took, and started hooting with laughter, exclaiming, “Well, damn! Dreams do come true after all, huh, Castiel?” Cas growled and swatted the asshole. Dean’s still pretty sure his own face got so red his freckles probably looked like
Sam's face looked like it was going to cave in on itself, like a sinkhole, as he glared back and forth between them, and both Castiel and Dean found themselves laughing. It was as much release as relief, and there was very little humor to it, but it still felt good. Or… better, anyway.

Technically he isn’t really supposed to touch Cas’s mage-armor—yadda yadda, like the fact that Dean is about as magical as an iron crowbar might somehow be catching. However, since both Cas
“Welcome, brother,” he says, and he’s a guy again, with cold dark eyes. “Well done. You have been through many trials, but do not be afraid.”
“What? Girls are weird, you can’t take blame like that,” Dean says firmly, stretching his legs out in front of him. He checks the laces of his boots and grimaces. The anti-whatever of the landscapes is eating through them much faster than they were when they first started: it’s not that they’re getting ratty or fraying, they’re literally

“Hello, Dean,” Cas answers, equally mildly. “Good morning.” He sighs a little. “There are no more hash browns.”
“Wha…” he mumbled, pushing himself off the pillow.
Dean grinned, shaky. Happy. “Way to a man’s heart?” he teased, flirty in a way he’d kind of forgotten he knew how to be, and it didn’t quite make it there in the beginning. But the tremor in it straightened out by the time he got to the end.
know what he’s doing, and this time, all you have to do is hold on, Sam.” Riot surged to his feet, muscles moving in a graceful ripple under his chestnut-brown skin. Jody patted Sam’s calf, high overhead. “Have fun!”
He likes people, sometimes even when they feel they don’t deserve it. Maybe especially when. They are the ones who are rarely liked: the weird and the quiet and the random, the fierce and the fighter. He understands this: he’s one of them.
“You know sign language?”
He gets a genuine smile in return and his heart starts beating a mile a minute. “Thank you Dean.”
“Thanks Claire,” Cas replies, blinking away the moisture and looking away. Dean chuckles quietly, knowing how much his friend hates getting emotional about some things. “Emma helped a lot, she really has an eye for design.”
Claire rolls her eyes and returns her focus to the other side of the counter, just staring at the wall. “I’m fine, I would’ve been back tonight, just didn’t want to be at the hotel today.”
“Mind if I cut in?” Ketch asks in his smarmy British accent. Dean is so in shock from the turn of events he can't do anything, but watch as Ketch grabs Castiel’s hand and pulls him away from Dean. Ketch pulls Castiel into his arms and they start dancing similarly to what Dean and him were doing only moments before. Castiel looks at Dean with something in his eyes that Dean can’t make out clearly. Not able to watch them anymore Dean turns away and finds the closest source of alcohol.
Dean feels a growl forming in the back of his throat and is seriously about to lose his shit.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why don’t you focus on finding that certificate you’re looking for instead, so you can finish your article and save the inn?” Dean suggests trying to find something to distract Cas from the photo.
“Dean?” the blonde asks from her seat on the stool by the counter. Dean walks over to her and pulls her to his chest.
Claire and Emma have so far been enjoying life on the island and seem happy enough. They’re only a week into this whole journey so he's really hoping they continue being happy here. School starts in about a month which will take up most of their time but by then they will hopefully have settled more firmly into island life. They both are incredibly smart girls and have never had a problem with school work before so Dean is pretty convinced there will be little, if any, issues.
Blank stare.
“Yeah, sure buddy. Why wouldn’t we be?” Dean doesn't miss Cas’ flinch at the name. It has been years since Dean has called him buddy. It just never felt right after he realized how deep his feelings for his best friend really were. Now though, it's a defence mechanism and they both know it.

That’s not even taking into account any of the other many attributes Cas has. The man is wicked smart and has this sarcasm and sense of humor that Dean just absolutely loves. And his smile. God don’t even get Dean started on how mesmerizing Cas’ smile is. The man has a few that come out at different occasions. There’s the polite one that he uses with strangers, there’s the smirk that comes out when he makes one of his sarcastic remarks, and then there’s Deans favorite. The gummy smile that only comes out when Cas is really happy. His nose scrunches up and all of his perfect straight white teeth show. That one is rare but Dean has made it his goal to make it appear as much as possible.
Dean wakes up to something tickling his nose. He blinks his eyes open, glaring at the bright sunlight filtering in through the curtains. Looking down he sees a mess of dark hair laying on his chest, the sight makes him smile and he leans in a little bit more to nuzzle against the soft strands. The scent of honey and vanilla that he has come to enjoy so much the last few days makes him hum in contentment. Waking up to the real thing instead of a pillow like the morning before is so much better.
Watching the two girls interact now, whispering to each other and giggling with bright smiles on their faces, Dean gets a brilliant idea. His own face lights up with a bright smile as he returns his attention to the adults talking next to him. He’s not sure where they were at in their discussion but he cuts in anyways.
He didn’t mind relinquishing some of Dean’s attention to his plants, though. He was proud of them, and if he had been a member of his little collection of succulents, he himself would have preened under the happy little smile that Dean was showering them with now.
Eileen shakes her head, sending dark brown waves shaking on either side of slender cheeks. “Just walked right past and into the back rooms like he knew where he was going. Is it true you two took down the Abbadon hurricane?” she asks, pulling Dean over to the bar by his wrist. She slides around behind it like she owns the place—he blinks again—and pours him a glass of ale. “The one that was going for, what was it, six days?”
And a world with polar bars in armor, aeronauts in hot air balloons, gyptians riding around on waterways in flat-bottomed boats, where witches fly around with geese rather than sneaking little hex bags into everything? Dean can be into that. Way better than staring out the bus window. Or reading his textbooks.
” Then Dean blinks, frowning into the darkness and letting his eyes drift closed again. For some reason, the darkness behind his eyes isn’t as freaky as the absolute darkness overhead. He lets the microphone of the radio come to rest on his chest. “Waittasec. But Jo knows you’re…”

“Hey!” Dean growls. “I’m not

His shout of laughter at finding out that Gabriel Novak doesn’t act in porn, he
But Dean’s shoulder, where the lash had wrapped around it—where Cas had put a hand on it and burned him—hurt like hellfire through the pad of clean bandages, beating through his temples like the sound of gongs. And he had never really much been into being bossed around by someone he didn’t know from the Lord of Light.
“Hey,” Castiel complained weakly. He wasn’t really sure
Dean could tell him the truth, though. He could tell him that he’s bi, and he doesn’t think Cas would care. No, he knows he wouldn’t. Cas would be the first damned person Dean’s said those words to, and there would be something so weird and so right about that.
Castiel’s best friend was flushed and gorgeous, and he didn’t look away from the growling, egg-wet dragonet whose little legs were kicking sand behind him as he puffed over the sands towards them.
Castiel knew his staring could be a problem, but he couldn't help it. He couldn't believe his ears. Just because he’d
Patty wrinkles her nose. “I guess. He’s kind of a weird nerd, though. Like… he won’t join Quiz Bowl even though he gets, like, straight As in everything! Bartholomew on the football team hates him—wouldn’t stop talking bad about him for, like, a month.” She lowers her voice. “Called him ‘Assteel’ for a while.”
The herald commences in listing off another two names after which each respectful title, a scrawny, identical figure claims. A certain “Prince Balthazar” and “Prince Gabriel” bow so deep and drawn-out it almost becomes mocking and Dean ponders whether the display was purposeful. You could tell they were brothers of the closest kind, both donning golden locks and the same petite build. Uncomfortably, they are both also wearing an uniform, uncanny smirk that edges between that of playful and polite. Dean observes the squirming Sam beside him. He couldn’t lie that he wasn’t a bit shaken himself.
The atmosphere around them comes to an abrupt halt as Sam and Cas share a look of confusion. The lighthearted tone is gone instantly and instead the air is laced with awkwardness.
“...You need to apologise though. I don’t care what we have to do, I am taking you to her whether you like it or not. We have to convince her it is not what she saw.”
Quick Chapter Update! This Chapter is not as lengthy as the previous one, but I hope you enjoy!
Thinking there is more to the story, Dean waits in silence but the pause stretches on and Anna has already turned to stare hard at her cold breakfast. Confusion muddles his mind as he replays the story in his thoughts, seeking out the horrid, sinful deed that has managed to get his guests so worked up over. Unimpressed, Sam glares daggers his way and he is about to give in when suddenly it all clicks into place.
But as night fades into dawn, he falls asleep dreaming of other knights in the battlements fighting bravely among green fields and valleys within clear orbs of hypnotising power.
“She can’t get off the island so we will find her Cas,” Dean promises. “Emma, can you check out the rest of the hotel grounds to see if she's hiding anywhere here while we go to town and see if she's there? I’ll see if Jo can go to Cesar and Jesse’s.”
— — —
By the time Dean makes it back to the inn the sky has darkened considerably and it's almost time for the festival to begin. He can see people running around getting the place ready and if he thought the place looked like Christmas exploded in it before, it is nothing compared to what it is now. Christmas lights are hung up everywhere. More decorated trees are placed inside and out. Candles, which smell absolutely amazing, are lit on every surface giving a warm and cozy feel to the already welcoming inn. A week ago Dean would’ve hated everything about this, but now it brings a smile to his face and he takes in the holiday joy surrounding him.
“Lions are the second largest cat in the whole world!”
Dean watches from the sidelines, a smile permanently etched onto his face. The hotel officially opened that morning and there has been an endless stream of guests filing in through the large double doors. He never thought he would see this day arrive, yet it's here and more amazing than he ever dreamed.
Dean doesn’t doubt that one bit. The lady has a way of knowing things before you even open your mouth and Dean stopped questioning her about it months ago.
Cas’ heart warms a bit at those words. It’s true, he really does love bees. He allows a small smile to play on his lips as he turns his attention back to the kids. They make their way to the next exhibit of American black bears. Surprisingly, Dean is quiet the whole time and only gives his attention to a little blonde girl when she asks him a question. It’s when they move on to the panda habitat ten minutes later that Dean gets that look in his eye again. Cas mentally prepares himself, having an idea of what is about to happen.
A cool hand closes over his own, shocking Dean enough to open his eyes. Cas’ tan skin covering his pale white skin. Cas curls his fingers around Dean’s palm and starts rubbing soothing circles with his thumb on the back of Dean’s hand. Dean watches, unable to breathe for an entirely different reason now. It takes a while but Dean’s heart rate settles down to a more normal pace and he can breathe a little easier. Neither one of them has spoken a single word, content to sit in silence as Dean’s body finally calms down. His fingers unclench from the arm rest and his hand settles with Cas’ thumb still moving in small circles.
“Maybe,” Castiel grumbles under his breath causing Dean to throw his head back in laughter. The sight is mesmerizing. And the sound is musical. Castiel tried to savor the moment for as long as he possibly can.
“Thank you Mr. Winters,” Castiel replies with a sad smile.
“Well Sammy is a nerd so you two will get along just fine,” Dean teases, causing Castiel to glower at him when really he's just happy to see Dean feeling better. “Eileen, his wife, is deaf but can read lips really well, Sammy and I can also translate anything that gets lost. They have two little girls, Mary and Liz, and they are the most adorable little four-year-olds ever. Then there's my uncle Bobby. He's a bit gruff but really is just a giant teddy bear.”
“Us too!” Claire says from the table, indicating herself and Emma.
“You haven't found the certificate have you?” He asks quietly. Cas just shakes his head then removes his hand from Dean’s and walks out the room without another word. Dean watches him go, his heart clenching in his chest. He wishes there was something he could do to help Cas but he doesn't know what he could do besides find the certificate. Which frankly at this point would literally take a Christmas miracle. Dean was fortunate enough to have one Christmas miracle happen to him already; he doesn’t know the chances of another happening are very high.
“Yes home,” The British man continues. “I want you to come meet my parents back in New York and we can have the big family Christmas we were planning on. What do you say?”
“So you’re coming with us?”
“We were talking last night and it got me thinking. I have a great relationship with my brother and I shouldn’t let what happened in the past take away time from him,” Dean explains. Cas knows there's more to the story and he really wants to ask what happened in the past but he knows it's not his place. Luckily, Dean answers his unasked questions without prompting.
“Well it's sure nice to meet all of you finally. Dean doesn’t stop talking about you guys. Well, you guys and Castiel,” she says with a knowing smile. Dean blushes but doesn’t deny it. Every single one of them there knows about his feelings for Cas, even Emma. His daughter has tried to get him to talk to Cas on many occasions, but Dean doesn’t want to risk anything and she knows that so she lets it go for the most part. She does still send him pointed looks every now and then which Dean very maturely ignores.
It’s one of those days in the late fall where the sun still shines, keeping the temperature bearable before the harsh winter makes its way to town. There is a gentle breeze that blows by, picking up a few fallen leaves in its path. The air is fresh and clean. Some might say it’s a perfect autumn day… Castiel is not one of those people. He started his day running late, rushing out the door, barely remembering to grab his coat from the hanger. His coffee mug, however, was not so lucky to be remembered. The sad travel mug was left sitting on the counter for the rest of the day, slowly growing colder as time goes on.
Castiel looks at him and just blinks. Dean panics, thinking he might have made a mistake in asking. Their girls might be best friends but... Dean and Castiel? Practically strangers. Dean knows nothing about him and in turn Castiel knows nothing about Dean. If Dean was in Castiel’s position with an almost complete stranger offering to watch his kid Dean would probably be staring at them in confusion too. Castiel has his head tilted slightly to the side and his eyes narrowed. The look is actually kind of unnerving, causing Dean to blush and look away.
Dean leads them out into the hallway and to the main area where most of the crew is working hard. With an encouraging nod Dean tells Cas to head for the villa and he will join him later with some food.
Seven months in, with who knows how many more to go, and Dean is in hell. Day after day, they are destroying one thing and fixing another. The list is endless and new things get added to it every time Dean looks at it. The crew is tired. Dean is tired. Everyone is tired.
Claire simply blinks her bright blue eyes and tilts her head slightly to the left, reminding Dean of her father once again. “Are you done?”
And Cas does. He tells Dean about how he was always interested in cool unique buildings when he was a kid and that drove his interest in architecture. However, after all of the schooling and a few years of work experience he was slightly disappointed to find that it didn't live up to his expectations. During his time working as an architect he dealt a lot with structural engineers and was fascinated by the work they did. He became pretty close friends with one of them and he helped Cas study for the FE, fundamentals of engineering, exam which was all he needed to do to be able to work at a firm.
Before Charlie can even exit the door, both Dean and Castiel are shoving their things into their bags and following the redhead out. They instantly start talking over the other pleading their case on why they are better than the other.
“Of course not, you’ll always have a job with us. But what will you do here?” he asks.
“Well what do you suggest doing then?” Cas raises his voice to a shout and whirls around to face Dean. Sure enough his eyes are rimmed in red and there are tear tracks running down his cheeks. The sight breaks Dean’s heart and he wants nothing more than to kiss them away and hold the man against him until everything is right in the world. “I can’t just turn off my feelings for you! Believe me I've tried!”
He has a lot of money from a trust fund, which Dean teased him endlessly about when he discovered that fact. However, Cas is always quick to remind Dean that he hasn’t once touched the money. Castiel told him that it feels like his parents just threw money at him instead of attention or affection while growing up, so he has always hated his parents' money and refuses to touch it. His mother owns a very successful law firm which turned into the family business of sorts with three of Cas’ siblings now working there. His father is a published author with a widely popular sci-fi series that brought in even more money to the family. With two successful parents that are entirely focused on their separate careers, it doesn’t leave much time, if any, to raise kids. So it was nanny after nanny for the Novak children.
Dinner passes with laughter and nonstop talking between all of them. Claire is more active than Dean has ever seen her and it makes him happy seeing her smile. Cas smiles too and Dean doesn’t think he has ever seen a more beautiful smile, besides Emma’s of course. Dean constantly has to keep reminding himself that Cas is not available, hell he doesn’t even know if Cas is into guys at all. Maybe he should mention that he's bi in case it makes Cas uncomfortable and he doesn’t want Claire hanging around anymore. Dean doesn’t think Cas would be that type of guy though. It's probably best to leave things how they are now. Emma is happy, Claire is happy, Cas is happy, and Dean is happy. There is no need to change that.
“Yep since Christmas apparently,” Dean replies, his voice also softer.
“You like him, don’t you?” Gabe asks. Dean is surprised to hear no mockery in the shorter man's voice.
“Dean!” a high pitched voice calls to him from one of the poolside chaises. Dean pauses his stride and closes his eyes before turning to face Claire. She stares at his packed bag with her brows pulled together in an expression so similar to her father’s it breaks Dean’s heart all over again. “Where are you going?”
“Are you leaving dear?” She asks.
After Cas finishes his second beer he switches to water, since he does have to drive home later that night and it technically is still a work night for him. Luckily it is Friday and then it's the weekend and he can relax for a couple days. In the time it took for Cas to finish his beers about ten people have sung their songs and Cas knows he’s gotta be coming up soon. Two more people go by, one doing a horrid rendition of a Queen song that causes Cas to cringe. He does clap when they finish, mostly because it's over, but also to be nice. The other did a surprisingly wonderful job singing a country song that Cas is unfamiliar with, but the guy sounded great.
“It's keeping me distracted so yes I do seriously have to play this right now,” Dean replies with equal agitation in his voice. Can’t the guy just leave him and his misery alone?
Dean pulls back slightly and finds the most beautiful sight in front of him. Cas is looking up at him with tears in his eyes, happy tears, and a watery smile on his face. Unable to resist the urge any longer Dean leans in and brushes their lips together one more time. Then again and again. Until the kisses grow deeper, more emotion pouring into each one. Each one more than the last. They have years of this to make up for.
“You alright there man?” Dean asks with a cautious smile.
Several hands go up in the air and the gear is passed around. Claire and Emma are the first into the cool water, immediately heading for the closest underwater cave. Dean and Cas have taken them here before so they know what they are doing and how to be safe. Charlie follows soon after, her red hair a bright beacon in the water. Somehow Jess talks Sam into it and Dean throws his head back in laughter as he watches his brother hesitate before jumping in.
Castiel has been staring at books on and off for the last four hours trying to come up with something,
The hours go by and eventually it is time for them to head back to the inn. Dean promised Cas that they would get back early enough for Castiel to do some more research. After spending time with Dean’s family though Castiel really doesn’t want to leave. They say their goodbyes with hugs all around and then the two men climb back into Rudolph to head back.
Dean is shocked into silence by the fact that Castiel read his articles. “Well what about your article about saving the great barrier reef? That one inspired me to actually do the deep sea diving in hopes that I could see what you wrote about.”
The next few minutes are passed in a strange tense atmosphere as both men take periodic sips from their bottle. Dean checks the water to see if it is boiling and adds the pasta when he sees it's ready. Cas sits at the kitchen island on one of the barstools Dean has there, watching him work as Dean prepares the ingredients for the creamy garlic and cheese sauce.
“We will find her Cas.”
“You’ll always be Sammy to me!” Dean says cheekily. “What can I do for ya? I got a busy day and I’m running late so you gotta make this quick.”
“Hello, we really need to get on the next flight to Aspen. We have work to do and our jobs are on the line, so it is imperative we get there immediately,” Castiel states with what he hopes is a friendly smile. His people skills are rusty though so he's not quite sure what he looks like. Apparently, it didn’t work though because the lady behind the counter gives him a flat look.
“That's good to hear!” Chris says behind Castiel as he makes his way over to his wife for a chaste kiss.
“Regrettably? Who even talks like that?” Dean scoffs.
“I didn’t even catch your names!” The woman says again looking at them apologetically.
“Hey there little Mary, how are you?” he asks, tightening his arms around her and standing up. He grunts a little under the weight. She keeps growing and pretty soon he won't be able to pick her up anymore.
“We have the Cosmic Cowboy this week, an American Pale Ale. Wanna give it a try?”
The line goes dead.
Letting a heavy sigh go Dean looks around the room and his attention catches on Chris studying the picture from earlier. Dean watches the man look at the picture with a fond expression and with something that looks like reminiscence which doesn't make any sense at all considering the picture is from 1842. Chirs takes the picture and safely secures it in one of his jacket's inner pockets before turning his attention back to one of his helpers.
“What are you looking at?” Ketch’s voice spooks him from where the man stands next to him looking out the window frowning at the dark sky.
— — —
“What do you want Meg?” he asks, standing up so that he towers over her instead of the other way around.
She leaves them be to finish their breakfast but neither make a move to continue eating. Dean knows what they need to do next but he is really dreading doing it. The two writers look at each other and Dean can tell they’re on the same page. They need to call Charlie.
“Who's all scheduled to come first?” Cas asks, looking over at Dean.
Dean kneels down to be at eye level. “Hey princess, what's going on?”
“What about you Mary? What flavor would you like? Missouri has mango, pineapple, sugar apple, grape, strawberry, coconut, anything sound yummy?” Dean asks his niece.
Castiel and Dean stare at their daughters in shock. They really shouldn’t be surprised though. Both of them are incredibly smart and independent, so it makes perfect sense that they would have everything figured out before Dean even thought about the logistics of it all. A proud smile forms on Dean’s face as he opens his arms for a hug. His little girl walks into them with a smile of her own and Dean holds her tight. He kisses the top of her head before releasing her.
Song: Shake It Off by Taylor Swift
“Santa Claus?” Dean looks at Cas trying to figure out if he’s basing serious or not. “You’re kidding right? You know Santa doesn’t exist right?”
Claire stares at him when he pulls away, her mouth opening and closing as she searches for something to say. Dean offers a small smile before turning and walking towards the boat. Somehow he feels even worse now than he did before and he didn't think that was even possible. In his haste to get away he completely misses the devastated look on Claire’s face and the moment when the panic sets in.
Well Charlie is no help whatsoever.
. God it has been years since he has felt any kind of intimacy like simply holding hands. He's not a saint by any means. There are one night stands every once and awhile when he has the time.
“Christmas miracle my ass,” Dean mumbles under his breath. Castiel can’t help but chuckle slightly. Yeah, a Christmas miracle would be real nice right about now.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“What's all this raucous I hear?” a different voice comes from the hallway. Castiel turns in time to see an older man round the corner in a wheelchair with a scowl firmly set on his face. “What the hell are ya doin’ here, ya idjit?”
Emma pulls back to look at her dad. Water still pools in her eyes, making the green more vibrant than ever. Dean gently swipes his thumb on her cheeks, making the tear tracks disappear. “What?”
Castiel turns and sees a smirk on Dean’s lips, but he does as he is told and takes a sip. The sweet liquid hits his tongue and he realizes it is made exactly how he likes it. Confused, he looks back at Dean as they walk. “You drink your coffee with two sugars too?”
Then, Castiel sees him. Dean Winchester. Tall, light brown hair that is perfectly styled as always, a shining smile, and those damn bow legs. The morning sun filters through the trees highlighting the man’s hair making it appear more blonde. Castiel knows that once the teacher gets closer he will be able to see the sparkle in the bright green eyes and the dusting of freckles over the man’s face. He knows he has to get a hold of himself. He can’t stare at the teacher the whole time, it wouldn’t be fair to the kids. It’s not his fault that the man is unfairly gorgeous though. Cas feels someone elbow him in the side and turns to see Gabriel looking up at him with mischief sparked in his eyes and a lollipop in his mouth.
“Um yeah! Come on it’ll be fun!” the other man says grabbing onto Castiel’s arm and leading him to a small building at the edge of the rink.
Dean nods his head slowly, unable to make eye contact with the young woman. “Yeah, Cas and I just need a break from each other for a little bit.”
Dean glances at the guy next to him hoping to share the experience of their girls hopefully becoming friends. Instead of watching the girls like Dean the other guy has turned and moved a few steps away.
Dean sees two men standing together in zookeeper uniforms looking at the entrance expectantly. The shorter one has light brown hair that would rival Dean’s little brother’s hair in length. But the other man. He really catches Dean’s attention. A little shorter than Dean himself, but still fairly tall and a mop of dark hair that is just begging to have fingers run through it. When the class gets closer Dean is met with deep blue eyes that almost seem to glow. Dark hair and blue eyes? Dean is so screwed. That's not even mentioning the other features this gorgeous man is blessed with. A strong jawline, a full pair of soft lips, and a body Dean can’t seem to take his eyes off of. The shorter man clears his throat pulling Dean out of his trance and when he looks over a knowing smirk fills the man's face. Dean feels heat make its way up the back of his neck from embarrassment at being caught and turns back to the blue-eyed man. Of course, that didn’t help at all. Blue eyes squint at him with a slight head tilt which has absolutely no right being equal parts incredibly attractive and adorable.
“Yeah, cause it's fun,” Dean says with a shrug. “Plus it is so much easier to flirt with women than with men! I mean I could charm a woman without even trying since we both know it won’t go anywhere, but put me in front of an attractive guy and I turn into a blubbering mess.”

He knows it is not his place to tell Claire any of this, but he has to do something to make her see what's really going on. Castiel trusted him enough to tell him everything and Dean knows he is planning on telling Claire everything too. Dean figures if he tells Claire enough then Cas can fill in the rest later and be better suited to answering Claire’s questions.
The poolside bar isn’t set to open until later in the afternoon, but Dean takes a moment to admire how it turned out. Cas had a vision for this space, he wanted the whole poolside area to be the standout feature. Obviously Dean did everything in his power to bring that vision to life and if the kiss Cas rewarded him with was anything to go by, Dean thinks he did a freaking fantastic job.
An hour later his classroom is once again empty of students. With everyone else gone, Cas is left at his desk organizing his things. A knock at his door startles him and he looks up to see his long time friend from college, Meg. They met their freshman year of college -- well, Cas’ freshman year of majoring in education. He did spend three years pursuing a degree in economics before switching over to education. At first he was a little self conscious of being one of the oldest in his classes, but then he found others like him. Meg took two gap years after graduating highschool, one to travel and one to work, before starting college. The woman basically adopted Cas as the only person she will actually talk and be somewhat nice to, a couple weeks into the term. Cas went along with it because there really was no one else, and somehow the two ended up working really well together. They became best friends by the time they started their second term. By some miracle they both somehow ended up getting a job at the same high school after they graduated.
Finally the other end of the line goes quiet. Dean closes his eyes and runs his hand over his face to calm himself down. He takes a deep breath and opens his eyes to find Claire standing in front of him with a mixture of worry and guilt on her face. With his free hand he reaches out and pulls her into his side for a hug. To his surprise, and great relief, she wraps her arms around his waist and clings to him tighter. She buries her face in his chest and he leans down to gently kiss the top of her head while running his hand up and down her back soothingly.
“See what?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you going to write your article about the best coffee then?”
“What?” Dean and Cas say at the same time.
“How come?” Dean knows he shouldn’t pry since he, himself, didn’t tell Cas everything.
“Thank you so much, I owe you.”
“Tried to tell me it didn’t mean anything,” Dean sighs, defeated.
“Hey Winchester!”
“I’m Dean, by the way!” he shouts, throwing a hand in the air in some kind of wave.
“I don’t even know where else to look. I talked to Emma and she said she hasn’t seen her either and Claire won't answer her texts which is weird since she always replies to Emma. Where could she have gone Dean? Did she run away? I thought everything was fine this morning. Yes she was a bit cool and distant but she always is! And you know I’m not very good at reading people, not even my own daughter. Gosh I’m the worst dad ever! I lost my daughter!!”
“Cas that’s not possible. You and I both know that.”
Lisa was the perfect balance between adventurous and settled. She had a good house and a well paying job. She took care of Ben like the rockstar mom she was. Plus she was hot as hell, which Dean loved of course. The two of them got along so well and the kids did too. Emma adored Ben and Ben didn’t hesitate to take little five year old Emma under his wing. Dean really saw his whole future right there in front of him. All they needed was the dog and they would have the whole apple pie life he had always dreamed of.
Gentle hands shake him awake and Castiel blinks his eyes open to find Dean smiling at him softly.
“I do not snore!” Cas exclaims incredulously. Dean just laughs again before calling for Claire and heading back to the hotel to get back to work.
which you should check out if you haven't seen it already.
“Who did she run to last time, Cas? Was it you? No, she ran to me because I was the better option!” Dean throws back at the other man. Cas opens his mouth to yell at Dean again but before he can get a word out Claire speaks up.
“Merry Christmas, my love,” Chris says.
Dean’s blood runs cold. Arthur Ketch. As in Cas’ ex-boyfriend.
“Hey there Dean-o,” Meg trills, completely satisfied with herself. Dean doesn’t even want to think about why that may be.
“How is that not fair? That she-devil has changed nearly everything and she always does it when we are over half way done with the original plan!” Dean yells. He is so fed up with having to go back and change everything just because Meg thinks her idea would be better. Dean did manage to talk her and Cas out of a few, but most of the time they have to go back and start again. It's time and money that they don't have to spare at this point and Dean is done.
“Castiel, good to meet you sir?” Cas holds out his hand but Bobby just stares at him before turning his chair around and rolling down the hallway he came.
“They’re just so boring and wordy!”
“Wait, this is your first time with us right?” Charlie nods her head with a smile on her face. “Are we sure you have all of the koala-fications for this job?”
“There he is now,” Chris replies, looking over Dean's shoulder.
“Oh good, we’re moving! All of this waiting has been un-bear-able,” Dean chuckles along with a few of his students. The pun quickly turns Cas’ smile into a glare directed at the man. Of course, it doesn’t help matters at all. Dean’s smile just grows bigger from his reaction. Cas lets out a sigh and continues walking, he knows he shouldn’t let the man’s antics get to him. He makes a promise to himself to try harder not to react to Dean’s puns and just enjoy the tour with the students. If Cas is being honest with himself though, he is a little curious to see if Dean has any new puns from the previous year. You would think he would’ve  run out of new puns by now, but no such luck. So far, Cas has heard all of these in previous years. Dean always has at least one new one each year though. With the tour starting it is a slight relief knowing that Dean has to follow in the back to make sure they don’t lose any kids, so Cas gets a small break.
They walk in silence the rest of the way, letting the idle chatter from their friends behind them be the background noise. The forest opens up to a small cliffside with a pool of deep blue water at the bottom and a small rocky outcropping perfect to hang out on. Dean follows the small worn path on the side of the cliff down to the outcropping. He offers a hand to help the others down and takes Mary into his arms when Sam hands her to him. Benny and Cas set the bags of gear down and Emma immediately digs into them, pulling out six sets of snorkeling gear.
“I can’t lose you.”
Did he ever enjoy sleeping with Ketch? He can’t even remember what their relationship was like even though it has only been a month since the break-up. They were together for two years. You would think Castiel would have some kind of happy memory with the man he thought he loved. Now the only happy memories he can think of are from the past week alone. All the times he had a quiet moment with Dean. Or a moment where Dean was laughing at something Cas said. Those are the memories that bring a smile to Cas’ face. Eventually, Cas is able to drift into a restless sleep with thoughts of Dean circulating through his mind.
Morning dawns bright and early. Harsh sunlight hits Dean’s face, causing him to groan and roll over onto his back, only to find himself now half way on top of something firm, but still very comfortable. Dean buries his face more into his new pillow and settles down for a few more minutes of precious sleep.
Dean has been waiting for this day to come for well over a month and now that it’s finally here he can’t keep the smile off his face. It’s field trip day. He was able to convince, it really didn’t take much, the principal to allow him to take his class to the zoo for a day. When he brought it up to his class the kids were so excited he couldn’t get them to focus back on their writing for at least ten minutes. Permission slips signed and two parent volunteers to help corral the kids he started to plan his whole day. There's a chance Dean is more excited than the kids are, he hasn’t been to a zoo in ages. It’s safe to say that the night before, Dean didn’t get more than a couple of hours of sleep.
Cas’ blue eyes fill with unshed tears and he hastily wipes beneath his glasses before they fall. “Do you really mean that?”
“Of course he is the town Santa.”
She must decide on something because her face lights up with an idea. “You know what I think? I think it’ll be good for you to meet someone new! Maybe someone in Colorado.” She does a little eyebrow wiggle that totally does not suit her in the slightest. “You need to be open to try new things! Let your hair down and enjoy life for once!”
Taking a quick shower, Dean spends more time than he would like to admit styling his hair. He wants to look good, sue him. He decides to leave the little bit of scruff that has grown out liking it a lot more than his usual clean-shaven self. When he puts the suit on he is shocked to see just how well it fits. He leaves the top couple buttons of his shirt unbuttoned and he's gotta admit he looks damn good. It gives him the boost of confidence he needs to settle his nerves just enough to head down to the party in search of Cas. He finds Chris and Carol right away greeting their guests and their faces light up when they catch sight of him.
It's the most honest Dean has been all night and it leaves him feeling vulnerable. He felt like he owned Castiel that answer though.
Claire studies him for a moment. He forces himself not to break eye contact and to show her how much she is loved and wanted. Finally she nods her head and goes in for another hug. Dean allows himself to relax, knowing the hard part is over and that most things will be alright. The divorce won’t be easy on any of them, especially Claire, but they’ll get through it. When they pull apart for the last time, Dean grabs his food and slides it closer before shoving a few, now cold, fries into his mouth.
“That day was the day your dad discovered your mom had found a new dealer and nearly overdosed. Your dad had to take her straight to the hospital and that was why your dad was running late to pick you up. I didn’t know the reason until years later. Your dad took your mom's overdose as his fault. If he hadn’t made you guys move she would’ve gone to her normal dealer with the ‘safer’ drug and the overdose would never have happened.”
“You don’t remember seeing me pressed against a wall with his…”
“Bobby said he would be more than happy to have you two stay with him,” Dean answers.
Luckily, when Cas gets to work he is able to get some coffee from the staff room before heading to his office. He sinks down into his semi-comfortable chair, holding the mug to his face in hopes it’ll improve his mood. All too soon the mug is empty and Castiel is left looking at the calendar on his desk. He stares at the boxes blankly for a few seconds, refusing to accept what day it is. You see, Cas is a zoo keeper at the city zoo and he really does love his job! He loves hanging out with the animals, feeding and playing with them, he loves his coworkers (most of the time), and he even loves giving tours to groups of people and interacting with all of the other guests. There is, however, one day each year that he needs time to properly prepare for. Today just so happens to be that day. As if his day needed more things to go wrong. There in a bright red pen, the two words he was not prepared for.
