“We have met,” Sherlock confirmed, no question in his statement.  He glared at him with narrowed eyes that flicked across him with lightning speed as he studied him from head to toe.
“Leave the suspects to me. Your job is to distract the other ones so that I can speak with the three of them separately.”
They shook hands again as Ron nodded enthusiastically.  “Definitely.  I was serious about you stopping over – everyone would love to see you again and meet Sherlock.  Merlin, you’ve never even met Rose and Hugo!”
“But that’s impossible!  I was there watching from across the street when they found ‘em, it was only the Met, I swear!  I checked ‘em all before I swanned off, not a wizard in sight!”
John took his hand again and squeezed.  “You ready?”  Sherlock’s only response was to nod, and John guided him to their destination.
As Sherlock worked his tongue and lips around John’s nipple, one of his hands snuck over to grasp around on the bed. Eventually he knocked against the bottle of lube he was searching for, inadvertently humming his success against John. In response, John’s hips kicked up as he bucked into Sherlock, dislodging his mouth. When John’s eyes shifted down to look at Sherlock, it was to see him blinking down at him, his face shiny with his own saliva.
could say no to someone who still has thighs like those…” Sherlock’s yell for them to hurry up interrupted whatever else he might have said. John attempted to shake off the blush that came from the conversation and hurried them from the flat to the cab waiting for them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right.”  John slapped his hands on his thighs and scraped at them with his palms, blue eyes watching McGonagall with determination.  “What would Harry like me to do?  I won’t let these people do what’s been done to me, not if I can help it.”
Doyle ran his nose along the back of Sherlock’s neck and laughed low against the skin there.  “Only when that prey is as particularly delicious as you.  You’ve been avoiding me, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Other than getting a statement from Sherlock, I think we’re all set,” Harry said, keeping his eyes fixed on Sherlock throughout.  “Since Doyle’s freely admitted to everything, if you just write up a decent summary of all of the incidents with a focus on the last one, we should be great.  You all have done this enough times in the Muggle world that you know how it goes.  If I need an in person interview, I’ll let you know.”
Mycroft shook out his umbrella at the entrance, his expression knitted with doubt.  John waved him over and Mycroft carefully picked his way through the close tables.  When he spotted James, one of his eyebrows cricked up in the faintest sign of confusion.  “Major James Sholto.  A pleasure.”
“No, never.”  Realisation shot through John and his mouth fell open.  “Doyle has been leaving you roses to make you think they’re from me.”
“It is. I wasn’t sure if it was something you’d want after a scene.”
“Well hello there Ringmaster,” he said with a low whistle. “You’re going to destroy tonight’s group before you even have the chance to get to the performance. I see you still work out.”
John hummed and wrapped an arm around his shoulders.  He took the quiet moment to observe the rest of the room.  One wall was made up entirely of windows, giving them a view of one side of the hospital wing and a portion of the forest and hills surrounding the castle.  The fabric that currently hung at the corners of the bed waiting to be pulled closed for the evening were a somewhat gauzy black with a tiny design etched into it that was too small for John to make out properly.  When he reached out to pull it closer and inspect it, he let out a bark of laughter that jolted Sherlock from his position.  He lifted his head from John’s chest to glare down at him and John guided the fabric closer so he could look at it too.
“And I’ll not let her do to you what she did to the others!”  John paused to compose himself and grasped Sherlock’s arm tightly.  “Look, Teddy’s contacting Harry and the Aurors, they should be along right at the same time you’re off.  But I’m not risking you or Cecy getting hurt in whatever might happen.”  John’s grip tightened, impossible as Sherlock thought it could be.  “Please, Sherlock, I need to know the two of you are safe.  I can’t risk it, not again.”
“Happy Christmas,” he muttered as he bent down to kiss him, his hand busy toying with Sherlock’s now wet cockhead.  Sherlock groaned and twisted into the kiss, pushing down the duvet to give John more room.  Too impatient to bother letting Sherlock wake up enough to shift his pants fully off, John worked the top band down enough to fully expose his cock, leaving his balls trapped in the dark fabric.  He spread the wetness from the tip down to his base to help ease his way as he sped up, quickly bringing Sherlock off.  Sherlock gasped and blinked up at the ceiling after he came, running a shaking hand through his sleep mussed hair.
“Morning,” John grumbled, his voice gruff from sleep and arousal.  He settled both of his hands on Sherlock’s waist and suddenly pulled him up higher, thrusting his hips so their groins could meet.  Sherlock’s eyes clenched shut in concentration as he settled his elbows next to John’s head and measured his thrusts to follow John’s rhythm.  He gasped when their cocks aligned through their sleep trousers and he was forced to lower his head to rest it on John’s chest.
John began to look uncomfortable when the discussion turned to his parents, causing Sherlock to reach out and grasp his hand.  The action startled them both, but John recovered first.  He shot Sherlock a grateful smile and squeezed his hand back, keeping it open and available on the table.  Though the invitation was obvious, Sherlock soon pulled his own hand away to let it cower under the tabletop.
“I told you, because she is a part of her!” he screamed, making them all flinch.  A few rocks below the outcropping came loose and tumbled down the edge from the force of his voice.  He glanced down at Cecelia, terrified and clutching at his leg, and smiled once more.  “Her skills are outstanding, far beyond her years, just like Abigail.  You waste so much time teaching her as though she’s something
“Yes, that.”
John pays his parents a call.  Angst ensues.
“Didn’t that one bloke out in the woods say something about a Holmes getting involved in the case?  Maybe it’s something you need to bring up with Mycroft.  He’s only, what, a few years older than me, yeah?  And you said he went off to boarding school as a kid…”
Rather than wrapping his hands around his cock as John expected, Sherlock trailed a finger down from his belly button into the coarse hair of his groin. Almost instantly, the lube started to warm his skin, a pleasant tingling that made Sherlock’s light touch feel like small licks of fire. John undulated with a groan, trying fruitlessly to convince Sherlock to move lower. Sherlock acquiesced to an extent, dancing his fingers across John’s hips and down to the crease where thigh met groin. He drew circles into John’s inner thighs, spreading the lines of heat with purpose down towards his cheeks. Without warning, Sherlock grasped the lower parts of his arse firmly in both hands and pulled, effectively bringing John’s arse up into his lap.
Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered at the term of endearment, but he was nodding vigorously before John could even finish speaking.  “I must.  I have to at least try, if there’s the chance…I need this, John.  But you don’t have to – “
“This isn’t just because you caught me pleasuring myself and filming it for the internet?”
John approached Sherlock and wrapped his arms around his waist.  “All right?” he asked quietly once Sherlock met his eyes.
“John,” he muttered, his lips forming a pout.  John grinned up at him and leaned up enough to place a small kiss on his belly button.  Sherlock sighed, the sensation of his breath releasing pushing his lower belly into John’s lips.  While he trailed kisses across his stomach, John moved his hands out from below Sherlock’s pants and back up to their band.  Moving with calculated slowness, he pulled them forward enough to reveal the very tip of his cock, a tiny pearl of precome at the slit.  Unable to help himself, John paused to dart down and lap at it, letting Sherlock’s pants come to rest at the crown as he dove forward.  Sherlock huffed out a sharp pant and made to shift forward, one hand attempting to grasp and pull at his pants.
,” he breathed, clutching at the pillow under John’s head.  John chuckled breathlessly and sped up, leaning down to attempt to mouth at Sherlock’s jaw.  Sherlock shifted around to offer up the skin he sought and John licked across his neck, immediately blowing on it and admiring the goose bumps that followed.  Sherlock moaned and shifted his hips faster, seeking more friction.
“Yeah, I think it will…the only thing is, it’s in Scotland.”  John watched her face fall as she walked over to sit down opposite him.
Lestrade groaned as he got to his feet and pulled Molly up to hers.  He curled his arm around her waist once they were both upright in a comfortable motion borne of practice.
“That was absolutely brilliant,” John breathed, causing the man’s face to turn bright pink.  “Seriously, mental but brilliant.”
John sent him a half grin as he rose to his feet and snatched up his wand.  “I suppose it doesn’t matter much now that you know.  What would you like to see?”
He had no idea when he fell asleep, but when he blinked his eyes open the Muggle alarm clock on Harry’s desk was flashing half eight in the morning.  John stretched his neck to each side, attempting to work out the kinks caused by sleeping in an armchair all evening, and gave his shoulder a few careful rolls.  Despite his time out in the misty night and sleeping in the chair, it was surprisingly limber.  He felt around the back of the chair and pulled out a small, plainly patterned fabric bag.  It was a rich blue in colour and shifted easily in John’s fingers, small objects shifting around inside it that reminded him of rice.  He hefted the bag in his hand and felt the warmth of it settle pleasantly over his palm.
"I didn't meant Myc, Sherlock. He is not the one who is in the spy business," Mummy scrolled.
"What are you doing here freak?!" Sighting John broke a quarter from his scone and handed it to the pissed woman.
"Don't think I let you of about the dancing just because we got a case! We are still gonna talk about it!" Lestrade let his eyes wander between both off them.
"My brother, fooling anyone at all that he isn't head over heels for Doctor Watson. Really it couldn't be more obvious the way his is practically shining," Q huffed and 007 hummed.
"Of course not! Take your time and refresh yourself, I will see you at the dinner," mummy said ushering them up the stairs. Sherlock led the way to his experiment took place in the little garden house (a good 100 m away from the main house) so there was nothing for Amalia to hurt herself on. They arrived to the door at the end of the corridor, which Sherlock opened and stepped aside to let John enter first. The room had been cleaned since he had been here last. All the books that used to be in piles on the floor had been returned to their shelf’s, all papers that used to be spread on every flat surface had been sorted in folders marked with things like "south-east corner", "north wall", "desk", "under the bed" etc. The bed had been made with royal blue silk sheet and at the foot of it stood Em's old crib.
"You will have to be a bit more exact John" Sherlock replied. John felt like slamming his head in the table, of course he wasn't going to make it easy for him.
"Pardon?" After he regained some brain power he added.
That's it. This work will not be finished. I wrote myself into a major writing block and it killed this fic sorry :/
"My part time job" he explained stopping when there was about a meter between them.
The next time Sherlock surfaced from his research on the laptop it was pitch black outside. When he glanced over to John's armchair he saw that the man had fallen asleep. It didn't look terribly comfortable sleeping curled up like that. Maybe it was time for bed. He had found the boyfriend some time ago and dug up all he could on the guy. His second Facebook page (not the one he was friends with the victim on) was awful to put it mildly. Honestly who used the "share this video"-button on porn sites? There were also a lot of political posts which were very backwards and managed to piss the consulting detective of quite a bit. If John wanted to shoot this guy he wouldn't stop him. The other Facebook account was very civilised. It was mostly movie related posts on it. Oh well, it wasn't any use to go and investigate him now. It was probably hard to find him at, Sherlock threw an eye at the computers watch, 04.30. He rose up, stretched out his back and padded softly over to John's armchair. He reached out, placed his hand on the doctor's shoulder and shook him lightly.
Downstairs he heard the door open but didn't really pay it any mind. It was probably just Sherlock coming back from his case with Lestrade. He continued drifting enjoying the peace of Amalia's afternoon nap. However a quiet knock on the doorframe made him open his eyes and slowly sitting up still cradling Amalia to his chest with one hand under her butt and the other behind her head. He blinked the sleep out of his eyes and turned to the older lady standing in the doorway.
"No it isn't love. Please come down before you fall."
"You didn't look up and check then I left. You always do that, it started right then you moved in. You are a bit overprotective" Sherlock told him.
"Beatrice have cleaned it up a bit," Sherlock said gesturing to the folders that had been given their own shelf over the desk. John snorted as he begun to read the titles - it was a nice sound to hear. John hadn't laughed like that for a long time. This trip had been a good idea. John was already looking more relaxed - the sight of John rocking back in the chair with a small smile on his face made a warm feeling spread in Sherlock's chest which he refused to classify.
"Body parts are also organic substance, you use meat I fail to see the problem" Sherlock shout back.
"Really" they laughed
It really should be illegal for people with deep voices to do that John thought, luckily he was lying down so nobody would notice if he got a bit weak in the knees. Still he resisted the temptation and tried a new strategy. Instead of rolling forward as previously he threw his weight backward and twisted his body as he landed on top on Sherlock. He wasn't sure if it was a success or not. On one side he wasn't trapped on his side with Sherlock's long limbs wrapped around him but on the other side now he was lying on top of said man but still captured in his arm. Pros: he could see his face, cons: his brain activity stopped about here.
This is written on my bus-trip to and from school (one hours trip I get board) so it is either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Ops posted the wrong text first. Fixed now
"Oh I don't know some classic romantic movie" They chatted for a bit more but the landlady didn't have anything more of use to say so John excused himself and went upstairs to check on Sherlock.
"More like superior and agent. Remember that I told you my brother was a part of MI6, John?" Sherlock started explaining even if nobody asked him as usually.
"We have had the theme 'classical movies' this year and after voting Titanic got selected" John noted it down.
"....It is very tidy," John said slowly with a slightly stunned expression as he went over to the old rocking chair - there did that come from? Sherlock was positive that it hadn't been any rocking chair in the whole house - and sat down.
"Doctor John Watson?" 007 asked who apparently had been reading over Q:s shoulder, bloody spies.
"Oh" the frown between Sherlock’s eyebrow disappeared.
"I believe congratulations is in order."
~ Q ~
"I promise."
"I'm sorry I got carried away," John smiled and extended his hand.
"It is called burlesque. You really need to practice asking more precise question. But your tailing skill are not half bad, I almost didn't notice it." John got a warm feeling in his stomach at Sherlock's compliment. "Not half bad" was high praise in his book. Trying to act casual he just asked:
"Lucky for him then that Watson swing booth ways," he commented. Q shot him a wondering eye.
I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no experience at all with snogging so if I'm writing it wrong please tell me how it is done. My ask box on tumblr (mandy-hope-san) is always open or comment. The chapters are getting longer so all hail AlexBSChris for correcting them.
"You know that you don't have to hide your and John's relationship from me right?" she smiled.
Murder -> had taken place while the victim was asleep at the victim's flat (more exact the bedroom, the bed) sometimes around 2-3 am, body had been dressed up and appeared at the around 4-5 am, finish makeup applied there, murder weapon: unknown (needed to take a look at the body), murder motive: unknown, suspects: it wouldn't hurt to look in to the boyfriend - the murderer was most likely male.
"Banks? Isn't it just fields and cows there?" John asked really this kind of shit happened in the countryside. Sherlock visibly tensed up before rising up from his chair.
"Okay. What are you putting up this year?"
Q pressed send and cracked his fingers. Right there was work to be done if he would be able to take the weekend off and he needed to find out who this Mary really was. With a few taps he pulled up a picture of her on one screen and turned to the two double ohs which still was where.
"Beside given that John knows your agent he would have an idea of your work anyway.
"John. John it is time to go to bed." At first he just got a tried "murph" but after a second shake one deep blue eye opened and looked at him.
"She is not your grandchild mummy," he protested as he hung up his coat and scarf by the door.
Sherlock didn't get that, body parts were organic material and John did use meat and that was also body parts. The day to honour John had cooked. On the table there stood two plates with two buttered toasts covered in scrambled eggs (four eggs, salt, pepper and thyme - why thyme it wasn't standard) and a tomato salsa (tomato, red onion, basilica, salt and pepper). There was also a pot of streaming fresh tea.
"Exciting"
"That isn't important right now John! The work is." Sherlock had stopped his climbing to look down on his partners sullen look. John had dressed up nicely for today and suddenly he felt a bit sad for ruin it. But no the work was the important thing right now.
"Around 12."
"007 PUT YOUR SHIRT BACK ON!!!" John turned around to see the other man stare at them in a mix of horror, wonder and fascination.
John gather information, Sherlock is jealous. Dating Sherlock Holmes is weird.
"That is a crow nest. Crows collect shiny things."
"Yes you know about it?"
And there you have it. The worlds only consulting detective is afraid of cows.
“Q, what have I ever done to you to deserve this?” 007 said with an innocent voice who would have fooled almost anyone.
Here comes the chapter!!! Thank you for all nice comments I got it really motivates me to keep writing :) I'm sorry it took this long to post life and homework ganged up against me. A big thanks to AlexBSChris who is my amazing beta and partner-in-brainstorming.
"And it is in consideration of John that I need you to be quiet. He is taking a nap."
"Anyway you three have Sherlock's room, Beatrice has put up a crib for Amalia. It is close to the old servant staircase to the kitchen," she quickly changed the subject - mummy couldn't stand the tenseness that came with underlying grudge, she had always made them talk out their issues with each other as children.
"What was that?" he asked. Sherlock seamed to tens up for a moment before he took notice on John's easy tone and smile.
"Still don't explain why you are in a tree love." John could almost hear Sherlock think 'I'm surrounded by idiots', but you had to give some credit to the man he tried to be patient with John.
"Defiantly worth checking out him then and that movie convent."Sherlock comment.
I had so much fun writing this! Please love Kim, I love Kim. They are important. As usually thanks to AlexBSChris for betaing me and also thanks to Svartkrut for reading it throw. She is on tumblr and has bad influences on me. you will see.
“How come?” Q asked as he started setting up his laptop and other equipment he needed to safely remote access Q-branch (009 was on a sensitive mission in Namibia which also was the latest spotting point of Rebecca Frost so he wanted to check in on her).
"So what is your role in all this?"
"Exactly! Now you are catching on!"
"Be back in a moment" he said and after a micro moment of doubt he rose to his toes and placed a peek on Sherlock's lips. Then John was gone Sherlock picked up his violin and started to play a bit to calm his nerves. He played beautiful tunes that he knew John enjoyed. He played for about a quarter, the day spinning around in his head and slowly getting sorted, deleted or stored away. He heard John quietly entering the room but since he didn't make his presence known Sherlock kept playing until he finished the piece. He slowly put his violin back in the case before turning around. John was leaning against the door frame and once again the detective's breath hitched a bit, his doctor truly was attractive.
"In the laboratory in the garden house. Mummy banned them from the house due to fire safety or something like that," he said as he opened the wardrobe - clothes were sorted after colour and shade - and started to hang their clothes in.
"But it is rather a lot," John protested gesturing to all the baby bags and the two not so small suitcase containing their clothes (babies are messy, one had to change their clothes a lot).
"The baby already seem awake so I don't see the problem," Q fired back because that was the only way to handle Sherlock.
"Wonder if he would teach me the trick. It could be very useful handling all the agents," he continued.
"So you are saying that one of the shiny dinner knifes is the murder weapon?"
"Come on, up you go" Sherlock said and pulled the half asleep man on his feet. Leaning heavily on Sherlock John made his way to the bedroom, where he stripped out of trousers, jumper, shirt, socks and shoes, folding the clothes neatly, placing them on a chair before flopping down on the bed wearing only pants and a vest. Sherlock removed his own clothes and hung the suit up. Reaching bellow his pillow he pulled out the pyjamas from last night and put it on. Well dressed he lay down on the bed, cuddled up behind John and pulled the blanket over them both.
"Not particularly no."
"You could have woken me. I just took a nap while your mother visited," John said and then he remembered.
"Flattering, but no above me." For the first time since John found his boyfriend in the tree his eye left him and wandered higher.
"You need to eat more and you didn't say I couldn't put anything on it so I did" then he turned to fix is glare on the detective. "Did you put any experiment in the oven lately?" Sherlock went into the laboratory in his mindpalace and started to flip through the files, nothing about an oven in material.
"John, give me Amalia and go to bed that's an order. You are of no use to her if you run yourself to the ground." John resisted for all of five second before giving up Mummy Holmes really did know how to get her will through.
"WHAT?! She did what?! How long have I been asleep?" Sherlock schussed John hoping that his outburst hadn't woken Amalia. Thankfully the little girl just stirred a bit and took a firm grip of John's beige jumper.
"So you are saying that a crow stole the murder weapon?"
"How?! How did this happened?! I checked on them the last 9 months! It can't be possible!" he continued to mumble as he access the camera he had placed out scanning them to find out the truth.
"Uff, satisfy now." John grumble squeezed under Sherlock.
"I wish! Na he mostly hangs out with the girl from the workshop, they are the ones that build everything, Sofia Hjärtrudotir" John noted the name down.
“What they’ve done – “
“Good choice,” he remarked, gesturing up at the hat. John nodded his thanks and looked over the other accessories.
“No, she’s fine,” John muttered, staring down at his phone with a blank expression.  The glow of the screen had long since gone dark.  “Just…thinking.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock smiled, his face softening, and shifted his hand down from John’s face to his chest.  He toyed with one of the buttons on his shirt, looking up at John through his eyelashes.  “Get undressed and help me finish the bath?”
“You saw absolutely no signs of forced magical entry?” Sherlock shot out without looking up.  His eyes were tracing the outline of something on Yaxley’s forehead that John suspected was incredibly familiar.  “No sounds of distress or hints at a struggle?”
“Eight instead of seven?” John asked.  Sherlock nodded his agreement while turning off the Bunsen burner.  “Would you even be interested in going?  Like I said, it’s likely to be pretty mad.”
“It snowed!  It fucking
Sherlock smiled and glanced down at the bike, rubbing a thumb gently along the tank.  “She’s a Bonneville T120 Black.  I haven’t had her very long, but she rides quite well.”  He raised his eyes to stare across at John through his eyelashes.  “Are…you interested in riding her?  With me, I mean.”
“Guess that answers that,” John said with a sigh. From his limited knowledge, the handwriting looked similar to the handwritten note from the day before. “You said he – what makes you think that?”
rushed out on you in the middle of your date.”
Mycroft glanced at Sherlock and, when he received no acknowledgement from him, began.  “I’ve told Sherlock about the letters I sent you before Sherlock’s eleventh birthday.  We were hoping you might be able to clear up exactly why his letter never arrived.”
Sherlock’s expression remained doubtful, but he nodded.  John stepped to his side and Sherlock raised the wand once more, his posture remaining stiff.  Instantly John approached and began lowering his shoulders and wand arm, attempting to pull him into a more natural position.  Sherlock let him move him around without protest.  Once he was finished, John stepped back and waved him on in encouragement.  Sherlock’s eyes darted between John and the kettle before he took a breath and performed the spell.
Shrugging, Sherlock averted his eyes. “I had mine already. The same person who made it was available and made yours on rush demand for this evening. I had a particular aesthetic in mind after we found the pin.”
“I hate to do this to you, John, and really, I consider myself a man of fairly strong fortitude in the face of a challenge, but to be perfectly honest, I’m feeling particularly light headed at the moment and I hope you’ll forgive me if I pass out in a moment.  Right, sorry,
deduce,” Jones said with a wink.  “The fact that you’re so incredibly pretty certainly helped.  To add a bit of a personal touch, I used a certain James Moriarty as inspiration for my new persona.  I perfected Finley Doyle and once the particulars were all sorted and everything ordered itself exactly the way I wanted, I set to work on you.  Unfortunately my cockiness resulted in getting caught a bit earlier than I planned, but in the end everything else has gone exactly as I hoped.  That means, however, that Cecelia and I will be leaving as soon as possible.  Not to worry, I plan on doing everything in my power to make sure that she becomes everything her poor mother once was and more.”
John’s face fell and he rubbed his thumb on Sherlock’s thigh, more to comfort himself than Sherlock.  “Had.  Not everyone who fought in the Battle of Hogwarts made it out alive.”
Pulling out gradually, John pushed forward once more with a slowness that was the opposite of his first movement.  Sherlock’s hand followed from John’s arse up to the base of his spine, one remaining there while the other continued on to grip the hair at the back of John’s head.  John started to steadily increase his pace, each thrust coming slightly faster and with more force.  By the fourth thrust, he had shifted himself around enough to land his aim directly into his prostate.  Sherlock’s moan seemed to be continuous and his leg followed his hand to hitch his ankle up around John’s waist.
“I’m not sure.  I never took Ancient Runes, so I don’t really know much about this sort of thing.  Would it be in any of the books you picked up today?”
“No way.”  John shuffled closer to clap him on the shoulder.  “You were born a certain way and should have been valued for that.  You didn’t choose to be born a Squib any more than I chose to be born a wizard.  You should never feel badly for what you are or who you’ve become.”
He fished out a small coin, glaring down at it in annoyance.  Rubbing the back of his neck, he winced over at Sherlock apologetically.  “That’s my coin to let me know if there’s a problem back at the school.  I’m sorry, I’ll have to go back up there as soon as possible.”
Doyle shook his head at John, as though he found John’s questions adorable.  “Oh John, they aren’t wrong when they say you’re the slow one.  Hasn’t it ever occurred to you that I might have known her?”
John explained the crime scene from that afternoon in a clinical tone, attempting to cover his feelings over their discoveries with his straightforward analysis of the facts.  McGonagall listened without interruption, expression thoughtful.  Despite his best attempts otherwise, John felt his throat catch as he described the word etched into the victims’ foreheads, causing a concerned furrow to develop between Cecelia’s dusting of brown eyebrows.  She cooed up at him in worry, fingers grasping out at him in a bid for comfort.  John shot her a tentative grin and moved a hand to pass through her soft hair, bringing comfort to both and allowing him to continue.  The only sign he had that McGonagall was even listening came when he mentioned Sherlock following John into the Leaky Cauldron.
Her face brightened once more.  “That’s perfectly fine then, dear!  It sounds like the ideal opportunity for you.  Does that mean you’ll be teaching?”
“Kinda all over your bedroom floor?” Sherlock asked with a raised brow.  Cecelia stuck her tongue out at him and ran away, giggling her way up the stairs.  John watched with a grin and pulled Sherlock into him, his back flush with John’s front.

3. Please do not use the comments to send requests. This fic is already fully written and because of that, I do not plan on changing the contents due to requests left in the comments. This is mostly just a general courtesy thing - if the writer doesn't specifically ask for requests, ask them first before jumping right in. I'm much more likely to be supportive of it then.
Hey there, everyone.  Sorry this has been such a long time coming - first I was out for a few days with a nasty stomach bug, then Christmas while working in retail happened, so it's been a mad few weeks.  Hopefully things will start to calm down and I can update properly.  Anyway, I don't mind telling you that I'm not a super big fan of this chapter.  Usually I edit each chapter threeish times, once while I'm transferring it from hand written to typed and at least two times in more detail.  I think I went through this specific chapter a good five or six times, including sending it to a friend.  I'm pretty sure that I've done what I can with it, so let me know what you think.
"You wouldn’t,” Sherlock muttered, his voice low.  John could just make out the barely contained fury in his voice.  “Not even you would be that cruel, Mycroft.”
Sherlock sighed and hung his head.  “Should it take this long?  How many will I have to try before we find it?”
Its shape cinched just where the buttons stopped to create a natural curve and ended in double half diamonds that would rest along the top curves of his thighs when the jacket was closed.  Though it currently hung open and unbuttoned, John could easily imagine how fitted it would be to Sherlock’s shape once closed.  John cleared his throat and licked his lips, finally raising his eyes to Sherlock’s.
With a nod, Sherlock curled his fingers around John’s.  “Fine.  What did you wish to discuss?”
Sherlock reemerged from the bedroom, dressed all in sleek black, and finished settling his suit jacket around his shoulders.  He held his hands out to his sides, showing himself off for approval, when he realized John was watching him.  From the smug smirk at his lips, he was fully aware of how good he looked, but John was more than happy to indulge him a bit.  He whistled his appreciation and Sherlock rolled his eyes, but his cheeks turned a dusty pink at the compliment.
“Just say yes, you nutter.”
Shrugging, Sherlock set his mobile back down and laced his fingers together on his lap. “Not much, but I have done it before. I’ve always been the one tied up, so I would prefer to do the same this time.”
“Heaven forbid we have to ask your brother for help.”  The two shared a grin before immersing themselves in reading, falling almost silent for hours.  The only interruptions came when Cecelia needed looking after and a pair of house elves stopped up with a tray of food around noon.  Sherlock, naturally, was fascinated, but not in the treats they bore.
“Blood traitor,” Sherlock muttered as his eyes roved back up to the etching.  He turned to shoot a glance over at John.  “Mean anything specific to anyone, other than the obvious?”
“Where are we?” he asked, glancing around for a street marker.  None stood nearby, and the park itself appeared to have no obvious sign giving it a name.  John stared into the bleak trees as his feeling of unease grew.
John chuckled and nodded.  “Right then, no bikes.  Are you still a fan of that pig show?  Maybe you can ask for something from that?”
“No, you don’t apologise to me,” Greg interrupted, anger strong in his voice.  “You aren’t the one who ought to be apologising.  You’ve done absolutely nothing wrong and I can’t accept an apology for that, not from you.”
“I haven’t always been particularly good for John,” Sherlock started to explain.  He was interrupted by a voice calling down the hall, followed moments later by John appearing in the doorway.
"Currently ignoring the fact that you've used my wand without my permission," John sighed as he rubbed at his rough jaw. "Jesus, I am going to be in a shitton of trouble with the Ministry for all of this…hold still." He gave his wand a wave over Sherlock's front and muttered, "Protego." A light blue mist soon surrounded Sherlock, giving him an eerie, almost ghostly glow. John did a quick test to ensure it would do its job before turning back to face the cottage.
“Most likely something along the lines of what you just said,” Sherlock replied, a single finger dragging across the violin’s strings.  His eyes, currently a light blue in the sunlight filtering in from the window to his left, bore unblinking over his visitor’s face, watching carefully for her reactions.  She said nothing as he studied her, hardly moving as she studied him right back.  The faintest of smiles, hardly more than a soft crinkle at the edge of one side of her mouth, was the only sign that she had even heard him speak.  “Now then, what can I do for you, Doctor?”
“It’s not,” John interrupted fiercely.  “Jesus, it couldn’t be more wrong.  Moriarty’s dead, his whole network is, and that’s completely because of you.  You’ve defeated the virus, Sherlock.  It can’t come back.”
“What do you mean by odd?” John asked as he sat on the arm of his chair. “Were there problems with customers?”
Sherlock shook his head, his hair rubbing against John’s skin.  “I don’t know yet.  I don’t have enough information.  You’re right, something here isn’t right, but I just don’t have what I need to figure out what it is.”
IT'S BURROW TIME.  Just as an FYI, I am basing my timeline so that it works with Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, hence a couple of the things that go down in this chapter.  Also background mollstrade ahoy.
Sherlock’s forehead knit into thoughtful wrinkles and John could tell that, if not for Cecelia eating in his arms, he would stand up to pace.  “It isn’t that I don’t
“No, that’ll be fine. But where in the
Grinning back, John winked at him.  “I don’t mind waiting if the waiting’s for something good.”  Sherlock’s still pink cheeks turned even more red and John burst out into a full blown smile as he waved and returned to Jane’s side.
John could tell he still wasn’t certain, but he gave a brief nod and shut his eyes.  John couldn’t help his grin as he carefully closed the door behind him and headed out to get what he needed.
John grabbed the food and used his free hand to shake Stephen’s.  Violet circled the table and hugged them both at the same time, barely stifling a sniffle.
"Is this…" Sherlock began in a low voice that petered out. He spotted a small cottage in the distance, set back just before the beginning of a dense forest, that seemed to answer his question before he could fully ask it. John, however, answered anyway.
“She may not have wanted to be,” Sherlock mused.  He hadn’t realized how close they were to each other until John’s head thumped down on his shoulder, causing him to blink down in surprise.  He tentatively reached a hand up to stroke at the nape of John’s neck with his fingertips, the pads barely touching the fine hairs on his skin.  John shivered but melted into Sherlock’s shoulder, so he continued.  “There’s every possibility that she was forced to be involved.  It wouldn’t be the first time.”
“Me too.”  He looked down at Cecelia, who had returned to her perusal out the window.  “We both are.  It’s time for us to come back.”  The van started to slow and John turned to glance out his own window.  “In fact, we’ve just arrived.
Adjusting his hat and sticking the room key in his pocket, he made his way out to the meeting room. Sherlock was already there, speaking to Niall who couldn’t help but stare in shocked appreciation at Sherlock’s chosen outfit. When John approached, Niall gave him a once over as well and broke out into an enormous grin.
“You aren’t actually related.”  It was definitely a statement, but John answered it regardless.
“There’s the smartarse,” John chuckled, knocking his shoulder with Sherlock’s.  Sherlock replied simply with a smile and the rest of their brief journey was travelled in silence.  Once they passed the invisible barrier stopping them from Apparating, John wrapped a tight arm around Sherlock’s waist and they were gone.
Sherlock shrugged and returned his attention to his food.  “It takes quite a bit of courage to be out in such a small school with typically backwards views in most things.  The fact that they are in general very open about it here, going so far as holding hands like they have been all night, is something to be encouraged and applauded.”
Though most of the time John kept them safely hidden away in their bag, he took them out occasionally to wipe away any invisible dirt that may have collected, leaving them shining.  Cecelia lifted up the smaller of the two, rolling it in her tiny fingers before slipping it on her index.  It hung loosely rattling as she lifted it up to John in question.
James arrives to talk things over with Sherlock to make him understand his situation.  Together, Sherlock and Mycroft make a trip to Hogwarts to finally receive an answer.
John peered over the book’s edge.  “Right, and they’re the ones who are like crows, aren’t they, in their attraction to shiny objects?  I think I had a mate a Hogwarts who set one off in his dormitory and it created hell in there.”
“What makes this food any different than what we’ve been eating since we’ve arrived?”  Sherlock asked, lifting up a bite and studying it.  His confusion morphed into surprise as he ate, chewing the pasta thoughtfully.
“Does this mean we’re dating?” he asked, trying to hide his fear and failing. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist to pull him in even closer.
“Shut it, you,” he hissed, but the footsteps had already started to hurry towards them.  Whoever it was, they were coming from the opposition direction from where Sherlock’s face could see.  He silently hoped that it would be an older student or a professor; Doyle could easily threaten off a first or second year, leaving Sherlock to his fate.
John grinned against his skin and moved to nip lightly at his Adam’s apple.  At the breathless gasp he received in response, his grin widened.  “Nope, think that covered it.  But we technically haven’t had the chance to really make
Happy Halloween, have a Christmas themed chapter.  I know my updating schedule with this story has been awful, so as an apology, have a 100% fluffy chapter with random dashes of smut.  This is also my way of saying hey sorry this isn't gonna be updated again until at least December because NEXT MONTH IS NANO.  I'm gonna be doing original fiction this year for the first time since I started this series, so I am a combination of nervous and excited.  We'll be back to irregularly scheduled programming once November is done and maybe I can actually finish this so I can get on to the shorts and final story in the series before the end of this decade.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ *finger guns*
John’s head shot up, his mouth open in a perfect o of shock and offense.  He set aside his marker with the upmost care, turning in his chair to face Sherlock fully.  His hands sat folded in his lap as he stared up at Sherlock, practically emanating youthful seriousness.  “They are not nice, Sherlock Holmes.  They shouldn’t say mean things like that, ‘specially since it’s not true.
Instead of an answer, Sherlock shuffled over to the drawer beside the sink and began digging through it.  John suspected that he didn’t expect to find what he was looking for, but he admired his dedication towards attempting to keep his secret.  He gave up soon with a sigh, leaning forward over the open drawer with his hands on each side and his head hung between his shoulders.
Despite what they nearly got up to earlier in the day and their discussion about Sherlock’s concerns with his magic, he still made excuses about sharing the bed that night.  John had brought Cecelia back down with him when she disturbed them, settling her on Sherlock’s stomach for him to amuse her.  In the meantime, he dragged his bags into Sherlock’s room, managing to find space for all of his things between the dresser and closet.  The only comment he received from the bed was a declaration not to ruin his system, confirming finally that John’s clothes at least were welcome in the room.  But that evening, long after Cecelia had gone to bed, John made his way into the bedroom and Sherlock never joined him.  He hoped it meant that he’d simply become distracted with an experiment rather than anything more serious.
John rolled his eyes.  “Yeah, you would, you ridiculous nutter.  So what the hell’s this about then?”
“Are you alright?” he asked, ducking his face down close to John’s.  John furrowed his brow, but he nodded.
“I’ve got it,” Stephen said as he followed her to his feet with a groan.  He shot Sherlock and John a wink before heading into the sitting room.  John stood and moved close to Sherlock’s side, brushing his hand over the back of Sherlock’s briefly.  Sherlock turned into John so that they leaned chest to chest, linking hands with him fully.  He breathed out a sigh into the space between them and rested his forehead against John’s heavily as though he could no longer hold his head up on his own.  Tuning out the sounds of Violet behind them, John rubbed their foreheads together and pulled Sherlock closer.
John drove steadily down the familiar gravel roads, still covered in the same patterns of rocks and roots he remembered from his youth.  The town only had two cemeteries, having finally outgrown the plot in the east when John was in the military, and he had distinct memories of dares with his friends to enter the area at night, made eerie by the lack of street lamps and massive trees turned murderous by starlight and moon beam.  It was beside one of these enormous trees, an apple that had stopped properly flowering long before the plot was purchased, that his parents resided.
“Guilt is something I certainly have experience with,” James mumbled, his eyes never leaving Mycroft’s.  “Though the fact that you seem to have done so much to attempt to fix it is more than I’ve ever done in my situation.”
Hey guys! Lots of news coming with this chapter! First off, I have officially finished typing up the full rough draft of this story! Hopefully that will result in quicker updates, particularly since there are only THREE CHAPTERS LEFT! Gahhhhhh. I completely didn't realize how close we were to the end. However, I have good news - I plan on turning this into a series of stories, and already have the next two mapped out. FI's sequel is called Dissendium and will deal with some answers that are still going to be hanging about at the end of this, and after that will be Prior Incantato. I'm still trying to come up with a good name for the series overall, so if you have any thoughts feel free to give me a holler. Also, I'm not sure if the comment was here or over on ff.net, but this story has a Johnlock endgame. Hopefully the end of this chapter will help make that a bit more...obvious, but that's your warning. XD Nothing too graphic, obviously from the rating, but still. Anywho, this chapter's a long one (mostly because it didn't have a very good place to cut off), but there are a few cameos that hopefully you'll enjoy. Let me know what you think!
As they crossed over a small creek, John grabbed Sherlock’s elbow.  At first, Sherlock tried to yank himself away, but John tightened his grip and turned Sherlock around to face him.  Sherlock growled in protest but allowed John to hold his face and met his eyes.  “Babe, we need to go back.”
He rolled over to stare up at the ceiling.  “You don’t need to lurk in the doorway, John.  I believe you said you wanted to talk?”
“Good to see you both, gentlemen,” Harry said with a smile before they could burst into frantic denials of guilt.  “Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson here have been helping us with a case that just so happens to involve our two victims.  If you’d be so kind as to show us the bodies and tell us what happened?”
“Alright?” he asked, his voice gone deep.  Sherlock heaved in breaths, his jacket falling off one of his shoulders and his shirt half gaping open.  It should have looked ridiculous, but on Sherlock it simply increased John’s arousal.
They started through the crowd, attached by the hand and with John leading the way.  “Why don’t we just buy an owl for the flat instead?  Surely that’s easier than having to contact the wizarding post whenever we need to send something by owl.”
“Hidden among the various other repetitive books on wizarding families you brought over before I arrived.  What is it, John?  Tell me what you’re thinking.”
“I am familiar with obelisks, John, and if this is one, it is a failure as a piece of artwork.  There are three people, a man, woman, and child.  I’m assuming this is a young Harry with his parents, from what you’ve said.”
“It’s not that I don’t
“Mycroft has done things that I thought were awful before, but this…”  Sherlock’s voice, when it finally came from the area of John’s shoulder, was muffled by the fabric he nearly had stuffed into his mouth.  “It’s too much.  John, I – “
Sherlock shrugged, but didn’t meet John’s eyes when he tried to look at him. “I’ll manage. I’m sure we could find someone from the Met who’s willing, particularly if Lestrade helps. We’ll simply have to set up parameters as to what is acceptable and hope they don’t get caught up in the heat of the moment.”
With a sly grin, John crawled into the bed from the bottom, climbing under the golden duvet and tucking it back in to keep the warmth inside.  In the darkness of both the half morning light and the lowered duvet, he could only feel around for Sherlock’s legs to find his way.  Sherlock shivered when John’s fingers followed the opposite direction of the hair on his legs as he made his way up to his thighs.  His breathing still felt deep and steady when John snuck his hand up to rest against Sherlock’s chest.  While his body continued its journey up towards Sherlock’s head, John left one of his hands resting just to the side of Sherlock’s half interested cock.
Sherlock’s grumbled protests followed behind John as he threw himself into Sherlock’s chair to watch.  Down on his hands and knees, his pants still nestled snugly below his now flaccid cock, John studied him and contemplated how else he could wreck him before the evening came.
“More than you’d probably want to know, unfortunately.”
tell me though, right? I can’t do this unless I know you’re completely comfortable and honest with me.”
Before Sherlock could reply, a voice interrupted them, causing them both to turn.  “John?  John Watson?”
For a long moment, they lay tangled together trying to catch their breaths, sweat drying on their skin and thoughts buzzing from sensation. John’s cock slid free of its own accord and Sherlock groaned quietly at the loss. Rubbing his messy stomach, John kissed whatever bit of Sherlock he could reach before carefully rolling off him. He only moved enough to bring their faces up to the same level, and they both moved to their sides to face each other.
“Hey, none of that.  You’re doing the best you can by letting the Aurors just do their job.
From the stove, John added, “Her mother certainly wouldn’t.”  Downstairs, the doorbell buzzed and they heard Mrs. Hudson talking to whoever was outside.  Cecelia ran to the main door to look before rushing back to the kitchen.
Snape attempted to conceal his pleasure at Sherlock’s words, but the tiny, smug smile at the corner of his mouth gave him away.  “It is a delicate art mastered by the few and respected by the fewer.  It is hardly ever given the due it rightfully deserves.”
“Not to worry, John, you don’t have to concern yourself with my blushing virginity,” Sherlock cut in, rolling his eyes. “Contrary to Mycroft’s belief, I do have some experience, small though it may be. Just because I don’t have as strong of an interest now doesn’t mean I didn’t in the past.”
“You must be Sherlock,” she said.  “I’m Hermione, Ron’s wife.  We’ve all been thrilled to meet you ever since Harry told us about you.”
John allowed the slightly lit tip of his wand to guide them forward, their legs rustling through the too high grass. When he stiffened at the foot of the broken steps, Sherlock snaked out an arm to rest a warm hand at the small of his back. John melted slightly into the motion, causing Sherlock to feel the muscles beneath his hand loosen their tension. John gave him a slight nod of thanks and they clamoured over the stairs to shove the partially falling door open.
They silently came to a decision together, John reaching up to rub the sensitive tip of Sherlock’s cock just as Sherlock pulled the dildo almost free and shoved it harshly back into him. They gasped simultaneously into each other’s mouths, John’s head thrown back while Sherlock towered over him. Setting up a bruising pace, they nearly battled each other to see who would come first, both competitively trying to outlast the other. Sherlock had the advantage, however, and managed to knock John onto his back and push his hand away. John didn’t entirely mind, since the movement brought the dildo deeper into him, and all thoughts of anything other than coming fell away the moment Sherlock’s free hand wrapped around him. It only took a half dozen tight pulls before John was coming between them, coating both his and Sherlock’s fronts.
“Oye, there you are!”  John sat in another cozy-looking armchair, this one situated near a table under a window.  Cecelia was strapped in her wrap across his chest, attempting to snatch at the pages John managed to keep just out of reach.  Her head spun around as Sherlock approached and she let out a series of unintelligible babbles.
The certainty that is us two.
Having successfully gotten Sherlock back to Baker Street, he now has to face the consequences of his actions.
With renewed vigour, they set off once more.  Both of them lost themselves in the search, all of their focus going into finding the next petal and staring ahead into near darkness for any signs of movement.  John sensed that they were being led in circles, his training from years ago sharpening in a familiar situation and bringing into stark contrast the similarities of their surroundings.  He doubted that they were missing petals on their first pass through, however; if it was just him searching, he might consider it, but with both of their concentrations focused in on the search, the chances of them missing anything was slim.  The only logical explanation, then, became Doyle toying with them, always slightly ahead in the hopes of leading them on just a little bit further.
"Lunch?" John ask and Sherlock was about to answer with his ordinary rant of food slowing him down but then remembered the food he had that morning -the food John had cooked, it had been tasty.
"That would be the scones" he smiled, rising up and moving towards the oven. When he passed Sherlock he brushed his hand through the detective's hair. Said man leaned into the touch which made the other man chuckle a bit.
"I need to see better," John said and James obediently took of his jacket. Through the tight shirt John could see how the muscular work and it seemed to be some pretty messy scar-tissue. John wanted to take a closer look at it so he waved his hand at the skirt and in silent understanding James removed the shirt, they had been through this so many times before. It really was some messy scar-tissue and John was just about to ask how long the bullet had been in this time when a sharp voice cut through the silence, disturbing his examination.
"No way, mates! I saw him first!" John didn't seem to mind that everyone thought they were a couple. Normally he would glare and declare that he wasn't gay. His reaction gave Sherlock hope, maybe it wasn't so impossible as he thought to act on the warm feeling in his stomach. Would John.... Once again his thought was cut short by the catcalls, this time aimed at John. That he wouldn't tolerate he thought with a snarl.
"Texted him 10 minutes ago. What did the landlady say?"
Told you you would get another chapter soon. But don't get spoiled it was half written then I posted last time. Big thanks to my amazing AlexBSChris who was lighting fast on correcting this one. Next chapter is going to take awhile since I need to do some research. Enjoy this and please comment what you think. Writers live on feedback and comments.
John Watson was sitting in a cab munching on a scone on his way to another crime scene. As they had left the flat John had wrapped up the fresh scones in a tea towel and brought them with him, no need to waste perfectly fine scones. Sherlock was sitting beside him scrolling through the information on his phone and stealing small bits of John's scone.
“Felt a bit threatened?” Q teased. (This was good news it seemed the doctor truly had nerves of steel and didn’t mind a male partner. There was hope to end this pathetic pinning on his brothers half).
If you think Sherlock wouldn't notices John you were wrong.
"I didn't know that you sung," he said then he had his angel in his arms.
"Right be just a moment," John said heaving himself of the bed and grabbing a pair of clean pants on his way to the bathroom that was attached to Sherlock's room.
"No John it isn't a bother...." Sherlock trailed of looking a bit unsure.
"You don't observe again. Tell me what is the murder weapon?"
"Sure!"
"For female lead we got Vanessa Miricho, she looks amazingly close to the original Rose but got the role on talent, and for male lead we got Rafael Johannesson, which is a bit funny since the role he did the audition for was Rose. Apparently that role was that got him into acting as a child. But the old backwards picker wouldn't have a BOY for female lead so he got the male one instead since he is such a good actor" Interesting wonder what Sherlock was going to say about that.
"No she didn't know much, didn't like him either."
"Yes really it was begging for it. Also it is bloody unfair that you have a coat right now" Sherlock just smirked at the hint of which state he had put John in, but still felt the loss as the man pulled away to fix his clothes a bit. It didn't help a lot it was still pretty clear what they had been up to. The cab came to a stop and Sherlock leaped out but made a point to wait for John and hold the door for him. As soon as the doctor was outside Sherlock slipped his arm around him again (it had quickly become his favourite walking way) and they walked together into 221 B and up the stairs. This time it wasn't so awkward since they were a bit more familiar with each other's bodies now. Inside the flat they took their coats and jackets of.
"He always introduces himself like that," Q continue.
John slowly blinked awake from his nap. His body and mind still felt heavy with sleep. He snuggled deeper under the blanket, eyes drifting shut again, trying to figure out what had woken him. He couldn't hear Amalia crying so that wasn't it but there were something else, some other sound. Singing. It was singing he heard. The singer had a very nice voice and even if John didn't recognise the song it was soothing. It had the rhythm of a nursery rhythm but it wasn't in a language he spoke. Slowly John became more and more aware of his surrounding and recognised the voice. Sherlock, Sherlock was singing.
Aside from the lacking in leg space the train ride had been great. He and John had had time to talk about what he would be allowed to do. John had been so stubborn in the beginning wanting to do everything by himself, even if it was wearing on him. Why couldn't he see that Sherlock just wanted to help him and accept it? But it had worked out, Sherlock was now permitted to change the diaper, bath, feed and rock Amalia even if it was the middle of the night - of course he was going to more than that as well. He was going to do his share and more of chores and shopping, anything to make it easier for John. The doctor had a little girl to raise after all and she deserved the best childhood possible.
John is surprised. (and I suck at summaries)
"See right there you touched the place where I hit you. If I didn't know what had happened I would suspect abuse, it is common that victims react to certain key words or sentences. You are human so I can read you." Sherlock blinked slowly twice.
"John getyour laptop we need to find the boyfriend."
"Uh uh and that's why he went directly into your bedroom then I ordered him to take a nap," she said giving him that look "l-know-it-all"-look all mothers seemed to prefect.
So what did you think? What was good? What was bad? Let me know in the comments.
"Before..." the detective took a deep breath. They didn't really talk about his death it was still a sore subject.
"It doesn't matter. You needed the rest," he said.
"First I spook to the green haired kid you saw, Kim, and he told me that the play they are putting up is Titanic. Our victim was going to play the female lead. The male lead is called Rafael Johannesson and he actually wanted to have the female lead but didn't get it. According to Kim it was a gender issue."
"Why is one of your agents even here?" Sherlock asked quickly tried to change the subject - how John made people obey him was a John thing and it would be very disturbing if that technique was passed on, especially to his brother-.
"Neither of my brothers have been in a relationship that could result in a baby or looked into adoption the last 9 months. It is not possible!"
"Hmm" It was almost adorable how much it affected him.
John woke groggily, for the second time, from his nap this time from a gentle nudging on his shoulder and the sound of his daughters yodelling. The doctor blinked his eyes trying to get rid of the fog in his brain. When his sight focused he saw Sherlock sitting on the edge of the bed holding his daughter their shirt respective dress in matching purple. Amalia seemed happy waving her toy around so the bell jingled. Wait purple dress? He could have sworn she wore the blue one a couple of hours ago...
"I promised John never to leave out information concerning our lives again," Sherlock said and before anyone could accuse him of for, God forbid, feelings continued.
“Sure, got both the lads and the lassies, even managed to pull some of those American lads despite their hard drilled ‘don’t ask don’t tell’ culture.”
"What do you see in the tree?"
"Sorry I have to ask. Do you prefer he, she or maybe they?"
"Yes?"
“I’m sorry Father my work simply doesn’t leave enough time to give them the care they need,” Q said, the filthy liar. Even if it was true that he spent a lot of time at work, he managed to invent a machine who fed and watered his three cats he could easily fix something who watered the trice damned plant. Father Holmes turned his eyes hopefully at Sherlock.
"I'm home!" he yelled (announcing yourself was another important thing you learned by being a Holmes unless you wanted to fall victim for a rough experiment). To his big surprise it was Sherlock who showed up first caring a small blond girl on his left arm her dark blue dress matching her eyes.
"So what do you think?" he asked after travelling in silence for a while.
"Yeah right okay I will just go then," John mumbled and already half asleep he shuffled across the living room, through the corridor past the bathroom and into the bedroom. As soon as he reached the bed he threw himself on it not even bothering to remove his clothes and fell asleep.
When John Watson got thrown of the rack he cooked. It was a habit that remained from his not so lovely childhood; it had stuck with him threw university, survived the military and now helped him calm down then something happened with Sherlock. There were many nights when he had knocked on Greg's door demanding to use his kitchen since his own was out of question. As much as Greg mocked him about it he didn't complain. He got a tasty home cooked meal, a calm John and no dead Sherlock out of it, so he washed his own hands and helped out. But this time John didn't storm of to Greg. Their kitchen was clean enough so he was making one hell of a breakfast trying to work out what to say to Sherlock. As easily they had slipped in to some kind of lover’s rhythm he knew that relationship where you didn't know where the other person stood was bound to fail. And he didn't want to have to move out because it went down the bad road or he got his heart broken by a certain Mr Holmes. After putting the scones in the oven he sat down and took a bite out of his toast. A pleased groan left his mouth, yes this tasted as good as when he did it in Uni to calm himself before an important exam.
"It seems like I have now got a niece," he said slowly staring at the screen and the offending email from his mother.
“See what hopeless sons I have! What about you, young man? Would you like a rose?” The rest of the tension in the room disappeared with Bonds attempt to politely refuse the rose and the rest of the dinner was spent in pleasant conversation about gardening of all things. Sherlock cared little for the subject but since it kept John happy and smiling he threw himself into an explanation of various kinds of bees and their effects on different gardens.
The night had been full of surprises for Sherlock, but he still got thrown off the rack then John offered him his arm. Deciding that mockery would be the best response he had offered his own arm. He DID NOT expect John to take it. Not showing his shock he started to walk out of the ally. Thanks God for the etiquette lessons Mummy had forced on him that allowed him to keep his face. Then the shock faded he started to memorising things. He really, really liked having John in his arm. They easily fell into each other's steps, his about 3,42 cm shorter than his usually long strides. He set a low tempo not wanting this to end too soon. John's arm was a warm weight where it was linked with his. Why haven't they done this earlier? It was heavenly. Would John object if he proposed it on another time or was it a onetime only thing? His thoughts were cut short when they rounded the corner and hit Main Street. It was then the catcalls began. Most of them were aimed at him. Sure he had been catcalled before, he was a popular dancer, but it seemed like him touching another human and being off stage suddenly made him more available. His John reacted well on the inappropriate proposals by yelling at them. He simply yelled back.
"Sometimes things happened that you don't know about Q," 007 tried to sooth him.
"What about them?"
"Let's leave the determination of death to Molly shall we?" he said putting his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. Said man seemed to see John's point and did a final sweep of the room.
"A bird nest"
"Pleasure my arse. You only come to me when you have done something illegal and gotten hurt again" John fired back.
"Oh good you are all here," she smiled her sharp eyes scanning over the group.
Not a second later he had a response.
"Sorry Mummy. Trevelyan and Bond was present when I received your email and my reaction caused them some alarm," Q said.
"This is the crime scene" he stated as a dirty blond head looked into the bathroom.
"The dinner is served if you would follow me," and with those words she turned around and exited through the door she arrived from without looking back to make sure they followed. Smiling John shifted his grip on Amalia and followed. Really the family resemblance was obvious in both brothers and their mother.
"Good afternoon Em, would you please be a bit quieter?" (Yup his brother still was his stroppy self, good it couldn't be too bad then.)
"Damn Will, you was something extra tonight. Was your boyfriend here or something?" It was Jolene that spoke. She had been his mentor then he first stared at the club, middle age, pansexual, happily married with her wife of 8 years, had one cat. Sherlock couldn't stop the blush that spread to his face.
"Not your granddaughter," Sherlock tried to protest but was pointy ignored.
"Do you think he could have pulled it off?"
"But that was not what I was referring to. I meant what were you doing?" This made Sherlock frown.
"Once again you missed what I was asking. What kind of dance was it? I have never seen anything like it"
