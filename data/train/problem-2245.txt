John wasn't surprised when Clark went up to the stand; Harvey would have looked like she was intimidating someone's grandmother.  "Hello, Mrs. Henderson," said Clark.
"We'll be there in an hour," John promised, and hung up.  Sherlock looked up from the folder to him.  "That was Dr. Arthur.  He's at Bart's right now and said if we get there soon he can speak to us."
It was a... morgue.  Just a morgue.  He had been expecting something far more sinister, and let out an audible sigh of relief.  John had disappeared from sight, but Martin heard his voice call "Molly?  Where are you?"
"Fairly well.  Like I said, I give them my number when they move in, and when I started to manage it I put a packet of information in with their mail slots."
"Yes," said Lestrade with a sigh.  "And since I doubt at this point I'll convince you to let go of the case, I should inform you that you feature in Dr. Martin's current defense."
“Let me show you!”  He pulled out a rather battered looking mobile and spent a few minutes scrolling through pictures.  “No, that’s Herc with the cows at the ice cream place.  No, that’s Skip and Douglas.  Oh, here they are!”  He turned the phone to face Sherlock and showed him a picture of a dog jumping over a hurdle.  Then he proceeded to show him a series of pictures – in one, a dog weaved through a set of poles, one had a dog in a small tunnel, one had the dog climbing a v-shaped frame, and one even had a dog on a see-saw.
"I see." He crossed his arms over his chest. As he leaned backward in the chair, Mr. Aherne poked his head in the room.
"No. Once the two of them come out we can go back in and listen to the interview." He leaned against the wall, apparently content to wait.
They went several floors up and she unlocked one of the doors near the lift.  John went into what looked like a typical small office suite – waiting room with chairs and one door leading deeper inside.  She knocked and after a moment Mycroft emerged.  He gestured for John to follow him.
Once he got up there, he gave himself a minute before pulling out his mobile and ringing the number Sherlock had texted him.  "Mr. Rodgers?  This is John Watson," he said as soon as someone picked up.
The stilted formality of the question made alarm bells go off in John's head, but he couldn't figure out why.  "Angelo's is fine," he hastily replied before leaving the room.
"Sad," said Mr. Aherne, a frown on his face.  "Moira is shy but she's usually quite content.  Around May she started having crying spells.  Just crying uncontrollably for a few minutes every day.  Nothing I said could make her stop.  She still wouldn't tell me what was wrong.  I keep telling myself now that I should have done something more, should have asked her more.  I did ask if she wanted to talk to a doctor, but she screamed hysterically when I mentioned it."
"I spoke with him before you came down.  He says we should come down around two."  Sherlock didn't look like he had slept at all.  His eyes were bloodshot with dark circles under them.  In some ways it looked like he had aged overnight, but the rumpled clothes and the blanket made him look oddly childlike.  For lack of a better word, he looked despairing.  John wondered if he had made things better or worse with his questions the day before.
“Yes. It turned out their fourth child was born with serious disabilities, and they moved in order to be closer to a care network.  I later discovered that Mr. E was simply an introverted soul, and preferred to stay at home with his family and his bees, and his wife was more the sort who thrived on contact with others.”  His face seemed full of lines and for the first time John had a sense of how much of a burden this had been to Mycroft over the years.
Sherlock didn’t think there was a Jomeo in the phonetic alphabet either, but he decided not to question it.  “What do you want to build out here?”
"There's a room upstairs with your - I mean Martin's - name on it. Go there until I figure out what to do with you." From the tone of his voice, Sherlock knew better than to pick a fight. Instead he nodded and headed up the stairs.
“It was.  He.  No.”  The idea that Sherlock Holmes was unable to put his thoughts into words was the most frightening thing about the situation.  “He didn't do anything.  We just talked.”
Sherlock, if he had been by himself, would have probably just barged into the room without knocking. Luckily, since John was there, he got to the door seconds before him and pointedly knocked twice. "Come in," he heard Mr. Aherne say. He opened the door and he and Sherlock stepped in. The room seemed a great deal cheerier today – partially due to the smell of fish and chips that still lingered from what John assumed had been the meal Mr. Aherne had brought in, and partially because Mr. Aherne himself was sitting in a chair by his daughter's bedside, reading a book to his children. Dierdre and Kieran were sitting in the two remaining chairs.
“That makes our job a lot easier,” said the other officer.  The two of them headed down the walkway themselves, and even from that distance K looked genuinely surprised.  The first officer said with no buildup, “Dr. Martin, I'm arresting you for fraud by obtaining lodgings and bank accounts with fraudulent identification.  You do not have to say anything...”
"I know that you must have a lot of feelings for that person. You might even love them. That doesn't make it any less of a crime." Phillip didn't respond, but he gave a muffled half-sob. "I understand how you feel."
"In Ireland I ran my own catering business out of my home.  The money wasn't bad but it involved a lot of work.  Since my wife had died a few years back this meant my children weren't given as much attention as I would have liked.  A larger, London-based catering program offered me a job.  The pay was good and a friend of mine in London had a flat to offer me.  He is a landlord and usually lives on the ground floor of the building with his family, but his wife needed to travel abroad for two years.  I'm renting it from him at a low rate while another friend manages the building.  We'd never been able to afford a three bedroom flat otherwise.  Now I have more time to spend with my children and we can buy a house outside of London when he returns."
"I dreamed about Her," he said in the same flat tone.  "I thought about Her when I..."  He didn't need to finish the sentence; from the context John found it easy to conclude what "I dreamed about Her" meant as well.
“The week I brought Jennifer to the A&E I had only had her for a day and a half.   It had been a hard week anyway. Debra and I had argued over the drugs again.  Like with her mother's depression, I think there were signs I was missing there, but I didn't put them together.  I was about to put her down for a nap and as she got into bed she said something I didn't catch.  I asked her, 'What did you say?' and she said it again.  This time I heard it.”  His voice broke, but he did not tear up.
"Do you know what Dr. Martin said to your mother?"  In contrast, Harvey's constant use of K's formal title called up the very image of respectability.
"Obviously not so no one can ever see it, but there may be some specific function that needs to be performed to access the data.  There was a case where a website only gave hidden content when a specific access sequence was followed..." Sherlock abruptly stopped, blinked, swallowed, and then went on.  "He may have not remembered to share that with his daughter.  Or he deliberately kept it from her so she could be shielded by never knowing what was on it."
"At best Sherlock it means we would be displayed like dolphins, at worse, and the far likely scenario, we would be experimented on and cut open"
Sherlock shook his head with a pained but determined expression.  "I'm not leaving without talking to you first John! Take the pod Mycroft and I'll catch up with you, John can easily hide me-"
"I'd rather not talk about it just now please My. We have so much catching up to do...I'm afraid I can't offer much in the way of hospitality, so accustomed to being on my own as I am..." Sherlock couldn't help but throw out the some what bitter jab.
"I was your first? you mean...? Mycroft really will kill me" John groaned as his brain finally came back online.
John's fingers gripped convulsively as if he were handling a stress ball, before relaxing and releasing as he felt Sherlock tense. "I'm sorry" he said as he stepped back, reluctantly letting his flat mate go.
I really am sorry and I love you all for the comments, kudos etc-this has been my most successful fic for some reason lol, so the end is a Christmas present for you all xoxo
Sherlock was deep under water but his hearing was keener there then on the surface, where he now raced to reach to see his John: He was back! He hadn't left him too!
Hope readers enjoy the ending, it gets a bit fluffy lol, but I tried to keep the subtle humour that the first two parts had.
"No one looks like you, that's the problem" John muttered before his brain caught up with his ears. "Wait. What?!"
"I thought you might be. You have a kind face, reliable hands" the stranger took John's small but strong hands in his own cold elegant ones and placed them on his hips.
John smiled fondly and time hung momentarily suspended as they gazed into each others eyes, contact only breaking when John glanced at Sherlock's mouth.
One of his rugby pals suggested shots and of course none of them would say no, at least not before someone else did. Before long John was drunk. Not 'falling down' drunk or 'can't get it up' drunk, but his head was certainly swimming a little and he may have been giggling a bit more than usual.
He steered his small boat carefully round a tiny island and laughed to himself at the thought of what his army mates would make of him acting like a salty sea dog.
The jolly sailor bold as always comes from pirates of the Caribbean 4 on stranger tides, other song from album deep dead blue by aruna?-will check and edit lol.
John sighed "I can't just let you go to start killing innocent people Sherlock!" John held up a hand to stop Sherlock interjecting. "I know it isn't your fault but there has to be another way! Can't you just take a bit from more than one person?"
Sherlock's speech isn't great because he's been on his own so long he's rusty when it comes to proper English.
So he did the only thing he could think of; he put it in his giant old claw footed tub and examined it.
John gasped at the shock of the cold water but managed to stay afloat. He was a reasonable swimmer but the temperature would be deadly. He quickly swam away from the thrashing tails and churned water that the fighting mers created.
"So do you mind telling me what happened that day? I generally like to know why people detest me..." John asked softly.
Sherlock closed her eyelids 'Poor girl. Pretty girl. I did not hurt her, and I can't make storms' With that he dived gracefully and swam away.
The mer looked quizzical. 'Never mind I'm just thinking out loud. I'll get you some fish, I'm guessing raw is fine'
John Watson grinned happily as his small group of mates ordered another round. He was smiling at his friends, a couple of whom were leaving for Afghanistan with him tomorrow, he was smiling at the excitement and risk that lay seductively before him, and he was smiling at the tacky bar. Yes even the bar. The only thing missing from his happiness was the worry of his sister doing something crazy when he wasn't around to prevent it.
'Yeah I think I'll be off too' John agreed, grabbing his cane before hoisting himself out of his snug booth
John gasped when he opened the door and the hot air hit him, it was like walking into an oven, and the sight of Sherlock's naked back to him made him gasp even louder. A shirtless Sherlock, John discovered, really gave him a sense of deja vu. Perfect curls turned into slightly fluffy frizz as they lay damply at the nape of his long neck, seemingly endless lean pale torso giving way to the surprising curves of an arse that John wanted, no needed, to squeeze. And where the fuck did that thought come from?!
"Mike Stanford; we were at Bart's together" he continued, brushing off John's apologies for not recognising him.
The mers laughter turned to bubbles as he ducked under water to grab the escaped fish which he then threw into John's boat.
John forced himself to smile "Not a problem. Coffee sounds good, we can catch up. Say Mike how do you feel about fishing?"
"By all means take Victoria with you, she'd like to watch. She's more wild then she wants you to know, no that's not it-she's waiting until she knows you better before she tells you"
"If you're sure? I could sell it and buy a better boat, get a cuddy with a bearth then I could stay out all day with you..." John held his breath after realising what he had said. Perhaps the mer wouldn't want that? He needn't have worried.
He heaved a huge sigh as he considered the best place to hunt. He was hungry and tired and the fish hook embedded deep in his tail from the last time he got to close to humans ached. Though it was small it hurt, and being near to his caudal fin it made swimming a bother.
John sighed, there was no way he was getting any sleep tonight. Pulling on a snug pair of headphones and selecting shuffle on his music player, he ambled to the kitchen and made a strong pot of coffee.
"Mycroft no! He's a friend, don't hurt him! John are you alright?" Sherlock hovered over John, wanting to touch him but feeling that it wouldn't be welcome.
The merman stirred and John quickly stepped back not knowing how this would play out but enjoying the old feeling of an adrenaline surge that he haven't felt since the army
"I'm not saying I believe the human, but we should keep moving Sherlock, far safer that way" Mycroft murmured.
"You would go with this human Sherlock? You trust this man enough to leave your pod? Your place is by our side!" Mycroft thundered.
"I can handle him" Sherlock whispered suddenly in front of John "You should worry about handling me. Still curious doctor?"
"That's the third time you've casually lowered your paper to look at me. If being stuck here without a case brings out your homosexual leanings then go to the Diogenes and ask for the full treatment. I'll put a call in to Mycroft and tell him to find someone who looks like me" Sherlock smirked.
John tried to control his blush as he imagined Sherlock mating. "My people give gifts when we like someone, when we care about them...we even have gift giving holidays"
Yourself Sherlock thought as he shrugged for John's benefit. 'Fish away then, leave some for the rest of us' he flopped onto an inlet and watched.
'I swear I haven't said anything to anyone,and I'm not following you as such; I come here to fish because it's quiet' (and I know you'll be here) John mentally added.
"Please, you didn't make me! I appreciated the money. You should know the price has gone up now,inflation and everything"
John came back with a couple of trout he had bought from the market with the sole purpose of putting a picture on his blog and pretending he had caught them himself.
'It was you' John marvelled 'It's really nice, it makes me feel nice' He stared at Sherlock: though he could see he was younger than John's 15 years he was very pretty, with porcelain skin and eyes all the colors of the sea. He bit his lip as he worried and Sherlock's eyes flicked down.
“Several reasons.  One, he also had three children, and two of them were close in age to Sherlock.  Two, his family lived nearby and I knew Sherlock had visited him.  Three, he and his wife were beekeepers, and you know that Sherlock has a long-standing interest in bees.  Four, he was a great fan of classical music.  And finally, he never traveled for his business.  His wife handled the selling of honey and other bee products, the buying of what they needed for the bees, and any other reason they needed to do business out of town.  He stayed home with his children.”
The answer dawned on him.  “You mean the flash drive?  But that won’t help at all.  It’s got to be months if not years old, and they wouldn’t be stupid enough to re-use a pad, right?”
"She is an adult.  You are a child," Sherlock firmly replied.  His hand hadn't left Phillip's shoulder.
"Both," he curtly responded. "Take away your assumptions and there are more places to work with and look in." After that apparent non-sequitur, he walked back towards the counter and started working just like he had before, like there had been no significant conversation in between. If this was a preview of things to come, John was not looking forward to tomorrow. But the die had been cast; there was nothing to do but wait. And perhaps that strange fury Sherlock had shown before would make this somehow work.
When the plane landed, the man next to him used the same "larangytis" excuse that he had used before, and it was clear the man on the other end had a hard time believing that, but didn't ask any questions.
.  Suddenly very glad he hadn't put a hand on him, he started to move closer to the bed and his foot met a ball of fluff.  He reached down and picked up Hamish from the floor.  Hoping it would work, he dropped the stuffed toy in Sherlock's lap.
Well, that certainly didn't help matters.  "All of this isn't particularly specific.  Can you at least think of one specific thing to ask?"
"Yes, I do. When I was your age I knew a person like that, right in my neighborhood. I didn't always like whatever they did, but I still loved them a great deal." Lestrade didn't say anything to this, but his eyes widened. Sherlock wasn't looking at him, so John felt safe enough giving a quick nod and making a gesture of silence.
"I should have gone to the police then.  I thought that just telling his mother might avoid a fuss."
"She had the break in her lung. It got all clogged up. Me dad cried then too, and that was the last time I'd seen him cry before."
"It's good she's got a supportive family," Lestrade responded.  "It will be less hard for her."  He swallowed.  "Sherlock, I know you have Phillip's number, or at least he has yours, and if he doesn't try to reach you in the next twenty-four hours I'd like you to get a hold of him.  He likes you and he'll need to pick out someone from the lineup too."  Discomfort was evident on his face, and John imagined that he was thinking of his own children.
"Then I would say it's even less possible you liked it.  In fact, it happens when you're not dreaming anything at all."  Although this was the last time to think of something like that, John chuckled at a memory.  "When I was still in medical school I was doing a rotation in A&E one night.  It was cold and raining so the place was deserted.  At around two in the morning, a man and a teenage boy show up.  The man says he's his father and they would like to be seen.  I ask what the problem is and the man says there's no problem. 'Then what are you doing here?' I asked.  The father turns to the boy and says 'Go on, tell him.'  By this point I'm wondering what's going on, and notice the boy's not looking me in the eye.  There's a few minutes of awkward silence and finally the boy says in a hardly audible voice, 'Something came out of my penis when I was sleeping.'  The father then says: 'There!  Go on, tell him it's normal!'  I stare in disbelief at the father, wondering what kind of horrible parent you must be if you drag your kid to A&E because you can't bring yourself to explain wet dreams."
"Sort of," he evasively replied.  Before the driver could ask anything more, the courthouse came in sight, and John got out with relief.
"They apparently went to the courthouse on the day of the plea. Everyone there thought it was sad she seemed convinced she'd be convicted."
It was almost a relief to head down to Scotland Yard that Friday for their talk with Michael Ogbeide.  John had been unable to have any sort of real conversation with Sherlock after overhearing him talk to Phillip.  He’d said a few things, but only a sentence or two at a time.  Fortunately, Sherlock was in one of his silent moods, and would only nod or shake his head to any conversation.  Perhaps that was due to the three additional bags of “rubbish” he’d felt the need to get rid of.  (John knew better than to ask what was in them, and he resisted the urge to look inside them before they were collected.)  Even now, they both looked out opposing windows and tried not to acknowledge the other person in the cab with them.  When they walked into the Yard, John trailed behind him all the way to the interview room, not wanting to get too close.
"You gave an abridged version of it that was nonetheless correct in its essentials.  If you are saying that you left out most of the details, that is correct.  While I did hear Her version of the story - " As soon as Sherlock said that Phillip gasped.  "Wait.  I would like to hear what happened from your perspective if it is not abbreviated."
"Are you still worried about Phillip?" John wasn't sure of the right way to broach the subject.  Sherlock didn't do emotion, for the most part.  Of course that didn't mean he didn't have feelings; John knew better than anyone else that the whole "high-functioning sociopath" bit was a cover for feelings he refused to express.  But he kept his emotions so close to himself that it made whatever he felt barely register.  Maybe it was just the personal connection, but this case had unwound him.  Suddenly Sherlock was tender, rageful, saddened.  And afraid.
"I'll finish the book when we come back. A walk would do us all good even if we don't stop at the gift shop." Mr. Aherne tucked a bookmark inside the book, placed it on the table, and rose from his chair. "I'll be back as soon as I can, Moira," he said. Moira reached out her arms and they hugged. He kissed her forehead, took his children by hand, and walked out of the room into the hall.
"I've got something for you," Phillip said as he handed Sherlock a piece of paper.  "This might help."
Sherlock didn't say anything for a few minutes, and John thought he wasn't going to answer, but before John could ask another question he began to speak.  "We stopped in the supermarket after school.  He wished to buy some snack food.  She was there in the aisle with the sweets."  Another long silence.  "She greeted me and asked if I was busy after school.  I usually... often... I would meet Her at Her work and go home with Her once the day was over.  Victor said that I was coming home with him and She would have to talk to me later."  John clearly heard the capital letters in She and Her.  He wanted to take his hand or put an arm around his shoulder but he wasn't sure Sherlock would appreciate the contact.  "She left, he bought what he wanted and we went to his home.  His parents were not there.  We sat down on the front steps and he asked me who that was and how I knew Her.  I told him She was a friend of mine.  He asked how long I had known Her, and I told him.  He asked more questions and from something I said he was apparently able to deduce the... nature of our relationship.  He asked me how long I had been... intimate with Her.  I told him that as well.  He didn't say anything for a long period of time and finally he told me that he thought I should talk to my mother about it."
"Sherlock, it's John.  You're in your room at Baker Street and you're having a nightmare," he said again, although he was beginning to doubt this was just a nightmare.  It was beginning to trigger unpleasant feelings of recognition.
"If you've really been out in the rain all day, that's a good idea," John added.  Phillip nodded and headed back to where Sherlock pointed.  "I'm going upstairs.  Something of mine has to fit him," John said as he headed for the stairs.  "See if he wants cocoa or tea."
"God yes! I'll make it good for you I promise; if I'd known that was your first time I wouldn't have made you..."
"Need to be getting into a new line of work alreet; hardly anyone dare fish in the loch now-old Matthews swears there's more of them out there!" A half drunk burly Scott was saying to a hipster half his size.
'Oh god you killed her! It's true; mermaids drown people! And you probably cause storms too do you, hmm?!' John babbled.
"My doctor" he smiled one of those special smiles that were for John and John alone. "It's right that it was you, I wouldn't have wanted it to have been anyone else. Now come and show me what those reliable hands can do"
"Well you look like you've been at it all day so I'm calling it a day now! Christ knows what the electric bill will be" John grumbled as he went to fling open the windows.
Sherlock was worried about John; how long could he really be happy with him? Someone who wasn't even the same species!
If it looks funny that's because I'm still without computer so using phone, thanks for baring with it.
It had been three days since John had discovered the merman taking a human life, three days since he had fled from the creature he had fallen in love with, and in all that time Sherlock hadn't once been silent. John was torn between wanting to go to him before someone found the source of the strange noise, and reminding himself that he was a murderer and a liar and therefore the whole thing was most likely a trick and a con.
"The pink pussy, yeah I remember it" Bill chuckled "The place you finally, hopefully at least, dealt with your gay curiosity. I looked back before I left and you had your hands on him already!"
'Are you hungry? You look like you need feeding up..and are you always that white? I would have thought you should look more tanned what with sun reflecting off water and all...'
Sherlock hesitated for a moment before shrugging, opening his mouth and singing.  He was young, only 12 cycles, too young to work the song but there was no harm in practising.
"That place in Camden that closed a couple of years back? I might have, not socially though!" Sherlock looked aghast at the very thought.
John Watson got sent home from the army as somewhat of an invalid, and not even a proper one at that, he felt like a fraud compared to those who had lost limbs or who would be forever scarred from burns. Though it was with deep regret all round, the truth was he was useless-unfit for military service and a liability as a surgeon. He faced either an uncertain future or a very dull one handing out anti-depressants and birth control pills as a GP.
He felt like he belonged, he felt needed, it was intoxicating, plus nice home and stuff to blog about. It was better then fine, it was better then good-it was bloody fantastic.
John Watson had come every other day for a month, Sherlock watched him every time, shivering in the rapidly cooling waters, but he didn't show himself.  He was tired and hungry and so lonely he ached. Yes John was the reason Sherlock had no pod, no older brother to look out for him, but he was also a source of food, and company of a kind...
John sighed "The only thing he was interested in comes in plastic baggies. I've got to go before he hears me talking to you. I'll text you later"
John had just started to reply that there was really no need when Sherlock dived with a splash, strong tail beating the water as he moved.
"John no! " Sherlock went to stop him but he had in fact been at it all day and the heat was making his head swim unpleasantly. He slipped and John caught him. "Always there to catch me" Sherlock murmured "My dependable doctor with reliable hands"
John called but Sherlock did not re-surface so he had no choice but to head to town where he puzzled over why the merman hated him with such a passion.
The fight seemed to last an age, and as much as John wanted to see the outcome he struck out for land. He had almost made the waters edge when he heard a scream and an angry chittering similar to dolphin clicks. He turned around and saw Mycroft and a small group swimming away, water turning pink in his wake.
'I curse the name John Watson! I hate thee and all thy kin!' he slid backwards into the water and moved fast, only the ripples left behind to prove he had ever been there.
Sherlock tried and failed to hold back a gasp. He was used to simply taking what he needed from one open mouth to another, other than feeding hunger there was no pleasure, but the way John kissed was something else. He tickled lips and teased tongues and petted hair and Sherlock felt light headed from it all.
Sherlock had slipped away from his older brother, bored as usual. Ever since their parents had died in a tragic accident with the boat propellers Mycroft had become even more insufferable than usual. It didn't help that their very small pod looked to him as a leader...
John gave a happy murmur and tangled one hand in the younger boys thick curls, no longer caring that he was younger.
The end, it's short but it was always meant as an epilogue. Thank you for reading and big thanks to those of you who have left a comment or kudos etc.x
"Are you trying to kill the entire town brother mine?! You must learn to exercise some control over the song..." Mycroft outwardly scoffed while thinking quite the opposite.
"I'm not even going to ask how you know that! And it's Vanessa actually" John huffed abandoning his paper prop. "And for the love of God, for the last time, I'm not gay!"
"Sherlock I'm back! Where are you you big fish?" John called out, shivering in the Scottish winter air.
'You can talk! And English too, nice and handy' John grinned 'Not sure I understand though; put what back? the other fish?'
"Hey Bill its John, sorry to call you up on your leave time but I need that infamous memory of yours"
He kissed him again and met no resistance, John's mouth opening against his like a new bud.  They were both clumsy with inexperience but compelled by need-John desire and Sherlock hunger.
"No" John whispered "God no". He had taken out his old boat to do a spot of fishing (just like old times),but he was completely unprepared for the sight that greeted him:Sherlock and a middle aged man were kissing! In a passionate desperate way the likes of which he and John hadn't shared in weeks.
As he had scrubbed out the bath tub he had been unable to keep the smile off his face-he had found something that penetrated the thick fog that surrounded him and made him feel alive again, and he wasn't letting it go in a hurry.
'Well I've never seen anything but I was there that night and I heard the cries. They weren't human alright, but they weren't all animal neither!' his drinking companion informed him before saying he had better call it a night
Sherlock sighed like a gentle summer breeze. "We met when we were young. You were staying at your grandmothers, you went swimming alone one day and...well, I was there"
As darkness fell he tried hard to ignore the distraught whale-like song that came from the direction of the loch.
'I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm John, John Watson' the boy held his hand out of the water with an easy going friendly grin on his face.
Somehow John managed to manoeuvre the mer into the cuddy's cramped berth where he lay him gently on the bed before disappearing into the tiny bathroom.
"What's going on now?" He muttered. He had taken his liquid morning outside in the hope that the cool air would make him feel more human, and as early as the hour was the few neighbours he had had switched on their lights at the same time.
He sat unblinking and unthinking on his narrow single bed in his bland generic room, just waiting for the day to become night, both wanting and dreading the dreams and nightmares that would inevitably come. These days he only dreamt in tones of gold and scarlet and a cold dense gun metal grey.
'Ok then, I'm kinda average and it's getting late...I had better get back. It was, um, nice meeting you' John blushed.
Sherlock was lounging on the couch idly tuning his violin so John took the opportunity to sneak peeks at him over the top of his newspaper. Lately John had been getting the feeling that Sherlock was vaguely familiar.
A change of clothes and a hot meal to still his chattering teeth and John felt ready to take on the task of finding Sherlock.
He realised that there was more to it then that when the residents tumbled out their doors and started sleepwalking their way down to the loch.
After a little while Sherlock leaned back into the water humming a song the words of which John couldn't hear and the stranger followed him down. Down down, into the cold water until they resurfaced and Sherlock laid the man's body by the water's edge.
When he returned he placed something waterproof under Sherlock's tail and moved to dunk a towel in the bucket of water by the side of the bed.
John reluctantly agreed knowing himself to be woefully average compared to Sherlock, then again who wasn't?!
Sherlock smiled as the town folk came in view. If that's what it took to bring John to him, he would drown the world.
And the kissing! John was obsessed with it! To be fair Sherlock loved it too but the problem was that that was his feeding method and he couldn't switch it off. After a recent scare he had taken to distracting John by kissing other parts of his body...but he wasn't stupid and would need an answer soon. Sherlock sighed sadly and swam out to the edge of the loch to feed.
"Really John you didn't just think that the Diogenes was somewhere to read the paper in silence? And people think I'm naive about sex"
Once, many years ago, all right far less then he liked to admit, Sherlock had had to resort to selling his body for drug money. In his defense, as he told himself, it was only once and he hadn't touched drugs since. In fact he got so spectacularly off his head with the money that A, it was a minor miracle he survived, and B, he couldn't remember anything about being de-flowered or the de-flower-er.  Once he drifted back into his usual diamond sharp mind however, he made a mental note on the length and size of the finger marks that had been left behind by his enthusiastic and vigorous, if somewhat sloppy (deduction? most likely drunk)partner.
And that was how John Watson met Sherlock Holmes and other colours began to creep into his dreams, black and white and dark aubergine, pale grey and ice blue.
Whether it was a result of that comment or not he didn't know, but suddenly a great fatigue showed on Sherlock's face.  "I'm trying."
Harvey looked back towards Clark and the dock, then back to the stand.  "No further questions," she finally sighed.
"Go sit down, Arthur." The large man seemed far less irritated with him than with Sherlock. But if he had been in the same situation - wait, he was. Whoever was supposed to be here had to be with John now, in his body. He scowled at the idea, even though he suspected that whoever was in his body was not going to try to seduce John.
This comment usually made Sherlock either say something or produce a long list of items, but now he just said, "No, nothing."  With that John headed out the door and grabbed a cab to the courthouse.
"I didn't know.  Then he asked if someone said I had committed a crime."  Although it was hardly the most intimate thing he'd revealed, Phillip turned away and looked down at the ground.  "I said someone had."
“Hello there,” Sherlock said, crouching down to be on eye level with the beast.  “I presume dogs are exactly the same in this universe.”  Very few people knew about his weakness for dogs (and bees) and he intended to keep it that way.  Still, even he didn’t think if someone found out about it here it would carry over to another universe.  The dog happily jumped at his feet, clearly eager to get to know this stranger.
"K is easily able to reach the Aherne's flat at night despite not living in the area.  If K worked a normal day shift position there would be a risk of being seen in the area before nightfall.  K keeps the second flat well maintained but can't be seen there too often.  Therefore K either brings victims there before the day shift ends, so adults are not at home to witness them but children are already out of school, or after the swing shift is over.  Phillip, and presumably several other victims, come from homes where they would not be missed in those hours; distant or abusive parents, and single parents who work night shifts.  They are the ones who will spend the night at the flat, and of course all of them appreciate the closeness that results.  Moira would be missed if she vanished and as a result K decided entering the flat through the window at night would be safer. K's furniture in the other flat is minimal but well-made.  Oak, not quite antique but older items of high quality.  K must have no sentimental attachment to them since K doesn't feel the need to keep them in residence.  They are obviously discards from a collection of furniture, likely from K's parents.  If K's parents no longer need them, they are presumably not alive, and if they were wealthy enough to buy these pieces when alive K would have inherited a significant amount of money on their deaths."  He stopped for a moment and looked out the window, one hand turning white-knuckled on the folder as he grasped it.
Susan walked confidently up to the witness stand as the usher led Moira out through a side door.  "The prosecution calls Kieran Aherne."  Another usher led him to the witness stand.  Kieran was wearing a linen shirt, khaki trousers, and a tie.  He looked as uncomfortable as Moira had in a dress.  He sat down and looked up at Susan.  "Hello, Kieran," she said once he was sworn in.
"His mother just left him by himself all weekend.  She let him spend a great deal of time with someone on trial for child abuse.  You have a good case."
"Of course, one of many.  I would not be surprised if K had several flats for sexual encounters."  He looked out the window then, and John fully expected him to start talking about K again, but he remained silent on the rest of the ride to Bart's. John ate the rest of the fish and chips in silence.
"It was sort of a rub. Then it got all hot and burny. Said I really was a girl, but that was a while later."
John had almost finished his breakfast when he heard a noise from the stairs.  Sherlock appeared within a minute, wrapped in his dressing gown, a blank look on his face.  Something about the way he looked made John refrain from telling him "good morning".  The silence that hung in the air as Sherlock sat down on the couch and stared off into space wasn't much better.
They hadn't had a case then, not in a week or so at least, but John truly just wanted to share a story he found disturbing. Child abuse was so mundane that he figured Sherlock wouldn't be interested even though the Yard was involved. But he was very interested, and angry. John knew that keeping him away from the hospital was a lost cause, so he simply asked to come along with him. (If he hadn't John suspected Sherlock would have snuck into the hospital himself, and the resulting clash between him and the Yard wasn't worth thinking about.) He expected to have to drag him away from the scared, traumatized girl, but not only had he been good with the child, she asked to see him again. And that time she talked about her abuser she referred to as K. And so did Sherlock. Not much, but enough to make John ring Mycroft to demand answers. Mycroft reluctantly gave them. He told a horribly truthful account of how he had noticed warning signs but wasn't able to do anything about them until his brother rang him one day with a request to come home. How he'd come home and his mother informed him Sherlock was telling "horrible lies" about a neighbor, not saying who was involved but clearly saying it was a sexual issue, and that Sherlock was going away to school for the first time. Mycroft had demanded to know who it was, but she refused to reveal it, and died a few months later. How Sherlock had claimed complete ignorance about whoever it was that he'd supposedly lied about. How he still regarded it as his biggest failure.
"It's not something I thought about until recently," John admitted. He turned and started towards the door
"What could they possibly say about me?" Mr. Aherne said bewilderedly.  "That I'm negligent for letting her walk the dog alone?"  John wanted to laugh at his naivety; he could think of many things the solicitors might deem suspect.
"In most cases K can meet Her victims in a neutral place until She is satisfied with their ability to remain silent.  However, She met Phillip in the course of Her work.  One might be able to pass off a meeting in a public place as a chance encounter, but when a four year old boy who isn't your own child repeatedly comes to your workplace you need another option."
"She's brave," John commented as the Ahernes stepped out of sight.  "Being able to confront her abuser like that."  He pointedly did not look at Sherlock as he said it, although he was under no illusion that Sherlock had missed his meaning.
"Get out of here now!"  Sherlock leapt off the sofa and turned towards his brother, clearly furious.  "I thought I made it clear you weren't wanted!"
"Hello," he replied in a much cheerier tone than the other victims.  He had a clear accent but he did not hesitate with his English.
Sherlock put the photo down on the table. John picked it up. Phillip Rodgers did not look like a happy child. His black hair hung over his eyes and his mouth seemed fused in a scowl. For thirteen he still looked very boyish, his face still round like a child's, no sign of puberty molding it at all. If what his teachers said was right, and he had no siblings or friends and a distant mother, he was indeed the type of child an abuser would look for.
Sherlock's terror seemed to only be growing by the minute, and he stared blankly at her with no inkling of a response.  John wanted to punch the woman, but he knew that would be hard to explain to the police if it came to that.  The police would see the same kind looking woman John had seen at first.  "Kelly," Sherlock finally choked out.  "Kelly Martin."
For some reason, hearing K called "Dr. Martin" always unnerved John.  The thought that someone who had gone through the same training he had - and even worse, someone who regularly cared for children - could still be that sort of monster was hard to believe.  Dr. Arthur had been racist, sexist, and arrogant, but John hadn't wanted to divorce him from their shared profession.  He swallowed before speaking.  "Since she used to work at St. Bart's, would you be able to go through the records there and look for anything?  For all we know, some of the victims could have been treated by her."
"You got married, so you must have worked some of that out," John said. He wondered what the solution was for him.
"The court will adjourn for five minutes," the judge said once the conversation finished.  One usher led the jury out while several others led the audience to the doors.  John went with the rest of them and they got herded back into the court five minutes later.  Moira looked like she had been crying, but seemed composed enough now.
"This is about that case you two have been working on for weeks, isn't it?" she said matter-of-factly.  Unable to speak, John just nodded.  "He's not going to be happy when he sees this.  I thought I'd better warn you."  She clearly meant Sherlock.  After several seconds of silence, she went on.  "Has he told you much about what happened to him?"
"Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena," Sherlock confirmed.  "Brought here by her father.  You stated in your report that you felt her father was responsible."
I knew that the child mentioned was Jennifer and that the doctor that thought her father had done it was also going to come up later, for a variety of reasons.
"Ginger boy with a lot of freckles?  Brown eyes?  Not very tall and has a stutter?" Lestrade asked, obviously wanting him to be a stranger as well.
She shook her head.  "I don't think they knew.  I can give you their number so you can ring them up, but there's only Mrs. Forrester and their three kids now; Mr. Forrester died two years ago."
Once both of them were out of sight, Mr. Rodgers said "He saw the news and he couldn't stop crying."
“It was your friend who got your little bee burned, you know.  I know he was putting ideas in your head.  Your mummy told me all about it.”  She once again reached out to touch Sherlock's chin, tracing it with her finger.  While he started to shake even more, he made no effort to move.  “She was upset about how ungrateful you were to me, how you'd come over and refused to leave so many times and she had to make sure you were behaving yourself.  I was kind about that, remember?  I said you weren't any trouble, but we both know that's not true.” Dr. Martin looked like she was in the depths of fond memories.  “Remember the games we used to play?  You missed your big brother, how he'd pick you up and whirl you around.  I'd always whirl you around, though.  Round and round. Round and round the garden like a teddy bear...”
"I'm going back home," he said.  He wanted answers to where Sherlock kept disappearing to, and waiting until the end of the day seemed much too long.  He strode towards the front door, down the steps, and out to the pavement, where he hailed a cab back.
"Suspicions of sexual abuse.  Well, not just suspicions.  There was obvious medical evidence but they didn't know who had done it and they felt she'd be safer in care."
He shook his head.  "They told me she didn't talk.  No matter who tried to interview her, she just sat there without saying a word each time."
An eerie silence hung over the court as Mrs. Harvey came to stand in front of all of them.  John resisted the urge to be angry at her.  Even the worst criminals needed a defense, and she was just doing her job.  That didn't stop his stomach muscles from contracting, though.  "Mr. George was right before.  Child abuse is a horrible topic, and many abusers are right amongst us," she began.  "It's such a horrible topic that sometimes we lose the ability to think rationally about it.  The photographs he mentioned do in fact exist, but they are not Dr. Martin's at all and in fact belong to someone else.  Someone we will show has considerable reason to be angry with Dr. Martin."  Her constant use of "Dr. Martin" irritated John; he knew it was an attempt to make her seem as respectable as possible.  "But Dr. Martin has never had any complaints in her long pediatric career.  She's never had any complaints about her foster care work.  Unfortunately, there is one individual who has a grudge against her.  He is the one who is responsible for all of the charges now, and he is sadly mentally unbalanced.  As this trial goes on, we hope you will see that there is nothing Dr. Martin is guilty of other than placing trust in the mentally ill.  Thank you."
Of course it's rehearsed - he's repeated it in his head for years even though his mother only said it a few times before she died.
John got a good look at him once he was in the stand.  He'd expected Phillip to be in a suit and was surprised to see he wore a dark navy jumper and khaki trousers.  Once he'd gotten used to it, he realized why: it made Phillip look younger, emphasizing his more boyish features.  His hair was neatly combed for once and not hanging over his eyes.
"Should I tell him or will you?"  John hoped she would; it wasn't a conversation he was looking forward to at all.
"I was arguing with someone. My arm got twisted; I think it was going to be held to my back, but it snapped."
"Look up the statute."  Sherlock turned on the sofa so he was no longer facing the telly.  He pulled out his mobile from one of his coat pockets and started to fiddle with it.  Since he clearly didn't want to continue the conversation, John grabbed his laptop and decided to do just that.  As he pulled up the CPS site Sherlock's mobile rang.  "Yes, I saw the news," he said with no introduction.  Josh suspected it was Phillip.  "No, I understand.  He's your brother and he loves you; he wants to see Her punished because She hurt you."  Phillip of course was an only child; it had to be Moira Aherne.  "You can feel that way if you want.  Have you talked about it with your dad?  I think you should do that too.  Yes, I'd like to see that experiment when you've done it.  Yes, I liked your card for me.  Your dad's calling you?  You should probably go, then."
"I'll come with you."  And while John thought he'd just lie there awake, Sherlock actually fell asleep before he did.  John hoped he wasn't going to lie there awake like the past two nights.  Thankfully, Sherlock's even breathing was enough to lull him into sleep.
"No, but I saw her give the clerk the money, and I said thank you.  And 'English bad' so she'd know that I couldn't really talk much to her."
"I've gone to a few computer places to see if they can retrieve anything off it.  But all they have gotten so far is strange error messages.  That more than anything else makes me think something is on it.  If it was really empty, it'd just say so, right?"
He slumped in his chair again, losing the little height he had gained last time.  "I can't talk to people like normal people do.  I know you're supposed to go up to them and ask for their name and what they like and all those questions but I never could do that."
The creature opened its eyes and slowly took in his surroundings, confusion rapidly giving way to panic.
I am truly sorry this has taken so long! I won't bother giving you reasons and excuses because you don't really care ; I will just say I am still only on a not great mobile phone as haven't had the spare cash for laptop, so it will still look a bit weird in parts...
Sherlock hesitated  "Perhaps, I don't know, I've never...where would I even find that many people?" He questioned.
John nodded at the fisherman to show that he did understand him.  Five years back when his grandmother had passed away she left her home in loch awe to him, and now he was cast adrift from the world since his army injury he had finally moved in. Nothing for him in London anymore and his therapist believed going some place that held happy memories would be good for him. Which all led to his hearing monster stories in the pub.
"So what do you think? She's a beauty isn't she?" John changed the subject, beaming at the shiny white cuddy. "I added the red stripe myself"
"I didn't think you were interested in that kind of thing?" John managed to say while his mind was chanting 'please say I was wrong please say I was wrong'
Sherlock hadn't been expecting to be caught, he rarely saw humans out here these days. He didn't think honesty was the best option to go for so he lied and manipulated.
'All done. If only all my patients were that good. Being in the water I can't really put anything on it so I'll just have to hope it heals alright. Keep it clean and I guess it should'
Massive apologies to everyone reading for the fact I'm so bad at updating!! As a reader I do know how annoying it is to be enjoying something but the writer appears to have a summer home on mars where there is no signal so a decade passes between chapters! If it helps I will finish all my wips...I'm hoping to get them done before Xmas, or at least before next year...
"Right on time!" Bill roared.  "Tell me that isn't a sign? I could almost fancy him myself. Lets get home lads, some of us have got a country to invade in the morning"
The man took the wallet that John held out. 80 quid. He felt a brief pang that his virginity would cost so little but he wanted the drug more. One more night to get off his face before Mycroft and Lestrade forced him to get clean. God they made him sick, bonding together like hens over a chick. They were worse than his parents. He made himself focus on the present. "Just so we're clear, you want to fuck me?"
"Well I heard Mycroft lecturing the pod once on how they couldn't afford to be that fussy over gifts and it was their duty to find a mate because there are so few of us left, so I thought 'are these the gifts'?" Sherlock explained slowly.
John huffed in irritation as he could tell Bill was just dying to burst out laughing. "No nothing like that. We broke up anyway,  I'm between girlfriends"
"How did her family feel when you left the country?"  Her highly accusing tone made it sound like he had abducted his children instead of just moving.
Since Sherlock was curled up on himself, and speaking in such a low voice, John almost didn't hear his response.  "Different."
"Just about the worst you can imagine," John told him.  "I'm glad the police showed up before I was forced to strangle her."
He walked over to stand with Susan and John.  "Ah, you're late.  The family of Victim Five is in the waiting room already."
"If we can get permission from their parents," he replied, still not looking at Sherlock.  "By the way, Mr. Aherne called the Yard earlier today and he said that Moira wants to talk to you again this weekend."
"Did you ever get angry with her about a perceived lack of physical affection?"  Harvey was clearly going somewhere, but it was hard to tell where.
"How did K know him?"  John wondered if that was too direct a question.  He felt like he was trying to make a conversation out of cobwebs without breaking any of them.
Within ten minutes they were all in a cab on the way to the airport.  Sherlock still hadn't said a word to any of them, but no one seemed to think this was unusual.  It was a short trip, and with the hassle of going through customs and security, no one tried to talk to Sherlock at all.  He knew he was going to have to say something soon, although he wondered how everyone hadn't noticed that something was off.  Perhaps this Martin often acted strangely.
Martin stepped out of the bathroom and into the hall, and then into the nearby bedroom. He self-consiously began going through the clothes in the wardrobe. Almost all of them were made of silk or other fine fabric and looked like the sort of thing that would cost him a year's salary. He finally settled on a white button-down shirt and dark blue trousers that didn't look quite as costly as the other clothes. That done, he headed back to the hallway where the other man was standing. "Come on, I'll bring you into the sitting room." He led Martin down the hall and into a comfortable looking room with two chairs and a sofa. Martin sat gingerly on the sofa. The man took a seat on one of the chairs and said "Well, that proves you're telling the truth. He'd never look so uncoordinated."
"You're not angry with me?" The way he said it, combined with the stuffed toy he continued to be wrapped him around, made him seem like a scolded child.
"I did it too," he quietly mumbled.  "And Her flat... sometimes She had other people there.  Little kids."
He doesn't expect a truthful answer here at all; he's just asking to see how she reacts, which of course confirms that she's not telling the truth. If you're wondering how K got into the hospital in the first place, she still has her old ID badge. When she goes into the clinic later and runs into Sarah, she's also trying to get in the hospital to see if she can find any other records of the other victims. The new job doesn't exist. As a side note, she never cared much for Sarah because Sarah's suspicions, as small as they were, showed up. K knows perfectly well that anyone who isn't charmed by her needs to be regarded with suspicion. She doesn't think she's doing anything wrong (more on that in later parts) but she does know that other people think it's wrong.
The boy spat on the ground. "No. James. Jim is what my mum called me." After a minute he said "I saw those papers today."
John almost asked the woman who came to the door where her husband was. He was eternally glad he hadn't done so, because a few exchanges between her and Sherlock revealed that not only was she the one who had abused the children, she'd also been the one that abused Sherlock. And she didn't seem to feel bad about it. She smiled the whole time. Sherlock was the one who practically had to be carried back to Baker Street. From there things had only gotten worse.
?' You have two choices: one is painful and scary, but sometimes good, and you know what it's like. The other is totally unknown, but along the lines of the same thing. Do you go with the known, or try the other one? You'd probably go to the known one, right?" Peter folded his hands in front of him. "Are you really surprised he doesn't want to see what's behind the other door?"
"Yes, he always has, even before we moved here. He's supposed to sleep on the floor but recently she's been letting him sleep in her bed. I've told her he's not allowed up there but she hasn't listened."
"The prosecution calls Sherlock Holmes," said Susan once she got to the front of the court.  The usher led him in.  The usher was a small man, even shorter than John, which made the sight of him leading in Sherlock even more odd.  Sherlock hadn't taken off the coat or scarf, and he still clutched Hamish to his chest.  John suddenly thought of the person who had laughed at Phillip and prayed they weren't in the courtroom that day.  If they were, they didn't laugh this time.  In fact, there was nothing but silence in the room.  Sherlock looked so young, and he had an expression on his face that looked like a scolded child.  He did appear to see John, and fixed his eyes on him instead of Susan.  John smiled in what he hoped was a reassuring way.
"At this point, no."  He opened the laptop again, took out the flash drive and put it aside, and his hands started to fly across the keyboard.  It was almost like he had forgotten John was there, and uncertain what to do himself, John simply left the room.
For once he didn't bother to make coffee before leaving, just headed out the door and hailed a cab. If he really was going to sit with Dominic and Martin all day they'd most likely be eating together.  John really didn't know either of them well; the only thing he'd heard from them after the interview was at the support group, where Gloria had mentioned Martin now lived with them.  All he could remember were their haunted looks and ragged appearances.  Fortunately the cab driver didn't try to chat, so he could be along with his thoughts.
“That is an excellent idea, provided you can get permission to do so.”  He shifted in the chair so he was facing the window and not looking in John’s direction anymore.  “I am curious about the family dynamic in that case.”
"Sherlock's bee. Why did it get taken away from him?" He had no idea why he said that, of all things, but it worked. Mycroft gave a heavy sigh.
"This is why I talk to you." Phillip paused. "You understand." Another pause. "And don't tell me I have nothing to be ashamed of, because I know I do."
"Five years ago, for a little over a year.  They were the last children she'd fostered, incidentally.  They originally came to the country with their great-aunt, the only surviving member of the family.  She died while they awaited formal refugee status, so the two of them went into care once all the paperwork was done."
"Give me a minute and I'll come up with you."  Sherlock pressed a few buttons to shut down the computer, picked up Hamish, and headed for the stairs. John as usual gave him time to change, changing his own clothes for pajamas in the bathroom.  Once he came out Sherlock was perched on his side of the bed, Hamish against his chest, like there hadn't been a time where he was gone at all.  That reassured John enough that he fell asleep shortly after his head hit the pillow.
Sherlock opened the can and downed the pills with a large swallow of the soda.  He rested his free arm on his bee.  He looked exhausted and John wondered if he had slept at all that night.  For a few minutes all he did was take large gulps out of the can.  Once he was done he set the can down on the table, making a metallic clank.  "I can't get the taste out of my mouth," he said.
"She said I was a psychopath, but only about sex."  John expected Susan to ask another question, but instead Sherlock went on.  "I asked why She had to take the pictures and She said that if I got too bad She'd have to send them to my brother so he'd know what a problem I was."
Once the three of them left the interview room, Mr. Aherne shook both their hands. "I need to make sure I'm home before the children get out of school. Thank you, for letting me hear this, and for letting such a good man talk to my daughter." He turned and left after this, which gave John and Lestrade time to chuckle to themselves. They walked back to Lestrade's office, where the door was still shut.
"Not at first."  Sherlock fixed his eyes on the ground.  "After a few times She invited me in for a drink and a biscuit."
John gave him a cautious look, and it was enough to halt the laughter in his throat. After Martin had composed himself, he went on. "You said you wanted to ring your boss?"
"I pled guilty," Mrs. Bena said, her voice becoming stronger.  "I'd done it and I knew I had done it.  Nothing else to do, really.  I got three years."  She looked directly at the audience.  "When I got in there I had to go to a drug program.  Part of the routine.  Michael wrote me several times.  He was seeing Jennifer twice a week and was doing all those things to get her back.  I was happy for that, really, because Michael's a good man."
John can't keep his head in the sand any longer. He already knows what Mycroft will say, pretty much, but still needs to hear it. (The end of the text, with an H instead of a W, was a typo of mine. Since my post on the meme was still anon then, I couldn't fix it, but made a joke about it in the next chapter. Although I personally think if anyone changed their last name on marriage, it would be Sherlock.)
Mr. Ogbeide blinked in surprise, but retold the story he'd already given, with only a few minor differences in word choice.  "Once she had been examined by some doctors and discharged, she got taken into care."
"This is giving me a headache." Martin wasn't joking; his head had started to throb. "You don't know any famous Martin Crieff's in fiction that happen to be pilots, do you?" If he was a fictional character in this world he wasn't sure how to react.
"No."  He certainly didn't approve, but if drugs were all that were keeping Sherlock from fleeing to parts unknown it would have to do until after the trial.  Sherlock looked at him for a second, then moved to the sofa, where he stretched out and shut his eyes.  In the time it took John to go to the kitchen, get a drink, and return, he had fallen asleep.  John sat down and turned on his laptop, realizing that he'd been neglecting almost everyone else in his life since the trial had begun.  He sent a few emails out apologizing for his absence, and then ate a silent lunch.  Since he didn't want to leave Sherlock by himself, he sat down in his chair and read a book.  When he woke up they could talk more.
"Of course.  Cocaine destroys the nasal passage. Takes away your sense of smell.  And it damages the cartilage."  He looked at John as if it were obvious.  Before John could say anything, he reached for the remote and turned on the news.
"What did you see that's so important?" John asked Sherlock as he stood up and turned towards the desk in a dramatic twirl, grinning wildly.
"I think so, but she isn't saying much to me.  Not eating much either, just the occasional banana or apple or package of crisps."  Rodney looked down, smoothing his spiked hair with one hand.
Whether Sherlock was aware that John was watching from the window, he didn't know.  He grinned and although he was too far away to see, John imagined that his eyes had just lit up.  "Oh, yes, this will be very helpful.  I'll go right now.  Thank you, Phillip."  He twirled and looked like he was about to dart off without a second thought, but stopped after a few steps and turned around.  "Go home, Phillip, or go somewhere safe."  Phillip said nothing in response, but nodded and walked back in the direction he’d come from.
It was only after he spoke that John was reminded that today was a Friday.  Phillip would have to come back on Monday for the cross-examination.  Unlike yesterday, he left quickly, feeling anxious.  He hailed a cab and headed back home.  Conversations with Sherlock from before floated into his mind, and he prayed that once he got there Sherlock would not have done anything stupid.
Sherlock snorted.  “Of course. He has no friends other than K, and he’s desperately afraid of losing that friendship.  He’s also afraid that he will be arrested, because of nine years of conditioning that K has used to convince him he is the one responsible for any sexual activity.  He has found from our one conversation that I am willing to listen to him, and he wants to tell someone about what is going on.  Even though he thinks it is his fault he wants to talk about it simply because he never has before and I have mentioned –” He cut himself off mid-sentence.  “Suffice to say I understand many of the feelings he currently has.”
"You should sleep in your room tonight."  Sherlock broke the silence even though he still faced the sofa back and not the room.  "I won't be sleeping for some time."
"Sherlock?" John said again, wondering if he should shake him awake or not.  He came to stand beside the bed and put a hand on the mattress.
John hadn't expected the conversation to turn back in this direction, so he was momentarily speechless.  "Bullshit.  You care about me.  And you've admitted you would be interested in pursuing a relationship with me but haven't done so because of the sex bit.  I basically offered you that and you turned it down.  So you're hardly some sex fiend who has to attack people to satisfy some urge.  Even if you were, it wouldn't make a difference.  She was the adult, you were the child."  He realized that the last sentence was something he'd said several times already over the last few days.  While he'd said it, there appeared to be no real way he could get through with it.  In Sherlock's mind he'd been the bad one, not her.  That thought was enough to open the floodgates, and before he realized what he was doing he sat on the other end of the sofa and started to sob.
"You're good with your patients," Lestrade said. "We'd like to take you to the ward and talk to the girl. If she talks it would be a big help. And you're the only doctor on the staff we've worked with in a criminal context."
"The bathroom is in there.  Go take a hot shower and I'll find you some of John's clothes to wear," Sherlock instructed him.
"Yes!" Apparently he had explained it well enough. "If he's there, and I'm here, and we're both in the same there, we can at least swap. But if we're in different theres, there's no way to go there from here."
"Shocked at first.  It seemed so hard to believe - not that it could happen to one of my children, but that it was a secret for so long.  Then Moira told me she didn't know who had done it.  I thought she might be telling the truth, but the officers said that was unlikely."
"No.  Last time I talked to her she was still sleeping with it.  Lots of people have some old toy they cherish."
Rory the dog was sprawled out on Moira's bed, but got off it and came over to the two children, who patted his head and scratched his ears eagerly.  "You remember Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, don't you?" Moira said.  He walked over to where John and Sherlock were standing and sniffed them.  Apparently satisfied they were not intruders, the dog lay down on the actual dog bed on the floor.  "He probably wanted to see if you had any sweets," said Moira.  She sat down on the bed and motioned for Sherlock to sit there as well.
Moira shook her head.  "No.  He's got more time because he works for some other people instead of by himself so he doesn't have to do everything."
"I can give him your number and tell him to ring you, but I don't know if I can just give his number to you," she said.  "Is whatever you saw in the records something you can discuss?"
As he rowed past he saw a body half slumped in the water and half out. Paying no attention to the odd clothing he pulled up alongside and felt for a sign of life. Getting a pulse he manhandled the unconscious body into the boat easily enough as the torso was skin and bones. The tail when it flopped in was rather more weighty.
"John! I thought, I thought..." Sherlock couldn't speak past the uncomfortable lump in his throat and realisation dawned on John.
Forgot to say, the pink pussy comes from P G Wodehouses blandings, how jack farthing ever says that with a straight face I don't know :-)
"Shit! Sherlock, I'm so sorry! I should have come down sooner...I didn't want to spend all the money I made from the pearl so I got a second hand boat; I've been doing her up and fixing some stuff in the house...I won't leave you Sherlock, not unless you asked me to!"
A sleek head broke the surface of the water but he didn't say what John might have expected him too. 'Why are you following me? Have you told others about me?'
Write a blog his therapist had said, it will honestly help she said. He didn't think that 'Thinking about re-decorating in shades of blood and brain matter' was what she had in mind though so he reluctantly went for a walk where he met an old friend.
Sherlock was cold, the combination of net and kelp he wore no longer adequate. Yes he could leave if he wanted to and he had tried, but he always came back to the loch. The pod might come back for him, his brother might come back for him...but so far they had not and Sherlock had grown up alone with only his own voice and thoughts for company. The only conversation he had came from talking to himself or the occasional porpoise.
Sherlock had no opinion on the attractiveness of boats but he could tell it meant a lot to John, plus it was nice to be asked what he thought about anything at all really after being alone so long.
"I don't expect you to understand My but I love him. John Watson is my mate, was my mate...it's complicated"
Mike nodded with a look of pity on his face and fake understanding and John felt his teeth clench together.
Sherlock startled at the unexpected voice and the boy laughed as he fell off the rock into the water.
'No, put me back. Look' John gestured to himself 'me, you'-he waved a hand at the mer 'When you're talking about yourself you say me'
John frowned as he tried to chase a memory blown like a leaf by the autumn wind. "You've said that before, about my hands"
"Its always been there John, you are just shockingly unobservant" Sherlock informed him scathingly. "It happens to be where I sleep if you must know; no cosy cave in the blue waters of the Mediterranean for me"
"I always knew you would return! It is the only thing that has kept me here" Sherlock finished saying when all the humans had departed.
Broken ribs from the impact of a muscular tail gave them plenty of time; time for explorers and their camera crews to leave, frustrated, time for explanations and apologies, time for love to flourish.
"Shouldn't you be migrating to some place warmer?" for selfish reasons John didn't want to ask that question but he also didn't want the mer to get sick.
As before, thanks for the kudos makes it all worthwhile :-) Don't be afraid to leave a quick comment, I would love to hear from you.
"Oh god, you've been alone for all that time?! Sherlock I'm so sorry, I don't blame you for hating me. I'll go and I'll never come back"
I did do some research on boats and cuddys etc and I know that one probably couldn't fit a man and a merman, but eh, it's fiction!
John clutched his empty glass like a life line while cool eyes raked over him intently sizing him up.
As he stood under the spray of tepid water Sherlock overlaid the prints John had made with the ones of that night, up in the attic of his mind palace,  to find they fit perfectly, an exact match in fact.
John pinched the bridge of his nose and tried to stem the tide of rising hysteria that was threatening to engulf him. "I'm not completely stupid despite what you think, you went there to buy drugs, fine I don't care about that, but Christ Sherlock, I paid you to have sex with me! How can you not remember that? "
'It takes practice that's all, I haven't been doing it long' John huffed as he reeled in the line, only to fall back in the boat when it snapped.
As the theme to jaws was irritatingly and inexplicably playing in John's head, he was seriously regretting his decision to come in the old boat instead of his cuddy. The boat that left him open and exposed.
With a tut Mycroft motioned to them to slowly submerge while the bewildered humans snapped out of their trance and made their way back to their homes.
Sherlock swam around the boat singing a different song, his peoples fishing song. He had become very good at it, all alone he had to be else he would starve.
Ever since that day in the cuddy with Sherlock, John had been unable to keep the happy grin off his face. Alright a relationship with a merman, a bloody mythological creature for crying out loud!, and a male at that, wasn't how he imagined his life would turn out, and sadly he would never be able to introduce him to his mates, but for all that John was happy for the first time in a long while. In fact he would have to learn to rein it in as several of the old ladies he did odd jobs for were starting to ask who his sweetheart was and when could they meet her. Perhaps he could bribe Molly into playing his beard? He laughed at the thought.
In the end it wasn't as bad as he expected it would be, the doctor was more gentle than he should have been for which he was grateful, but of course it still hurt and John was too high on alcohol and bliss too notice.
"Stop! I don't mind you looking and I can put up with your ignorant comments, but no touching Sherlock! Not unless you want us to be more than friends" John huffed a laugh.
The army had made him and now it was returning him broken: he felt like a jack-in-the-box that couldn't jump, a puppet whose strings had been cut, an old cuddly teddy bear after its fuzzy fluff has been completely worn away.
I'm going with the idea that while they can and do eat, they need human life force/energy from humans (obtained through a kiss) to actually survive-like the cat things in Stephen kings sleepwalkers if anyone has seen that?
Harvey continued on like she hadn't heard him.  "When she refused you she said you got very angry and she had to restrain you."
"As I said before, Sherlock was bored silly for most of the time he was here.  He took a look at the newspaper archives for the past year or so to see if he could solve any of the crimes.  He found a string of murders, all of older, short, dark-haired women.  The police weren't sure if they were connected because the cause of death was different in all the cases, but you know Sherlock.  He found out all he could about them from the paper and from asking questions."  She looked at K's picture again.  "He turned over all the evidence to the police with a description of the killer.  Two days later they knocked on my door and asked for Edwin.  Sherlock knew about the arrest, but he went back to England before the trial started.  The police thanked him and said without that evidence they'd have never found the killer.  He was tried, sentenced, and executed.  It was all fast because he never appealed."
"It was nice, you were nice. I had never talked to a human before you...my brother didn't like it; our parents were killed because of humans and he didn't trust you, he claimed I had put the pod in danger so he left me behind when they left for warmer water"
"You were the first in every way and I find myself wishing I did have a memory of that night..." John couldn't move or speak as the swish of Sherlock's silk robe  moved closer, rather like a bad horror film he unhelpfully thought.
"Sherlock? Sherlock where are you?" John whispered out of the window. "Come on you big fish; it's me, John!"
"There's not much to go over. With any luck we can get through the direct and cross today and move on to our next witness. I think you should get a seat in the courtroom now," Susan told John.  "Near the front."
"Those exist, but in several cases convictions have been overturned later because that manner of testifying wasn't deemed appropriate," Lestrade quietly said.  "I only want to see this trial happen once.  Unfortunately that means every victim's going to have to appear in person."
"I have made sure of that."  He looked at the ground again and the rest of the group fell into silence.
took a second murder before he solved it.  He hadn't bothered to read any of the others; they clearly weren't worth his time.)
At this point John figured it would be easier on all of them to change the subject.  "When was the last time you slept?"  It wasn't that he didn't want to encourage Sherlock to talk about K, because he wanted him to.
“After she was sentenced.  The social services workers were moving to terminate her parental rights and were trying to work out a plan for me to get Jennifer back.”  Mr. Ogbeide sounded remarkably calm.  His voice no longer wavered.  “The man appeared on the steps of my flat and said he wanted to talk to me, said he'd known Debra.  I wanted nothing to do with him, but he said he thought there was something he should tell me about my daughter.  That caught my attention.  He told me that she often bought 'substances' from him.  Since he noticed she didn't work, he asked her where she was getting the money, and if it was support money.  She told him there were ways, and didn't seem too bothered about it.  A few days after he asked that he was leaving the flat and saw Jennifer standing by the door.  She asked him if he was coming to take her away.  He thought that was strange and asked where she thought he'd take her.  She said, 'To the fucking room.'  He was disturbed enough to leave and not go back to the flat again.”  The calmness had faded into a flat tone.  “Apparently that was all he knew, but he told me when I got her back I should leave the area.”
"Martin?"  He turned to see John standing behind him.  "I know this is still a bit of a shock for you, but I know a doctor who I'd like to have look you out.  A medical examiner, really, but she can be quiet about all this.  I doubt there's something physically different about you now, but it can't hurt."  Martin looked at the clock on the laptop and realized he'd been reading for more than an hour.
"Not now. I want you to wait until you've talked to Moira Aherne again. I'd also like to tape that conversation, and I'll talk to her father about that. If you're going to be working on this case I think we'll need proof that you're good with the children you're going to question." He took a long sip of his tea before speaking again. "Once the other Yarders hear all of that it'll be easier for me to convince them. According to her father, she gets out of the hospital in two days. There's a school holiday on Thursday, so if you want to go over then I'll talk to him."
"Yeah, and she took me by the arm.  Said I needed a place to lie down before I fell over.  She took me to a car and let me lie down in the back seat."
Moira reached one arm back to bring Brownie into her arms before talking.  "When I said no one came to see me in the hospital but me dad and Kieran and Dierdre?  That wasn't true."
“Did you know before this case that…” Lestrade didn’t finish the sentence.  He sat down behind the desk and started looking through a file drawer.
"I shouldn't have," she told him.  At that point she noticed that they were blocking a door and ducked into an unused office nearby, gesturing for John to join her.  "We have time to talk; you're early anyway."  John knew he had been early, almost an hour early, but he couldn't bear one more minute of Sherlock silently staring off into space with that blank look on his face.  He followed her into the office.  "She was always well liked, that's true," she continued after shutting the door.  "And on some level I liked her.  But at the same time I should have gone with my instincts."
