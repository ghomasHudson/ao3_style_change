Sherlock blinked, pulled in a sharp breath, and said the last thing John expected. “Haven’t a clue.”
Maze had that pinched look of mixed irritation and murder that meant she’d been trying to get his attention for at least five minutes. Oops. “What are you staring at?”
“This is nice,” John said appreciatively. He approached one of the couches and ran a hand over it, humming his contentment at what was surely a soft material.
There were fifty-eight U.S. murders in the file. Forty-one of them were in California, each one moving just a bit closer to Los Angeles.
Fascinating. He created space for a new experience even as he participated in it. He’s added a splash of colour to his monochrome, and seemingly come away intact; perhaps his Work wouldn’t suffer as much as he first thought.
She pours the other half for herself and crashes it into his, laughing like it’s the most hilarious thing she’s ever seen. He envies her lightheartedness and is very tempted to chug it. Then he remembers Greg’s advice and pulls out his phone.
Sherlock sat against the far wall, away from everyone else, with his head on his knees. The other passengers were standing about, taking in their surroundings and each other. Martha Hudson was standing near John. He had held her hand for most of the journey to this place.
Sherlock gets up and walks to the kitchen holding the blanket around his hips like a skirt. John has an apron over his T-shirt and jeans and is stirring something in a pan on the stove, clearly the source of the wonderful smell. He looks at the blanket and raises an eyebrow.
“Always. Our arrangement is always open to negotiation, Sherlock. I expect you to bring up questions or concerns whenever you have them and right away. The only reason I’m in charge is that we both want it that way. If there’s something you want to change, you have to let me know. I need to be able to trust you to be honest with me. Ok?” He tilts Sherlock’s chin up with his finger.
John's line about it is a direct quote from my father (may he RIP and not notice what his daughter is writing) who was Italian and knew many operas by heart.
“Not a problem,” John said. “Is turbulence your only trigger—for the panic attacks? There are antidepressants you can take that might help. I could write them down for you.”
Sherlock had never exactly looked forward to Scotland Yard’s annual Christmas party, but John always liked to stop in on it for a few hours, and Sherlock supposed it was nice to catch up with Dimmock and Hopkins and the rest. In any case, the food was usually good and the champagne flowed freely, and sometimes they even got lucky enough to hire a half-decent DJ and make for a mildly pleasant evening, if not exactly fun.
The familiar voice made his eyes snap open, and he turned his head to see Lestrade, who was looking much less grouchy tonight – though he did have a nearly-empty glass of wine in his hand.
It had been a long week, and John’s sleep schedule was utterly shot. They’d worked a case for most of the night on Tuesday, slept into the afternoon Wednesday, then had another in erratic bursts until Saturday, when they’d grabbed naps whenever they could. It was a gloomy Sunday afternoon now, and John had only had about four hours of sleep last night before they’d had to get up early for one last trip to the Yard, and now that they were done John felt drained and disoriented. It was only two in the afternoon, but he knew the rest of the day would be a write-off. He sat down heavily in his chair with a book, while Sherlock stood over in the corner plucking at his violin. John would have to write up the case tomorrow.
He spotted a pretty blonde woman leaning against the frame of the door that led out to the patio, and moved toward her.
They broke off, both gasping. John’s mind was overloaded with sensation, his whole body on fire. He could barely open his eyes to look at Sherlock again.
John cried out as Sherlock’s fingers crooked inside him, brushing just so against his prostate and sending a jolt of pleasure through him like an earth-shattering thunderclap. John’s fingers dug into Sherlock’s shoulders, and he was
John’s heart seized up in his chest. Sherlock was looking directly at him, his expression a mix of shock, confusion, and apprehension. Clearly, this possibility had never crossed his mind, and he was stunned beyond all measure.
happened – since they’d been there. His mind felt dense as honey, snippets of words and phrases floating around in a disorganized mess;
There was a warmth in John’s chest now, not just from the heat of Sherlock’s body. He wasn’t just comfort, he was John’s true north, his light in the dark. He could make anywhere feel perfect. Together, they
The telltale sound of the blade of a knife sweeping under the window pane echoed through the sitting room. Orlova stopped moving, but didn’t turn around. He grew silent, and Sherlock all but held his breath.
Just a simple kiss – chaste, close-lipped and fleeting – but a kiss all the same, and John closed his eyes and took it all in – the bare, ephemeral feeling of Sherlock’s lips, his fingers brushing John’s cheek.
“We’ll still do all the things we always do,” John went on, sort of breathless now, and speaking quickly. “It’s just…Mary will be there, sometimes.”
He lingered a bit, stirring sugar and milk into their respective cups, eavesdropping on Donovan griping to Hopkins a few cubicles away about Sherlock solving another case on seemingly impossible odds. A lot of not-so-nice words floated over into his ears, followed by her bitterly spitting out “can’t
Their eyes met. John felt breathless, like the air had pressed in on his lungs and frozen them in place.
Two excruciatingly long weeks of this had dragged by before Sherlock had finally snapped. The previous night he had called Mycroft, not bothering to hide his fury, and gave him an ultimatum. At long last, Sherlock had identified the primary suspect of the murders and, based on her previous targets, had unearthed the most likely location of her next strike. The force was preparing to stake out the place the following evening and catch her by surprise, and Sherlock had told Mycroft that he either needed to bring John in for the event, or Sherlock would back out. Another sizeable argument had followed this demand, but even Mycroft couldn’t deny how much better Sherlock’s game was when John was with him. Playing to brotherly instinct and tempting him with the promise of closing the case within 24 hours, Sherlock won him over and Mycroft had,
John paid the driver and hurried inside. The bell clinked as the door swung open, and he planted himself at the nearest barstool, dropping his bag beside him.
Sherlock was quiet behind him, though John could feel his stare prickling the back of his neck. He didn’t turn around, and waited with his breath coming in shallow bursts as he rummaged around the cabinet.
“I’ll give you a moment,” Dr. Moore said, nodding, and swept out of the room, closing the door behind him.
“No?” John quirked an eyebrow and leaned forward to rest on his elbows, his lips hovering just centimeters from Sherlock’s. “You mean you don’t know how much I wanted to snog you senseless in that cab earlier? Or back at Orlova’s flat, mobsters be damned?” John’s eyes had fallen half closed, his breath ghosting over Sherlock’s lips but still not making contact, that endearing half-smirk still pulling at his plump lips. “You don’t know that when I saw you again at the station, looking like the most beautiful sight for sore eyes, that I wanted to push you up onto that table and have my way with you right then and there?”
He’d opened his eyes, to see John’s just inches from his face, as bright and beautiful as they’d ever been, even red-rimmed and glistening. As Sherlock spoke, a powerful sort of determination passed through them, followed by a soft, gentle look that seemed to make Sherlock’s heart leap back to life out of the dust.
It was drizzling outside the windows – not the most festive Christmas Eve weather, but Sherlock didn’t care just now. He made his way into the sitting room, where John was standing there looking gorgeous in a grey button-up and dark jacket.
Sherlock’s chest was broad and strong. His arms and shoulders were pleasantly muscled. He was more solid than John had imagined him being, more broad planes and hard lines, but somehow softer, too. There was a gentleness to his movements, to his breath and the warm feeling of his palm against John’s, that no amount of imagining could have prepared him for.
“Certainly. In fact,” Sherlock checked his watch. 11:30 pm. Still 7:30 in Britain, although, there would be
“Yes, but the files are nowhere to be found, so now we’ll have to launch a full-scale investigation to find whatever he’s got, which is precisely what I was hoping to avoid by involving you.”
“It’s over now, John. We’re safe.” Sherlock slid his hand up to stroke through John’s hair, and John leaned back into the touch, his eyes closed as if savouring it. “We’re here, we’re alone.” Sherlock quirked his mouth up in a shy smile. “Show me now.”
talk, funnily enough. Sometimes John would begin it, sometimes Sherlock would, his voice trickling in from wherever he was working. When he did, he seemed to be talking to himself as much as to John, but that was alright. John interjected with whatever thoughts were crossing his mind at the moment, and the rest of the time, just listened. He knew how nice it felt just to have someone listen; Sherlock was excellent at it.
He suddenly seemed to notice the hush that had fallen over the room, and straightened up, his eyes darting around until they landed on John – and froze.
in everything. He hadn’t expected him to transform so fully into the pillar of strength John needed, without a care for himself. John knew Sherlock worried about him, knew how scared he’d been after it had happened and it wasn’t clear that John would make it out alive, but Sherlock had seemingly tucked that away now, focusing only on what John needed and how he could make this as easy as possible for him.
Sherlock drew in a deep gasp, wiped at his cheeks; he tilted his head back to stop the rest of the tears. It took a couple of shaking breaths, but eventually he managed it. His eyes were dry.
“There will never be a need,” Sherlock muttered along with Westley. The film was one of his favourites. Dad’s, too.
He got up out of his chair and went to the kitchen to rinse out his mug. What would he do for the rest of the day, he wondered vaguely. There were no cases to solve, and Mrs. Hudson had gone to brunch with her sister. The silence in the flat was becoming so dense it could smother him.
“Hey.” John stepped away from the counter a little bit. “All they have is a single – no double rooms.”
He sighed once, trying to convey his incredible gratitude without words, and turned back to tug the ribbon off of the box. He pulled the lid off and resting inside, on the navy satin lining, was a shining pocket watch, with a smooth silver case embossed all along the edges with swirling ornamental designs.
“Fantastic.” John’s voice was low, still cautious, but simmering with unrestrained fondness just below the surface. “Where do we start?”
“You go first.” John craned his neck to check out the inside of the bathroom. “I don’t think we’re both going to fit in there.”
Sherlock slicked his hands with more oil, and smoothed up John’s back. He made slow passes, up and down –
a book – John turned it over – a dark brown, leather-bound volume, with embossed gold lettering emblazoned on the front:
John shifted again and groaned quietly, then with great effort wrinkled his forehead and pulled his eyes open. He looked over at Sherlock, blinked a few times, slowly, then twitched the corner of his mouth up into a pained smile.
John let out a frustrated sigh before giving out his full information to the confused DI, along with the confirmation that yes, he was one of Mycroft’s men. Sherlock stood at a safe distance, deferring as best he could the questions of some bratty junior officer, and trying not to insult every federal investigator in sight.
John paused a moment before tearing his gaze away, and stepped tantalizingly close as he strode past Sherlock and into the conference room. Sherlock took a moment before following him, sipping at his coffee and suppressing a sudden unexpected tide of affection at the taste. Black, two sugars. Obviously. John always got it right.
“Come on, you old dandy,” John chuckled, pushing Sherlock forward. Sherlock gave an exaggerated huff of annoyance, but obeyed. They still had their massive list to get through, after all.
Sherlock felt John’s soft, quiet smile against his lips, felt John’s eyelashes flutter whisper-light against his cheek. A jolt of pleasure shot up Sherlock’s spine as John’s third finger breached him, slowly, steadily, and Sherlock couldn’t help but cry out, loudly, and John dove forward to capture his lips, muffling the sound with a kiss.
Sam’s eyes were downcast, avoiding John. Avoiding everyone. John felt a pang that was more shame than grief, and the guilt that flooded in in its wake didn’t surprise him one bit.
“Oh, hello John,” he said, sounding surprised, but pleasantly so. He had a stack of papers under his arm.
John’s smile split all the way across his face as he flung himself at Sherlock, the snow whipping in a flourish about their ankles as Sherlock lifted him off his feet and whirled him around.
It was gentle and innocent, and he pulled back quickly. John’s skin immediately felt cold again. But Sherlock wasn’t moving away, and John couldn’t help that his eyes had fallen closed, and that he was being drawn in…
John chuckled softly, even though that wasn’t what he’d meant. He’d meant that he hadn’t expected Sherlock to be so…
He looked out through the French doors. Sherlock was wearing his usual posh attire, except he also had on massive gardening gloves and had his shirt open a few extra buttons. John had done his best not to make his staring too obvious, but Sherlock seemed to be completely focused on the task at hand and wouldn’t have noticed either way.
The dread evaporated from Sherlock instantly, and he felt a little guilty for how light he suddenly felt. But then again, John didn’t look especially upset about it, either.
His body ached with exhaustion, but he couldn’t close his eyes. He couldn’t just turn his back on this right now, this moment that might end up mattering someday, that might be one of the few he could cling onto when there were no more left. Because Sherlock was breathing easy beside him, his thin outline rising and falling with each shallow inhale, and John could feel him and watch him and reach out for him, and in however many months or years John knew he would gladly give everything he had for that meager privilege. For this, right now, this tiny nothing that by all accounts he should be sleeping through.
Sherlock knew his dad wanted to talk. He was doing that thing where he kept clearing his throat for too long, and a lot louder than he normally did. Dad didn’t know he did this, because Sherlock hadn’t told him. Like Mycroft had said, people were very strange about the things they didn’t want to know about themselves.
“Look, I’ve got to go. I’ve got to…” he stammered a bit, scanning through his mind. “…see a client. Case. Very important.” He turned away, his eyes downcast. “You can let yourself out, can’t you?”
“Fine. Okay.” Sherlock twisted his face into something he hoped was acceptable. It felt like a grimace. “Absolutely.”
Mycroft had already gone off down the adjoining hall to collect his things from his office. Sherlock gave quick hellos to everyone standing ready, then went right on through the door across the way.
Sherlock stood up, and the audience roared louder than ever before. He stepped in front of Jonathan’s desk, obscuring the camera’s view, and mimed unbuckling his trousers.
“Okay, I’ll have a look.” His words were coming out far too quickly, tripping over each other. “But honestly, I think I deleted it, so don’t get any hopes up. Must go.”
“Hey, kids,” he said, softer than before. “Here’s an important message, from Sherlock Holmes, to you.” He paused, schooled his face into something very serious, then said, quite deliberately. “Don’t…buy…drugs.”
This chapter is (loosely) based on the story in the film with Colin (Kris Marshall), Tony (Abdul Salis) and the American girls. Again, with some important changes.
“Hurry up, big boy!” came Mary’s voice from inside the bedroom. “I’m naked and I want you at least twice before John gets home!”
“Stay here for a bit.” John muttered. His eyes were sliding closed, and he burrowed himself still closer into Sherlock, not willing to leave just yet. He knew he shouldn’t, he’d just woken up after all, but the pain in his side was fading fast now, and Sherlock was so
Sherlock stood and hugged Mrs. Hudson one last time. Molly and Lestrade had gone home to the children soon after they’d gotten the news, promising to be back as soon as they could the next morning, and Mycroft had taken his leave soon after to return to the investigation (quietly passing the receptionist on his way out to make sure everything was in order). Mrs. Hudson, though, had insisted on staying with Sherlock until they let him in to see John, and had chatted cheerfully the whole time while the driver Mycroft had sent for her waited out in the car park.
“You know I love Christmas, I always will. My mind’s made up, the way that I feel. There’s no beginning, there’ll be no end. ‘Cause on Christmas, you can depend!”
He’d tried to say it with a modicum of a smile in his voice, a little self-deprecating humour, but Mike was looking shocked.
“Yeah, uh –” John started, then stopped. They probably didn’t have any of his usual beers here. He scanned the taps. No, they didn’t. He picked the first one he saw. “I’ll have a Budweiser, please.”
“And anyway, it’s hardly my concern anymore.” Sherlock looked over at John, whose face lined with laughter made him look ten years younger.
“Which one?” John’s voice was barely detectable, just the smallest whisper of breath against Sherlock’s neck. Still, Sherlock felt the sensation in his entire body, firing through his neurons like electricity. He suppressed a shiver, and tried
laugh, breathless and rasping. “Please, don’t patronize me. You’ve got a pack of high-tar cigarettes in your pocket. You’re prepared for the worst.”
The relentless beeping pounded like a drum against Sherlock’s temple, crashing through his fog-filled brain. Still, he welcomed the pain it brought, cherished it, because if that torturous sound were to stop…
John extracted his hand from between them, wiped it off on the nearest sheet corner and tossed it away, then slid his arms up to hold Sherlock tight around the shoulders.
“Mr. Holmes!” the DI called to him, weariness evident in his voice. “We just need final confirmation from you so we can attest to Dr. Watson’s account.”
Sherlock leaned in his chair to look towards John through the glass, only to feel his stomach drop when he saw him hunched over in his seat, looking anxious. Sherlock bit his lip; he’d been trying to play along with Mike’s inevitable jibes and criticisms, but clearly John thought he shouldn’t have said that.
Forty-five minutes later, and Sherlock was sprawled out half-upside down over the sofa, focusing sharply. On the television screen, Westley was leaning over Buttercup, saying the familiar lines.
There was a childlike brilliance in his expression, and it tugged at Sherlock’s chest. It always did.
John sighed gratefully, turning into Sherlock’s touch. It was warm and firm, but John thought he detected the same hint of anxiety that he’d felt yesterday, the same that he’d seen in Sherlock’s eyes that morning.
“Yeah, well.” Sherlock looked back down at his knees, his back hunched. “She’d have liked John, though. It’s not his fault.”
“…perfect.” Sherlock’s voice was as light as the whisper of his thumb stroking over his cheek. “You’re perfect.”
Sherlock exhaled raggedly but no longer painfully. He nodded, and wiped again at the tears that wouldn’t stop falling. “Thank you, doctor.”
he was. Sherlock smiled at the contact, picked up a fresh bandage and tore open the plastic wrapping.
He tossed around in his covers for a while longer, then gave up. He got up and pulled his dressing gown over his pajamas. Dad would still be awake.
,” John laughed, then fought to suppress a groan as the movement expanded his chest at the wound. “Just,” he gritted his teeth slightly, tried to reign in the pain. “I guess I didn’t expect you to be so good at it.” He shook his head a bit. “Silly of me.”
“So, if you believe in Father Christmas, children.” Sherlock leaned into the microphone and began to speak in an exaggerated, patronizing voice. “Like your Uncle Sherlock does: buy my festering turd of a record.”
“Sorry, I was hoping to be back before you woke up.” Sherlock came forward to sit on the edge of the bed, supporting John as he pushed himself up to sitting.
Sherlock blinked at his father for a second, then shook his head. “Whatever. There’s this big Christmas concert at the end of term, and John’s in it. And I thought, if I was in the band, and played absolutely
touches. His spine tingled with an ever-climbing tide of arousal, Sherlock’s fingers sending hot sparks out along his every nerve.
John, Sherlock was sure, had had lofty hopes of resurrecting Sherlock’s career from the flaming mess he’d driven it to, when he’d signed on to be his manager five years ago. But it was a foolish effort – gone were Sherlock’s days of dynamic, exciting tunes and lavish tours, and there just wasn’t much to be sold in what was left. It was pathetic, really, sitting here with his grey-streaked hair and creaky joints and his bright shirt that might have been fashionable back in his heyday, hoping at long last for that elusive comeback. But still, John had lasted longer than any other manager Sherlock had ever had, and part of him, Sherlock knew, still believed in him. Sherlock was grateful for that.
Whatever Mycroft said, it made Sherlock’s eyes light up and a slow grin curl into his lips like a stretching cat, rested and ready to pounce. He listened for a few more minutes, then hung up without saying a word.
John says, “Take off your clothes,” and Sherlock shrugs back his shoulders to let his coat fall to the ground without hesitation.
Quickly, Sherlock caught up and fell into step beside John. They walked down a short hallway that emptied into a sunken living room. There was an open fireplace along the west wall, unlit. A pair of rust-red couches sat across from each other at a comfortable distance from the hearth—a stained, wooden coffee table sat between them. The tongue-and-groove walls were lined with bookshelves, and in the opposite corner from the fireplace was an armchair, a lamp, and a small end table bearing an empty mug. The carpets were a deep brown. The dark colors made the space seem small and, Sherlock supposed, cozy. It felt more like something John would like than Mycroft.
He left before Sherlock could answer, and Sherlock almost put it all on, glitter included, just to be petty. Then again, while John calling him childish could be funny, Mycroft doing it was unbearable, so he put on his usual suit instead.
Sherlock pushed the door open, and the sounds that had been nothing more than a thump outside rushed out to swallow John whole. The current song was something hip-hopish that John didn’t recognize, turned up loud enough to thrum just beneath his skin, but not so loud that he couldn’t hear the chatter of people as he and Sherlock descended the stairs and began to weave through the dance floor. Most of the people John saw were dressed up for their night out, fancy dresses and suits and too-tight jeans, and even a few other glitter-dusted faces (though, he biasly though, not so artfully applied as Sherlock), but there were also a few people dressed more plainly, sprawled with a drink across couches and chairs placed in a sunken section of the room, or leaning against the bar, and not everyone was model-level gorgeous. It made John feel a little less self-conscious, with his plain face and even plainer clothes.
John nodded, grasping onto the hope of improvement the way Lestrade was still gripping his shoulder. “I don’t know what scares me more,” John admitted. “The fact that he’s capable of that sort of darkness… or the fact that in the end, it doesn’t mean anything because I won’t leave.” He sighed, letting his chin fall to rest against his chest for a moment. “Who knows what the drugs did to him. Or maybe he just…”
“Ah.” John’s jaw flexed slightly, as it always did when Sherlock’s drug habit was mentioned. “Well, you’ve got the skin tone for it.”
The same driver who had brought them to the house picked John and Sherlock up, and informed them that Mycroft had gone ahead and would meet them inside. With traffic, it took almost two hours to get there, and Sherlock was a tightly-wound bundle of energy when the car finally pulled over. He leaped out and immediately swept inside, leaving John to catch up with him.
The next five hours passed in something of an amusing blur. John had gone through a burst of energy and they had a great time deducing more passengers, but by the time they landed in the Los Angeles International Airport John was back to nodding off in his seat, though he was much more conscious when Sherlock prodded him up and off the plane this time. Sherlock got him outside and into a car Mycroft had sent for them with promises that he could sleep as soon as they got to the hotel.
Stomping to the couch, Sherlock dropped onto it and picked up the cup. One sniff told him it was chamomile, and he put it right back down on the table.
This was why Chloe liked him so much, weirdness and all. Because damn if he didn’t make her laugh and forget, if only for a few minutes, about the mutilated body they’d left only half an hour ago.
“I don’t know.” John crossed his arms and leaned back against the wall, tipping his head back to stare up at the dark ceiling. “We did call Mycroft a queen in Buckingham.”
“I could guess that just from his face,” John giggled, nudging Sherlock with his shoulder. “Bet you a fiver he’s running for the toilet in two minutes.”
Mycroft gazed at him over the rim of his cup, soft and disappointed, and Sherlock hated himself but he looked away. The (tiny) part of him that still hero-worshipped his older brother curled up and attempted to spontaneously die.
No matter how many times Chloe saw the truly horrific, it never got any easier. A cliché, sure, but no less true. Gunshot wounds, strangulation, stabbings—crimes of passion, those were awful, but at least she could understand them.
Sherlock shoved his plate away (he’d eaten one piece of toast and half his eggs, that should appease John). He said nothing because, as usual, he was having a frustratingly hard time deducing his brother’s motives. A quick dig did give him one nugget that he immediately hoarded with all the greed of a dragon.
John – exiting the lift and looking more radiant, Sherlock was sure, than he’d ever been. He was wearing his usual Haversack jacket and carrying two coffees, and at the sight of Sherlock his face lit up in a smile that seemed to make everything around him disappear.
Something was pushing up Sherlock’s throat again, threatening to spill out and ruin everything, ruin this moment, ruin the composure he had so diligently kept up. Wetness was welling up behind his eyes, more powerfully than ever before, and Sherlock screwed his eyes more tightly shut, knowing it was just a matter of time before it all burst out.
Sherlock turned, but John had already caught up with him. He placed a tentative hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, pulled him to face him. John came right up close, then paused, panting. There couldn’t have been more than a foot of space between them
Something had changed in his expression – the lines of his brow had turned hard, and his lips were pursed in a thin line.
Sherlock grabbed at the material and pushed them all the way off, throwing them to the side and lowering himself back over John. “I’m here,” he murmured, softly, deeply, and he cradled John’s face in one hand as he kissed him, pouring all of himself from his lips into John’s.
John was silent for a moment behind him – then, just as Sherlock’s heart was about to beat soundly through his ribs, he gave a small chuckle.
“Why?” Mycroft asked. His voice betrayed just the barest amount of suspicion. “Did you want him, specifically?”
John gave a contented sigh – he couldn’t move much, but it felt nice. Sherlock’s length slid slowly up and down, then faster, as his hips started to piston forward more erratically and he lost himself to the feeling.
He was kissing him again, and this time Sherlock sank into it. The CD player fell to the ground with a crash as Sherlock raised his arms and pulled John closer by his shoulders. He parted his lips with a soft gasp that made John moan as he slipped his tongue past them, and Sherlock was falling, falling into sensation, into warmth, into the feeling of
“Right,” he said. “Uh – buongiorno…” he made a wild gesture with his hand, unsure of what he was even trying to communicate. “Molto bueno…”
“You’re sure you don’t mind me going without you?” he asked again, moving toward her to grab his wallet from the nightstand.
The rain had stopped when they got back to Baker Street, and Sherlock shook the last of the dampness from his shoes as he followed John upstairs. John slipped out of his coat and sighed happily as he wandered into the sitting room, perfectly at ease. Sherlock felt completely empty.
Sherlock’s heart kicked up. Even though he’d been expecting it, planned for it even, the excitement that swelled up in him at the sight of the little box was sudden and exhilarating.
He pulled back just a bit, his arms on Sherlock’s shoulders, Sherlock’s brilliant, infectious joy still glowing out of him like the sun, and no sooner had everything fallen into place in John’s mind than the words came tumbling out of his mouth.
“Bloody 1967. Just over fifty years ago. At least it hasn’t been punishable by death since 1861, although Mr. Turing might beg to differ on that point.”
John doesn’t let him drive home from the mall and instead delights in tormenting him with the vibrator as he squirms in the passenger seat. Somehow the plug’s been connected to the car’s Bluetooth and John is controlling it from the buttons on the steering wheel. The convertible’s top is down, and Sherlock’s trying hard not to make embarrassing faces as John turns the vibrator up, then down, then up, then off, allowing him to recover a bit before the next round, but never long enough to lose his erection. He moans with pleasure and grips the edges of his seat with white knuckles as his prostate is massaged over and over and he slides down, grinding his ass into the leather.
John let the amusing thought cheer him up a bit as he pushed his way through the line cooks at their stoves and wound his way to the break area. Sherlock was sitting at a table by himself, scrolling through his phone, his white uniform unbuttoned slightly to expose the collar of a dark t-shirt.
“No, I put them off until tomorrow,” Sherlock reassured him. He stepped forward and cupped John’s jaw with a steady hand. “You need to rest now, I think.”
Sherlock looks deeply into the eyes of the survivor in front of him and stands up a little straighter. He nods and says, “I do. Thank you.”
Mycroft had dropped into the armchair, mouth open. His thin hair hung in strings over his forehead where he had clutched at it. He looked at Sherlock with despair, guilt, and horror, but no accusation. Sherlock knew that whatever his faults, his brother also understood his decision.
John grins and crosses the room to stand before Sherlock with his arms crossed. “It’s a kilt. I told you people go all out today.”
The brothers stared at one another as Moriarty watched with interest. Then Mycroft took a deep breath.
change it. Captain Sherlock Stillwell was a famous pirate from the early eighteenth century.  I went through a pirate phase as a kid, and he was one of my favourites. Sherlock Holmes just sounds better than William Holmes. Don’t you think? More memorable, more dramatic. And I like to be dramatic.”
There were two doors on the landing. One had a window, and through it, John could see another corridor. The other was solid. Who knew what might be on the other side.
“Just after you saw me last, down in the bunker, I was drugged and woke up in my apartment a day later. It took us almost twenty-four hours to dig up the fact that a shell company owned by a series of shell companies and ultimately controlled by Jim Moriarty had purchased an uninhabited private island off the coast of Maine a month ago. The owner was the estate of a wealthy businessman who had built a bunker and an airstrip there during the cold war. It all fit. And you know the rest. Most of it anyway.”
His eyes immediately find John, seated on the sofa with a drink in his hand. He’s wearing khakis with a navy polo shirt, and his feet are bare, as usual. His face splits in a broad smile when he sees Sherlock.
He pulls the thin blanket further up over his shoulders and opens his eyes just a little. A discolored ceiling with a jagged crack is a few feet above.
Sherlock grabs the top rail of the headboard with both hands as John’s finger slides in and out of him. It feels good, easy so far. After a minute or so, John slides in a second finger and leaves it there.
Stamford laughs out loud. “If John says you’re going, you’re gonna go, believe me. He said you’d probably enjoy working in one of the labs, that you’re a budding chemist.”
Sherlock feels a little chuckle escape his throat. He leans his head back onto the sofa and looks up at John, smiling.
“The sun sets in the west. If we were on the east coast, the sun would set over the trees, not the ocean,” Sherlock said.
John sighed, and Sherlock could tell he was going to cave. John turned to Dr Adler. “Listen. I’m a doctor. I’ll stay with him. I’ll keep him hydrated, dress his fingers, make sure he takes his meds, monitor his urine. His flat is ten minutes away. If anything goes wrong, I’ll bring him back.”
They had made love the night before—twice, and there is no pressure or expectation for sex now. Not that Sherlock wouldn’t be up for it. He is still a teenager, after all. John pulls him into an embrace, and they lie nose to nose. John’s breath is stale, but Sherlock doesn’t mind.
And he was gay. And gorgeous. Much taller than John, whip-thin, and with beautiful eyes. Those eyes. God, they reminded him of Will.
. Opening it, he finds a date of January 1860. It really is old! When he flips through the pages, the distinctive smell of old paper wafts up. He flips through again and inhales the scent with pleasure. He’s read this book before; the school library had a copy that he had checked out twice. But now he owns his very own antique copy. From his mom. Although he’s not sure how it's supposed to help him go to college or find himself. Or whatever.
Martha lay on the floor several feet away, curled up in a fetal position and groaning dramatically—maybe a little too dramatically.
“Yes, love. With flying colors. Like I said, I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself. You can try not being so defensive next time, but overall? Well done, you.”
“Prove it,” Sherlock challenges with a wicked grin. He’s surprised how much he’s turned on by seeing John this way. He’s normally so professionally dressed and conservative, and the unexpected change is thrilling,
is all he has time to think before John is peppering him and he’s struggling to keep from trying to escape by wriggling
“It’s all over now. All done, and you were so good, Sherlock. Punishment is done, and you’re all forgiven now. We start over. The board is clean.” He helps Sherlock stand up and pulls him in close. He holds him, one hand on the back of his head and the other rubbing his back. He keeps up the comforting words, hugging and gentling him until the crying fades away. He pulls away and wipes his tears with the bandana that Sherlock had given him, it seemed like weeks ago. “You all right?”
Moriarty put his hands on his hips and smiled cheerfully as he surveyed the room. “Good morning, everyone. I hope you slept well. I know it isn’t the Ritz, but as your fellow passengers would tell you—if they were alive anyway, it could be worse.” He smiled as if he were waiting for them to laugh at his morbid joke.
“I don’t know,” admits Sherlock. “Nervous. No, not nervous exactly. More like excited. It feels like Christmas. Or at least what Christmas used to feel like when I was a little kid.”
“Yeah, you’re right. Bloody hell, I’m the doctor, and I should have suggested it,” he said finally, lying down close to Sherlock and sliding under the blanket. He stayed still for a few moments and then turned onto his side, pressing the length of his body to Sherlock’s and carefully draping an arm over his stomach. “That hurt?”
Sherlock went about making breakfast for John, a rare occurrence indeed. He filled the electric kettle and switched it on, popped two slices of bread in the toaster, and opened the new jar of blackberry jam that they had bought at a farmers’ market on a recent trip to the country. All the while, he was acutely aware of the lace barely holding his semi-hard cock and bollocks and riding up between his arse cheeks so that he was constantly reaching back and extracting it. To his surprise, he found that he enjoyed making tea and toast for John. It wasn’t as if Sherlock was a complete wanker and never did anything for John, but even after all this time together, Sherlock still often acted like an entitled child, and if the score were being kept, it would show that he didn’t do anywhere near his share of the domestic chores. John wasn’t keeping score though. They each accepted the other as they were, quirks, and imperfections included. It all evened out in the end.
, Sherlock thought frantically as Moriarty pulled out a tile. “Number four!” he announced dramatically.
He gives his body a final once-over in his bedroom mirror and wonders again what John sees, but he’s as ready as he’ll ever be. He debates which shirt to put on, but decides on the purple, of course, and then ties the narrow black tie he wore to his mom’s funeral. Myc taught him how to tie it that morning, and he’s surprised he still remembers. It was too long for him then. A fleeting thought is all he allows himself
“Excellent! I’m sure you must be thirsty. We have lemonade, iced tea, and some ginger ale punch. Which would you like?”
He pulls away and looks into John’s eyes, questioning silently. John gives the slightest nod, and Sherlock starts sliding down John’s body, his hands and lips exploring John’s muscled chest, biceps and shoulders. On his left shoulder, Sherlock’s fingers encounter a knot of twisted flesh, and they stop there momentarily.
“You probably hated me too. That’s part of my responsibility to you, especially since I’ve promised to care for you. Tell me self-control and discipline aren’t things you need to work on.”
“No, god, no, calm down. Martin didn’t make it, sweet boy,” John says, taking Sherlock’s face in his hands. “He did give me your measurements, but I didn’t tell him why. Don’t worry. Come, look at yourself.”
John squeezes his hand reassuringly and fills the uncomfortable silence. “I know Sherlock’s mum would be proud of him, just like you are. I’m proud of him too. Things have been tough all around, for both of you. But it looks like you are getting your shit together. You know Sherlock will be applying to university in London.”
“He’ll think about it,” John says, sliding his hand down from Sherlock’s shoulder and taking his hand. Sherlock raises his eyebrow and gives him a sidelong glance. This is John’s boss. Technically, Sherlock is still a student at OSU, although his last class is next week. He worries that John might be taking a risk by being so open about their relationship. John conveys that everything is fine with a subtle shift of his features that Sherlock can read instantly. It’s not just his keen observation skills that allow him to read John’s meaning. It’s that he knows John’s face, his eyes, his hands, almost like they are his own. The intimacy between them has grown so quickly and it’s a wholly new experience for him. The wonder of it still hasn’t worn off. Maybe it never would. He smiles at Dr. Whitney. “Thank you, but I’m not sure what’s next for me. College, I hope.”
“Remember, don’t sell yourself short," John says. "You’re stronger than you think. But maybe I can help with the cigarettes. How long have you been smoking? And how many a day?”
both of us, together. It requires a fair amount of courage on your part. You’ll be in a strange country, away from everything you’re familiar with.”
“Good boy,” John says after a short time. “Now, I’m going to put the plug in you.” The fingers withdraw and are replaced with the tip of the plug. “Relax,” John says as he presses it in slowly. Sherlock takes in a deep breath as the widest part enters him and lets it out as it slips into place. An “oh” escapes his lips when John grasps the base and wiggles it. His dick is getting seriously hard now.
Sherlock hums in appreciation. He feels his cock harden against his belly as John continues to massage him. Then John shifts and covers Sherlock with his body, his mouth at Sherlock’s ear.
“Don’t worry, not tonight,” John says, but he rests the tip of the crop under Sherlock’s chin. “Remember the day we met? What I said to you? Tell me.”
sees the back of a frame. He turns it over carefully, and it isn’t a painting after all. It’s a periodic table, but not like any he’s ever seen before. The names of the elements are printed in bright red, blue, and yellow. The atomic numbers and weights are depicted in dots and bars, in a way that makes a lot of sense but is still beautiful and engaging. It’s a piece of art. Even if you weren’t interested in chemistry at all, it would draw you in for a closer look. His mom didn’t understand his fascination with the periodic table. He had taped one to the wall of his bedroom, just a single page torn out of a discarded textbook when he was in elementary school, and he spent many nights falling asleep while looking at it. He would talk to her about elements and electrons and reactive nonmetals, and he knew she didn't understand a single word, but she always pretended to be interested, asking questions and repeating his answers.  And, for a few years, his birthday and Christmas presents always included a new chemistry set. He loved them, but it meant even more that she took him seriously.
on top of his backpack, open to page 120, only two-thirds of the way through. He picks it up silently, holds it out in Sherlock’s direction, and tilts his head as if he’s waiting for an explanation.
“Yeah, well, I haven’t decided. Seems kind of pointless,” Sherlock says, unable to say what he feels, that mom would have made him go, that he wants his dad to see him receive his diploma.
John arrives at five thirty and orders a bottle of red. It’s important to stake out the territory, fill up the space. He sips from his glass slowly, reviewing and savoring his plan for the evening. Once he confirms that the boy knows his mind, it’s not that complicated: he’s as good as in his pocket already. John chuckles. He wouldn’t know what hit him. At first.
When they got home, John practically dragged Sherlock up the stairs, ordered him to undress, get on his hands and knees on the bed, and then fucked him hard without preamble. Sherlock shuddered each time Johns's cock passed over his prostate. His own neglected penis bobbed with each thrust and threatened to explode. He absolutely loved John this way, ruthless and insatiable. It made him feel like an object, his brain for once, secondary. It was a delicious respite from that other life that he lived, and he was enjoying it immensely. To keep from climaxing, Sherlock recited, one-by-one, each type of tobacco ash he had catalogued.
As he approaches his bike, he looks up and freezes. Giddy anticipation is instantly replaced by a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. Bright pink streamers hang from the handlebars of his bike, the kind favored by ten-year-old girls. Pink, purple, and yellow plastic butterflies, dozens of them, are attached to his spokes. And, hanging behind the seat, is a handmade cardboard license plate with the word “FAG” written in bold black marker.
“Exactly. And I’m thinking that since we sort of began the renegotiation this morning, we should consider today ‘red day’. You’ve expressed your feelings about your need for impact, and now I
John laughs softly. “I don’t blame you, I’m just that sexy.” He kisses Sherlock’s forehead. “You’ve had to wait all night. I had you at Angelo’s, remember? I’m surprised you lasted as long as you did. You were fantastic. I—”
“Don’t. We’re almost to the hospital. We can talk later.” John takes Sherlock’s hand in both of his and presses it to his lips. Sherlock can see that there are tears in his eyes.
Sherlock wore his loosest jeans to work but still had an awkward gait that he was sure everyone noticed. The pain on his skin was only part of it. There was also the soreness left by John’s cock, not all that unpleasant reminder of what happened last night, of how it felt to ride him.
“You smell like smoke, and you’ll probably want to brush your teeth, so go clean yourself up. You’ll find everything you need in the guest bathroom. And don't you dare put these clothes back on.” Sherlock blushes. "There's a dressing gown," John says. “I’ll be waiting for you. Go on.” He kisses Sherlock’s forehead, slides his thumb over his plush bottom lip, and pushes him back up to sitting.
. He’s chosen to make the Struggle Against Self the theme of his paper. After reading through the essay one last time, and finally being happy with it, he presses the send key, emailing it to his professor.
John’s lips tickle his ear and Sherlock pulls back even as his body relaxes against his lover in Pavlovian response to the words that never fail to turn him into jello. John and Annie laugh and, although it is a warm and affectionate laughter, Sherlock wishes anyway, for the millionth time, that he didn’t blush so easily, and drops his head to hide it.
“Thank you,” he said curtly. “I couldn’t think with all of your yakking. I recommend that you listen to Jo—That man. He’s a soldier. If you have any chance of getting out of here alive, it’s with him—even though he’s an idiot.”
The note to Myc is harder. He stares at the blank paper and starts the letter several times, crumpling each attempt and tossing it in the trash. Finally, he’s satisfied that he has the proper balance of insult and apology.
He is frozen in place. He doesn’t have any idea what is happening but knows that whatever it is is bad. His mind races, trying to think of what he might have done. Maybe it’s his dad. Has something happened to his dad?
“For crazy people?” He laughs. “I was pretty crazy at the time. All of us are in our own way. But therapy helps. And sometimes it can save your life.”
Sherlock drops his eyes and recites again. “I will be available by phone at all times. If I am unable to answer, I must call as soon as possible.”
“I have some pull there and they don’t know about the drug issues. You passed the background check, so you must not have had any arrests.”
“I hope you didn’t think I’d forget about your little temper tantrum,” he said, gesturing at his shoe where Sherlock’s spit still shone. “Uh! So vulgar! I’d like you to take care of that. I’d like you to get on your hands and knees and lick it off. Now.”
John started with his head. Running his fingers gently through the matted hair, he searched for broken skin. Sherlock flinched when they encountered a lump.
Sherlock’s eyes go a little wide, and he just shrugs. “If you’re OK with having your picture taken with me…”
“So, um, if you don’t hate me enough already...” George tries for a joking tone, but it falls flat, and he plows on. “After your mother died, I was in really bad shape. I guess you remember. Your aunt and uncle came to stay with us for a while, and Aunt Melanie said I wasn’t ever gonna pull myself together if we didn’t try to move on, so they packed up a lot of your mother’s stuff and put it in the attic, just so I didn’t have to...because I couldn’t…”
Sherlock was peering around the partition. He looked better. Colour had returned to his cheeks, and his breathing was normal.
“He’s my favorite,” Wiggy says. “And Black Widow too...she could save me any day. Damn, she’s hot! I don’t like Dr. Strange so much. English dude plays him—Benedict Cummerbunch or something. They shoulda cast an American. His accent is shit.” Wiggy shakes his head ruefully as if the actor’s imperfect accent were a tragedy and downs the remainder of his beer.
“You are damn right I'm angry," John said, as quietly as he could, when what he wanted to do was shout. "You flirted with another man.
Brainy sends thanks to @AlterEgoNYC for the push-ups competition inspiration. Totally unfair, but I loved it anyway.
He’s so tired, so unbelievably tired, but he doesn’t think he’ll be able to sleep. Not without help and he’ll need to be at 100% to deal with the situation he’ll face in the morning. He pours himself a drink and carries it to the bathroom. Looking in the mirror, he sees bloodshot eyes with bags underneath. He looks older than his thirty-three years. After retrieving a bottle of sleeping pills from the medicine cabinet and swallowing two, he drains his glass.
work at the hospital! We can find him, maybe set him up! Even if Pete can’t get the other guy—and, by the way, how do we even know it’s a guy? to talk, now we have this angle to chase. And maybe there is no mysterious Mark Twain. Hell, maybe there’s only one person. It’s possible that the supplier and the courier are one and the same. Ahh, it's all making sense! He’s a custodian and would have keys to the lockers. He has access. We can get Pete to ID him!” Sherlock is standing now and gesturing wildly, flushed with excitement.
Illegal? Sherlock is so intrigued that he wastes no time ripping open the box and lifting out...a human skull. A real human skull. It is—or belonged to, an adult, and it’s in excellent shape. Sherlock holds it up and peers into the empty eye sockets as the skull grins at him. This is the coolest thing Sherlock has ever owned, depending on what’s in the rest of the packages. A real skull! He notices a slip of paper in the box and picks it up.
“You’re welcome. I’m very proud of you, you know. You’re stretching your boundaries every day and it’s beautiful to watch. And you are gorgeous. She was right. You could model. But you’re all mine. Aren’t you?”
JW:    LOL. Of course you did. I’m surprised it took so long. What exactly were you thinking about when “it just happened”?
John looked up to see the bulky man, the one with a crewcut, looking down at him. “Now,” the man growled.
“Then it would be polite to say thank you for the spanking.” The word makes Sherlock squirm until the pain freezes him.
Sherlock reaches down and grasps his neglected cock. It doesn’t take long. John has increased his pace, and Sherlock matches it, twisting and pulling himself, now oblivious to anyone who might be watching from below. He feels it building, coiling in his groin. A crescendo.
John lets loose with a barrage of four, and Sherlock cheats a little. “Seven, eight, nine, ten, thank you, Sir.” Tears prick his eyes, but he can’t remember why he should be concerned about it. The reason seems such a long way away. He’s drifting on a wave that subsumes the pain into heat and pressure—a pressure on his flesh that lifts the pressure on his mind. Two more strokes and the tally and his conscience will be clear. He’s eager for them now and they come.
Sherlock tries on the shirts, and John picks out two white ones, a purple in a shade lighter than the one he owns—almost lavender, and a dark and a light blue. He and Martin discuss fittings, ties, and other details, while Sherlock dresses. When he comes out of the dressing room, Martin is alone, waiting for him. He looks at Sherlock, seriously this time, and speaks quietly. “Sherlock, listen to an old man. You know it wasn’t just the Jews that the monster tried to exterminate. He sent a hundred thousand of
He woke to the distinctive sound of a helicopter. He sat up, reaching for the gun reflexively. It sounded close. John looked to the sky, waiting. Soon searchlights appeared to John’s left. They were being hunted. This meant their absence had been discovered.
John ignored it. He had to. The only thing that mattered was getting out of this place and finding help. Sherlock’s suffering had to be disregarded for now. John’s soldier brain was in complete control, and it knew that this was the way it had to be. It was the only way to survive.
Sherlock’s hands tugged gently at John’s shirt, untucking it and undoing the buttons, and there was no more hesitation lurking underneath his fingertips. There was no more wariness in his movements, just a raw intensity of devotion, and John felt it in the way he slowly pushed his shirt off his shoulders with careful movements, the way he held John gently by the waist with one hand as he undid his belt with the other. That same reassurance that had always been there, just now with more heartfelt earnestness than ever, and John poured even more quiet passion into their kisses, his eyes prickling with the realization that even now, even here, Sherlock was going to take care of him.
Sherlock’s lips pressed together for a moment, and John tried not to stare at them, tried not to think.
Sherlock blinked, and then, to his surprise, a smile spread across his face like it hadn’t done in weeks.
It had been a rough crash from the euphoria of the evening, as he’d finally been able to take in all that had happened in the past couple days. That moment in the sitting room that first day, what Magnussen had said and done.
“The essay,” John said, but he was starting to feel a chuckle bubbling up in his own throat too. “It was about his ‘Christmas wish’ or whatever. And I had to tell this mother, with a straight face, how concerned I was that her son had written about how his Christmas wish was to be able to see people’s farts.”
Sherlock’s arms were shaking lightly from holding himself up, his breath coming in quicker with every kiss, and John could feel the mounting tension in his body as powerfully as he could feel it in his own. He felt himself rocking back into Sherlock’s movements with more force now, pulling lower and deeper moans out of Sherlock’s throat. They were close, John could feel it, and his desire to stay in this perfect space forever was quickly shattered by another hot spike of pleasure as Sherlock began to thrust deeper, deeper, and John gasped softly as he made to reach for his cock lying trapped between them and felt Sherlock’s hand covering his, stopping him.
“Electromagnetics—specifically, electromagnetic radiation—the waves of the electromagnetic field. You might know them as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. It’s much more complicated than that, obviously.”
He drops his paper in the box at the front of the room and gives a self-satisfied smirk to the young English teacher. Mr. Anderson narrows his eyes as he regards Sherlock.
He wants to run and hide before she gets there, but John saves him. He sticks out his hand to her. Out of the side of his mouth, he growls, “Introduce me, Sherlock.”
He had been planning on it. It’s the only decent one he has. But somehow the request makes him breathe a little faster.
“If you had answered your phone, I would have reminded you of my responsibility to you. What’s my first rule?”
John began unlacing his shoes. “Do you think Mycroft is really dead?” he said, keeping his voice low.
until there are,’ John says. “And we have been in a sort of honeymoon phase, haven’t we? Let’s think about it some more, but it might be something to try out at the very least. Look at it this way. You’d have a guaranteed spanking every week. Maybe that will take some of the edge off for you, my little pain junkie.”
He inhales deeply and is just starting to exhale when he hears the “whoosh” followed by “crack” and then a searing pain on the back of one thigh, and his breath rushes out with a grunt.
His phone rings again. He picks it up angrily, intending to decline it once more but sees it’s from John and accepts the call.
After Myc relates the events of the day as Sherlock had described them, he and John agree to meet at the courthouse first thing in the morning for the arraignment.
“Yes, Si...aaah!” Sherlock cries out as the plug begins to vibrate with intensity. His head falls back against the cushions as his back arches involuntarily. Just as he’s catching his breath, John’s hand closes around him, and there is nothing else; everything fades to blackness and only pleasure remains.
. It takes another half hour for his heart to stop hammering inside his chest, and another half hour to drift to sleep.
John continues ominously, “I promise you when the time comes, I will make sure that the slate has been cleared.”
“Fantastic,” John exclaimed, plunking down into the roomy cushioned seat. There were footrests, a pillow and blanket, and a bottle of sparkling water. Everything to make the nearly seven-hour flight tolerable, if not enjoyable. He looked around the business class cabin. His seat was on the left side of the cabin in the fifth row, the last row in business class. To his right were two businessmen, each reading the
“Like I said. I can’t discuss that,” Mycroft says, smiling, clearly enjoying playing to Sherlock’s suspicions. “But I might be going out of the country soon, to Tajikistan, and since you are leaving for London, this may be my last chance to see you before you go. By the way, how are you feeling about leaving? Having any second thoughts?”
Then a wet coldness on his nipple. John is circling his left nipple with an ice cube while pulling the right into his warm mouth. Sherlock arches his back off the bed and a cry escapes his lips.
Sherlock obeys and feels the towel around his waist being tugged off and watches as John rakes his eyes over his long white body. The crop marks have faded to purple stripes. John gazes at him for another moment then spreads aloe gel along each one. Sherlock hums in appreciation, and his cock stirs just a little. When he’s finished, John gets up to put the gel away and wipe his fingers. He retrieves the plug and lube before climbing onto the bed and kneeling behind him.
“We could try the basic chest harness, but you might have to go down under his ribs to compensate for his lack of boobs.”
John continues. “It’s not a punishment exactly. I think you’ve been on your own for so long that you’ve forgotten what it feels like to have someone worry about you. You’re on my mind all the time, and I want you to remember that. It’s part of the reason I asked you to wear my watch. As a reminder. Today, I’ve got another reminder for you.” John reaches down to the floor and grabs a box that has already been opened. He brings out a small black object that Sherlock can’t identify immediately. It’s about four inches long. One end is elongated and tapered, and the other end is flared. Suddenly, he recognizes what it is. He remembers it from the Google search he did a few weeks ago when studying John’s List. An anal plug.
Sherlock closed his good eye and leaned against the wall of the shower. The hot water felt wonderful, like an embrace, like summer sunshine on your skin after emerging from a cold lake—Lake George in New York, perhaps. Especially if Johnny Watson was by your side, his blue eyes twinkling, his laughter even warmer than the sun, making you feel like you
John regarded Sherlock as he turned over in his mind what he wanted to say. He didn’t know why he hadn’t told Sherlock he’d found the note in the magazine. For some reason, he wanted Sherlock to be the one to bring up their past.
John dipped his fingers into the jar and scooped out a generous dollop of jam. With his eyes locked on Sherlock’s, he spread the jam over himself until his erection looked like a grape ice lolly. He extended his now sticky fingers to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock opened his mouth and enveloped John’s fingers. John closed his eyes. The inside of Sherlock’s mouth was smooth and warm, and he felt a tongue circle his fingertips as Sherlock licked away the jam.
Reaching into John’s lap, he finds the hardness under his jeans and rubs his palm over it. John places his own hand over Sherlock’s and presses it down.
John chokes back another giggle and says, “I expect it is. You’re, what, eighteen? I was always hard when I was eighteen.”
He takes a slow, deep breath in, one-two-three-four, holds it, one-two-three-four, breathes it out for another count of four, and pauses for the same count. He repeats the four-step process, concentrating on drawing the lines of a square in his mind with each count. He sets himself a goal of twenty repetitions. Up, right, down, left, up, right, down, left. At number eight, he feels his shoulders relaxing; at number thirteen, his heart rate slowing down. When he finishes number twenty, his anger has passed, and he is able to think, really think, about why he’s standing here at all.
He can’t help it as tears start to well in his eyes. So much has happened to him in the last few days. Terrible things, and now this wonderful thing, and it is just too much. His breath hitches in his chest as he tries to respond, but nothing comes out but a squeaky sob.
Mycroft hummed again. “Well, anyway. That lightheartedness only lasted a few weeks. Until the accident.”
Soon they were seated in the sitting room. “So, tell me about the case,” Sherlock demanded, hands steepled in front of his face, looking hopeful.
They drop Molly off at her house and drive toward the hospital. Sherlock thinks about how Greg and Martin both seem to know about John and Sherlock and whatever they are. He felt embarrassed at first. Now he has a different thought. John is not ashamed of them. Greg and Martin are good people. Molly and Ms. Hudson
Wanting to get the plug removed as quickly as possible, he hurries through the shower and finds John waiting for him at the side of the bed. He points at the sign on the door of the closet.
“That’s it, it feels good, doesn’t it?” John starts speaking softly to him in between the strokes of his tongue. “The sounds you’re making, Sherlock, do you hear them? I want you to feel good. I can make you feel so good. Let yourself feel it. Relax and let me in.” Sherlock’s knees fall open, giving John more room, and he presses his tongue over the clenching muscle gently, soft but firm, poking inside as the entrance relaxes more and more. Sherlock starts moaning around the crop in his mouth, and John starts up a rhythm until he’s fucking Sherlock with his tongue. When John slides his finger in alongside his tongue, Sherlock raises his hips in an effort to impale himself. John works his finger in and out until he is in up to the knuckle.
Sherlock opens the refrigerator and takes out a beer, hoping it will calm his nerves. They hadn’t talked about him drinking tonight. He’s underage but John usually allows it, as long as he keeps it to one, or occasionally two, drinks. He decides that if John objects, he won’t argue about it, but it’s a party, right?
“That’s right, you’ll wait for me. I get to take my pleasure from you, you gorgeous thing, then I’ll make you feel so good, right?”
Finally, after John made his way up Sherlock’s thigh, he took him into his mouth. When he did, Sherlock made the most deliciously erotic sound John had ever heard. It seemed to rumble out from deep in his chest. It wasn’t a growl or a moan or a whine, but some impossible combination of the three and his whole body trembled. Encouraged, John devoured Sherlock’s cock until he begged him to stop.
“Sherlock.” John’s voice is steady and reassuring. “Trust me?” Sherlock turns his head to meet John’s eyes and nods, holding his breath. He feels like he’s been punched in the gut, but John is so calm.
John reluctantly turned away and began to make small talk; he listened to people’s dull stories about their families, half tuning them out most of the time. He consented to dance with a couple of the junior designers, and did one with Sarah too, who took the chance to badger him about Sherlock again. He ignored her. He caught Sherlock’s eye a couple times from across the room, but didn’t approach him again. It was starting to be quite a decent night; he didn’t want to ruin it by doing something stupid.
“Burning the midnight oil again?” he said in John’s direction, and John’s heart gave a sudden lurch of surprise.
Sherlock laid a heavy kiss to the centre of John’s collarbone, and John could feel the emotion in it.
He took the final few steps forward, stopping just before the door through which John and his parents were about to disappear.
“Yes, years ago.” Mrs. Hudson tore off the top of a sugar packet. “She does alright now, with her pills and exercises and everything. Still, when it’s your sibling, you can’t help but worry.”
Not quite managing to stop his hands from trembling, he lifted one and slid it, so, so slowly, into John’s where it rested against his side.
Mrs. Hudson smiled sympathetically, but there was a hint of sadness in there too that John didn’t miss.
John coughs and shudders, and Sherlock breaks himself out of his frozen shock and pulls him to roll over. He gasps and moans, nearly retches, empties his lungs, and
John giggled again. He let his legs tangle with Sherlock’s. “Are your feet hanging off the mattress?”
John deepened the kiss even further, so intense now it could have blinded him. Sherlock’s hands roamed up his back, over his shoulders, up his neck to cradle his face. He began to pull back, gentling the kiss with softer, lighter ones, until John finally relaxed his hold on him a bit and allowed him to break off, just a little. Their noses brushed, their breath mingling – John’s lips still tingled with the contact.
“Greg.” Sherlock leaned casually against the nearest chair, as if this were all perfectly ordinary. “I’ve been thinking, can we move the Japanese ambassador to four o’clock tomorrow?”
John moved back to kiss the head again, but this time with an open mouth, laving and lapping all around it, leaving a dark wet spot on the soft fabric. Sherlock was letting out soft moans in quick succession, struggling against John’s grip on his hips, seeking out the heat of John’s mouth, needing direct contact his skin, just needing
As if detecting and feeding off Sherlock’s excitement – which he was, of course he was, so in tune were they on matters just like these – John’s grin broke out clear across his face. “And where are we surprising them?”
“You should go back inside,” Sherlock breathed back. His head sagged a little on his shoulders. He didn’t bother to lift it. “Mary will be waiting.”
Sherlock shoved his phone back in his pocket and swept into the police station, intending to do nothing of the kind.
The man was tall and slim, dressed dapperly in a black suit, though without a tie, the neck of his shirt left open a few buttons. His face was fair, but his hair was a deep black, framing his face in tight, sweeping curls. His eyes were a shocking bright blue, flecked with what looked like patches of green and gold, though John could hardly be sure as they seemed to dazzle in every colour imaginable. His lips were full, and his cheekbones cut sharply out of his face like they had been carved from ivory. A few freckles dotted his long neck.
“How long has it been since he went in?” Molly asked. Each of her hands was clenched nervously around the opposite arm.
“Fair enough,” he smiled, reaching for his mobile in the pocket of his dressing gown. “I’ll see if Lestrade has something below a six.”
“Yeah, it was unbelievable.” Lestrade smiled at the memory. “Normally teases her like there’s no tomorrow, but the
John shouldered his way inside. There was a woman behind the front desk whose face was buried in a romance novel, and she started a little at the sound.
John smirked; his eyes focused enough to reveal Sherlock already kneeling by his side, mouth quirked gently upwards.
John stilled his movements, his eyes screwed shut. Above him, Sherlock’s lips slowed and pulled back, barely an inch. His breath was coming in full-body drags that pressed his chest into John’s.
“Orlova.” He breathed back, barely audible even to himself. “Sokolov knows about the alarms, she wouldn’t just come in through the front door.”
He turned back out to where Dad was looking, at a little sailboat flitting between the barges and ferries.
, John realized. That almost undetectable difference in his stance, in the tension of his arms, that felt like Sherlock was holding himself just barely at a distance, even as his hands were strong against John’s back, even as his lips were quirked warmly upward, drawing John in.
He felt Sherlock’s fingers ease their way out of him, gently, and his hands rubbing up and down his back, grounding him, bringing him back to his body. And oh, John’s every cell was sated with pleasure – his limbs were heavy, his mind utterly blissed out. It had been weeks since he’d felt this good.
Dad did look disarmed, though. “Oh,” he said. The smile dropped off his face again, and he turned to stare back out at the river.
Still shaking, though he was sure it wasn’t from the cold, John pulled his other hand out from behind his back. Grasped in it was a large bouquet of flowers.
A few more seconds, Sherlock acknowledged the populace with a few more waves, then he wrapped his arm around John’s shoulder and pulled him off the stage.
John was sure he was about to break down sobbing again, but it was only a couple more seconds before the doctor swung open the door behind them, and he was able to reign it in.
“Di’s brother works there, she called in a favour.” John was close enough now that Sherlock could see the emotion swimming in his eyes. “I’m sorry, I should have just told you, I know, but – I never thought you would think –”
Sherlock stared down at him, his face completely blank. He looked like no emotion had touched his face since John had seen it last – not one line around his lips or across his forehead to betray anything behind those stone-set eyes.
He pushed the front door open, and a familiar face spun around to greet him. It was David, their next-door neighbour, stood in the kitchen.
John’s fingers had tilted Sherlock’s chin up, but Sherlock’s eyes were already boring deep into John’s.
Sherlock sloshed the water up over his forearms, scrubbing every trace of red that would wash away. Water splashed up to his rolled-up sleeves, raising goosebumps all the way up to his neck. He scrubbed and scratched at the blood caked between his fingers, under his nails, around the base of his wedding ring, and when he had cleaned away all he could he left the water running and braced his hands against the side of the sink, watching it swirl down the drain and sucking deep breaths into lungs that suddenly seemed too small to hold air.
baritone rumble from low in his chest made electricity spark across John’s skin at every point they were touching. “Good?”
He held the cards against his chest, blank side facing outward. They were too big to carry without some awkwardness, but they were ready. He held the CD player with his other hand, ready to go as well. As far as he could tell, the plan would go off smoothly, as long as Mary didn’t answer the door.
“Are you okay?” John asked, laying hand on his forearm. It felt like a burning ember, but Sherlock managed not to throw it off.
It was obvious that she had more to say, but Harry lifted a hand in deference and sipped at her tea again. John tried to steer the conversation to something more neutral, but it wasn’t long before he realized it was hopeless and needed her gone, and Sherlock promptly ushered her out with quick pleasantries before she could protest too much.
“It was just really hard to pick it back up again after I’d stopped for so long,” he went on. He gestured half-heartedly out towards the space outside, the pond and the trees. “It’s easier here. It’s…inspiring, I guess.”
,” Sherlock mumbled. He was settling in properly now, his mind looping towards jokes in his weariness. “We can always rough it out here in the wilderness.”
He reached for the phone, letting his forehead fall into his other hand as he answered. “Hey,” he said, quietly, then paused to listen. “Mhm, absolutely. Free as a bird, fire away.”
He gave a sharp twist of his wrist, hooked his fingers once more inside him, and John tumbled over the edge.
“I know, love.” John reached out and took Sherlock’s hand, stopping his anxious train of thought before it spiralled out of control. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief and squeezed back, gratefully, meeting John’s soft, reassuring eyes and feeling his mind slow down instantly at the sight.
Silence fell over the stage. Sherlock stood next to the bass player, his bow perched on top of the violin strings. Beside them, on two rows of bleachers, stood the choir, all seemingly holding their breath.
“No, no, I know.” Sherlock shook his head again. This was all going wrong. John was the one who was hurt, Sherlock should be comforting
“What do you want with him?” the man asked – his voice was gruffer than Mr. Holmes’, and he looked a bit surprised to have the entire neighbourhood in his restaurant all of a sudden.
John had blurted out a yes before Sherlock had even gotten the question out, and soon he found himself squashed into a tiny sitting room surrounded by merry celebrators on all sides, with his arm around Sherlock’s back like they’d been together all their lives, and it couldn’t have felt more perfect.
“Hello, John,” Sherlock said, surprised to hear himself speaking more softly now. He offered his hand, and John shook it, once.
John swallowed painfully, and let his head hang heavy between his shoulders. He kept his lips firmly shut, knowing that if he opened his mouth, he would lose control completely.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock replied, still smirking. “I suppose, either I could behave like a real rock-and-roll loser, and get drunk alone with my manager…”
John’s brow crinkled – another pang shot through Sherlock’s chest – but he opened his mouth hesitantly and yelled back: “It’s carol singers!”
John smiled and crawled up Sherlock’s body to kiss the desperation from his lips. Sherlock tasted himself on John’s tongue, warm and salty, and the sensation pulled a deep rumbling groan from his throat. He reached down to pull John’s body flush with his own, pressing their chests together and aligning their cocks through the material of John’s trousers, eliciting a gasp from them both.
“Well, I’m a little relieved,” he said, and he sounded it. Sherlock thought he must have been preparing for this conversation for days, running through it over and over in his mind.
Sherlock pushed open the door, realizing too late that he’d left a bloody handprint on the wood. He went to the sink without looking at himself in the mirror and fumbled with the taps. Only the cold water seemed to work, and it numbed Sherlock’s fingers into ice as it washed over them and collected as a deep red lake at the bottom of the basin.
“You know.” Sam was sounding unbearably smug. He made kissing noises with his lips, and John grabbed him around the shoulders.
“I know you’re scared,” he went on, more slowly. “I know what this must have been like, and I’m sorry – I’m sorry I didn’t see it sooner, I’m so sorry.” He pressed his lips firmly against Sherlock’s skin, feeling him turn into the contact. “But Sherlock, sweetheart, you don’t have to worry anymore.”
This story is based on the one in the film featuring Jack (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page), two body doubles for sex scenes in a film.
Sherlock sighed as he twirled the mobile in his hand a few times before pocketing it again. “Just as well,” he muttered. “She’ll only worry.”
"Alright, just tea." He stroked down John's nape once and squeezed his shoulder gently as he stood. "Coming right up."
Sherlock seriously considered not answering it, but when had he ever been able to ignore John, even when it
They were silent in the cab back to Baker Street – whatever had lingered between them earlier was gone now, disappeared with the fleeting, unseized moment. Sherlock supposed he should be grateful that they really
He was wearing a black button-down, and had a white apron tied around his waist. His curls were tumbling errantly over his brow as he served the diners their meals.
Resolute determination slowly pushed out the last of his panic and seemed to settle in the center of his chest, pulsing through his bloodstream more forcefully with every passing second. Steeling himself as quickly as he could, he unearthed another map from the mountain of papers, this one with various locations around Griff Street marked with black X’s. This was his attack stratagem, which he’d been working on for the past hour, and it indicated the location and function of each officer in on the raid tonight. He pushed it toward John, who looked up at him again, this time with an apologetic caution in his eyes that pierced straight into Sherlock’s heart.
“What, the naked Santas?” John smirked. “Yeah, that was a bit shit. They could have at least picked some better-looking models.”
Verusha Sokolov embodied every twisted, unfeeling, reprehensible trait that Sherlock despised about underground criminals. She appeared to be a sort of matriarch to a rival family of the victims, and her name had been showing up on suspect lists of gruesome murders for the past decade. She’d stood trial on four occasions and been miraculously acquitted on all of them due to lack of circumstantial evidence, no doubt a testament to her own skill and repulsive intuitions about dealing with crime scenes and fallout. Other times, she’d been listed as a suspect and scheduled for trial, only to have another Sokolov come forward unexpectedly and confess to the crime. Years ago, Sherlock might have admired her for her ruthless brilliance, but since his experiences with Mary and Moriarty he’d found himself rather put off by psychopaths. Especially those who thought nothing of selling out their own family.
