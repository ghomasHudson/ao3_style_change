Tristram sleeps in the living room again that night. His father looks like he wants to say something, but Tristram studiously avoids his eye as he pulls the coat down and makes a beeline for the couch.
"Yes, we know they died, but there's a difference knowing it as a vague fact and reading every detail as if you were there."
John was still talking, oblivious to Sherlock's state of inner turmoil. "I'm not actually angry at you, you know," he said quietly. "I was, but now I think I'm more confused than anything. I don't know how to make any of this right again-"
Emily is in a better mood on the way back to the house, keeping up a steady stream of questions mixed in with her own speculations about the oceans. Doctor Watson, in the driver's seat, responds patiently and with what Tristram has come to recognise as his special brand of indulgent good humour. Tristram's father even chimes in without being prompted to tell about a case involving a body that had been washed up in the Estuary. Tristram has never heard it before, and normally, he would be fascinated, but now he just wishes everyone would stop talking. He is resentful of Doctor Watson and Emily both, how they have drawn his father out of his habitual reserve and engaged him. And at the same time sickeningly guilty, because Father is happy in a way that Tristram's never seen him before. Shouldn't Tristram be happy about that too?
As soon as they are in the bedroom, John closes the door and hands Irene his phone so she can see the text: 'May be a couple of days. Take kids home. Properly. SH'
Top and tail, and string the snowpeas. Cut snow peas in half lengthwise and on an angle (like two long triangles). Grate the carrot.
He must fall asleep again, because he finds himself waking up at some point later during the night. There's no light seeping in around the edges of the curtains, so it must still be well before dawn. He listens for what might have woken him but can't hear anything other than Emily breathing steadily on the other side of the mattress. Tristram turns carefully onto his other side to try and find a more comfortable position. He breathes in sharply and his heart jumps when he sees a faint, dark form in one of the chairs next to the sofa bed.
But Sherlock was happy, he reminded himself sternly. John was here. John trusted him with his daughter. John was breathing in Sherlock's bed. It was still his bed, even if he wasn't in it. Even if they'd washed the sheets, bought new pillows, flipped the mattress, and hoovered thoroughly underneath, there would still be traces of Sherlock's sloughed off skin cells. Eyelashes and tiny hairs. Trapped in the seams of the floorboards and bedframe, worked deep into the foam of the mattress. John was breathing him in every night. And his discarded bits of skin and hair were getting mixed up with Sherlock's.
Tristram hasn't seen Doctor Watson and Emily since the night he was shot. They're still in the secret, safe place that Uncle Mycroft arranged for them. They're not allowed to telephone, and Emily hasn't sent any more letters. Or at least there haven't been any more delivered. Father hasn't had any contact with them either, which is driving him spare. He's bemoaned the fact loudly and at length several times since they got home last night, between intense sessions poring over the samples left for him on Tristram's dinner tray. Tristram suggests that he could write a letter, the same way he and Emily did, but apparently that is 'medieval'. Tristram doesn't think Father really finds letter-writing evil; he simply doesn't have the patience for it. And anyway, they will see them tonight at the airport.
He turns his head, and there's an expanse of smooth, buff-coloured knitwear beside him, wrapped around a slender woman's figure. He follows the sheath dress up to her heart-shaped face and dark hair twisted into a complicated style at the back of her head. She's staring down at them with a polite, aloof smile, but there's a tension in her arms and neck that tells Tristram she's nervous or at least keyed up.
"I'm sure it's fine. Sorry for all the trouble. Thank you." She picked up the bag, but paused before going back to the bathroom to complete the ruse. There was something off about him, but he wasn't staring at her. He wasn't particularly avoiding looking at her either. He didn't seem all that occupied with her at all, to tell the truth. Maybe something had happened while he was out. "Is everything all right?"
When the door finally opens, the entrance area is crowded: in addition to Emily and her father, both of Emily's aunts are there, and they have their coats on.
John sighed and set the glass down. "Sounds like my day. Anything I can help with?" He nodded at the counter where Sherlock was working.
"No, and it's barely-" Sherlock caught sight of his watch. It was nearly nine o'clock. He really wasn't hungry, though. Getting wrapped up in a project tended to suppress his appetite. But he could see the strain and weariness on John's face and in his shoulders. A break would probably do him good. And Sherlock should give Gladstone his dinner, anyway.
John glanced up at the house in time to see a curtain twitch. He didn't care; wanted, even, for her to know: that Sherlock was loved, and cherished. That he was good, and deserving of happiness. That John was going to give that to him. Or try to anyway. He wanted everyone to know. He supposed perhaps they did already, had long thought he and Sherlock were a couple.
Yes, it actually did bother him, but he saw the sense in it. The songs were better now, at least for the purpose they were going to be used for.
Sherlock leaned forward to set his bottle back on the coffee table. He stayed there, his elbows resting on his knees, and brought his hands together in front of his mouth.
"Emily, you can go get dressed and pack your things," John says. "Maybe you could help her, Jeanne."
Due to the angle his head's wedged in at, all Tristram can see are her shoes and her sheer black-stockinged legs from the knees down. She has on high heels, black, with sparkly bits. They look very fancy and utterly impractical. She drops down into a crouch to peer at him. She's wearing a sparkly black dress and her hair is piled up on top of her head with sparkly pins in it, and her face is made up with dark colours. She gets a little line between her eyebrows when she sees him.
John's eyebrows rise and his face opens up, all the concern-creases turning around to go the other way. "And here I was, trying to break it to you gently. Should have known." He reaches out and ruffles Tristram's hair. Tristram grins.
Finally, the wedding cake. A frothy, over-the-top, multi-tiered confection in white and silver. Sherlock couldn't help comparing it to John's. John and Mary's. He realised he never thought of it as John and Mary's wedding, only as John's. But without Mary, there would have been no wedding. None of the rest, either. Maybe not even this. Would John have settled into this thing with Sherlock, whatever it was, if it hadn't been for her? Would he have met someone else? Found happiness with her? Impossible to say. Unproductive to speculate. It didn't matter. John was back home now, after a long and arduous detour.
"Mm, yes," Sherlock agreed, but this was news to him. He'd been under the impression that John Watson came with a guaranteed stamp of approval. It had never occurred to him that he wasn't the first one to consider John's physical and mental history to be potential marks against him. He bristled now at the suggestion. John would never endanger the children, or do or say anything inappropriate or harmful. And of course this put the entire kerfluffle over the movie in a new light. If it came out that it was all fake, that John had been the one to bring it to Lestrade, and that he had continued to perpetrate the lie even after Sherlock told him the truth, there might well be consequences for him, beyond losing his position at the school.
As if his father could hear his thoughts, he says, "It was right, though, to come get me. I want you to do exactly the same thing the next time something seems off to you."
John smiled at Tristram then, as if he'd read his mind. Tristram smiled back quickly and looked out the window, because they were coming out of the tunnel.
"Oh, bless me," she exclaims when she sees Tristram and Emily. "Here you are already, and me just back from the shops. Your granny only told me this morning you'd be here." She slings the bags onto the counter.
Sherlock gave John an inscrutable look then went to stand at the window, much as his father had done a few minutes earlier. The resemblance between the two men struck John particularly at that moment: the profile, the tilt of the head, the long, lean curve of the body, the delicate fingers holding back the curtain to get a clear view of the garden. John tried superimposing the image of Mr Holmes on Sherlock, imagining him thirty or forty years on. Hair gone grey, lines around his eyes, still wearing that suit jacket, although it would hang more loosely on his thinning frame.
He'd forgotten about him and Moriarty. Stupid! Of course they would be here. His pulse increased as he scanned the crowd. And there he was: right behind Moran, the dapper Irishman was standing with his arms crossed over his chest and his eyes narrowed critically as he watched Lestrade. He turned just then, catching Sherlock looking at him. He winked and his mouth curled into a triumphant smirk. Sherlock deliberately looked away. What was he up to?
John had invited him along the other day when he took Mary's rings to be cleaned and buy a proper box for them to be stored in until Watson was old enough to inherit them. Asked him for input on the ring box. It was the same shop where they'd bought the wedding rings, although it wasn't the same assistant. That had been more than odd, in retrospect: the three of them shopping for wedding rings. John and Mary had wanted Sherlock to try them on too. For purposes of comparison, they'd said. He hadn't thought anything of it at the time. He'd liked the dark gold one best, narrower than John's but wider than Mary's. It had felt pleasantly solid on his finger without being restrictive or weighty. Of course they hadn't bought him one. Of course not. There were limits. But in the shop this time, Sherlock had seen John browsing the case with similar rings. He still wore his ring. He missed Mary, of course. He'd been widowed less than a year. It was too soon. Or too late.
Tristram hunkers down next to him. Indeed. Instead of the normal three slits arranged in a more or less equilateral triangle, there are three round holes arranged in a kind of flat isosceles triangle, deep in a hexagonal recess. A normal plug would never fit. Father hands Tristram the power cord. The attachment he stuck on the end has three round metal prongs in the same pattern as the holes in the wall, protruding from a hexagonal piece of plastic that should fit neatly into the recess.
Tristram has no idea what she's talking about, but he can't take the time to think about it because he's still struggling to get air into his lungs. A moment later, Emily is standing in front of him, looking concerned.
"Hold on." John moves some papers aside and picks up a blue folder. He brings it over and sits down next to Sherlock.
First things first. As John would now be alert to any remote logins to his bank account and Sherlock wouldn't be able to get in touch with anyone from Clarenden before Monday, he sent a text to Wiggins asking him to task someone with chatting up some of the tenants in John's building and getting the rent figures from them. That would hopefully be sorted within 24 hours.
John, defeated, hung his head and squeezed his eyes shut as Sherlock delicately maneuvered his underwear out of the way to unveil his now fully engorged penis. It stood out thick and red from his body, veins bulging and giving it a marbled appearance.
A soft knock at the door informed me that one of them had arrived. I liked to make a game of deducing what I could before opening the door. It was a stranger, clearly. I knew the knocks of all of my regular visitors, and someone who had been here even once before would not be so hesitant, as if unsure of the reaction of the home's inhabitant to their interruption. A man, to judge by the double-rap (women tended to rap three times or more) of average height (from the position of the contact), and using a cane (the tap of its metal tip against the stone step), which indicated additionally that he was either of advanced years or suffering from a debility. The topic would be a personal problem, nothing of a criminal nature, or if it were, something that he was embarrassed to take to the local constabulary. It was pressing enough to seek me out this early, but not so urgent that he had lost his composure. It was enough to start with, and I went to the door prepared to impress my visitor and gather more clues from his appearance, accent, attire, comportment, and any of the hundred other seemingly insignificant details that led me to my conclusions. As soon as I opened the door, however, all thoughts of clues and deductions flew from my mind as I was faced with the very last person I had ever expected to see here.
When they get to the top, it's still foggy - or cloudy. Most of the people they were on the cable car with set right off down the path leading away from the station and disappear within a matter of seconds. A few hang around adjusting their equipment and consulting the maps and charts displayed on the wall of the little shed housing the station. Father wanders over to look at the maps and charts too, while Tristram, Emily and Doctor Watson go out to the path.
A taxi almost stopped, and Sherlock hadn't even raised his hand. He took a step back, hopefully making it look as if he were trying to find a safer position from which to observe the traffic. John was going to have to arrive at the point quickly.
That's true. Although there was still something off. There was none of the casual talk and easy smiles that have come to mark their fathers' interactions. Instead, they were short and to-the-point. Not angry, just businesslike. Tristram assumed it was because they were focused on their 'errand', but with all the other evidence it's beginning to look like something else.
Sherlock's breathing became more erratic at John's touch. Unable to resist the temptation any longer, John licked his thumbs and reached over to rub both of Sherlock's nipples at the same time. Sherlock keened, the cords of his neck standing out. John felt his own nipples tightening, echoing a very insistent throbbing in his groin. John rubbed and circled the engorged tissue as Sherlock panted and struggled to maintain control. Or to lose it.
"John..." Sherlock said, his voice reduced to barely a whisper. The anticipation was similar to the second time he'd injected a syringe full of cocaine solution into his arm. The first time he'd merely been curious; the second time he'd known what it would do.
"You'll be walking directly into a trap," John says, as if he doesn't think Sherlock's aware of the fact.
Mycroft looks them over, wrinkling his nose. "Couldn't you at least have changed? Have you been climbing through bins?"
For God's sake. While it was true John's interactions with both Lestrade and Molly had been more cordial than warm since his marriage, he was obviously included if Sherlock was going. "Don't be an idiot, John," Sherlock said irritably, "of course you're invited too. Although, that wasn't the only reason he wanted to see me." He scrolled through the entries. Ah, here it was. He hadn't deleted it after all.
Sherlock stops at the bottom of the stairs and wheels around to loom over John, who skids to a halt next to him. "I know this is a difficult concept for you," he snaps, "but I
"There is nothing I can do for him. There is, however, something I can do here. Do you 'get that'?" Father retorts snidely.
Afterwards, when Father turns out the light and goes back downstairs, Tristram snuggles under his blankets and hears Emily in the bed beside his doing the same thing. It strikes him that, even with whatever threats are still out there, and these new killers his father is after, this is the first time since Friday Afternoon that he's felt good, and safe, and happy.
"They let us hold her after they unhooked her from all the machines. Here's another one, you can see her a bit better." John lifts out a second photograph from the file.
"Tickets to the circus?" Emily guesses. Tristram is impressed; it looks like she was thinking along the same lines as him, but didn't take quite enough time to reason things out as far as he did.
"You're not really in a position," Lestrade said mildly. "Look, I don't know, think of it as you mentoring him."
John lets out a long breath and rolls his eyes toward the ceiling. Then he turns onto his side, propping his head up on one hand so he can see Sherlock. "Look. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I would rather not have my daughter - or your son, for that matter - see me stumble half-dressed out of your bedroom first thing in the morning. Even if nothing..." He stops and looks around again, then says, "I keep thinking of how Tristram reacted."
However, when Sherlock would quiz him the following morning, John was unhapppily vague in his responses, saying things like 'You know I don't have an ear for music,' or 'Sherlock, I have to get to work,' or 'Why the hell are you storing frogspawn in the toilet?'
"She and her boyfriend," John said. "They'd been divorced for three years already. Split up as soon as Harry moved out. He couldn't stand to see her happy."
Now Sherlock is curious. "What did you see in her?" He's fairly certain it's not the same things he himself saw that first night he met her.
Father flicks the curtain back down. "Not that I know of," he says, but he snatches his phone up from the side table where it's charging and starts typing on it rapidly.
It seems surreal that the most momentous statement ever made in the history of the world should be uttered as they are sitting in this frankly squalid little hovel, witnessed only by John's dirty vests, a week-old pizza box (Sherlock can smell it under the bed), and likely a colony of bed bugs (although the red marks on John's wrists and neck might also be due to the cheap washing powder he's been using).
Sherlock and John agreed to meet after school to work on the choreography in the assembly hall, while Molly said she needed to make a tour of the second-hand shops for things they could use as costumes. The less original sewing the parents needed to do, the better.
"And as for the play..." Sherlock looked around. All of the children were paused in their preparations for lunch, watching him with big eyes. Again, they were only facts, but it took an immense effort to form the words. "Something has changed. I let you believe that Whitehall Studios were coming to make a movie out of the play, but it turns out they aren't. In fact, they never were. I lied about it, and I let that lie grow, and multiply, and turn into lots of other little lies. And now I've been found out, and we are not actually being allowed to do the show. There will be no Nativity at all."
Tristram has no reason to doubt it, but when Doctor Watson goes into the bathroom, Tristram gets up and peeks past the half-open bedroom door. Indeed, the back of Father's head, his shoulders, and one bare leg are visible sticking out from the pile of twisted bedclothes. Tristram can't see his face, but he's not moving, other than the very slight rise and fall of his back as he breathes. Tristram watches him for a good, long while, but the rhythm never falters. If he's faking, he's very convincing.
This must be what normal people felt like when confronted with an obvious fact they were unable to comprehend. Because that wasn't the right answer. It couldn't be. "But there are two weeks left to the term," he said stupidly. John had to come back. This couldn't be the end.
They stayed like that for an interminable moment, until the ringing was no more than an echo in Sherlock's ears.
"What's going on?" Tristram hears Doctor Watson, loud and urgent, but he can't see him because there are arms around him. Father's arms. Pulling him away.
Tristram's brain is only now catching up. Doctor Watson was lying on top of Father. He was kissing him. Kissing, not crying. That's what they were doing. Father was holding onto him. He wanted him there. Tristram feels like he's the one that's going to cry. He knows that what he saw was more than kissing. Putting your mouths together, that's kissing (which is kind of gross, but his father does lots of things - enjoys lots of things - that most people would consider gross; also, the people in Mrs Hudson's shows on the telly kiss, sometimes a lot, so Tristram knows it's normal behaviour for adults. Maybe they get used to the grossness, like they do the taste of coffee). But Doctor Watson and Father were in bed together. Their bodies were touching. All over. They had their clothes off - some of them, anyway. They both still had their trousers on. Were they … doing it? He knows it's called something else, but he doesn't even want to use that word in his head. Tristram also knows, technically, abstractly, how a man and a woman make a baby, and that two men can do something similar, even if it doesn't result in a baby. He can't think that thought through any further. He tears his eyes away, unable to look at his father anymore.
Tristram follows Emily up to his room. He wants to get some dry clothes, too. Emily takes her bag under the tent on the beds to change, while Tristram quickly pulls on a clean pair of trousers and some socks.
"It's fine," Doctor Watson says softly, mindful not to disturb Emily, who doesn't seem to have been wakened by the goings-on.
Tristram doesn't think that would be cosy at all. Unless by 'cosy' she means 'cramped'. There's not even really room for four of them, much less five. Where would Irene sleep? At this point, Tristram imagines there isn't any question that John would sleep in Father's room with Father, but even after his very short acquaintance with Irene, he can't picture her on the couch in the living room.
The next point is that their fathers took them from Uncle Mycroft's house in the middle of the night and drove straight across the country without stopping, causing them to miss a full day of school, unexcused. (Or excused? Tristram has to admit it's possible his father arranged for him to be absent from school in advance; Father's made enough plans this week involving Tristram without letting him know until the last moment. But usually, when a student knows that they will not be in school - such as for a doctor's appointment or a funeral - the teacher gives them the assignments for the days they will miss before they go. Mrs Norris didn't mention anything yesterday. So, the logical conclusion is that his absence today is unexcused.)
They're the only visitors, which is probably a good thing as it's a very small museum. There are just two rooms, one dedicated to plants and the other to animals. The curator, a dour-looking older man with suspenders and a pot belly, emerges from a back room surrounded by the scent of pipe smoke. He knows just about enough English to get across that the museum showcases the local flora and fauna, before he retreats back to his pipe - and elevenses, if Tristram's not mistaken by the crumbs on his shirt.
"Handwriting," Sherlock said, his exasperation apparent. He flicked his laser-pointer eyes through the rows of suspects. They responded by falling silent, squirming, and looking anywhere but the front of the room.
Lestrade replied with a rude hand gesture aimed in  Sherlock’s direction that turned into a sarcastic bow. “The body is this way you  royal git. We also have a witness I might let you speak to if it won’t  interfere too much with your busy schedule.”
“I suggest the front door.” Sherlock handed the paper to  Lestrade and traced the way to the lowest level with a scaly claw. “It’s up to  you to find them Lestrade. It will be easier for you to slip by unnoticed. My  brother and I will provide plenty of distraction.”
“You great scaly bastard!” John shoved Sherlock hard enough  he stumbled though the man just grinned at him and laughed. John smiled and  shook his head, turning at the sound of a shout from the interior of the  decrepit warehouse they were standing in front of.
He wondered how his life had come to this. His younger years  were spent as an unassuming human. He’d gone to school, played rugby, trained  as a doctor and ended up drafted into the officer corps of the British Royal  Army on the eve of the Sere War.
John did not take his eyes off the window as Lestrade made  his way into the interrogation room, gesturing at the security detail to step  outside. “If there’s a dampener what good are his handcuffs other than a  restraining device?”
John flinched and Sherlock bumped his shoulder and flicked  the switch on the microphone. “Don’t you think it more than a coincidence that  John’s long lost father happened to find the one place in London John and I  were almost certain to show up?”
John snarled over his shoulder as he  was surrounded by minions and pushed into a curtained cubicle. He was  twisted and turned, helpless to their machinations as he swiftly  found himself standing only in his boxers. “Sherlock! Greg?  Mycroft!! I swear on my spotted, furry ass I will murder you all in  your sleep!”
John stilled. He nodded. “You're  right. I am a bastard. I am a healer and a soldier and loyal to the  king and his consort. I am a guardian of the prince's body and his  heart.”
Sound and motion returned around them as the Followers fell  beneath the onslaught of the ravaging beasts. The remaining acolytes surrounded  the two but John and Lestrade were swept up into the sky by two bristling  dragons who layered the courtyard with walls of searing flame. Sirens rent the  air but by the time the first truck arrived there was nothing left but a black  crater filled with a bed of thick ash.
Lloyd strode across the room and laid a tentative hand on  John’s furred shoulder. “Easy kitty boy. We don’t want to provoke anything we  can’t finish at the moment.”
Mycroft sniffed. “No need to worry  brother mine. The affects of this particular brand of alcohol are  potent but short lived for our kind.”
The wolverine curled up snug and secure within the grip of  his dragon and allowed the familiar beating of powerful wings to lull him into  a dreamless sleep.
“You can’t do that! You don’t have any evidence to hold me.”  Lloyd’s skin glowed brighter turning from copper to red and then back again as  he yelped in pain.
Sherlock sighed, pulling John behind  him as he came to stand in front of Mycroft and Greg. Inclining his  head only slightly he intoned, “I, Sherlock William Scott Holmes,  second to the house of Dragon, do swear my oath and fealty to Mycroft  Aloysious Holmes, first of the house of Dragon and support his right  to the throne of the Old Ones. Gods help us all.”
“John! Are you alright?” Lestrade helped the pale and  shaking man to his feet and they both swayed awkwardly for a moment until John  found his footing.
Lestrade growled. “Both of you gits shut it and listen for a  change. John’s da has power even if the fucker doesn’t look strong enough to  cheat my grandmere at a game of gin. Actually that’s a bad example.”
“Great, glad that’s settled!”  Greg took Mycroft’s arm while flashing John a cheeky grin. “We’d  best get changed into our costumes, it’s getting late and we  wouldn’t want to disappoint our adoring public.”
“He is the reason they took John, Mycroft!” Sherlock  interrupted as his eyes flared scarlet in their fury. “If he has caused one  hair to be harmed on my John’s head I will tear him apart! Slowly.”
Lloyd tossed his hat in the air and  bowed as it landed perfectly on his head. “Oh come on John, I  didn’t put all this time and effort in for you to be some lapdog to  a sloppy second! I’m here to rescue you from your own foolishness!  You Johnny boy are meant for much greater things.”
“Yeah, yeah whatever, could you hurry it up a bit?” Lloyd  edged away from John but was stopped by a wall of red robes. “Look just take me  and … fuck!”
The silence in the temple was  deafening until it was interrupted by the clap of a single pair of  hands.
Lestrade leaned in and left a smacking kiss on Mycroft’s  cheek as the air surrounding him shimmered and sparkled with beads of bright  light.
Mycroft merely raised a regal  eyebrow but John wondered if he’d detected a hint of  fondness in  the powerful dragon’s eyes. Then he realized all eyes were on him.  He bowed his head, looking up through his lashes. “Um, right. I,  Doctor John Watson, chosen hand of the house of Jaguar, sworn  protector of, uh, his royal highness, the prince of Dragon, do,  solemnly swear my oath and fealty to Mycroft Holmes and support his  right to the throne of the Old Ones. Oh, and Greg too. Right.”
I suppose the map didn’t show us an easy way in,” Lestrade  said rubbing a hand through his silvery thatch of hair.
John raised his claws and for the first  time in his life saw fear in his father’s eyes. He dragged the  razor tip of one across Lloyd’s cheek. A thin line of blood welled  up and spilled down the collar of the man’s coat. The cut healed  almost instantly, leaving a raised white scar puckering Lloyd’s  skin from ear to chin.
Soon Lloyd’s hands were free and he was sitting up and  rubbing his wrists. “Where did you learn to do that?”
John stared at him in disbelief.  “Since when do you care about duty and responsibility? What the  fuck, Sherlock?”
He staggered back as a sharp backlash sent sparks of pain  shooting up his arm. His vision went gray as rough hands hauled him down and he  was wrapped in strong arms.
Lloyd shrugged and closed his eyes for a moment a fond look  on his face. “I’m not exactly sure. A witch or an oracle I guess you might say.  She … she knew things. Things dangerous to know.”
They didn't so much have an appointment as they had brass balls. Mostly Sherlock's. A quick check of the online city events calendar showed the city orchestra was giving a Christmas concert. The mayor was certain to be in attendance.
Doctor Watson hops up into the ambulance. Nisha tells him to sit on the bench across from Tristram, while she sits on a little fold-out seat near his head. Tino is already in the driver's cab.
She'd had live-in lovers before, and by this point in her life, she was self-aware and mature enough to know that she liked having a separate space for herself, needed it really. She was done with someone else using her shaver and leaving half-finished drinks in odd corners to mould and demanding her attention so they could pontificate on the latest Conservative outrage, when all she wanted to do after a long shift at the clinic was curl up on the couch with a glass of wine and read a trashy novel.
He walked up and down the street until he found a car (elderly owner, rarely driven, not moved in at least two weeks) with the older type of manual lock. A few minutes later, he was inside, shaking back his hair and wiping the water off his face with his sleeve. All that was left to do was wait. He rationed the cigarettes, and after an hour, got out to relocate Gladstone under the awning of a restaurant.
"You think they have someone planted with the right kind of reason?" Doctor Watson asks. He's looking deliberately in another direction now too, but Tristram is certain he hasn't let the man out of his sight.
"And then," John continues, "when she was a little older, you'd be sitting at the kitchen table looking at something unspeakable under the microscope — slices of cirrhotic liver or something — and she'd be on your lap, grabbing for the eyepiece and drooling on your Brooks Brothers."
"Right," Watson said slowly, "well, I was thinking, do you want to come for a Sausage Sizzler?" He pointed vaguely over his shoulder.
"Technically, but this is in no condition to be played. It would need to be completely re-stringed. The bow too." Sherlock reached around John to take the violin off the wall. Close enough that John could smell his aftershave and the breath mint covering the lingering aftertaste of cigarettes. He breathed in deeply before he could stop himself. Sherlock ran his hands over the instrument, blew some dust off, and plucked lightly at a string. It made a dull, plonging sound. John's heart jumped.
"Can we go up to my room?" Emily asks, stealing a conspiratorial look at Tristram. Tristram's both relieved and disappointed. He doesn't like being caught in a room with uncomfortable adult conversations going on, but on the other hand he thinks there's less chance his father and Doctor Watson will get angry at each other if Tristram and Emily are in the room with them.
They don't end up kissing here, although maybe that's only because of Irene's pointed throat-clearing to get their attention. They turn to look at her, John a bit pink in the face and Father a bit irritated.
Greg splutters, "Look, I'm not your handler. And I don't do what your brother tells me. But yes, he asked if I wouldn't mind popping down." He turns to John. "How the hell does he do that?"
Doctor Watson leans down, bracing one arm against the top of the door frame. "We're all going together, love," he says gently, then turns his head to speak over his shoulder in a much colder tone, "Just as soon as Sherlock here admits he's not actually in possession of a driving license."
"Come on," Emily says, already halfway up the stairs. "Now I can finally show you the time machine box."
"Yeah, think we're staying," John told Mycroft as Sherlock continued to stay resolutely put. The three of them along with Mrs Holmes had come together in Mycroft's car, following the ambulance. If they didn't take Mycroft up on the offer now, they'd have to take a taxi later or wait until either Mrs Holmes or Mycroft returned in the morning.
All too soon, it was time to return to the school. It didn't seem real that this was the last time he and John would see each other. In a couple of hours, Sherlock would talk to Lestrade, and then he would be asked to gather his belongings and not come back. That part would actually be a relief. It was the other part, the impending separation, that was uncomfortable. More than uncomfortable, in fact. It simply felt wrong, like two people leaving three sets of footprints. It niggled at Sherlock, sat heavy in his stomach. He hoped he'd get over it quickly. He certainly didn't want to have to deal with emotional fallout over this. That would defeat the purpose entirely.
Sherlock had no choice, really, but to go along with it. His resolution not to allow John to interfere with things not related to the play had long since fallen by the wayside. The most bothersome part of it was that they were actually getting ahead of schedule according to Sherlock's strictly regimented syllabus. It wasn't simply a matter of having someone available to work individually with the slower pupils. John's presence had also worked wonders for discipline and cooperation amongst the children. They genuinely liked John and wanted to please him.
"All I could see was you. Even when I was with her, all I saw was you... with her. On her, in her-" His teeth clenched as he spoke, his fingers cramped white on the latch of the violin case.
And then right there, right in the middle of his father's head, a little yellow light flares up. It takes Tristram a moment to understand that it's not a reflection of something inside the flat, but something coming from outside. He sits up straight and unfocuses his eyes to force them to see through the glass rather than on the surface. There, again, only this time the glow is orange. It's coming from one of the windows of the building directly across from them. He immediately knows what that is. It's the bodyguard, the one Uncle Mycroft sent to watch them at Grandmother's. It doesn't look like he took Tristram's advice about the nicotine patches. He hopes he's at least where he's supposed to be this time, even if he is smoking on duty. He wouldn't want the man to get in trouble. But he won't tell. It makes Tristram feel safer after all the upset with the near poisoning, knowing that there's someone out there who's protecting him and his father.
"What the hell! Sherlock, I've just cheated on her. With you, in case you weren't paying attention back there."
John stares up at him, his eyes wide. There is silence for the space of several seconds. Finally, John whispers, "I'm sorry."
And since then, he'd found things to do, experiments or little games or self-appointed training missions that amused him. This thing with John was just another one. He didn't really care how it turned out, he told himself. It didn't matter that John had cooled toward him, even if he was obviously still attracted to Sherlock. It wouldn't affect his life one way or the other if he never saw John after the play. The meetings and the talks and the laughter and the meals and the arguments - the touches and the looks and the liquid-electric feelings - none of that changed anything, none of that changed him. Even if it was pleasant and he didn't mind it, wouldn't mind doing any of it again, not even the arguments; especially not the arguments, because Sherlock actually found himself listening to what John said, even when he was wrong, even when he was being stupid and obvious and not understanding, because John was listening too, actually listening to what Sherlock was saying, not judging him or pitying him. He was trying, and sometimes he was even right. And sometimes Sherlock knew that this almost wasn't a game any more, but he had to keep telling himself it was, because otherwise it would mean something when he lost.
She could have screamed. Clearly, someone needed to beat some sense into them both. "He's interested. I think he just doesn't know how to go about it," she said tactfully.
John came over and stood next to the table. Close enough that Sherlock could see the faint stubble on his chin (he'd shaved carefully that morning: another good sign) and smell the cinnamon caught on his jumper (he'd spilt some on the counter, brushed it away with his sleeve). Also his aftershave (when had he taken to wearing that again?) and the slight sourness of his breath at the end of the day (no alcohol, though; Sherlock might have been wrong about the reason for the pie).
"Good morning, darling," Mrs Holmes said, offering a cheek for Sherlock to kiss dutifully. "John here's going into town with me in a bit. Do you want to come?"
It might still be something else that was bothering John, of course. Sherlock would keep an eye out. It seemed as if he did nothing but observe John these days. Trying to suss out what would coax a smile, inspire a humorous jab, prompt a relaxed stance, ensure a good night's sleep. It wasn't a hardship, precisely; Sherlock was fairly certain he would never tire of watching John, listening to him, sensing his presence a room or a floor or even half a city away. Was that possible? Bioelectrical fields or something even more esoteric. It did leave him with a gnawing sense of emptiness sometimes, though, as if all that John-targeted focus were draining him of something essential.
"You can't be bloody serious," John said. He sounded genuinely angry. "Couldn't that have waited sixty more seconds?"
"Yes, now please, Emily. Tris, could you...?" Doctor Watson jerks his head toward the bedroom. He looks like he's about to lose his temper, although not, Tristram thinks, because of him and Emily.
Ah yes, that was it. Sherlock resumed walking, satisfied that he'd hit upon the solution (and not the slightest bit let down that it mightn't be a purely social invitation): John wanted to talk about those incidents, find out what he'd possibly done wrong. But that was precisely the point: John had done nothing wrong. He'd simply been himself. And that was exactly what Sherlock was unable to deal with. So, yes, he did fancy meeting up with John. Which was why he couldn't. He tapped out a quick negative response without breaking stride.
Sherlock slowly relaxes his hold on John. John lets him go. "Sherlock?" he asks uncertainly when Sherlock sits up and crawls over John to get out of bed.
John looked pleased about the beer, at any rate, and when they got to Sherlock's house, he went with him into the kitchen and rummaged around in the drawers for a bottle opener without being prompted, while Sherlock put out some food for Gladstone. The surreal mundanity of the scene struck Sherlock hard, and he had to blink a few times to reassure himself that nothing had actually changed from the day before. John didn't live here. Sherlock couldn't just reach over and brush a hand down his back as he flexed his shoulder to work the bottle opener. Wasn't allowed to. Didn't have the right. Or did he?
“Um, look, forget I said anything.” Lloyd licked his lips  with a nervous dart of his tongue. ”Let’s just concentrate on getting the hell  out of here.”
“Gentlemen, and I’m using the term loosely here, we really  should probably think about leaving before the two dragons upstairs tear apart  half of London.”
Sherlock surrounded John like an endless sea so deep and vast he would never find its end. Yet he wasn’t drowning. On the contrary, he thought perhaps he was breathing for the first time. The only thing John was sure of was that he would do anything for Sherlock Holmes.
John stared back at the man his fists clenched and his  shoulders squared as if he were preparing for attack.
Lestrade  grabbed  Lloyd and stroked the cuffs who let go of the table leg only to curl back  around Lloyd’s wrist as his arms were hauled behind his back.
“Damn it Sherlock wait!” John cried out but he was too late  as Sherlock was surrounded. The dragon’s lips grew wide as curved fangs  dripping with venom erupted from his mouth. He growled and whirled in a circle  as bursts of wild flame engulfed the robed figures.
John sighed. Sherlock had been repeating this same phrase  for days, every time he had a moment to think about it. He swatted his brand  new – flatmate? Lover? Dragon? – whatever he was – on the head with a folded  newspaper. “Enough! It worked didn’t it?”
Lestrade slapped Mycroft’s foot with his paw but ceased  complaining and settled in to enjoy the ride. He loved flying with Mycroft but  he didn’t need to give the arrogant dragon any more reason to feel full of  himself. Though he suspected from the way Mycroft was snorting that he’d already  given himself away.
“They aren’t magic John.” Sherlock said as he nestled one of  the buds into his ear and offered the other to John. “They’re rather … alive.”
They pointed skeletal  fingers in Lloyd’s direction and spoke as one. “You bear the mark of the lost soul.  We come for you Lloyd Artisian.”
Lloyd shrugged. “Suit yourself.” He grunted and strained and  avoided John’s side eyes of amusement but only managed to cut himself on the  sharp edge of a piece of plastic. “Shit!”
Sherlock’s face lit up with curiosity and John’s drained of  color as he realized what he said. He turned his eyes from Sherlock’s, avoiding  his shrewd gaze, and wiggled out from under the man’s feet. “Never mind me.  Shall we order take-away? There’s that new Thai place down the street we  haven’t tried.”
Sherlock looked annoyed as Lestrade spread his hands in an  appeasing gesture. “It’s the best I can do and you know it. It’s already more  than I should be allowing so I’d take the offer before I change my mind.” He  winked at John.
John growled. “No one touches  Sherlock. No one. But me. I will do anything to keep him safe.” His  hand tightened as Lloyd’s eyes bulged in their sockets. “Anything.”
“Well what difference does it make,” Lloyd barked back, “I  took you and you obviously managed to see it!”
He was startled back into paying  attention by Mycroft lifting their clasped hands. The priest, or  whatever  it was, produced pale white, clawed fingers from somewhere  within it’s drapery and wound a length of silk, so black it  appeared to swallow the light surrounding it, around their wrists.  Greg watched in horrified fascination as it tightened to the point he  felt his bones ache, and then sank beneath their flesh, leaving bands  of black tattooing their skin.
John advanced, his bones grinding, his  muscles wrenching and bulging as he stalked forward. His form  wavered, straining, twisting itself into something new. By the time  he breached Lloyd’s space he towered over him, a beautiful and  deadly combination of man and predator.
He grinned as Lestrade darted behind the Followers while he  held their attention.  “I’m left handed.”
Lloyd screamed as a host of red shadows wound themselves  around him. Every nerve in his body misfired as he was assaulted with razor  sharp burning pain. He couldn’t see, couldn’t hear, couldn’t breathe. He  couldn’t breathe! He couldn’t …
The rows of seats were filled with  every kind of fey imaginable and a few John had thought were only  stories until he was faced with their curious stares. Music somehow  swelled from above and below and all around them, filling the space  with a stately melody that felt slightly off beat.
John returned from his thoughts to  find Sherlock staring at him from the rumpled sheets, his gaze keen  and heavy lidded.
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed. “We’ll meet you at the Yard. Come  along John.” He turned with a flair of his coat and stalked away.
Snatching the map from Lestrade’s hand, Sherlock swirled the  edge of his coat and was out the door while ignoring Mycroft’s cry of protest.
The stairs shook as they climbed and dust from the ceiling  rained down upon their heads. As they approached the surface the ear-splitting  shrieks of furious dragons doing battle rang through the building and the acrid  smell of smoke and ash permeated the air.
“Shut it John.” Lloyd’s voice was grim. “Don’t talk about  things you know nothing about.” He stretched his arms wide and grinned. “Now  laddies how about we get this show on the road.”
“I’m here for you Johnny boy!  I’ve come to aid you in claiming your birthright!” Lloyd grinned,  his eyes sparkling in the candlelight.
“I want him found and then I will personally see to his  disembowelment!” Mycroft was breathing smoke and fire into the air after every  word and his face was wreathed in red scales. His clawed hands were gripping  the handle of his umbrella and each time he tapped the floor with it the entire  room shook.
“Let me talk to him.” Sherlock regarded Lestrade with a  fierce expression. “He’s not your killer but there’s a connection. He’s no  innocent bystander.”
“No!” Lestrade yelled,  leaping and transforming in mid-air into the form of a furious wolverine. He  drove his teeth into Lloyd’s disappearing tattoo and the man howled and  released John’s arm stumbling back as blood poured from the wound.
John took pity. “We get it Greg, no baiting the forensic  team or borrowing evidence, dragon’s honor, right Sherlock?” He favored  Sherlock with a pleading wide-eyed look as his tongue darted out to lick at his  lips.
Mycroft tutted. “Such a bother.” He swept the fox into his  arms and stepped off the edge of the building.
“Sherlock ...” John began,  troubled, but was silenced by a kiss. There was no further discussion  for a very long time.
Lloyd went limp, his hands dropping to  his sides. There was an unfathomable look in his eyes, a hint of  sadness, or maybe triumph, John wasn’t sure. And then he was gone,  winking out of existence, his top hat falling to the floor.
“I swear my oath and fealty to the  house of Dragon.” John said quietly. The temple hall was silent,  the fey not making a sound as the witnessed the scene unfolding  before them.
“A pleasure to see  you as well, John,” Mycroft’s voice echoed dryly from behind  them. “So lovely you can both be a part of our joyous day.”
“Look there’s no need for this!”  Lloyd croaked as his fingers scrabbled at the claws around his neck,  “You have to understand John, everything I’ve ever done, I’ve  done for you!”
Lestrade rested his head against Mycroft’s shoulder for a  moment then gazed up at Sherlock who was deathly pale and obviously attempting  to hide his worry behind puffs of smoke and lowered eyes. His expression went  soft. “I need paper lad. Lloyd left me a map and some directions in a language  I hope one of you knows because I sure as hell don’t.”
Lestrade favored Mycroft with a wink and bumped shoulders. “Only  my pride dragon boy. Getting that message out really did the trick. I’m feeling  much better. The pain is gone and I have two furry friends inside me who are  starting to feel awfully restless.” His grin turned predatory. “They want to hunt.”
“Mycroft,” Sherlock called over his  shoulder as he marched John down the aisle, “I simply want to  change into something less singed. After all I am a sanctioned prince  of the realm, you wouldn’t want me to make an impression that would  reflect badly on you.”
Sherlock frowned but nodded and dropped the bag into  Lestrade’s waiting hand. His eyes narrowed at the sound of slow clapping.
Sherlock’s cheeks were rimmed in blue scales and two tiny  horns  sat atop his head. John was aware that Sherlock sometimes lost his  grip on  human form when under stress. He found it adorable.
The pale, unblemished expanse of  Sherlock’s porcelain skin peeked out from the singed fabric of his  coat and shirt. There was no sign of injury.
“Enough,” He said in an even  tone, “the bonding is complete. The requirements are fulfilled.  Consider your answer carefully. Do you recognize the right of the  house of Dragon to ascend the throne?”
The man gave a deep bow sweeping the hat off his head with a  flourish. “Lloyd Artisian at your service gentlemen.”
John was rigid in Sherlock’s arms but managing to slowly  return to human form as Lloyd was led away swearing. Sherlock tightened his  grip around John once then let him go.
John grabbed Sherlock and hurled them  both to the side as a bright flare of fire shot from Lloyd’s  fingertips. Sherlock gasped and his eyes went wide as they sought  John’s. His lips parted as if to speak and then fell closed as he  slumped in John’s arms. A festering line of burnt flesh seared his  throat and his breaths while still strong were labored and pained.
John halted, tilting his head like a  flower striving to reach the warmth of the sun. Something about that  single word, the sound of that familiar voice, drew him from the  cocoon of his father’s overwhelming authority. He had to think.  There was something missing. His vision grew misty and he ran a hand  down his face. As his eyes cleared he reached out to cup the cheek of  the concerned face of Sherlock as it swam into view.
“He means thank you for the opportunity to assist in the  investigation.” John grinned up at Lestrade.
Sherlock was calm as he turned up the color of his coat and lowered  his piercing gaze on Lloyd’s sweating face. “More to the point, who has the  strength to break through a heavily warded police station? This is one of the  most secure buildings in the city. It would be interesting to know who or what  could overcome that.”
Sherlock hauled him back from the  scene by the collar of his coat, pulling John into his side and  breathing into his ear. “Best not to look too closely my Jaguar,”  he sighed, “they are not above reaching for things they cannot  have.” He glared at the altar over John’s shoulder as an echo of  laughter rang through the air.
Mycroft sneered through lengthening fangs. “He is mine  brother! You will not take away my chance to …”
“Ok sorry, sorry that was a stupid thing to say.” Lloyd  rolled away and clambered to his knees. His hands were bound behind his back  but at least his feet were free. John lay on his side eyeing him with evil  intent.
The Followers of the Mark stood between John and Sherlock  and John’s voice cut like honed steel. “Get out of my way.”
John glared back, balling his hands into fists. “You kicked  my friend and I out of the car at the back door to the theater and told us to  sneak in while you took the money mom gave us and went to the bar next door!”
“Come on,” Lestrade urged barreling past them and heading  for the front door, “I don’t know how long Sherlock and Mycroft can hold them  off.”
Tristram sneaks a look at Father and catches him glancing sideways at Tristram. They both smile sheepishly but hold still long enough for a quick inspection. Tristram stares at his father's pale irises, nearly colourless in the bright winter light reflecting off the snow. Is that really what Tristram's eyes look like? Not just the colour, but the intensity. The way they observe and absorb everything. The way they see all of Tristram's actions and intentions. The way they seem to bore right into and through him sometimes, burrowing into his brain and his heart. Is that what the woman - his mother - meant? Did she see that in Tristram's eyes too? Or did she just mean his eyes are the same indeterminate, cloudy grey as Father's?
"Come here," Sherlock says after a while, when John's breaths have become heavy and fast against Sherlock's neck, matching Sherlock's wafting into John's hair.
John was in a good mood all afternoon, laughing and joking. He sat next to Father on the way there so that Emily and Tristram could both ride facing forward, and at one point he and Father put their hands on top of each other on Father's leg, the same way they did in the car on the way to the airport the first time, before Mister Tonga was arrested. Tristram wouldn't have said John seemed particularly worried before, but now it was as if his whole body was lighter and his whole face kept pulling upward. Tristram began to see what Emily meant about how her father used to be, before her mother was killed.
While they're in the middle of eating, the doorbell rings. Doctor Watson goes to answer it, and Tristram hears his father's voice. Tristram can tell he's excited about something. He's speaking quite loudly, something about fingers, but his and Doctor Watson's voices fade to a muffled undertone as they go into the living room.
When Sherlock's taxi pulled up outside the cathedral ruins the following afternoon, he felt uncertain. He disliked being uncertain. Irritatingly, it seemed he was never anything but uncertain when it came to John. And yet he hadn't given up the experiment, hadn't given
Sherlock tossed the box at him and crawled on all fours up the bed - he had to tell Gladstone to stay down - with the lubricant in one hand, straddling John's legs, until he was poised with his face directly in front of John's. John slid his hands up under the pyjama shirt still hanging open around Sherlock's shoulders and caressed his bare skin. He licked his lips, his eyes flickering down to Sherlock's mouth and back up. Sherlock held his gaze, looked into his eyes as long as he could while he slowly closed the gap between their lips. The kiss that followed was so full of longing, desire, and tenderness, the intensity of the emotion (flood of hormones) Sherlock experienced so great, that a painful knot formed in his chest and he couldn't breathe for a moment.
"Let me see," he says briskly as he comes over to where Tristram is standing. Father is right behind him in his long, striped pyjama trousers.
When she speaks again, though, she does use English, with only a very light accent. "Are you with them?" she says. Obviously she means Father and Doctor Watson
Sherlock turned to him in affront, but before he could say anything, John looked to the pupils and said, "Here, try this," then sang, while accompanying himself with the keyboard set to chord mode:
Tristram wonders why in the world Father and Doctor Watson are texting each other when they are both right here. No doubt there is a logical explanation, but Tristram certainly doesn't see it.
Sherlock straightens and glances from the large tub to John with a sly look. "I believe it was made for that specific purpose." He's about to turn the water on when John puts out his hand to stop him.
Grandmother laughs, which makes her appear charming and young. "Oh, John, really, it's nothing to spoil dinner over. I only meant-"
Not because of some stupid rule of thumb or because it was just what people did, and not because either of them was sexually frustrated - Sherlock had gone for years without an assignation, his naturally low libido meaning that he rarely suffered from an unscratched itch in that area, and John was the one who had advised going slowly; it might be harder for him to wait than it was for Sherlock, but he wasn't only here for sex. Certainly there were easier ways to get it than to put up with Sherlock for weeks on end.
"Better than John did, apparently," Sherlock says coldly. "Now have I stumbled onto the set of Jeremy Kyle or do you actually want me to help you solve this case?"
"Maybe they wanted to clean their teeth first." That seems more reasonable. The toothpaste adverts on the telly are always going on about how they make your breath kissably fresh. Maybe they just didn't want to wait that long with taking turns.
The next day at school was pure torture. Sherlock had to physically restrain himself from getting anywhere near John, banning himself to sit behind his desk for the entirety of the morning lessons. He replied to John's greetings and comments in the briefest possible manner and kept his focus on the top of John's ear when speaking to him, in order to avoid meeting his eyes (or watching his mouth or lingering over the fine lines and creases in his face or letting his eye wander down into the space at the top of his collar, leading into the dark, warm place over his heart).
John and Mr Holmes both stood up when she came in, red-cheeked from the cold and patting down her staticky hair.
And then he'd exited sedately to his room. Left at a measured and controlled pace. All right, run away in a panic.
"Come on then, you two," a voice says from the living room. Tristram didn't even realise that Emily's Aunt Clara was standing there. By the time he looks back where his father was standing, the door is clicking shut.
"Yeah, we'll be right out," John says, smiling at her kindly and stepping away from the table. "Did you pick something good?"
He knows this isn't what Sherlock intended in following him here. He honestly did just want to stop John from making a tragic mistake, because John truly didn't have the whole picture. Not to mention the fact that John's impulsive, emotionally compromised, and more than a bit of an idiot.
"Maybe they'll end up looking like a map of the Underground!" Emily says. "Like on Dumbledore's knee. Look, this could be the Jubilee Line right here!" She traces her finger down Tristram's back. It tickles, and he twists away, laughing.
Sherlock lifts the covers and slides into the warmth beside John. John doesn't react until Sherlock turns onto his side and draws his knees up, brushing against John's leg. Then he stirs and makes a sleepy questioning sound.
Sherlock recovered quickly and shook his head. "Although I did once help out a Pakistani cab driver whose wife does an excellent kebap. I'm sure she could be persuaded. That would be the sub-continent ticked."
"Oh really, sex," Sherlock drawls dismissively. "How tedious. And here I thought we were going to discuss business, not engage in some fourteen-year-old locker room talk."
The next morning, Sherlock left the flat before John got up. He couldn't face either John remembering or John not remembering. It had not, he recalled, been a full moon last night, for whatever that was worth. He had to come back eventually, of course, but only after fortifying himself with a day of visiting his contacts and smoking half a pack of cigarettes.
Sherlock tugs his shirt out of his trousers and peels it off, dropping it behind him into the tub. John puts his hands on Sherlock's shoulders and runs them down his arms, his chest, his abdomen. He doesn't actually need to touch him to see that Sherlock's not injured anywhere else. Sherlock closes his eyes. John drops down into a crouch. His hands have ended up on Sherlock's hips, his thumbs barely brushing the skin above Sherlock's waistband. He waits until Sherlock opens his eyes again and looks down at him. John's smile is still there, playful and eager but mixed with something a bit darker too.
Tristram does remember. Emily's father used to have a limp and walk with a cane. But he hasn't used it in months now. Tristram has wondered from time to time how his leg suddenly got better.
Sherlock wraps his hand carefully around John's and holds it there on his chest. The thudding under John's fist becomes more frantic, if possible.
John had left early that morning so he could go home and change. Sherlock wondered whether John would consider it precipitous if Sherlock suggested he simply move his things over to Sherlock's house. He couldn't have much, not more than a couple of suitcases and boxes. They could probably fit everything into a taxi. They could do it that afternoon. He'd said 'long-term relationship' (not directly in relation to Sherlock, true, but the subtext had been there). He didn't mind the blood and the mud (not much, anyway). And if Sherlock offered to charge him less than John's current flat cost, he'd really have no reason to refuse. Sherlock would have let him live there for free, of course, but he knew John wouldn't stand for that. He took out his mobile to look up John's landlord and send off an enquiry.
After that, Doctor Watson explains about the GPS tracker, which will send a signal as long as the phone is turned on. He also goes through some scenarios with them of when it would be appropriate to use the phone: if the adult who's supposed to pick them up from school doesn't show up, if they get hurt while they're home alone - only something big, not just like a stubbed toe - and of course if someone they don't know tries to make them go with them. In that case, Doctor Watson says it's probably best if they don't even take the phone out of their pocket, but just push the call button and any one of the numbers. When their trusted adult answers and doesn't hear Tristram or Emily speak, they'll know something is very wrong and go to the internet site where they can track the phone.
Tristram feels the onset of a helpless panic. He doesn't know how to explain about all the bad things that might happen if he goes with her. He looks desperately at Doctor Watson, hoping at least he will understand.
Emily kind of is, almost, like a sister, Tristram thinks to himself. He doesn't say anything, though, because it sounds like she thinks the shop assistant was pretty stupid to have made that mistake. But she said herself once that if their fathers got married, they'd be brother and sister. Not that their fathers have any such plans - John said they'd tell Tristram and Emily if they ever did - but if their fathers are boyfriends, what does that make Tristram and Emily? Brother-friend and sister-friend? Sibling-friends? It is kind of funny. Tristram giggles a little too.
Sherlock dropped his cock out of the hold so he could encircle John more firmly, and blindly fumbled with his free hand to find John's nipple - the left one - and pinched, fairly hard. At the same time he gave him the filthiest kiss he could muster, while willing everything he was getting from John to reflect back through it.
"That's bullshit. I know you're cleverer than that." Sherlock raised his eyebrows at her. He'd never heard her either contradict him, or use any word stronger than 'poo'.
"Oh..." Right. She swiped self-consciously at her hair and became aware of a warm trickle oozing out of her. Not exactly appropriate for wandering the streets of central Glasgow at eleven PM. She supposed it would work this way as well. She'd just have to make sure they were very quick. In and out. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. She giggled, feeling slightly hysterical. "Okay, well, thanks. I'll just wait here then." She sat down gingerly on the edge of the bed and watched John finish getting dressed.
Sprinkle potatoes with flour and 2 teaspoons salt, then top with egg. With your hands, work flour and egg into a dough.
It's what he sees, though, that kicks ashes over those glowing embers, replacing them with a chilly kind of hollowness in his gut. Because Sherlock's chest does not look like John expected.
"All right, let's have the story then," John said once a bowl of square, puffy crackers, two glasses, and two bottles of sparkling water (direct import from Ethiopia, according to the label) were set between them.
Doctor Watson waits a moment to see if Tristram has anything to add, but he doesn't, so he nods and smiles at him. "That's good. Those boys not giving you any more trouble?"
"Oh that was just me trying things out," Mr Holmes said modestly. "Not sure I'll be doing any more. I haven't the dexterity for it, you see."
He worked for several minutes in silence even as I became more frequently vocal, hissing and panting my responses to his ministrations. He sometimes paused for quite some time to allow a goodly amount of wax to gather in the concave top of the candle. This might then be spilled in a single splash on my stomach that seared like a direct hit from a geyser of lava, or distributed in several smaller doses describing a molten figure across my pectoral. The barrage on my senses became almost overwhelming, and I lost all sense of time and proportion.
His father studies Tristram's face for a moment, as if trying to figure out how much Tristram already knows. "I don't know," he admits, finally. "We're as safe as we can be here, though. I don't want you to worry, but you should continue to be observant. I want you to come and tell me immediately if you notice anything that seems unusual in any way. Can I count on you to do that?"
John is still waiting for an answer. Tristram doesn't see what the point is of talking about it. It's over now. It was stupid - just like the thing with the curtain. He knows what John will say, anyway: the man out on the street wasn't Mister Tonga. Mister Tonga is in jail in England. And there wasn't anyone standing up behind any of those windows with a gun either. He knows all that. He knows it now, and he knew it when he was outside, too. That didn't stop his stupid heart from getting all scrambled and his stupid throat from cutting off his air supply.
John, unhelpfully, leaned in a bit. Sherlock could smell him now, the slight hint of coffee on his breath. He steeled himself not to show any reaction, instead keeping his focus on an incredibly useless memo regarding an upcoming visit from the nit nurse.
In the assembly hall, John was standing at the keyboard, with an easel pad facing the stage beside him. Although he couldn't see the front, Sherlock had no doubt the song lyrics were written on it, from the way Preeti and Bob were leaning forward to peer down at it as they struggled to get through the unfamiliar song. Sherlock cringed at how off-tune they were.
"God, Gladstone's going to watch, isn't he?" John muttered once they'd reached the landing. Everything was dark now, although there was enough light coming in through the windows for them to navigate by.
John keeps his phone on. Maybe he's sending another text. Tristram keeps his eyes on the glow as long as he can, but he's asleep before John turns his phone off.
"I have an erection, and I am perfectly capable of sustaining it through intercourse with you," he insisted hotly.
Tristram lifts his icicle in answer to the challenge and taps it gingerly against hers. The tip of her icicle breaks off anyway. Tristram feels bad and is about to apologise when Emily laughs and taps her icicle against his, rather more forcefully. Another chunk of hers falls off. Tristram gamely hits her icicle again, as he gathers that's the game, and this time his is the one that ends up being shortened. And then it's a wild back and forth of blows exchanged as their icicles get progressively smaller and smaller. Finally, they're both holding little more than stubs and no matter how much they bash them against each other, neither one cracks.
Mr Holmes pointed out a plaid, plastic-backed picnic blanket rolled up on top of an unused cooler. John dialed emergency services with one hand and tucked the blanket around Mr Holmes with the other.
John, to his credit, didn't back away, although he did falter. "There's- Sorry, what does that mean?"
"Your dad is so cool," she says wistfully. "I can't wait to come to your house and see the frozen foot."
"I haven't, but look at the picture." Sherlock gestured at the DVD case. "American military court, hero, villain, token non-objectified female, and there-" He leaned forward to flip it over. "Scapegoats. The hero has something to prove, but he's inexperienced and always relies on the same tricks. It looks like the villain's going to get away with it, until the hero decides to take a gamble, likely at the urging of the woman, causing the villain to choke on his own hubris. The scapegoats take the fall anyway."
John turned around, raising his eyebrows, because it really wasn't. Half the class looked guilty and the other half embarrassed.
"Yeah, I think I just need a little space right now. There's probably something here I'm just not seeing, but I don't... I'll call you, all right?" He was speaking too lightly; he should be yelling or swearing or hitting something, not this controlled politeness.
Doctor Watson holds a hand up to Emily to stop her chatter for a moment. "Yeah?" He looks over, his eyebrows raised expectantly.
John lets himself collapse into an armchair. "God. He ditched me, either got himself caught or snuck in somehow, I don't know, but he ended up face down on the floor over there with a gun pointed at the back of his head."
"Okay. Yes, okay." His answer quick now, almost impatient. Sherlock stood up, letting the comforter drop back on to the couch. On the way across the living room, he crashed into a chair.
been under a great deal of pressure to succeed, living as he had in the shadow of Mycroft the Magnificent. Maybe he had been afraid he wouldn't live up to his family's expectations - although to be perfectly honest, maybe they had only been his own expectations. He'd known he would never be a world-class violinst; Moriarty's taunt about Perlman was an astute dig. And so what would the point have been of completing the course of study? Viewed in that way, it could be that he'd set himself up to fail spectacularly. At least in that, he'd made sure of being the best.
Five minutes later, John stepped out of the bathroom. He had stripped to his pants and vest and done a hasty prep just in case. Sherlock was frantically humping empty air as he bounced his stuffed arse up and down on the bed, unable to come without any direct stimulation. His hair was sweaty and disheveled, and his face was contorted as if in pain. One of the nipple clamps had come off, and the chain was now slack enough that his cock, though still attached to the spreader bar by the ring around it, was slapping freely against his abdomen as he thrashed. John quickly checked that no damage had been done and unclipped the other clamp too, then circled to the foot of the bed and released Sherlock's ankles from the spreader bar.
I tried to conceal my discomfiture behind the niceties of offering food and drink, which he politely accepted, even though I could see he had already breakfasted on the train. I kept stealing glances at him, still half convinced he would disappear if I turned my back for longer than a moment. I said before that he looked well, but that would be like saying the Koh-i-Noor looked shiny, although I confess I might not be the most impartial observer. To my eye, the marks of age had settled on him like a refining patina. The dashes of silver in his hair were elegant, the fine lines around his eyes like the smooth grain of polished wood. I marveled to have him here before me, but feared the reason for it. It must be something quite ominous indeed to bring him out here without warning.
Sherlock lifted himself up enough to work the hide down over his hips. The sling he wore to contain and protect his own genitals was bulging and when John pulled the one end out of the strap around his waist, he groaned in relief. John folded the leather down out of the way so he could wrap his hand fully around Sherlock. The days when this had seemed odd or awkward were long forgotten. Sherlock's hot, hard flesh in his palm, the smooth, spongy head now moist with the precursor of Sherlock's own essence, Sherlock's scent in his nostrils, his deep voice rumbling his pleasure in John's ear - it all made John's chest pound with the rhythm of devotion and throat ache with the knowledge that that devotion was returned.
Tristram wouldn't normally jump at the chance to visit the beach on a cold, rainy November afternoon, but so far, Doctor Watson and Emily have managed to make nearly everything fun. This will certainly be no exception.
Tristram straightens up. He just came to the same conclusion. He can hear their heavy breaths behind the curtain. The light flashes a third time. Tristram steps away from the booth. Father doesn't like anyone to see them kiss. Tristram still isn't sure how he feels about it, himself. The light flashes once more for the final picture.
"Well, Tris," Doctor Watson says. "We've very much enjoyed having you. You're welcome to come over any time at all, if it's okay with your father." He looks up at Tristram's father.
Further, and of utmost importance, Sherlock would not allow himself to be attracted to or distracted by John. There was no point. He had certainly misinterpreted John's friendly overtures, and at any rate, Sherlock had no desire for any sort of emotional or physical entanglement. Although he might, possibly, be willing to sit at the same table with John during break time and interrogate him about his past experiences. Or even, if the aforementioned interrogation yielded positive and interesting results, to engage in a more extended interview over lunch.
Tristram isn't quite as excited. He wants to be excited - he's never gone on an honest-to-goodness holiday before, much less with Father. Summers at Grandmother's don't count because that's just visiting Grandmother and he knows everything there already. It's just that he was awake most if not all of the previous night, worrying about Father, and his back is sore, both from sitting for so long and from the pressure on his half-healed cuts, and he was expecting sunshine and mountains and cows and chocolate, and it's all so
After that it was my mouth which again captured his attention, and I eagerly returned his interest, becoming bolder in my vocal approval and encouragement. This appeared to please him greatly, and he tangled his fingers in my hair to hold my head in place that he might drink his fill of the murmurs I exhaled into his waiting mouth. His alpha member was like a rod of iron across my groin, my own crushed against his hip bone as he ground into me. He slid one hand between our chests to abrade my nipple with the hard-edged bits of dried wax that clung there, rolling them around and digging them in, sending electric jolts through my chest and into my gut to amplify the pulsating beat in my loins.
Anyway, back to the experiment. So far, John didn't seem to suspect anything. He'd been surprised the first couple of times - granted, he probably didn't even remember the first couple of times, he'd been so far gone - but it had almost become something of a ritual now. When John stumbled unsteadily into the flat, murmured a greeting and headed directly for the loo, Sherlock would calmly remove the glass vial from his pocket - having secreted it there earlier when he deduced John would be out imbibing - take a glass from the drainboard and put three careful drops into the bottom. Then he would put the glass back on the counter and wait until John emerged.
“What the hell are you doing here?” John’s face settled into  a furious frown. “You shouldn’t be able to set foot within ten thousand kilometers  of London.”
Lestrade grabbed Lloyd’s arm and pushed him toward the door  while John distracted their foes but the man twisted in his grasp pulling  Lestrade down in a tangle of limbs.
Mycroft called from his seat on an  antique sofa as he sipped delicately from his own glass and perused  an array of fabric samples. “Now, now John no need to be crude.  There are things we all must endure for crown and country.”
Lestrade emitted a pointed cough. “I’m so glad you approve  of the killer’s methods Sherlock. Perhaps you’d like to tell me how he  infiltrated a fifth degree shield of power? Our own mages haven’t been able to  so much as punch a pinhole through the thing. ”
“Yeah, no.” Greg hauled Lloyd to his side and gripped his  arm with nails that were growing long and sharp. “That’s not going to happen.  So… I’m Detective Inspector Lestrade and you lot are …”
Greg turned wide eyes on his  husband-to-be. “Will she? Oh my gods, suddenly this whole thing is  worth it.”
“What the hell is he talking  about?” John exclaimed, rounding on Sherlock, “We’re already in  suits! What more do they want?”
The priest cleared its throat and  resumed its litany of platitudes and exhortations. Sherlock pulled  John closer and brushed a kiss against his cheek. “John,” he  breathed, “this seems a bit drawn out even for my brother’s usual  level of disregard for the patience of his audience.”
“We are the Followers of the Mark.” The three robed figures  appeared to grow and shift into half shadow as they arranged themselves around Lloyd  and John.
John squared his shoulders, ignoring  the agony of his arm as he faced his father. “What the hell are you  talking about?”
Lloyd turned so fast Lestrade saw only a blur before the  image of the man grasping John’s right arm came into focus.
“I don’t –“ Lestrade whispered but was interrupted by a low,  rumbling laughter that grew in volume until the courtyard rang with the smarmy  syllables of it.
Sherlock ignored Lestrade and approached the circle while  raising a gloved hand. He stopped a meter short of the perimeter and parted his  lips, shooting a narrow stream of blue flame that crawled along the edge of the  circle, growing and shifting until it seemed to encase the figure within.  Sherlock closed his eyes, clenched his fingers and pulled.
“Sh! God damn it that hurt.” Lestrade worked himself to a  sitting position and clutched his head between shaking hands.
The man dismissed John’s dangerous body language, his grin  widening. He leaned in and sniffed then raised an eyebrow. “Well, well. Looks  like things have changed since the last time we saw each other. Just what  exactly have you been up to Johnny boy?”
Lloyd hid his surprise behind a grin. “Ah inspector I like a  man who gets right to the point. I was there to meet a friend. Unfortunately  someone else found him first.”
The fox tossed his head back to make sure Mycroft was watching  then leapt against one of the station’s emergency exits shoving down on the  handle with a fisted paw. His small body swung as the door opened with a crash  and he was flung into the air where he curved gracefully and made a perfect  landing on all four feet. He paused once to sniff then sped up the stairs towards  the roof.
The robed figures bent their heads together murmuring words  too low to hear then straightened. “You are the son.”
The fox rose up on two hind legs and rubbed his head against  the trouser leg of Mycroft’s expensive suit leaving a trail of fine silvery  hairs. He chittered and snickered then took off like a shot, leaping through  the open doorway of the office and nuzzling the carpet of the dusty corridor  until he caught Sherlock’s scent and sneezed.
OK so his worthless shit of a father was back in town and he  always had plans for John. Too bad the man didn’t realize who he was dealing  with. He wasn’t an abandoned child any more or a young man desperate for  validation. He was a healer, a warrior and a predator who had a dragon on his  side. Daddy had no idea what was coming and John was looking forward to  delivering the news.
John rolled his eyes and swept his gaze  around the temple. The pews were empty. “Hey,” he declared,  “where did everybody go?”
“Wish I could choose which one.” Lestrade clapped a hand on  John’s shoulder who responded with a half-hearted chuckle. “See you at the  yard.”
John whirled about, his face going red with anger. “Shut up  Sherlock! It’s not – it’s none of your business. Just – shut it.” He pushed  Sherlock out of the way and stormed up the stairs into the room Sherlock had  turned into a make-shift lab. He slammed the door behind him, wincing at the  sound of a beaker falling and shattering against the floor.
Greg rolled his eyes and tightened  his grip on Mycroft’s hand as the high priest droned on about  responsibility and honor and uniting the realm. Greg stifled a snort.  Frankly, most of the glimpses he’d stolen of their restless  audience had only revealed barely contained looks of calculation or  irritation. He was pretty sure there were a few glares of outright  hostility but those he could deal with. It was the subtler arts of  back stabbing and manipulation he was not so comfortable with.  Luckily Mycroft excelled at that sort of thing. Not for the first  time he had to admit they did make a good team.
John and Sherlock made quite the  pair as they marched down the carpet. John was dressed in a sleek  blue uniform that clung to his body like a second skin. From the way  Sherlock kept stealing glasses at his ass he was pretty sure the  pants were leaving nothing to the imagination. Sherlock wore a dove  grey mourning coat over a tight white shirt and well fitted trousers,  with shiny black boots and a top hat to complete the ensemble. John  couldn’t wait to peel it off of him.
“Mmmmm….Sherlock did you try  this? It’s amazing.” John asked, his voice muffled behind the  curtain, sounded dreamy and strangely compliant.
Sherlock looked worried, almost afraid. It wasn’t an  expression John was used to seeing and he couldn’t help reaching out to smooth  back a wayward curl. “I’m sorry Sherlock. I just – I’m sorry.”
John emerged from the stairwell into chaos and threw himself  to one side as several bodies came flying down the hallway as if they were a  discarded ball of rags flung with great force. Behind him Lloyd muttered  ancient words under his breath and Lestrade shouted and cursed. A great ball of  fiery white light filled the small space and John squeezed his eyes shut and  plastered himself against the wall. When he pried his lids open a few seconds  later they were alone.
Shouts filled the air and robed figures poured through the  doorway brandishing long staves and flinging daggers which bounced off the  dragons’ rock hard scales. Lestrade hid behind an enormous leathery wing and  shrank down into his fox form then raced between the feet of the combatants  deliberately tripping up a few as he leaped through the shattered doorway and  ran down a long hall.
Lloyd rounded on John throwing up his hands. “Hey I took you  to those movies Johnny boy and as I recall you loved them!”
Tendrils of gray, oily smoke seeped from Lloyd’s ruined flesh  and then exploded outward shattering the blue bubble and flinging the  inhabitants several feet away and to the ground.
Lloyd pouted and pointed a finger at  his son. “Oh come on Johnny boy would you really choose two old  lizards and a freakish two-shifter rather than your old man? And  after all I’ve done for you too! Really Johnny, it breaks my heart,  it really does.”
“You left those two upstairs alone? Are you nuts?” John  favored Lestrade with a disapproving look and pushed past him heading for the  stairs.
“Sherlock!” His name was called from across a great distance  and he struggled to follow it. “Dammit Sherlock what have I told you about  reckless tampering with unknown magic!” The voice sounded more concerned than  angry and Sherlock blinked as John’s anxious face swam into focus.
Mycroft kissed his intended gently  on the cheek. “How nice to know where your priorities lie my dear.”
John rolled his shoulders and allowed the broken zip ties  that once bound his hands to fall to the floor. He ran his fingers through his  thick blond hair. “How bloody surprising you’ve been here before.”
“See for yourself.” John’s hand fell away as Sherlock  stepped forward and examined the now broken circle. The body lay on its side  and the green haze was fading fast.
“We claim the right of retribution.” The sonorous voices  filled the room and echoed off the walls until it sounded like a multitude  chanting in perfect rhythm. “We are here for you lost one.”
“The dungeons under the Hall of the Mark. Don’t bother  trying anything they’re power dampened.” Lloyd sniffed the air. “We’re in the  southwest corner not that far from the furnace where they burn the trash. The  guard comes by ever hour or so. Nice chap as long as you don’t mention the  ex-hubby who owns the pub. It’s OK to talk about the ex-wife though.”
“It was a curious choice of weapon  against a dragon,” Sherlock mused, “we are, after all, creatures  of fire.”
Sherlock turned his great head and peered at John out of the  corner of his eye. The beast grinned and pounced on John, holding him tight to  his chest as he leapt into the air.
John stepped back but Sherlock was  there to hold him, as if knowing he was the only thing keeping John  from fleeing.
“What did you do to him?!” He shouted at the Followers of  the Mark who climbed to their feet and stood watching them.
Sherlock didn’t bother containing his glee. “The circle is  unbroken. The attack was somehow launched from within the victim’s defenses.  This is brilliant John!”
“Sweet dreams  Inspector.” Lloyd grinned then yelped as the handcuffs growled and bit down  hard. “Oi get off me you lot or I swear your foxy wolverine over there is never  going to wake up!”
“I don’t care what your grand plans  are,” John replied his lips thinning into a grim line, “I don’t  want to know how you justify what you did to my mother or to me. You  are nothing to me.”
Before John could answer he stumbled  into Sherlock as a loud crack sounded and the temple floor gave a  sharp jerk. The air turned several degrees colder as Mycroft returned  his umbrella to the crook of his arm and smiled pleasantly as he  turned to face the congregation.
He crowded John into the wall, caging  him between his arms and settling his nose into the crook of his  neck. He took a breath, inhaling deeply. “John.”
That's a reasonable question. Father does a lot of his investigations through the computer and his phone, but when it really comes down to it, he's best tracking down leads in person. But Father isn't the only one working on it this time.
It is of a newborn infant cradled in someone's arms; John's, Sherlock realises immediately. The picture shows only his chest and arms, but his wedding ring is visible on the hand that's caressing the baby's — Gloria's — cheek. He is wearing a blue hospital smock, the kind they give you to toss on over your street clothes. It was an emergency C-section. They'd gone for a regular non-stress test in the thirty-first week and found Gloria was struggling. Her heart rate was erratic and dropping dangerously low. In the picture, she is wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue and pink stripes around the edges. All of the monitoring equipment has been removed. John's hand obscures half of her face, but Sherlock can still see that her skin tone is too grey, her body too limp.
"Everything all right with Watson?" Sherlock's arm reached out from under the comforter he had wrapped around himself and felt for the monitor.
Sherlock laughed without humour and veered off the main road toward the river. "I actually did that once, in the middle of an end-of-term exam."
John tamped down his own burgeoning frustration. He needed to be in charge here, maintain a clear head. If he was frustrated, he could only imagine how Sherlock was feeling. "You're doing so well," he said again. "Just a little more. You're almost there. Maybe let me take a peek, though, yeah? Make sure everything's as it should be?" When Sherlock was like this, he didn't always pay attention to all of his body's signals. That was what John was here for.
"Not him exactly... " Tristram qualifies his statement. "The light from his cigarette. It looked the same as-" He stops. He's not supposed to tell that he saw him in the stable. Although it won't really matter now, will it? It's not as if anything bad happened because he was sitting in there smoking rather than standing somewhere outside in the rain during his shift. Still, Tristram hedges and says, "The same as at Grandmother's. In the building across the street." He nods at the window overlooking the street.
Doctor Watson's face crumples a little and he reaches out to take hold of Tristram's good hand. "Tris, you know, no matter what, your father loves you. You are the most important thing in his life. Nothing is going to change that. Nothing."
Later, at the knife company's visitor's centre, Father sat at the pocket knife assembly station with Tristram on his lap and helped him work the machine because Tristram couldn't do it himself with one hand in a cast. It was almost like sitting together on the toboggan, except it was quieter and there wasn't any wind taking his breath away. And he and Father talked while they put the knife together, discussing what the best tools would be and why. Father said it was too bad there wasn't a wire or something that could be used as a lock-pick, but when they got home he'd add one for him.
He lifted his bright eyes to mine, glittering in the light of the fire that burned in the hearth at his feet. He still bore the traces of the violent encounter which had been intended to put a final end to his dealings with Baron Gruner: his cheek a livid purple, his ear stitched and scabbed, his lip still puffed up where his own tooth had pierced it. His body had been spared larger insult both by his thick overcoat and the fact that his cowardly attackers had focused the brunt of their efforts on his formidable skull. In itself that pattern was a sure signal that their intent had been murderous rather than warning in nature. It was only due to Holmes' prodigious skill with his fists and stick that he was sitting before me, battered but alive, rather than moldering with the rest of Gruner's victims.
"I don't think about it, mostly," he says with an attempt at a smile. Mostly. Which means he never explicitly dwells on it, but it's always there, a yawning, shadowy nebula surrounding his entire mind space, like whatever it is that extends beyond the furthest reaches of what Tristram imagines when he tries to picture the infinity of the universe.
"I didn't have my phone. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have gone with her," Tristram mumbles against the coat.
If this were Baker Street, he wouldn't think twice about someone passing by - or even lingering for a cigarette - outside his window, but this is all private property. In his mind, he runs through the people he knows of who might be here by rights - Grandmother, Mrs Bowen, one of the gardeners - but it's pretty late for any of the staff to be around, and anyway, any of them would be on the path proper. It occurs to him that it might be his father, poking around in the underbrush, or just gone outside for a smoke. Although he almost always stands on the terrace outside the green parlour to smoke when they're here. And then it occurs to him even more strongly that his father told him to report anything unusual to him right away.
"That it was time to put an end to all your male posturing. He would have played that game forever if you'd let him." She smooths her dress. "And now it's your turn, darlings."
Finally, John speaks in a low voice: "We used to watch Emily sleep for hours, when she was a baby. Me and Mary," he clarifies. "It was like we couldn't believe this little bundle was really alive, and that she'd wake up again all on her own."
"It's like the engine for the time machine. It runs on plutonium. Do you think your dad could get us some?"
He is suddenly dizzy. Automatically, he reaches out for something to hold onto so he doesn't topple over. It turns out to be a rack of postcards on display outside a shop. It feels like his throat is closed off. He can't breathe. It's like the other morning, when Emily had the curtains open. But now it's not just the feeling of something being wrong; it's that there are people all around him, and he doesn't know which ones are the good guys and which are the bad guys. He wants to run, or hide, or just get away, but he's paralysed by the tightness in his chest. Someone grabs his arm. He cries out - a strangled sound, not nearly loud enough to alert anyone to his distress - and tries to jerk away, but the person's hold is too tight.
"You and Emily can come too." Father said he wanted them to. Well, he said John, but surely Emily was included.
Unbidden, a grainy image formed in Mycroft's mind as if recorded by a hypothetical hidden camera. A darkened room, two forms moving beneath the sheets. Faint words and sighs. Another scene with one shadowy figure on its knees, the other on hands and knees, grunts punched out of lungs, the sounds of skin slapping skin. The living room was a likely venue as well. The two chairs. In broad daylight. The couch, where he himself had sat. Hadn't there been that greasy spot? Mycroft came to he sudden, horrifying realisation that no surface in their flat, horizontal or vertical, was likely to have remained unsullied. He resolved to send John Watson a bottle of Glen Elgin in reward for his foresight, along with several bottles of Domestos. Let Sherlock explain it to him.
Sherlock closes his eyes and imagines his own heavy breathing is John's, his huffs of laughter giving way to stuttering, muffled grunts. Those little involuntary sounds that flew right into the empty spaces in Sherlock's heart, their wings fluttering and beating in his chest, a descant to the racing of his pulse. This is why, this right here is why he should never allow himself to give in, because those spaces are hollow and gaping and there is nothing left to fill them. No winks over severed limbs, no toes brushing his under the table at breakfast, no footsteps pounding in rhythm with his, no breathless whispers against his neck. His own hand is a poor substitute for the one he wants. He's never been good at denying himself what he wants.
Sherlock spreads his fingers to allow John's to slot down in between them. "I would advise against it. At least until this is dealt with."
John and Tristram kind of sat there and gawped at him. Emily grinned and plucked the book out of her father's limp hands and shuffled forward to hand it to Father.
"No," Sherlock spoke over him, "I meant, you need to feel useful. You want to feel useful. That... job at the school. That wasn't you. These." Sherlock gestured at the phone. "These are you."
"Tris and Sherlock have something special planned," her father explains, tilting his head toward Father, who is now leaning against the counter with his arms crossed, watching them.
. The other side is unaffected?" Sherlock pushed the vest up on the left as well, and really, all of these layers were getting tedious. While there was a certain appeal to the slow strip and discovery of new John-vistas in manageable chunks, he needed to have the entire area uncovered. The sooner the better.
An hour sitting next to John, even in the roomy back seat of one of Mycroft's town cars. This new, palpable sense of feeling their way through this thing taking shape between them. Lines being redrawn. Butterflies. Not productive. John set out down the stairs. Sherlock followed.
Tristram is about to remind Doctor Watson of that, when he sees something funny on Doctor Watson's jacket, which he never took off. At first, Tristram thinks it's an insect, but it's moving too jerkily. Then it resolves into a light, just a little pinprick that dances erratically around on the black material covering Doctor Watson's back. And suddenly, Tristram knows with sickening certainty what that is. He tries to say something, to cry out, but his voice is stuck in his throat. Doctor Watson is still standing there, railing at Father, but Tristram doesn't hear him anymore. He has to do something!
