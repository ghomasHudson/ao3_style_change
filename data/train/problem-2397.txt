"There is nothing you can do." The hunter said, trying to keep the frustration out of his voice. The trip had his nerves more than a little fried, and he knew it wasn't Kevin's fault.
Still. He wasn't surprised when Cas stood and walked to the sink to fill a glass with water. Neither of them commented on it.
Dean slipped his phone back into his sweatpants pocket, staring at the cat. He heaved one last put-upon sigh. "Alright Backpack. I guess you're staying."
"Nah." Dean replied. "Figured we'd get breakfast on the road then head over to Tom's and see what parts he has on hand for the impala." He flashed a grin. "I told you I'd teach you how to fix her up."
surprised. Dean possessed the amazing ability to adjust his sleep level to suit the requirements of the night. If he felt safe, truly safe (as was so rare), Dean would sleep like the dead, and waking him was like pulling a man from a coma. On a normal night, Dean was more aware of his surroundings, ready to respond to potential dangers. And then there was the hair-pin level of rest he allowed himself if he was looking after a sick or injured Sam. Cas had to guess that Dean was treating this situation similarly.
Crowley looked up at the older Winchester, straightening up from where he was leaning against a post. "Trouble in paradise?"
"Hey, I'll ask him, and if he doesn't feel up to it, I'll head out on my own, but I'm going to give him the choice." Dean lied.
"Yes. Though at the moment I cannot see deep into his thoughts. It is too strongly obscured by pain and terror."
"Sam was knocked unconscious when he attempted to banish the angels. I took control. When Malachi ordered torture, I remained."
Dean squeezed his good arm quickly in a show of support before he began to check the gauze to be sure the injury hadn't bled through the wrapping. Once he was satisfied with that he grabbed the thermometer off the table and pressed it to Cas' forehead, waiting for the telltale beep. "Well, that's a little better." He said with a nod, showing Cas the 101 degree reading.
Dean sank back against the headboard, crossing his arms over his chest and grumbling out loud where Cas couldn't hear him. He tried to sort out his own dismay from Cas' satisfaction.
It would be almost two months after the incident with Metatron when the other shoe finally did fall. Crowley had called with a request for help and the brothers responded, leaving the angels and prophet behind. Once they had Crowley sorted, they were on the path to the first blade. Cas had offered to come meet them, but Dean insisted they had it covered. That evening Sam walked down from the garage alone, setting his coat over the back of one of the chairs and sitting at the map room table with a heavy sigh.
Dean leaned back in his chair, swinging his legs up onto another. "I'm working on a shopping list, so let me know if you guys have anything to add."
The hunter dropped the cloth in a metal bucket in the corner, and poured the rest of the lighter fluid to soak through. When it was fully saturated, he took the time to properly wrap and tie the denim strips around the broom handle. He sat back, satisfied. "That ought to last longer than last night."
"Nah." Dean replied. "Figured we'd get breakfast on the road then head over to Tom's and see what parts he has on hand for the impala." He flashed a grin. "I told you I'd teach you how to fix her up."
Dean looked back, seeing Sam already down and walking through the door of the bunker. He sprung into action, quickening his pace to try and catch up. He ducked through the door, starting down the stairs after him. "Sam wait-"
"I don't know what happens to an angel now that they have fallen from heaven." Cas admitted. "Before, yes. Angels landed fairly close to those banished with them."
Dean rolled his eyes. "So yeah, we're just peachy. Looked at Cas' x-rays. His breaks aren't too bad. Ordered a boot, he should be able to hobble around when it comes."
Cas held up one hand, his other coming to touch his nose expectantly. Dean paused with Cas before the angel rolled his eyes slightly, remembering that his angelic healing didn't work. He dropped his hand.
"I see." Cas stepped forward, putting his hand on the angel's shoulder, the flesh knitting back together. He stepped back, feeling an intense wave of vertigo, but he masked it well. "This wound was not so grievous as your last. Your ability to heal should return to you in the days coming."
It was just past three in the morning when Dean was thrust back into consciousness. He didn't remember falling asleep. He found his mind reeling, and his limbs moved accordingly, completely disoriented. He felt a presence against his left, and he scrambled sideways, reacting before taking in all the information. A quick feel under the pillow and it was clear his weapon was gone. Next best thing, he threw his fist with as much force as he could muster before jumping to his feet to gain the upper hand.
Dean shifted, straightening up to stand. "You can be pissed at me, you can take a swing, whatever you need. You want me to go, I'll walk right out that door. But please… just let Gadreel finish his work before you kick him out."
Cas fell silent, feeling not for the first time inadequate. Since the fall, he had been witness to too many struggles of the Winchesters that his former self could have corrected handily. He once again felt an immense guilt settle in on his shoulders.
Dean stepped back, simply pulling on his jeans where he stood. He threw the shirts over the back of the chair, opting to sit back down without putting them on.
Cas shut his mouth, feeling a flash of hot shame as he was reminded that Dean wasn't wrong. He watched Dean pull a box out from under the workbench, starting to pull varying chains out. He set his mouth, trying to watch Dean for any indication of what exactly he was doing.
Sam was in the library, a glass of whisky in hand when Castiel joined him. He wasn't too surprised to see Cas without his brother. "Dean?"
The pain ignited like a wave from his torso through his limbs and head, and for a second it even blotted out the burn from the mark. He sputtered, already tasting the faint iron at the back of his throat.
"You were going to leave when you thought you could lock the angels upstairs. Hell, You wouldn't even be here if Naomi hadn't dragged your ass out of purgatory. You left me for good, remember? So don't tell me you wouldn't."
Cas studied him thoughtfully. "Isn't being put in danger something wrong with the way you were raised?"
Frowning, Cas wrestled with the decision before finally deciding to intervene. "Dean." He said, keeping his voice soft. When it didn't work, he cleared his throat and called out again, raising his volume. "Dean."
The angel once more wrapped his arms around the hunter, starting to drag him from the room, using a considerable amount of his waning angelic strength to avoid being brought to the ground with Dean as he thrashed. He looked sternly towards Gadreel, but the angel was already on the ground beside Sam, a hand coming up to heal him.
Dean pulled a face at him before rolling his eyes. "Yeah whatever." He paused, his brain mulling through the problem.
"I turned on the GPS on his phone… you should be able to follow it. It says we're somewhere near Carver, Massachusetts?"
"Uncomplicated." Sam admitted. "It felt good. A problem with a straightforward solution. No surprises."
"Well no, you can't do that." Dean was in disbelief for a second, as shock didn't allow him to fully process the threat. "Sam's not well enough, if you leave his body-"
He tried to find any speck of this feeling in his expression, but Cas really did just look as neutral as he always did. He couldn't reconcile the strength of those emotions with the stoic exterior.
"Save it." He shook his head. "You'd suffer, even die for your beliefs, I get it. But is Metatron," He turned to Theo with a smirk "whose poll numbers have totally tanked," back to Cas, "really worth your life? More importantly, is it worth
Sam stepped forward, pressing two fingers to his brother's neck. He was reassured by the steady heartbeat he got in return. He made a hasty retreat when Dean stirred.
Dean turned, looking at the angel finally. Castiel's expression was entirely unreadable and his tone was unwavering. "Is that what you want?"
"Wait till you see the snacks we have for the drive. I think you'll be impressed." Dean tossed a large bag onto the bed next to Cas.
Cas put a hand on Dean's shoulder. "Dean, something is wrong with you. Very wrong. And until we figure out how to fix this, you have to stay here."
"Good." Dean replied, slightly too quickly. They lapsed into silence for a few minutes, and Dean felt completely out of his element. "Yeah, not just this, I mean, how are you… holding up?"
Sam barely looked up as he heard the angel round the corner into the library, oblivious to his distress. He absently turned over a second tumbler, pouring Cas a drink. It was an empty gesture, but one he knew his brother often extended. "We are going to call Crowley." He said, hoping his voice conveyed more confidence than he felt.
Cas grunted, snapping his book shut. "Fine." He relented, not willing to put up a fight about something so trivial. He got to his feet and walked into the other room, emerging again with a rice crispy treat. He sat back down, pulling it open and taking a bite in front of Dean.
Dean's expression fell just the slightest, as he absorbed that information. Cain had managed his anger… he managed to get out and control the mark… and even he cracked. He forced himself to let go of it, focusing back on his brother.
start." Dean rolled his eyes. "I am already dreading the lecture I'm going to get from Sam about this. He paused. "But I will."
"I fell to earth with the rest of the angels… It was a fresh start." He turned to look at Dean. "When I heard your prayer, I saw an opportunity to do good."
"Ice can get the best of anyone." She stopped talking for a few, taking a set of vitals on Dean and relaying it through her walkie. "You know if he has any medical conditions? Any allergies?"
Cas held him close, trying to keep him steady as the impala lurched down the back roads, racing towards the nearest hospital. He held his hand over Dean's, keeping it pressed down on the wound, trying to hold as much blood in as possible.
Dean cursed. "Do. Not. Move. We are on the way to you." the hunter was already pulling open the door.
." Dean frowned however, feeling an emotion pass through Cas he didn't fully understand. Coupled with the small uncharacteristic smirk, he wasn't sure he liked where it was going.
"I'm sorry I screwed up." The words passed his mouth before his sluggish brain caught up. He clenched his fists, thinking over the events again. "I went in as backup, and I got caught. Instead of getting you out, I just got you into this fucking mess."
Dean tried to dive in, willing himself as hard as he could to be able to grab one of the attackers, but his hands pushed right through them. He was forced to step back and simply watch how this fight ended up, a sick feeling settling in his stomach. He tried to brace himself.
His punch was met with a muffled grunt of pain, and the lamp at the bedside table was flicked on. Dean's racing thoughts began to finally catch up with his surroundings. Bare walls, empty desk… this wasn't his room. This was Cas' room. And the bloodied face blinking up at him was… "Cas." He breathed, moving forward and grimacing. "Shit… sorry."
Cas slipped his braced arm out of the sling, shrugging it aside. He carefully stretched out to replace Sam's hand holding the mask around the older hunter's mouth and nose, using his good hand to take over compressing the rubber bag. Sam withdrew from the bed, hurrying back out of the room to gather supplies.
His eyes snapped open when he heard Sam enter the room. He lifted his head, looking up at the younger hunter as he walked and sat in the chair beside the bed. He had a book in his hand.
"Dean said that cat would be a good name for it. Swahili is the language that I believe gives that title the most pleasant sound."
As bad as Dean was feeling, he wasn't alone in those thoughts. He sighed, letting his barriers down the slightest amount, allowing himself not to force a smile, and instead clapped Cas on the shoulder. "Come on, get your jacket. Let's go for a ride." He looked around, bringing his voice down a touch. "Don't tell Sam, he'll just worry." Or rather his angel co-pilot would.
Cas closed his eyes. He flinched as a hand extended, brushing against the side of his face. He repressed the urge to lean into it. He didn't expect this. He had been certain his grace would burn out before he ever again saw the hunter. His instincts were split between desperation for Dean and revulsion at the twisted thing he'd become. He was surprised when he felt himself pulled into an embrace.
The crash and splintering of wood coupled with the grunt of pain from upstairs sent Cas running, only to be thrown back through a bookshelf himself. Before Cas even got the chance to right himself, the ghost was up in flames. The angel wasted no time pulling himself up and taking the steps two at a time to reach the room he heard Dean from. He froze in the doorway for just a moment before throwing himself to the hunter's side.
Cas let the silence fall back in place. The two settled in for the long wait through the night, mentally preparing themselves for the battle they faced at dawn.
"You can read my mind, right? You can see my thoughts? Take them." He tried to convince himself he wasn't pleading.
"Nothing we don't have here at the bunker. I'll need some of your blood, and his." Sam sighed. "I don't know if this will work."
Dean leaned his head back weakly. He felt so groggy, it was a chore making his thoughts focus on anything. He already had forgotten how they got there, if he ever knew. He felt like he was dreaming… or maybe just still asleep. "Cas?" He mumbled, voice rougher than before, and just a little slurred still.
Dean had started the morning strong, but through the day his silences became longer and his expression was set almost permanently in some sort of quiet distress.
Dean had insisted they look at the body before they left. He found himself in the small police morgue, looking over the grizzly remains of one Tom Gray. He frowned, poking the tip of a pen into the wounds, taking vague measurements and making note of the flesh that was missing.
"Chasing a rumor. Heard you bit it, wondered if the mark really let you go. Seems like I have an answer."
"Yeah." Dean grunted, pulling himself up to sit, scrubbing his hands over his face to try and shake the last bit of sleep from his brain. He noticed that it wasn't a blanket across him, but rather Cas' tan overcoat. He pushed it aside. "What time is it?"
It also didn't escape Cas' notice how comfortable and confident Dean was with Liam. He thought back, realizing that Dean had raised his brother from infant-hood. Dean knew how to handle the frightened child. He himself felt completely lost on the subject. He looked to the hunter for guidance on what he should do.
"All accounted for. Oh…" Sam dug into his pocket, pulling out a knit hat. "Found this discarded on in the front. Put it through the wash, cleaned up nice." He tossed it onto Cas' lap. "Coat was a lost cause, I don't think all the bleach in the world was gonna get rid of that much blood." He looked apologetic, but Cas smiled, holding the hat.
Sam straightened up, shaking slightly as he moved to prepare the next injection. Cas watched from the doorway as he readied the syringe. "Look, We can't stop doing this."
Sam moved forward, reaching out to take Dean's pulse. Still a little fast, but steady. "Maybe it was just too much. He'll be better when he wakes up." He said, trying to ignore the shake in his voice and project confidence.
"Gee thanks." Dean gave one last deep sigh and let his guard fall away entirely. "I don't know Cas. So much shit has gone down in the last week, and it wasn't exactly smooth sailing before that."
With this in mind, without saying anything, Dean began looking for a motel to call it a night. Finding one, he pulled in, cutting the engine, and froze when he saw Cas' face. "We can continue on." He had picked up on the fact it was unusual for Dean to call it quits less than 12 or 13 hours into a trip.
Cas lifted a hand, touching two fingers to the hunter's forehead and sending him into a deep sleep. He let his hand come to rest on the hunter's shoulder, taking a deep breath and trying to process the conversation they just had.
Finally after what felt like days, the hunter dragged himself to his feet, pulling himself into the car. He started her and turned back away from the cape, heading towards the coordinates Cas' gps were telling him to go.
The angel resumed stroking Dean's back. "I don't know if you'll go anywhere. I worry your soul will just cease to be." He watched Dean's expression closely. "It doesn't matter." He tried to assure him. "We won't let it come to that. We will have that thing off long before you find yourself in any sort of mortal peril."
"Cas, can you get us back to the cabin?" He was an angel again, he was hoping flight was back on the menu. Ezekiel didn't fly, but he was weak. Dean hoped that wasn't the case for them all, that Cas would still be able to fly...
Dean rubbed his hands over his face, letting himself settle back in the chair. He felt suddenly years older than he had before, the whole experience catching him off guard and draining him. He tried to find comfort in watching the angel sleep, knowing he was getting better. It had to be enough for now.
Cas gave a small smile and pushed himself to reach the buttons on his bed. He adjusted it so he was mostly upright. Dean shifted his head to be able to see Sam, but he was unable to sit up as Cas had.
As Cas passed the welcome sign for Ohio he looked up at the hunter again, surprised to see Dean asleep against the passenger window. The angel reached up, slowly turning the radio down a bit, letting the music settle into a softer tone, less likely to wake him.
The case they were heading to now was in Oregon, making it necessary to crash in a motel in southern Idaho.
Dean wasted no time grabbing what he needed to start attending to Cas' injuries, leaving Sam to step back and watch.
"We'll figure it out." he said with an unmistakable note of finality. Cas set his jaw, hoping to project confidence. Confidence enough to outweigh the doubt coursing through the hunter's mind. Confidence enough to carry them both through this ordeal. He settled back in his place, looking once more back over the Kansas landscape before them.
Sam reached him first, striking to try and get the angel blade out of Dean's hands. The older Winchester was ready, knocking him back and slashing out with the weapon, catching Sam across the chest, not yet deep enough to maim him.
Dean looked over Cas who was sitting on the edge of his bed, his broken arm in a sling and his casted leg dangling over the edge. "You okay?"
"Dean… I forgive you." He watched Dean flinch at his words. "I know I cannot grant absolution for all the events of the past weeks, but I can at least forgive you for the parts involving me." He ignored the ache in his chest that longed to reach out to the hunter, knowing Dean's mind was far too volatile to allow contact again so soon. "And I do forgive you."
Finally after what felt like days, the hunter dragged himself to his feet, pulling himself into the car. He started her and turned back away from the cape, heading towards the coordinates Cas' gps were telling him to go.
Gadreel nodded. "Thank you. Should you require assistance with opening heaven again, please call on me. I will come."
Dean nodded, feeling just a little of the tension inside him fade. He put down his bag and accepted the book in Sam's outstretched hand, sitting at the table and beginning to help.
Cas looked the hunter over, noticing Dean struggling to keep the tension out of his body, to keep the conversation from spiraling out of control. So he bit his tongue on further comments and gave a nod.
Dean had managed to put off talking to Cas for an impressive amount of time. He spent most of it in the garage assessing the damage done to his baby, working on what he could get started on, and writing up a parts list for what he'd need. He accepted Kevin's sandwich delivery with slightly more enthusiasm than breakfast, but still, like earlier, he only got through a couple bites before he just couldn't stomach it anymore.
The angel let himself sink down for a moment. He had never felt so helpless. He had laid siege to hell, fought countless angels, and stared down Lucifer himself before. He had died no less than three times and spent a year in purgatory, and yet nothing had scared him as much as this. Time was, he could grab Dean and fly them to safety. He could use his angelic healing, and take Dean's injuries away. Hell, he could even just use his strength to bend back the metal cage collapsed around them, and let them out. Now… he could do nothing. Nothing but sit, and wait, and very possibly die here. Dean was next to him, bleeding out, probably dying. He was pinned by the car, nursing a handful injuries of his own. And his only hope of getting help was so close but completely out of reach. Cas felt the renewed cold cross his face as more tears trailed down his cheeks. He took a few deep breaths, trying to ground himself and limit the panic.
Dean's breath hitched, the feeling of having his mind read always one that felt like a violation. But he trusted Castiel enough to allow it against his every instinct. He swallowed, feeling more vulnerable than he had ever been in his life, and his raw reaction was to shut himself off, maybe even run. But he forced himself to remain planted to the spot.
"I'm fine." The older hunter flicked off the heat on the stove. He threw a few pieces of bacon on each of the plates.
"One problem at a time. Right now you need to come back with me… be aware… aware enough to breathe."
Castiel let himself relax slightly, and let his mind stop reeling at the events. He closed his eyes for a moment, breathing in the hunter's smell, feeling his warmth against his cheek. He couldn't help a tear sliding down his face as the familiarity stabbed through him like a knife. He needed Dean.
"Told you Cas-" Dean mumbled, his words sounding half asleep already. " 's just creepy." He gave one last small smile before his face relaxed and he was asleep at last, the long day capped by that dramatic ending sapping the last of his strength.
Castiel woke up, surprised he had managed to fall asleep in the car, so soon after they left. He turned and found Dean staring at him, back and forth with the road, a grin plastered across his face.
"I don't know. Eight I think? First one was an accident. Something followed Dad home. After that I guess he figured I was ready."
The demon stared at him. It was a moment before he spoke, so soft Castiel almost didn't hear him. "I don't want you to die."
He looked up, suddenly aware Cas had turned his attention back, and was watching him with a look of concern. He vaguely wondered what his face had been doing to give away his inner turmoil.
Sam cracked open his door and walked inside. "Hey… did you know Bobby had a lock-up in Western New York?"
Castiel stood in Dean's room for a few moments after the demon disappeared, his heart still racing, trying to accept or make sense of what just happened. He blinked a few times, pulling himself out of his trance before turning and all but running out the door.
They held like that in silence for a few minutes before Dean shifted, his face still set in an expression that was tinted with the scars of the past week's events. He pushed upwards, meeting Cas' lips briefly before pulling away and wordlessly walking to the bathroom, closing the door behind him.
Sam pulled Cas outside right before injection number seven. He looked back at the closed door before turning towards Cas. He kept his voice hushed. "Is it just me, or is this not working?"
He followed the angel to a clearing overlooking a small lake. When Cas sat, he settled onto the grass beside him.
Cas moved, switching places with Dean without words, kneeling to help the child, letting Dean take over a defensive position.
"Keep an eye out. We don't know who has it in for you guys then." Sam said softly. He paused again. "Cas… how are you?"
Gadreel looked down. "I would be lying to say I did not entertain the thought for a moment, but only just." He looked up, making eye contact with Cas. "I took some advice from a friend and conferred with my vessel. We chose to appear acquiescent and bring this information to you."
The angel once more wrapped his arms around the hunter, starting to drag him from the room, using a considerable amount of his waning angelic strength to avoid being brought to the ground with Dean as he thrashed. He looked sternly towards Gadreel, but the angel was already on the ground beside Sam, a hand coming up to heal him.
"A cat?" The voice coming over the phone wasn't trying hard to mask his amusement at the described situation.
He reminded himself that he was not the only being caught at the mercy of the warding surrounding them.
regret having to take in Theo's grace, and more than that, putting you in harm's way at all." He was hit with another familiar stab of guilt, the memory of Dean's screams echoing in his mind.
Dean managed an ironic smile as he reached into the cabinet and started to root around for a can of chicken noodle soup to heat up. If he thought about it hard, that death resume likely was only rivaled by his own. Though
Cas let go, allowing the hunter to move backwards, their eyes meeting at last. Now the hunter could see that tears were freely running down the angel's face. "I didn't-"
Both Cas and Sam sat leaning against the metal table. Sam's arms were crossed as he carefully kept an eye on the stirring demon.
"Yeah." Dean sighed. "Alright, We do this, what's the play? Gadreel goes to Metatron sans tablet, says the kid is toast. What if the next thing on Metatron's to-do list is worse?"
When Cas didn't move after he was done, Dean stood. "Come on, let's go back." He felt a small flicker of annoyance as he said it. That really
"I know." Cas took another deep shaky breath. He managed a weak smile. "I'm sorry for…" He paused, recalling the exact phrase. "cold-cocking you after sex."
Dean shook his head. "No… not like… not like the start of my time in hell… it feels like it did when you got to me. When I'm on the hunt, when the opportunity finally presents itself, it's crystal clear. I feel the rush, I feel the pleasure… I never want to stop. Like I could draw it out for an eternity if I let myself."
"That's life. Caught your doctor in the hallway, he'll be in soon. But it looks like they think they can do the ribs and the leg in one go, spare you going under twice. And more than that, if they like the readouts, they can remove the probe from your head. Fingers crossed, you'll be out of here and on bedrest at home in a couple days."
Dean was surprised to find himself being thrown through the wall into the next room over. He picked himself up off the floor with a growl, but it wasn't a call to stop. Cas followed him through, lifting him up and slamming him into the now cracking far wall of
Cas rushed to kneel beside them, wasting no time putting his hand on Kevin's chest, pooling his grace and pushing it forward, gripping the last shreds of Kevin's hold on life and forcing them back into place. He felt his way towards the injury, knitting the flesh back together and regenerating the lost blood. He retracted his hand, relieved as the prophet took a deep desperate breath before dissolving into a fit of coughs.
"I sent my mom to the hotel. I just…" He looked at Sam imploringly. "Dean is my friend… I want to be here. To help."
Castiel kept his gaze on the opposite wall, not trusting himself to look back at Dean just yet, hoping to avoid losing the fight with crying completely. "I have spent much of the last few days concerned for your life and entirely unable to help in any way."
The battered body of his brother was unchained and thrust forward. Crowley carefully pushed Cas, grabbing Sam and blinking out in an instant before anything could go sideways.
Castiel laid the cold hunter down into the painted devils trap in the corner, taking one last long look at his face. He closed his eyes for a moment, swallowing and trying to brace himself for whatever the coming weeks would bring. He felt an almost human nausea creep up on him as he thought about what just happened, what was happening right now.
“I’m fine.” He closed his eyes for a second, stopping himself from just brushing it off. “I mean I’m coping.” He forced out, trying to ignore the instinct to bottle up his emotions and move on. He sighed. “Thanks for this. For everything you’re doing.”
Are tired of being useless? Not my problem. You can't do anything, so stop putting it on me to do things to make
Dean nodded. "Okay. We're going to get this patched up. Cas is going to heal you." He smiled at the kid, his hand coming to rest gently on his shoulder. He leaned in conspiratorially. "Cas has super powers."
Cas pulled the drawer open, removing a flexible tape measure out. "You know a lot about broken bones."
He was so focused on the mission he almost missed the small sniffling sound echoing from around the bend. He froze, glancing at Cas before gesturing and moving forward with him. He rounded the corner with his gun up and found the source of the sound. He immediately lowered his gun before dropping his flashlight slightly, allowing it to illuminate the space indirectly.
"Sam says that isn't likely." Dean said, beaming a smile. He coughed slightly, frowning and rolling his eyes. "Cas, you'll find out soon, that most of the healing is just really boring. I'll walk you through some of the minor stuff, but it should be okay." He threw a sympathetic glance as Cas looked somewhat terrified still but was trying to hide it. "Hey, Sam is just a phone call away, and believe me when I tell you he'll be checking in constantly. And besides, it's only for two weeks. He'll be back and we'll drive home together then."
Cas fell silent, feeling not for the first time inadequate. Since the fall, he had been witness to too many struggles of the Winchesters that his former self could have corrected handily. He once again felt an immense guilt settle in on his shoulders.
Dean looked up, finally meeting the angel's eyes. He allowed Cas to reach up to wipe the stray tear from his cheek, and he closed his eyes, this time fully allowing himself to lean into the touch. "This is all new to me." The hunter hesitated, but slid sideways slightly to press his shoulder onto Cas'. He let out a shaky breath, a weak smile crossing his lips. "This was a lot easier when we both had just almost died."
Dean whipped his head around, finding the king of hell casually leaning against a light post. He groaned, straightening his back and regarding the demon carefully.
Dean shivered, feeling incredibly weird watching the scene unfold. He could feel the sensation of Cas lifting his body, but not his own. This wasn't the first time he suspected Cas had moved him from wherever he ended up passed out, but usually it was whiskey that caused him to sleep so deeply. This time was just overexertion.
"I put up sigils in the entryways similar to some of the bunker's. Should work like a salt line at the door and windows." Sam interrupted.
"He said he heard a rumor. That my grace was out there. That Metatron had not used all of it for the spell."
He allowed himself to almost drift off and didn't pay attention until he felt the shift and almost falling feeling that accompanied their descent. He was glad when they landed and the flurry of activity picked up again. This time the pain of movement was far less, and he figured he had whatever they added to his IV to thank for that. He glanced over at Dean, but nothing seemed different.
"Cas, I can't talk about this right now." Dean snapped, a little rougher than he intended, and he felt a twinge of guilt. "It's all in the past now, okay? Let's leave it there right now."
Of course, he knew without access to a poker, it was going to eventually die anyway. There was only so much he could do.
The angel froze, holding up a hand to Theo to silence him. He looked at Theo, and nodded towards the shelving unit.
It was early that evening when Sam came out to the garage, interrupting Dean's work. He was amused to see Dean in the welders mask with Cas just staring at the process as is. "Hey."
"Sure." Sam handed him a small stack of books, throwing him a lifeline to ignore his burdens for a little while.
Dean let his head fall back against the wall with a thud. He listened to the distant murmurs of the four hunters. He watched Crowley walk over to the door and take a look out. "Are you any closer to getting this thing off?"
"Wait till you see the snacks we have for the drive. I think you'll be impressed." Dean tossed a large bag onto the bed next to Cas.
"Cas, that's the plan. I go in as back up. See if we can't get the drop on them and get you the fuck out of there."
He tripped, a break in the concrete managing to send him to his knees. He sank back, his fingers brushing over the fresh scrapes through the rips in his pants. He closed his eyes against a wave of vertigo, feeling for a moment too weak to get back up.
Dean had been worried about Sam splitting off on his own, but it was Cas and him who ended up walking into the ambush. Add to that, the group of demons they were tracking turned out to be a group of angels, and Dean knew they were in trouble.
"Yeah, well. Sorry doesn't do much for me." Dean snapped, his voice dropping back down. "I tore that place up looking for you. Months I tortured anything that moved for info on where you were."
"This feeling… it's so overwhelming and limiting at the same time. I can take in so much less information in one instant, but I can filter none of it out. I have yet to develop a way to focus my attention."
"I woke up after the surgery." Dean explained. "I guess whatever they saw in my head was good enough for them. Gotta watch it or something… if it does good they get to fix my leg and chest tomorrow. Two steel rods in my leg. I get to be a cyborg." He managed a half grin, but it turned into something of a grimace. "That and work on six broken ribs."
Cas looked sympathetic. He had no words to offer Dean, no way of comforting him of his loss. Dean had insisted in purgatory that he never bring it up again. Cas had attempted several times to approach the guilt he felt at his hand in the Winchester's surrogate father's death, as it was his fault the Leviathan walked free. Dean would always shut him down almost immediately.
He let them tie him to a stretcher, catching a glimpse of the wrecked car as they carried him up the hill towards the road.
Dean stared at him flatly before looking up as if pleading to god for patience. "Yeah. I mean how was it broken? Tibia? Fibula? Closer to the ankle? The knee?"
"And you tell me if anything funny happens to your breathing." He furrowed his brow, looking up at Cas. "Actually
Sam had heard the plate break and got there just in time to see Dean deck Cas. He walked over to the angel. "Are you okay?" he asked gently.
Dean woke quietly that morning, blinking sluggishly in the sunlight pushing through the threadbare curtains. He felt the warmth against his back and he hesitated before allowing himself to turn towards it.
Sam sighed. "Cas, we should all get back to the bunker. Why don't I take Gadreel in your car, and you and Dean can head back together." He spared a glance back towards the motel. "Can you two do a quick pass over the room, make sure we didn't leave anything too incriminating?"
Dean dragged himself upright, rubbing his hand over his eyes and stretching. He let out his breath with the tension in his shoulders. He blinked a few times, letting his eyes adjust to the early morning light. "That's what, five hours?" Dean raised an eyebrow. "Not bad." He rolled his neck a little. He removed the coat from where it had slid to his lap, carefully folding it over once and handing it back to the angel. He looked at it for a moment, realizing Cas must've mojo'd it clean after getting his grace back. Sam had said it was a lost cause. He shook himself from that pointless thought, stifling a yawn. "Alright, I need coffee."
"Yeah, no shit." Dean muttered before he could stop himself. The angel didn't seem to notice though.
The hunter closed his eyes, feeling the walls close in a bit as another wave of memory washed over him. He needed an anchor, and for once, he allowed himself to reach out. He moved before he could think himself out of it, putting his hand over Cas’ where it rested beside his coffee mug.
"Yeah." Dean said bitterly. "We wouldn't have to figure it out if I had just been honest with him to begin with."
The hunter heard the cracking through the woods on their left, then their right, and he knew it was toying with them. They crashed into a clearing, Cas and Dean stopping for a second back to back, knives up, keeping their eyes on the tree line surrounding them in the rapidly dimming light.
"Even if I did agree, how the fuck am I supposed to convince Sam to leave me when he's so damn freaked out over what's gone wrong so far?"
But he didn't know what else to do to try and stave off the choking silence. "A small part of me doesn't want to stop Sam when he inevitably tries to trade his soul for your life." Cas felt the weight of guilt at his words. "I wouldn't let him. Obviously. Sam is my friend, and your brother. But if I had a soul I would bargain for you myself."
"They cook down." Dean said absently, setting to work on other things. He put a few potatoes next to Cas. "And these when you're done. One inch cubes."
The hunter started awake, blinking quickly taking a second to orient himself. He took in a deep breath, held it for a moment, before letting it out in a huff. "Cas." He grunted at last, his heart rate starting to slow to a more reasonable pace.
The former angel deepened his frown, unsatisfied with the response he got. "Being human is more difficult than I have given it credit in the past."
"I do not believe I am tired anymore." Cas replied. He gave a slight smile, inclining his head a notch. "I found that wake-up... bracing."
"Yeah." Sam interrupted, watching the angel turn on heel and leave the room. He paled, taking a shaky breath and trying to steady himself again.
Liam nodded again, slowly uncurling his arms so Dean could pull the coat over his shoulders. The green army jacket looked ridiculously large on him, but Liam just pulled it closer, clearly comforted by it's warmth.
Cas stood, gathering Dean in his arms and lifting him again. "Hopefully." He said softly, heading out of 7b and towards the hunter's room. Sam moved ahead, getting the doors. He helped pull back the covers, watching Cas settle him down.
They didn't last long, and Dean let the last one fall away from his knife before it slipped from his hand. He staggered, almost managing to steady himself before his legs gave way.
Dean turned his attention back to Gadreel. "So he told you to kill Kevin and take the tablet and then… what, you get to be his new butt buddy?"
Sam hadn't been too surprised when Dean refused breakfast. Egg white omelettes weren't really something that appealed to his brother. He had been pissed enough to not care when he started making them, and then had just sort of figured Dean would be hungry enough to eat. It wasn't like he had an opportunity to yesterday. At the time though, he was mostly just counting his small victories in redirecting his hungover brother to coffee instead of beer.
Dean turned his head to also look out at the abandoned town. With the businesses closed down for the night, the town itself was deserted. "I don't know."
Castiel practically threw Dean into the cellar dungeon. The hunter braced himself against the back wall and then strode forward with purpose, only to be met with Castiel blocking his path.
"A demon." Dean's voice was emotionless, and his expression was pensive as the realization dawned on him. "Cain wasn't a demon when he killed his brother. The mark made him." The puzzle pieces slotted themselves in place with such clarity. Dean absently pressed his hand over the mark.
Both Cas and Sam sat leaning against the metal table. Sam's arms were crossed as he carefully kept an eye on the stirring demon.
The first thing he noticed was that he could not see the shadow of Cas' wings. He couldn't dismiss the possibility it was his own senses that were weakened, but he could still see the vague glow of the angel's true form through the seams of his vessel. He anticipated Cas' connection with his grace was stretched much thinner than he was letting on.
Cas followed her gaze and stood quickly, immediately stepping sideways to put himself between the demon and Charlie.
"This feeling… it's so overwhelming and limiting at the same time. I can take in so much less information in one instant, but I can filter none of it out. I have yet to develop a way to focus my attention."
"You're not going to freak out till you faint again, are you?" Kevin's voice was sarcastic, but it was barely containing the borderline panic he felt at the moment.
He faintly heard one of the angels, Hannah maybe, asking him again what to do with Metatron. He felt the words form on his lips,
Dean tensed, his eyes black as he stared at the angel, breathing heavily. He put his hand back against Castiel's neck, but he was once again pushed off.
"Hey Sam." Cas sat on the end of the bed opposite him, feeling a bit of relief at the change in company.
The hunter moved forward without hesitation, throwing and landing the first punch. He redirected the werewolf's momentum when he lunged again, managing to come up behind him and catch him in the back of the neck.
Castiel let out a breath, his body half collapsing back to the ground, scattering rubble as he fell. He dragged himself up again, checking to make sure Dean was truly unconscious. He stared up at the crumbling ceiling for a moment, trying to regain control of his spinning thoughts, stop the dizzying noise of his own subconscious. He managed to table his conflicted feelings on the events and focus on what he needed to do now.
Dean felt a flash of guilt, looking over Cas. He was battered, and looked exhausted even in his peaceful rest. He was injured, on the run from the angels, injured and in a hospital. all because he chose to throw in his lot with him. He begged Cas to rebel, begged him to help fight the apocalypse with him. And now Cas was human, homeless, and all but helpless. He jumped slightly, realizing that Cas' eyes were open and the angel was watching him.
Sam gave a weak smile. "Honestly I sort of felt relieved when you guys didn't return that first night." He felt a pang of guilt for the feeling.
Dean let his still clearing head turn that information over for a moment. "How many?" He asked at last.
Sam stood as well. "Yeah." They watched Dean leave before Sam whipped around on him. "Do you think this is a good idea?"
Sam sighed. "He's cuffed and locked down, but yeah. I think we're going to need him on this." He shook his head. "I mostly called to make sure you guys weathered the storm alright."
get him trapped. Sam couldn't see any of that actually working, but it was more or less their best option at that point.
Cas slid down the bed a bit to settle. He reached out his good hand, resting it against the side of the hunter's chest, feeling the steady rise and fall of his breath. It reassured him that Dean was still alive.
He rolled, extracting himself from the heavy dead weight of Dean's arm. He heard the hunter wake, and met green eyes when he finally managed to look.
A week ago he had been sure he was going to die without ever seeing the hunter again. Now he was whole again, and Dean was right in front of him. Here.
He turned his head towards the driver side, trying to see the hunter. His eyes found him. "Dean." He repeated. He gritted his teeth, pulling his arm up, hand shaking Dean's shoulder gently. "Dean?" Dean's head listed bonelessly to the side, revealing a truly alarming amount of blood washing down the side of his head and over his ear from a cut in his hairline. His cheek also boasted a rather large piece of glass, and Cas could only guess that his head had been what busted through that side window. He could see Dean's breath in the cold air though, so he knew at least the hunter was alive.
Cas was surprised by the kiss. Affection was something that Dean was usually far more subtle about and rarely instigated. He let his eyes close, taking comfort from the contact. He had thought Dean was gone, truly gone just moments ago. So he welcomed this contact even in lieu of the embrace he would have expected.
When she finished he gave her his card and a promise they'd look into it. He and Cas headed back out towards the black muscle car, Dean shedding his coat as they went.
Dean was unsatisfied by the single word he got in response, especially given the build up. "Better?" he pushed.
By the fourth time, Dean was no longer surprised when he found himself next to Cas. He had fallen asleep at the infirmary table after attempting to rest his eyes for a second.
The next hour was spent with Dean talking Sam down from his renewed resolve to stay and keep an eye on the two of them. Dean lost track of wherever Cas slipped off to, smartly rolling clear of the hurricane kicked up by the two brothers butting heads.
"Dean." He responded, feeling reassured by the closeness of another human who was there to help. "He hit his head… it won't stop bleeding."
Castiel looked up, somewhat embarrassed. He turned the wheelchair, climbing up on to sit on the bed. He twisted, handing Dean the sling.
The hunter stared at him for a moment before smiling a bit in spite of himself. He rolled his eyes. "Alright. I'll help you style the cat. And then, a warm meal and she moves on."
"Sam, I-" Cas quieted down, his posture straightening up as if he were hearing a far off sound. "Dean is reaching out."
"So now what?" Kevin's voice from the archway surprised everyone as nobody had seen the prophet stand to join them.
"Yeah but… something just isn't right." Dean insisted. "There's no devils trap on the inside of this, no guns, no trip wires. Hell there's not even a string with some jingling cans."
Cas clamped Dean's arms to his side, dragging the hunter along as Dean fought him tooth and nail to get away. He pinned Dean to the wall, one hand around the hunter's neck, careful not to hurt him, but applying just enough pressure Dean could not resist as he removed the first blade from his coat. He threw it across the room, trying to get it as far away as possible. Dean struggled harder to escape his grasp, like a feral animal trying to survive.
His face was set in a constant expression between concern and disbelief through the entire summary of the case. "And how was he?"
"More than a little shaken up. He's resting in his own room, but he said something about going to stay with his mom at the hotel."
"Yeah." He stood, stretching. "I hope so." He headed towards the door, walking out through the upper landing and down to the kitchen.
"True." Dean tensed for a moment when the angel relaxed to rest against him. "Maybe it's just harder because it feels real now." He sighed. "Or maybe because of everything else."
Sam debated with himself before deciding to go ahead. Frankly, they didn't have the china budget to wait for Dean to come around to talking about his feelings on his own. More than that, Sam wanted to know,
Dean snaked a hand around Castiel's shoulders. The other slipped under the overcoat and suit coat, trying to coax them off the angel's shoulder, Cas shifted slightly, preventing the hunter from removing his coat. Dean gave up after a second, and instead pressed their bodies even closer, his arm wrapping around Cas' back.
The low, rough voice was so nearly familiar, and it made Cas' chest ache. He leaned back as far as the hunter would let him, backed against the wall, trying to get a look at his face, to get a sense of what the hunter was thinking. "Dean… we've been looking for you."
Sam headed towards Dean's room, giving a quick listen through the door. Quiet. That meant either he had dozed off or had his headphones on. Sam took care to open his door quietly, determined not to interrupt him if he was somehow asleep. He slipped in, looking up to see which it was, and froze as he made eye contact with Cas. Sam took in the scene before him. His brother was asleep across the angel's chest, settled in his arms, covered in the tan coat. He could see the evidence of tears, but Dean looked at peace now.
"I want you to ride me, Dean,” The look of mischief lingered in Benny’s hazel eyes as Dean swallowed his drool.
“What’s your favorite subject?” She asked lightly, tracing her hand over his knuckles and holding the menu with her other.
He took his seat in the middle row and paid attention the entire time. Through some war and some important invention., today was the last day before Thanksgiving break so he wanted to make sure he did not miss anything about his teacher, that way he had material for the long weekend.
First thing he did when he got to school was meet up with Charlie. For him it was the hardest to figure if he wanted to tell her about the interactions from work, on not one but three occasions.
Before he knew it his watch read 7:30pm. He disappeared without a trace in the crowd. When he got to the car he sent Sam a quick text to his brother to read after the game.
Dean was still blushing at the memory. The way that his teacher looked into his eyes was half of the reason that he pulled his team to win the game that night. It was the kind of blue you could never forget.
“Dean?” Cas said calmly but Dean did not seem to hear. “Damnit Dean! Again? It hasn’t even been 10 minutes.”
Castiel looked just as casual as the last two days Dean had seen him. A plain t-shirt, this one was dark maroon, jeans and his trench coat. But today as Dean stood there he noticed part of a tattoo peeking out from over his shoulder. It looked like the tip of a wing. For a split second Dean wanted to ask him to expose himself as he had made Dean do, make him feel vulnerable.
“Yeah, and I have his number, and now two of his brother's numbers. And I don’t know if I mentioned, but I love youuuuu” Dean blushed in embarrassment of the situation he had gotten himself in.
Time flew by with the constant drink orders coming through and all the orders to be taken at the bar. He didn’t stop working for even a minute until about 12:30 in the morning and that was only because it was last call.
“I was going to go get some breakfast with Lisa.” As he said her name she looked up and blushed a little bit.
“Absolutely, I’ll go put in your order and I’ll be back with drinks.” She said cheerfully before walking away.
“Ready for this…” Castiel sat on the bed before Dean and leaned forward. Their lips met crashing into each other, hands reached out to caress the younger boy’s body.
He closes his eyes, unable to keep the images from flooding his mind. “Going in was hard, but coming out was almost worse…”
It takes two days before they fully understand the scope of it, and by that time Rowena has flown in to see it in person. She doesn’t even take time to rest, too excited to pour over everything, her long red hair falling in a curtain around her. She and Sam prepare a presentation for everyone else. Dean cooks burgers, serving it with the last of his Grandfather’s carefully hoarded favorite beer.
It’s stopped raining by the time they get back to the car, covered in mud and scratches. Castiel is scowling, but Dean can’t bring himself to be upset. His boyfriend is adorable, soaked and annoyed, a wet leaf plastered to his cheek. Of course, the air is no cooler than it was before, the moisture still cloying, the air humid and gross. Cas is asleep almost as soon as his butt hits the seat, so Dean drives back listening to Blue Oyster Cult, his good mood unabated.
“Yes. Like C-Cas. They had some plan, but Dad wouldn’t ever sh-share it, and then everything went to shit.”
Cas nods thoughtfully. “Fall is quite lovely on the trails. You are forgetting something, though. Remember that spot Dorothy and Charlie told us about?”
God, Castiel is beautiful. He sits, ramrod straight, imperious and furious. He looks dangerous, the blue of his eyes cold fire. Dean is forced to take a deep breath, willing his body to get a grip. They stare at each other long enough to start people in the pews whispering at each other. That is just fine. He suspects that there’s no way out of this but into a box and spending his last moments looking at the love of his life is perfect. He could care less about gossip.
Slouching out of the bedroom, he sees Sam at the window in their living room, lights off. This window is the only thing redeeming the place; one entire wall is one way glass, reflecting the bright neon lights of the city around them. It is beautiful.
“I see puzzlement on the faces of my people. Why was I not at my own father’s funeral? Why did I not take my throne and where have I been these last years?” He pauses again, waiting past the point where a proper dramatic pause would end, waiting until people start talking, until the muttering gets loud. Ketch scowls at him and Mitch makes a quick gesture with the arm closest to Castiel. There’s a flicker in Cas’ eyes that would be a proper flinch to anyone else. Yeah, someone’s gonna die.
Dean groans, tilting his head back to bare his neck. “God can watch if he likes, let him be jealous. I worship at a different altar now.”
Dean’s tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth and he swallows thickly, laughing deep within his chest. “Oh, no, don’t start that.”
He digs his phone out, distantly glad to be using his own, happy to shed the pink sparkly monstrosity. Charlie answers immediately with a chirpy, “Your worshipfulness!”
Cas goes to help him get up, but Dean waves him off. He actually feels tremendously better. He suspects that his issue with technology pushed her out of his head entirely.
The voice from below yells up again, “He doesn’t care about a ring, just ask! That stuff’s not important!”
Mary meets his eyes evenly. “Yes he did. Arthur told me himself, though we can never really prove it.”
“My Prince,” Castiel whispers eventually, “I cannot sleep. I burn at night. Every thought is filled with the ecstasy of having you under me after all these years. If you think that I will allow you to push me away…”
“Perhaps. I had not been in court for a long time when it happened. Gabriel, though, is happy to gossip. Her Majesty and Mr. Ketch weren’t very subtle about the affair, but John pulled him even tighter instead of firing him or banishing him from court. They were inseparable until they went to Wallachstein to hunt werewolves. He didn’t come back alive.”
It’s dark, the moon obscured by bright lazy clouds. It takes a little bit, but Dean finally recognizes where he is. The prison, called ‘the dungeon’ by everyone except his father who had never thought it was funny, sits in a low squat building behind the palace. Over the centuries it’s been used to house Nobles, political prisoners, and the occasional noble-turned-monster, languishing here while the royal family figured out how to deal with them.
Dean snorts. “Well, this is where the family secrets part comes in. Both Henry and Dad are secret-keeping assholes. We hoard them, like demented squirrels. Chances are that Grandpa only told them enough to repair the angels, and oversaw anything major on his own.
Sam shakes the spray can. “Close your eyes. None of us want to deal with you with sun poisoning.” He starts to spray sunscreen on Dean’s back and arms. “Look, for what it’s worth, I don’t think he cares about that. I think he’s just waiting to see if you’re going to stick around.”
The dawn comes the way it always does, a sweet stain spreading across the sky. In the street, people are already bustling, cleaning and preparing for the big day. He nudges Sam, waking him up. The servants from the castle start arriving with their clothing, itineraries, and a hundred other things. He stands listlessly for his fitting, noting the way the servants nod and look at each other meaningfully. He knows he looks like a lost and mournful lover and does nothing to hide it. He hopes the story will spread among the servants. He could use all the help he can get.
He clears his throat, praying that his blush isn’t as intensely red as it feels, burning on his cheeks. “Um, hello,” is all he comes up with, anyway.
“Come on, Charles,” Dean says again. “You promised me one of Gilda’s heavenly chocolate cupcakes. Pay up.”
But that’s only because the guy is seriously gorgeous, and also seems to seriously hate Dean. Like, frowns and dark stares and leaving the room when Dean enters it. And that is most definitely the only reason why Dean keeps track of their meetings. It has
Because… now that he thinks about it, nobody has ever been as gentle with him as Cas’ short little descriptions make him sound. And Dean, he
Then, with a soft smile and blinking up at him with knowing blue eyes, he wraps one hand around the base of Dean’s cock and gives his head, red, pulsing and leaking steadily, a careful little lick. It’s so goddamn gentle, barely even a touch, but after all this teasing it has Dean’s legs twitching in shocked pleasure where they are laid out around Cas. Cas grins up at him, and then starts leaving soft licks up and all around Dean’s dick.
They are only interrupted when there’s a knock on the door, a nurse wheeling in a cart with their lunch, and all three of them are rather surprised when they notice that the clock climbed past noon while they were chatting.
They may even end up talking after switching off the lights, about their favorite fairy tales and Disney movies and favorite foods, and they only stop when their eyes start to droop and their voices grow tired.
Cas feels a smile spread across his cheeks, wider than usual, and says: “Actually, I would love that.”
But Cas just smiles down at him, fond and a little dazed, and Dean wishes he could tell if it’s from the alcohol or maybe actually because of him. And then Cas finally closes the distance between them again, but instead of meeting Dean where he’s already craning his head to capture Cas’ soft, chapped lips with his own again, Cas ducks down and starts peppering kisses against Dean’s jaw, makes his way down to Dean’s throat.
Dean’s silent for a while, but when he speaks up, his voice is friendly and calm: “That’s alright. We all do this sometimes. ’m just glad you warmed up to me and my amazing personality.” He sounds teasing, and when Cas dares to look at him, there’s a cheeky smile on his face.
And then they forget all about shielding themselves from the rain, and start to run and tumble towards their home. There are a quick few seconds of awkwardness when they both pull their keys from their pockets try to unlock the door, and then again when they fall into their apartment and have to make a decision on whose room they are going to move to, but then Cas just intertwines their fingers, sends Dean a crooked smile, and pulls them towards his room.
look it was, but Dean suddenly started looking forward to seeing Cas, even just from across the room. Even just listening in on Cas’ conversations with Charlie like a creep, keeping his distance but catching glimpses.
His heart does a flip again, hoping it might be Cas, and in his nervous excitement he gets up way too fast and hits his head on the table — hard.
“Hey, Cas,” he says, rubbing the throbbing spot on his head one last time before dropping his hand back to his side.
“He—” he breaks off with a cough, voice raw. “Hey. Hello.” He glances over to Dean’s guest with a careful smile, and she beams and waves a hand in the air as soon as their eyes meet. “I’m Cas,” he tells her with a smile.
“I’m — ” he starts, then stops. “I would rather not talk about it,” he ends up saying after an awful while, and the way the man raises his eyebrow seems like he’s trying to taunt Cas.
“You alright there, man?” His roommate asks, and when Cas can’t answer through clenched teeth, he speaks again: “Hey, are you in pain? Wait, I’m gonna call a nurse for you.”
He blinks his eyes open, and the first thing he notices is the fact that his chest is feeling okay again. Not great, not painless, but okay.
Dean’s laughter dies down immediately, legs falling open to welcome Cas between them again. Cas kneels down between them, vision still a little blurred, but clear enough to notice the blush on Dean’s cheeks, the eager smile on his lips, his glassy eyes.
“Just like that, yes, yes, yes,” Dean breathes after a few minutes, his cock pulsing in Cas’ hands until suddenly all his moans and panting accumulate in a low, wonderful groan and he stills, his dick jumping as he spills across Cas’ side and onto his stomach.
When he deepens the kiss, Dean moans against his lips, pulls him up and over him until he’s straddling his lap almost like that one memorable time on Dean’s couch. Cas spends a few minutes just enjoying sinking into the kiss and hovering above Dean before he remembers that this time, he doesn’t have to worry too much about hurting Dean, so he allows himself to sit down and kiss him again even harder.
Dean clears his throat, puts the pan down on the counter and grabs a rag to wipe away the grease from the floor while Cas puts away the bacon. “It’s okay,” Dean says, voice a little shaky. “I made breakfast. I hope… I hope that’s alright? If you wanna stay?”
Cas, standing there, covered in flour and wringing his hands and looking at Dean with big blue eyes. He looks… nervous. Hopeful?
He shuffles in bed, yawns and blinks open his eyes. When he looks up, Dean is looking over with a smile, holding up a fancy cupcake and saluting with it.
Dean kisses him even softer than ever before when he pulls down the zipper and pushes Cas’ jeans lower on his hips. “You wanna lie down, Cas?” he asks, and Cas complies, gets off of Dean and lies down on the free space of the blanket. Dean follows as if bound to him, falls down with him until their lips connect again.
Cas nods stiffly, once, and then forces his eyes from Dean’s face and back down to his phone, starting the first reply.
“Ah,” Cas returns, stomach growing a little cold. He knows better than to let his brain run away imagining things, but he can’t help but think about how this man must act outside the hospital. A macho, through and through, trying to use violence to gain respect, or something equally idiotic and dripping with toxic masculinity. Cas can just imagine how he would react if he knew that Cas is trans. Maybe he’d start the next fight right then.
“Sure thing,” she says, smiling brightly, and then she helps him to carefully get up and out of bed for the first time since his surgery.
But he can’t, can’t risk fucking up their friendship beyond repair. They have been good friends for five years, now, have even shared an apartment for a while in college. And this arrangement doesn’t seem to put a strain on their friendship at all — if anything, it feels like they are getting even closer. They share more with each other now, from random details about their days to serious things regarding work, family or friends.
Cas shoves his boxers down to mid-thigh, and Dean is so damn sure that he will finally get what he’s been hoping for — when Cas does even better and moves up, sinks down on top of Dean, and kisses him. He hadn’t even noticed how much he’d been wanting Cas’ lips on his own again, Cas’ tongue tracing his bottom lip, Cas’ weight against him, until the very moment he got it all.
But before he can finish that thought, Cas steps into his space, until their chests are pressed together and their mouths are almost touching, and Dean loses all breath and brainpower.
“You are,” Dean says, and that’s when he finally remembers his own hands, and moves them down until his fingers tangle in Cas’ silky-soft, crazy hair. “God, Cas, haven’t even touched me yet.”
As soon as his head is free from fabric, he finds Cas’ lips on his own again. Cas kisses him as they make their way down to his matress, Dean on his back and Cas kneeling between his thighs. When their lips part again, Dean drops his head back onto Cas’ pillow with a soft sigh.
I love you, and that I’m so unbelievably grateful you defended Gilda and I from that bigoted fuck-face. But, for heaven’s sake, Dean, I didn’t want you to get hurt for it! I thought you’d just show him out, not start a fist-fight with him and his minions of homophobia.” She takes a break, a deep and shaky breath. “I love you. Thank you for looking out for me. But promise me, you absolute moron, to n
” and his fingers slipping into Dean’s tight heat. He’s barely up to two fingers when Dean’s hands come down to pull him out. His eyes are half-shut and his lip bitten red when he says: “Fuck me, Cas,” and then, really, all is lost.
Just regular men, with dad bods, pushing strollers and cooing to their small, chubby, red-cheeked babies. It’s absolutely ridiculous and he can’t explain it at all, but… Regular men with babies already make him weak.
“I’m sorry, dude, do you — Do you need help? I’d be more than happy to help, I mean, if you trust me with her, I don’t, um,” he stumbles over his words, ears surely bright red.
Before Dean can do more than nod, though, the door to their room opens and Cas’ doctor enters with a friendly smile and a “Nice to see you again”.
And he doesn’t have to wait, since Dean’s fingers are still resting against him and start to move immediately with his plea. It’s kind of a miracle, the way Dean makes him feel and ache and want. It doesn’t take much, with the way Dean’s come is still warm on Cas’ side and the sparks Dean’s fingers are sending down his spine. A few more strokes, and Cas comes, pulsing and spasming and kissing Dean hard and biting.
“Dean,” Cas breathes, and then he comes all over Dean’s lower stomach with soft, quiet whimpers and fast breathing. “God, Dean.”
Cas takes mercy on him and interrupts him, guides him back down to his mattress with a warm palm on Dean’s shoulder. “Dean,” he says, a frown on his face. “Dean, I knew very well what I did. What we did. I’m just sorry you didn’t get… the ‘full experience’. I mean, if you wanted it.”
They’ve been through quite a few rounds and two bottles of Row’s fancy tequila by now, had to switch to vodka a few minutes ago, and the questions are straying away from sneaky secrets they know about each other —
“No, I’m — I prefer soft kissing and nipping, rather than biting and sucking,” he says, and the way he does so makes Dean shiver and sink deeper into his couch cushion, hands in his lap. “No biting or spanking or hair pulling for me so far.”
“I’m Castiel,” he says, and then goes for his food. He hadn’t realized before, but he’s really really starving.
They’ve talked about Cas’ transition, that he’s been on T for a few years by now and that top surgery was his first surgery ever. About how… how he feels, with everything being the way it is. Dean knows more than anyone ever has, and Cas knows he will be gentle with him. Knows he won’t laugh about scars or wrinkle his nose or be weird about it. Or hopes so, at least.
Holy shit, I kind of really feel like a fucking dick for making that “sex accident” joke when we first met. Pls don’t hate me, I swear I’m not that much of an asshole
, and Dean just stares. He can feel the vodka dribbling down his chin while he drinks, and oggles his best friend some more.
“I want you so much,” he mumbles into the skin of Cas’ tummy, and it’s all Cas can do to pull him up and into another mind-numbing kiss.
There’s something anxious flitting over Cas’ face, but then he takes a deep breath and says: “I would show you again, whenever you want. However you want.”
“Cas,” he breathes, voice rough and needy already, and then he kisses Cas again in a way that makes him forget everything else but the softness of Dean’s mouth and the line of his cock, hard and clearly outlined even through his jeans. “Jesus.”
“Oh, she — we haven’t had the best few days, to be honest,” Cas says softly and his hand is still gently patting her back. “Claire has been having tummy troubles, so I kind of have to keep rocking her, or she’ll start crying again. It started yesterday morning, her doc assured me that it’s nothing out of the ordinary. But she just… I can’t put her down.”
Dean has lost all control, so he clicks on the third and last picture, too. It’s another selfie, Cas in front of a small lake, wearing headphones and a soft, worn-looking grey AC/DC shirt. He looks like he made a quick stop in the middle of his run, just to take this picture, and he looks a little flushed and a little squinty and Dean’s heart races in his chest.
So he gets drunk enough to ignore his sober, responsible and mature thoughts. Gets drunk enough to stop resisting Dean’s pull.
He’s scraping the last eggs off his plate, throat closing in a way that makes him feel like he’s gonna choke if he takes one more bite, thinking about how to best make his way out of this situation without making Dean regret ever even taking him home — when Dean interrupts his thoughts.
But at his core, it feels a little bittersweet, leaving Dean and this bubble they’ve been living in for the past days.
Dean snorts a little at the crazy amount of emojis, then feels his heart do a stupid little jump when he realizes that
Dean takes a step back and gestures for Gilda to take over the process of getting their dough into a decent shape.
But he’ll see soon, he supposes. If Cas comes out here to him, to talk, maybe…? If he stays inside and shows their friends, makes a laughing stock out of Dean, then — well, then Dean will have to live with that. Make it a joke, too. He can do that, probably.
Once he’s back in bed, she connects him to the IV. It’s heavenly when he feels the cool liquid rush through his veins, and he thanks the nurse more than is technically necessary. She leaves, and so does Cas’ pain, quicker than he thought possible. He sighs softly, wiggling into his pillow, and his eyes fall closed.
“Wow, Gabe, this is possibly the nicest you’ve ever been to me,” Cas laughs, setting down the bag on his seat before turning towards Gabe, who is awfully inappropriately staring at his chest. “Stop that.”
ducks in again and kisses Dean, careful of his split lip but not quite ready to give up the giddy feeling in his chest just yet.
He pushes, and pulls, and Dean shudders apart beneath him, mumbling meaningless words into Cas’ shoulder, fingers buried in the muscles of Cas’ back. He’s pushing down against Cas, soft moans falling from his lip with every push that hits his prostate just right, rising and rising and rising.
And then the man even dares to speak up again, and Cas sees red. “My roomie there is in pain. Didn’t allow himself to call for help.”
And maybe they wake up and shower together and go out for lunch and realize that this probably counts as their first date.
Dean tells him that Charlie will come pick him up, and Cas decides to wait with him for her to arrive. So they walk out together and Cas lets Dean lean on him while they wait for Charlie to come and pick Dean up in front of the hospital.
Dean has to fist his hands in the sheets beneath him, has to bite his lip, curl his toes, to fight the overwhelming urge to move, to push up into Cas’ mouth. “Shit, Cas, how the fuck-” but before he can finish his babbling, Cas looks up at him, eyes wide and a little teary, and starts bobbing up and down on Dean’s cock.
“So are you,” Cas murmurs, and Dean pulls the fry back from where it was on its way to his mouth and blinks up at him from under dark lashes.
With that, she and her waterfall of fiery red hair and her colorful tattoos are gone, the lights are turned off, and Cas — Cas falls asleep before he can even form another thought.
“Sure,” Cas says, blinking hard to keep his eyes open. He climbs off of Dean, drops his jeans and underwear to the floor and makes quick work of switching off the lights, padding through the dark room and climbing back to bed.
He looks down with a frown that is gone again in a second, replaced by a look of wide-eyed wonder. And then he’s looking straight at Dean, right into his eyes, mouth opening as if to say something — and then closing again, at a loss of words.
“Charlie,” she answers. “And I got two more cupcakes, if you feel like tasting chocolate heaven?” She’s already up and out of her chair before Cas can answer, presenting him with a cupcake in a little plastic tub.
Date four is mostly sharing funny childhood stories and eating a funky green-blue cake with Charlie and Gilda. Cas is so into the cake, Charlie has to swear to call them when they have shop leftovers again.
Something in Cas shakes, and again, he’s not sure whether that’s good or bad. “I think —  I’m going to sleep now, I think,” he says, trying to turn to his side to get comfortable, gasping when the burning pain increases. He sinks back down on his back, hoping that maybe he can try to sleep it away, but it feels like he’s being pulled apart and he can’t help a whimper.
.” The words are a little slurred, and Cas’ ears still feel a little like filled with cotton from the loud music at the party, but their impact is very clear anyway.
A look up at the clock above the door tells him that it’s only a little after 5 a.m., which thankfully means there is still a lot of time left until someone will come with breakfast. The simple thought of having to sit up and move his arms and eat makes his stomach turn.
“Date eleven, today. Told you I’d have you as long as possible. Longer than ten dates, if you have me.” There’s the most gentle of smiles on his lips, and he leans over to press a kiss to Cas’ lips.
When he gets back out, there’s a nurse finishing up on giving Dean his daily thrombosis shot. He’s out of his hospital gown now, too, wearing a thread-bare ACDC shirt and basketball shorts with legs so wide he managed to fit them over his cast. The nurse is helping him out of bed after the shot, showing him how to use his crutches and hobble around the room on one leg. It’s hard for him with his hurt hand and ribs, and every time he winces, Cas just wants to rush over and help him back to bed against all his better judgement.
They make him… feel all soft and gooey. Make him want a partner and a child running around his too-empty house, making his life a little louder and more colorful.
skilled with things other than dough and pastries, too, and he has to fight every single one of his instincts to not let this become more than heavy kissing out here on Charlie’s patio.
“Got a broken rib. ’s why they want to keep me here for a few days to make sure there won’t be any bleeding, or something. Bullshit, I tell you. I had a few broken ribs in my days, it’s never been a problem —  just had to rest a little,” he huffs, shuffling around on his bed. “Whatever, though. At least I got a good roomie, huh? We’re gonna have fun.”
And then he’s out of his chair and tackling Dean to the floor, and Dean looks all kinds of confused and he opens his mouth to ask, but Cas can’t help it anymore. He kisses Dean, soft but sure, and most importantly, sober. He kisses Dean sober, for the first time in their lives, and it’s better than anything he has ever experienced.
The kiss grows heavier, hotter, but Cas has to break away in a soft moan when he feels Dean’s hard cock twitch against his thigh.
“Sure,” Cas smiles, leaning back against the headrest and enjoying the way the sun shines at his face through the window. He puts his right hand between his chest and the seatbelt carefully, to minimize the pressure. “But could you please, for the love of god, drive a little smoother. I’m not sure I could survive one of your sharp turns today.”
Cas smiles, something cocky but gentle, and sinks down towards where Dean is rock-hard and straining against his blue boxers. Cas ducks down low, until his nose is buried in the soft fabric, so he can mouth along until he can wrap his lips around where Dean’s leaking so much, his precome is soaking through the fabric.
There’s a laugh bubbling from Cas’ throat before he knows it, and he breathes: “I really did, didn’t I?”
to tell him, anyway. Not like he should, but like he wants to. To get it out of the way, have Dean know. See how he reacts, if it even makes sense to feel this way, to come back tomorrow to see him. To make sure he’d still like Cas.
Cas looks miserable, suddenly, tired and drained, but when he looks down at his daughter, a loving smile stretches across his face.
“God, you’re the best,” Dean mumbles, eyes big. “Date eleven,” he adds quietly, when Cas goes back to unwrapping his own food.
Dean huffs, and there’s a soft pink blush forming on his cheeks. “Well, yeah. Didn’t think you heard that. We, um. We were out to celebrate a friend’s birthday, and we were at this pretty cool gay bar in town, right? And it’s always been a safe space, so far, but there was this burly, all-American, bigoted asshole, hauling slurs at Charlie and Gilda when they kissed. And I just —” He breaks off, looking down at his knuckles. “I just wanted to show him out, told him to shut the fuck up. But outside, he had his posse waiting. Things escalated a little.”
When he looks up at his doctor while she cleans his chest with cold, sharp disinfectant, she sends him the softest smile, and the tears start to roll.
When he manages on his own, the nurse leaves again and Dean gets back in bed, his leg raised on a pillow again, crutches leaning against the bed.
“Yes, Mr. Winchester. You’ll be here for at least three days. We will bring your clothes and belongings in a minute.”
“Good?” Cas asks while carefully wiping down Dean’s stomach, a smile on his face that is somehow half cocky and half nervous.
Cas tries to keep his eyes closed, but he hears a muffled “Thank you, really. I’m so proud of you.” and what sounds like the ruffling of blankets and cloth.
She’s wrinkling her small nose, tiny fingers grabbing and holding onto Dean’s shirt, and Dean’s heart burns in his chest. He barely notices when Cas leaves for the shower, can’t tell how much time passes until he steps back in. The fact that his hair is still damp, that he’s wearing sweatpants and a wide shirt that slips down his shoulder, shows his collar bone — that’s the only thing that manages to pull his attention from Claire for a little while.
And then it’s a blur of information and being bandaged up again and given and helped into his special binder, the one he needs to wear for the upcoming three weeks to make sure the healing goes well.
He doesn’t dare carry her while walking through the room, the way Cas suggests, but he carefully sinks down on the couch with Claire and rocks her in his arms.
And then it’s time for pain medication and lunch, chicken, rice and vegetables, and Cas gets up to give Dean his chicken and take half of his vegetables instead. He somehow ends up eating in the chair by Dean’s bed instead of on his own bed, and he spends his time watching Dean shovel food into his mouth and feeling way too delighted by it.
“That the loved ones, wanting to know how you’re doing?” Dean asks from across the room, smiling softly.
“Dean,” he says against Dean’s lips, very quiet and very gentle, and the way his warm breath brushes against Dean’s mouth has Dean shaking out of his skin with anticipation and need.
It takes him a while of uncoordinated blinking and thinking until he realizes where he is, why he’s here. And then the giddiness comes, sudden and overwhelming, when he looks down at his chest and there
Cas can’t hide a smile at the way the man’s nose wrinkles when he thinks about the cheese, like he can taste it all over again. “Thanks,” he says, a little surprised with how soft his voice sounds.
Date seven is meeting Dean’s brother Sam and Sam’s girlfriend Jess at a small Italian place. Cas is enamored with them, and Dean seems really happy about the way he and Sam connect over university and professors, and Jess and Cas find common ground in their love for painting.
He drops down and kisses him, and it’s a messy, uncoordinated thing, but it’s better than even their first kiss. Dean can taste his own come, can’t stop gasping for breath against Cas’ lips, still reeling from his orgasm, but he would give everything he has for this kiss to never stop.
She pulls the curtain back open again, before she leaves, and Dean’s on the other side of the room, headphones in his ears and purposefully looking up at the ceiling.
Dean nods eagerly, helping as Cas pulls off his pants and then removing Cas’ pants all the way. They are left in nothing but their boxers, Dean’s a deep red against Cas’ light blue ones, and Cas is momentarily distracted by it until Dean leans back up over him and kisses him once more.
Cas gets up after, for the first time all alone, and walks to the bathroom and carefully cleans himself a little, uses deodorant and brushes his teeth.
. He yawns, drops his head and buries his face in Dean’s neck. He spends a while like that, breathing against Dean’s skin while Dean desperately tries to will his racing heart to slow down. Eventually he softly murmurs something, lips moving against Dean’s pulse point and somehow both tickling him and making him desperate to arch up and demand more.
There’s a petite redhead next to his bed on a chair, speaking in a choked voice and sounding a little heartbroken.
Also, Cas is drunk. Cas is so drunk, he feels his heart in his stomach and his chest on fire. He’s so drunk, his ears are ringing and his fingers tingling. He’s so drunk, he imagined. He must have.
He tries, for a while, to keep his eyes away from Cas, who is now absolutely covered in flour, smudges on his shirt, his cheek and nose, even dusting his hair. His hands are a mess of white powder, but they are also… so broad, and gorgeous, and they look so skilled, folding the dough.
uses emojis. And then again, when he realizes that Cas is on Tinder and not looking for one night stands — but rather something serious?
Charlie just laughs, pushes the cupcake further into his space and says: “If you don’t take it, Dean will eat all three of them — and I’m pretty sure no doctor here would be happy about that. That boy’s diet is terrible as it is.”
It’s all a bit of a whirlwind then, her and a nurse moving towards Cas’ bed, pulling closed a curtain in the middle of the room to shield Cas from Dean’s gaze, and he couldn’t be happier about that.
Cas can tell how close he is by the way his noises are cresting, growing higher, and so he reaches between them with one hand to grab hold of Dean’s hard, leaking cock.
Good morning, dear, hope you’re all right? I met the loveliest ladies last night, tell me if you feel up to listening to my chatter and I’ll come by?
Before Cas can really spiral into an anxiety attack, worrying about how he will get out of this situation without seeming like a needy idiot who craved a cuddle so badly that he fell asleep on top of Dean, the smell of bacon fills the bedroom.
It takes a while before the cooling come on their stomachs bothers them enough to make them move apart and clean up.When they head home in Cas’ car, for the first time so far, they both head to Dean’s place. For the first time, they get to fall asleep for the night next to each other, arms and legs tangled and hearts warm and bright.
That’s also when his eyes fly open and down until he can watch, can see Cas’ cock for the first time, uncut and huge where it’s sticking out from the fly of his jeans, Cas’ hand wrapped around it. “Fuck, Cas,” Dean mumbles, dazed and dizzy, and grabs to hold onto Cas’ hip, to let his other hand cup Cas’ jaw, thumb dancing along Cas’ pink bottom lip. “Shit, Cas,” again, and the way Cas stutters, gasps, has Dean wishing for a faster recovery time.
“Fuck,” he swears, hand coming up to his head as he shuffles back from the table and stands up. “Fucking shit, that hurt.”
The heat pooling in Cas’ stomach isn’t stopping, and he suddenly desperately needs to touch Dean. His fingers are already working open the button of Dean’s jeans when his lips manage to pull away and form some words: “Can I? Need to touch you.”
They used to talk a lot more, back before Cas got custody of Claire. He’s an awesome guy, intelligent, sweet, compassionate, friendly, funny and just so good. They spent time with each other, hanging out in their gardens and living rooms, having dinner and drinking beer by Cas’ pool. Then Cas told him about his ex, about the baby that will be with him in a few months. Dean even helped him paint the room he conveyed to a nursery. They were friends. Dean was so close to asking him out… to try for more.
With a last smile, she reaches into her pocket and sneaks him a business card of Cake My Day, squeezing his hand and then turning to leave.
He jerks him, messy and with a grip just as firm as he knows Dean loves, once, twice, and Dean gasps, shakes, speaks: “Cas, Cas, love you, shit,” and then he comes all over his stomach and Cas’ hand, shaking and shivering and panting.
That is also when Cas gets his first good look at the guy, and unfortunately finds himself a little flustered, too. He must be about Cas’ age, his hair blonde and sticking up into all different directions where he’s half-buried in his pillow, eyes an intense green Cas can’t help but notice even from the distance.
“I’m Dean, by the way,” the man says, a little off-hand but with his eyes never leaving Cas. They follow when Cas carefully reaches out to grab his plate, filled with slices of bread, eggs and the honestly clumpy-looking cheese-spread Dean mentioned, and ignores the burning pull in his chest in order to gingerly pull the plate back onto his lap.
He closes his eyes, ready to try and wait the wave of pain out, when the door to his room suddenly opens and a wave of chatter and noise enters.
Cas doesn’t need to be told twice, so he dives down and catches Dean’s soft lips between his own. He tastes of tequila and lime and salt, and Cas feels suddenly very drunk on more than just cheap tequila. He doesn’t move away from Dean’s lips while he moves up, swaying a little on his way, to lean on his left elbow so he can let his right hand trail down over Dean’s chest and stomach.
Dean smiles, something soft and not at all cocky anymore, and then he licks his lips and says: “Can I kiss you, Cas?”
It’s spaghetti today, and they slurp up their noodles in silence until they are both done and move to finishing the small bowls of fruit salad they got for desert.
It’s hot and heavy and involves frantically grabbing hands, tongues and high pitched moans Dean will never admit he ever made — and he never wants to stop, ever again.
He’s not even by the reception when his phone buzzes in his pocket, and he rushes a little through signing everything, pocketing his prescriptions and instructions and thanking his nurses for how lovely they cared for him, before he walks out the door and pulls out his phone.
“We should,” Dean starts, and then he ducks back down and kisses him again, longer this time, lips moving gently against Cas’. When he moves back, he shakes his head a little, grinning. “We should eat, probably, before the food goes cold entirely.”
“I brought burgers, since you wouldn’t shut up about this place on main street?” Cas says, pulling Dean’s burger from the bag and handing it to him.
That rips Cas’ attention back towards him in an instant. Is Dean asking him for his acceptance? His consent? To have friends over?
Things like agreeing on maybe just straight up calling it “dating” instead, things like smiling lips meeting in more desperate kisses. Things like taking care of Cas’ morning wood, and like finally showing Cas what
Cas isn’t entirely sure how or why they started this arrangement, who of them first suggested the idea.
When they stop in front of his apartment complex, Cas leans all the way over the middle seat and Dean’s chunky cast and kisses him again, maybe more than once and until Charlie laughs and chucks a crumpled paper bag at their heads. “Get out,” she says, but only manages to look stern for a few seconds. “And come back soon.”
They have apple pie for desert, because Cas knows Dean too well, at this point. The last few pieces are a bit of a struggle, with Dean feeding him bites, watching with dark eyes as Cas wraps his lips around the fork. It’s charged between them. It has been charged for weeks, and both of them have a hard time holding back by now.
Tonight, Cas kisses Dean until he grows soft and slips out of him on his own. Tonight, Cas stays draped over Dean, buried in the softness of his skin. Tonight, ignoring the fuzz of alcohol on their tongues and the sweat and sticky come covering their bodies, they fall asleep in each other’s arms.
“You’re so hot,” Dean murmurs, only breaking their kisses when he mumbles praise of pants for breath. “I can’t wait to suck your dick someday.”
He only gets them up to a 90 degree angle when pain shoots through his chest, the strain of raising his arms pulling on tender skin and muscle-tissue. He bites down on his lower lip to quiet his whimper, carefully putting his arms back down onto the mattress again. He takes a few breaths, not too deep because that just makes his chest feel like it’s being pulled apart, ignores the stinging smell of disinfectant and curls his fingers into the bedding.
“Got into a fight with an asshole,” the man scoffs, and Cas can just imagine what type of fight it must have been. A drunken bar brawl, probably, what with it being early morning and the lilt in the man’s voice.
Dean’s face does the cutest things when he watches as Cas pulls out Ellen’s burgers and fries from a box.
Switching it on, it pings with three messages, and Cas can’t hide his smile. He knows they care, but he hadn’t let himself hope to get any texts or calls.
And Dean can only nod like crazy, his hands finding their way to the hem of Cas’ shirt and starting to pull without his permission. As soon as Cas’ shirt is gone and Dean gets ready to reach for his pants, Cas’ hands interrupt. They come down on Dean’s clothed stomach, dance around to his sides and up his back. Cas is watching his face with amazement, lower lip pulled between his teeth as his fingers explore Dean’s arms, make their way back down until they catch the hem of his sweater and gingerly pull it up and over his head.
“My doctor told me a nurse would come by around two for my last thrombosis shot and then… I would have to sign a few things and could leave,” Cas says eventually, looking at the clock to find it creeping closer to one already.
When the last bite is gone, Dean puts the cardboard box of pie to the side and reaches over, pulls Cas towards him and into a kiss so soft and cinnamon-sweet, Cas aches with it.
Time races, they only get interrupted once or twice when nurses come to help them to the bathroom or one makes Cas walk up and down the hallway once, and suddenly it’s time for dinner and Dean is telling Cas about his little brother Sam and their relationship around bites of his sandwich.
“No,” Cas laughs, head thrown back in a way that exposes his entire throat and makes Dean feel all weird inside.
“Thank you,” Cas says again, and then his eyes are suddenly drawn to the gorgeous swirling tattoos on the lady’s arm. “Your tattoos,” he says, brain spinning in a world of cotton. “Gorgeous.”
He ignores the man’s snickering when the nurse comes back with an IV bag, filled with something to lessen the pain.
It’s date eleven, and Dean has been without a cast for five days now but naturally still struggles with walking.
But then Cas took in Claire, and all his time and energy had to be on this little bundle of life. Obviously. Doesn’t mean Dean misses him less, though. And now, when Cas walks by his house, it’s not only just his gorgeous, hot friend — but also Cas, a soft and caring and sweet father to a tiny, cute baby.
He finds Dean in nothing but his boxers, shoveling bacon and scrambled eggs onto two plates. Cas stops dead in his tracks in the doorway, can’t help but take a few seconds to stare at all the miles of tan, freckled skin exposed to the soft morning light that streams through the window. Dean’s still humming softly when Cas steps further into the room, murmuring a careful “Good morning,” that startles Dean so much, a strip of bacon falls down and slaps against the tiles. Cas feels his stomach fall.
“You could always — I mean. Not that you want to, probably, but. I mean, you could visit me tomorrow,” Dean mumbles. “No, that was probably a horrible idea, you want to get out of here and not come back for as long as possible.”
Dean grumbles, and she reaches out to punch his shoulder. “Hey, ouch! Don’t hurt the patients! Rude.”
Cas’ brother Gabe bursts in on date eight at Cas’ place and then refuses to leave them alone. They end up watching a few pretty terrible comedies together and stuffing themselves with the caramel popcorn Gabe brought. The night ends up being really nice, even though Gabe’s presence prevents them from the heated make-out they have been anticipating and teasing each other about through texts all week.
They both sway a little while pulling off their boots, and once that’s done and Dean dumps his jacket on the chair by Cas’ table, he doesn’t know what to do. He finds himself watching as Cas sheds his jacket and sweater and turns around towards Dean, and then a few more very awkward seconds of staring follow.
They keep talking while Cas packs up his stuff and his stomach grows heavier, and when the nurse comes in for Cas’ shot he feels a little sad.
to do with the fact that, for whatever stupid reason, Dean feels all fuzzy and happy and warm around this stupid, scruffy, handsome, dark-haired and blue-eyed Cas-guy.
Dean just sits there and smiles a smile so bright, it must be pulling on his split lip.  “Cheers,” he says, raising his half-eaten cupcake up into the air again.
Charlie was right, Cas is pretty sure this is what heaven tastes like, and he tells her so around a mouthful of cream-cheese frosting.
And then Dean starts circling his fingers around Cas’ cock and stroking him in a way that has him seeing stars in mere minutes.
Date five was supposed to be a Scrabble night but ends in a lot of kissing on Dean’s couch and a few Scrabble letters poking Cas’ ass when he ends up sitting on the table between Dean’s spread legs, hands in Dean’s hair.
He makes air quotes with his fingers, and Dean wants to both scream and kiss him. All he actually manages to do is blink with wide eyes.
“I, um. I need to make a call,” he announces to no one in particular. “I need to — I’ll be out back.”
And now that Cas kisses him deep and needy and so goddamn soft, now that his jean-clad erection is pressing against Dean’s, his naked chest against Dean’s, their hearts beating against one another, he doesn’t want to let go ever again. He actually feels a lot like Cas is taking a part of him with him when he pulls back, but Dean thankfully manages to only make a tiny sad noise while he watches Cas sink back down between his legs.
“Are you happy?” she asks quietly, and Cas chokes a little on a sob and nods a heavy, smiling, tear-stained
“So,” Cas starts again, a little unsure of where he’s even going. “So you’re looking the way you are because you defended Charlie from someone?”
When they move inside, Cas gets to know Rufus, Dean’s new roommate. He’s a little grumpy, but they find topics of shared interest, and Cas stays until after Dean’s doctor sees him for the last time and he gets to check out and go home.
“Huh, alright,” Dean breathes in response, coughing over Benny’s snort of laughter. “Okay, but, c’mon on. Some hair pulling, right? Doin’ it doggy?”
And leaves Dean with a wildly beating heart and Claire babbling in his arms. And he has never felt better.
“I wasn’t sure — That’s very sweet, thank you, Dean,” Cas says, and his chest feels warm and fuzzy again. “I would love to stay for breakfast.”
Dean has seen the guy a handful of times, mostly at Charlie’s parties or when out and about with her — it’s only been six times that Dean is aware of, actually. Not that he counted. Well. He did, maybe, count a little.
“Says you,” Dean grins, trying for cocky but ending up soft. And then his hands are back and pulling on Cas’ shirt, loving but insistent. “I want to see you, please.”
“I can’t, Charlie,” Dean says eventually, voice gentle. “I can’t. I’d do it again, you know that. You’re like my little sister — but even without that, I’d have done it. It might have taken me a while, to accept myself, but I won’t ever let anyone get hurt the way I was. So, can’t make any promises.”
, now. He remembers that he’s currently all bandaged up, that “there will be swelling during the first couple of days that will go down eventually”.
“I would like to continue this — But first, if you don’t mind, I’d like to let you hold her a little longer and take a quick nap? I will be much more entertaining once I got an hour of sleep,” Cas chuckles, and before Dean can protest — not like he would ever decline the opportunity to hold Claire a little longer, to help Cas a little more — he shuffles down until he’s sinking   into the couch and his head is pressing against Dean’s thigh.
“She mentioned I’d probably have to stay for another day, and then come back in a week to get a new cast,” Dean sighs, gently touching the scar on his chest. “I can’t believe I’ll have to live with this huge chunky thing for another three to four weeks.”
They barely have time to get out of their shirts and underwear before Dean rolls them, maneuvers Cas on top and between his legs. Cas hides a smile in Dean’s shoulder, plays it off by pressing kisses along his hot skin, making his way up along Dean’s neck and towards his mouth.
Dean makes a soft noise against his lips, and it’s all Cas can do to pull away and look into his eyes, green and clear and very very focused, and say: “I love you too, Dean.” And then Cas is pulled back down into another kiss.
Cas laughs, watching the way Dean’s eyes are bright, his freckles even more pronounced in the sunlight. “Well, you told me exactly how you like your bacon cheeseburger several times. And even if you hadn’t, you seem to be a regular there and everyone knows your order by heart, if Ellen is to be believed.”
“That’s — That’s really, really amazing of you, to defend your friends like that. I’m sorry you got hurt like this, though,” Cas says quietly, and Dean smiles softly.
It started sometime during meeting number three, and Dean can’t really explain what exactly about the
Dean sings along to the songs Cas’ favorite 80s radio station is playing, loud and enthusiastic, his head back against the headrest, and the sun is shining through the windows and lighting him up.
And Dean tries to catch his breath for all but ten seconds, before he realizes there are more important things. Things like pulling Cas down and kissing him soft and gentle, morning breath be damned. Things like wrapping Cas in his arms and telling him: “Yes. Whenever, however. As many times as you want.”
She piles her hair up and uses what Dean thinks might be a zip tie to hold it in place. “Sam told me some of what he wants. If you’re fucking with Dick Roman and H34V3N, I’m all in. But you need magic, too, and I have a partner. She’s going to want something in the form of payment, she could give a shit about AI rights.”
The sound of students in the street below filters up, vague distant laughter and music played too loud. Friday night in town, the beginning of the bacchanalia. While summer on campus is quiet, every student who has an apartment in town has to stay. Summer also brings tourists from the city, and the combination is loud every weekend.
“Sounds like you need help from Sam, or maybe even some of his friends. I’ll have a talk with him when I wake up.”
Dean lets out a soft laugh. “Well, they only had a few weeks to work on it. It doesn’t need to be good, only provocative.”
“Not fair! We come to have a good time, and then you just attack me?” He wilts, hanging his head, and crossing his arms, turning away.
“But you are, Dean. Your mother and I were wed, not that long ago. You may have heard - or, wait. Did you? She tends to forget she even has an older son. In the end there, she seemed to have forgotten that she was married, too. I have to say, John had everything in the world, but he was so unable to hold onto it.”
The steps of the church are strewn with violets and rose petals. Sam looks a little disturbed as they proceed up, forced to step on them, although he tries hard to avoid it. The sweet smell is sickly and cloying. They’re all over the inside of the church too, impossible to miss as they take their places at the front near the marble altar. Behind it is the famous window, installed by Dean’s great-great grandfather - a huge series of glass panes taking up one entire wall, the waterfall’s thunderous noise muffled to near silence. Beyond that are the distant mountains that ring the country, and above it, the vast sky. In between each pane are stained glass depictions of the Kings of Mordavia fighting monstrosities - werewolves and vampires for the most part. The Mordavian coat of arms, complete with real crossed swords, hangs on either side. One for the Royalty, one for the people.
Dean throws his phone at the wall, making it crack and go dead. The room behind him has gone silent. He buries his face in his hands. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”
Rowena pipes up, “Yes, dear. Magic and technology infused into that lovely chip in your head. He gave you a place that you’d always remember as safe to talk to your handsome Angel, and wove a secret into it.”
Dean puts a bottle of soda down. “Sadly, the library hasn’t restocked that thing any time in the last decade. Diet Orange or Diet Sprite?”
“Any other day,” Dean drops and slides under them as they lunge, coming up behind them, “I would love to oblige you both.”
Castiel sits up in a smooth motion, his hands sliding up Dean’s arms. “Is that what you want to talk about, my prince?”
They head off through the crowd, and Dean thinks, despite the heat, that this is the best summer he’s ever had.
try to get in the way to take pictures. Wiping blood out of his eye and flicking the congealed clot onto the ground with a splat, he tries to get a bead on it, but it keeps dodging around the cars. Kevin’s turned all the lights red so he’s not dealing with traffic, but all the same, terrified people will do a lot of weird things. Like try to take a selfie with a werewolf. Castiel reaches the moron with the camera and simply picks the grown man up as if he weighed less than a toddler, running off with him over one shoulder, ignoring the shouts of protest.
