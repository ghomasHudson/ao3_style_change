Cas growled, thrusting into him harshly, violently, so fucking perfectly, filling him so good. But as soon as Dean was close, Cas relented, slowing the pace. Dean growled, moving against him, craving him. He knew his face was just full of embarrassing want.
Sam out, there was no way that rope was going to budge. The lightning barely singed the rope. “Just let me go! I got a candy man to lick like a lollipop,”
His phone buzzed again, slipping out of his fingers and onto the beer stained floor. After a moment of silence, the phone buzzed again, this time by Eileen. And he knew he should at least attempt to pick up the phone.
Had...had Jack not brought Gabriel out of the Empty? He had brought back everyone else, there had been this whole bullshit huzzah about how all the archangels were up there in heaven, making everything right. Well, at least that was what Jack had told them. The archangels -- sans Lucifer and Michael -- because, for what he knew, those two had been killed by God -- and Michael ganking Lucifer with the archangel blade.
Fuck sakes, it was almost Halloween, he and Cas had plans tonight. They were going to do their annual scary movie night with his brother and his brothers asshole of a trickster boyfriend. But no, he had been stuck with the douchebag king and a stupid new age tech-fangled car. He hated new age cars, preferring vintages like his Baby. But he was the owner, he didn't get a choice.
Ah, and he would never know. Nah, Sam was going to be a lawyer; he was going to go out there and save the world. He was going to find some gorgeous girl, get married and crank out beautiful babies.
Gabriel Novak prided in himself – not so much his surname, because being a Novak always felt heavy on his head – but in himself as a sorcerer. He was nowhere near as good as his fellow brothers as a wizard and sorcerer, but he was able to hold his own in so many ways they were unable to.
Gabriel had swapped the open sign for closed about an hour ago while he worked on his latest creation – though majority of that time was him staring at Sam, but that was neither here nor there. Sam hadn’t even noticed the time. He gazed up when Gabriel approached him however, his hazel green eyes wide as he looked around and noticed the rest of the shop was completely empty.
It sounded so simple when Dean said it like that, with so much determination and enthusiasm in his expression. For a long moment, Sam actually believed they would be able to do it. Hell, why not? They had done so many other impossible feats before this, so why not crash land into the Empty, the one place they hadn’t really been into, and get Cas back.
Gabriel forced himself to not succumb to those eyes, to that kiss bruised mouth, and those pretty pinked cheeks, he forced his hands to stay far away from that head of hair, though he was desperate to tangle his fingers in them and see if they were as soft as they looked.
Maybe Gabriel hadn't been resurrected -- or what the fuck ever -- and this was...what? Another fucking sign or something? Maybe they wouldn't be able to get him back, and that meant that without Gabriel's help -- not that he was sure how that shit was going to work, but Sam seemed to have some kind of idea, he hoped -- they wouldn't be able to get Cas back.
Flipping through the slightly yellowing pages of his spell book, he stopped at a hand written spell written in his own missive. A spell to see snippets of the past. It was crude and had the chance of not working to its full effect, but it should work well for what he wanted. He chanted the spell like it was second nature to him, like it was as easy as breathing to channel his essence, his power, and bring it out with his lilting words.
Castiel’s astral projection returned quickly back into his body. He shot up, sucking in a deep breath as if he had just come out of water and was trying to catch his breath. Dean got up next to him, looking at him with such alluring bright eyes. Brighter than usual, Cas noted. They were usually so lovely and beautiful to look at, but there was something different about them right now, something almost hazy.
Cas worked his fingers in and out of Dean’s hole, imitating what he really wanted to be doing, and what he would most likely be doing. Thrusting in and out of his tight, wet and warm hole, savouring the whines and moans escaping his lips, he bobbed his head against and again, sucking sweetly at Dean’s cock, working his mouth and tongue in a circle at the head of his cock, bringing Dean to an earth shattering orgasm.
Clutching on the bedspread beneath him, dragging the material from its sides, his green eyes fluttering open to stare at the beautiful Cas’s face. He watched as Cas stood back, stripping his shirt and undershirt off. His chest was surprisingly muscular, but Dean had soon lost all interest in his chest as he watched Cas’s hands move to his jeans. He watched breathlessly as the black material slid down his thighs and legs.
that happened after. There was a reason why Sam kept Gabriel’s memories in a locked box at the back of his mind after the archangel had died. But…there had to be a reason why his memories came back to him in this moment right? Jack had given them free will, but he was sure Jack was also nudging them forward.
He felt something wet and cool on his forehead first, drops of liquid dripping down his skin to the side of his face, pooling behind his ears. There was someone above him, someone who was moving around. He felt the touch next, hands pressed against his own, holding them close to a warm chest, so close he could feel the quick thudding heart beating.
Oh and there were those nicknames, they always gave him hope, like starlight in the darkness. Sam would never be able to have something like that, he was not there yet.
from the sleeve of his trench coat, and smirked wickedly, advancing at Dean with agonisingly slow steps. He slipped the blade under the rope, slicing it clean apart, but he left a panting, wide eyed hunter in his wake. Dean’s heart was hammering, adrenaline pumping, his instincts switching to overdrive.
“Hmm…no bite,” She wrinkled her nose almost cutely, but didn’t sound like she was nerved by them. She sounded somewhat ancient, like she knew way too much, and wasn’t that fucking perfect. Dean was ready to thump the next person who kept things away from him all because they wanted to be mysterious and shit. It didn’t help anyone. “Alright, let me explain it to you then,”
“Son of a bitch Cas,” He bit out a groan, unable to move as Cas’s fingers dipped into his loosened hole, playing with different strokes and caressed that made him melt. He no longer knew if Cas was doing this purely to relax him or if he had other plans. “You’re hands are fucking awesome,”
He had seen the way his magic bloomed as it seeped into Sam’s own skin, the way it sped up its incursions, the way the very vine like ministrations he had expected to surround Sam in his protection, and the way they literally grew, wrapping and trapping and soothing before sinking into Sam, intent to stay there.
Cas come. But Cas was moving so swiftly, so perfectly, Dean couldn’t help but scream, urging him on. Every thrust became more and more unrelenting. Cas leaned down and bit into the flesh at the curve of Dean’s neck, sinking into the skin and holding him tight.
Pushing those hands away was a pointless feat, because Sam Winchester was a giant moose of a man, and holy fuck, when the man wanted to, he could hold Gabriel down – willingly mind you, - and do whatever the fuck he wanted with him.
be more. It fell short, and that made Cas worry. As soon as he was able to, having fed Dean as much of his magic as he could, he reached down and scooped Dean right up in his arms. Cradling Dean close to him, he made his way into his home.
“Look, I get it.” Sam stated, sitting opposite his gleaming brother and trying to get his head around just what Dean was expecting them to do. He had thought, with God replaced by a much better one, that they could have a moment to just rest and relax. “I wanna get Cas back too, but we can’t just walk into the Empty’s hideout and force her to give Cas back,”
Ye-no, not kiss him. No, he was angry at the angel. Right? Yeah. He was angry that Cas had just sprung all of that shit on him and bounced. Yeah, Dean was angry at him. But if it lead to anything more, he wasn't going to stop hi...
was he talking about? Who was he kidding; he was so flustered around the mage. He was just a stupid little magician; he didn’t belong in the shadows of such a great man.
But then again, Dean thought to himself, after all the shit they had been through every time they tried to do anything summoning-like, was most likely piss poor due to the douche bag Chuck holding the reigns. He must have been fucking something up to make his story all the more enticing and exciting for himself.
“We searched,” Sam stated, pointedly. “The first time Cas was in the Empty, we looked everywhere and we found nothing,”
“Cas?” Dean’s voice was all sorts of lilting and deep, and Cas suddenly had the image of them wrapped in a loving embrace, whispering words of love and hope for their future together. All because Dean had said his name like
“Cas!” Dean cried his name with a moan, feeling the heat ignite with a searing pleasure that coursed through his bod. He convulsed with a cry of pleasure. Castiel fed in his release, sucking harder and stretching Dean open for his later invasion, forcing his thighs open with his shoulders as Dean tried to shut them, screaming his name.
He loved Dean’s eyes, the way they flashed when he was angry, the way the corners crinkled when he laughed, and how they turned to liquid when he gave Cas
“Sorry baby,” he apologised, but he wasn’t really sorry and they both knew it. Dean needed this after all.
Wait…why was he thinking about Gabriel? The archangel hadn’t been on the forefront of his mind for years now. Why was he suddenly — maybe…
“Yes, Dean,” Cas grinned, sweeping a hand down Dean’s cheek, curling his fingers around his chin and lifting his head up. His gaze was like sin. “I know all of your deepest and darkest secrets, you are very interesting indeed, and there is so much I have in store for you,”
But now it seemed, with Jack doing that whole 'subliminal signs in the right direction' quip to make sure everyone still had free will real and centred, it was surprisingly easy. The sigils and markings on the ground seemed surprisingly soothing, smoother and more...well, he wasn't gonna say perfect, but they weren't as sloppy as before. His memory of regurgitating the asshole archangels from wherever the fuck they had been, was actually pinpoint perfect, if he did say so himself.
Dean remembered. They had been fighting about his heritage, about his last name, about his family. What an idiotic thing to be fighting about? Castiel was his friend, his confidante, his…Castiel was his…he was…he…he was Castiel.
Cas stood towering over him, casting a glorious shadow. He liked the way Dean looked, sprawled over the sheets like he had been thrown there, tied up and ready to be taken. He raised his eyebrow, starting to really like this game.
The bright thing zipped around Dean, circling his head, and then ricocheted out into the skies, disappearing to wherever it was he had gone. And then Dean’s body arched up from the grass, skin taut and a gasp escaping his lips. And then something happened that even Castiel couldn’t understand.
Dean growled, closing his eyes and wishing for a moment of peace. Frustration roiled in his stomach, but he didn’t let it run. This was Cas after all. But his head was pounding with ache, like it was threatening to burst through his skull.
Dean knew what that look meant. He shivered as Cas continued, working on the sides of his chest, fingers dancing almost sensually to the centre.
Sam's body held a healthy golden glow for a few moments, his body arching a little at the new intrusion, before he settled back to his normal, casual stance. He held a hand to his chest, pressing his palm flat against his heart.
“Okay, get them to the cabin. We need to figure out what—” Castiel started to say, but then Gabriel heard a few more weird sounds, followed by something that sounded a lot like Dean and then a whole lot of crashing before the phone was suddenly cut off.
Dean took the bottle without comment, slow and steadily moving so he was half off the sofa so he could drink. It wasn’t the most comfortable position, but it was the one he felt he was able to do without hurting himself. Cas hummed sympathetically, running his hand over Dean’s shoulder. Without thinking, Dean leaned into his hand, feeling those fingers east along his muscles.
Cas’s cheeks tinged a deep red at the thoughts running through his head. Though Gabriel had done a good job, in Castiel’s mind, Dean would at least be shirtless, the ropes would be silk and the chair would be wide enough for Castiel to straddle Dean…
She had said it was a seraph, and the only seraph he knew that he was in close contact with for god only knew how many years was Cas. But…that wasn’t…him…was it?
If only he could just…be a bit more braver. In his fantasy, he’d have already taken Gabriel, pushed him up against the table and kissed him until they were so exhausted from it that they would be whisked away into the beautiful aftermath of an earth shattering kiss.
Sparks lit up inside him, fire smouldering deep inside him. Cas kissed with a ferocity he had never imagined possible.
That meant there was something that he was getting sloppy – not wanting to sound pompous, but that was so not likely – or the attack hadn’t been for him.
Sam would have him. Yes, there was no way he was going to let this man go. But for tonight, he was going to wait for his results, and try to pass his class.
But they hadn’t, and he didn’t want to pry until his brother was ready. It must have been a wild ride for Dean to find out that he was in love with his male best friend.
Cas grabbed him by the knees, so calmly, pulling them apart as far as they would go with his ankles still tied, he pressed long and hot kisses to Dean’s thighs. Dean was so sensitive and Cas’s tongue was so hot. He made sure not to neglect any part of his flesh, especially his hole, stretching it open with his tongue and fingers.
He hadn’t exactly been all that positive about it. If the Men of Letters hadn’t been able to find a way after scouring years upon years of hard research and actual practicality, and had not even
Cas grinned, and holy shit he was a demon right there as he cleaned Dean up of his release. His beautiful angel. There was nothing more relaxing than a good massage after all. Cas didn't stop there, and worked down his thighs, taking his sweet time in easing Dean to the ultimate state of relaxation, his mind intent on the job before him. It was the least he could do after all.
Dean just lay there with his eyes closed, just letting the day waste away. He looked so calm and so serene. As if he hadn’t just confused Cas’s world six ways to Sunday.
Cas shook his head, shaking his head and grasping harder at his toes, pressing his thumbs into the arches, smiling to himself when he heard the lovely groan release from Dean’s lips. Every drop of tension that had worked in him had vanished. Cas smiled at his job well done, letting Dean go, laying feather light kisses up Dean’s legs,, travelling higher and higher up his body, pressing a pressured kiss at the tip of Dean’s cock. He knew Dean was too sensitive to the touch, it would be easy to get him off here and now, but this wasn’t about that.
“You didn’t even see me slip something into your drink, hunter? You’re losing your touch,” Cas murmured, eyes half lidded as he moved around the room, his heels clicking on the ground. Damn it, Dean knew he has seen Cas at the bar! “It’s like you wanted me to capture you,”
They had lasted a good week without worrying about any supernatural entities. But god damn it, he needed Cas back. If only to just...have him back. Dean was really missing his low drawl, the one that sounded like rolling thunder and heavy rain...not that he noticed or anything. It wasn't like he missed the way Cas's nose scrunched up cutely whenever he was confused, or the way the corner of his eyes crinkled whenever he was happy. Or the way his hands moved whenever he had his angel blade in his hands. And he definitely wasn't thinking what it would be like to have something
“Tell me, Dean,” he breathed as his hands ran over his body, Smiling in satisfaction, he reached back to Dean’s cock, pumping him in slow, slick, sweet moves. Up and down, slick and sweet languid motions, feeling Dean trembling in his arms. He lowered his head and pressed a kiss to the head of his cock, running his tongue in small circles along the head and sucking down on it, hearing as Dean whimpered, holding back his moans.
Sam reached for Gabriel then, making the shorter mage startle a step back. Fortunately, the ropes only got him so far. He looked down to them, growling almost like a rabid animal, and lunged once again. The chair below him creaked, and before Castiel could cast a spell to stop him, the chair shattered into pieces. Sam got up, rope loose on his wrists. He grabbed onto Gabriel and suddenly, they were gone.
Dean’s magic pulsed a little, like a car revving up and making his way back to consciousness, back to Cas. Castiel’s heart beat madly in his chest, jack rabbiting, threatening to burst.
Dean hadn’t noticed he had been talking out loud. Sam pressed a hand to his shoulder, just under where Cas’s hand print was scarred onto his skin — the one and only thing he had left of Cas, that and his previous trenchcoat he had left all those years ago when he had swallowed the god damn Leviathans — and patted him softly.
The only time Dean had seen his grace was when they were in need of it, or when Cas was bleeding out, caught by bad guys and needing to be saved.
He had been nursing the same drink for almost an hour before he finally gave up and decided to leave. He made his way to through the crowd and to the door, but bumped into whoever was entering. Murmuring a quick sorry, he looked up at the person he bumped into and his breath caught in his throat.
“He…well, he did quite a number on you.” She continued, giving Dean a look, mostly at his chest, as if she saw something there other than his shirt and flannel. He shuddered, and not in the good way. What the fuck was this old woman? “It’s surprising you’re not aware of it. But I guess you’ve always been a little hard headed, must be all that stuff your dad told you,”
But no, he had yelled instead. He had let his emotions get the better of him and he had yelled at his best friend. At his…at…at the man he loved.
Cas appeared at the kitchen door with a beer bottles in his hands, raising an eyebrow. Dean groaned, looking away from Cas, growling into the cushions. Maybe it was stupid to expect to be alone in the living room, but he did not want to move from his position. He hoped that his face in the cushions was enough of a message for Cas to leave him alone for the night.
Cas wasn’t gone. Not really. He was still out there, still alive. Still kicking. He just wasn't here. Dean wasn’t going to believe that his best friend, his angel, was up and dead. He couldn’t do that. No way. There had to be a way. There was always a way. There had to be something. They had killed Death, taken down God, Amara and all those god damn assholes.
People however. Castiel had never heard of any successful instances where the spell to cloning had created someone as a perfect clone. Either they looked completely different, or they were unresponsive. And those were the
“You are looking for Crowley,” Her voice sounded like chiming bells as she spoke, walking through the crowd around her.
a…I don’t know, an out, a way to find out what to do. He wouldn’t just leave his dad in the Empty, right?”
But this…this was…not it. It wasn’t the immediately intoxicating lightning storm Cas was used to, it was like…a small monsoon, like there
But that was when he saw the spell coming from the corner of his eyes, a big bright blur that moved with such speed, it had big round, pupil-less eyes, and a wide mouth with what looked like fangs at the corner of it. It zipped through the air and through Castiel’s astral projected body and straight into Dean. Castiel witnessed Dean’s eyes widening as the thing spilled into his chest, he curled over in on himself and gasped out loud. The thing moved straight through him, phasing through him and throwing him back with the force of it.
“I will give you a Rifter, it will lead Naomi to her goal.” Crowley’s twisted lips lifted up into a smirk. He stepped closer to the mage. “Be warned, this is not for the faint heart. Keep my Rifter hidden, locked away, or she will cause havoc."
“Hush, Dean,” Cas replied, turning around and looking at Dean. He was hidden somewhat in the darkness of the room, but his eyes were bright, filled with…
He didn’t want to brag, but he did think himself a connoisseur of the mystical arts of creation magic. He was strong, stronger than most out there, and he was all by himself, no familiar to help siphon his magic, or keep him sane whenever he tried a new spell or something much more powerful than he allowed himself to do.
He sighed. Yeah, now wasn’t the time to think about that. Pushing off the lamp post, he made his way passed the party and club goers and back home. Home wasn’t too far away. But each step he took forward felt like a great effort, like something was holding him back. He felt like he was moving through sludge, it was tiring him out to the point where he collapsed onto the ground, slamming harshly onto his knees. But he didn’t really feel the impact.
Halloween fell on a stupid day this year. A Thursday. Not close enough to the weekend to enjoy the night out. All his friends had congregated however, for a few drinks and a great time. It was good to see everyone again. Work had really taken over. But then again, they really shouldn’t have to make excuses to meet up on the regular.
“Yeah, I’m almost done,” Sam replied, not saying anything about the nickname. Gabriel always used a new nickname for him every day, he had just gotten used to it. He had that puppy dog look on his face, silently asking if it was okay for him to stay just a little bit longer. Gabriel let out a breath; Sam really was working himself to death nowadays.
Hell, Dean would do the same for him, relax him from his tensions and make him pliant and soft and beautiful as he moaned sweetly, cutely. Fuck.
He couldn’t think. That mouth was sucking on his skin, that tongue licking and slathering along his flesh, and those teeth – good god, those teeth grazed alongside that tongue and it made literal lightning ricochet from his mouth and straight into Gabriel’s muscles. It was such an odd feeling, those sparks, they made him jump in their minuscule jolts, but at the same time, they sunk into his skin, straight to his muscles and calmed him down.
Gabriel reached forward, taking hold of Sam in his arms. He struggled with the larger man, but easily moved him to the booth, laying him down. Sam’s legs bent over the side, his large body fitting in the booth.
“I was thinking about that,” Dean stated, leaning back on the kitchen chair. He placed the beer bottle on the table and played with the label. “So like, we need to summon the Empty right, to get into it? There’s gotta be some lore around here that’d help us,”
Gabriel sighed, seeing that huge back walk away from him once again. What he didn’t notice was the big black ball of light zip through Sam, straight through his body and stop right in front of Gabriel. The little ball looked up at him with those beady pupil less eyes before zipping off through the window and out again,
on the way Dean was curled into his right side, warm and sweet, smelling like a forest and metal, those thick muscular arms wrapped possessively around his middle.
“You’ve got an archangel in you, dearie.” She pressed her finger to Sam’s chest. Sam’s gaze darted down to her finger and then up to her face. God, she was so close. “I just want to know which one,”
Sam glared at his brother, pressing his hands to his chest, the ball of light held between the space of his palms, shining a little brighter.
Sam reached for it, but the old lady slapped his hand. She handed the bauble to Dean, who reached slowly for it. She pressed it into his hand, curling his fingers around it. It was light, almost weightless, and the swirls seemed to move within the bauble itself.
He saw his lovely Dean on the ground before him, he looked completely unconscious. His heart almost stopped, his face drained of all colour. Castiel was quick to his side, muttering a spell and holding his hand over Dean’s prone body.
"Stop moving around!” Dean whined, grabbing onto Castiel’s middle and forcing him back down onto the ground.
“Oh, this is going to be fun,” his grin caused worry to Castiel’s heart. He reached forward in haste, in an attempt to push Gabriel out of the way, but the sleeping Sam was much quicker.
It was oddly mesmerising, kinda therapeutic, like looking at fish in a fish tank. He was kinda enthralled with the wispy colours.
"Hey Gabe," Sam's voice was so soft, so small as he stepped over the painted sigil on the ground and over to the small ball of light. Dean watched, infatuated, as Sam slowly held his hands up to it, curling his fingers around the small ball of light. "You're...back,"
Gabriel was so damn sure that hottie in the corner was the familiar for him. He could feel it deep in his bones, right down in his soul. It was like the hottie was screaming at him, telling him to come and bond with him, to take him as his own familiar. They could share their strengths, their magic, their powers – and if Gabriel played his cards right, he’d want to share
He saw the ball of light fizzle a little, shivering and shaking in Sam's hands, before it zipped out and thumped harshly against Dean's groin. He hit him hard enough for the hunter to double over in pain and catch his breath. Dean groaned at the sudden pain, putting pressure on the ache.
Then again, it only seemed right, after all they had the summoning of angels and demons down to an art form.
He grinned, hearing Dean moaning, hips gyrating under his silky touch. It was like he was yearning for him. So Cas continued to torment him, licking inside, tracing moist patterns on his skin. When he finally moved to his cock, Dean jumped.
Wait, what the fuck was she saying. What seraph was in him? There wasn’t god damn angel possessing him, was there? Sam hadn’t told him, and he definitely hadn’t been having any blackout or weird moments or some shit like that. Like the way Sam had been when he had been possessed by Gadreel. He crossed his arms over his chest, shrugging away the woman’s hold around his shoulder. Fuck, she was strong for an old lady. “I ain’t got no angel in me,”
Her gaze dropped to the little ball of light making a circle around the house, and she heard a thick sound of footsteps. The Rifter shuddered, as if the sound was pulling it, nagging at it to find out who it was. Naomi felt it before she saw it, the incessant thumping sqealch of footsteps on the thick with mud ground, each timed thud pulling her closer, luring her to its siren song. She stood a few feet in front of the building and saw a young blonde mage she despised walking through the street.
, lust. His angel was so turned on right now. And Dean was ready to go whenever Cas got like that. “Let me do this for you,”
Yeah, no. Dean wasn't going to go anywhere near that with a barge pole. He instead let out a small smile, glad for the win, and patted his brother on his back. Silently telling him that if anything happened, he tell him. Sam nodded, knowing exactly what he was thinking.
Dean couldn’t open his eyes all the way; they felt heavy and laden with something that made his insides turn. The thrumming ache in his chest felt like he had been hit by a truck. And there was a thick sand-like taste on his tongue. It almost made him want to throw up, or dash for a pitcher of water and drink it until the taste disappeared.
It…it stemmed to goodness, to heaven, to what made life amazing. He had no thoughts of doing anything bad. Or evil. He felt almost like he was a
“Cassie, you gotta help me,” Gabriel said, raising the phone to his ear and not letting his little brother talk at all. Castiel was a strong witch, he had all sorts of strengths and magic, and though Gabriel was strong in his own right, his magic was woven within his things, Castiel’s magic wasn’t.
Dean still came here, every night since, when he knew Sam was out doing an errand, or asleep, or just busy with whatever the hell he and Eileen did on their dates. He didn’t want Sam to see him like this. To see him mourning over something that happened so…so quickly. The whiplash of having him there, having him
Dean’s eyes were drawn to his thick cock, the shape a shadow against the fabric of his underwear. Fuck, he was already so hard.
Urged by a force unknown, she placed the pendant around her neck, clasping it into place. As soon as she did so, Naomi suddenly felt something push against her navel. She clenched her eyes closed at the sudden pain. But when she opened them, she saw she wasn’t in her room any more.
mourning for his angel brother. When Dean had told them that Cas had gone, they really hadn't had the
Gabriel had already showered him with all sorts of sweet treats, ‘on the house’ he had said, ‘try these so I can see if they are good enough to sell’, and each and everything he had put on a plate was absolutely divine.
to mourn. But once they had taken down Chuck, and everything had been restored, Sam had taken a moment, a long moment, to really sit and mourn everyone he had lost along the way. He hadn't been alone, Dean had been right there with him. But if this was Dean’s way of mourning for Cas, then Sam needed to get him back on the right track.
The old lady held it up to her face, making the tendrils stretch a little more. Dean didn’t understand why his body moved with them, why he was eager to have it back inside of him, rather than glad it was out. Who the fuck had put that in him in the first place? Not many people had the jump on him, especially with something that screamed
heard of doppelganger spells, twinning wasn’t exactly a new thing. Many people had made clones and duplicates of things to help them. The only problem was that the twin was always
Fuck, he felt sick, he felt faint. His heart beat maddened, weeping for what he had lost. What he could no longer have. Why hadn't he said anything, why hadn't he held Cas close to him. Why hadn't he
This had to be something strong, something powerful, something so ancient. So much so that it wasn’t even in Castiel’s spell book; and his book had been passed down for centuries. It had everything, good spells and bad.
Did that mean this…weird pixie ball of light had been inside him…from the beginning? Maybe…from when…when he had first met Cas? Or maybe even when he had been in hell for all those years? Cas
He heard the voice next, a voice so sweet and solid, one so perfectly amazing, that it made him want to sigh with relief.
“My dear hunter,” He replied, running the blade carefully over his skin. “I know every little thing about you,”
“Not happening, lady,” Dean growled, placing his hand directly in her face. She wrinkled her nose, but moved back to her seat. There was a small smile on her face when she looked at Dean. “Just give us what we came for, and nobody will get hurt,”
He groaned, what the hell was wrong with him? And what was with that asshole who had made him fix up his car right there and then, watching him and telling him everything he had done was wrong. He was the god damn owner of the garage, yet that son of a bitch just grunted and gruffed, making him go above and beyond.
The markings on the ground lit up a golden colour, sparkling like glitter and a disco ball mashed together. He watched, enthralled moreso now than before. His attention was taken by the small spark of gold in the centre of the room.
The ball of light seemed apprehensive, shivering and shuddering a little, zipping back and forth in Sam's large hands, before finally settling down in the middle. He seemed to tumble over a little forward, as if he were nodding.
Castiel didn’t know how they ended up wrapped up in one another on the floor under his spell book pedestal table.
Cas trailed his tongue down Dean’s body, tweaking his erect nipples, biting down lightly on them. Dean gasped, whimpering when one hand slid between his legs and Cas inserted two fingers into him again. He moved so slowly inside him, stuffing him and curling and scissoring his fingers. Dean’s cock was hard and drooling again, he was ready for Cas once again.
“A hunter, all tied up,” Cas’s voice was mocking, deep and throaty. “Aren’t you sick of finding yourself like this? Or…” he took another step closer, still hidden in the darkness, his eyes shining so beautifully bright. “Is this what you truly want, what you truly desire?”
It hurt Sam to be away from Eileen, especially when he had found out that she had died. Her coming back as a ghost had quenched an ache he had deep in his chest. Which had been fully lifted when he had finally brought her back to life. Losing her again because of god’s vanishing act had made him more angry than anything else. But she had been waiting for him after Jack had righted everything.
Such a powerful mage, he probably had a familiar…somewhere. Someone who was beautiful, lovely, and sweet, just like he was. Not someone like Sam, who was bulbous, bumbling and such an idiot whenever he was around Gabriel.
Sam raised his hands to his chest, letting Gabriel settle against his shirt. The ball of light shuddered a little, but stilled. It pressed up against Sam's chest, before submerging itself in. Sam let out a long breath as he did so, his face contorting a little before falling peacefully into a smile.
It made Cas shudder and shiver in their intensity, but he forced that thought right to the back of his head.
moment, but he was glad Cas was keeping this serious. Dean felt submissive then, at the whim of his angel’s thoughts and ideas. It was a great place to be. He was able to show what he truly felt. It was just a table, just sitting there. But the items on that table, the bindings and the buckles and…there was so much there. He could only imagine what it would be like to be tied down completely, heart hammering anxiously like a caged bird, fighting for freedom. Not that he really wanted it.
The almost empty bottle smashed to the ground, the warm beer splashing in a neatly growing circle by his feet. He gripped his shaking and sweaty palms to his chest, his breathing shallow, choking and hot. He slumping his head down onto his bended knees, trying to get his body to respond, to relax. But his breath came out harsher, heavier, chest aching.
The night was sweeter than it had been the night it had happened. Which didn’t make any sense to Dean. How could the world just continue on as normal. How could every one expect him to go back to his normal routine and forget the one person who had been an integral part of his life for the past twelve years.
It had all happened so fast. He had still been in fight or flight mode with death literally following their heels. And Cas...his...Cas had told him he was going to die. For him. To save him.
Cas chuckled, running his hands through Deans short hair, his dark eyes were so damn beautiful. Oh god, Cas was always so handsome, but right now, his angel was so pretty. He had lost himself so many times to those eyes, to that gummy smile. This night was going to be something else, and he couldn’t expect any less from Cas.
She came back a few minutes later, holding a small box in her hands. There were some ancient and archaic looking sigils and wardings in them, some that even Dean hadn’t seen before. He had brushed up on Enochian and Latin and all of that crap after he had gotten into the business, but these things definitely predated anything he had known. She placed the box in the middle of the coffee table, brushing their teacups and plates aside to give it some room. She ran her hand over the top of the box, and a small latch at the very front of it clicked open. Dean watched, alert yet intrigued, as she opened the lid and fished for whatever was inside.
Victor took in a deep breath, sliding the paper doors to one side and stepping through the threshold. He ran a hand through his dark hair and looked around. It was a quaint reception room, the building was a lot bigger on the inside than it looked, it was either that theory or the beautiful golden paper that lined the walls seemed to refrain any thought of fear. An older man walked in through the sliding doors by the reception, he glided to Victor and swept down low into a bow.
right now, like a giant weight had been lifted off his chest and he was flying free. Oh Cas. Beautiful, wonderful,
He growled at the sickly familiar taste, the burn. Wishing this was all just some mad djinn hallucination, or some fairy shit or something. Hell, he’d even take the son of a bitch trickster archangel returning and fucking with him one last time. But it wasn't. He was still here and Cas was still...he must have returned along with the others. He must be finding his way back, right? Anything was better than…
He wasn’t just going to sit idly by anymore and mourn the death of his best friend, his…his god damn angel. He was going to take down the Empty and get his Cas back.
Dean grumbled again, but when he found out Castiel wasn’t moving all that much, he continued his content cuddling. In any other world, in any other time, Castiel would have jumped at the chance to be with Dean, to cuddle him, to kiss him, to do everything that they were currently doing. But this, this was…
“I wish Naomi well,” Crowley laughed as the sorcerer took the box out from his home. "May she get what's coming for her,"
"Alright, thanks." Sam replied, grabbing onto Dean's arm and hoping it would at least help him out of the weird trance he was back in again. There was definitely something strange and powerful about that ball. He could feel it, hell even Gabriel inside of him was beaming a little warmly now, as if he was glad his plan had worked. Sam just hoped it was a good idea, and not that Gabriel was trying to trick them. He wouldn't do that to them, would he? Shaking his head, he focused on what he did know. And that was that the ball in Dean's hand was basically a bomb. But that didn't really answer all of his questions. "So, can you help us get into the Empty? Or how to summon her?"
“Dean, my love,” Castiel whispered, pulling his mouth away from his nipple, skin now dark pink from his attention, he pleaded. “Tell me,”
Cas’s hands caressed his body, and even through his clothes Dean felt like those hands were on his skin, trailing up his arms, across his shoulders, over his chest and down his stomach, stopping just where he wanted him. Dean felt goose bumps rise of his skin, breath whisper soft as a moan escaped his lips.
Castiel had allowed animals and insects and forest creatures to come in and out of his barriers whenever they wanted to. But only those with pure hearts and good intentions were allowed entry. Nothing evil ever entered his premises without him knowing about it and allowing them. If it hadn’t been a spell, and it certainly didn’t look like an animal, not that Castiel could be sure of that, he hadn’t really taken the chance to see…
His phone buzzed in his hand again, shocking him from his thoughts. Taking a cursory glance, he saw Sam’s name flash again for fuck only knew how many times that night. Hadn’t…hadn’t he been out on a date or something? Why was he calling him? He knew he should pick it up, he knew he should at least tell his brother that he was okay. That he wasn’t ignoring him. But he just couldn’t do it.
Naomi quickly pulled it out and held it in front of her. It fell from her grasp, thumping into her chest as a large white orb ripped itself out of the glowing emerald and zipped out of sight into the night sky. Her deadly gaze roved over the darkened alleyway, smirking widely.
“She’s not been wrong so far,” Dean replied. It was true, she had been right about pretty much everything that had been going on. She knew he had Cas’s…grace — or whatever that light show was — inside of him, and she knew who Cas was. All they had done was show up at her house, once Gabriel had given them directions, and told them they needed to talk to her. She had been the one to silence them, usher them into her home and get the kettle on. They had told her they simply wanted to know if they could summon the Empty, and if she had any clue on how to do that.
He turned, steering away from the temptation of an empty room and a cosy lover, and a few flat surfaces to choose from, and faced the door. He barely noticed the little black ball zip through the air, through the glass of the door. But he felt it slip into him, heating him up from the inside, and take over his mind.
It's been a long time coming, and I'm sorry for the delay. I've been having many a medical problem, and had been cooped up in hospital for the majority of it. But I am thankfully recuperating and recovering.
Cas leaned in close, lifting Dean up and dropping a gentle kiss to his forehead, trailing his fingers along Dean’s thigh, bringing his hand towards the inner thigh and with one finger, stroked at the hardened cock straining in his black underwear, curling his hand around it and squeezing it gently. Dean’s gasps brought a shiver through Ca’s body and he continued to grind and pump Dean’s cock through the cotton, repeating the moans from his pretty lips.
he was a familiar to Cas, because hell, they’d be a lot more powerful than they were right now if he even knew how important he was to the timid lummox Gabriel called his baby brother – and in doing so, he was able to control his strong bursts of magic.
Cas had hoped they would have spoken about it last night. But he hadn’t expected his last name to rear its ugly head.
“Oh? Is that so?” She leaned back on the sofa, crossing her arms over her chest, and crossing her legs at the heel. She gave him a look, another one of those long, intense ones that made Dean’s insides crawl. Her gaze fell then, to one that looked worried. “Oh, so you…you really don’t know?”
Both Sam and Dean right now exuded raw sexual energies and uninhabited need to be with him and Gabriel, but did that make them the
“Hey baby,” Sam’s voice was low, like a growl, and his eyes flashed a solid glassy hazel. He got up, standing away from the Sam still lying down on the booth cushions.
“Have you found what I am looking for?” She asked the Rifter, though she knew it couldn't hear her. Her nose was filled with the scent of pine and forest, and something else. It smelled…powerful. Like an electrical current pulsing through the air. She watched, in awe, as the small ball of light shuddered almost coquettishly, and disappeared into the blonde mage's body.
He sat up, like some weird kind of astral projection of himself coming to life, getting up like Dracula emerging from his coffin. The
Castiel knew he would have to explain, tell him all that had transpired between them. How he had waited a millennia to find him again. Now he had his love at last, and he was going to make sure Dean was with him for all eternity, as they should have been before.
It was such an odd sensation. But he felt…worry free. Like everything that had caused him to pause, to stop and think before he did anything rash…
As the shirt and trench coat came off, revealing Cas’s toned torso, his muscular arms - that Dean desperately wanted to dominate him in bed now - guided further up on the mattress. Dean wanted to reach out for him, but his hands were tied too close to the railings, not giving him enough slack.
His magic faltered, however. Their beautiful spiralling melding of magic was siphoning away, separating as if the light was dimming, as if a fire was slowly turning to embers. It was very odd, and completely frightening. His magic had never done that with Dean before. They had unconsciously been sharing their magic, their souls, with one another whenever Dean was over – and he was over a lot – so Castiel knew the way he felt, the way his magic tasted. They were always so close, though in any way buy physically, so whatever had hit Dean, whatever had come through his magical barriers and rendered them both unconscious, it was frightening, it was strong.
Dean knew he would have marks and bruises on him, but he didn’t care. He wanted Cas to come, the wait had gone on long enough, He wanted to
felt rejuvenated every time he stepped foot into the building. Seeing that smiling face charged his own batteries up. And then there were those drinks, made with such care, such love. Sam felt his heart ache every time he tasted a new confectionary, a new treat.
He heard a tap of the bathroom door, a short, sharp rap that startled him from his thoughts, making fresh pain spring to every bruise and callous on his body. Fuck.
But that was neither here nor there. Sam understood the pain of losing a loved one. They had lost too many people after all. But he got it, Cas was…well, he was different. For Dean, he was more than just another family member.
Gabriel rolled his eyes again, taking the finished coffee cup and making his way back to the counter. He needed to get his whittling finished for today, Jody was expecting it for tomorrow and he had to make sure it was done for her early morning cup of coffee.
They both fell onto one another, grasping at one another desperately, pressing open mouthed kisses on whatever flesh they could find. A mischievous glint sparkled in Dean’s green eyes.
“Well maybe we didn’t look hard enough!” Dean growled, pounding his fist onto the table. It didn’t scare Sam, he was expecting Dean to be like this. To be somewhat unhinged. But his anger faded, shattered into a sad, faraway look. “I…I asked Jack…he—he isn’t replying,”
Dean was so lost in the sensation of it, muttering sweet, nonsensical words to his lover. He would do anything for Cas, anything he fucking wanted. Cas’s hand squeezed at the base, his other hand rubbing at his balls in slow, soothing circles, weighing them on his hands before releasing them from his soft touch. Dean shuddered, hands grasping at the plush of the sofa, toes curling reflexively. He came so softly, so sweetly, body raising in a graceful arch before crashing back down to earth.
There was a deep black smoke that enveloped around Dean, and then he was forced to the ground, body unmoving. Castiel watched, unable to get out of this hell he had created for himself. Though he knew Dean was fine, he was okay, they were currently on his floor, cuddling together on the plush carpet. But looking at him now, seeing him like this, it broke his heart.
“Think of it like an Castiel radar for you,” she stated in lay mans terms, so both of them could understand. It was the first time she had outright said his name, and it was then that Dean was sure that the ball of light inside him was
If Cas wanted to play, then hell, Dean would play. They had their safe words, and their limits already perfected, so Cas knew that when Dean snapped against the gag, straining and fighting against the binds, he wasn’t really meaning he wanted to get out. They were roleplaying after all.
Sitting there, he forced himself to focus on his work. This was why he was here, sitting late into the night, working, working, working. He was going to be a lawyer; he was going to do his best. He was going to make his brother proud. He was going to make his
“Cassie? Castiel?” Gabriel said into the phone, but all he heard was the dial tone. Oh great, this was going to be just great. How the hell was he going to get Sleepy Sammy and Sexy Sammy into his car without any problems?
“Get some rest, Sammy,” Gabriel said, letting himself reach out and touch Sam. Sure they had fleeting touches here and there. He knew Sam probably only saw him as a barkeep, or someone who just let him stay late. He probably didn’t know just how Gabriel lusted for him, just how much Gabriel wanted him. As more than just a familiar.
“Not yet, baby,” Cas replied, his voice was pure torture. Little by little he inched his way inside, filling Dean up so completely, enveloping his firm heat. Dean clenched into it. Cas gripped him by his ass, nails digging into his flesh, riding him slowly at first. Dean felt tight, slick and warm, making him whine and moan and beg as Cas’s thrusts quickened.
Hell wasn't really sure if it would work, they hadn't seen Gabriel since that whole bullshit with the alternate worlds Michael. Who knew if he even was alive, or if he too was sleeping in the Empty.
So he hadn’t known just how he had gone from an angry Dean, to being knocked out unconscious, waking up on the soft dewy ground, looking up at the climbing sun rise across the skies, the birds and other forest animals singing sweetly, while his head pounded, his chest aching and his body feeling like a dragon had slammed straight into him.
The clouds were coming together and overtaking the beautiful starry night sky. This would do well for her escapade. She had a plan, she had a mission. She needed to find the All Seeing Eye, take its powers, and then she’d rule the kingdoms. But she had to find it first. And that was proving difficult.
had he fallen? He didn’t care, because this was Cas with him. He forced his eyes open, if only to see Cas. Though it was slow going – very slow going – his eyes opened and he forced them closed at the sudden onslaught of brightness. Moments later the light dimmed enough for him to open his eyes once again.
summon her at all. He still wasn’t so sure if that was possible. Cas had made a deal with the thing after he had been killed — and from what Dean knew, the Empty was like a psuedo heaven for angels, so no human or otherwise had been there before — and he had only been able to fully summon the Empty when his deal with her had been finished.
He smiled, clapping his hands as he made his way over to Sam. He conjured a large lollipop and held it out to the man. Sam took it, used to Gabriel giving him sweets and things whenever he had finished something big.
“It had to have been something ancient,” Castiel followed Gabriel, though his attention was still on the three Winchesters. He still wasn’t sure why the other Sam was unconscious. And if
“Some spell hit you,” Castiel stated, though he knew he was sounding more and more like a robot. But Dean had slowly gotten up and was making his way over to him. Though his footsteps were hesitant, and his head was probably all kinds of fuzzy and probably concussed, he had a look of dazed determination in his eyes.
"Alright, so..." Dean cleared his throat, shaking the pain away and standing up straight. "Yeah, that's the dick bag, fuck Gabriel,"
Sam swore there was some sorcery there, because he could see sparks flying out of those honey whisky eyes. Then he moved his hands in a quick motion and – just like usual – a lollipop appeared in his hands. Sam took it, slightly hesitant in doing so, not because he didn’t trust the mage, but because he didn’t want to look like this was what he had wanted from the beginning.
Castiel watched on, running through the many spells he had known by heart that would incapacitate Sam in a way that wouldn’t hurt him or the others. The other Sam shuddered, looking at the sleeping Sam and grinning.
“Great,” Dean said, with that gorgeous, knee weakening smile. He leaned in close, until Cas was almost bent right over the pedestal. “Now that I’m with you,”
Updates are going to go on pause for now. So, I am so very sorry. I will return as soon as I can with more for you lovely readers. I just need some time to rest and recuperate.
“Just a new blend, doesn’t have a name yet,” Gabriel shrugged his shoulders, “But it should help you sleep at night,”
Dean seemed to think about this for a moment, and then nodded, loosening his arms enough for Castiel to move a little to the place where his book had fallen. Dean’s arms were still looped around him however. When Castiel reached for the book, he was forced back into Dean’s embrace. The man in question curled back around Castiel’s right side, tightening his grip around the sorcerer and buried his head back onto Castiel’s chest, murmuring nonchalant words.
It was fucked up that even the bar he ended up at was boring, the crowd was too drunk, dressed in all sorts of skimpy outfits, the music was too loud and he had no one to celebrate with. God, he should have just stayed home and watched horror movies or some shit. Tonight was looking to be a bust. Though he had repeated offers from anyone who came passed him, for some reason he had turned them all down.
Sorry its taken so long to update, been having a...well lets call it hectic, past few months. But I'm slowly recovering, and honestly, this story is going to take some time to get going, but it will definitely go into my good graces and be up more frequently.
He wanted to see that smile again, and he did so whenever he finished his assignments. Just like he was about…to…do….now.
“What the hell is happening over there?” Gabriel asked, but quickly shook his head. He had to prioritise right now. “No, wait, look, something happened to Sam, there’s two of him,”
But what he didn’t expect was to sit down on a hard, but overstuffed sofa in a froufy little house in the middle of nowhere, drinking tea with a lovely looking old granny.
warmer now that the light was back inside him. That was fucking strange, and it felt…fucking weird, that was for sure. But after the weirdness kinda settled, he felt like his old self again. “It’s kind of like a beacon, or sorts.”
Cas pressed his knuckles into Dean’s ass, hissing sympathetically when Dean whimpered. He pressed down harder to get all of the tension out, using every bit of knowledge he knew about massages, though most of that had come from practice. He wanted Dean to be fully relaxed from his long day. He had the patience of a saint, and determination too.
Dean could feel him smirking, it was as if he had known Dean would want a massage from him, making it all the more simpler to slip his pyjamas to reveal the rest of him.
He was always around pretty girls and hell, Gabriel was the same, he was pansexual. But there was just something about Sam that made him zone everything and everyone else out and just
Dean and the awake Sam had – to what Castiel could surmise – had lost all of their inhibitions; well lost them enough to do whatever it was that they wanted to without thinking of the consequences – Castiel was well aware just how much Sam Winchester was fawning over Gabriel, and vice versa, so he was sure
Denial had morphed into anger when Cas had done that. Anger at the Empty, at the thud, thud, thudding sound of Billie’s fist pounding against the wall. The look on his face, those teary blue eyes, the trembling of his lips. At the emotions lodged in his own throat as he stupidly stood there, shock thrumming through him. Unable to speak. Unable to do anything but watch him.
When he wasn’t baking, he was creating all sorts of things, such as furniture and assorted items. He loved working with his hands, adored the things that came out of his fingers. He had a piece of himself in everything he sold, and he sold them well. Many people, sorcerers, familiars and humans alike, had come to his side, asking for more of his treats, for more of his furniture, saying how he had helped them immensely.
Gabriel placed the piece he was working on down on the table, throwing a rag over it as the last sparks of his magic laced themselves to the barely finished whittling. He turned around the bar and made his way over to Sam. He was thankful that it was late, passed closing time – he always let Sam stay late, the boy was always so engrossed in his work that he never noticed the hours waning, but Gabriel always made sure to have him fed with ample amounts of food and drink. – there was no one else in the store other than them.
The beer bottle dropped from his sweaty grip and hit the ground with an audible thud, beer sploshing out and staining the demon marked cement ground. But Dean didn’t notice. He didn’t notice anything. Not anymore.
for this all the time. Maybe Dean was just concussed or something. Maybe the whiplash was what was causing him to behave this way. After all, Dean didn’t want to kiss him, did he?
. – but Sam Winchester was first and foremost a law student. And he had told that brunette who came with him every once in a while that he wasn’t interested in being a familiar.
Cas grinned, playing the tip of his cock at Dean’s entrance, holding it there. Dean whined, lowering his body down in an attempt to nudge his cock in.
“I beseech you to tell me where to find The King of Hell,” The once gossiping marketplace suddenly quietened, as if the world was put on mute. Thousands of eyes glared at the blonde man.
Sam sleeping right now was the best idea. Though the bad Dean was running around the city doing god knows what.
“It’s like…” She paused, juggling the ball in her hands a little before pressing them straight back into Dean’s chest. Dean let out a breath, feeling a
him. He looked at the caller ID and actually let out a smile. Castiel could help him figure out just what the hell was happening.
“Night Gabe,” he murmured, teasing himself with returning the nickname. Oh, dear lord, that face. It was like the sun rose from its slumber, lighting up the smile of Gabriel’s face.
Dean’s eyes widened as he fought with the ropes, wanting desperately to reach up to his boyfriend and have them speed this whole thing along. Cas grinned, head thrown back as he laughed at his lovers’ predicament.
“You look so beautiful,” Cas murmured, his entire demeanour transfixed on Dean’s face. “Like a sensual god,”
Sam paused, looking up into Gabriel, his complicated eyes, like a god damn a sunflower bursting from the middle and shining on his day, they looked so dark, so dreamy, and so
“I didn’t think you were into this kind of thing,” he grinned, his eyes still that lusty dark burst sunflower.
“Yeah, I was thinking the same thing,” Gabriel murmured, reaching into Castiel’s mind while he had been thinking – one of the witch’s strengths that always caused heartache for Cas at every turn. He watched as Gabriel reached for the still unconscious Sam, seeing the worry in his big brothers’ eyes. “What could have done this, any why only them?”
Cas’s cheeks burst a bright red and his spell book fell to the ground with a loud thud, making him jump. This was so…wrong! What kind of spell made him act so…so emotionally? It had to be that blast that had knocked them both back. He was sure the spell attack had been for Dean and Dean alone, because Cas didn’t feel any different at all. But Dean…Dean was acting so gung ho and sure, more so than usual. It was like he was letting whatever was usually crossing his mind happen!
They didn’t need to say anything to the old lady, not really. She didn’t know there name, and they didn’t know hers. She didn’t want to give it up, just in case they were ever interrogated and her name came up in their conversations. God damn paranoid woman, but he didn’t care. As long as she could help him.
“My name is Crowley, how may I help you, Royal Sorcerer?” Victor seemed shocked that the man knew who he was, but his resolve wavered when he thought of whom he had gone to. He peered into the tomb held in his arms and pointed to one of the words, hoping he could pronounce it properly.
“If Naomi wants the All Seeing Eye, she will have to go get him herself.” Crowley flicked his fingers in the air, calling upon a scantily clad gypsy woman to appear through the slide doors. With a quick word to her ear, she returned through the doors. Victor looked up when he felt the air around him stir. He paused as his gaze fell to the gypsy woman who entered the room, holding a small beautifully decorated box.
Sam’s skin started to glow, and his body started to convulse a little, back bowing with an unseen force that pushed Gabriel back. The mage stumbled back onto the table, and watched with shock as another Sam emerged out from the shine.
Honestly, he should have been more used to waking up in unknown locations. But as his body woke up, he shuddered, taking in the heavy scent of…something…on his nose. What was happening? Looking down, he noticed he was naked. And no, this was not the first time this had happened.
Dean’s thighs loosened, calves relaxing easily as those hands worked their magic on him. And then Cas moved to his feet again, this time paying more attention than before. He took them one at a time and teasing his fingers between his toes, stretching them out as he worked his knuckles into the pads of his feet. It didn’t take much for Dean to let it all go, particularly when his feet had been aching the most. It wasn’t fun being on them all day long. He was soon whimpering like a baby in Cas’s hold, leaning into the touch, wriggling his toes for more.
The air had felt a lot less crowded here, a lot cleaner too. She had instantly recognised this to be the small nook of atmosphere her stupid stepson had taken hostage of. He always did love living in silly buildings and cottages set far in the distance, far away from his mother. She followed the small ball of light, seeing it zip and zag along the air. She understood the allure of this place, it was a lot nicer than the cityscape of the kingdom, and a lot more serene than the dark confines she called her home.
He stumbled down the sun soaked streets, not daring to drive his Baby back home. She’d be safe at Ellen’s; he’d pick her up in the morning. Yeah. Ellen was good people, and Benny would keep watch on her. He bumped into the lamp post, his breath stinking of too much alcohol.
She wanted to find out more, but the Rifter had disappeared into the skies, ready to split again. And Naomi was left here, with an unconscious High Sorcerer and half of his lover. All she wanted was the Eye's power. And now, she had probably caused hell to unleash on the earth.
in hell. God damn it, he never usually cared if people gave a damn about him or not, but today. Well, today was the one day he wanted even just a little bit of attention, and he wasn’t even going to get that.
Sam had been watching, and he had seen Gabriel looking at him, oddly, admiringly. But he had also seen the beautiful and wonderful creations that mage made, each and every one of his pastries, sweets, baked goods, hot drinks, cold drinks, all the way down to the wooden table Sam sat on…they were all so powerful, so wonderful.
However, he was in need of a familiar, much like his brothers had. He had been studying his art so much so that his strengths and sorcery were slowly growing to go haywire. His little brother Castiel had already mastered his art, and was working with his familiar Dean – not that Dean
“Dean, how are you feeling?” Castiel asked, leaning back against the pedestal. This was so unlike Dean, he was usually so subdued and calm, he never got so close to him – not that Cas didn’t
known as a trickster – he looked down at the rich golden colour of the tea and took in the sweet peach like scent.
“Holy crap…that was awesome,” Dean gasped as he fell back onto the bed, spent and sated. “You…you’re awesome,”
And Castiel had all those books and things, he was bound to know just what the hell this whole thing was. Right?
His dark brown hair was curled at the ends, his eyes were shielded by red tinted glasses, he was dressed in a dark suit with a long, tanned trench coat. But god…he looked
